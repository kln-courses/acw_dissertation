<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Poetry of Wandering: "Mont Blanc" in History of a Six Weeks' Tour MICHAEL ERKELENZ I. The in Weeks' 181 "Mont 6 Tour and Blanc" called should "Scene published not be - confused Pont at the Pellisier with end the of in the History fair vale copy of of made a Ser- Six Weeks' Tour should not be confused with the fair copy made in 181 6 and called "Scene - Pont Pellisier in the vale of Ser- vox." Having been circulated in manuscript among Shelley's family, friends, and acquaintances, "Scene - Pont Pellisier" is a coterie poem that its original readers would necessarily have received according to their prior knowledge of Shelley and his own disclosures to them. Re- vised for publication in an anonymous travel book, "Mont Blanc," by contrast, is a public work whose reception among a readership unfa- miliar with the author would have been conditioned exclusively by its accompanying prose narratives. Those narratives change everything. Especially with its original title, the 1816 poem is easily understood (or misunderstood) as a static, loco-descriptive staging of a single scene viewed from Pont Pellisier.1 As the travel narratives suggest, however, the "Mont Blanc" of 1817 - now, significantly, called "Mont Blanc: Lines Written in the Vale of Chamonix" - is a fluid, wandering recon- struction of Shelley's entire Chamonix excursion and a commentary on his travels throughout post-Napoleonic Europe. This essay takes se- riously the publication of "Mont Blanc" in History of a Six Weeks' Tour. It argues that "Mont Blanc" is a poem of unselfconscious wandering, of pure mental flight, inextricably bound up with the purposes of the Shelleys' travels and travel book. Although "Mont Blanc" has attracted extensive critical commen- tary, little has been written on its publication in a travelogue. That the History is "carefully conceived to culminate ... in 'Mont Blanc'" was first proposed by Donald Reiman in 198 6.2 Mary Shelley's prose, he 1.

Reiman's concise observation went unnoticed until 2003 when Jeanne Moskal offered her own brief assessment in an essay on Mary Shelley's travel writing in general. Pausing to consider hierar- chies of genre and gender in History , she traces a thematic hne moving from the political disappointments of post-Napoleonic Europe to the discovery of renewed hope in the sublimities of nature.3 Two years later, Benjamin Colbert offered the first sustained analysis but only to take fundamental issue with any "ideological argument." "Shel- ley's contemporaries," he observes, "may have been more inclined to view 'Mont Blanc' as an appendix to the sublimities of the Geneva letters" than as the climax of a publication whose major motivation is political.4 The state of critical opinion today is perhaps best reflected in the perplexity expressed by "Mont Blanc's" most recent major edi- tor, "Why P[ercy] B[ysshe] S[helley] chose to release the poem in Six Weeks' Tour rather than in (say) The Examiner is difficult to say."5 Clear- ly, the work of demonstrating the importance of "Mont Blanc's" in- clusion in History is still to be done. In their preface, the Shelleys themselves present History as a mere compilation of disparate texts written several years apart by two dif- ferent hands and thrown together in a desultory manner. They did "little else," they say, than "arrange the few materials which an imper- fect journal, and two or three letters to friends in England afforded" into an "unpresuming . . . little volume."6 What they conceal, how- ever, is that some seventy percent of the 1814 journal was written in 1817, 7 that at least two of the Geneva letters were extensively revised for publication, and that "Mont Blanc" had changed since 1816. The preface strikes a pose of desultoriness consistent with the Shelleys' 3. Jeanne Moskal, "Travel "Writing," in The Cambridge Companion to Mary Shelley , ed.

But this pose, so typically Romantic, deserves skepticism. Preparing History for publi- cation forced the Shelleys to refamiliarize themselves with its parts, to consider the appropriateness of gathering them together, and even to introduce changes contributing to the coherence of the whole. While the preface supports the inference that poem and prose bear no special connection to one another, the facts of History9 s composition suggest otherwise. II. The transformation of "Mont Blanc" from coterie poem to public work is witnessed midstream in Fanny Imlay's letter to Mary Shelley on September 26, 1816, soon after the Shelleys returned from Geneva: Beg the favour of Shelley to copy for me his poem on the scene's at the foot of Mont Blanc - and . . . remind him of a letter which you said he had written on these scene's . . . remember you promised them to me when you returned to England. . .8 Clearly, Imlay still regarded "Mont Blanc" as a coterie poem with no imminent prospect of publication. Not only did she wish to have a hand-written copy but, as is typical of coterie poems, she was primed as to what to expect in that manuscript; Mary Shelley had sent her word of it. On the other hand, what Imlay learned already anticipated the reconception of "Mont Blanc" that led to its inclusion in the 1817 History . Previously thought to address a single "Scene - Pont Pellisier in the vale of Servox," "Mont Blanc" was now seen to be describ- ing numerous "scene's at the foot of Mont Blanc." At the same time, "Mont Blanc's" close connection to the Chamonix letter was made clear: on their return to England, the Shelleys promised Imlay copies of both poem and letter; the two were to be read together. At a minimum, reading "Mont Blanc" with History9 s letter IV re- veals that the poem describes the successive sights of a standard tour- ist circuit. Judith Chernaik has already demonstrated the connections between sections III and IV and the letter's accounts of the Mer de 8.

With its rousing affirmation that "Mont Blanc yet gleams on high" (hne 127), section V looks to Shelley's ac- count of his rain-soaked journey back to St. Martin when "visitings of sunset" nonetheless "intervened between the showers and . . . the daz- zling mountains sometimes glittered through a chasm of the clouds" (Prose, pp. 227-28). The second half of section II, describing a typical Shelleyan inside-outside landscape, the "cave of . . . Poesy" pouring forth its stream of poetic images (hne 44), alludes to the "arch of ice" from which the Arveiron rolls "forth impetuously" towards the Arve (Prose, p. 224). In a classic work of Chamonix travel literature Shelley knew, Marc Bourrit celebrates the cavernous source of the Aveiron as a "fairy dwelling," an "enchanted residence, or cave of Fancy."10 The first half of section II describes the ravine of Arve. This pas- sage is most often associated with the narrow defile connecting the vales of Servoz and Chamonix visible from Pont Pellisier. In his letter, however, Shelley first mentions a ravine when describing another nar- row defile encountered earlier on his route. Shortly after leaving St. Martin, the Shelleys arrive at a "small village" (Chedde) where they follow a minor tributary of the Arve (the Ugine) "to view a cascade" (the poem's "ethereal waterfall," hne 26). Returning to Chedde and resuming their journey, they soon enter the ravine: As we proceeded, our route still lay through the valley, or rather, as it had now become, the vast ravine, which is at once the couch and the creation of the terrible Arve. We ascended, winding between mountains whose immen- sity staggers the imagination. (Prose, p. 222) That this place, where the valley narrows and the road ascends, is the ravine of Arve described in "Mont Blanc" is confirmed later in letter IV when Shelley traces his route back to St. Martin: "We repassed Pont Pellisier, a wooden bridge over the Arve, and the ravine of Arve. We repassed the pine forests which overhang the defile. . . . We re- passed the vale of Servoz" (Prose, p. 228). Notice the order of progress.

Finally comes the vale of Servoz, evidently the broader portion of the valley that ends at Chedde, not the entire portion stretching from St. Martin to Pont Pellisier. This spot where the Ugine flows into the Arve also figures in sec- tion I, in which an abstract meditation on the mind incorporates de- tails of a real landscape. The confluence of Arve and Ugine is precisely right as a material analogue for the mysterious internal place "where" the "universe of things" / "vast river" receives its tribute from the "source of human thought" / "feeble brook" (lines 4, 1, 10, 5, 7). Sec- tion I describes the feeble brook winding through a wilderness "where waterfalls around it leap forever / . . . and a vast river / Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves" (Unes 9- 11). Letter IV describes "the cas- cade . . . changing its character to a mountain stream" that "pursued its course towards the Arve, roaring over the rocks that impeded its progress" (Prose, p. 222). Not coincidentally, perhaps, the detail of the Arve "roaring over the rocks" was added in 1817. 11 "Mont Blanc" describes not a single scene viewed from Pont Pel- lesier or multiple scenes fancifully compressed into one, but the entire Chamonix excursion as presented in letter IV. Where it departs from the letter is in its radical interiorization of that tour. The transparent, explanatory prose frees Shelley to retell his story as a highly ellipti- cal movement of mind. Striving for absolute unselfconsciousness, the poem purports to be the product of a mind lost to itself in reverie - of a "legion of wild thoughts" fleeing from the poet's feeling "breast" on "wandering wings," or of a spirit "driven like a homeless cloud . . . / That vanishes among the viewless gales" (lines 41, 47, 41, 58-59). That mind is aware neither of the world as an object distinct from itself nor, for the most part, of itself as an object to be self-consciously perceived in that world. Unlike "Tintern Abbey," for example, "Mont Blanc" is at once highly subjective yet wholly impersonal. There are no rec- ollections of life in lonely rooms for Shelley, no casual asides to dear 11 . Since this detail appears neither in the 1816 letter Shelley actually sent to Peacock, nor in the 1816 journal entry made in Mary Shelley's notebook, the sources from which the Shelleys worked when preparing letter IV, it must have been added in 1817 with "Mont Blanc" in mind. See letter to Peacock, July 22, 1816, in Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley , ed. Frederick L. Jones, 2 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1964), 1, 496; and The Journals of Mary Shelley, 1814-1844, ed.

It remains for letter IV to reveal the coherent narrative embedded in a lyric of dizzying transitions. In the presence of Shelley's prose, "Mont Blanc" can be a poem of pure reverie, of self-absorbed mental wandering, whose gaps readers have been primed to fill. III. By 1817, "Mont Blanc" invited reading alongside additional travel nar- ratives, starting with the history of the 1814 tour, which recounts a quest for the very experience of reverie the poem finally captures. In the guise of apologizing for the work's supposed imperfections, the Shelleys introduce its preoccupations from the outset. Its authors, the preface says, eschew the outdated, didactic reporting of "more expe- rienced and exact observers" in favor of travel conducted on non- or sub-rational grounds. Surrendering to sheer impulse, they pursue "the inconstant summer of delight and beauty which invests this visible world" (Prose, p. 180). Where that inconstant summer will lead, they necessarily cannot anticipate. Theirs is a blind pursuit carried on in the enthusiasm of youth. The resulting narrative is bound to disap- point sober and mature readers expecting a "copious and complete" account. But the Shelleys are not addressing those "less inclined to be amused than to condemn." Their ideal reader is one "whose youth has been past as their 's," one predisposed to finding entertainment in travels pursued waywardly and without care (Prose, p. 180). For the history's real center of interest is not material fact but the (attempted) reveries of the wandering mind. Accordingly, the narrative displays a knowing preoccupation with unconventional travel. In Paris, "after talking over and rejecting many plans," the Shelleys fix on one "eccentric enough" - "to walk through France" (Prose, p. 188). Apparently unaware of the reigning fashion for recreational walking, they present their pedestrianism according to an older code associated with "poverty, unrespectability and possible criminal intent,"12 observing that "in England [they] could not have put [their plan] in execution without sustaining continual insult and impertinence" (Prose, p. 188). In France, however, they are prepared to 12.

Whatever pedestrianism's remaining links with nefari- ous purposes, it was also recognized as conducive to reverie. In the portmanteau that their little ass was to carry up hill and down dale, the travelers included among their "few necessaries" a copy of Rousseau's Les reveries du promeneur solitaire (Prose, p. 188).13 Unlike prewar Grand Touring, walking offered the Shelleys free- dom. Grand Tourists traveled in closed coaches "along tightly-pre- scribed routes" to set, usually urban, destinations (Jarvis, p. 14). As pedestrians, the Shelleys could proceed at their own pace: for them public conveyances with their fixed schedules were always a source of impatience. They could follow any path they chose: "we quitted the great route soon after we had left Nogent to strike out across country to Troyes" (Prose, p. 189). Above all, they could contemplate the land- scape from within its midst, pursuing, "like the swallow, the incon- stant summer of delight and beauty which invests this visible world" (Prose, p. 180). That pursuit is precisely what "Mont Blanc" describes as "holding an unremitting interchange / With the clear universe of things around" (fines 39-40). It is the unselfconscious search for beau- ty not only in the scenes passed through but also in the "still cave of the witch Poesy" where beautiful ghosts are raised in moments of cre- ative reverie. The freedom of pedestrianism, in short, is the freedom to wander, imaginatively as much as physically. Nowhere in the history, however, does wandering succeed in ac- quiring its object. Setting out from Paris on their desultory search for beauty, the Shelleys eventually stray from the common road (the "great route" mentioned above) and inadvertently (so it seems) trace the very route of an Allied invasion of France during the war's dy- ing months. Their attempt at wandering leads them into a disturb- ing landscape of ruin inhabited by sullen, demoralized villagers. Here, Percy Shelley sprains his ankle, underlining the absurdity of their chosen mode of travel. Forced to continue by voiture, they soon find themselves enmeshed in several ludicrous adventures in which their 13.

On their homeward journey, when they opt for another eccentric but ro- mantic mode of travel, watercraft, they are plagued by a class of fel- low travelers who inspire a visceral disgust (Prose, pp. 199, 202). The beauties of the Rhine, like the beauties encountered throughout their journey, cannot be enjoyed unadulterated by ugliness. Their attempt to approach traveling as wandering, experience as reverie, is under- mined at every turn. More than a simple record of failure, the history is, in fact, an ac- count of almost relentless folly and imprudence. Too impatient to wait a day to cross the Channel in the safety of a packet, they hire a small boat that, predictably enough, encounters a violent storm in which they are all nearly drowned (Prose, p. 185). Yet, once in Cal- ais, having hurried their crossing at such great risk, they must wait for their boxes to arrive on the very packet they had earlier rejected. From here, the absurdities multiply. At times traveling through the night, they rush to Paris only to face further delays while arranging somehow previously neglected issues of financing. Only when set free from this "imprisonment" do they think to ask, "but how should we proceed?" They decide, of course, to walk through France, despite the suggestion of indecency and the dangers posed by recently disbanded soldiers (Prose, p. 188). Their ultimate destination, however, remains unknown to us and, it seems, to them. Winding their way to Neuchâ- tel, they again pause "in a consideration of the step it would now be advisable for [them] to take," the limp phrasing reflecting their feeble thinking. Lake Uri is the destination finally chosen. But no sooner do they arrive than they consider crossing into Italy before opting to re- turn to England because they suddenly realize money is running short. This realization precipitates a breakneck journey home via the rivers Reuss and the Rhine in uncertain watercraft that no careful traveler would risk. The description of such folhes comprises a pattern of self-deprecat- ing comedy central to the history. As narrators, the older, wiser Shel- leys of 1817 adopt an ironic tone of apology and self-mockery towards their younger, foolish selves. While pausing for lunch on the first full day of their pedestrianism, we are told, they thought of Don Quixote and Sancho. Their travels are nothing if not quixotic. As witnesses of</page><page sequence="9">86 Keats-Shelley Journal their escapades, readers are invited to gaze on, wonder-struck, much as does the "old forlorn shepherd with a cocked hat" whom the Shelleys pass on the road from Calais in their "irresistibly ludicrous" equipage, with its "unintelligible article of harness, resembling a pair of wooden wings" (Prose, pp. 188-89, 186). A chariot of wooden wings seems pre- cisely right for these hapless aeronauts of the sublime. Readers should interpret such self-deprecation skeptically. The Shelleys' failures and frustrations may say less about their naïveté than about the politics of restoration Europe. The turning point of the 1814 narrative occurs in Brunnen on the Lake of Uri to which the party re- pairs in hopes of discovering "in that romantic and interesting country some cottage where we might dwell in peace and solitude" (Prose, p. 196). All along, as is progressively revealed, the Shelleys have sought a fixed home for the imagination: "Oh! This is beautiful enough; let us live here," exclaims Claire Clairmont on surveying the first pictur- esque sight encountered (Prose, p. 188). In a France ravished by Cos- sacks, however, picturesque scenes are scarce and welcoming homes hard to find. Hence the retreat to Uri, one of the original cantons to win its independence from Hapsburg Austria and the home of Wil- liam Tell, the legendary patriot and rebel. Here, if anywhere, the Shel- leys hope to live in republican splendor. Yet, despite its medieval history, Uri in 1814 was an archconserva- tive, Catholic canton soon to join the League of Sarnen and later the separatist Catholic Sonderbund - alliances staunchly opposed to Uberai reform.14 Crossing the lake on their way to Brunnen, the Shelleys dis- cover the true nature of their proposed home when they encounter "figure [s] of . . . saint [s] in wretched waxwork" decorating islands along the way. They are also shown the site where a fugitive priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and left to per- ish by a superstitious peasantry: "their plaintive voices are still heard in stormy nights, calling for succor" (Prose, p. 197). For an unmarried couple themselves fleeing scandal and stifling convention, this story could hardly have seemed a good omen. In Brunnen, they spend their first evening on the shores of the lake within sight of Tell's chapel, reflecting on a setting that "seemed a fit cradle for a mind aspiring to 14.

However, they can see "no glimpse of [Tell's] spirit in his present countrymen" (Prose, p. 197). Such re- flections, whatever the Shelleys' more practical motives, contribute to their subsequent decision to return to England. A key aim of the history is to report on the political state of Eu- rope following Napoleon's abdication. The Shelleys tour territories closely associated with revolution and republicanism, not just France itself, but the cantons of the Swiss Confederacy that became the revo- lutionary Helvetic Republic (1798-1803), on whose seal Tell appeared as an official symbol;15 and they tour not just the Swiss cantons, but the west-bank states of the Rhine which, under French influence, re- placed the thousand-year-old Holy Roman Empire with the Confed- eration of the Rhine (Rheinbund). These were the sites where reaction had triumphed and Uberai nationahsm would increasingly contend for power. At Mayence (Mainz), the Shelleys note that the "cathedral and towers of the town still bear marks of the bombardment which took place in the revolutionary war," probably during the 1814 AlUed siege of Napoleon's retreating army (Prose, p. 201). But the Shelleys may also be remembering the events of 1793 when the Prussians, dispossessing the French, crushed the short-Uved RepubUc of Mainz and its Jacobin government.16 Intimately involved in the Shelleys' search for a sum- mer of delight and beauty is their search for surviving embers of re- pubUcanism among ruins stretching from Nogent to Mayence. Their failure is ultimately Europe's failure. As travelers, the Shelleys are no bumbUng naïfs. That self-portrayal is a mere pretense, as is their preface's portrayal of the history itself. Can a "little volume" written by authors who were among the first English tourists on the Continent following Napoleon's temporary retreat to Elba possibly be "unpresuming"? Can the scenes described (think of Nogent) possibly be "so famfliar to [their] countrymen, that few facts relating to them can be expected to have escaped the many more expe- rienced and exact observers, who have sent their journals to the press" (Prose, p. 180)?

Were their trav- els really desultory and unpremeditated? The Shelleys most certainly are sincere in expressing their "regret . . . that these materials were not more copious and complete," but they well knew that those "inclined ... to condemn" insufficiency would have censured abundance even more (Prose, p. 180). The beguiling charm Donald Reiman sees masking the radicalism of "Mont Blanc" also masks the radicalism of the history itself. But more than a simple ruse meant to soften the hard edges of a steely journalism, the Shelleys' introduction of a quixotic pursuit seeks to present reverie as an index of repression, to tie its possibilities and impossibilities to the political ailments afflicting a continent. IV. At first, the letters written from Geneva describe travel in which rev- erie no longer seems the issue. Leaving their eccentricities behind, the Shelleys now journey in a closed coach by a predetermined route to a set destination. Yet this rigidity, it soon becomes apparent, was historically determined. The restored French royalists had "become much more circumspect since the escape of [the Comte de] Lavalette," a condemned Napoleonic official daringly rescued by British army of- ficers outraged by the severity of the proceedings against him (Prose, p. 206). 17 Naturally enough, French authorities regarded British nationals with new suspicion. As they had been during their 1814 trip, the Shel- leys were again detained in Paris for longer than they had planned, since they were now required to obtain passports for every leg of their journey. Once underway, they deviated from their route only at the Swiss border and then only after paying a bribe (Prose, p. 208). In 181 6, the French were no longer willing to tolerate the "vagaries of their neighbours," and aimless wandering became impossible (Prose, p. 188). Once again, reverie is presented as a measure of repression. Nonetheless, wandering reasserts itself as a central concern when Shelley and Byron embark on an extended sailing tour of Lake Geneva, where passport restrictions do not apply. But instead of yet another at- tempt to set the mind free on a meandering search for beauty, the tour 17.

It is inconceivable what an enchantment the scene itself lends to those delineations, from which its own most touching charm arises. (Prose, p. 212) Shelley comes to know "the divine beauty of Rousseau's imagination, as it exhibits itself in Julie," by reading his novel in the presence of the very "scene" it describes. This scene, revealing the beauty that origi- nally inspired Rousseau, lends his "delineations" "an inconceivable enchantment." Crucially, it also reveals that "its own most touching charm" derives from these delineations. Rousseau's divine beauty, in other words, shows itself in his capacity not only to receive "influenc- ings" from the world, but also to send "influencings" into it. This is the insight Shelley's journey grants and letter III explores. "Touching charm" comes to mean more than it first appears. The scenery is rendered more touching and charming not simply because infatuated readers such as Shelley imagine it as the haunt of achingly attractive but doomed lovers known to be purely fictional. In creat- ing Julie, ou La Nouvelle Héloïse , Rousseau's mind was "so powerfully bright as to cast a shade of falsehood on the records that are called real- ity" (Prose, p. 217). These records show no traces of the "real" existence of a Julie or a St. Preux. Yet the Empress Maria Louisa once "slept at Meillerie," despite its squalor, "in remembrance of St. Preux" (Prose, p. 214) - as if, in other words, St. Preux had actually resided there, a fancy endorsed by the inhabitants of Clarens, who "are impressed with an idea, that the persons of that romance had actual existence," and, in turn, by Shelley and Byron: "a thousand times, thought I, have Julia and St. Preux walked on this terrassed road, looking towards these mountains which I now behold; nay treading on the ground where now I tread" (Prose, p. 218). The scenery's "own most touching charm" arises from the novel precisely because the novel transforms percep- tion. It charms readers into accepting its veracity. The implications, for Shelley, are profoundly liberating. In convincing readers of his characters' reality, Rousseau gave force and substance to a conception of love deeply at odds with Christian orthodoxy. As highly romantic, purely natural lovers, Julie and St. Preux present a challenging,</page><page sequence="13">90 Keats-Shelley Journal indeed a scandalous, alternative to conventional notions of love and mar- riage. As Rousseau's achievement testifies, reverie can lead to imaginings that offer radical alternatives to oppressive morality and politics. More importantly, it can also lend those alternatives the force of truth. For Shelley, Rousseau matters because he demonstrates that our reveries can join the "universe of things" as things and change the world. In letter III, Shelley pointedly contrasts Rousseau's powerful imag- inings with the powers of works altogether more substantial - the ma- terial monuments of Roman tyranny, ancient and modern. It is no ac- cident that the first stop of Shelley and Byron's excursion is Hermanee, "a beautiful little village, containing a ruined tower, built, the villagers say, by Julius Caesar." Its "immensely solid" walls are made of stone so hard that tourists still can see the chisel marks of Caesar's legions (Prose, p. 212) - "liberticide legions," as Shelley elsewhere calls them.18 Yet the tower was once three times the size it now is, and it is the only survivor of a complex of four towers that once stood on the site. Cae- sar, the destroyer of Roman republicanism, built his fortifications to last, but, like the Roman Empire itself, they eventually crumbled. In an ironic twist, the republicans of Geneva dismantled the towers "for their own fortifications in 1560" (Prose, p. 212), when their traditional enemy, Catholic Savoy, concluded a treaty with the Catholic cantons of Switzerland (including Uri) that placed Geneva under renewed threat (Thürer, p. 61). The fortifications built then would have played a decisive role during the famous Escalade ("scaling of the walls") in 1602 when Geneva repulsed Savoy's surprise attack and assured its sur- vival as a Protestant republic.19 Without saying so, Shelley begins his narrative in Hermanee (in Shelley's day a town newly restored to the rule of the Savoyard monarch) to establish the conditions for properly understanding the achievement of Rousseau. The works of hate-filled tyranny, no matter how materially real, cannot survive. The works of love-inspired reverie, however immaterial, promise "to cast a shade of falsehood on the records that are called reality" (Prose, p. 217). Later, Shelley and Byron visit a second fortress, the notorious Cas- tle of Chillon, a Savoyard possession until 1536 and lately restored to Savoy by the Congress of Vienna. Chillon is a "monument" to Chris- 18. Shelley and his Circle , vii, 29. 19.

Un- like Byron, Shelley remains silent about Chillon's most famous pris- oner, the Genevan patriot François Bonivard, preferring to define its victims more broadly as Protestants who "shook, or who denied the system of idolatry, from the effects of which mankind is even now slowly emerging" (Prose, p. 217). Chillon is the place where Catholics attempted to torture Protestant skeptics back into belief. Its dungeons are as deep as the tower of Hermanee is high and its walls thick. But just as the tower was an ineffective instrument of ancient Roman tyr- anny, so Chillon is the failed instrument of modern Roman Catholic tyranny. Its victims' beliefs could not be turned, as the survival of Ge- neva in the face of Savoyard aggression testifies. Shelley begins his pas- sage on Chillon immediately after his description of Rousseau's bright mind casting a shade of falsehood on reality. We are to take the point: the works of tyranny, however brute and massy, are singularly incapa- ble of commanding belief in the way that Rousseau's airy reveries are. Near the end of letter III, Shelley brings his dialectic of Rousseau- vian idealism and tyrannical materialism to a climax by drawing an explicit contrast between Rousseau and the famous historian of the Roman Empire's dechne and fall, Edward Gibbon. While visiting Gib- bon's "decayed summer-house" (Prose, p. 219), Shelley refuses to pay the same homage to Gibbon as Byron does, fearing to outrage the greater and more sacred name of Rousseau; the con- templation of whose imperishable creations had left no vacancy in my heart for mortal things. Gibbon had a cold and unimpassioned spirit. I never felt more inclination to rail at the prejudices which cling to such a thing, than now that Julie and Clarens, Lausanne and the Roman Empire, compelled me to a contrast between Rousseau and Gibbon. (Prose, p. 220) That the author of the "Necessity of Atheism" should feel an "inclina- tion to rail at the prejudices" of the foremost Protestant skeptic of the age - whose infamous attack on primitive Christianity challenged the reigning "system of idolatry" more profoundly than did the work of any other contemporary English writer - is truly remarkable. What damns Gibbon in Shelley's eyes is a "cold and unimpassioned spirit"</page><page sequence="15">92 Keats-Shelley Journal that prejudices him against writing the very kind of "history" repre- sented by La nouvelle Hélotse. For the coolly rational historian, enslaved to "the records that are called reality," Rousseauvian history is always false, and Rousseauvian mental wandering always a prelude to error. With his insistence on the primacy of material "fact," Gibbon is blind to the impassioned mind's contributions to our perceptions of reality. As coercive as empire's towers, his skepticism offers no positive alterna- tive to the enthusiasm it deflates. Not for nothing do Shelley's descrip- tors "cold and unimpassioned" echo the adjectives "cold and inhuman" earlier applied to the intolerant Catholicism responsible for Chillon. Shelley's purpose in introducing Gibbon into letter III is to bring reverie's challenge of tyranny sharply into focus. As a notorious antag- onist of early Christianity, Gibbon was known to his early readers as the "English Voltaire" whose ironic skepticism helped father the French Revolution.20 Like Rousseau, he, too, challenged the prevailing system. But, for Shelley, his challenge was a "mortal thin[g]" as destructive as the Revolution itself finally proved to be. Rousseau's reveries, by con- trast, created where they destroyed. In the relationship of Julie and St. Preux, they offer a powerful alternative to Christian norms of love and marriage. Such creations humanize. They take hold of people - even an emperor's wife - rendering them more open and accepting. As such, they provide more durable - "imperishable" is Shelley's word - exam- ples for political progressives than does Gibbon's work (Prose, p. 220). For Shelley, the way forward is suggested by the final image of let- ter III. On his return from Gibbon's house, he "walked on the pier which the lake was lashing with its waves" during the day's "only in- terval of sunshine" : A rainbow spanned the lake, or rather rested one extremity of its arch upon the water, and the other at the foot of the mountains of Savoy. Some white houses, I know not if they were those of Meillerie, shone through the yellow fire. (Prose, p. 220) Shelley invokes that ubiquitous symbol of divine promise, the rainbow spanning storm-tossed waters. Shining "through the yellow fire" of 20. With the publication of a new edition of the Memoirs and a withering notice in the Quar- terly Review that revived all the old political charges against him, Gibbon in 1816 was back in the public eye as a father of revolution.

Meillerie is, of course, the scene of St. Preux's famous visionary exile where the rejected lover consoled himself by observing or thinking he was observing - he is not quite sure - Julie's house directly across the lake at Vevai.21 As Julie's house once was for St. Preux, so the white houses of Meillerie are for Shelley symbols of an immortal desire, a point he underlines by assign- ing them a fiery radiance. St. Preux is but the type of a human yearn- ing for love that offers a surer antidote to tyranny than does any dose of ironic skepticism. Shelley's vision of the rainbow and houses, more emblem than reportage as Edward Duffy notes,22 is of the promise in- herent in Rousseauvian love. It alone can deliver a continent from the storms of reaction. In 181 6, as Shelley may well have known, love's political dimensions were very topical in Savoyard towns such as Meillerie. Victor Emman- uel I, Duke of Savoy, Piedmont and Aosta, and King of Sardinia, had recently returned to power at the head of a devoutly Catholic regime determined to stamp out any remnant of French revolutionary senti- ment in its territories.23 Significantly, an important ground on which it chose to battle revolution was "concubinary union." Believing that "Napoleonic rule had fostered a widespread atmosphere of depravity and sexual irresponsibility among its subjects," the regime made their sexual transgressions "the business of the highest organs of the state" (Broers, p. 620). Civil marriage no less than concubinage, the two being seen as equivalent, became the target, particularly in Savoy, which had been incorporated into revolutionary France in 1792 and which, conse- quently, had more cases than elsewhere. The government formalized its policies against concubinage in October 181 6 and legally revoked all existing civil marriages in July 1817, contemporaneously with History9 s early stages. At stake, in the government's view, was loyalty to the Sa- voyard monarchy and indeed to monarchy itself: "the demand of the monarchy that so many couples remarry, as well simply marry [sic] , in 21.

F°r the regime, breaking with "Catholic marriage was tacit Jacobinism; concubinage was as much a conspiracy against the foundations of the State as republicanism" (Bro- ers, p. 617). In contrasting Rousseau's love-inspired reveries with reac- tionary government, Shelley proposes a mode of political resistance that reactionaries themselves would have understood. Celebrating La nou- velle Héloïse , as letter III does, is a deeply political act. For Shelley, the issue of concubinage was also, of course, deeply per- sonal. In 1816, he and Mary were as yet unmarried; indeed, he had aban- doned his legal wife, Harriet, to elope with Mary and enter into the very kind of union that so appalled Victor Emmanuel. These facts are of more than biographical interest, since the anonymous History of a Six Weeks' Tour is a secret narrative of their elopement that constantly seeks to betray its secret. All those rash eccentricities (the risky flight across the Channel, for instance), at first glance so comically irrational, are so many hints at the Shelleys' true situation. The progressive revelation that their apparently aimless wandering, in fact, aims at securing a cottage where they might "dwell in peace and solitude" (a very necessary convenience for runaways) is but another such hint, as is the melodramatic tale of the priest and his mistress abandoned to their fate by a superstitious peasantry (Prose, p. 196). Once the History turns to La nouvelle Héloïse , astute readers are meant to see the authors as the new Julie and St. Preux. The celebration of Rous- seauvian reverie, then, not only legitimizes their romantic relationship but also declares its political significance. As an act of geographical, moral, and imaginative wandering, their elopement challenges the repressive or- thodoxies of Victor Emmanuel and his ilk. Much like the eponymous he- roes of Laon and Cythna (1817), a loving couple whose incestuous relation- ship could not be more scandalously heterodox, the Shelleys of History of a Six Weeks' Tour are partners in politics as in love. V. In a well-known, still influential reading, Harold Bloom established the idea that Shelley begins "Mont Blanc" by "rush[ing] in medias res." This idea could never have resonated had it been accepted that the beginning of "Mont Blanc" is also the ending of History. The prose narratives provide not only the "touch of natural description" that</page><page sequence="18">Shelley 's Poetry of Wandering 95 Bloom finds lacking but also a basis for understanding the entire po- em.24 When Shelley presents the mind as a place where the "source of human thought" brings its tribute to the "universe of things" "with a sound but half its own," he is not so much introducing a new theme as fully articulating an idea already broached (hne 6). This is the mind in a state of creative reverie casting "a shade of falsehood on the re- cords that are called reality." Under the influence of passion - the "sound" that half derives from our perception of "external" sublimi- ties - the "source of human thought" brings to consciousness ideas of such force that they join the river of sense impressions as sense im- pressions. Precisely thus are the inhabitants of Clarens 66 impressed with an idea, that the persons of that romance had actual existence" (Prose, p. 218, emphases added). The Humean language is deliberate. In his Treatise, David Hume argues that the "warmth of a poetical enthusi- asm" can sometimes mislead the mind into mistaking its "ideas" for its "impressions."25 For the skeptical philosopher, such mental events, such moments of imaginative wandering, are troubling sources of er- ror. But for the radical poet-lover, they are the natural and inevitable means by which great minds, such as Rousseau's, defy orthodoxy and create the world of their desires. When Shelley, then, visits the sublime scenes "at the foot of Mont Blanc," he applies insights developed during his earlier travels. Now ev- ery landscape of natural creativity he meets mirrors the creative, wan- dering mind. Entering the ravine of Arve, having earlier encountered the confluence of Arve and Ugine, he contemplates a scene where pines and winds produce an "old and solemn harmony" ; waterfalls and sun- beams, "earthly rainbows"; and caverns and churning river, "a loud, lone sound no other sound can tame" (fines 24, 25, and 31). Almost inev- itably, the scene strikes him as the phantom semblance of his own mind, his "own separate phantasy," "holding an unremitting interchange / With the clear universe of things around" (hne 36). At one moment, this Doppelgänger floats above the ravine gathering impressions, and at the next it escapes full consciousness to search for ideas in the cave of imagi- nation. The "faint image" with which it returns represents not just the 24. Harold Bloom, Shelley's Mythmaking (New Haven, CT : Yale University Press, 1959), p. 23. 25.

Shelley's encounter with the ravine is an encounter with the force of his own creativity. Much as the ravine's giant pines have the power to enthrall the otherwise "chainless winds," the mind in its imaginative wanderings has the power to bend reality to its purposes (hne 22). "Mont Blanc" is a poem of reverie that follows History in making the powers of reverie its subject. However, "Mont Blanc" also follows a second, but less obvious, current in History to contemplate the limitations of reverie. Against its meditations on mind and ravine, it sets reveries seeking the origins of thought and thing in some transcendent Power enthroned on Mont Blanc. These reveries assume a decidedly skeptical tone more indebted to Gibbon than Rousseau. While visiting the Mer de Glace, a popular site for experiencing the religious sublime, Shelley encounters not a scene of otherworldly presence but a "desart" of absence "peopled by the storms alone" (hne 67). His attempt to follow the usual practice of discovering the Maker in his works yields no visionary insights, no "gleams of a remoter world" (hne 49), but rather a denigrating irony worthy of Gibbon: Is this the scene Where the old Earthquake-daemon taught her young Ruin? Were these their toys? Or did a sea Of fire, envelope once this silent snow? None can reply - all seems eternal now. (lines 71-75) The proposition that earthquake-daemons on a family outing could have created this "ghastly, and scarred, and riven" landscape is as ab- surd as the proposition that a "sea / Of fire" could have become a sea of ice (hne 71). Shelley mocks the kind of reasoning from effect to cause notoriously attacked by Gibbon's friend Hume, targeting in par- ticular the widely circulated reasoning of believers that so extraordi- nary a phenomenon as the Mer de Glace could have been created only by divine fiat. None of the desert's "shapes" so "hideously" "heaped around" "can reply" to questions concerning cause (lines 70, 69, 70). With its "mysterious" (not mystical) tongue, the wilderness commu- nicates precisely by failing to communicate (hne 76). It "teaches" only a negative truth: an "awful doubt" in any attempt to ascertain a su-</page><page sequence="20">Shelley's Poetry of Wandering 97 pernatural first cause or, to say the same, a mild faith in an everlasting natural universe without beginning or end (hne 77). Despite having sided with Rousseau against Gibbon, Shelley retains the Gibbonesque view that reverie cannot help us grasp a transcendent cause beyond sensory perception. It may yield insights into the mystery of mind but it can offer no insights into the mystery of Power. When he moves to the glacier of Bossons, which unlike the Mer descends directly into the vale, Shelley, in fact, presents imaginative overreaching as the very source of human misery and ruin. The sev- eral branches of Bossons are snakes slowly creeping towards their prey from "far fountains" likened to a "city of death, distinct with many a tower / And wall impregnable of beaming ice" (lines 101, 105-06). Not only is this city closed to the enquiring mind - its precipices are piled "in scorn of human power" - but its successive meltings and freezings by "Frost and the Sun" feed the predatory glaciers' slow descent: the piling of "dome, pyramid, and pinnacle" is simultaneously a melting of dome into pyramid and pyramid into pinnacle (lines 103, 104). This gradual dechne ends in a Gibbonian fall, the city becoming, like an- cient Rome, "a flood of ruin" (hne 107): The dwelling-place Of insects, beasts, and birds, becomes its spoil; Their food and their retreat for ever gone, So much of life and joy is lost. The race Of man, flies far in dread; his work and dwelling Vanish, like smoke before the tempest's stream, (lines 114- 19) Worse than futile, imaginative overreaching is emphatically destructive. Like the "vast pines" that strew themselves before the glaciers as if in rit- ual self-sacrifice, overreaching humans place themselves in ruin's "des- tined path" with a perverse wilfulness (Unes 109, no). Even as "distant lands" beckon where the glaciers are tamed into "one majestic River" bearing life-sustaining "breath and blood," we insist on scaling the on- tological heights and fabricating false gods of Malthusian want who roll cycles of scarcity, prédation, and war upon our heads (fines 123, 124). As History reveals, section IV has a precise historical reference. The poem's glacial ruin recalls the travel narrative's "desart plain" encoun- tered by the Shelleys upon striking out "across the country to Troyes"</page><page sequence="21">98 Keats-Shelley Journal (Prose, p. 190). "Nothing could be more barren and wretched," Mary Shelley observes : "the ground was chalky and uncovered even by grass, and where there had been any attempts made towards cultivation, the straggling ears of corn discovered more plainly the barren nature of the soil" (Prose, p. 190). Those "straggling ears of corn" rising out of a bar- ren soil anticipate Percy's description of the pines that "in the mangled soil / Branchless and shattered stand" (Unes no- 11). Equally prefigura- tive is the emphasis on whiteness. The soil is "chalky." The ground is infested by "insects, which were of the same white colour as the road." One village's gardens are "covered with the white dust of the torn cottages" (Prose, p. 190). On the second day of their travels through "this track of uncultivated country," the travelers see "nothing but a white expanse of ground, where no bramble or stunted shrub adorned its barrenness" (Prose, p. 191). All but one of these details (the chalky soil) were added in 1817. The general lifelessness of the scene resembles the irremediable barrenness of the glacier bed, making "the dwelling- place / Of insects, beasts, and birds ... its spoil" (fines 115-16). Of course, it was across this lifeless plain that the Cossacks passed in 1814, spreading ruin among the surrounding villages on their way north from Switzerland, land of the death-dealing glacier. At Nogent, the Shelleys observe a town "entirely desolated" : "nothing could be more entire than the ruin which these barbarians had spread as they advanced" (Prose, p. 189). At St. Aubin, they find "the cottages roof- less, the rafters black, and the walls dilapidated; - a few inhabitants re- mained." At Echemine, they encounter a village that "had been once large and populous" but that now "presented in every direction the melancholy aspect of devastation" (Prose, p. 190). Not a city but a flood of ruin indeed. Underlying section IV is a reading of human history as a record of the dire consequences of giving a name to Power and call- ing it God. This reading and the skepticism underpinning it do not, however, represent the poem's final position on reverie. Shelley's meditation on its powers and limits finds a resolution in the ultimate section of "Mont Blanc" recounting the moment on the road to St. Martin when he glimpses the mountains glittering through the clouds: "Mont Blanc," he declares, "yet gleams on high" (fine 127). The adverb "yet" signals duration - Mont Blanc continues gleaming despite the rain - but also</page><page sequence="22">Shelley s Poetry of Wandering 99 a turn from his earlier skepticism. With "these primaeval mountains," no less than the "naked countenance of earth," having taught that "Power dwells apart," Shelley now asserts, "the power is there" (Unes' 100, 99, 97, 127). Indeed, defining this power as precisely "the still and solemn power of many sights and many sounds / And much of life and death," he seems to have lifted the veil on the unmoved mover of those cycles of mutability and mortality previously presented as self-suffi- cient (lines 128-29, 84-100, emphases added).26 Section V circles back to Shelley's speculations on gleams of a remoter world visiting the soul in sleep. At this stage, we might almost expect mention of some anthropomorphic sky god sitting on his secret throne. What we get, however, is a largely naturalistic description of gla- cier formation caused by a diffuse collection of "forces." The "snows descend / Upon that mountain," winds "heap" them "with breath / Rapid and strong" and lightning "broods / Over the snow" in vapor- ous latency (fines 131-32, 135-36, 138-39). The summit is indeed a scene of causal origins: glaciers, warmed by the brooding, lightning-infused rain clouds, will slip down the mountainside to become the breath and blood of distant lands. But even if personified, the responsible agents are neither a single nor an otherworldly power. Since the snows are unseen, the winds silent and the lightning innocently "voiceless," they may be nothing more than figments of Shelley's imagination (fine 138). The grand, revelatory declaration - "the power is there" - dwindles into a description of natural agency itself circumscribed by a rigorous skepticism. Section V, then, presents an oscillation between positive assertion and skeptical doubt that becomes acute in the final fines, an excited apostrophe to the mountain subject: The secret strength of things Which governs thought, and to the infinite dome Of heaven is as a law, inhabits thee! 26. Lines 84-100 are heavily indebted to the opening lines of James Montgomery's "The Brah- min" (1797), written while the poet was incarcerated in York Castle for a seditious libel on Brit- ain's war with France. Shelley approved the poem's advocacy of non-violence and its vision of a self-sustaining natural order free from the interventions of a capricious deity. He assimilated the example of Montgomery, the son of Moravian missionaries, to the Protestant skeptics imprisoned at Chillon.</page><page sequence="23">ioo Keats-Shelley Journal And what were thou, and earth, and stars, and sea, If to the human mind's imaginings Silence and solitude were vacancy? (lines 139-44) Mont Blanc is the habitation, suddenly, not of snows, winds, and light- ning, but of some lawgiving "strength" that ventures abroad to gov- ern thought and thing alike. Once again, Shelley seems on the brink of declaring the mountain home to an omnipotent otherworldly intel- ligence; yet, once again, he immediately turns course, asking a skepti- cal question that effectively relocates that power from the mountain's summit to the human mind. If the mind were indeed to regard the silence and solitude of nature's sublime sights as a vacancy, those sights would, simply, remain vacant. Mind and world are governed by Pow- er, but Power, paradoxically, is wholly dependent on mind. The poem's rigorously dialectical argument setting a Rousseauvian strophe (sections I and II) against a Gibbonian antistrophe (sections III and IV) arrives finally at a synthesizing epode finely balancing faith in and skepticism toward imaginative wandering. Invoking a scandalous "paradox" first found in Hume, Shelley proposes that Power rests not in God or nature or both but entirely in the human mind.27 While constantly conjoined objects may present themselves to consciousness willy-nilly, the mind alone decides whether the connection between them is to be considered a vacancy or a causal relation. Without the mind's assent, there is neither secret strength of things nor mountain- dwelling unmoved mover, nor - crucially - law. The mind must have faith and fill the voids in our perception if the world is to be saved from chaos. Even so, it is under no obligation to name Power, let alone subscribe to a dogmatic belief in an anthropomorphic deity. Signifi- cantly, Shelley uses the plural "imaginings," not the singular "imag- ining," suggesting that no single imagining can encompass Power: it must be imagined and re-imagined in an endless process. To derive "absolute truth" from a single reified imagining is the habit of super- stition and tyranny, while acknowledging a constant stream of human imaginings inhabiting nature's vacancies, but not exhausting them, helps sustain a rational order in our perceptual world without confus- 27.

The publication of "Mont Blanc" at the end of History of a Six Weeksy Tour was no blithe gesture meant to puzzle future editors but a place- ment pointed and precise. The fulfillment of the continually sought- after, but continually frustrated, moment of reverie that haunts the 1814 journal and even the 1816 letters, the poem brings to a climax Shelley's legitimation of the moral, imaginative, and political wandering fig- ured by his elopement with Mary.28 His primitivist meditation on the highest, most sublime mountain in Europe questions reverie's access to transcendent realities even while assigning it a role in creating both the world of our perceptions and the power governing that world. The dic- tates of the Victor Emmanuels and their fantastical gods are based on nothing more than epistemological overreaching unworthy of our as- sent. It is this truth that Shelley - writing as a second St. Preux, the lov- er but also the tutor of his own nouvelle Héloïse - sets out for a reader- ship oppressed by reactionary conditions in a post-Napoleonic Europe where wandering is restricted at every turn. Mary and all those who have passed their youth pursuing an "inconstant summer of delight and beauty" remain free to realize humane alternatives to the crushing false- hoods of the Ahrimanic mountain. Over the decades, "Mont Blanc" has proven exceptionally elusive precisely because critics have wrenched it from its proper context and otherwise relied on such questionable guides as the abstruse, ambiguous, and abandoned fragment "On Life."

Shelley was writing a more overt justification of his relationship with Mary, Rosalind and Helen , during the period when History was being prepared for publication. Not insignificantly, he began drafting that poem in the very notebook, indeed on some of the very pages, where he had drafted "Mont Blanc."</page></plain_text>
