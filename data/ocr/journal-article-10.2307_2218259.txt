<plain_text><page sequence="1">341 HOBBES, MECHANISM, AND EGOISM Hobbes is often regarded as the leading exponent of psychological egoism. While some merely claim that Hobbes' description of man's motives is that of a psychological egoist, others claim that his mechanism, i.e., his mechanical account of human behaviour, entails an egoistic psychology.l In this article I shall not consider the claim that Hobbes' description of man's motives is that of an egoist but shall be concerned only with the claim that his mechanism entails psychological egoism. I shall show that psychological egoism cannot be validly deduced from any version of Hobbes' mechanical account of human behaviour and, further, that there is no other causal account of human behaviour from which psychological egoism can be validly deduced. Psychological egoism is the theory that the only motive for human action is self-interest. To show that Hobbes is not a psychological egoist it would be necessary to provide a clarification of the concepts of 'motive' and 'self-interest'. However, simply to show that psychological egoism cannot be deduced from Hobbes' mechanism, it is not necessary to investigate the concept of ' self-interest', only that of 'motive '. For the fact that psychological egoism is a theory about motives is sufficient to make it impossible for it to be derived from any mechanical theory, including Hobbes '. Most often one talks of motives in connection with crimes, for example, murder. In these cases, the most common answers to the question 'What was his motive ? ' are one word answers, for example, revenge, jealousy, money. However, for these answers to be correct the person committing the murder must have certain beliefs; for example, if the motive for the murder is revenge, then the person must believe that his victim or someone related to him has injured someone. Further, he must regard this belief as his reason for committing the murder. To have a motive for doing an action entails both that one have some belief and that he regard this belief as his reason for doing that action. But not every belief can provide a motive for any action, not even if it is regarded by the actor as his reason for doing that action. For example, the belief that someone's third cousin once took a penny from my third cousin does not provide a motive for my killing him, even if I regard it as doing so. Such a belief would not be thought to provide an adequate explanation of my action and so it would not be regarded as providing a motive.2 If holding a certain belief does not provide 1See e.g., A. Campbell Garnett, Ethics, A Critical Introduction (New York, 1960), pp. 123 ff. 2This depends partly on the customs prevalent at the time and partly on the nature of the particular person. So that, given suitable customs and a person with an extreme upbringing, even the above belief might be thought to provide a motive. But in any- thing like normal circumstances it would not.</page><page sequence="2">342 BERNARD GERT an adequate explanation for doing a particular action then that belief does not provide a motive for that action, even if the person doing the action sincerely claims that the belief was his reason for doing it. Thus motives are very complex things. Unlike pains, a person's reports about his motives are not incorrigible. When a person who knows how to speak the language sincerely says that he has a pain, that is the end of the matter. But a person who knows the language may sincerely claim that a certain belief provided his motive for doing an action and we may dispute that claim. For we may not regard his belief as providing an ade- quate explanation for his action. Motives are also unlike anger. When a person claims not to be angry, then if he continues to act in certain ways without providing some reason, for example, he is rehearsing for a play, his claim can be completely dis- counted. But if a person sincerely denies that he had a certain motive in doing an action, then no matter how he continues to act, his denial cannot be completely discounted. For unless the person himself regards a certain belief as providing his reason for doing an action it cannot be regarded as his motive by anyone else. Thus, to have a motive in doing an action entails having a belief which (a) you, yourself, regard as providing the reason for your action, and which (b) provides an adequate explanation of your action. If the belief fails to satisfy either (a) or (b) it does not provide a motive. If the belief satisfies (a) but does not satisfy (b) then the belief does not provide a motive but merely counts as a rationalization and some other kind of explanation is sought. If the belief does not satisfy (a) but, together with some theory, does satisfy (b), then that belief is an unconscious motive.3 If no belief satisfies either (a) or (b), then an explanation of your action may be sought in causal terms, i.e., by citing some fact about the condition of your body.4 The following examples may help to clarify these points. In the first case, someone believes that drinking two quarts of milk a day will make him healthier. He also regards this belief as his reason for drinking the milk. If this belief provides an adequate explanation of his drinking the milk, then we can say that his motive in drinking the milk is to improve his health. In the second case, someone believes (or believed) that his mother wanted him to drink two quarts of milk a day. He denies that this is the reason for his drinking the milk now. If we think that this belief, together with our psychological theory, does provide an adequate explanation for his drinking the milk, then we say that this belief provides the unconscious motive for his action. If he has no beliefs which provide an adequate ex- planation of his action, whether he thinks that a certain belief is his reason for his action or not, then we may seek a causal explanation, e.g., he is suffering from a calcium deficiency. 30bviously, it is much more complicated than this. For example, you may not now have any belief which provides an explanation, but may have had some belief at some time in your distant past, which in some way explains your present actions. 4Also one could cite habit, but I am only interested in these three types of explana- tion-motive, unconscious motive, and bodily cause.</page><page sequence="3">HOBBES, MECHANISM, AND EGOISM 343 From these examples it is clear that one also can, with no confusion, speak of causes and motives for desires as well as for actions. We can pro- vide an adequate explanation for someone wanting to drink two quarts of milk a day by citing a motive, for example, his belief that it will make him healthier. We can also provide an adequate explanation of this desire by citing an unconscious motive, for example, his belief that it would please his mother. And finally we can provide an adequate explanation of this desire in causal terms, for example, by pointing out that he is suffering from a calcium deficiency. Although there is no logical incompatibility in giving all three of these explanations, if an adequate explanation is given in terms of motives, one does not generally look for an explanation in terms of un- conscious motives or causes, i.e., the condition of the body. Although it seems from the terminology that an explanation in terms of unconscious motives is more like an explanation in terms of motives than one in terms of causes, the opposite is, in fact, true. The only difference between a causal explanation and one in terms of unconscious motives is that in the latter the state of one's mind, rather than the state of one's body, provides the explanation. That is, an explanation in terms of un- conscious motives differs from the usual causal explanation only in referring to psychological facts, i.e., present or past beliefs, rather than to chemical, biological, etc., facts. Both differ from explanations in terms of motives in that the person whose actions or desires are being explained may be unaware of the facts used in the explanation. One cannot be unaware of the facts used in explaining his action in terms of motives; for to explain an action in terms of motives requires that the person whose action is being explained have a belief which he regards as the reason for his doing the action. It follows from this that if I do not know why I am doing something, I do not have a motive in doing it. It also follows that I cannot think that such-and-such is my motive and it turn out later that I had a different motive. It does not follow, however, that I cannot think that I did a certain action with such-and-such a motive and it turn out later that I did not have any motive at all in doing it. This would happen when the belief I cite as my reason for doing an action does not provide an adequate explana- tion of it. Here an explanation would be sought in terms of unconscious motives or causes. For example, I may be hypnotized and told to open a window in ten minutes. If ten minutes later I open the window, I may offer any number of beliefs as my reason for doing so, but most likely none will be accepted. I will be told that I opened the window because I was hypnotized and told to do so and that my reasons are only rationalizations.5 If I accept this, as I am likely to do, I am admitting not that my motive for opening the window was different from that which I offered, but that I had no motive at all. And, in general, when I accept someone else's explana- tion of my action I am not accepting an explanation in terms of motives. Rather I am admitting that an adequate explanation of my action cannot be given in terms of motives, but must be given in terms of unconscious motives or causes. 5Cf. Kurt Baier, The Moral Point of View (Ithaca, 1960), pp. 163 ff.</page><page sequence="4">344 BERNARD GERT Psychological egoism is not a theory about unconscious motives or causes; it is a theory about motives. According to psychological egoism an adequate explanation of at least some human action can be given in terms of motives, and these motives will always be motives of self-interest. Psycho- logical egoism thus entails that at least some human actions can be ade- quately explained by the actor's belief that his actions are in his own self- interest. If someone were to deny that any beliefs of any sort, including beliefs about what was in one's own self-interest, ever provided an adequate explanation of any human action, then he would be denying that there were ever any motives for human action. So that anyone who main- tained that the only adequate explanation of human action was in terms of matter in motion, would be denying that there were ever any motives for human action and consequently would be holding a position incompatible with psychological egoism. II According to Hobbes' mechanical picture all voluntary motion, for example, walking or talking, is caused by some change in the vital motion, i.e., that internal motion which is vital or necessary for continued preserva- tion. Anything that affects the vital motion will affect the voluntary motion. If the vital motion is hindered the animal will automatically act in such a way as to remove the hindrance; if the vital motion is helped, the animal will act in such a way as to prolong that help. For Hobbes, nothing affects motion except some other motion, so that if the vital motion is either helped or hindered this change must come from some other motion. Since the only other motion in the body is the motion of sense, i.e., those motions of the external world which have affected a sense organ, it follows that if the vital motion is to be affected at all it must be affected by the motion of sense. There are only three possible relationships of the motions of sense to the vital motion-they can help it, hinder it, or have no effect at all.6 When the motion of sense helps the vital motion there will be minute motion toward the object causing it, an attempt to prolong the help; when the motion of sense hinders the vital motion, there will be minute motion away from the object causing the motion, an attempt to avoid the hindrance; when the motion of sense does not affect the vital motion, there will be no motion at all with regard to the object causing the motion of sense. According to Hobbes, These small beginnings of motion, within the body of man, before they appear in walking, speaking, striking, and other visible actions, are commonly called ENDEAVOUR. This endeavour, when it is toward something which causes it, is called APPETITE, or DESIRE. . . . And when the endeavour is fromward something, it is generally called AVERSION.7 Although Hobbes admits that such motions may be, and often are, insensible, he contends that this ". .. doth not hinder, but that such motions are "8, 6By ' help ', Hobbes seems to mean ' speed up '; by ' hinder ', ' slow down '. For Hobbes, greater vitality accompanies a quickening of the vital motion; lessening of vitality accompanies a slowing down of the vital motion; and a complete cessation of the vital motion results in death. 7Leviathan, ed. by Michael Oakeshott (Oxford, 1957), p. 31. 8Ibid.</page><page sequence="5">HOBBES, MECHANISM, AND EGOISM 345 i.e., that we are unaware of these motions is no argument against their existence. So far, all of Hobbes' psychology seems to be a part of physics. The vital motion is like a gyroscope, and whenever the motions of sense affect the vital motion, the body acts in such a way as best to maintain its vital motion. Hobbes may be said to have crudely anticipated the psycho- logical theory of homeostasis, that organisms act in such a way as to main- tain an internal equilibrium. There is, in this version of Hobbes' account of voluntary motion, no mention of pleasure or pain, for they, like the phantasms of sense, have no real effects. As, in sense, that which is really within us, is . . . only motion . . so, when the action of the same object is continued from the eyes, ears, and other organs to the heart, the real effect there is nothing but motion, or endeavour; which consisteth in appetite, or aversion, to or from the object moving. But the apparence, or sense of that motion, is that we either call delight, or trouble of mind.9 Motion causes motion and on the way creates appearances, but according to this version of Hobbes, these appearances have no effects at all. The motion of sense produces an appearance, for example, the sight of a pretty girl, and it also effects the vital motion, thus causing a small internal motion toward the object. This motion, known as appetite, produces an appearance of pleasure or delight and also causes voluntary motion toward the object. On this account, appearances have no causal efficacy at all; they do not even cause other appearances. Though the appearance of the pretty girl always precedes the appearance of pleasure or delight, it is not the cause of it. Rather, both are the effects of motion. This psychology of motion receives a succinct statement in the opening paragraph of Leviathan. For seeing life is but a motion of limbs, the beginning whereof is in some principal part within; why may we not say, that all automata (engines that move them- selves by springs and wheels as doth a watch) have an artificial life ? For what is the heart, but a spring; and the nerves, but so many strings; and the joints, but so many wheels, giving motion to the whole body, such as was intended by the artificer ?10 What Hobbes calls " appetite " and " aversion ", the immediate causes of our voluntary actions, are merely some internal motions of the body which we are usually unaware of. Had Hobbes not named them " appetite " and " aversion ", there would not be the slightest temptation to regard him as having provided anything other than a completely mechanical account of voluntary action, which, far from entailing psychological egoism, is actually incompatible with it. For it does not admit anything but motion as pro- viding an adequate explanation of human action. However, the above, which is a completely mechanical account of volun- tary action that leaves no room for motives, egoistic or otherwise, is not the only interpretation of Hobbes' mechanism. He sometimes seems to offer a mechanical account of the causes, not of behaviour but of desires.l1 9Leviathan, p. 33. Cf. Human Nature, pp. 31 ff. (in The English Works of Thomas Hobbes, ed. Molesworth (London, 1845), vol. IV). See also, De Corpore, ibid., Vol. I, pp. 406 f. lLeviathan, p. 5. 1See Human Nature, p. 31.</page><page sequence="6">346 BERNARD GERT When Hobbes' mechanism is interpreted in this manner, the claim that it entails egoism becomes more plausible. On this version, one ignores Hobbes' claim that appetite and aversion are merely motions; instead one takes these terms in their ordinary senses. It is still the case that the motions of sense effect the vital motion, and that a help to the vital motion causes desire, and a hindrance, aversion. However, appetite and aversion are no longer considered motions, but rather we are simply supposed to desire those things which help our vital motion and have an aversion toward those things which hinder it. For example, if the vital motion is helped by seeing a pretty girl or eating a steak, then we desire that girl or that steak. From this, it follows that whatever we desire we desire because it benefits our vital motion. This, indeed, sounds like a genuine, though unusual, form of psychological egoism. However, the statement ' whatever we desire we desire because it benefits our vital motion' is ambiguous. If interpreted as 'whatever we desire we desire because we believe it will benefit our vital motion', i.e., our motive for wanting that thing is that it will benefit our vital motion, then it is indeed a statement of psychological egoism. But the statement in question may also be taken to mean 'what we desire is determined by its effects on the vital motion', i.e., that whenever anything benefits our vital motion, this causes us to desire that thing. On this latter interpretation nothing is said about our motive for desiring the things that we do, only that there is a causal relationship between something benefiting our vital motion and our desiring that thing. Obviously only this latter interpretation can be said to follow from Hobbes' mechanical theory. And from the fact that whenever anything benefits my vital motion, this causes me to desire it, it does not follow that I desire it because I believe that it will benefit my vital motion. I may not even know that the thing in question benefits my vital motion, and hence this belief could not provide me with a motive for desiring it. Although Hobbes does maintain that our desiring a thing is caused by its benefiting our vital motion, he never claims that whatever we desire we desire because we believe it will benefit our vital motion. In fact, Hobbes never mentions the belief that our vital motion will be benefited, as a reason for desiring or doing anything. Thus Hobbes' mechanical account of the causes of desire does not entail that the motives for desire are always motives of self-interest. In fact, on this account there are no motives for desires, only causes. However, it may still be thought that this version of Hobbes' mechanism does entail psycho- logical egoism. The argument might run thus: (1) we act only to attain what we desire, (2) we desire only those things which benefit our vital motion; therefore, we act only to attain those things which benefit our vital motion. (1), we act only to attain what we desire-is sometimes taken, by itself, as a statement of psychological egoism. This is obviously incorrect. As Hobbes himself notes, we can desire to help others as well as desiring our own self-interest.l2 In this argument, this premise is taken as analytic, although this involves some stretching of the concept of desire. 12Leviathan, p. 34. See definitions of 'benevolence ' and 'good nature '.</page><page sequence="7">HOBBES, MECHANISM, AND EGOISM 347 The second premise is the crucial one, and it has already been shown to be ambiguous in an important way. (2) may mean 'whenever anything benefits our vital motion, this causes us to desire it', which is one statement of Hobbes' mechanism. But this forces us to interpret the conclusion as 'when anything benefits our vital motion, this causes us to act so as to attain it', which is not a statement of psychological egoism. Or (2) may mean 'we desire only those things which we believe will benefit our vital motion ', which is itself, and yields a conclusion that is, a statement of psychological egoism. But this is not a part of any version of Hobbes' mechanism. Thus the conclusion of the argument, if interpreted as a state- ment of psychological egoism, does not follow from Hobbes' mechanism; or, if it does, it cannot be interpreted as a statement of psychological egoism. However, the kind of thought which leads one to think he can go from Hobbes' mechanism to psychological egoism can easily be imagined. We first look upon a person as a machine responding only to those things which affect its vital motion; seeking those things which have helped or strength- ened it, and avoiding those things which have hindered or weakened it. Then, since there is a tremendous temptation to anthropomorphism when talking about machines at all, it is almost impossible not to succumb to this temptation when one is talking about that machine which man sup- posedly is. We now credit this machine with the simplest of beliefs-that what has benefited the vital motion will continue to do so-and the machine now acts, though in a somewhat limited fashion, to benefit its vital motion. Thus we have the machine acting from a motive of self-interest. Holding this view, we can even account for the fact that these machines, i.e., people, do not always act in their own interest; something which used to benefit the vital motion no longer does so. But although this account may be plausible, it obviously does not contain a valid deduction of psychological egoism from Hobbes' mechanism, for beliefs are illegitimately attributed to a machine. Further, only if the actions of the machine are explained by these beliefs, and not merely by the past effects of things on the vital motion, can one say that the machine, which no longer seems like a machine at all, is acting from motives of self-interest. In showing that psychological egoism cannot be validly deduced from Hobbes' mechanism, in either version, it was not necessary to investigate the concept of self-interest, only that of motive. By showing that having a motive entails having a belief and that neither version of Hobbes' mech- nism entails having any beliefs, it was possible to conclude that Hobbes' mechanism could not entail any theory about motives, and in particular, could not entail psychological egoism. Thus the truism that psychological egoism is about motives is sufficient to show that it cannot be validly deduced from Hobbes' mechanism. III The conclusion that psychological egoism cannot be deduced from any version of Hobbes' mechanism has some wider implications. It is not the</page><page sequence="8">348 BERNARD GERT peculiarities of Hobbes' mechanical account of human behaviour that makes it impossible to deduce psychological egoism from it. No causal account of human behaviour can entail psychological egoism. This point seems obvious enough if we restrict ourselves to causal explanations which use the con- dition of one's body to explain one's action. Whether we say that one's action is caused by some Hobbesian internal motion or offer an explanation in some more elaborate physical, chemical, biological, or physiological terms, nothing follows about motives. It does not even follow that one did or did not have a motive in doing that action. For example, one may explain my drinking two quarts of milk a day by pointing out that I am suffering from a calcium deficiency. From this nothing can be deduced about my motives for drinking the milk, not even whether I have any motives or not. I may know that I am suffering from a calcium deficiency and believe that drinking milk will remedy this condition, in which case my motive for drinking milk may be to cure my calcium deficiency. But I may not know of this deficiency, in which case this could not be my motive. But in either case-whether I know of my calcium deficiency or not-one might still offer this fact about my body as the cause of my drinking two quarts of milk a day. Thus it can easily be seen that causal explanations of actions, at least those which cite some fact about one's body, do not entail anything about motives. What is not obvious is that causal explanations which cite some fact about one's mind, e.g., explanations in terms of unconscious motives, rather than some fact about the body also do not entail anything about motives. It may sound odd to say that although such-and-such was the unconscious motive for doing that action, nothing can be deduced about the motive in doing it; but the oddity is due solely to the terminology. That is, it sounds as if unconscious motives were simply motives of which the actor is unaware. If this were the case, it would be absurd to say that from facts about motives, of which the actor is unaware, nothing follows about motives. But it would not be absurd to say that from facts about motives of which the actor is unaware, nothing follows about motives of which he is aware. However, unconscious motives are not ordinary motives of which the actor happens to be unaware. Similarly, immaterial objects are not ordinary objects which happen to be immaterial, and unfelt pain is not ordinary pain that happens to be unfelt. Just as it is part of the concept of pain that the person who is in pain is aware of it, so it is part of the concept of motive that the person who has that motive is aware of it. Thus taking the phrase 'unconscious motive' as if it meant simply an ordinary motive of which we happen to be uncon- scious, would be as wrong as taking the phrase 'unfelt pain' as if it meant simply an ordinary pain which no one happens to feel. In the case of both 'unconscious motives' and 'unfelt pains' what has happened is that an essential feature of the ordinary concept has been dropped while less central features have been retained and a new concept, super- ficially related to the old one, has been developed. Thus in the case of</page><page sequence="9">HOBBES, MECHANISM, AND EGOISM 349 unfelt pain, we note that the physiological symptoms of pain are all present, including even the neurological disturbance, and yet an essential feature of the ordinary concept of pain is absent, namely the pain is not felt. It may be quite natural in some circumstances to call this combination of phenomena "unfelt pain ", yet this terminology is dangerous as it makes it sound as if being felt were not an essential part of the concept of pain. Whereas what we are really doing is saying that we now have a group of phenomena present which usually occur only with pain but which now occur without it. Likewise, in the case of " unconscious motives" we note that many of the features of ordinary motives are present and yet that an essential feature is absent, namely the person does not acknowledge that belief as his reason for doing the action. It is quite natural in some circum- stances to call this combination of phenomena " unconscious motives ", but this suffers from a danger similar to the one cited above, i.e., it sounds as if regarding a certain belief as your reason for doing an action is not an essential part of the concept of motive. Whereas what we are really doing is saying that there are a combination of features which resemble the com- bination of features that accompany motives, except that here the person to whom the motive is attributed does not acknowledge it. That unconscious motives are not ordinary motives of which we are unaware, but are a quite distinct sort of thing, is not without consequences. Motives can be used as explanations only of voluntary actions; unconscious motives may be invoked to explain not only involuntary actions such as stuttering, but also such things as headaches. Whether or not we call un- conscious motives causes, or put them in a category by themselves, it is clear that they are not ordinary motives. It should now also be clear that no explanation of human action in terms of unconscious motives can entail anything about the motives for that action. No matter what unconscious motive is cited as explaining my action it does not follow that I will regard any particular belief as my reason for doing that action. Thus, even if one regarded Hobbes' mechanism as providing unconscious motives for action, i.e., as meaning that though we were not aware of it the belief that a thing would benefit our vital motion was the cause of our seeking that thing (an unwarranted interpretation), it would still not entail psychological egoism. Thus not only can psychological egoism not be deduced from Hobbes' mechanical account of human nature, but also there is no other possible causal explanation of human action from which it can be. This includes theories about unconscious motives. For none of these causal accounts entails that the person, whose action is being explained, is even aware of any of the facts used in the explanation. Whereas psychological egoism is a theory about motives, and thus entails that the person whose actions are being explained has a belief which he regards as explaining his action.
