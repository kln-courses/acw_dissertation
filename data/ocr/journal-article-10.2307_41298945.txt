<plain_text><page sequence="1">William McNeilPs Ecological Mythhistory: Toward an Ambiguous Future Paul Costello History, particularly world history, is founded on a sense of meaning in the present conditioned by our anticipation of the future. It might be said that our future determines our past; in many cases prophecy precedes and justifies as well as completes our histories. World historians of the first half of the century, obsessed with the "decline of the West" after the ordeal of the First World War, focused their speculations on the rise and fall of independent civilizations. After H.G. Wells' explorations of modern threats to progress and Oswald Spengler's pessimistic forecasts concerning Western Civilization, other cyclical theorists, from Arnold Toynbee and Pitirim Sorokin to Christopher Dawson and Lewis Mumford, wrote their histories to demonstrate how a phoenix could rise from the ashes of the West and, through a "transformation of man," produce a new age of cultural and even religious world unity. The works of William H. McNeill, on the other hand, exemplify a neoprogressive stance that has marked the end of the dominance of the cyclical tradition; our histories are now open ended. Even so McNeill remains within the prophetic tradition; his "mythhislory" gives expression to his hopes and fears for the future of the West and in particular his goal for world ecumenical unity.

McNeill has done much to overturn some of the major formulations of Toynbee, his mentor, even as he has become a recognized leader in the field of world history. McNeilFs works have been, on the whole, gratefully received by his professional colleagues, who have respected McNeilFs erudition and are, after the metaphysical and millenarian projects of his predecessors, relieved by his discourse restricted to "this worldly" movements of power and peoples. Since 1963 McNeill has been perhaps the most powerful voice in promoting the idea of world history as a means to a global consciousness and as an antidote to the catastrophic potentials inherent in current militarism, the increasing closure of a united disease pool, and xenophobic nationalism. In resolving many of the contradictions of his predecessors, McNeill has produced a new macrohistorical model of ecological history that may act as a fulcrum for a new generation of world historians. McNeilPs works have acted to clear the air of metaphysical obscurantism, cyclical determinism, and the organicism of self-contained civilizations that pursue predictable life courses. He has rejected the Utopian aspirations of his predecessors who formulated speculative ideal futures or returns to a mythical cohesion in the past in response to their sense of the tragedy of modernism. McNeill has dismissed naively tragic and transcendentally expectant views of history and maintained a qualified optimism. He has asserted that creative growth in technology and social management has increased human choice, material well-being, artistic expression, and the richness and variety of communications. While recognizing the multivalent ambiguity of modernism, especially in the tension between individual freedom and managerial order, McNeill has emphasized a cumulative pattern of interaction in world history that encompasses the complex strains of technological and ecological evolution and posits a fulfillment of the growth of humanity in our increasingly unified world order. McNeilPs The Rise of the West (1963), though profoundly influenced by Toynbee and other world historians, made a clean sweep of Utopian faith</page><page sequence="3">William McNeilVs Ecological Mythhistary 101 and Augustinián parallels. Instead of cyclical patterns of rise and fall, which in Toynbee and Sorokin correspond to periods of creative mysticism and sinful degeneracy, McNeill traced a global experience of technological transfer, and social, political, and religious growth broken intermittently by ecological catastrophes and man-made disasters. According to McNeill, a cumulative pattern of historical growth predominates and survives the passage of peoples and empires; it has increased the complexity and breadth of human life even with the psychological dislocations and apocalyptic potential it bears. The very title of The Rise of the West indicates McNeilFs ambitious goals: (1) to overturn the predominant world historical perspectives of the twentieth century and (2) to demonstrate the continuity of world history as a process leading to global unity and Western dominance. The Rise of the West, then, does not describe a stage in a closed Western cycle leading to inevitable dissolution. It portrays a world historical fulfillment, a union of the contributions of past ages and peoples of the ecumene. The title also underlines McNeilFs sense that modern world civilization in its most current manifestation is a Western synthesis. Further, it expresses McNeilPs hope that the Western liberal ideals of freedom, equality, self-determination of peoples, and the values embodied in the charter of the United Nations will infuse and moderate the movement toward world integration. Of the macrohistorians of our century McNeill is among the most "lough-minded" in William James' sense of the term, the most scientific in his use of models, the most detached, clinical, and dispassionate. Yet he claims that modern epistemology has undone any hope of finding absolute historical truth in either microhistorical analyses or macrohistorical assessments. He argues instead for a "mythhistory" where historians provide a "sense of the past," a broad, meaningful interpretation as a basis for action. In this he follows his early mentor Carl Becker: historical study contributes to shaping a "climate of opinion" and remains a constant process adapting itself to the needs of each generation. McNeill moderates his relativism with the belief that truth emerges in the open marketplace of ideas. He is a pragmatist of the liberal faith. Taken as a whole the study of world history has a progressive character as 2. William H. McNeill, The Rise of lhe West; A History of the Human Community (Chicago, 1963). 3. William H.

McNeill called Becker's Modern History his early "gospel," p. 97.</page><page sequence="4">102 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques models evolve to include broader categories of material and more inclusive perspectives. The measure of truth in any area of study depends upon its historical success, evolutionary adaptability and usefulness. McNeill also claims that generalization remains inevitable even in the most specific of studies, and that the historian bears a duty to coordinate a useful past in the face of present world contingencies. Historians, whether they like it or not, act as mythhistorians who provide idealional grounding through generalization for a climate of opinion. In McNeilPs work this task has the weight of a moral imperative; to ignore current macrohistorical dilemmas in fragmentary analysis of discrete shards of the past is a "trahison des clercs." When McNeill came upon Toynbee's first three volumes of A Study of History in 1939 he was fully prepared to adopt their metahistorical orientation. As Toynbee had read Thucydides before World War One and been inspired by the parallel between fifth-century Greece and the early twentieth century, McNeill had read Thucydides in graduate school at Chicago, wrote a masters thesis on Herodotus and Thucydides, and felt the "remarkable echo between the ancient Greek political patterns and those of my own day." Like Toynbee, McNeill was sufficiently moved by this sense of recurrence to assign himself the task of writing a book that would explore the cyclical parallels between ancient Greek and modern European history.4 Upon reading Toynbee, however, McNeill raised his sights; he now intended to embrace the history of all civilizations. By his own account, reading Toynbee "transported" McNeill with "rapture"; "for awhile his thoughts were my thoughts." Toynbee had accomplished McNeilFs projected task with "dazzling virtuosity." McNeill later admitted that he was moved to the point of making a "leap of faith" in accepting Toynbee's world view~"even though I half recognized its kinship to the other leap toward Christian faith which I boggled at making."6 McNeill also acknowledged that given his Calvinist background he had a deep-seated affinity for the idea of predestination, for a sense of destiny that transcended human consciousness and free will, where freedom 4.

McNeilPs work would also show the influence of cultural anthropology. As an undergraduate at Chicago McNeill studied under Robert Redfield, who taught his theory of the "transformation of man." Redfield posited the revolutionary shift from primitive to civilized society through the convergent processes of urbanization and the development of agriculture. His idea of civilization as the "antithesis of folk society" may have conditioned McNeill to accept (at least in the short term) Toynbee's case-oriented approach to the independent "outbreaks" of the first civilizations.8 Redfield also emphasized the unraveling of the cohesive order of primitive society- a breakdown of rules and beliefs which countered the advantages of civilization. With this unraveling came new psychological burdens of "dreadful freedom," when decisions formerly prescribed by established custom had to be made through isolated personal judgments. McNeill has accordingly retained throughout his work a sensitivity to the ambiguity of a progressive advancement both hopefully creative and painfully disruptive.9 McNeill has maintained that the shift from the Neolithic age to civilization led to a period of destabilization lasting until the civilized ecumenical balance attained just before the coming of Christ. McNeilFs world history synthesizes two major strands of macrohistorical theory: the Spenglerian and Toynbeean tradition of studying civilizations 7. McNeill, Mythhistory^ p. 181. In 1950, after publishing books on Greece, finishing his Cornell doctorate, and teaching at Chicago, McNeill moved to London on an invitation to work at Chatham House on Toynbee's Survey of International Affairs, The two met daily and discussed Toynbee's work on the final volumes of lhe Study. During this time McNeill wrote his first work of world historical scope, America, Britain and Russia (1953), a study of the diplomacy among the three Allied superpowers from 1941 to 1946. 8. McNeill, Mythhislory, p. 183. Robert Redfield, The Primitive World and Ils Transformations (Ithaca, 1953), p. 22. 9. McNeill, correspondence with the author (15 December 1989). In his recent article, "Control and Catastrophe in Human Affairs," Daedalus 118 (1989), p. 11, McNeill takes Redfield's view a step further, asserting that every gain in coordination and efficiency is offset by an increased vulnerability. A good example of McNeilPs view on the ambiguous path of progress is found in his "Dilemmas of Modernization," Massachusetts Review 9 (1968), p. 141. He argues that prosperity and urbanization in Greece since World War Two have led to a psychological break with traditional peasant culture, amoralism and a pervasive materialism.

Amongst the latter and aside from Redfield, McNeill read Alfred Kroeber, and Ralph Linton. Linton held that the "so-called rise and fall of civilizations.. .is marginal in certain respects [and] actually only affected the surface of culture." These superficial changes overlay a cumulative cultural matrix inherited in time and transferred to new peoples on the periphery. In The Tree of Culture (1955) Linton analyzed this matrix as a worldwide process of cultural diffusion which served as an underlying unity (like the trunk of a tree) supporting peripheral differentiation. Kroeber's Configurations of Cultural Growth (1944) broke with Spengler and Toynbee on three major points: first, that all civilizations respond to a "master pattern" of cultural development; second, that all civilizations followed essentially parallel stages; and third, that civilizations ultimately die. With Past and Future}* McNeill undertook the task of writing his own world history. As he later put it: "I proposed to turn Spengler and Toynbee on their heads, as Marx claimed to have done with Hegel." He felt that Toynbee and Spengler had erred in treating civilizations as independent entities and emphasizing the internal rhythms of particular civilizations, thereby minimizing the role of external influences. Diffusion, the adoption from other societies of technologies, skills, customs, and social arrangements perceived as useful or empowering, represented the critical factor in world historical change.16 In place of Toynbee's cycles of independent civilizations McNeill posited the idea of challenge and response 11.

In his paradigm, cultural interaction, rather than any internal cyclical dynamism, provided the "major motive power" for historical change. Diffusion, however, does not always occur under conditions of free choice; in many cases, according to McNeill, cultural borrowing became an urgent requirement for conquered populations and societies confronted by external threats. McNeill has described diffusion as subject to a "Rule of Compound Interest," wherein societies that have accepted important innovations are in turn stimulated to invention. He agrees with Alfred Kroeber's idea of "constellations" of invention which cluster historically in time and space. With the rise of civilizations, emergent metropolitan centers become something other than open receptors of cultural influences from equally semibarbarous neighbors or other nascent civilizational centers. They instead become radiant foci which diffuse their borrowings, and the innovations stimulated by these borrowings, to their peripheries. Centers eventually form "cultural slopes" through their barbaric fringes and toward primitive frontiers beyond. With the rise of multiple centers, diffusion acquires a complex topography as intersecting peaks and slopes provide watersheds of cultural growth. The success of diffusion is critical for a center's viability as each must sustain its growth and, for epidemiological and demographic reasons, its very existence by drawing on its surrounding rural populations and converting them into its citizens.18 For McNeill, diffusion leads to a punctuated equilibrium between civilization and its peripheral hinterlands, a dynamic he has explored most extensively in the relations between steppe-dwelling nomads and civilized, agricultural peoples who must periodically convert the barbarians or invent and adopt technologies which can hold them at bay. McNeill applies the challenge and response paradigm with more consistency and balance than any other world historian. His ecological analysis allows him to examine an exceedingly complex variety of man-made and ecological crises as cultural stimuli. In contrast to Toynbee, who most often found these stimuli in the origin and growth stages of 17. William H. McNeill, Vu Shape of European History (New York, 1974), pp. 37-39. 18. William H.

Challenges including disease fluctuations, agricultural technology, zoolechnical advances lead to changes in food supplies, human habitat, and environmental control. McNeilFs macrohistory is, then, a study of the challenges of survival presented by humanity's evolving relationship with its environment and in the punctuated equilibrium of struggle between groups. The stimulus of political/military competition provides a major eco-historical pattern in McNeilFs history. This is clearly the case in his view of the "rise of the West" after 1000 A.D.; variety, instability, and the lack of a hegemonic center promoted European economic growth, while chronic warfare, endemic to Europe's nascent mullinationalism, proved to be a "powerful mainspring" of the West's vitality. Past and Future anticipated issues later raised in The Rise of the West. McNeill claimed, in contrast to Toynbee's emphasis upon the independence of the first civilizations, that "the history of civilized mankind can be considered as a product of the progressive breakdown of.. .isolation." Increased interaction followed from four epochs of increased human mobility and contact.21 Each point of transition- from pedestrian to equestrian movement (2000 B.C.), from land transport dominated by the steppe frontiers to oceanic travel (fifteenth century A.D.), and finally to the rise of mechanical transportation with the Industrial Revolution-occurred as a crisis requiring resolution and a new ecumenical equilibrium. In 1954 McNeill saw the modern period as a "horizon point," an era of crisis where rapid innovation had made society "everywhere uncertain, unstable, and uncomfortable," and where nations and nationalism, foundations of secular psychological cohesion, had fallen into eclipse, leaving a "pervasive unease" and a "haunting sense of the futility of human life." McNeill also held a perspective on the mechanization of the social order similar to Lewis Mumford's worldview. The professional 20. McNeill, The Rise, p. 597.

McNeill echoed Mumford and Max Weber to the effect that as men transform "themselves, their fellows and the physical environment in conformity to rational calculation," the free citizen becomes "no more than a replaceable part in a great machine."24 In turning to the future McNeill outlined ecological imperatives for the establishment of an equilibrium necessary for the species' preservation. Reason demanded an armed world authority. A central power that united the world militarily and bureaucratically provided "the only rational way" to avert the catastrophe of international war. In 1954 McNeill expected a third world war with global hegemony going to the victor.25 He believed that in the absence of war the West would lead in the integration process. Indeed, McNeill argued that Americans should establish as their guiding vision the idea of the world state, an heroic project requiring great sacrifice. It was this missionary vision of world union that McNeill elaborated throughout the next nine years as he wrote The Rise of the West. By this time McNeill believed that the world was one from day one. The Rise of the West charts a world history where civilizations act not as anthropomorphic beings following their destinies, but as representatives of a single, relatively unified process of growth and integration which has culminated with the disequilibrium of the present. In this study of civilization and diffusion, McNeill tried to identify for any given age the center point of ecumenical development.27 McNeill affirmed the idea of a linear, progressive, and secular history for humanity against Spengler's view of the dead ends of separate civilizational cycles and Toynbee's movement of religious progress that survives and transcends the fates of particular civilizations. Not surprisingly, when he turned to examine the roots of modern "progress," McNeill perceived the Renaissance and Enlightenment rather differently from the cyclical theorists. Sorokin, for example, saw in the Renaissance a rising "sensate" society which had undermined and disrupted the organic unity of the Middle Ages and foreshadowed a downturn in the 24.

McNeill, in contrast, traced his intellectual roots to the secularizing rationalism of Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Smith, Mallhus and Marx.28 He accordingly described the rise of the West's military and economic power as paralleled by a growth in intellectual power. McNeill perceived the breakdown of religious dogma in a positive light; the medieval framework's disintegration presented people with a new challenge. Although psychologically unsettling, freedom of thought stimulated new techniques and ideas. McNeill accordingly isolated two central features of modernism: the growth of human control over inanimate matter, and a readiness to tinker with social institutions and customs. Taken together they represented "the progress of human reason applied to man.' With this progress came the conscious management of industry, technology, finance, and a society punctuated by the French Revolution's impetus toward political centralization, Bismarck's managerial machine, and the culminating "war machines" produced by the armed conflicts of the twentieth century.30 McNeilPs speculations on the ambiguous impact of these patterns in the future dominate the last sections of The Rise of the West, McNeill argued that the pattern of the extension of sovereignties which culminates with the existence of two superpowers and their respective spheres of influence led to the expectation of a "single world sovereignly," either through war or by the convergence of American and Soviet societies. McNeill also examined the ominous process by which wartime coordination of production and social order continued into peacetime. He warned that the elites of this order might be swayed by "bureaucratic self interest" to establish "elaborate rules and precedents" designed to hinder disruptive scientific initiatives and social change. 28.

McNeill, The Rise, pp. 875-876. In his later work on The Human Condition, p. 72, McNeill retained this view of the "military industrial machine" as a dominant force in world society: "It is easy to imagine a time not for in the future when existing public and private bureaucracies might come together into a self-perpetuating structure aimed first and foremost at keeping things as nearly stable as possible by guarding the privileges and power of existing managerial elites around the globe."</page><page sequence="11">William McNeiWs Ecological MythhisUny 109 In his later works McNeill turned to examining history by means of an ecological model. In 1976, for example, he produced his first major work in world epidemiological history, Plagues and Peoples.33 The work investigated "microparasitism," the relationship between human beings and parasites. As such, it studied the history of human infections and their impact upon demographic patterns, the rise and fall of states and empires, and the intellectual and religious aspirations of various societies. In 1972 Alfred Crosby had explored the complex exchange of disease patterns with the European discovery of America, a mutual transfer that led to the greatest epidemics of all time in the New World from European smallpox, measles and other infections. Meanwhile, the movement of food crops to Europe helped to support a population explosion that coincided with the growth of European hegemony and the subsequent industrial revolution. McNeill applied this approach to the world as a whole and postulated what Crosby later called "McNeilPs Law," that disease works with conquest and that microparasitism allies with expanding civilized centers whose endemisms frequently devastate peripheral peoples. The decimations brought to the Americas by the complex endemism of a united Eurasian disease pool represented an extremely radical instance of a process begun in the first civilized centers.35 In Plagues and Peoples McNeill tentatively charted a world epidemiological history. Endemism has acted not only as a weapon in new contacts with rural and isolated populations where the diseases of civilization killed young and old alike, but also contributed to demoralization, economic breakdown, and loss of faith in protective gods and totems. These in turn aided the political and cultural expansion of the civilized center. Civilizations in history frequently "digested" their primitive peripheries, having "masticated" them with war and disease.36 History, from an epidemiological standpoint, is the story of mutual adaptations of disease endemisms and the growth of host populations. By 500 B.C. four relatively independent disease pools had coalesced in Eurasia: 33. McNeill, Plagues and Peoples, pp. 20-22. 34. Alfred W.

In The Rise of the West McNeill had pointed out the interconnection of these cultural centers in the period between 500 B.C. and 200 A.D., a period of the "closure of the Eurasian ecumene." In 128 B.C. Chinese diplomatic contacts extended as far as the Oxus and Jaxartes; by 101 B.C. Chinese armies had followed these contacts from oasis to oasis to open the Silk Road across the southern Eurasian steppe extending from China through the Kushan and Parthian Empires as far as the Levant and the Roman Empire. In addition, Roman maritime expansion reached Indian ports even as China linked itself to the Subcontinent by sea.37 The resulting closure of the ecumene led to a continent-wide infectious chain as the Old World disease pools came into mutual contact. Epidemic transfers swept through the populations leading to disastrous die-offs on the relatively isolated ends of the infectious chain- Han China and the Roman Empire.38 McNeill employed natural history to explain the fall of the two empires. He thereby provided an alternative to the cyclycists' biological metaphor of life cycles and the suggestions of moral decay arising from the loss of spiritual cohesion. In an extension of the epidemiological metaphor McNeill employed the term macroparasitism to describe the relationship between human parasites and their host societies. For example, he argued, just as the total destruction of a host population does not serve a bacteria, human macroparasites soon discover that genocidal conquest and total seizure of the food supply proves counterproductive. They consequently adopt modes of exploitation that allow "endemic" relations such as imperial conquest involving tribute or taxation; this provides continuous health for the host population while maximizing the durability and spread of macroparasitical "infection." Surpluses grown to satisfy conquerors and to prevent their rapacity act as antibodies, and the successful government of a conqueror immunizes, through military defence, against further short-term epidemics of conquest, plunder and rapine.39 Just as populations need to reach a threshold to maintain microparasitic endemism, so a critical size allows support of a conquering population. To take one example, a civilization dominated by a warrior caste then becomes analogous to a population with 37. McNeill, The Rise of lhe West, pp. 322-346. McNeill, Plagues and Peoples, p. 111. 38.

In The Pursuit of Power (1982), McNeill described the emergence of increasingly efficient macroparasites locked in a Darwinian struggle leading to ever-larger hegemonies and the present era of Western dominance. As twin to Plagues and Peoples, the book represents another tour de force; at the same time it is marked by ambivalence. McNeill charted a modern shift away from the Western "aberration" of a free-market economy, a phenomenon dating from the fifteenth century, and toward the re- emergence of "bureaucratic command structures. A reversion to the historical norm, this shift largely followed from a long-term arms race wherein the bureaucracy became a dynamic force in pursuing invention and promoting "command technology.' ************ According to McNeill world government remains necessary. Ever ambivalent, however, McNeill holds a Weberian view of the "iron cage" of bureaucracy and a rationalized social order. A world state, dominated by elites and interlocking, managerial structures may leave no room for questions of direction or meaning. As he noted in his concluding remarks in The Rise of the West, "administrative routine may make rational definition of the goals of human striving entirely superfluous.' McNeill also expressed the hope that people might yet prove refractory to bureaucratic machinations; he particularly feared bureaucracy's potential, through bio- engineering, to produce a population of subhuman toilers and superhuman leaders, "each as specialized in function and various in type as the social 40.

In a recent article entitled, "Control and Catastrophe in Human Affairs," McNeill reverted to the Wellsian theme of our "race between intelligence and catastrophe." He posited a law of the "Conservation of Catastrophe," claiming that each civilized adaptation raised the potential for catastrophe given the possibility for mutual destruction and ecological disaster. In the modern period two developments have led to major disequilibrium. McNeill takes a neo-Malthusian view that population growth threatens the long-term stability of the species. In addition, the open communication of disease within the vast population pool makes for situations inviting disaster and demands early and systematic response to new infections.48 From an ecological/epidemiological perspective, McNeill remains far from sanguine in his appraisal of our modern struggle with death. He not only believes that humanity's progress has raised the stakes, but that sharp ecological fluctuations will continue to occur as they have in the past.49 McNeilPs mythhistory is not without its contradictions. His clinical perspective on historical patterns of epidemiology, technology transfer, the history of ideas, and religious development is essentially Darwinian. In the struggle for existence "microparasitical" relations of endemism maximize the survival of pest and host; rationalized "macroparasitical" arrangements between elites and conquered populations bring prosperity to both host and parasites and thereby provide adaptive success.

The historical patterns described by McNeill are the products of human adaptation leading, in Spencer's words, to "the survival of the fittest." In the end McNeill charts the blindly devastating influence of microparasitism, describes the technological and organizational imperatives of macroparasitism, and treats the conditioning effects of evolving "climates of opinion" as primarily reflections of these underlying and compelling forces. The liberal postulates inherent in McNeilPs goals are undermined by his sweeping generalizations about climates of opinion which often leave the question of leadership, creativity, and inspiration aside. In his scheme of history diffusion frequently assumes the weight of a near-universal explanation that discounts the role of individual creativity. Further, McNeilPs ambiguous conclusions on the future- e.g., his expectation of a world government directed by potentially self-interested social managers-conflict with his liberal hopes. In the end McNeilPs work begs the question: Can an ecological view of world history preserve a central role for free will and individual action? Can the history of humanity at the species level be more than a series of power struggles that end with the hegemony of the strongest? McNeill has attributed the deterministic elements in his work at least in part to a Calvinist legacy which holds that "massive largely unconscious processes... operated at a level below deliberate political-military planning and action." Herein McNeilPs work parallels that of Fernand Braudel with its emphasis upon long-term economic and ecological processes which provide the deep structures upon which the epiphenomenon of "battles and kings" take place. Not surprisingly, McNeill sees Braudel as a "kindred spirit" and he has alluded to the latter's The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II as a powerful parallel to his own work. Although the two historians share a common inspiration in the work of Marc Bloch and the Annales school, McNeill nevertheless resists what he sees as BraudePs tendency to reduce history to economic and market 50.

On the other hand, these responses occur within a socio-psychological framework or, from a history of mentalities perspective, in conjunction with collective mind sets which necessarily limit and condition the range of response. An analysis of McNeilPs treatment of religion in history makes the point. He views religious phenomena as belief systems or "climates of opinion" which allow positive adaptation to material and social conditions. Examined from an ecological point of view, religions are judged for their contribution to human adaptability and survival. During the first Eurasian ecumenical union, for example, the Axial religions originated among marginal "excluded elites" and then garnered widespread support because they "fitted the needs, the feelings and the life position of the majority of civilized humankind." "Universalist" and open to all ethnic groups, the Axial religions inculcated rules and prescriptions for dealing with strangers at a time when the ecumene made for increasing contacts with diverse peoples. In addition, these religions contained ideals of heavenly compensation for worldly troubles, from plagues to invasions, and thus promoted an adaptive forbearance in the face of adversity. According to McNeill, these religious traditions smoothed contacts between people, facilitated coexistence and thus supplied the foundations of the "commercial transformation of human society."54 The Axial "half sisters" of Christianity, Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism, acted as adaptations to the new conditions of impersonality and the consequent human indifference that existed in urban centers.55 Religion has thus played an ecological 51.

In a word, McNeill treats religion as a conditioned response to ecological imperatives with a social and psychological use-value rather than as a free aspiration, much less a providential contact. He also believes that modern society may require religious grounding as an adaptation to rapid social change. His view is essentially Voltairean: exhibiting no religious belief, he calls for a plurality of vibrant faiths as "requisite for the maintenance of the stability of civilized society."56 In his later work McNeill holds to a rather Freudian view of religion as an adaptive delusion which accommodates individuals to the inevitably repressive features of any civilized order. In a self-critical review of The Rise of the West twenty-five years after its publication McNeill acknowledged that the book risked presenting history from the standpoint of the winners. Alluding to U.S. leadership of the West at the height of the Cold War, McNeill recognized that The Rise might be perceived as "a rationalization of American hegemony, retrojecting the situation of post World War Two decades upon the whole of the world's past by claiming that analogous patterns of cultural dominance and diffusion had existed always."57 From the perspective of McNeilFs paradigm, it becomes arguable that Western world dominance and the legacy of colonial and economic imperialism represent the inevitable product of natural competition. Western macroparasitical dominance becomes an extension of deep and universal historical processes. McNeilPs Darwinian model of competition lends itself to providing an ideological sanction to American power on a world scale. On the other hand, McNeilFs purpose has been less to justify a particular national or cultural hegemony than to recognize the multi valence of mutual diffusions among 56. McNeill, "Religion," pp. 31-32. In 1954 he held that the West should strive to become a "liberal cooperative, civilized world order in which all mankind could find a spiritual as well as a physical home."

For McNeill modernity represents the emergence of a global civilization that will overcome nationalism and establish a postnational identity. Despite his Western ethnocentrism, McNeill has transcended the cyclical theories of his predecessors and advanced the cause for a global perspective. In any event McNeill provides no Utopian solutions. He recognizes the inevitability of repressions, even their growth, with the rise of bureaucratic organization in an increasingly complex and unified world. His limited hope rests in a program of moral education. McNeilFs vision of world history emphasizes the unity of mankind and its potential for good or evil; education provides a grounding for a postnational sense of identity, a warning drawn from the study of past mistakes and a call to action in the face of future challenges.58 By revealing the interconnections between past civilizations and shedding light on the contributions and distinctive pathways of non-Western cultural traditions, McNeill educates his readers to think in terms of ecumenical unity. For example, in demonstrating that polyethnic empires have represented the historical norm of civilized organization he attempts to support modern tendencies leading to increased polyethnicily. Ecumenical history, seen in this light, becomes a secular mission, a conscious means of "preparing readers for more successful membership in a world system..." McNeilPs ambivalence receives rather dramatic expression in his sympathetic treatment of Lord Acton's failed struggle to write The History of Liberty, Indeed, McNeill confronts the same dilemma he ascribes to Acton. According to McNeill, Acton's whiggish project to write a history on the rise of liberty and virtue was ultimately derailed by evidence indicating 58. In an answer to Solzhenilsyn's disparaging view of Western secular culture, McNeill claimed that after the decline of religious views following the Enlightenment, nationalism served as the basis for psychological cohesion. The present age required an equivalent identity shift based upon humanity as a whole. William H. McNeill, "The Decline of the West," Sobhenitsyn at Harvard, ed.

McNeill in fact views the works of twentieth-century cyclical theorists as attempts to respond to the dethronement of Whig history by the catastrophe of World War One. In his eyes these attempts have failed, for like most modern historians he remains skeptical about any final sense of the meaning and direction of history. As a result, McNeill has undertaken the task of salvaging what can be rescued from Whig progressivem in an age whose central metaphor is ecological and whose social order is increasingly centralized and bureaucratic. McNeilFs partial success in reviving a progressive historical model has not resolved the conundrum that defeated Acton, but has retained it as a key to understanding the fundamental ambiguity of modernity. Walter A. McDougall has aptly characterized McNeilPs stand as one of "uncomfortable liberalism." ^ McNeill argues that after World War One it makes no sense to speak of European history as the rise of liberty; we must therefore create a new mythhistory with an ecological and global vision to make the world intelligible. When McNeill charts the progress of the mechanization of man, enforced diffusion, micro- and macroparasitism, he often presents these historical patterns as underlying, determinative structures which challenge liberal hopes for free will. He claims that "the ideal of freedom... stands and has always stood in persistent conflict with experience." Freedom therefore remains relative and operates within a material context and an adaptive system of belief. Seen in the light of Redfield's view of primitive cohesion and its breakdown with the onset of civilization, the latter's rules and social order provide "real liberation," but one which entails a new context demanding certain 62.

McNeilPs works aim to supply boundaries for a postmodern adaptation to the ambiguous freedom of a world state and a unified bureaucratic complex. Given McNeilFs perspective on the utility of religion as an adaptation to the ecological necessities of various civilizational orders, his "Mythhistory" provides a secular and functional equivalent to a religious world view. It provides the means for a community's adaptation to the demands of the future by justifying the inevitable emergence of a new world order with its inevitably repressive features. McNeill does not provide a simplistic formula that overcomes the complex duality of freedom versus determinism or draw a firm line between ecological imperatives and individual free choice. Nor does he affirm his secular faith as the only correct adaptation to a postnational order. McNeill has attempted the more difficult task of demonstrating various ecological patterns in history expressive of human actions and interacting balances that respond to each other and to environmental changes. McNeill argues that: The most changeable and therefore the most disturbing element in any ecological situation is human purposes: for as they alter and direct human action, sometimes mass action, the differences wrought in ecological systems becomes enormous... We are surely free to do things differently; and in so doing change patterns and deflect processes into new paths, but we never entirely prevail... Elsewhere McNeill asserts that "in human society... belief matters most," and that the myths we employ to make sense of life and guide our action are "often self-validating."*8 Perhaps more than any other world historian in our century, McNeill emphasizes the breakpoints of history: catastrophic interruptions through microparasitic or macroparasitic epidemics or environmental changes. Each human advance has increased the potential for ecological disaster. And yet, unlike most world historians of our century, including Spengler, Sorokin, Dawson and Toynbee, he eschews eschalology and remains optimistic about 67.

McNeill, The Rise, p. 876.</page><page sequence="21">William McNeilVs Ecological Mythhistary 119 the ability of civilization to adjust to the future. McNeill believes that despite the apocalyptic dangers in the competitive pursuit of power and the Ellul-like imperatives inherent in technological development, our era represents an unprecedented golden age. While investigating patterns in world history McNeill has greatly influenced scholarly discourse. As a result, nascent ecological perspectives seem likely to dominate the efforts of world historians into the new century. Global studies of "progressive" patterns of environmental management, disease control, racial and ethnic integration, and the growth of sovereignties will continue to serve as focal points of study. Gaps in McNeilFs ecological paradigm, particularly in the systematic evaluation of land and water use, species loss, pollution, and consumptive waste, will presumably be filled by others as these areas become vital concerns for survival. In McNeill's world history, human intelligence has thus far prevailed. A great and ennobling adventure into the unknown, humanity's future holds the possibilities of increased power and self discovery. At the same time McNeill describes a fundamental ambiguity in our present adaptations; our very successes reinforce the "iron cage" of rationalized order and call into question our tenuous ecological equilibrium. McNeill's program of education for world citizenship accordingly gives expression to a limited fatalism. Education, according to McNeill, necessarily must constrict the realm of human freedom and raise the potential for ecological catastrophe to meet the demands of a future global community. In contrast to his cyclicalist predecessors, McNeill does not present us with a saving vision that can resolve the contradictions of modern history nor does he foresee inevitable decline and collapse. Instead, he argues that we must educate to adapt and meet the challenges of progress and change; he remains optimistic that among the apocalyptic dangers confronting us, including the possibility of our dehumanization, humanity may yet advance and somehow prevail. 69. McNeill, "Control and Catastrophe," p. 12. He frankly admits that "I tend to discount... eschatological views, probably more for temperamental than for intellectual reasons."</page></plain_text>
