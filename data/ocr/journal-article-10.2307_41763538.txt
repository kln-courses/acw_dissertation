The Aztecs have arrived at the Guggenheim Museum in New York and American audi- ences are rediscovering the Aztec culture's disarming beauty, its graceful blend of cruelty and creativity . One of the most striking and seldom-discussed aspects of Aztec culture is its moral transparency , the outward sin- cerity with which the Aztecs regarded exchange as a means of subjugation and combat Th√ßy understood trade and war to be inseparable, even comple- mentary forms of imperialism. Foreigners were dominated not through war or trade alone but through their deadly combina- tion. Establishing ties with dis- tant lands, exotic peoples, and tempting whole territories with reciprocal tribute, the Aztecs banked on the truism that the promise of prosperity finds no resistance. Once established, exchange grew increasingly asymmetrical. Charges of extortion or entreaties for fair- ness were answered with public humiliation or death. Tribute payments were always precious. In the ceremory of Toxcatl, the most prized warrior of a sub- jugated population was put to death, his heart extracted and his skin flayed by Aztec priests. As outlying populations were introduced to the excesses of Aztec life, they were civilized, increasingly emeshed in the culture's aggressive morality, actively shaped into Aztec sub- jects through an imposed rela- tionship to the general economy of Tenochtitlan. On tribute days, the form of the city pro- vided a tableau for the produc- tion of Aztec morality. Wealth flowed on canoes and along narrow land bridges, across the great lake and into the city center, to the walled ceremonial precinct of the Templo Mayor, where priestly arithmetic often led to fatal calculations. Explicit techniques - pre- emptive economic strikes founded on material shock and awe - were institutionalized through theocratic rule and ritual violence. The result was wealth and power, anxiety and paranoia. In 1$18, Tenochtitlan was the vortex of the largest empire in the Americas ; by 152O it was all but gone. - John May 54</page></plain_text>
