<plain_text><page sequence="1">Realism and Behaviourism by Alan Weir * Summary Many contemporary philosophers of language believe that realist metaphysics and a beha- viouristic approach to language are incompatible, debate centring on which is to be given up. In this paper I argue that no incompatibility has been shown to exist. In the first section I attempt to give both a characterization of, and an argument for, behaviourism. Then I attempt to charac- terize realism more generally than is often done, evaluating the work of Dummett, Quine, Putnam and Wittgenstein, as recently interpreted, in that light. Finally I attempt to sketch a behaviouristic justification of classical predicate logic and offer some programmatic remarks on behaviouristic accounts of mathematics and natural science. Résumé Bien des philosophes contemporains du langage, estimant qu'une métaphysique réaliste et une approche behavioriste sont incompatibles, centrent le débat sur la question «lequel des deux doit-il être sacrifié?» Je montre dans ce papier qu'on n'a jamais pu prouver l'existence d'une incompatibilité. Dans la première partie, je tente de caractériser et de défendre le behaviorisme. Puis j'essaie de caractériser le réalisme plus généralement que cela n'a été souvent fait et évalue dans cette perspective les œuvres de Dummett, de Quine, de Putnam et de Wittgenstein à la lumière de leurs interprétations récentes. Finalement, je propose une justification behavioriste de la classique logique des prédicats et quelques remarques programmatiques quant à une approche behavioriste des mathématiques et des sciences naturelles. Zusammenfassung Manche zeitgenössische Philosophen glauben, dass eine realistische Metaphysik nicht mit einer behavioristischen Betrachtungsweise der Sprache vereinbar sei, wobei sich der Streit um die Frage dreht, welche der beiden Haltungen aufgegeben werden müsse. Ich argumentiere, dass die Unvereinbarkeit nicht wirklich nachgewiesen wurde. Im ersten Abschnitt versuche ich, den Beha- viorismus genauer zu charakterisieren und zu seinen Gunsten zu argumentieren. Ich versuche dann, eine allgemeinere Charakterisierung des Realismus zu geben, als das üblich ist, indem ich die Werke von Dummett, Quine, Putnam und Wittgenstein, wie sie neuerdings unter diesen Gesichts- punkt interpretiert werden, beurteile. Ich versuche schliesslich, eine behavioristische Rechtferti- gung der klassischen Prädikatenlogik zu skizzieren, und lege auch einige programmatische Bemerkungen zur behavioristischen Behandlung von Mathematik und Naturwissenschaft vor. * University of Edinburgh, David Hume Tower, George Square, Edinburgh EH8 9JX, Scot- land. Dialéctica Vol. 40, N° 3 (1986)</page><page sequence="2">168 Alan Weir Many contemporary philosophers believe that a behaviouristic approach to language is incompatible with a realist metaphysics. Some, such as Michael Dummett, believing the behaviouristic approach to be the most viable one, are inclined to abandon or modify realism. For others, Dummetťs arguments provide further proof that behaviourism is an untenable, crudely reductionist, standpoint1. In this paper I wish to present an argument in favour of beha- viourism, leading to a tighter characterization of that notion (Section I); to offer a characterization of realism (Section II); and, finally, to argue that we have been given no good reason for supposing that realism and behaviourism, so characterized, are in any conflict (Section III). I 1. Let us assume, as a rough characterization of what behaviourism amounts to with respect to language, that it takes sentence understanding to consist solely in dispositions to verbal behaviour. I wish to argue that such an approach is the only one known to us which renders explicable the pheno- menon of knowledge of sentence meaning (equivalently, the phenomenon of sentence understanding). It does this by providing a target body of low-level data in the light of which potentially explanatory linguistic theories can be conceived and tested. Without such a target explanandum, we would not have the faintest idea how to begin constructing the theory concerning language understanding, nor know how to compare two purported such theories, in terms of explanatory adequacy. We have here a general feature of science. Scientific explanation is impossible if we do not possess a fund of certainly true low-level data sur- rounded by a penumbra of near certain propositions, of which it is certain that most are true. Thus if we are unsure whether relative motion occurs there can be no science of mechanics; if we are unsure whether humans have arms rather than wings, nothing will count as an explanation in human anatomy. Moreover more than a few stonewall certainties are necessary, if scientific explanation is to be possible in some domain. Think of the acquisition of beliefs about the current environment by means of the faculty of sight. What would an explanation of this phenomenon look like if we did not know that light is 1 Dummetťs views on the relationship between behaviouristic philosophies of language and realism occur throughout his writings. For forceful expressions of the view that there is a tension between the two, see in particular his 1976 p. 103 and 1978 p. 225. For the realist point of view see McGinn p. 32, McDowell 1977 pp. 180-182, 1978 pp. 142-144 and Strawson, especially the last sentence.</page><page sequence="3">Realism and Behaviourism 169 essential for vision; that the eyes are the organs of sight and must be open in order to obtain distinct perceptions; that beliefs acquired through vision inter- act with other beliefs, and with desires and intentions, influencing our behaviour and so on? If we did not know this, a theory of vision based on inputs of pressure to the feet, being processed to yield outputs of instructions to the heart muscles, would be as tenable as one which focussed on retinal absorption of electromagnetic radiation within a certain band, and such things as instructions to the motor nerves as outputs. The target explananda in perception, mechanics, anatomy et. al. belong to the "immemorial lore of our forefathers". I suggest that it is a task for phi- losophers in the present era to set down the necessary lore for the science of language. And I further suggest that only on a behaviourist approach does this task look remotely accomplishable. My argument focusses on the particu- lar case of theories of language acquisition. We need to provide a body of target data for such theories and, it seems to me, there are only two alternative approaches to behaviourism currently available. First there is the model of knowledge of observable properties of objects acquired directly by perception. On any case in which this occurs there is excitation of sensorily receptive surfaces by means of emissions of signals from, or direct contact with, the objects in question. Now knowledge of an utterance's meaning cannot be acquired solely by direct perception via the normal channels, else there would be no conventionality of language: both of two persons, in whom the standard perceptual organs were functioning norm- ally, and who were familiar with the sound or shape of an utterance, would perceive the meaning of the utterance, if either did. Hence anyone proposing this model of acquisition of sentence understanding must postulate a hitherto unknown sensory receptor and an associated signal emitted from auditory and written utterances ("meanons" perhaps?). Presumably the explanation of conventionality will be that, just as radically unfamiliar parts of conventional sensory spectra can be cognitively indecipherable at first, so too it takes fami- liarity, and perhaps even training, before one can observe the meaning proper- ties of utterances of an unencountered language. Since, however, next to no- one believes anything of this sort about meaning, the first model cannot func- tion as a target explanandum for the theory of acquisition of sentence under- standing. The second alternative is to treat the acquisition of knowledge of sentence meaning as an instance of the general phenomenon of acquisition of scientific knowledge. That is it involves postulation of hypotheses, followed by testing to confirm or refute them (relative to a given background of accepted, but fallible, theory and observation). In our case the hypotheses concern the</page><page sequence="4">170 Alan Weir meanings of sentence utterances of an unencountered language, or extension of a familiar one. Hence this model presupposes that there is no genuine con- cept acquisition, not even in the case of the most esoteric concepts future science will come up with. There is merely translation into a language of thought, whose understanding is not acquired, but innately determined (though perhaps maturing in the way that physical organs grow). For my part, however, introspection reveals no thinking going on in such a language, nor does memory bring to mind any recollection of such a thought language in operation, when learning a natural language or extension thereof. For any one who shares this predicament, the second model will be hopelessly implausible. (Note that it is no good claiming that the innate thought language is unconscious when one is concerned, as in this case, with providing a target explanandum for the theory of understanding. For whilst the explanation of the processes involved in language acquisition, or in digestion for that matter, may well be best accomplished by invoking computing models, and hence a biological "machine code", such high-level explanation presupposes, rather than provides, the low-level core we seek.) There remains behaviourism. Of course behavioural dispositions are not unproblematic entities, nor do we know much about the psychological and physiological mechanisms behind their acquisition, or innately determined emergence, as the case may be. But we do know that dispositions, innate and acquired, exist, and hence the particular problems associated with the first two alternatives, are avoided. It is evident, though, that fairly specific environmental conditions must obtain before the dispositions involved in lan- guage understanding emerge. However behaviourism on its own does not entail this, far less any substantive empirical assumptions about the precise nature of such conditions. (Even belief in an innate thought language is compatible with beha- viourism, construed purely as a theory about what language understanding consists in. This appears to be the position of Fodor in his "The Language of Thought", despite his explicit rejection of behaviourism2. For he believes both in an innate language of thought and that sentence understanding may be explicable, specifically in analogy with the way a description of the structure of a computer's circuits, and how they operate on, and transform, the physical tokens of the computing code, can explain their "understanding" of their machine code. In human terms the ultimate inputs and outputs to the system will surely be stimulations and overt behaviour respectively, so that the theory of understanding looks decidedly behaviouristic. 2 See Fodor Chapter 3 especially p. 85, p. 95, p. 97.</page><page sequence="5">Realism and Behaviourism 171 In Fodor's theory natural languages are merely codes invented for the purpose of communicating the thought language (presumably it is an unfortunate accident of evolution that an innate species-invariant mode of public expression of the thought language did not develop), deciphered and modified by succeeding generations. This view combines the implausibility of the old theory of natural language as a code for the language of thought3, with the implausible thesis that such a complex set of dispositions or "biological circuitry" as constitutes understanding a language, can emerge without fairly specific environmental conditions obtaining.) Behaviourists, then, can throw down the following challenge to anyone who likewise rejects the direct perception and scientific theorizing models of the process of acquisition of language understanding: present a further alternative, or else show that behaviourism is so definitely false that we can rest content with the inexplicability, at present, of the acquisition of language understanding. (If one takes the case of explanation of language understand- ing in general, the absence of competitors to behaviourism for the role of target data for explanatory theories, is even more striking. But there is perhaps more of a temptation to say that scientific explanation is impossible or unnecessary in the general case, than in the specific case of explanation of acquisition.) In this paper I hope to show that some of the main problems which have faced behaviourism, leading philosophers to believe it must be false, can in fact be met. 2. I would like now to present, in the light of the above arguments, a more substantial characterization of behaviourism than the rough and ready one given above. First a definition of behaviourism with respect to cognitive states generally, where a cognitive state is a referent of a substituent for the term P in a propositional attitude sentence of the form: S P's that A or predicate of the form: S P's that F holds of x',...xn. The definition proceeds in terms of the notion of explanatory soundness: a psychological state or a mode of human behaviour is explanatorily sound iff we possess a body of certain and near certain data concerning that mode or state, in the light of which potentially explanatory theories concerning the nature, acquisition and development of the state or mode, can be formulated and tested. (The notion is clearly not precise: there may be disputes over whe- ther the requisite data exists for some states or modes of behaviour. But I assume there will be sufficient agreement for the notion to be a useful one.) Behaviourism with respect to cognitive states I define, then, to be the doctrine that all cognitive states consist in complexes of dispositions to respond in 3 See Wittgenstein Sections 1 , 32 and also Fodor's comment on Wittgenstein, Fodor p. 64.</page><page sequence="6">172 Alan Weir specific ways in specific circumstances, where characterization of neither responses nor circumstances invokes explanatorily unsound psychological states or modes of behaviour. In the particular case of the state of understand- ing a sentence, the circumstances will include presentations of tokens of that sentence. Behaviourism, so characterized, may seem obviously false. Even a tho- roughly behaviouristic position such as Quine's 1960, invokes modes of behaviour such as that of assenting to a sentence which seem clearly unsound. Quine, it is true, attempts to provide a behaviouristically unobjectionable sub- stitute for the concept of assent, but this substitute is clearly partial and ina- dequate4. Moreover it is a commonplace that possession of a given belief has no particular consequences for an agent's actions in a given circumstance, independently of what the agent's other beliefs, desires, intentions and so on are5. Thus a behaviouristic explanation of what possession of a given belief consists in would have to construe it as consisting in the disposition to respond in a specific way in circumstances which include possession of a large, perhaps infinite, number of beliefs, desires and so on. Leaving aside problems arising from the number of these, a behaviourist who supposes that such psychological states are explanatorily sound, presupposes that behaviourism is true of these states. And if the structure of the total system of our psychological states is as holistically interdependent as some suggest6, then behaviouristic explanation of states of belief will be viciously circular: it will presuppose the explanatory soundness of other states of belief, desire etc. which in turn presupposes an explanation has been given of that very state of belief whose explanation we are purporting to give. Everything hinges, however, on the exact structure of the interdepen- dences among cognitive states, in particular whether there is no well-founded dependency relation among them. (R is well-founded iff there are no R-cycles RX'X2&gt; RA:,,*!, nor any infinite descending R-chains: Rx4*3,Rjc3a:2, R*2*i-) Clearly the best strategy for a behaviourist is to attempt to characterize just such a well-founded structure. Here is one such attempt: first generate a recursive notion of Explanatory Soundness as follows: a cog- nitive state is explanatorily sound0 (¿^behaviourism, as defined above, is true of it. It is explanatorily sounds iff it can be defined in terms of cognitive states each of which is explanatorily soundm for some m &lt; n. Finally a cognitive state is Explanatorily Sound iff there is some n for which it is explanatorily sound„. 4 Quine 1975b p. 91. 5 See e.g. Peacocke pp. 4-5, Fodor p. 63. 6 See Peacocke again especially the first chapter, Davidson 1971 .</page><page sequence="7">Realism and Behaviourism 173 Behaviourism can now be redefined as the doctrine that all cognitive states are Explanatorily Sound. If behaviourism is true there exists a well-founded relation R among cogni- tive states defined as follows: R cmcn iff cm is explanatorily soundm, cn is explanatorily sound^, and m&gt;n. A complex cognitive state, say a complex belief, is thus to be analysed in terms of a molecular structure of less complex beliefs, desires, intentions, and so on, winding down to a bedrock of explana- torily sound beliefs, desires and perhaps some other psychological states and events. Perhaps Quine' s behaviouristic analysis of perceptual similarity7 might be used to render explanatorily sound the notion of perceptual belief: belief about the observable properties of the current environment, derived from perception. The analysis might go: S believes that an F is present iff S perceives that a present object is perceptually more similar to a paradigm F than to a paradigm non F. Again, building and improving on Quine' concept of surface assent, we might hope to define more and more sophisticated con- cepts of what it is to sincerely assent to a sentence, as and when we can recruit more and more sophisticated concepts for the task. For instance, if we can avail ourselves of even a primitive concept of betting and of desire, something like Ramsey's account of degrees of belief can be utilized8. The more sophis- ticated the concepts of betting and desire involved, the more sophisticated the concept of sincere assent applicable at that level of the language. If a behaviourist theory of the above sort is correct, then each sentence of a speaker's language can be assigned a degree of semantic complexity, namely that degree of Explanatory Soundness possessed by the cognitive state of knowing the sentence's meaning. The fact that distinct sentences may differ in the degree of complexity of the concepts of sincere assent and so on, invoked in the account of understanding their meaning, shows that there will be dif- ferences in the degrees of semantic complexity attaching to the sentences. But even apart from this, the phenomenon of understanding unencountered sentences shows that not all sentences can possess the same degree of semantic complexity. For this phenomenon can only be explained by supposing that grasp of some sentences comprises a grasp of the method by which they were constructed out of previously encountered sentences by means of previously encountered operators. Hence the dispositions constituting understanding of such sentences will be complex ones. They will be dispositions to respond in circumstances which include at least that one grasps the meaning of other sentences, which must be of lower semantic complexity. In the case of logic- 7 Quine 1974 pp. 17-18. 8 See Ramsey pp. 79-82.</page><page sequence="8">174 Alan Weir ally complex sentences the responses will be not only to the sentence in ques- tion, but also to its logical constituents, exhibiting an appropriate patterning of responses among them. Logical complexity, however, must be dis- tinguished from semantic complexity. For instance, the sentences (A&amp;B) and (A&amp;(B&amp;A)), are of the same semantic, but different logical, complexity. Con- versely, understanding a sentence A may presuppose grasp of concepts and understanding of other sentences yet, if the understanding does not consist in patterning responses appropriately between A and a fixed number of other sentences, then A is logically atomic. 3. A fairly clear sense could be given to the term "holism", in philo- sophical psychology, if we take it to stand for the belief that behaviourism is false. A stronger thesis, call it "strong holism" maintains that no cognitive state is Explanatorily Sound. Or, we could restrict the theses to cognitive states of sentence understanding only: call these restricted versions linguistic behaviourism, strong linguistic holism, and linguistic holism, respectively. (The first two are weaker theses than the corresponding unrestricted ones, the last a stronger one.) In the theory of meaning, however, the term "holism" has been associated with the doctrine that there is no partial ordering of sentences of a speaker's language in respect of dependencies in understanding: to understand any one sentence one must understand them all9. 1 shall refer to this doctrine as semantic holism. If this view is correct, the meaning of any sentence is a function of the total assignment of meaning to all other sentences of the speaker's language. Therefore a change in the meaning of any one sentence, is liable, though not bound, to change that of any other: none are impervious to meaning change in any fragment of the language, however remote. Semantic holism clearly implies strong linguistic holism (wherever speakers understand a potential infinitude of sentences at any rate). Even strong holism, however, seems compatible with the rejection of semantic holism. If semantic holism is true, then any extension L' of a language L is incom- mensurable with L, (that is any pair of sentences, one from either language, differ in meaning). For, if A possesses the same meaning in L' as it did in L, then there would be a sentence B of L' which it is not necessary to understand in order to understand A. A more extreme version of semantic holism identifies each sentence's meaning with the ordered pair consisting of the web of sentential interrelations, and that sentence's place in the web. In this extreme version the meaning of any sentence is a function of that of each of the others, so that change of meaning in any one sentence changes that of all 9 See Dummett 1976 pp. 79, Davidson 1967 p. 308.</page><page sequence="9">Realism and Behaviourism 175 the others. Thus if extreme semantic holism is true, any two languages not expressively identical are incommensurable: if one contains a sentence with no synonym in the other language, then no two sentence's from either language are synonymous. As an example of a semantic holist theory, we may take Davidson's theory concerning the linguistic knowledge acquired by a radical interpreter10. In Davidson's view such linguistic understanding is achieved by postulating a theory of truth for the language under study as a whole, as part of a general psychological theory interpreting the speaker's actions, and then testing the overall theory's adequacy against suitable constraints. Thus complete under- standing of any sentence is only possible in the context of complete under- standing of all others. It is unclear whether a semantic holist view of ordinary unreflective understanding of language is also part of Davidson's view, to the extent that it is unclear what relationship he sees holding between a correct theory of truth for a speaker's language and that speaker's understanding of the language. If native speakers are thought to "internalize" in some sub- stantial sense, any correct theory, then a semantic holist view for all language understanding would seem to follow. If they do not internalize the correct truth theory, and the latter merely states the content of the native speaker's knowledge, then all one needs is an axiom schema of the form: s is T iff p, with the adequacy constraint that substituents for p yield intelligible inter- pretations of the referents of substituents for s11. An example of an extreme semantic holist theory would be one in which the web of sentential interrelations is that constituted by the totality of all conditional dispositions to respond to a sentence of the language, given responses to any finite number of sentences of the language. Thus a change in the conditional dispositions to respond to any one sentence, changes the meaning, not only of that sentence, but also of all others. Such an extreme semantic holism would emerge from Quine's "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" 12 , if one dropped the instrumentalism there espoused. Quine's instrumentalism is a result of his rejection of one dogma of empiricism, combined with his retention of another. The rejected dogma is the view that every sentence with a determinate sense has a range of verifying and of falsifying experiences associated with it: an observational meaning in Quine's later formulations. The retained dogma is the dogma that every sentence with a determinate sense has an observational meaning. The result is the instrumentalist view that theoretical sentences have no determinate sense, 10 See for instance 1967, 1971 and 1973, for Davidson's views on radical interpretation. 11 See Wright 1980 Chapter 15 and 1981 pp. 110-111. 12 Quine 1951.</page><page sequence="10">176 Alan Weir rather that sameness and difference of meaning only applies to the theories to which they belong. This is given by the sameness or difference of the totalities of experience which would confirm or refute the theory: later the totalities of pegged observational sentences which the theories imply. If, however, one rejected the dogma that all cognitive meaning is observa- tional meaning and, instead, identified the meaning of each sentence with the total network of inter-relations and the sentence's place in that network, one arrives at the extreme semantic holist view. (Actually Quine's earlier instru- mentalism in "Two Dogmas" is incoherent. For firstly one has the view that, in effect, all sentences are theoretical sentences, which renders the notion of "experience"highly problematic. But more importantly, the rejection of any form of analyticky renders the notion of the set of logical consequences of a given theory totally indeterminate13. And, since grasp of a theory must consist in grasp of an axiomatization, plus grasp of what it is for a sentence to follow from that axiomatization, the concept of a theory is also indeterminate in this early work.) That any language is incommensurable with any language it extends, as implied by semantic holism, is surely implausible: it implies that the progres- sive fragments of natural language which a child masters are incom- mensurable, as are any scientific or mathematical languages where one extends the other by the addition of some concept. The even more extreme thesis of the incommensurability of any two expressively distinct languages implies that thesis of the relativity of theory truth to the conceptal armoury of the theorists which was recently so fashionable. For while two beings with radically distinct perceptual faculties might speak incommensurable languages whose sentences nonetheless expressed objective judgments concerning dis- joint regions or aspects or reality, such a view is absurd for distinct human languages. For behaviourists there is no such temptation toward relativity of truth, for the same sentence, carrying the same meaning, can occur in expressively distinct languages. Moreover, semantic holism implies strong linguistic holism, and, if the argument of 1 is correct, such a view must be false. 4. I will close this section with some remarks on the philosophical interest of the behaviouristic approach to language understanding, should it prove to be practicable. Firstly it provides a conception of philosophical analysis as being a kind of eclectic behavioural semantics. One selects some philosophic- ally interesting concept, as expressed in one's own language. Then one investigates how one might account behaviourally for the understanding of 13 See Dummett 1980 pp. 337-338 and 1973 p. 596.</page><page sequence="11">Realism and Behaviourism 177 this concept, or a closely related concept one has created (possibly a scientific- ally more fruitful one), given understanding of other concepts and possession of other cognitive states one takes to be of lower degree of Explanatory Soundness. In this sort of analysis one is engaged neither in translation nor mistranslation. Questions of reduction become more philosophically interesting if reduc- tion is not construed merely as the existence of a homomorphism from one language to another (in which case reduction to the language of some mathematical theory is always possible). From a behaviorist viewpoint the interest will lie in seeing if an adequate behavioural theory of the understand- ing of some language fragment is possible without using some of the concepts occuring in that fragment. Thus conceptual reduction will occur whenever we can explain the understanding of intensional fragments without using inten- sional language, or vague or context-dependent fragments without using vague or context-dependent language, and so on. Questions of ontological reduction gain clarity if one views them from the perspective of the theory of language understanding. For philosophers with differing ontological views need not differ on the first-order theories which they accept or reject. Rather they may differ on the theories of understanding for the languages of the first-order theories which they accept, and in particu- lar on the existential implications which correct theories of understanding will have. Thus an ontological idealist may be defined as one who thinks that the only existential generalizations implied by the correct theory of understanding for any language will range solely over appearances or sense-data. An ontological physicalist, on the other hand, will claim that existential quanti- fication over objects with determinate space-time positions is the only such quantification implied by correct theories of understanding. The justification of logical laws and principles is also best looked at from the point of view of the theory of understanding. The task may be described as one of "naturalized semantics". Thus one is not attempting, absurdly, to prove one's fundamental principles from independent principles. Rather, assuming the principles we have are valid, one attempts to show that the concept of truth, to which we must appeal if our principles are valid, is legitimate from the point of view of the theory of understanding: it is one which we, with our capacities, could understand as applying to the sentences of our language. This is not a trivial task, even if we utilize the full power of our logical principles in the theory of understanding. If the general trend of argument in this section is correct, a behavioural framework is the one in which philosophical analysis and investigation of ques- tions of conceptual and ontological reduction, and of justification of funda-</page><page sequence="12">178 Alan Weir mental laws, should be carried out. Before we can examine the compatability of this outlook with realism we need to examine more closely the latter concept. This I attempt to do in the next section. II 5. In attempting to characterize the notion of realism, and its ancient rival idealism, it is important both to attempt to connect with some key aspect of the doctrines, figuring in the history of their use, and to make them philo- sophically interesting doctrines which sane and respectable philosophers could have held. Thus characterizing idealism as the belief that "everything is in the human mind" or "nothing exists unless I perceive it", renders it a philosophic- ally uninteresting doctrine. For only sufferers from severe schizophrenia could sincerely hold the doctrine to be literally true. Similarly to claim that realists hold that there exists a correspondence between true theories and real- ity, such that the correspondence is discernible by creatures bereft of the major concepts occuring in the theory, is to deplete history of realists and in- vest them with a remarkable stupidity. If one took idealism to be the doctrine of ontological idealism alluded to in section 4, this would conform quite closely, perhaps, to historical usage. But such a doctrine is of little philosophical interest today. (Moreover it is impor- tant, as Dummett has emphasized, to keep issues of ontological reduction seperate from wider metaphysical issues concerning truth14. Another proposal on the same line would be to identify realism with the view that talk of abstract objects is ontologically irreducible. Again this would fit well with one historical usage of the term. Realism in contemporary philosophy, how- ever, is being taken more and more to represent a doctrine asserting that truth is a radically non-epistemic notion15, that the truth of at least some sentences is independent of human cognitive capacities. I shall follow this trend and try and explicate the idea more fully as follows: first take belief to be the key cog- nitive notion and independence to mean logical independence. Then say that a semantic theory for a given fragment of a community's language is realist iff the theory implies that every sentence has a truth value which is logically inde- pendent of the degrees of belief which the speakers have towards the sentence. I would formalize this as: vAeL, 3 ! v[Val(A) = v&amp;V/, 0 ^ / &lt; 1 , VC' &lt; C Poss(vSeC'(Val(A) = v &amp; S believes A to degree /))] 14 Dummett 1978 p. 361, 1979 pp. 3-7, 1982 p. 94. 15 See for instance Putnam 1978 p. 125.</page><page sequence="13">Realism and Behaviourism 1 79 A stronger form of realism will result if we hold that, supposing there were some form of ideally rational and well-supported beliefs one might come to have, or approximate toward, that nevertheless the above independence holds, even when speaker's beliefs are of this ideal "Peircean" type. Whether the quantifiers in this account are understood as objectual or substitutional is not important, so long as they are taken to be classical. It is important, however, to place some constraints on the valuation function Val(Ar), for otherwise ridiculous theories, which arbitrarily assign any old objects as truth values for sentences, will come out as realist. The obvious constraint is a Tarskian adequacy constraint. Thus we will require that all instances of the schema [Val(A*) = True iff A], where A translates A* into the metalanguage, must be provable in the semantic theory, or at least implied by it. (Perhaps, the necessitation [Nec(Val(A*) = True iff A)] would be bet- ter.) (It may be objected that such a constraint rules out realism toward sentences for whom a multi-valued semantics with intermediate degrees of truth is appropriate. Yet the truth values of such sentences - vague sentences and sentence with vacuous terms might be examples - need be no less depen- dent on human cognitive powers than those of any others. For Dummett, indeed, any move away from bivalence, never mind Tarski's constraint, is a move away from a more realist, if perhaps untenable position16. But this seems overly stringent. For we can uphold the Tarski condition, even if we reject bivalence, so long as we treat meta-linguistic ascriptions of truth as also possessing degrees of truth, and stop trying to force tertium non datur, in the form of the designated versus non-designated value dichotomy, onto sentences to which it does not apply. One can do this whilst holding that non-bivalent language is conceptually reducible to bivalent language, so that bivalence holds of sentences ascribing degrees of truth, though there will be complica- tions such as logical consequence coming in degrees and failing of transitivity. These complications, however, may even be quite useful in relation to such problems as the Sorites Paradox.) A further complication is introduced by the relativity, in many cases, of truth to context. The simplest way round this problem seems to be to com- plicate the Tarskian constraint to something like: [Val(A*) = True in context C iff A in context C]. Any relativization of truth to the community's beliefs will be captured as idealist by the clause on independence of truth from belief. This account allows that in an overall theory of language, realism, of either variety, may hold of some subfragments but not of others. This seems 16 Dummett 1982 p. 99.</page><page sequence="14">1 80 Alan Weir correct, but might be thought to lead to problems for those who hold a more strongly realist position toward theoretical sentences, than toward sentences concerning the everyday macroscopic world. For it is natural to suppose that the latter concern a reality no more mind dependent than the former. Simil- arly, if some first person psychological beliefs are incorrigible, then even the weaker realism is false in respect of them. This accords with our tendency to view such sentences as subjective, but not with our tendency to view them as being about the very same things as the, not in the least incorrigible, third per- son beliefs of others. However, we can extend, in a natural way, our definition of realism, of either variety, from one applied to classes of sentences, to one applied to objects or properties. We can do this as follows: a theory T, for a language L, is strongly (weakly) realist with respect to an object o belonging to the onto- logy which the theory ascribes to L, iff it is compatible with the theory that a sentence F a be true, where a names o and Fa belongs to the strong (weak) realist fragment of the language, according to T, yet there is at least one other sentence F b which does not. (This last clause is to ensure that the realism has not been secured as a result of the properties of the predicate, but as a result of the properties of the name of the object.) Similarly T is strongly (weakly) realist with respect to property P iff it is compatible with the theory that Fa be true where F expresses the property P and T holds that F a belongs to the strong (weak) realist fragment of the language but that there is a sentence G a which does not. With this in mind it seems to me that we can delineate an interesting set of metaphysical views by focussing on that fragment of language roughly described as consisting of everyday indicative sentences, plus the theoretical sentences of science. Call this fragment M. I will distinguish the following positions: Metaphysical Ultra-Idealism: The view that for no subfragment of M is an adequate semantic theory realist in the first, weak, sense. Metaphysical Idealism: The view that ultra-idealism is false, but that for no subfragment of M is strong realism true. Metaphysical Realism: The view that there is a sub-fragment of M for which strong realism is true (a further, but not unintuitive, requirement would be that strong realism must hold of all objects in the ontology of M and properties and relations expressed by predicates of M). Metaphysical Ultra-Realism: The view that realism in the strong sense is true of M and thus that for any sentence of the language, no matter how observational, it is possible that ideally well-supported beliefs about it could be false.</page><page sequence="15">Realism and Behaviourism 181 This classification may lead to some oddities: e.g. there could be metaphysical ultra-idealists who nonetheless adopted a highly realist attitude toward some fragment of language outside M: theological language, value judgements, judgements concerning "noumena", perhaps. The justification for the classification depends on whether or not there are interesting contem- porary adherents of all, or most of the viewpoints. 6. Metaphysical ultra-realism is untenable from a behaviourist point of view and must have few present-day adherents. (Perhaps someone who extended the Kripke/Putnam theory of proper names and natural kind terms to all expressions would fall into this category.) However, if some contem- porary interpretations of the later Wittgenstein are near the mark17, then it would seem that he was a metaphysical ultra-idealist for whom truth, relative to a given time, was constituted by the consensus of opinion of the community of speakers, at that time. Methaphysical idealism has definite adherents in contemporary philo- sophy of language. According to a position presented and investigated by Michael Dummett, we should not assert that a sentence has a truth value if, as is common, we are unable to determine, or effectively get ourselves into a position to determine, what that truth value is. Here it is allowed that, for some sentences, an entire community can go wrong. But if a sentence is not conclusively verifiable or falsifiable at a given time, then it is not permissible to assert that it has a determinate truth value (nor, however, is it permissible to deny this unless it is a sentence for which the notion of conclusive verifica- tion or falsification does not apply). In the work of Crispin Wright, more attention is paid to the very many sentences for which the notion of conclusive verification will never apply (unless they change meaning), and there an idea- list viewpoint emerges, in which the concept of truth is, in effect, abandoned, to be replaced by the concept of a defeasible warrant for assertion 18. Hilary Putnam is another example of a philosopher who has adopted, in recent work, a position more or less identical to that which I am calling metaphysical idealism. He, however, refers to his view as "internal realism". But perhaps we can charitably re-interpret "internal" non-homophonically as "non". Certainly mere willingness to apply a Tarskian truth definition to undecidable sentences is not sufficient evidence of a realist attitude, as Putnam indeed recognizes. There is, I think, a regrettable tendency for philosophers in a predomi- nantly naturalistic climate to adopt the label "realist" as a matter of course, 17 See Kripke, Wright 1980 especially chapters 2 and 12, and 1981 . 18 See Wright 1976, 1979, 1982.</page><page sequence="16">182 Alan Weir even when the title to that designation is weak. This is a regrettable tendency because it obscures the extent to which contemporary philosophers, though not ontological idealists, accept a central and distinguishing doctrine of many of the classical idealists, namely the mind-dependence of truth. That being said it would seem to be the case that realism has more adherents of note today, than in even the comparatively recent past. 7. Putnam finds the metaphysical realist position incoherent: he finds it incoherent to suppose that an ideal theory could be false. Superficially there is a simple example of this, namely the case where an incompatible theory is true (nor need we give other than an homophonic account of what the truth of the theory consists in). But Putnam's problem is that he cannot see how two theories, equally well meeting all "operational and theoretical constraints", could objectively differ in truth conditions. Essentially his argument is a model-theoretic version of Quine's indeterminacy thesis (on one reading), in the case of truth, and inscrutability of reference thesis, in the case of ref- erence19. According to this reading of Quine, one could interpret a theory via a non- homophonic truth theory such that theorems of the form [A* is True iff B] were provable, where [A iff not B] was part of one's background theory, and yet the non-homophonic theory be every bit as adequate as the homophonic. All the facts there are fail to decide the question of which is the better theory: there is simply no fact of the matter in this case. Since one cannot consistently hold both the homophonic together with the non-homophonic theory, yielding [B iff A* is True], [A* is True iff A], given that we have [A iff not B], the upshot is that we must abandon the idea that a unitary concept of truth is involved in both theories. Truth and interpretation must be relativized to a particular choice of linguistic theory from a plurality of incompatible candidates, each meeting the objective constraints on correct- ness. (A similar argument is given for reference: here equally adequate theories, it is claimed, assign a in one case, b in the other, as the referent of t, where not(a = Ď).) The result is that weak realism fails for the undetermined sentences of semantic theory: if [A* is True iff B] does not have the same truth value in all acceptable semantic theories, then it is only true or false relative to the lin- guistic community's decision to accept or reject a theory to which it belongs. 19 One gets this reading of Quine by interpreting the non-equivalence of behavioural synonyms in 1960 p. 27 to mean logical incompatability as suggested by 1960 pp. 73-74, and not merely intuitive non-synonmy, as suggested by Quine 1969 p. 247. For Putnam's arguments see his 1978 pp. 125-126, 1981 Chapters 2 and 3 and, especially with regard to inscrutability of ref- erence, 1980 and the Appendix to 1981 .</page><page sequence="17">Realism and Behaviourism 1 83 Yet strong realism might still hold for the object language sentences treated in the undetermined fragment. Thus supposing one argued, as Quine often does, for the indeterminacy of the truth values of theoretical sentences on the grounds that these values are underdetermined by the truth values of all pegged observational sentences20. Nonetheless the beliefs of the community in question, regarding the theoretical sentences, may be completely independent of the truth value(s) of the sentence, absolute or relative. For that is still dependent in part, on whether the theories to which they belong are confirmed or disconfirmed by the totality of true observational sentences, something which no-one can conclusively determine. It seems to me, however, contrary to our informal notion of realism to allow a theory of the above sort to count as realist. It is contrary to realism to suppose that there is no objective distinction in truth conditions between two theories with the same observable consequences; that every reconstrual of expressions which can be effected by translating by means of one acceptable interpretation into the object theory, and back via an incompatible one, pre- serves the meaning of the expressions21. Such a view is closer to instru- mentalism and, indeed, is identical with it if the class of sentences occurring on the left hand side of the undecided sentences of semantic theory is the class of theoretical sentences of the object language. Accordingly I propose a fur- ther constraint on a metaphysical position for it to qualify as realist: it must embody a realist attitude towards semantics. That is to say, the semantic theory, self-applied, must be a realist one. Where semantic theories can only treat of proper sub-parts of themselves, the demand will be that every acceptable extension of the theory to treat of further sub-fragments of itself be realist: realism holds "all the way up". (It should be noted that it is compatible with Davidsonian semantic holism that indeterminacy of translation and inscrutability of reference hold and, indeed, Davidson himself believes that they do hold22. All will depend on how strong are the constraints that truth theories, and the psychological theories of which they are a part, have to pass to be acceptable. Notice also that if some form of Principle of Charity is accepted as a legitimate constraint, then semantic holism seems to be definitely incompatible with realism as now cha- 20 For examples of this see Quine 1970 and 1975c. See also section 3 for comments on Quine' s instrumentalism. 21 See Quine 1975c. 22 Davidson explicitly avows that his theory implies inscrutability of reference and indeter- minacy of translation (though he seems to think that it will not be as serious as Quinean indeter- minacy, so perhaps not all theoretical sentences will be treated in an instrumentalist fashion) in 1974 pp. 319-322 and in 1980 pp. 137-139. It is interesting to note that his argument in the latter for inscrutability seems to presuppose instrumentalism with regard to theoretical posits (in this case the referents and extensions of terms and predicates) whether or not it leads to it.</page><page sequence="18">1 84 Alan Weir racterized. For if the original form of the Principle is accepted23 then we are required to interpret the speakers so as to maximize the number of their beliefs which come out true. Weak realism will therefore be false. We may instead favour a more sophisticated principle such as that favoured by Lewis24, which requires us to interpret speakers as believing what we would believe in their circumstances. But now it will be possible for linguists with dif- ferent background beliefs to hold equally validly to incompatible semantic theories. Thus far from being a means of defending realism from the sup- posed threat posed by behaviourism, it looks likely that semantic holism is itself incompatible with realism.) The proposal above is ambiguous according as we construe "realist semantics" in the weaker or stronger sense. If one thought of semantical facts as not wholly supervenient on physical ones, or such that the supervenience is not even potentially traceable, then the stronger proposal will be the natural one. But even from a behaviourist perspective, the stronger proposal will be the most plausible one. For, from this perspective, semantical facts will typic- ally consist in complex subjunctive facts, and it is plausible to suppose that, for many of these, there will be no conclusive verification, even in ideal condi- tions. I will therefore construe "realism in semantics" in the stronger fashion. This further constraint poses a challenge for behaviourist realists. For it cannot be ruled out a priori that, although a realist position works for most sentences, it fails for certain sentences essentially involved in the semantics, such as subjunctives. Here a programme of naturalized semantics (see section 4) exposes itself to the same "all or nothing" predicament faced by one of naturalized epistemology of which it is, in fact, a part. In the latter, failure to account for our knowledge of, or belief in, a single area of science, essentially used in the psychology, casts doubt on the entire enterprise, and, indeed, on the overall scientific view of the world we have. The problem in naturalized semantics, however, is not solely a problem for realists. It is also a problem for the anti-realist of the sort characterized by Dummett, who wishes to uphold the objectivity of semantics, meaning and dependent notions, such as that of proof, despite the fact that a non realist attitude seems required towards the complex subjunctives invoked in the theory of understanding. The proper response to this might be to say that behaviourism leads one inexorably to a much more radically idealist position than that presented by Dummett: perhaps to a position close to that of the later Wittgenstein in the interpretation given by Kripke, or that given by Wright25. I believe, however, 23 See Wilson p. 532. 24 See Lewis p. 336. 25 See Kripke, Wright 1980 especially chapters 2 and 12, and 1981.</page><page sequence="19">Realism and Behaviourism 1 85 that there are no grounds for supposing that behaviourism is incompatible with metaphysical realism, never mind metaphysical idealism. In the final sec- tion I shall try to make this claim plausible, although the most that can be off- ered is a bare sketch of how a behaviourist might attempt to argue for metaphysical realism. Ill 8. The definition of behaviourism given in section 2 covers a variety of different views: for instance, a Gricean approach could well conform to the strictures on explanatory soundness, and the requirement that there be a well- founded relation of dependency among cognitive states, just as well as more recognizably behaviourist approaches. However, I suspect that a Gricean approach will be more successful as part of a theory of force, and as part of an investigation into suitable adequacy constraints for theories of meaning (spe- cifying the relations which must hold between speaker's understanding, meaning, beliefs, intentions and so on) than as an analysis of understanding. At any rate, in this section I will construe "behaviourism" more narrowly along the lines of Quine's 1960, not because I think this is bound to be the most fruitful behaviourist approach, but because I think it the most successful to date. Sentence understanding, then, is taken to consist in dispositions to verbal behaviour, understanding of sense, in particular, consisting in disposi- tions to make specific assent responses (if any response is elicited at all), in specific circumstances. The first major challenge for a behaviourist realist is to show how even weak realism can be true. Consider, for example, the theory of meaning for observation sentences given in Quine 1960 (chap 2, section 9 especially). The obvious suggestion as to what the truth conditions of such sentences are, is, that they are true on an occasion for a speaker iff the stimulation a speaker experiences is of a type belonging to the affirmative stimulus meaning, false iff it belongs to the negative stimulus meaning. But then if follows from the stimulus theory that speakers are infallible: for instance, a speaker cannot assent to a false sentence, since assent on an occasion places the type of sti- mulation then experienced in the affirmative stimulus meaning. Socializing stimulus meanings may introduce the possibility of error on the part of deviants, but not an entire community26. Thus weak realism is false of observation sentences, on this account. 26 If one believed that error must be possible and also that the stimulus theory provided the only scientific account of meaning then one could "transcendentally deduce" the impossibility of a private language.</page><page sequence="20">1 86 Alan Weir To begin to explain behaviouristically how speakers could err, we have to do two things. Firstly we have to move away from the excessively subjective stimulations Quine takes to be the essence of an observation sentence's meaning. We should concentrate instead, on the less subjective notion of the occasion prevailing at place p, time t. This we can take to be the region sur- rounding point p, t, its boundaries delineated (roughly) by the limits on the speakers' perception. Having done this we can specify that the truth value of a primitive observation sentence, on a possible occasion, is the degree of assent that the speaker would be prompted to give to the sentence on that occasion. However this still renders truth values and beliefs inextricable. We must suppose further, then, that, on the basis of their grasp of primi- tive occasion sentence speakers come to a primitive grasp of terms true and false of spatial and temporal regions, and thence to grasp of a pegging construction [....at p, t]21 . The idea is that speakers, on the basis of a primi- tive grasp of observation sentences, can come to attach a more sophisticated and more objective sense to them. The more objective truth conditions, at p, t, of observation sentence O are arrived at by considering, not just what speak- er's responses to O would be, at p, t„ but what their (unprompted) responses, at any place and time, to [O at p, t,] would be. Better still, we should consider entire (counterfactual) sequences of responses to interrogation regarding [O at p, t'9 filtering out those sequences which do not settle on a stable response. There will also be further weighting and filtering among the response sequences: weighting in favour of decisiveness of response, proximity to the place and time mentioned in the sentence, and, for sentences further up the structure of semantic complexity, filtering out of insincere responses and those not given when the speaker possessed true beliefs regarding all sentences of lower complexity. By a process of "intellectual chimney scrambling", speakers come to attach more and more sophisticated senses to their observa- tion sentences on the basis, at each stage, of sentences, observational and other, with less sophisticated senses, and cognitive states of lesser Explanatory Soundness. The hope, then, is that suitable selection among the responses one would settle on towards [O at p, t,] will yield, for sentences of a certain degree of complexity at any rate, a single degree of assent, or small spread of degrees of assent which would "ideally" be given. (It also must be the case, of course, that the selection is not arbitrary, but conforms to the adequacy constraints relating truth conditions to understanding and belief, so that the outcome is 27 See Quine 1975a p. 75 for a not entirely successful attempt to explain behaviourally grasp of such constructions.</page><page sequence="21">Realism and Behaviourism 1 87 an account of truth conditions and not something else.) This will be the truth value of the sentence on that occasion. If we can do this for most occasions, then the sentence will have a largely determinate, (though perhaps vague) behavioural meaning, and also be such that the actual responses can differ from the truth values: the ideal responses. Crucial to the demonstration of the compatability of behaviourism with weak realism was the use of the pegging construction [... at p, (,], explicated by Quine in terms of conjunctions of observational predicates. Hence even the "intellectual chimney climbing" involved in progressing from subjective incorrigible observation sentences to corrigible ones, involved postulation of a grasp of sentence forming operators. Clearly a purported demonstration of the compatability of behaviourism with strong realism will lean heavily on a behaviouristic explanation of what such grasp amounts to and it is to this question that I now turn. 9. Quine attempts behavioural explanation of grasp of truth functional connectives in such ways as the following: The semantic criterion of negation is that it turns any short sentence to which one will assent, into a sentence from which one will dissent, and vice versa. That of conjunction is that it produces compounds to which .... one is prepared to assent always and only when one is prepared to assent to each component. That of alteration is similar with assent changed to dissent28. Such accounts enable us to give a traditional explanation of validity: a simple logical rule is valid, relative to a given understanding of the constants involved in the rule, iff the account of such understanding entails that we cannot sincerely and stably assent to the premisses and dissent from the conclusion. Therefore someone who is so disposed as to understand the constants in that fashion, cannot assent to the premisses and dissent from the conclusion. (The sense of entailment here is logical entailment, and of "cannot" is logical impossibility, but, since we are engaged in naturalized semantics, there is no reductive claim, and hence no vicious circularity.) More complex rules are valid iff they can be derived from the simpler ones. Since one cannot carry out all possible applications of the rules and principles in accordance with the manner necessitated by one's understanding of the logical constants, it is, nonetheless still possible to hold contradictory beliefs. For some undrawn conclusions may directly contradict others, drawn or undrawn: that is be such that one could not stable and sincerely assent to all of them without changing one's understanding of the constants, and hence their meaning. 28 Quine 1960 pp. 57-58.</page><page sequence="22">188 Alan Weir I suggest that we identify expressions as logical constants iff their under- standing consists in a disposition to pattern one's responses in a fixed manner to sequences of sentences, where one sentence is syntactically compounded out of the others by means of the expression in question. By "pattern one's responses in a fixed manner", I mean that there is a truth function such that the pattern of assent responses one would give on any occasion always agrees with a member of the truth function, and, for every member of the truth func- tion, there is an occasion on which one will exhibit a pattern of responses agreeing with it. Thus a more complete account of the understanding of con- junction than Quine's above, will identify grasp of conjunction with the dis- position always to settle on a value for the conjunction which is the minimum of that of the conjuncts and to produce any such triplet of assent responses in circumstances where one believes the conjuncts true to exactly those degrees occurring in the triplet. Now Quine has pointed to cases where such functionality of assent responses fails, so that the account above may seem doomed from the start. For instance, conjunctions whose conjuncts meet with an indecisive response sometimes meet with indecision themselves: "the baby will be a boy and red- headed", sometimes outright dissent: "the baby will be a boy and a girl". A dual situation holds for disjunction with respect to assent. If we ignored, as irrelevant to sentence understanding, indecisive responses, then this difficulty could be met. But adequate treatment of vagueness precludes this solution. The problem, however, is not caused by indecision simpliciter, but by indeci- sion owing to uncertainty (in contrast with the case where one is in as good a position as one could be in order to judge whether an object is red, say, but respond indecisively because one is faced with a borderline case). Therefore the answer must be to exclude dispositions to make uncertain responses from the behavioural account of understanding. This presupposes that one can filter out such responses in the account of understanding, without violating the constraints on Explanatory Soundness (section 2). One way to do this would be to determine the value of a truth function for arguments other than wholly true or wholly false, by looking only at a subset of those sequences of responses, in which components of the compound sentence receive indecisive assent. The relevant responses will be those which agree with the "ideal responses", i.e. the truth values of the components, as determined by the theory of understanding for those sentences. If it is true that uncertain responses play no part in sentence understanding then further grounds are provided for the extricability of meaning and belief: meaning lays fewer constraints on the structure of beliefs one can maintain than one would expect, if one thought uncertain responses should be taken</page><page sequence="23">Realism and Behaviourism 1 89 into consideration. More than this there seems to be no room now for induc- tive logic. One may of course find a well-confirmed psychological theory which predicts the degree of certainty people will attach to a complex sentence, given the degrees of belief which they attach towards its compo- nents. But those who confute the theory only in examples involving less than certain belief, are merely deviants. If we choose to call them irrational we should sharply distinguish this sense of irrationality from the sense in which someone who violates deductively valid laws and principles is irrational. For we can justify applying the latter description by appeal to the meaning of the expressions involved. Assuming deductive logic we can, for some such logics at any rate, reveal the sense in which violation of the logic is impossible (as well as that in which it is possible). But, if the above view is correct, then even if it is claimed that it is highly improbable that someone will give a particular pattern of uncertain responses, it does not follow that, if they do give that pat- tern of responses, then it is highly improbable that they understand the cons- tants involved in the correct way. 10. I remarked in section 6 that Michael Dummett has presented for serious consideration the view that we are not justified in asserting that a sentence has a truth value unless we can effectively get ourselves into a posi- tion to determine what that truth-value is. His reasoning is that if a sentence of a speaker's language has a truth value, then that speaker must understand what it is for the sentence to have that truth value. And this latter can only consist in the ability to recognize what that value is, if a behaviourist approach to language is correct. Hence, where this ability is absent we are not justified in ascribing a truth value to the sentence29. Now the first step in Dummetťs argument seems to me to be incontro- vertible: it is a violation of the relationships necessarily holding between truth- conditions, meaning and understanding, to suppose that a sentence could have determinate truth-conditions, but that those who understood the sentence did not know what it would be for them to obtain. Moreover I have also argued that a behaviourist approach to language is the correct one. How- ever, there seems to me to be no grounds whatsoever for supposing that a behaviourist explanation of understanding of truth conditions will identify such understanding with abilities to recognize which truth value obtains. Rather the meaning of most sentences will be represented by a complex 29 Dummett argues for this point from a number of different considerations: from supposed constraints on language acquisition: see 1978 p. 17, p. 362; from the supposed necessity that lan- guage be communicable: see 1978 p. 216; and from a claim that grasp of implicit knowledge be manifestable in behaviour, that is from an assumption that behaviourism must be true of certain cognitive states: see 1976 pp. 70-71 , 1978 p. 217. See also Prawitz pp. 4-6.</page><page sequence="24">190 Alan Weir molecular structure, as Dummett himself has emphasized. Grasp of the sentences at each node will typically consist in dispositions to pattern ones responses appropriately to that sentence when presented along with the sub- sentences at succeeding nodes. There is no a priori connection between such behaviour and behaviour which manifests an attempt to verify or falsify sentences. Yet a behaviourist realist could appeal to such dispositions to behave as justifying ascription of determinate truth functions to occurrences of operators in sentences. If, then, each occurrence of an operator expresses a determinate truth function, and the atomic constituents all have determinate truth values, then it is perfectly legitimate to conclude that the sentence as a whole has a determinate truth value. Yet, understanding not being explicated in terms of dispositions to verify and falsify, there is no a priori reason to sup- pose that the truth value of the sentence will be effectively decidable. We can give hypothetical examples of this even if we confine our attention to the propositional calculus30. Suppose there was an isolated linguistic com- munity which was able to verify whether a predicate A was true of any of n spacetime regions 1 , 2,..., n. They could do this, we may suppose, by travelling to the appropriate region and looking and seeing. A Dummettian anti-realist can agree, then, that each sentence A (/), has a determinate truth value31. Sup- pose further, though, that, although any two regions could be visited by the one observer, were the observer to travel fast enough, it could never be tech- nologically possible for this to happen with regard to any pair of regions (it would require more energy than there is in the entire universe, say). Moreover, there are more regions than there are members of the community, (and let n be small so that the conjunction &amp;A(/) of all the A(/) is compre- hensible). If the truth value of each of the conjuncts is true, looking at it from a realist point of view, but there is no general reason for supposing that &amp;A(/) is true, then &amp;A (/) is undecidable. For no being, no matter how powerful, could verify the sentence, unless it had miraculous powers of transport. Therefore it certainly could not be verified by any human linguistic commun- ity. For the anti-realist, then, although all the atomic components have truth values, we cannot legitimately conclude that &amp;A(/) has, since it is undecidable. But for a behaviourist realist such a sentence presents no problem. For each occurrence of &amp; expresses a determinate truth function, in the subformulae in which it occurs. Grasp of this fact consists in behaviour to pattern one's 30 Thus Wright is wrong in claiming that disputes can only rise between realists and Dum- mett-style anti-realists when one moves beyond the propositional calculus see his 1980 p. 13. 31 Though Dummett owes us an explanation of how the fallibility of recognition procedures can be accomodated within his theory.</page><page sequence="25">Realism and Behaviourism 1 9 1 responses to the subformulae and its components, as described above. The behaviour which manifests such grasp need have nothing to do with verifying or falsifying the subformulae: an example would be assent to the conjunction and its conjuncts where each assent is wholly groundless and without justifica- tion. Since, however, each occurrence of &amp; expresses a determinate truth function, and the atomic constituents have, by hypothesis, a determinate truth value, it is perfectly legitimate to conclude that &amp;A(/) has a determinate truth value, albeit not one which mere humans can conclusively verify obtains. What objection can the anti-realist press against the behaviourist realist's argument? One complaint might be that it depends on including in the behaviour which manifests grasp of meaning, assent responses made entirely without justification. This is certainly true, but why should it be thought objectionable. The only rationale I can think of for this stems from a Carte- sian belief that rational inquiry consists in a quest for certain knowledge, rationally demonstrable from indubitable premisses and that, in the light of this, grasp of cognitive sense is constituted by grasp of how sentences could contribute to this quest. But if this is the rationale, it is a bad one. 1 1 . Generalization of the above treatment of truth-functional sentential connectives to objectual quantifiers, can be made fairly straightforward, if one takes the sentences to which one patterns one's responses, in displaying grasp of the quantifier, to be the generalization itself, and the subformula which results from it by substituting a parameter for every occurrence of the relevant bound variable. I suggest the following clause: S understands universal quantification iff for all predicates F in S's language, and for all objects x (or all objects in a particular domain), if S were to understand a as ref- erring to x, then S's stable response to (a:)Fx followed by F a would be such that assent to the former was always less than or equal to that to Fa. Moreover, for any degree of assent to (x)Fx, there will be a y such that, with a understood as referring to y, the degree of assent to both sentences would be the same. The clause for existential quantification will be similar with "greater than or equal to" substituted for "less than or equal to". Once again uncertain responses are not to be taken into account (sur- mounting paradoxes such as the Preface Paradox). Once again the generaliza- tion may be absolutely undecidable, but, as before, speakers' dispositions to modulate their responses appropriately, and produce any legitimate pairing of responses, justifies us in associating infinitary truth functions with the quan- tifiers, and hence ascribing determinate truth values to quantifications, including absolutely undecidable ones, each of whose instances have determinate truth values. Once again some of the relevant responses will not be rationally justifiable, again unobjectionably.</page><page sequence="26">192 Alan Weir The above account depends heavily on the use of parameters. For, by their means, one can say that, although there are only finitely many compre- hensible sentences, considered syntactically, nevertheless for any of a potential infinitude of propositions it is possible that some sentence could understandably express it (though it is not possible that all the propositions be understandably expressed). This in turn depends on there being infinitely many objects one could understand a parameter as temporarily referring to. One can see this with numbers. Although it is not possible for a compre- hensible system of numerals to represent every mumber, there is no number which cannot be represented, temporarily, by a system of numerals plus par- ameters. For suppose there was. Take the least k such that n = t is not compre- hensible for any term n referring to k and for syntactically simple t. Stipulate that the parameter a refers to k- 1. Then k can be referred to, perfectly com- prehensibly, by a + 1 , contrary to hypothesis32. Explanation of understanding of quantification depends, of course, on explanation of grasp of singular terms and predication. One can begin to see how this might be explained behaviourally, if one thinks on how the behaviour of a group who treat "rabbit, white" as a predication of an object would differ from that of a group who treated it as a concatenation, or list, of observation sentences. As Gareth Evans pointed out33, the latter group would assent (leaving aside insincerity and error) on any occasion at which both whiteness and rabbithood were exemplified. For the former group, on the other hand, even an overlap of white and rabbitish regions is insufficient: instead an entire rabbit must be sufficiently white. (But see section 13 for a caveat regarding inscrutability.) In this way we can see the beginnings of a behaviouristic explanation of the "unity of the sentence", one which has no need for metaphorical talk about saturated concepts and the like. 12. How can we explain, behaviouristically, our grasp of theoretical sentences, with their reference, on a realist account, to microphysical entities, processes, magnitudes and the like? Clearly if we can explain grasp of mathematics then we have some hope. For example, given a gross mac- rophysical concept of distance, satisfying suitable axioms, we can apply mathematics, in the form of a representation theorem, to yield a correlation of real numbers with distances, unique up to a monotonie transformation. With this, microphysical distances, and, given an entire co-ordinate system, microphysical regions, can be referred to. Thus grasp of a term referring to a 32 The vagueness of "comprehensibility" complicates, but does not invalidate, this argu- ment. 33 Evans pp. 350-353.</page><page sequence="27">Realism and Behaviourism 1 93 microphysical region will be constitued by grasp of the macrophysical con- cepts involved, of the mathematics involved, and of the mode of application of the mathematics to the empirical concepts. But surely it is wildly optimistic to believe that understanding of mathematics can be explained behaviouristically? I shall make a few com- ments in an attempt to lessen the feeling of futility, but here, inevitably, I shall be even sketchier than before. Firstly, some form of modal, potentiality, interpretation of mathematics is required. It is sometimes remarked, with regard to problems over axioms of infinity, that construing them as asserting the potential, rather than the actual, existence of an infinity of mathematical objects is no help. For, there is no reason to suppose that there is less difficulty attaching to the existence of an infinity of mathematical objects in another possible world, than in the actual world. But this is to locate the modal element in the wrong place. A viable modal interpretation should not take mathematical statements to be prefaced by a tacit "it is possible that". Rather the quantifiers should be con- strued as inherently modal. Since sentences with only infinite models must contain multiple quantification, such sentences, for instance one of the form: "v(x)3y(x&lt;.y)» should be read along the lines of "for any possible x there is a possible y (not necessarily in the same possible world) such that x &lt;y. Perhaps reading the universal quantifier as "necessarily for all", and the existential quantifier as "it is possible there is an x ", will work in the present case, where the predicates of the language are never contingently true or false of objects or sequences of objects. A formal model for the above sentence, on such a read- ing, would be an infinite sequence of possible worlds, each containing a finite initial segment of the natural numbers, succeeding worlds containing larger segments than preceeding ones. What is required of behaviourists, then, is a formal semantics making clear that all of this is coherent, and an explanation of grasp of modal quantifiers which dispenses with the formal apparatus of abstract objects. What could mathematical objects be, on a behaviourist account? A natural answer is to identify them with tokens of mathematical formulae. To avoid provincialism one could identify them with Goodmanian fusions of synonymous formulae. Thus the number 9 could be identified with the fusion of all tokens of formulae synonymous with "the number of numbers less than or equal to 8". Or perhaps we could identify it with the fusion of all formulae synonymous with t, where it is provable that /= the number of numbers less than or equal to 8. Oddities will result, such as numbers occupying a specific (discontinous) region of spacetime. But these do not seem to me to be serious, and the identification is far less arbitrary than the identification of the number</page><page sequence="28">1 94 Alan Weir progression with some set-theoretical progression. (Sets, on the above account, will be distinct from numbers). Identification of term-forming operators as numerical, rather than as say, class operators, or group operators, is best done on the basis of the introduc- tion and elimination rules for identity statements of the given type. For sentences of the form "the number of F's equals the number of GV' the eli- mination rule will eliminate the sentence in favour of a (second-order) sentence asserting the existence of a bijection between the F's and the G's, and permit the introduction of the identity given that second-order sentence as premiss. Thus behaviourists can attempt to explicate grasp of numerical ope- rators in terms of assent to numerical identities when one-one pairing of the extensions of the relevant predicates is believed possible. A case can be made, then, for the view that the valid sentences of a system with such rules for numerical terms, are analytically true. It is interesting to note that the class of these sentences is the class of arithmetical truths. But a distinction nonetheless remains between logic and arithmetic. For the latter, unlike the former, deals with the properties of term-forming, as well as sentence forming operators. It would be interesting to see how much mathematics could be developed on the basis of the logic of term-forming operators: for instance using order- type operators which apply to sentences with at least two free variables, yield- ing terms with two less such variables. Introduction and elimination of identi- ties between such terms will be in favour of a sentence asserting the existence of an order-preserving bijection between the fields of the relevant relations. And one could experiment with systems of higher order, perhaps of trans- finite order. Clearly this cannot be done here. The above speculations are only intended to justify my belief that a behaviourist explanation of the language of mathematics is not out of the question. 13. Supposing that they successfully account for our understanding of theoretical language, behaviourists will face the problem of the underdeter- mination of high-level theories by low-level data. But what of the Putnam/ Quine inference to indeterminacy of truth and inscrutability of reference? How can at most one, of two incompatible theories, empirically equivalent and equally well satisfying all "theoretical constraints", be true? The problem here is not one of seeing how we could provide a reductive account of what the truth of the theories consists in, which reveals that it consists in different things. If that were the problem it would, in general, be insoluble, since norm- ally no reductive account can be given, and a homophonic truth theory provides the best explication of truth conditions. But, in the light of what has gone before, there is no general difficulty as to how two such theories may differ in meaning. Distinct theories contain dis-</page><page sequence="29">Realism and Behaviourism 1 95 tinct sentences, constructed out of different components, or by means of dif- ferent term-forming and sentence-forming operators, or constructed out of the same materials in a different order, with a different structure. Grasp of the distinct sentences will involve exercise of different dispositions to verbal behaviour, or would be manifested by exercise of the dispositions in different orders, according to different patterns. Being not only thus non-synonymous, but also incompatible, we know that the theories do not possess even materially equivalent truth conditions. (Inscrutability of reference, and its attendant rejection of an objective ontology is a more serious problem, requiring more radical solutions than that in Evans 1975. This is, I believe, vulnerable to "ingenious permutations" of the ontology ascribed to a given group of language speakers.) Putnam, if his remarks concerning the inefficacy of "causal" theories of reference to determine objective reference are anything to go by34, may object in the following manner to the above justification of the coherence of realism: such a justification assumes that the meta-linguistic sentences and terms involved in the behavioural account of grasp of sentences and terms have objective truth values and referents. It assumes that metaphysical realism is true of the meta-language. But this is question begging. Now if one assumes that metaphysical realism is false, then one cannot consistently go on tho demonstrate that it is true. But when engaged in natu- ralized semantics, there is no vicious circularity involved in assuming realism to be true, and investigating whether we can account for our understanding of all, or most, fragments of our language (including the semantical fragments), given that they possess realist truth conditions. The task is certainly not trivial. 14. In the last section, theoretical or methodological constraints played no part in the solution of the problem of the objectivity of truth as between empi- rically equivalent, but incompatible, theories. In fact if the conclusion concerning inductive logic reached in section 9 is correct, then there are no methodological constraints at all, apart form "Be consistent! ". This is a realist conclusion: beliefs in canons which will lead one to true theories, or decide of candidate theories if they are true, or if they are false, or do any of these things to a high degree of probability, such beliefs are idealist beliefs stemm- ing from a desire to close, or narrow, any gap which threatens to open up bet- ween truth and rational belief. It follows then, if one rejects any more than the minimal consistency condition as a methodological constraint, that two 34 See for instance his 1978 p. 126.</page><page sequence="30">1 96 Alan Weir equally rational scientists, or scientific communities, with access to as much true observational data as one could wish, could come to fundamentally opposed and incompatible views as to the nature, laws and structure of the universe. Again this conclusion is part and parcel of realism. Nor is it a threat to rationality. Very often an exaggerated opinion as to the powers of reason leads to disillusionment, and rejection of rationality, as surely as outright irra- tionalism. Some, indeed, may imagine that the consistency requirement alone, applied to the union of the theories and auxiliary hypotheses one adopts, and the observation sentences one finds oneself accepting, is an easily satisfied, unchallenging maxim. But these lucky individuals must surely be in a small minority. Sceptical conclusions, of the above sort, about the powers of reason to decide among competing scientific theories, are associated with the names of Kuhn and Feyerabend. (Feyerabend, indeed, rejects, deplorably, even the consistency requirement, and places himself firmly in the camp of the irratio- nalists.) But far from being metaphysical realists, their positions are often taken to be "paradigms" of cultural relativism, rejection of objectivity of truth, and so an. These tendencies in their thought, however, spring from aspects of their work utterly independent of the rejection of a rich scientific methodology and, in fact, completely opposed to realism. For instance, if one is inclined to assimilate truth to that which is rationally justifiable, then, if there is a plurality of rationally justifiable, but incompatible theories, then there is no objective truth. But the assimilation of truth to that which is rationally justifiable is an idealist manoeuvre (and one which is not rationally justifiable). Again semantic holist, and perhaps extreme semantic holist, phi- losophies of language can be discerned in both thinkers, which naturally incline them towards incommensurability of theories and thence away from objectivity of truth. But we have seen grounds for rejecting such philosophies of language. Hence I see no internal inconsistency in the realist rejection of more than a minimal scientific methodology. 15. In section 7, it was seen that for behaviourist realism to be successful, it had to provide a realist account of what it is to understand the sentences of its own semantic theory, and, in particular, explain grasp of the dispositional sentences so predominant in behaviourist semantics. Is there any prospect that this can be done? The likeliest route to success seems to me to be the following: explain dis- positional sentences in terms of subjunctives, subjunctives in terms of the natural necessity of the relevant conditionals, and the latter in terms of the conditionals following logically from true theories of a particular nomological character. (Each step along the line is, of course, contentious.)</page><page sequence="31">Realism and Behaviourism 1 97 For this strategy to stand a chance of success, the constraints which true theories must observe, before qualifying for law-like status, must be fairly strong. For instance, they must not be such that mutually incompatible theories pass them, nor should a theory implying "if A then B" and one implying "if A then not B" pass them unless one implying "not A" does so too. Will it be the case that there are constraints strong enough to ensure this, which are both precifications of the notion of law-likeness, and are non- human relative? I doubt this. I think it likely that the notion of a law-like theory is an inherently human-relative one, that what distinguishes a true law from an accidentally true generalization is that the former, but not the latter, appears natural to all, or most, humans conversant with it. Indeed, it is arguable that without an ability to select among the indefinite number of incompatible theories compatible with given evidence, a sub-class of natural theories, we would not be able to construct the rich, highly general, and some- times powerfully predictive, scientific theories we do construct and under- stand. Chomsky argues along these lines postulating a "science-forming capacity" that enables us to recognize certain proposed expla- natory theories as intelligible and natural, while rejecting or simply not considering a vast array of others that are no less compatible with the evidence. and says that some such science forming capacity must be an innate property of mind35. Now although there is no doubt a conception of realism in which the above notion of natural necessity is degenerately anthropomorphic, I find nothing in it incompatible with the view of realism sketched above. When one thinks of the uses to which a distinction between a law-like total theory of the world, and an accidentally true one, could be put (perhaps determining the truth of counterfactuals with a view to assigning moral responsibility) it is hardly surprising if an anthropomorphic element enters. This, however, does not necessarily prejudice strong realism towards the subjunctives essential to behaviourist semantic theory. Even if the truth of "T is a natural theory" is to be identified with our "ideal" belief regarding that sentence, it does not follow that "T is nomologically true" does not transcend our ability to discover its truth. For truth is a necessary property of necessary truths. That a theory is true, and therefore does not imply any false sentence, observational or theoretical, about any region of spacetime no matter how remote, is not some- thing that we are guaranteed to discover, even given the correct use of reason, 35 Chomsky p. 250.</page><page sequence="32">198 Alan Weir and as much observation as we are capable of. (Contrast this with the unde- termined theories of section 7, whose truth depended on linguist's acceptance or rejection of them). What conclusions follow, if the argument of this paper is substantially correct? Firstly that language understanding, and particularly its acquisition, is currently inexplicable, if behaviourism is rejected. Secondly that there is no reason to suppose that behaviourism is incompatible with metaphysical real- ism. True, only in the more complex sectors of a language do the distinctively realist features emerge: possibility of insincerity, error, error on the part of the most methodical and rational of truth seekers. Realists can therefore turn the tables on Dummett-style idealists, and say that it is not the realist who is guilty of illicit extrapolation, (from the finite and surveyable, to the infinite or unsurveyable), but the idealist who illicitly projects features of the more primitive sectors on to the more mature, where, in fact, the limitation of what we can think to what we can discover has been transcended. Such transcendence, crucially dependent on our ability to acquire under- standing of term-forming and sentence-forming operators, enables us to think, speculate and engage in genuine debate on more substantial and intel- lectually fundamental matters than transient and ephemeral appearance, or the gross macrophysical world. But such an increase in our intellectual powers has its price: loss of the possibility of certainty in theoretical matters, perhaps even the possibility of knowledge, in some areas. For some this price is too great. This attitude need not be indicative of an infantile refusal to believe that one's desires, (here for knowledge) could be thwarted, or a refusal to embark on a quest unless success is guaranteed. For, if metaphysical realism is correct, we will never know if we have successfully attained our goal of theoretical knowledge. And pursuit of an end, when recognition of success or failure is forever beyond our ken, may seem senseless36. For others, on the other hand, there will be a value in attempting to dis- cover rich and explantory theories regarding the universe, over and above that accruing to any predictive success, a value which is undiminished, perhaps even enhanced, by the recognition that there is a mystery to the universe which can never fully be dispelled. From this point of view idealism represents a con- ceited exaggeration of our intellectual powers, or an anthropomorphic delu- 36 See for instance Wright's remarks on his imagined tribe of chess players om 1976 p. 232.</page><page sequence="33">Realism and Behaviourism 199 sion that the universe is custom-built for us to lay bare its nature37. The alternative view of the relationship between the human mind, and the universe it finds itself in, is more modest but perhaps, if one pardons the pun, more realistic38. 37 The idea that the universe is custom-built so that we may lay bare its nature need not be anthropomorphic, if one believed that the universe was created by a deity whose benevolence required that human reasoning and observational powers, correctly used, do not result in error. Compare for instance Descartes' argument in the Sixth Meditation. But I suspect that an onto- logy which included such a being, and indeed any non-physical entity, will not be viable from a behaviourist perspective. 38 I am grateful to Professor Neil Tennant, Dr. Harold Noonan and Dr. Michael Anderson, for discussion of some of the points in this paper, and to members of the Contemporary Philo- sophy Society, The University of Edinburgh and the Philosophy Society, University of St. Andrews for critical comments on earlier versions.
