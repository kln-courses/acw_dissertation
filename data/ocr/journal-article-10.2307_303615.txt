<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Matter of Language Terry Cochran 1 Perhaps more than any other critic in the last half of the twentieth century, Edward Said has consistently engaged historical issues that stress the overlap between literary concerns and political interests. In Said's case, this critical orientation or necessity has generated endless controversy and reaction from across the political and literary spectrum, seemingly giving credence to his assertion that literature, politics, and criticism are inextri- cably linked. More precisely, however, Said's most profound contribution to contemporary thought may reside in his painstaking demonstration that the conceptual tools of literary understanding are not only applicable to other cultural domains and productions but are necessary for coming to terms with their emergence, historical significance, and political economy. In this context, for example, Said straightforwardly proposes a conceptual model that involves thinking "both in political and above all theoretical terms."' This theoretical reflection incorporates and draws its impetus from literary 1. Edward W. Said, "Orientalism Reconsidered," Cultural Critique, no. 1 (fall 1985): 103. boundary 2 25:2, 1998.

Ultimately, yoking the theories of literary and linguistic production to analyses of political interests inevitably leads to questions about potential materialist understandings of history. Before broaching these implications for both Said's criticism and for critical thinking at large, the reference to literature and literary understand- ing requires further consideration. Elaborating a materialist understanding of written culture, including its ideas, concepts, and linguistic presupposi- tions, necessarily departs from the operative notions of literature in moder- nity. The term literature bears the burden of its institutionalization in the epoch of modernity and, in its nationalist versions (for example, French lit- erature, Spanish literature, and so on), has been the linchpin of cultural hegemony since the beginnings of literary history in the late eighteenth century. In the modern structure of the university as it was consolidated in the following century, literary disciplines and, later, departments became identified with ahistorical humanist values, that is, universal qualities to which all human beings in all historical times should aspire.2 Despite the contemporary weakening of these ahistorical claims, literary culture and understanding continue to play an important, though widely unacknowl- edged, ideological role in constituting collective consciousness. In virtually all present-day literary histories, the Renaissance marks the moment when literature-that is, secular writing-became the vehicle both of abstract uni- versal values and of the national or communal identities that claim to share them. Consequently, every cultural group striving for national or communal hegemony in the epoch of modernity has elaborated a secular literary tra- dition, complete with historical account, grammars of the literary language, and dictionaries.3 Inevitably in the service of a given collectivity, literary scholars-who have gone under many names, ranging from philologists to humanists, from intellectuals to literary critics-have reinforced the in- stitutional scaffolding of literature by creating critical editions of canonical works, reinterpreting their meanings, and generally underscoring their im- portance for universal values (thus the category of Weltliteratur) and for 2.

In sum, the claim of lit- erature as the bearer of universals effaced its political aspect and veiled its hegemonic role, just as the amalgamation of humanism with literature (the backbone of the "humanities") served to isolate it from political economy and epistemological claims.4 Against this schematic backdrop, Said's own literary and critical prac- tice, which closely follows contemporary developments of literary under- standing and involves divesting literature of its ideological blinders, on the one hand, and reintroducing literary reflection as a basis for critical thought, on the other, becomes more urgently visible. In the twentieth century, the place of literature in the overall production of culture has undergone radical transformation, and the literary premises of modernity are under increasing scrutiny. Mass production, which has characterized literary dissemination since the early diffusion of print technology, has spread to other material cultural domains that include painting, photography, film, television, radio, and software. In other words, literature and the literary tradition no longer single-handedly dominate cultural production, and the economic force of the cultural commodity has upset the well-policed conjuncture of literature, universalism, and humanism. Without this privileged ideological investment, writing -shorn of its grandiose literary claims--takes its more modest place alongside other sectors of culture. This historical situation, which is as much a product of political and economic transformation as a result of technologi- cal and cultural change, casts an entirely different light on literary reflection and on the conceptual concerns that constitute it. Questioning the historicity of writing or literature is not an idle task. Across diverse historical epochs, the terms, concerns, and objects of (lit- erary) reflection or interpretation seem to vary greatly according to social, political, and material factors. For example, the fundamental historical con- ditions of biblical times certainly moved particular textual problems into the foreground and had an obvious effect on the means, procedures, and outcomes of interpretation. The elements determining the parameters of reflection are undeniably distinct if the text exists as words baked in clay, 4. Tampering with this configuration poses problems for scholars who have internalized the modern precepts of historical and literary understanding. For example, Said's ques- tioning of this model, which I will deal with in greater detail below, has led to confusion on the part of many of his critics. See Aijaz Ahmad, In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures (London: Verso, 1992), for a critique that cannot determine whether to qualify Said (and his work) as being too humanist or too antihumanist and therefore claims that he is both at once and unable to resolve the contradiction between the two (164).</page><page sequence="4">74 boundary 2 / Summer 1998 carved in stone, written on parchment, or printed on paper; if the words are deemed to originate in a deity's voice, an emperor's court, or the activity of an autonomous individual; or if the text is recognized as belonging to a homegrown or foreign tradition. The way in which these factors are com- bined, in conjunction with others, including the size of the potential public and the institutions that produce, preserve, and perpetuate the meaning of the respective text, help configure the historical limits of interpretation in addition to the hegemony they institute. At the same time, however, the general questions that underlie liter- ary reflection, that is, reflection on writing (or, more generally, on inscriptions resulting from human intervention), are always of the same order. They de- rive from a fundamental, almost scientific formulation: How does one deter- mine the meanings of an object (in this instance, a written text) that exceeds the empirical moment of its origin? It was produced, and its existence as a material object (and the kind of material is important if only because it de- fines its period of empirical accessibility, if not legibility) outlasts its author or creator. A number of concerns and categories of thought have emerged to come to grips with this massive question: concerns such as the relationship of the inscription (text) to the collectivity sharing its language, its pertinence to the present, its place in the network of other extant writings (both similar and dissimilar), and its contribution to human understanding at large. De- spite superficial differences, these concerns have-aside from the evident historical divergences alluded to above-remained constant since the ad- vent of writing and attest to the daunting difficulties of any literary reflection as well as to its continued relevance. Just as the physicist uses "idealized experiments"5 to describe and understand the workings of what has come to be called "nature," the (literary) theorist constructs discursive models to depict the polyvalent relationships between language, the interactions of human consciousness, and the world. In contrast with theoretical physics, however, acknowledging the idealizing or even ideological aspect of literary understanding as an object of reflection necessarily introduces questions about extraneous interference; this interference, which in shorthand can be called the "political," encompasses constraints such as force, power, and the implementing dictates of an institutional or individual agent. A relative awareness of the historical production of ideas has been an essential component of critical thought since the nineteenth century, 5. This is the formulation of Albert Einstein and Leopold Infeld, The Evolution of Physics: From Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta (New York: Simon and Shuster, 1938), 7.</page><page sequence="5">Cochran / Matter of Language 75 particularly with the rise of literary hermeneutics. This awareness consti- tutes the landscape within which Said's critical project is initially inscribed. In elucidating the historical bases of ideas, for example, Said sketches the paradigmatic nature of the literary tradition and its concomitant criti- cal framework: "Each age, for instance, re-interprets Shakespeare, not because Shakespeare changes, but because despite the existence of nu- merous and reliable editions of Shakespeare, there is no such fixed and non-trivial object as Shakespeare independent of his editors, the actors who played his roles, the translators who put him in other languages, the hundreds of millions of readers who have read him or watched perfor- mances of his plays since the late sixteenth century." 6 This passage, which appears in Said's text as an illustration, advances various notions that bear closer inspection and that run counter to the universalist or ahistorical bias of modern literature. Furthermore, elaborating the stakes bound up with the name and interpretation of Shakespeare offers an important glimpse into the unique linguistic and historical perspectives that orient Said's work. In the terms of literary thought, "Shakespeare" is a figure that hap- pens to be a proper name. The figure of personification has long been an object of consideration in the tradition of literary reflection, beginning with classical manuals of rhetoric (such as those by Aristotle, Cicero, and Quin- tilian); often described by the term prosopopeia, it took its place alongside a host of other very technical terms of signification, the majority of which have today become archaic.7 Understanding personification as a technical or formal linguistic element is deeply ensconced in the literary tradition, both in theory and in practice, and typically follows the dictates of common- sense realism. On coming across a proper name, marked in English with a capital letter because of its conceptual importance, readers immediately personify it by assimilating it to personal experience and to empirical indi- viduals they have actually met. "Shakespeare," a group of letters printed on a two-dimensional page, suddenly has arms, legs, a point of view, and so on. Most literary debates, whether among specialists, in the popular press, or in the classroom, tend to turn around what kind of attributes--attitudes, actions, creations-can be justifiably assigned to a figure. Yet, rather than pursuing the formalist aspects of personification, 6. Said, "Orientalism Reconsidered," 92. 7. Aristotle described the signifying process of personification as a subcategory of meta- phor; it involved what he called "setting before the eyes" (pro ommaton) (Rhetoric, 3.11.1-4).</page><page sequence="6">76 boundary 2 / Summer 1998 Said offers a larger perspective that stresses how the figure-in this case, Shakespeare's name-comes to be and how it is deployed in time. The presuppositions are as easy to enumerate as the repercussions are far- reaching. As a name whose object rests out of reach, whose meaning can only be grasped through the mediation of countless descriptions and qualifications that are themselves no less linguistic than the name itself, Shakespeare and whatever its reference participate in a very precise lin- guistic economy. Its primary characteristic can best be grasped in contrast to an idealized referential situation. In a straightforward act of referentiality that takes place in an ideal present, a living individual points to an ob- ject and utters "Shakespeare." Referentiality is seemingly complete and utterly realized: It is guaranteed by the individual who serves as a relay for the one-to-one correspondence. This classic model of referentiality lays out the elements but displays little communality with the complex discur- sive networks that give a semblance of life to historical and literary figures. Moreover, in returning specifically to the Shakespeare figure, the presumed empirical moment when the name William Shakespeare was bestowed on a newborn adds nothing whatsoever to our understanding of the figure and can only be rendered present by yet another layer of language (and, in any event, Shakespeare scholars continue to discuss the empirical identity of Shakespeare, including his authorship of various literary productions). For a figure to signify as a figure, for it to take on the trappings of existence, that from which it derives must be absent--preferably for good. Though less palpable, historical reality, which is given substance be- tween the lines of written texts, is just as real as the most mundane of physical objects, and this notion of the figure extends rather than truncates or diminishes reality. On the contrary, maintaining that language operates according to figurations, it presents a model of the way that language inter- venes temporally and spatially (given that absence connotes both aspects) to mediate between understanding and the empirical. This basic linguis- tic model sustains even the most rudimentary historical interpretation of literary texts and has been institutionalized in the form of hermeneutics.8 Said's remarks on the Shakespeare figure implicitly describe this hermeneutic version of literary understanding. The "object" of the Shake- speare figure has no fixed identity, no inert existence cut off from Shake- 8. Hans-Georg Gadamer, Truth and Method, 2d ed., translation revised by Joel Wein- sheimer and Donald G. Marshall (New York: Continuum, 1994), offers the most complete and best-known account of this historical model.</page><page sequence="7">Cochran / Matter of Language 77 speare's multiple receptions that vary geographically and chronologically, in space and in time.9 At the same time, however, Said's characterization underscores the empirical presupposition that provides a methodological framework for interpretation: Shakespeare doesn't change, but his identity is inexhaustible and never ceases becoming manifest in new facets. What- ever Shakespeare's empirical existence, it can never be known directly and is tributary of the collective idea that historical actors and discourses make of it. Although this basic theory of literary understanding may no longer do justice to the collective idea of Shakespeare that is today in full expansion, spreading throughout the globe and traversing all media, its conceptual and methodological reign in the epoch of scriptural dominance has been incon- trovertible. In this sense, it constitutes the touchstone of literary-and, by extension, cultural--critique at the present time. Whereas Said's comments on Shakespeare succinctly summarize the traditional model of literary understanding, the continuation of the pas- sage extends that model to include institutional--and, implicitly, political- aspects: "On the other hand, it is too much to say that Shakespeare has no independent existence at all, and that he is completely reconstituted every time someone reads, acts, or writes about him. In fact, Shakespeare leads an institutional or cultural life that among other things has guaranteed his eminence."10 In other words, the Shakespeare figure exists beyond the indi- vidual realizations that accrue historically. From this perspective, the point of reference for Shakespeare is not a fictional and unreachable place some- where in the distant past; instead, the institutions of knowledge and culture guide, however unobtrusively, the figure's ongoing realizations, the multiple meanings that can legitimately be attributed to it. Shakespeare's life is real and can never be reduced to some form of arbitrariness: There is no mere interpretation. The immaterial figure, the idea of Shakespeare, comes about and subsists in conjunction with material interests fueled, channeled, and guaranteed by institutions that go from the micro level of textual debate, to reigning interpretations in the respective disciplines of knowledge, to macro views of historical understanding and potential interpretation. 9. Privileging this aspect, for example, Hans Robert Jauss applies the hermeneutic method specifically to the question of collective reception, a methodological orientation that has played an important role in traditional literary criticism. See his Toward an Aes- thetic of Reception, trans. Timothy Bahti (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1982). 10. Said, "Orientalism Reconsidered," 92.</page><page sequence="8">78 boundary 2 / Summer 1998 2 In view of its peculiar relationship to history, writing (literature in the broadest sense) offers a synthesis of the material and immaterial ten- sions between historical understanding and contemporary transformation, individual action and collective intransigence, the political status quo and revolution. Other means of recording the sediments of human thought and deed-means spanning the gamut of twentieth-century media-operate along the same axes as writing, but scrutiny of those processes of mark- ing the world has, for obvious technological and historical reasons, been intertwined with literary understanding. Because of his efforts to render an account of these tensions, Said's many critical texts that treat questions of literary theory--including Beginnings and The World, the Text, and the Critic-incorporate an interest in and a response to wide-ranging politi- cal concerns. But Orientalism, undoubtedly Said's most widely read and influential work, stands as his sole extended systematic treatment of the links between the theoretical and the political, between the literary and the cultural. A work of ongoing relevance to understanding the underside of literary traditions, Orientalism results from important deliberation on the historical capacities of language and on the political force of its deployment in institutions and knowledge production. Instead of simply presenting a counterstory of the "Orient," Orien- talism analyzes the idea of the Orient as it was linguistically asserted and historically elaborated. There are evident parallels between Said's charac- terization of the Shakespeare figure and the idea of the Orient, initially a vague notion that is given body through numberless supporting texts that describe, personify, and endow it with intention. As with all knowledge, fig- ures or ideas clasp together material and immaterial aspects; they under- gird all historical understanding or interpretation. Without the material-for example, writing-the idea dies with the mind that thinks it; without the pos- sibility of thinking beyond the material, it is impossible to actuate past lega- cies, to render them pertinent to any given present. In regard to the Orient, Orientalism attempts to lay out the parameters of this complex but abso- lutely necessary interaction between the material and the immaterial: "The Orient was almost a European invention."11 Volumes could be appended to this qualification, this "almost," without ever exhausting the subject. Be- 11. Said, Orientalism (New York: Pantheon, 1978), 1. Hereafter, this work is cited paren- thetically.</page><page sequence="9">Cochran / Matter of Language 79 cause it emerges from historical awareness, it is not merely an invention or phantasmatic projection, nor is it an unambiguous, objective portrayal of what it names. Like any linguistic figure, the idea of the Orient possesses historical dimensions that exceed the ideal referential model I sketched out earlier. In Orientalism's introductory chapter, Said elucidates the presuppositions of the study: "I have begun with the assumption that the Orient is not an inert fact of nature. It is not merely there, just as the Occident itself is not just there either" (4). Informed by an understanding of the specific linguistic character of writing, the figural model Orientalism endorses, no matter how scientifically rigorous its application, contrasts with a model construed on the basis of an empirical knowledge of nature. The Orient, whether idea or referent, is not "there," the object of a pointing finger that indicates it for a present and discerning public. Although the "nature" model of knowledge may have useful applications in specific contexts, its potential for explaining the figuration of written language is severely limited owing to the infinite variables involved and to their immateriality. In the case of the figure (of the Orient, for example), understanding is not a matter of clear and transparent perception, as if one were present before an object and had the power and voice to express it unequivocally. Grasping the workings of this figuration, whose implications for his- torical understanding go well beyond the sense of any particular figure, is fraught with difficulties. These obstacles come less from the enormous quantity of material than from the intricacy of analyzing historical figures that provide the very means of thinking. Orientalism hints at the historical magnitude of the problem: "Therefore as much as the West itself, the Orient is an idea that has a history and a tradition of thought, imagery, and vocabu- lary that have given it reality and presence in and for the West" (5). As an idea that takes form in time, the Orient is a product of historical accretion; once transcribed, it served as a virtual point of reference for competing and coalescing discourses that flesh out its skeletal figure. The reality of that Western Orient is that of institutions whose domain is largely immaterial, even if the authoritative actions that reveal its reach have visible conse- quences. Yet not unlike the figure of Shakespeare, which both channels and derives from countless institutional--and, today, commercial--forces and structures, its historical existence is unassailable. Although in Orientalism, Said's object of analysis is specifically defined, the economy of significa- tion he delineates extends beyond any specific object. The "West" no less than the "East" (as well as any personified collectivity so common in liter-</page><page sequence="10">80 boundary 2 / Summer 1998 ary and historical discourse) necessarily participates in the same economy of meaning. From the perspective of institutionalized knowledge, the figure belongs to a configuration merging multiple series of interwoven vocabu- lary, a plethora of images, and historical accounts to marshal them into coherence. Moreover, as Said's remarks suggest, the figures tend to be defined in conjunction with other figures, supplementing, opposing, and be- coming assimilated to them, thus increasing the labyrinths of signification and the convoluted imbrication. Therefore, to read, interpret, and explicate this institutionalization, the process whereby a figure comes into existence, involves deciphering the "whole network of interests" (3), coming to terms with the concomitant "constellation of ideas" (5), and confronting the "sheer knitted-together strength" (6) of discourses holding the figure in place. While the economy of the figure undeniably endorses the proverb that "history is always written by the victors," its force is more epistemo- logical than physical. In the encapsulated view of the proverb, control of the past, its sequential unfolding and meaning, follows on bodily subjuga- tion. The figural understanding of history, on the contrary, places struggle at the heart of the signifying process as well, which cannot exist in isolation from its respective medium. The most controversial upshot of this way of perceiving struggle in language revolves around affirmations of historical truth. As Said comments, cultural discourse circulates "not 'truth' but repre- sentations" (21). Injecting reflection on language into the historical equation indicates to what extent the Orient, even as a historically delimited cate- gory, becomes an epistemological question in addition to and alongside physical domination, just as knowing and knowledge reveal their political significance. The nature of language, its ephemeral orality and its inability as writing to transport to succeeding epochs whatever empirical meaning it might have expressed, imposes strong limitations on notions of historical truth. In this sense, Said's grappling with the question of Orientalism cannot be separated from this larger investigation of the historical and linguistic sediment of knowledge. Applied to the figure of the Orient, Said's words constitute a general commentary on this tangle of conceptual relationships: "Its objective discoveries-the work of innumerable devoted scholars who edited texts and translated them, codified grammars, wrote dictionaries, reconstructed dead epochs, produced positivistically verifiable learning-- are and always have been conditioned by the fact that its truths, like any truths delivered by language, are embodied in language" (203). History in- volves institutions, ideal projections, and a complement of presuppositions,</page><page sequence="11">Cochran / Matter of Language 81 but its economy is determined by a linguistic process and the material of its inscription (printed words, for example). Without this rigorous scaffolding, historical truth is a meaningless concept, and the scaffolding is bound into form by language. Language, inseparable from its materiality, is the com- mon denominator for these disparate elements that extend from the political to the theoretical. Ultimately, the entire edifice of historical understanding rests on the efficacy of the model of signification attributed to language. 3 Although this fundamental reflection on language has far from domi- nated historical thought in the West, it has been a recurring theme among theorists at least since Dante, who addressed issues of the political reper- cussions of language. In evoking this tradition, Said cites briefly Nietzsche's "On Truth and Lie in the Extramoral Sense" (203); although Said does not dwell on this text, mention of it has become de rigueur for both critics and supporters of Orientalism's claims.12 In effect, Nietzsche's text advances a surprisingly complete hypothesis about the historical and political workings of language; it renders explicit the entangled political and epistemological ramifications of critical practice, including that which characterizes Said's Orientalism. Circulating judgments about Nietzsche display such tenacity that they frequently replace reading of texts attributed to him. Evoking the "Nietz- sche" name in describing individuals or their writings suffices to demean their motivation or challenge the validity of their analyses. Nietzsche's essay on truth and lying, which examines the representational capacity of lan- guage in isolation from the historical contingency of moral judgments, is often cited precisely in this context. For example, Jurgen Habermas con- siders Nietzsche (along with the Marquis de Sade) as one of "the really nihilistic dark writers of the bourgeoisie."13 The italicized darkness sum- mons images of the closed room where nefarious events occur, as well as the opposite of "enlightenment," the eighteenth-century ascendancy of 12. The list of such discussions would be lengthy, and I will limit myself to two paradigmatic references to Nietzsche's unfinished essay in the conceptual context of Said's critical reading: the condemnation paradigm in Ahmad's In Theory, 194-97, and Homi Bhabha's en passant citation of one of Nietzsche's key phrases in The Location of Culture (New York: Routledge, 1994), 164. 13.

In a similar vein, as one of Said's critics affirms in referring to this essay to prove Said's irrationalism, antihumanism, and antihistoricism: "In a Nietzschean world, virtually anything is possible."14 Although the grounds for this boundless possibility are not rendered explicit, this sentence accurately iterates the standard allegory attached to Nietzsche's name. However, before writing Nietzsche off as an irrational thinker of mythic proportions, it is essential to consider the text on truth and lying in its entirety (the essay to which the two extant sections belong remains unfinished). This partial essay, which Nietzsche drafted in the context of teaching classical rhetoric and pre-Platonic philosophy, presents a coherent hypothesis about the way language functions as a means for producing knowledge. Although all interpretation-whether of history or of the empirical world-depends on hypothetical presuppositions, the assumptions leading to understandings or interpretations of human culture (writing or other material forms) are of a different order than those of experimental science. Whereas the latter must by definition admit of empirical verification, no matter how idealized the hy- pothesis and how tenuous or refracted the link established between the idea and its experimental realization, the presuppositions of cultural interpreta- tion can be judged only according to the efficacy in producing a framework for further interpretation. Unlike scientific understanding, which has a built- in linearity running from relative human ignorance to greater magnitudes of human knowledge, cultural understanding (which encompasses all thought relating to historical artifacts, products of human activity and inscription) ex- hibits less fixity in projecting the origins and finalities of the collective human species. Presuppositions about historical knowledge (and, therefore, liter- ary and cultural understanding) are distinguished by how they conjecture the relationship between a human origin and its projected end, whether as divine creation awaiting its conclusion in a final judgment, as human con- sciousness moving toward absolute knowledge by virtue of its own efforts, or as successive social formations marching inexorably toward a classless society. This larger set of concerns forms the context for Nietzsche's com- ments on the veracity of language, which propose a novel hypothesis about its epistemological role. For all its supposed irrationality, Nietzsche's essay proceeds me- thodically and analytically, staking out a series of philosophical positions by referring to the assumptions underlying Western views about the role of language in engendering human knowledge. In this sense, the basic ele- 14. Ahmad, In Theory, 197.</page><page sequence="13">Cochran / Matter of Language 83 ments of the essay are not new; its novelty results, rather, from taking those observations drawn largely from political thinkers and placing them into an immanent model of historical explanation. The ironic opening of the essay, which recounts a fable about how "clever beasts invented knowing" and thus paved the way for their subsequent death, underscores the fictional, narrative nature of all conceptions of the emergence of human conscious- ness.15 This beginning, no less than the first gurglings of language itself, can be recaptured only in the form of a story; in any subsequent historical moment, humans are unavoidably left with nothing more than a process of institutionalization already under way. Nevertheless, how one thinks of this "origin," even if one denies it entirely, has a decisive impact on the histori- cal, linguistic, and cognitive potential of the human agent. For Nietzsche, that moment of emergence is irrevocably and, in fact, structurally lost, and all recuperations that claim a simultaneity for language, human conscious- ness, and subjective intention can only be ideological, subordinate to and supportive of historical interests. In offering a different hypothesis of the irruption of language, Nietzsche provides the backbone for an immanent historical understanding that draws its impetus from the disparity between an unknowable origin, without an identifiable author, and a full-blown human reason enjoying the unacknowledged benefits of sociopolitical institutions. This historical conception rests squarely on Nietzsche's materialist view of language that stands opposed both to the positivist belief in history as a homogeneous continuum and to Heidegger's philosophy of history charac- terized by efforts to catch glimpses of an overlooked Being. In Nietzsche's hypothetical reasoning, the contrast between truth and lie, which has been at the core of moral critiques of the essay, comes to be as a by-product of sociolinguistic institutions. Laws of truth emerge alongside linguistic legislations. At this point in the argument, Nietzsche reformulates the themes of the essay in a more precise fashion: "And be- sides, what about these linguistic conventions themselves? Are they per- haps products of knowledge, that is, of the sense of truth? Are designa- 15.

Is language the adequate expression of all realities?" (81; 878). In the logic of the essay, the upshot is that language, knowledge, and the sociopolitical are inseparable, and no single element enjoys even relative priority. Examining these questions in reference to their historical import occupies the remainder of the essay. In the context of contemporary critique, this batch of questions can be restated somewhat differently: What theory of language would enable one to account for the role that language itself plays in producing knowledge, on the one hand, and in setting up the sociopolitical institutions that monitor such knowledge, on the other? To address this issue, the essay posits that at the heart of human society lies a basic forgetfulness of the epistemological situation in which language evolved. A far cry from Heidegger's dire warnings about the for- getfulness of Being, this assertion is nonetheless commonplace among Western thinkers whose concerns combine political and linguistic delibera- tion. Prominent in this tradition, for example, are Dante and Machiavelli, who stress opposing aspects of the question. For Dante, whose philosophi- cal role in providing arguments for modern national languages has long been recognized, this original forgetfulness (oblivio) anchors the secular process of human action and linguistic change: "All our language -besides that which God created at the same time as man -is subject to the rework- ings of our free will (beneplacito), after that confusion which was no more than a forgetting of previous language."16 In the post-Babel world, after the divine gift of language that could only be the perfect expression of reality, language is as unstable as human action is fickle; Dante's well-known pro- posal to counter this deleterious tendency calls for instituting a grammar of an idealized Italian language belonging to no particular community. In this way, an (institutionalized) sphere of collective culture and sociopolitical writing could be demarcated. For Machiavelli, "forgetfulness" occurs as a result of active struggle between societies or between human beings and the elements of nature. Thus, instead of a passive forgetting, the inability to ascertain, much less to represent past plenitude with any certainty-such as the creation of the world around five thousand years ago, in Machiavelli's example-re- sults from an active effacement or annihilation, something like the historical rewriting that takes place in twentieth-century dictatorships. When a new 16. Dante, De vulgari eloquentia, bilingual (Latin-Italian), ed. and tr.

In this way, Machiavelli concludes, human and natural events (such as floods, plagues, and so on) "wipe out the memories of things," "extinguish" the old institutions in favor of the new.17 As is customary in Machiavelli's straightforward analyses, histori- cal outcomes are determined by relations of force in which the struggling actors can be readily identified. Despite obvious distinctions between Machiavelli's and Dante's ori- entations, their shared historical conception, as well as its political impli- cations, are specifically modern; the questions they raise about culture, its social and conceptual institutions, and the need for a collective written lan- guage have furnished the parameters for modern political thought. Writing in the shadows of this tradition, however, Nietzsche expands this historical conception to include the notion of knowing, that is, language as an institu- tionalized process of knowing, which is consequently also subject to histori- cal transformation rather than just a means to record history. This contrast between Nietzsche and the tradition from which his considerations emerge succinctly illustrates the point of contention between interpreters who en- dorse Nietzsche's materialist view of language and those who exempt the faculty of human knowing from the forces of history. In its simplest terms, Nietzsche's view of language is summed up in his definition of the word: "What is a word? It is the copy in sound of a nerve stimulus" (81; 878). Words are not initially products of a masterful consciousness but are born out of interactions and result from nerve stimuli, out of the purview of a con- trolling human mind. This hypothesis is obviously unverifiable to the same extent as any other story about the origin of language, even those based on the most rigid belief in a one-to-one correspondence between a word and a thing. Once again, though, Nietzsche's hypothetical discourse on language and knowing does not appear out of nowhere, and, as in the case of for- getfulness, his particular inflection is significant.

His Essai sur I'origine des langues tells the story of what he calls the figural origin of language.18 This much debated text offers an example of Rousseau's hypothesis of language formation, and the components of this account are easily sum- marized: One human being sees another and, having no inkling of their resemblance, names him a "giant" (because his apprehension at seeing someone else for the first time leads him to believe that the other was much larger, stronger, and so on, than himself); after recurring sightings of the other, however, he realizes their similarity and invents a new name to de- scribe them both; at this point, human beings have a word, giant, with no referent, even though it was the first word.19 After elaborating this example, Rousseau makes the following observations: "This is how the figural word is born before the proper word, when passion leaves us starry-eyed and the first idea it offers us is not that of truth .... With the illusory image offered by passion being the first to show itself, the language corresponding to it was also the first invented; then it became metaphorical when the enlight- ened mind, recognizing its prior error, employed its expressions only for the same reasons that produced it."20 Despite its being heavily marked by eighteenth-century notions of language and signification, the fundamental components of Rousseau's linguistic understanding differ only slightly from those of Nietzsche (even if Nietzsche might have been shocked to see this affinity, given his constant ridicule of Rousseau).21 What for Nietzsche is an utterance provoked by a nerve stimulus becomes in Rousseau's description the result of an involuntary passion. Just as with Nietzsche's nerve stimu- lus, inciting a reaction akin to a protozoon's response to an electric shock, the passion depicted by Rousseau takes place spontaneously, gratuitously, without the intervention of thought. This intense reaction of passion tran- spires according to an unpredictable logic of its own, not reducible to an economy of truthful representation. With the engagement of reason (that is, the enlightened mind: I'esprit eclaire), the linguistic irruptions of passion, 18.

At that moment, subsequent to the mindlessness of passion, all enters into order: Truth opposes error, and proper meaning wins precedence over the figural. Redressing this disjuncture, which is recog- nized only as it is established, creates the linguistic space of metaphor. In paring away the divergent dramatization, Nietzsche's version seems to endorse similar conclusions: For reasons that become clear as its argument unfolds, Nietzsche's essay stresses that the very distinction be- tween truth and error comes from the legislated regulation of reference. But Rousseau's portrayal of figural languages as error, which an enlightened mind will later correct, privileges individual consciousness and experience, no matter how much a traumatic experience and the resulting expression might disrupt its placid serenity. In tracing the further implications of this in- voluntary model of linguistic emergence, Nietzsche assigns the production of concepts to the linguistic process itself rather than to individual con- sciousness alone, thus dispelling any ambiguity about the absolute privi- lege of individual reason. As part of the linguistic process, any utterance is caught up in the formation of concepts: "Every word instantly becomes a concept precisely insofar as it is not supposed to serve as a reminder of the unique and entirely individual original experience to which it owes its emer- gence; but rather, a word becomes a concept insofar as it simultaneously has to fit countless more or less similar cases-which means, purely and simply, cases which are never like and thus altogether unlike" (83; 879- 80). In addition to echoing Rousseau's account of the repeated experiences necessary ("apres beaucoup d'experiences") to realize the error of the word giant and invent the category of "man," Nietzsche's analysis takes up the terms of Aristotle's logical conception of language, which forms the basis of Western linguistic thought.22 Contrary to Aristotelian logic, however, which derives language from assumptions about the essences of things and about its capacity to absorb and represent them, the conceptualization inherent to language in Nietz- sche's essay does not owe its existence to a presumed essence. As the 22. Rousseau, Essai, 381. For Aristotle's model of language, the primary substance (prote ousia) on which the entire philosophy of language rests, is the absolutely particular: "For example, a particular man or a particular horse" (Categories, 2a, 13-14). Aristotle goes on in the Categories to draw the logical conclusion that "if these primary substances did not exist, nothing else would exist either" (2b, 5-7). How one conceives of that initial ex- perience enables and limits theories of signification, history, and even political action that necessarily depend on it.</page><page sequence="18">88 boundary 2 / Summer 1998 essay continues, even the "contrast between individual and species is something anthropomorphic and does not stem from the essence of things" (83; 880). This anthropomorphism, the figural dimension of language that creates an interface between consciousness and reality, is closely inter- twined with the conceptual categories of human thought that builds on the individual's particularizing experiences. This anthropomorphic impulse per- meates language as a network of meaning production and surfaces re- peatedly as obligatory for linguistic analysis (a tendency reflected in both Aristotle's and Rousseau's use of the human figure in analyzing the links be- tween thought and language). Rather than attributing human specificity to the ability to use language, a historically common assertion, Nietzsche em- phasizes the capacity to manufacture concepts, a by-product of the amal- gam between thought and language: "Everything which distinguishes man from the animals depends upon this ability to volatilize perceptual meta- phors (die anschaulichen Metaphern) in a schema, and thus to dissolve a figure (Bild) into a concept" (84, 881).23 Ultimately, this human penchant to conceptualize operates by virtue of language, which is of a wholly different order than what it expresses. Nietzsche characterizes this disjuncture as mimicking a "suggestive transference, a stammering translation into a com- pletely foreign tongue."24 Language, and the thought it permits, dissipates this incommensurability, just as the translation replaces the original it can never equal. In its own highly original way, the essay on truth and lying presents a model of historical and linguistic knowing with a defined set of presupposi- tions. This insistence on a model does not signal the relative interchange- ability of historical models and their consequent interpretations. All models or groups of assumptions cohere with compatible interests and historical constraints, including socioeconomic and cultural formations, even if the dominance or hegemony of certain models is not wholly arbitrary. In this 23. To a certain extent borrowing Kantian terminology, this passage indicates the transfer ("metaphor") of a perception (Anschauung, or "intuition" in English-language Kantian ter- minology) into a schema. In explaining the coining of "giant," Rousseau attempts to grasp this visual aspect by relating "passions" to an "idea," which turns out to be erroneously assigned to the expression.

In the same way, Nietzsche's model also has a highly charged historical component, even if it stops far short of identifying the historical with the breezy narrative claiming to represent it. 4 The extreme importance of this fragmentary essay for Said's work and for contemporary critical thought generally derives more from the con- sequences of Nietzsche's formulations than from the formulations them- selves. As Nietzsche's essay makes clear, in stretching this linguistic model along a time line, history-and, no less significantly, concomitant human consciousness--becomes a never-ending process of sedimentation: "Even the relationship of a nerve stimulus to the generated figure is not in itself a necessary one. But when the same figure has been generated millions of times and has been handed down for many generations and finally ap- pears on the same occasion every time for all humankind, then it acquires at last the same meaning for human beings it would have if it were the sole necessary figure and if the relationship of the original nerve stimulus to the generated figure were a strictly causal one" (87; 884). This description contains the nucleus of a theory of history that resembles more a radical materialism than an empty denial of external reality. What is arbitrary at some long lost beginning, what is not necessary in itself (an sich), takes on a historical necessity through time. Historical necessities exist, but only as the result of history itself. The figure-of thought, of expression -cannot be divested of its history any more than a language can be freed of its mean- ings and still remain a language. The gradual naturalization of these figures, that is, the (tools of) thought they render natural, makes human conscious- ness possible; at the same time, they pose formidable obstacles for any theory of history that would not place human consciousness at its concep- tual center. A rigorous materialist theory of history would inevitably have to take into account the matter of thought, which means integrating con- sideration of language while refusing to grant absolute primacy to human consciousness and to the theories of representation and causality that such primacy involves.</page><page sequence="20">90 boundary 2 / Summer 1998 This theory of language-what I have called Nietzsche's model of historical understanding-surrounds and traverses the passage Said cites to indicate the theoretical underpinnings of his investigation into Oriental- ism. This passage, certainly the best known paragraph of the essay and perhaps of Nietzsche's work as a whole, both summarizes the essay and, because it is torn from the carefully constructed argument, misrepresents it: "What then is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, and anthro- pomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poeti- cally and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding. Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions; they are meta- phors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their figures (Bild) and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins" (84; 880-81).25 The problem with truth is that it is inextricably tangled up with language, but the result of this observation is to historicize rather than relativize truth. Language, and the concepts that feed on it, definitely establish truths; but truths are also the product of historical forces and live on by virtue of social, political, and linguistic in- stitutions, among others, whose longevity masks the figuration at the basis of all language. This model of language and consciousness, which presup- poses that the economy of language is fundamentally metaphorical and figural, opens up new avenues of historical critique that extend to the con- cepts themselves. Institutions- understood in the broadest sense-efface that figuration into invisibility, just as time erodes the face of a coin; from this perspective, historical understanding calls for recovering those figures and deciphering the forces that promoted their disappearance. In the last twenty years, since the publication of Said's Orientalism, the theory of history put forth in Nietzsche's essay has had significant rever- berations in contemporary criticism. Whatever their ultimate goals, however, these reactions end up at the very least nodding to the political implications 25. This passage has been translated many times, but there is little agreement about how to express Bild in English. The translation I cite, for example, originally renders the phrase in question as "coins which have lost their embossing"; Walter Kaufmann, whose transla- tion is most often cited and is used by Said and his commentators, prefers "coins which have lost their pictures." See "On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense," in The Portable Nietzsche (New York: Viking, 1968), 47; and Paul de Man provides his own somewhat freer translation: "metaphors that have been used up and have lost their imprint and that now operate as mere metal, no longer as coins" (in Allegories of Reading: Figural Lan- guage in Rousseau, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Proust [New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1979], 111).</page><page sequence="21">Cochran / Matter of Language 91 of this materialist view of language. In an important essay on anthropo- morphism, for example, Paul de Man remarks on Nietzsche's definition of truth: "Tropes are neither true nor false but are both at once. To call them an army is however to imply that their effect and their effectiveness is not a matter of judgment but of power. What characterizes a good army, as distinct for instance from a good cause, is that its success has little to do with immanent justice and a great deal with the proper economic use of its power." Although de Man primarily seeks to read the figures of Nietzsche's text and to show how the anthropomorphism of its language plays out its assertions, his comments are revealing of the dual power that inhabits lan- guage. De Man refers to this power as "epistemological" and "strategic," tied simultaneously to the production of knowledge and to persuading, to convincing, to provoking actions. In other words, as a product of ongoing in- stitutionalization, language enforces, cajoles, and convinces, but its power is also more insidious because it lurks in its concepts, in the very matter of thought. Conceptually, this power is an antecedent to judgment, which acts in the name of that power even as the judge can do little more than assert his or her impartiality.26 Nevertheless, this powerful paradigm of historical understanding, grounded in the linguistic matter of concepts, carries within itself the mecha- nism of critique. In Nietzsche's text, this critique has to do with metaphors, those figures always caught up in the process leading to concepts: "The drive toward the formation of metaphors is the fundamental human drive, which one cannot for a single instant dispense with in thought, for one would thereby dispense with man himself. This drive is not truly vanquished and scarcely subdued by the fact that a regular and rigid new world is con- structed as a prison from its own ephemeral products, the concepts" (88- 89; 887). At bottom, the human linguistic process portrayed here, certainly anti-Aristotelian and contrary to beliefs in mystical essence, exceeds the concepts that would channel and master it. In that sense, it is a theory con- cerned with production cutting across concepts that accrue to themselves universality while denying -or forgetting -the historical force necessary for them to come into being. Because figuration belongs fundamentally to lan- guage and, consequently, to human thought, the social and cognitive power of institutions lives by the same process that enables unmasking, however fleetingly, the power they conceal. In effect, this conception of historical and linguistic matter acknowl- 26. Paul de Man, "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," in The Rhetoric of Roman- ticism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1984), 242.</page><page sequence="22">92 boundary 2 / Summer 1998 edges a wholly different form of power and no longer relegates discursive and cultural expression to simply a secondary role vis-a-vis executive force. This basic force of linguistic figuration, of the formation of metaphors, under- scores the importance of the matter of history- inscribed almost exclusively on paper prior to the late nineteenth century-and of literary reflection. It is not happenstance that Nietzsche was trained as a classical philologist, the nineteenth-century equivalent of a literary critic; nor should it be surprising that Antonio Gramsci, the twentieth-century thinker who has most deeply analyzed the historical ramifications of cultural production and who has also been a fundamental reference for Said, was a university student of litera- ture who concentrated on linguistics. Gramsci's view of metaphor displays interesting affinities with that of Nietzsche, despite their wide differences of historical vision. In clarifying the use of the term immanence in materialist theory, Gramsci characterizes the status of metaphor: "All language is a continuous process of metaphors, and the history of semantics is an as- pect of the history of culture: language is both a living thing and a museum of fossils of past life and civilizations."27 This historical sedimentation, in- scribed and reinscribed in the ongoing elaboration of figures, provides the stuff of thought, of its hegemonic force, and of the critique that sifts out the interests that cover up their figural nature. In Gramsci's speculations, the overlapping effects of the linguistic and the political receive greatest emphasis. Gramsci links these disjunc- tures between reigning metaphorical languages to the emergence of new worldviews (or new world conceptions: He refers to a "nuova concezione del mondo"), thereby moving the historical question into the foreground. Contrary to Nietzsche, whose concern with the power of ideas and con- cepts takes a largely epistemological turn, Gramsci focuses, in his work, on the historical significance of historical transformation and of the ideologies in subsequent world orders. Language is "always metaphorical. Although one may not be able to say exactly that every discourse is metaphorical with respect to the thing or material object indicated (or to the abstract con- cept), so as not to enlarge too much the concept of metaphor, one can nonetheless say that present-day language is metaphorical with respect 27.

Buttigieg, vol. 2 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1996), 159.</page><page sequence="23">Cochran / Matter of Language 93 to the meanings and ideological content that the words have had in prior periods of civilization." Despite Gramsci's hesitation about putting into ques- tion the empirical model of language deriving from Aristotle, the historical trajectory he describes clearly operates according to a historical model of meaning production: There is no pure essence hiding and waiting only to be discovered. The explicit recognition that metaphor is also a concept uncom- fortably dovetails with language's ineluctable production of concepts and introduces an irony that Nietzsche would have, no doubt, appreciated. But Gramsci's notion of succeeding worldviews, with their concomitant hege- monies and supporting constellations of ideas, gives this theory of history an overtly political face. While the primary outcome may be to radicalize historical understanding, to question universals presumed to continue un- scathed by history, in practice this linguistic materialism hints at a new mode of historical intervention.28 At the edge of the twenty-first century, the question of historical inter- vention takes on unforeseen meanings, largely because of the historical conjuncture itself, the clash in worldviews and the technological means that diffuse them. In his careful reading of the established truth about the Ori- ent, a reading that entailed laying bare the gradual evolution of the idea into the status of an existing thing whose ideological foundations have been forgotten, Said's analysis has done considerably more than dispel illusions. In his drive to unite the theoretical and the political, Said's work has made contributions to both realms; his portrayal of certain tendencies of historical intervention could very easily apply to his own work: "The critique of objec- tivity and authority did perform a positive service by underlining how, in the secular world, human beings construct their truths, and that, for example, the so-called objective truth of the white man's superiority built and main- tained by the classical European colonial empires also rested on a violent subjugation of African and Asian peoples."29 But, even more importantly, his work has irrefutably demonstrated that institutions are more than simply the buildings that have doors, locks, fenced-in lawns, and local police. They are also nonempirical institutions composed of language, concepts, and figures. 28. Gramsci, Quaderni, 1438, 1427. 29. Edward W.
