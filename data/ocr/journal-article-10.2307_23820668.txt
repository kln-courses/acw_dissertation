<plain_text><page sequence="1">41 THE ANTI-SOCIAL CONTRACT: ENMITY AND SUSPICION IN NORTHERN MONGOLIA1 LARS H0JER This article is based on fieldwork conducted in Northern Mongolia's Hovsgol province in a remote rural district, located on the geographical border between the Mongolian steppe zone and the Siberian taiga (see Maps 1 and 2). The fieldwork was primarily carried out in the central village of the district (sumyn tdv), home to approximately 1000 people, but included frequent trips to the countryside (hodoo), where the remaining 2000 people of the district live in wooden houses or portable tent-like dwellings (ger), scattered across an area of about 500 square miles and sustaining a livelihood from pastoral nomadism. However, village life and pastoral life are socially and economically deeply intertwined and cannot be rigidly separated. Pastoralists and villagers alike are, if not always, then very often on the move, and the number of people living in the village or the countryside differs strongly from season to season. Mongolia used to be a socialist country strongly dependent on the Soviet Union. Religion was effectively persecuted in the 1930s and almost all property was collectivised by 1960. All districts in Mongolia used to have a collective farm or a state farm into which the local pastoral economy was integrated. In the early 1990s the socialist system collapsed, measures were taken to introduce democracy and market economy, and Mongolia came to face strong economic hardship. About ten years after the break-down of the socialist system - i.e. when I carried out fieldwork - the local collective farm had disintegrated and the life of people in the district had come to be based largely on privately owned livestock - i.e. cattle, yaks, sheep, goats and horses - combined with small-scale business, hunting, and state salaries and pensions. Although the following argument deals with a different level of analysis, one might wish to keep this context of movement and economic hardship in mind. The article is a slightly revised version of a paper presented at the Senior Seminar at Department of Social Anthropology, University of Cambridge, on 4th June 2004.

The title of this article has been stolen from Viveiros de Castro's monography, 'From the Enemy's Point of View' (1992). He is concerned with warfare, vengeance and cannibalism and uses it to portray an Amazonian 'social form that included its exterior or was only realised through it' (Viveiros de Castro 1992: 283). This was a social structure which had 'neither subject nor center, being constituted as a relation-to-the-enemy: vengeance was its foundation' (Viveiros de Castro 1992: 284). To consume the enemy, and thereby become an enemy yourself, was the life force of the self, and to be consumed by others was to truly be. He speaks of the 'anti-social contract' in the sense that these people are enemies of themselves and in the structural sense that 'the "truth of society" lies in the hands of others' (Viveiros de Castro 1992: 287) and not in the autonomy of society itself. In this kind of cannibalism you are - quite literally - realised in and through the other. The notion of reciprocity seems to more than lurk in the background. Yet, it seems to me that one major question is left unanswered: Why would people fight at all when the only proper death was to be slain by the enemy? Why not just lay down your arms and get killed? In short, what had happened to the enemy as true enemy? And is the exterior through which the interior is realised truly exterior, when the fear and apprehension of war have become only the productive fuel for the self? For me to see his very anthropological trick, or the trick of the Amazonian people about whom he is speaking, is to have made the exterior interior. Surely, their 'being is becoming', as he writes, but it seems to be a rather known and frozen kind of becoming. And it seems to me that this kind of analysis - and I'm obviously not in a position to assess its ethnographic validity - tends toward the inferiority or immanence of self and other. I raise this issue, not because I have a problem with Viveiros de Castro's argument, but because anthropologists often seem to end up with what seems to be a pre configured conclusion. Whether in peace or war, Amazonia or Mongolia, we look for the intimate dependency of self and other, i.e. for social relations - and voila - we find them. Everywhere and always. I believe that we thereby tend to downplay an element of uncertainty, anxiety and the unknown in self-other relations. It might have been unwise to steal this title, 'the anti-social contract', because the concern of the present argument is - if not the opposite - then at least the fashioning of a very different kind of human attention which has to do with avoiding 'sociality' as reciprocity, with the production of true exteriority and with avoiding and exorcising the influence of the truly other in order to stay oneself. If anthropology tends to foreground processes of making the exterior interior, this article is concerned with the opposite process of simultaneously making and keeping the exterior in a position truly outside. And if Viveiros de</page><page sequence="4">44 Lars Hsjer Castro's point with regard to Amazonian cannibalism was that you become what you eat, namely your own enemy, then I can conclude that the Mongolian diet is quite different. The question of concern is how you avoid being eaten by others, metaphorically speaking that is. In this way, sociality as reciprocity constitutes an almost magical danger rather than a productive possibility. As a kind of sub-text this will bring us to touch upon uncertainty, not as the result of a shattered certainty, but as something in itself produced, and upon culture or knowledge as productive of not just meaning, explanation or closure, but of anxiety and dispersal too. All this will simultaneously be attended to as something experienced and highlighted on various levels during my fieldwork as well as within anthropological theorising. It should be stressed that what I try to bring out in this article is not only 'Mongolian' and might equally well apply to other ethnography, and that this article is only about an aspect of Mongolian social and cultural life which - if space allowed it - should be complemented with an analysis of other spheres of Mongolian rural life, such as formal hierarchy and etiquette. This article simply concerns uncertainty, suspicion and suspense as such phenomena are actively propagated in various knowledge practices, some of which are embedded in people's everyday anticipations of other agencies and some of which shares into more coherent cultural traditions. Reciprocity is magic A long time ago Owen Lattimore wrote the following: Most Mongol tribes think and speak of most other Mongols with a mixture of dislike, suspicion and sometimes envy. At the same time all who speak the Mongol tongue, they feel, are aha-duii, elder and younger brothers, and ought to stand together against all who are not Mongols. Even Tibetans, who are Lama Buddhists like themselves and among whom live the two greatest holy personages, the Dalai and Panch'an Lamas, they universally and strongly dislike. It is, I think, inherent in the character of the nomad life that there should be this wavering between unity and dispersal. Nomadism cannot be uniform (1975: 246).2 Compare this comment about the contractions and divisions of nomadism in old-time Mongolia with the contemporary fact that in Mongolia it is often considered dangerous to receive things from others. An informant told me the following: Lattimore's observation is concordant with the fact that traditional nomadic society seems to have had much internal tribal animosity (Bulag 1998: 65); (see also Jagchid and Hyer 1979:255, 262).</page><page sequence="5">The Anti-Social Contract: Enmity and Suspicion in Northern Mongolia 45 Maybe you have an object, an earring, received from someone else and this object causes misfortune. People have taken a thing with misfortune. Because of this animals die, people fall ill, and you must either throw the thing away or give it to someone else. The things received could be earrings, snuff bottles, knives or almost anything. The informant uses the Mongolia word ed for such things or belongings. When Sneath discusses the Mongolian notion of ed, meaning thing, object or possession, he stresses significantly that ed needs to be governed and apportioned within a social and moral order, and that simply to take ed is illicit (2002: 202-203). In other words, ed is not supposed to move freely between 'orders'. Lattimore suggests that nomadism involves dispersal as much as unification, and likewise the informant above is making a 'counter-connective' claim when pointing to the danger, and not alliance-producing properties, of certain exchanges or transfers of objects. Some objects - ones manufactured or utilised by other humans and belonging to another person and order - have moved dangerously between social units and have cast misfortune on the receiver. The thing is received from others, it is marked by these others and the misfortune is caused by the thing; in short, the intrusion of otherness has caused misfortune. Reciprocity, as classically outlined, is precisely about exchanging things still invested with the social agents exchanging them, because the objects are - as Godelier (1999) puts it - in a sense inalienable and alienable at the same time and therefore associating social units.3 But in Mongolia, as elsewhere, there seem to be instances where such association through detachable objects is what should be avoided because they pose a threat not unlike 'contagious magic'.4 Sometimes there simply seems to be a problem if the items of (unknown) others, invested with their (unknown) acts, are appropriated or just appearing outside the sphere of such others. Mauss is aware of this when he mentions the notion of 'the fatal gift' and the fact that the word 'gift' has a double meaning in some Germanic languages, namely gift and poison. This point, however, should be developed and expanded - and its full implications should be explored - not only with regard to the exchange of things, but also with regard to the exchange of words and, indeed, anything. Godelier phrases it the following way: 'If the counter-gift does not erase the debt, it is because the "thing" given has not really been separated, completely detached from the giver. The thing has been given without really being "alienated" by the giver' (1999:42). Although not working back on the person from whom the object is detached, but rather working on the person appropriating the detached object from an other.</page><page sequence="6">46 Lars H0jer Fieldwork Mongolia is often described as a land without fences and rural life depicted as friendly and peaceful by Mongolians and foreigners alike. It is a widespread stereotype that Mongolians are a particularly hospitable5 people (see e.g. Jagchid and Hyer 1979:132). Yet, needless to say, this image is only part of the picture. High fences protect the suburban compounds in Ulaanbaatar, the Mongolian capital, and securely locked metal doors often safeguard flats in apartment blocks against criminals. But protection against human dangers is also of concern in the Mongolian countryside. In the village where I did my fieldwork, as well as in many other villages, most people live in 'compounds' (hashaa) surrounded by high fences and protected by vicious dogs awaiting unwelcome intruders. In fact, as settlements condense - as one moves closer to the centre of the village - fences tend to grow higher. Physical proximity seems to engender more protection and separation of individual compounds. To be sure, in the countryside there are almost no fences - as the stereotype will have it - but nor are there, with the possible exception of closely related people, many immediate neighbours on the steppe. A local lama6 in the village considered it critical to protect his family with a magic shield of mantras (tarni), i.e. mystical formulas, working from within two hundred metres of his home, and theft is an issue that comes up again and again. Thus, the lack of fencing might, rather than being an indication of hospitality, be due to the fact that fencing is unnecessary or simply less visible.7 At least it would be unwise, when visiting a pastoral camp, to step out of the vehicle before the fierce dogs of the host family - their most trusted animals - have been brought under control. Visitors, especially unknown ones, are rarely met with an unconditional smile, but rather with a reserved attitude. If invited into a home, it seems important not to mistake hospitality for cordiality, because people are often cautious and A concept always used rather imprecisely to describe Mongolians as hospitable, friendly and open. Whereas a lama in the Tibetan context is a religious teacher, the term is used for the Buddhist clergy in Mongolia. Yet many present lamas are not technically proper monks in the sense of having been ordained according to the canonical Buddhist monastic rules (Bareja-Starzynska and Havnevik (manuscript)). Accordingly, the term is at present often used rather vaguely. Sneath writes: '...Mongolian culture has, for long periods of time, associated land with agencies, both spiritual and temporal, who have been considered the "owners" or "stewards" of it' (1997: 8). And in a note he adds: 'This is in contrast to the romantic notion of pastoral nomads who consider the unfenced land they move upon to belong to all' (1997:14).</page><page sequence="7">The Anti-Social Contract: Enmity and Suspicion in Northern Mongolia 47 their hospitality based on subscribing to a formal obligation of serving tea and some bread or dried curds.8 Having just arrived at the fieldsite and having settled down with a local Mongolian family, my fieldwork assistant and I decided, at the request of my host family, to join them for a visit to the Bulnai sanatorium, a decaying socialist-style recreational holiday resort with healthy hot springs located in the northernmost part of the district, just before the taiga swallows the last spaces of open steppe land. We got hold of a driver and left in an old Russian jeep for a few days of recreation. Before leaving, though, everything was locked up properly and the neighbours were asked to feed our dogs and keep a proper eye on our compound. Thieves seemed to lurk everywhere and nobody should know, I was told, that we left some of my equipment behind. On the second day at the sanatorium we passed two women on our way down to the hot spring bathhouses. We were told that one of them had been a teacher, indeed a colleague of the father of my host family, but had now gone to live in the capital where she had settled down as a diviner of some repute. She had become well known and rich, and her name had even appeared in newspapers. Rumours had it that she was a hermaphrodite. We hardly noticed her at this point but was soon to realise why people would think so. The following day we were invited to visit a family on the other side of the small river dividing the sanatorium from the other settlements of the valley. Upon entering the house we realised that the family had a visitor, the aforementioned female diviner or 'lama' as some would have it. She was certainly female, and possibly a lama, but her whole appearance contradicted both statuses.9 She was abrupt and heavier than most Mongolian women, and most of all evoked a strangely hybrid image of a male authority from socialist times dressed up in leather trousers and wearing big golden rings. She had been drinking - alone - something women are not supposed to do in We should, however, keep the following observation in mind: 'Still, a stranger who approaches a yurt on the steppe often gets the impression that a Mongol host is quite cool or reserved compared with people in other parts of the world. For example, as a stranger approaches, the head of the yurt does not make an effort to stand or to smile, but maintains his position, hears what the stranger's business may be, and then with hardly a motion or gesture of cordiality, but a mere motion of the head with chin extended outward or upward, says "suu" ("sit"). Cordiality or hospitality develops very soon as the conversation begins, and the host spontaneously offers tea, other refreshements, or food and would never ask a guest to pay for the hospitality' (Jagchid and Hyer 1979:131-132). 'Female lama' might in itself be seen as a contradiction as almost all lamas are male.</page><page sequence="8">48 Lars Hsjsr Mongolia. The 'lama' was greedily devouring meat and fat, and she was ordering the poor mother of the household to bring her more vodka and food. She was indeed terrifying, and a living paradox at that: a drunk woman, a lama in leather trousers, and - in gendered terms - a hermaphrodite, neither man, nor woman. My fieldwork assistant later told me that he had feared her, and it was obvious that the father of my host family did not like her. She had been very strange, I was told afterwards. Inside the house they were serving drinks and meat from a recently slaughtered sheep. The 'lama' told us that we were lucky to be offered the head of the sheep, and she asked us, in a rather impolite manner, whether we had room in our car to take her with us. The father of my host family replied that we would not be going straight back to the village and therefore could not take her. He obviously lied. After having tasted the offered vodka, we decided to leave after what - for the Mongols - had been a rather unpleasant visit. But just as we went out of the door, the lama asked my fieldwork assistant to stay for a moment. She had to talk to him face to face, she said. Meanwhile we waited outside and on two occasions the impatient father of my host family went into the house to ask them to finish. After a while, my fieldwork assistant finally came out of the house. The famous diviner had told him, or so he informed me, that we would have a safe trip back to the village. While walking back to the sanatorium the father of my host family exclaimed that he did not want to take such a drunk and strange woman into our car. Furthermore, she had been very impolite and had showed no respect, he said, and that was to be expected, as she had once been a younger colleague of the father of my host family in the local school. My fieldwork assistant later told me that she could not have been a genuine lama. A genuine lama would be calm, properly behaved and modest, he said. They agreed that she had only invited us and served the sheep head so as to get a lift. The 'lama' had been invited by the local family to perform a service, and now she could not get back to the village, it seemed. Only very few cars would pass by here. A few days later my fieldwork assistant suddenly told, me what had really happened when he was inside the house with the lama. The lama had told him that my host family was a bad family and that they would try to get as much as possible out of me. She said that we had to be careful. And finally, she rather surprisingly told him that if he passed this information on to anyone, there would be war (dain). Because of that, and because of the anxiety she had caused him, he had not told me straight away. I only saw the lama once more. She seemed drunk and was riding a motorbike through the village. Later on she went back to the capital and more than half a year later I heard that she had died. But</page><page sequence="9">The Anti-Social Contract: Enmity and Suspicion in Northern Mongolia 49 she was somehow proved to be right in her prediction about 'war' - but that is a different story. There is no doubt that the lama, a liminal person 'out of place', as Douglas would put it (1966), produced a fear, a belief in her power, which was immediately effective in itself, simply because her presence alone begged one question: did she have the power of her appearance? Just as her appearance attracted attention, so did her words brand one's memory, at least for a while. But at the very same time, her improper and indecent behaviour was what made her unreliable: Was she an impostor or simply mad? Nonetheless, she had to get the benefit of the doubt, because it was impossible to ignore her and what she said; there was no way of escaping her words once they had been thrown at us and had started to disseminate in our minds and affect our actions towards others. Concern was raised: might the host family indeed be bad people? The fieldwork assistant was afraid and had kept secrets, and was not sure about what to believe. And what about the father of my host family who had undermined the authority of the lama, but who, according to the lama, was not to be trusted anyway. What if the lama was lying? What if the father of my host family was? Or what if the truth - as Favret-Saada has shown it to be the case in French witchcraft (1980) - was only discernible from a position within the system? The premise for relating to each other seemed fundamentally insecure. Indeed everyone could be the 'witch' and there would be no way to know for sure because relations were based on an idiom of deceit; things were not necessarily what they seemed to be. Witch is used here in a rather secular sense justified by the often-made identification of witchcraft with questions of deceit - of having double identities (Ruel 1970). Contained in the interpretation provided by the lama - in the form in which it was transmitted as well as in its content - was the necessity of secrecy, of working behind the surface. An agency, summoned by the power of the transgressive, was set to work, which from the beginning was not known to all - only the fieldwork assistant was told - and which could - by its very quality - not be made known to all. I repeat: 'If he told this to anyone, there would be war'. The representation itself could not be made public and therefore could only be known by some; non-transparency was paramount. The only thing known for sure was that someone was not to be trusted, because relationships were cast in an idiom of mistrust, and often during my fieldwork this 'someone' tended to slip into an 'everyone'. In the village,</page><page sequence="10">50 Lars Hsjer it was a very general attitude to mistrust people outside - and even within - the household or simply to consider them as bad.10 Hel am Although it never came up as an issue in the above story, the Mongolian notion of hel am is the key cultural idiom through which all this is mediated. Hel am is reminiscent of ideas about 'the evil eye' found elsewhere (see e.g. Spooner 1970; Appadurai 1990; Ghosh 2002), although it should be rephrased as 'the evil mouth'. Literally speaking, hel can mean 'tongue', 'language' or 'news/message', whereas am can mean 'mouth', 'words' or 'speech'. Yet, the compound hel am cannot be reduced to something only related to spoken language. Sometimes, hel am is translated as dispute, talk, gossip, wrangle or argument (Hangin 1986; Bawden 1997). It is obvious from people's usage, however, that apart from carrying connotations of dispute, the notion of hel am is taken to involve extraordinary powers causing harm. When a diviner, for example, asks a client if 'there is any hel am', (s)he is clearly referring to an argument but at the same time indicates that this argument is related to the extraordinary misfortune of the client. It was said that there is hel am wherever there are people and that it happens every day and everywhere, and not just in Mongolia. But, as one informant said, hel am might be known better in Mongolia than in any other place, and yet this particular informant's way of describing hel am was taken from a story supposedly written by a Kazakh author. In this story there was a group of fishermen living by a lake. The sons of the fishermen used to start fishing when they reached the age of twelve, but there were certain dangers and customs related to going fishing for the first time. On the day when this is to happen, he is asked by his mother to collect firewood in the forest. The forest is located in the opposite direction of the lake but both the mother and her son will know that he will walk in the direction of the forest for a while, only to later choose another path down to the lake to go fishing. So what is this detour all about? According to the informant, this was done to avoid people's talk - 'now he is going to fish' etc. - because if people did not talk about it, then lus horlol chadahgiii, meaning that the spirit-master would not be able to harm you. The trick of pretending is to avoid 'spreading the word', and thereby danger from the lus, the spirit-master of the water. Misfortune is often attributed to the fact that someone has made a spirit master angry. In short, the Mongolian notion of spirit-masters of the 10 This resonates with the famous Mongolian proverb: Mongols are bad to each other (Mongol Mongoldoo muu) (Bulag 1998: 7). It is, however, obviously not my wish to give the impression that this is the only idiom through which relationships in Mongolia are cast.</page><page sequence="11">The Anti-Social Contract: Enmity and Suspicion in Northern Mongolia 51 land (gazaryn ezed) is based on the idea that certain 'entities' in the landscape have spirit-masters, such as mountains, rivers, trees, plants, rocks etc., and that such spirit-masters are active agents with regard to the well-being of human beings. The curious point in this story, however, is that the power of spirit-masters, thought to have existed as far back as pre-Buddhist Mongolia (Heissig 1980: 102), is explicitly related to talk or gossip. The informant explained that the power attributed to spirit-masters and the power attributed to talk can almost be considered identical. Talk is indeed an extra-ordinary power to be taken into account.11 Writing about rumours, news and information exchange in Mongolia in general, Bulag indicates that: The word medee (information) derives from the notion of medeh, to know. In Mongolian, to know something entails not just knowledge or cognition of it, but control or command of it. If I medeh somebody, this means he is under my control, or under the control of my information. People as objects or targets of information can thus be successfully turned into puppets under the 'mouth' of the knower. The Mongols often say: biye biyeen medenee (they know one another, so they control each other) (1998:168-169). In other words, the (extra)ordinary link between power and control on the one hand and words or information on the other is substantial,12 and an awareness of the distinction between what is said and what is not, attesting to the importance of manipulation, is prominent. Yet, we still need to be a bit more specific about the different workings of hel am. In short, hel am can either be caused by a dispute with a person who is considered particularly dangerous in this regard, that is a disputatious person or a person 'with hel am' Qiel amtai htin), or it can work its way through gossip. The wider implication of the latter 'working' is that hel am is always present as something to be wary about. We saw this with regard to the Kazakh fishermen and it was expressed by various informants who were concerned with the danger of standing out by virtue of being too clever or successful, being involved in a dispute or unsettled relation, or being seen too much in the company of the foreign anthropologist. All engagement with other humans could work its way into the extensive networks of gossiping and, by implication, hel am. That is, on the one hand, hel am can be related to certain persons who are thought to be particularly dangerous to fall out 11 Among the Darhads, the word hov (gossip) is sometimes explicitly associated with hovs (magic) (Pedersen 2002: 206). 12 This implies that the distinction between power and knowledge/information made by Favret-Saada is not applicable here:'[...] witchcraft is spoken words; but these spoken words are power, and not knowledge or information' (1980: 9). Rather, it is the power of knowledge itself that is at issue in the above.</page><page sequence="12">52 Lars Hajer with, and on the other hand it serves as a concomitant of the engagement in relations to other people in general. The two are obviously related. With regard to the first point, hel am could be seen as yet another instance of sociality constituting itself by exclusive practices. Thus, people who are usually considered dangerous with regard to hel am are in some way or another considered marginal as well, so that the two concepts of 'danger' and 'outsider' imply each other. Darhad people were often considered to be such people with whom one should not fall out. The Darhad people are from a neighbouring area in northern Mongolia and they are often disliked and feared; they are the embodiment of 'dangerous outsiders'. This is a well-known line of argument. Gluckman, for example, analyses gossip as a means for group unification and exclusion. In an attempt to seize gossip with an integrative notion of sociality he argues that: [... ] gossip does not have isolated roles in community life, but is part of the very blood and tissue of that life [...] gossip, and even scandal, have important positive virtues. Clearly they maintain the unity, morals and values of social groups. [...] This combination of functions of scandal makes the hostility itself a mode through which the tribe remains united (1963: 308, 312; my emphasis).13 We might ask what happened to the hostile as hostile, when hel am is reduced to an instrument of a pre-given social group. What happened to the reproduction of subjects as separate agencies, partly unknown to each other, in the domain of hel am? What happened to hel am as a specific and in itself 'creative' principle working for disintegration from within: that is, a 'cultural' principle positively working for mistrust, distance and suspense - in short, dissociation - and not just negatively working for the integration of society? In other words, we have to take hel am into account as a relatively stable and well-structured force of disintegration in human life, and not as an arbitrary 'unaccounted for' force that simply serves as - and is reduced to - a means for integration. This brings us to our second point about hel am being a concomitant of the engagement in relations to other people, because when taking this issue into consideration, it is much more difficult to talk in terms of insiders and outsiders, simply because the dangers seem 13 Kapstein represents an opposite functional take when he analyses the ritual exorcism of 'malicious gossip' in Tibet. He implies that gossip is simply a threat to an existing community: 'It is not difficult to imagine that the amplification through gossip of what were at first relatively innocent innuendos might soon endanger the social fabric of the community. The exorcism of gossip therefore addressed an important and psychological need' (1997:528).</page><page sequence="13">The Anti-Social Contract: Enmity and Suspicion in Northern Mongolia 53 to be implied in communication in general making (almost) anyone a potential outsider; enemies lurk everywhere.14 As such, this is the first point made universal, and not just in the sense that any other person can be a potential outsider, but also in the sense that you can become an outsider to yourself. At the end of fieldwork, a drunken friend told me the following: 'You have been living in this area for a long time now and have obviously come to have a lot of enemies'. I could not help thinking that personally I would have expected the opposite, namely that staying in a place for a long time would mean having a lot of friends. Maybe that is why I was told that foreigners and Inner Mongols are naive {genen), whereas Mongols are sly (zal'tai). A local lama warned against involvement with other people: Many people are cursed (haraal hiilgesen htin olon baidag). You should not become involved (orootsoldoh) with those people. Some people have been keeping strong curses for a long time. Those people have to use a lot of energy (energi). We are afraid of that much energy. People have to protect themselves. Most of those people don't know that they are cursed (interview with Red sect lama, 2000). You know that they are many, you do not know who they are, and you know that you should stay away from them. Maybe he was even referring to me, as I was cursed in the sense of being a very visible foreigner with whom any kind of engagement was dangerous. A local friend who did spend too much time with my family and me during fieldwork, has now had to move to the capital, because things have - in her own words - 'gone mad' in the village. The reality of curses is not up for discussion. But, as the lama said, the 'cursed' people are many and indeed, any person and dispute could be with hel am. As such, the matrix of hel am is not just an explanatory framework, retrospectively reading the unfolding of events (Evans-Pritchard 1950; Tambiah 1985: 51),15 or a second-hand reflection of a decisive social structure as some studies of witchcraft assume (see for example Middleton and Winter 1963), but is just as much a projection into the future, i.e. an active principle at work in people's engagement with other people - almost all other people - 14 Lacaze (1996) has similarly noted the current commonality of maledictions, conflicts and revenge among the Darhad peoples. 15 Tambiah writes: 'But when fate does withhold the regularity of events [...] the resort to a retrospective system of evil magic (bulubwalata) with which to reorder their experience and come to terms with failure. As with all classic types of witchcraft, the Trobriand system deals with misfortune ex post, not in terms of "laws of nature" but in terms of deviation from an ideal order of social relations' (1985a:51).</page><page sequence="14">54 Lars Hejer and making danger, suspense and manipulation16 inherently present in communications. Hel am is conceptualising such relationships as much as being conceptualised by them. It is - as a way of anticipating, and engaging with, others - just as much about an anxious and cautious engagement in human affairs as it is a rationalisation of past events. And it does not lead to practices of active exchange, but implies activities of dissociation, 'abstaining' and silence; i.e. active practices of ignorance, withdrawal and doing by not doing. If not cautious, you come to stand out, and to be objectified as sticking out - and sticking out simply by virtue of being objectified - implies an uncontrolled existence in a representational domain of gossip. You become the puppet of other people's mouth. Informal talk is crucial to the spread of information in the village, and gossip gains momentum when it comes to pieces of information standing out. Gossip is characterised by its ability to circulate horizontally, incestuously crossing any kinship and household boundaries, and it is therefore 'public', i.e. accessible to everyone, without being staged, i.e. accessible to everyone at the same time. Gossip gains power from its mere existence by catching and demanding attention; it produces similarity from similarity. But gossip as a communicative medium is also characterised by its elusive agency. Obviously gossip can have a beginning, such as when someone spreads a rumour that only he or she knows about, but gossip as a medium or knowledge form constitutes agency as elusive, moving utterances from the sphere of emanating from a subject ('I say') to the sphere of reported speech ('it was said'). As such, it discards subjective agency. Gossip constitutes itself as a knowledge form of the 'objectively possible'; almost no one can be held accountable for its truth-value, nor confirm it for sure. Yet the information is present as a possibility, often counter weighed by no other possibility, as a definite possible. It is not certain, but nevertheless casts its own spell on reality by being the only possibility available. This is an effective domain of affect, because the representations actively perform, or enact, by virtue of touching people and by virtue of pertaining to their referent, the one being talked about. This is something very close to a merging of sympathetic and contagious magic, because hel am implies that representations - as copies - touch people. Sticking out on your own (by negating commonality) mobilises 16 Indeed an informant said that Mongols are the best actors (jujigchin) of all. When another informant mentioned her seven favourite proverbs, they included: 'Not everyone laughing is a friend, not everyone angry is an enemy' (ineesen btihen nohor bish, uurlasan biihen daisan bish), and 'a man is motley (malicious etc.) inside, a snake is motley outside' (hiinii ereen dotroo, mogoin ereen gadnaa).</page><page sequence="15">The Anti-Social Contract: Enmity and Suspicion in Northern Mongolia 55 attention and, paradoxically, puts your life in the hand of others. Gell writes: Vulnerability stems from the bare possibility of representation, which cannot be avoided. Sorcery beliefs endure, and are highly explanatory, because vulnerability to sorcery is the unintended consequence of the diffusion of the person into the milieu, via a thousand causal influences and pathways, not all of which can be mirrored or controlled (1998: 103; my emphasis). This is written about volt or image sorcery but could hardly be a more apt description of the dangers of gossip and hel am. The point is, however, that in Mongolia this dispersion of the person should be avoided at all costs, because hel am is the danger of a self becoming an other's perspective. Hel am is the danger of connecting Now, there is a certain logic implied in the working of hel am and this logic can be generalised to a much wider domain of Mongolian life so that we might instead speak of representations or articulations as spells in general. A Mongol might for example maintain that it is a kind of hel am - i.e. 'a bad spell' - to claim that a particular person is good, or to say - when going to the market in the provincial capital to seek out transportation for the capital - that you will definitely find someone who can take you. Such statements or thoughts stating or pointing to something positive will lead to their opposite it is believed - in line with one of my informants we can call this small (jijigen) white hel am. On the other hand, actions, statements and thoughts implying something bad will set in train a sequence of events leading to an unfortunate event. Although hel am might not be used in this regard, the latter instance is closely related to the logic of black hel am. What is really at issue in such objectifications is a knowledge form of 'binary determination' - good/bad etc. - most clearly expressed through language. This knowledge form should be avoided, because it is too efficacious, not only in the sense of spreading the clear word ('she is bad') and thereby making it a real and successful representation, but also in the sense of placing it in a discourse of binary knowledge where the effect can just as well be the opposite of the statement, because opposites are integral to each other. If claiming that someone is good with certainty - thereby suspending suspense - you are, so to speak, simultaneously getting in touch with 'evil', which is implied and only momentarily concealed by its opposite ('good') and therefore brought to be a potential. As such, the danger is a representational knowledge form of either/or, because it somehow implies both/and.</page><page sequence="16">56 Lars H.0jer When moving into this general domain of the use of hel am, a whole range of other spell-like phenomena comes to mind such as the fact that drivers in the Mongolian capital only very rarely fasten their seatbelts since this seems to imply a future accident. Informants in the capital confirmed the credibility of this interpretation, and so as to underscore its validity, one of them drew attention to a Mongol proverb: 'what comes out of your mouth will be fulfilled in the future'. This was her own English translation but a more direct and precise translation would read: 'A (good) omen from the mouth is an eternal(ly good) omen (iamny belegees ashdyn beleg)'. Although it is significant to note the use of 'mouth' (am(ny)) once more, the general implication was that what is done now will be an omen for the future. Putting on the seat belt is like speaking of accidents, something you are not supposed to do in Mongolia, and the analogy to hel am is obvious. This is also why Mongols can be worried about filling out insurance papers (A. Hiirelbaatar, personal communication). Where e.g. Danish people often try to tame the course of events by security-enhancing measures, the Mongols often seem to work with a logic implying that such extra ordinary measures will conjure up misfortunes. The measures are, so to speak, self-made omens;17 i.e. actions, thoughts or words casting a spell on the sequence of events by creating a mind-reciprocal bond between events in the sense that no events that are sequentially related to other events (driving car - fastening seat belts - car accidents) will stand by themselves.18 As such, it is not the causal connections between events in a sequence of events that are at stake, but the fact that all events in the 17 This is very similar to my use of 'spell'. When I use self-made omen it is in the sense of signs coming from the activity of humans themselves and not, as 'omen' is generally used, as a sign giving itself to humans from the outside, but it is also to draw attention to the logical affinities between spells and omens. The coming-from-the-outside omens, as they are indigenously defined, are the kind of omens analysed in an article by Caroline Humphrey (1976). Humphrey shows - from the analytical perspective of an outsider - how the recognition of such omen-signs are also bound up with human concerns, i.e. human intentionality, but still they are not considered a human creation by the natives such as the ones dealt with above. Rather, they are thought to present themselves to humans. This is a precarious distinction though, because something apparently done by an agent might not be done by him- or herself as it were (it might have been accidental, i.e. something not wanted, or a spirit acting through a person). This obviously raises all sorts of questions about where agency originates. 18 This notion is useful because it also captures the space in which previous happenings or connections cast their spell on present and future actions. An informant, for example, told me about the tragic death of her mother when she was a child. She had received the news about her mother when she was laughing and having fun with other children. Since then, she had been careful about being too happy.</page><page sequence="17">The Anti-Social Contract: Enmity and Suspicion in Northern Mongolia 57 sequence are necessarily implied in each other in a kind of teleological bundle so that 'fastening seat belt - driving car - accident' could just as well be 'accident - seat belt - driving car'. The logic is that you would not wear a seat belt if there was not going to be an accident and, by implication, that wearing a seat belt entails an accident. By carrying out the act (fastening a seat belt), you are carrying out the result of the future (accident) so that the future becomes past for the present. In the realm of spells and omens - of self-fulfilling prophecies - the present has got implications as a future for the future, i.e. as anticipation. Thus, by doing so, you commit yourself to one specific future. This would explain why 'Mongols take great care to avoid remarks or words that carry a bad omen or connotation' (Jagchid and Hyer 1979:134). As the last quote indicates, we are not just dealing with temporally separate events, but also with a more general relation between representations and what they refer to. Humphrey writes that: All Mongols avoid casual reference to the names of dead people, predatory animals and certain mountains, rivers and springs, which are considered to be inhabited by spirits, and which in the past have caused various natural catastrophes. It is thought that the casual pronunciation of these names would catch the attention of the spirits with possibly disastrous consequences to the speaker [...] Names are thought to represent something of the essence of the person, and the pronunciation of a name in a sense brings that person into being even if they are physically absent (1993: 75-76)&gt;9 Name taboos are not only attached to names per se, she writes, but also to 'words which have the function of names in the crucial respect of having the capacity to attract the attention of the person named' (Humphrey 1993: 78); that is, they have the ability to 'sensually' attract attention by using similar sounds. This is further testified by the fact that whereas similar-sounding words are tabooed, synonyms are not; the danger is not at the level of meaning behind the surface. The sound, by its mere resemblance to the sound of a tabooed word, draws attention to a reference by virtue of this reference taking part in the sound and being dangerously loaded with power and ambiguity, and therefore being inherently attention-drawing. Such a reference could be dead people, elderly male in-laws, spirits of mountains etc. Sounds are empowered 19 This resonates strongly with Freud who writes that: '[...] savages regard a name as an essential part of a man's personality and as an important possession: they treat words in every sense as things [...] They are never ready to accept a similarity between two words as having no meaning; they consistently assume that if two things are called by similar-sounding names this must imply the existence of some deep-lying point of agreement between them' (1950: 63).</page><page sequence="18">58 Lars H0jer with this evocative ability by virtue of being phonetically related to the tabooed word proper and thereby to its immanent reference. Humphrey writes that: [...] to speak the name aloud does not merely make the named-one look up, as it were, but actually focuses attention on the pronouncer of the name. It is to avoid such potentially dangerous focusing on oneself that each person takes care not to say the name (1993: 89). Yet, this attention seems to be based on a too intimate relation that evokes the Other's other, so to speak, because it is possible to refer to such 'persons' by using respect and distance, i.e. to refer to them simply as Others. Euphemisms, such as boohoi instead of chon for 'wolf', or 'merciful' or 'gracious' - hairhan - instead of uul (mountain) and mogoi (snake), serve to prevent this dangerous attention. By using euphemisms you avoid challenging - i.e. calling into being as equal and opposed agencies affecting each other - the certainty of such hierarchical relations of respect. As mentioned earlier, it is partly the lack of obvious agency that makes gossip as a medium able to proliferate talk, because contrary to the quote above, the speaker is not at the centre of attention. The real attention-catching subjects are the ones being talked about. People in the village were afraid of what we might rephrase as 'the attention-catching function of gossip', of the power of talk to summon, maybe not exactly what is being talked about, but moods and intentionalities (anger, jealousy etc. towards a person). It could be claimed that moods and intentionalities are so supernatural - as in hel am - exactly because they are so real, and this would explain why it does not make much sense for Mongols to speak in such oppositions when it comes to hel am. Generalised witchcraft What we have dealt with until now is dangerous communications or what we might call generalised witchcraft as a deconstruction of sociality or culture from within. When addressing such cultural traditions that split - or keep apart - from within, as it were - when attending to the reproduction of true distance, of suspicion and suspense - we are not simply talking about 'mirroring each other as enemies' in the sense that you are both victims through the other's eye, i.e. that you are similarly different to each other. This would seem to be the implication of an animist-perspectivist theory - a present rendition of 'reciprocity', we might say - to enmity and otherness. I quote from Viveiros de Castro: [...] humaris see humans as humans, animals as animals and spirits (if they see them) as spirits; however animals (predators) and spirits see</page><page sequence="19">The Anti-Social Contract: Enmity and Suspicion in Northern Mongolia 59 humans as animals (as prey) to the same extent that animals (as prey) see humans as spirits or as animals (predators). By the same token, animals and spirits see themselves as humans: they perceive themselves as (or become) anthropomorphic beings when they are in their own houses or villages [... ] (1998: 470). Animals are to humans as humans are to animals; in short, the reflexive form of their respective points of View - their humanity or subjectivity - is identical. 'The space between nature and society is itself social', as Viveiros de Castro points out (1998: 473), and hence a continuity or similarity between species, as well as the possibility for becoming Other, is presupposed in animism. And we could also say that it is presupposed in the Melanesian perspectivism outlined by Strathern, where she writes: People's positioning with respect to one another entails each party perceiving the relationship simultaneously from its own and from the other's point of view [...] Perceiving another's viewpoint is also an anticipation of it; and people forever regard themselves as moving from one position to another (1988: 271). Now my query with this kind of - dare I say - 'social ontology' is the extent to which the possibility that 'persons can become each other' is generated; i.e. the extent to which other perspectives are, if not taken, then at least known - even in warfare. Harrison writes about certain Melanesian societies that violence was not about an absence of social ties but was rather 'a reaction to an excessive closeness and intimacy, a too intense sociability'. People needed to create distance because they were too close (Harrison 1995); in short, Self and Other had to be separated because they had become, or simply were, too intimate. Yet, my point is that in rural Mongolia such intimacy need not be presupposed, and that the 'social alter' is not only an alter to an ego, ultimately presupposing similarity of perspective. In rural Mongolia others are mistrusted - and relationships of suspense generated - because the Other is made to be, and made to be anticipated as, an anxiety-producing suspicious other, even prior to any engagement. Thus, when speaking of this, inter human relationships are not just given, and based on known - i.e. essentially similar - Others, because this would downplay the crucial element of uncertainty and suspense, of anticipating otherness as otherness. This is where relating is an anticipation of the other as not quite known; the other is processed - i.e. 'made same' - not just as Other to a Self, or as Self to an Other, but as 'genuine other'. In short, you are made to know that you do not know the other, and anxiety and suspense are generated and anticipated. These are uncertain anticipations proper - and only with difficulty qualify as relations - and their reproduction</page><page sequence="20">60 Lars Hejer might be outlined as an experiential logic, or modality, implied in the case story from the beginning, to which we will now return. Because it is my point that with regard to Mongolia we might operate with an idea of a very generalised witchcraft in the seemingly simple sense that anyone is a potential witch. Or rather more 'secularly' - as the idea is mostly not expressed in extraordinary terms - we might call it a radical suspicion which bears formal similarities to Taussig's idea about a kind of regressive sorcery: [...] sorcery invokes a mode of explanation that undermines its starting point, while the starting point ineluctably leads to its undermining. In posing this double-bind as to its own nature, sorcery derealizes reality as well. The formula 'sorcery explains coincidence' prevents us from appreciating the extent to which coincidence and sorcery pose questions concerning one's life environment, opening out the world as much as closing it in (1987: 465). Generalised witchcraft de-realises social, i.e. relational, reality and promotes otherness per se, because one's attentiveness to others is predicated on its own undermining; it is anxious and anchored in suspense. As in the case study from the beginning of my article, a 'double-bind' is reproduced in the social domain so that the third party, the one evoking representations of witchcraft, could herself be a witch; somehow it is the famous Liar paradox made operational in the social realm. The domain is characterised by deceit and the anticipation of deceit, and hence by a radical division between self and other, inner and outer. This is an important mode of 'social' life in Mongolia; not the witches as such, but the logic that is witchcraft. The relation undermines itself in such a domain of generalised suspicion, because extrovert attentiveness or projection causes introvert withdrawal and defence. As such, enmity is a mode of relating where you - paradoxically - only exchange perspectives in the sense that you do not. You approach each other by creating distance. In this domain other agencies are agencies exactly by virtue of being unknown, and people are concerned with avoiding being caught up in an exchange of perspectives with such unknown others.20 Engaging with them, i.e. taking their unknown perspective, mean that you become unknown to yourself - i.e. to the one seeing in the first place. You loose yourself. Indeed you loose perspective. As such, this domain is a domain of avoidance and withdrawal - and maybe even of physical dispersal as we saw it with our friend who moved to the capital - and also a possible domain of innovation we might add. The generation of division and suspense is 20 Cf. the danger of becoming infected with non-human otherness among the Darhad people living west of Lake Hovsgol (Pedersen 2001: 422-423)</page><page sequence="21">The Anti-Social Contract: Enmity and Suspicion in Northern Mongolia 61 only with difficulty captured by a notion of relatedness, ultimately assuming that you can take each other's point of view. Rather we have to attend to the generation of distance - which is not just another kind of intimacy, but distance proper - and the active avoidance of the Other's other as a compelling agent. We have to attend to the avoidance of being drawn into an economy of responding. To conclude, hel am as anticipation instigates the avoidance of society and denotes the danger of communication. In other words, hel am is the danger of culture as representations and the danger of society as reciprocity. In this sense we can see it as a warning against instituting society, or a warning against the Levi-Straussian incest taboo as a move from indifference to difference and alliance (Levi-Strauss 1969). Rather, hel am is a move towards indifference. It concerns the danger of making a difference, and by not making a difference you stay different in the sense of avoiding a distributed personhood (cf. Gell 1998). As such, you might say - in Levi-Straussian terminology - that what I have tried to convey is culture's fight against itself or against its own transgression of nature. I hope that I have managed to spell out my argument. Ironically, if this is the case, I should now be facing the danger of hel am, of having put my life in the hands of the reader.
