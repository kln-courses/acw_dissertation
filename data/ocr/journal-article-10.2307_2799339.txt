UCKO University College London Egypt has been subject to numerous infiltrations, contacts and colonisations throughout its long history, but to what extent incomers contributed to the gene pool of the population is not clear. Most speculation in the past has been directed to the origin rather than the degree of racial mixing of both foreigners and local inhabitants at different periods of Egyptian history. Such interpretations have been based primarily on artistic representations. For example, Kees (I96I: 36) wrote: 'Judging by the small sculptures from Hierakonpolis, the reliefs and rock paintings, the people who were in authority, including the victorious Egyptian kings, still belonged to the mysterious delicately formed race with short skulls from which the Amratians developed' (see also Petrie I90I: 252-4). Such interpretations of artistic representations may be correct, but they suffer from the difficulty that both con- clusions and the assessment of their significance must inevitably be speculative (see Morse, Brothwell &amp; Ucko I964: 524-8; Ucko I96$: 222-3). This is attested by the tendency in the past (summarised by Chantre I904) to postulate all sorts of improbable racial amalgams in Egypt: mixtures of people representing a singular variety of groups (viz. Libyan, Caucasian, Arab, Pelasgian, Negro, Bushman, Mongol, Hamitic, Hamito-Semitic-even Red Indian and Australian aboriginal) were alleged to have migrated into the Nile valley. The fantastic nature of these speculations was exposed by Elliot Smith (I9II), although even he recognised an Armenoid admixture with Early Dynastic populations. The work undertaken in about I900 on skeletal remains also purported to recognise numerous races with continued fusions between several sub-sections of them throughout the history of Egypt (e.g. MacIver i9oo; Thomson &amp; MacIver I905; Petrie I906). Indeed, Keith (I90$: 92) complained that the literature at that time included hopeless contradictions of three, six, one and two races. Such contradictions still persist despite the work of Morant (i925) who recognised merely a single upper and a single lower Egyptian type: for example, Falkenburger (I947) divided skeletal material into Cromagnon, Negro and Mediterranean types. This confusion may be surprising in the light of all the material available from Egypt but can to some extent be understood in the context of Egyptian history (see below) with its frequent and intensive contacts with 'foreigners' from neigh- bouring countries. Undoubtedly, however, the major element leading to confusion has been the lack of usable genetical markers in osteological material for evaluating</page><page sequence="2">5S2 A. CAROLINE BERRY, R. J. BERRY AND PETER J. UCKO population movements and mnixing (see Berry, Evans &amp; Sennitt I967; Berry &amp; Smith Ms.). This article is an attempt to measure change in ancient Egypt by using non-metrical skull variants to characterise different samples genetically, rather than by the two 'classical' sources of information-artistic representations and metrical evaluations of skeletal material. External human influences on Egypt To give the necessary background to the interpretation of studies on hiuman remains, it is necessary at the outset to outline and discuss the more important contacts of Egypt with the outside world, for the extent and effects of some of these are not generally known.

Roman and Byzantine Periods For the predynastic period (before c. 3,200 B.C.) (see table i) textual proof of foreign incursions is, of course, lacking, but the change in material culture which defines the beginning of the Gerzean culture has often been interpreted by Egypto- logists as reflecting the arrival of a new people into Egypt. This assumed change in population is commonly correlated with linguistic analysis of ancient Egyptian which finds that the language comprises both 'Hamitic' and 'Semitic' elements. The 'Semitic' elements are presumed to have arrived with the bearers of the Gerzean culture (e.g. Baumgartel I965: 21). Invasion or infiltration by people from outside Egypt is also generally assumed to explain the apparently sudden emergence of literacy, kingship and urbanisation at the time of the founding of the first literate dynasty (c. 3,200 B.C.). This assumption is based on the appearance of a variety of 'foreign' elements in the material culture of Egypt at this time (e.g. cylinder seals of Mesopotainian type, motifs resembling those of Jemdet Nasr Mesopotamia, panelled brick architecture, etc.) which apparently had no ante- cedents in prehistoric Egypt. At the same time there is evidence from the analysis of pottery types of contact with Palestine. This was probably a two-way trading relationship which continued throughout the First Dynasty and which by the end of the archaic period (c. 2,700 B.C.) culminated in a permanent Egyptian trading relationship with the port of Byblos on the Levantine coast. During the first</page><page sequence="3">GENETICAL CHANGE IN ANCIENT EGYPT 553 dynasties of Egypt also there was, judging from stone vessel types, close contact between Egypt and Crete. Throughout the history of Egypt, texts refer to the inhabitants of the modem republic of the Sudan by different names, sometimes describing them by habitat, making it clear that they were considered foreigners who spoke languages distinct from Ancient Egyptian. To the west lived several different groups of people to whom the Egyptians gave particular names and whom they not only described as foreigners but also distinguished from themselves in artistic representations. At many periods in its history Egypt received 'visitors' both from these areas and from further afield. For example, already in the early Fourth Dynasty 7,000 Nubians were carried off to Egypt and presumably placed in servitude. There is also inscriptional evidence later in the Old Kingdom that Nubians were employed in the Egyptian army. During the first Intermediate Period there were probably incursions into the delta from the north. In the Twelfth Dynasty Egypt may have controlled Palestine and Syria, and 'northern' peoples began arriving in Egypt either to settle or to trade. So great became the influence of these people that eventually, on the fragmentation of the administration, in c. I,720 B.C. they were able to proclaim themselves as pharaohs and gain power over northern Egypt. There is little evidence that this 'Hyksos' period was due to any large scale invasion of Egypt. Following the reconquest of Egypt by the Theban Dynasty (New Kingdom), Egypt established an empire which at its greatest extent stretched from the Euph- rates to the fourth cataract. Great numbers of captives were deliberately carried off, some to be used in labour forces and some to be distributed as rewards to Egyptian officers and soldiers. On the highest political plane, pharaohs at this time con- tracted diplomatic marriages with foreign princesses from various parts of the Near East, but these will have affected the racial composition of the court and its de- pendendes rather than of the bulk of the people. Mercenaries during the early part of the New Kingdom were mainly from upper Nubia. Later on people called the Sherden were much employed, and rewarded for their services with plots of land which they and their descendants (like other veterans) cultivated (iCerny i965). These Sherden were the fore-runners of numerous peoples who descended upon the eastern Mediterranean littoral during the thirteenth century B.C. At first many of these incursions were probably peaceful. 'These roamings of the Meshwesh and the Libu in upper Egypt were but a ramification of a large scale penetration of Libyan tribes in the north, in the delta, and below Memphis at Heracleopolis. This penetration was probably on the whole peaceful and resulted in the occupation of the western delta where Libyans, under their chiefs, founded a number of principalities each with an important town as its centre' (c:erny I965: is). In c. 950 B.C., however, one Libyan family set itself up as rulers of Egypt and for the next 200 years Egypt was governed by rival 'Libyan' dynasties. Fronm c. 730 B.C. Egypt fell under the rule of the Egyptianised state of Napata on the upper Nile. This rule was ended by the Assyrian conqueror Ash- urbanipal in 663 B.C. There is no evidence under either of these foreign regimes of any large scale incursion of foreigners into Egypt except for a few southern officials mainly in the Thebaid. Assyria fell a few years after her conquest of Egypt and a native dynasty ruled</page><page sequence="4">554 A. CAROLINE BERRY, R. J. BERRY AND PETER J. UCKO in Egypt until the conquest by the Achaemenid Cambyses in S2S B.C. Only the highest officials in the land were expatriate Persians, for Achaemenid policy in- volved ruling through the native bureaucracy. During the Saite period the first Greek trading colony was set up in the Egyptian delta. Alexander conquered Egypt in 332 B.C. and after his death large numbers of Greek soldiers were settled in the delta and the Fayum. By the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus the bulk of the administration had passed into Greek hands, cities with Greek citizenship and special privileges had been founded and the Fayum had become largely a Greek province. There is no doubt that Egyptians and Greeks lived side by side and intermarried. The Roman conquest of Egypt made little difference to this situation; Greeks continued to run the country, the Roman presence being marked only by legion- aries and certain high officials. Despite Egypt's long history of contacts with foreign peoples, therefore, it is clear that there is in fact little evidence to suggest continued racial admixture be- tween the indigenous Egyptian population and foreign peoples to the extent that significant changes to the basic Egyptian gene pool occurred throughout Egyptian history. Kees's statement (I96I: 34) that Egypt was 'a land with ... an ethnically disparate population' must depend largely on the influence of' Semitic' northerners in the delta in the second millennium B.C., the degree of Nubian influence south of Edfu throughout Egyptian history, and on the extent of Greek penetration into lower Egypt and the Fayum in the third and second centuries B.C. Procedure The only direct and objective evidence about population mixing is from the study of human remains. Such investigations are especially important for the predynastic period because they are the only means of checking deductions about populations which are exclusively based on archaeological analysis of material culture. Although the genetical interpretation of craniometric differences is difficult (e.g. De Beer I965) even with moderm statistical analyses (e.g. Crichton I966), great weight has often been placed on slight archaeological evidence where analysis of craniometric data has suggested the arrival of a new 'race' during pre- dynastic or protodynastic times (see discussion in Arkell &amp; Ucko I965: I53, I55). Hence it seemed worthwhile to re-investigate much of the available material using non-metrical variants as genetical indicators. Although non-metrical variants have been used by anthropologists for many years (reviewed by Brothwell I963; I965), it is only since their genetical control in the mouse was determined by Griuneberg and his co-workers (Griineberg I963) that their usefulness in comparisons of non-living populations could be appreciated. The extrapolation of mouse genetics to man is not without danger, but both human family and population studies on non-metrical variation (reviewed by Berry in press) support the contention that the variants are inherited in a similar way in both mice and men. Furthermore Howe &amp; Parsons (I967) have shown the environ- mental factors to be of little importance when information on incidence of a large number of variants is combined. There is no doubt that non-metrical variants have considerable advantages over morphological measurements for many anthro-</page><page sequence="5">GENETICAL CHANGE IN ANCIENT EGYPT 555 pological purposes. In practical terms scoring of variation is quick and easy; age (at any rate in mature individuals) and sex do not affect non-metrical variation; lack of correlations between characters makes the computation of multivariate statistics much simpler than is the case for metrical characters; and there are grounds for believing that estimates of divergence between samples based on differences in non-metrical variant incidence more accurately reflect genetical differences than statistics calculated from metrical data (Berry &amp; Smith Ms). All the skulls we used were classified for thirty non-metrical variants (for anatomical descriptions, see Berry &amp; Berry I967) by one of us (A.C.B.). Juveniles were excluded. The frequencies of each variant in sixteen different population samples were tabulated. There are two ways of interpreting such data. The first is to take each variant separately and trace its incidence in different populations. This has been the normal procedure with past workers (e.g. Hess I945; Brothwell I96I). However a more digestible method of assimilating the crude data is to calculate a multivariate distance statistic based on all the variants. There are several ways of doing this: Laughlin &amp; Jorgensen (I956) and Brothwell (I958) have used a version of Penrose's 'size and shape' statistic, but we prefer a method devised by C. A. B. Smith and first used to measure change in inbred strains of mice by Grewal (I962). In this method a single 'measure of divergence' is calculated between each pair of popu- lations. The validity of estimating genetical distance in this way has been discussed by Berry (I964), Berry, Evans &amp; Sennitt (I967), Howe &amp; Parsons (I967), and Berry &amp; Smith (Ms). The measure of divergence between two populations (I, 2) of size n1 and n2 is taken as (01i02)2-(iIn.+ i/n2) for any variant, where 0 is the angular transformation of the percentage incidence (p), measured in radians, such that O= sin-' (i - 2p). This has the advantage over the more usual angular transformation (0= sin' VIp in degrees) that the variance of 0 in a sample of size n is nearly i/n independently of the value of n, instead of 820-7n. The mean measure of divergence for all thirty characters in two populations is a quantitative expres- sion of the separation of the populations. The virtual absence of correlation between variants makes permissible the averaging of measures of divergence for individual variants without having to perform the complex adjustments necessary in computing similar statistics from skeletal measurements, which tend to be much more highly correlated (Rao I948). A standard principal component analysis has also been carried out on the raw data. Samples classified We used three criteria in selecting our material: I. Accessibility: all the material we used was preserved either in the Sub- Department of Anthropology, British Museum (Natural History) (hereafter referred to as B), or the Duckworth Laboratory of the Faculty of Archaeology and Anthropology of the University of Cambridge (referred to as C). As far as we know all the major collections of Egyptian skeletal material in Great Britain are at one or other of these places with the exception of two small series from Aswan and El Amrah in the anatomy departments of Edinburgh and Aberdeen universities, respectively.</page><page sequence="6">5S6 A. CAROLINE BERRY, R. J. BERRY AND PETER J. UCKO 2. Reliable dated context: it is unfortunate that much of the existing literature is based on inadequately dated material (for example, see Massoulard's (I949) despairing efforts to separate dated from undated predynastic material). 3. Availability of at least thirty crania in reasonable condition in each series (although one of our series only contained twenty-eight specimens). Since it was necessary to study actual specimens, we were not able to make use of a number of series for which archaeological and metrical data were available (e.g. Jackson I937: I44-53), but for which the skulls were lost, re-buried or non- identifiable from existing records. Furthermore we had to limit our study to material available in Great Britain. We classified sixteen samples from fourteen localities (fig. i), a total of 775 skulls: I. Forty-eight Badarian specimens from the site of Badari (C). These form part of the material measured by Stoessiger (I927) and Derry (Morant 1935) and can be presumed to be well dated to the Badarian period. It is not impossible that a few specimens were of later predynastic date from the site of Deir Tasa, but wherever it has proved possible to check particular graves in which crania were found, they have been indubitably Badarian. 2, 3, 4. Material from later predynastic periods is available from the sites of Naqada, Abydos, Diospolis Parva, Hierakonpolis and El Amrah, but little of it can be reliably dated. For the present study it was decided to avoid combining predynastic material from different sites. As a consequence, material from all sites except Naqada and Hierakonpolis was too small to be used. Several hundred skulls were excavated by Petrie at Naqada (C), and he apparently first divided the material into three groups: SD 30-40, SD 4I-69, SD 70-80. However this left many examples which could not be dated (Fawcett I9OI-2: 422; Petrie I906: 42), so tllat in the literature the whole series has often been combined as homogeneous and representing the 'Naqada race' (e.g. Fawcett I9OI-2; Crichton I966). This procedure is illegitimate and has been attacked by several authors (e.g. Thomson &amp; Maclver I9o5: I3I, Morant i925). In the present study only those specimens which could be identified with sequence dated graves have been included. Although there is dispute about the value of sequence dating (see Arkell &amp; Ucko i965), this seems the only way to date this particular material. Sequence dates have been adopted as they were published in Petrie (I920: plates 5I-2). We have separated the material into: 2. an early predynastic group of 28 specimens (SD 30-39); 3. a general predynastic group of 32 specimens (definitely of predynastic date, but which could not be more accurately assigned particular sequence dates); 4. a late predynastic group of 30 specimens (SD 43-69). Specimens dated to SD 40-2 have been omitted to avoid any overlap between the first two groups. There must remain some doubt as to the accuracy of dating of ten skulls from graves with numbers below goo, because they may have origi- nated from Ballas and not Naqada. S. Fifty skulls (from a total of c. i5o at C) from Hierakonpolis which must presumably be of late predynastic date, although no more accurate information is available (Quibell &amp; Green I902: 22; Garstang I907: 136-7; Kemp I963: 26).</page><page sequence="7">GENETICAL CHANGE IN ANCIENT EGYPT 557 M1EDITERR/NEAN Je M Gizeho PENINSULla ' F o olTarkhan OFSIN~ql Sedment ? &gt;\1 'n,* X~Boadri | Abydos) Qurneh ANoqad Thebes\ Hierakonpolis) \ L IBYA N fst Catsxroct Aswon 0 o &gt; L O WER NUBIA4 t o s DESERT / tXv \ UPPER 7l NUBIA Kierma 0 100 200 / mile's %Jbe/ Moyca FIGURE 1.

A sample of 62 skulls of Dynasty I date from the royal tombs at Abydos (B and C), all from graves which bordered around the pharaohs' large tombs, being most likely those of craftsmen and workers. 7. Fifty -skulls (C) from Tarkhan, said to be of Dynasty I-II, but about which no further details are known (Petrie I9I4: 43-4). 8. Fifty skulls (C) from Sedment, said to be of Dynasty IX, but about which nothing further is known (Petrie &amp; Brunton I924; Woo I930-I). 9. Fifty-four skulls (C) from Qumeh, said to be of Dynasty XI, but again about which nothing further is known. io. Seventy-eight skulls (C) from Qau: the material was initially divided into that which could be accepted as falling within Brunton's relative sequence VI-VIII (44 specimens), and that falling within his sequence IX-X (34 specimens) (Brunton I927: 5-8), but the two groups did not differ and so were combined. i i. Fifty skulls (from over a thousand in the 'E' series at C: Davin &amp; Pearson 1924) from the site of Gizeh, dated to Dynasties XXVI-XXX. Although this cemetery of Memphis included the graves of many foreigners, all those that could be checked proved to have Egyptian names and it can reasonably be assumed that this is a good Saite sample (Petrie I907: 29). I2. Fifty-two skulls (B) from the site of Hawara which although largely im- possible to date accurately cannot have been earlier than first century A.D. and not later than fourth century A.D. In all cases where it was possible to correlate human remains with grave details they proved to be 'Greek' (i.e. people of widely differ- ing racial origins who had acquired Greek citizenship). 13, 14. We made use of two samples from the upper Nile valley in Nubia: 5o skulls (C) from Kerma dated to the Twelfth to Thirteenth Dynasties (Collett I93 3), where the population has often been assumed to be quite distinct from that of Egypt (see below), and 32 skulls (C) from the site ofJebel Moya above Khartoum (Mukherjee, Rao &amp; Trevor i9SS). I5, i6. Finally we included two non-Nile population samples: S4 skulls from Lachish in Palestine (B) of about 700 B.C. (Risdon I939), and 56 Ashanti skulls (B) about which no accurate details of provenance are known. Results The frequencies of individual variants are set out in table 2. In some cases the frequencies are based on lower numbers than the totals for the population, because of the need to use damaged specimens. Measures of divergence together with estimates of the standard errors of those statistics are given in table 3. Certain samples did not differ from each other and were combined for most of the comparisons. Table 3 also shows the numbers of differences in the frequencies of individual variants 'significant' (according to a conventional test of significance) at both the 5 per cent. and i per cent. probability levels for all population comparisons made. Finally we carried out a principal component analysis to test whether the measures of divergence between populations were usually the result of differences in the frequencies of only a few variants, or whether a number of different variants were normally involved. The results of this analysis are shown in table 4.</page><page sequence="9">GENETICAL CHANGE IN ANCIENT EGYPT 559 ;q &gt; So o 6 m + oo o oo o 'n o s t+o??-m?H H i o~ en "I " .^ t.Hoo&gt; tebt.ooom o X o ; o o ooc D ob C en t- \0 0? el 00e X m 08 \ 0 t- It \0 knr \O &gt; O .% ,m.

This is a weighted combination of the variant frequency. Discussion There are no means at the moment of measuring total genetical differences between populations in terms of numbers of gene substitutions (McLaren &amp; Walker I966). With the techniques at our disposal, all we can do is express pheno- typic differences in arbitrary units. Furthermore it is difficult to assess what is a 'significant' genetical difference between two samples. The convention has been adopted in the present context to regard a measure of divergence as indicating a meaningful difference ('significant') if it is more than double its standard error. Divergences which are greater than twice their standard error are indicated by an asterisk in table 3; a double asterisk indicates a value of over three for measure of divergence divided by its standard error. Results have been presented in this way to make clear the basic problem of deciding whether the non-metrical method is useful for genetical conmparisons of these particular human populations. All except one of the comparisons involving Keirma, Lachish and the Ashanti are distinguished from all other populations by a value twice their standard error (and the majority of comparisons between Lachish and the Ashanti and other popula- tions by values greater than three times their standard error). As these are exactly the populations which we would expect, on cultural and archaeological evidence, biologically to differ most from the Egyptians of any period, it seems reasonable to accept that the method gives meaningful results for this human skeletal material. Moreover about three populations only would be expected to be 'significantly different' by chance, whereas there are 52 'significant differences' in table 3. Further support for the validity of this non-metrical analysis can be seen in the fact that the Early and General predynastic Naqada samples did not differ from each other, that the Archaic material from two different sites was homogeneous, and that the Middle Kingdom samples from different sites-as well as the two samples originally divided from the site of Qau (see above)-were indistinguishable from each other. These three homogeneous groups were used for most of the</page><page sequence="12">562 A. CAROLINE BERRY, R. J. BERRY AND PETER J. UCKO comparisons, as all made good archaeological and cultural sense. The sample from Hierakonpolis (5) was kept separate from the Early and General Naqada samples (z and 3) for although it did not differ 'significantly' from them, neither did it differ from the Late Naqada sample (4) which was distinct from the other Naqada samples. This Late Naqada sample (4) is significantly different from all other populations with which it has been compared, except the other late predynastic one from Hierakonpolis. The General Naqada sample falls between the Early and Late ones, as would be expected. Virtually all the divergence of the Late from the Early Naqada sample is accounted for in terms of decrease in the frequency of a single variant (no. 2I) from 45 per cent. to o per cent. (table 2). There can be no doubt that this is a real difference and not a scoring error, as the Naqada skulls were classi- fied at random before being sorted into their three groups. A 'significant' popula- tion divergence based on only a single variant occurs in this one case in our study; the principal component analysis (table 4) makes it clear that on average a number of variants contribute decreasingly to the population divergences, the best item discriminating by about 20 per cent. The Late Naqada sample is distinct in all its comparisons, the Hierakonpolis one less so, but in addition they both have a low frequency of variant 2I. The lowest incidence of this particular variant in other populations was in the Ashanti population of Ghana (although the Late Naqada sample is overall less like the Ashanti population than the Early Naqada one). However this change in one variant at the end of predynastic times seems to have been only a temporary one, and later Egyptian samples are similar in this respect to the earlier predynastic populations. If it is to be accepted that this non-metrical method is useful in analysing the Egyptian skeletal material, several individual comparisons require explanation in the light of Egyptological knowledge. However, the most striking fact that emerges from a study of table 3 is the remarkable degree of homogeneity in the population of Egypt over a period of about 5,ooo years, effectively the same con- clusion as from metrical analysis (see below). Our samples did not include material from either the delta proper or the Edfu-Aswan area which are the most likely to have contained foreign settlers. Moreover we do not know the degree of ad- mixture which took place between Egyptians and foreigners at any period of Egyptian history (see above). Nevertheless the genetical constancy shown by our results is not as surprising as it might at first seem, if one takes into account the extent of the historically attested incursions into Egypt throughout its history. This does not mean that there are no heterogeneities or changes in our results- clearly there are-but at no time are there major discontinuities which might imply replacement of the population on a large scale by a genetically different people. Comparisons with craniometric work Osteometry of ancient Egyptian populations began over a hundred years ago (e.g. Morton I844) but much of the earlier literature is virtually meaningless because of the lack of standardisation of techniques and the advances in genetical and statistical understanding since that time (for reviews, see Batrawi I946;</page><page sequence="13">GBNETICAL CHANGE IN ANCIENT EGYPT 563 Massoulard 1949: ch. io). The generally accepted position is that of Risdon (I939, following Morant I925 and Smith &amp; Jones I908). He grouped low values of Pearson's 'coefficient of racial likeness' (a multivariate statistic based on metrical data) between pairs of twenty-two Egyptian and neighbouring populations (males only) (two more were added by Batrawi &amp; Morant I947), and concluded that the populations fell into two classes, with much greater similarities within than between classes. These twenty-four series include all those considered to have been treated in a reliable manner. The two classes are the main basis of Morant's conclusion that 'in early pre- dynastic times there were two distinct races of man living in Egypt; one in the Thebaid and the other, it is supposed, in the Fayum. They may be called the Upper and Lower Egyptian races. They were as closely related to one another as two adjacent people are generally found to be, and there can be no doubt that they diverged from the same branch of the human tree at no very early date. The Lower Egyptian type seems to have remained unchanged from Early Dynastic to Ptole- maic times except that a relatively small part of the population was modified very slightly, possibly by admixture with some unknown foreign race. The Upper Egyptian type was slowly transformed from the very earliest times in which we have acquaintance with it, and by late Dynastic times the population of Upper Egypt was of almost pure Lower Egyptian type. . . These two types represent the extremes of the pure native Egyptian population from Early Predynastic to Ptolemaic times and the relations between them are of the same nature as those which two allied, adjacent and contemporaneous races would bear to one another in general. The vast majority of the Dynastic series of crania from Upper Egypt are intermediate between the Upper and Lower Egyptian times' (I925: 4, 5). Our more limited data do not fall neatly into two such groups. Furthermore for the twenty distance statistics calculated for the same (or similar) population comparisons by the craniometric workers and ourselves, there is a strong negative correlation of - o048 ? O*I7. This is a surprising result, because on the two other occasions on which a correlation between distance statistics based on metrical data and distance statistics calculated from non-metrical data has been attempted (Berry, Evans &amp; Sennitt I967; Berry &amp; Smith Ms), there has been a positive correla- tion of the order of 30-40 per cent. If it is accepted that genetical differences between populations can be detected, and to some extent measured, by the use of multivariate statistics, this must mean that either the data or the material of the craniometric workers or ourselves are faulty. However, the coefficient of racial likeness (the statistic calculated by the craniometricians) has been criticised on purely statistical grounds (Fisher I936; Seltzer I937), and Barnard (I934-5) concluded on these grounds that it was an inefficient tool for the comparison of the Egyptian popu- lations. Despite these criticisms, and the inadequacies of samples used by the early metrical investigators, we feel it useful to discuss the interpretation of our results in the context of the results generally accepted by Egyptologists and which are derived from metrical studies, albeit- within an accurate chronological framework. The earliest predynastic culture to have yielded human remains is the Badarian. I Stoessiger (I927: I44) claimed that the Badarians (from the site of Badari) were distinct from later predynastic populations in being somewhat more dolichocephalic and prognathous and somewhat narrower in the parietal region and shorter of 3-M.</page><page sequence="14">564 A. CAROLINE BERRY, R. J. BERRY AND PETER J. UCKO face than later predynastic peoples. However a later study (Morant I937: 63-6) emphasised that the remains of this date from the sites of Badari and Mostagedda were definitely of the same population, and it was shown that they were not unlike the other predynastic populations. The 'Badarian type' differed from later examples by having a greater degree of prognathism and a lower nasal index, but this difference indicated no more than that they were not members of precisely the same population. Morant claimed also that the Badarians were more closely related to the early predynastic population that succeeded the Badarian than to the late predynastic one and also showed that the Badarians were quite distinct from Roman Egyptians.2 Our results agree with those of Stoessiger in so far as the Badarian population appears significantly different from the later predynastic populations from Naqada and Hierakonpolis. It is not possible from our data to make any assessment as to how closely or distantly related the various samples are. From our results the Badarians appear distinct from all other populations with which they had been compared (including Graeco-Egyptians at Hawara, as already claimed by Morant) except for those of the Old Kingdom, and those from Gizeh and Lachish. It is very difficult to envisage any situation whereby the Badarians would be genetically related to either of these late populations and yet not to the Middle Kingdom populations, and we must conclude that the non-metrical analysis does not in this case distinguish between what must have been disparate populations. It has commonly been claimed with regard to the Badarians (and also for the prehistoric population of Khartoum (Derry I949: 32-3) which some authorities (e.g. Arkell I956: I23-6) consider culturally related to the Badarian) that they exhibit several Negro features which later disappear from the Nile valley popula- tions. Indeed Morant (1925: 8) expressed the homogeneity of the historic Egyptian populations in terms of their freedom from 'Negro blood .., it is not possible to detect the slightest effect of any such (Negro) admixture that can have taken place after early Predynastic times'. Most authors are at pains to disclaim any Negro element in the Egyptian populations after the predynastic period except for the population of Sudanese Kerma (e.g. Falkenburger I947: I44). Although there is no doubt that metrical and craniometric data do distinguish sub-Saharan popula- tions from some other populations, the basic weakness of all claims to distinguish or decry Negro elements on the basis of metrical analyses is the absence of any rigorous population comparisons to isolate particular features which can be de- scribed as negroid. It is typical of this unsatisfactory situation that F. P. (I928: 68), although basing himself entirely on the original Stoessiger report, could summarise the Badarian skull material in terms which denied any serious Negro element: 'It is rather more prognathous than the Naqada skulls but any resemblance to Negro types are so distant as to bar a near connexion, and if there were any relation, it must have been a long way back in evolutionary history ... Badarians were a fellow-branch with the Indians, both radiating from some Asiatic centre'. Our non-metrical analysis does not enable us to say anything about so-called Negro features but it is noticeable that the Kerma sample is much more distinct from all other populations (including the Badarian) in our data than in the craniometric evidence. There is thus little evidence of any kind to support the classification of the Badarians as either Negro or Hamitic (see Arkell &amp; Ucko I965: I55), a</page><page sequence="15">GENETICAL CHANGE IN ANCIENT EGYPT s65 classification which can only lead to considerable confusion: 'The southern group, which is clearly of Hamitic origin, consists of people with small physique of negroid type which are however different from real Negroes' (Vandier I952: I2). The classical distinction between the Upper and Lower Egyptian types has also led to some misunderstanding and for Derry (I939: 5I; I947: 249-5I) and others the predynastic population was the southern race (summarised in a secondary source by Gardiner (I96I: 392) as dolichocephalic, shortish and with Negro features) whereas the population of the Old Kingdom and later represents the northern race (tall and with large skulls (Gardiner I96I)). In fact, as we have seen, Morant's original distinction is a geographical one, and only secondarily a temporal one. The change in pottery type from White Cross-lined to Decorated between the early and the late predynastic period (Amratian to Gerzean) has been interpreted by some (e.g. Baumgartel i965: 2i) as due to the arrival into Egypt of a new group of people. There is no anthropometric evidence to support this conclusion and furthermore, as one of us has argued recently (Arkell &amp; Ucko i965: I53, I55), there is no good archaeological evidence to support such an invasion of foreigners. Whether our findings on the basis of one non-metrical variant for a 'significant' difference between Early and Late Naqada populations should be accepted as important support for the theory of invasion to start the Gerzean period is open to debate. Even if it is maintained on the basis of our non-metrical findings that the Early and Late Naqada populations were really genetically different, it must be noted that in late predynastic times at Hierakonpolis this difference was less accentuated and that by archaic times, at least at Tarkhan and Abydos, the popula- tion again resembled the earlier predynastic population both overall and in terms of the variant frequency which was different in Late Naqada. Nevertheless it is this distinction between a southern (Upper) and northern (Lower) race which has led many Egyptologists to postulate a dynastic invasion at the beginning of the First Dynasty. Thus Emery (I96I: 39-40) writes that 'towards the close of the fourth millenniUM B.C. we find people apparently forming a civilised aristocracy or master race ruling over the whole of Egypt ... a people whose skulls are of greater size [equated by Derry (i956: 8o) with greater cranial capacity and a larger brain], and whose bodies were larger than those of the natives, the difference being so marked that any suggestion that these people derived from the earlier stock is impossible. . .' Derry (I947: 249-5 I) maintained that the height of the predynastic skull exceeded its width while for historic populations from Egypt the opposite was true and that the actual height of the skull was greater than in the predynastic one. Should this difference be real, it may reflect no more than the already noted geographical difference. Our data show no difference between the early predynastic population of Naqada and either the archaic population of Tarkhan or the 'workmen' of archaic Abydos. It is also interesting to note that we found no difference between the late pre-dynastic population of Hierakonpolis and the archaic populations. This gives some added support to those (e.g. Arkell &amp; Ucko i965: iss) who question the necessity of invoking an invasion into Egypt in order to explain the emergence of the First Dynasty of Egypt. Craniometric work on material from the dynastic periods of ancient Egypt is comparatively little. We have seen that craniometricians claim that most historic populations differed little from the Archaic (northern) populations. Our data (from</page><page sequence="16">566 A. CAROLINE BERRY, R. J. BERRY AND PETER J. UCKO Hierakonpolis, from Archaic, Middle Kingdom and Saite sites) confirm this finding, but the Middle Kingdom and Saite populations are distinct from each other. Although it is often assumed that the Kerma population was negroid (see above), Barnard (1934-5; 367) found no significant difference between this population and that from the Sixth to Twelfth Dynasties at Dendereh (where it is possible that there may have been a large foreign mercenlary population at this time). Our analysis shows Kerma to be distinct from all other populations examined. Further- more Barnard claimed that it is only with the Ptolemaic period that a significant change in the Egyptian population becomes noticeable, for the Ptolemaic popula- tion from Dendereh is significantly different both from the earlier population at the same site and from the Kerma population. Our analysis shows no difference between the Egyptian population of Gizeh and the later Greek population of Hawara. We cannot explain this result. To sum up, the analyses of both metrical and non-metrical data based on skeletal remains show a similarity between samples which is at variance with an assumption of great racial intermingling during any period of Egypt's historical development. This can mean: i. that the techniques used are not sensitive enough to reveal any intermningling; 2. more likely, that the incomers were few in number relative to the existing population, and did not influence the gene-pool of future generations to any marked degree; 3. that the incomers did not differ genetically from the Egyptian population. NOTES We are grateful to the late Dr J. C. Trevor of the Duckworth Laboratory, Cambridge, and Dr K. P. Oakley of the British Museum (Natural History) for access to the skull collections in their care. Mr A. J. Lee drew the figure. Our thanks are due to our colleagues Mr D. R. Brothwell, Dr D. Dixon, Professor H. Griineberg, F.R.S., and Professor C. A. B. Smith for their comments and criticisms of our manuscript, and especially to Dr J. P. Garlick and Mr H. S. Smith for much valuable discussion. I It is interesting to note that in trying to defime a Tasian culture as distinct from the Badarian, Bruntoni (I937: 27) described Tasian skulls as strongly marked types with wider heads and much squarer jaws than the Badarian or Amratian ones. Brunton even dated a particular grave by the type of skull associated with it. That there is little archaeological or craniometric evidence for a separate Tasian culture is now fairly clear (see Baumgartel i955: 2I-II; Arkell &amp; Ucko I965: i5o). 2 Secondary sources typically reduce what are extremely complex craniometric data to a few generalised sentences, e.g. 'The studyof the human skeletons fromEl-Badari and El-Mustagedda has shown that already at that early age the population was of mixed origin, some having a fine anid some a heavily built skull. Their skulls were closely related to those of the people of Naqada I and IF' (Baumgartel I965: I3). REFERENCES Arkell, A.J. I956. Review of Baumgartel, E.J. The cultures of prehistoric Egypt.
