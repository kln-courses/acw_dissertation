Paperback, 49 pages, $1.00. All three copyright 1971, by High lights for Children, Inc., 2300 West Fifth Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43216. 'TpHREE new booklets put out by A Highlights for Children have su perficial points in common. All three are sof tbound collections of material, most of which has appeared in past issues of the magazine; all are priced at one dollar each; all are directed to the home and school market for use by intermediate grade children. Biographies of Black Americans is an uneven collection of short, two page sketches of the Fisk Jubilee Singers and sixteen American Ne groes who have won distinction in all areas of our culture. These selec tions were written by some eleven different authors and all are reprints of articles appearing in Highlights from 1952 through 1971. Each is il lustrated by sketches or photographs, and each bears the Horatio Alger touch. Most of the biographies cover the usual Black luminaries, but there is certainly a question why Elizabeth Keckley, seamstress for Mrs. Lin coln, should be included while others such as Ralph Bunche, Malcolm X, Ama Bontemps and even Julian Bond 553</page><page sequence="2">are omitted. Strangely enough, there is no biography of Martin Luther King, Jr. either, although there is a brief excerpt from his "I Have a Dream" speech. On the inside back cover, there is a good, one page bibliography of rela tively recent books, which seems to be the only part of this volume which has not been previously published. This could be useful as a purchas ing guide, as well as an incentive for further reading. Good third and fourth grade read ers and reluctant readers in junior high could handle this booklet. Teachers could find a peripheral use for it in the classroom, but most school and public libraries have the same material in better, more defini tive, more satisfying format. Nature's Wonderful Family is an acceptable collection of animal pro files which will appeal to young readers in the same age group. The facts are accurate and interesting, the colored illustrations well done. There is some phraseology reminis cent of Freddy Fox and Uncle Wig gly, but probably most youngsters will accept the anthropomorphism without a shudder. And, certainly, there is a commendable effort to place all the animals in proper per spective in the ecosystem. In this handbook, too, all articles are reprints, with copyrights dating from 1968. The one and two page descriptions cover various animals from the common chipmunk to the more exotic armadillo; included, also, are dragon flies, frogs, salmon, birds of several species, and even eggs and zoos. Such a collection leads to the suspicion that availability of material rather than any other ra tionale determined selection. Never theless, this will be appealing to young nature lovers either at home or in school, although equally at tractive information, and more of it, is readily available from other sources. Crossword Puzzles from Highlights is a bright, attractively illustrated small booklet quite suitable as a stocking present for an eight to ten year old puzzle fan. The range of the puzzles seems to be one of size and simplicity of format, rather than word difficulty. Although authorship is not specified, the similarity of words and definitions from puzzle to puzzle indicates a common source. The only clue that these puzzles are reprints is in the title; there is a single copyright date?1971. Answers for the hard-pressed are printed in the back of the book. Crossword Puzzles has a doubtful place in the classroom. Teachers have access to many other puzzle sources, easily reproduced, which re flect current curriculum content. Pur chase of classroom quantities, in these days of stringent budgets, would be prohibited by the compara tive high cost of this publication. Despite the good quality?usually ?of Highlights materials, these book lets do not fulfill a valid educational need in the classroom. They are ex pensive for what they offer; they are mediocre in quality; and they pre sent no new material that is not readily available in other publica tions. The criteria for selection of material for publication seems to have been copyright ownership rather than an attempt to cover a topic either selectively or comprehensively. Is it fair to suggest that commercial ism (crass type) is their raison d'?tre? Reviewed by Leone R.
