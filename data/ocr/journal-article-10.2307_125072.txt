The more important sites there are thirteen painted rock shelters. One of them, Buraco da Pala, was occupied for three millennia, making it reasonable to assume that it played a part in different social, economic and symbolic systems. It was used for settlement purposes between the late sixth/early fifth millennium Bc and the beginning of the third. A high number of burnt cereal grains shows the introduction of farming in the interior of northern Portugal. Buraco da Pala was used as a granary and storage was carried out in large pottery vessels that occupied most of the usable space in the shelter. These levels provide evidence both for the intensification of agricultural production in this area during the Chalcolithic period and for different ways of symbolically appropriating the surrounding territory.

Introduction The Passos/Santa Comba Mountain (Serra de Passos/Santa Comba) is located in the interior of northern Portugal, on the left bank of the River Tua, the latter a tributary of the river Douro (Fig. 1). The Passos/Santa Comba Mountain is in the province of Trfs-os-Montes and Alto-Douro. This province is characterized by a series of plateaux up to 700m high and by several mountains rising above this altitude, such as Bornes, Nogueira (1318 m) and Padrela (1147 m). There is also an important system of basins and river valleys in this region. Such conditions lead to climatic diversity, although the main trend is towards a continental regime. In the basins and the Douro valley the climate is subhumid with mild winters and warm, dry summers, low annual precipitation with high annual variations and low relative moisture. The vegetation is mixed, with evergreen and World Archaeology Vol. 28(2): 220-230 Sacred Geography ?

Its composition varies according to several factors: altitude, influence from the Atlantic and the orientation of the local winds. Passos/Santa Comba Mountain (1010 m) constitutes a sort of 'hill-island' in relation to one of the lowest of the basins in this region - the Mirandela basin. The particular location of this mountain allows it to dominate the landscape and it commands a considerable area of the surrounding territory (Plate 1). The Passos/Santa Comba mountain archaeological sites On the top of Serra de Passos/Santa Comba is a rock shelter that provides evidence of a human presence between the late sixth/early fifth millennium and the middle of the third. This site, Buraco da Pala, was excavated from 1987 to 1990 (Sanches 1987, 1995; Sanches et al. 1993). The results of this fieldwork provide a basis for a wider analysis of the first Neolithic communities in this area and the subsequent development of social complexity. The only natural means of access to the top of the mountain where Buraco de Pala rock shelter is located are valleys of three streams: Pousada (south), Cabreira (north) and</page><page sequence="3">222 Maria de Jesus Sanches Plate 1 Passos/Santa Comba Mountain. 1) Buraco da Pala rock shelter; 2) Regato das Boucas painted rock shelter group and Mae d'Agua settlement; 3) Ribeira da Cabreira painted rock shelters.

Systematic field survey revealed that only the shelters located along these natural passage ways were marked as culturally significant places through the creation of schematic paintings. Of the thirteen rock shelters with paintings, one of them Buraco da Pala itself, eight are concentrated on the mountain's eastern side on the cliffs surrounding Regato das Boucas (Sanches 1993) (Plate 1 and Fig. 2). On the small plateau located on the upper part of these</page><page sequence="4">Passos/Santa Comba Mountain in late prehistory 223 cliffs, there was once the prehistoric open air settlement of Mae d'Agua. The fieldwork carried out on that settlement revealed that its structures had been eroded by the torrential summer rainfall characteristic of this area. Archaeological finds in other rock shelters, not yet excavated, indicate a very complex occupation on this mountain. The Buraco da Pala rock shelter and other Passos/Santa Comba Mountain painted rock shelters Buraco da Pala is a rock shelter with an interior of around 81 square metres. The inner walls form an inverted V, rising to a height of about 25 m. This rock shelter was occupied from the late sixth/early fifth to the third millennium BC. Twenty-one C14 dates are available from this site (Sanches et al. 1993). Between c. 5100-4400 BC and 4100-3000 BC, Buraco da Pala was occupied as a settlement by Neolithic communities. The earliest phase of use is notable for the appearance of a very high number of burnt cereal grains: barley, wheat and legumes, possibly beans. There are also flakes and microlithic blades, a polished adze, grindstones and also decorated pottery vessels. These levels included an essentially Epipalaeolithic microblade assemblage indicating a careful use of cores in order to maximize the use of the raw material. Other lithic tools are multi-purpose artefacts which were manufactured locally. The presence of settlement structures like hearths and post-holes located at different depths of the same strata could point to a non-permanent occupation. That is to say, Buraco da Pala rock shelter could be one of several settlements belonging to a community practising a relatively mobile way of life, although it might have been used for longer periods than other sites in the vicinity. The transformation of the Passos Mountain into a ritual space may have begun in the early Neolithic through the paintings made in some of the shelters, notably Regato das Bouqas. The later fourth millennium BC (level III) saw a lengthy occupation by communities whose material culture had changed significantly. Continued occupation is evident in levels II and I (the latest in the sequence). In level III (3200-2800 BC), the occupation was of a domestic character but it cannot be interpreted in detail due to later disturbance. Levels II and I (2800-2200 BC) correspond to the use of the rock shelter as a granary, where cereals, legumes such as broad beans and gathered products like acorns were stored. According to the traditional chronology, these two levels are Chalcolithic. The material culture exhibits a continuity between levels III and II, which might suggest the presence of the same cultural group on the site. Despite changes in the excavated pottery between levels II and I the organization of space within remained the same. In both cases food was stored in large pottery vessels put almost directly over the ground (level I) or supported by a light wooden construction (level II). These containers occupied most of the usable space in the shelter. However, there is a specific zone within both levels which could have been used for food consumption and this we consider a 'domestic' area (Fig. 3). The latter is characterized by high numbers of hearths (some very short-lived) and is associated with smaller ceramic vessels than those in the storage area. Between the two phases the storage vessels became larger. In level I, these pots reached a capacity of about 90 litres. These developments seem to indicate the intensification of agricultural production in the area but level I also provides some indications of social change. It includes personal</page><page sequence="5">224 Maria de Jesus Sanches I{ I l 1 Figure 3 Buraco da Pala rock shelter (level 11). a) storage area; b) 'domestic area'; c) dis- /- :S// t turbed area; r) rocks. _ I . .A 0 4 cI . i .-. metres ornaments made of exotic or non-local raw materials (gold or variscite), copper objects and evidence of on-site metallurgy. Even the locally produced ceramics are decorated in a style that extends over a much wider area. Some imitate Bell Beakers or even the so-called 'symbol pottery' which displays eye or face motifs. In the storage area domestic artefacts are practically absent, although they are commonly found in local settlements dating to the same period. On the other hand, some of the decorated pottery and personal ornaments are of types found only in ritual/funerary sites, mainly the large megalithic tombs in northern and central Portugal and the neighbouring Spanish Meseta. Some of these tombs are decorated with paintings and carvings displaying schematic abstract or semi- naturalistic motifs (Cunha 1995). To summarize, it could be said that one of the striking features of the Buraco da Pala rock shelter is the exiguous circulation space resulting from its use almost exclusively for</page><page sequence="6">PassoslSanta Comba Mountain in late prehistory 225 Figure 4 (left) Buraco da Pala dark red paintings - panel 1.

Two panels with dark red schematic painting (Fig. 4) must also be noted. These motifs are similar to those found in other Passos Mountain painted rockshelters and mainly to those belonging to the later phases of activity. These include phase II of Shelter 3 at Regato das Boucas (Fig. 5). Reference has been made to the three natural gateways to the top of the Passos/Santa Comba Mountain, where there are eleven rock shelters with rock paintings. The only concentration of shelters, eight in number, is situated around the open-air settlement of Mae d'Agua (Plate 1). Shelter 3 is worth mentioning, because it is the most profusely painted both on the inner and outer walls, with all the motifs of a type usually associated with the so-called 'schematic rock painting' of Andalucia, Spain. Although this kind of rock art is recorded throughout the Iberian Peninsula, with the exception of the Atlantic fringe, the apparent link with Andalucia is due to the fact that this region is one in which this type of painting is particularly common. Apart from rock shelter 2 where schematic or semi-schematic human figures are important, the main features in all sites are non-figurative motifs of a symbolic or abstract nature (Fig. 5). The only site where different designs overlap is Shelter 3 and this evidence allows the paintings to be divided into two broad phases. This shelter may be the most important 'sanctuary' of the whole group (Fig. 5). It seems to have been used as a ritual site from the beginning of the Neolithic until at least the phase of the Chalcolithic represented by levels II and I at Buraco da Pala. The paintings provide no evidence of 'composition' in the conventional sense of the term; there seems to have been no intention to associate the different motifs with one another. Images were added to the walls of the shelter but, with two exceptions, the newer images respected those that were already there (Fig. 5). It is the profusion of paintings found on the inner and outer walls of the shelter that leads us to consider this site as the most important 'sanctuary' of the whole group at Serra de Passos/Santa Comba. At different moments in time, but particularly in the later of the two phases, there was an 'expansion' to the immediately neighbouring shelters, or to shelters that were strategically situated in other areas allowing access to the top of the mountain. This process even incorporated the excavated site at Buraco da Pala (Plate 1). Each painted shelter, including Buraco da Pala, has been considered as an individual sanctuary, but the continuing sacred character of the Passos/Santa Comba Mountain for three millennia from the late sixth/early fifth to the late third millennium BC should also be highlighted. Both Passos/Santa Comba Mountain and the wider region of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro Province provide evidence for increasingly complex political relations over this period. This process is also accompanied by the 'domestication' and appropri- ation of territory. These new ways of marking territory suggest the gradual definition and re-definition of regional and local identities. This is why the sacred character of the Passos/Santa Comba mountain is so important. The fact that it maintained the role for such a long period implies that it was drawn into the collective memory of the communities that used the mountain and provided a focal point in their political and social life.</page><page sequence="8">Passos/Santa Comba Mountain in late prehistory 227 Discussion Until very recently the first prehistoric 'settlement' in northern Portugal was indicated by megalithic tombs or burial mounds. The oldest of these date from between the late fifth and the late fourth millennium BC (Jorge, V. 1992). Despite the systematic research in certain regions such as Aboboreira Mountain (Douro Litoral province) (Jorge, V. 1989; Cruz 1992), it has never been possible to detect any unequivocal settlement of the communities that built and used dolmens or mounds as burial sites. There are few grave goods in these tombs and these were usually quite simple in character. It is unwise to draw analogies with the artefacts from settlements, even when both settlements and megalithic tombs date from the same period (Jorge, S. 1988, 1990: 149-50), for there is a striking difference between the ceramics in these two contexts. Those from settlements are normally profusely decorated and those from mounds (with or without megalithic chambers) are predominantly undecorated. The first evidence of agriculture in northern Portugal appears very early in the prehistoric sequence. Level IV of Buraco da Pala shows that, between the end of the sixth and the middle of the fifth millennium BC, cereals and legumes were cultivated, although there is no reason to infer widespread dependence on arable farming. The decorated pottery includes certain patterns which are also found in the so-called 'cave culture' of Andalucia. Fraga d'Aia is a rock shelter that is located south of the river Douro (but still in the Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro province). It possesses two panels with prehistoric paintings. The older example depicts an anthropomorphic figure with a possible bow and a deer with large antlers (Jorge, V. et al. 1988: 203). The excavation of this rock shelter yielded some decorated and undecorated pottery, microlithic artefacts and stone tools that were apparently related to the cultivation and the processing of food; they include adzes and a quantity of grinding stones. The earliest hearth at Fraga d'Aia dates from between the second half of the sixth millennium BC and the first half of the fifth millennium and seems to relate to the sporadic occupation of the shelter and its transformation into a sanctuary. Between 4200 and 3400 BC the shelter was still used as a sanctuary where rituals took place at different times of the year and where new painted motifs were added to the existing panels (Jorge, V. 1991). The ceremonial preparation and consumption of food may have formed part of the rituals taking place in this shelter. The evidence from the excavated rock shelters suggests that agriculture was adopted in the interior of northern Portugal between the late sixth millennium BC and the middle of the fourth. There is similar evidence from sites nearer the coast. In each case it is possible that the region was occupied by Neolithic communities prior to the building of megaliths or simple burial mounds. These groups practised a mixed economy, combining hunting and gathering, cultivation and possibly pastoralism, and seem to have exploited the varied ecosystem on a seasonal basis. In Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro province these communities adopted the cultivation of cereals in an environment whose climate was rather similar to that in southern Iberia. In Andalucia, for instance, cereal cultivation was adopted at approximately the same time. The evidence of the rock paintings suggests social and ideological similarities between the same regions. In the light of these developments it seems possible that during the late sixth millennium BC rock shelters like those on the Passos/Santa Comba mountain were first decorated as a</page><page sequence="9">228 Maria de Jesus Sanches means of 'domesticating' the natural landscape and imbuing it with cultural and social properties. This may have happened before the construction of the megalithic tombs and burial mounds which are sometimes interpreted as territorial markers. The demarcation and domestication of a territory occurs with the physical transform- ation of space into 'place' through the building of monuments for the deposition of ancestral remains (Thomas 1991: 30). In that sense 'places' may create a memory of the past. This memory is permanently updated and is experienced through the physical presence of that 'place'. Thus a location is named and tamed and that process may be reinforced by the ritualizing of certain practices. This 'fusion of the past and the present' (Thomas 1991) must have been carried out in different ways in different societies, but in northern Portugal the demarcation of a territory by durable constructions happened only between the late fifth and the middle of the fourth millennium BC. This is also true in the Abororeira closer to the coast and in other regions of central and northern Iberia. Often this development took a material form through the construction of megalithic monuments. Subsequent developments are very revealing. V. Jorge considers that the fourth millennium BC in northern Portugal was marked by the growth of more stable social and economic systems among small self-sufficient communities living in the area. But by about 3500 BC there were important changes. According to Jorge's interpretation, 'in northern Portugal, [we see] the emergence of elites who were able to integrate the efforts of territorially dispersed communities in the construction of large monuments' (Jorge, V. 1992: 469). This same period witnesses not only beginnings of more complex megalithic architecture, but also the emergence of settlements with insubstantial structures, such as Castelo de Aguiar (Villa Pouca de Aguiar), Vinha da Soutilha (Chaves) (Jorge, S. 1986) and Barrocal Alto (Mogadouro) (Sanches 1993) and others, whose occupation runs until the middle/late third millennium BC. These settlements are not directly related to funerary sites in terms of material culture or spatial proximity, although burial grounds are known which date to the same period. These settlements became more complex through time and include finds of artefacts made of rare raw materials, tools and personal ornaments of types which take the same form over an extensive area. This might reflect the rise of local elites, and their incorporation in networks of inter-regional exchange. According to S. Harrison (1992: 38) these objects could have played an essentially rhetorical role, communicating information about the participant which was mainly political. Access to these objects would imply the acceptance and recognition of a higher social status among those who possessed them. It is easy to suppose that, just as in gift economies, the circulation of these goods implies the establishment of a new network of alliances extending beyond the study area. The appropriation of the territory by prehistoric communities in this region seems to have been accomplished in a more explicit manner in the middle of the third millennium BC. This process might have taken various forms, but, by this time, all of the interior of northern Portugal (and neighbouring regions of Spain like Salamanca, Zamora, Avila and Caceres) contain a fairly dense network of settlements. It must be noted, however, that a high number of these are known only through field survey. Nevertheless, we think that this evidence reflects a more systematic occupation of the territory and the development of a settlement hierarchy that reflects the increasing complexity of society. Some of these settlements acquired a more lasting and grandiose character. Castelo</page><page sequence="10">Passos/Santa Comba Mountain in late prehistory 229 Velho is one such site, possessing two lines of stone walls and a central 'tower' (Jorge, S. 1993). Other similar settlements were recently found in this same region through field survey. Another way of marking territory in Tras-os-Montes and Alto-Douro is revealed by the stelae at Cabego da Mina (Vila Flor) which defined a sacred space located on the bottom of a valley. It was during this same period that Buraco da Pala was used as a great granary storing agricultural products such as barley and gathered products such as acorns. Our interpretation of Buraco da Pala levels I and II as a granary draws on the concept of intensification defined by Harrison. This 'is the description of a process in which production of goods and food is increased in order to create a surplus to be used for political and social purposes. . . intensification is a reality owing more to the intention to manipulate the social order over a lengthy period than to any objective of promoting economic changes' (Harrison, R. 1993:294). The use of Buraco da Pala as a granary provides an index of economic intensification, whatever the origin of the stored product, which may have been produced by only one community or by various local groups. The latter could be related through kinship, exchange or through alliance in warfare, and the stored produce could have been collected as a form of tribute to be deployed in ritual activity. Moreover, access to that stored surplus also needs to be considered as this may have played a central role in political relations. The ritualization of certain kinds of social practices, for instance, the collective consumption of food, could have taken place at Serra de Passos from the early Neolithic. It is probable that in that period the Passos/Santa Comba Mountain sanctuaries with rock art were already part of a ritual order that supported the wider social system. In the third millennium BC, the archaeological record in northern Portugal seems to reflect the emergence of a different kind of society evidenced both by new strategies of territorial appropriation and the elaboration of rituals. Such rituals included not only funerary practices (in megalithic tombs or/and in caves), but also those taking place in settlement sites (with or without monumental features) and involving the use of prestige objects. These would have been essential to the creation of a new social order. Within this context we could include the Buraco da Pala storage phase and the increasing production of rock paintings, both of which occurred from the third millennium BC. According to Earle, under specific conditions such as subsistence intensification, local territorial groups may form extensive regional ties, in order to respond to such problems as competition (or even warfare). In such cases 'the network of interaction, although not politically centralized, can be organized by intense ceremonial interaction' (Earle 1990: 74). Buraco da Pala and other painted sites of Passos/Santa Comba mountain could have been integrated into such a pattern of alliances or even into a larger regional polity. This might explain the emergence of a specific elite that could have limited access to painted rock shelters like Buraco da Pala and the rituals that were taking place there.
