<plain_text><page sequence="1">PALÉORIENT, vol. 17/1 - 1991 THE ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF GROUND STONE ASSEMBLAGES IN LATE PLEISTOCENE SOUTHWEST ASIA K. WRIGHT ABSTRACT. - Ground stone technology is widely considered a prerequisite to cereal domestication. Assemblages from the Levantine late Pleistocene and early Holocene reveal several trends: (1) ground stone tools appear first in the Upper Paleolithic; (2) ves- sel/mortars first appear in the time range of the glacial maximum, coincident with the earliest presently-known significant samples of wild cereals from archaeological deposits; (3) known assemblages are small in size and number until the Early Natufian; (4) Early Natufian assemblages are numerous, some are large, and many are dominated by vessel/mortars and pestles; (5) grinding slabs and handstones become more numerous in the Late Natufian and especially in the PPNA and PPNB, coincident with the earliest documented domesticated cereals. Ethnographic and experimental data indicate that dehusking of the wild cereals was likely to have been arduous using Epipaleolithic tools and questions are raised as to whether the cereals were an "attractive" food source. Early Natufian mortars and pestles suggest simple dehusking of cereals, along with the processing of many other plant foods. These tools figure in funerary rituals and this may be indirect evidence for cultural determinants of food choices, perhaps in a time of increasing environmental stress. The grinding slabs and handstones of Late Natufian-PPNA assemblages suggest the in- tensification of previously-existing exploitation patterns, during environmental changes that characterized the terminal Pleistocene. RESUME. - La technologie du mobilier en pierre est généralement considérée comme une condition préalable à la domestication des céréales. Les assemblages du Levant datant du Pléistocène récent et de l'Holocène ancien révèlent plusieurs tendances : 1) les outils en pierre polie sont attestés pour la première fois au Paléolithique ancien; 2) les récipients/mortiers apparaissent au cours du maximum glaciaire et coïncident ainsi avec les échantillons les plus anciens de céréales sauvages connus à ce jour en provenance de sites archéologiques ; 3) les assemblages connus sont peu nombreux et restent pauvres jusqu'au Natoufien ancien; 4) les as- semblages du Natoufien ancien sont nombreux; certains sont riches et beaucoup présentent une dominante de récipients/mortiers et de pilons ; 5) le nombre de meules et de molettes s'accroît au Natoufien récent et plus particulièrement au PPNA et au PPNB, époques où sont documentées les plus anciennes céréales domestiques. Les données ethnographiques et expérimentales semblent montrer que la décortication des céréales sauvages au moyen des outils épipaléolithiques devait être ardue, ce qui pose la question de savoir si les céréales constituaient une source de nourriture "attrayante". Les mortiers et les pilons du Natoufien ancien suggèrent une décortication simple des céréales, ainsi que la préparation de nombreux aliments à base d'autres plantes. Ces ustensiles apparaissent dans des rituels funéraires, ce qui pourrait constituer dans le domaine de la nourriture des indices indirects de choix culturels, à une époque où la pression de l'environnement se fait plus forte. Les meules et les molettes du Natoufien récent-PPNA suggèrent l'intensification de modes d'exploitation pré-existants lors des modifications du milieu qui caractérisent la fin du Pléistocène. INTRODUCTION Ground stone artifacts such as mortars, pestles and milling stones have long been recognized as a central feature in the development of early farming societies in the Near East. Many statements have been made concerning the significance of ground stone technology in the evolution of plant-food pro- duction (1). These statements generally emphasize the relationship between grinding tools and cereals and specifically refer to the technology as an essen- tial precondition to cereal domestication. Yet these statements are based on only general impressions of ground stone assemblage variations and the role of grinding and pounding in plant food exploitation. In the Levant, true ground stone tools (in which abrasion plays a large role in lithic reduction) begin to appear in small numbers in sites of the Upper Paleolithic (45,000-22,000 b.p.), Kebaran (22,000- 14,500 b.p.) and Geometric Kebaran (14,500-12,500 b.p.) time ranges. They become especially numerous in the period between 12,000 and 10,500 b.p., in sites of the Natufian. This era forms the background to plant domestication, direct evidence for which is so far first documented only in "Pre-Pottery Neolithic A" times (10,500 to 9,500 b.p.) at sites lo- cated in the greater Jordan Rift Valley and the Damascus Basin (2).

The main biogeo- graphical zones are Mediterranean woodland (mean annual rainfall greater than 400 mm), moist steppe (200-400 mm), dry steppe (100-200 mm) and desert (less than 100 mm). These zones are critical to our understanding of where and why cereal exploitation developed. The wild cereals presently require a min- imum of 200-250 mm/yr of reliable rainfall and thus their native habitats lie in woodland, open parkland and moist steppes (3). However, the ecology of wild cereals has too often directed research questions re- lating to the Levantine Epipaleolithic and has tended to obscure other possible plant-exploitation pat- terns (4).

(4) HILLMAN et al., 1990. 20</page><page sequence="3">GROUND STONE TECHNOLOGY Published ground stone typologies from Near Eastern prehistoric sites are generally descriptive in- ventories of artifacts from individual sites, ordered in intuitive categories based on varying criteria. The result is that the terms used to describe these tools are inconsistent (5). Type definitions are not often kept distinct from sample descriptions and many ty- pologies are based on qualitative attributes of artifact shape and size, although notable exceptions include Nierlé's and Roodenberg's studies (6). Apart from these exceptions, many typologies are useful as site inventories, but they do not permit rigorous compari- sons between assemblages (7). Prehistorians working with chipped stone artifacts have developed rela- tively standard descriptive terminology and classifi- cations which have been useful for such comparisons (8). It is often assumed that "ground stone" tools were manufactured only by abrasion. However, they were made by varied techniques (9). In this paper, the term "ground stone" means any tools reduced by combinations of flaking, pecking, pounding, grinding and incising. It is essential to treat whole assem- blages of ground stone tools in order to interpret relative frequencies of the "food processing" equip- ment. Detailed discussion of the technology is be- yond the scope of this paper. Yet it should be emphasized that ground stone tool forms are often consistent with the idea that they represent different stages in progressive lithic reduction, rather than normative types (10). Definitions for the full typology used here are to be presented elsewhere (11). The typology is based on the following criteria: raw material selec- tion, primary reduction (= production of blanks), secondary reduction (removal of rock fragments such as by flaking or pecking), abrasion, finishing, the morphology and wear of use surfaces and evidence for refashioning. The following definitions refer to the tool classes discussed in this paper. Grinding slabs/querns The lower, stationary stone in a pair of tools used mainly (but not necessarily exclusively) for grinding, mostly in a plane parallel to the side the artifact rests upon. Blanks: variable. Use surfaces: continuous, smooth; may have striations which are linear (lateral) or elliptical; broad in plan; concave or flat in section. The heaviest grinding wear is at the deepest part of the use surface. Mortars The lower, stationary stone in a pair of tools used mainly for pounding and "rotary hand-grind- ing". Most pounding occurs in a plane perpendicular to the resting side of the artifact. Traces of "vertical" rotary grinding may be visible on side walls of the use surface. Blanks: variable. Use surfaces: subcircu- lar in plan and variable in section from shallow, con- cave to deep and U-shaped. The deepest part of the use surface is irregular and bears pounding marks. Mortars are formally distinguished from vessels (s.v.). They may be portable or placed in bedrock outcrops. Handstones Upper, mobile stone in a pair of (mainly) grind- ing tools. Blanks: variable. Use surfaces: broad, covering large areas of the blank; elongated or con- stricted in plan; convex or flat in transverse section. They may or may not have striations. Pestles Upper, mobile stone in a pair of (mainly) pound- ing tools. Blanks: variable. Use surfaces: constricted in plan and confined to one or more of the ends of an elongated blank. Faces are subcircular or oval in plan, in section they are gently convex or flat. There are often flake scars on the sides, with the negative bulb of percussion near the use surface. Pounding is directed through the long axis of the tool. Pounders Blank type: core or angular nodule. Crushing fractures on any or all sides of a nodule or core. These are small wedge shaped internal fractures from pounding directed into the stone at a variety of an- gles. Forms range from irregular to spheroid. Ham- merstones are a separate type. They are defined as outils à posteriori , that is, made on raw blanks (12). Stone vessels For an artifact to be considered a vessel, the fol- lowing features had to be present: (1) a well-defined, uniform rim or base; (2) one smooth continuous ex- terior wall surface; (3) consistent or gradually in- creasing or decreasing thickness of walls from rim (5) HERSH, 1981 : 77f.; HOLE et al., 1969 : 170; KRAYBILL, 1977 : 487; VOIGT, 1983 : 247.

A fragment assigned to this category had to display two of these criteria. Nothing is implied about whether such vessels in fact functioned as mor- tars (s.v.). Multiple tools Any artifacts which fall into more than one of the above categories. Pestle/Handstone : any combi- nation of the other categories of pestle and handstone as listed above. Anvil : generally a tool with marks resulting from both pounding and chopping. LEVANTINE GROUND STONE ASSEMBLAGES Analysis of early Levantine ground stone assem- blages was based on (1) a classification derived from direct examination of over 2500 artifacts from 19 ex- cavated Jordanian sites spanning the late Upper Pale- olithic through Neolithic (13); and (2) application of this classification (where possible) to artifacts de- scribed in site reports. Several problems attend any comprehensive comparison of ground stone assemblages from data presented in site reports. The amount of survey var- ies among different regions within the Levant and sites have been excavated in varying amounts and according to different standards. Moreover, descrip- tions of ground stone in site reports vary in detail and completeness. Finally, the question was raised as to whether to include artifacts found on the sur- faces of unexcavated but apparently single-period sites. It was deliberately decided to include such oc- currences for the sake of completeness. The results are necessarily provisional. Upper Paleolithic (45,000-22,000 b.p.) A search of available literature on Middle Pale- olithic sites revealed no reports of ground stone tools, although battered cores, hammerstones and possibly pounders are documented (14). On present evidence, the earliest ground stone tools seem to be an Upper Paleolithic phenomenon. In the Upper Pale- olithic, about 25% of 61 sites investigated contain very small assemblages (N = 2-7) of ground stone tools, generally small-sized, portable handstones and grinding slabs (Table 1; fig. 2a, 3a-c). Early in the Upper Paleolithic, the handstones generally have ochre residues and are similar in form and raw mate- rials to hammerstones (Table 2). In the later part of the period, grinding tools lacking ochre become more common (Table 2). If this pattern is representative and not a function of sampling biases, it may indicate that grinding stones developed from hammerstones, as was suggested by Kraybill (15). By the later part of the period, it appears that such tools may have served diverse functions. There is, however, no direct evidence that the Upper Paleolithic grinding tools were used for processing seeds in general or cereals in particular (16). Residue studies indicate that sim- ilar tools were used for processing tubers in late- Paleolithic Wadi Kubbaniya (Egypt) at about 19,000 b.p. (17). The distribution of these artifacts among Upper Paleolithic sites is a generalized one and in- dicates no link between elevations, vegetation zones or other environmental variables. Prehistorians have identified at least two chipped-stone traditions in the Levantine Upper Pale- olithic, one characterized by a flake technology and a typological predominance of endscrapers and burins ("Levantine Aurignacian") and another based on blade-bladelet production and dominated by re- touched bladelets and points ("Ahmarian") (18). It has been suggested that the "Ahmarian" industries may have been ancestral to the bladelet industries of the Epipaleolithic, particularly the Kebaran(19). Because the Kebaran and subsequent industries in- cluded for the first time fairly elaborate grind- ing/pounding tools, it is of interest as to whether there is a precedent to this development among the "Ahmarian" industries. Examination of the Upper Paleolithic assemblages shows no correlation be- tween the occurrence of ground stone tools and the Ahmarian (20). Kebaran (22,000-14,500 b.p.) Subsequent Kebaran and related industries, coeval with the cold and dry climate conditions of the glacial maximum (21), contain equally small as- semblages. At this time, new tool types appear. Deep vessel/mortars and deliberately-fashioned elongated pestles were found at several sites in diverse settings (fig. 3d-f) (22). Only about 14 % of 66 Kebaran sites investigated contain any ground stone tools (Table 3). The distribution of sites with ground stone evinces no obvious patterns, although the sites are generally at fairly low elevations. The distribution is slightly different from the overall distribution of known Kebaran sites (23). Many Kebaran sites lie on (13) WRIGHT, n.d. (14) Ibid. (15) KRAYBILL, 1977.

How- ever, this observation may be insignificant since most known coastal-plain Kebaran sites are surface scatters (24). Kebaran sites only rarely display traces of architecture and there is therefore no correlation between ground stone and the presence of architec- ture. Geometric Kebaran and Related Industries (14,500-12,500 b.p.) Among Geometric Kebaran and related (Mush- abian) industries, ground stone tools are found at only about 16 % of 178 sites investigated (Table 4). The assemblages are small (N = 1-10) and tool types range from small ad hoc handstones and rare grind- ing slabs to mortars and pestles similar to those seen in some Kebaran sites.

However, these "arid-zone" assemblages are dominated by miscellaneous anvils and pounders (29) and deep vessel/mortars and pestles tend to occur in wetter regions. As before, few sites on the coastal plain have ground stone tools, al- though many sites of this time range are located there (30). Natufian (12,500-10,500 b.p.) A few Early Natufian sites (12,500-11,500 b.p.) (31) are well known for their size, circular stone structures, rare "storage" (?) pits, sophisticated reaping equipment and burials (32). These develop- ments have been interpreted as a clue to increasingly sedentary foraging (33), at least at a few sites, and there is supporting evidence for sedentism in faunal remains at some Natufian sites (34). Forty-nine per- cent of 35 Early Natufian sites investigated contain some ground stone tools (Table 5). This apparent in- crease in the use of such artifacts may be reflected in dental wear patterns in Epipaleolithic skeletons, indicating an increased emphasis on ground foods from the Kebaran to the Natufian (35). The distribu- tion of ground stone sites is more restricted than in the preceding period (fig. 2d). Most assemblages occur in the well-watered regions during what was arguably a relatively "arid" period (36). This seems (28) e.g. ROSSIGNOL-STRICK et al., 1982. (29) GORING-MORRIS, 1987: 98 f. (30) BAR-YOSEF and BELFER-COHEN, 1989 : 458. (31) Levantine prehistorians have commonly assigned Natufian sites to Early and Late phases on the basis of changes in lithic technology documented by BAR-YOSEF and VALLA (1979) and VALLA (1981). These changes include lengths and type of retouch on a characteristic Natufian tool type (lunates). Recent modifica- tions of VALLA's scheme (OLSZEWSKI, 1986) suggest that the observed variations may not be entirely chronological. In this pa- per, assignments of sites to Early and Late Natufian followed those given by the excavators and these were generally based on BAR- YOSEF and VALLA's (1979) criteria or on radiocarbon dates.

The largest known assemblages are found in or near the Jordan Valley ('Ain Mallaha, Wadi Hammeh 27), or in the hilly woodlands (Hay- onim) (38). Portable (though heavy) mortars and large pestles dominate these large assemblages (fig. 3h-k). A number of these are incised and painted, almost suggesting "trade wares" (39). There is an association between the presence of ground stone and the presence of architecture in excavated sites (Table 5), a finding consistent with previous suggestions that Natufian ground stone tools may be one criterion for identifying base camps (40). In the Late Natufian (11,500-10,500 b.p.), ground stone is reported from 49 % of 45 sites investigated (Table 6). This era was apparently one of sharp cli- mate fluctuations and/or increasing aridity (41). Sites containing ground stone are now much more widely dispersed into the steppic regions. Large assemblages are located in the Negev Desert (Rosh Zin, Saflulim, Rosh Horesha) (42) and immovable bedrock mortars dominate these. A similar assemblage is documented at Hatoula but this may relate either to the Late Natufian or early Neolithic occupation (43). Portable grinding slabs or querns are noticeably more common in Late Natufian sites than in Early Natufian sites (fig. 31). They are commonly reported from sites in steppic regions outside the Negev (44). As in the Early Natufian, there is a relationship between the presence of ground stone and the presence of archi- tecture in excavated sites (Table 6). Early Holocene Assemblages (10,500-8000 b.p.) Detailed discussion of the large Neolithic assem- blages is beyond the scope of this paper, but a few brief observations may be made. The Late Natufian developments prefigure those of the PPNA and coeval assemblages, where ground stone occurs on the majority of sites. Among Harifian sites in the Negev, bedrock mortars and "cupmarks" (= small and shallow depressions) and small handstones dom- inate assemblages. In some Khiamian and PPNA sites, bedrock "cupmarks" and portable "cupmarks" (= pebble mortars) are common (45). Grinding slabs now form much higher proportions in some assem- blages and larger stone mortars are rarer (46), al- though this is not universally so (47). In PPNA and especially PPNB sites, assemblage sizes begin to be immense (48), even considering different volumes of excavation. INTERPRETATIONS OF LEVANTINE GROUND STONE ASSEMBLAGES Impressionistic assessments of ground stone as- semblage variations in Natufian sites have been used to suggest links between (1) particular tool types based on gross morphology; and (2) particular plant- food resources. In particular, it has been said that both mortars and grinding slabs imply an increased emphasis on cereals (49). It has been said that tools used mainly for pounding ("pestles", "mortars") in- dicate a dependence upon nuts in woodland-zone Natufian sites (50); and that grinding tools ("hand- stones", "querns") represent specifically seed- pro- cessing equipment (51) and are characteristic of steppic Natufian sites (52). It has also been argued that there was a shift in the Negev Desert from high frequencies of deep mor- tars ("pounding") in Late Natufian sites to high frequencies of shallow "cupmarks" ("grinding") in subsequent Harifian sites (53). The "pounding tools" are said to be related to nut processing and to have been inappropriate for cereal or seed processing. The cupmarks are said to be associated with small bell- shaped handstones (fig. 3m) with striations on a grinding surface and are said to be "seed grinding" implements (54), following Kraybill's (55) hypothe- sis that grinding tools reflect an emphasis on seed exploitation. The inference is that cereals and other (note 36 continued ) HENRY, 1986). However, pollen samples from archaeological se- diments are too subject to bias, contamination and misinterpreta- tion to be reliable as evidence for region-wide climates. Diverse data support GOLDBERG'S (1981, 1986) reconstruction of an arid Early Natufian. Therefore, this reconstruction seems to be a better working hypothesis, though it cannot yet be regarded as more than that. (37) BAR-YOSEF and KISLEV, 1989.

The idea that "grinding" tools are an index to cereal or seed exploitation in particular is still sur- prisingly common (57), despite archaeological, ethnohistoric and ethnographic evidence for the use of grinding tools to process diverse materials (58). In second-millennium B.C. Mesopotamia - an agrar- ian society known to have been dependent on cereals - grinding slabs (Sumerian NA4.HAR, Ak- kadian erû) seem to have been used for processing pistachio, cress seeds, sesame, spices, herbs, pottery temper and pigments (59). Analysis of the 19 assem- blages from Jordan indicates that many ground stone tools were versatile and multifunctional and that simple distinctions between "grinding" and "pound- ing" tools may be difficult to make. Moreover, the final forms of ground stone tools often appear to be conditioned not by deliberate manufacture of types according to norms, nor for highly-specific func- tions, but by complex patterns relating to raw mate- rial availability, duration of use, and refashioning (60). For example, this may be the case with "bedrock cupmarks" and "bedrock mortars", which may rep- resent early and later stages in the use-life of a single type of tool, as is documented for California bedrock mortars (61). Goring-Morris himself notes that many "cupmarks" have pitted surfaces suggesting percus- sion (62). If "cupmarks" and bedrock mortars are stages in reduction of a single type of tool, we would expect a continuous and linear relationship between the depths and diameters of these tools. In particular, we would expect that through long use, the depth would increase along with the diameter in a continu- ous way and most of the variability in depth could be accounted for by increases in diameter. On the other hand, if these artifacts were manufactured and used deliberately as two different types of tools, we would expect the relationship between depth and diameter to indicate two discrete groups ("shallow and small" vs. "deeper and larger"). Figure 4a shows a scattergram of the depths and diameters of 17 bedrock "mortars" and "cupmarks" from the Late Natufian site of Rosh Zin (63). A linear regression analysis suggests that depth cannot be well accounted for by diameter. The scattergram suggests the presence of two discrete groups of tools. However, a different situation obtains at the site of (56) GORING-MORRIS, 1987 : 439. (57) HENRY, 1989 : 37.

(R squared = 0.5742, Slope = 0.604, Y-intercept = 1.914, Standard Error = 51.884, Significance = 0.000). 'Ain Ghazal Survey Site 14, which from surface in- dications seems to date to the Late Epipale- olithic (64). Numerous bedrock mortars and "cupmarks" were discovered on the surface. Of 25 measured, the relationship between depth and diame- ter seems linearly related (fig. 4b). Thus, about 60 % of the variability in depth is accounted for by vari- ability in diameter. This finding is consistent with a model of progressive reduction through use (from "small, shallow cupmarks" to "deep mortars"). How- ever, this hypothesis should be tested on larger samples from Natufian, Harifian and Khiamian sites such as Hatoula (65), Saflulim (66) and G-8 (67). In the case of bell-shaped handstones, there is evidence that such tools were multifunctional and were not solely "grinding" tools. The Negev Harifian example (from Shluhat Harif) illustrated by Goring- Morris (68) has 8 flake scars rising along the side of the tool from the grinding surface. These scars may represent "use wear" from pounding. The ex- ample from Abu Salem (69) does not seem to have such flake scars, but "pitted" marks on the "grinding surface" appear to suggest some pounding. Nearly- identical bell shaped handstones occur at PPNB Beidha (70) and were examined closely by the author. Of a sample of 11 such tools, 7 display flake scars with negative bulbs of percussion next to the grinding surface (as appears to be the case with the Shluhat Harif example). The number of such scars varied between 1 and 4 and displayed no patterning suggesting deliberate "retouch" in manufacture (71). In these examples, the "bell mullers" were more properly understood as "muller/pestles" and indicate both grinding and pounding. These observations suggest that it is risky to sug- gest links between specific resources and gross tool morphology. Only residue studies can be considered definitive evidence for determining the resources processed on ground stone tools (72). GROUND STONE TOOLS, PLANT-PROCES- SING, AND CEREALS In many ways, the eventual importance of the cereals in the Near Eastern diet has strongly affected the kinds of questions asked about agricultural origins (73). But cereal domestication was scarcely inevitable and in most respects, the particular vari- ables governing the choice of plant foods are still not understood. These variables may have been nutritional, social or ideological. Prehistorians have often regarded wild cereals as being exceptionally "attractive" resources as a result of their large seed sizes, high local densities and storability (74). These observations have led some scholars to think of Natufian foraging as being an "affluent" system based on the abundance of wild cereals (75). Sub- sequent domestication of cereals was considered a response to stress on this "abundant" system. (64) SIMMONS and KAFAFI, 1988. (65) LECHEVALLIER and RONEN, 1985.

Robust an- nuals do have large seeds, but only in comparison to other seed foods. Moreover, despite their local densities, the cereals must be harvested quickly (76). Removing or reducing the unwanted fiber of the glumes from the nutrient-bearing seed (dehusking) is essential for cereal consumption. Consumption of cereals on any scale demands either some form of roasting and/or a grinding/pounding process (77). The arduousness of rendering husked wild cereals edible has been widely underestimated (78). Experimental data suggest that dehusking of wild cereals is time-consuming (79). These data indicate that although seed exploitation can be very produc- tive (of kilocalories per hour), when pounding or grinding with simple tools is involved, caloric pro- ductivity is brought down (Table 7) (80). Similarly, ethnographic data on foragers in semiarid and arid regions suggest that seed exploitation is "costly" and labor-intensive in comparison to exploitation of tubers, fruits and nuts - largely as a result of the processing via grinding and pounding (81). Late Pleistocene exploitation of husked cereals - or any foods high in fiber content - may have also been influenced by processing costs (82). The para- dox is that the very qualities making seeds difficult to process - small particle sizes and hard, dry casings - are what make them easily storable and therefore highly desirable in some situations, partic- ularly where seasonal stresses are great. Flexible so- lutions to this paradox - in which tradeoffs were made between intensive processing labor and the need for stored supplies - may have been an impor- tant consideration in early grass seed exploitation on a significant scale. Archaeobotanical remains from Late Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic sites in the Near East are scanty and affected by differential preservation and re- covery techniques. Not all species in an archae- obotanical assemblage can be assumed to have been food plants. Seeds are often better preserved through preparation techniques such as charring (83). Methods for identification of soft-tissue plant parts in archaeobotanical assemblages are now being developed (84). Such methods will significantly alter present understanding of plant exploitation in the late Pleistocene. Even so, presently available evi- dence appears to suggest dietary diversity and local- ized exploitation strategies (85). Plant foods recovered from these sites in the Levant include chenopods, nuts, legumes, possibly root foods (86), and diverse seed plants other than cereals. At pre- sent, the earliest significant samples of wild cereals in the Levant come from Ohalo II (87), roughly coeval with the glacial maximum. On present evi- dence, early occurrences of domesticated cereals come from but a few localities (88). Local variations in archaeobotanical assemblages are quite marked even well into the Neolithic (89). There is no real certainty about precisely when the cereals (wild or cultivated) actually began to dominate diets across the region - although osteological evidence indicates that this may have happened in the Late Natufian (90). There is no reason to assume a priori that mor- tars, pestles, grinding slabs and handstones reflect cereal processing alone. While some of these tools were certainly usable for cereal dehusking (stone mortars) and groat production (grinding slabs, hand- stones), numerous other resources might have been processed on such artifacts, including fibrous tubers, nuts, fruits, legumes, chenopods (91) and a vast array of seeds obtained in "lawnmower" harvesting (92). The reasons for the presence of large numbers of pounding tools in the Early Natufian may have been diverse and variable from one site to the next and may have had more to do with group size than with specific resources. The occasional occurrence of breached mortars in very early assemblages (93) sug- gests that at least some tools were used for very heavy, direct pounding. Experimental data indicate that cereal dehusking does not require pounding with great force (94). This would tend to suggest that some of the functions of these mortars involved other resources. However, if one important function of these tools was for cereal dehusking, the ethno- (76) ZOHARY, 1969 : 57. (77) STAHL, 1989; HILLMAN et al., 1990.

GROUND STONE TOOLS AND MOBILITY Grinding and pounding foodstuffs on stone tools have the following advantages: (1) raw materials are readily available and can be drafted into use expe- diently; (2) stone is extremely durable. Assuming that wooden tools for such operations were made and used from much earlier in the Paleolithic (96), what would account for the documented increase in stone tools in the Early Natufian ? One obvious suggestion is that durability had become a crucial concern. This might particularly result from a shift to processing very dry and hard plant parts or an absence or low quantity of available wood for raw materials (97). Durability would also be important in cases in which very large quantities needed to be processed for use by a substantial-sized social group for long periods of time. Yet the use of stone grinding/pounding tools also creates logistical problems which must be solved if a group is dependent on foods which must be processed in this way. Stone tools must be con- venient to the location of consumption. This may present real problems if the adaptation is a highly mobile one. A good heavy-duty stone grinding tool may be in contradiction with the needs of mobility. What are some of the solutions which can resolve this contradiction ? Some of the options available to a mobile forag- ing group requiring this method of processing are (1) the use of robust but lightweight, portable stone tools; (2) caching of tools at known locations, either residence sites or special caches throughout the re- gion; (3) simply drafting into use in an expedient way nearby stones and discarding them after a few uses (98); (4) a restriction of the foraging range in order to move the staple resources to the locus of consumption with minimum traveling distance - i.e. a decrease in mobility of the adaptation. Cane (99) documented an unwillingness of Australian groups to travel far in search of seeds, since processing costs were so high for these foods. In California, the place- ment of bedrock mortars used for acorn processing seems to have been largely determined by proximity to oak trees (100) and the Kung cache tools near ri- pening mongongo groves (101). These considerations raise the possibility that heavy or non-portable ground stone tools at sites are an index to how close by were resources processed on them (102). CONCLUSION The appearance of large numbers of ground stone assemblages in the Early Natufian may not be an indication of "affluence" but rather a clue to in- tensification of labor in plant-processing. Experi- mental and ethnographic data suggest that stone mortars - such as dominate some Early Natufian as- semblages - are excellent cereal-dehusking tools if used with wooden pestles (103). It is probable that Early Natufian ground stone tools were multi- functional and the use of Early Natufian mortars as dehusking tools should not be overemphasized. How- ever, there is archaeobotanical evidence for exploi- tation of wild cereals by these populations (104). Some ethnographic data from foraging groups in semiarid regions appear to suggest that exploitation of seeds on a large scale takes place in response to the failure of harvests of resources more easily processed and that seeds may often be a "stress" food. However, such stresses may be social or ide- ological as well as environmental or nutritional. Thus far, Natufian osteological evidence does not indicate nutritional stress (105). Archaeological evidence from the Levant ap- pears to suggest increasingly intensive reoccupations of the same camps from the glacial maximum (18,000 b.p.; "Kebaran") onward, perhaps indicating increasingly restricted hunting ranges (106). By the Early Natufian, the sizes, architecture and burials at some sites point to a further development of this pat- tern. Until the Early Natufian, relatively few sites (15-25 %) contain any ground stone, and sites con- taining small assemblages appear to have relatively generalized distributions (fig. 2a-c). In the Early Natufian, 49 % of the known sites contain ground stone assemblages and many of the sites with ground stone occur in a north-south belt in or near the Jor- dan Valley (fig. 2d). Many of the Early Natufian ground stone assemblages (and two of the largest as- semblages) are located not far from what would have been the shores of Lake Lisan (fig. 2d), which had begun to retreat prior to the Early Natufian (107). The large Early Natufian assemblages may be related to local group size or to a kind of "intensification of labor" in plant-food exploitation - or both. The presence of ground stone in Early Natufian sites is (95) WRIGHT, n.d. (96) HILLMAN et al., 1990. (97) STAHL, 1989. (98) BINFORD, 1979. (99) CANE, 1989 : 118.

The data sug- gest that increasing sedentism may indeed have reached a "point of no return" (108) in this period - possibly, a point at which a more labor-intensive diet was accepted. This diet must have included the wild cereals but there is as yet no evidence that the cereals dominated the diet across the region. Were social arrangements created by increasingly re- stricted hunting territories a stimulus to the accep- tance of low returns on labor-intensive foods ? Did semi-sedentism exacerbate this pattern, especially under conditions of Late Pleistocene environmental change ? Did storage become more imperative than labor minimization in plant-food processing ? Did cereals become dietary staples only when the need for highly storable foodstuffs outweighed the desire to minimize processing costs (109) ? There are suggestions that in the Early Natufian, vessel/mortars and pestles carried strong symbolic associations. A number of the pestles were carved into fluted shapes, or to represent ungulate hoofs or anthropomorphic figures (1 10). Some of the ves- sel/mortars were elaborately incised on the exterior rims and red paint was added to the incisions (111). Most tellingly, the occurrence of mortars and pestles in Natufian burials may testify to the special mean- ing attached to these tools (112). Such tools do not appear to have been prominent in burial practices of Neolithic and later populations in the Levant. The role of plant processing - and the choices of specific plants themselves - may have been laden with ide- ological or ritual associations. If these processing tools do represent a shift toward greater labor in- tensity in plant-food exploitation, the ritual associa- tions may reflect some of the social implications of the change. The apparent increase in grinding slabs, which begins in the Late Natufian and becomes pronounced in the PPNA, may -not represent a change in re- sources but rather an intensification of "production" of some of the same resources exploited before the Late Natufian. Reduction of seed or other foods to finer particle sizes may have permitted the same (or shrinking ?) harvests to support more people. Experi- ments have suggested that the best tools for grain dehusking are mortars and pestles, as long as one or both of the tools is made of wood (113). The value of a further grinding process (using handstones and slabs) may lie in the exposure of more surface area, permitting more nutrients to be absorbed by the body (114). Bran-rich dehusked grain would have had a tendency to move through the digestive tract quickly; further milling would have had the effect of retarding this speeding effect (115). In nutritional terms, the same amount of harvested grain may ac- tually produce more food if particle sizes are smaller. The same may apply to many other kinds of plant foods (116). The high frequencies of Late Natufian and early Neolithic grinding equipment may be a clue to a need to maximize the amount of edible and digestible food obtained from a particular territory, despite the effort involved. Social acceptance of labor-intensive foods as staples may have been more critical to the eventual adoption of agriculture than any climate or environmental variables alone. Much of the debate surrounding the origins of cereal domestication has focused on whether the cul- tural processes were relatively rapid, or long and slow. Some workers view domestication as a matter of gradual increases in the manipulation of plants by man (117). Others have postulated that the essen- tial changes took place over a briefer period, partic- ularly in the Natufian (118). Many of the latter scenarios have emphasized, in one way or another, the importance of ground stone technology as a pre- requisite for domestication and as a partial explana- tion for why foragers did not develop agriculture much sooner (119). Pre-agrarian populations had to be "ready with the right technology" before they could take steps toward cultivation. But ground stone technologies, like "broad spec- trum" diets, are very ancient (120). If this technology was a prerequisite for cultivation, then this criterion was met by 40,000 b.p. To whatever extent grinding and pounding tools may reflect plant processing, the presently-available evidence indicates both (1) a long-term, slow development of small and infrequent assemblages until 12,500 b.p.; and (2) a noticeable "quantum leap" in the Early Natufian, not only in the proportion of sites containing such artifacts, but also in the size of some of the assemblages. The ground stone and archaeobotanical data suggest that: (1) Dietary diversity is ancient and diets in- cluded cereals from at least as far back as 19,000 b.p.; (2) At present, the earliest significant samples of wild cereals from archaeological deposits (Ohalo II) and the earliest vessel-mortars both occur in the time range of the glacial maximum ("Ke- baran") - a period of cold and dry ("stress ?") con- ditions; (108) BAR-YOSEF and BELFER-COHEN, 1989 : 490.

Thus, this pattern is broadly coeval with (or immediately precedes) the earliest morphologically domestic cereals (PPNA). Climate conditions in the Late Natufian are still un- known but may have been characterized by year-to- year unpredictability and sharp seasonality (121). These observations should not obscure the cen- tral fact that, whatever their functions, large ground stone assemblages in the Levant first appear in con- junction with large sites, architecture and burials which suggest increasing territoriality and group size (122). Semi-sedentism - if it is best described by that word - seems to be the clearest link between ground stone and other variables. The significance of correlations between ground stone assemblages and the patchy archaeobotanical record is still un- certain and awaits residue analyses.
