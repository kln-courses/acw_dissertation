<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMP1RES.1 (Plates I-II.) By the Right Hon. the VISCOUNT BRYCE. The part played by religious sentiment and worship in the public life of the ancient world was generally underestimated by historians of the older school. Persons of imagination and taste appreciated the poetical aspects of the ancient mythologies, while the grosser and more cruel superstitions were dwelt upon by those who compared the worships and faiths of Greece, Rome, Syria and Egypt with Christianity and Islam. But comparatively few writers saw, as we see now, how important a factor religious sentiment was, and indeed could not but be, in the political sphere. There are two respects in which it was then and always has been a force of immense though uncertain potency. It acted upon the whole mass of a people, and more powerfully upon the lower than upon the more educated class. It touched those whom ordinary political discontents or aspirations might scarcely affect. When it acted, it was apt to act suddenly and violently, like an explosive substance. These characteristics made it formidable, and all the more formidable because often unpredictable in its action. Emotional forces usually are unpredictable. Economic grievances and aspirations can be to some extent observed and measured, and their results can therefore be more or less foreseen. Religious passion, working obscurely and silently in masses of men, may easily escape notice, and no one can tell beforehand to what temperature it may rise. Every traveller who has read some little history, and every historian who has done some little travelling, finds himself attracted to that side of history which has heretofore been least studied, the part played in the various changes that pass upon races and states by the ordinary man, his beliefs, his habits of thought, his aims and ideals. He is mostly in the background of history, dimly seen, not always understood even by contemporary writers. But he counts, and the great rulers have usually felt that they must count with him. He may have little knowledge, little play of intellect,. little individuality of will, but he has emotions, and among them the religious emotions, which cover a relatively larger part of his. horizon than they do with the educated man. 1 In revising this paper for publication I have J. S. Reid of Cambridge, for which I thank them been aided by valuable suggestions from my friends both. Professor F. Haverfield of Oxford and Professor</page><page sequence="2">2 RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. When therefore we study the history of any empire, that is to say, any wide dominion in which one nation rules other bodies of men, peoples or tribes, of diverse blood, speech and habits, we naturally ask: What are the circumstances and conditions which enable the ruling nation to rule and dispose the subject races to submit ? Of these circumstances and conditions religion must evidently be one, and one of such importance as to deserve careful examination. So in reflecting upon the empire of Rome and en- deavouring to compare it with other wide dominions composed of diverse races, the student asks himself: How did religion affect the growth and the long endurance of Roman power ? Did it prompt any resistance on the part of the peoples successively con- quered ? Did it breed disaffection among them after their subjection ? Or did it operate in any way to hold them together and reconcile them to what was at first an alien rule ? It is to this topic that I propose to address myself, beginning with the Roman empire, and then proceeding to compare with the religious policy followed by Rome in her provinces the phenomena that belong to the empires of Spain in the New World, of Russia in Asia, and of Britain in India. The religious condition of the Mediterranean and western European world during the ages when Rome was conquering and ruling that world was far more unlike the condition of Europe during the last few centuries than most readers of history realise. The contrast between heathenism and Christianity, or between polytheism and monotheism, does not express the whole difference, which goes much deeper. In the ancient world religion was primarily local, attached to particular spots or tribes, and there was no sharp line between a man, or his ghost, and a deity. The human and the divine shaded off into each other. There was room for any number of gods, all equally real, though not all equally powerful. So there was no reason why the worshipper of any one god, or group of gods, should object to the worship of any others. Nor did such objection in fact arise. When Lucretius complained of the evils wrought by religion in the famous line, Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum, he referred to the terrors with which superstition darkened human life, and to the fear of something after death, the ' strepitus Acherontis avari.' He was not thinking of that which a modern writer would set down as the greatest evil religion has wrought, persecution, because there was in the ancient world practically no religious persecution till the Sassanid kings of Persia forbade their Christian subjects to inter their dead. None, that is to say, until the persecution of the Christians within the empire began, as to which something will be said presently; and this persecution was political</page><page sequence="3">RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. rather than religious. No one tried to suppress any other man's worship, or wished to impose his own. Every tribe, every city, had its local deities, some of them what we should call spirits, or perhaps fetishes, some of them demigods with a definite personality, some of them divine powers distinctly personalised and worshipped in great temples containing sacred images. The two latter classes, and especially the last, might be worshipped by other tribes and cities also, perhaps, like Cybele the Mother of the gods, over a whole country or even in several countries. Very often a spiritual power which was substantially the same in its conception and attributes received worship under different names in different cities or countries, and with rites essentially similar though differing in details. The leading figures in the Hellenic pantheon are the best example of well-defined gods, anthropomorphically personalised gods, recognised over a wide area. Such eastern deities as Osiris, Astarte, Adonis, are more elusive and variable. And besides all these divine or semi-divine personages there were also the ghosts of ancestors, worshipped by a family or a tribe only, and the ghosts of the mythical founders of cities or of heroes famous in their legends. The common worship of a deity was of course a bond between all his worshippers, but chiefly so when the deity was specially associated with the city or district wherein the worshippers dwelt or whence their ancestors came. He and his temple were in such cases centres of a political as well as a religious cohesion.1 Such was the Pythian Apollo for the Dorians, the Delian Apollo for the early Ionians, such was Iupiter Capitolinus for the Romans, such was their Melkarth or Moloch (king of the city) for the men of Sidon, Tyre and Carthage. Of the beliefs and rites of the western races, Celts, Iberians and Teutons, we know less; but among them also we seem to meet the same mixture of the worship of spirits and of such conspicuous objects as sun and moon with deities more distinctly personified, such as were Odin, Thor, and Frey. The stronger the intellectual power and the more active the imagination of a race, so much the more does it tend to develop a definite mythology out of the vaguer conceptions of the savage. Sometimes the notion of a supreme power, a force behind and above all other manifestations of spirit action, is dimly caught, but it is not personified, and it is always conceived of as compatible with a confused multitude of minor deities. This was the sort of polytheistic world Rome conquered. There was plenty of religion in it, plenty of objects to be worshipped, plenty of devotion to them; but the deities and the worships were 1 The temple-states of Asia Minor furnish instructive examples. 3</page><page sequence="4">RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. all primarily local. 1 The Roman gods, so far as they were not dry abstractions like Fortune and Concord, were also local, from the rural spirit of field or wood up to Jove in his shrine on the Capitol. Some peoples had gods of the whole nation or race; in some countries a deity was worshipped by several tribes or peoples in common, but even in these cases faith and devotion became intense only in connexion with special shrines or images, such as was that of the Ephesian Artemis, 'whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.' 2 Let us see how these religious conditions affected the conquering march of Rome. Religion offered practically no obstacle to that march. The only national deity encountered by Roman arms, who nerved his children to fight for his fiery altar, was the Carthaginian Melkarth, and his appeal was to the Carthaginians only, not to the mercenary soldiers that filled their armies. The local centres of worship were, in almost all the countries, too weak to form centres of resistance. As the conquerors did not threaten, were in fact ready to recognise, the presiding gods of Greek and Asiatic cities and districts, there was no religious issue involved till the tide of Roman conquest approached Jerusalem. Neither does the resistance offered to the legions in Gaul and Spain and Germany seem to have been stimulated by local religious feeling, though supernatural help may sometimes have been invoked, as when Druids ranged along the shore of Mona (Anglesey) sought to terrify the victorious army of Ostorius Scapula by their imprecations. 3 We hear of no interference with the religion of the conquered, save that in Gaul Druidism, at least in the form of its alleged practice of human sacrifice, was forbidden, on grounds, it would seem, of humanity rather than from any desire to interfere with the veneration of native deities.4 It had been an obstacle to the Romanisation of Gaul, but the imperial government at first dealt cautiously with it, trying rather to supersede it by the worship of the emperor than to provoke it by open hostility. Everywhere over the empire everybody worshipped whom he pleased, the Romans themselves taking part in the sacrifices offered to the gods of the provincials. Why not, when foreign gods from Egypt or Syria had, even under the republic, become fashionable at Rome itself ? Catullus tells us of a lady who asked him for the loan of a litter to go to the shrine of Serapis. The habit spread till, in the second and third centuries of our era, Mithras had come to be the favourite deity and the patron of soldiers in particular, as we learn from countless inscriptions all the way from the Wall of Hadrian to the frontier of Persia. 1 Upon the continued sanctity of the same 2 Acts xix, 27. seats of worship in succeeding ages under different 3 Tac Annals xiv 3 religions, see Sir W.

In a world so full of supernatural beings there was no clear line drawn between creatures of earth and denizens of heaven. The spirits of dead ancestors were worshipped among Hellenes and Italians just as they are worshipped to-day in China and Japan. It is a kind of worship which doubtless prevailed in one form or another in most of the races of mankind. When Hellenes and Italians entered the East they were little surprised to find that not merely the disembodied spirit but the living spirit of a potentate could be accepted as a deity. Among Sumerians and Accadians the king was a deity. The Egyptians treated their reigning Pharaoh as a god. By his coronation he became, like the ruling Inca in Peru, the Child of the Sun. These divine honours were continued to the Ptolemies, when under the Lagid line Egypt had again a national, though not a native, dynasty. Similar adoration was rendered to the Seleucid kings. The Book of Daniel, written in their days, attributes it to the Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar. So was it given to the Attalids at Pergamus, and to Mithradates of Pontus, and to many another Asiatic sovereign. It was so easy a method for flattering the powerful that, when Roman conquerors appeared, it was used to propitiate them, as it had been used by the Asiatic Greeks in flattery of the Spartan Lysander. The Greeks of Chalcis in Euboea built a temple to Titus Flamininus, associating him with Hercules and Apollo, and hymns in honour of their benefactor continued to be sung down to the days of Plutarch.1 The Syracusans instituted games (' Marcellia ') in honour of Marcellus, the Asiatics 'Mucia' for the glory of Q. Mucius Scaevola. The provincials of Asia wished to erect a temple to Marcus Cicero and his brother; and Marcus (who had dissuaded this) later in his life again declined like honours offered by the Cilicians. Marcus Cicero himself, in the agony of his grief for the loss of his daughter Tullia, sought consolation in planning a temple to her deified spirit.2 If these honours could without offence be paid to living rulers, how much more might that which each family rendered to its own ancestors be rendered by the state to a great departed spirit ? When Iulius Caesar fell, the senate decreed to him a divinity which, says Suetonius, he had already obtained in the belief of the multitude.3 It was a new thing in Italy, but the habit of spirit-worship commended it to all but the educated or sceptical. Its political utility being seen, it was imitated. Mark Antony caused himself to be worshipped as a sort of incarnation of Bacchus, Sextus Pompey as a Neptune. Augustus received an apotheosis more formal and solemn than even that of his uncle, and from his time onwards 1 Plut. Flamin. c. xvi. 3 'Non solum vocibus decernentium sed etiam 2 Ad Att. xii. 18 f. persuasione vulgi.' Sueton. Vita Iulii Caesaris. 5</page><page sequence="6">6 RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. every emperor who departed this life in the odour, if not of sanctity, yet of virtue, having made a fairly creditable record, was deified and thenceforth referred to as Divus. Some hesitation was shown in the case of Claudius who, if not hated, was little respected, but for him, too, the door was opened, though Seneca made merry over the ceremonies of his admission to Olympus. Nor was it to individual conquerors only that these divine honours were accorded. Even before the destruction of Carthage, and when the Asiatic kings were still formidable, the people of Smyrna, seeing that Rome was virtually mistress of the Mediter- ranean countries, erected in I95 B.C. a temple to the city of Rome.1 To the Greeks and Asiatics the city enthroned in the West was greater than any of the conquering generals whom she sent forth. They came and went and passed away. She remained an enduring Power, unshaken even by the civil wars in which her children tore one another. Pompey and Caesar, Brutus and Antony, fought their battles by sea and land, and were no more seen, but Rome, in whose name all their commands were issued, stood exalted above them and still held sway from generation to generation. Her power was ' great and terrible, and diverse from all that were before it.' Its remoteness and its mystery, and above all its unshaken permanence, inspired an awe deeper than the fleeting triumphs of Antiochus or Mithradates or Tigranes. No wonder that Rome seemed to be godlike. So things stood when the fall of Antony had left Gaius Iulius Caesar Octavianus Augustus as the chief visible representative of Rome's authority, master of the civilised world, a world weary of strife which gladly hailed its ruler as the giver of peace. In Italy itself men accepted him as divine, the nephew and adopted son of the deified Iulius. Virgil was the greatest among many bards who gave expression to the feeling. The famous lines in the prologue to the Georgics2 assume the emperor as already a deity, and ask only in what form his divine character will manifest itself. The last lines of the same poem speak of him as treading the path upward to Olympus. Horace is not behind in similar ascriptions of divinity. Naturally cool and cautious, and never forgetting the circum- stances of his uncle's death, Augustus sought in his own country rather to conceal than to proclaim his power, and avoided whatever could expose him to the envy and malicious criticism of the great families of Rome. He refused official recognition of worship addressed to him in Italy itself, though Horace tells us, and inscrip- 1Tacitus, Ann. iv, 56, where an interesting emperors I have derived much assistance from account is given of the rival claims of Smyrna and Boissier, Religion ronzaine, ch. i, 'l'Apotheose Sardis to be allowed to erect a temple to Tiberius, imperiale.' the senate ultimately deciding for the former.

Spanish Tarragon had set up to him an altar early in his reign; Gallic Narbonne decreed sacrifices on the anniversaries of his birth and his accession; a temple honoured him at Nicomedia; but the most imposing seat of his worship was on the fortress height of Pergamos.2 Here, about 28 B.C. there rose to Dea Roma and to him that majestic temple, the strong foundations of which, with the long flights of marble steps leading up to the great platform, we still admire. Ruins of some few others remain, and of two of these representations are given in plates I and II.3 Augustus, though personally not a vain man, had perceived the political advantage to be derived from the association of the reigning sovereign (for in the provinces the Imperator was recog- nised as a sovereign) with the worship of the City. His successors followed in his wake, and the worship of the emperor became recognised in every province as an official function of high dignity and moment. It is from the records and inscriptions relating to the great province of Asia that we gather most of what is known regarding the imperial cult. This originally took the form of joint worship of the goddess Rome and Augustus, the former contributing a mystic quality, the latter a living concrete embodiment. As time went on the emperor superseded the goddess, and upon him was concentrated the awe and reverence of the worshippers. Once a year a solemn assembly was held under the presidency of the pro- consul, the chief cities of the province being represented by delegates whom they had chosen. This was the KOLvov 'Acrtia. Sacrifices were offered to the emperor. Games, a frequent accom- paniment of every great ceremonial, were celebrated in his honour. Both functions.were carried out on a costly and magnificent scale, the money being provided by the cities, which vied with one another in displays of a not altogether disinterested loyalty. Vast crowds assembled at a festival which combined patriotism, amuse- ment and opportunities for municipal vanity, with a certain measure of emotional feeling, the emotions of awe for a mighty power and of pride in realising a connexion with it which gave to the provincial a sense of participation in its greatness. There were 1 Prof. Haverfield tells me that there is epigraphic in the Roman Empire, p. 297, and as to the province evidence of shrines and priests of Augustus in ten of Asia and imperial worship there see Chapot, or twelve Italian cities which were in some way La Province romaine d'Asie. specially associated with him as their founder or 3 These plates represent the temple of Rome and protector.

This sort of imperial religion would seem to have prevailed everywhere over the Roman world, though less conspicuous in Italy than elsewhere. We have mention of it in Britain, for at Colchester there had been erected to Claudius a temple, regarded as a strong- hold of enduring dominion, on the maintenance of which the local priests wasted their substance.1 Its chief seat in the West was the great altar of Rome and Augustus at Lyons, the priesthood of which was an honour the proudest chiefs of Gaul strove with one another to attain.2 As already observed, Augustus did not discourage it, but did not openly encourage it, so far at least as the upper classes were concerned, though he allowed a third figure, his own' Genius Augusti,' to be set up besides the two' Lares Compitales ' (now called 'Augusti') at the crossings of streets. Even before his death, the fraternity of Augustales, who from small beginnings -they were mostly well-to-do freedmen-acquired some social importance in the middle classes, were devoted to his worship.3 Tiberius was even more cautious than his predecessor, fearing perhaps the sarcasms of the unfriendly Roman nobility; but the mad Caligula held himself to be in verity a god, and gods the emperors practically thereafter were to the vast bulk of their subjects. Temples were built to them in their lifetimes. Some- times there might be in a city one central 'templum divorum' for all the deified deceased rulers, and within it might be shrines, like side chapels in churches, each dedicated to one particular divine ghost. As time went on, the shrines of the less notable sovereigns were neglected, but those of the most illustrious, and of the reigning monarch, continued to receive conspicuous honours. The statues of the Caesars were venerated more than any other, and Tertullian declares that ' men perjure themselves more readily when swearing by all the other gods than when the oath is " by the genius of the emperor." ' 4 Only two sections of the Roman subjects, the monotheistic Jews and the monotheistic Christians, refused to worship with the rest. The Jews could not accept the emperor as divine, because for them, at least, there was no god but Jehovah. But they did not set out to propagate their own faith, for it also was national, and seemed to the Romans to be local. Proselytes came to them, but were not sought for. Thus they were not deemed hostile to the civil power of the empire, any more than the votaries of other Syrian cults, 1 Tac. Ann. xiv, 3I. 3 Especially in Italy, where the freedmen were the trading class. As to these Augustales see 2 See Prof. Reid's Municipalities of the Roman Municipalities of the Roman Empire, pp. 508-50o.

So long as the Christians were regarded as a mere Jewish sect, they received a like toleration. Gallio, for instance, that sensible proconsul of Achaia, who has been unfairly made the representative of indifferentism in religion, conceiving the charges brought by the Corinthian Jews against St. Paul to be matters of Jewish sacred law, declined all jurisdiction. His was, he said, not an ecclesiastical court. 1 When, however, the Roman authorities had come to see the widening rift between Christians and the Jews, and to learn that the new religion was an aggressive force, they scented danger. The Christians formed a society, a secret society, and all associations or organisations were suspect except those which the civil power had recognised. To stand aloof from the worship of Italian or Hellenic or Oriental deities would have caused no remark. To denounce them as being all alike false would excite local hostility from those piously attached to, or, like the craftsmen of Ephesus,2 sordidly interested in, any particular worship, yet not the displeasure of the government, except, indeed, so far as tumults might follow. But to refuse to honour the altars of the emperor or his Genius, whom all the votaries of all the other religions were ready to treat as sacred, seemed flagrant disloyalty, a revolt against the established order, a transfer of allegiance to the secret society which recognised another, even if only a spiritual, king. It was not religious intolerance in our sense of the word that prompted the persecution of the Christians, but political fear, that kind of fear which the working of an incal- culable emotional force always inspires in the hard dry man of the world who dislikes what he does not understand and cannot control by his usual methods. Nothing, therefore, given the political conditions of the time, was more natural than that the Roman government should try to break up the secret society and punish those who refused to recognise that divine character of the head of the state which all other provincial subjects admitted. The out- break of ferocious cruelty under Nero would seem to have been isolated. Systematically severe persecution began in the days of Domitian, a tyrant whose natural malignity was stimulated by the vanity which made him dwell, far more than his father Vespasian or his brother Titus, upon the sacredness of his throne, and desire to be addressed as ' Dominus' and ' Deus.' During the next two centuries, though the laws and administrative traditions which prohibited the preaching of Christianity and enabled an official to require accused persons to abjure it, remained theoretically in force, it was only at rare intervals that they were applied sternly and generally over the empire. The correspondence of Pliny with the 1 Acts xviii, 12-17. 9 2 Acts xix, 24.</page><page sequence="10">10 RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. emperor Trajan presents a lively picture of the dilemma in which sensible and humane officials were placed between the established policy which required the 'prava superstitio' to be extirpated, and the harshness of putting to death persons of unblemished character, good subjects in every point except that of refusing a test of loyalty which all other subjects accepted. The Christians were willing to swear 'per salutem,' though not 'per Genium Caesaris.' They could point to those passages in their apostolic writings in which St. Peter and St. Paul enjoined obedience to the powers that be, and to the Basileus in particular, as ordained by God. They were ready to discharge every civic duty of a secular kind, and many of them served in the army, though it is hard to see how they were excused from the religious acts which these duties involved; but the test of incense sprinkled on the emperor's altar, the test most usual, because it could be applied everywhere and struck at Christians and Jews alone, this they could not accept, just as the Armenian martyrs of I895, deserted by Christendom in their hour of need, could not hold up that one finger (instead of three) which was meant to denote the acceptance of Islam. The deification of virtuous emperors, and the worship of their spirits and of ' Dea Roma' also, went on, though with diminished pomp and doubtless with diminished interest also, till Christianity rose to power in the days of Constantine. Even then the feeling of what one may call their ' super-humanity' died slowly. Constantine allowed temples to be erected to him, though worship was not to be offered in them,1 and not till Gratian did any emperor refuse the title of pontifex maximus. The festival games continued, and the buildings were used as meeting-places, like town-halls, where decurions assembled to pass votes honouring the emperor. If he was no longer a god, he was the powerful patron of Christianity, loyalty to whom the church could gladly preach. How much substance was there in this emperor worship ? Was it a solemnly acted sham, a piece of elaborate flattery carried on in a courtier-like spirit by those who wished to earn merit in the eyes of the administration ? Did it arouse any real emotion ? Did it exert an influence of political value ? Slender as is the direct evidence on the subject, it indicates more reality of sentiment behind the ceremonial than moderns would be disposed to expect. Primitive religions in their origin were all essentially a worship of Power, a power to do harm which had to be propitiated, a power to protect or bless which had to be won over and used, whether 1 Boissier notes a trace of the old deification in a more than the assumption in the English pulpit after sermon of St. Ambrose, where he represents I66o that king Charles I was among the saints, and Theodosius, assumed to be already in heaven, the like sanguine assumption of the French pulpit welcoming Gratian thither; but is this anything regarding Louis XIV ?</page><page sequence="11">RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. it dwelt in the ghost of an ancestor or in the spirit of a rock, or tree, or river. When mythology develops with the progress of the human mind, and anthropomorphic deities have become the objects of devotion, the motives that prompt the devotion are the same, though imagination may adorn and refine its object. Melkarth is the protector of Tyre, whose favour must be retained by sacrifices even of human victims, the Dioscuri the patrons of the Dorians, Iupiter Optimus Maximus of the Quirites. In every city the local deities. were worshipped, sometimes the old nature spirits, sometimes sacred images embodying at a particular shrine the local manifestation of a deity worshipped elsewhere, sometimes famous men who had passed into the rank of divinities. The gods of a city were part of the city, closely associated with its fortunes. Faith in them was a political force, holding the community together, and forming the kernel of its patriotism. Thus the worship of power as divine, and the sense of civic union as a religious bond, went together. And so when the city communities were absorbed, without losing their individuality, into the larger whole of the empire, the local religious sentiment towards the local deities retained its place within the sentiment of devotion to the head of the imperial system. Many of them had entered that system willingly, for it promised a peace more secure than they had ever enjoyed before. Virgil meant this when he wrote of Augustus: Victorque volentes Per populos dat iura viamque adfectat Olympo.1 The worship of Rome and the emperor was not therefore the sham that moderns may deem it. There was no clear line separating humanity from divinity, not that humanity was higher, but that divinity was lower, than it stands in our conception. The Romans deified abstractions, the Greeks deified heroes, both they and the Orientals deified the forces of nature, why not then another Power more tangible and not less strong than any of these ? We must not look in ancient worships, and least of all in the nature worships of the East, either for that moral quality, or that introspective quality, which the idea of Religion suggests to modern philosophic thought. 2 Enough if imagination were fired and awe awakened. Nor was a personal touch wanting. The achievements or the virtues of a ruler might inspire affection. While Marcus Aurelius lived, the man was held impious who had not in his house an image of the philosophic emperor, and nearly two centuries after his death there were still families which kept his statue among their penates, and some 1 Georg. iv, 561. of faith and perjury, they protect suppliants. 2 Though of course the gods are, both in Greece So among the heathen Celts, the Sun and the (Iliad, iii, 276-280) and at Rome, to some extent Wind smote Loigaire king of Erin who had broken the guardians of moral duty.

II</page><page sequence="12">12 RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. who believed that his spirit appeared to them in dreams to give helpful counsel. Anyhow, whether or no this rendering of worship to the state and its head enriched the life and gratified the feelings of the pro- vincial subjects of Rome, it had certainly a political value by deepening the awe felt for the imperial government and by giving the Gaul, the Spaniard, the Syrian, and the Pannonian a sense of common loyalty to the state and its head; and as the sense of an imperial nationality grew stronger, the former national or tribal distinctions became politically harmless. How little these dis- tinctions meant after a while appears from the rarity of insurrections marked by any national quality, although there were districts, such as Isauria and Illyricum and northern Spain, in which the old languages and habits long survived. When Christianity came to prevail over the Roman world, the influence of religion entered on a new phase, in which it was stronger than ever before. The process went on more slowly than most moderns realise. A century and a half after the conversion of Constantine, Boethius, the finest mind and character of his time, was a heathen; and in the next generation Procopius, the greatest prose writer, was hardly a Christian, though he must have rendered external conformity. Neither were those last representatives of Neo-Platonism who departed to Persia when Justinian closed the schools of Athens. Before the process was completed, the identifica- tion of the empire with Christianity was well established. In the popular mind of that time, and to the barbarians without as well as to the citizens within the empire, every Roman was a Christian, and presently, over most of the world, every Christian, in a certain wide sense, was a Roman. The patriotism of the inhabitants of the empire had now a religious as well as a civic foundation. The coherence of its fabric was strengthened; the hostility of the barbarian tribes, who dwelt beside it on the north and after a time settled within it, was reduced, for they too, one after another, embraced the imperial faith. The emperor, no longer worshipped as a deity, was now revered as the temporal head of the church, who summoned and sometimes presided at General Councils, and lent his authority to the enforcement of orthodoxy and ecclesiastical discipline. There were losses as well as gains. Religious dissensions appeared, conflicts between different forms of Christian doctrine, and also disputes about ecclesiastical claims leading to schisms, both sets of conflicts, like that between Arians and Trinitarians, or that between the Donatists and their opponents in Africa, fought with a bitterness to which there had been nothing similar in heathen days. These conflicts no doubt weakened the empire, as most conspicuously in the case of the great strife over the doctrine of the nature of Christ.</page><page sequence="13">RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. Even if it be held that the conquest of Egypt and Syria by the Arabs in the seventh century would in any case have followed from the superiority of the invaders to the Roman armies, then exhausted by the terrible Persian war, the disaffection of the Monophysites in those countries to the orthodox monarchs at Constantinople doubt- less made their resistance weaker, and disposed the inhabitants more readily to accept Islam. The view taken by Gibbon and his school that Christianity is to be reckoned among the causes which led to the dissolution of the Roman power in the West, and its enfeeblement in the East, is no longer generally accepted. Taking the facts as a whole, Christianity would rather seem to have strengthened the empire and prolonged its existence. This was, of course, most plainly so in the East. It there became the champion of the national faith, first against the Persian fire-worshippers, then and thenceforward, till its extinction in the fatal year I453, of Christianity against Islam. It was, after the end of the Monothelite controversy, united in faith and in patriotism. We may see something more than a coincidence in the fact that the doctrinal controversies within the eastern church ended with the appearance of Islam. This unity of faith was what enabled the Eastern Roman empire to maintain its struggle of eight centuries against an encircling ring of terrible foes. Let me now turn to the three parallels to the Roman empire which the modern world presents, three vast dominions in which alien races have been or are ruled by a civilised nation. The first of these is the empire which Spain held for three cen- turies in Central and South America. It was won and held with amazing ease, so great was the military superiority of the conquerors to the aboriginal tribes upon whom they fell like lightning from the sky. It was never seriously attacked from without, though the coasts were often harassed by raids from English and Dutch seamen. It had little to fear from internal troubles, because the native population was ignorant, unintelligent, and so downtrodden as hardly even to think of resistance, while the white population, though in later years discontented, was bound to the mother country by many ties. There was therefore comparatively little need for relying on the power of religion to hold it together, just as there was comparatively little need for a large army to maintain order within and protect it from invasion. It is nevertheless worth while to consider what part religion played in securing the unity and the loyalty of dominions which reached from Cape Horn in the south to the straits of Juan de Fuca in the north, including territories now parcelled out among many independent republics and many states of the American Union. I3</page><page sequence="14">RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. Religion was a great force among the Spaniards, and most so in the days when, flushed with their final victory over the Moors of Granada, they set out to conquer the New World. The wish to propagate the faith was one of the two motives which stimulated their discoveries and conquests. Lust for gold was the other; and though, when the question arose between obeying the Gospel and yielding to the lust for gold, the latter passion prevailed, still the wish to convert the natives was a genuine motive, effective even with men so unscrupulous as Cortes and so brutal as Pizarro. The process of nominal conversion was quickly accomplished wherever Spanish arms prevailed. The native religions had little hold: they were easily overlaid by a profession of Catholicism, but survived below the surface, as they do to this day everywhere, in the form of vague superstitions and the practice of magical rites. The white man's religion appeared to them as a sort of magic, more powerful than their own, because belonging to a more powerful race. Where- ever the Spaniard went Catholicism prevailed, and it was never shaken in the least, nor divided in the least by heresies or schisms, down till the great revolt of the colonies which began in I8IO. There was an Inquisition at Lima and at Mexico, but it found com- paratively little to do among whites and did not deal with the natives. To this dominance of Catholicism there may be ascribed two effects, both sources of strength for Spanish rule. One was its power in cowing the native Indians. It destroyed such connexion as they had with their ancient native sovereigns, and, indeed, with their whole past. Few and faint in Peru, where they lasted longest, were the recollections of the days before the Conquest. No one dreamt of trying to restore the old regime of the Incas, absolute as its sway had been. The church was installed everywhere as an organised hierarchy from the village ' cura' up to the archbishop. She held lands and ruled the Indians who tilled them. There were innumerable establishments of the monastic orders, some of these also wealthy landowners, and they, too, dominated the natives and, for the matter of that, the poorer ' criollos' (native-born Spaniards) also.1 The church was so closely bound to the home govern- ment that it maintained the authority of that government no less effectively than garrisons would have done. Against any such risk of insurrections as may have existed,2 the hold of one great state religion upon all minds, Spanish and native, offered a security. The king of Spain could not, to be sure, make himself worshipped as a Roman emperor was worshipped. He was himself subject to the Pope in spiritual matters. He had his confessor. His viceroys in Mexico and Peru found it convenient to be on good 1 In Paraguay the Jesuits were for many years 2 There was really only one formidable rising, the actual rulers of the country, though de iure it that which broke out in Peru in I780. was part of the Spanish dominions. I4</page><page sequence="15">RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. terms with archbishops and provincials of great orders like the Jesuits. Still the monarchy had been so great a power in the ecclesiastical life of Spain that support of the church in the colonies was assured to the monarch, and it stood by him to the end. The other result of the universal acceptance of one faith and form of worship was the absolutely unbroken front which the Spaniards of America presented to foreigners who might either attack them or try to corrupt their loyalty. The only foreigners who came into question (besides the Portuguese, a feeble folk, touching Spanish territory on the coast where Brazil adjoined the viceroyalty of La Plata) were the Dutch and the English. Both were heretics, fit only for the stake. With them no pious Catholic would parley: against them every pious Catholic would fight to the death. If the English sea rovers in the days of Elizabeth could have tried to instil disaffection or provoke rebellion in Spanish America, they might have inflicted far more injury than by any of their semi-piratical expeditions. But this was impossible. Loyalty to the crown of Spain was strong, but detestation of the Protestant was stronger. This antagonism remained down through the eighteenth century. Though the revolt of the United States from Great Britain stirred men's thoughts in Mexico and South America, no disposition to draw close to the new republic followed; nor would any attempt from the side of the United States to induce the subjects of Spain to imitate their example have had much chance of success. It was the French revolution, and still more the Napoleonic policy in Spain, that set the ball rolling which ended by a general effort for the independence of the colonies. Thus it may be said that Catholicism by helping to secure both the submission of the native population, and the antagonism to Protestant assailants of the white population, contributed to the unity of sentiment in Spanish America, and in so far was a source of strength to Spanish rule. It is still a political force in some few of the more backward states, but in others has lost almost all its former power. These recent developments, however, lie outside our present enquiry. From the empire of Spain which, like that of Britain, was divided by wide seas from the ruling nation, I pass to consider a vast dominion entirely continuous by land with the race which has acquired and is now fast colonising it. The Russian empire is peculiar in this, that it includes four kinds of population in four different territories outside the motherland. One territory, covering seven-eighths of Siberia and the Amur region, is peopled by uncivilised and partly pagan tribes, scattered very thinly over a vast area, most of which is arctic in its physical character. Another, the Turkoman Khanates, is inhabited by semi-civilised Mussulmans. The third, Transcaucasia, I5</page><page sequence="16">i6 RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. has many other such Mussulmans, along with several civilised Christian races. The fourth consists of those parts of south-western Siberia which immigration is now beginning to fill with a large Russian population. This last element is therefore for all practical purposes (save that serfdom never existed in Siberia) identical with the people of European Russia. It holds the same orthodox eastern form of Christianity as do the latter. These are the conditions which determine the relations of religion to political life in the empire. The Russian people came late into the Christian fold, and still later into the circle of civilisation. Receiving their faith from the Eastern Roman empire, they received therewith the ecclesiastical traditions of that empire, among which was the power accorded to the sovereign in church affairs, and a sort of religious reverence for his person. Engaged from the end of the twelfth century until the end of the eighteenth in constant strife, first with heathen and afterwards with Muslim potentates, religious feeling became identified with national feeling, and reached a warlike quality not unlike that which the long wars with the Moors produced in Spain. A sort of crusading spirit permeated the people, enhancing the devotion to those who led in the war against the infidel. This devotion was divided between the Tsar and the Patriarch, until Peter the Great, resolved to let no other authority compete with his own, abolished the Patriarchate and transferred its functions to the Holy Synod, the highest ecclesiastical council,1 in whose hands these functions have ever since remained. Happy would have been such mediaeval emperors in the West as Frederick II or Lewis IV, could they have effected a similar stroke, for Peter's act made the lay sovereign supreme, and concentrated upon him the reverence due to the head of the ecclesiastical system. Whoever travels in Russia to-day is struck by the religious fervour which pervades it, embracing all classes of the people (except, of course, the few freethinkers who belong to the advanced wing of the socialist or anarchist section). Every house has at least one sacred picture of the Virgin and Child, and frequently a picture of the reigning emperor hangs beside it. Russia is now the only country in which one finds the churches crowded on week-days as on Sundays, even in the two capital cities, and crowded with men even more than with women. Nor is the tourist in Palestine less impressed by the swarms of Russian pilgrims who resort to its holy places at Easter, most of them peasants, intensely devout, infinitely credulous, ready to believe any marvel and to worship at any spot which the presence of the Virgin or a saint is said to have consecrated. This 1 The Tsar's power is largely exerted through an important lay official called the Procurator of the Holy Synod.</page><page sequence="17">RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. religious sentiment consolidates as well as inspires the nation, and gives to the Tsardom a prestige, one may almost say a sanctity, such as no western monarch since Charlemagne has enjoyed. So far I have spoken of the European Russians. Let us se what force religion has in holding together the extra-European parts of the empire. In south-western Siberia, the only part of that vast region be- ginning to be pretty thickly settled with Russians (though, of course, there are many in the few towns that lie to the east from Irkutsk all the way to Vladivostock and to near the mouth of the Amur river), the population is Russian-speaking and orthodox, not less ardently orthodox than their brethren in Europe. In the city of Tomsk, capital of one of the provinces, I happened two years ago to enter the cathedral church on the name-day of the Tsar. A religious service of extreme length was in progress. All the congregation were standing, for there are no seats in Russian churches. The singing, as always in Russia, was admirable; the worshippers, civil and military, devout; the occasion to them both national and sacred. The birthday of a Roman emperor might have been celebrated at Pergamos or Smyrna with more pomp, but certainly not with more warmth of feeling. I was in Asia, a thousand miles beyond the Ural mountains, but still in a Russia which seems one and undivided in its reverence for the Tsar. In the vast and dreary wilderness, which lies to the north and north-east of the parts of Siberia fit for agriculture and pasture, the only inhabitants are rude tribes, some of them semi-nomadic, some pagans, some Buddhists, some with a thin varnish of Christianity. All submitted readily to the Russian advance, which can hardly be called a conquest, for except in the Amur provinces there was scarcely any resistance, and even there very little. Here the orthodox faith will soon absorb all the races, except perhaps the Buddhists, and as immigrants continue to arrive, the habitable regions will be Russian for all religious as well as civil purposes. Thinly peopled as are the wide mountain strip of the Ural and the arid region beyond as far east as the Irtish river, this discontinuity of popula- tion does not prevent Siberia from being essentially a part of Russia. The people of the Turkoman Khanates, dwelling round Bokhara, Balkh, Samarkand and Tashkent, are Muslim, and fanatically Muslim. Among them Christianity makes little way, and cannot be used to strengthen the hold of government; yet the Russian power is so well established that Muslim revolts are not at present feared. The last of the divisions I have mentioned is Transcaucasia, with its old Christian races and churches, Georgians, Mingrelians, Armenians, and a smaller number of Mussulmans, Tatars (Turks) in the plains, various more or less civilised or semi-civilised tribes in I7</page><page sequence="18">I8 RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. the mountains. The Russian (i.e. Slav) and orthodox population is almost confined to the towns. Here the traveller feels himself among conditions unlike those either of European Russia or of western Siberia. The influences of race and church combine to keep Georgians, Armenians and the minor peoples apart from the Russians. Each race has a patriotism of its own. It is well disposed to its Russian rulers, whom it accepts as inevitable; it is ready, as the Armenians, the most vigorous of these races, especially have been, to serve loyally in the army and in civil administration, but it cannot have the same ardour of loyalty towards the monarch as the Russsian peasants have to the head of their state, their church, and their race. Herein appears the difference between ancient and modern religions. It was easy to superimpose the worship of the Roman emperor on the worship of Cybele or Mithras or Apollo. None of these worships was peculiar to any race, none had a hierarchy of priestly ministers with the functions of directing and counselling the lay people, and none excluded the worship of any number of other deities. But the Turkomans and other Tatars, though belonging to a stock not naturally religious, which has certainly never produced any religious thought or literature, are stubborn in their own form of monotheism, and yield an unwilling obedience to any one who does not acknowledge Mohammed. The Armenians and Georgians differ very little, if at all, from the doctrines of the Orthodox church; but each has its own traditions, its own succession of saints and teachers and heroes. Each has a church organisation to which it has clung through many centuries of resistance to Muslim attacks. That church organisation is the lifeblood of the race and makes the strongest appeal to its patriotism. There are those in Russia, mostly partisans of an extreme form of Panslavism, who, since they cannot make all the Tsar's subjects Slavs, would like at any rate to force them all into the fold of the Orthodox church, and thereby make them Russians at least in soul and sentiments if not in blood. Such a campaign against Catholicism in Poland and other parts of the western provinces, as well as against Protestantism in Finland and along the Baltic coast, would be a folly, not in accord with the generally tolerant sentiment of the Russian nation. Religion does enough for an empire when it sanctifies the allegiance of nine-tenths of the subjects. The British empire in India presents more points of similarity to the Roman empire than does any other extended dominion that has appeared since the fall of the latter. There are, of course, some salient differences, and two of especial moment. One of these is that Rome stood in the centre of her empire, while Britain is five thousand miles away from hers, with oceans between; the other that in the Roman case there was not, as in the British, a distinction</page><page sequence="19">RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. of colour between rulers and subjects. In one respect the similarity is particularly instructive. The religious beliefs and forms of worship of the various races of India resemble, and help us to understand, the abundance of ancient worships, their variations, their confusion, their localism, their eclecticism, their reciprocal acceptance of one another as all equally true. In Hinduism there are some deities recognised everywhere, and some who command far more worshippers than do others. Many are revered as family gods. Various reasons may determine which gods a man worships; and he may add fresh gods to the list at his pleasure. New cults spring up, old ones die out. Though the greatest divinities, Brahma, Vishna, and Shiva, are recognised as supreme, there is no sharp line between the divine, the semi-divine and the human. General John Nicholson was, in the days of the Mutiny of 1857, taken as an object of worship by persons whose imagination he had impressed, and a sect of Nicholsonians thus sprang up. Any kind of power is con- ceived by the populace as having something divine about it. It has been said that the Kols, a hill tribe of central India, were once found sacrificing a kid to the British Privy Council, before whom a suit was pending in which the tribe was interested; they were taking the natural means of propitiating a remote and mysterious force that could influence their fortunes. This multiplicity of cults and general tolerance, coupled with the division of the inhabitants into castes, smoothed the path of the English when they were conquering India, for among the Hindus religion has been but seldom a political power, whether before or after the advent of the Europeans. It did little either to lead native princes to combine against the Christian or Mussulman stranger, or to stimulate the resistance of their troops. Hinduism is not a fighting religion, although some of the races that hold it, like the Rajputs and the Mahrattas (and the Sikhs, if they may be classed as Hindus) are warriors of mettle; while the Mahratta chief Sivaji owed some part of his prestige to superstition. It was a further piece of good fortune for the advance of the British power that several of the strongest native states had Mussulman rulers, and in some cases a large Mussulman population, disliking Hindus more than they disliked Europeans. The Mogul empire may be said to have paved the way for the British, for it shattered the old fabric of Hindu kingdoms, while it was itself, in the days when the British conquests began, falling to pieces by internal decay as well as under the attacks of many native foes. Had the great Akbar been followed by successors with gifts like his, Islam and the Mogul power might have barred the way to any European advance in India. In respect, therefore, of the absence of religious hostility, the position of the English was like that of the Romans. Attachment to local deities no more checked their progress in Bengal or Madras I9</page><page sequence="20">20 RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. than it had checked the Romans in Greece or Asia, and this, although the Romans were willing to sacrifice at any Greek or Asiatic shrine, while the English could worship at none. Here the likeness ends. The rest is contrast. The Romans were able to turn the native worships and religious sentiment in general to their own account. A Roman general, being either a conventional polytheist or an agnostic, had no objection to sacrificing to the Ephesian Artemis, just as the Persian satrap Tissaphernes, servant of a sun-and-fire- worshipping king, had done five centuries earlier.1 No sense of religious opposition prevented any Roman from getting into touch with any provincial subject; indeed, his willingness to join in honouring the local deity made it easy for him to associate himself with the city life and the family life of the provincials among whom his lot was cast. The absence of religious antagonisms was almost as effective a factor in the assimilation of all subjects and the creation of an imperial nationality as was the absence of colour distinctions. The Englishman on the other hand was a monotheist. However little he might be of a Christian in his daily life-and some of the earlier Anglo-Indians reflected scant credit on the creed they professed-Hindu worship was too alien to his thoughts and tastes for him to make the least approach to it. He would have gained nothing from the natives by doing so, and he would have lost his standing among Europeans. Neither was there any thought of an approach towards Islam. It was reserved for Bonaparte in Egypt -who to be sure was not a Christian even in name-to pose as a sort of Muslim, and for the German emperor William II, on his visit to Sultan Abdul Hamid and to Palestine, to take a few faltering steps along the same path. The English, unlike the Spaniards in America, did not try to convert the natives of India, which would indeed have been a task beyond their powers. They abstained from any offence either to Hinduism or to Islam, and observed a strict neutrality as between the two systems. They seldom gave any encouragement to Christian missionary efforts, and even for a long time refrained from prohibiting the more cruel or anti-social native religious observances. Thuggism had, of course, to be extirpated, but Sati (the self-immolation of widows) was tolerated till the middle of the nineteenth century as child-marriages are still. By prudence in these and other matters they sought to avoid any interference with Indian customs which could let loose passions dangerous to the public peace; but they could not, like the Romans, turn religious emotion into channels helpful to their own rule. Russia presents in some respects a better parallel to the Roman empire than does the British dominion in India, for in the Russian 1 Thuc. v1l, I09.</page><page sequence="21">RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. as in the Roman empire the aristocratic sovereign stands at the apex alike of political and religious (or ecclesiastical) authority, and commands the reverential awe of his subjects in both capacities. On the other hand the phenomena of Indian religion are sufficiently like those of the Graeco-Roman world to enable us to see to what account religious sentiment can be turned by an absolute monarch, free to press it into his service, when he is willing to place himself on the level of popular polytheism. What would the English have done had they been polytheists ? The local representatives, first of the Company and afterwards of the Crown, would have attended at the great Hindu festivals of Shiva and Kali. For the Muslims they would have built another, and vaster, if not more beautiful, Jama Masjid at Delhi. Shrines would have been set up in honour of eminent governors and viceroys whose memory the natives delighted to honour. Great temples might have risen to canonised Hanoverian }kings. There would have been a Divus Georgius and a Divus Willelmus, perhaps even a Divus Georgius Quartus, worshipped along with a Dea Britannia, or possibly, seeing how largely the office of the Company in Leaden- hall Street was staffed from the northern part of our island, a Dea Caledonia. Games, at least of the athletic sort, are not greatly to the taste of India, but there would have been festivals in honour of these deities, at which native princes would have appeared in all their pomp, with reviews of troops in the daytime and with nautches in the evening. An order of 'Victoriales' would have arisen to commemorate the assumption by the Crown in 1858 of the direct sovereignty of India, and would have burnt incense at Victorian altars all over the country on the birthday of their divine mistress, with no disparagement to any native deities. In such worship Mohammedans could hardly have joined, but they might have gone so far as to include the Padishah in their public prayers. These things could not be. The only religious affinities possible for the English in India are with native Christians. Though these converts do form, or may come to form, a sort of link between the rulers and the ruled, and though their numbers show some increase, they are still too few to be a real factor in strengthening the hold of England. Religion has been, as in the days of the Mutiny of I857, an element of danger in the Indian situation. It might possibly be again, and it would be so now to a larger extent than it is but for the division of the population between the two great rival systems. Nevertheless the British Raj, foreign as it remains, has a sort of quasi-religious sanctity. It is Power, and Power will always be worshipped. Its power is happily associated with Justice and with Peace, as was the Roman power in the days of the best emperors. 21</page><page sequence="22">22 RELIGION AS A FACTOR IN THE HISTORY OF EMPIRES. If to this title to respect which it has won, and has deserved to win, it can add the affection which may arise out of sympathy, and if there can come a fuller recognition of the intellectual and moral gains which a better understanding between East and West can bring to both, its permanence will be assured for a period stretching as far into the future as our eyes can reach.</page><page sequence="23">J.R.S. vol. v (I9t5).
