I tried to answer the questions of what art is, how it can be defined and when it originated, and how it developed. Therefore, special attention is paid to non-utilitarian demonstrations of human creativity during the Middle Paleolithic. There are several archaeologic finds suggesting that members of the Australopithecus were actually able to recognize aesthetic features in the structure of rocks (manuport) and members of the Homo heidelbergensis were able to create artefacts which had an aesthetic dimension. As these finds are rather sporadic, we can only speculate about the existence of proto-art for this period. Nevertheless, we see evidence of the origins of creative artistic thinking in Neanderthals who made artefacts which had, in addition to a utilitarian function, a decorative function. Yet the development of symbolic thinking dates to a later period: it occurred during the evolution of anatomically modern humans who made artefacts with geometric patterns as they moved across Africa. The real expansion of human creativity occurred in the Upper Paleolithic in Europe, when migrating members of Homo sapiens began to create a visualised world of symbolic art.

We historical, geographical and cultural contexts. The term now call these things art (Kroeber 1952, Durham 1991). "art" thus remains open, for its extent and content can always be expanded or narrowed (Rosengren 2012). The statement made by Ludwig Wittgenstein is fitting ART AND PROTO-ART in this context: "But then how does an explanation help me to understand, if, after all, it is not the final one? In Art as a unique symbolic system can arise from that case the explanation is never completed; so I still don't various sources.

The world of ideas of age, and by constantly emerging and transforming new prehistoric anatomically modern humans was probably art forms and movements. It is clear that art has, in very abundant. It was perhaps just as rich in addition to its essential incomprehensibilities, is also interpretations as the attempt of contemporary expansive, adventurous and transformative.

The need and interest is attests to the hypothetical ability of Australopithecus largely missing in the Middle or Lower Paleolithic hominids to distinguish aesthetically impressive period than the ability to depict specific objects. Yet we attributes within the structure of rocks.

The stone comes from the layer in which the skeletal remains of an Australopithecus africanus were found. One hypothesis THE BIRTH OF CULTURE holds that this hominid took the pebble from a different OF AUSTRALOPITHECUS GENUS place and brought it into the cave. We now are unsure whether the individual who found the stone was The birth of culture as a supra-biological adaptation attracted to its striking colors or the fact that its shape tool that humans used over the course of and structure resembled that of a human face anthropogenesis was closely preceded by the evolution (Lorblanchet 1999, Kuckenburg 2001).

Confocal microscopes have revealed humans. Natural influences also might have left traces that the cut marks are of a non-utilitarian nature and on the surface of the bone medium which might be feature homogenous configuration. This enables us to mistaken as deliberate human work. But not even the confirmation of anthropogenic activity necessarily serves as proof that a given cultural modification of a natural object reflects the artistic aspiration of its creator. The border between non-utilitarian and utilitarian manifestation is blurred since and incision by stripping meat from bones or cutting and chipping materials on a bone medium cannot be clearly determined (Steguweit 2009). NEANDERTHAL ART The population of Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) expanded through present-day Europe and adjacent regions of western Asia 220,000 to 30,000 BP. Over the course of evolution, the Neanderthals morphologically adapted to the harsh conditions of the most recent ice age, which led to the formation of the classical Neanderthals (80,000– 35,000 BP), via Holstein-Hoxnian forms such as Bilzingsleben and Sima, and Saalian ones such as Biache and Ehringdorf (Condemi, Weniger 2011). Populations of anatomically modern humans that emerged independently of Neanderthals during the period of 200,000–140,000 BP in Sub-Saharan Africa began migrating to Europe about 35,000 BP. Neanderthals exhausted their adaptive potential by 28,000 BP and relinquished their position in the ecosystem to anatomically modern humans who were evolutionarily more successful.    Grooves on three bone fragments dating between 135,000 and 80,000 BP were found at the German site of Oldisleben I inhabited by Neanderthals. This FIGURE 1.
