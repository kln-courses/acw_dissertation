We lost Rolfe Humphries in April at the age of seventy-four, but not before he had completed perhaps the greatest of his contributions to contemporary civility.1 His Aeneid had for a long time been the best there is for the general reader but now he has surpassed that achievement with his translation of Lucretius' De Rerum Natura. That poem, much neglected for lack of a sufficiently readable English version, need be neglected no longer. Humphries' translation is not merely readable but inspired, and it should make ap? parent to everyone that Lucretius has as much to say to us as any poet in the tradition. But there has always been a prejudice against Lucretius: witness the following entry in St. Jerome's Chronicle for the year 94 B. C.: Titus Lucretius the poet born. Driven mad by drinking an aphro? disiac, between bouts of insanity he wrote several rolls of verse, which Cicero later edited. He died by his own hand at the age of 44. This could be more or less true, but it could also be merely inferred from Lucretius' poem, with one slight piece of assistance from Cicero's letters. Lucretius proclaims Venus as the sole ruler of the world and our lives, and a Stoic or Christian might well believe, or pretend to believe, that a man who could say that must be under the influence of an aphrodisiac. To discover the horrible consequences of such views and such habits, it was only necessary to look at Lucretius' luscious picture of the futility of physical passion at the end of the fourth book. To the prudish and the innocent that passage could seem, or be made to seem, the words of a man himself driven mad by sex. How con? venient for the champions of religion, whose influence Lucretius is avowedly out to destroy! They could, and evidently did, claim that the poem was the product of an insane mind. There was not even any difficulty explaining how a madman could get himself published, for the letter of Cicero's which we mentioned shows that he had Lucretius' manuscript in his hands and much admired it. Writing to his brother 1 LUCRETIUS: THE WAY THINGS ARE. The De Rerum Natura of Titus Lu? cretius Carus, translated by Rolfe Humphries. Introduction by Burton Feldman. Notes by George K. Strodach. Indiana University Press. $6.50.</page><page sequence="2">700 THE HUDSON REVIEW Quintus he says, "Lucretius' poems are all that you say they are: full of the fire of genius, yet with great art. But more when you come." This was evidently enough for critics to conclude that Cicero edited the poem and had it copied, Lucretius himself being incompetent if not already dead. Is not the poem even as we have it now manifestly dis? organized in spots and unfinished? This in turn leaves us with just the impression which Jerome's notice does, quoted above: doubtless "Lu? cretius the poet," his eye in a fine frenzy rolling, was capable of some beautiful lines, but we need not bother about his doctrine. Such co? herence as it has is likely due to Cicero's kind editorship. Even Lu? cretius' alleged suicide may have come from this sort of speculation. What advice would Lucretius himself give to a sex-crazed madman? The answer is obvious: kill yourself. One of the main points of the poem, as we shall see, is that death is not to be feared but regarded rather as a refuge. So we can only too easily deduce Lucretius' suicide from his poem and all in all it does look as though Jerome's biography is just malici? ous or romantic gossip. On the other hand, as we have said, all this scandal may be true: the madness, the suicide, even the aphrodisiac, but the poetry does not prove it. It does not even prove a neurotic preoccupation with sex and death such as some modern critics have seen in the poem. There are good as well as bad reasons for making Venus the supreme deity, while the tirade against passionate love is to be explained as at once a confirmation of the Epicurean-Lucretian theory of reality and a demonstration of the benefits of knowing the truth about the way things are. This, I think, accounts for its vehem? ence, rather than any peculiar twist in Lucretius' mind. It fits his poem; it does not distort it. Venus first. Lucretius found in the philosophy of Epicurus what he thought was the secret of human happiness. His poem is at once the celebration of this discovery and an invitation to his fellow Romans to share in its benefits. In brief, the discovery was this: everything in the universe, everything that exists and everything that happens, is the result of the fortuitous combinations and dissolutions of an infinite quantity of atoms in infinite space. No over-all purpose, no ordering or control is involved. The gods, if they exist at all, being perfectly happy would not disturb themselves to interfere even if they could. To realize that this is the way things are should make us happy. First, nobody up there is watching us. What we do is our own affair, and we need not worry about supernatural approval or disapproval. The consequences of our actions will be natural and mostly forseeable, and we are free to pursue in our own way those easily obtainable goods on which happiness depends: the moderate satisfaction of bodily wants and a mind free to take delight in the life we live. In the course of nature misfortunes do occur, earthquakes, disease, and the like; but these too we can accept with a quieter mind, realizing that they are</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 701 just random events, not evidences of our own nastiness and helpless? ness. There is no mighty sentient power before which we must quail, as the religious imagine so fondly and so fatally for their peace of mind. This is the first of the two great freedoms which Lucretius says Epicurus bestows upon us. The second is that we need not fear death at all. The reason is that our consciousness is part of the organization of our body. It cannot exist apart from it, is born with it, and dies with it. Therefore we will never have to experience that thing we so dread, our own death. We are relieved of Hamlet's fear, "to sleep, perchance to dream"; of this dreaming there is no possibility at all. Thus Epicurus and Lucretius seek to remove from our minds a great weight of deluded responsibility and fear. The universe doesn't care a hoot what we do, and whatever we do, our lives will end in a peace? ful sleep. Indeed we can end them ourselves whenever the pain out? weighs the pleasure. Attractive as this picture is in some ways, the comfort Lucretius draws from it would seem excessive if it were not for the pervading presence in the poem of Venus, all inadmissable as she is according to Epicurean theory. If we look at the philosophy analytically, ignoring those famous opening lines, "Aeneadum genetrix, hominum divom- que voluptas,/alma Venus,..." we might as well despair as hope. Birth and death are equal and opposite. No combination of atoms lasts for long, not even our world with its sun and stars. Everything dies. But Lucretius accentuates the positive. After all, the atoms are eternal, and will recombine; so the conservation of matter becomes a subject for lyric: Finally, when the fathering air has poured His rainfall into mother earth, the drops Seem to have gone, but look!-bright harvests rise, Boughs on the trees bring greenery and growth And are weighed down by fruit, by which, in turn, Our race is fed, and so are animals, And we see happy cities, flowering With children, and we hear the music rise As new birds sing all through the leafy woods. Fat cows lie down to rest their weary sides In welcome pastures, and the milk drops white Out of distended udders; and the calves Romp over the tender grass, or wobble, drunk On that pure vintage, more than strong enough For any such experience as theirs. To sum it up: no visible object dies; Nature from one thing brings another forth, And out of death new life is born. Birth is what Lucretius looks at, and what Venus means. "Genetrix" is the second word of the poem, "Creatress" the first of Humphries'</page><page sequence="4">702 THE HUDSON REVIEW translation. We may object, and many have objected, that it does not remove the fear of annihilation from us merely to point out that we won't feel a thing; but actually we are offered a second and greater consolation. "What's so bad about your annihilation," Lucretius says, "so long as something else is created? However short your time may be, you will have had your seat at life's feast, and in comparison to eternity you will have done as well as anyone. Why not be thankful and depart?"?and he does make it seem that we can take delight in the mere fact that things arc born and not worry overmuch that they cease to be. More than this, Venus is not only genetrix; she is also voluptas. Atoms combine and dissolve again, and that is our world, but is it not a piece of good fortune that they combine so joyously? The atoms are infinitely numerous, and they move in infinite space and time, but since they have only a limited number of shapes, only a limited num? ber of combinations is possible. This is why things occur in certain definite ways and not in others. The replenishment of animal bodies for example, and animal reproduction, though it might have been otherwise, have turned out to take place under the impulse of "our guide to life,/The radiance of pleasure." Accordingly, Lucretius seems right to begin his poem as he does, by invoking the great goddess of Love and Pleasure: Since you alone control the way things are,2 Since without you no thing has ever come Into the radiant boundaries of light, Since without you nothing is ever glad, And nothing ever lovable ... It just so happens that things are glad, and are lovable, and that to come into the light is good. Creation holds the field. Mars the de? stroyer figures only in that he ". . . more than once has come,/Gentled by love's eternal wound" into Venus' embrace. War ends in peace, amity, and concord. We can see that in this poem the reverse, peace gives way to war, is not equally true. Existence comes from concord; disruption and dissolution are merely concord's negative aspects. The shapes of the atoms are such that Venus, and Venus alone, rules the world. Who then can be unhappy? Lucretius, contemporary of Caesar and Cicero, lived in a terrible time. It is no mere literary device when he asks Venus for peace for the Romans so that he can write "with a calm mind" and they can listen. His prayer was not answered and his poem was not finished, but he did enough to let us see how he hoped by means of it to miti? gate the struggle for wealth, power, and military preeminence with which his times were cursed. If people only knew the way things are, 2 Here I follow the Latin in putting a period after the last line on page 19 and a comma instead of a period at the end of the first line quoted, the first line on page 20.</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 703 he says over and over, they would see how little life requires for hap piness; neither wealth nor military might ever freed anyone from fear of the gods, feelings of guilt, or the fear of death; yet it is these fears and feelings which more than anything else cause the struggle for wealth and power. By ridding them of their "terrors and darknesses of mind" Lucretius sought to turn his fellow citizens from preying on each other to the noble vision of reality and the quiet life implicit in the philosophy of Epicurus. Who can say that his idea was not a good one? So it does not seem insane of Lucretius to celebrate Venus, but what can we say about the seeming attack on her in the fourth book, in which he accuses her of consuming her lovers in futility? The fourth book, as it turns out, is not so much about sex, though it ends with sex, as it is about the filmy images, themselves made of atoms, which all objects are constantly throwing off and which become both the source of our perceptions and the content of our consciousness. In the case of falling in love, images of the beloved function like Cupid's arrows, but with this advantage for explaining the phenomenon: they are real and material and can physically affect the lover. Even dreams, Lucretius reminds us, can bring a man to orgasm. Thus this atomic theory lets us understand for the first time how the sight of a pretty face causes such a commotion in the human male, as his seed presses towards ". . . the source of the mind's wound./All things tend wound- ward: does not blood spurt out/In the direction of the blow?" And we can explain not only the attraction of passion, but its futility, as we have already seen. The images can excite, but being incomparably less substantial in their make-up than food and drink, they cannot satisfy. To be sure, this part of Lucretius' lesson may not make us very happy, but at least we understand, and his theory seems doubly confirmed. Besides, if he is right, there is a remedy. If we are in love, it is not through divine malevolence, Venus' or any other god's, but from physical causes which we can get at. The thing to do is to reduce the seminal pressure and break up the flow of images from that one fatal form by the interposition of others. If loving other girls doesn't work, it may help to entertain images of the one girl when she is at her least attractive, engaged in body-care, say. Disillusion yourself, take her down off her pedestal. Then, if she is a good sort and doesn't resent it, forgive her her defects. You are out of danger. So the atomic theory tends to cure the ills of passion as it does the other fevers and follies of men, by understanding, by debunking, by showing that there is nothing mysterious involved. Lucretius paints his lovers in such desperate straits because of his urgency about the efficacy of his theory and not because he suffered from a fatal passion. A good many of his nights after all were spent in reading Greek and writing Latin. Here too, Lucretius is able to celebrate Venus Creatress. Lovers can? not satisfy themselves with images, but they can by creating children.</page><page sequence="6">704 THE HUDSON REVIEW Thus the depiction of futile passion proceeds to consideration of the female orgasm and its role in conception and inheritance?another apparent confirmation of Lucretius' theories. With this transition he is able to end the book with a discussion of the best means of child- getting from an atomic point of view, leaving us in no doubt about what Venus is really for. Once more the atomic "nature of things" has shown us what is really important, in sex as in the other depart? ments of life. Just as Lucretius is not particularly neurotic on the subject of love, neither is he about death. Those twenty-six enthusiastic proofs of the mortality of the soul in the third book are not a case of protesting too much, but rather designed to assure us of the comforts of dissolution, secure in the knowledge that the universe will carry on under the guidance of Venus?not the anthropomorphic goddess of the relig? ionists but the great creative principle which alone controls the way things are, without which nothing has ever come into the radiant boundaries of light, without which nothing is ever glad, and nothing ever lovable. In fact, what has been taken for neurosis is really poetry, and with Humphries in hand I think we can dispel at one and the same time both the neurosis theory and the erroneous though wide? spread impression that Lucretius' poem is not a poem, but obsolete science versified. True enough, an explanation of the working of the universe, insofar as it is just an explanation, is prose whether phrased in meter or not; but to celebrate the way things are, or to celebrate them while explaining them, is poetry. This is what Lucretius is doing, and Humphries is able to convey the effect admirably. Here is one example, of a point which otherwise expressed might have been mere scientific argument: Besides, if all the space Of all the universe were fixed, enclosed By definite bounds, by this time all the mass, The weight, of matter would have run together From all sides to the bottom, tending downward From the sheer force of weight, so there could be No room for action under heaven's roof, No heaven, for that matter, and no sun, Since all material would be heaped so high From its long subsidence through endless time. But as it is, no rest is ever given To the atoms' rainfall; there's no pit, far down, To be their pool, their ultimate resting-place. All things keep on, in everlasting motion, Out of the infinite come the particles Speeding above, below, in endless dance. By nature space is deep and space is boundless, So that bright shafts of lightning could not cross it,</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS 705 Given eternal time, nor could they lessen The area before their onward course. There is too much space, all here and there, around them, No limit to that infinite domain. This is enough to show that what we have on our hands is a poem brilliantly translated, even before we reflect that much else is cele? brated besides the dance of the atoms. That "much else," we have been trying to suggest, is nothing less than the liberation of the human spirit through reason and knowledge. Some people will object to Humphries' colloquialisms here in Lu? cretius as they did to those in his translation of the Aeneid, but I am emphatically in favor of them. He knows what he is translating: in his foreword he writes of "the tone?that wonderful high sustained per? emptory aristocratic address to Memmius and to ourselves." Indeed he says that it is that value which he has most tried to preserve. It is also clear that he wants his translation to sound alive, the way real poems sound. In other words he wants to use his own personal "high sus? tained peremptory aristocratic" language, and that includes colloqui? alisms, even slang. Reading this Lucretius, one hears Rolfe Humphries explaining the way things are in a language and a tone of voice that we can enjoy, love, and honor, and short of the Latin I can't think of a better way to do it.</page></plain_text>
