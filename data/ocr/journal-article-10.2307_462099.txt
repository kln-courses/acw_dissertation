<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUSAN D. COHEN An Onomastic Double Bind: Colette's Gigi and the Politics of Naming D EPRIVED OF BOTH participation in dominant discourse and recognition of an "other," female language, denied the proprietorship of proper names and the commu- nity of common ones, women have been left with the uninspiring alternative of being either mis- named or simply occulted.' It has become evi- dent that in a socioeconomic system where discourse goes hand in hand with power, to be named is to undergo reification, but not to be named signifies exclusion from the system and ef- fective disappearance. Such is the dilemma that informs Colette's Gigi. Critics have approached this text as one of Colette's numerous tales of transition from adolescence to adult womanhood, written in a lighthearted, comic-ironic vein. While these aspects certainly apply, it has not been sufficiently stressed that the transition in question is highly problematized in Gigi. The problem of a "femini- zation" that does not at all "go without saying" forms the crux of the novelette. At the very begin- ning of the text, two juxtaposed passages act as an exposition and present both sides of the ques- tion in clearly onomastic terms, thus disclosing the relation of women to discourse and of dis- course to women. In the opening scene Gigi, a girl of sixteen, is having her hair arranged by her grandmother, Mme Alvarez, a lady with "a heavy Spanish face" (184).2 Mme Alvarez has become "Spanish" not by legally acquiring that nationality but by an- other, equally efficacious social process: through language. She has appropriated a name and, con- sequently, a body. "By bearing the Spanish name of a dead lover, Mme Alvarez had acquired an ex- quisite, buttery pallor, plumpness, hair lustrous with brillantine. She used powder that was too white; the weight of her cheeks pulled her lower eyelids down a bit, with the result that she ended up calling herself Inez" (185). In this way, she has ensured her social insertion. That the artifice works, that the name has "taken" beyond a cer- tain expected feminine complicity, is attested by the fact that Gaston, the only direct representative of the dominant society and the sole male in the text, calls her quite naturally by the nickname "Mamita."3 The name also takes root on an- other, parodic plane, that of the author-narrator, who uses only the adopted appellative to refer to Mme Alvarez and frequently alludes to her "Spanish features." Yet the caricatural tone in Gigi, though pronounced, functions entirely extradiegetically-that is, outside the plot, as it were-on a level where proper names have the specifically literary "double character of con- straint and play" (Nicole 240).4 The only ones who laugh are the reader and the narrator, who is responsible for the onomastic invention as well as for its satire. The comic aspect operates restric- tively, on the superficial layer of exaggeration it- self, without affecting what is thereby exposed: the interiorization of bourgeois values imposed on women. Thus the "three functions of proper names: identifying, classifying, signifying" (Nicole 235) work differently according to the literary per- spective in which they are scrutinized. In the die- gesis the onomastic signifier has a seriousness of such power that it determines both the social sig- nified and the physical referent. Rather than elect the exclusion attendant on anonymity, Gigi's grandmother has chosen in- tegration, using the sole means available to her: the patronymic, a name that, for women, is always borrowed and is here doubly false and falsifying. She undergoes assimilation in the strongest senses of the term assimilate: "to take in and appropriate as nourishment; absorb into the system . . . to absorb into the cultural tradition of a population or group" (Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 9th ed.). Mme Alvarez carries off her personal con- formity only at the price of the physical and moral alienation of a woman who, in order to sur- vive, applies a mask that she will not be allowed to remove. Social interdiction and its correlate, personal incapacity, prevent her from doing so. 793</page><page sequence="2">Colette's Gigi and the Politics of Naming On the one hand, society would punish such an infraction with expulsion, or opprobrium at the very least. On the other hand, the very efficacity of her pseudonym, the organic repercussions of which extend, as has been shown, to the creation of a pseudobody, obliterates an identity that she meant merely to conceal but has irretrievably lost. The mask of "femininity" prescribed by society suppresses Mme Alvarez as much as, if not more than, outright exclusion from the reigning system would have suppressed her. Of necessity, this alienation manifests itself verbally as well. Enter- ing into a phallogocentric sociolinguistic system, women have access only to a preexisting language that, as long as it remains unchallenged, will con- tinue to articulate the world solely according to masculine values and criteria. Indeed, having set the machinery in motion by opting for the patro- nymic, Mme Alvarez, victim of an insidious logic, becomes a spokesman (sic) for the code she must perforce use. Divested of her physical and linguis- tic existence, she is no longer herself and has nothing left to say. She has, so to speak, created a vacuum, one that she fills by mimicking a dis- course that institutionalizes and compounds her alienation. Grave in itself, this situation becomes doubly dramatic since it constitutes the text's plot. Mme Alvarez is the person responsible for raising Gigi. Along with her sister, Alicia, a more successful and consequently more cynical courtesan who has, nevertheless, also interiorized the laws that assimilate her, Mme Alvarez supervises Gigi's "education." Inevitably, that process is limited to the transmission of the laws of the sociolect. The two sisters' speech to Gigi consists entirely of maxims, and all their reactions take the form of conditioned reflexes expressed in ready-made phrases dictated by society. The imperatives "you must" and "you mustn't" predominate in their pronouncements and cover all aspects of a well- groomed girl's life, from the correct way to eat a lobster, to acceptable and unacceptable jewelry, from the people it is admissible to see to behavior in any amorous situation, from verbal to cor- poreal taboos. Here as well, the same parodic techniques of multiplication and exaggeration used for the name Alvarez achieve highly comic effects that simultaneously expose the code's sup- pression of the feminine. Thus, for example, Alicia interrogates Gigi while inspecting her: "What do you have there? A little pimple? You must not have a little pimple near your nose. And there? You squeezed a blackhead. You must nei- ther have nor squeeze blackheads." (211).5 Once again, however, far from finding the code a source of amusement, the women see it as their means of self-preservation. While they may not completely believe in the truth of the precepts, they do believe firmly in their necessity. Even in her most cynical moments, Alicia insists on their utility. For example, she advises Gigi to adhere to a few superstitions and explains how they may be turned to account: "They're called weaknesses. A nice lot of weaknesses and fear of spiders is our indispensable equipment [ba- gage] with men." "Why, aunt?" . "Because nine out of ten men are superstitious, nine- teen out of twenty believe in the evil eye, and eighty- eight out of one hundred are afraid of spiders. They forgive us many things, but not freedom from what frightens them." (210-11) Articulated down to the smallest details, the code rigidly circumscribes the behavior of a specific segment of society, that of demimon- daines. Barred from all respected and decently paid work, faced with the prospect of a misera- ble life as salesgirls or as wives of petty white- collar workers, these women have made the emi- nently financial choice of becoming courtesans. For that condition offers a chance, however slim, of protection from poverty and from the legal slavery of marriage.6 To be sure, the cost is high: such a life involves constant struggle, the reifica- tion of one's body, and social scorn. That the pos- sibilities for women of that period (Colette situates the story in 1899) and of the two sisters' social position are limited to these dim prospects is confirmed several times in the text. Gigi's mother, Andree, for example, voices the appre- hension that her daughter, a refractory pupil, might end up "a model or a salesgirl" (198), that, in other words, she might choose badly and end up like herself, a second-rate singer, worn-out and ill-paid for work considered contemptible. Gaston voices the other threat. Piqued by Mme Alvarez's refusal to permit him to take Gigi to a public res- taurant, he exclaims, "I wonder, by the way, for whom you are keeping her? For some employee earning next to nothing, who will marry her and get her pregnant four times in three years?" (215). 794</page><page sequence="3">Susan D. Cohen Near the end of the novelette, an angry Alicia ex- plicitly reiterates the alternatives. To Gigi, who has just refused to become mistress of the wealthy Gaston, she expostulates, "Idiot! . . . You de- serve to have a hat shop! Why don't you go marry a copy clerk!" (227). Such textual emphasis, rein- forced in the diegesis by Gigi's long resistance, re- veals a double alienation, inherent in the options proposed and also in the very belief that no others are conceivable. The denunciation of the choices' crippling effect on women is all the more virulent coming from an author who experienced this op- pression (as a young wife, Colette was locked in her room four hours every day by her husband, who forced her to write books he himself would sign and who gave her very little money; once divorced, she took up the harsh career of a music- hall mime) but who resolved it by becoming a self- sufficient writer. Although the two sisters have no opportunity to assert themselves in like fashion, they clearly grasp the pecuniary implications of the alternatives. They therefore undertake to teach Gigi the rules of a life, or occupation, that, far from contravening or threatening bourgeois soci- ety, is both anticipated and precoded by it. For bourgeois society institutes the conditions that create its subclasses and dictates their subcodes. The text openly stresses the correlation between prostitution and modern patriarchal society, which makes of prostitutes an oppressed sub- class.7 Thus, in approval of Gaston's adherence to prescribed behavior, Mme Alvarez declares, " . . .he has always stuck to high-class demi- mondaines, like a bachelor of his standing should. ... A liaison with an elegant demimon- daine is the only suitable way for him to pass the time before contracting a rich marriage" (197). For their part demimondaines must obey specific rules, whose rigidity is eloquently described by the following passage from La fin de Cheri, a novel set in a similar milieu: " .. his childhood as a bastard, his long, dependent adolescence, had taught him that in a milieu considered unre- strainedly wild, there reigns a code almost as nar- row as a bourgeois prejudice. There Cheri had learned that love is concerned with money, betrayals, crimes, and with cowardly agreements" (134-35). Governed by the bourgeois code that implicitly provides a slot for the demimonde, these women can only perpetuate society's values, often mim- icking them hyperbolically. Mme Alvarez, for ex- ample, embraces the bourgeois value of cleanli- ness to the point of parody-which is, once again, confined to the extradiegetic level of the reader. Although scarcely able to afford the expense, she conducts her household like a middle-class French housewife: The sheets remained on the beds only ten days at a time, and the housekeeper-washer-ironer said for all to hear that at Mme Alvarez's neither the ladies' under- clothing nor their table linen was kept long enough to fade. At the unexpected cry of "Gigi, show me your feet!" Gilberte had to remove her shoes and stockings and give her white feet and well-groomed toenails up for inspection. (201) The text explains Mme Alvarez's preoccupation in specifically social terms: " . . . she maintained the honorable habits of women without honor and taught them to her daughter and to her daughter's daughter" (201). Such behavior aggra- vates her alienation, since the very act of imitat- ing something from which women are rigorously excluded suppresses them (or any oppressed group) by repressing their alterity.8 Moreover, in- teriorizing dominant values and communicating them to young girls simultaneously sabotages their chances of self-realization and perverts interper- sonal relations among women. The brief appear- ance of Andree illustrates the impasse in which women find themselves when they attempt to as- sert themselves outside imposed structures. While her relation to her mother is affectionate, it is mediated by Mme Alvarez's disdain for the thea- ter. The mother's scorn emanates, of course, less from her than from a society that debases women's work both by underpayment and by denigration, and sometimes, as for Andree, even by condemnation.9 In an extradiegetic interven- tion, Colette, herself a former actress, calls atten- tion to the contradiction inherent in that sort of attitude. The narrator explains that Mme Alvarez makes disparaging remarks to her daughter, such as "after all, Gaston Lachaille has not sunk so low as to pursue music-hall performers" (203), "[b]e- cause she held the performer's art in scorn, de- spite the harshness of Andree's job" (203). It follows that, however they try to prepare Gigi to defend herself against men, Mme Alvarez and Alicia can only teach her to compromise, as they compromised by accepting a contract that com- mits a priori reification of women. In the scene 795</page><page sequence="4">Colette's Gigi and the Politics of Naming where Mme Alvarez is combing Gigi's hair, which actually precedes the passage about Mme Alva- rez's name, we see the intrinsic deformation and occultation in young girls' education of the period. Uncomfortably seated and ill at ease in a short skirt, Gigi is scolded by this mouthpiece of the dominant code: "I've already told you that when you are sitting on a low chair you must keep your knees together and bend them to the right or left, in order to avoid in- decency." "But, grandmother, I'm wearing panties and an un- derskirt." "Underpants are one thing, and decency is another," said Mme Alvarez. "It's all in one's bearing." . . . "Then make my skirts a little longer, so I'm not al- ways twisted like the letter Z, whenever I sit down. You see, grandmother, I have to think about my you-know- what [mon ce-que-je-pense] all the time, because my skirts are too short." "Silence! Aren't you ashamed to call that your you- know-what?" "I'd like nothing more than to give it another name. . . . Mme Alvarez turned off the gas heater, looked at her heavy Spanish face in the mantlepiece mirror, and decided, "There is no other name." From under the row of ash-blond curls darted an incredulous look. (184; emphasis added) Clearly it is a question not of Gigi's developing into an autonomous, female-gendered adult or of expressing her own femininity-an act that has been rendered taboo-but rather of acquiring an- other, artificial femininity. Constraining the body, inhibiting its full, natural development,?1 deform- ing a young, barely formed body to make it con- form to an ideal object to be bought by a man, adorning that body less to reveal it than to dis- simulate its true sexual alterity, and, what is es- sential to the success of the operation, silencing it and its owner-these are the objectives of Gigi's education (in French formation). The occultation is of necessity physical and verbal. The French ex- pression mon ce-que-je-pense (literally "my what- I'm-thinking") clearly establishes the interdepen- dence between sexuality and thought, as well as their repression by patriarchal society where women are concerned. For this fundamentally negative instruction undertakes to deny women the possibility of cultivating their thought and sexuality by and for themselves. A thinking woman would seek (self-) expression. A speaking woman would articulate her body in its own right and doubtless would not continue to accept an in- ferior status. By imposing an education devoid of intellectual content, society endeavors to prevent women from thinking: they are taught only what will make them subservient to men. By creating the fraud of "feminine modesty"-and the quoted passage (184) demonstrates how artificially such modesty is acquired-society aims to sup- press the self-awareness of the female body. The semiotics of the double layers of clothing (pant- ies and underskirt) as concealment will not suf- fice; it has to be supported by the body itself, which must make the position of its knees an unconscious reflex. "Decency" will be inscribed within the body, which will hide itself automati- cally, and "thought" will be disassociated from it. Silence, the "proof" that women will have re- pressed even the thought of their sexuality, will crown the undertaking with success. Always lin- guistic, as Freud points out, repression has already been effected in the language taught Gigi, since her vocabulary lacks any signifier for her sexual- ity. Yet, while the phrase Gigi uses testifies to this absence, it also remedies it and thus constitutes a "return of the repressed," which is quickly sanc- tioned by the shocked superego (or, rather, under the circumstances, by its delegate, Mme Alvarez), who immediately invokes dominant ideology in response. Gigi's expression is considered particu- larly scandalous because it signifies the taboo referent, thought, and the desire for a discourse inclusive of both." Consigned to silence, then, any distinct, positive femininity experienced by and for women as subjects must vanish. The reified femininity that replaces it will complete its elimination. Mme Alvarez, we know, experienced such a loss, which is reconfirmed here. When Gigi demands a name for her sexual anatomy, Mme Alvarez turns to her mirror for a reply. But her scrutiny is futile; she sees nothing in the glass but the reflection of her physical mask. The sign of a femininity objectified by and for men, it cannot possibly supply signifiers for what it does not sig- nify, for what it represses. Unfortunately for both of them, Mme Alvarez mistakes this objectified femininity for objective reality: "Mme Alvarez . . . looked at her heavy Spanish face in the mantlepiece mirror, and decided, 'There is no other name.'" More than anything else, the exhortations to 796</page><page sequence="5">Susan D. Cohen silence that always accompany the instructions concerning Gigi's physical comportment under- score Mme Alvarez's and Alicia's unconscious complicity with the bourgeois system. And logi- cally so, for we have seen that the body itself de- pends on the discourse that names it. Each time that the skeptical Gigi reasons freely-in other words, each time that, without always realizing it, she contests the laws of the code-she is met with the same succinct injunction. Her guardians order her to be silent or, what amounts to the same thing, refrain from answering her questions. (For exhortations to silence, see 188, 194, 196, 216; for lack of response, see 204, 217.) Once again the manifest motive is practical. In Mme Alvarez's view, Gigi is learning how to turn her social situ- ation to her advantage, that is, how to extract the most money possible from the man to whom she will ultimately sell herself. Mme Alvarez voices her thoughts on the subject of female speech quite openly to Andree, who, according to her mother's criteria, has flubbed her own "debut" in life and therefore needs more frank advice, in order to cor- rect her errors. "Curb your tongue, my daughter. Calling things and people by their name has never led anyone anywhere" (197). Still more revelatory of this linguistic co-optation are Gaston's reproaches to Mme Alvarez after Gigi refuses to become his mistress. Confronted by the infuri- ated Gaston, Mme Alvarez, whom he had charged with communicating his proposition, protests, "Gaston, God is my witness that I told her . . . ," and he interrupts, "You told her too much!" (224). Poor Mme Alvarez: on the one hand, she is reprimanded by Gaston for having botched her mission as ally by speaking too much; on the other, she is criticized by society's other ally, Alicia, for not having exploited all the dis- cursive resources of the code-in other words, for not having said enough: "How did you speak to the little brat? .. ." "I talked reason, I talked family. I enumerated every- thing she could gain for herself and for us." "And unreason [dJraison], you didn't speak to her of unreason? You didn't speak about love, voyages, moon- light, Italy?" (226) Yet the failure is due less to Mme Alvarez's in- competence than to Gigi's intelligence. To be sure, Gigi will remain incredulous throughout her ap- prenticeship. She will not, however, remain speechless. Physically and verbally Gigi is a trans- gressor of codes. Her body struggles with the con- straints imposed on it: silk stockings make her itch (192), her neck unconsciously tries to free itself from a tight collar (213), her curling papers annoy her (184), she doesn't hold her body correctly, and so on. Far more outrageous, though, are her lin- guistic violations. Gigi constantly commits the crime of naming out loud a system meant to re- main tacit. Unhappily for her, her remarks, proof of spontaneous and independent thought, are ei- ther derided or dismissed with commands to be silent. The women around her perforce consider her comments a sign of dull-wittedness, since for them, in a society whose fundamental inequalities they have not challenged, ruse constitutes the only intelligence. Thus, after Gigi suggests that a baron might marry one of her classmates to whom he has given several gifts, Andree exclaims, in the name of realism, "This child discourages me. . . . She must have come from another planet" (189). When, during a long lesson filled with in- terminable lists of things either forbidden or in- dispensable, Gigi expresses the fear of not being able to remember everything, Alicia declares, "What is important is not that you remember but that I know" (211). If Gigi does not learn the pro- posed code, only her stupidity can be to blame. She should therefore be quiet and rely on the knowledge of her pedagogues. As her grand- mother puts it, "Silence! If you don't understand anything about anything, at least let people who are capable of reasoning do so" (216). The lesson in Aunt Alicia's home ends with a particularly pertinent passage that simultaneously makes statements about the goal of Gigi's educa- tion, about her implicit criticism of it, and, most important, about the mechanism of disdainful repression of all thought or speech that runs counter to the code. "Oh!" [Alicia says.] "Do remind me to teach you how to choose cigars." Gilberte's eyes widened so much that the ends of her eyelashes touched her eyebrows. "Why?" She received a little slap on the cheek. "Because I do nothing without having a reason. If I'm to concern my- self with you, I have to think of everything. When a woman knows a man's preferences, cigars included, when a man knows what pleases a woman, they are well armed against one another." "And they fight," concluded Gigi, looking shrewd. "What do you mean, they fight?" The old lady 797</page><page sequence="6">Colette's Gigi and the Politics of Naming looked at Gigi in consternation. "Ah," said she, "it cer- tainly wasn't you who invented the three-sided mirror. . . . Come, Miss Psychologist, let me give you a note for [the dressmaker] Mme Henriette of Bechoff's. ..." (212) With the observation "And they fight," Gigi reaches an obvious conclusion: she is being trained for the sole purpose of entering into a struggle with men. She also realizes, though per- haps obscurely at this point, that the combat does not take place between equals. For the "arms" in question subordinate women to men before the hostilities even commence: they are insufficient (in that period a girl learned nothing that could en- able her to assert herself socially, economically, or politically) and they are alienating. From the con- strained body to the banished sex, from the super- stitions women must pretend to believe in to the cigars they should know how to choose, these arms shape women for men, not for themselves. Condemning women to a life of extorting money, they can at most procure the meager compensa- tions of the oppressed; they cannot provide truly liberating advantages. Far from evincing joy at this adumbrated prospect, Gigi's remark expresses burgeoning resistance. Astonished by the seeming slowness in this young girl, who after hours of instruction seems only now to perceive the basic given (that women must arm themselves), Alicia ridicules Gigi with a doubly pertinent metaphor. She puts into femi- nine form the masculine understatement that in French constitutes a cliche designating stupidity. She turns "it certainly wasn't you who invented gunpowder" 'ce n'est pas toi qui as invente la poudre' into "it certainly wasn't you who invented the three-sided mirror." As this procedure shows, in male-dominated societies feminization always entails pejoration, especially in language. (See Dale Spender for an elaboration of the concept of pejoration and for other linguistic examples.) Ut- tered spontaneously, Alicia's witticism uncon- sciously exposes the system in which, deprived of any direct relation to the world, women have only oblique access, via the indirect mediation par ex- cellence: the mirror. Articulated around the values of conquest and domination (of nature, of tech- nique, of the other), which are symbolized by gun- powder, society relegates women to inactivity, in other words, to devalued activities, and grants them only a passive instrument of reflection. If they try to make of this instrument an active weapon, it only reinforces their alienation, be- cause its function is a secondary, reactive one. It merely verifies other arms, the weapons of co- quetry, to which women have been reduced and whose negative, repressive effects I have already indicated. Alicia's sally is particularly pertinent in its ap- plication to Gigi. Not only has the young girl not invented the looking glass, she doesn't even think to use it. Unlike the majority of Colette's heroines, Gigi almost never looks at herself in the mirror. (The exception is discussed later.) From the soci- etal perspective represented here by Alicia, this ne- glect signifies that Gigi is not a "woman." This is precisely the failing for which she is reproached throughout the text. It is as though the socializa- tion of women as such required an additional "mirror stage." In the childhood mirror stage described by Lacan, the individual constructs it- self against a background of separation from the whole ("le tout"). If the reflected image affirms an identity that, divided though it may be, per- ceives itself as a self, then the second, feminine mirror stage works in the opposite direction.12 The mirror will now enact the disindividuation of women, their renunciation of selfhood so that they conform to the prescribed image of "woman." Critics have noted the extreme importance of mirrors in Colette's work.'3 Yet her heroines have recourse to them not to find narcissistic reinforce- ment but to "control themselves," to "master [sic] themselves," to "maintain surveillance over them- selves," "to get hold of themselves," to "correct themselves." Such vocabulary crops up continu- ally and shows that the looking glass functions above all as a policing instrument. Insidiously linked to "feminine modesty," it too is a dis- simulating agent whose use must be learned. Everything that does not fit in the frame of the prefabricated image must be driven from the mir- ror reflection. But by splitting themselves in this game of hide-and-seek, individuals merge into "woman" and, with rare exceptions, disappear en- tirely or become unrecognizable.'4 Thus in Cheri, when Lea glimpses her un-made-up face at a mo- ment when she has relinquished control of her ex- pression, she can no longer identify it as her own: "A panting old lady repeated her gesture in the oblong mirror, and Lea wondered what she could possibly have in common with that madwoman" (190). Not to cultivate the imposed image, not to want to participate in the rigged battle of the 798</page><page sequence="7">Susan D. Cohen sexes, is to transgress society's rules. Society in turn defends itself by derision and by authority. Indeed, Gigi's guardians prolong their tutelage, keeping her in a state of retarded childhood, be- cause of her reluctance to become "woman." To verbalize this system, especially for the op- pressed person to do so, is to threaten it, as the instantaneous repression of any unorthodox utter- ance proves. A striking illustration is provided by Gaston's horror at Gigi's explicit definition of his proposition: "... you told grandmother that you wanted to make me a future. . . . I've been told over and over that I'm behind for my age, but I do understand what words mean. Making me a future means that I'd leave here with you, that I'd sleep in your bed. .. " "Gigi, please!" "But uncle, why should I be embarrassed to talk to you about it if you weren't embarrassed to talk about it with grandmother? Grandmother wanted me to see it all through rose-colored glasses." (222) Gigi continues with a detailed description of what is really being proposed: a life of dependency, in- security, and ultimate abandonment with no pos- sible appeal, for lack of both a discourse in which to make one and an audience to hear it: "But I know more than what she told me. I know very well that if you make me a future, I'll have to have my picture in the papers and go to the Flower Festival and to the races at Deauville. When you drop me for good, like you did when you had enough of Gentiane des Cevennes ..." "What! You know that?" (222) And it is immediately after this scene that Gaston reproves Mme Alvarez for having talked too much.'5 By violating the code, Gigi is not en- deavoring to overturn the social apparatus, for she still does not fully grasp the extent of her exclu- sion and mutilation. Rather, she is attempting something whose revolutionary implications es- cape her, and therein resides her "naivete." She is trying to find voice, words, and an audience for herself within language. In effect, Gigi is the story of a young girl who seeks to express herself, to constitute herself, but who, despite the ostensibly happy ending, fails, for lack of discourse and efficacious feminine solidarity.'6 Her matriarchal entourage notwith- standing, she remains doubly isolated: on the one hand, she is forbidden to associate with girls her own age on the pretext that they come from "common" families (207-08), and on the other, she has before her only the models of her grand- mother, her great-aunt, and her unhappy mother. All three are far too alienated themselves to offer her anything but inauthentic, mystifying language. Therefore she can neither express herself nor find a listener. Yet when the time comes to give her re- ply to Gaston's proposition, Gigi demands the right to speak in her own voice: "'She lay down the condition that she herself answer M. Lachaille's proposition and that she discuss it in private with him. That, in sum, it was her own business, said Mme Alvarez" (219). Alone with Gaston, Gigi invokes speech, in a gesture of revolt against the complicity that aims to reduce her to submission, that is, to silence: "Aunt Alicia and Grandmother agree with you. But since this does concern me at least a little bit, I feel I have my own word [mot] to say: my word is that it's not for me." (223). To emphasize the courage it takes to utter these words, despite the censure they will inevitably provoke, Colette shows the intense mal- aise experienced but overcome by Gigi. She "fid- dles nervously" with her hair and clothing but "swallows bravely" and speaks (221). Nevertheless, for want of an authentically, affirmatively femi- nine discourse, Gigi's "no" remains the only word available. It forms the beginning and the end of her revolt. Instead of attracting others, it resonates in a vacuum. So, lacking linguistic solidarity and faced with generalized reprobation and pressure, Gigi "reflects": "I've been thinking, uncle, I've even reflected a lot," she says (228), and she capit- ulates. She completes her apprenticeship, resigns herself to the dictated choice, and accepts the of- fer to become Gaston's mistress. Although Gigi succumbs, she does so lucidly. The day before, she had reacted furiously to the hypocrisy of a declaration of love made by the same man who would have her lead the insecure life of a kept woman, and she had shown Gaston the door (223-24). When he returns, she accuses him, "You've come to cause me more pain!" (228). And the very sentence that heralds her de- feat reveals that, far from falling victim to the generalized deceit, she succumbs fully aware of the trap she has been unable to avoid: "'I swear to you, my darling Gigi.' . . . 'No, don't swear to me. I've reflected that I prefer being unhappy with you to being without you. So . . . ' She be- gan over again. 'So, there it is. Hello. Hello, Gaston"' (228-29; emphasis added). Rather than 799</page><page sequence="8">Colette's Gigi and the Politics of Naming consider her statement a figure of amorous dis- course, one must read it literally. Its message is that Gigi knows that she is merely choosing be- tween two inauthentic states, both of which con- demn her to unhappiness. Her surrender has special significance because it is translated into onomastic terms; that is, it is situated on the level where everything in this text is played out. For the first time, with the last words she utters, Gigi ad- dresses Gaston by his given name without "uncle" preceding it. Far from connoting a new equality, this appellative signals the definitive passage from childhood and adolescence to "womanhood," or the abandonment of all efforts to develop herself and express herself freely and the acceptance of prefabricated femininity with its attendant inferi- ority. Moreover, this final admission of defeat is quickly followed by its physical manifestation: here, too, language determines physiology. All the corporeal symbolism used until then to represent the unsubmissive young girl in Gigi reverses itself. Her straight neck, a metaphor for her indepen- dence and her resistance to artificial femininity ("her powerful, archangel-like neck" [218], "her neck shaped like a column, strong and scarcely feminine" [221], "she automatically tried to liber- ate her beautiful, muscular neck, confined in a whalebone collar" [213]), is now bent, and her hair, which figured the treasure of an untamed, free spirit, is now offered to a new owner.17 Thrilled by the turn of events, Alicia "pointed to Gigi, who lay her confident head and the richness of her loose hair on Lachaille's shoulder" (229). Gigi succeeds in the game beyond the wildest hopes of her guides, but at the price of her al- terity. Coming after Gigi's submission, Gaston's request for her hand represents a Pyrrhic victory. It is significant that Gaston waits to propose mar- riage until Gigi seals her verbal surrender with its physical counterpart. The textual succession is crucial: "So, there it is. Hello. Hello, Gaston." She held out her cheek as usual. He kissed it a bit longer than usual, until he felt her become attentive, then immobile in his arms .... She [Alicia] pointed to Gigi, who lay her confident head and the richness of her loose hair on Lachaille's shoulder. The happy man turned towards Mme Alvarez. "Mamita," he said, "would you do me the honor, the favor, the infinite joy of granting me her hand ..." (229) With these words the novelette ends. It is equally revelatory that when Gaston asks for Gigi's hand, a metonymy for that which remains unnameable, for the sex he appropriates, he speaks not to Gigi but to her grandmother. His reflex proves that by acceding to the status of woman, Gigi is simply changing tutors, and the textual organization it- self stresses this fact.'8 The novelette opens with a scene presenting Gigi literally in the hands of her grandmother, who is arranging the young girl's hair, the locks of which are "imprisoned" in curlpapers (183); it closes with a scene that shows her caught in Gaston's arms, neck bent, hair transformed into an offering. A terrible triumph that has cost a woman the struggle for a discourse capable of extricating her from anonymity, this false fairy-tale ending, this "victory" dooms Gigi to disappear beneath "Mme Lachaille," an im- proper name that signifies the property of an- other.19 Perhaps one day she too will cry out, like Fanny in La seconde, "my house, my poor do- main of a woman who possesses nothing of her own!" 'qui ne possede rien en propre!' (86). Attention must be brought to the continued tex- tual importance of Gigi's skirt, which is men- tioned for the first time at the very beginning of the novelette. I will limit myself to indicating its privileged symbolic role: it represents the structure to which Gigi finally succumbs. Inasmuch as it connotes innocence and childhood, the short skirt denies femininity and, as long as she wears it, fixes Gigi in a state of asexual childhood: she has a childlike mouth, she is "the little one," the "lanky child," "she looked like an archer, she rarely looked like a young girl" (185). But the text exposes the hypocrisy of a sociolect that forces the young girl into a double contradiction. On the one hand, society decrees asexuality and does a vanishing trick on her body, which disappears un- der the metaphor. The young body cannot be femininely gendered: devoid of any sex at all, it leans instead toward a supposedly desired mascu- linity. In a sense, there exists no young girl, there is only a tomboy (the French expression "garCon manque" 'failed boy' is more telling), a "boy in skirts" (185), a "snub-nosed angel" (192), a "drunken page boy" (193), a figure completely un- aware of sexuality and still less of her own sexu- ality. The order "pull down your skirt," reiterated at every turn and accompanied by the command "draw your knees together"-the little skirt of course leaves the knees bare-constantly calls 800</page><page sequence="9">Susan D. Cohen Gigi's attention to a sexuality that she is supposed neither to think about nor to feel. The underly- ing logic is that young girls must remain without sexuality for themselves, whereas they can very well be unconsciously sexy for others. Indeed, the narrator, who uses the "objective" voice, makes numerous sensual allusions to Gigi.20 This voice enumerates from the "outside" voluptuous charms that Gigi presumedly does not know she pos- sesses. Thus we read on the very first page: "Her plaid skirt let her lisle stocking show above her knees, whose oval rotulas, without her suspecting it, were perfection itself" (183). Eyes always other than her own notice the erotic qualities of her "rosy cheeks and white teeth" (Mme Alvarez, 202, 205; Alicia, 211; Andree, 202). Alicia feels Gigi's breasts and pronounces them pretty (212) while Gigi purportedly feels nothing; unbeknownst to her her mouth is "closed but destined to be opened to savour delights" (223); it is a "mouth ignorant of its own power" (221); and so forth. Yet several textual elements cast doubt on this sup- posed asexuality and self-ignorance. Gigi's physi- cal (and verbal) resistance to the contradictory restrictions imposed by her short skirt have been noted, as has on another level the frequently parodic tone of the narrating voice. In addition, this voice describes a number of gestures made by Gigi that can be read as the expression not of the absence of eroticism but, to the contrary, of a spontaneous voluptuousness. I cite only a few ex- amples: Gigi takes great pleasure in eating and in seeing and touching beautiful things. Excited by a "passionate" game of cards with Gaston, she rolls "her beautiful, mussed head of hair on Lachaille's sleeve" (202). But society represses these manifestations, treating them as uncon- scious, childish (read nonsexual) indiscretions. For feminine sexuality can only be external. Society, as has been seen, denies woman anything but reflected sexuality and hence does not allow the natural, spontaneous sexuality shown by Gigi. For this reason she is continually told to hold herself "properly." If the short skirt locks Gigi into childhood, the long one acknowledges only conventional femi- ninity. It functions like a mask, simultaneously hiding and signifying, but signifying something other than what it hides. It works in precisely the same way as Mme Alvarez's facial mask, with the same consequences. The long skirt is the sign of the taboo on female genitals, a taboo that applies not to men but to women themselves, and it is the sign of entry into the social system. As soon as she puts it on, Gigi becomes "this new big girl" (213). She exchanges pleasantries with Gaston and manipulates the ready-made discourse of the co- quette. For the moment, though, the disguise re- mains superficial, and the text emphasizes the lack of accord between it and Gigi's body: "She paraded before Gaston in a blue and white dress that reached almost to the floor. . . . The slenderness of her waist tightly laced in a thick ribbon with a silver buckle made her proud. But she automatically endeavored to free her beauti- ful, muscular neck, confined in a whalebone col- lar. . . . Gigi coquettishly pinched the puffs of her sleeves . .. " (213). As long as her all too real body belies the mask, as long as the disguise has not stuck, it elicits criticism and corrective measures. Gaston reproaches Gigi concerning the incongruity of her rebellious neck: "'With that collar that's bothering you, you look like a hen that swallowed an oversized lump of corn. Look at yourself.' Offended, Gilberte consulted the mir- ror" (213). It is significant that Gigi only looks at herself in the mirror when ordered to by society's direct representative, who commands her to re- adjust her mask because it is not suppressing her sufficiently. Another dimension appears when the newly disabused Gigi takes hold of the symbol and plays with it as such. Setting aside the long dress at the moment she refuses Gaston, she once again wears her short plaid outfit that "cramped her bosom" (220) and shows her long legs. The message of this mask, which Gigi transforms into a conscious travesty, is that she prefers the supposed asexual- ity of childhood to that of alienated adult "femi- ninity," since the latter not only deprives women of personal sexuality, as does the former, but also makes them dependent on men: "Uncle, you told Grandmother you wanted to make me a future." "A very wonderful one," said Lachaille firmly. "It will be wonderful if I like it," said Gigi no less firmly. . . Then Gigi continues: " . . now I'm going to propose something to you. You would come here as usual. ... you would bring me licorice . . . on Sundays we'd play an enormous game of piquet. ... a life without all this business of 801</page><page sequence="10">Colette's Gigi and the Politics of Naming sleeping in your bed and everyone knowing it, of be- ing forever photographed and on the lookout. .. " (222-23) Clearly sexuality has become synonymous with dependence, notoriety, and continual uncertainty. Gigi therefore prefers to do without it, and her at- titude approaches that of her mother. We know, however, that she will be unable to pursue this course. Obviously, the skirt symbolism illustrates the double bind in which Gigi is caught on every tex- tual level, that is to say, the choice between social nonexistence and assimilation into society at the price of self-expression and individuality. On the vestimentary level it translates into the child- woman dichotomy. On the "child" side, society forbids sexual body language just as it prohibits speech, by eliminating women from discourse and enjoining Gigi to silence. It silences her body just as it silences her words. On the adult, "woman" side, it reduces women to silence by dissimulating them, covering them with something else. Soci- ety's dictated discourse and its prescribed long skirt are hieroglyphs designed for masculine deciphering. They never allow women to dis-cover themselves in order to articulate themselves. Fur- ther, because of the signifiers' "loaded" quality, men will decode only a nonthreatening message, since they themselves will have encoded it before- hand.21 Thus, of the two skirts, one denies sexu- ality and the other negates it. The onomastic level, in the narrow sense of the term, presents similar binary qualities. It first di- vides given names and patronymics. A second di- vision is contingent on the speaker from whom the vocative emanates.22 Space does not permit an exhaustive examination, so I merely sketch the appellative system used for the protagonist. It has been remarked that the heroine's family name functions negatively because of its absence from the text (see n. 3), a gap that her future husband's name fills in promissory-form, at the end of the text. The opposition can be represented as follows: The patronymic's empty slot equals childhood, social nonexistence, asexuality. The slot filled by the husband's name (Lachaille) equals social existence as "woman" (wife), submission to patriarchy, disappear- ance of the feminine, (see above, p. 800) Because, until the last page, the absence of the patronymic condemns the protagonist to indeter- mination, one could maintain that this lacuna motivates the dichotomy in the given name, which will vacillate until her social status becomes stabi- lized, a function incumbent on the patronymic. As long as she is not definitively situated, her en- tourage causes the heroine to oscillate from one side to the other of the line between child and "woman," which translate onomastically as Gigi and Gilberte. That Gigi (I use this form for lack of a neutral term) never finds herself in circum- stances where she might express a preference for one or the other of the appellatives stresses her ex- clusion from all onomastic choice, be it in the wider or narrower linguistic sense. Mme Alvarez, the character who raises Gigi and speaks to her the most, demonstrates the alterna- tion at its richest. Instead of depending on chance, her choice of appellatives proves sys- tematic and highly connotative. When Mme Al- varez utters it in moments of tenderness "Gigi" is a hypocoristic diminutive that truly diminishes, for it designates the beloved child, the "little one," and connotes her childish, naive granddaughter (her petite fille).23 In contrast, she uses the appel- lative "Gilberte" when she interpellates and scolds and when she wishes to inculcate in her the laws of the code. Then Mme Alvarez figures no longer the tender grandmother but the social order's representative. "Gilberte," the official given name, severs familiarity and connotes the "big" girl the heroine ought to be and the corresponding be- havior expected of her. In itself, it constitutes a re- proach, a "this is what you still have not become at this late date," pronounced by the sociolect. Aunt Alicia uses only the diminutive to desig- nate Gigi. This haughty, venerable expert views Gigi as unambiguously on the "child" side, as "a bunch of raw materials" (186) whose refinement Alicia has deigned to undertake. She has scarce occasion to invoke the sociolect, moreover, since Gigi, awed by her great-aunt, pays careful atten- tion to her manners and bearing while visiting her. When Gigi goes against Alicia's wishes, she is but further diminished. Thus, infuriated by Gigi's re- jection of Gaston's proposition and interpreting this act as a grave childish prank, Alicia calls her indirectly a "little brat" (225) and to her face an "idiot," an epithet that implies "little" as well. As for Andree, her limited textual presence is or- ganized in such a way that she never speaks to her 802</page><page sequence="11">Susan D. Cohen daughter. (She refers to her three times indirectly: in a flashback as "this child" [189], when Gigi at twelve was indeed one, and as "the little one" [196, 198]. Lack of textual development makes it impossible to determine the intentionality behind these appellatives, but they appear to classify Gigi as a child.) This situation is anything but inno- cent. The absence of lingnistic contact implicitly reflects a deficiency in the maternal relationship. Because Andree works, Mme Alvarez plays the role of Gigi's mother. But it has been noted that Andree's job is not perceived as worthy of respect. Quite the contrary. Consequently, her working makes of Andree a "negligent" mother, as Mme Alvarez insinuates: "Andree, as you know," she observes to Gaston, "has neither the time nor the desire to take care of the little one" (215). Here as well, Mme Alvarez perpetuates a dichotomy whose effects she does not understand: the artifi- cially imposed conflict between motherhood and work. This issue also has onomastic repercussions. In Colette's texts, working women always have names-Andree Alvar in Gigi, Renee Nere in La vagabonde, and so on-whereas wife-mothers do not. The latter are reduced to their function, as Colette clearly points out in L'ingenue libertine, in her reference to Minne's mother: "that so slen- der little girl resting by her side fills and limits the future of Mrs. -what does her name matter! Her name is 'mother' . . ." (14). In addition, accord- ing to the logic of a social system in which only young women have exchange value, it would be to Andree's advantage to have Gigi remain a child. Once again acting as the system's delegated spokeswoman, Mme Alvarez invokes Andree's supposed jealousy of her daughter, in order to re- fuse Gigi's request for a long skirt: "Now your mother would just adore going 'round with a great gawk of a girl who would look eighteen years old!" (185). Onomastic pertinence in the Gigi-Gaston rela- tion resides in the continuity of an officially un- equal reciprocity that contains no alternation. Gaston calls the heroine solely by the diminutive, thereby immobilizing himself in a posture over- determined by the code. Whatever his personal qualities or weaknesses may be, Gaston, by dint of his sex, his wealth, and his age, incarnates the social order. He represents the rich lord who con- descends from time to time to accept a cup of chamomile tea at the home of these modest women. The superiority of both his fortune and his age (he is 33 and Gigi is 15) authorizes him to address the young girl in the familiar tu form and to use the diminutive. That he begins to desire her sexually, that the child has developed into a desirable woman, does not modify her onomas- tic status. Consequently, her social status, which reflects the status of her name, also remains un- changed. Gaston persists in calling her "Gigi," and desire does not prevent him from ordering her around like a child. At the moment he is about to suggest she become his mistress, he sends her im- periously to her room so that he might negotiate with Mme Alvarez, among "adults" (218). If af- ter this incident the connotations of the diminu- tive widen to include a lover's tenderness (albeit a proprietary one-see 228, "my cherished Gigi"), they retain their belittling effect. The appellative continues to communicate a status of official subordination, which the entire textual progres- sion leads one to believe will scarcely change when Gigi leaves her relatives, guardians who hold only delegated power, for Gaston, someone who directly incarnates permanent authority. Legally, socially, and economically, Gigi will remain de- pendent on Gaston. His charge, his "little wife," "his treasure" will never attain the full, ac- knowledged privileges of adulthood, no matter what their personal relations may become. Even if Gigi manages to henpeck her husband, she will remain officially subordinate to him.24 This is the prospect suggested by the onomas- tic formulation that seals Gigi's surrender. Until her capitulation, the relation inferior-superior communicated itself in unambiguous linguistic fashion. Gigi "naturally" coordinates the respect- ful formal you (vouvoiement) with the appellative "Uncle Gaston," with which she addresses the older man. Initiated when Gigi was a small child, this formula of imaginary relation instituted an inferiority that would be difficult to dissipate even in the absence of social constraints.25 As has been shown, the context in which Gigi uses just the name "Gaston" communicates above all con- cession on her part. The new form of address im- plies an incipient intimacy that will presumably be accompanied by the familiar tu but that is not at all synonymous with equality, either inside or out- side the bedroom. The narrator's alternative use of Gigi and Gil- berte forms a textual play that ultimately effaces the opposition. To begin with, the contrast fades quantitatively: "Gigi" appears fourteen times 803</page><page sequence="12">Colette's Gigi and the Politics of Naming while "Gilberte" occurs sixty-nine times. Yet nei- ther progression nor a bias toward the "adult" side can thereby be deduced. In fact, the names do not have the distinguishing features for the narrator that they have for Mme Alvarez. (Le Huenen and Perron note that in general "the same appellative will appear differently motivated ac- cording to whether it has its source in a narrator or in characters" [36].) Without conducting an ex- haustive study-to be sure, each occurrence ought to be contextually scrutinized-one easily discerns a complex narrative attitude. At times the narra- tor speaks with the voice of the sociolect, and "Gilberte" represents what is expected of the young girl. At other moments the narrator projects into the point of view of one or another character who echoes this same societal perspec- tive. But it must not be overlooked that the nar- rative voice is often parodic, criticizing society's dictates in its very presentation of them. At such times "Gilberte" connotes the societal trickery that calls Gigi a "big girl" without granting her the right to independent individuality. In other words, since she is forced into perpetual depen- dency, since she is prevented from developing into an autonomous adult woman, the contrast proves false. With not maximum but minimum diver- gence between them, both names reduce the pro- tagonist, regardless of her age, to a subordinate status. Thus "Gilberte" as well as "Gigi" are in truth situated, and situate the heroine, on the "child" side. The other side will remain empty or, rather, occupied by the man. Colette uses several techniques to show that the dichotomy represents at most a pseudotransition. She entitles the nov- elette Gigi, which indicates the protagonist's fun- damentally unchanging social status. Moreover, she frequently associates the name "Gilberte" with signifiers emphasizing childishness, as though to demystify the idea of progression that society misleadingly attaches to that appellative. At the text's end, for example, when Gigi has sup- posedly become an adult, one finds: "Gilberte made a childish gesture with her shoulders" (227). And the last allusion to the character uses the diminutive in the very sentence that confirms her submission, her new "adulthood." "She pointed to Gigi, who lay her confident head . . . on Lachaille's shoulder . . ." (229). This sentence reveals the real opposition. It consists, of course, in the confrontation between the given name or diminutive and the patronymic, a name always masculine and the only socially valid one. One could hardly hope for a clearer expression of the inequality of the struggle between women and the society that diminishes them. In conclusion, it is important to recall that where Gigi fails, Colette succeeds. Colette fixed as subject and object of her oeuvre the progressive affirmation of a language in her own name and of her name in language. Her entire literary enter- prise consists in establishing a "properly" femi- nine discourse and a feminine name. She follows a procedure opposite to that of Mme Alvarez, who, having taken a name that suppresses her, does not write. Whom could she write? To the contrary, Colette forges a name that expresses her self, and she writes. As signer, she traversed every onomastic stage, from occultation (her husband Willy signed her first books) to patronymic co- optation (she signs "Colette Willy" and subse- quently "Colette de Jouvenel") to the highly moti- vated and symbolic choice of the single proper name of "Colette." Its very singularity stands as the crowning manifestation of one woman's achievement of self-awareness rather than as an anaphora of patrilinear descent.26 While gradu- ally making a name for herself, in the several senses of the expression, Colette also provided a fairly complete picture of women's social situation in the early part of this century: of their linguis- tic, economic, and social marginality on the one hand and of their intelligence, adaptability, ex- traordinary vitality, and frequent unsubmissive- ness on the other. Her apprenticeships, as the title of her famous text (Mes apprentissages) indicates, while numerous and difficult, proved efficacious on all these levels. "Now legally, literarily, and familiarly I have but one name, which is mine. Did it take only thirty years of my life to reach that point? I believe, in the end, that the price was not too high" (Naissance 53). At the age of fifty she regained possession, af- ter the fact, of previous texts she had not fully signed. She took a name that, because she chose it, was at last "proper" (she signed "Colette" for Le ble en herbe in 1923), as was her writing, which already named women "properly" because a woman had made it. Not only does Colette's fic- tion "render step by step the development of a tri- umphant and serene femininity" (Resch 138),?7 it presents a voice that articulates the world, women and men, and especially feminine desire in ways quite different from those of dominant masculine 804</page><page sequence="13">Susan D. Cohen discourse. Far from wishing to seize exclusive pos- session of world and language by simulating the existing model, Colette speaks in order to express herself and to give voice to a femininity silenced by a dominant structure whose pretension to uniqueness and adequation eliminates alterity and with it the possibility of a plurality of discourses. Instead of perpetuating this reductive and preemptive practice by simply reversing it, Colette enlarges, enriches, pluralizes language; she diver- sifies literature by writing other texts, contexts, in- tertexts, subtexts. In the course of her work, she repeatedly emphasizes the specificity of these voices in their femininity. On the level of her characters, one recalls exclamations such as those made by Alice in Duo: "the funniest part is that he [her husband] thinks he knows what a woman's desire is" (46) and "but why can't a man ever talk about feminine sensuality without saying enor- mously stupid things?" (78). Calling men directly to account in another text, the narrator-author Colette denounces the bad faith and perversions inherent in masculine discourse when it judges frivolous this feminine creating of language: Man, my friend, you willingly treat woman's oeuvres, which are inevitably autobiographical, as trifles. On whom were you counting, then, to describe her, to bend your ear talking about her, to do her disservice before you, to weary you with her, in the end? On yourself? You've become my friend too recently for me to give you my opinion crudely on that subject. (Naissance 99-100) Barnard College New York, New York Notes 1 Throughout this essay I use the expression "name" in the widest sense, to designate proper and common names indiffer- ently. I base this usage on modern onomastic analyses con- ducted by Levi-Strauss and especially by Jacques Derrida, in De la grammatologie. They have shown that "proper" names function as a systematizing, classificatory principle rather than constitute adequate appellation coinciding perfectly and uniquely with a signified or referent. Consequently, the distinc- tion between "common" and "proper" names has tended to become blurred, and the "proper" has related less to transpar- ent, congruent presence than to "propriety" and "property." This tendency has particular importance for the study of Colette's Gigi, since the passages I most closely analyze con- cern in the first instance an "improper" "proper" name and in the second an essential but absent "common" name. More- over, the absent name, as will be seen, would determine the identity of the person in question as surely as any given "proper" name. This consideration legitimizes its inclusion under the general heading of naming or denomination. I ex- plore the question as it relates to women, which Derrida does not scrutinize in great depth in his discussion either of onomas- tics or of femininity. (See on this question Derrida and McDonald.) 2 All translations of quoted French texts in this essay are mine. 3 Her sister, Alicia, calls her "Ines" (226), something hardly surprising since she is engaged in a similar subterfuge, calling herself "Alicia de St. Efflam" (205). Mme Alvarez's daughter, Andr6e, confirms the power of filiation of the false patronymic she inherits by rendering it more "French" in the interests of her theatrical career: she goes by the name "Andr6e Alvar." Gigi is too young and too distant on the genealogical chain to doubt the name's authenticity. The very pronounced appel- lative play affects above all her first name. Her "family name" never appears; indeed, its absence is highly significant, as will be seen. This empty slot makes Gigi doubly available: she is a virgin without a name (without a father), officially waiting for a man and therefore socially nonexistent. This circumstance constitutes the text's subject. 4 Nicole continues: "The classificatory function pointed out by Levi-Strauss thus develops the double character of con- straint and play in fiction that characterizes the relationship of a novel's names to those of the code in use" (240). Here the constraint is that the name must sound Spanish. The playful aspect is situated on the level of the narrator. Given Colette's humorous emphasis, it is possible to view the name as a re- verse parody of the physical determinism espoused by Balzac. Instead of reflecting Mme Alvarez's physical character and per- sonality, the name determines them. This parody operates in "correct" Balzacian fashion for Gaston, though not on the onomastic level. In the following example we see the body de- termining the rest, in a true caricature of Balzac's techniques: "Since he had a slightly long nose and big, brown eyes, ordi- nary mortals believed he had been swindled" (187). 5 See Simone de Beauvoir on "kept women": Commonplaces, cliches, prejudices, conventional emotions are the basis of their public conversations, and often they have lost all sincerity even in the secret of their hearts. Between lies and hyperbole, language is destroyed. A hetaera's whole life is a sham: her words, her gestures are devoted not to expressing her thoughts but to producing an effect. To her protector she simu- lates love; at times she even does so to herself. For public opin- ion she plays at decency and prestige: she ends up believing herself to be a paragon of virtue and a sacred idol. (2: 395) 6 De Beauvoir remarks about successful courtesans: "Just as in the hetaera's times, being a high-class courtesan provided more opportunities for feminine individualism than the life of 805</page><page sequence="14">Colette's Gigi and the Politics of Naming a 'virtuous woman' [honnetefemme]" (1: 168). She also notes that only a few of the most fortunate or most cunning among them manage(d) to live well. The vast majority live(d) miser- ably, like Mme Alvarez in our text. Colette herself constitutes a rare exception among women in another domain. Only with the help of special circumstances and extraordinary personal qualities have some women been able to free themselves through art, as she did. 7 See de Beauvoir: "In the High Middle Ages, there reigned such license that prostitutes were hardly necessary, but with the organization of the bourgeois family and the advent of rigor- ous monogamy, it became necessary for men to look for fun outside the home." And on the same page she quotes Schopen- hauer's "pompous" statement: "Prostitutes are the human sacrifices made on the altar of monogamy" (1: 166). 8 Homi Bhabha describes this dynamic in the context of English colonialism, certain aspects of which apply to the sit- uation of women who mimic masculine discourse. "Mimicry disavows otherness. They [those who are imitated] use the ruse of desire [for assimilation] for purposes of discipline." See also de Beauvoir: "Very often the kept woman interiorizes her de- pendence; subject to public opinion, she accepts its values; she wants consideration according to bourgeois norms. A parasite of the rich bourgeoisie, she adheres to its ideas; she 'thinks well' [pense bien].... She is on the side of the conservatives" (2: 395). 9 It is fruitful to compare Andree's theatrical life with the life of Mme Alvarez. The mother professes a scorn all the more inauthentic in that she has structured her own life theatrically: she has donned the patronymic mask with its attendant false body and false speech. Andree at least knows that she acts, and when. Although she is unhappy, the theater affords her a minimum of authenticity, since after her performances she discards her costume. In the limited textual space devoted to this character, Colette stresses Andree's refusal to put on any other costume. She wears no makeup, walks around the house in hair curlers and a bathrobe, and makes no attempt to at- tract men. This behavior provokes criticism from her mother (196, 200). It is as though, aware of selling herself on stage, Andree declines to sell herself offstage, preferring to keep for herself the little of her being that is left over. And6e is too frus- trated with her profession and her personal life to correspond to the figure of the liberated actress described by de Beauvoir (2: 546). Colette's La vagabonde offers an example of a "happy" actress, for whom performing procures true liberty. Its value is so great that the heroine, a music-hall mime, re- jects a rich man's proposal because marriage would deprive her of her career and her freedom. Le toutounier furnishes another example: though poor, Colombe prizes her piano above every- thing else. 10 Readers of Colette know well the value she confers on "nature," a word that in her idiolect does not stand in oppo- sition to human beings. While she endows plants and animals with anthropomorphic attributes, men and women, however socialized, are in turn primarily animals, and the words female and male (femelle and male) reappear incessantly in her work. Although she depicts women in a great variety of social cir- cumstances and situates them in well-defined historical periods, it seems that Colette is also attempting to delineate a female essence (as well as a male one: see Godino). She establishes a sort of bestiary, in which it would be possible to isolate laws of behavior as for cats and dogs. Colette valorizes the natu- ral; the naked female body is considered free, endowed with a natural, nonnarcissistic immodesty, as Yannick Resch has in- dicated: "Nudity reveals the natural in the feminine body. ... [It is] ignorant of social prejudices and uncon- cerned with its own beauty" (39). Society, however, refuses woman the expression of her natural sexuality; she is obliged to "adapt," to repress herself. Throughout Colette's ceuvre, what Resch calls "a technique of self-mastery" (30) is elabo- rated. The female body must control itself, subjugate itself un- der the gaze of others. Should woman neglect to take the precaution of this sort of self-concealment, she will be harshly punished. Thus in La chatte Camille loses her husband, whom her lack of modesty, that is to say, her nudity and her undis- guised desire, disgust. As Resch observes: If in Alain's eyes Camille ought to be modest and timid, it is because he thinks that only man conquers, that woman is a prey, and that she has no reason to assert herself, to ensure her sexuality as an equal. ... Camille asserts herself in her nu- dity . . . as a free being demanding the right to love in an ex- change that is no longer one of an offering and a taking. (33-34) Resch rightly views "self-mastery" as a triumph of feminine adaptability, yet Colette's texts, and Gigi and La chatte in par- ticular, also stress its alienating aspects. n It may seem paradoxical that the discursive means used to expel female sexuality from thought require that women think about it constantly. Joan Stewart remarks that the sig- nifier's absence itself merely calls attention to the unnamed sig- nified (88). Mme Alvarez teaches her daughter that even when she feels tired she must wash her "lower body": "For Mme Al- varez had strongly inculcated in her descendants among other virtues the respect of certain rites and maxims such as: 'you can leave your face for the next morning if necessary, in ur- gent situations and when travelling. But washing the lower body, that is woman's dignity'" (199). What is involved, then, is negative thought designed to suppress sexuality rather than to reinforce it. The goal of this purification rite is symbolic obliteration of the troubling presence of feminine sexuality. 12 See Lacan, who speaks of the specular "I" veering toward a social "I" (98). But the social "I" afforded to women is merely the imitation of an "I" imposed by the masculine so- cial "I," and it thus passes through an additional mirror. 13 Resch devotes a chapter of her book to the role of the mirror in Colette's fiction (111-21). She considers the mirror an instrument of scission that allows women at the same time to verify the "character" into which they transform themselves and to contemplate themselves "as they really are." But al- though the mirror permits some simultaneity, it does not af- ford equilibrium. It is too difficult to maintain this secondary duality, and the way women "really are" tends to disappear, as it does for Mme Alvarez. Resch herself states that at times the mirror bears witness to the lack of knowledge of oneself. I would replace "at times" with "frequently" and add that one must also gauge the fatigue incurred, among other harmful ef- fects, by the necessity of living in perpetual bad faith. 14 Resch cites the example of Fanny, who in La seconde manages to maintain a double image. On discovering that her husband has been deceiving her with a friend who lives in their home, she looks at herself in the mirror: "The face of a vio- lent woman was superimposed on her soft, well-groomed, 806</page><page sequence="15">Susan D. Cohen habitual face. Her first gesture was to 'correct' the image. She found herself ugly. Yet because she glimpsed an authentic ex- pression, she felt a 'sort of security'" (116). Artists constitute another exception. Ren6e of La vagabonde knows when she looks at herself in the mirror that she is preparing a mask for the public. Not wanting one for her private life, she rejects men as does Andr6e in Gigi, though under different circumstances. More frequently, however, women lose all sense of themselves and, like Mme Alvarez and Lea, fail to recognize anything but a prefabricated, artificial image. Similarly, Julie, in Julie de Carneihan, cannot identify her reflection when what she sees is an "image d6faite" 'de-composed image' (qtd. in Resch 149). One must not lose sight of Colette's sympathy for these women, who, though they rarely succeed, struggle valiantly to keep up the double game. For most of them have no other choices. 15 A parallel can be drawn with the delation scene re- counted by Levi-Strauss in Tristes tropiques and analyzed by Derrida in De la grammatologie. Having assigned proper names to each of its members, the Nambikwara tribe forbade its people to utter them. A group of little girls breaks this law by telling the names to the visiting anthropologist. Just as in Colette's novelette, the violation of the social code is linguis- tic. To name what is supposed to remain tacit is to denounce the whole social apparatus. Derrida observes; "The transgres- sion of the prohibition, the great game [jeu] of denunciation and the great exhibition of the 'proper' consists not in revealing proper names but in ripping open the veil hiding a classifica- tion and a belonging, the inscription into a system of sociolin- guistic differences. And," adds Derrida (one wishes he had further elaborated the thought), "let us note that an act of war is involved here, and much could be said about the fact that little girls are the ones who indulge in this play and in these hostilities" (164). 16 Such solidarity does exist in Colette's work. In La seconde it takes the form of complicity between victims. Aware that her husband is the lover of the friend living in her house, Fanny understands that she will find support with the friend rather than with her husband: "she turned back to seek help that she could only obtain in solidarity, shaky though it may have been, in a feminine solidarity constantly broken up by men, constantly re-formed at men's expense" (136). Elsewhere solidarity flourishes among a group of women who are not subordinated to men and whose revolt takes the form of a rad- ical refusal-that is, among lesbians. In Le pur et l'impur the narrator frequents a lesbian milieu: . . . how light I found the empty gaiety of the conversation, and diverting certain jousts of eye contact. ... I enjoyed the admirable promptness of the mute language in its exchange of threats, of promises, as though, the slow male put aside, ev- ery message from woman to woman became clear, lightning- like, limited to a small, infallible number of signs.... " (312) The striking emphasis put on communication reappears in other texts. (See Le toutounier and Duo.) Yet the "small num- ber of signs" and the fragmentation of the practice limit re- volt by isolating it. The revolt must, in fact, direct itself toward the practice of the woman writer, who inflects language, forces it to express herself as well, and uses the widest public forum. 17 Despite continual care, Gigi's hair "spills over her tem- ples and cheeks" (192); it is "a bush" (199); it has "magnifi- cent thickness" (183). She has "a wild abundance of ash-blond hair" (205), a "cascade of hair" (194), and so on. Colette as- sociates these qualities of wildness (the hair) and independence (the neck) with beauty, whereas society associates them with the androgynous charm of the tomboy, a charm it permits be- cause it knows that this "boy" will soon settle down, let itself be dominated, disappear. 18 The system's entire economy prepares this transfer. When her guardians accept a priori that they will have to give Gigi to a man, they reveal both that women's children do not be- long to them and that they do not belong to themselves either. Young brides are "given away" to their husbands. A wife "gives" children to her husband after having "given herself" to him. This state of affairs is brought out quite explicitly by Mme Alvarez's discourse, when she refuses to allow Gigi to ap- pear in public with Gaston. "'But I'm not forgetting that I am responsible for a young soul, either. ... I understand better the role of a mother,' said Mme Alvarez soberly. 'I will do everything I can to hand Gigi over only to a man who . . . '" (215-16). 19 Critics have treated Gigi as a version of Cinderella. See Godino (3), Beaumont (30), and Claire Dehon (106). Neverthe- less, I hope to have indicated how repugnant Gigi finds her "glass slippers." Godino also calls attention to "the conflict between independence and submission" in Colette's fiction (146). As I interpret the problem, marriage in the represented system functions as a positively marked diacritical sign in re- lation to the condition of courtesan if a rich husband is in the offing, and a negatively marked one if the prospective husband is poor. But marriage is also negatively marked in relation to a slot that here remains empty: that of liberty. When filled, in Colette's work, the slot signifies, along with independence, relinquishment of sexual contact. (See La vagabonde, La nais- sance du jour, L 'entrave.) Colette's female characters seem con- fronted with the choice between solitude and submission. In La vagabonde, marriage is explicitly presented as erasure of the name (and the person) of Ren6e. Her suitor writes to her, ". . . so we'll love nothing but our own little corner in the world, where you will no longer be Ren6e Nere but Madame My Wife!" (194). We know that Gigi faces the same dilemma and that, not having artistic activity to fall back on as Renee does, she opts for submission. 20 Written in the third-person singular and in the passe sim- ple, the text emanates from an omniscient, though discreet, narrator, who often represents the sociolect. Nevertheless, a sec- ond interpretation comes to mind. We could, with equal plau- sibility, have before us the narrator-author's sensual feelings for her female protagonist. The sociolect sensitizes men and women to feminine beauty, and this appreciative sensuality is manifested in many of Colette's texts. It is not at all necessary to explain it away with elements of Colette's personal life- she had lesbian experiences. For lesbian love such as she depicts it (See Le pur et l'impur) is far less a matter of voluptuous eroticism than one of consolation, mutual comprehension, and security. 21 If this situation does not make women happy, their re- sponse will be put down to female capriciousness, which is im- plicit in Freud's "what do women want?" and dismissed under the category of feminine "mystery." De Beauvoir perceived the relation between such mystery and female clothing: 807</page><page sequence="16">Colette's Gigi and the Politics of Naming And they still have not ceased to dream about and discuss feminine mystery. It is to preserve this mystery that men have begged women for so long not to discard long dresses, pet- ticoats, veils, long gloves, high-buttoned boots: everything that accentuates difference in the Other makes her more desirable since it is the Other as such that men want to appropriate. (1: 304) We know that type of alterity is artificial, created and imposed by patriarchal, bourgeois society. De Beauvoir also links femi- nine mystery to the impossibility for women to articulate them- selves in a language and a culture that provide no place for them. But what they call mystery . . . it's on the level of commu- nication that the word takes on its true meaning: it implies a stammering presence that fails to manifest itself. To say that woman is a mystery is to say not that she doesn't speak but that her language is not heard. She is there, but hidden un- der her veils. ... (2: 388) 22 Perret notes the three aspects of the vocative: (1) its deic- tic aspect, or identification of a referent; (2) its predicative character, or the meaning of the appellative; (3) its revelation of social relations. She affirms that "the deictic aspect can- not be truly separated from the two other aspects of the voca- tive.... In effect, with the chosen term, the speaker indicates not only that he is referring to a certain person but that he names her/him in a certain way and that he has a certain re- lation to her/him" (116). Literary onomastic analysis relates the literary to the social. See Nicole: "The use of proper names in the novel cannot be without relation to their functioning in social life, which the novelist represents, or in the 'natural' lan- guage he or she utilizes" (234). 23 It has been shown that Gigi, because she is considered a child, does not have the right to speak. Perret notes the interre- lation of childhood and imposed silence: "The small child is also the person who does not speak (who doesn't know how to speak, and then who must not speak, like servants). Social diminishing is also diminishing the right of speech" (114). 24 To be sure, everything in the text leads the reader to sup- pose that she will in fact hold some sway over her husband. A close reading discloses the falseness of attributes such as "slow," "childish," and "unconscious" when they are applied to Gigi; it also shows their accuracy when they qualify Gaston. Such epithets abound, and the text never refutes them, except when the financial domain is concerned. Mme Alvarez ex- claims, for example, "He is a child, a veritable child!" (197). The narrator depicts him scornfully, calling him "the Lachaille son": "The Lachaille son reacted somewhat incoherently" (201). He is "the betrayed lover" who will prove stupid enough to pay the highest price for Gigi, by marrying her. He comes to "Mamita's" to mourn his amorous mishaps. He plays cards like a child. And so on. Godino devotes her book to Colette's lack of respect for men. Gaston's childishness vanishes, how- ever, when the businessman in him is described. As such, he is wary, ungenerous, and protective about his possessions. As the disabused Andr6e remarks to her mother, "Not that I'm asking for anything, but since we've known Gaston he has hardly given you anything besides his confidence" (197). One can, then, speculate that though Gigi may come to dominate him on the affective level, he will not allow himself to be divested of his economic superiority. As long as the sway a wife holds over her husband is not concretely founded, it will re- main precarious if not illusory. 25 This form of address establishes a rather unclear relation. Mme Alvarez had "known" Gaston's father "exceedingly well" (188). Might Gaston be the child of the woman he calls "Ma- mita"? Might he really be Gigi's uncle? Could there be a hint of incest involved? 26 Critics have commented on the multiple aspects of this feminine name "Colette," which was not the writer's first name but the patronymic and of which she made both her given and family name. She merged into a single signifier the name of her father, who pretended to be a writer but wrote nothing at all, and the name of the fictional, autobiographical character and narrator in Colette's texts, as well as that of the signer. (Elaine Marks makes the pertinent distinction between Colette the writer and Colette the narrator-character. See also Nancy Miller on this subject as well as on matrilineal and feminine self-encoding in Colette's fiction and Christiane Makward.) 27 This femininity, which for Colette is a maternity as well, also avoids the false contradiction between motherhood and work.
