<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRESENTION OF A DEITY ON A VASE Somnalh Mukhopadkyay, The State Archaeological Museum of West Bengal has secured an interesting bronze vase, now displayed in its gallery.1 It was collected from somewhere in 24 Parganas, very probably from some southern region of this district. It depicts an unusual representation of the image of Gauri or Chandi (?) upon this ghata (Vase). The vase measures some 11 cms. in height and 5 cms. in breadth at the broadest part. The broad bottom of the vase narrows gradually, having a tall funnel shaped neck, and terminates in a hallowed flat disc shaped top. On one side of this small vase is found represented, in almost a three dimensional form, the figure of a seated female in a Lalitasana pose upon a well stretched animal, the head of which indicates it to be an iguana. The hair-do of the figure is secured by a band round the head with an ornamented clasp in the front. The forehead of the figure is broad, she has slightly arched eye-brows, almond eyes, broad nose and sensitive lips The deity wears a pair of heavy ear-pendants, a moon shaped breast ornament, a pair of bracelets, a waist-band and a strap like ornament coming down from the left shoulder. The right hand is shown resting upon her right knee in varada pose while her left hand holds something like a vase. The modelling of the face and the body, and the treatment of the ornaments are strongly indicative of the primitive origin of the entire conception and delineation. This presentation of the goddess on a vase offers an evidence of the fact at one stage the goddess was invo- ked and worshipped in a vase. In the Puranic tradition® the deities to be worshipped can be invoked in an image or in a ghata, In case of tsc ghata described above, it shows that the worshippers had desired to have an anthropomorphic representa- tion of the deity attached to the ghata. The use of a vase or pitcher filled with water while invoking a deity is found in vogue among many tribal people of India.® The affiliation of the vase described here with characteristics of the primitive order is worthy of notice. The earliest independent figure of this deity is found from Mathura,4 datable to about 5th cent. A.D., Though broken at the waist with tha upper part missing and wrongly described by John Anderson in his</page><page sequence="2">700 Catalogue and Hand book of the Archaeological collection in the Indian Museum, the figure was rone other than Gauri with her vahana , a small tailed animal figure i. e, iguana.5 Almost al. the deities belonging to Brahmanical,6 Buddhist7 or Jaina8 tradition have some specific vahana as an insignia. The goddess having an iguana as a mount, who had become at one time a highly popular deity with the people of Bengal,9 and in the evolu- tion of the worship of which devine concepts, probably hidden in the tribal10 and primitive population of the peripherial region of Bengal had played a very significant role. A large number of images of the medieval period,11 bear testimony to the fact that this deity had become very popu- lar in Bengal during pre-Muslim age. Among village folks of West Bengal, the deity is worshipped in-this type of ghata even throughout the year.12 Common people of the distri- cts of Howrah, Hooghly, Birbhum, Bankura, Midnapur and 24 Parganas have held the goddess Chandi in great respect and have worshipped her almost in every visage. The people of these regions know the protector deity Chandi in various forms such as Olai Chandi, Kulai Chandi, Dhelai Chandi13 Kalai Chandi, Melai Chandi etc. All these were probably origi- nally semi-divine spirits14 personifying diseases und troubles of different kinds about whose malevolence the village folks were ever apprehensive. How these names of malevolent spirits came to be associated with Chandi, the great and supreme poweiful goddess of Markandeya Purana 15 cannot be definitely said. It is possible that these evil and malevolent powers conceived as demons and, since Chandi had by her mighty prowess supp- ressed and killed the mighty demons, it was assumed that the name of Chandi, invocation of her as the killer of the respective evils as Ola or Cholera, etc. would save the invoker from the wrath of that evil. This is how, the suppressor of Cholera came to be known as Olai Cnandi to the worshippers. The above discussion would prove that at one time the goddess Chandi hai became an extremely popular deity with the local inhabi- tants.16 In fact a fascination about the ultimate power conceived as a iemale principie started gaining ground at a fairly early age,17 Among a hoast of divinities held in worship by the people, a female deity held as a mother goddess, conceived both as a benign as well as a fearsome power started gaining ground with the rise of Tantrisn .1S At one time Tara19</page><page sequence="3">701 had been held as the most popular female deity among the Buddhists while among the Brahmanical Hindus Durga Mahisasuramardini20 had gained the greatest popularity. From about the 8th-9th centuries of Christian era Chandi arose as a deity of considerable importance. She had, by and large, absorbed the elements inherent in the buddhist goddess Tara,21 known in many forms, and fhe Brahmanical deity Durga had, ultimately, almost completely eclipsed all other female deities in order to emerge as the all encompassing goddess Chandi whose popularity was never matched by any other female deity held in worship in Bengal.
