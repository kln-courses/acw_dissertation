<plain_text><page sequence="1">Walter Stephens Tasso and the Witches If we grant — as critics regularly do — that the figure of Torquato in Tasso's II messaggiero bears some autobiographical relation to the author of Gerusalemme liberata, then we must notice an unusually precise, intimate, and suggestive similarity between the two apparently heterogeneous texts. Like Goffredo, that most unrealistically serene paragon of Counter-Reformation epic values, the imprisoned melancholic Torquato receives an auroral visit from a celestial "messenger." The thematic, lexical, and stylistic traits shared by the two epiphanies reveal profound differences in emotional register and context that shed a penetrating and disturbing light, not so much on the nature of Tasso's malady, as on the mentality of his entire epoch. Unlike recent critics I do not believe that the Messaggiero is primarily significant in terms of Freudian ego-psychology.1 Rather, I hear in the marginalized voice of "Torquato" — whether he is or is not a faithful representation of Tasso's own melancholy, and whether or not that melancholy can be understood in modern clinical terms — a lucid articulation of the spiritual malaise afflicting Tasso's society at large — both Catholics and Protestants — in the worst period of the great European witch-hunt. Tasso was probably alone among his contemporaries in articulating the cosmological, ontological, and epistemological dislocations that provoked the witch-hunt; not until nearly 1700 did defenders of witch-hunting realize the effective metaphysical foundations of the hunt, which was by then under attack from all sides. Nor have modern historians of the witch-hunt achieved the insight displayed in II messaggiero. Beginning with the great liberal, anticlerical historians of the nineteenth century, investigations of the witch-hunt have accepted the self-representations of the inquisitorial class at face-value, and thence dismissed the inquisitorial witch-mythos as unaccountably irrational. Thus they have concentrated on the purely social, secular dimension of the witch-hunt, seeking to explain its ultimate significance in terms of hostilities among classes, and, more recently, as a form of gender-warfare.2 ' Basile, esp. 34, 54-55 and Schiesari 197 have some remote affinities with my reading here. But those who wish to see II messaggiero as primarily about Tasso's personal pathology would do well to look at the original version of it (Raimondi 3.299-468), which is a far more "pathological" document, and yet, at the crucial point that interests Basile and Schiesari, does not mention melancholy at all, but rather ubbriachezza and amore (Dialoghi 3.332, ed. Raimondi; Basile 34-35; Schiesari 198). 2 Bibliography on the witch-hunt is immense. Aside from the other works I will cite, Levack is a Annali d' italianistica 12 (1994). The Italian Epic and Its International Context.</page><page sequence="2">182 Walter Stephens The cosmology that Torquato and his celestial interlocutor discuss in the prison of Sant'Anna intimates that belief in the reality of witches was the last resort of those intellectuals who were losing their faith in the ultimate veracity of Christianity. By implication, II messaggiero shows that some who were most grievously tormented by this loss of faith also built the showiest monuments to faith. In addition to the author of Gerusalemme liberata, their numbers probably included most of those whom we might call the inquisitorial class.3// messaggiero intimates that the hunting and killing — and the theoretical classification — of witches attracted those who must at any cost preserve their will to believe that they lived in a universe overseen by a provident, benevolent, and immanent God. As Nietzsche demonstrated by reversing the logic of Saint Paul's dictum, "'Faith' means not wanting to know what is true" (179), and there has never been a more devastating — or more badly understood — demonstration of this insight than the European witch-hunt of ca. 1400 to 1700. II messaggiero is not a cri de coeur, it is rather a highly crafted, syncretic, and systematic treatise on demonology and angelology.4 The dialogue reveals the melancholia of the inscribed Torquato as an acute instantiation of a chronic pathology that afflicted the culture of the entire literate elite. Like Tasso's highly constructed fictive self, the literate culture at large was unwillingly and anxiously skeptical, and could not convince itself that the spirit-world actually existed.5 Unlike him, it was unwilling or unable to enunciate and examine its skepticism consciously. This is not to assert Tasso's moral or intellectual superiority, but rather his juridical immunity. Paradoxically, it was quite safe for Tasso to enunciate these epistemological and ontological doubts, for his melancholia provided an alibi that was both psychological and physiological.6 recent and thorough introduction and bibliography. ^ The term "witch" will be my shorthand for "accused witch," that is, a person accused of practicing magic with intent to harm people, livestock or crops, and supposed to have had prolonged and repeated personal contact with the Devil. By "inquisitor," I will designate not only judicial officials who conducted interrogations and supervised the application of torture, but also those intellectuals who, without necessarily prosecuting witches, wrote manuals and treatises justifying the hunt. I will use both terms without inverted commas, but I wish neither to imply that witches were guilty of anything whatever, nor that all trials took place in ecclesiastical courts, much less under the auspices of the various Catholic Inquisitions. Trials took place in a great variety of legal venues, and ecclesiastical institutions were not always thoroughly engaged in the prosecution of witches — indeed, sometimes they resisted it. Thus, I will use the term "inquisitor" in a deliberately vague sense to designate the official asker of questions, whether he be lay or cleric, Protestant or Catholic, interrogator or theorist. 4 Baldassarri devotes much attention to the sources and peculiarities of Tasso's demonology, but even he subordinates it rigorously to other concerns: less to autobiography than to the question of sogno, which is indeed intimately related, and to Tasso's dialogues as genre, which is, I think, not. ^ By "spirit-world" I designate the most basic Christian beliefs in the existence of angels, devils, a personal God who is both benevolent and omnipotent, an incarnate savior, and an immortal human soul. ® Indeed, we should remember that the first redaction of II messaggiero lacks the discourse on</page><page sequence="3">Tas so and the Witches 183 Furthermore, melancholies were reputed to be pathological confessors and mythomaniacs. This reputation was juridically significant, for some authorities considered melancholia sufficient grounds for dismissing even the confessions of self-styled witches (Levack 16-17). Tasso's emotional complicity with the Inquisition is well-known from his correspondence. As his mental serenity dissipated under the strain of revising Gerusalemme liberata, and as his relations with Alfonso II deteriorated, Tasso sought to be interrogated by the Inquisition, fearing that he was involuntarily slipping into heresy. That he may also have had political reasons for desiring the ear of the inquisitors, and wished to implicate other dependents of the Estense court, is undeniable (certainly Alfonso appears to have feared so), but is ultimately peripheral to Tasso's hankering for reassurance about his orthodoxy.7 His rage when he was absolved as being merely melancholic, rather than heretical, shows that Tasso understood the institution of the Inquisition and sought relief from his doubt through interrogation and spiritual purgation (as in the purgatio canonica) rather than the corporeal purges administered to melancholies.8 And, as we shall see, the only heresy to which Tasso ever admitted was the one that inquisitors of witches were themselves most liable to, and yet could confess only obliquely, through the obsessively repetitive symptom of extracting fictitious confessions of witchcraft with torture and ventriloquism. Through their mutual reflections and inversions, the two epiphanies of Goffredo and Torquato provide access to the profound discontinuities and contradictions between Tasso's epic and his dialogue, and, by extension and analogy, to the discrepancy between inquisitorial self-representation and inquisitorial symptomology. Properly understood, II messaggiero is the inverted other, the photographic negative, of Gerusalemme liberata, just as, properly understood, the witch-hunt is the irrational obverse or photographic negative of rationalistic Scholastic theology, a method of surreptitiously testing the cosmology, epistemology, and ontology that it purported to accept on faith. Elsewhere I have claimed that Gerusalemme liberata is a "sacramental" epic. At its precise mathematical center Tasso presents a Corpus Christi procession and Mass on the Mount of Olives, whereby, "as in Tridentine doctrine, Eucharist is the moment when the Body of Christ manifests all its aspects: the transubstantiated host, the ascended Body Historical, the re-enacted Sacrifice, and melancholia, which was only added as the prospect of publication materialized. See Baldassarri 273, 282-83 on the daring heterodoxy of the Messaggiero. *7 Tasso's suspicion that Alfonso had obtained this absolution is well-known, but also peripheral to Tasso's travail over his own religious beliefs. Alfonso wished to deflect papal scrutiny from a court already tainted by the Calvinism of his mother Renée de France, and from a state destined to revert to the Church's temporal sovereignty if Alfonso produced no male heir (as in fact happened in 1597). See Solerti 1.257-67, Pittorro 173-87. On forms of pur gat io as "remedy" for heresy, see Mereu 149-72.</page><page sequence="4">184 Walter Stephens the incorporated Ecclesia" (Stephens, "Metaphor" 230). Tasso implies that his mode of allegorical composition is based on the mode of signification attributed by Catholic theologians to Catholic sacraments, and the body-discourse of the poem implicates the Tridentine sacraments systematically.9 Yet this thematic system shows an obsessiveness that reveals Gerusalemme liberata as a kind of talisman, an artifact through which Tasso attempted to concretize and organize a faith that he was finding increasingly elusive. At its opening, an anthropomorphic God the Father looks down upon the encampment of the Crusaders and assesses them sternly but benevolently. As Tasso describes the eyes of the Padre eterno and deploys an entire vocabulary of vision (mirô, s'affisô, guardo, spia, vide, vede, scorge), the anthropomorphism is already undercut in several ways. Most obviously because vision is at least in part a metaphor for another mode of knowledge, the discovery of the inmost dispositions (intimi sensi) of human emotions, themselves metaphorized as "hearts" (GL 1.7-11). Second, the comprehensive and humanly paradoxical glance of God cannot help but recall the beatific vision of Dante, both lexically and epistemologically: "in un sol punto e in una / vista mirô ciô ch'in sé il mondo aduna."10 The difference, of course, is that Dante claimed to have seen God as God sees creation, and thus for Tasso the difference is one of nostalgia and lack, for Dante's vision cannot be duplicated or even adequately remembered. Finally, because, although the anthropomorphic metaphor of vision depicts God as immanent, or participating in creation, and providential, or interested in the lives and fortunes of individuals, Tasso also depicts God as transcendent, or totally above and hence absolutely other than, all he has created, for God looks down from the Empyrean, which is farther from the sphere of the fixed stars than is that sphere itself from the deepest part of hell (GL 1.7). Hell is literally closer to us than heaven.11 This passage, which should be reassuring about the fundamental assertion of Christian faith, already encapsulates the elemental contradiction of Christian theology. The contradiction between a God of immanence and a transcendent God is, as Arthur O. Lovejoy showed, the fundamental contradiction of Christian theology, one that threatens to make the very concept of the cosmos incomprehensible, and thus must be resolved.12 The solution is available only through a third term, either the hypostatic union of the Incarnation, which Dante glimpsed in the depth of his vision, or an angel. And so Tasso's Padre eterno summons Gabriel. The archangel's epithets are not quite symmetrical or synonymous: will he act as 9 See the extended treatments in Stephens, "Saint Paul" (177-91), and "Metaphor" (225-34). 10 GL 1.7.7-8; cf. Paradiso 33.55-145, esp. 85-96. 11 On the larger question, see Quint 92-132, esp. 109: "The withdrawal of Tasso's deity from the natural world leaves a vacuum which demons rush in to fill." 1 O Lovejoy 82-83: ". . . no two notions could be more antithetic. The one was the apotheosis of unity, self-sufficiency, and quietude, the other of diversity, self-transcendence, and fecundity." Cf. 157,315-16, 322-23, 326-27.</page><page sequence="5">Tasso and the Witches 185 the herald of the heavenly court (nunzio giocondo), or rather, as its ambassador and translator (interprète fedel) in parts of the realm so remote as to be alien? This trans-lation and inter-pretation is of course already in itself a metaphoric process, the closing of a gap in signification. But Gabriel's own otherness from human ontology further accentuates the gap between God and humanity: although he is intermediate between God and humanity both in essence and in function, he must nonetheless incarnate himself fictively in order to deliver God's message to Goffredo: la sua forma invisibil d'aria cinse ed al senso mortal la sottopose. Umane membra, aspetto uman si finse, ma di celeste maestà il compose; tra giovene e fanciullo età confine prese, ed ornô di raggi il biondo crine. (GL 1.13.3-8) The very fact that this fictive incarnation is necessary in order to make God's message intelligible can be read as a disturbing commentary on the originary incarnation of the Logos. If Gabriel is already ontologically intermediate between God and man, but must nonetheless mediate himself still further, then the hypostatic union seems by comparison abrupt and paradoxical. This interpretation could appear capricious and exaggerated, but it is borne out by the revision of Gabriel's incarnation in II messaggiero. Like Goffredo, Torquato is visited by a messaggiero, a gentile spirto. The Messenger's incarnation is described in exactly the same terms: "m'apparve un giovane ch!era ne' confini de la fanciulezza e de la gioventù" (Dialoghi 13, ed. Mazzali). Both spirits appear at sunrise to a man whom dawn has already awakened. But there the similarities end. Gabriel appears dramatically and triumphantly to Goffredo: Sorgeva il novo sol da i lidi eoi, parte già fuor, ma '1 più ne l'onde chiuso; e porgea matutini i preghi suoi Goffredo a Dio, come egli avea per uso; quando a paro co '1 sol, ma più lucente, l'angelo gli appari da l'oriente. (GL 1.15.3-8) Having heard the message, Goffredo implements it immediately. More importantly, he never for an instant doubts the veracity or the ontological and epistemological bases of the vision he has just experienced: Resta Goffredo a i detti, a lo splendore, d'occhi abbagliato, attonito di core. Ma poi che si riscote, e che discorre</page><page sequence="6">186 Walter Stephens chi verrne, chi mando, che gli fu detto, se già bramava, or tutto arde d'imporre fine a la guerra ond'egli è duce eletto. (GL 1.17.7-18.4) Goffredo accepts the whole experience unproblematically as fact: he has seen, and therefore believes, that heaven has preferred him, and his acceptance is narrated as if he were already a denizen of Dante's heaven.13 Torquato's experience of the same kind of epiphany is radically different. Like Goffredo, he awakes at dawn, but not in order to pray; rather, he lies in a sensual dormiveglia: Era già l'ora che la vicinanza del sole comincia a rischiarare l'orizonte, quando a me, che ne le delicate piume giaceva co' sensi non fortemente legati dal sonno, ma cosi leggiermente che il mio stato era mezzo fra la vigilia e la quiete, si fece a l'orecchio quel gentile spirto che suole favellarmi ne le mie imaginazioni, e mi chiamö per quel nome che è comune a tutti quelli i quali son nati ne la mia Stirpe. {Dialoghi 6, ed. Mazzali) The impression of decadence is enhanced by a faint allusion to Petrarch's seventh sonnet, "La gola e '1 somno e l'otïose piume." Like the literary echo, the apparition is also purely aural at the beginning; significantly, he will not don a visible fictive body until after trying several other modes of apparition. This fact, coupled with the ambiguity of the term imaginazioni, invites the reader to imitate Torquato's doubt about the reality of the gentile spirto. The intermediate state Tasso evokes is thus initially not ontological but epistemological: it does not describe the being of the "messenger," but rather the indeterminacy of Torquato's mental state. Unlike Gabriel, Torquato's Messenger has not come on any of the errands that Christianity imputes to angels. In fact, Torquato tells him, since you only bring consolation and never help, you would seem not to be an angel. The Messenger's being is as indeterminate as Torquato's mental state, since he matches none of the categories with which Christians are familiar: angelo, anima felice, demone, anima infelice. Perhaps, if notturni fantasmi are something other than these, that is what the Messenger is (Dialoghi 6, ed. Mazzali). The initial indeterminacy of Torquato's consciousness transmutes into an all-pervasive uncertainty about the nature of experience and essence. The mean or median state that angels like Gabriel represent in Christian ontology has here become a neutral (ne-uter) state, about which Torquato cannot be certain either that it is identical with him (a figment of his imagination) or that it is other than him. 1 ^ "Non che '1 vedersi a gli altri in Ciel preporre / d'aura d'ambizion gli gonfi il petto, / ma il suo voler più nel voler s'infiamma / del suo Signor, come favilla in fiamma" (GL 1,18.5-8). Compare Paradiso 8.16 and 3.82-87, esp. 84.</page><page sequence="7">Tasso and the Witches 187 The missing demonic body — Gabriel's artificial or fictive one and the invisible body of the Messenger — is the obsession that links II messaggiero to the great witch-hunt. The task of Torquato's Messenger is never to impart a mission, as Gabriel's was, but rather to bestow certainty of a special order on Torquato, to reassure him that the spirit-world actually exists. But without a visible and intrinsic body, the Messenger's most challenging task is to prove that he himself is real, rather than a very realistic hallucination. Even when he becomes visible, he cannot convince Torquato that the entire experience is not somehow imaginary, and Torquato embarks on a kind of mise en abîme of doubt. This vertigo fascinates contemporary psychoanalytic critics because Torquato describes his personal version of it through an examination of his melancholia. But although Torquato wonders whether this particular spirit is a symptom of his melancholy rather than a real presence, the question is of far broader historical interest. It poses an objectively philosophical conundrum: to be assured that the spirit-world exists Torquato needs to know that he is actually talking to a spirit, rather than to himself; but this reassurance depends on knowing precisely what spirits are and how they fit into the great scheme of things. Torquato shares, in a heightened degree and with a heightened consciousness, literate Europe's anxious need to know whether the spirit-world exists and is accessible to human consciousness, and hence, by implication, whether God exists: that is, whether God is immanent in creation and accessible to human experience. Tasso's dialogue does not, and presumably cannot, explicitly pose the question of God's existence, for it is a public literary performance, subject to censure. Yet Tasso was tormented by the problem in this period. The Messaggiero dates from early 1580, but already a year earlier, at the time of his definitive enclosure in Sant'Anna, Tasso was obsessed by doubts about the nature of God.14 Writing to his friend Scipione Gonzaga on 15 April 1579, Tasso combined a confused and often contradictory justification of his behavior with a lucid, logically and chronologically sequential account of the emotional problems that arose from his inability to believe in the immanent, providential, and personal God of Catholic Christianity. Since it is written to a clergyman in a context that was originally private and secret, since Tasso confides that he has never dared to confess these doubts to other clergy, and because of its rigorous structure and its theological precision, this segment of the letter qualifies as a confession in the technical, sacramental sense.15 Like Saint Augustine in his own Confessions, Tasso stratifies his ^ In fact, given my reading of the Liberata as a sacramental epic intended to serve a personal talismanic function, I would imagine these doubts exacerbated the anxiety Tasso felt toward his poetic and ecclesiastical revisors, and even more toward Roman censors, concerning the doctrinal correctness of the poem (Stephens, "Metaphor" 235-47). ^ . . mi confessava e mi comunicava ne' tempi e col modo che comanda la tua Chiesa romana; e s'alcuna volta mi pareva d'aver tralasciato alcun peccato per negligenza o per vergogna, ch'io</page><page sequence="8">188 Walter Stephens audience, allowing Gonzaga to overhear a confession whose grammatical addressee is God: . . . io ti conosceva solo come una certa cagione de l'universo, la quale, amata e desiderata, tira a sé tutte le cose; e ti conosceva come un principio eterno e immobile di tutti i movimenti, e come signore che in universale provvede a la salute del mondo e di tutte le specie che da lui sono contenute. Ma dubitava poi oltra modo se tu avessi creato il mondo o se pur ab eterno egli da te dipendesse; dubitava se tu avessi dotato l'uomo d'anima immortale e se tu fossi disceso a vestirti d'umanità; e dubitava di molte cose che da questi fonti, quasi fiumi, derivavano. (Lettere 105. Ed. Mazzali) In other words, Tasso confesses to being an unwilling Neoplatonist: his belief system combines an Aristotelian conviction that God is an Unmoved Mover, hardly more personal than the force of gravity, with a Platonic (or rather Plotinian) desire to see the universe as a series of emanations or "processions" of the divine.16 Tasso found belief in the Catholic sacraments all but impossible, because to his rationalist mentality the initial doubt about God's mode of being proliferated with vertiginous rapidity and thoroughness: Percioché come poteva io fermamente credere ne i sacramenti, o ne l'autorità del tuo pontefice, o ne l'inferno, o nel purgatorio, se de l'incamazion del tuo Figliuolo e de l'immortalità de l'anima era dubbio? I secondi dubbi, nondimeno, non da proprie radici nascevano, ma da i primi [i.e., the doubts about God's nature], quasi rami, germogliavano: pur m'incresceva il dubitarne; e volentieri da si fatti pensieri avrei richiamato il mio intelletto, per se stesso curioso e vago de l'alte e sovrane investigazioni; e volentieri l'avrei acchetato a credere senza ripugnanza quanto di te crede e predica la santa Chiesa cattolica romana.17 (Lettere 105. Ed. Mazzali) The malady to which Tasso is confessing here is not melancholy but rationalism, or, as he expresses it repeatedly in this letter, the inability to aveva, d'avere in alcune cose di pochissima importanza vilmente operato, replicava la confessione, e molte volte la faceva generale di tutti gli errori miei. Nel manifestare nondimeno i miei dubbi al confessore, non gli manifestava con tanta forza ne le parole, con quanta mi si facevan sentire ne l'animo, percioché alcuna volta era vicino al non credere; non tanto per vergogna o per malizia, quanto per timoré ch'egli non mi volesse assolvere; e fra gli altri dubbi ch'io aveva, questo era il principale, che non mi sapeva risolvere se la mia fosse miscredenza o no, e s'io potessi o non potessi essere assoluto" (Lettere [Mazzali] 106). ' ^ See. Lettere (Guasti) 2.114: ". . . nel dialogo del Messaggiero la dottrina è platonica con qualche mistura di peripatetica, in quel modo ch'i platonici la ricevono." Quint 95-97, 238n. sees this letter as evidence of a "conversion experience," but there is no foundation for this interpretation, especially in light of the letter's anguished rhetoric. ^ See Schiesari 200-08 on the figure of the hydra.</page><page sequence="9">Tas so and the Witches 189 subordinate reason to faith. The confession to Gonzaga places an entirely different complexion on the public assertion that Tasso makes in the dedication of II messaggiero to Scipione's kinsman Vincenzo, the future Duke of Mantua: Egli è scritto secondo la dottrina de' Platonici, la quale in molte cose è diversa da la verità cristiana: laonde non devrebbe alcuno maravigliarsi ch'io abbia posti vari mezzi fra gli uomini e Dio, come posero non sol mold filosofi, ma san Bernardo medesimo, che chiamö gli angeli mediatori, benché santo Agostino dica ch'uno sia il mediatore; né ch'io in qualche parte non riprenda i giudîci de l'astrologia, i quali sono da lui in tutto riprovati e condannati; o ch'io ne la creazione de l'uomo abbia voluto seguir l'opinione di Platone, ripresa da santo Ambrosio, avegnaché, non volendo trattarne come teologo, non istimava sconvenevole lo scriverne platonicamente, e tutti gli altri modi mi parevano pill contrari a la vera teologia. Ma perché tutti i filosofi debbono ricercar la verità, quantunque non per la medesima strada, io, per questa ricercandone, da quella che è somma verità ho cercato di non molto allontanarmi. Vostra Altezza dunque il legga come opera d'uomo che scrive corne filosofo e crede come cristiano, e come taie vorrei che fosse veduto da gli altri. . . . (Dialoghi 4-5, ed. Mazzali) This apparently anodyne, somewhat pedantic-sounding litany of disclaimers conceals conceptual dynamite. As he often did, Tasso is here first of all disavowing any attempt to participate in the clerical monopoly on magisterium, or teaching about the faith. Rather than open himself to censure by presuming to speak as a theologian, he will strive merely to adumbrate the received truths of Catholic teaching, which he claims to accept unproblematically, by following the philosophical method that least conflicts with it, the Neoplatonic.18 Nevertheless, Tasso treats theology briefly, since he foresees Catholic censure of his cosmology and demonology. His mention of Saints Bernard, Augustine, and Ambrose in this context presumably circumscribes the differences between Christian and Neoplatonic theology, demonstrating their near-compatibility, and reminding us of the influence of Neoplatonic thought on patristic orthodoxy. But it actually does something far more disquieting in terms of sixteenth-century culture: it intimates that Tasso finds Neoplatonic doctrines of ontology and cosmology more comforting than those of la vera teologia. This hint is borne out by his subsequent discussion of witches in the context of ontology and cosmology. Tasso excuses himself for having placed "various mezzi between men and God." His mention of Augustine introduces what looks like a synonym of mezzi: although Bernard said that angels are mediatori between men and God, Augustine cautions that Christ is the only mediatore.19 Baldassarri 282-84; Stephens, "Metaphor" 238-41. " In a note to Tasso's Dialog hi (4n.), Mazzali traces these citations. The citation of Saint Bernard's sermon on angels (PL 183.447, 1-48) merely gives Scriptural authority for the assertion that God is served by millions of angels, and that angels facilitate his communication with</page><page sequence="10">190 Walter Stephens But there is a very important difference between the two terms, upon which hangs the dread that informs both Tasso's malaise and that of the inquisitors. The sense of mezzo is far more explicitly physical and scientific than that of mediatore. While mediatore refers to a function or activity, mezzo describes an ontological state. As Torquato's Messenger employs the term, mezzo has the technical sense of the mean or median element in a series, and it bolsters a view of the cosmos as complete, orderly, and sequential: Or passarô a la seconda prova, con la quale io intendo di conchiudere che siano i demoni e gli angioli, presa da l'ordine de l'universo che da Dio e da la natura sua ministra è stato osservato. Non suole, se ben tu ti ricordi, passar la natura da 1'uno estremo a l'altro senza alcun mezzo: laonde tra le specie inferiori e le superiori sono interposte quelle che participano de l'une e de l'altre. Cos! la natura va ascendendo da le cose sensibili a le intelligibili quasi per gradi. (Dialoghi 35, ed. Mazzali) That is, the universe must be hierarchical. Despite our inclinations to the contrary, we should regard this premise as pre-political, or at least para-political. As Lovejoy showed, hierarchy is important to pre-Darwinian cosmology for reasons that are, in logical terms, prior to and therefore more comprehensive than politics: epistemology, ontology, eschatology — in short, the rationalist's categories for the meaning of life. In this context, hierarchy is not yet necessary as a justification for social control or political power. Regardless of their attitude toward Neoplatonism, Tasso and his contemporaries felt the ultimate meaning of lack or incompletion in a cosmological context as the absence of a transition-point between matter and spirit. They feared that, without hierarchy, that is, ontological gradualism, the continuity and communicability between the human and the divine cannot be found or does not exist. But this fear was still too tremendous to be enunciated openly; Tasso's dialogue has to build toward it gradually, and without ever stressing it. Tasso expresses this fear more positively as a desire for a cosmos of salita, or stepwise ascent, rather than a cosmos of salto, or leap: ... se da l'uomo senza alcun mezzo si passasse a Dio, si salirebbe senza gradi, o non con tanti con quanti sin a lui [i.e., l'uomo] è ito ascendendo da l'una a l'altra specie: e sarebbe questa non salita, ma salto. . . (Dialoghi 35, ed. Mazzali)20 The near-pun is not frivolous: if there is no demonic world, then the cosmos is imperfect (literally incomplete), not for aesthetic or political reasons, but because there is a gap, an abyss, between God and humanity. The fear that we humanity. 20 See the analogous formulations in Lovejoy 60-61, 181, 184-85, 203, 217, 233, 235, 241.</page><page sequence="11">Tasso and the Witches 191 live in a universe of transcendence (of salto), rather than a universe of immanence (of salita) is the real terror behind the notion of an "incomplete" universe. The Neoplatonic conception of the cosmos as perfectus or complete has indeed already been discussed by the Messenger in a long disquisition on the difference between angels and daemons. Synthesizing Neoplatonic and Christian demonology, he defends a distinction between angels, who are absolutely spiritual, and daemons, who have a kind of body. This is not identical with a distinction between angels and devils (though the Messenger will use it as if it were). Daemons are not demons — or at least they were not until the Fathers of the Church got hold of them.21 Before Christianity redefined them, daemons could be good or evil, or, perhaps more precisely, morally neutral: it was their ontological status as mezzo that determined their mediatory function, not the quality of their volition. Plato, whose concept of the messenger gave Tasso the title for this dialogue, defined daemons as the mediators between the divine and the human worlds, because their essence was halfway between that of gods and that of humans.22 Tasso's system in the Messaggiero needs daemons because, unlike angels, daemons have a kind of body. The Messenger defines daemons in Aristotelian terms as "substances that are corporeal, rational, able to suffer pain, and immortal." Conversely, he says, angels are "/«corporeal, intellectual and immortal, and unable to suffer pain."23 Angels and daemons share the qualities of rationality and immortality, but they differ in that daemons have a body of some subtle substance like air, and thus can feel pain; since angels have no bodies, they are immune to pain. (Gabriel's body is thus truly fictive when he appears to Goffredo.) The Messenger will go on to explain that daemons' bodily substance is so subtle that human senses cannot normally perceive it. Yet, long before he becomes visible, the Messenger makes his body known through the sense of touch, and implies that he becomes visible by assuming a second body (11). Likewise, he teaches Torquato that the human soul and body are conjoined by means of an intermediate body: "difficilmente l'anima vostra, pura e semplice e 21 Tasso is implicitly reacting against, and probably drawing on, books 8 and 9 of Augustine's City of God, which redefines Neoplatonic daemons as devils. Some care is required to determine when Tasso is referring to demons (demdni) and when to daemons (dèmoni). I have seen no edition that attempts to make the distinction, though Tasso's overt use of Neoplatonism argues in favor of dèmoni being his normal intention. I shall use "daemon" and "daemonic" when ontology is at issue, especially the question of the daemonic body, "demon" and "demonic" only when referring to Christian devils. 22 Plato 47(Symposium 202E-203A). "Daemonic forces thus became participants in the cosmic drama of man versus god, almost as if the daemons were the relationships, personified, of man to god" (Fletcher 61). HT Tasso, Dialoghi 48, 56, cf. 37; ed. Mazzali. The definition is based on Apuleius's treatise on the daemon of Socrates, but Tasso could have had it from Augustine 262. Baldassarri wrongly sees Tasso as "indifferent" to the distinction between angels and daemons (276n.).</page><page sequence="12">192 Walter Stephens immortale, si potrebbe accompagnare con coteste miste e caduche membra terrene, s'ella co '1 mezzo d'un corpo più puro e più lieve e sottile non s'accompagnasse" (13). To understand the intimacy between Tasso's reasoning and the inquisitors' practice, we have to explore the boundary between cosmology and ontology. Torquato does not immediately accept the Messenger's notion of a necessary distinction between angels and daemons. Following in the Humanist tradition of dignitas hominis, he objects that daemons are ontologically superfluous. Humanity is the only necessary and logical link between the brute beasts and the angels, since humans have both a mortal body and an immortal soul. But the Messenger greets this distinction condescendingly: — Bene argomenti; nondimeno, si come l'anima de l'uomo è mezzo fra l'anima de' bruti e gli intelletti angelici, cosi anco, se l'uomo dovesse esser il perfetto mezzo tra l'una e l'altra natura, dovrebbe il suo corpo in parte al corpo de Ii animali e in parte a' corpi celesti assomigliarsi; ma essendo il corpo umano non men sottoposto a tutte le passioni e a tutti gli accidenti, né men corruttibile che sia quel de' bruti, ne seguita che si debba dare un corpo che fra '1 celeste e quel de' bruti sia con débita participazione interposto: e questo è quel de' demoni, il quale è acconcio a patire com'è il corpo de l'animale e de l'uomo, e incorruttibile corne il corpo celeste, perché mai non muoiano i demoni, quantunque alcuni abbian creduto che muoian dopo lunghissimi tempi. (Dialoghi 37, ed. Mazzali) Humanity mediates only the hierarchy of created souls. The concept of demonic corporeality is therefore necessary in order to mediate the transition between the celestial bodies, which are imperishable and impassible, and terrestrial bodies, including human, which are all perishable and passible. This in-between space of the imperishable and passible is the realm of the daemonic body. Since this dialogue mentions witches only in passing, it has had no effect on the historiography of witch-hunting. But its obsessive attention to the problem of the daemonic body explains the hidden motivation for persecuting women as witches. Tasso's argument can be made quite simple: if witches do not have sex with demons, then we have no guarantee that demons exist; thus, he implies, we have no guarantee that angels exist, and hence no guarantee of the existence of God. At first, Tasso's rehearsal of the witch-mythos seems deceptively perverse because of its exclusive concentration on sex: . . . que' demoni che malvagi sono detti da l'ufficio loro, con le donne in quella guisa si congiungono che voi uomini solete; e perch'essi non potrebbono per sé generare, gittano il seme d'alcun uomo nel ventre de la donna, ch'è di quelle che streghe sono da voi domandate: e da si fatti congiungimenti nascono i maghi, quale fu Merlino, che fu giudicato figliuolo del demonio. (Dialoghi 55-56, ed. Mazzali)</page><page sequence="13">Tasso and the Witches 193 This passage names the inquisitorial mythos that has given the whole dialogue its telos for nearly sixty pages: the assertion that witches were not only the apprentices but also the sexual slaves of Satan and other devils. Demonic copulation is the most bizarre aspect of inquisitorial witch-mythology, and it has been one of the most puzzling. But to understand the myth of demonic copulation is to begin answering both of the major questions about the witch hunt: how (in what manner) inquisitors believed what they professed, and why they targeted women. Tasso's distinction between angels and daemons provides the clue that explains why witches were predominantly conceptualized as women, for it explicates the corporeal basis of the witch's contact with the demonic world. Tasso could have read about demonic copulation in Malleus Maleficarum or any one of a dozen other manuals. The source is not important. What matters is how Tasso uses the concept of demonic copulation to guarantee the existence of God: he modifies a detail of inquisitorial demonology in order to make the system more logical. Inquisitors followed Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic doctors of the faith in claiming that angels and devils were both absolutely incorporeal, and could only fabricate fictive bodies by compacting air and vapors (the technical term was inspissation).24 Tasso evidently found this explanation inadequate to make demonic copulation possible. Thus he fell back on the Neoplatonic conception of the daemon's body as both subtle and proper (or intrinsic) so as to attenuate as far as possible the salto between spirit and flesh. In Tasso's system as in the inquisitors', both the daemon and the witch are less important for their spiritual qualities than for their physical, somatic ones. This appears in the deployment of one of Tasso's most significant keywords (congiungere) in the two passages that distinguish angels from daemons (Dialoghi 48-56, ed. Mazzali).25 The task of angels is to bind human nature to the divinity by acting as messengers — the etymological significance of the word angelos, and the inspiration for Tasso's title. But the function of daemons, or at least of maleficent demons, is to copulate (congiungersi) with witches in the same way that male humans copulate with other women. There is a symmetry here. Both angels and demons are agents of love. But whereas demons conjoin at the corporeal level, angels perform purely spiritual mediation or conjunction, precisely because, as Tasso's Messenger states, they love in a fashion very different from that of human males ("perch'amano in modo assai diverso da l'uomo" Dialoghi 56, ed. Mazzali). The implication of Tasso's reasoning is that if there are no witches, that is, no women who copulate with ^ "According to the scholastics, demons, like angels, were pure spirits, possessing no flesh or blood. They could, however, take on the appearance of a human or an animal body by mixing the air with various vapours from the Earth so as to create a non-corporeal or aerial body. This body, being composed of natural elements, did have a physical reality and it could perform certain bodily functions, such as dancing or the sexual act" (Levack 30). Cf. Krämer and Sprenger 21-31. For congiungere, see Stephens, "Saint Paul" 181-82.</page><page sequence="14">194 Walter Stephens demons, then we cannot prove the existence of the spirit-world. And indeed, the Messenger states this explicitly: E cominciando distender gli argomenti da gli effetti maravigliosi, se sono i maghi e le streghe e li spiritati, sono i demoni; ma di quelli non si puö dubitare ch'in ogni età non se ne siano ritrovati alcuni: dunque è irragionevole dubitare che si ritrovino i demoni. (Dialoghi 21, ed. Mazzali)26 What makes this passage simultaneously hideous and pathetic is its logical necessity within the cosmology that Tasso has been constructing. This search for the demonic (or daemonic) body is the symptom that connects Tasso's melancholy to the spiritual malaise that drove three centuries of witch-hunting in Western Europe.27 The single most significant indicator of the affinity between Tasso's Neoplatonic demonology and the inquisitors' Christian one is their agreement on the importance of the witch. Although none of them admits it fully, they all imply that, if we cannot prove that witches exist, then we cannot prove the existence of daemons. Thus, we cannot prove that we live in an immanent, providential universe, or that God intervenes at all in human affairs. At the limit of this train of reasoning lies the recognition that we can never prove that God even exists, as the Cambridge Platonist Henry More recognized a century after Tasso. In a prefatory letter to Joseph Glanvill's Sadducismus Triumphatus (1681) he declared that "the confession of Witches against their own lives [is a] palpable Evidence, [along with] the miraculous feats they perform, that there are bad Spirits, which will necessarily open a door to the belief that there are good ones, and lastly that there is a God" (Kors and Peters 299). Whether the superhuman bodies that copulate with witches are fictive or intrinsic, human knowledge of the divine requires some form of such copulation. The witch is quite literally the copula of the cosmos. The distortion of folk healing and sorcery by the inquisitors — that is, by the literate (and especially clerical) elite — has the same teleological thrust as "Jfï In this section, the Messenger is using a form of argument associated with astronomy, "saving the appearances." Just as retrograde planetary motion is the effect or "appearance" to be saved by positing epicycles, so the existence of witches, sorcerers and the possessed is the effect or appearance to be saved by positing daemons. (Note however that in both astronomy and demonology, "saving the appearances" would be more correctly termed "saving the theory," since the object is to protect the theory from disproof by observed phenomena.) The Messenger is preparing a homology that will emerge only at the climax of his argumentation: the contention that daemons "move" the bodies of witches just as angelic intelligences move the heavenly bodies. However, by deciding to adopt the astronomical mode of argumentation, Torquato's Messenger is tacitly admitting the remoteness of God, and God's inaccessibility to conclusive human proof. ^ Schiesari (199) reads the Messenger's body as "no more than a fictional representation of the subject" Tasso and an instantiation of castration-anxiety.</page><page sequence="15">Tasso and the Witches 195 the logic of Tasso's Messenger: toward demonic copulation as an ultimate proof of immanence. This ridiculous, degrading, and pathetic fiction epitomizes the profound difference between the inquisitorial witch-mythos and that of the illiterate masses. Folk culture depended on the notion of the witch's maleficium or evil spell. Left to themselves, the folk were clearly interested in social control, for they had two motivations for believing in maleficent magic. First, it explained disorder in everyday life, by making a visible human agent responsible for the mysterious death of cows, crops, babies or libido. Second, it justified the expulsion of troublesome, non-conforming persons from the midst of the community.28 The folk view of maleficium may have been essentially animistic at least part of the time; that is, spirits of some sort may have been involved. But those spirits were not originally defined as demons or devils. In contrast to witch-accusers among the populace, the inquisitors showed little concern for social control: allegations of harm caused by the defendants' maleficia were important to inquisitors almost solely as evidence of supposed contact with Satan. They defined this Satanic commerce as the basis of all maleficium. Historians of witch-hunting define the demonic pact — a formal agreement that bound over the witch's soul to the Devil in exchange for the means of working maleficia — as the core element of the inquisitorial witch mythos. Indeed, proof of actual maleficium was almost never required for conviction, whereas proof of a demonic pact always was. Furthermore, some inquisitors openly declared that if it could be proved a person had committed no maleficium, she should nonetheless die if she had confessed to a making pact with the Devil.29 As regards the overt legalistic foundation for acquiring conviction, historians are right to identify the demonic pact as absolutely determinant. Yet the core symptom of the pathology behind the witch-hunt was corporeal, not spiritual: the inquisitors' notion that witches regularly copulated with devils, including with Satan himself.30 For reasons that are undoubtedly complex, the inquisitorial mentality considered penetration and insemination as the ultimate experience of corporeal reality. Although the Devil's lack of a real body within Scholastic ontology should have been problematic, inquisitors maintained that both angels and devils could fabricate fictive bodies. Thus devils (though not angels) could have sex with women and even impregnate them with semen "stolen" from human males. This truly fictional body filled the gap that threatened to prove a cosmic order of transcendence and salto rather than 98 Rosen, Lamer, Macfarlane and Thomas. 90 Martin Lather opined that witches "should be burnt even if they did no harm, merely for making a pact with the Devil" while Benedict Carpzov in 1635 "maintained that even those who merely believed that they had been at the sabbat should be executed, for the belief implied the will" CTrevor-Roper 137, 159). By 1486 it was possible to claim that "it is common to all of them [witches] to practise carnal copulation with devils" (Kramer and Sprenger 99).</page><page sequence="16">196 Walter Stephens immanence and salita. A cui bono analysis reveals the entire scenario of demonic copulation as an obsession that could appeal only to the inquisitors, for women who confessed to it also "admitted" that the experience had been painful and unpleasant. The pain and joylessness of the Devil's sex, like the insipidity or inedibility of the food he offered, and the evanescence of his other rewards, was finally nothing more than a sop to the inquisitors' consciences, which would not allow them to predicate positive benefits of human contact with the Devil. Yet that contact was necessary, and in quantity, to the inquisitors' metaphysical well being. Inquisitors overtly conceptualized this copulation in the same way that peasants regarded maleficium as a fearsome invasion of chaos and disorder. But at a deeper level it served as a reassuring sign of the ultimate order, comprehensibility, and providentiality of the universe. Witch-hunting as legalized mass murder was thus primarily the expression of a cosmology, or rather, of a profound shift in cosmologies. As the witch-hunt progressed, other, more immediate and concrete evidence of corporeal contact between women and demons was required: prominent scars and birthmarks that could be explained as the Devil's "mark" or signature, moles and wens that could be identified as "witch's tits," whence a devil, incarnated in the form of a "familiar" pet, supposedly suckled blood from the witch. The final desperate stage of the witch-hunt saw inquisitors prosecuting witches for causing devils to possess innocent victims (as at Loudun and Salem). Thus the inquisitor witnessed a wedding of flesh and spirit before his own eyes, in a form of contact more intimate even than sex. But, as the Devil himself was to tell another hallucinating intellectual exactly three centuries after Torquato: "Spiritualists .. . think they're serving faith because devils show their little horns to them from the other world. 'This,' they say, 'is a material proof, so to speak, that the other world exists.' The other world and material proofs, la-di-da! And, after all, who knows whether proof of the devil is also a proof of God?" (Dostoevsky 636-37). Indeed, once witches were regularly charged with causing possession, the hunt soon collapsed.31 Once the inquisitor had witnessed the devil enflesh himself at human command, the demonic had reached its outer limit of tangibility. On the other side was literally nothing: Christians had to confront their unacknowledged skepticism, and either embrace it (as Sadducceeism, deism, etc.) or recast it as Christian skepticism, as some form of negative theology about a transcendent God. Tasso intuited the homology and interdependence between the witch's demonic copulation and the hypostatic union of the Incarnation. Demonology and Christianity are a perilous mix, as the inquisitors demonstrate; the crypto Platonic ontology behind any systematic Christian demonology threatens the uniqueness of Christ as both mezzo and mediatore. In comparison with a construct like the witch's demonic copulation, the doctrine of the Incarnation Klaits 111, 104. Among others, Krämer and Sprenger had anticipated this outbreak (128-34).</page><page sequence="17">Tasso and the Witches 197 still presents a universe of salto, rather than salita: the single hypostasis whereby humanity and divinity are conjoined in Christ as their sole and sufficient mean term (mezzo) seems abrupt and even crude.32 And it is very distant in history. Both Christianity and Neoplatonic demonology condemn Manichaeism and other dualistic religions for expressing the fear that God is inaccessible to creatures of flesh. Both attempt to bridge the gap or salto between flesh and spirit by positing a daemonic body that is a union of opposites, a spiritual body or embodied spirit. But as mean or mezzo the daemonic body betrays a yearning for the infinitely divisible: "Coming from the term that means 'to divide,' daemon implies an endless series of divisions of all important aspects of the world into separate elements for study and control" (Fletcher 59). The divisions can be comforting only insofar as they refute the very notion of division, by becoming infinitely gradated. Thus, even if it obscures its Neoplatonic assumptions, a systematic Christian demonology cannot avoid falling into dualism through the very exercise of gradualism, and thence attributing determinative importance to Satan. Demonology betrays the fear of God's inaccessibility, for if there are necessary ontological mean-terms between humanity and divinity, then without Satan there is no humanly understandable proof of God's existence. In this sense, demonology replaces Christ with Satan as the ultimate guarantor of God's existence and accessibility. Just as the Neoplatonic daemon displaced Man as the mezzo between angel and beast, so Satan displaces Christ as the mezzo between humanity and divinity, and the witch displaces the Blessed Virgin as the vessel of that mediation. Thus, paradoxically, the more systematic a Christian demonology, the less it can dare openly to assert the ultimate importance of Satan. On the moral plane, it must go on wrestling with the conundrums of theodicy, continually seeking to prove that God both permits and frustrates evil. Likewise, on the ontological plane it must construct the category of witches for proof of immanence; yet although this proof is indispensable, it must be treated with abhorrence and loathing, rather than reverence and gratitude. Tasso's misogyny cannot be denied, and that of the inquisitors was extreme; but in neither case was misogyny a simple hatred or fear of women. Instead, I suspect that it is the obverse of some more positive tendencies that Carolyn Bynum examined in Holy Feast, Holy Fast. It appears that the female body became the preferred medium for the demonstration of incarnational doctrines by the thirteenth century, and Bynum argues that Western Christianity not only . è necessario che tra Iddio e l'uomo si ponga alcun mezzo, o più tosto molti, percioché, se tra Iddio e l'uomo fosse un solo mezzo, una sola sarebbe la specie intelligibile; ma sono molti, percioché non debbono essere in minor numéro de le sensibili, ma più tosto in maggiore, conciosiacosa che le intelligibili non sono in tempo come le sensibili, ma in etemità, e l'eccelenza de l'etemità ricerca che in lei siano più specie e più perfette che nel tempo" (Dialoghi 35-36. Ed. Mazzali)</page><page sequence="18">198 Walter Stephens depreciated, but also honored women by assigning them a status as representatives of "the carnal condition" and of "the experience of fleshliness in its consummate form, femaleness." Male fascination with female mystics and martyrs made women's bodies vehicles of men's speech; men defined themselves through the flesh they evoked, in the case of hagiographers, or beheld and consecrated, in the case of the confessors who accompanied most living saints and acted as witnesses and praise-singers. . . . Bynum's point is that women speak through their own bodies, their own 'suffering and generativity,' rooted in biological metaphors like birthing and nursing, to which the female sex has a prior claim; female somatic presence abolishes the intermediary stage men occupy, which makes them need women to speak through, to think with. (Warner 16)33 Recall Tasso's Messenger's rejection of the Humanistic topos of dignitas hominis: the idea that Man — i.e., the idealized male — is the hinge of the universe. Taken in himself, the idealized male of the Humanist tradition is marginal, left outside the great chain of being, in a sense far different and far less comforting than the one the elder Pico intended when he made that same assertion. Dignitas hominis was intended to isolate Man in a positive sense as the microcosm; but by denying him a single, static essence like the ones assigned to women and daemons, the humanistic ideal of human dignity isolated the ideal male in a negative sense as well, cutting him off from the system of immanence. The male human alone cannot bridge the gap between brute flesh and angelic spirit.34 Such a bridge must be formed by the conjunction of woman — the fleshly body in its purest form, chemically speaking — and a daemonic body, which is simultaneously the subtlest form of corporeality and the lowest form of the suprahuman. Woman and daemon represent, in slightly different degrees, the most corporeal "isotope" of spirit. Thus one outlet of the male need to "speak through" and "think with" women's bodies was the inquisitors' ventriloquism, their quite literal speaking through and thinking with the bellies of women. Quoted from Warner 16. See also Rubin 168-69. One may certainly object that if women, especially witches, were being honored for their presumed more fleshly condition, such honor is not enviable. 34 Pico della Mirandola 3-8. The Messenger's is a profoundly anti-Humanist view of the universe: man is not Pico's chameleon; rather, the daemons are. But to the extent that both Humanists and witch-hunters equated femaleness with passivity and corporeality, the two views have an uneasy resemblance. Women cannot act out their transformation into something superhuman. They can only submit to the other possibility Pico envisioned — brutish degradation — by submitting to the sexual violence of daemons. But human males of the sort Pico envisioned do not fit into the system at all. Krämer and Sprenger theorize a distinction between female witches who fornicate with incubi and males who do so with succubi: ". . . it does not appear that men thus devilishly fornicate with the same full degree of culpability; for men, being by nature intellectually stronger than women, are more apt to abhor such practices" (164).</page><page sequence="19">'lasso and the Witches 199 For Tasso as for inquisitors, the ostensible imperative of witch-hunting, "Cherchez la femme," hid the deeper objective that drove the hunt: "Cherchez le diable." Tasso enunciated it in a kind of syllogism: "if witches, then daemons, then immanence, [then God]." This syllogism is half a palindrome; it is a rationalist's anagram of the fideist's syllogism, "God, thus immanence, hence demons, thus witches." Superficially, there is a great methodological difference between Tasso's approach to demonology and that of the inquisitors. Whereas Tasso used language to seek the invisible daemonic body, the inquisitors did so by breaking and burning the bodies of real human beings. But in fact, when they tortured witches, inquisitors were enacting Tasso's syllogism, attempting to prove it by experimentation: "if this is a witch, then a demon exists, thus immanence is possible, hence God may exist and be accessible. But — and this is a Scholastic 'but,' which means 'my point is proved' — this is a witch."35 By always extracting the same eyewitness account ("confession") of the Devil's immanence, the inquisitors were expressing the unconscious of their professed purpose. Their deep goal was not the elimination of demonic and Satanic activity, but the proof that it existed. Their conscious motto was Jesus' "Vade Satana" but its unconscious form was Faustus's "Veni, veni Mephastophile."36 This is the deepest sense in which the inquisitors were projecting their own psychology onto the witches. In reality inquisitors were performing the very crime of which they accused the witches: they were conjuring the presence of the Devil. While some witches supposedly used figurative bodies to give instructions to devils (by perforating and burning waxen dolls or desecrating the Eucharistie host), inquisitors in effect tried to summon devils by violating the bodies of real people. From a functionalist point of view, the witch's death ensured the finality and integrity of the inquisitor's projection, for it prevented her from retracting or emending the ontological demonstration they had composed together and committed to the authenticating notary's pen.37 Despite her prized status as the Devil's accuser, the witch had to be killed as his accomplice, ostensibly to atone for her sin in summoning him; but at an unconscious level she assumed and atoned for the inquisitor's sin, the invocation of Satan. The deep purpose of the witch-hunt was also unconscious for the simple reason that it was unacknowledged. There was only one question that the inquisitors' activity precluded them from asking out loud, and that was the only question that gave meaning to what they were doing. To paraphrase a riddle of or This is "the typical pattern of thinking of Western rationalism, the modus ponens: 'if p then q; but p: therefore q'" (Eco 27). Matthew 4.10; Marlowe 26 (5.29). ^ As many historians have documented, recantations were a serious problem, for once torture ended, many defendants tried to vindicate their own versions of events. Often they were tortured again or threatened with such penalties as being burned alive rather than strangled at the last moment if they did not withdraw their recantations.</page><page sequence="20">200 Walter Stephens Borges about riddles: "in an experiment whose ultimate purpose is to prove the existence of the Devil, what is the only forbidden question? Answer: 'Does the Devil exist?"'38 To my knowledge, no inquisitor ever enunciated this deep objective in any overt or systematic way. From the inquisitors' point of view, to admit they were seeking contact, however indirect, with Satan would have been to confess blasphemy and heresy, the same rationalist skepticism — ultimately an unwilling atheism — that plagued Tasso. To have done so would have been to admit that they were the real criminals of the "witch craze." To enunciate such doubt linguistically with any degree of safety seems to have called for special forms of immunity, which were unavailable to the clerical elite. One was madness, and Tasso was further protected by the physiological symptomology of melancholia. He reduced the institutional logic of witch hunting to a syllogism of devastating simplicity, which reveals how early modern Christianity, both Protestant and Catholic, had painted itself into an epistemological corner. The inquisitorial subculture of literate Western Christianity had been led by its most exquisite instruments and exercises to conclude — in its collective or institutional unconscious — that the existence of the witch was the only remaining guarantee of the existence of God. It was thus not superstition and credulity that led inquisitors to persecute witches, but the skepticism engendered by their exercise of reason and logic to test the very tenets of Christianity. As the mouthpiece of inquisitorial logic, Tasso's Messenger also spoke aloud its great unconscious premise, and illuminated the depths of an anguish that the Counter-Reformation orthodoxy of Gerusalemme liberata could not assuage.
