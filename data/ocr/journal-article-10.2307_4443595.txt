<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMALS WITHOUT PARENTS, by Marie M. Jenkins. 1970. Holiday House, New York. 198 p. $4.95. Jenkins' compilation of a great store of information about reproduction in protists and animals, much of it not previously widely published, is com- mendable. The title is a bit misleading, since few species of animals reproduce consistently or totally without some form of gametic fusion. The book ap- parently was written with readers 10 years old and older in mind, and primarily for those unacquainted with biology. Difficult terms have been held to a minimum. Teleology and anthropomorphism have been interwoven extensively. Al- though this last is not "wrong," it is less than scientifically precise. Some of the illustrations are poor; for example, the Volvox on page 34 is hardly recog- nizable. For the beginning biologist who wishes to gain accurate information, this is a gool source, though he should keep in mind the frequency of teleology and anthropomorphism. J.
