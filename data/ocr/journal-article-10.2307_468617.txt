<plain_text><page sequence="1">A re-Vision of Literature* Ihab Hassan Pretext "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, permit me to begin with a brief pretext." This is how this text once began. There were listeners then, spectators; now there are readers. What we need is.... But I should start the present text properly, with a few words about its origin, its theme, and its form. The text was intended as an address to the Midwest Modern Language Association, 1975. The topic of the plenary session was "Response to Vision: Judging the Value of Literary Content." What could that mean? I began to write, and later to rewrite, and what follows is a palimpsest, a language of discontinuous time. So much for the "origin." Now about my "theme": it is a plea for vision. Not for spectacle, not even for the denser participations of reading, but for something that is best in- voked by such words as imagination, vision. My plea must be tentative and roundabout. A full response to literary vision implies an ontology of litera- ture, and an ontology is what we now call into doubt. The very concept "Literature," and not simply literary history, forces upon us radical queries. Hence my inordinate concern with the re-vision of literature. Yet the pun on revision has become rather stale and weary: we revise everything and rarely see anything anew. Can this failure be due to the frames of our vision? This brings me to the "form" of this text: it is mildly paracritical. (There is no reason for alarm: I have no influence in the profession to corrupt the young.) Why paracritical? Consider for a moment this curious event we call "hearing an address," or "reading an article." Someone makes a claim on our attention, our time, our mortality-someone, including ourselves. The frame of this claim is often the same. Yet frames, we know, shape what we hear or see. Tilt the frame or crack it, and we perceive another thing; make it con- scious of itself as frame and the perception is different again. I do no more here than alter a little the semantic typography of my text, and so call atten- tion not only to the cultural problematic of frames (see Erving Goffman's Frame Analysis) but also to the current reflexive will of literature. Thus my discourse will follow a Text, interrupted by some Intertexts and Contexts, concluding with a Postext. And here ends my Pretext. *With appreciation to the Camargo Foundation, Cassis.</page><page sequence="2">128 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Context I We sit in Schloss Leopoldskron, in Salzburg; the rococo window opens on a large artificial pond. Suddenly there is a big plop, and rings begin toform on the green water: a fish. Sally, who is reading Emerson, quotes out loud: "The eye is the first circle; the horizon which it forms is the second; and throughout nature this primary figure is repeated without end. It is the highest emblem in the cipher of the world." Circles, frames, ciphers. I wonder where is thatfatfish now, that wasfor an instant at the center of the circumference. The rings ripple out, empty, with gravity. Text I begin my proper text, knowing that anticipations of further disruption may hinder this reading-or spectacle. We need to re-cognize the primacy of vision in the arts. Even a subvisionary critic, Hilton Kramer, exhorts us thus: "It is always a shock to be reminded that art is, after all, a spiritual enterprise. Our culture has developed in a way that makes it so much easier to think about art in terms of techniques or economics, as a game of personality cults and epochal 'break-throughs,' that its spiritual attributes tend to be, if not wholly denied, then discreetly consigned to the ineffable.... we seem to lack even the rudiments of a persuasive vocabulary."' Art, literature, as a spiritual force-that tattered Arnoldian doctrine is one we still esteem. Challenged many times, challenged by churchmen, moralists, aesthetes, and by critics as incongruous as T. S. Eliot and George Steiner, this prejudice of the spirit for art will not go away. Steiner's challenge is the more recent and harsh. We have heard the grisly parable of the concentration-camp Kommandant who loved to read Shake- speare, Goethe, and Rilke. But what do we mean by "read"? Steiner does not permit us to quibble or ask. "We do not know," he cries, "whether the study of the humanities, of the noblest that has been said and thought, can do very much to humanize."2 Indeed, we do not; and our ignorance only proves that literature remains an aspect of our freedom (Sartre). The great literary classics may or may not humanize; they certainly do not serve to condition or brainwash. Their "goodness" offers itself as a choice. Steiner may be a moralist who expects too much (and why not?) from art; but there are skeptics and aesthetes who expect too little. They remind us that art provides no substitute for ethics or religion. It may provide no substitute, yet for many, the moral imagination has been kept vital in bad times by the perverse powers of art. Surely our own spontaneous response to Kent State, Watergate, or My Lai was itself thickly mediated by our experience in litera- ture. Surely, such mediations quicken our values. Steven Marcus, director of the new National Humanities Center, seems to think otherwise. In a piece entitled "The Demoralized Humanists," he writes: "There is an undercurrent of expectation that the humanities are or should go into the business of</page><page sequence="3">A RE-VISION OF LITERATURE 129 creating values, new or old, for society."3 Professor Marcus prefers the task of "critical self-clarification." This preference accords with the cultural conser- vatism of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Yet "self-clarification" is no less a shibboleth-or an ideological stance. We choose one kind of clarity against another, and that assumes some value; moreover, we use clarification toward presumptive ends. If this does not make axiologists of us all, it may nonetheless expose the limits of our skeptical neutrality. The last is indeed cause for de-moralization. In brief, to the shocking question that George Steiner asks we have no answer. But the answer to the Kommandant may be George Steiner himself: man, through language and silence, pitted continuously against the Inhuman. The morality of this confrontation is perdurable, and also too simple. Can morality help us to know vision? I much doubt it. Our path to the visionary question will be curious-and it may suddenly stop before the question starts. Intertext I Franz Kafka to Rudolph Steiner: "My happiness, my abilities and every possibility of being useful in any way have always been in the literary field. And here I have, to be sure, experienced states (not many) which in my opinion correspond very closely to the clairvoyant states des- cribed by you, Herr Doktor, in which I completely dwelt in every idea, but also filled every idea, and in which I not only felt myself at my boundary, but at the boundary of the human in general."4 If vision is not always discovered in a humanistic ethic, neither is it redis- covered in "literary content." Content is what lurks in Pandora's box itself. Open the box and out burst all those dreadful dualisms-literature as poesis and/or mimesis (aletheia came later), coherence and/or correspondence, plea- sure and/or instruction, image and/or concept, mental event and/or physical object, presentational language and/or discursive statement, and finally sig- nifier and/or signified. I am not contemptuous of these dichotomies: they may be an aspect of the thinking mind, generated by the metalanguages of criticism rather than in the languages of literature itself. The dichotomies, so to speak, are the sound of only one hand clapping, while the other hand silently writes. Far from being a formalist in criticism, I still find the question of content troublesome in three ways at least. First, it can lead and yield too quickly to ideology, a subject I am happier to engage in other terms. Next, it tends to confine the relation of literature and reality to older philosophical modes (Realist, Idealist, Nominalist) or else to restate its own question, as Kaite Ham-</page><page sequence="4">130 NEW LITERARY HISTORY burger does when she says that "literature is of a different nature from reality precisely because the latter is its material."5 Last, the evaluation of content implies a theory of interpretation, and the hermeneutic range extends from E. D. Hirsch to Wolfgang Iser to Roland Barthes, from validity in intentional interpretation to the phenomenology of an implied reader to the scandalous pleasures ("atopiques") and duplicities of the text. Evaluating literary content may be troublesome; I would not call it trite. It may tempt us into ideology, ontology, or hermeneutics, and these are tempta- tions we should not always resist. My own evasion on this occasion is simply a choice: I have construed a genuine response to vision as an invitation first to re-vision literature and then to pre-vision a new theory of the imagination. For in the mansions of criticism, there are many divisions. Context II I sit in my study in Milwaukee; the walls are lined with books: The Unmediated Vision, The Visionary Company, The Field of Vision, The Tragic Vision, Beyond the Tragic Vision, The Classic Vision, The Vision Obscured, Vision and Response in Modern Fiction, Primal Vision, The Orphic Vision, Prelude to Vision, The Politics of Vision, The Armed Vision, Inventory (Butor). I sit in my study; it is almost a perfect cube. Or is it really, with so many dimensions of vision in its walls, a hypercube? In the fourth,fifth, or nth dimension, as in a hypercube, one may take away all the "contents" of a room, without disturbing anything. Are we ourselves memories of survivors in other rooms? (Doris Lessing) Obviously, the current revision of literature must proceed within the cul- tures of criticism itself. In America, it has been clear for some time that the exhaustion of the old New Criticism has left behind it a certain critical exhaus- tion. Quite possibly, the rise of popular culture as a matter of academic curios- ity may provide a certain stimulus to criticism. But those critics seeking a new theoretical foundation for their discourse-where shall they look? Can they turn to England, as they did in the time of Hulme or of Leavis? Nothing in England now compels theoretical attention; those current civilities of the critical mind finally will not do. Some do turn to Germany, finding in Luk;ics and Adorno, in Bloch and Benjamin, a neo-Marxist source of literary ideas, or finding in Hans-Georg Gadamer and Hans Robert Jauss masters of the new hermeneutics and Rezeptionsdiisthetik. But it is to France and again to France that American critics rush to learn about linguistics and semiotics, structuralism and phenomenology. Theirs is a dry but moveable feast, the largest since Stein, Hemingway, &amp; Co. descended upon Paris. One wonders, can Edward Wasiolek be right when he says: "We</page><page sequence="5">A RE-VISION OF LITERATURE 131 are a nation that is attached or condemned to scientism and the faith that the mind is an instrument for the analysis of given entities. Russian Formalism, if ever enough texts are adequately translated and if ever enough intelligent commentaries are produced, is likely to exercise a greater influence on American criticism than the French New Criticism"?6 I suspect that if we do turn to Russian Formalism, it will be only after we have sacked Gaul. The point is simple: nowhere is the revision of literature more advanced than in France. I say this with some qualms. For much as I admire French criticism, I want to put myself at a certain readable, a certain legible distance from its languages and its lacks. The languages have already turned into sesquipedalian cant; pick up any of our more ambitious quarterlies, and you will hear the poststructuralist chant. As for the lacks, they are those of signs dissolving perpetually into other signs, a metaphysics of absence (based on the disappearance of the "full subject"), an ideology of fracture, a system waver- ing sometimes between science and solipsism-in short, a brilliant unmaking of the modern mind. Let us attend for a while to some familiar voices of this unmaking, as they declare themselves in seven questioning (or questionable?) statements. Intertext II A. The Unmaking of Man. Claude I&amp;vi-Strauss: "I believe the ultimate goal of the human sciences to be not to constitute, but to dissolve man.... I am not blind to the fact that the verb 'dissolve' does not in any way imply (but even excludes) the destruction of the constituents of the body subjected to another body." Michel Foucault: "One thing in any case is certain: man is neither the oldest nor the most constant problem that has been posed for human knowledge .... As the archaeology of our thought easily shows, man is an invention of recent date. And one perhaps nearing its end."8 B. The Unmaking of Literature. Roland Barthes: "All these endeavors may someday permit us to define our century ... as the century of the question What is Literature? (Sartre answered it from outside, which gives him an ambiguous literary posi- tion.) And precisely because this interrogation is conducted not from outside but within literature itself... it follows that our literature has been for a hundred years a dangerous game with its own death, in other words a way of experiencing, of living that death....".</page><page sequence="6">132 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Tzvetan Todorov: "We must first cast a doubt upon the legitimacy of literature; neither the mere existence of the term, nor the fact that a whole university system is based upon it, can of itself justify its ac- ceptance."10 C. The Unmaking of the Discrete Author, Reader, and Text. Roland Barthes: "In France, Mallarme was doubtless the first to see and foresee in its full extent the necessity of substituting language itself for the man who hitherto was supposed to own it.... The absence of the Au- thor... is not only a historical fact or an act of writing: it utterly trans- forms the modern text (... the text is henceforth written and read so that in it, on every level, the Author absents himself).""1 Jacques Ehrmann: "The presence of a reader is no more explicit nor implied than is that of an author. This presence is just as indeterminate because these 'texts' are not addressed to any particular public.... Since the one who has assembled the 'texts' has a minimal control over how they are read, everything happens between the lines, in the interval between the words, in the whiteness that separates the 'texts'... in all that, knowingly, has remained silent and that depends upon the user.... In this manner the 'text' loses the sacred character which in our culture we have been pleased to confer upon it."12 D. The Unmaking of the Book. Roland Barthes: "... any upset an author imposes on the typographic norms of a work constitutes an essential disturbance: to deploy isolated words on a page, to mix italic, roman, and capital letters... to break the material thread of the sentence by disparate paragraphs, to make a word equal in importance to a sentence--all these liberties contribute in short to the very destruction of the Book .... .""3 Philippe Sollers: "In our civilization the book was originally written lan- guage. Then it became printed writing. Perhaps it is in the process, and has been for a long time, of assuming a totally different significance which poses the real, misunderstood question of writing, of which the written volume would be only a limited particular case.""4 E. The Unmaking of Genres (including Criticism). Philippe Sollers: "On this level the distinctions between 'literary genres' destroy themselves. They are generally maintained only by a convention which permits falsified limits.... But we should not let our society</page><page sequence="7">A RE-VISION OF LITERATURE 133 dictate the definition of literary activity any more than our artificial roles as producers and consumers.""5 Jacques Ehrmann: "In fact, if literary material rightfully extends to all linguistic signs, it is logical to think that every distinction between literary language, ordinary language, and critical language is also right- fully abolished because no inherent difference separates them essen- tially. The opposition between language and metalanguage would be obliterated thereby from the start. It would yield to a critical unfolding of signs stretching out infinitely and indefinitely, all in the same plane, without any priority being attributed to a particular one...."" F. The Self-Unmaking of Semiotics. Julia Kristeva: "Semiotics cannot develop except as a critique of semio- tics. ... Research in semiotics remains a process that discovers nothing at the end of its search but its own ideological moves, so as to recognize them, to deny them, to start again."17 G. A Coda to Unmakings. Jean-Francois Lyotard: "Oh that exquisite polysemy, little tear of safe thinkers [bien pensants], small carping disorder, sugared deconstruction. Do not hope to gather the libidinal in those nets. A final point, understood a thousand times: semiology is nihilism."s8 Terrorism, travesty, or trivia? These enunciations and denunciations do not represent a coherent move- ment or system. They are sometimes contradictory and often provisional; and indeed, later representatives of Tel Quel can be as critical of earlier struc- turalist theories as they are of traditional literary ideologies. As Barthes him- self says, Structuralist Man is not the last word of time; a new language will arise (has arisen?) that will speak him in turn. Yet we cannot dismiss him without at least some struggle; he must be qualified in our consciousness before he is "overcome." His ambition, while it lasted, was after all a noble one: "Homo significans," his structures were simulacra of "intellect added to object."'9 The structuralist activity, however, may itself be part of a larger immanence of our time. In searching for an epitome of that activity, I have used the simple Anglo-Saxon word "unmaking" (anglo-saxon, by the way, as the French insist on calling Beowulf, Muhammed Ali, the Godfather, and myself). Yet I could have used trendier terms: for instance, deconstruction, decentering, dissemination, dispersion, difference, discontinuity, demystification, decrea- tion, disappearance, etc. All of these terms of unmaking share something with</page><page sequence="8">134 NEW LITERARY HISTORY the concept of silence, variously articulated by George Steiner, Susan Sontag, and myself; and they also evoke Harold Rosenberg's "de-definition" of art. But they go further, suggesting a radical reorganization in our modes of knowledge, in the discourse by which we apprehend our very being- suggesting what Michel Foucault would call a postmodern ipistimd. In The Order of Things, Foucault distinguishes among three 6pistemes, or sovereign codes, which organize culture and consciousness in the preclassical, classical (roughly the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries), and modern periods. In the latter, the failure of the heroic Mallarmean task of transform- ing all language into the ultimate Word confirmed "the disappearance of Discourse." But if language now returns in some postmodern era, with the shudder of new gods, if it returns, Foucault asks, "with greater and greater insistence in a unity that we ought to think but cannot as yet do so, is this not the sign that the whole of this [modern] configuration is now about to topple, and that man is in the process of perishing as the being of language continues to shine ever brighter upon our horizon? Since man was constituted at a time when language was doomed to dispersion, will he not be dispersed when language regains its unity?"20 Foucault, of course, means the "dispersion" of man as a particular concept, as a constellation of images within a particular epist6mb; but that in itself is no minor matter. The "dispersion" of man into a universal language (like Teilhard de Chardin's "no6sphere"?) or a universal desire would leave none of our categories, least of all "literary content," intact. Diversion: I say desire because that is also the term used by Gilles Deleuze and F61ix Guattari in their stunning revision of psychoanalysis, L'Anti-Oedipe. The au- thors "disperse" man, not into language but into the uncoded flux of a "machine desirante," a universal desiring machine. These "schizo-analysts," as they call themselves, call for a liberation of instincts, a recognition of desire as the source of all productivity-a liberation, once again, in which our current concept of man dissolves. "Never," they say, "can we go too far in the deter- ritorialization, the uncoding of fluxes. For the new earth.., lies neither be- hind nor before us; it coincides with the realization of a desiring prod- uctivity ... ."21 Diversion Ends. But Foucault and Deleuze are not alone. Jacques Derrida seems most at ease with "deconstructed" realities. As a philosopher, he does not flinch from saying, "I am trying, precisely, to put myself at a point so that I do not know any longer where I am going."22 Following through with the "decentering" of thought begun by Nietzsche's critique of metaphysics, Derrida refuses "totali- zation," refuses transcendental meaning within any given system, affirming</page><page sequence="9">A RE-VISION OF LITERATURE 135 instead the joyous play of a world without "truth," without "origin," a world offered continually to our interpretations and our deconstructions, our ab- sences.23 In his philosophical epos on writing, De la grammatologie, Derrida even hints that a future "meta-rationality" and "meta-scientificity" may sur- pass "in the same and single gesture, man, science, and the line [of the book.]"24 A radical reorganization in our modes of knowledge, in the discourse by which we apprehend our being, is indeed what the French structuralist and poststructuralist activity insinuates into our midst-a re-vision of the Human even more than of Literature. The reaction of American critics to the situa- tion is often uncertain, and sometimes downright queasy. Our tradition, after all, is pragmatic, and we are rightly skeptical of the eccentricities and ethnocentricities of French intellectual life. Still, we yearn more than ever for vindication of the humanities in an age of technology, yearn especially for a bright new theory of literature. French theories, however, raise more ques- tions about our business than they are willing to answer. Some critics attempt to neutralize or domesticate these questions, and so are able to pursue their business quite as usual. (Some, more au courant, "redouble" their "utterances" to "constitute" their "enunciations" by "liberating its signifiers"-which act, of course, both "diachronically" and "synchronically"-then proceed to "de- center" a "text" here, "deconstruct" an "epistemb" there, "demystify" an ideology elsewhere, while "adequating" the "textuality" of the whole through scrupulous observation of both its "paradigmatic" and "syntagmatic" "codes"-in short, they "disseminate" the impression of a noisy "absence," perhaps as I myself have done.) Others, still, attempt to provide a searching, rigorous, and sympathetic critique of structuralism; already, we have, among others, the works of Richard Macksey, Eugenio Donato, Paul de Man, Geof- frey Hartman, Leo Bersani, Fredric Jameson, Edward Said, Robert Scholes, and Jonathan Culler, and the list is quickly growing. As for myself, I want to explore a different way. Context III In my original address, I included here two blank pages, with a note reading: "Improvise orally on the aporias of this critical moment. Do so in two blank pages, i.e., four voice minutes." But in this text for readers rather than spectators, the improvisa- tions cannot be mainly my own. Still, if I were to impersonate a reader, rather than the writer I am impersonating, these would be among the topics I would choose for random queries: -The erotics of critical dedications. Some critics dedicate their works to real or symbolic Parents (the past), some to Children (the future), others to Siblings (the present). Some dedicate to Male figures and others to Female. There are critics, for instance, who tend to dedicate to Fathers and Brothers, others to Mothers, others still to Wives-very rarely to Mothers and Wives. Then there are those who dedicate to a whole Family. A few</page><page sequence="10">136 NEW LITERARY HISTORY critics dedicate to No One and fewer still to Every One. On the whole, dedications to the Anima seem underrepresented in the world of criticism, as are dedications to Artists. Is there an erotics of critical dedications? Why not? How can the emblem of a critic's love be irrelevant to his work? -Media and the illusion of a paradigm. In the history of science, Thomas S. Kuhn argues, there are paradigms of knowledge and innovation. Lacking such a paradigm, the humanities create "schools" of thought, which are then promptly assumed to be paradigms of knowledge. In Paris, New Haven, or Baltimore, critics and philosophers converge, giving intellectual density to their enterprise. Friendships and rivalries weave themselves into the epistemological fabric of discourse. This has always been so. But schools nowadays, whether of art or of criticism, become media even before they harden into ideology. What is the role of media, both public and covert, in the currentformation of criticism?. Do authors, critics, and readers respond to images they have of one another rather than to texts? And what is wrong with "images"? Are they like cliches, too charged with simple and insistent human needs, and so finally more transparent than texts? -Academic depression and the critical spirit. The topic is sordid; everyone knows our troubles. Ebbing funds, falling enrollments, shrinking jobs, wobbling tenures. The humanities, in general, dispirited. In these circumstances, how much error and/or innovation can our disciplines permit? True, in a moment of exigency, we can will to renew-better still, to reinvent-"quality"; and we can learn to do without many frills. But among the youngest professors, how many will accept intellectual risk? More interestingly: is there a critical theory that satisfied the needs of an ungenerous moment better than another? What is there in both semiotics and neo-Marxism that constricts our vision of the human? Or is all literary theory profoundly anti-heroic? But enough of these animadversions. Myself, I said, I would like to explore another way. I am not certain yet where it may lead. I hope that it will lead toward Imagination, and perhaps by an incommodious "vicus of recircula- tion" bring us face to face with Vision once again. How? The structuralist adventure, as it is sometimes jauntily called, has accom- plished a major revision of our literary thought; but it may have also taken us wrongly in certain directions, or taken us too far. Here are five points of personal judgment: a. The structuralist metaphysic of absence and its ideology of fracture refuse holism almost fanatically. But I want to recover my metaphoric sense of wholes. The difference between Norman O. Brown and Gilles Deleuze (who fails to acknowledge Brown) is precisely this: Brown knows that open is broken and fractured is free, but knows also that reality is one (see Love's Body). Subtle materialists, the French critics only disconnect.</page><page sequence="11">A RE-VISION OF LITERATURE 137 Opposed to ontological bad faith, they cultivate an ontological brittleness. Erotically, the Platonic apple must remain split. b. The structuralist concept of literature is, as Richard Schechner has noted, entirely implosive. Everything collapses inwards on language itself, on structures within/without structures. But I long for a concept of literature that is also explosive: outwards into gesture and performance, outwards into action, responsive to change. Is language really everything? (See Jameson's The Prison-House of Language.) There is a loquacity in struc- turalism that I find, finally, disagreeable. c. The structuralist temper requires too great a depersonalization of the writing/speaking subject. Writing becomes plagiarism: speaking be- comes quoting. Meanwhile, we do write, we do speak. I realize that the problematic of the "subject" is exceedingly complex (from Sartre's Critique de la raison dialectique [ 1960] and Levi-Strauss' La Pensee sauvage [ 1962], the controversy continues through to Kristeva's La Rdvolution du langage podtique [1974]). Yet I know that I myself must articulate my historical voice as well as silence it, lose my life and find it. I cannot stand forever beside myself. d. The style of many structuralists fascinates at first, and then-begins to repel? Consider the oblique and difficult styles of LUvi-Strauss, Barthes, Derrida, Foucault, Kristeva, Deleuze, Serres. But what does "dif- ficult" mean here? Hegel, Heidegger, and Husserl are often more dif- ficult to read (see Hegel's notorious Phenomenology). Is it because the struc- turalists rightly transgress disciplines-they are not only philosophers or anthropologists or critics-and so must transgress certain received categories of "clarity"? Is it because of their deep sympathy for what the bourgeoisie calls "perversity"? Or is it because, having banished the "sub- ject" from their epistemology, the subject returns to assert his presence in idiosyncratic styles, in complex verbal ceremonies that pretend to shun the vulgarities of the signified? And what of my own verbal ceremonies? e. The structuralist activity, when all is said and done, does not suffi- ciently enhance the meaning, experience, force, value, pleasure of par- ticular literary texts, enhance what draws me to literature or quickens me to it. For Barthes, pleasure is crucial, though it implies a process of coding and uncoding, making and unmaking, recuperation and loss-finally of "fading"-a process that is not central to my own temper (see Le Plaisir du texte). This touches on that most elusive of questions: modern boredom. Diversion: Jonathan Culler makes some astute remarks on pleasure and boredom in structuralism. Still, I remain skeptical when he says: "A semiological criticism should succeed in reducing the possibilities of boredom by teaching one to find challenges and peculiarities in works which the perspective of pleasure alone would make boring."25</page><page sequence="12">138 NEW LITERARY HISTORY The question of boredom is more general; it applies to much contemporary art: the compositions of John Cage, the films of Andy Warhol or Michael Snow, the books of Philippe Sollers or even Alain Robbe-Grillet. After hear- ing Jean-Franiois Lyotard speak brilliantly on ennuie and its contribution to "le corps inhumain," I wrote him a brief note: "I suspect we need a theory of ennuie. How are we to distinguish in the postmodern arts between an alienat- ing 'boredom' (Marx), and another 'boredom' (Baudelaire) conducive to a new type of consciousness, making traditional patterns of expectations obso- lete? There is also, Om, Om, Om .... " Diversion Ends These critical points, no doubt, appear too personal (the mot injuste here is "naive") to sustain a genuine critique, and they lump too many writers to- gether; but they mark for me a virtual arc, passing through structuralism, leading out. The shift in taste, in need, from a literature of commitment (Sartre/Camus) to a literature of abstraction (Robbe-Grillet/Sollers) must itself shift again. As Barthes says: "I am tempted to see in their alternation that entirely formal phenomenon, the rotation of possibilities, which precisely defines Fashion: an exhaustion of a language and a shift to the antinomic language ...."-26 Indubitably, Barthes is the critical genius of our age. But a shift to what? He does not say. Intertext III "Our Tiresias symbol seems to settle once and for all the question of the truth. Truth is on the side of Tiresias and of that interpretation in depth which turns the tables on a former interpreter. Are we so sure that this is the end of the road?... The blind prophet may well take such pride in having uncovered the illusions of his fellowmen, the demystificator may be so satisfied with his demystification that he, himself, may fall, ulti- mately, into an illusion almost identical to that of his adversary. At this point, everything Oedipus says of Tiresias will become as true as Tire- sias's interpretation of Oedipus. ... Tiresias will think he incarnates the truth and he will abandon himself to oracular vaticinations. He, too, will believe that all riddles are solved, that all pitfalls are in the past. That is why Tiresias, too, can be obtuse. Having read the signs of others, at least up to a point, he neglects his own, which are beckoning him, more ur- gently, more desperately than ever."27 Again: a shift to what? After fracture, what threshold? A shift, I would propose, to a renewed concern with Imagination and its</page><page sequence="13">A RE-VISION OF LITERATURE 139 implications in the active life. Is Imagination the teleological organ of human evolution, predicting, guiding, fulfilling change? Can Imagination take re- generative power (that slogan of 1968 still haunts the mind)? What are all the manifestations of Imagination, of which our verbal languages are only a part? In short, can we re-vision the Imagination under every aspect-for instance, alphabetically? Action Biology Class Consciousness Dream Eroticism Futurology Genius (or Gardens or Ghosts or Glamour or Gluttony) History (or Hallucinogenics) Insanity Jealousy (or Jactitation or Juvenescence) Knowledge Languages Myth (or Mysticism) Necromancy (or Neurasthenia) Ontology (or Oenology) Pleasure (or Perception or Play or Politics) Quests (or Quackery) Ritual Science Time (or Teaching or Telepathy or Transvestitism) Utopia Vision War Xenophilia Yoga Zeugma (or Zaniness or Zola) I admit it: this list sounds less like a prolegomenon to a theory of the Imagina- tion than random notations for an encyclopedia retrieved from Borges' waste- basket. My crude intent, however, was to put forth a crucial question: if the Imagination is indeed constitutive of our mental, our cultural, perhaps even our organic life, does it not devolve upon humanists to explore that supreme fictive power-explore it, for the time being, not under the aegis of a single method or semiotic theory, but in all its duplicity and multiplicity? Structuralism, of course, does not offer us a theory of the Imagination: behind all the dissolving structures, there is only an enigmatic melody. Nor does Existential Phenomenology offer us an adequate theory: with Imagina- tion there is a kind of enriched negative perception. Nor does Marxism really, despite its most brilliant insights into culture and history. Nor does Bergso- nian Vitalism, which implicates Imagination too heavily in memory. Since Kant and Coleridge, since Romantic philosophy and poetry, only the Sur-</page><page sequence="14">140 NEW LITERARY HISTORY realists attempted to theorize about the Imagination and to articulate its mys- tery. But though Surrealism retains a privileged position (the famous quarrel of Andre Breton and Roger Caillois over Mexican jumping beans still lives on in France), its repugnance for science inhibits its own theory. Context IV I sit in Cassis, reading Caillois' La Pieuvre. In a certain slant of sun the Mediterranean is a hard, blue mirror, giving nothing of itself. I wonder how lightflows through the octopus' outrageous eye. Imagination and observation, fancy and fact, mingle in our vision of certain crea- tures, Caillois says: the narwhal, for instance, the praying mantis, the spider, the lion, the bat, the peacock, the serpent, the horse--and the octopus. Throughout history, the octopus has acquired within the imbrications of our fantasy certain qualities: it was considered thieving, adaptable, shy, self-devouring, clownish, hoarding, and very often lascivious. But not until the Romantic age-with Michelet, Lautriamont, Jules Verne, and especially Victor Hugo--did the octopus become malignant and horrific. It became, in Romantic myth, a figure of the Void. With countless tentacles and suckers, the octopus absorbed the human Self into its viscous maw, fixing the entire process with huge, silken eye. The conclusion of Caillois is nearly as startling. We deceive ourselves, he argues, in thinking that the Imagination obeys only its own needs, evolves only according to its unique structures. True as this may be on a certain level, on another level, the Imagina- tion is "contiguous" with Nature, an extension thereof. "Substances and dreams," Caillois writes, 'follow distant but Jnalogous itineraries.... I hazard to say that the same 'innervation' traverses their unitary field....2" 2Yet in this unitary field of existence, figments of the Imagination compete, as do organisms and even species. Only those figments that 'justify" themselves (Caillois speaks of "une imagination juste")justify themselves in an evolving universe, take hold-precisely because "complex and disconcerting correspondences" seem to make that universe just. 29 Sitting in Cassis, reading Caillois, I suddenly.smell garlic and saffron in the air. Is Sally preparing a bouillabaise? If so, I and some small octopus may soon meet. Another "correspondence"? Or is correspondence simply a metaphor? Simply? And of what? In skepticism, I bite my tongue. Intertext IV The poet Elizabeth Sewell says: "Human thought is not merely meta- phoric in operation. Itself forms one term of a metaphor. The other term may consist of the cosmic universe....",30 The scientistJean Piaget says it in a different way: "Languages are not in the habit of forecasting the events they describe; rather, it is a correspon-</page><page sequence="15">A RE-VISION OF LITERATURE 141 dence... a harmony, then, between... the human being as body and mind-and the innumerable operators in nature-physical objects at their several levels. Here we have remarkable proof of that pre- established harmony among windowless monads of which Leibniz dreamt... .", Once more, I return to my text, trying to comprehend Sewell and Piaget. Do both secretly invoke an ancient doctrine of correspondence between mind and matter? Of course, Piaget, who is mainly, if not uniquely, concerned with the languages of science, is easier to understand. After all, Albert Einstein, sitting alone in a room with a blackboard, wrote E = mc2; and decades later an explosion annihilated Hiroshima. After all, Paul Dirac predicted the existence of the positron years before it was found in cosmic ray experiments and calculated the exact weight of the monopole four decades before it was "cap- tured" (perhaps) over Sioux City, Iowa. But how are we to understand the mystic metaphor of Elizabeth Sewell? Should we refer it to that tradition of language and gnosis about which George Steiner writes so marvelously in his book, After Babel-a tradition of the Logos, or Lingua Mundi, or Ur-Sprache, or Word of God, which variously includes Pythagoreans, Kabbalists, and Pietists, includes Meister Eckhart, Paracelsus, Kepler, Jacob B6hme, and Angelus Silesius, includes even, with complex qualifications, Leibniz, Hamann, Vico, Goethe, the Romantics, and on to Kafka, Benjamin, and Borges? Though Steiner himself leans to the "monadist" rather than the "universalist" view of language, he admits: "The habits of feeling shown in these occult semantics are remote and often bizarre. But at several points, linguistic gnosis touches on decisive issues of a rational theory of language and of translation."32 Or should we understand Elizabeth Sewell's "human metaphor" in the postmodern context? I have argued elsewhere that Imagination and Science, Myth and Technology, Earth and Sky, begin to converge in a new gnosticism-by which I mean that tendency of Mind to dematerialize reality, to gather more and more mind in itself, to turn nature into culture, culture into language, language into im-mediate consciousness. This very tendency of Mind may lead us to an enlarged conception of Imagination. Unfortunately, I have no leisure here (and perhaps finally no capacity) to offer a full theory of that enlarged apprehension which I want to call Imagi- nation. In an antic and alphabetical moment, I have tried to suggest the comprehensive character of that faculty. I should like further to suggest a focus of practical concerns-before we all dissolve into a gnostic light. These concerns I offer not antically but a little too baldly: First, concerning history. From Orphic to Cybernetic mysteries, from Plato to Hegel in philosophy, and in literature from Romantics to Postmodernists, a certain idea of Mind is implicit. What concept of Imagination emerges from that implicitness? For instance, when H61derlin asserts that man dwells poeti- cally upon the earth and when Norman O. Brown avers a century later that everything is only a metaphor-what history of poesis do these writers, chosen at random, invoke?</page><page sequence="16">142 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Second, concerning a general theory of fictions. Will a theory of Imagina- tion be only a special case of a vast unified theory of fictions, more com- prehensive than Vaihinger's "philosophy of as if," Husserl's phenomenology, Heidegger's later metaphysics of poetry? Will its starting point be Nietzsche's conviction that whatever is thought must certainly be a fiction? Or, rather, will it depend on further breakthroughs in neurology and brain research? Third, concerning change. Can certain literary works, ranging from ideol- ogy and utopia to science fiction and visionary poetry, be considered as verbal models of change, myths of metamorphosis? Do they exert a constant pres- sure on the present? If so, what do these models assume about the relation of Imagination to Power? Can we anticipate a stage, as Marcuse does, "where society's capacity to produce may be akin to the creative capacity of art, and the construction of the world of art akin to the reconstruction of the real world-union of liberating art and liberating technology?"33 Fourth, concerning the future. Blake believed that everything which exists today was imagined long ago. What does this assume about Imagination and Time-that is, about Prophecy? The cognate question concerns the meaning of optative and future tenses in languages. Why are the "shapes of time" preserved in our grammars? "Future tenses," Steiner says, "are an example... of the more general framework of non- and counter-factuality. They are a part of the capacity of language for the fictional and illustrate the absolutely central power of the human word to go beyond and against 'that which is the case.' "34 But all four concerns may still be too abstract for our daily business, as we exchange in class our ideas and our lives with the young. I remember arguing some years ago, in an essay called "Fiction and Future,""3 that the future may be considered a fiction and fiction considered a maker of futures; but I only began to understand what I could have meant when I finished teaching a course entitled "The Literature of the Future." Once again, there is no time to speak here of pedagogic perplexities in an age of literary revisions and eco- nomic constraints. Yet I do hope that when a new theory of Imagination comes forth to take hold of our intellectual energies, it will not be so remote as to ignore our familiar actions. In-forming our languages and metaphysical passions, can it also re-form our day? Postext Every ending is a little death, which makes space for another beginning, another death. (Death has been the broken song in this text, and the first person a coarser cry. Death and Self, instead of abstract deconstructions, can also remind us of our wall-less home in reality.) And so I must conclude, must try to connect, to disconnect, to make new connections of disconnec- tions. Is that also a function of the Imagination, which acknowledges absence, respects fracture-and always passes through new thresholds?</page><page sequence="17">A RE-VISION OF LITERATURE 143 There is a parable about this imaginary function in an essay by Owen Barfield. The essay begins with that profound dialogue between the God Krishna and the hero Arjuna which is the heart of the Bhagavad-Gita, and moves quickly through three millennia of history. The Imagination is the faculty that connects; passing through impassable thresholds, it constitutes our existence. The thresholds, for instance, separate Self and Not-Self (the Gita), Mind and Matter (Descartes), the Knowable and the Unknowable (Kant), the Conscious and the Unconscious (Freud). The Imagination passes through these thresholds, among many others, without abolishing them; for only thus can it sustain its life and ours. Sustain and expand. "Then it is," Barfield writes, "that the threshold becomes like Aladdin's ring, yielding new meanings for old and giving birth to a future that has originated in present creativity instead of being a helpless copy of the outwardly ob- served forms of the past."36 The Imagination of thresholds, of correspondences across thresholds: this is what Barfield wants to call "inspiration," what Coleridge called the "philosophical imagination," what Blake meant by "twofold vision." Twofold or fourfold, what matters the number? We are moving toward the visionary realm: visionary but not altogether mystical, not idle or insubstantial, but capable, self-creative, generous as love, binding as gravity. We are moving toward the visionary realm-are we moving, too, toward a point where Im- agination and Spirit meet? Emanuel Swedenborg spoke of the spiritual thus: "although it is in man, man is nevertheless able by means of it to be present as it were elsewhere, in any place however remote.... The Human is the inmost in every created thing [my italics]."37 "The Human is the inmost in every created thing." Is this the tedious anthropomorphism, anthropocentrism, of our race speaking out once again? Or is the Human some aboriginal principle, toward which all theories of Imagination must finally tend? It behooves humanists to wonder, and post- humanists too. A re-vision of literature may give this wonderment an in- tellectual shape, and yet preserve the wonder. Beyond fracture-what other thresholds?
