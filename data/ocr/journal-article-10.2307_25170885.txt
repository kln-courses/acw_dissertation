<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BIRTH OF MODERN SCIENCE OUT OF THE 'EUROPEAN MIRACLE' Freedom as a Condition of Economic Success and Scientific Progress GERARD RADNITZKY SUMMARY. To understand the present situation we must know something about its history. The 'Rise of the West', which grew out of the 'European Miracle', is a special case of cultural evolution. The development of science is an important element in this process. Cultural evolution went hand in hand with biological evolution. Evolutionary epistemology illuminates the achievements and the evolution of cognitive sensory apparatus of various species. Man's cognitive sensory apparatus is adapted to the 'mesocosmos', the world of medium-sized dimensions. The biological structures constitute the hardware of the cognitive sensory apparatus, while certain expectations and theories, which are ontogenetically apriori, constitute the corresponding system software. A distinction is introduced between 'primary theories' (linked to the sensory apparatus) and 'secondary theories'. The latter are the result of attempts to meet the demand for an explanation of phenomena that cannot be explained in terms of 'primary theories'. Two subsets of 'secondary theories' are compared: spiritualistic personalized theories and scientific theories. From the historical point of view the scientific secondary theories are but a special subset of the class of secondary theories. From the systematic point of view it is instructive to focus on a comparison of the two subsets: what do they have in common? in what respects do they differ? The rise of scientific thinking is closely linked to the 'European Miracle'. How (and when and why) did the West grow rich? To answer this question we must first produce an explanation of the principle: theories about the consequences of institutional arrangements. Then we can give a historical explanation of why this development took place in Europe and only there. It is claimed that the secret of success, economic wealth and the first approximations to relatively free societies, was the taming of the state, the taming of cleptocracy (independent of the nature of the agency having cleptocratic appetites, be it princes or parliaments). The taming of the state is a pre-democratic achievement. Finally, the consequences of institutional arrangements for scientific progress and innovation are examined. Only if the system is market-like, will it link individual effort with reward and, through the competitive process, encourage the wide dissemination and use of new ideas. There is no tradeoff between freedom on the one hand and economic success and the growth of scientific knowledge on the other. Freedom and the ensuing flexi bility is the key to the past and to the future. Key words: Science, cognitive sensory apparatus, cultural evolution, wealth-creating institutions, inter theoretical competition, free, private market order, human capital. 1. THE DOMINANT ROLE OF SCIENCE IN OUR INTELLECTUAL CLIMATE The intellectual climate of the civilized world is shaped by science in the sense that scientific knowledge is the most respected sort of knowledge. It is respected because it is objective in the sense of being intersubjectively testable so that the scientific merit of a theory can be appraised without Journal for General Philosophy of Science 21: 275-292, 1990. ? 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">276 GERARD RADNITZKY taking into account how that theory was generated and what effects it may have on those who believe it, work with it, etc. For the broad masses of the populace the prestige of science is due to the efficacy of the technology based on science. Their lives have been changed by that technology, a development that has accelerated during the last six decades. For the thinking sections of the population the prestige of science resides also in the way it is progressing. The world picture of the educated public has been shaped by the various scientific discoveries. We speak of a "scientific world-picture". However, if taken literally, this expression would be a contradictio in adjecto. Creating a world-picture is not the task of science. A world-picture is created by philosophical cosmology and philosophical anthropology. They attempt to gather the relevant contributions of the various scientific disciplines and to mould them into a more or less unified picture.1 In recent years, cosmology in combination with quantum theory and synergetics have strongly in fluenced our world picture while evolutionary biology and genetics have helped us to improve our image of man. What is the current relationship between science and Christian religion, which offers an encompassing orientation and a theory about man's place in nature? Science has lost its heretic potential. Understandably, the Church correctly feared the effects of Galileo's theory on the broad masses of the population. It put up resistance to Darwin - but Darwin already is buried in Westminster Abbey. Science has won the battle, and, in general, its basic results are accepted by religious people no less than by agnostics or atheists. Although, whenever from certain theological statements empirically test able statements can be deduced, there is in principal the possibility that these statements may clash with current scientific theories. Theologians and the Church have made their peace with science. There is one impor tant exception: their attitude towards economics. In Pastoral Letters on the Economy and similar documents they pretend that economics as a scientific discipline does not exist. Sometimes one gets the impression that an attempt is made to transform the transcendental message into a socio political program, and many representatives of Protestantism, in parti cular in West Germany and in Great Britain, appear not even to bother about transforming a transcendental message, but from the beginning to engage in propagating a collectivist political program. However, disregard ing the results of economics has its price: the socio-political programs are based on assumptions that are patently false, and they would lead to consequences unacceptable to many of those who recommend these pro grams.2 To understand the current situation of science it is necessary to know something about how this situation came about. The development of science forms part of a larger development: the "European Miracle" and later the "Rise of the West". That phenomenon in turn constitutes a special case of a much broader development of cultural evolution. Before having</page><page sequence="3">THE BIRTH OF MODERN SCIENCE 277 a look at cultural evolution let us glance at the development of man's cognitive capacities. 2. THE EVOLUTION OF MAN'S COGNITIVE SENSORY APPARATUS - THE ROLE OF "PRIMARY THEORIES" IN THE ADAPTATION TO THE MESOCOSMOS Man's biological and intellectual make-up, which enables him to cope with the physical environment, is the result of biological and cultural evolution combined. Biology can show us the development of life from the level of bacteria about four billion years ago, for instance, the development of animal vision starting from the humble beginnings of photocontrolled movement of organisms that just had invented photosynthesis as a source of energy supply (W?chtersh?user, 1987, 'Light and Life...'). According to Popper's "active Darwinism" organisms shape their senses in the course of their foraging activity (cf., e.g., Popper, 1987, 'Natural Selection...'; Bartley, 1987, 'Philosophy of Biology...'; Radnitzky, 1987a, 'Erkenntnis theoretische Probleme...'). In short it can teach us about the evolution of cognitive sensory apparatuses of various species (Radnitzky and Bartley, 1987, Evolutionary Epistemology...). Man's cognitive sensory apparatus, sense organs and brain, are the result of a long evolution and are adapted to what has been called the "mesocosmos", the world of medium dimensions with respect to the size of objects, to distances, velocities, etc. (cf., e.g., Vollmer, 1987, 'Unity of Science...'). It is suggestive to conceive the sensory apparatus in analogy with a computer as consisting of both hardware - the biological structures - and system software: the assumptions, expectations, hypotheses, theories, in dependently of whether they exist in the form of tacit knowledge or in the form of linguistically formulated hypotheses. Even in the simplest act of observing, of perceiving something as something, we transcend immediate experience by making hypotheses about what the thing perceived might be. We make these hypotheses on the basis of previous experience and the theories we have formed out of that experience, and in any act of perceiving we at the same time also test these hypotheses. These subcons ciously held assumptions, expectations, or formulated theories - I use the term 'theory' here in the wide sense - are ontogenetically a priori. (This, of course, does not imply anything about their validity; being genetically a priori does not entail being a priori valid). They are the phylogenetic inheritance gained in the evolution of the species. I propose to subsume them under the umbrella expression of "primary theories". I follow here the anthropologist Robin Horton (1982). Brain and mind have developed in a give-and-take relationship, i.e., what we have called the hardware of the cognitive sensory apparatus and its system software, the primary theories, have developed in such an interplay (cf., e.g., Sir John Eccles's work). Man has developed his brain by his dealing with the products of his mental activity, with the expectations,</page><page sequence="4">278 GERARD RADNITZKY hypotheses, theories - by forming them and by testing them, and sometimes replacing less good theories by better ones, i.e. by theories that provide a better "fit" to the relevant aspects of reality. Examples of such theories are the Euclidean perception of space3, the one-dimensional concept of time, the tendency to interpret a sequence of events as causally connected, the push-and-pull conception of causality, and so forth. The usefulness of the sharp distinction between space and time, which is due to the properties of our sensory cognitive appaatus, illustrates how well that apparatus is adapted to life in the mesocosmos - the separation is useful because in daily life we deal only with velocities that are very small compared to the velocity of light (cf., e.g., Kanitscheider, 1988, Weltbild..., pp. 84, 189). These synthetic a priori theories constitute the system software of man's cognitive sensory apparatus. Hence, the primary theories are common to all cultures, are human universals. They guide man's dealings with the physical environment and hence have survival value. 3. FROM LIFE IN THE FACE-TO-FACE GROUP TO THE LARGE, ANONYMOUS SOCIETY: THE EVOLUTION OF TWO SEPARATE NORM SYSTEMS Man belongs to those species that could survive only by forming groups. Man has lived in small face-to-face groups of gatherers, and later mainly as hunters, for about one to two million years. Because of the continuity between life in the primordial human horde and the chimpanzee horde, statements about when the transition occurred remain somewhat arbitrary and may well involve even a longer period (cf., e.g., Radnitzky, 1987b, 'Rise of Civilization...', p. 62; Waal, 1982, Chimpanzee Politics). The face to-face groups were made possible by the evolution of a rule system that governed the behavior of the group members so that reliable expectations of reactions could be formed. I propose to call that rule system the "soli darity norm system" (cf., e.g., Radnitzky, 1987b, 'Rise of Civilization...'). It has evolved in, and has made possible, life in small groups where people can touch each other and be touched by their fellows, and where the group had a common aim. The "solidarity norm system", adapted to life in the face-to-face group, is in important respects the counterpart in social life to the primary theories (which, it will be remembered, are adapted to life in the mesocosmos and are relevant for survival). Indeed, in social life the counterpart to the mesocosmos is the face-to-face group. The solida rity norm system is deeply engrained in our emotional life. Mankind has lived in small face-to-face groups for about one to two million years, and to some extent the solidarity norm system is the endowment from our non-human primate ancestors - which extends the relevant period to about four million years (Waal, 1982, Chimpanzee Polities', Radnitzky, 1987b, 'Rise of Civilization...', p. 55). During that period, because of the primi tive state of technology, the planet's carrying capacity has been only be tween one to ten million people, and the total population of the planet</page><page sequence="5">THE BIRTH OF MODERN SCIENCE 279 as well as the medium group size remained fairly constant. With increasing trade relations and the emergence of agriculture - a very late development, only about ten thousand years ago - the planet could sustain larger and larger populations, and the form of life changed from the small group to the large, anonymous society. Clans and larger tribes appeared and eventually nations and high cultures like China, India, and the Islamic empires. The anonymous society is characterized by the fact that now people serve the needs of others whom they don't know and profit from the efforts of others who do not know about them. They and likewise these others intend to improve their own lot and by doing so they simultaneously serve the welfare of the society, without intending to do so. A familiar quotation from Adam Smith epitomized the situation best: "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interests." Friedrich von Hayek introduced the term 'catallaxy' for that phenomenon; in certain contexts it means not only trading, but turning a foreigner into a friend, accepting him as someone with whom you peacefully do business. A central feature concerns the intra-group relationship: the primordial face to-face group needed a common aim, but in the anonymous society, in order peacefully to cooperate, people no longer need any common aim - apart from the formal aim to preserve the institutional framework which makes it possible for them to cooperate peacefully and which secures their economic freedoms and civil liberties. (If these are secured, the so-called "political freedom" is of little significance in the daily life of the ordinary person.) The transition from the face-to-face group to the large anonymous society has been made possible by the evolution of a second norm system. The thesis of the emergence of two moral systems and of their existence beside each other in modern industrialized society as well as the contention that, if in the public-political arena the abstract norm system were replaced by the solidarity system, economic welfare and freedom would be destroyed, form the central part of Hayek's theory of cultural evolution and of his social philosophy.4 The rules of that norm system are abstract in the sense that they abstract from the particular time and place and apply equally to all members of the society. I propose to call this norm system the "honesty system" since "pacta sunt servanda" plays a central role in it. It enables the individual to transcend the realm of personal acquaintance. For instance, personal exchange is replaced by interpersonal markets. The "solidarity" system, the moral system that successfully stabilizes the face-to-face group cannot fulfil that function for the anonymous society - that is the central theme in Hayek's theory of cultural evolution. Of course, the "solidarity" norm system has retained its applicability to all face-to-face groups, and, since many small groups - like the family and circles of friends - are interspersed in the anonymous society, the solidarity system applies to them, while the relatively free society, i.e, that special case of the anonymous</page><page sequence="6">280 GERARD RADNITZKY society which is wealth-creating and which respects private rights can only be preserved if its public-political sphere is governed by the abstract "honesty norm system". In this sense the "honesty norm system" with its abstract rules constitutes a social capital the importance of which can scarcely be overrated. The anonymous society governed by the norm system of abstract rules opens the possibility of a free society, i.e., a society based on the market order, where private rights are respected. Such a society can develop institutional arrangements that make possible the rise of science. However, whether or not this possibility is realized depends upon whether appropriate initial conditions occur, which in turn depends on geographical constraints and historical accidents. In summary, Hayek's theory, as outlined and defended in his latest book The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism (1988), is a conjectural history of modern world economy - what is usually referred to by economists as "free-market capitalism" - that exposes the enabling circumstances. Cultural evolution produced an institutional framework that fosters the information-gathering and disseminating process that cradles the wealth creating activities of capitalist market economies. These wealth-creating institutions efficiently solve the problem of how to coordinate the individual plans, tastes and propensities of millions of economic agents. It is the extended order of cooperation (a spontaneous order) that made possible the growth of wealth and of population. From this empirical theory Hayek derives the warning that the alternative which socialists offer to free-market capitalism would result in mass extinction (because of the impossibility to support present mankind) and impoverishment of those surviving. Hayek's theory is purely descriptive; it elaborates "if-then"-connections. 4. THE EMERGENCE OF 'SECONDARY THEORIES' The more lively man's intellectual life became, the greater became the demand for an explanation of phenomena which cannot be explained with the help of primary theories. Such a demand is bound to arise even in daily life, since primary theories have a very limited explanatory power if only because of the limited concept of causality. In addition, perennial questions arise, like the question of the origin of the world, the origin of life, of man, or of a particular group. The demand for an explanation of phenomena of daily life not explainable in terms of primary theories and hence not controllable as well as the demand for an answer to questions that cannot be answered with the help of primary theories, can only be met by constructing a new sort of theories. Hence, the primordial group develops myths of origin and these myths guide rituals, which can be viewed as technologies designed to influence supernatural powers. All high cultures have developed spiritualistic-personalized theories, which attempt to trans cend the experience of the mesocosmos. Again following Robin Hortin,</page><page sequence="7">THE BIRTH OF MODERN SCIENCE 281 I propose to use the umbrella word 'secondary theories' to designate that heterogeneous set of theories. Departing from Horton, I propose to define secondary theory as the class of theories that attempt to explain phenomena which cannot be explained by theories that are tied to our sense organs, independently of whether they involve supernatural entities or are empirically testable theories. Religious doctrines form an important subset of the class of secondary theories. They not only attempt to explain things but have social functions like providing coherence and supporting an order. Secondary theories owe nothing to biological evolution but are exclusively a product of cultural evolution. Hence, they vary widely from culture to culture. Since, by contrast to primary theories, they do not have survival value, they can afford to contain, as they often do, even patently absurd assertions or to postulate bizarre entities like gods with incompatible characteristics. From a historical point of view, it is appropriate to treat secondary theories as one single ideal type, and to draw attention to an interesting special case of secondary theory: to scientific theories. In cultural history the Euro pean development constitutes the exception, and one key feature of the "European Miracle" is the accelerating development of science from the beginning of the 17th century. From the systematic point of view it is recommendable to distinguish two types of secondary theories: spiritualistic-personalized secondary the ories and scientific theories, naturalistic-impersonal theories. In section (5), when institutional arrangements are considered, the historical aspect will be taken into account. To clarify these two ideal types of secondary theories I shall compare them to each other, that means I shall first ask what they have in common and then ask in what respects they differ. By listing what the two subsets of secondary theories have in common we also sharpen the distinction between primary and secondary theories. What do spiritualistic-metaphysical secondary theories and scientific se condary theories have in common? (1) All secondary theories, by defini tion, are designed with a view to meeting the same sort of demand: ex plaining what is unexplainable in terms of primary theories. (2) Both types attempt to meet that demand by means of a theory formation that in volves unfamiliar, "hidden" entities. (3) Both types of secondary theories have the same input, the same sources of ideas for theory formation: experience structured by means of primary theories. The sources for analogies, for root metaphors, are but few. They will be taken from that sector of experience that is felt to show more regularity than any other realm. Thus, in stable primitive societies (like African tribes or Eskimo), where - because of the high information costs - there is almost continuous surveillance, no privacy, and behavior is strictly norm-governed, it will be the social realm that is used as a source of root metaphors. When social life becomes less stable, which in Europe is the case from the 13th cen tury onward, the realm that provides the most reliable expectations is the</page><page sequence="8">282 GERARD RADNITZKY arena of manual technologies, the realm of artifacts. Instead of socio morph-anthropomorph models now technomorph models are the source of root metaphors. (The classic on this change is Topitsch, 1958, Ursprung und Ende...\ 1979, Erkenntnis und Illusion; cf. also Horton, 1982. 'Tradi tion und Modernity...', 238 and 253.) Technomorph models also inspired the mechanistic world picture, the metaphysics underlying early science. (4) Both types of secondary theory transcend the realm of every day ex perience, if only because they talk about entities not directly accessible to our cognitive sensitive apparatus, which is limited to experience of the mesocosmos. The spiritualistic type of secondary theory postulates super natural entities, all sorts of gods, demons, genii loci, and sometimes develops religious doctrines as well as demonologies. The scientific theories make assertions about the cosmos and about the micro-world. In our century, we have witnessed three great breakthroughts that transcend our experience of the mesocosmos and that have changed our world-picture: with respect to cosmic dimensions, the theory of relativity; with respect to the micro world, quantum theory; and with respect to systems far from equilibrium, chaotic systems and order arising out of chaos, synergetics. (5) However, both types of secondary theories remain linked to the realm of everyday experience to which man's cognitive sensory apparatus is adapted. They remain linked to it through the input (point [2] above), and even the spiritualistic-personalized theories, at least to some degree, submit to the test of experience, make some claim to a certain efficacy in explaining, predicting and hence also in controlling events. For instance, some of them claim that by means of certain rituals the gods may be induced to inter fere in human affairs in certain predictable ways. The choice example is a rain dance. Scientific theories have, by definition, to submit to the crucial test of experience. The question of what is the cachet of scientific thinking can be answered by investigating in what respects personalized secondary theories and scientific secondary theories differ.5 (1) Each type of theory florishes in a different kind of intellectual climate: the spiritualistic secondary theories in a climate of cognitive traditionalism (Horton, 1982, 'Tradition and Modernity...', 238); the scientific theories in the context of criticistic thinking, in which the fallibility of human knowledge is explicitly acknowledged. Hence, each type is inspired by a different ideal of knowledge. Cognitive traditionalism upholds an end-state conception of ideal knowledge: genuine knowledge should be proven to be true. It tends to fuse and confuse truth and certainty. The epistemological climate that is propitious for science favors a process conception of knowledge: the process of research is open-ended, and scientific progress is possible in spite of the principal fallibility of all human knowledge (cf., e.g., Radnitzky, 1987d, Wittgenstein...). (2) The ways in which the two types of secondary theories are legitimized are completely different. Typically, a spiritualistic-personalized secondary theory has recourse to an infallible source, and genuine knowledge is revealed knowledge that is</page><page sequence="9">THE BIRTH OF MODERN SCIENCE 283 handed down in accordance with the tradition. This type of legitimizing secondary theories has impregnated Western philosophy and shaped the latent epistemology that underlies ordinary language; ordinary language is impregnated with justificationist philosophy. (3) A particular way of legitimization a theory is closely linked to a particular mode of theorizing. It is this respect that constitutes the decisive difference between the two types of secondary theories. Typically, spiritualistic secondary theories play an important role as stabilizers and legitimizers of social order, and hence the mode of theorizing is 'consensual' (Horton, 1982, 'Tradition and Modernity...', 239). An assertion shows its worth by being coherent with the tradition, at least with respect to principles. Hence, criticism from outside will be met by immunization strategies. The scientific enterprise is charac terized by the competitive mode of theorizing. Ideally, free inter theoretic competition reigns and rational theory preference primarily takes into account the differential problem-solving power of the competing theories. An assessment of this capability has to be based on the past record of the competitors in surviving falsification attempts. Prediction functions as a means of testing a theory. No attempts are made to justify a theory. A scientific theory cannot be 'justified'. No more than a species that have survived so far is thereby "justified", is a scientific theory justified by its explanatory and predictive success up to date. In each case, what matters is whether or not the theory, or the species, has shown itself to be viable (Bartley, 1987, 'Philosophy of Biology...'). The prototype of scientific theory, of course, is natural-science theory. In a considerable part of social science and the humanities the commitment of the researcher to extra-cognitive values has the consequence that the theories generated often have more affinity to the spiritualistic-personalized secondary theory than to the pure type of scientific theory (Horton, 1982, 'Tradition and Modernity...', 248). If intertheoretical competition functions properly, theory change is an objective process, and hence the better theory drives out the less good one (cf., e.g., Radnitzky, 1987c, 'Economic' Approach...'). However, there is a big difference between natural science and the sciences humaines. In the latter, empirical testing is often not directly applicable - and sometimes it is even avoided. For instance, in certain historical narratives interpretation may be more important than explanation and, hence, there is a risk that moralizing will intrude. In the social sciences, peer review often functions poorly. Antony Flew (1985, Thinking About..., chapt. 1) gives some striking examples of the indifference of the scientific community to the exposure of social-science theories that systematically confuse description and wishful thinking. The competitive mode of theorizing implies the requirement of inter subjective testability, which in turn entails that scientific theories have certain important limitations which spiritualistic secondary theories don't have. They cannot contain genuine, i.e., non-instrumental value judgements or norms, and hence they alone cannot settle any moral issues, and they have nothing</page><page sequence="10">284 GERARD RADNITZKY to say on "extistential themes" like the "meaning" of life, of death, of happiness, and so forth. 5. THE RISE OF SCIENTIFIC THINKING AS ONE OF THE EARMARKS OF THE 'EUROPEAN MIRACLE' So far as we know, the competitive mode of thinking began with the Pre Socratics. There, probably for the first time, criticism was encouraged, including criticism of the secondary theories which hitherto had constituted revealed knowledge handed down from generation to generation as so mething sacrosanct. Referring to Hayek I mentioned that the evolution of the large, anonymous society opened up the possibility of a development towards a free society - a possibility, not more. The breakthrough of scientific thinking was achieved in Europe and it is an integral part of the "European Miracle" (I borrow this term from the title of E.L. Jones's book of 1981). The competitive mode, which is the growing ground of scientific thinking, can only thrive in a particular institutional environment. Let us ask why and how institutional arrangements that create wealth - be it economic wealth or new knowledge - evolved in Europe and only there. So far as we know, all advanced civilizations have been despotisms, and the mass of the people have always lived in extreme poverty. A longi tudinal performance comparison of economies and nations reveals that the 'Rise of the West' is the exception: a brilliant and perhaps fragile accident. About five hundred years ago, the high cultures of the Far East, in particular China, were superior to European civilization (cf. Needham, 1969, Grand Titration, 190).6 However, Europe embarked on an unparalleled develop ment, which accelerated for the last two hundred years, so that at the turn of the century Europe literally ruled the world. Within the long-term cultural evolution a special case had appeared. When we wish to explain "How (and when and why) the West grew rich", the "West" is defined as those areas where in the last two hundred years prosperity has touched the lives of more than the upper tenth of the population. (Cf., e.g., Rosenberg and Birdzell, 1986, 'How the West...; Weede, 1987a. 'Eurosclerosis...', 1988; 'Sonderweg ...'; Engerman, 1988. 'How the West...'.) The phenomenon started in Europe and, in our cen tury, has moved westward. The itinerary is roughly this: in the 14-15th century, the North-Italian commercial cities, by 1600 Holland, post-1750 England, about 1900 the US, and today Japan, Hong Kong, Singa pore, ROC, ROK (see, e.g., Rabushka, 1987, New China...', 1988, 'Eco nomic, Civil...'). "Rich" in our explanandum is taken in the wide sense of "welfare" comprising both financial and economic wealth and freedom. Disregarding the difficulty of concepts of national income accounting, it is clearly visible that the "Rise of the West" brought a great advance in the welfare of human beings, as indicated by the means available to the great majority of individuals themselves to choose and shape the quality</page><page sequence="11">THE BIRTH OF MODERN SCIENCE 285 of the lives they lead (Engerman, 'How the West...', 1988). Throughout history those economies grew fastest that were freest - and the same holds for scientific progress. The Rise of the West rests on three pillars: in the economy, the market order, in the political sphere, the taming of the State', in intellectual life, autonomous science. (1) The market order or competitive capitalism is the key factor. It presupposes and rests on private rights, i.e., that property rights are respected by the rulers at least to such an extent that their predatory appetites are kept in check. (2) The existence of private rights (Hirshleifer, 1980, 'Privacy...') in turn entails and presupposes the existence of some sort of legal framework protecting such rights. (3) Autonomous science as a model of a particular cognitive mode - the competitive mode - achieved its breakthrough only with Galileo and Newton. (Of course it had innu merable forerunners.) That breakthrough had been made possible by the evolution of institutional arrangements that foster wealth creation. Wealth creating institutions have certain general characteristics that are independent of whether they produce economic and financial wealth or human capital - "human capital" is here taken as comprising both epistemic resources, knowledge, and the producers of such epistemic resources or of economic wealth. The link between science and economic wealth appeared only after the late 19th century. Science itself florished best where its autonomy and freedom was fostered by the decentralization of invention and innovation and the ability of those who succeed to capture their rewards - in contrast with the "ignominy memorialized in the eponym 'Lysenkoism' " (Rosenberg and Birdzell, 1986, How the West..., 255). Why did suitable political conditions develop in Europe rather than at other placesl Like all historical processes the "Rise of the West" is a singularity and a contingent process. We can explain the principle by pointing out certain possibilities which have opened up. Which of the possible devel opments has been realized, depends essentially on the initial conditions', these in turn depend on the crossing points of causal chains, which contain a substantial chance element. In the case at hand, among the initial conditions natural constraints have played a key role. By contrast to the conditions which Asian and Islamic rulers were confronted with, European geography - soils, geology, climates, etc. - varies from place to place and core-areas are comparatively small. For European rulers it was by far more difficult to project military power from the core area to the periphery. Hence, the European states faced neighbors with roughly equal military capabilities, and the interna tional game of power was characterized by a permanent and fierce competition (cf. Weede, 1987a, 'Eurosclerosis...'; 1987b, 'Ideas ...'; 1988, 'Sonderweg...'). Competition in economic markets provided the seed for an autonomy of technology and later of science. Competition among holders of political power within a nation, a phenomenon common to Europe,</page><page sequence="12">286 GERARD RADNITZKY boosted capitalism and economic growth. Historical accidents reinforced that development: one important factor was the power struggle between the State and the Church. Competition between states, together with practicable opportunities for exit, facilitated the spread of innovations throughout Europe. Besides competition between states in the form of trade, competition in the form of power politics and wars were another factor that boosted economic development. Military technology has always been a pacemaker for civil technology (cf, e.g., Albert, 1968, Kritische Vernunft..., 14; Andreski, 1968, Military Organization...', 1969, Comparative Sociology...). The role which the competition between states in the form of war played for European development can hardly be overrated. The rulers, ruling over a limited territory, recognized that they could get a larger income from a steady stream of protection rents than from robbing merchants. Given these constraints for European rulers it was rational to keep in check their predatory and cleptocratic appetites and to concede relatively secure property rights (Weede, 1987a, 'Eurosclerosis...', 4; 1987b, 'Ideas...', 2). Property rights were in turn the growing ground for a moral system of individualism and personal responsibility. Conceding property rights to individuals meant limited government; the protective purpose of the state became more and more pronounced: a strong (protective) state but not indulging in a wide range of activities. Thus limited government could evolve in an age of feudalism and absolutism. Limited government is a pre-democratic achievement. In sum, sustained economic growth has been based on trading across an area large enough to be important but divided among a number of rival nation-states. Each of these states was large enough to protect property rights in a territory large enough to be important, but not so large as to become an empire with inefficiencies analogous to those of the mono polistic firm. The possibilities for capital mobility and the risk of losing valuable human capital operated as a d?terrant to political confiscation or confiscatory taxes (Engerman, 1988, 'How the West'). 6. THE CONSEQUENCES OF INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS AND FOR INNOVATIONS Science-based technology has become important only in the 20th century, and its importance has been accelerating for the last 60 years. To develop technologies certain institutional arrangements are required. This requi rement has so far proved an insurmountable barrier to the development of science-based high technologies in totalitarian states. Thus, the USSR has been obliged to resort to technological espionage practically for all its military technology (Mekler, 1986, 'Soviet Science...'). The body of scientific knowledge evolves like a spontaneous order, i.e., it is the result of the action of many individuals and groups, which neither</page><page sequence="13">THE BIRTH OF MODERN SCIENCE 287 individually nor collectively intend to bring about that particular state of the body of knowledge. The system is self-correcting at least in those disciplines, where theory formation is strictly controlled by empirical testing. If the body of scientific knowledge evolves as a spontaneous order and the researcher (as an ideal type) acts as a discovery-maximizing entrepreneur, then those institutional frames will best facilitate the improvement of the human capital that best approximate the market order. Competition functions both as a discovery mechanism and as a selection process. Organization of science and of innovation will profit from decentralization. In science, the intellectual counterpart to free competition in economic markets is unlimited criticism of competing problem solutions; the intellectual coun terpart to protectionist measures in the economic system is the tendency towards cartellization within academe. In each case the improvement of wealth - be it physical and financial wealth or human capital including knowledge - will be impeded and, if cartellization becomes virulent, progress will stop. 7. THE FUTURE IS OPEN Evolution has no aim. Cultural evolution produced two striking develop ments: an increase in power, i.e., in man's opportunity set (Stone Age man possessed the same natural resources as modern man, the difference lies in the knowledge how to use them in order to better one's lot) and an increase in individual freedom. The secret of the "European Miracle" has been the evolution of limited government. The phenomenon of the westward movement of the "Rise of the West" can only be explained if we keep in mind that the rise of the West has been made possible by the evolution of freedom of the economic sphere from political influence as well as from religious restrictions that lead to the security of property rights. In Europe, the constraints constituted by geography, in combination with historical accidents, led to a limited scale of political decision making and multiple sources of decision making. By attending to changes in the political conditions we can also explain the development from the "Economic Miracle" of Europe to "Eurosclerosis", to the corporatist state.7 The cancerous growth of government and the built-in escalation of welfare-state costs is likely to determine the future of Western Europe. This, however, is a problem, which all Western democracies face, even if in this respect some of them are better off than others (Buchanan, 1986. 'Our Times...', 35). It is an open question whether the relative free society, which can support autonomous sciences and is supported by it, which grew out of the "European Miracle" and which constitutes a unique and fragile exception in human history, will be an episode or an enduring achievement. Much will depend on whether it will be possible to educate the educable sections of the population and above all the future decision makers so that they understand the functioning of modern society and economy. This is a cognitive and</page><page sequence="14">288 GERARD RADNITZKY also an educational task. The comparative institutions approach outlines the consequences of various institutional arrangements: the ways institutions work out for people living under them, what opportunities various systems offer, what sort of life is possible under them. It will then be up to the individuals to choose between giving individual freedom priority in the social and public sphere or to accept some form of slavery under a totalitarian system, including unlimited democracy in the sense of the dictatorship of the majority, or the tyranny of rent-seeking minorities, as a special case of totalitarianism. Thus, a position taking on value issues is indispensable. Hayekians posit the value of individual freedom. In my opinion, the contractarian approach to Constitution and State conceals the value issues. Values are traded-off all the time. Sometimes, people sell themselves into slavery if they are paid for it - as we witness in connection with the modern welfare state. However, there is no trade-off between freedom on the one hand and economic success and scientific progress on the other hand. The two are inseparable: economic growth has come from economic freedom and competition, and scientific progress has come from a free market of ideas and inter theoretical competition.% NOTES 1 This presupposes a certain "unity" among the various scientific disciplines. See, e.g., (Radnitzky, ed., 1987 and 1988, Centripetal Forces...). 2 See, e.g., Brunner et al., 1986, Economics, Theology, and the Social Order. Let me just point out three of the basic fallacies that underlie these socio-political programs. (1) "The Garden of Eden conception of the economy": From the assertion that all goods are god-given it is inferred that property rights to the results of efforts need not be strongly correlated with those efforts, with risk-taking, etc. (2) "The John Stuart Mill fallacy": Roughly, the belief that there is no feedback from redistribution to production; e.g., from the fact that you can distribute this year's national income as you please, it is inferred that the way in which the results of productive efforts are redistributed in one year will not necessarily affect productivity and wealth creation in the next period. (3) "The negative sum social game conception of trade and wealth creation": It can be epitomized by the slogan "You are rich because we are poor, and we are poor because you are rich". Those who ignore the economic and political consequences of institutional arrangements also cannot see what consequences the implementation of their programs would have on individual freedom. On the relationship between institutions and freedom see, e.g., (Robilant, 1987, Liberta e societ?...) and (Walker, 1988, Freedom, Democracy...). 3 Purely visual space is not Euclidean (Heelan, 1985, Space Perception...). Our Euclidean space perception is the result of a long process of adaptation to the mesocosmos in which various sense modalities have cooperated. 4 Cf., e.g., (Hayek, 1973/76/79, Law, Legislation...; Hayek in Chapter 12 of Radnitzky 1987, ed., Centripetal Forces...); for an overview and reference to the literature see, e.g., (Radnitzky, 1987b. 'Rise of Civilization...' 5 How then does Needham explain that China, nonetheless, did not achieve economic growth? According to Needham it was institutional arrangements that "inhibited the rise of modern capitalism and of modern science" (1969, Grand Titration, 197). In other words, the great leap forward did not happen in China because China never had room for anything like the commercial cities of late medieval Europe, which offered economic freedoms. A supreme, because reluctant, compliment to capitalism coming from a lifelong Communist.</page><page sequence="15">THE BIRTH OF MODERN SCIENCE 289 6 The problem of demarcating science from non-science has received consistent attention in the philosophy of science, and there is a vast literature on the explication of the concept of empirical significance. (A survey and appraisal is given, e.g., in [Radnitzky, 1968/73, Contemporary Schools..., 112-145; Radnitzky, 1989, 'Wissenschaftlichkeit'].) Demarcating synthetic statements against analytic statements and hence empirical science from formal science is relatively unproblematic. The interesting problem is, within the class of synthetic statements, to demarcate empirical statements from the rest. For the present purpose, the following proposal may suffice. (1) A statement which possesses empirical content eo ipso runs the risk of being contradicted by reality, of being falsified. Falsification is a methodological concept. A theoretical system TS is falsified by the falsifying premise FP iff FP is less problematic than TS and FP contradicts TS. A falsificatory argument is taken seriously only if the following is the case: in the standard model, if the conjunction of the theories, the auxiliary hypotheses and the statements of the initial conditions implies the prediction P, and the statement that describes the observed effect P* entails that not-P, then P* must describe a reproducible effect, i.e., be intersubjectively testable. While falsification is a methodological concept, falsifiability is a logical concept: it states the logical relationship between classes of sentences, i.e., TS is falsifiable (in the language L) iff FP (in the above argument) can be formulated in L. Being falsifiable in this sense is a necessary and sufficient condition for qualifying as a statement with emperical content. (Usually, we call it "scientific" only if it also possesses a certain degree of systematicity.) For science as an ensemble of theories and as an activity, Karl Popper proposes the following characteristic: "Science' is differentiated from the older myths not by being.something distinct .... but by a second-order tradition ..." (1963, Conjectures..., 127), that means if it is placed in and handled in a non-justificationist context, a context in which nothing is dogmatized. (Cf. Bartley, 1962/1984, Retreat..., and Part II of Radnitzky and Bartley, eds., 1987, Evolutionary Epistemology ... .) 7 A striking example is the wage structure in West Germany: it is determined by a highly centralized collective bargaining procedure; corporatism in the labor market is a political taboo. It has lead to inflexibility and large unemployment and has grossly impaired the incentive system. The causes for the decline lie on the supply side: rigidities in the labor market, an excess of regulations for potentially dynamic sectors, subsidies and high taxes, a corporatist political climate. Other European countries appear to suffer to a similar extent, with the possible exception of Great Britain and Italy. 8 In the words of Russell Kirk: "The struggle will be decided in the minds of the rising generation - and within that generation, substantially by the minority who have the gift of reason." (quoted from Regnery, 1979, Dissident Publisher..., 147). REFERENCES Agazzi, E.: 1987, Philosophie, Science, M?taphysique, Editions Universitaires Fribourg Suisse, Fribourg.
