<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chapter One The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos Myths are seldom simple and never irresponsible. Robert Graves, The Greek Myths Nothing dies until it is lived out. H.G. Baynes, Mythology of the Soul The epoch-making insight of Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss revealed that myth links nature and cultures.1 In the present work, we shall try and walk in his giant footsteps and show that myth bridges history and transcendence and may provide ties between subject and object, relating them to man. In the process of our deliberations, we shall coin several new metaphysical concepts and provide some hitherto unexplored angles to the relationship between consciousness and energy matter. In The Myth of Tantalus , we explained how the individual psyche develops from a pantheistic unity until it is ejected, through conflict and deprivation, from its sense of holistic oneness to that of a separate entity.2 In The Violence of Silence , we described how the individual strives towards other humans, flora, fauna, and even inanimate objects, trying to achieve as deep an encounter as he is able.3 In The Promethean Connection , we examined the link between consciousness and quantum mechanics and tried to trace the dynamics by which the human cognitive processes may 'collapse' the probabilities within a superposition - a nondescript, hazy 'soup' of energy - into a well-defined quantum state.4 The relationship between the self and its human and objective environment is, therefore, conceived within the context of a Buberian dialogue. If an I-thou encounter occurs, there is a sense of revelation and meaning. If a dialogue is not effected, the self feels that its environment is menacing, opaque, and absurd. A dialogue may be affected, according to Buber, only if the self opens up voluntarily to the other. When the choice has been made, and the self enters into a dialogic relationship with another human being, or into an authentic relationship with words, music, or a painting, the alternatives - to use a quantum mechanical simile -</page><page sequence="2">2 God as the shadow of man collapse, and the relevant mental energy is infused exclusively into the dialogical relationship. Technically, we have availed ourselves of Niels Bohr's conceptualization of the complementarity between divergent dualities to describe the possibilities of linkage between man, on the one hand, and energy-matter, on the other. Bohr says: ...Evidence obtained under different experimental conditions cannot be comprehended within a single picture, but must be regarded as complementary in the sense that only the totality of the phenomena exhaust the possible information about the objects... Indeed this circumstance presents us with a situation concerning the analysis and synthesis of experience which is entirely new in physics and forces us to replace the ideal of causality by a more general viewpoint usually termed 'complementarity'. The apparently incompatible sorts of information about the behavior of the object under examination, which we get by different experimental arrangements, can clearly not be brought into connection with each other in the usual way, but may, as equally essential for an exhaustive account of all experience, be regarded as 'complementary' to each other. 5 Bohr intended his complementarity principle to apply not only to pairs of quantitative parameters (the measurement of both at the same time barred by the uncertainty principle), but also to the bonding of contradictory parameters in biology, psychology, and philosophy, especially ethics. Hence, for instance, the complementarity between value judgments and collapse of alternatives would induce us to see evil after we have made an indeterministic choice to opt for evil. Per contra, if we elect to see good, we shall see good. If we concentrate on one alternative, the other collapses; if we set out to observe good, we tend to ignore evil, and vice versa. The complementarity principle in the field of cultural norms may be envisaged in the following manner: Every organism needs a system-in-balance to function and survive. This holds true for artifacts as well as human aggregates. Hence, Hellenistic cultures stress the need for contextual harmony. The Egyptian ethos , like the Greek kosmos , which literally means order, anchors on the need for balance. The most important Greek norm is meden agan , nothing in excess, and the cardinal sin is hilbris , the divergence from the golden mean. In a similar vein, the Egyptian goddess Maat is in charge of the all-important cosmic order, to be maintained as a precondition for the cycles of life. Conformity to group norms is a prime Greek mandate; deviants - both transgressors and outstanding achievers - were ostracized and expelled from the polis. The Jews, on the other hand, were socialized to strive for the absolute. This makes for revelatory insights, but poor team workers. Indeed, the Jews,</page><page sequence="3">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 3 wherever they were, tended to contribute brilliant ideas to their host cultures, but usually did not excel as contextual performers. The viability of a culture depends on a complementarity between the revelatory virtuoso, spurred by directional insight, and the contextual performers, who integrate the ideas into a durable system-in-balance. Bohr intended the complementarity principle to serve philosophy better than Aristotelian causality, scholastic coincidentia oppositorium, and Hegelian dialectics. We have our own conception of how the complementarity principle actually effects the linkage between divergent concepts, parameters, and objects and shall elucidate it in due course. The link between consciousness and the objective world was masterfully metaphorized in the following Hasidic tale, as told by S.Y. Agnon to Gershom Scholem: When the Ba'al Shem had a difficult task before him, he would go to a certain place in the woods, light a fire, and meditate in prayer - and what he set out to perform was done. When a generation later the Maggid of Meseritz was faced with the same task he would go to the same place in the woods and say: We can no longer light the fire, but we can still speak the prayers - and what he wanted done became reality. A generation later Rabbi Moshe Leib of Sassov had to perform this task. And he too went to the woods and said: We can no longer light the fire, nor do we know the secret meditations belonging to the prayer, but we do know the place in the woods to which it all belongs - and that must be sufficient; and sufficient it was. But when another generation had passed and Rabbi Israel of Rishin was called on to perform the task, he sat down in his golden chair in his castle and said: We cannot light the fire, we cannot speak the prayers, we do not know the place, but we can tell the story of how it was done. And, the story-teller adds, the story which he told had the same effect as the other three.6 This Hasidic tale was interpreted by Scholem as portraying the decay of the Hasidic movement and the transformation of its values.7 Our interpretation is different: We hold that the Ba'al Shem Tov (the Besht) - the charismatic founder of the Hasidic movement - taught that the optimal performance of man's tasks in this world is a praxis: a combination of action and meditative prayer or spiritual concentration. Indeed, the Besht, the doer, integrates his thoughts with the overt action - the kindling of the fire - and brings about the performance of the task. The quietist, inner-directed Maggid of Meseritz, does not act, but prays. The Besht reaches out to the object whereas the Maggid focuses on his thoughts and transforms them into a solipsistic reality all his own. The Rabbi of Sassov anchors his efforts on a spatial location to perform the task. The Rabbi of Rishin has no action, no spiritual concentration, and no</page><page sequence="4">4 God as the shadow of man location; all he has is a story, a mythical account which generates the task. This Hasidic tale highlights the subject of our present work: The combination of cognitive dynamics with energy-matter by generative myths to create reality. The link between subject and object has been one of the most relevant psycho-philosophical problems from time immemorial. Solomon Maimon, the disciple of Kant, posited the matter in metaphoric terms: 'To find a passage from the external world to the mental world is more important than to find a way to East India, no matter what statesmen may say.' Still, our concern is more pragmatic: We wish to understand how the mental revelation of an Archemedian 'Eureka' is structured into an objective creation. We hypothesize that this creative linkage is affected by a mythogenic structure, the meaning of which has, of course, to be presently explained. Andrew Lang, a pioneering student of mythology, stated towards the end of the nineteenth century that myths are not just cautionary tales to frighten young children into eating their porridge, but causal and aetiological explanations of phenomena that had taken place in historical reality. He, therefore, denoted mythology as a proto-science.8 Freud claimed that 'myths are the distorted vestiges of the wish-fulfillment fantasies of whole nations... the age-long dreams of young humanity.'9 Freud actually raised his intra-psychic interpretation of dreams on to the group level and claims that the myth is an expression of the tribe's 'social characters,' the nation's or social aggregate's wishes and visions. Surely, the myth of the Flood was not dreamful wish-fulfillment, but a projection of actual experiences of disastrous inundations by rivers - especially in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Myths are, therefore, also a projection of experiences and of spectacular events borne by a group before written history in ille tempore. According to Bachofen, 'The mythical tradition may be taken as a faithful reflection of life in those times in which historical antiquity is rooted. It is a manifestation of primordial thinking, an immediate historical revelation and, consequently, a very reliable source.'10 Eliade further claims that, because myths reflect the occurrence of events on a high level of abstraction, they also reveal the principles or designs underlying events. He writes that 'the myth discloses the eventful creation of the world and man, and at the same time, the principles which govern the cosmic process and human existence. The myths succeed each other and articulate themselves into a sacred history, which is continuously recovered in the life of the community as well as in the existence of each individual. What happened in the beginning describes at once both the original perfection and the destiny of each individual.'11 This brings us to Jung, who regarded myths not only as means of individual psychic expression, but also as the archetypal contents of the</page><page sequence="5">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 5 'collective human unconsciousness.'12 As an interim summary, we may regard myths as a projection of wishes and experiences both on the individual and group levels. Some two decades ago, in Salvation Through the Gutters , we stated that: ...Our methodological anchor is the conception of myths as projections of personal history. Individuals are aware of their personalities as the sole existential entity in their cognition. This awareness of existence is the only epistemological reality. Myths cannot, therefore, be divorced from the human personality. Whatever happened to us in the amnestic years, and even later, is projected onto our theory of the creation of the universe, magic and other human beings. The events that happened in the highly receptive amnestic years have been recorded and stored by the human brain. Events that happened after the amnestic years may be recalled cognitively, but whatever happened within these first years of life is recalled, inter alia, by myths of cosmogony. Myths as personal history may, therefore, be regarded as the account of some crucial developmental stages in the formative years. Moreover, human development, in the early formative years, passes in an accelerated manner through the evolutionary phases of the species.13 Consequently, myths are also a projection of the development of the species, as paralleled in the development of the individual. It is interesting to note that this conception of myths as a projection of personal history may be inferred from the Apocalypse of Baruch, which stated that 'every man is the Adam of his own soul,'14 which may in turn be interpreted to mean that every human being experiences original sin. Karl Abraham, as early as 1925 in his article 'Character Formation on the Genital Level of Libido Development,' expressed a basic idea, which may be relevant for our present purposes, thus: In the two phases of development... we are able to recognize archaic types of character-formation. They represent in the life of the individual recapitulations of primitive states which the human race has passed through at certain stages of its development. Hence, in general in biology, we find the rule holding good that the individual repeats in an abbreviated form the history of his ancestors. Accordingly, in normal circumstances, the individual will traverse those early stages of character formation in a relatively short space of time.15 Hence, the myth of the Fall of Man is the projection of a stage of development of the individual, yet also a universal human developmental experience. However, myths become archetypal projections of human experience only when they are widespread. The more common a developmental experience, the greater its chances of becoming a mythical</page><page sequence="6">6 God as the shadow of man projection. The converse is also valid: The more widespread the myth, the higher the chance that it is a projection of a widespread or even universal development. The universality of the myth of the Fall of Man, for example, points to a corresponding developmental phase - the separation of the individual self from the unified whole of early orality, which is indeed experienced by every human being. Therefore, we hold that myths structure meanings for human behavior and serve as motivation and prime movers for both individual and group behavior. As myths are projected models of human behavior at all levels, they may be records of past experience as well as a structuring for future longings and goals. Myths are also expressions of both overt behavior and of covert dynamics; of the here and now as well as of transcendence. The dimensions of myths may also vary greatly, ranging from micro-myths, like names of persons and places representing meaningful experiences or quests, to meta-myths representing the polar type of human behavior on both the individual and group levels such as the myths of Sisyphus and Tantalus. They vary with time and place. Every society and culture has its own indigenous mythology. Myths move in time from sacred myths recorded before history to modern myths, like master detectives Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot, or the master spy, John Le CarrÃ©'s Smiley, or even Superman, who realizes the dreams of the omnipotence among the downtrodden, henpecked inhabitants of Metropolis. Myths can relate to individuals. The offering of Isaac and Iphigenia, signifying the sacrificial enmeshing of the young within the normative system of society, are two examples. Then there are group myths like the adventures of the Olympian gods and the tribal exploits of the German iEsir. The Nazi movement may indeed be studied as a collective myth when the collective worms, to use Goebbels' macabre simile, become effectively a fire spitting dragon.16 We follow in the giant footsteps of Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss, who claimed that myths are a connecting structure between divergent polarities like the raw and the cooked.17 However, we attribute to mythology, as a structure, wider and deeper functions. Piaget has described the function of a structure, thus: A system of transformations is characterized by the laws of this system (in contradistinction to the attributes of its individual components). The system is preserved and enriched by the actions of these transformations, but they do not lead to outright components, which are outside the (structured system). In short, a structure is characterized by holism, transformation, and self-regulation.18</page><page sequence="7">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 7 It is therefore 'ahistorical' in the sense that a myth, as a holistic self-regulating structure, functions irrespective of its historical veracity. Thus Moses and the Exodus of the Jews from Egypt, which have no corroboration outside the Bible, have generated monotheistic Judaism, which is still viable, regardless of Moses' actually having existed or not. Also, we hold that myths link subject and object, the individual and society, consciousness and matter, revelation and creativity, history and transcendence. This linkage is a feedback cycle, since man, for instance, projects myths on to metaphysics, which are structured into religion, which in turn feeds the individual's faith. The creative myth, or in our terminology, the 'mythologie structure', is not only a self-regulating mechanism, but also a self-recharging dynamic. Man projects the myths which are remodeling him as role models, creative muses, ideologies, and religions. Hence, myths are our prime movers, which lift us by our own proverbial bootstraps Ã  la Baron Munchausen, powered as a self-energizing perpetuum mobilas. Our interest in mythology has been generated over almost three decades of interest in the theory and practice of labeling. When someone is stigmatized as a homosexual, a criminal, or a madman, his or her other attributes and qualities seem to become eclipsed. The fact that the homosexual is also a good pianist, that the criminal has a sense of humor, or that the madman has a good heart becomes eclipsed by the over-arching effect of stereotyping as a deviant, jailbird, or lunatic. The stigmatization of the deviant, the different person or the outsider is just one instance of the omnipotence of structure. Of special importance in our present context is Piaget' s exposition on structures which are current to both psychology and physics.19 Piaget also assures us that children start thinking in structures. This might account for the fact that the most basic structures are ingrained in us in our oral phase of development, along with the acquisition of our mother tongue. Structures are, therefore, independent entities with internal transformation that do not change, because self-regulation keeps them intact. It is important to note that once the structure has been formed, we get used to it by processes of feedback. The earlier and longer one has had a structure, the more it is cherished through the dynamics of cognitive dissonance and is normalized and mythologized by processes we sh^ll describe later. Established structures lend security, familiarity, and confidence. Hence, normative upheavals and ideational revolutions are painful and relatively rare. The symbolon structure is the connecting agent between the ani-consciousness and energy-matter that is structured into a model of a phenomenon to be realized subsequently as an act of creation. The</page><page sequence="8">8 God as the shadow of man durability and longevity of symbolon structures are subject to natural selection and functional adaptability. In this domain, as in so many other Sisyphean dynamics of creation and entropy, Darwinian evolution reigns supreme.20 Once the mythogenic structure has been generated by projected experiences and yearnings and formed into a self-regulating configuration, it has a life of its own. Hence, a mythogene is ahistoric. We have already mentioned that there is no independent evidence for the outright accuracy of the biblical account of Moses or the Exodus. A recent study by an American archaeologist even concludes that the events recounted in the first ten books of the Old Testament can have no historical veracity.21 Hence, not only Moses, but also Saul, David, and Solomon are all fictional characters. But this is hardly relevant to our present context. The mythogenic structure obeys W.I. Thomas's basic theorem of social processes, according to which if man defines a situation as real, it becomes real in its consequences. Hence, if the mythogene has been projected, structured, and legitimized by a given group, it motivates man to generate cultural patterns by a process of revelation and creativity. LÃ©vi-Strauss defines how the mythic structure links nature and culture; we shall try also to show how the mythogenic structures are generated, grow, and decline. Indeed, mythogenes are generated, developed, and destroyed in a manner different from the growth and decline of historical entities. Leon Festinger has demonstrated how belief in prophets has increased just when their historical prophesies have failed.22 Likewise, the serious proselytizing by the followers of Christ started after his crucifixion, and so did proselytizing by the believers of Shabbatai Zevi, the self-proclaimed seventeenth-century Jewish messiah, after he converted to Islam. The mythogenic structure moves itself, and us its creators, in a feedback cycle of virtual reality - once we impute historical veracity to it and insist on incorporating it into our daily lives we are courting disaster. The numerous Christs, Napoleons, and Elvis Presleys in insane asylums are all individual instances of the deranging effects of historicizing myths, whereas the Nazis' reviving of the Elder Eddas and the Niebelungen Ring - and reliving them - was a catastrophic instance of this on a group level. Our first step in the study of mythology will be the exploration of its role in the development of the human personality. The Two Vectors We propose to describe here the two opposing vectors which form the core of our personality theory. These are the vectors of participation and separation. By participation we mean the identification of the self with a</page><page sequence="9">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 9 person or persons, an object, a life form, or a symbol outside the self, and the self striving to lose its separate identity by fusion with this external entity. Separation is the opposite vector and consists of aiming to sever and differentiate the self from surrounding lifeforms and objects. These opposing vectors, as the main axis of our theory, are developed in conjunction with three major developmental phases. First, the process of birth, an abrupt propulsion from the cushioned self-sufficiency of the womb into the strife and struggles of life outside, represents a major crisis and is, undoubtedly, recorded by the newborn's psyche; this is in addition to any physical pressures that the process of birth itself might impose on the cranium and the resultant effects on the various layers of the brain. We build our premises on those separating effects of birth which are universal. These in turn initiate the opposite vector of participation, which is a directional driving force, harnessing a diverse assortment of psychic energies towards union with given objects, life forms, or symbols. The newborn, who is physiologically and psychologically capable of recording these crises incidental to its birth, is traumatized by them into a lifelong quest for congruity and unification.23 The second process, that of separation, is the crystallization of an individual self through the molding of an ego boundary. The infant shrieks and kicks his way into the world, but still feels himself part and parcel of his surroundings. However, this holistic bliss is gradually destroyed by the harsh realities of hunger, thirst, discomfort, physical violence, and hard objects and by a mother who is mostly loving but sometimes nagging, apathetic, hysterical, overprotecting, or even rejecting. All this pushes the infant into forming a separate identity, that is, into leaving the common fold of unity with his environment and crystallizing an T. This individual self knows then that he is not part of, or with, but rather against, his surroundings. This realization of a separate self, resulting from a coerced departure from the security of engulfing togetherness, is registered by the developing psyche as a fall from grace. The process of separation continues in full force as a corollary to socialization, until one reaches the post-adolescent's adjustment to the mandates of the normative systems of society. The making of the responsible person, the stable human being, is achieved by constant indoctrination by the various socialization agencies: family, school, church, etc. These convey to him the harsh realities of life and urge him to grow up, with the help of some rigorous initiation rites. Thus is concluded the third developmental phase. The desire to overcome the separating and dividing pressures never leaves the human individual. The striving to partake in a unifying whole is ever-present and takes many forms: If one avenue toward its realization becomes blocked, it surges out through another.</page><page sequence="10">1 0 God as the shadow of man We have traced the various pressures towards separation in each developmental phase; each stimulus is registered by the embryo as a disturbance to be overcome. The various demands of its mother and others close to it, before and after such crystallization of the separate self, are also perceived as disquieting events, with which one must cope and come to terms. Later, the various demands of the socialization agencies to fit into the boundaries of the normative system, and so gain one's social identity and responsibility, serve as the semi-final or final separating pressures. After this, the individual is on his own, ontologically lonely and trying desperately to regain the togetherness of his lost fold. In this uphill climb, the individual may choose both legitimate and illegitimate paths, both acceptable and deviant avenues. After the primary biological separation of birth, the processes of separation and the ensuing developmental stages are affected by the deprivational interaction of the self with its surrounding objects. Following birth, the self-preservation instinct guards against the extinction of this new creature by inducing it to cry out for food and comfort. Yet, as we have pointed out, the crystallization of the separate 'I' is affected through interaction with the nipple that does not give food, and with the mother who does not ease all pain and alleviate all discomfort.24 In other words, if the neonate had all his needs immediately gratified, he would not emerge from his feeling of unity with his surroundings, which marks the infant's first year of life and which is denoted as early orality. This means that it is not the release of tension through the satisfaction of the biological needs which is the separating agent, but rather the conflictual interaction with a depriving object. Consequently, the primary separation of the self is not a corollary to instinctual need satisfaction, but an interactional phenomenon. Isaac And Iphigenia Similarly, we claim that social separation is not affected, as Freud and Erickson postulated, by psycho-sexual developmental phases, but rather by conflictual normative indoctrination and deprivational socialization within the family. These are exemplified by the various rites of passage studied by anthropologists, and by the lonely burdens of responsibility imposed on post-adolescents in every human society, so as to enable them to cope with the vicissitudes of adult life.25 In most cultures, the father or his surrogate is the vehicle of indoctrination, instrumental in imposing the various norms and duties on both daughter and son, thus preparing them for their social roles. Such imposition of normative duties on the son by his father has been described elsewhere as the Isaac Syndrome.26</page><page sequence="11">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 1 1 Whereas the initial victimization of the child at the oral stage of development is maternal, blocking the free expression of the child's incestuous desires, the second is paternal, coercing and harnessing the child into the normative system of society, of which the father is deemed the agent within the family. Usually this coercive normative victimization is backed by the absolute authority of God, the fatherland, or a secular political deity. As in the paradigm, the offering of Isaac, there is usually a symbiotic relationship between the stern, doctrinaire father and a metaphysical source of absolute authority. It is important to note that such continuing victimization of the child by his parents from early orality onwards is an integral part of the sÃ©parant process of development and socialization. Paternal victimization leads to the sÃ©parant insertion of the pubescent individual into a normative pigeonhole sanctioned by society. The mother is the symbol of grace. She stands for carefree participant longing for the forgiveness and irresponsibility of children within the family fold, prior to their harnessing within the normative burdens of society. In some tribes, such rites of passage from childhood to puberty as circumcision are presided over by the leaders, while the mothers join in the wailing of their sons.27 A mythological corroboration for the mother as the image of grace in the eyes of the pubescent son is found in the angel who orders Abraham not to slaughter Isaac. The angel is invariably depicted as female by the iconography of the offering of Isaac.28 It would not be farfetched, therefore, to regard the female angel as representing his mother, Sarah. The Isaac Syndrome is the paternal normative aggression of fathers against their sons.29 The main thrust of the myth of the offering of Isaac, however, lies in the sacrificial enmeshing of the young into the disciplinarian boundaries of the normative systems of society. All normative breaking in involves, to varying degrees, the curbing of the well-being and freedom of the pubescent for the good of the group. Literature abounds with the sacrificial coercion of children into the carnivorous exigencies of the normative system. Kafka's letters to his father reek of the agonies of a son being abused by his father in the name of bourgeois morality. Kafka's relationship with his father was, no doubt, the inspiration for his description in Metamorphosis of Mr. Sama, the petit bourgeois father who degrades his misfit son out of shame and fear of the social norms. Frank Wedekind, in his play The Awakening of Spring , portrays a father who justifies the commitment of his son to a notorious institution for juvenile delinquents by his conviction that the institution stresses and enhances Christian thought and logic. The boy's mother, like her archetypal image in the iconography of Isaac's offering, prays for grace and forgiveness. The mother laments that her son, basically a good boy, is bound to become a hardened criminal in the</page><page sequence="12">1 2 God as the shadow of man institution. But stern paternal judgment prevails, and the boy, Melchior, is confined to an institution for delinquents for the heinous crime of having had sex with a girl. Wedekind's play focuses on the sacrificial coercion of parents, namely the suppression of sexual manifestations in the name of social propriety, morality, and religion. Paternal sanction and raging admonition burst forth from Francis Bacon's portrait of The Screaming Pope?0 In this painting, Bacon takes Velasquez's serene portrait of Pope Innocent X seated in full regalia on his throne and covers it with the transparent projection of a frozen scream. The Pope's mouth is wide open, and it seems to emit shrieks of horror, howling curses, and shouts of damnation. Could this be the howls of Bacon's own authoritarian father when he found out that his adolescent son was a transvestite? By free association we could recall the recent televised interviews with Pope John Paul II whose benign face, that of a good-natured Polish peasant, became hard and stern whenever he reconfirmed the church's proscriptions of married priests, abortion, and homosexuality. Indeed, sex remains one of the normative strongholds of the church, perhaps because it sees in sexual roles God's choice media for the programming of humanity. The persistent proscription of free manifestations of sexuality, especially between consenting homosexual adults, induced John Money to label the official secular and religious authorities as sexual dictatorships hunting sexual heretics.31 Indeed, this is an extension of the Isaac Syndrome to the social and group levels, where the authoritarian figure of Abraham permeates the power structures of society and religion. Mothers often warn their children when they are naughty: 'You wait 'till Daddy comes home and I tell him what you were doing today.' The mother implies that she herself does not wield the normative rod, rather it is the role of the authoritarian figure in the family (i.e., the father) to mete out sanctions when due. The doctrinaire role of the father is directed equally towards the son and the daughter. The contents of the social norms imposed by paternal authority vary, however, with the sex of the child. The son is coerced, in most patriarchal societies, to undertake the burden of social responsibility, whereas the daughter is harnessed into her feminine roles of marriage, childbearing, and household duties. A partial feminine counterpart to the sacrificial rites of passage inherent in the Isaac Syndrome may be inferred from the Greek myth of Demeter-Kore. Zeus, Kore's father, was instrumental in ejecting his daughter from the family fold and the protection of her mother and in delivering her to his hellish brother, Hades.32 The implication here is that Kore was taken away from the protective care of her mother through the devices of her father and exposed to the trials of matrimonial servitude to</page><page sequence="13">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 1 3 her husband, an experience recorded by the pubescent Kore as coercive and infernal. Yet this is the social essence of a daughter's betrothal throughout most of history and in traditionalist societies even today. She is given in marriage to the appropriate husband as determined mainly by the political calculations, social expectations, and economic needs of her father. However, the most striking feminine parallel to the Isaac Syndrome, both in its gory sacrificial details and profound socio-normative implications, is seen in the sacrifice of Iphigenia (as dramatized by Euripides) to the exigencies of socio-religious commands through the authoritarian agency of her father, Agamemnon. Iphigenia is sacrificed to the glory of the group and to patriotic honor, which are extensions of the glory and honor of Agamemnon himself, in the same way that the normative authority of Abraham was the extension of divinity. Unlike Abraham, who never doubted God's commands, Agamemnon wavers and rages against the need to sacrifice his daughter for the glory of the army and the honor of the mob. This divergence stems from the difference in the Judaic and Greek conceptions of divine authority. For Abraham, God's commands were the epitome of justice, which could not be doubted, and should not be questioned, whereas the anthropomorphic Greek gods made no pretense of being just. In the case of Iphigenia, the Greeks knew that the gods were the arbiters of necessity and fate, which together made up the prime movers of the Greek religion and normative system. The outcome, however, was the same: both Isaac and Iphigenia were sacrificed to the divine projections of socio-normative mandates. According to the Midrash, the traditional and mythological interpretation of the Bible, Isaac ran joyfully to the alter and bound himself on it.33 Iphigenia, however, was not so willing a victim. In one of the most shattering monologues ever written, she pleads with Agamemnon: Had I the voice of Orpheus, O my father, If I could sing so that the rocks would move, If I had words to win the hearts of all, I would have used them; I have only tears. See, I have brought them! They are all my power, I clasp your knees, I am your suppliant now, I, your own child, my mother bore me to you. O, kill me not untimely! The sun is sweet! Why will you send me into the dark grave? I was the first to sit upon your knee, The first to call you father.34</page><page sequence="14">1 4 God as the shadow of man In the end, however, she accepts her fate and goes to the altar with the patriotic announcement, 'Bid my father come and touch the alter, which will this day bring victory and salvation unto Greece.'35 Like Sarah in the myth of the offering of Isaac, Clytaemnestra, Iphigenia's mother, is the figure of grace, condemning paternal cruelty as expressed in the divine mandate to sacrifice her daughter for the glory of Greece. The vicissitudes of social separation, the cruel rites of passage from childhood to puberty, the harsh coercion into the delimiting social norms and the sacrificial horrors of the Isaac and Iphigenia syndromes are all presided over by the father. They induce both male and female children to long for the cushioned forgiveness and lenient protection of mother. For the homosexual Proust, this longing became so intense that he enclosed himself into a padded, womb-like room and wrote volume after volume idealizing his beloved mother. For the fiercely heterosexual Camus, his great love for his mother may have turned into a generalized longing for the grace of womanhood rather than for a specific woman. Hence, Camus undertook a lifelong quest for the tender friendship of women.36 It might well be that the chivalrous adoration of ladies and the troubadours' odes to the graces of women during the Middle Ages were spurred by the insane trails of the hordes of cross-bearing warriors sacrificed to the waging of impossible wars by a stern absolutist God. The graceful, tender mother-woman was the vision of everything warm and merciful back home, in stark contrast to the squalor and death ordained by a graceless, unforgiving, and uncompromising fatherly God. It is worth noting that in the original Hebrew of the Bible, as well as in Aramaic and Syriac, the word grace, hessed , also means incestuous, or sinful.37 This shows that, etymologically, at least, the son's longing for his mother's grace appears to have sexual and incestuous undertones. This, of course, is a corollary to the suppressed, incestuous desire of the son for his mother at orality and its relation to the subconscious. Primarily, this might explain the attraction of boys to girls who remind them, directly or symbolically, of their mother, since the amatory and sexual longing for their mothers is blocked by the deeply internalized prohibition of their very early incestuous desires. The parallel attraction of daughters to men resembling their fathers in some relevant or vicarious characteristics might also be related to the dynamics of complementarity. The pubescent daughter, through identification with her mother, would be attracted to a complementary authoritarian figure linked to the normativeness of the father. Of course, these relationships vary in those families where the father is soft and benign, while the mother is harsh and authoritarian. The various combinations of identifications and permutations of complementary points between parents and children of the same and</page><page sequence="15">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 1 5 different sex are virtually endless, and the tracing of their effects on the choice of sexual partners is outside the scope of the present work. The Tantalus Ratio We have conceived our participation vector as the individual's quest at every particular moment in his life to revert to an earlier developmental phase: to the irresponsibility of pre-puberty, to the grace of the mother and the protection of the family fold, to the omnipresence of early orality and to the pre-natal bliss of non-being. This pull is countered by the instinctual and deprivational interaction vectors of separation, which except in the case of death, always have the upper hand. Yet the quest for participatory non-being is ever-present; we tend to agree with the hypothesis that, if man possessed a special master switch by means of which he could end his life at will, he would be bound to press it at one time or another. While the quest for participation manifests itself in numerous sublimatory substitutes, both institutionalized and deviant, actual participation is unattainable by definition. Proust could sensitively revive a lost childhood and a graceful mother though the hazy memories triggered by the taste of a madeleine bun, but even he could not recapture the actual sensations of things past. We are forever searching for our lost childhood, for our narcissistic paradise, but no one can actually revert to pre-puberty, reconstruct the omnipresence of early orality, or revive the sensation of blissful suspended animation in the amniotic fluid of the uterus. Participation is a fata morgana, shining hazily before our craving eyes, but ever-receding and never achieved. This objective impossibility of participation is augmented by the countervailing separating vectors, both instinctual and interactive. At any given moment of our lives, there is a disjuncture, a gap, between our yearning for participation and the subjectively defined distance from our participatory aims. We have denoted this gap the Tantalus Ratio, after the Olympian demi-god who, whenever he reached for fruit, saw it whirl out of his reach by a gust of wind, and, whenever he bent down to drink from a seemingly fresh and sparkling stream of water, discovered it to be black mud. Even if he succeeded in scooping up some water in his palm, it dripped through his fingers before he could cool his parched lips. The Tantalus Ratio creates a strain, a tension, between the longing for participation and the distance from it as perceived by the individual. This tension, the intensity of which is determined by the factors comprising the Tantalus Ratio, is the motivating force underlying an individual's action. On a rather low level of abstraction, we may envisage this tantalizing strain as the rabbit lure running in front of racing dogs or the proverbial carrot tied before the donkey's nose. This tantalizing strain is entirely</page><page sequence="16">1 6 God as the shadow of man different in nature from the opposing vectors that comprise the Tantalus Ratio. It is generated within the synaptic junctions of these opposing vectors and is released by the individual's motivational movement towards participatory goals or their sublimated alternatives. In other words, the participatory and separating vectors provide the crude psychic energy, whereas the Tantalus Ratio and the strain generated by it provide the motivational directions for the individual's actual behavior. This tantalizing tension may be either conscious or subconscious, and its operation is checked by acquired norms and by various internal personality mechanisms. Our hypothesis is that the psychic bases which underlie these mechanisms are generated by the anxieties registered at each consecutive stage of separation. Because each developmental stage from birth onwards is experienced as a painful separation, accompanied by deprivational interaction, the personality clings to the stability afforded by its present condition, by way of recoiling from a developmental change for the worse, leading to more radical separateness. The mechanisms are, therefore, 'the devil I know' defenses, which cause the personality to adhere to stable states as lesser evils. We have already mentioned that the actual reversal to previous developmental stages is a practical impossibility and that all the techniques of participation, both institutionalized and deviant, cannot quench the intense longing for participation fueled by the individual's memories of his earlier participatory developmental stages. This means that the Tantalus Ratio, and the tension generated by it, produce formidable energies, which are ever augmented and kindled by the impossibility of slaking the individual's thirst for participation. The gist of our premise is that the Tantalus Ratio is most powerful at the outset of life and decreases in potency with each developmental stage, until it wanes to a low ebb in old age. The strength of the Tantalus Ratio is related first of all to the enormity of the separating forces of early childhood, which cause the participation vectors to muster countervailing pressures of corresponding potency. Second, the closeness in time of separating developmental events makes for vivid memories and sharply focused images of the lost participatory bliss. The child's frantic efforts to regain its bliss would, therefore, be marked by a desperate surge of power aimed at reversing the raw grief of the recent developmental calamity. These efforts are not yet mellowed by the sad knowledge, brought about by experience, that direct participatory reversals are impossible. The separation of birth, registered by the neonate as a catastrophe, is marked by frantic efforts to survive.38 The mouth-ego of the infant searches for the nipple, or for anything that will provide nourishment. This factor, as well as the enormous pressures of growth at this hectic stage of development, leads to the formation of the</page><page sequence="17">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 1 7 biological vectors of separation, which are at the height of their potency. And yet this is also the stage at which the neonate experiences the strongest craving to revert back to his mother's womb, from which he was so brutally expelled just a short while ago, into an existence where mere survival involves effort and pain. This would be in keeping with what Schachtel denotes as the 'Law of Embeddedness'. The more complete an organism's state of embeddedness, the less it wants to stir from its state of quiescent equilibrium with its environment.39 This means that the more violent the separating disturbance, the more powerful the corresponding striving for participation. And what is more violent than the separating expulsion of birth? Indeed, we claim that what Bowlby has denoted as the 'instinct of clinging' of the primate to its mother, as well as the less corporeal attachment of the human infant to his mother or father surrogate, can be linked to the neonate's desire to regain physical union with his mother in her womb.40 This might provide the motive underlying the clinging behavior of both primate and human infants, apart from the functional desire of the young to be close to the source of their nourishment and protection.41 The second major phase of separation, the coagulation of the distinct 'I', is marked by the introduction of the deprivational interaction with the object into the battling forces of the Tantalus Ratio. At the oral stage, these objects are the mother, the breast, and the nipple. Indeed, the ego boundary, which separates the self from the totality of early orality, is nothing other than scar tissues which surround the individual self, as a result of its deprivational interaction with its surrounding objects. We have relied elsewhere on the oralist offshoot of psychoanalysis to describe the mouth ego of early orality as aiming to empty the object mother's breast, whereas at the later, biting, oral stage the mouth ego, in fits of rage, wants to destroy the non-obliging object (mother).42 The Fixation of Personality Types Personality traits and types are centered on the key concept of fixation, which is, undoubtedly, Freudian in origin. Unfortunately, neither Freud nor his disciples sufficiently clarified the mechanisms of fixation, as far as uninitiated outsiders are concerned, though it seems to have been a central concept in psychoanalytic theory and practice. According to the original Freudian formulation, psycho-sexual energy is directed towards the erogenous zones, which also represent the major psycho-sexual development phases.43 When parents or their surrogates over-indulge an infant, or severely deprive him at any given developmental phase, he will muster a relatively large amount of psycho-sexual energy to overcome the frustrations thus generated. He will also harness such energies to create</page><page sequence="18">1 8 God as the shadow of man alternative, defensive outlets, the normal manifestations of which have been blocked. Consequently, the growth processes will be arrested or injured at that developmental phase, since the psycho-sexual energies have been expanded to erect defenses against the conflictual interaction with the parents, instead of building the infant's personality. Freud himself was not clear as to the nature of fixation and took too many things for granted, claiming: The unconscious knows no time limit. The most important, as well as the most peculiar, character of psychic fixation consists in the fact that all impressions are, on the one hand, retained in the same form as they were received, and also in the forms that they have assumed in their further development. This state of Ã¡ffairs cannot be elucidated by any comparison from any other sphere. By virtue of this theory, every former state of the memory content may thus be restored, even though all original relations have long been replaced by newer 44 ones. Freud's unconscious psyche would appear to be the perfect data bank, one which stores all impressions, as well as all possible interactions of these impressions, with past and future ones in a timeless progression. A fixation is, thus, an anchor of sorts on a given context of these impressions, but how this anchoring comes about, Freud does not say. We propose, therefore, an explanation based on our exposition of the developmental phases of the personality core.45 If the processes of transition from one developmental phase to the next, which are deprivational in essence, are more painful at a given developmental phase than the modal degree of pain, as perceived by the individual's own experience, ruptures or developmental wounds are formed, which psychic energies then rush to mend. To be more precise: We envisage the developmental processes as an interplay between the separating forces of growth and interaction and the participating urge to revert back to an earlier developmental phase. It is energy resulting from the dynamic interplay between these vectors that is the Tantalus Ratio. However, if the separating effects of the deprivational interaction are too intense or violent at any given time, the developmental process is temporarily disconnected. The participation vector and the energies of the Tantalus Ratio repair the injury by covering it with developmental scar tissue, as on a wound. Yet the wound itself and the tender coats of scar tissue are still exposed to conflict and more pressure, since the deprivational interaction of the nascent ego with its surroundings is a continuous process. Consequently, the ever-thickening layers of scar tissue which result from the trauma of fixation are more like a corn on a toe. The psychic energy centers around the traumatized developmental</page><page sequence="19">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 1 9 scar, covering it with excessive mental imprints, very much like the whirl loops of the corn, which form a lump protruding from the skin. The corn is painful, not only because of the pressure, but because the excessive scar tissue makes it all the more vulnerable. Because of the trauma, the whole area is sensitive. This metaphor illustrates the nature of fixation. It is the combined outcome of the traumatizing injury and the excessive and frantic patching of layers of developmental scar tissue through the psychic energies of the Tantalus Ratio. The harsher the trauma, the thicker the layers of defensive scar tissue. The separate ego emerges out of non-differentiated early orality, through its deprivational interaction with the mother's breast and surrounding objects. The resulting boundary around the self is also an example of developmental scar tissue, but a fixation is an over-traumatized developmental experience, which is more conspicuous and more sensitive, and, consequently, more vulnerable than the rest of the developmental texture of the personality. We should point out here that our conceptualization of fixation, as distinct from Freud's, is not related to pathological regressions, but to the crystallization of character traits and personality types. We hold further that regression is not conditioned by fixation, but is rather a defensive flight to an earlier developmental phase, the longing for which is ever present in the participation vector of our personality core. When the dynamic balance of the Tantalus Ratio is disturbed by the separating pressure of growth, or when the individual's interpersonal relationships suffer a disrupting blow, the counter-pressures of participation thus released catapult the individual to visions of pre-pubic havens and blissful dreams of early orality. Fixation is, therefore, a developmental dam which traps both the disrupting blows of traumatizing interaction and the countering defenses of the Tantalus Ratio. The anchoring of personality traits on the fixation is the result of this massive concentration of painful experiences and heaping of defenses in frantic disarray. One is aware of a hand or a tooth only when they are painful, and one always feels a blow on a sore, because the same blow to normal tissue is negligible. Consequently, the severity of fixation is related to the magnitude of the developmental trauma and the corresponding intensity of defenses mustered by the Tantalus Ratio. The Sisyphean and the Tantalic Birth is, no doubt, an explosive event, whose archetype in mythology is the act of creation itself. Yet this colossal event is not registered by a separate self-awareness. Not until later orality does a separate self-image emerge out of a non-differentiated mass, when the T is confronted by the</page><page sequence="20">20 God as the shadow of man surrounding objects. This is the baseline from which the self emerges out of the total being of early orality and the circumference of the self is defined by the non-self. This is an existential revolution, which is registered by the individual as a separating catastrophe. We propose, therefore, a personality typology anchored on this developmental dichotomy of pre- and post-differentiation of the self. The molding process is expressed in the nature and severity of the fixation, which in turn determines the placement of a given individual on the personality type continuum. However, the types themselves are fixated by developmental chronology - i.e., whether the fixating trauma occurred before or after the separation of the self. We denote a personality that was fixed before the formation of the self as a participant or Tantalic type, after the mythical Greek demigod whose punishment we have already described. If the traumas fixate personality after the crystallization of the self, the Sisyphean (sÃ©parant) type is bound to emerge. This Sisyphean type is related to a Greek mythical demigod, who was punished by having to roll a stone to the top of a hill. Whenever he neared the summit, the stone rolled down and Sisyphus had to start pushing it all over again. The Tantalic type is operation-bound, ever visualizing and longing for the all-inclusive early orality, while the Sisyphean type is always entangled with the vicissitude of the object. The sÃ©parant Sisyphus anchors on the inter-relationship with the object, whereas the participant Tantalus seeks the blissful fruits of mystical union. These are the passions kindling the vectors of our personality types. However, Sisyphus's object keeps rolling down and Tantalus's mystical finit forever recedes before his eyes. This is the essence, and the irony, of the Tantalus Ratio: Its strength is measured by unachieved aims, because its fulfillment is not only impossible, but also tantamount to impotence. The Ani, Atznti, Ity , and the Self The concept of the self involves consistency and continuity, so that the same self is felt and defined by an individual from the moment his separate awareness coagulates until death. The exceptions to the principle of consistency and continuity are cases of madness or the temporary dissolution, or weakening, of the self in extreme cases of hallucinations or mystical experiences. The self, therefore, is the consistent and continuous inner sameness of the individual vis-Ã -vis his environment. This inner sameness element of our definition has, no doubt, an Ericksonian flavor to it.46 But for Erickson, 'ego identity' is the meaning of this inner sameness to others, whereas for us, the self is the structured barrier between the separate individual, as conceived by the individual himself, and everything - flora,</page><page sequence="21">The M ythogene and the Myth of the Logos 2 1 fauna, and inanimate objects - that are excluded from the confines of this barrier. We propose to denote the participant core of the self by the Hebrew word ani. The translation of ani is 'I', but in kabbalist doctrine, ani (w) and ain (rx) (nothingness), which have the same Hebrew letters but in different order, are interchangeable and synonymous. Consequently, the ani, the 'I', which longs for participant non-being, is the Tantalic objectless component of the self. We shall denote our interactive object-related component of the self with the Hebrew word atzmi (ray) which may be translated into English as 'myself. Its root, however, is etzem , (mro) 'object', which makes it appropriate for its definitional task. For us, the self is the essence that defines its being both for itself and for others. The atzmi is the interactive, relational self reaching outward towards the object, whereas the ani transcends spatio-temporality and reaches inwards towards the pre-differentiated unity. It is important to point out that the atzmi must have a subject and an object, a perceiver and a perceived. There is a continuous flow of perception to the atzmi from flora, fauna, and inanimate objects. The atzmi may also perceive the body and the ani, the ontological self, as objects. The ani, on the other hand, need not have an object. In concentrated meditation, in some mystical experiences, in some forms of madness, in drug-induced euphoria, and sometimes in orgasm, the ani has no awareness of itself as a being separate from its surroundings. The boundaries of the self may also melt away, and temporary objectless unity may be achieved. The atzmi is by definition a relational entity; therefore, its interaction with its surroundings may be studied in terms of stimulus, response, association, and correlation. Not so the ani, which in its pure form is objectless and non-relational; measures of logic, deduction, and inference do not apply to it. If we wish to study the whole human being, and not only fragments of it, we have to rely on intuition, introspection, and even meditation in order to grasp the ani component of the self and, therefore, fully understand the dual nature of our personality. Our study of personality is, therefore, holistic and synthetic, not analytic, in contrast to the main thrust of contemporary behavioral science. We have pointed out elsewhere that the crystallization of the self out of the non-self is, in effect, a process of tearing away region after region of the original omnipresence of the neonate. This process continues until the separate atzmi is placed within the specific boundaries of its spatio-temporality and the confines of compelling social norms.47 The essence of the ani, i.e., that which constitutes the being of the ani - pure self - precedes the existence, that which constitutes the</page><page sequence="22">22 God as the shadow of man emergence or manifestation, of the atzmi, interactive self. We have pointed out earlier that the non-differentiated entity before birth and at early orality is an omnipresent, timeless, and infinite essence, which is then separated and confined within spatio-temporality by its deprivational interaction with its surroundings. This timeless essence, when embedded with the separate individual, is not a metaphysical, but rather a natural, phase of human development. Our conception of the ani is in line with Husserl' s later writings, in which he postulates a pure ego and says that the knowledge of possibilities (inherent in the pure ego) must precede that of actualities.48 In a similar manner, the logically non-verifiable essence of the objectless ani differs from Husserl's pure ego, because it relates to experience and not to theoretical, a priori transcendence. The contents of the ani and the atzmi, as well as their relative preponderance with a given personality, are, of course, related to the participant and sÃ©parant personality core vectors, the developmental fixations, and the given culture in which the individual is socialized. Finally, we present the ity, which is Hebrew for 'with me'. The ity is the synthesizer of the dialectical conflicts within the self, between the unity-bound ani and the interactive atzmi. The ity is the structured Tantalus Ratio within the self. Its synthesizing function makes it the coordinator of human action, and as such it has a lot in common with Freud's ego. The magnitude and relative preponderance of the poles on our self-continuum are related to the developmental factors of the personality core. A violent early oral fixation, a quietisi participant culture, and a Tantalic preoccupation at old age will contribute to the predominance of the ani within the self-continuum. Conversely, a sÃ©parant fixation on the object, during a period of vigorous growth in an active-Sisyphean culture, will make for an overpowering atzmi. The strength or weakness of the coordinating ity will then determine its ability to contain the self within the dynamic system in balance. The ani is mostly unconscious, because its source is anchored in pre-differentiated non-awareness, when the space and time of consciousness have not yet developed. Some of the ani is pre-conscious or semi-conscious, while only a few of its manifestations are conscious. Even when the ani is conscious, it lurks more on the peripheries of awareness in a dÃ©jÃ  vu-like experience. The atzmi, on the other hand, is largely conscious, partly pre-conscious (as in many semi-automatic functions we perform in daily life) and only rarely unconscious, as in some religious ecstasies or in drug-induced euphoria, which partly dissolves the ego boundary. The ideal ani is timeless, spaceless, and without the sequences of logic and inference. These are generated by the interactive atzmi and structured</page><page sequence="23">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 23 within the Tantalus Ratio by the coordinating ity. This stems from our basic premise that the ani is dominated by a flow of intuition. The atzmi is intentional and attentive to the sequences of experiences and memory, which make for a distinction of before and after, and hence for the sequences of time. The ani on the other hand, is suspended in a Bergsonian Duree-like flow of a continuous present.49 The ani is also spaceless. It projects onto transcendence archetypes such as the Upanishadic Purasha, the kabbalist adam kadmon, and the Gnostic 'primordial man'. This holistic view of the universe, characteristic of ani-dominated mystics, regards the discrete, pluralistic image of reality, perceived by the atzmi as partial, not unlike the eyesight of an alcoholic whose retina has been damaged by methylated spirits. Still, the perception of space is effected through the relationships and interaction of the components of the self with surrounding objects. Like time, space is generated by the interactive dynamics of the Tantalus Ratio and structured by the regulating dialectics of the ity. The ani, not being relational, is not necessarily governed by rules of causality. Causal simultaneity and synchronicity may be acceptable to the ani as different manifestations of the same phenomenon, stemming from one source. The ani may be reached experientially through meditation, mystical experiences, or the catalysis of drug-induced peak experiences. Logic is inapplicable as a means of discovering the ani; intuition rather than deliberate attention is the proper medium for the unveiling it. Conversely, space, time, and causality are inherent in the relational nature of the atzmi. We envisage a dialectical conflict within the Tantalus Ratio of the self, which provides the motivation for the inclusion, i.e., the swallowing of the object by the outward reaching atzmi which, with the help of the coordinating ity, devises surrogate modes of inclusion, which manifest themselves as socially acceptable or deviant object relationships. The ity, through constant dialectical conflicts amongst the components of the self and its environment, creates a system-in-balance which holds the personality in a dynamic equilibrium. The main attributes of our atzmi, the interactive component of the self, are based, first of all, on the discrete perception of space and linear perception of time. The perception of the rhythm of time may, of course, vary from one person to another and may also be heightened or blurred ^by drugs. Nevertheless, only the linear sequence of past, present, and future is perceived meaningfully by the atzmi. The necessity of time and space for the objects of the atzmi underlies its need for logic, symbolism (language), causality, association, and inference in its interaction with other people and things. Social norms are then incorporated within the self, by the coordinating functions of the ity. The atzmi, in contrast to the</page><page sequence="24">24 God as the shadow of man holistic flow of the intuition of the ani, operates by soberly focusing attention on the object and relating to it intentionally. The atzmi is basically an omnivore which aims to swallow the object and, thus, regain the exclusive omnipotence it lost when ejected from Eden-like orality. The dynamics of the ity, the regulating dialectical system-in-balance of the self, are different in our model from those of the ego or Freud. For him, the ego is an executive, making independent decisions and sending out orders over the psychic intercom. Jung regards his ego as an army commander presiding over the sessions of his general staff. For the ego psychologists, the ego has an autonomous standing which does not stem from the basic drives and the core components of the personality. Our ity is different. It is the dialectical force-field created by the turbulence and pressures from without and within. An instance of this, on a micro level, is a ping-pong ball held in one place on a billiard table by opposing streams of air and, on a macro level, the fixed courses of stellar bodies. The position, strength, and balance of the regulating ity are a function of the potency of the conflicting personality components and a measure of their inability to attain their contradictory goals. Let us recall then: the brain records the highly receptive amnestic years; events that transpired in those first years of life are projected, inter alia, as myths of cosmology; myths as personal history may be regarded as the account of crucial developments in the formative years; moreover, human development in the early formative years passes in an accelerated manner through the whole evolutional phases, and myths are also a projection of the development of the species as inherent in the development of the human individual. As the ani-consciousness is a universal unity which is reflected in all consciousness, it may account for the universal basis of some myths, e.g., the proverbial 'Fall from Grace', the sacrificing of the young gods, the slaying of the (incestuous) snakes, the breaking of the cosmic vessels (birth), as well as the unitary God. The plurality of consciousnesses, on the other hand, provides mythology with the projection of experiential myths as well as the plurality of gods and forces projected by the historical experiences and the Sisyphean forces of nature. Tantalus and Sisyphus in reality do not forgive because they do not judge and because each event dents the cosmos in an irreversible manner. They also have no regrets because each event dents the inner intensity of the authentic experience and counts, not its outward 'success' or 'failure'. One discards the obscuring veils of Maya, evades the violent spirals of the demiurgos, and drops the cozy filters of bourgeois slumber and stands drawn, tense, and ready in the eye of the storm. There, in naked, defenseless desperation a cry of anguish of a kindred soul may reach the inner self. If answered, the miracle of a dialogue of grace may yet transpire.</page><page sequence="25">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 25 The Viable Mythogenes For the mythogene to exist and to continue to survive, its structure must have a homeostatic system-in-balance; otherwise it would disrupt. Since in content the mythogenic structure contains elements of the divergent entities which it aims to connect, stable modus vivendi within the structure would have to be attained, which only then becomes viable and effective as a linking agent. The mythogenic contents of the structure may have various quantities, qualities, and proportions of ani-consciousness energy-matter participant myths of yearning and sÃ©parant myths of experience, but the mythogene within the structure must have a system-in-balance; otherwise it would not be viable, durable, or functional in effecting a link between divergent qualities. There is a basic dualism between the ani and the totality of energy-matter, whose universal potential is the first singularity, the ani mentioned in the previous section. This ani singularity is the pin-point center of blackholes reflected in all the individual singularity potentials of energy-matter. This reflection is holonic, a term invented by Arthur Koestler to denote a hierarchy of sub-wholes. Koestler says: The point first to be emphasized is that each member of this hierarchy, on whatever level, is a sub-whole or Holon in its own right - a stable, integrated structure equipped with self-regulatory devices and enjoying a considerable degree of autonomy or self-government. Cells, muscles, nerves, organs, all have their intrinsic rhythms and patterns of activity, often manifested spontaneously and without external stimulation; they are subordinated as parts to the higher centers of the hierarchy, but at the same time function as quasi-autonomous wholes. They are Janus-faced. The face turned upward, toward the higher levels, is that of a dependent part; the faced turned downward, towards its own constituents, is that of a whole of remarkable self-sufficiency.50 This system-in-balance is universal and stems from the holonic quality of life forms and objects. We postulate that the nuclei of atoms are held together by a system-in-balance between the strong nuclear force and the countervailing force of protons; the electromagnetic forces and Pauli's exclusion principle hold the atom in equilibrium by forces which we lack the ability or understanding to examine. In the Myth of Tantalus , we showed how the human personality is held in equilibrium by its participant and sÃ©parant core vectors.51 We hold that this tendency towards equilibrium, found both in inanimate objects and in life forms, is necessary both for their space-time existence and evolutionary survival. If we return to the particle, so long as the system-in-balance holds, so does</page><page sequence="26">26 God as the shadow of man the particle. Once that system is disrupted, a particle may decay into other particles or revert back to a suppressed, wave-like form. Following our method in the present work, we shall trace some of the mytho-empirical anchors for the necessity of a system at equilibrium for both life forms and objects on all levels of existence. The idea that a certain order, equilibrium, or balance constitutes a necessary condition for the existence of objects is not new. The Greek of the word 'cosmos', literally 'order', is the root of cosmetics, the art of ornamentation. This exemplifies the sÃ©parant Greek ethos of the world as being based on order and aesthetics. The pre-Socratic dialectics of Heracleites were adopted by Hegel, and through him by Marx, to create a new world order, a nÃ¨w cosmos, through revolution. A similar strategy was adopted by Li Ta-Chao (1889-1927), one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, when he transferred the Confucian idea of a universal harmony and order (Ta-t'ung) to the Communist order which would prevail in China after the revolution. These are Sisyphean cycles of chaos, order, revolution, new order, new chaos etc., spiraling aimlessly ad infinitum. The system-in-balance is technical and yet valueless, instrumental but arbitrary, consisting of social and physical controls. These are the organizational controls of meden agan (nothing in excess) and anankÃ© (the coercion of the physical equilibria). The latter even keeps the heavenly bodies in their orbit and will push them back if they commit the hiibris of deviating from it. Ordnung muss sein , the Germanic version of the Greek sÃ©parant maxims, exalts order as a meta-law for man and universe. The participant system-in-balance is the clandestine core dialectic of yearning, which especially characterizes the kabbala. The copulation - Zivug - of the cherubim in the Holy of Holies, is postulated by the kabbala.52 The Talmud , which we hold to be a mytho-empirical projection of the core dialectics of yearning as the prime mover of both man and god, would seem to have permeated the Freudian notion of the core psycho-sexuality of man.53 In a similar vein, the participant Judaic ethos of a system-of-balance of core dialectics could have permeated the thinking of Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss on formulating his basic notions of structuralism. The model of structuralism, shown in figure 1.1, postulates that the space equilibrium of the routine operation of individuals is of particular interest:</page><page sequence="27">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 27 Haut Gauche Ego Droite Bas Figure l.l54 This is very similar to the kabbalist model of the holonic system-in-balance represented by the emanated sefirot in a didactic equilibrium, as shown in figure 1.2. Hessed, 'grace', represents the right; din , 'judgment', is the left, or sinister side of stern judgment, and tiferei , 'glory', occupies the dialectical synthetic middle. Many scholars have studied the homeostatic and balancing mechanisms in biology and the equilibrium of forces in physics, especially in quantum mechanics.55 These subjects lie outside the scope of the present work, but we shall deal with the system-in-balance that applies to man - transcendent relationships, as well as to the Munchausen-like self-regulating mechanisms inherent in revelation and creativity. din hessed tiferei hod yesod netzah malchut Figure 1.2 Atlas embodies the mytho-empirical projection of the system-in-balance between God and Creation, in that he was entrusted with the maintenance of the pillars linking heaven and earth. He also provides a mytho-empirical anchor for the system-in-balance between man and creation. Atlas, the Titan or the man-god, is depicted by Hesiodos as holding heaven on his head and his hands.56 Etymologically, 'atlas' means 'very enduring.' The tense creator holding the globe or the Sisyphean stone on his head must be attuned to his task in a dynamic, yet precarious, equilibrium. Even a slight disturbance may break the creator's concentration. Effective creativity is, therefore, a combined mytho-empirical projection of both Sisyphus and Atlas. The first represents the object relationship inherent in creativity, and the second the system in equilibrium required to carry it out. Indeed, the</page><page sequence="28">28 God as the shadow of man system-in-balance between the core vectors would seem to be a precedent condition for the functioning of God and man. The absence of a system-in-balance on the biological level disrupts the physical homeostasis and may cause sickness and death. A disjuncture of the core vectors on the personality level may cause structural personality defects or even madness. The disintegration of the individual may lead to anomie, deviance, or crime. Structurally, all singularities are formed in the image of the first singularity; this is the essence of the expansive nature of energy matter. However, the pure ani is always a single unity. It is reflected as consciousness, which is deterministically encased in all artifacts, from the first wheel to the most sophisticated computer. The ani is existentialist, because we feel it as the essence of our being without any further proof. As such, it is as, or even more real, than any physical reality proven by an experiment or a mathematical equation. The ani-unity, as the underlying spiritual essence of all objects and life forms, forms the basis of mythology, theology, and mysticism which equate the ani-unity with God. Hence, God's name, Yehowva, a contraction of the Hebrew for T am that I am', applies to both God and man. The repetition of the word eheyeh in the Exodus passage as interpreted by the Kabbala, means that God and man reflect each other, or, more precisely, that God is the reflection of the (inner) man. The ani, as the unique consciousness at the core of all objects and life forms, is one, and the transcendental project of this uniqueness is the unity of God. It filters through the objects and life forms in a kaleidoscopic manner, so that it fits the peculiarities of a specific life form or object. This is the meaning of the Theosophic Kabbala' s statement that both God and man consist of lights and containers (vessels). The light stems from the unity of infinity, while the containers are the bodies which contain the lights. The kaleidoscopic flowing of divinity into and through objects and life forms explains the paradox of plurality in unity. Plurality has an infrastructure of unity, yet the appearances and perceptions of all life forms and objects are plural. This might also explain why God created man in His own image - the one inner image permeating every thing and every creature. Thus, the divine inner essence of the plurality of creatures and things is identical, and only its outer garments differ from one another in endless permutations, so that object and life form is unique. This is a reflection of the uniqueness of God, even within plurality each Ã©manant senses a unique entity vis-Ã -vis the unitarian uniqueness of the emanator. The timeless, spaceless, and attributeless ani, though unique, is present in all life forms and may also be present in objects and artifacts as contained (canned) consciousness.</page><page sequence="29">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 29 The ani, the holonic potential of energy-matter, is a singularity, a point in the infinite matter density, infinite temperature and infinite space-time curvature.57 There is a degree of consensus that a singularity was the potential ani of the Big Bang, as well as other white holes explosions. A singularity is also the ultimate fate of the Big Crunch and other dynamics, such as matter collapsing into black holes. All singularities are surrounded by an event horizon, the boundaries of extreme gravity, from which even light itself cannot escape.58 We hold this event horizon to be the curtain from which energy emanates into history. Right after the Big Bang there was total symmetry and uniformity of energy, and the four fundamental forces of gravitation, the weak force, the electromagnetic force and the strong force were not yet differentiated. The universe was filled with an undifferentiated soup of matter and radiation, each particle of which collided very rapidly with the other particles. Despite its rapid expansion, the universe was in a state of nearly perfect thermal equilibrium.59 Thus, in the beginning, all was symmetric, isomorphic, and the phenomena were created by synthesizing ani-consciousness and energy-matter as a means for the subsequent creation. More than anything else, man is a manufacturer of symboloi. These are the connecting agents between the ani-consciousness and energy-matter structured into a model of a phenomenon to be realized subsequently by an act of creation. Man's atzmi, his interactive self, synthesizes symboloi by connecting his ani-consciousness with well-defined diffuse parts of his environment. The Logos, when directed at an object, became fixated as a name tag or symbol. Man was a name-caller for God, and whatever name he gave to a creature became the symbol by which it was known (Gen. 2:19). The symbol stems from the Greek symbolon , which was originally a bone broken in two, with each part given to the two parties to a contract. The perfect fit of the parts of the bone was the ultimate evidence, like fingerprints, for the existence of the contract. Hence, the symbol evolved from a linking function. Therefore, the word - the Logos - when structured into a symbol, became a connecting agent, entering into a dialogue moving through and by the Logos into a creative interaction with chaos, the formless flow of energy matter. These mythogenic structures precede any act of creation which involves the integration of consciousness and energy-matter, be it a poem, a painting, or a quantum particle. All integrations of consciousness and energy taking place on the quantum level cannot be consciously perceived and remembered by creatures, because they take place in the unconscious, yet very likely in the processes of memory, thought, intuition, and emotion. These are all based on micro-dynamics taking place on the quantum level behind the</page><page sequence="30">30 God as the shadow of man uncertainty barrier. These basic processes are integrated, however, within the personality of the ani-consciousness and are, hence, projected onto mythology as experiential myths. Scientific analysis of mythology may divulge information, not only on the personality structure and social character, but also on quantum mechanics. The ani-consciousness is indeterministic. It has an existentialist freedom of choice which it imbues in all life forms. We hold that, in its own fashion, even a tree makes an indeterministic choice to push its roots in one direction rather than another. However, no artifact has a free choice, because its creator has implanted in it, by means of a symbolon structure, a consciousness geared to perform certain tasks. Hence, it is imbued with a deterministic contained consciousness. This idea was expressed by the Basht, who taught that a man infuses his power into everything he creates. Both a paleolithic spearhead and the most sophisticated computer have a deterministic contained consciousness. They cannot perform differently than they have been designed to by their creator. The guiding maxim of computer experts as to the cybernetic aptitude of their charges is 'garbage in, garbage out.' The contained consciousness in artifacts is the intention which guided its creation - the performance of a certain set of tasks. One of the most important differences between the contained consciousness of artifacts, and the indeterministic ani-consciousness of life forms, especially of man, is that the latter can experience revelation, whereas the former (the spearhead, the computer) cannot. However complex the hardware of a computer may be, however sophisticated its software, it can only carry out the tasks it was programmed to perform deterministically. Creatures, on the other hand, have freedom of will, and this to our mind is the basis of their indeterministic abilities, as well as their capacity to experience revelation. We look at a picture by Van Gogh. It strikes us with an overwhelming potency a century after his death. The same may be said of a novel by Dostoevski or a concerto by Bach. The consciousness of an artist is contained in his work and transferred to it through the creative act. These are merely well-known cases; we claim that all creation is a dialectic between consciousness and matter as mediated by the symbolon structure. The disturbance of the equilibrium within the object may lead to its falling apart and, on the universal level, to a Big Bang. A disharmony or maladjustment of a life form vis-Ã -vis its environment may lead to its evolutionary failure to adapt. Disruption between man and transcendence is represented by the Gnostic plane and the Theosophic Kabbalist feeding of the kelipot , eventually leading to the disjunction of the inner equilibrium within the Godhead and the catastrophe of the breaking of the vessels.60 The system-in-balance between core vectors thus seems to be, a</page><page sequence="31">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 3 1 universal principle of existence and creativity. This is attested to by both the mystic book of Zohar and the Lurianic kabbala. The 'Kings' in the Zohar died because of a disjuncture between hessed and din.61 In our model this stands for a disruption between the core vectors of separation and participation. If he has no inner system-in-balance, man is incapable either of creativity or meaningful dialogue with God or his fellow man. Of special importance is the error of Pistis Sophia: The Sophia, who is called the Pistis, wished to accomplish a work alone without her mate. And her work became an image of heaven. There is a curtain between the aeons above and the aeons which are below. And a shadow came into existence below the curtain. And that shadow became matter. And that shadow was cast into a region, and its form became a work in matter like an abortion.62 The essence of the demiurgos is that it deems itself self-sufficient in a solipsistic manner. Evil considers itself to be all alone in the world, and hence, everything does, or should, belong to it. Without a dialogue, one is blind to the other. Without the core dialogue of energy, without the Kabbalist zivug, there can be no viable creation; without a system-in-balance between the holonic dualities within an individual, there is a risk of madness and death, while the lack of equilibrium within divinity may lead to error and hÃ¼bris. The hÃ¼bris of the deities abounds in Greek mythology. Prometheus acted alone without heeding the counsel of his fellow gods, thus disrupting the equilibrium of creation by purveying fire to man, conferring him with an advantage in instrumental manipulation and domination over other life forms. When we consider the sorry mess which many generations of man's polluting and violent sovereignty have made of our planet, we tend to agree with the Olympians. Very likely, Prometheus himself, if he is still chained to his rock, is at this very minute striking his chest with his fist in atonement for such an act of hÃ¼bris. While Prometheus committed an instrumental Sisyphean act of hÃ¼bris, Icarus was guilty of a Tantalic participant act of hÃ¼bris. His search for revelation induced him to soar too high, and his inadequate wings were exposed to the scorching light of the sun (the demiurgical fire), causing him to fall to the sea and drown. In order to experience revelation one must evade direct epistemic exposure to the demiurgos. Icarus' father, Daedalus, counseled him not to fly too high or too low (to be a system in equilibrium), but rather to experience revelation right in the middle of the eye of the storm, but because of his hÃ¼bris, Icarus exposed himself to the demiurgos and was scorched by it. In man, hÃ¼bris is even more lethal. Any biological, personal, or social conspicuousness has been held in</page><page sequence="32">32 God as the shadow of man many different societies and eras to be a sign of hÃ¼bris, was tagged as deviance, and was treated accordingly. It should be clear that the characteristics rendering the object conspicuous are not necessarily themselves negatively valued. In ancient Greece, where policy making was quite often realistic, stigmatization by ostracism was achieved by 'chipping off the tallest ears of corn' (i.e., those who seemed to be more conspicuous than necessary). The question asked from the assembly in a manner quite relevant to our context was: 'Is there any among you who you think is dangerous to the state? If so, who?' In other words, we have here conspicuity and danger used almost as synonyms. Greek tragedy shows, in many instances, that stigma befalls a person who is too conspicuous, too wealthy, too successful, or too wise, thereby bringing on himself the jealousy of men and gods alike. That theme recurs in Greek mythology. Prometheus was punished excessively not only because he brought fire to mortals, but because he was outstanding in his knowledge of science and medicine, which filled Zeus with jealousy and anger. Stigma as sanction is, therefore, not necessarily the story of deviation from laws or moral standards. Man is often subjected to sanctions for no apparent reason. A person has his moira , or station in life, and, if he exceeds it by being conspicuous in any way, he commits hÃ¼bris and arouses the jealousy of the strikingly anthropomorphic Greek gods.63 Herodotus recounts the message of Artabanos to Xerxes: You see that the Gods hurl their bolts against those living beings that tower above the rest. They do not suffer them to exalt themselves. The small ones, on the other hand, do not bother them. You see that lightning always strikes the tallest houses and trees. For the Gods love to set a limit to everything that rises too high. For the Gods do not suffer anyone but themselves to harbor proud thoughts.64 The hÃ¼bris of Agamemnon consisted of being awarded a hero's welcome as 'the highest of all who walk on earth today'. We may note that though it was the crowd that committed the hÃ¼bris, Agamemnon was doomed, because 'the black furies wait, and when a man has grown great by luck, not justice, without turn of chance, they wear him to a shade and cast him down to perdition; who shall save him?' (TEschylus, Or esteia). Again we have a clue as to the main criteria of social stigma: 'An excess of fame is danger'. But danger to whom? Apparently, to the jealous multitudes (the gods). Drachman comments on the theme of punishment without offense in Greek tragedy, as follows:</page><page sequence="33">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 33 Our first question, when the immediate effect of the magnificent drama has subsided, is this: But what has he done? 'Done?' answers the Greek in astonishment, 'He has not done anything. That is the point of it. It has all happened unknown to him.' - Well, but then it is all the most outrageous injustice. - 'I do not understand you,' says the Greek; 'Do you mean to deny that such things can happen to you, any day, nay, at any moment? Or are you even for an instant safe from the invasion of the most appalling horror that your mind can grasp? If you are, you had better realize what human life is. This is what Sophocles' s drama should help you to do.'65 The epitome of this theme is reached in Polycrates, King of Samos, whose hÃ¼bris, according to Herodotus, was his conspicuous success and outstanding prosperity. It is not only the anthropomorphic Greek gods or primitive tribes who punish man's disruption of the system-in-balance. Lurianic kabbala sees original sin as inherent in Adam's hÃ¼bris, as expressed by his over-eagerness to copulate with Eve. He disrupted the cosmic equilibrium by carrying out his mating - zivug - before the Sabbath (the optimal time for a zivug of mending - tikkun). In addition, he had performed a disruptive and polluting mating with Lilith (Satan's consort), thereby bringing about the profane zivug of Eve with the snake.66 In a like manner, Moses also committed hÃ¼bris by striking the rock instead of talking to it, as ordained by God, in order to free the water within. Thus Moses also caused a disruptive zivug instead of a harmonious one.67 We have already pointed out that the breaking of the vessels was a violent disrupting of the system-in-balance of the Godhead, whereas original sin and the golden calf represented dramatic disruptions of the process the Almighty's mending (tikkun). The Talmud (Bereita Hagiga68) tale about four scholars who entered a mystical orchard, Pardess, may provide a mytho-empirical support for our contention as to the effects of a strong cathartic experience, such as mystical revelations on the intra-psychic system-in-balance. One of them, Ben Azaai, died and another, Ben Soma, went mad. These two had apparently a very skewed and precarious system-in-balance, which the forceful mystical experiences shattered physically in the first case and mentally in the second. The third, Elisha ben-Avuya, had apparently a loosely integrated system-in-balance. Yet after its initial disruption, it reached a reintegration on another level of being within another belief system. He became an acher - an apostate. Rabbi Akiva had apparently a very strongly integrated system-in-balance, enabling him to undergo the revelatory experience without being injured by it. Indeed, man's system-in-balance is very precarious on all three levels of his being: biological, personal, and social. In the Myth of Tantalus, we</page><page sequence="34">34 God as the shadow of man discussed the vulnerability of the Sisyphean and Tantalio types to outside stimuli. On the cortical level, the activist Sisyphean needs the initial arousal more than the Tantalic type in order to initiate his functioning. On the personality level, the Tantalic type is averse to stimuli, whereas the Sisyphean type is hungry for them. On the social level, the Sisyphean is a group performer, whereas the Tantalic type is a loner.69 These traits, measured along continua, can be used to indicate the vulnerability of the various types to the disruption of the system-in-balance on these three levels which are, of course, interrelated within the individual as an holistic unit. When one of these levels or the whole person is exposed to a traumatic experience, they try to 'mend' themselves on another level of being. However, when these tikkunim (mendings) are not successful, the individual may die, or become insane or alienated. There is no intrinsic difference between the vulnerability of God's system-in-balance of man's. Both must be 'mended' if their equilibrium has been disrupted. This makes for constant change, both for man and God. Both mortal and divine are in a constant process of becoming. They undergo processes; but in line with their Tantalic and Sisyphean meta-myths, they never reach their goals. A system-in-balance also constitutes a precedent condition for revelation and creativity. Revelation can flow through a balanced infrastructure and then be transmitted to others and to God as a universal thou. Man, through his creativity, is also the connecting link between the mindless, valueless demiurgos and the powerless and silent Godhead. Man creates the viable equilibrium between psyche and soma, between God and his creation. There can be no abdication for a creative Sisyphus; without him everything reverts to chaos. The sefirot of the Kaballah are divided into three heads as shown in figure 1.3: Left Middle Right Bina Keter Hochma (intelligence) (crown) (wisdom) Din Tiferei Hessed (stern judgment) (glory) (grace) Hod Yessod Netzah (awe inspiring) (foundation) (eternity) Malchut (kingdom) Figure 1.3 The right side, dominated by the sefira of grace, also contains those sefirot which descriptively constitute those attributes of God denoted by</page><page sequence="35">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 35 us as participant - Tantalic. The left, sinister side, dominated by stern judgment, is also materially sÃ©parant - Sisyphean, whereas the middle row presents the dialectical synthesis. As the sefirotic structure is holonic and permeates all of creation and transcendence, it postulates the system-in-balance as a meta-principle regulating the viability of God, man, and the relationship between them. Indeed, in the Lurianic kabbala the light which radiates from infinity and which builds all the worlds is denoted as the kav hamida 70 - the ray of balance, which builds the world in measures and balances. The breaking of the vessels was caused by the disharmony between the divine light flowing from infinity and the emanated containers (vessels) which were meant to hold Knowledge and the Tree of Life.71 The molding of the golden calf disrupted the face-to-face mating between ze-er (male) and nukbah (female).72 The purpose of mending is, therefore, to reinstate the harmony between the countenances of divinity. The soul of the tzadik , the Kabbalist Pneumaticus , is represented according to Joseph Jikatilla by the synthesizing Sefira of Yes sod which he denotes as shadai. This is a jeux de mots, since shadai is both a denotation of God and a balancing, harmonizing, and regulating of power which synchronizes between the countenances of God and between transcendence and creation.73 Indeed, the world of azilut, the primeval world of infinity representing the harmonious emanator Godhead, is denoted by the Kabbala as Olam ha-matekela-the World of Balance74 In Gnosis, we have a dialectic between spirit and matter.75 This is necessary because the Godhead is alien to temporality and does not activate the world of creation. Hence, the particles of light (souls) mingle with the demiurgical matter and activate it. This, apparently, is carried out through the mediation of the messenger of Christ who is also denoted in Gnosis as 'the measured one'.76 We find Kierkegaard, the founding father of existentialism, making the following statement: 'A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short a synthesis.' In his Either/Or , Kierkegaard examines the equilibrium between the aesthetical (in our model the sÃ©parant Sisyphean type) and the ethical (in our model the participant Tantalic type) in the composition of personality.77 Again, we see here an equilibrium, a system-in-balance. Philosophy, for Heidegger, spoke Greek: 'Das word 'philosophie ' spricht jetzt griechisch. ' Camus went even further. In a celebrated interview he declared: 'A Greek heart pounds in me.' Camus embraced the Greek maxim of meden agan. In a period when most of the avant-gardÃ© European intelligentsia opted for revolution, Camus was not fashionable, but he did attain authenticity for his preaching against the revolution. The French Revolution brought the Terror, the Nazi Revolution culminated in</page><page sequence="36">36 God as the shadow of man Auschwitz, and the Communist Revolution had its purges and gulags. Hence, his 'nothing-in-excess'. Camus recognized the courage of the middle way; the heroic nature of creative rebellion within the eye of the demiurgical storm of history. The system-in-balance between the participant and the sÃ©parant core vectors is not only a precedent condition for the containment of the energy generated by our dialectical quests in a viable structure, but is also necessary for the creative transmission of this energy in a dialogical and authentic manner. For charisma to flow, the person experiencing the revelation of grace must be attuned to inner feed-back both from himself and from his audience. For revelation to flow into structured creativity Sisyphus must be attuned to his stone and carve it into a vehicle for dialogue. Thus, the structured revelation through the suffering of a Van Gogh is emitted by his canvasses, while Antonin Artaud tried unsuccessfully to transmit his torment in the form of unstructured shrieks hurled at a theatre audience. The disruption of Artaud' s core vectors resulted in his madness, making his hell strictly private. The demiurgos is the God of creation and history, space and atomic energy. He is the divine container of the Kabbala, receiving the flow of the light of grace coming from the Godhead. The demiurgos interact with the Godhead through creativity to produce creation. Sisyphus, thus, imbues his stone with grace and the inert Godhead is able to vicariously experience the authentic triumphs and disasters of a Mozart, a Van Gogh, or a Brel. Existentially inauthentic activity, which is unpalatable to Him, is left to the demiurgos as Gnostic error or Kabbalist din and kellipot. Creativity, if authentic, may generate the energy for an I-thou dialogue, linking the Godhead and the creation. If inauthentic and flawed, creativity would degenerate into the petrification of an I-it relationship. The Gnostic messenger, the Kabbalist initiate performing the tikkun, the go-between of revelation, links the thing-in-itself in transcendence with the prime mover emanated into history. This is why Tantalus, the protagonist of our meta-myth, is a Titan: part God who is still in transcendence and part man, God's image and Ã©manant theophony within history. The dialogic prayer between the self in history and the transcendental, universal thou actually generates the energy of revelation. It is the process of revelation in itself without any further goal beyond it. Revelatory prayer is God. Sisyphus, likewise, is the creative link between the Godhead and the demiurgos. He symbolizes the integration between man's desperate creative spirit and the demiurgical stone which is both his burden and his destiny. As myths have many layers, one stratum of the original sin may point to the hÃ¼bris of attaining self-consciousness, since self-consciousness is the prerogative of God. Hence, Judaeo-Christianity ordained abject</page><page sequence="37">The Mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 37 humility to offset original sin, and not just a Greek meden-agan, nothing in excess, to keep everything and everybody within the statistical middle range. The evolutionary need for a system-in-balance for the survival of mythogenic structures might explain the tragic faith of the great innovators and too-radical revolutionaries. A Galileo, a Van Gogh, and a Melville effected virtual revolutions in their creative realms. Hence, the demiurgical social structure defended both itself and the mythogenic structures which sustained its cultural system against the upheaval of excessive and, hence, disruptive innovations. Likewise, a Jesus Christ, an el-Hlage, and a Meister Eckhart were revelatory revolutionaries who threatened to rupture the mythogenic structures of the existing religious institutions, which accordingly defended themselves by executing their assailants. Evolution and the survival of mythogenic structures are aversive to the violence of revolutions. Indeed, the ani-consciousness prods man the creator and projector mythogenic structures to relate to energy-matter since it is the attributeless ani, the spiritual kabbalist airich-anpin (the suffering man the emaciated countenance of God), which is caught in constant pain due to his inability to reach a modus vivendi, a complimentary relationship with the mindless, brutal, demiurgical energy-matter. This can be achieved only through creativity which is effected by an evolutionary viable and structurally intact mythogene. Man, the anthropic mediator, is also infused with the suffering of the arich anpin, so as to motivate him better to create and effect a modus vivendi with the demiurgical energy-matter. This suffering is exacerbated by his being thrown into the world - to use Heidegger's terminology - with his parents' genes which may handicap him; later, these parents coerce him/her into submission to delimiting norms by surrogate sacrificial rites of passage. Here again the relationship between suffering and creativity which entails the structuring of viable mythogenes is curvilinear: Too much suffering will crush homo faber, man the creator, hurling him under the Sisyphean stone which only a median amount of pain will induce him to creativity which will effect a complementarity between the ani-consciousness and energy-matter. Evolution is a dynamic of being, not of non-being. Hence, it is a record of successes and not of failures. The latter are recorded as fossils if at all. Since mediocrities seem to be more viable in power structures and in institutions, and since talent is not democratic, the creative innovators who rock the boat are hunted down, persecuted, subdued, and, many times, destroyed by the power structures of societies and social institutions. Yet these creative innovators are enrich fructify and enhance cultures, in return for which the power Ã©lite of those cultures subjugate,</page><page sequence="38">3 8 God as the shadow of man discredit, and suppress these pioneers as 'just desserts' for their creative pains. Mytho-empirically, this is portrayed by Persephone who sacrifices the sacred king who fertilized her. Persephone - who brings destruction - is the mature nymph ready to be impregnated by the Demetrian triad of goddesses: Kore - maiden, Persephone - nymph, Hecate - Kore partaking in the mysteries of fertility rites.78 Persephone represents the demiurgical evil forces; (some of her epitaphs are the fearful one: she who kills) which destroy those who fructify them. She devours, praying mantis-like, while her lovers - like the social institutions, artists' cliques and promotion committees in academia - destroy the most gifted creators, those who don't fit in. Indeed, creative innovators are almost by definition deviants from the modes, means, and median parameters of the group. Still the creative innovator cannot but continue to be creative despite the hazards of his vocation. The artist must heed Nietzche's mandate to create dangerously, and Vincent Van Gogh in his misery wrote to his brother that he could renounce everything, except his need to create. However, if we accept Buber's dictum, which we do, that an I-thou relationship is an authentic being, whereas an I-it association is an inauthentic slumber, then creativity transfuses the juice of life into a petrified I-it relationship that man has with other objects, other people, and God, and resuscitates it by the mythogenic structures of endeavor, daring, and revolt. Our developmental model of personality formation poses three major dichotomies corresponding to the three major human developmental phases. The first is Hamlet's 'to be or not to be' associated with the primary Heideggerrean Geworfenheit zum Tod. The second is the existentialist-epistemic dilemma of knowing or not knowing linked to the coagulation of a separate self out of the pantheistic mass of early orality. The third is the socio-normative dimension: man's mythogenic and cultural relationship with his group. These three dichotomous queries entail the structure of the personality dealt by us in the Myth of Tantalus, i.e.,79 the relationship between consciousness and energy-matter elucidated in Le Pont de PromÃ©thÃ©e .80 In the present volume, we shall deal with the third dimension of man's socio-normative relationship as well as with the more general mytho-empirical bases for man's attitude towards transcendence.</page><page sequence="39">The mythogene and the Myth of the Logos 39 Notes 1 Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss, Le Cru et le Cuit (Paris: Pion, 1964), 9. 2 Shlomo Giora Shoham, The Myth of Tantalus: A Scaffolding for an Ontological Personality Theory^ St. Lucia, Australia: Queensland University Press, 1979). 3 Shlomo Giora Shoham, The Violence of Silence: The Impossibility of Dialogue (Middlesex: Transaction Books, Science Reviews, Ltd., 1983). 4 Shlomo Giora Shoham, Le Pont de PromÃ©thÃ©e: Physique et MÃ©taphysique, trans.
