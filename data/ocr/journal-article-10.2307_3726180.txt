Between I801 and 1802 a young schoolmaster and theologian of peasant stock who had spent his childhood in the Wiesental on the Upper Rhine and who loved its landscape, language and people, experienced a brief spell of poetic inspiration. During that year Hebel wrote his Alemannische Gedichte which Goethe saluted and which Tolstoi, Voss, Jean Paul, remembered with affection. Ten years later, in a letter to F. H. Jacobi, Hebel relates: 'In my 28th year, after reading the Minne- singer, I tried my hand in the alemannic dialect. But nothing came of it. Almost unwittingly, yet not without occasion, I started again in my 4ist year. Now I succeeded... I might possibly have continued for a long time. But since the poems were in print, the Muse grew cold again, as if I had betrayed the secret of her favour. In moments of selfawareness and selfesteem I realized that I could now only repeat myself.' Goethe saw in Hebel a kinsman, praising his anthropomorphic vision of rocks, brooks, and trees. 'Er verbauert auf die naivste und anmutigste Weise durchaus das Universum.' By his lively gift of invention and personification Hebel treated the animal world of sparrow and stork, of beetle, bee and spider in human terms, but also sun and moon and stars. The river Wiese which has its source on the Feldberg -'Feldberg's lieblichi Tochter' - and which joins the Rhine near Basle, becomes a pretty maiden in search of a husband. She skips over rocks and slopes, flows through woods and meadows, past many a known village, growing stronger and more beautiful, breathing life into fields and flowers until she weds the Rhine, her rightful groom. Nature is heightened by humanization, not dehydrated by symbolism. The Rhine, blue-eyed, broad-chested and strong- limbed, becomes 'Gotthard's grosse Bueb'. Often Hebel meditates upon death, but without terror, in the manner of country people. The poem 'Verganglichkeit' is a conversation between father and son on the road to Basle. His elder tells the boy that all living things are doomed and that wherever he goes, he is moving towards the graveyard. Even the great city of Basle with all its churches and steeples will fall, and moss and fern will grow where houses stood. 'Und mit der Zyt verbrennt di ganzi Welt.' By local colour and homely reference, as if the world ended at Basle, Hebel makes even his trans- cendental vision palatable to his readers. Hebel has stressed the direct descent of his dialect from medieval German. They share many linguistic features like the two-tone vowels (guote-guete) or the long i and u sounds. The Minnesanger's wip and lUp become Hebel's wiip and liip, their uz-usse, their frouwe-frauweli. Alemannic favours colourful vowel sounds, especially o in lieu of a (Obe-Abend,frooge, Schloof) or u in place of au (Huus, Muur), ii in place of ei (bliibe). It is not always beautiful on account of its gutturals (ch for k) as in chunnt and chraft, its broad hissing sounds like isch or hesch and its harsh contractions (bchiimmret-bekimmert). The affectionate diminutives (Chindli, Maidli) and the ubiquitous i-endings (keini, schini, alli) give it a homely, almost parochial character. But a dialect is by definition a spoken language, rich in onomatopoeic word-painting and sound-imitation: 'Un im Vertafer popperet der Wurm' actually reproduces the tapping noise in the wainscoating. Alemannic freely adopts and distorts French and Italian words (Fazenetli-fazzoletto) gaining thereby a new and humorous strength. One of its characteristics is the reversal ofer and el (Bauren, ldchlet). It is carefree about syntax, shunning the objective case (s'hatt der Weg nit Reviews 699</page><page sequence="2">gfunde) and the final n of verbs. It has a slow and heavy gait like the peasant walking behind a yoke of oxen, speaking in the throaty tones of mountain people. But the mysterious ane (whither) and the mollifying numme (nur) sound sweet to the native ear. The miracle is that Hebel fashioned this unpromising material into a pliable instrument to express human emotions or wonder in face of nature and made it ring in a variety of modes. In I809 Hebel could write: 'At certain moments I feel overcome by an in- ordinate pride and happiness at having succeeded in making our so often despised and ridiculed language classic and earning celebrity for its songs.' There are only some fifty poems, some of epic length and stance, others brief, enchanting lyrics, especially when he forgoes his urge to inform or to exhort. Then his verse is of the purest, like sunrise on a May morning, transfiguring grass and leaves with its silvery dew amidst the scent of cherry-blossom and hawthorn: Wie glitzeret uf gras un laub Vom morgetau der silberstaub. Johann Peter Hebel is the classical example in German letters of a petit maitre. For reasons unfathomable a renaissance of this lovable character and ubiquitous writer is in progress. Seminars are being held at southern Universities, like Munich and Basle, his place of birth, and a scholarly edition of his complete works and letters is available. Perhaps he attracts contemporary tastes by his utter integrity, his quaintness, his wit, his otherness. He poses few problems to understanding, except for his dialect poems, the only genuine example of German pastoral poetry. Hebel is known to every child by his breath-taking short stories and anecdotes from the Schatzkdstlein des Rheinischen Hausfreunds. Small masterpieces like 'Kannitverstan', 'Lange Kriegsfuhr', 'Unverhofftes Wiedersehen', 'Die Gute Mutter' are as familiar as Grimm's Fairy Tales. His tales of amiable rogues like Zundelfrieder or Zirkel- schmied, playing pranks on authority or pompous burghers, have seized on the popular imagination as much as the legends of Till Ulenspiegel. But the Schatz- kdstlein was Cotta's collection of the narrative pieces from a much wider enterprise: an annual almanac published for the Grand-duchy of Baden by the Governors of the Grammar School of which Hebel became the Headmaster. From I807 to 81I5 he was editor in chief of Der Rheinldndische Hausfreund oder neuer Kalender. In that capacity he wrote or re-wrote every page of the almanac, addressing himself to the wider community of the land as to his flock. Apart from being a poet, Hebel was above all a teacher, a preacher and a journalist of genius. He set out to entertain, to inform, to report and comment, establishing a rare intimacy between writer and reader. Though an annual event, the Kalender had the same function as newsprint has today. Hebel comments on world events, the Prussian or Napoleonic wars or gives a survey of patriotic history. As a fervent naturalist, addressing a rustic community, he writes on crops or vines, on the rearing of trees or on the wonders of nature, meditating on a bird's-nest, on spiders, snakes, caterpillars, lizards and - on the Universe, comets, and planets. Or else he describes a great fire, a natural disaster or a horrific murder (crime-story based on fact). In a long essay of 1812 he explains the decimal system of weights and measures, then introduced into the Duchy. Always he intersperses instruction with short story, anecdote or local lore, tragic or farcical, often tearful, always pointing a moral. His almanac, written with rare precision and economy of style, combines the role of the modern vehicles of information, edification, and amuse- ment. The Biblische Geschichten, Hebel's last work, published in 1823, are an extension of the Schatzkdstlein to the religious sphere, written in a didactic and picturesque, conversational style, only this time for children. 'Whenever I wrote, I thought of Reviews 700</page><page sequence="3">my old schoolmaster Andreas Grether in Hausen, of myself and my schoolmates under the shadow of his rod.' 'Frankly I wrote this little book for love of my country, and in almost every line I listened in my mind to the voices of the Upland children.' Finally: the monumental collection of Hebel's letters, nearly six hundred of them, which are an incomparable source-book for the knowledge of the man, his daily thoughts and feelings, his ubiquitous loves and friendships and also a record of his busy administrative work in church and school and state. From the sheer poetry of his letters to Gustave Fecht and Sophie Haufe to the high-spirited and humorous exchanges with friends and colleagues, the invaluable statements about the inception of his literary work, the cute observations on contemporaries and events to the unceasing nostalgic musings over his lost homeland- Hebel's letters offer an intimate autobiography and are endowed with the same stylistic qualities as his creative writing. F. CRONHEIM BICKLEIGH, DEVON German Men of Letters. Volume v. Edited by ALEX NATAN. London: Wolff. I969. 319 PP. ?2.IO. This volume of the German Men of Letters series contains essays on Jean Paul by J. W. Smeed, Brentano by Ian Hilton, E. T. A. Hoffmann by John Reddick, Grabbe by K. F. Jay, Platen by W. D. Williams, Lenau by Michael Butler, Stifter by Keith Spalding, Morike by J. M. Lindsay, Gotthelf by J. R. Foster, Raabe by J. H. Reid, Nestroy by Gertrud Seidmann and Spitteler by Werner Gunther. This is a mixed bunch, in part perhaps because the contributors appear to have very different audiences in mind. J. M. Lindsay's essay on M6rike, for example, would be a suitable introduction for a middling O-level candidate. Such simplicity, however, is preferable to some other contributions which sound like a refresher course for elderly teachers on the cliches of German Geistesgeschichte. Werner Giinther, who ascribes Spitteler's best effects to 'the cosmic vibrations in his soul' (p. 307), appears to be writing for spiritualists. There are good things, though. Of those essays which provide a general survey for the non-specialist, Keith Spalding's chapter, for example, is a balanced appraisal of Stifter's strengths and weaknesses, while Gertrud Seidmann gives a lively account not only of Nestroy but of the Viennese theatrical tradition in which he is rooted. J. H. Reid's excellent account of Raabe should interest also the specialist. It emphasizes Raabe's social awareness of the forces transforming Germany and is particularly good on the formal expression of historical perspective notably through the complex time-structures of Raabe's later novels. This essay places Raabe not only in a German but in a European context, a virtue shared by John Reddick's stimulating, anti-metaphysical contribution on E. T. A. Hoffmann, which argues forcefully that Hoffmann is 'heir to the aristocratic line of such as Rabelais, Grim- melshausen, Reuter, Lesage, Sterne, Smollett' and 'forebear of such as Heine, Stendhal, Fontane, Gide, Thomas Mann, Kafka, GraB' (p. 98).
