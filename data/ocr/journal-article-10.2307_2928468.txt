<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALTER BENN MICHAELS An American Tragedy, or the Promise of American Life Classes and Individuals YOUNG WOMEN IN DREISER'S AnAmerican Tragedy (1925) talk baby talk to the objects of their desire; that's what alerts us to the connection between Sondra Finchley's desire for Clyde Griffiths-"Sondra so glad Clydie here," she tells him'-and Hortense Briggs's desire for the coat in the window of Ruben- stein's fur store-"Oh, if I could only have 'oo" (103), Hortense says to the coat. Whether the girls understand themselves or the objects as infantilized by their desires is unclear; Clyde calls Sondra his "darling baby girl" (446), but what Sondra likes about Clyde is how "dependent" he is "upon her" (363)-which one is the baby? Things are a little more straightforward between Hortense and the coat but only, perhaps, because what the coat has to offer Hortense is so much more obvious than what Clyde has to offer Sondra. The coat is the "darlingest" because it is the "classiest" (103); where Clyde represents for Sondra a social problem analogous, as we will see, to the psychological one of dependency, the coat represents to Hortense an unambiguously upward transformation of her "social state" (102). The coat has "class" (105), and Hortense imagines that, wearing it, she will begin to belong to the class it has. It may, however, be a bit premature to describe this transformation and Hor- tense's desires for it as unambiguous, for the coat's class is not itself an unambig- uous phenomenon. "Actually, this is a special coat," Mr. Rubenstein tells Hor- tense, "It's copied from one of the smartest coats that was in New York last summer.... You won't find no coat like this coat" (105). The coat is "special" both because it's unique (there is none like it in Kansas City) and because it's not unique (there is at least one just like it in New York), and it's the simultaneity of these facts that gives it "class." Hortense wants the coat both because it has been "fash- ioned in such an individual way" and because, individually fashioned, it looks just like the equally individual coats of a lot of classy ladies in New York. Wearing it, she will belong at the same time to the class of the other women wearing it and to no class at all. From at least one perspective-that of contemporary American historiog- raphy-this position is best understood as a contradictory one. Recent studies of class formation in the United States have, for example, achieved a certain degree REPRESENTATIONS 25 * Winter 1989 (C THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 71</page><page sequence="2">of success in delineating a working-class consciousness but have encountered dif- ficulties in extending their analyses to the middle class. The problem, as Stuart M. Blumin has analyzed it, stems from "the individualism that lies at the heart of the middle-class system."2 Students of working-class consciousness experience no difficulty in discovering evidence of that class's sense of itself as a class, but insofar as "middle-class formation" has involved "the building of a class that binds itself together as a social group in part through the common embrace of an ideology of social atomism,"3 evidence of its sense of itself as a class and hence of its exis- tence as a class has been hard to come by. The difficulty of identifying the middle class is thus built into the process of defining it, or at least into the assumption that underlies that definition, the assumption of an essential incompatibility between individuals and classes. And this assumption plays a crucial role even in the work of historians more interested in individualism than in the middle class, untroubled by the apparent logical problems of middle-class individualism but troubled instead by the fate of middle-class individuals. For here, the incompatibility between individual and class is turned into a contest between individual and class, and Progressive expres- sions of anxiety about individualism-worries about the disappearance of the individual, complaints about the overweening predominance of the individual- are understood as marking what John William Ward has described as the shift from a nineteenth-century conception of individualism that, at its most extreme, declared the individual an individual only "to the extent that he was separate from society" to a twentieth-century conception that, as its extreme, identifies individualism as the "submersion of the individual in the group."' The trick here, in Ward's view, is that the term individualism remains in use while its meaning changes; thus Herbert Croly, for example (writing in 1909, as the meaning of the term begins to change), can simultaneously denounce Amer- ican society for its "extreme individualism" and for the fact that "it has not encouraged individualism at all."5 But the truth, Ward thinks (as his title, "The Ideal of Individualism and the Reality of Organization," suggests), is that the individual has been increasingly subordinated to the organization. Hoping to reconcile a moderate version of the old individualism with a mod- erate version of the new, Ward takes a rather benign view of this phenomenon- the question for him is whether "organization" is made "responsible to the indi- vidual" or whether it is allowed to "violate" the "integrity of the individual. Other historians take a dimmer view. Arthur Lipow, for example, characterizes Edward Bellamy, one of the earliest proponents of social organization, as solving "the problem of the relation of the individual to society by dissolving the former into the latter, completely and perfectly," and he accuses Bellamy of helping to "stimulate" "an antidemocratic collectivism which was to come to full maturity in the twentieth century."7 And Christopher Lasch has more cautiously suggested that, although "totalitarianism was hardly the goal toward which American pro- 72 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="3">gressives were even unconsciously striving," their proposals for reform, in partic- ular their "insistence that men could best be controlled and directed not by the old, crude method of force but by 'education' in its broadest sense," could easily degenerate into techniques of "totalitarian control."8 Thus, even for writers who, unlike Blumin, are untroubled by the idea that middle-class individualism is an oxymoron, the opposition between the individual and the class has its place, emerging as a melodrama in which the individual struggles more or less success- fully against the techniques of social control deployed by the class, indeed implicit in the very notion of the class. If, from the standpoint of those who worry about the existence of a middle class, Hortense's desire to become "individual" under- mines her desire to be "classy," from the standpoint of those who worry about the fate of individualism, her desire to be classy compromises her desire to be individual. In the following pages, I trace the transformations undergone by the oppo- sition between the individual and the social during the Progressive period, or rather, I try to show how that opposition disappeared. I begin by arguing that the defense of individuality against the "group" took the form of imagining persons as machines, independent because essentially inflexible-mechanical as opposed to social. My central example here is Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. I go on to contrast this conception of individuality as independence from society with a conception of individuality as difference within the "system"- here my central example is Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward. For Twain and Bellamy both, the group-they tend to call it the "mob"-poses a threat to indi- viduality, but where the alternative to the mob in Twain is the man alone (think of the Sherburn episode in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn), the alternative to the mob in Bellamy is the army, consisting not of independent individuals but of individuals individualized by their place within the system. It is mechanization, I argue, that in enabling the imagination of an individuality that resists society makes possible at the same time the vision of an individuality that is systematic: my central example here is the discourse of "scientific" (or, more generally, "sys- tematic") "management," in which hostility to the group finds expression as enthusiasm for the organization. Individuality now appears as an effect of standardization. The incoherence of Hortense's desires-she doesn't realize that you can't be individual and classy at the same time-is dispelled by an understanding of classes and individuals which insists that in order to be either classy or individual you have to be both at the same time. But, I argue in my last section, the Progressive transformation of the independent individual's disruptive energies into the organized individual's ambitious energies produces its own disruptions. Hortenses and Sondras become Clydes and Robertas; the stabilizing differences of what Walter Lippmann approvingly called "mastery" make possible the destabilizing desires of what he disapprovingly called "drift." Here my central example is An American Tragedy. An American Tragedy 73</page><page sequence="4">Armies and Factories "Training is everything," says Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee in an extraordinary speech that begins by asserting the absolute determination of the individual by society-"Training is everything.... Training is all there is to a person"-and ends by asserting the absolute autonomy of the "one microscopic atom" of a person that is "original,"9 that is, in other words, not a function of training. Hence the enormity of the Yankee's opportunity-he can train an entire people-and hence the enormity of his failure-they can resist his training. For despite its frequent proclamations of the "power of training! of influence! of education!" (180), it is with the power to resist training that Connecticut Yankee is most concerned. The Yankee's notorious reliance on violence and physical force in his efforts to "civilize" the "white Indians" of Arthurian England and his failure in these efforts are both effects of a conception of individuality that systematically denies any power at all to training, influence, and education. "A man is a man at bottom," the Yankee reflects happily, "Whole ages of abuse and oppression cannot crush the manhood clear out of him" (279). The man in question here has resisted the tyranny of the sixth century, but the Yankee's admiration is as great for those who resist the democratizing of the nineteenth: "English knights," he tells the faithful young products of his "man factory," "can be killed, but they cannot be conquered" (397). They cannot be conquered because no amount of physical abuse or coercion can ever produce in them the educational advance that even an acknowledgment of defeat would serve to mark. They are monuments to an individuality defined by nothing but the powers of resistance. It is for this reason, rather than for their lack of civilization, that they are plausibly seen as "white Indians."'0 "The Indian is hewn out of the rock," Francis Parkman had written in 1851, "You can rarely change the form without destruc- tion of the substance."" In principle ineducable, such men could only be subdued by violence. Hence, as Michael Rogin has argued, Indian hunters like Andrew Jackson identified with the Indians in the very act of-actually by means of the very act of-hunting them; the violence of the Indian required the violence of the Indian hunter who, in killing the Indian, became a version of him.'2 It is not hard to see a similar identification in the "withering deluge" of machine-gun fire that kills the last ten thousand "white Indians" at the end of Connecticut Yankee. But this massacre, so often identified by critics and historians as a critique of late- nineteenth-century industrialism-what Twain called "machine culture"-is in fact a tribute to that culture and to its machines. Indians in Progressive America were increasingly identified as paradigms of the American individualism that was understood to have created Twain's machine culture just because of the absolute inflexibility that Parkman in 1851 had predicted would cause their "ruin." Thus in Thomas Dixon's antisocialist dystopia Comrades (1909), it is the Indian Saka, in addition to the capitalist Colonel Worth, who emerges as a hero of "individu- 74 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="5">ality": 13 having tried and failed to order him about, the socialist "Brotherhood of Man saw Saka no more for many moons, but the crack of his rifle was heard on the mountain side and the smoke of his teepee curled defiantly from the neigh- boring plains" (175). Morgan's recognition that his Indians can be neither trained nor conquered is thus a recognition of their rocklike character, and his commit- ment to exterminating them is not an attack on their savagery but a tribute to their individuality. Only by means of the massacre can Twain acknowledge the "microscopic atom" that is "truly me," the selfhood that cannot be altered and so must be destroyed. Twain's Indians, however, are made out of metal, not rock. Twain's financially disastrous involvement with technology and, in particular, with that "mechanical miracle," the Paige Compositor, is well known, and just as the end of Connecticut Yankee is often read as a repudiation of late-nineteenth-century industrialism, it is often read also as a proleptic repudiation of the typesetter: "In bringing Morgan to death Twain was symbolically killing off the machine madness which possessed him."' 4 But what was most striking about Twain's involvement with the Paige was not that it took the form of an excessive (financially or ethically) and hence punishable enthusiasm for technology as such. Had Twain been backing the Paige's competition, the Mergenthaler linotype machine, he would have made the fortune he expected to make. The problem was that he chose the wrong ma- chine, and his reasons for choosing that machine are crucial to an understanding of the individual that emerges triumphant in Connecticut Yankee. The Paige Compositor, as Twain's financial savior H. H. Rogers described it many years after its final failure, "was the nearest approach to a human being in the wonderful things it could do of any machine I have ever known."' 5 Unlike the Mergenthaler, which cast its own type, melted it down at the end of each run and then recast it, the Paige performed all the acts of a human typesetter-set- ting,justifying, and distributing individual types-automatically and, when it was working, very quickly. 16 Where the seventeen-year-old Mark Twain had been able to set only ten thousand ems a day (more proficient typesetters could do fifteen thousand), the Paige could set twelve thousand ems an hour (the Mergenthaler could only do about eight thousand). But it wasn't working very often for, as H. H. Rogers went on to say, its wonderful similarity to a human being was "just the trouble; it was too much of a human being and not enough of a machine. It had all the complications of the human mechanism, all the ability of getting out of repair, and it could not be replaced with the ease and immediateness of the human being."' 7 With its eighteen thousand parts (still a record), the Paige would never be able to function economically; eventually, it helped drive Twain to bank- ruptcy. But its real significance was not so much financial as intellectual; the Paige marked a nineteenth-century highpoint in the attempt to represent human actions in metal. As a strategy for building effective machines, this proved to be a failure; the success of the Mergenthaler was a function of its bypassing what An American Tragedy 75</page><page sequence="6">Justin Kaplan has called "the human analogy."'8 But as a thesis about what sort of thing a person is-the sort of thing that can be represented in machinery, if not a typesetter then a computer-the thinking that produced the Paige was not and has not been in any definitive way discredited: at least one segment of the artificial intelligence industry of the late twentieth century is committed to insisting upon not bypassing the human analogy. And as a thesis about the nature of individuality-the "truly me" is the mechanical me, as immune to training as Dixon's Indians are to socialism-the Paige provided a valuable bulwark against those who really did think that training was everything and who argued, as John Dewey did in The School and Society (1900), that the trick to effective training was to "get hold of the child's natural impulses and instincts," "saturating him with the spirit of service," and so fitting him for life in the "larger society."'9 Dewey here articulates the idea of a total education-an utterly "saturated" self-that Twain's imagination of the mechanical self is designed to make impos- sible. Indeed, progressive education, conceiving "individual mind as a function of social life," is devoted precisely to exploiting the possibilities for training neglected by an "earlier psychology," which "regarded mind as a purely individual affair" (98). The disciplinary techniques of that earlier psychology treated the individual as a self-contained entity in need of "external" control; they are replaced in the "new education" by techniques of "guidance" (17) that, instead of "forcing the child from without" attempt to shape her from within. Once you "get hold" of the child's "interests," you have no need for the tactics of "external imposition." Dewey himself, however, manifests some reluctance to accept this account of the shift from traditional to progressive education as a shift from "forcing" the child to appealing to her "interests," not, however, because of the difficulty in- volved in producing an educational system that was continuously interesting but rather because of the difficulty involved in producing an educational system that wasn't. For even the disciplinary practices that are usually understood as forms of "external imposition"-keeping the child after school, giving her low marks, refusing to promote her-are in fact indirect appeals to interest or appeals to interest "in its obverse aspect": "to fear, to dislike of various kinds of physical, social, and personal pain" (29). For Dewey, then, even the most apparently coer- cive educational methods turn out to rely, like progressive education, on some version of the appeal to interest (turning out to be, from the standpoint of Con- necticut Yankee, insufficiently coercive). In education, Dewey would write some fifteen years later, "purely external direction is impossible."20 External direction may elicit a "physical result" (as when a man is locked up to prevent him from "breaking into other persons' houses"), but we must not "confuse a physical with an educative result"-locking the man up "may not alter his disposition to commit burglary" (27). The point here is not to deny that locking a man up may be an effective way of keeping him from 76 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="7">committing burglary; it is rather to remind us that as educators we are interested in the disposition that produces the action rather than in the action itself. But, of course, locking the burglar up (or threatening to lock him up) may, after all, alter his disposition (just as threatening to keep the child after school may alter hers), so the purest negative example is action without disposition of any kind. "Suppose that conditions were so arranged that one person automatically caught a ball and then threw it to another person who caught and automatically returned it; and that each so acted without knowing where the ball came from or went to. Clearly such action would be without point or meaning. It might be physically controlled, but it would not be socially directed" (30-31). Where the physical control over the burglar's actions (his incarceration) might after all appeal to his interest (in avoiding incarceration), the physical control over the ball throwers can appeal to no interests since the ball throwers are imagined from the start as having no inter- ests-that's what it means for their actions to be described as proceeding auto- matically. The ball throwers are better examples than the burglar because, while the burglar may resist education, the ball throwers are immune to it; with them, the only possible results are "physical," the only possible changes in their behavior a function of "force." Seeking a philosophically satisfactory (although pedagogically irrelevant) alternative to progressive education, Dewey is thus driven to Twain's solution; the world of his ball throwers is the world of Twain's knights, who can be killed but not conquered because (like the ball throwers but unlike the burglar) they are immune to even the attenuated appeal to their interest implicit in the threat of violence. Since no education can be "purely external," in Connecticut Yankee there can be no education; schooling is redescribed by Twain as manufacture, training as production-it takes place in the man "Factory" (159) or in the "civilization- factories" (396). And the conflict between cultures is really a conflict between machines: the ones made in the Yankee's factories and that "political machine" (160), the Church; Merlin's "magic" and the Yankee's "science." As such, this con- flict is intrinsically and essentially violent; because they are immune to the threat of violence, the knights are susceptible only to the fact of violence. The "micro- scopic atom" that is "truly me" can be altered only by being transformed (by dyna- mite) into "miscroscopic fragments of knights and hardware and horse-flesh" (259), uncountable "because they did not exist as individuals, but merely as homo- geneous protoplasm, with alloys of iron and buttons" (396). The "error" of the old psychology, Dewey thought, was to see "no alternative between forcing the child from without, or leaving him entirely alone" (17). Seeing no alternative between the microscopic atom that is the individual and the microscopic frag- ments that do not exist as individuals, Twain commits himself to this "error." The triumph of social atomism in Connecticut Yankee is his ability to represent any trans- formation of the atom as its destruction. The world in which the only actions are violent ones is the world made safe for individuals. An American Tragedy 77</page><page sequence="8">It may be, however, that the characterization of these transformations as "vio- lent" is as inappropriate as the language of "force" and "external imposition" turned out to be in connection with the old education's disciplinary appeals to punishment. It was inappropriate with respect to punishment because the appeal to, say, the burglar's fear of jail in no way bypasses the question of his interest; it just alters the interest that is being appealed to. And it is inappropriate with respect to the knights and ball throwers because it makes no sense to think of them as having been coerced or even externally imposed upon. Having no inter- ests in the first place, automatic ball players can no more have their interests violated or ignored than they can have them appealed to. They can't be directed "from without" because they don't really have a within-in Dewey's terms, a machine is all without. Twain's mechanical Indians thus represent not only an extension but a perfection of Parkman's Indians hewn out of rock. In Parkman, the Indians' "substance" is destroyed when their "form" is altered; substance is simultaneously different from and dependent on form, and it is this difference combined with dependence that produces the possibility of violence. But in Twain, form is either absolutely identical to or absolutely independent of sub- stance; the response of the victim is in both cases irrelevant. Thus St. Stylite, the hermit, "bowing his body ceaselessly and rapidly almost to his feet," can be hooked up to "a system of elastic cords" and used "to run a sewing-machine" (205). The hermit is praying, but he is at the same time engaged in "one of the most useful motions in mechanics, the pedal-movement." The example is parodic but the principle-the irrelevance of what St. Stylite knows and wants to what he can be used to do-is not. Think of the difference the slide rule made to what Frederick Winslow Taylor called "The Art of Cutting Metals": "By means of these slide-rules," Taylor wrote in 1911, intricate mathematical problems "can be solved in less than half a minute by any good mechanic, whether he understands anything about mathematics or not."''2 Fitted out with a slide rule, as St. Stylite is fitted out with elastic, the mechanic can become a part in a calcu- lating machine as St. Stylite became a part in a sewing machine. Indeed, the mechanic is from this perspective a more extreme example of mechanization than St. Stylite, since with St. Stylite the difference between form and substance more or less corresponds to the difference between body and mind, as if the mind were immune to mechanization, whereas the slide rule makes the distinction between body and mind irrelevant. Taylor is often accused of pro- ducing a "schism" "between the mind and the body of the industrial workman,"22 and the workmen in plants undergoing Taylorization routinely complained about being reduced to automata, unable to think or move for themselves. Taylor's response to such complaints was not to deny them but to generalize them: "The same criticism and objection," he argued, could be "raised against all other modern subdivisions of labor" (125). The actions of a surgeon, properly under- stood, were as mechanical as those of a bricklayer or metal cutter. Replacing "rules 78 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="9">of thumb" with "rigid rules for each motion of every man"-in effect, bypassing individual judgment and substituting for it something like a slide rule-was sci- entific management's goal for human action at all levels. The "instruction cards" for every factory worker that became one of the hallmarks of scientific manage- ment specified not only the rules according to which work would be performed but the rules by which that work would be evaluated. The cards call, Frank Gil- breth wrote, for "a definite quality. They do not call for having the 'work done to the satisfaction' of anybody."23 The manager's satisfaction is as irrelevant as the worker's initiative. In scientific management, management was to be as mechan- ical as the work it managed; the mind was as much a machine as the body. The discrepancy between what St. Stylite is thinking and what his body is doing thus appears most powerfully in Taylor as a discrepancy between what the mechanic is thinking and what his mind is doing. Perhaps the most extreme example of mechanization, however, is the Yankee himself, whose character is so much a product of Twain's own identification with the Paige Compositor. Readers have often noted the extraordinary inconsisten- cies in Twain's presentation of the Yankee, for example the juxtaposition of his lachrymose sympathy for Morgan le Fay's victims and his cheerful willingness to be "reasonable" by letting her hang the band that plays that "Sweet By-and-By" so badly. Attempts to explain such inconsistencies by appealing to the complexi- ties of the Yankee's character are unconvincing.24 The execution of the band, like the hanging of Sir Dinadan the Humorist, is a joke, and it is a joke made possible by indifference to consistency, by a conception of character as mechanical and as thus susceptible only (but absolutely) to external change: the transformation pro- duced by Hercules' crowbar is a prototype of the transformations produced by Mark Twain's typewriter. To put it another way, the Yankee doesn't exactly have a character, he is the character he can be described as having; he is incapable of behaving "out of character" because his character is defined by nothing but his behavior. If St. Stylite and the mechanic embody the priority of form to substance, the Yankee embodies the identity of form and substance. And when the only identity is formal identity, there can be no question of consistency-only repeti- tion or difference. To alter him is thus to destroy him but at the same time to replace him; he perfects the "immutability" of the Indian by making it mutable. A Connecticut Yankee does not, then, express an attitude toward technology, either the optimistic one of a Mark Twain who loved machines or the pessimistic one of a Mark Twain who was getting nervous about the Paige Compositor and beginning to worry about the ultimate value of machine culture. Rather it embodies a commitment to the essential likeness of persons to machines, a com- mitment embodied also in Twain's own identification with the Paige and in his vision of himself as a kind of writing machine: "I started the mill again 6 days ago and have ground out a good average," he wrote Rogers, while waiting for news of the Paige's last try-out, "1 1,800 words" in a week.25 "It is the aim of Scientific An American Tragedy 79</page><page sequence="10">Management," Gilbreth wrote in 1912, "to induce men to act as nearly like ma- chines as possible."26 In the Yankee's failure, Twain predicts Taylor's success; defending individuals, he prepares them for the factory. In Edward Bellamy's Equality (1897), the sequel to his phenomenally suc- cessful utopian novel Looking Backward (1888), the narrator asks again a version of a question he had asked in 1888: what is done with people who do not acknowl- edge their "social duty"27 and refuse to join the "industrial army" that in the late twentieth century provides equal work, equal pay, and equal rights to all citizens. Bellamy's answer in 1888 to the question whether "universal military service" was "compulsory" had been first that it was more "a matter of course than of com- pulsion"28 and then, less evasively, that "a man able to duty, and persistently refusing, is sentenced to solitary imprisonment on bread and water till he con- sents" (107). By 1897, however, bread and water-"compelling someone to work against his will by force"-has come to seem "abhorrent"; in Equality, such a man would be provided with seeds and tools and "turned loose on a reservation expressly prepared for such persons," a reservation corresponding, perhaps, as the voice of the twentieth century says to the nineteenth, "with the reservations set apart for such Indians in your day as were unwilling to accept civilization."29 The Indian here is once again a figure for the resisting individual, but the Bartleby-like refusals so admired by Twain and Dixon are condemned by Bellamy as "excessive individualism" (57) or, forgetting even the "excessive," as symptoms of that "incapacity for cooperation which followed from the individualism on which your social system was founded" (103). "Who has not often felt . .. as if the sense of personal identity, i.e. sense of his connection with his particular individ- uality, were slipping from him?"30 Bellamy wrote in an early essay. This appeal to a "religion of solidarity" in which the individual would be reduced to "an atom, a grain of sand on a boundless shore, a bubble in a foam-flecked ocean," may be understood to express what Arthur Lipow describes as Bellamy's "deep-going revulsion against individualism in all its forms," a revulsion that motivates his attempt in Looking Backward "to solve the problem of the individual in modern society by the suppression of individuality and personality in the warm embrace of a bureaucratic society,"''3 an attempt that can serve as counterpoint to Connect- icut Yankee in being an attack on the individualism Twain defends. At the same time, however, that Looking Backward's doctrine (and most of the book is doctrine, a series of lectures by the twentieth century's Dr. Leete in re- sponse to the questions of the nineteenth century's Julian West) seems to preach against individualism, what there is of its narrative works in a somewhat different direction. For when Julian West awakens after his first night in the twentieth century, he finds himself "staring about" in "anguish," "unable to regain the clew" to his "personal identity": "I was no more able to distinguish myself from pure 80 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="11">being during those moments than we may suppose a soul in the rough to be before it has received the earmarks, the individualizing touches which make it a person" (77). The desire to lose one's identity is here matched by the fear of losing it and by the hope that one will "never know" that fear again; the society in which individualism has been eradicated is imagined as a society in which individualism has been secured. It is this reversal, rather than the search for an alibi, that makes sense of Bellamy's claim that service in the industrial army "is more a matter of course than of compulsion." Dixon's antisocialist Indian is a hero because he lives according to "natural law" under which "no man, even the poorest, could be com- manded to work by a superior power. He could always quit if he liked. He might choose to go hungry . . . but he was still master of his own person. His will was supreme. He, and he alone, could say, I will, or I will not" (307). In this charac- teristic defense of freedom of contract (socialism, Dixon complains, replaces "contract" with "command"), Dixon identifies individuality with the possibility of independence, and that possibility-the refusal to serve-is just what Bellamy denies. He denies it, however, not because he cannot countenance it but because, in the end, he cannot imagine it. Service in the industrial army counts in Looking Backward less as a choice one can make than as the ground of the choices one can make. Thus the refusal to serve seems like "suicide" (70), not a refusal on behalf of individuality but a refusal of individuality. "Nowadays everybody is a part of a system with a distinct place and function. I am outside the system," Julian com- plains, "and don't see how I can get in" (137). By no means a declaration of inde- pendence, neither is this complaint a renunciation of individuality. Rather the yearning for a "distinct place" within the system (like the "anguish" induced by being unable to "distinguish" yourself from "pure being") marks the assertion of an individuality that only some "system" can make available. In Looking Backward, that system is the army. Where Dixon's war hero Colonel Worth hates the army's "organization," hates "its iron laws of discipline, its cruel machinery devised for suppressing the individuality of its members" (81), the peace-loving citizens of Looking Backward regard its "perfect organization" as a way of producing what they call "self-devotion" (89). Divided into three "grades," which are in turn divided into two "classes," within which are "many minor dis- tinctions of standing" (107-8), the industrial army is more committed to pro- ducing individuality than to suppressing it. But the individuality it produces is defined by difference rather than independence. What the industrial army offers is a system of finely graded distinctions, an "organization" that makes "self- devotion" possible because it defines the terms in which "self-devotion" can be pursued. Outside the system you cannot know who you are because you are not yet you-you are "pure" (i.e., undifferentiated) "being." But the system allows for differences-indeed, it consists of nothing but differences-and by making dif- ference possible, it makes identity possible. An American Tragedy 81</page><page sequence="12">From this standpoint, what used to look like individuality comes instead to look like the inability to achieve individuality. After Taylor's initial presentation of "A Piece Rate System" before the American Society of Engineers in 1895, one of the discussants, admitting the virtues of Taylor's system, nonetheless waxed nostalgic for a time when scientific management was "unnecessary," when the "machine shops of this country were individual shops.... There was a certain community of feeling, in those days, between the boys in the shop and the master, which I think passed away when machine-shop owners became corporations, when they were managed by a board of directors who never saw the workmen, who knew nothing of them, individually, and, as I fear, cared less."32 Taylor, how- ever, redescribes workmen in individual shops as "workmen" in "isolation" (25), unable to profit from the scientific study of time and motion and, in this respect (strikingly enough) in exactly the same situation as workmen in "gangs." The subject of scientific management, Taylor maintains, is neither workmen in "iso- lation" nor workmen in "masses" but, rescued from the undifferentiation of isolation and the equal undifferentiation of the mass, the "workman as an indi- vidual" (71-72). What is even more striking here, however, is scientific management's simul- taneous compatibility with the defense of individualism and with the attack on it: the white Indian, defined by his resistance to "organization," mechanized, becomes the ideal factory worker; the industrial soldier, defined by nothing but his participation in the system, also becomes the ideal factory worker. Hence the appropriateness both of Herbert Croly's contradictory complaint about Amer- ican individualism and of his vision of that complaint answered. The complaint was that America was both excessively and insufficiently individualistic, and the response is one that represents individuals defined by difference as individuals who have achieved independence. "Individuality is necessarily based on genuine discrimination" (414), he writes, and, "In every kind of practical work specializa- tion ... is coming to prevail; and in this way individuals ... are obtaining definite and stimulating possibilities for personal efficiency and independence" (430). Dis- crimination and specialization clearly invoke the Bellamyite conception of indi- viduality as difference, but Croly, rather than exchanging (as Bellamy does) independence for difference, imagines difference as providing a new basis for independence. Thus the nonunion laborer, characterized by employers as the "independent working man," is regarded by Croly as "a species of industrial der- elict" (387) who, if he were a truly "independent industrial individual" would dem- onstrate both his independence and his individuality by 'joining the union" (395). In Croly, then, as in Taylor, the opposition between attacking individuality and defending it or, more importantly, between defining it by difference and defining it by independence, is overcome. This is not to say that it disappears entirely or that it never mattered in the first place. The sense that individuality was threatened helped to make possible the enthusiasm for turning men into 82 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="13">machines; the sense that individuality was threatening helped to make possible the enthusiasm for turning men into soldiers. But the compatibility of the prod- ucts is in the end more striking than the incompatibility of the motives. What emerges from the defense and the attack combined is a transformation of indi- viduality, one in which the mechanical defense of independence becomes itself a part of the machinery that reimagines the loss of independence as the access to individuality. It is this individuality that Hortense Briggs can want by wanting to belong to a class; in fact, she can want it only by wanting to belong to a class. The "classy" fur coat in Rubenstein's shop window thus embodies not the problem of a class that can be a class only by consisting of individuals who belong to no class but the solution of an individual who can be an individual only by belonging to some class. Standards and Individuals In the industrial army, everybody wears a uniform. Recent writers like Lipow cite this as evidence of Bellamy's anti-individualism, and Herbert G. Gutman has noted the case of a Pittsburgh railway worker complaining about the tendency to make "our men wear uniforms": "A uniform . .. constantly reminds them of their serfdom, and I for one would rather remain out of work than wear one."33 For the Pittsburgh brakeman, the uniform reduces one to an anonymous member of a class ("serfdom"), and the refusal to wear it counts as an assertion of one's "rights as a free-born American";34 for Dreiser's Clyde Griffiths, however, the bellhop's uniform he is required to wear when he gets his first job at a hotel marks his escape from his family and his achievement of a "position," enabling him to sense for the first time "the delight of personal freedom" (57). Indeed, the bellhop's uniform is just the introduction to the uniform Clyde learns to wear when he is off duty-the "new brown suit, cap, overcoat, sock, stickpin and shoes" (56) purchased "in imitation of" the most "attractive" bellhop and conferring upon Clyde some of that "individual['s]" attractiveness. Outfitted in clothes "as near like those of his mentor as possible" (56), Clyde is able, for the first time in his life, to "look different" (68). For Dreiser, the uniform makes difference possible-just as for Taylor, "uni- formity" of "method" made individuality possible-and in making difference possible it makes possible new areas of what he will call "personal" (57) experi- ence. There is a sense, of course, in which uniforms had already done this. Mass mobilization for the Civil War had produced, among other effects, the first reli- able standards for clothing sizes. Before the war and before Brigadier General G. H. Crosman's attempt in 1865 to "fix the sizes" of "the various articles of equip- ment" supplied by the Quartermaster,35 most Americans wore homespun, except, of course, for the very wealthy, whose clothes were made to order. The effort to An American Tragedy 83</page><page sequence="14">uniform the Union army, however, made available for the first time "sufficient data" "to set up standardized tables of proportions,"36 and, by 1889, with the publication by the Quartermaster General of U.S. Army Uniforms and Equipment, soldiers could get coats in four sizes, shirts in five, and trousers in six. With ready- to-wear replacing both homespun and the primitively sized clothes available in antebellum stores, it became possible for the first time for the average American to wear clothes that fit. From the standpoint of made-to-order, standard sizing may have seemed like a loss of individuality; from the standpoint of homespun, however, it made a certain degree of individuality possible for the first time. But the real individualizing power of standard sizing may have had less to do with making available clothes that really fit than with creating a whole new set of individualizing and intimate facts about the wearers of those clothes, a set of facts made newly available to the rich as well as to the poor. For it now became possible to have a size, and it would soon become almost essential to have not only the size but a set of beliefs and desires about it-that it was too large, say, or too small. And the individual's ability to have a size was, of course, made possible only because he or she could also be treated not as an "independent" individual at all but as a member of a large class, large enough, anyway, to make it profitable for someone to produce thousands of shirts with your measurements. Daniel Boor- stin has stressed the way in which coming to have a size involved joining what he calls a "statistical community."37 At the same time, however, the effect of stan- dardization was hardly communal; the phenomenology of sizes involved not belonging to a group but being singled out. This conception of individuality as an effect of standardization helps make clear the inadequacy of the Tocquevillean tension between the individual and society as a way of understanding the transformation of individuality in the Pro- gressive Era. The workman being trained under scientific management, for example, was to be judged not by the results of his labor-a standard that ap- pealed to the intrinsic worth of his efforts-or by comparison to what other workmen achieved-an explicitly social standard-but by his "accuracy in con- forming to the standard method,"38 by the standard, in effect, of the standard itself. Scientific management, seen in this light, was as hostile to the individual in society as to the independent individual, since it was the managerial measurement of workers' performance in competition with each other that produced the group pressure to keep performance down; the workers feared (correctly) that the per- formance of a particularly skilled and energetic man could lower pay for all of them. The goal of scientific management was thus to make social comparison as irrelevant as isolated achievement.39 In other words, having redescribed independence as "isolation," Taylor replaces it with "ambition," which cannot be "stimulated" when workmen are "herded into gangs instead of being treated as separate individuals" (72). Taylor's point is that once scientific management has established the motions with which, 84 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="15">and the time in which, a "task" should be accomplished, it has also established a standard according to which each individual's performance can be judged, not only by his employers but, more tellingly, by himself. The development of the standard enables each workman to "measure his own progress" and thereby to achieve not just the "highest standard of efficiency" but the "greatest satisfaction" (120-21). The pig-iron handler, to use one of Taylor's most notorious examples, spends his day carrying pig iron from a pile to a railroad car, walking back to the pile and carrying more pig iron to the car. Under the rules developed at Midvale Steel, when he has been taught exactly how to carry pig iron, how much to carry at a time, how fast to carry it, and how long to rest before carrying some more, he can go from carrying twelve and a half tons a day to carrying forty-seven. And he can now be paid $1.85 a day instead of $1.15. But the most striking change is neither physical nor economic; it is psychological: scientific management makes it possible for the worker to experience satisfaction or dissatisfaction with his performance. It makes it possible (albeit in what would come to seem, by the end of the twentieth century, a somewhat primitive way) for him to know what it means to do his best and so be able to tell whether or not he has done it. Uniformity makes available a whole new area for what Bellamy called "self- devotion." When Clyde tries on his bellhop's cap, he sees (even before his boss can tell him) that his hair is "too long"; "His hair certainly did not look right in the new cap. He hated it now" (39). The introduction of the standard (the uniform) produces a new intensity of response to one's own appearance. Just as standard sizing made it possible for clothes to be the wrong size, the bellhop's uniform makes it possible for Clyde's hair to be the wrong length and so makes it possible for him to hate it. The experience of the self is here made possible by the medi- ation of the standard. Gilbreth, describing a point the worker reaches where his "fingers" can "do the work with no other assistance than the command from his brain to proceed," had spoken of an "automaticity of motion";40 automaticity of motion in Dreiser begins to become something like an automaticity of emotion. Indeed, this progress from motion to emotion could itself be understood as a form of automatism, as it was in the writings of the eminent neurologist (he invented the rest cure) and best-selling author (of the historical novel Hugh Wynne, 1896), S. Weir Mitchell. In a pair of books centering on a "character- doctor" (Characteristics, 1891; Dr. North and His Friends, 1900), Mitchell argued that such automatism marked the limits of human sanity. Concerned to celebrate "originality" and "individuality" ("the amazing way in which every man remains a thing apart from every man"),4' Mitchell's Dr. North is at the same time inter- ested in the "automatic imitativeness" that he acknowledges to play a role in "the developmental growth of character."42 The danger of this "very human" auto- matism emerges in mental disease, "in hysteria, and in rare cases of insanity, where a man repeats automatically the words he hears, or the gestures of the man at whom he chances to be looking" (122). The danger is not just that automatic An American Tragedy 85</page><page sequence="16">imitation can produce bizarre behavior but that it can also produce, by way of the behavior, the emotions that are usually thought themselves to produce the be- havior. "If . .. you pinch together the frontal muscles" of someone who has been hypnotized, Dr. North points out, "so as to imitate the facial expressions of a frown, he will at once become angry.... If you make his cheek-lines assume the curves of mirth, this suggests amusement, and he roars with laughter" (123).43 The emotions here are automated not in the sense of having been turned into automatic responses but in the sense of being enabled by automation: we auto- matically imitate the facial behavior of others, and this imitation produces as a kind of side effect the emotion appropriate to the behavior that has been imitated. For those, like Dr. North, concerned to preserve "originality" and "individu- ality," the moral is clear: "To allow our features to assume the first slight expres- sion of passion is a step toward failure in self-control."44 Emotion here is no longer regarded as an expression of individuality; rather, insofar as automation and imi- tation make individuals' emotions possible, emotion becomes the chief threat to individuality. And by the same token, standardization-the attempt, as Mitchell puts it, "to produce complete identity of product" (391)-becomes the great tech- nology of "passion." The standard may thus be said to alter automaticity in producing it. Auto- maticity of motion was supposed-like the slide rule-to bypass the worker's mind, and scientific management's managerial project was, as we have seen, to replace psychological notions like "satisfaction" with the mechanical specificity of the standard. But even in Taylor, the mechanical specificity of the standard ended up replacing the manager's satisfaction as a criterion of whether the job was done with the worker's satisfaction at how well he was doing it. And in Mitchell and Dreiser, it is automaticity that makes the conditions of satisfaction possible while the introduction of standards creates new realms of psychological experience, at the same time suggesting a new technology for standardization (and hence indi- vidualization). The Dreiserian novel-with its interest neither in individuals as such nor in the social order as such but in what Dreiser called "order[s] of individuals"45-would itself be an instance of this technology, as would, more gen- erally, the late-nineteenth-century novel, with what Mitchell describes as its com- mitment to "characterization." For although the account of automatic imitation in Characteristics emerges from a discussion of poetic influence designed to show that only "great genius" can transcend "imitativeness" (122), a subsequent discussion of George Eliot's novelistic "genius in characterization" somewhat alters the terms of the argument. In response to the remark that novelistic representation requires above all an effort of "associative memory," Dr. North asserts that "there must also be some power to do far more than memorize. There must be power to reject and modify assembled memories, so at last to create that natural oneness of the being described which ends by making a living thing, not a mere photograph" (172). 86 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="17">Genius is still the ability to transcend imitation, and imitation is still identified with a certain automatism (the photograph); but here the transcendence of imi- tation turns out to be automatic too-"Abidingly true power to characterize in fiction is automatic" (173), Dr. North goes on to claim. The automatism that threatened genius now appears as its true mark. Furthermore, the genius it marks is "genius in characterization," the ability to create the real individuals whose indi- viduality has been said to consist in their ability to avoid automatism. And literary genius is now said to consist not in resisting imitation but in manipulating it. "There are plenty of bright books nowadays in which a man represents the people he knows" (172); the genius in characterization takes these representations, these "memories," and "assembles" them into a character, "building" out of them "a living thing." Although, according to Dr. North, machines represent man's attempt to make things alike, "to make watches or engines so as to deprive the thing made of individuality" (391), novelistic representation-in George Eliot as in Dr. North's own book on "building" character-is a machine for producing individuals. It might thus be argued-against what are today the two dominant hy- potheses: the novel as agent of social liberation, the novel as agent of social con- trol-that the realistic novel should best be understood as participating in the broader project of standardization, and that the commitment to characterization in particular can best be understood as a commitment to constructing the stan- dard. I want to end this section, however, not by pressing this argument but by epitomizing it, albeit in a highly simplified form. Two years ago, under the title "Selling Strong Emotions," Time commented on a new development in the American greeting-card industry, cards that instead of wishing people happy birthday or hoping that they get well soon tell them things like: "In this world it's very scary to be open and vulnerable," or "I want to please you, but first I have to please myself," or "You hurt me. I feel better just telling you." These cards originated, according to Time, in a visionary experience undergone by "radio therapist and author (The Making of a Psychiatrist)" David Viscott. Says Viscott, "Once I heard a voice saying, 'Someday you will tell people what they really feel inside,' and that's what I do."46 Now the reproduction of this voice in millions of greeting cards (first printed in 1986) makes Time nervous: "It may be," their reporter comments, "that the card companies are busy establishing the emotional range for many Americans with one-size-fits-all feelings." The comparison with clothing sizes is appropriate, but the fear of one-size- fits-all misses its point. That fear is based on the assumption that people already have many varied and differentiated emotions, which will be compromised by being reduced to catchphrases on cards. But the argument for the cards is that people no more come equipped with emotions than they come equipped with clothing sizes. Just as Viscott needed a voice to tell him what he would do, the consumers of these cards need his voice to tell them what they "really" feel; just An American Tragedy 87</page><page sequence="18">as people can be instructed on how to experience the physical process of lifting and carrying large weights of pig iron, they can be instructed on how to experi- ence hormonal changes in their bodies. Viscott's greeting cards update Taylor's instruction cards, or, as one member of the card industry put it, "We never create a card line; we create real feelings."47 If this claim is inflated, it is not because real feelings can't be created but because the realistic novel has already created them. Classes and Masses Hortense wants the fur coat as a way of improving her "social state"; at once individual and a copy, the coat is classy, and Hortense imagines that, owning it, she will be too. But why does Sondra want Clyde? Clyde doesn't have more class than Sondra, but he doesn't, unambiguously, have less either. For he is, after all, a Griffiths, even if a poor relation, and so the town of Lycurgus and the Griffiths themselves are uncertain how to feel about him. Within the Griffiths family, the two extremes of possibility are represented by Mr. Griffiths and his son Gilbert, the father liking and encouraging Clyde, the son disliking and dis- couraging him. Sergei Eisenstein, preparing a script for a never produced movie of An American Tragedy, explained the difference between father and son by noting that in Mr. Griffiths, "There still prevails the patriarchal democratic spirit of the fathers, who have not forgotten how they themselves came to the town in rags to make their fortunes. The succeeding generation is already approximating to a money aristocracy; and in this connection it is interesting to note the difference in attitude towards Clyde adopted by his uncle and his cousin respectively."48 The extraordinary physical resemblance between Gilbert and Clyde makes this new snobbery all the more marked, but it also suggests that there is more at work here than the hardening of class lines. Clyde's near identity to Gilbert helps constitute (especially for Sondra) a kind of slippery class erotics: Clyde's resem- blance to Gilbert identifies him as one of Sondra's own class, indeed as someone who-coming from money a little older than the Finchleys'-is in certain respects socially superior to her; at the same time, however, Sondra is attracted to Clyde because he is a lower-class Gilbert-unlike Gilbert's "hard" eyes, Clyde's "seeking" eyes mark him as wanting from Sondra something of what Hortense wants from the fur coat and thus make him a further object of interest to Sondra, who sees her own class reflected in those eyes. Clyde is thus simultaneously above and below Sondra, attractive as the embodiment of an almost utopian class fluidity- utopian not in imagining that class lines can be crossed (the history of the Grif- fithses and the Finchleys testifies that they can) but in imagining the possibility of belonging to more than one-or rather, the possibility of a single person (Clyde and, through him, Sondra herself) embodying the moment of crossing. F. 0. Mat- thiessen convincingly described Sondra as responding to "an intensity in [Clyde] 88 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="19">beyond that of the college boys she is used to,"49 but this intensity is not exactly personal, or it is personal only in a way that is simultaneously structural. What Sondra responds to in Clyde is his desire for her (a reflection of her own class from below) coupled with her desire for Gilbert (reflecting her own class from above). She complicates the relatively straightforward dynamics of Hortense's desire to change her "social state" by wanting not so much to move from one class to another as to experience the phenomenon of class in the context of class mobility, to experience through class difference her own "class." Eisenstein was right, however, to emphasize the hardening of class lines in Lycurgus. For although the Griffithses are determined to start Clyde out at "the bottom of the business" and the business is run on a piece-rate system, Clyde himself doesn't do piece work; "I don't want him put on piece work," Samuel Griffiths tells Gilbert, "It wouldn't look right. After all, he is related to us. Just let him drift along for a little while and see what he does for himself" (209). The Griffithses associate good "character" with "material manufacture," but piece work is the mark of the blue-collar laborer. A certain distance from piece work marks the white-collar worker, a distance the Griffithses extend beyond the fac- tory walls by forbidding their white-collar boys to date their blue-collar girls. In Lycurgus, the "line of demarcation" between "the rich and the poor" is like a "high wall" (249-50). So when Roberta's father hears that she has been killed, he can only imagine that it was "in the factory, by a machine" (511); what eventually emerges as the apparent truth-that she has been murdered by one of the "idle rich" (519)-seems a particularly horrible but not altogether exceptional conse- quence of the breaching of that wall between rich and poor, management and labor, white collar and blue. In fact, however, the wall is breached almost from the start, within the factory and without, by the "system" (240) designed to protect it. The employees are "drilled" "sharply and systematically in all the details and processes which com- prise" the "constructive work" (176) of the factory. The point of this drill is to produce "characters" as well as products, workers "inured to a narrow and abste- mious life." The effect, however, is quite different. Far from becoming inured to the narrow and abstemious, white-collar Clyde finds it impossible "to keep his mind on the mere mechanical routine of the work or off of this company of girls" (237). And the blue-collar girls are themselves "employed so mechanically as to leave their minds free to roam from one thought of pleasure to another," fixing mainly on the "nearest object," Clyde. Taylor had imagined that the mechaniza- tion of the worker would encourage the qualities exhibited by men like Samuel Griffiths, "individual character, energy, skill, and reliability"; critics of scientific management had charged that mechanization would drive the workers crazy or had predicted hopefully that it would encourage them to repudiate the whole factory system. In a famous passage in his Prison Notebooks, Antonio Gramsci sug- gested that when factory work becomes "mere mechanical routine," the worker An American Tragedy 89</page><page sequence="20">can achieve "a state of complete freedom" leading to "a train of thought that is far from conformist."50 According to Dreiser, however, factory work produces neither abstemious Samuel Griffithses nor nonconforming revolutionaries-it produces Clydes. And it produces them on both sides of the "high wall" between blue collar and white. Thus while Roberta's parents have been envisioning her "quietly and ear- nestly and happily pursuing her hard, honest way" (513)-living, in other words, the lives envisioned for the workers by management-Roberta herself, "taken with the charm" of Clyde's "personality" and "seized with the very virus of ambi- tion and unrest that afflicted him" (not to mention all the other factory girls; 250), has been "drifting" into an affair with Clyde. As he describes their sexual rela- tions, "I never had any real plan to do anything.... And neither did she, of course. We just drifted kinda, from the first.... And then there was that rule that kept me from taking her about anywhere, and once we were together, of course wejust went on without thinking very much about it, I suppose" (679-80). Juxtaposing the classes, the factory creates the sexually charged atmosphere of cross-class desire; it participates in producing Clyde's and Roberta's shared eager- ness "for something better than ever had been" (346). Insisting that the classes be kept apart, it requires and so produces the secrecy of Clyde's and Roberta's rela- tions, the enforced privacy that leads to the intimacy of their sexual relations. Finally, more powerful than this collaboration between proximity and separation, the factory produces the difference between the classes within each class: it pro- duces drift as the condition of white-collar labor-"I don't want him put on piece work .... Just let him drift along"-and drift as the product of blue-collar labor- Roberta has been killed not by a machine but by the desiring dreams-"We just drifted, kinda"-that machines and the mechanical quality of her own labor have turned out to make possible. Drift in the Progressive Era is a charged term. The "policy of drift" (315) had marked for Croly the great threat to his national ideal, a threat he identified with the Jeffersonian antifederalism that, he thought, had reached its apex in the years before the Civil War when Jefferson's Jacksonian heirs had "failed to grasp the idea that the Federal Union would not take care of itself": "They expected their country to drift to a safe harbor in the Promised Land, whereas the inexorable end of a drifting ship is either the rocks or the shoals" (56). It took Croly's great hero, Abraham Lincoln, lifting himself above "a system of individual aggrandize- ment, national drift, and mental torpor" (71), to save the Union and to proclaim Croly's own thesis, that "American nationality was a living principle" and that "Americans were responsible for their own national integrity" (88). Croly's interest in drift, then, was essentially as an antonym to his ideal of the American nation, but the "mental torpor" and the desire for "individual aggran- dizement" that formed the background for "national drift" could easily move to the front as the discussion took a less nationalist turn. Thus, by 1914, Walter 90 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="21">Lippmann (about to go to work for Croly's new New Republic) could ignore the question of national identity while continuing-in Drift and Mastery-to identify drift as the great enemy: "The scientific spirit is the discipline of democracy, the escape from drift, the outlook of a free man.' Where Croly opposed the ideal of the nation to drift, Lippmann opposes the ideals of administration and man- agement: the "scientific method, the careful application of administrative tech- nique, the organization and education of the consumer for control, the discipline of labor for an increasing share of the management" (87). Where Croly advocated new choices, Lippmann advocates choice itself: "We can no longer treat life as something that has trickled down to us. We have to deal with it deliberately, devise its social organization, alter its tools, formulate its method, educate and control it" (147). For Lippmann, then, "mastery" goes beyond the formulation of a polit- ical program to the formulation of a "theory" of "man's life" and a "method" (149) for living it. Croly's drifters are laissez-faire businessmen who think that if they are left to themselves democracy will flourish; The Promise of American Life proposes a polit- ical alternative to laissez faire. Drift in Lippmann is more pervasive-"We drift into work, we fall in love.... Of almost no decisive event can we say: this was our own choosing" (147)-and so the opposition to it will involve managing not only others but ourselves: we must not allow "accident" to master us; we must "pene- trate the dreaming brute in ourselves" (149); we must become "self-governing" (151). At the same time, however, opposing drift not only to state intervention but to action itself, Lippmann's logic makes available a new sphere for drift, a sphere in which drift can be rehabilitated, in which, as a 1923 advertisement headed "The Waterway to Happiness" could put it, the whole point could be to "Just drift" (fig. 1).52 The ad is for canoes and the sphere is leisure. Just as for Croly and Lippmann the sphere of productive action comes increasingly to be defined by the absence of drift, so for the makers of "Old Town Canoes" the sphere of leisure is defined by the absence of anything like action: "No effort. No work. Just pleasure!" This is not to say that work and leisure are entirely edited out of the scene of leisurely drift; rather they are transferred from the canoers to the "Old Town Canoe" itself: "For an 'Old Town' is the easiest of canoes to paddle. It answers instantly the slightest pressure of the blade. Speed, too, is built into every 'Old Town Canoe.' And strength, and steadiness." The work is thus built into the technology, and the young couple paddling in the canoe "up winding streams" may be under- stood as avatars of Clyde and his factory girls, looking out on the Mohawk "swirling and rippling," freed by the "mechanical routine" of their work to "roam from one thought of pleasure to another" (237). If then the increasingly rigorous attempt to exclude drift from the realm of action turns out to rehabilitate drift as the defining criterion of leisure, the conditions of leisure turn out to be indistin- guishable from the conditions of factory labor. The aggrandizing ambitions, the An American Tragedy 91</page><page sequence="22">Th e WAiLTER AY to Hi-APPINESS L - i . 1 ; L 5,: I I II' I : .

Clyde himself is "fascinated" by "canoeing," which is to say that he is "pleased by the picturesque and summery appearance he made in an outing shirt and canvas shoes paddling about Crum Lake" (255). He and Dreiser regard leisure 92 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="23">activities like canoeing, swimming, and diving as "social accomplishments"; the "appearance" they produce marks Clyde's eligibility for class transformation since, of course, the pleasure of drifting is a class pleasure. The couples at Crum Lake only "lease by the hour" the canoes that the readers of "The Waterway to Happiness" are urged to buy, but both the advertisement and the possibility of rental are institutions of class transformation. They are, in this respect, like the Griffithses' factory itself, which, in Gilbert's description, has a mission of some "social importance," "making and distributing collars, giving polish and manner to people who wouldn't otherwise have them, if it weren't for cheap collars" (321). The rhythm of factory life, I suggested earlier, produces Clydes as well as collars since it makes its workers into "passionate" (237) consumers, and Gil's description of the "social importance" of "cheap collars" reminds us of the intimacy between the factory's two products: the consumers it produces consume the products it produces; Clydes buy cheap collars. We can imagine Clyde and Roberta at Crum Lake as the couple in the "Old Town Canoe" ad; "This is the magic hour," say the makers of Old Town canoes; it's like a "dream" "realized" (258), think Clyde and Roberta. And we can imagine the climactic scene of Clyde and Roberta, "drifting, drifting" (489) in the rowboat at Big Bittern as the moralized culmination of the affair they "just drifted" (679- 80) into; "Just drift ... Just pleasure," says the canoe ad, but "the inexorable end of a drifting ship is either the rocks or the shoals" (56), says Croly. From this standpoint, dramatizing the consequences of drift, An American Tragedy seems to reaffirm the managerial morals of Croly and Lippmann. But, as we have already seen, for Dreiser the choice between drift and mastery, work and pleasure is com- promised by the irreducible interdependence of the terms between which one is supposed to be choosing. And nowhere is this entanglement more dramatic than in the scene of Roberta's death. For, of course, the "drifting, drifting-in endless space where was no end of anything-no plots-no plans-no practical problems to be solved-nothing" (489) has itself been planned as the prelude to "the moment of action-of crisis!"Y (491). And the "moment of action" is not only pre- ceded and precipitated by drift, it is inhabited by it-the "action" is an "accident," an "unintentional blow" (493) that knocks Roberta into the water. And then, in the wake of the action that has become an accident, there is a moment of thought-"Do nothing" (793)-while Roberta drowns, a commitment to inaction that will prove to the Rev. McMillan and to Clyde himself that he really is guilty of murder, a doing nothing that is a doing something until, putting to work one of the "social accomplishments" acquired at Crum Lake, Clyde swims to shore. It is, of course, usual to understand Dreiser and American naturalism more generally as concerned with the limits of human agency; indeed, it is almost a definition of naturalism to characterize it as a literature devoted to determinism and to the critique of conventional morality and idealist metaphysics such a deter- minism seemed to entail. But the genealogy of drift that we have been tracing An American Tragedy 93</page><page sequence="24">suggests that the preoccupation with the limits of agency should be understood less as a metaphysical obsession than as a point of access to new patterns of con- straint and possibility. When Lippmann worries that "accident" will become "master" (149), he is worrying that professionals will be unable to control the nation's economy; when Clyde wants to be "free" (492), he wants to be free of Roberta. The genealogy of drift thus marks not so much a persistent return to the questions of free will and determinism as a transformation of the social for- mations in which these questions could once again become urgent. The techno- cratic fantasies of (self-)control embodied in the Progressive cult of the scientific manager emerge in opposition to what looks (to Croly and Lippmann) like the drift of free-market individualism, and the technologies of control brought into being by these fantasies give birth in turn to the white-collar drifting of Clyde and Roberta. "For true to the standard of the American youth," Clyde "felt himself above the type of labor which was purely manual"; "If only he had a better collar, a nicer shirt, finer shoes, a good suit, a swell overcoat like some boys had!" (18, 19). The distribution of standards makes collars themselves a standard; the dissemination of Taylor's "personal ambition" makes every American too ambitious to carry pig iron. Clyde is "one of those interesting individuals who look[ed] upon himself as a thing apart" (18); he experiences his individuality as proleptic membership in a class higher than the one he also experiences himself as belonging to. Like the Green-Davidson Hotel that, "someone" says "sarcastically," supplies "exclusive- ness to the masses" (32), Clyde embodies a consciousness of class difference turned into an instrument of mass identification. Imagining himself, like everyone else, "a thing apart," he imagines himself not as independent but as exclusive. In Clyde's career, then, we see the insistence on class difference as a rehearsal for the relentless and alluring individualism of the mass society. "The white-collar people slipped quietly into modern society,"53 wrote C. Wright Mills in 1951, as if he were describing, in true Cold War style, the arrival of insidious but, in this instance, pitiful pod-people: "morally defenseless," "polit- ically impotent," without any "culture" except "the contents of a mass society that has shaped him and seeks to manipulate him to its alien ends" (xvi). Mills saw the Progressive Era as the moment when the "old middle classes" ("old independent entrepreneurs") "made their last political stand" (55) against bureaucratic mass society. They lost, and nowadays "the individual ... feels dangerously lost" (152). The loss of individuality is, perhaps, the dominant theme of American cultural studies, rivaled only by the triumph of individualism, which is only to say that social change in American life characteristically presents itself as an event in the history of the individual. Both the defense of individualism and the attack on it should thus, as we have seen, be understood as episodes in the transformation of individuality, turning independence into isolation and dependence into differ- ence, building characters out of machines and making masses out of classes. One 94 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="25">way to describe these transformations is as the arrival in American culture of the white-collar people. The literature of the Progressive Era is a literature of white-collar promises and tragedies, like the promises and tragedies-the white- collar people and the white collars-produced in the Griffiths Collar and Shirt Company.

In his important and illuminating The Fatal Environment (Middletown, Conn., 1986), Richard Slotkin describes Twain as unable "to identify himself and us uncritically with Hank Morgan; but equally unable to reject Morgan ... and merge with the peasantry of the English nation" since to "do that would be to abandon Custer for Sitting Bull and civilization for white savagery" (530). The mistake here, as I see it, is to under- stand identification with the Yankee as identification with a certain set of values- "progressivism"-and thus to read Connecticut Yankee either as endorsing or repu- diating or partially endorsing and partially repudiating those values. I argue below that Twain's identification with the Yankee is essentially ontological, involving a com- mitment not to the views he holds (about, say, civil service exams or technology) but to the self he is (a mechanical one), and thus expressing itself most powerfully in formal terms. 11. Quoted in Michael Paul Rogin, Fathers and Children: Andrew Jackson and the Subjugation of the American Indian (New York, 1976), 115. 12.

Also unconvincing, in my view, are attempts to extend the analysis of the Yankee's character to his politics. John Kasson, for example, concludes his interesting discus- sion of Connecticut Yankee by claiming that the book demonstrates "how a powerful, supposedly humanitarian republican leader may betray his own ideals as he seeks to extend control over a weaker, underdeveloped nation through essentially aggressive use of his technology"; Civilizing the Machine, 215. Presentism aside, the trouble with this analysis is not exactly that it takes the Yankee too seriously but that it takes him seriously in the wrong way, transforming Twain's vision of mechanized (and hence rescued) individuality into a critique of the Yankee's humanitarianism. 25.

The theory was that behavior caused rather than expressed emo- tions-we do not "strike" because we are "angry," we are "angry because we strike"- and the advice was to "go through the outward movements" of the dispositions you wish to "cultivate": "Smooth the brow, brighten the eye . .. and your heart must be frigid indeed if it do not thaw"; William James, Principles of Psychology (1890; reprint ed., Cambridge, Mass., 1983), 1066, 1077-78. 44.

Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith (New York, 1971), 309,310. Interestingly, Gramsci's discussion of mechanization focuses on printing, on the scribe become compositor, linotype oper- ator, or typist. The profession of the scribe, he points out, requires a certain for- malism; the scribe must "forget" "the intellectual content of the text he is reproducing" in order to "fix his attention exclusively on the calligraphic form of the single letters"; his "interest in the intellectual content of the text can be measured from his mistakes" (308, 309). Where most of Taylor's critics complained that mechanization transformed activities requiring talent and attention into mindless tasks, Gramsci suggests that An American Tragedy 97</page><page sequence="28">mechanization simply brings out the mindlessness inherent in labor and makes it easier to achieve-the linotype machine renders the scribe's effort of inattention unnecessary. 51.
