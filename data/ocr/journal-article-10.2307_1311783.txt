<plain_text><page sequence="1">Roundtable The ecology of grief For one species to mourn the death of another is a new thing under the sun. -Aldo Leopold (1949, p. 110) [One] who remains passive when over- whelmed with grief loses [the] best chance of recovering elasticity of mind. -Charles Darwin (1872, p. 366) 'H Tenry Mitchell titled his gar- dening column in the Sun- day, 8 April 1990, Washing- ton Post, "The demise of the dog- wood." He wrote the column shortly after the dogwood anthracnose (Discula destructiva) was first detected in the Washington area. It had been killing trees in New England and on the West Coast since the late 1970s and was already widespread in the Great Smoky Mountains. Mitchell in- terviewed Jay Stipes, an extension pa- thologist at Virginia Polytechnic In- stitute and State University in Blacksburg, who feared the disease could "annihilate the species." Mitchell's column stunned me. Memories of dogwoods came flood- ing back. Nonbotanists think bota- nists identify trees in winter by magic. But distinctive flower buds are part of the secret. Surely many plant tax- onomy students, facing their first test in winter botany, remember dog- woods' readily identifiable buds with a fondness like my own. Other Uni- versity of Georgia graduates, I am sure, remember Athens adrift in pink and white flowers in the spring. A fellow graduate student, a Califor- nian, referred to "dogwood clouds," and I remember her image every year when the dogwoods bloom in Wash- ington. Also, I remember my first wild dogwoods. Across a southern Illinois field, a few gloriously white-bloom- ing trees stood against a backdrop of by Phyllis Windle dark pines. I was doing field work with the man I loved, and those wild trees blossomed in my heart, too. Now, I have been following news of dogwood anthracnose for several years. Why, I wonder, did this bad news for the environment hit me so hard? Why do I want to commemo- rate the dying trees? I am an ecologist. Also, I am a trained hospital chaplain and chaplains are experts on death, dying, and grief. Finally, I realize: I am in mourning for these beautiful trees. My realization was slow in coming because almost all of the literature on grief regards human death. However, a significant number of professional veterinary societies and veterinary schools now research pet loss and counsel grief-stricken pet owners. Their work shows the similarity be- tween grieving for the human mem- bers of our families and for the ani- mals to which we are attached (Rosenberg 1986). Additional research indicates that other types of loss also cause grief. Reactions to the loss of an arm or leg and the loss of a home show similarities to the loss of someone we love (Parkes 1974). Reactions to job loss are much the same (Borgen and Amundsen 1984, cited in Herr 1989). Generally, mourning has certain recognized (if disorderly and chaotic) phases. Davidson (1984) put it in terms even a scientist could love: graphs showing the progression, over a two- year period, from the shock and numb- ness of the initial weeks of bereave- ment, to the months in which yearning, then disorientation predominate, to the longest period in which people reorganize their lives, internally and externally. At first, acceptance of death is intellectual. The later steps are of- ten more difficult but just as critical to recovery. These include emotional acceptance and the reshaping of one- self and the outer world to reflect the new reality (Parkes and Weiss 1983). During this period, feelings of sad- ness, anger, depression, and despair are common. Dogwood anthracnose stirs all these feelings in me. This disease also reminds me that no one becomes an environmental biologist for money: this science is a labor of love. For the love of species and places Biologists often love their organisms. Ecologists often love their field sites. Does anyone really doubt it? Read E. O. Wilson's work and speculate how he feels toward ants. Watch Jane Goodall interact with chimpanzees and ask what she feels for them. Read some of George Woodwell's essays, or Rachel Carson's, and gauge the depth of their passion. Listen to gradu- ate students when they return from the Organization for Tropical Stud- ies' field sites in Costa Rica and hear their awe, delight, and tenderness for the land. Probably others feel the same about Hubbard Brook and Coweeta; the mountain research stations in Crested Butte and Nederland, Colo- rado; Warren Woods and the biologi- cal station at Douglas Lake in Michi- gan; and all the other beautiful places we have studied, done research, and taught. Personally, this attachment some- times still embarrasses me. I was re- cently asked, in a television interview, how I felt about melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia), the nonindigenous tree that is displacing native vegeta- tion in and around Everglades Na- tional Park. Colleagues and I had been examining melaleuca-caused prob- lems, and I had already answered the predictable questions on the nature and severity of the trees' effects and what should be done. But how did I feel about the tree? I answered laugh- ingly that, as a botanist, I had to admire a tree that was so successful. I May 1992 363</page><page sequence="2">could hear the enthusiasm in my voice. Later, I repented my candor and prayed the editor would not make me look like an insensitive fool. This passion, this ability and will- ingness to admire and care about other species and places may be among bi- ologists' most admirable features. Our attachments may even be necessary and important. Nobel Prize-winning geneticist Barbara McClintock speaks about her "feeling for the organism," how intimately she knows the indi- vidual corn plants that comprise her research projects, and how much she enjoys that close knowledge. "Good science cannot proceed without a deep emotional investment on the part of a scientist," concludes McClintock's biographer Evelyn Keller (1983, p. 198). The factors that influence what work we choose and love are complex and psychological, as well as social, economic, and political (Herr 1989). These factors make biologists' attach- ments to nature complicated and deep. For example, I learned to be competi- tive at the knees of a much-older brother and sister. Now, I laugh that my dissertation was on plant compe- tition, a topic on which I evidently felt some long-standing expertise. Wash- ington is filled with agricultural policy analysts who, like me, found a profes- sional way to remain connected to our rural roots. Sometimes attachment to nature fills needs unmet by other people. Sylvia Earle, the oceanographer, found, among the plants and animals of the Gulf of Mexico, childhood con- solation for an unhappy move (Cohen 1991). Not only did McClintock's "feeling for the organism" provide her with unusual insight, it also pro- vided sustenance during times with- out much friendship or professional support (Keller 1983). Certainly my love of plants and natural beauty is a gift from my fa- ther, a lifelong gardener. Like him, I am more proficient at loving plants than children. Illinois' woods and fields salved my childhood loneliness. As I grew up, wild and beautiful places quite naturally came to represent not just sanctuary from painful events, but also the deepest mysteries of life and that which transcends our indi- vidual experiences. Although we rarely acknowledge the nature and depth of our biological and ecological loves, outsiders have a clear radar for them. Notice how quickly developers accuse us of caring more for spotted owls, snail darters, and wildflowers than for people. Our guilty backpedaling suggests we know they are right, at least about our love for the organisms and places in which we invest our life's work, if not about how people rank in our affections. Certainly the reporter who asked me about melaleuca knew enough scien- tists to anticipate an interesting an- swer if he asked how a plant ecologist felt about a tree. The importance of our relation- ships to the natural world should sur- prise ecologists less than others. Ours is a science of relationships. Usually, though, we do not consider our per- sonal attachments to the organisms and systems we study. Perhaps the ideal of the dispassionate observer stands in our way. Or perhaps women scientists notice these connections more readily. Maybe we needed more female peers before we could speak of these matters openly. I no longer doubt the importance or nature of my attachment to dog- woods. Nor do I feel alone in my grief for their loss. The grief of ecologists In all strict logic, the loss of a spe- cies of bird on some small remote island matters little to the future of the world. Even the irreversible loss of soil and vegetation from some eroded African hillside is a small thing. Yet people grieve....These feelings can not be embodied in the hard and brittle logic of science, but they may have truth of another kind, for all that. -Martin Holdgate (1990, p. 706) David Norton (1991) writes about the loss of an endemic New Zealand mistletoe, subtitling his article "An obituary for a species." Aldo Leopold (1949) entitles an essay about a favor- ite place, "Marshland elegy." I ask a US Forest Service pathologist about his reaction to dogwood anthracnose, and he speaks of his own depression. "It's sad," The Seattle Times quotes Jim Litchatowitch, a biologist, when officials declare the lower Columbia coho salmon extinct (Gwinn 1991). Ecologists are both blessed and cursed with seeing natural systems clearly. Thus, we see what is there and also know what is gone. I know that dogwoods formerly bloomed along Skyline Drive in Virginia and, for me, the forest understory will never look the same. Similarly, the loss of a forest system, not that of a single species, haunts Bill MicKibben (1989): The end of nature probably also makes us reluctant to attach our- selves to its remnants, for the same reason that we usually don't choose friends from among the terminally ill. I love the mountain outside my back door....But I know that some part of me resists getting to know it better-for fear, weak-kneed as it sounds, of getting hurt. If I knew as well as a forester what sick trees looked like, I fear I would see them everywhere. I find now that I like the woods best in winter, when it is harder to tell what might be dying. The winter woods might be per- fectly healthy come spring, just as the sick friend, when she's sleeping peacefully, might wake up without the wheeze in her lungs (p. 211). Likewise, Michael Soule's (1990) anguish regards broad ecological losses: As the number of exotics in most regions produces a cosmo- politanization of remnant wild- lands, there will be an agonizing period of transition, especially for ecologists....There are moments when the destruction of a favorite place, of entire biotas and ecosys- tems, seems unbearable and the future looks bleak indeed (p. 234, 238). Scientists and resource managers usually do not speak freely about this aspect of our feelings for the places and organisms that are part of our work any more than of our love for nature. "The sadness discernible in some marshes arises, perhaps, from their having once harbored cranes. Now they stand humbled, adrift in history" (Leopold 1949, p. 97). I treasure the poetry of Leopold's expression. I suspect, though, that it is on our faces, not the marsh's, that the sadness is discernible. Perhaps it is our discomfort with that sadness that sees a marsh in tears. Any chaplain would say that we do better by crying our BioScience Vol. 42 No. 5 364</page><page sequence="3">own tears. But mourning for ecological losses has no simple or predictable path. I suspect that ecologists, like other sci- entists, are prone to inhibiting the pain of grief. We are solidly attached to the life of the mind and, of the several steps experts consider essen- tial to recovery, only the first is intel- lectual. I speak from experience. I am tempted to dismiss my feelings for dogwoods as irrational, inappropri- ate, anthropomorphic. My arguments go like this: another tree will take the dogwoods' place; death is part of pro- ductivity, too; evolution removes as well as adds species. These arguments are all true. Timing is the key issue, though. Premature reassurance and pressure to accept a loss just short- circuit the grieving and recovery pro- cess. Our external, as well as our inter- nal worlds, may make environmental losses difficult to grieve. We have almost no social support for express- ing this grief. When I sit beside a hospital bed as a chaplain, I expect people to cry about the unwelcome changes they are experiencing. I ex- pect and accept patients' feelings that are dark and intense-rage at life's unfairness and guilt for doing too little, for example-and anticipate despairing questions about life's mean- ing. Their tears (and sometimes my own) are a sign of work well done. Honest conversations about grief that come quite naturally at a bedside are far more difficult at a lab bench or conference table. Thus, it is harder for me to speak freely about my grief for dogwoods with ecological colleagues than with fellow chaplains. Also, ambiguity and ambivalence make for a particularly difficult pe- riod of mourning. This factor is one that makes a person's recovery from marital divorce so formidable. Envi- ronmental problems often involve high doses of ambiguity. Where did dog- wood anthracnose originate? Is acid rain partly responsible for its spread? Are some trees resistant or not? Now, experts fear less for the total demise of the species but more for the loss of trees above, say, 3,000 feet in eleva- tion. Charles Fenyvesi (1991), for The Washington Post, calls out: "Hope for the dogwood" and others add new qualifiers (e.g., Kaufman 1989). So do I grieve for my lovely dog- woods? Or not? Reducing uncertainty and disbelief is an important part of getting grief off to a good start. For that reason, many hospitals and reli- gious groups stress seeing the body. In fact, this step is considered so impor- tant to coping with grief that it is built into certain hospitals' sudden-death protocols. But, with the dogwoods, it is unclear if I should look for bodies or cultivate hope. Even if I decided to grieve, how would I go about doing it? The usefulness of ritual People have always used rituals to help themselves mourn and recover from grief. For example, funerals usu- ally reinforce the awareness of loss, sanction remembering, enable feel- ings to be expressed, provide support, guide the needed reorganization of life, and affirm its meaning (Irion 1990a). Funerals and memorial ser- vices serve as a rite of passage between initial shock and the longer, more private phases of grieving. Not all mourning customs are religious, though. We give gifts, eat together, show group solidarity, and protect mourners-all ways to help the grief- stricken (Irion 1990b). The NAMES quilt-that collection of more than 14,000 fabric panels memorializing those dead of AIDS- is a particularly effective nonreligious ritual commemorating private and public loss. Constructing individual panels heals the makers; viewing the assemblage links those touched by tragedy. It has also become a power- ful means to educate people and to call for political action (see NAMES Project 1988). There are scientists among us who also think in terms of rituals, even funerals, for the species and places we are losing. The Wisconsin Society for Ornithology dedicated a monument to the passenger pigeon in a state park in 1947 (Leopold 1949). King and Dudley (1991, p. 249) note that ecolo- gists will gather, on 12 October 1992, where Columbus may have landed in the Bahamas to "conduct a funeral ceremony for the natural environment of the Western hemisphere. They will mourn the demise of the New World's natural heritage and the eradication of entire groups of indigenous Carib- bean people." This is dramatic stuff, perhaps too outrageous for many ecologists' tastes. The importance of rituals in helping mourners cope is undisputed, how- ever, and I see no reason why ecolo- gists should not tap this resource in these difficult times. We could create a quilt of our own, with panels to celebrate the species we have loved and lost. We could hold a wake for a precious piece of land-gathering to tell stories of the field trips, research, and academic degrees that one par- ticular place provided. We could cre- ate a family album, filled with the recollections of our professional grand- parents, writing about the natural ar- eas they have loved and lost in their lifetimes. We could create a special memorial fund to invest meaning in our losses. Our mourning rituals could celebrate, too, and affirm our faith in the processes of ecology and evolu- tion. We could note the remaining beauty of the earth, the birth of new species or subspecies, and the grand rhythms of the biogeochemical cycles. Most of our contemporary mourn- ing customs are important in the first weeks and months of the grieving process (Irion 1990b). I suspect that ecologists are more likely to need sup- port in a longer, continuing way. En- vironmental losses are intermittent, chronic, cumulative, and without ob- vious beginnings and endings. Thus, we may have to devise our own, unique customs. But they might be customs much needed by a society facing many kinds of transitions. The benefits of grieving well Experts urge us to grieve not only for its benefits but also because failure to grieve can have such far-reaching con- sequences. Generally, problems origi- nate in two ways. Mourning can be- come excessive and prolonged, leading to chronic grief from which recovery never seems to come. Alternately, we can inhibit the process. Then it be- comes distorted, and grief emerges in different forms (Parkes 1974). The results are not trivial. Unresolved grief is the underlying cause of problems for as many as 20% of the people treated at some substance abuse cen- ters (Davidson 1984). Grief is not pleasant, as anyone knows who has mourned a child, a parent, a close friend, or a spouse. At May 1992 365</page><page sequence="4">the same time, it has its own bitter- sweet richness and intensity. Charles Darwin (1872) concluded that griev- ing serves us well in the long term. Colin Murray Parkes' 1974 landmark elaborates this idea: Willingness to look at the prob- lems of grief and grieving instead of turning away from them is the key to successful grief work in the sufferer, the helper, the planner, and the research worker....We may choose to deal with our fear by turning away from its source....But each time we do this we only add to the fear, perpetuate the problems, and miss an opportunity to prepare ourselves for the changes that are inevitable in a changing world (p. 195). Times of transition are times of opportunity and any confrontation with an unfamiliar world is both an opportunity for autonomous mastery and a threat to one's estab- lished adjustment to life....But there are some life changes which, be- cause of their magnitude or be- cause of a particular characteristic, carry a special risk of producing, not maturation, but dislocation (p. 194). Perhaps the transition ahead for ecologists is just such a risky one. This makes it especially urgent that we do our grief work. What might we get from tackling this seemingly unpleasant task? People emerge from grief with new insights about their relationship to the de- ceased and renewed energy for loving again. The benefits might extend far beyond our individual recovery. Aldo Leopold's work is a case study. Rob- ert Finch (1987) describes Leopold's evolution, with the themes of environ- mental loss as a way station, as "a necessary, important sojourn in the wilderness of loss, ignorance, and self- education from which Leopold will finally wrest his holistic 'land ethic"' (p. xxvii). As ethicists and others explore the underpinnings necessary for our care- filled treatment of the earth, they of- ten return to this same idea: the im- portance of the nature and depth of our relationships to other organisms and to the earth. Kellert (1987) sug- gests that, for an environmental ethic to succeed, nature would need to be meaningful to us on a variety of levels, including the emotional. Here again, it is ecologists' deep attachment to organisms and systems that is our strength-a potential model for oth- ers to emulate. What might we need to model this process? "Fortitude," says Soule (1990, p. 238), "when the temptation to turn and walk away is almost over- powering." Also, we shall need pas- sion, commitment, creativity, energy, and concentration. We shall have none of these if we fail to grieve (alone and with each other) for the magnificent trees, the lovely animals, and the beau- tiful places that we are losing.
