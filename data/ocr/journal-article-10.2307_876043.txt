<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT MUSEUM ACQUISITIONS Frequently exhibited and published, it has most recently been in New York in the exhibition 'The Machine as seen at the end of the Mechanical Age' at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in I968-69. Klee's 'Winterliche Maske' (National Gallery of Canada) ALTHOUGH the Winterliche Maske by Paul Klee (I879-I940) is classified as a drawing, it is still large and monumental enough to give the impression of a painting, the first on this scale by Klee in Ottawa's collection (Fig.4I). Neatly labelled and classi- fied on the mount by the artist as I925 V 3, it comes from that difficult time in which Klee was caught in limbo between the closing of the Bauhaus in Weimar, where he was still living, and his move in 1926 to its new headquarters in Dessau. Full of visual puns, delicately balanced on the disc below the neck, it is painted with apparent detachment, largely stencilled and stippled, the brush only used for the red touches of paint on the cap and for the black eyes. It is enigmatic in a way that is reminiscent of Fish Magic in the Philadelphia Museum or Around the Fish of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, of 1925 and 1926. Formerly in the Ida Bienert Collection, it was bought from Nathan in Zurich in I967. Rouault's 'Les Deux Filles' (National Gallery of Canada) OTHER works by Georges Rouault (1871-1958) at the National Gallery of Canada represent Man's redemption including three Crucifixions - a drawing for the Miserere, a good impression of a coloured print and a gouache which was a recent gift of G. Hamilton Southam. As a result this early water-colour and pastel of Deux Filles (Fig.42) is not only important as an early work, dated I906, but one which explains the fervour of Rouault's later religious preoccupation. Juxtaposed against contemporary Fauve paintings in the collection, a Derain of I905, a Braque of 1906, a Vlaminck of I908 and a Van Dongen of I909, its sober blues seem particularly joyless. At the same time, in the freshness and intensity of the water-colour and the boldness of the characterization it is a commanding work. These two prostitutes, nearly contemporaries of Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon, are almost as brutally rendered as their five colleagues in the Picasso - but with greater compassion. The poignancy seems even more intense than some famous related paintings by Rouault including The Prostitute and The Mirror in the Musee National d'Art Moderne in Paris. It was formerly in the Witzinger Collection, Basle, and was bought from the Marlborough Gallery, London, in I967. David Smith's 'Wagon I' (National Gallery of Canada) IN 1968 Wagon I by the American sculptor, David Smith, was acquired by the National Gallery of Canada (Fig.43). It comes from that particularly productive period in Smith's life, beginning with his months in Italy for the Spoleto Festival of 1962 and ending with his tragic death in a motor car accident in May I965. Most of his late works fall into two series, the silvery, burnished, stainless-steel Cubis or the colourful, painted Zigs, but among them, quite different from the rest, are three Wagons. The source of inspiration for the Wagons seems to have been his Italian stay. Of a man who could say 'I'm interested in all art', it is not unreasonable to suspect the influence of Etruscan bronzes. But there is also a suggestion in the brown-black painted steel assembly of parts of the scrap iron pieces at Voltri, the deserted factories where the Italian government had encouraged Smith to work. And there could be a wistful memory of the flatcar he was given but had to abandon and about which he said later: 'I could have loaded a flatcar with vertical sheets and planes ... I could have made a flatcar with cloud ends... In a year, I could have made a train.' Smith, himself, described his wagons: 'It's a kind of iron chariot, on four wheels, with open linear elements', and he also explained 'They are too heavy for people to handle so I put wheels on them'. Actually Wagon I is more humanly scaled than this would suggest and also, with links to Smith's surrealist past, more anthropomorphic. Wagon I, which was exhibited in the memorial exhibition of Smith's work at the Tate in 1966, was bought from the Smith estate through the Marlborough-Gerson Gallery in 1968. It is now to be seen in the retrospective exhibition arranged by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum; in its catalogue Edward Fry describes Wagon I as a 'robot centaur of the machine age'. Jackson Pollock's 'No. 29' (National Gallery of Canada) JACKSON POLLOCK'S No0.29 of I950 was the first large American abstract expressionist work to enter the collection of the National Gallery of Canada (Fig.44). Since gesture is such an important element in abstract expressionism, this work has a particular significance as the basis for the film Jackson Pollock of 1951 by Hans Namuth. Pollock worked on glass so that Namuth could photograph his face as he painted. The sheet of plate glass was placed on trestles outside on a sunny and cold autumn day, and Pollock was filmed putting the wire mesh, the strings, the pebbles and the pieces of coloured glass into place, rearranging them and finally binding them to the surface with black and aluminium paint, which he poured, manipulating it in the air with his stick, directly from their cans. Since the painting is on glass there are two images - the recto a coloured, crustaceous surface, the verso a black and silver record of the movements Pollock used in making the painting. In spite of the presence of Namuth's camera, Pollock succeeded in synthesizing the muscular ryhthms of his body, the unconscious energies of his mind and the inert objects from his environment into harmonious and even lyrical forms on the sheet of glass. No.29, which was acquired from the Pollock estate through the Marlborough-Gerson Gallery, New York, in 1967, is the only existing painting by Jackson Pollock on glass. Letters 'St John the Baptist preaching' in the Galleria Palatina SIR, I see in the March issue the attribution by Marco Chiarini to Elsheimer of a copper panel from the old Medici Collections belonging to the Galleria Palatina (No.366) showing St John the Baptist preaching. The suggestion is most stimulating and will not fail to arouse interest among specialists. 451</page><page sequence="2">40. The Mechanic, by Fernand Leger. Signed and dated I920.
