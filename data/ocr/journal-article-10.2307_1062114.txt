Gerard Manley Hopkins An improved reading of a cuneiform sign on two seal inscriptions datable to the Kassite period offers me the excuse to reopen the discussion of a problem related to an interesting aspect of Meso- potamian religious life and thought. The problem concerns the meaning of the expression pu u lisanu (also written (d)KA (u) EME), literally meaning "mouth and tongue." The following interpretations have been offered so far: E. Ebeling suggested that the words refer to a representation of a mouth and a tongue ;1 B. Landsberger saw in them a designation for one of the "Fiirsprache-G6tter,"2 while K. F. Miiller spoke of "personifizierte Sprechwerkzeuge."3 The words pu u lisanu occur in only a few Assyrian rituals, in prayers of the s u . i 1 a type (see below, p. 259), and in the above- mentioned short inscriptions found, with slight variants, on three 1 MVAG, XXIII, Nos. 1-2 (1918), 49. 2 MAOG, IV (1928-29), 311, n. 2. 3 "Das assyrische Ritual," MVAG, XLI, No. 3 (1938), 29.

E. Ravn discussed these inscriptions in "A Kassite Seal from Hama" but misread the sign EME (= lisdnu) as SAG (see below, p. 260, for details).5 The only document likely to shed some light on the expression pu u lisanu is the ritual KAR 139 ;6 all other references offer only very limited contexts. KAR 139 is the copy of a small and early Assur tablet,7 which is translated here in its entirety: As soon as the "right moment" is at hand, the owner of the sacrificial animal enters the bit eqi. In the bit eqi he approaches, from the right, the sacrificial table which stands in front of the sacred KA.EME. He lights the censer,8 which is in front of the sacred KA.EME, with the torch in his hand. He (then) takes the torch in his left hand and twice pours aromatics on the censer in front of the sacred KA.EME. He breaks and scatters one la'tu-bread cake9 upon the sacrificial table. Twice, he offers(?)lo the bowlll (with the food); twice, he empties the libation goblet with beer into the kirru-vat. He (then) scatters mixed incense on a niknakku-censer.12 He places one sassurtu-object weighing half a mina of lead before the sacred KA.EME (and) prostrates himself. The sangu-priest blesses the owner of the sacrificial animal, saying: "The sacred KA.EME will intercede for you with the goddess Istar; it will take up your casel3 before Istar, and then Istar will assign you a 4 The inscriptions run as follows: k ar 1 dU t u, k a r 1 dMES, ki d u g k a. e m e(!), a. b a. g i n.

The fact that the censer called niknakku, a Sumerian loan word, appears in the same text points to a difference in shape and possibly in function between these two utensils, apart from the fact that sehtu occurs only in Assyrian, niknakku in both Assyrian and Babylonian texts. 9 The designation NINDA la'tu remains obscure. It apparently occurs only here. 10 The verbal form used, u-ka-sa, must be taken from a base kasu or kussul but cannot mean "to cool off." We may have to assume here a specific Assyrian cultic term denoting the ritual gesture with which the food offering was presented to the deity, corresponding to isutuqu (CAD sub etequ A mng. 4e) and subu'u (CAD sub bda'? B). For such gestures, see my Ancient Mesopotamia (Chicago, 1964), pp. 188, 192, and n. 16. 11 The word mdkaltu denotes a large, shallow bowl made of wood or copper (see CAD sub itquru); it is attested in secular use in the Old Babylonian period and appears later on in Assyrian texts almost exclusively in cultic or ritual use. 12 The word is spelled here ni-id-na-ku. 13 The main termini technici for intercession with a deity are abbuta sabdtu and damiqti PN qabai; see CAD and AHw under these words. 251</page><page sequence="3">Analysis of an Assyrian Ritual (KAR 139) fate of happiness and good health as bright as this burning torch.14 So pay attention to the secret teachings15 of Istar."

Istar will watch over your "Mouth-and-tongue." Subscript: Scenario for the ceremony (lit. the "right time") in the great bit eqi sanctuary of Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta. The text of the ritual is replete with rare words and alludes time and again to concepts and practices of which we know next to nothing. The reason for this is that KAR 139 takes us straight into a little-known section of the religious life of Mesopotamia, to be more specific, into the substratum world of native Assyrian customs and beliefs where what we know through the bulk of the religious literature is of no help to us since it belongs to the Sumero-Babylonian tradition. As its subscript indicates, the tablet KAR 139 contains the scenario18 (tallaktu) for a specific cultic occasion, called simunu, "right moment" (see below, p. 253 and n. 19). The ritual clearly falls into two scenes and describes with rare explicitness the dromena and the legomena, that is, what is to be done and what is to be said during the religious act in which two "actors" are en- gaged. One of them is the supplicant who, as the one who has brought the sacrificial animal, is referred to as "owner of the animal," the other is the priest (called sangl) of Istar. The stage is not the temple as such but a sacred locality called the "house of the equ," (for which see pp. 256 ff). The distribution of roles is the following: the supplicant performs in two parallel scenes acts of adoration directed not toward the goddess herself but toward certain cult objects. The priest does not participate actively in the ceremony; he only speaks, that is, he pronounces declarations in 14 For namru, denoting the light of a burning torch, see CAD sub dipdru usage b. 15 Text: [abata u] pirilta, restored after reverse 5. 16 The reading dE +TAR4 Xd AN-[e] is suggested by the copy but cannot be verified because the tablet was already lost when the copy was made from an unidentified photograph. 17 The use of the verb suteslz (amata), "to betray a secret," is well attested, especially in omen texts. 18 The word tallaktu is ordinarily used to denote a path, a corridor of access, a water course, the gait of a person, etc.; only in the Middle Assyrian instructions for making perfumes (see Ebeling, Or. NS XIX [1950], p. 277) does the term refer to procedures and ways of doing things. Our use of tallaktu for ritual is therefore to be considered, in this instance, typically Assyrian. 252</page><page sequence="4">the name of the goddess Istar after each of the two scenes of the ritual. Though the tablet is broken at its lower end, the following re- construction can be suggested on the basis of what is left of the text. The ritual's two parallel scenes each consist of an act of worship and a subsequent pronouncement by the priest. The latter is preserved in both instances, the former only for the first scene, though enough of the text of the second scene is extant to warrant the assumption that both scenes are basically parallel. The dif- ference lies in the objects to which the supplicant's cultic acts are addressed: In the first scene it is a symbol called piu u lisdnu, that is, "Mouth-and-tongue," which is also expressly referred to in the priest's answering speech, while in the second the designation of the object addressed is lost. However, since the priest speaks in his answer of the "Istar of the heaven," we assume that the supplicant performed his second act of worship before a symbol designated by this phrase, most likely because it represented Istar as a stellar deity. Only the specific nature of the act of wor- ship performed before the latter remains lost. From the utterances of the sangu-priest it can be learned that both acts are part of one religious undertaking: to approach the goddess Istar in order to obtain her help in distress. The outstanding feature of the complex ritual performed on the occasion called in our text simunu in the locality referred to as bit eqi is the avoidance of a direct approach to the deity. The supplicant, moreover, although expressly called the "owner of the sacrificial animal," only offers a meal consisting of a bread cake accompanied by a libation of beer. The "service" itself does not come to its end with the presentation of the meal, as is the norm in Mesopotamian sacrificial repasts, but is followed by a. speech of the priest, who promises that the goddess will show favor to the supplicant-under certain conditions. Some of these difficulties can be resolved if one connects the lack of reference to a sacrifice and the use of the term simunu, "right moment," by assuming that our tablet (KAR 139) repre- sents only one part-the final one-of a longer and more complex ritual. Possibly the "right moment" for the ritual here described was ascertained by means of either cultic manipulations (such as extispicy) or other calculation,19 after the sacrificial animal had 19 Possibly, if my restoration of Istar Sa same is correct (see n. 16), an astro- nomical event, such as the heliacal rising of the planet Venus, could have con- stituted the "right moment" (simunu) to approach the deity and her symbol, the eight-pointed star. This would time the ritual in the evening (see pp. 257 if). 253</page><page sequence="5">Analysis of an Assyrian Ritual (KAR 139) suffered its fate and the supplicant had presented his case in a formal prayer. All this could well have been described in another tablet which does not happen to be preserved. At the "right moment"-whatever this may imply-the supplicant was then admitted into the bZt eqi to perform there first the described act of devotion before the Mouth-and-tongue symbol and then-in the lost section-a second, parallel act before another object of worship. These two scenes are not meant to be cumulatively effective but rather to converge through different channels of approach upon the goddess Istar; in the first step, the supplicant reaches the symbol called Mouth-and-tongue which is supposed to intercede for him with the goddess; in the second, he addresses himself to another symbol, probably that of the planet Venus which, as the priest assures him in his second speech, will intercede in the same way for the supplicant. Then only will the goddess grant him what he must have prayed for during the ritual which entailed the sacrifice of the animal. All this reflects a religious background which is in many respects "un-Mesopotamian." The essential differences, in my opinion, lie in the role and the function of the priest, in the fact that the bless- ings and the fulfilment of the prayer are specifically conditioned by the supplicant's behavior, and, finally, in the fact that the rules for this behavior are kept secret. As already indicated, the sangu of our text does not officiate but speaks for the goddess Istar; he does this in much the same way that the sangu-priest of Assur "speaks" for his god in the course of the Assyrian coronation ritual.20 Basically, the Mesopotamian (specifically, the Babylonian) priest acts as a personal servant of the deity to whom he offers hymnical praise and opulent sacrifices, all of which, ex opere operato, affect the deity, that is, assure good will or bring about reconciliation. In our Assyrian ritual, however, the devotee is the one who performs cultic acts to express his relationship to the deity while the priest stands, so to speak, on the divine side of the chasm that separates the god from his supplicant. The priest appears as the spokesman of the deity and, as such, he represents a type of priest entirely different from the Mesopotamian. Conversely, the supplicant is granted in our ritual a more active cultic role, with a heavier moral responsibility placed upon him inasmuch as he has to assume certain permanent behavioral obligations in order to have a claim on the goddess' favor. It thus seems that the effects of ritual and devotional acts 20 See Miiller, op. cit., p. 12, col. ii, 11. 30-36. 254</page><page sequence="6">addressed to the deity are, on the particular level of Assyrian religiosity which finds expression in our ritual, neither automatic nor solely dependent on the grace shown by the deity; they are in certain essential respects the consequence of the devotee's behavior, the rules for which must have been known to him pre- viously. This would mean that the relationship between god and man is not in the mood of the servant-master pattern, where sub- mission and acceptance of favor and disgrace are dominant, but rather in that of a "covenant." The specific terms of this relation- ship between man and god are hidden from us by carefully enjoined secrecy. In the passages under discussion the word piriltu ("secret") appears in an unparalleled nuance. Usually the Akkadian word refers to political secrets and to those of special, advanced levels of scribal (that is, scholarly) knowledge, as well as to the secrecy which guards from access certain parts of a temple or any other sacred locality. In no other context does piriltu denote the secrecy that surrounds a body of rules imparted in some way exclusively to a particular group of worshippers of a deity. This, of course, reflects a relationship well known in the phenomenology of religion, that is, the existence of a cult organization based on secret teach- ings meant to ensure spiritual happiness and other blessings for the members of the cult. It is somewhat astonishing to find such direct evidence for cult organizations in Mesopotamia, although scattered indications pointing to the existence of similar groupings are not unknown.21 Still, the blunt statement in our ritual that the observance of the "word" and the "secret" of Istar (abata u pirilta sa Istar ) ensures vigor and good health is startling, especially because no indication whatsoever is available which could shed light on what specific behavior was required of the members of this religious group. One could suggest that they consisted in the participation in certain secret rites (involving otherwise in- admissible practices), or that they were comprised of food taboos, certain bodily mutilations, etc., rather than that they implied merely ethical or moral prescriptions which would not have 21 Two Old Babylonian references may be mentioned here. In Szlechter Tablettes (Paris, 1958), p. 122, MAH 16.147:2 ff., a text from Sippar, we read about "the sons of gods and goddesses who live in the hinterland" (mdre iii u mare iRtar sa ina libbi mdtim wasbu) and have to pay certain taxes in barley in Sippar. The late Old Babylonian letter CT 4, 1:5 (=VAB VI, No. 238) speaks of a rebel leader with a foreign ("West-Semitic") name who sends messages to his brothers, his sons, and to the members of the "people of his god" (ana ahhesu maregu u mare ni6i ilisu) to incite them against the government. Both passages refer, however, to situations outside the frame of urban Mesopotamian civilization and should therefore be treated as reflecting alien social and religious settings. 255</page><page sequence="7">Analysis of an Assyrian Ritual (KAR 139) warranted such secrecy. Most likely, however, we shall never know about the teachings of this Assyrian "mystery" religion centered in some manifestation of the goddess Istar, nor about the size of the group, nor the social status of its members. Apart from this central problem, a number of other questions related to our Assyrian ritual require discussion. The question foremost among them concerns the nature of the sacred locality, the bit eqi, in which our ritual takes place. Occurrences of this word in texts from Assur, from Urartu (or referring to this country), and from Phoenicia suggest a non-Mesopotamian institution. The passages which contain either bit eqi or equ are listed in the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary under equ, equ in bit eqi, and eqfitu.22 Their curious disparity can only mean that we still have not grasped their precise meanings. In some references, bit eqi is the designation of the innermost room or part of a temple belonging to a female (never a male) deity; in other places, the term equ by itself seems to denote a cult object. Such an equ is once said to be dedicated to the god Adad;23 its removal is referred to in a Neo-Assyrian letter by using the verb nakdsu, which usually denotes the felling of trees.24 This is hardly sufficient to suggest that the equ was a pillar-like sacred object, but it should make us aware of the fact that the bit eqi might actually have been that part of a sacred locality where the equ was set up. The reason for the appearance of the bit eqi only in temples belonging to female deities (note also the divine name Belet-eqi, Lady-of-the-equ) remains unknown; we also cannot tell why we find in our ritual two symbols (Mouth-and- tongue and Istar-of-the-heaven) in the bit eqi, but no equ-symbol. An interesting point may be raised with respect to the nature of the bit eqi. The supplicant, so our text informs us, is supposed to enter this part of the sanctuary with a torch. The torch is to be used to light the censer, presumably filled with charcoal, in front 22 The word eqitu should rather be interpreted as an adjectival plural referring to the nature of the sacrificial animals. Hence, the basic meaning of this substrate word could well have been in the realm of "holy," "sacred," and the like. 23 Note in this context that the thirteenth tablet of the series HAR . r a = hubullu (MSL VIII/1 p. 22, 1. 163) translates u d u . k i. dI k u r. r a ("sheep for the sacred place of the god Adad") by im-mer e-qi ("sheep for the equ"). The enumeration of gods in STT No. 400, 11. 16 ff. (= KAR 142 i 39 ff.) lists dE-qu among the demons of Anu (asakku sa dAni) in 1. 19 (= KAR 142 i 39). 24 The pertinent passage in Iraq XVII (1955), pl. 31 and p. 130, No. 13:8 ff. appears in a letter found at Calah, sent to the Assyrian capital by an Assyrian official stationed at the mainland settlement of Tyre, USSu. It reports: "Nergal- iddin cut down the equ of his (referent unknown) temple (lit. the house of his gods) which is in the neighbourhood of Sidon (saying): I will move it to Tyre. They (referent unknown) stopped him (from doing) this (and now) the equ which he (Nergal-iddin) had cut down ["lies" or "is kept"] at the foot of the mountain." 256</page><page sequence="8">of the sacred Mouth-and-tongue. The explicitness of the scenario in this respect is quite unusual and so is the simile used by the priest when he speaks of the brightly burning torch to which he likens the bright future of the supplicant promised him by the goddess. One can hardly avoid thinking of the entire scene as being enacted either in a completely dark room or in a courtyard at night (see n. 19). Either possibility would add to the impressive force of the ritual enacted: the mystes, after having served a sacral meal to the Mouth-and-tongue symbol, lies prostrate in the darkness lighted only by his torch and hears the message of the goddess spoken by the priest-or one should rather say, by her "prophet," in the Greek sense of the word prophetes ("speaker"). At this point in the analysis we should discuss the ceremony of the repast, which is carefully described. First, incense is poured on the glowing censer, presumably to perfume the air in preparation for the service. Second, a bread cake called la'tu is served, broken into small pieces. Third, the food is offered twice to the sacred symbol on a shallow bowl in a special way, for which the unique term kusszi is used, probably referring to the ritual gesture of offering, and a libation is made with each serving by pouring beer from a goblet into a vat.25 Fourth, a mixture of incense is scattered on a different type of censer. The repast is terminated formally by the presentation of a lead object called sassurtu26 to the symbol; it is quite customary27 in Mesopotamian rites to offer small gifts to the gods on such occasions. The entire sequence shows certain deviations from Meso- potamian practices of serving food offerings to gods as an act of adoration. The number of new words in this description-terms such as NINDA la'tu (see n. 9), mdkaltu (see n. 11), and kussu (see n. 10)-demonstrates the unique nature of the ritual. Most 25 I would suggest that the reading of the sign AB with inscribed MAL (read kirru on p. 251) should remain open because the described practice of making a libation by pouring a liquid from one container (maqqu2) into another (DUG. ABxMAL) is again atypical. If my suggestion of the chthonic overtones of our ritual (see p. 258 on kasdpu) is acceptable, one could assume that the supplicant poured the beer into one of those containers placed underground which seem also to be mentioned in Sumerian temple hymns (see A. Sjoberg in a forthcoming study on aruitu). All this brings to mind that Assyrian houses apparently contained an installation dedicated to the cult of the deified ancestors or manes (called lisikuti) as can be seen from the legal text VAT 8923 published by E. Weidner, AfO, XX (1963), p. 121 if., esp. p. 122, commentary to 1. 2. 26 I take this hapax to denote one of the rhombical representations of the female genitals which have been found in quantities in the more recent temple of IStar in Assur, made of artificial lapis lazuli. The word sassurtu is derived from ?asurru, "womb." 27 Cf., e.g., the gold and silver kamkammatu rings (each weighing one-third of a shekel) presented to the gods of the night, in An. Bibl. XII (1959), p. 286:95. 257</page><page sequence="9">Analysis of an Assyrian Ritual (KAR 139) important, however, seems to me the use of the verb kasdpu, denoting the breaking, or better, crumbling of the bread before it is actually presented to the symbol. The verb kasdpu is elsewhere character- istically used in connection with offerings of bread to the spirits of the dead to whom alone crumbs are fed in Mesopotamian rites.28 Does the use of this verb in our ritual have a special meaning due to the nature of the divine being thought to receive such offerings? Was there a basic, theological, difference between the practice of serving conventional dishes of food, such as prepared meats, sweetened cereal dishes, bread, etc., to human-shaped images and that of scattering bread crumbs to the invisible spirits of the dead? Possibly the ultimate destination of the offered food did influence the ritual: the dishes shown to the gods29 are eventually consumed by the personnel of the god and have to be conventional for this reason, while the food dedicated to the chthonic powers was to be discarded. One may, therefore, suggest two possible explana- tions for the use of the verb kasdpu in our ritual; either the non- anthropomorphic type of "feeding" was used because the symbol called Mouth-and-tongue had no human features, or else the entire ceremony had chthonic connotations. The latter possibility, which seems to fit the earlier suggested nocturnal setting, would pre- suppose that the Istar adored here as the center of a secret-cult organization had likewise a chthonic background. This, however, is purely speculative at the moment.30 We now turn to investigate the nature and role of the sacred object called in our ritual Mouth-and-tongue. The words pui u lisdnu (dKA u EME and similar purely graphic variants) are so far attested only in texts from Assur31 and in the Middle Baby- lonian seal inscriptions mentioned at the beginning of the present study. The references can best be divided into two groups, one in which Mouth-and-tongue appears as the designation of a physical 28 For akal etemmi, "bread for the dead," see CAD s.v. etemmu lexical section. 29 Cf. simply my Ancient Mesopotamia, op. cit., p. 190. 30 I would envisage the possibility that the suggested chthonic character of our ritual be related to the very purpose of the cult organization centered in Istar. Such associations could well have been established in the desire to care for the dead. The existence of associations concerned with funeral practices and offerings for the deceased is well attested-though not from Mesopotamia proper. Still, in the historical texts of the first millennium which come from Assyria, an increased concern for installations for the dead and the protection of their remains can be observed, and this seems to fit the explanation just offered. 31 It is probably only an accident that no Kuyundjik copies containing parallels to the passages in which pi u lisanu occurs on tablets from Assur are known to me. The British Museum fragments 82-3-23, 44 and K.8181 end and begin respectively at 11. 5 and 14 of KAR 59, while our word is on 11. 12. 258</page><page sequence="10">object of worship, and one in which it refers to a specific super- natural phenomenon producing certain effects. The dKA.EME mentioned in the lines 2, 3, 5, 9, and 10 of our text is clearly a physical object; this is likewise the case in the Assyrian coronation ritual KAR 137 ii 10, where a dKA.EME is listed among representations of minor deities.32 In the famous tdkultu ritual from Assur,33 KAR 214 iii 14, we find one of the long-winded enumerations characteristic of this text, which addresses, first, the land of Assyria, then its fortresses, fortifica- tions, watchtowers,34 etc., even its tells and ruin hills, and even- tually turns to the enumeration of all sacred localities in Assyria, beginning with dKA.EME.MES, that is, Mouth-and-tongue monu- ments,35 and continues with dsukku, dnemedu, [parakku], kummu, and jakku; all these are special sanctuaries, or better, sacred structures either incorporated into a temple-type sanctuary or standing alone as open-air monuments, platforms, small cell-like buildings, etc. Although not much information can be culled from the tdkultu passage, it does suggest that many structures called dKA.EME existed in Assyria connected with, and probably also independent from, sanctuaries. The second group of references occurs mainly in passages taken from prayers. The s u . i 1 a prayer addressed to the god Nusku (Assur tablet KAR 58), demands: "May a favorably inclined edu spirit and favorably inclined (female) Lamassu spirit accompany me every day," which is a standard request in such texts, but the prayer continues and asks, in line 38, pu u lisdnu (var. KA.EME) liqbdz damiqte ("May Mouth-and-tongue say favorable things (about me)," i.e., may they intercede for me). In a similar vein, a prayer to Ea, also on an Assur tablet (KAR 59, r. 12), uses the phrase: "May my words be pleasing before my personal god and goddess,36 may god and king do what I want, 32 These are dLahmu and dGUD DUMU dUTU: see Frankena, op. cit., p. 100, No. 126, and p. 90, No. 66, respectively. 33 The takultu as a ritual, apart from its relation to the New Year's festival, etc., belongs to a body of typically Assyrian traditions which are connected with what we much too inadequately call "banquets." To a considerable extent, the relations between deity and worshipper (note, e.g., ABL 65, r. 8-9), king and subject, are formalized in Assyria by acts of ceremonial commensality which should be studied as social and religious phenomena. 34 The very rare word madgaltu occurs here in a broken passage: ma-ad-ga- [la-te-su]. 35 The MES sign after KA.EME need not be taken to indicate that the word refers to a "Doppelgestalt" (Muller, op. cit., p. 28) since the other, syllabically written, words are likewise in the plural. Note, however, the plural verb in the passages cited below. 36 See my Ancient Mesopotamia, op. cit., p. 199. 259</page><page sequence="11">Analysis of an Assyrian Ritual (KAR 139) may Mouth-and-tongue pray for me (pi u liHdnu listemiquni)37 and no [evil] affect me!" Then there are the mentioned seal in- scriptions, representing, at the moment, the only occurrence for pu u lisdnu from outside Assyria; they contain the phrase ki DUG. (GA) KA EME (var. kt tdb puz u EME) in the following context: "To spare is in the power of Samas, to save in the power of Marduk, (but) how sweet are the Mouth-and-tongue, who can equal you (in this respect), Lady of Eanna?" This pious formula seems to place the divine power of the lady of the temple of Eanna, that is, again the goddess Istar, above that of the great gods Samas and Marduk with respect to capability and perhaps also intention (note especially the exclamation "how sweet," which refers to the graciousness of the goddess) to help a sufferer. It may even indicate that the acts of the great gods are but the consequence of Istar's grace and intervention.38 The cited passages of the second group have one feature in common: They expect the phenomenon called Mouth-and-tongue to produce favorable utterances on behalf of the person who turns to the deity in prayer. In KAR 59 the recipient of the message is to be the god Ea; the act demanded of the symbol is a prayer, as the verb sutemuqu indicates, which can only mean that the Mouth- and-tongue is to "pray" to Ea on behalf of the supplicant. The prayer in KAR 58 turns to Nusku; it is clear, however, that the "favorable things" to be "said" by the Mouth-and-tongue are meant eventually to reach Anu, the father of Nusku; Nusku functions here as elsewhere as an intercessor between his father and those who pray to him. Somewhat different is the situation in our text where the words pu u lisdnu occur in both meanings: referring to an object (see above) and to a supernatural phenomenon. In the latter respect, however, a difference has to be noted; according to line 10 ("the 37 The verb sutemuqu has nothing to do with the adjective emqu (and formations derived from it) as the distribution of their Sumerian correspondences shows. 38 A welcome confirmation for the assumption offered here that the goddess addressed represents a goddess especially concerned with intercession comes from a small group of references which speak of an Istar called Istar-tesmetu, "the Istar-of-grace." In the town Zizza, which is mentioned in the texts from Nuzi, there was a gate called bab dU (=Istar)-te.es-me-tum (HSS XIII, No. 417:3=RA XXXVI [1939], p. 126) and in a Neo-Assyrian letter (ABL 644, r. 2) the door leaves of dINNIN GI . TUK (= Istar-tesmetu) are mentioned as being repaired. The same Sumerian name of this goddess recurs on an unpublished Middle Babylonian seal with a prayer addressed to her. This ties in with the fact that we have found the formula pu u lisdnu (in connection with the Lady of Eanna) not only in Assyrian texts but also in a prayer on another Middle Babylonian seal. For the problems involved in the Akkadian divine name Tasmetu and similar sounding designations of a western goddess, see for the time being H. G.

The correct understand- ing of this formula is essential for the understanding of the words pu u lisdnu.39 The following points emerge from the analysis of the text KAR 139 as a basis for an interpretation of the phenomenon under dis- cussion: (1) the words pu u lisdnu denote a physical object of worship to which prayers are addressed by a supplicant; (2) the object "transmits" these prayers, likewise called pu u lisdnu, to the goddess Istar for her to take up the case of the supplicant; (3) this the goddess does by "transmitting" (lu tassur) the prayer "communicated" by the symbol to its ultimate destination, the great gods who determine the fate of the sufferer. Though Istar functions here as an interceding deity, she herself does not act in that role but makes use of a sacred symbol which apparently belongs to her.40 In the ritual KAR 139 the goddess appears thus in two basically different roles: first as the center of a secret cult association, and, second, as a mediatrix, an intercessor with the gods on behalf of suffering men who turn to her sacred symbol, called Mouth-and- tongue, in order to reach out effectively toward the distant gods. The role of mediation and intercession as a means of bridging the gap between man and the great gods, in whom alone is vested the power to improve and change his personal fate,41 is of con- siderable importance in Mesopotamian religion. The supplicant relies heavily upon the services of intermediaries to reach these gods, as is well known from the prayer literature. Intercession requested by the supplicant is enacted on several distinct levels which I would like to characterize here succinctly before trying to relate the problem of our text with these religious concepts. A prayer addressed to the goddess Tasmetu demands of her to 39 The break in the tablet makes it difficult to ascertain whether the fact that the formula occurs at the end of the second speech of the priest-so to speak as the very essence of the message of salvation-is meaningful or not since the end of the first utterance is lost in the break. 40 Outside of the Istar cult, other interceding gods, especially Nusku, function in relation to the Mouth-and-tongue. There, however, the "communication device" called Mouth-and-tongue does not seem to be used, or, at least, is not expressly mentioned. 41 See my Ancient Mesopotamia, op. cit., Index s.v. "Destiny." 261</page><page sequence="13">Analysis of an Assyrian Ritual (KAR 139) plead with her husband, Nabu, for the supplicant ;42 another asks of Erua to do the same with her husband, Marduk.43 Likewise, the spouse of the god Samas, Aja, and his beloved chariot driver, Bunene, are asked in a prayer to act as intercessors with their lord and master.44 This may well reflect court practices. We know from the correspondence of the Neo-Assyrian court that members of the royal family and high officials were able to influence their king's opinion in favor of their friends. Out of the same considerations, Nusku, the grand vizier "who directs everything" (mutta'ir mimma sumsu) is addressed in a series of prayers,45 either directly or by the medium of his "symbol," the lighted lamp,46 to intercede for the supplicant. The demands for intercession expressed in prayers to the god- desses Gula and Belet-ili47 are to be classified differently. The basis of their supposed influence upon the great gods is not so evident. One could suggest that Gula as a chthonic deity had a role similar to that of Istar, or rather, of an Istar figure connected with the nether world (see above, p. 258). This, however, does not seem to be the case with the less well-defined figure of the goddess Belet-ili, who may owe her position to her status as the mother of the gods. While in all these instances the effectiveness of divine inter- vention is envisaged on the social level, those divinities whose special and sole function seems to have been to establish some sort of direct and immediate contact between man and deity act on a purely magical level. They are characterized by their telltale names which are in fact orders given to them; such names are "Listen-Always-to-Prayer" (Sitamme-kardbu), "Intercede-for- Me" (Qibi-dumqz), "Watch-His/Her-Utterance" (Usur-amassu/a), and "Watch-Their-Utterance" (Usri-pisunu). Other names are descriptive of their activities, such as "He-Is-Gracious" (Isme- karab), "He-Intercedes" (Iqbi-dumqi),48 and "His-Utterance-Is- Favorable" (Magrat-awassu). These are all minor deities-though at certain periods and in certain contexts their importance is 42 E.

Possibly certain statues or other representations in a given sanctuary were thought of by the pious as being more effective in transmitting prayers directed to the great gods than others and were therefore given such names. A somewhat similar practice can be observed in the epithets and designations of Egyptian images and statues of deified kings, as shown, for example, by Eberhard Otto.50 Our sacred object with its strange name cannot be simply related to the divinities with their "speaking" names, even though their function is to a certain extent comparable with that of the pui u lisanu. Both have one characteristic in common: They pur- port to establish a direct and more effective "line of communica- tion" between the supplicant and his god than the approach via prayers and rituals can achieve. The supplicant turns to the specific intercession deities presumably because they provide in some magical way an immediate contact with the great gods whose reactions then affect his personal protective gods either directly or through some message or command.51 The situation with regard to the symbol called Mouth-and- tongue and its functioning seems to have been more complex, and I offer here a theory suggested by the few known facts discussed in this analysis. I propose to see in the symbol an "instrument" to relay prayers to the gods. The object, obviously in the form of a speaking mouth, functions as a means of communication with the deity and is, as such, under the special protection of the goddess Istar. She safely guides (the text uses here the verb nasaru, see p. 261) the message conveyed, likewise called Mouth-and-tongue, to its final destination. The exact relationship between Istar and the symbol remains somewhat obscure, but it may well be 49 See Ch.-F. Jean, RA XXXI (1934), 167 ff. "Usur-amatsu et Usur-amdtsa." 50 Gott und Mensch (Heidelberg, 1964), pp. 28-29. 51 Thus, Gula is asked to bring about by her command (qibitu) and consent (annu) the reconciliation of the supplicant and his personal god and goddess (see Ebeling, Handerhebung, p. 46, 11. 85-86). She is also sent (luspurki ana ilija zeni istarija zeniti [ibid., p. 30, 1. 14 and p. 46, 1. 81]) to these protective beings for the same purpose. Note furthermore that a strange and apparently very potent charm (DINGIR.HIYL) is asked (ibid., p. 82,1. 112) to bring about reconciliation between the supplicant and his personal god and goddess. These and similar passages show that the suffering individual felt himself more immediately dependent upon the good graces of what we call his personal protective spirits than upon the great gods and that he seems to have called upon the latter primarily to influence his protectors. Apparently, the personal gods could not be approached by means of the formal prayers of the s u . i 1 a type, which were reserved for the great gods. 263</page><page sequence="15">Analysis of an Assyrian Ritual (KAR 139) suggested that the goddess addressed here as "Istar" and acting as an intercessor-"as an advocate with the Father" (I John 2:1)- harbors in some of her sanctuaries the symbol Mouth-and-tongue which serves, so to speak, as the apparatus effective in bridging the gap between god and man. This role of Istar is attested in the cited texts, which date from the second half of the second millen- nium B.C. and come from Babylonia as well as Assyria. The specific combination of Istar the intercessor with Istar the center of a secret-cult organization, however, seems to be Assyrian only or, more exactly, represents substratum concepts reflected in certain types of religious texts originating in the Middle Assyrian period.52 Analyses of the kind here attempted, which focus on Akkadian texts describing ritual performances, seem to me to promise a better yield for investigations concerned with Mesopotamian religion than a study of purely literary expressions of religious thought and attitudes. On hymns and prayers, not to speak of theogonies and the artificialities of most of the extant mythological concoctions, a long and complex history has left its telltale im- print. They are burdened by poetic elaborations, enlarged and embellished by stylistic accrescences and other secondary develop- ments. Gestures, simple ritual acts, and formulae, however, are more likely to remain constant and to resist elaboration. As such they may well reflect more immediately basic-and earlier-con- cepts and attitudes than written documents can do. In the analysis here offered, the attempt has been made to utilize the evidence of such material to illuminate the crucial god-man relationship in the Mesopotamian civilization. We have precious few avenues of access to this core of the religious world: the inventory of pious personal names; the conceptualization of the self-experience of Mesopotamian man, which I have tried to describe in the chapter 52 In the texts from Nuzi, more specifically, in JEN 448, 454, 455, 462, 464, and AASOR XVI, Nos. 30 and 33, the phrase p4 u lisanu likewise occurs in a very specific context. Here is a characteristic example: "His mouth and his tongue made the Habiru PN (coming) from Babylonia, enter as slave into the (household of) Tehiptilla" (JEN 455); another one comes from JEN 462: "Their mouths and their tongues have given these three men, PN, PN2 and PN3 (coming) from the country GN, to Tehiptilla to be slaves." Texts of the same nature replace "mouth" and "tongue" by ramdnu, "self" (cf., e.g., "the Habiru-woman PN has made herself enter the household of Tehiptilla as slavegirl" in JEN 452) and so indicate that the use of the words mouth and tongue is meant to stress that the persons mentioned, voluntarily and with their expressly formulated consent, sold themselves into slavery. 264</page><page sequence="16">"Mesopotamian Psychology" in my Ancient Mesopotamia ;53 and the religious basis of Mesopotamian divination.
