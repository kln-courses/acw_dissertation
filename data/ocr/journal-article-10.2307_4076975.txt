Auk A Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erthrocephalus) Destroys Its Own Eggs.-Preceding June 16, 1930, Red-headed Woodpeckers were noted carrying food to their nesting tree. Accordingly, assuming that the young were hatched, and determined to obtain them for banding, the writer, armed with banding tools and a saw to be used to provide an entrance to the cavity (with the use of a saw the artificial entrance can be replaced, leaving the nest practically unchanged in appearance) ascended the tree and opened the cavity, amidst protests from the adult birds. Much to my surprise and exasperation the eggs were not hatched. After rearranging the nest I retired to the ground permitting the resumption of incubation duties. I had no sooner descended the tree and withdrawn to a distance of some twenty feet when one of the adult birds appeared and alighted on the nest stub at the orifice to the nest. After a critical examination of the exterior it ventured into the nest cavity. Presently it reappeared at the opening with an egg in its mouth. This was taken and lodged in the top of a fence stake ten rods from the nest. This performance was repeated until the entire clutch of three eggs was deposited in fence stakes at distances vary- ing from ten to twenty rods from the nesting tree. The bird then flew to a nearby feeding station and proceded to feed on corn placed there for its use. A call to other duties terminated observations at this time. The site was visited one hour later to find the Red-head engaged in eating the shell from the eggs. Incubation was found to be nearly complete. An explanation of the reason for this drastic action would seem to be extremely complex, involving an essential understanding of bird psy- chology. While possibly revealing nothing of intrinsic value it is inter- esting to speculate as to the possible factors that moved this bird to destroy its own possessions: was it the result of a spasmodic or convulsive impulse or did the bird reason that I was about to destroy its eggs, and decide to destroy them first, thus, prohibiting me from "getting the start of it"? Possibly these suggestions are attributing too anthropomorphic qualities which obviously would be unwarranted.-PAUL A. STEWART, Leetonia, Ohio.</page></plain_text>
