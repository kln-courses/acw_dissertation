<plain_text><page sequence="1">Harappan Ring-Kernoi: A Study by B. M. Pande A ? fragment of a pottery kernos ? circular tube with small vases set at intervals ? associated with the mud brick embankment ? was found in the recent excavations at Mo? henjo-daro, conducted by Dales (*). His view that the object had ? not hitherto been reported from Harappan sites ? (2), does not appear to be totally correct, for a few other like examples have been unearthed at Harappan sites. In the excavations at Harapp? (3), a similar object was found in the Great Granary area. But for the variation with regard to the form of the vase, the object from Harapp? belongs to the same class of objects as the latest Mohenjo-daro example. The fragmentary Harapp? kernos has only one extant vase resembling a cup with a splayed-out mouth and plain featureless rim, as against a miniature-sized globular jar with a narrow neck and ex? ternally-curved rim of the Mohenjo-daro specimen. In the same group of vessels may also be included two more examples ? one each from Mohenjo-daro and Harapp? ? which are lodged in the Central Antiquities Collection, Safdarjang Tomb Baradari, Archaeological Survey of India, New Delhi (4). The earlier Mohenjo-daro specimen, which is also fragmentary, has two intact vases, akin to the Harap? p? one. The other specimen, from Wheeler's excavations at Harapp?, has only the half segment of the tube surviving and the vases are broken and lost. (*) The author is deeply beholden to his colleagues Shri M. S. Mani and Shri A. K. Ghose for the drawings, accompanying the paper, and to Shri Sital Banerji for his all-round help.

Morphological Details of the Harappan Kernoi That the four specimens ? two each from Mohenjo-daro and Harapp? ? belong to the same class of objects known as kernos, is beyond doubt. This is obvious from their general shape and characteristic features comparable to the ones found in a vast area outside India and in large numbers. All the four specimens are composed of a circular tube made of terracotta, varying in outer diameter from 15 cm. to 9.6 cm. (5) and the inner from 11 cm. to 6 cm. with small cups or vases set at intervals and having perforation at their bottom so that the tube which serves as a support provides a common base for their interconnection. Three speci? mens ? one from Mohenjo-daro and two from Harapp? ? are in red ware, well-fired, of medium to fine fabric, the vases being attached over the perforated portion of the ring or the tube by means of applique technique. The details of the four specimens are as follows: 1. Fragment of a pottery ring-kernos from Harapp? (6). Harapp?, No. 2348, Find-spot 17/15, GG Area F, Depth 5'4". The ring has an outer diameter of 15 cm. and inner 11 cm. Only one cup is surviving, its diameter being 32 mm. and is attached to the tube by means of applique method. The tube is flat at the bottom. The total height of the object is 4.4 cm. Red ware, medium to fine fabric and well-fired (figs. 1, 15). Fig. 1 - Fragment of a ring-kernos from Harapp? Fig. 2 - Fragment of a ring-kernos from (= fig. 15). Mohenjo-daro (= fig. 16). (5) The details of the ring-kernos discovered by Dales from Mohenjo-daro are omitted from the present paper as these are not available to the present writer. The description is based on the plate published alongwith Dales's paper referred to above. (6) Vats, op. ext., pi. LXXI 76. 312</page><page sequence="3">2. Fragment of a pottery ring-kernos from Mohenjo-daro. Mohenjo-daro 49.251/2961, Hr. 267 (7). The tube has an outer diameter of 9.6 cm. and inner 6 cm. Only two cups are surviving out of the total seven (?). The two cups are identical in shape and form and have an everted rim. These are also attached to the tube by means of applique tecnique. The tube, which is flat at the bottom is not circular in section but slightly elongated. The overall height of the object is 5.6 cm. out of which the height of the tube and the cup is 2.8 cm. respectively. Red ware, cream-slipped, medium to fine fabric (figs. 2, 16). 3. Fragment of a pottery ring-kernos from Harapp? (8). (HP XXIX-30, LXVIII-LXXII, depth 5'2", 2A) (9). None of the cups or vases attached to the tube is surviving and the tube is nearly one-half intact. The remnant of the tube shows three holes where the cups were attached by applique technique. From the distance in between the three cups it is likely that the specimen, when complete, had in all, eight cups. An interesting feature of this example is that the perforation on the upper portion of the tube continues down to the lower one, the latter however, being much smaller. Red ware, self-slipped, well-fired and of medium to fine fabric (figs. 3, 17). 4. Fragment of a pottery ring-kernos from Mohenjo-daro. Only one vase is intact which differs in form and shape from examples 1 and 2. Other details are not available (figs. 4, 18) (10). Fig. 3 - Fragment of a ring-kernos from Harapp? (= fig- 17). Fig. 4 - Fragment of a ring-kernos from Mohenjo-daro (= fig. 18). (7) This object has not been described by Marshall in whose excavations it was found. (8) This object is from the excavations at Harapp? by Wheeler in 1946 and, like the previous examples, has been omitted in the interim report, R. E. M. Wheeler, ? Harappa 1946: the Defences and Cemetery R 37 ?, AI, 3, 1947, pp. 58-130. (9) My colleague, Shri Sital Banerji, who was present in the excavations at Harapp?, informs me that the object was found near cemetery R37, Burial 5 and probably belongs to the mid-levels of the Harapp? Culture. Wheeler's report totally omits the mention of Trench XXIX too. (10) Photograph by courtesy of George F. Dales of the University of Pennsylvania, U.S.A. 313</page><page sequence="4">2. Distribution of Ring-Kernoi outside India The kernoi have a wide distribution both in space and time. The distribution in time ranges from about the middle of the 4th millennium B.C. to the early centuries A.D., and, in fact, to the modern times in certain parts of the world The area of distribution includes Greece (and the islands), Crete, Cyprus, Israel, Egypt and modern Iraq (and the peripheral regions). An attempt has been made here to present an overall picture of the chrono-cultural distribution of the kernos, without, however, attempting a quantitative analysis. The main focus of distribution of the kernos is mainly Greece, Crete and the adjoining islands, where these occur for the first time in the Early Minoan (c. 2500-2100 B.C.) and pre-Mycenaean (c. 2500-1800 B.C.) levels and continue to be in use right through the Middle Minoan (c. 2100-1500 B.C.) to Late Minoan (c. 1550-1150 B.C.) down to the late Greek and Roman times (c. 6th cent. B.C. onwards). Thus a continuous tradition of use can be discerned for an interminable period of about three thousand years, the tradi? tion surviving even in the modern times, with subsequent modifications and alterations, in the Greek Orthodox church (12). To name a few of the sites where these objects have been found, covering this vast chrono-cultural span we may include the following: Palaikastro (13), Kourtes (14), Hagios Ni i11) Nearly half a century ago, the subject was dealt with in an illuminating paper by S. Xanth oudides, ? Cretan Kernoi ?, Annual of the British School at Athens, XII, 1905-1906, pp. 9-23. The subject was further analyzed, in the wider context of the Minoan-Mycenaean religion: see M. P. Nils son, The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, Lund, 1927, pp. 113-18, 387-90. I have relied heavily on the data furnished by these scholars, while supplementing the information from the later excavation reports. The inclusion of compartment ed vessels and two or more vases around a central stem by Xanthoudides has been examined in sufficient details by various scholars. For the purpose of the present study, only ring-kernoi have been taken into account. The other types, classed as kernoi by Xanthoudides, and examples of which are forthcoming from the Indian sites, will be a topic for a separate paper. (12) Xanthoudides, op. cit., pp. 20-23. Atten? tion may also be drawn to a modern kernos from Tiflis in the Ethnographical Department of the Museum of Basel, described in the accession register as ? Puzzle-drinking vessel ? (Vexiertrink gefasse)-, see J. L. Myers, ? A Modern ? Kernos ? Vessel from Tiflis?, Man, XXXVII, 1937, art. no. 30, pp. 25-27. (13) At this site was found a ? clay cover with a conical pierced top and a kind of door in the side, decorated with a frieze of birds ... [which] served as covers for lamps ... [which] were set on the kernoi, when they were decked for ritual use?: see R. M. Dawkins, ?Excavations at Palaikastro III?, Annual of the British School at Athens, X, 1903-1904, p. 221. (14) Nilsson, op. cit., pp. 116-17, fig. 19. This kernos consists of a ? hollow ring (diameter 19 cm.) upon which six small jugs with narrow necks and spreading mouths are placed alternately with three coarsely made human figurines, of which one holds his arms to his head, another to his breast, while the third grasps the handles of the vases next to him. As Xanthoudides justly remarks, this very peculiar feature connects the vessel with the group of dancing women fastened on a common ring-shaped base from Palaikastro ? {ibid., p. 95, fig. 7); see also Xanthoudides, op. cit., pp. 15-17, fig. 3. 314</page><page sequence="5">kolaos (15), Mycenae (16), Eleusis (17)&gt; Phylakopi (18), and certain stray examples from Crete whose exact provenance is not known and are lodged in various museums (19). In the same family of vessels are included generically connected vessels (other than the ring-kernos) which have been considered as kernoi by various scholars (20). These include: compartmented vessels, vases around a central stem, dish-on-stand-like objects with two pendant interlacing double-loop handles (21), and ? vases of a kernos, of unknown prov? enience in Athens, with a vaguely anthropomorphic handle consisting of a long loop sur? mounted by a moulded head and with small arm-like projections recalling those of a herm ? (22). Vessels of the above-mentioned categories, and different from the usual ring-kernoi have been found from this area and cover almost the same period. The Knossian example, from the EM II (c. 2200-2150 B.C.) levels, which Evans considered a prototype of the kernos (23) has its echo in the example from Olynthus ascribable to early 4th cent. B.C. (24). These ring-kernoi from the Greek and Cretan sites provide interesting ramifications of (15) Xanthoudides, op. cit., pp. 18-19, figs. 4, 5. (16) Nilsson, op. cit., p. 117, fig. 21; A. Furumark, The Mycenaean Tottery, Analysis and Classification, Stockholm, 1941, pp. 69, 618, fig. 20, Type 197. A variant of the ring-kernos Type 197 ? has a number of small vessels attached to the ring and communicating with the interior ?. Some of these have also attached to them plastic serpents, bulls* heads and perching birds. There is also another example of a curious combination of a ring-kernos with a conical rhyton. This vase has a hollow ring round the upper part, to which four small vessels (communicating with the ring) had been attached. (17) Here were found kernoi with covers. An interesting feature being a deep cup in the centre inside which was placed a lamp ? and surrounded by small vases all around. The covers, which have been reported elsewhere (Phylakopi and Palaikastro) too, were perforated and domical in shape: see Dawkins, op. cit., p. 221; Xanth? oudides, op. cit., p. 18. (18) A ring-kernos having ten cups around the central bowl: Nilsson, op. cit., p. 114, fig. 16; T. D. Atkinson et al., Excavations at Phylakopi in Melos (Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, Supplementary Papers, 4), London, 1904, pp. 27, 102, pi. VIII 14. The Melian example ? like the one from Hagios Nikolaos ? found in a Cycladic grave near Phylakopi, provides a sort of a via media in between the ring-kernoi and elaborate kernoi having series of cups around a central stem from Melos, now in the Sevres and the British Museum: see R. C. Bosanquet, ?Notes from the Cyclades?, Annual of the British School at Athens, III, 1896-1897, pi. IV 1-4, pp. 54 ff. (19) L. D. Caskey, ? Recent Acquisitions of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston?, AJA, XL, 1936, p. 313, fig. 10. This Late Mycenaean ring kernos has five small vases (an amphora, two kraters and two fragmentary vessels) at intervals and having perforations at the bottom, bull's muzzle pierced by three holes and two birds on the top of the twisted handle. This kernos has also been discussed by J. L. Myers, Man, XXXIX, 1939, art. no. 169. Myers takes it to be from an early phase of the transition from the ?Late Minoan III ? culture to the earliest Iron Age. (20) See above, note 11. (21) From Olynthus: see D. M. Robinson, Excavations at Olynthus, XIII, Vases found in 1934 and 1938, Baltimore, 1950, pp. 406 ff., pis. 246, 247, nos. 1021, 1022. (22) A. D. Ure, ?

(24) Robinson, op. cit. In the light of the examples from ancient Crete, it is tempting to consider the Harappan dishes-on-stand and cups on-stand as ritualistic vessels. The Olynthus example, however, has an additional feature: there are two rings hanging from the dish. (For a brief survey of comparable types from sites out? side India, see J. Marshall, Mohenjo-daro and the Indus Civilization, London, 1931, I, pp. 295 96, where Marshall has dealt with the brief history of offering stands. According to him, these vessels were used for ritual purposes as also for ordinary use.) 315</page><page sequence="6">the original type of the kernos having simple cups or vases fixed on rings. These elaborate specimens have, on a ring, along with vases, human, animal or bird figures, handles, etc. At times, these Cretan kernoi are also painted by means of simple geometrical patterns or elab? orate floral motifs (25). The evidence from Cyprus, likewise, is of a vast time-span and a variety of shapes and forms of the ring-kernos. In fact, next to Crete, the maximum types and number of ring kernoi are found from the sites in Cyprus. The period covered ranges from the Early Bronze Age or Early Cypriote (c. 2400-2000 B.C.) to the Iron Age {c. 1050-950 B.C.) with instances of ring-kernoi occurring as late as the Hellenic period. These have been found there, mostly from the tombs and probably forming part of the funerary furniture. This is evidenced by the examples from Lapithos (26), Vounoi (2T), Tomb of Engomi in the Famagusta District (28), and certain stray examples of uncertain provenance from Crete (29). These Cypriote examples like the Cretan ones, show elaborate types: the one from Vounoi which has four vases and cups on a ring, has a vase surmounting another (30). The earliest example from Egypt is from Sedment and is datable to the IX-X Dynasty (c. 2271-2197 B.C.) (31). A later example from the Temenos of Aphrodite in Naukratis (32), can be placed in between the 6th and the 3rd cent. B.C. Ring-kernoi are fairly common in the sites in Israel (incorporating the Syro-Palestinian sites). Interesting specimens from the area can be seen in Jericho &lt;(33), Gezer (34), Megid do (35), Hazor (36), Beth-Shan (37), etc. and are datable from the Early Bronze Age (c. 2900 2100 B.C.) to the period of the Assyrian rule (c. 8th-6th cent. B.C.). (25) For example, a Mycenaean ring-kernos: cf. Nilsson, op. cit., p. 118, fig. 21. (26) E. Gjerstad, The Swedish Cyprus Ex? pedition 1927-1931, Stockholm, 1931, I, pp. 134 ff.; II. pis.

However, there is an example of a ring-kernos from Stratum IX (c. 3200 B.C.) of Tepe Gawra (38) and a fragmentary example from the Diyala region (39). An interesting point worth mentioning is the discovery of certain ring-kernoi from Mesopotamia belonging to the Parthian period (40). 3. Typological Details of the Ring-Kernoi from Sites outside India As compared to the kernoi from the sites outside India, the Harappan examples are very simple and comprise only cups or vases attached to a ring (see above, pp. 312, 313). The examples from the vast area referred to above, however, are elaborate and show a variety of ramifications, not only with regard to the ring-base but also in case of the objects which were affixed on the ring. Thus, an example of a ring-kernos of the White Painted II va? riety from Cyprus has, over an elaborately painted ring with a basket handle, bull's and goat's heads, pomegranates and miniature vases (fig. 5) (41). Another beautiful example of the Late Mycenaean (c. 1500-1100 B.C.) times, again from Cyprus, comprises ? a ring upon which three vessels, two with narrow mouths and one cup with a handle, and a bull's head is fastened ? (42) (fig. 6). A specimen from Vounoi (see above, p. 316) is again an interesting type, for, it has not only different kinds of vessels over the ring, but the ring itself stands on four solid legs (43) (fig. 7). The ring-kernos from Naukratis, Egypt, though of later period, also stands on legs and on the ring (both being painted) are ten jugs and handles alternately (fig. 8) (44). Probably of the late Greek or Roman times, the kernos from Haghios Nikolaos (45) (fig. 9), is a combination of a ring-kernos and a pedestalled bowl. This seems to be an evolved variety and typifies a combination, of which the earliest example is from a Cycladic grave near Phylakopi, Melos (46). The Palestinian examples, notably from Megiddo and Gezer, are again of an elaborate type. The Megiddo specimen (fig. 10) has, on a ring base, one gazelle head, two ampho? rae, two pomegranates, two doves and one cup which all communicate with the hollow base. The gazelle head is decorated with red lines, has pierced eyes and orifice through mouth; the other pots or birds are also painted or decorated likewise (4T). The Gezer examples also have alternating figures of birds and pomegranates (fig. 11) (48). sylvania Museums Journal, XX, 1929, p. 69. See also A. Rowe, ?

Conclusion That the object kernos ? ring-kernos or the other types ? had ritualistic function in ancient Greece, or is a cult-object in the Me? giddo cult, is beyond doubt. In Cyprus, more often than not, these are found in graves as a part of the funerary furniture. This is evi? dent from their location in a site (wherever found from the excavations) connected with cult, rituals or as accompanying the dead. Even the shape of the ring-kernos ? clearly the result of a complex evolution ? and the variety of forms or objects represented on the ring-kernoi prove that they were ritualistic vessels. Ancient Greek and Roman literature attests to this fact. Harrison (52), while discussing the Kernophoria, has described two types of kernos on the authority of Athenaeus and the scholiasts on Nikander etc. The first of these was a winnowing fan (53) which in the begin? ning was a simple agricultural instrument, but was subsequently mysticized by the religion of Dionysus. But there was another kind of kernos, which, according to Athenaeus, was ? a vessel made of earthenware, having in it many little cups fastened to it ?, in which white poppies, wheat, barley, pulse etc. were kept. It was thereafter carried aloft and certain rites were performed and was distrib? uted to those who had done so. Athenaeus also gives a long list of the contents of the kernos. From Eleusis, where such an object had been found in the excavations, are also Fig. 13 - Ring-kernos from Melos. New York, 1962, Part 2, p. 919. The same author has discussed elsewhere (Part 1, p. 502) the Eleusinian mysteries in which the harvest thanks? giving rite Eleusinia is described. (52) J. Harrison, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion, repr., London, 1961, pp. 158 160, 548. (53) Ibid., p. 159. See also G. Jones, Dic? tionary of Mythology, Folklore and Symbols, 320</page><page sequence="11">available accounts of the officials mentioning a vessel called xeoyvog, which is identical to the kernos of Athenaeus. An early specimen from Melos (fig. 13) (54) is a beautiful example dovetailing the various types of ring-kernos, pedestalled ring-kernos and vases around a pedestalled stem. This example has two rows of circles of vases over a pedestal: the inner circle has ten cups and the outer fifteen (55). The kernos from Haghios Nikolaos, again an example of the composite variety, is im? portant, for, ? inside it was found a clay lamp with one wick and two holes in the cov? er ? (56), which conforms to the description given by the scholiast on Nikander. According to Xanthoudides, ? the kernos was a sacred vessel not used exclusively at the Eleusinian mysteries, but also in the worship of other gods, as is known from the cults of Rhea Cybele, Attis, and the Corybantes ? (57). It is thus obvious that the kernos ? the ring-kernos or the other types ? was a vessel connected, in ancient Greece and Crete, with harvest and used in the related festivals. In Cyprus, where these have been found in the graves, we have a clear proof of their connec? tion not only with the dead but, ipso facto with the living too. The ring-kernoi from Israel, which might have ? originated in the footed ring-vases of early Cyprus and Egypt ? (58), have pomegranates, doves, gazelles on them (see above, p. 318). These are symbolic and mark ? its function in the fertility cult ? and the minia? ture jars ? contained wine, the fruit of the grape ?. Thus, ? the kernos ring was probably for libations: the liquid would be poured into the cups to circulate throughout the doves, pomegranates, and jars, symbolizing the fertility of the earth and the fructifying of its produce ? (59). In the light of the above, the question arises about the use of the Harappan ring kernoi. But the limited number available from the Harappan sites suggests these to be intrusions rather than a component part of the cultural equipment of the Harappan Culture. We may, however, envisage in their presence, an attestation of clear-cut intercultural rela? tionship of the Harappan Culture not only with those which were contiguous, but contem? porary. In the absence of the complete stratigraphical data ? sadly lacking in the earlier reports on Harapp? and Mohenjo-daro by Vats and Marshall and even by Wheeler ? it is (54) R. C. Bosanquet, ?Notes from the Cyclades?, Annual of the British School at Athens, III, 1896-97, pp. 54, 57-58, pi. IV. Bosanquet has discussed, in some details, the ritualistic associations of these vessels in the light of Greek tradition and literature. (55) Numerous other examples have also been described by Bosanquet, ibid. (56) Xanthoudides, op. cit., p. 19. (57) Ibid., p. 19, also quoting Harrison, op. cit., pp. 158 ff. (58) May, op. cit., pp. 17 f. (59) May, ibid. Mention may be made here of ? a polychrome pottery vase, 2Va in. in height (no. 7788), shaped like a pomegranate. Its ground is painted white, but the scheme of decoration in red and green is worn past recognition ?. This object, from Harapp?, was found in Mound F, Great Granary Area, Stratum III. The kernos too, was found in the Great Granary Area. See Vats. op. cit., I, p. 28; II, pi. LXXI 21. 321</page><page sequence="12">difficult to pin-point the exact period of contact and we can only feel secure by saying that the discovery is yet another example of cultural interrelationships (60). Even if we presume that the kernos was absorbed as a cult object by the Harappans, the answer is supplied by the fact that the sub-stratum of the urban Harappan Culture was primarily agricultural. In the sophisticated urban social structure of the Harappans, the cognate agricultural cults were improvised and improved into which such objects as the ring-kernoi were incorporated as the cult paraphernalia. In view of the above, even the dishes-on-stand and the cups-on-stand should not be dismissed as mere utilitarian vessels, but should be invested with ritualistic meaning (61). The discovery of the ring-kernos from Harapp? (see above, p. 312, figs. 1, 15) is important since it was found from the Great Granary Area, where all the agricultural produce was stored. Finally it would be of interest to mention here another example of a kernos from Taxila (fig. 14) (62). This object, datable to the beginning of the Christian era, is compa? rable to the various kernoi of the complex variety described above. Marshall has described it as follows: Sk' 14-218; Block F; sq. 73-74'; stra? tum III. Perforated bowl of red clay with three triangular holes in sides. Diam. 4.5 in. Hollow roll rim with marks on top of three attach? ments (Plamps), which are missing. This perforated bowl, according to Mar? shall, served some ceremonial purpose and has analogues. He states, ? somewhat similar va? ses are common in Cyprus, and their bottoms are often similarly perforated ?. This object, which comes from the Parthian levels at Taxila, provides yet another example of inter cultural relationships, while proving also the continuation of the idea which got deep-rooted into the Indian cultural sub-stratum. Fig. 14 - Kernos from Sirkap, Taxila. (m) While analysing the influence of the Aegean on the contemporary cultures, Helene J. Kantor writes, ? The importation and occasional imitation of Aegean objects in Egypt and Asia as well as the oriental goods found in the West demonstrate that a taste for exotic objects existed among the peoples of the ancient world. The appearance in any country of foreign objects, acquired by trade or as tribute, testifies to far less significant connections than those which resulted in the actual adoption of alien cultural traits by another civilization. When such exchanges occured they must have been made possible by fairly continuous and frequent encounters between the areas in question, enabling people to acquire familiarity with some aspects, at least, of foreign civilizations?: H. J. Kantor, ?The Aegean and the Orient in the Second Millennium B.C ?., A]A, LI, 1947, p. 56. (61) More so in the light of the examples from Knossos and Olynthus: see above, notes 21, 24. (62) Marshall, op. cit.; see also above, note 50. 322</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 17 - Fragment of a ring-kernos from Harapp? (= fig. 3). Fig. 18 - Fragment of a ring-kernos from Mohenjo daro (= fig. 4).</page><page sequence="14">In the context of the aforesaid facts, it would be worthwhile to include an example of ? a hollow-bottomed ritualistic vase with a flared-up base and long narrow neck and decorated with plant motifs ? which has recently been discovered from Khana-Mihirer Dhipi, West Bengal (63). Belonging to Period V (c. 8th-10th cent.), this vessel, according to the excavator, was ritualistic in purpose. Though not in the main line of the ring-kernoi, it perhaps represents the culmination of the concept of the ritualistic vessels, which had their remote origins in the Mediterranean and were introduced into India during the Harap pan times. It is thus a pointer towards the absorption processes of objects and thereby of ideas, which still persist in the contemporary cults, rituals and the associated objects. (63) I A, 1963-64, p. 64, pi.
