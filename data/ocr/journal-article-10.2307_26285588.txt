<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SHATTERED MODERNISM OF MOMADAY*S HOUSE MADE OF DAWN Larry Landrum Over the past twenty-five years, scholars and teachers have cele brated the art and investigated the cultural sources of N. Scott Moma day's House Made of Dawn. The book has been an inspiration to and a monumental influence on the resurgence of American Indian writing and has served both as an example of the diversity of contemporary American literature and as American Indian art.1 It has been fitted into a whole range of interpretive literary and cultural frameworks so that it serves various conservative and liberal artistic and cultural needs. It is a testament to the robustness of the novel that it has borne up so well under the weight of this attention. However, more recently critics have discussed the use made of House Made of Dawn as a token of negotiation between an implied American Indian experience and a broader vicarious consumption of Native American culture.2 Though the text appeared over a quarter of a century ago, it is more contro versial now than when it was published. A large part of the anxiety about the text is its proximity to the intersections of a currently painful war of aesthetic, cultural, and political discourses. For the most part, critical attention to the novel has evolved into an issue which opposes two kinds of claims: those tied to creative traditions of Euro-American MFS Modern Fiction Studies, Volume 42, number 4, Winter 1996.

THE SHATTERED MODERNISM OF MOMADAY*S HOUSE MADE OF DAWN Larry Landrum</page><page sequence="2">764 Momaday's Shattered Modernism art and the critical perspectives associated with them and those begin ning with the question of the authenticity of Indian representation. While recognizing the text's modernist structure, both perspectives tend to converge, somewhat misleadingly I think, in their emphasis on Momaday's intention and a set of expectations growing out of the assumption that a Romantic or Realist paradigm structures the details of the story.31 want to shift the terms of this discussion, however tem porarily, to a third consideration. The text's strategy is not to infuse a modernist structure with an overlay of realism as most critics imply but to shatter the modernist display-case that represents cultural diversity without cultural substance. Clearly House Made of Dawn signals conflicting tendencies in mix ing cultural representation with the structural and stylistic features of the modernist novel, and an effect of this has been to confuse critical readings. In the following pages I will first examine Romantic/realist perspectives in order to prepare for a different way of looking at the text's means of coping with modernist hostility to cultural specificity. The text's strategy is neither a formal postmodernism nor a Bakhtinian intertextuality, but rather a counterstrategy that doubles modernist formalisms with discursive and figurai material from documentary texts. In order to see how this effect is woven through House Made of Dawn, it will be helpful to review the conditions for its production. The most obvious and readily available artifacts of literary modernism in the late sixties were the critical models and canonical monuments pro moted by New Critics. While it is customary to cite the relations of fragments of House Made of Dawn to modernist authors and texts, it may be useful to consider more directly how its cultural tendencies deal with modernist conventions of cultural erasure. In other words, to see how the novel problematizes modernist hermeticism, it will be useful to examine ways in which the text anticipates and problematizes a New Critical reading. Eager to engage the Indianness in the art of House Made of Dawn, critics have generally nodded to the text's modernist aspects and gone on to discuss in one way or another its Native American qualities. This approach has emphasized an authorial intention that embodies both an artistic and a cultural dimension, so that the task of criticism is to artic ulate or avoid their difference. Of the two major critical genealogies regarding Momaday's text, that which presents it in terms of its art</page><page sequence="3">Landrum 765 tends to be a kind of hybrid Romanticism which considers the author's intention, his relation to his own experience, his use of sources, his humanity in exploring the predicament and actions represented in the text. Romantic criticism does not deny culture, of course, but embod ies its authority in the imagination of the author, who in turn has been screened through the discourses of art. Thus Floyd Watkins says on the one hand, "Fiction is not anthropology" (149), but on the other, Momaday's "sources are at the very cultural heart of his novel" (153). The difference is that the "sure hand of a poet is apparent" in the text, so that "[authenticity, I believe, is generally apparent even to those who do not know a culture" (156). In this way House Made of Dawn becomes "the fullest and best representation in art of Indian culture that has yet been presented to the white man in all American history" (170). But this perspective suspends the authority of both the author and the culture in the discursive space claimed by art between autho rial intention and cultural determination. Such a critical strategy be comes an increasingly uncertain guide to the meaning of both art and culture as it moves further into textuality: it draws the text on the one hand toward the classics of the modernist canon and on the other toward a special relation to Native American experience. In this way the tendencies of the Romantic approach can be seen in the critical history of the text to move toward a different critical perspective as investigation has identified and brought to light more of the text's sources and their adaptation to cultural representations and literary effects. From Watkins's identification of locations and landmarks in the text, criticism moves toward Susan Scarberry-Garcia's detailed anno tation of Native American archival sources. The second, more recently emergent variant is that Momaday attempts, but fails, to incorporate authentic American Indian experi ence, whether or not presented as such. In fact, some essentialist crit ics view the text as participating in the dissolution of cultural integrity through its eclectic borrowings, many of which are contaminated by ethnographic presumptions.4 Momaday himself has set the work up for such critique with comments that position him in a Eurocentric per spective on the peoples represented in his work. He says, for example, "'Isak Dinesen found great nobility in some African people, and I feel that way about the Navajo.'" Momaday has said that his consciousness of Indianness is internalized in a general form ('"I thought of myself as</page><page sequence="4">766 Momada/'s Shattered Modernism an Indian rather than Kiowa'"), but it is often expressed in a more indi viduated form: '"I would be the last person to say that my opinions are anybody else's—Indian or not"' (Woodard 38—39).5 This casual por trayal of the relation of identity and ethnicity is wholly consistent with the practice of adapting ethnographic representation to literary for mulation and expresses the detachment of a modernist sensibility. The essentialist critique problematizes the Romantic approach more than the infusion of realism into its critical genealogy does. The thrust here separates cultural representation from literary figuration and associates authenticity with cultural specificity. Jana Sequoya sees the text as an example of "syncretic" kinds of literature that "mediate cross-cultural traditions for the disaffected, at the same time that they engage in metacommunication about their own existential condition" (464). Such literary practices are characteristic of "mixed-blood" authors who employ "textual necrophilia" in drawing on anthropolog ical research in lieu of lived experience (465). Sequoya argues that when such fiction "purports to represent" world views it justifies this "in the name of 'fiction'" (456). Similarly, Karl Kroeber sees realism as the essence of a novel whose flaws begin with the "simple imitative ness" of D. H. Lawrence, Conrad, and Hemingway, and include the "relentless symbolizing," "dependence on white ethnographers," and the substitution of a "sense of place" and novelistic form for the rep resentation of concrete experience and an "Indian mode of presenta tion" (18-21, passim).6 These are important issues in the criticism and appreciation of Native American literary work, especially as it is dis seminated among a broad and diverse population of readers whose knowledge of American Indian cultures is at best imperfect and specific and at worst haphazard and riven with the formal structures, stylistic expectations, and stereotypical content of mainstream American rep resentation of Indian cultures.7 When Kroeber assumes that the text's "realism" is its authenti cating mode, and when Sequoya regards the use of archival sources to be a form of necrophilia, they anticipate discourses that authenticate lived experience, while critics who place the novel in a Eurocentric critical formulation expect authenticity to be found in the adaptation of cultural experience to the traditions and formulations of art. The opposition of the views is explicit in Kroeber's observation that the "variety of interpretations" attributed to the text indicates that it is "a</page><page sequence="5">Landrum 767 novel by an Indian dramatizing the inappropriateness of the genre for the expression of his Indianness" (18), and Sequoya observes that "the category of esthetics is invoked to dismiss as impertinent any protest in the name of a politics of representation" (456).8 Where Kroeber looks for the kind of cultural indicators that specify ethnic identifica tion and finds ambiguity, Eurocentric critics looking for art find grounds for an interpretive variety that signifies the novel's richness and strength. For Eurocentric critics the text's incorporation of cultural and thematic ambiguity are artistic features, and the text's artistic fea tures are what gives it its place in imaginative literature, what stimu lates thought about the dilemmas posed by the story, and what qualifies it as an exemplar of the human condition. Those who view the novel primarily as art argue that the problem of ethnicity arises when the literary work is asked to do the work of ethnography or when it is considered as primary material for ethnographic analysis. However, modernism allows culture only within an exclusive and exclusionary tradition. Suppose the modernist elements are not lapses or hegemonic formulations but an integral part of the textuality. T. S. Eliot's "Wasteland" has been indirectly linked to the novel, and his take on culture provides a discursive thread in the novel's fabric. There are "Pagan Mysteries" throughout House Made of Dawn, as well as traces of fish, and evidence enough in the novel of debilitated heroes, vegeta tion rituals, the wasteland of the city, hollow men, broken glass, and other signifiers common to Eliot and Jessie L. Weston. That these indi cators remain little more than a trace suggests a larger counterstrategy rather than a confirmation of a modernist tradition or an evasion of experiential realism. The problem with the adaptation of cultural mate rials to the purposes of modernism's externally evolved form of art, as Eliot's use of Weston's Fisher King demonstrates, is that almost any form of cultural figure serves the purpose of an art that is responsible only to the resonances of its internal imagery. The attempt to insulate literature from mass culture and cultural realism was what made Eliot's critical discourse—and the New Criticism that followed—attractive as a specialized form of modernist practice (see Huyssen). In Eliot's view art is made and transformed, not recovered and reproduced. The cre ative writer is not producing ethnography but representation treated imaginatively, and it is the act of imagination that is important; the selection of descriptive detail should support an artistic design rather</page><page sequence="6">768 Momaday's Shattered Modernism than a representational one. An effect of this creative/critical hege mony was to discourage contextualization of literary texts and to internalize meaning as self-contained being. However attractive a situa tion this presented for the creation of an aesthetic object—an imagi nary world, a collection of linguistic tensions and ironies, an allegory of the human dilemma—it forced the author/critic into a binary choice of category: art or ethnography. In effect, New Criticism was presented in such a way that it masked the exclusion of a range of interactions. It should be obvious, for example, that this strategy effectively reduces ethnic, class, and gender difference to textual devices and explains why many modernist authors can from other perspectives be seen to be so casually sexist, white supremacist, or outright racist (see North). Weston's discussion of the widespread "Folk-lore" and Pagan analogies of tale features constitutes a kind of claim for a multicultural basis that informs the Grail story and makes it possible to assert that the story reaches its culmination and highest state in a timeless, uni versal form. But this universalized mythic structure finally signifies fea tures of "our Aryan race" and its Christian tradition (Weston 62). Two assumptions contribute to such a conclusion. The first is that the art as well as the meaning of the "Folk-lore" can be adapted to other pur poses rather than being seen as having art and thought that is self sufficient and better appreciated and understood on its own terms. Museums had already appropriated African and American Indian mate rial culture as artifacts of Western archaeological paradigms, and Weston, drawing on both the inspiration and resources of Frazer's The Golden Bough, simply followed the example of archaeologists and clas sicists. The Western conceptual shift which transformed non-Western artifacts into art for Western spectators followed around the turn of the century and helped construct the necessity for the hermetic text in which these materials could be confined to forms of metacultural fig uration. The other assumption is that the resulting textual artifact can serve as a substitute for something that has already been treated vic ariously. As Weston's Christianity "borrowed from previously existing cults certain outward signs and symbols" (Weston says the story was common to Asia and Africa), Eliot could borrow similar features from Weston (149). This kind of borrowing constitutes a purely conceptual rather than a cultural mediation—the semiotics of gesture without conviction that Eliot understood so well.</page><page sequence="7">Landrum 769 The Weston/Eliot solution to cultural difference is a formalist's field-day. The culturalist argues explicitly or implicitly, on the other hand, that the human condition is not universal in such formal ideolog ical terms, that forms of Western art circumscribe the ways it is pos sible to think about the dilemmas posed by diverse experience, that the dilemmas themselves are stripped of the specificity of their con texts through this process, and that the Eurocentric artistic features misdirect attention from real cultural/artistic difference to the self-ref erential qualities of the text itself or the fame of its author. These approaches do not exhaust the critical possibilities of House Made of Dawn, and to help see this it is useful to array discursive threads of the text's modernism and cultural representation from a different perspec tive. I will return to Eliot and Weston, but it is important to note how the text responds to other modernist elements. Momaday has been linked to the modernist literary tradition through association with his mentors and the Anglo-American literary canon. The influence of Faulkner and Hemingway, Conrad, and D. H. Lawrence have been noted, as has Momaday's study of symbolist poets.9 Ivor Winters provided a mentor whose hostility to modernism could hardly be more sharply honed but whose critique remained within a moral formalism. On the other hand, Momaday's Native American heritage—Kiowa father, his mother's Cherokee family ties, his early experience living in relation to the Jemez Pueblo—has always been closely identified with the novel (Woodard 4-6). For both author and novel, Kiowa is the culture of the bricoleur. Kiowas in the novel appropriate Tai-me (the sacred doll), horses, and a "sense of destiny" from the Crows; Abelito does not know who his father is—perhaps Navajo—and he lives among Navajos except for stints in the army, a prison, and a Los Angeles factory. Momaday appropriates a wide range of materials.10 While the story is bounded by the modernist imagery of an enclosing circularity, it also begins and ends with the Jemez words that signify the start and finish of a traditional story. The links between Christianity and Western civilization, which in modernism are ex pressed in the multitude of book and section titles made from biblical phrases, form the premise of a counterstrategy in the title of House Made of Dawn. We learn from the beginning and end of the book that "pollen and rain" link many of the rituals, such as preparing the dead,</page><page sequence="8">770 Momaday's Shattered Modernism honoring slain animals, and anointing the horse used in honor of Porcingula, Our Lady of the Angels. In typical modernist fashion, the novel sets up a large number of internal units which have only cursory signals to orient readers. We are well into the Benally narrative, for example, before we know who claims this second person voice. All the segments shift radically in time and space, even when chapters are date-stamped. But unlike Joyce's strategy of filling out formal patterns with minutiae, one of the effects of House Made of Dawn is to break them apart by problematizing their self-referential semiosis. The shifting, elusive point of view that opens the book describes the figure of Abelito enmeshed in the flat, repetitive motions and objectified landscape of the runner in the manner of Hemingway, but shifts to a view outside the center of consciousness with "Against the winter sky and the long, light landscape of the valley at dawn, he seemed almost to be standing still, very little and alone" (2). The change from an over-the-shoulder and into-the-gut consciousness to the diminished figure moves from the preoccupation with interiority and individuality to both Romantic irony and an absent social context In all of these tendencies the text seems less to incorporate culture than to deploy cultural markers. That is, the strategy appears less direct than realism and yet more contextually referential than mod ernism. It is this textual strategy—the deployment of modernist signals doubled with cultural markers—that so frustrates and inspires the novel's critics. In various readings, the albino is fish and snake, Angela is a positive and negative character, the novel achieves cultural syn thesis or condemns Western civilization, and so on. The doubling of modernist discursive moments is observable in the broad range of allu sions that contrast Native American textuality with its counterpart in modernist expression—particularly in the allusions to nature and to textuality itself. This strategy can be seen in the deployment of animal stories, Carlozini and the boarding house, and in the more serious tex tual play in Fray Nicolâs's documents and Tosamah's sermon. Consider first the form of discourses on cultural relations to nature that take on direct analogous forms in the many animal stories included in the narrative. Animal stories that help structure the dis course and figuration of Hemingway's bullfights and Faulkner's self contained Yoknapatawpha County are also a part of House Made of Dawn but function in quite different ways. The Pecos Bull Dance features</page><page sequence="9">Landrum 771 a mock bull made of a cloth-draped frame painted with white figures "like brands," a sheepskin head with a piece of wood for horns, a faded cloth tongue and button eyes (80). It is "a crude and makeshift totem of revelry and delight.... But it was a hard thing to be the bull, for there was a primitive agony to it, and it was a kind of victim, an object of ridicule and hatred" (80). The ritual test of the soul so relished by Hemingway is here rendered as a children's game, in which actors "in the parody of fear, grabbed at their gored flesh and lay strewn about in the path of the beast" (80). Kiowa, Pueblo, and Navajo story animals are finally associated with the practical life of the community. The bear hunt emphasizes community rather than isolation. Initiation is presented as a vehicle for confirming a community, for ensuring the continuation of its leadership, rather than a passage from the community of children to the ritual iso lation of adults, as in Faulkner. All participate—the women by switch ing the hide, the men by wrapping the flesh around the barrels of their rifles. Another type of story establishes a discursive counterpart to Western anthropomorphism. When Angela takes Abel to bed after establishing her cultural superiority to him, we learn that she "would like to have touched the soft muzzle of a bear, the thin black lips, the great flat head. She would have liked to cup her hand to the wet black snout, to hold for a moment the hot blowing of the bear's life" (32-33). When Abel delays consummation of intercourse she "thought again of the ... great bear, blue-black and blowing" (64). Then, when visiting Abel in the hospital after he has been beaten nearly to death, Angela reveals that she had told her son that he was "born of a bear and a maiden," but the Kiowa tale has the maiden who had slept with Bear abandon her child (187). The Kiowa grandmother tells a story at once more terrifying and less self-serving: the brother playing with the seven sisters becomes a bear and the sisters escape death by the inter vention of a great tree that carries them into the heavens to become the stars of the Big Dipper. The point of the story is, '"From that moment, and so long as the legend lives, the Kiowas have kinsmen in the night sky'" (131 ). For Angela, who "despised" Abel at the Rooster pull and pities him as he lies in the hospital (42), animals have the wist ful anthropomorphic quality of children's cartoons (see Evers). A woman already pregnant who returned after the encounter with Abel to continue life with her husband, Angela has that curious combination</page><page sequence="10">772 Momaday's Shattered Modernism of qualities that haunts modernist classics written in America—child like innocence, coldness, polish, neurotic sentimentality, and contempt for weakness. Not quite the flapper of Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Faulkner, she is nevertheless a suburban version in their manner. Sex with Abel brings her imaginatively closer to some form of cultural dif ference, but its effect is confined to her imagination. This reduction of the effects of experience to gesture occurs again with the portrayal of Old Carlozini, the woman who lives below Abel and Ben in the rooming house. In a parody of the representation of nature in art, Carlozini has an artificial flower in her hat and carries about a pet animal which she is unaware is dead, and water from the ceiling leaks on her bed. She is the archetypal modern figure—isolated, disconnected from nature, voyeuristic—who, Benally says, will "just fall down and die in the street, or they're going to find her all alone in that little room of hers" (178). The rooming house, where there is no light in the hallway and at night the stairway has to be lit by matches, has its counterpart in the ladder that runs through the canyon and valley to the plain. It is in the rooming house that Abel is at his most pathetic. Victimized by Martinez, he lies at the bottom of the stairs where the "light from [Carlozini's] room made a line across him" (184). This "line" of artificial light can be contrasted to that of the House Made of Dawn, where the sun "ranged all the days southward across the rise and fall of the long plateau .... They must know the long journey of the sun on the black mesa, how it rode in the seasons and the years, and they must live according to the sun appearing, for only then could they reckon where they were, where all things were, in time" (197). The complex signification denies a modernist rendering—actually plays on the gestures of modernist representation of nature—by contrasting the subordination of the natural with its fundamental textuality. While this doubling is replicated throughout the novel, it can per haps be seen most clearly in the material regarding religions where texts are more formalized and self-referential. In modernist novels a strategy of formal estrangement substitutes for an embodied and open-ended cultural difference; the security of a textual puzzle replaces the risks of cultural engagement. However, in House Made of Dawn the textual puzzles are centered in the texts-within-the-text and signal contextualization as well as ontology. Nicolâs's diary and letter mark the state of his soul, Olguin's meditation on it, and the texts' refer</page><page sequence="11">Landrum 773 ences to events outside their author and his texts. This internal textu ality is a miniature of the novel's genealogy itself. It is an organizing image replicated throughout the text signaling an "insurrection of sub jugated knowledges" in which moments of cultural specificity are con trasted with modernist devices (Foucault 81). The spiritual "ecstasy" that Olguin experiences while decoding Fray Nicolâs's documents is not found in his relation to local culture, from which both priests are largely isolated. It is the contextual references of the journal that are finally of interest, rather than its spiritual revelation. The albino Juan Reyes is identified in the journal, as are the source of Francisco's rebel lion, the betrayal of vows, and the incest that breeds in the heart of the text. The diary and letter, which would conceal meaning from public revelation, are the focus of Father Olguin's attention; it is only near the end of the novel when Francisco's body is dropped off that he is forced to '"understand"' events as having implications outside the soul trapped in the texts (210). The hapless representatives of Christianity both sin, while the vil lagers carry on their own traditions on the fringes of the Church. Fray Nicolas, the "old consumptive priest," "sired" Francisco (205), and Father Olguin experiences an "ecstasy" of pride when reading the docu ments—"he had been made the gift, as it were, of another man's sanc tity, and it would accommodate him very well" (53). Fray Nicolas not only fails to live up to his vows (siring several times) but also proves to be petty and malevolent. Having driven his lover mad, he fails to pre vent the incest of his children. In his letter, Fray Nicolas had called the pregnant Porcingula Pecos '"a vile one I assure you &amp; she is already swoln up with it &amp; likely diseased too'" (51). On the other hand, the villagers build a shrine to "Porcingula, Our Lady of the Angels," for which Francisco is the sacristan, having formerly been sacristan for Fray Nicolas. The statue of Porcingula, we learn early in the text, is one of the "things that should serve thereafter to signal who [the villagers] were" (16). So the shrine serves the dual role of honoring the reviled and providing an artifact to help preserve local memories, since oral traditions are "always but one generation from extinction" (97). By mak ing the wooden statue a shrine embedded in ritual, the villagers ensure the survival of a tradition subversive to Western religious hegemony. In a similar way Christian symbolism infusing John "Big Bluff" Tosamah's peyote cult contaminates rather than surpasses its truth.</page><page sequence="12">774 Momaday's Shattered Modernism Tosamah says that the Christian John should have stopped his gospel at noting the sound of the Word in the void. What has happened, rather, is the reduction of words to substitute experience through their end less reproduction: '"On every side of [people] there are words by the millions, an unending succession of pamphlets and papers, letters and books, bills and bulletins, commentaries and conversations"' (95). The concern with modern textuality is identified with Western institutions that are carried forward on a sea of paper which culminates in the sorts of bureaucracies that Abel encounters in the forms of the court, Milly's "words on paper," relocation, and the hospital (107). In contrast, Tosamah's grandmother "learned that in words and in language, and there only, she could have whole and consummate being" (94), al though she never learned to read or write. It is as if the modernization of the discourse in print trivializes it by isolating it from interpersonal communication. The "simple act of listening is crucial to the concept of language, more crucial even than reading and writing" (94). All of these references to texts double back on the Euro-Christian threads of mod ernism—and to the letter and brief excerpts of the diary. The text of House Made of Dawn, which started out as a poem or series of poems, probably owes the model for its modernism as much to T. S. Eliot (or rather, Eliot's suppressed Christianity in the "Waste land," "Hollow Men," and other early poems that await the discovery of a Grail to transform an infertile world) as to novelists. The novel repudiates the arrogance of subjugating local culture to the "one-time claim of essential kinship between Christianity and the Pagan Mysteries" that Weston says validates the Christian Grail legend (149). Francisco and Abel, having been contaminated by Western associ ation, are "wounded" by disease and alcoholism respectively, but both find truth and sustenance in local traditions. Like the Fisher King and the Knight, they quest in vain for fertility and the answer to regenera tion. After Francisco's futile mating with his sister, he settles into a sub sidiary function: he tends the shrine, hoes corn, and preserves other rituals. Like Weston's and Eliot's ideal version of the Fisher King (others were robust), he is decrepit and old. Francisco is a variant of the "very essence" of the Grail story, whose figure is "semi-divine, semi-human, standing between his people and the land" (Weston 136). Francisco is no monarch, being rather a common tiller of the field, yet he is a holy man. Abel is a veteran of the war, and like a knight he battled strange</page><page sequence="13">Landrum 775 beings in the form of the tank and the albino. Francisco tends the shrine to his lover-sister, where "the governor and his officials would sit in attendance at her feet" (77). Abel kills the albino and "would kill the white man again, if he had the chance" (102). The albino evokes traces of fish, with Abel feeling "even the scales of the lips.... The white, hairless arm shone like the underside of a fish" (82, 84). The description anticipates the image of the silver-sided fish found on the shore at the edge of Los Angeles, where Abel receives a brutal beating and regains consciousness on the beach. These fish are "among the most helpless creatures on the face of the earth," and yet they haunt Abel's imagination (89). They are "not of his world," and he associates them with Milly, the beach, the albino, and his own body when it is broken. Fish are contrasted with a section in which Tosamah associates water with Rainy Mountain (98). Tosamah's peyote cult is a variant of Weston's "Vegetation Cult" seen otherwise. Tosamah does not link the primitive to nascent Chris tianity but disrupts such colonizing uses of metaphor. Peyote, '"the vegetal representation of the sun[,]... turns you on like a light"' (109). Through his spontaneity and the response of the attendees, Tosamah introduces indeterminacy into ritual experience, so that rather than evoking timeless tradition and universality he specifies and historicizes. The Priest of the Sun lives under an office supply storage facility; his basement church, lit by two forty-watt bulbs, is not only too dark for reading but is also isolated from the spaces and light that are integral to the Sun Dance religion. Tosamah is a figure who points to both tex tual worlds. His sermons enact texts in the traditional manner, and he points to those that mislead the American hegemony. It is through Tosamah that readers are told of the historical conditions of "deicide" (133), which resulted when soldiers from Fort Sill dispersed Kiowas on 20 July 1890 and prevented them from worshipping. Weston believed that the Aryan Grail legend grew out of an account of the suppression of public "performance of an ancient ritual" (Weston 173). Here, how ever, Aryans are the suppressors. Both Nicolâs's documents and Tosamah's sermon reveal truths preserved in subjugated discourses. Darkness, as in "the race of the dead," can be a source of truth, as can the observation based on ancient knowledge of the fall of shafts of light. Unlike Christianity, which contrasts light and dark, several kinds of local knowledge support the view that light and dark supple</page><page sequence="14">776 Momaday's Shattered Modernism ment one another. Francisco shows Abel how to observe both: to see the fall of shafts of light in the canyon and to hear the race of the dead. The labeling (or mislabeling) of differences is also linked to Christian contamination of local knowledge. It is the snake that becomes central to Kiowa culture after the Kiowas descend to the plain, and it is the snake that Fray Nicolas finds intolerable. Francisco becomes '"evil"' when he "'worship[s] that Serpent which even is the One our most ancient enemy'" and so links darkness and light (51). '"Or for a fish will he for a fish hand him a serpent?'" Nicolas asks rhetorically of a son, of a father, of a rhetorical spirit (47). More than simply adapting Native American culture to modernist creative strategies, House Made of Dawn evokes typical modernist prac tices only to craze the mirroring effects of their insularity. By doubling not only on the imagery but also on familiar phrasing, the novel makes clear that appropriation of Native American culture is continuous and relentless, both culturally and textually: we hear in an echo of Faulkner that Angela "knew only how to persist" (34). The continuously shifting tone of Tosamah—"conviction, caricature, callousness: the remainder of his sermon was a going back and forth among these" (92)—signals the indeterminacy not only of the trickster but also of a modernist dis course that is itself "crazed," or shattered. It is a strategy of resistance not oriented to postcolonial practices but to Western practices of neocolonial hegemony. Because the story is encapsulated in a mod ernist form, it cannot displace Western hegemony, but it can prob lematize the hegemony and attempts to do so by invoking discourses that may ordinarily remain subjugated. Edward Said remarks that it is a paradox that "something as impersonal as a text, or a record, can nevertheless deliver an imprint or a trace of something as lively, immediate, and transitory as a 'voice'" (163). Authorial voice is usually considered one of the three or four elements necessary to cultural specificity.11 Identifying cultural differ ence in texts through a realist approach is essentially carried out through author biography, cultural decoding, and voice, but House Made of Dawn is not characterized so much by authorial voice as it is by a strategy of mutually complementary voices, often flattened to monotone. The flattening of voice contributes to the effect of irony, as modernist authors understood full well. The "irony and pity" Heming way adopted from Anatole France so pervades the novel that it is</page><page sequence="15">Landrum 777 more helpful to sort out the ways in which it is evaded than to identify it as a meaningful tone. Irony is for the most part identified with Euro pean characters and European perspectives on Native American experi ence. The irony of the text, through arguably its most distinctive textual voice, radiates from the journal and letter of Fray Nicolas, but the irony is also embedded in the similarly paradoxical characteriza tions of Old Carlozini, Father Olguin, Angela, and Milly, who are all Eurocentric soul-savers dependent, in one way or another, on Indian souls. All turn culturally inward, rather than outward. Father Olguin sins even as he understands Fray Nicolâs's soul; Carlozini refuses to believe the death of her pet; Milly "believed in tests" as her experiences of life erode away ( 107); while Angela, carrying the child of her genteel husband, dreams savage lovers and later reports telling her child fan tasies of its heritage. This experiential paradox is inverted and exter nalized regarding Indians, as the shrine to Porcingula demonstrates. When the novel fails, it does so because its resistance collapses into unproblematized modernist formulations, and when criticism of the novel fails, it is often for essentially the same reason. Although Momaday has linked the making of Abel to returning veterans after World War II, the character has the trappings of any of several of Hemingway's anti-heroes.12 He tends toward alcohol and bars, he loathes regular employment, he acts in fits and starts, he has few words, he is described largely in terms of his reactions to the condi tions of the moment, and he is more comfortable with men than women but is committed to relationships with neither. Bringing the character through a conversion experience at the end of the novel seems a weak transformation of these modernist qualities, especially since the effects of the transformation are not altogether clear. Never theless, the fragmentary doubling of Indian cultural material on mod ernist discourses and imagery tends to break down Romantic irony and problematize the conceit of mythical universality and timelessness underlying modernist consciousness. The principal problem for cultural expression in literature since the twenties had been (and still is) to subvert modernist discursive structures in order to disrupt the ontology that seals cultural diversity within the boundaries of the narrative. Henry James's entrapment of perspective in viewpoint, Joyce's use of journalistic, erotic, historicist, and other formulaic structures to package narration, Eliot's erasure of</page><page sequence="16">778 Momaday's Shattered Modernism personal voice, Hemingway's flattening of tone to irony, and Faulkner's concealment of cultural referents within mythical locations and histo ries are well-known strategies of literary modernism to which New Critical discourses responded.13 In the United States in the fifties and sixties, modernism was still experienced largely through New Critical attention to formal elements. The discourses on and in House Made of Dawn are indicative of a difficult problem. Indian art is not necessarily identical to art produced by Indians. The questions of literary representation of Native American culture have tended to gravitate to discussions of realism—of voice, setting, sources, and form—while questions of art have demanded that these features be articulated within the expressive paradigms of West ern artistic tradition in order to be understood or even respected out side their own terms. If texts still do not fit, they have been ignored or inserted into categories identified as Native American, American Indian, or simply Indian art, some of which is accessible by English language listeners or readers, and some of which is not. While "Indian ness" is a precondition of literature considered from all these perspectives, art produced by Indians may fall into either Eurocentric or local cultural patterns, with hegemonic traditions structuring or contaminating all kinds of expression. Recent criticism has begun to clarify such distinctions and to move House Made of Dawn from Indian art to art produced by an Indian. While this discursive shift would appear to be satisfactory to both Momaday and Western critics, it con ceals critical issues of Indianness and art The novel signals that it stands in relation to art but that it also reproduces culture in the sense that its structural fragmentation echoes modernist formulation but also allows for the coexistence of a collage of materials of different kinds.14 Momaday often, in effect, applies Eliot's slogan "that the past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past" (Eliot 50). He incorporates pieces of Kiowa, Navajo, and Pueblo texts but makes artistic changes here and there, compressing what began as reproduction of collective creation to the fusion wrought by the individual talent. However, this culture is not Eliot's "the whole of the literature of Europe" held in "simultaneous order" (49), but, one assumes, a distillation of ongoing local knowledges and communal experiences that were frozen in the form in which they were transcribed. Artistic reworking of the mater</page><page sequence="17">Landrum 779 ial is an additional abstraction of cultural specificity which further con founds the traditional Indianness of the representation even while stopping far short of Eliot's metatextual referencing. Within a mod ernist sensibility (consistent with art produced by an Indian or anyone else) this is not a problem, but it does complicate claims for the Indian ness of the art The objections of critics who demand respect for the purity of Indian art warrant much further discussion, but it should also be noted that experience removed from its cultural specificity through any writ ten textual practice makes authenticity elusive. In such terms, the printed text may always elude essential truths and remain a vicarious art form condemned to abstractions. As Sequoya observes, inscription may be "Indianness—a fossilized trace of numinous passage, perhaps, though certainly not the mystic critter itself" (464). But experience is also contaminated. Vine Deloria, Jr. points out that "[w]ith few excep tions, scattered in obscure parts of the reservations, the best place to get accurate information about tribal beliefs and practices today is the library or archives" (460).15 It should be obvious that Deloria's obser vation about Western hegemony does not invite external definition of the situation. In fact, Deloria suggests that observers who profit in one way or another from local experience ought to be required to reim burse the communities they research. However, it seems too much to ask of an author who thinks of himself as an Indian and whose early life was infused with Indian experience to exclude anything that might be useful to his art or thought The text may be seen as a realistic work contaminated with modernism or as one that arrays a powerful crit ique of modernist form and practice. As I have tried to suggest, however, the text includes another kind of cultural strategy as well, one which supports perspectives on Indianness which have the potential to provide coherence for the adap tation of a wide range of cultural materials. While Indianness in the novel remains largely tangled in the timeless myth of modernism, and the text makes inconsistent use of events, dates, and cultural features that lend it the quality of what Fredric Jameson has called "perforated history" (130), the tactics open the possibility of genealogies of Native American culture that respect the local politics of representation as well as the archives of transcriptions through the evocative interplay of subjugated traditions.</page><page sequence="18">780 Momaday's Shattered Modernism All literature enacts the mediation of cultural markers in one way or another, but, once matters of text are contextualized, the terms of their discussion raise unresolved and often new questions. When House Made of Dawn was written, New Critical hermeticism provided a convenient theoretical vehicle for avoiding such problems while peda gogy throughout the educational system encouraged contextualization in the guise of "situating" the text in relation to its production and his torical context. In the form of notes on the author and period, or even "events of the time," contextualization could occur in an unreflexive manner behind the back of the critical method. Once these practices began to be examined, however, widely assimilated texts incorporating cultural materials such as Momaday's became problematical. They also became problematical through the self-identification of populations whose territories are invaded by "post"-colonial "buffalo hunters and thieves" for whom identification is unproblematical because it is assumed to be a sub-set of universal humanism or art (Momaday, House 15; see also 132-33). Literary modernism's suppression of cultural dif ference effectively marginalized it as realism, defined as a limited kind of literary expression. But House Made of Dawn refuses marginalization while engaging cultural difference in relation to modernist expecta tions. It leads a rebellion of suppressed and disenfranchised knowledges —not another mythology, but a profusion of local information and mar ginalized history. The text is much more a struggle with the discourses of an episteme of contradictions than has been previously recognized. House Made of Dawn, then, can be instructive about the prob lematics of cultural difference. While it does not solve the problems of modernist literary hegemony in the production of art or its criticism, the text is more sophisticated about the problems than it has been given credit for being. Critics of House Made of Dawn have recognized the modernist signals and the Indian materials well enough but have assumed that the two were distinct, rather than discursively related. Rather than explore this relationship, critics have tended to focus on the Native American aspects of the text within a realist paradigm, tak ing Abel or the author to be the textual center of the novel and being led into a contaminated realism. The present essay has attempted to move the discussion to the problematics of the critical/artistic epis teme of modernism with which the text grapples in multiple ways. In</page><page sequence="19">Landrum 781 this sense the originality and significance of the text lies in its effort to shatter the exclusionary and oppressive practices of modernism. Critics have observed that House Made of Dawn takes the "quest for identity to a new level" (Owens 93), but the present reading would amend this to suggest that the discursive issue of the text is not what identity is but how to make room for its expression within the confines of modernist formalism. Momaday's "Indianness" is not so much a "mystic critter" or its articulation genetically bifurcated as it is a creat ing subject position that lacks not self-identity but favorable conditions for its articulation. The question for critics is not who articulates this subject position so much as it is what is at stake. Eurocentric critics do not have their cultural identities at stake, but those who identify them selves as Indians in relation to such texts do. Who has claim to the dis courses or their critique in this view becomes not so much a matter of professional qualifications, although these are not necessarily disadvan tages; nor are the questions of culture simply formal questions as mod ernist hegemony would represent them. The hegemonic modernist critical perspective risks little because it can claim that there is little at risk.16 Modernism sealed its formulations in part by trivializing popular genres and marginalizing realism: the only other modes for articulating cultural difference recognizable in modern literary production. But the matter is quite different for Indians, whose subject position is not (or not only) professional competence but cultural being. Modernism had successfully moved being out of the culture and into the text, while culturalists demand that it be returned to its rightful place within the culture, and texts have sometimes become the battlegrounds for the control of its representation. The relentless individuation of the other in the documents in House Made of Dawn and the strategies for coun tering modernist hegemony suggest that the crucial issues (and per haps a reason Momaday has had so much influence on Native American authors) involve how to articulate cultural difference within textual forms hostile to it Notes 1. Arnold Krupat argues that Silko's Ceremony ( 1977) is heavily indebted to House Made of Dawn ( 1968); her Storyteller ( 1981 ) is close to The Names</page><page sequence="20">782 Momaday's Shattered Modernism ( 1976); Momaday's autobiography, The Way to Rainy Mountain ( 1969) has influenced Native American autobiography, though Silko is "oriented toward dialogue and polyphony," while Momaday tends toward "mono logue" (82). 2. In the most positive form of this negotiation, Susan Scarberry-Garcia argues that the novel, through its representation of Pueblo stories and Navajo chantway myths can extend "life-giving values even to recently arrived non-indigenous inhabitants of the Southwest and to reader listeners elsewhere" (xvii). Despite such New Age-like claims, this is the most detailed investigation of sources available. 3. In his foreword to Susan Scarberry-Garcia's Landmarks of Healing, Andrew Wiget identifies the novel as a "modernist exemplar" in which Momaday "wove complex strands of tribal mythic reference as subtext throughout" (xiii). Other critics have noted modernist qualities but have tended to focus on the novel's Indianness. Louis Owens, for example, sees the novel as a "quest for identity," but notes that "'Dypaloh'" signals a transformative act, a subtly subversive process that runs counter to the internationalist orientation of modernism with modernism's empha sis upon a placeless iconography" (93). 4. For the controversy about this, see Kroeber, who finds the novelistic form inappropriate for the expression of Native American experience, while Elaine Jahner says, "The novel is particularly well suited to accom modating the diverse aesthetic energies that exist in traditional tribal communities. Because of its generic history" the novel can embody con trast between tribal and Eurocentric traditions (218). She uses House Made of Dawn as one of her examples. In her book-length comparison of material in the novel and archival records, Susan Scarberry-Garda argues that "the native vertebrae of the book" is its stories (3). For a review of Eurocentric views that treat the novel primarily as art, see Schubnell, chapter 4. 5. Since Momaday has produced a wide range of literature and has talked extensively about his intentions and thoughts, such comments should not be taken as his only or final words on the matter. On the freedom of the artist versus cultural responsibility, see Ramsey, especially 181-94. 6. The question of whether the representation of Indianness is bound up with the representation of locale is a complex, intensely emotional, and highly problematized one that is beyond the bounds of this effort. 7. Hochbruck identifies Momaday with Silko, Erdrich, Welch, Vizenor, and Ortiz as writers whose work is consumed by "an audience of mixed racial descent and ethnic identity" (215). Such works "consciously" rep</page><page sequence="21">Landrum 783 resent or "use Native issues and materials and ... are intended for both Native and non-Native audiences" (217) but are not necessarily "writ ten on behalf of the writers own people or about Native issues in gen eral" (215). 8. For a view hostile to this perspective see Hegeman, who examines the perspectives of several anthologists (Dell Hymes, Dennis Tedlock, An thony Mattina) in order to argue that the scholar's culture should not be a factor in selecting and evaluating Native American texts. Hegeman sees the erasure of cultural factors as "not only more intellectually hon est, but also potentially better for native American studies, than Tedlock and Hymes's more prescriptive approaches" (281). Indian perspectives that create "rules" and "standards," Hegeman cautions, "might, in fact,... have the effect of inhibiting the development of new and equally impor tant approaches to native American culture," the most important of which "would be those initiated by native Americans themselves" (281; see also 271). Not to include a "diversity of approaches to translation and evaluation" is "ethnocentric" and sometimes "even racist" (282). The rejection of Native American claims on Native American texts "would only help to invite the participation of Indians and others in both tribal and mainstream discourses about their cultures" (282). But clearly the hegemonic effects of capitalization on interest in Native American culture by critics with a plurality of "political, cultural, . . . artistic" and professional interests is precisely what culturalists resist (282). Aside from the fact that no texts are produced in creative isolation, Hegeman ignores the profession's indigenous concern with the authority of texts, evidenced in such projects as the CEAA Editions of American Authors and the privileging of hard texts. 9. See Schubneil for background and influences prior to and during the writing of House Made of Dawn. Momaday also agrees that he had Camus in mind when writing the trial scene. Most references are to modernist imagery, and I will only mention a few more. Owens notes that Angela watching Abel chopping wood is like D. H. Lawrence "at his least subtle" (106); the '"grinning, unappeased, aboriginal demons"' in the "guilty heart of Euramerica's fascination with the wilderness and the Indian" is a reference to Lawrence (107);and Father Olguin is like a "like a character from a Joseph Conrad novel" (107). Owens sees the tank as "Faulknerian" and Watkins says the bear hunt is close to those in Faulkner. Kroeber calls attention to Benally's memory of coffee as imi tative of the Hemingway style (155). 10. The status of the cultural details, many of which are considered sacred by local cultures—their availability for reproduction or representation</page><page sequence="22">784 Momaday's Shattered Modernism as community or cultural property, who can legitimately claim or make use of them—is a crucial issue, and one that this essay does not directly address. 11. But, as the history of such fraudulent texts as The Education of Little Tree suggest, voice may not be competently decoded; on this problem see also Sneja Gunew's opening remarks on Nino Culotta in her dialogue with Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. For discussion of a cultural realist appoach, see remarks on The Vendor of Sweets ( 1967) in Ashcroft, et al. (110-115), as well as Kroeber and Sequoya. What can be considered signs of authenticity vary from observer to observer. Usually these include heredity, as well as cultural experience, including language, knowledge of traditions, and intimate "lived" cultural practice. For Kroeber, only traditional Native American story forms can be consid ered authentic; both Kroeber and Sequoya discuss what they consider to be authentic story forms in contrast to the novel. 12. Momaday says that the crisis and loss that his character experiences is like that experienced by veterans dislocated from '"harmony and peace and order'" into '"chaos, World War II'" (qtd. in Schubnell 101). See Velie for a comparison of Abel with Ira Hayes, the Pima Indian who helped raise the flag on Iwo Jima in World War II, then died of exposure while drunk on his reservation after he returned. 13. Bierhorst points out that during the rise of modernism only writers such as Mary Austin in The American Rhythm (1923, rev. 1930) and Amy Lowell in Legends (1921) and Ballads for Sale (1927) tried to incorporate Indian materials. 14. Scarberry-Garda calls these fragments "storysherds," which are "brief stories from oral tradition that symbolically represent a world that is larger than themselves" (72). When informants' stories were printed in Bureau of American Ethnography reports, they survived for scholar storytellers such as Momaday, whose characters "enact" the stories (72). 15. "American Indians are rapidly losing their languages, and the oral tradi tion is fading very fast in this generation. Instead of gathering around the elders in the evening to hear stories of the tribal past, children today rent a videotape and watch Star Wars or horror films" (Deloria 460). Scarberry-Garcia bases her study of sources largely on archival material. 16. Thus, for example, Hegeman can argue that Mattina's preference for relying on a Colville translator "has no more prescriptive value than his (and his translator's) personal preferences" (281).</page><page sequence="23">Landrum 785 Works Cited Ashcroft, Bill, Gareth Griffiths, and Helen Tiffin.
