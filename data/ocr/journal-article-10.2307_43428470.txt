<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LIFE AUD WOBK OF A MECHANISTIC PHILOSO- PHES: JACQUES LOEB. (Prot. T. BraiMord Robertson, Ph.D., D.Sc. University 01 Adelaide, South Australia.) Jacques Loeb, the greatest experimental biologist of his age, pioneer in every branch of scientific endeavour which he under- took, and one of the greatest discoverers of new and uncharted realms of fact who has bestowed the fruits of his genius upon the world, was born in Alsace in 1 859, and died during his brief annual holiday in Bermuda early in 1924. In 1 71 3, in Langres, in the Province of Haute Marne, was born Denis Diderot, who was destined to become one of the intensely active group of journalists and propagandists who paved the way for that vast inversion of ideas, no less than of political forms, the French Revolution. There may seem, at first sight, to be little connection between two men living in such different ages, occupied by such divergent activities, yet it is my purpose to show that the character and ideals of the one afford the clue to the career of the other and to the impelling force which drove him and which, perhaps, by its impetus, enabled him to make such great discoveries. To understand the origin of the connection between these two men one must realise something of the circumstances of Loeb 's parentage and early life. He was of the Jewish race</page><page sequence="2">WORK OF A MECHANISTIC PHILOSOPHER 115 and descended from members of that coterie of intellectually brilliant Jews who were compelled to leave Lisbon and seek refuge in Amsterdam in the Middle Ages in consequence of the persecution of the Inquisition^ From this group sprang many of the foremost intellects of their age - Spinoza among them. Heine, to whom Loeb was distantly related, was descended from the 6ame group. With it departed from Lisbon all the intellectual glory of Portugal. From Amsterdam Loeb 's ancestors made their way along the Rhine and ulti- mately settled in Alsace. During the period of the French Revo- lution and the first half of the nineteenth century they were French subjects, passing under the dominion of Germany after the Franco-Prussian War. Loeb 's father, who was a man of business in very comfortable circumstances, was strongly imbued with French sympathies and ideals, and appears to have regarded the German overlord with genuine detestation. As a boy Loeb was never permitted to speak German to his father ; French was the language of the home, although, of course, in school German was the language in which instruction was imparted. Loeb seems to have been brought up upon the literature of the French Revolution, and the influence of this literature upon his outlook remained unabated to the end of his life. In his book The Organism as a Whole, published eight years before his death, this influence is frankly avowed in the following dedication : " The book is dedicated to that group of free- thinkers, including D'Alembert, Diderot, Holbach and Voltaire, who first dared to follow the consequences of a mechanistic science, incomplete as it then was, to the rules of human conduct, who thereby laid the foundation of that spirit of tolerance, justice and gentleness which was the hope of our civilisation until it was buried under the wave of homicidal emotion whićh has swept through the world." The central idea which emerged from all the writings of the pre-revolutionary period in France was that human nature was not originally bad, as the people were then taught to believe by their religious instructors, but originally good, in consequence of which the world they inhabit could be made a desirable abiding place, provided only man used his intellect to remove from his path those obstacles and stumbling-blocks responsible for his most painful experiences ; the evil in the world, they believed, was attributable to faulty education, lack of intelligence and bad institutions, among which they reckoned the then-existing forms of government and dogmas of religion. The most vigorous and popular exponent of these ideas through the medium of the great Encyclopaedia , and his many other writings, was Diderot, and to Diderot's influence is mainly</page><page sequence="3">1 16 SCIENCE PROGRESS to be traced, perhaps, the immense popularity which these ideas achieved. It was not Diderot, however, but Holbach, a somewhat younger man, who crystallised these ideas into one coherent system of mechanistic philosophy and gave clear form to the political and ethical aspirations which arose out .of them. The modern world has lost that supreme confidence in the nature of man which the Encyclopaedists avowed, very largely on account of the growth of evolutionary literature and the evolutionary method of thought. As John Morley has put it : " Like all others of his school, Holbach has no per- ception nor sense of the necessity of an explanation how the mental world came to be what it is, nor how men came to think and believe what they do think and believe. He gives them what he deems unanswerable reasons for changing their con- victions, but never dreams of asking men in what elements of human character the older convictions had their root, and from what foundations for the conduct of life they drew the current of their sap." We may state the objection, which perhaps most modern men may feel, in the following words : If human nature is essentially excellent, how does it arise that our institutions are evil, as it is stated they are, and that our education is bad, as it is stated to be ? Somewhere in the collective mass of human instincts there must be instincts which lead historically to bad results, just as there are instincts which lead historically to good results. If, then, all institutions could be remoulded " nearer to our heart's desire," the natural operation of these human motives would in course of time produce institutions both good and bad, and the society living under them would experience its own difficulties and shortcomings, individuals would be thwarted then as now, personalities would be deformed by the operation of bad institutions then as now, and once more we would perceive that " heaven's gift takes earth's abatement." It was perhaps some reluctant recognition of this fact which underlay the slight tone of acerbity in which Loeb always referred in conversation to evolutionary literature. Not that he disbelieved in organic evolution. No sane biologist dis- believes in it. But in his writings he rather pointedly ignored it. Moreover, he always distrusted speculations founded upon the evolutionary theory on the ground that such hypotheses are not accessible to esperimental verification. The affinity of Loeb to Diderot extended further than the capture by the one of the intellectual sympathies of the other. There was a truly extraordinary similarity between the outlooks and characters of the two men. Many of the accounts by eye-witnesses of the personality of Denis Diderot</page><page sequence="4">WORK OF A MECHANISTIC PHILOSOPHER 117 irresistibly remind those who knew him of the personality of Jacques Loeb. The extraordinary rapidity and profundity of his thought, piercing obscurity like a ray of lightning, seems to have been in a great measure also a characteristic of Diderot. Marmontel, who knew Diderot, has written of him in words which might be applied almost without change to Loeb. Above all, when he says that " he who only knows Diderot in his writings does not know him at all," for indeed all who knew him realise that Loeb has left but an imperfect picture of himself in his writings. His gift of literary expression, although not inconsiderable, was far inferior to his gift of speech - instant, rapid, and voluble speech, with its extraordinary clarity and sagacity, and the unexpected angles from which he could throw new light upon old subjects. Then again, only those who were privileged to be associated with him in his laboratory could possibly realise Loeb 's gifts of critical penetration and his power of extracting the very core of the matter , from the many problems presented to him. Once more, what Marmontel has to tell us of Diderot may be said of Loeb : " Never was Diderot seen to such advantage as when an author consulted him about a work. You should have seen him take hold of the subject, pierce to the bottom of it and at a single glance discover of what riches and of what beauty it was susceptible." On the other hand, in his writings, the influence of Holbach upon Loeb is perhaps even more clearly perceptible than that of Diderot. On the professional side Holbach indeed approached Loeb more closely than Diderot. For Holbach attempted deliberately to apply such science as then existed to the solu- tion of human problems, and above all to the central problem of man's relation to the universe. Diderot was more discursive, more purely literary, appropriating such scientific scraps as chanced to float into his view, and since Loeb 's own activities were expended upon scientific endeavour, when it came to the actual account of his work and its bearing upon human motive, we find Loeb adapting the conceptions of Holbach to the con- ditions of modern life and enriching them with modern scientific knowledge. Many passages in Loeb 's Comparative Physiology of the Brain and in his Mechanistic Conception of Life remind us irresistibly of passages in Holbach 's Sy stema Naturae. When we recall the fact that the System of Nature terrified Voltaire and shocked Rousseau, it will not occasion surprise that the conceptions advanced by Loeb were in no respect conventional and that they terrified and shocked not a few of our own generation. When we perceive a man of intellect devoting a life-time of the most strenuous and unresting endeavour to many and most varied works, we may, rightly or wrongly, suspect that under-</page><page sequence="5">1 1 8 SCIENCE PROGRESS lying his diligence and unsparing expenditure of self there is some unifying and impelling motive and that the ends which he is immediately attaining are not regarded by him as ends in themselves, but as means towards some other end, some general objective towards which he is aiming. Loeb had a general objective, and the clue to it is to be found in the literature of the Encyclopaedists. All would be well in this world, they held, if it were not for faults of education and environment created by false beliefs, mistaken prejudices, and the domination of ignorant and selfish despots. What is that, we may imagine young Loeb asking himself, which holds the masses most clearly under subjection? What is that which chains them to un- wearying labour, the fruits of which others will reap ? What is it that makes them bear their lot without complaining and fetters them to the task to which they were born ? His answer was, Religious dogma and superstition, recognition of a higher will which holds out to them an illusory hope of a better world in the hereafter, and their consequent fear to assert their own individuality. The next stage in the development of the point of view would be to inquire how these dogmas came to be believed. Through ignorance, naturally, and chiefly through our ignorance of the forces which move the world, and above all of those forces which move ourselves and which carry on the marvellous and miraculous-seeming processes of life. It is in a solution of the problems of life, therefore, that we must seek for en- lightenment. We must strip away its mystery and show that living beings, no less than inanimate bodies, are machines impelled by physical and mechanical forces. This, we may imagine, was the starting-point of Loeb's career ; and to these views and these objectives he held unvaryingly throughout his life. Loeb took his degree of M.D. at Strasbourg in 1884, and the character of the then Professor of Physiology was admirably conceived to strengthen the attitude of mind in which Loeb was to approach the subject. Fick was the last of a great school of physical physiologists, of whom Helmholtz and Du Bois Reymond were the most illustrious examples. They were physiologists who were so thoroughly physicists that one hardly knows in which branch of science their contributions were most noteworthy. Fick himself is, in fact, remembered rather for his studies on Diffusion in Liquids than for his numerous most excellent researches in physiology. This was the Pro- fessor under whom Loeb studied the subject that was to become his life-work. For a brief time Loeb contemplated entering medical practice, but the routine of professional life speedily wearied him, and the lure of his wider objective beckoned him</page><page sequence="6">WORK OF A MECHANISTIC PHILOSOPHER 119 irresistibly to research. Fortunately his father had left him with sufficient means to indulge his inclinations without necessitating endurance of the excessive hardships which have attended so many in this career. It was at this period that Professor Goltz at Wurzburg was engaged in his classical researches upon the functions of the higher parts of the brain, the cerebral hemispheres, and he had just performed the startling experiment of removing the cerebral hemisphere altogether from an animal and had shown that it was possible for such an animal to carry on its physio- logical activities, to walk, eat and bear young, and since, if anywhere, the mental activities of man might be presumed to be dependent upon these portions of the brain, this experi- ment rendered evident the fact that a great proportion of our daily activities do not necessarily involve mentality, but are in reality automatic. Here seemed an opening into the ancient unsolved problem of the relationship of mind to matter, and here, if anywhere, prejudice, superstition and dogma felt safely entrenched in the unknowable. This seemed to afford an opportunity for that dispersion of obscurity for which Loeb longed, and he naturally proceeded to Wurzburg, where he studied under Goltz and conducted research on brain physiology. From 1886 to 1888 he acted as assistant to Goltz. By 1888, however, he had realised, probably, the limitations of these new experiments and the very fragmentary and insufficient character of the information which they revealed to us. Im- portant though every fragment of information may be, yet Goltz 's method of attacking so intricate and subtle a problem represented merely a beginning, the preliminary step towards much more elaborate analyses of the phenomena. In 1888 Loeb returned to Fick at Strasbourg as his assistant, and he spent the summers of 1889 to 1891 at the Zoological Station at Naples, with results which have permanently enriched biology. One of those living phenomena about which mysticism most loves to linger is that development whereby an orderly growth of form and function evolves out of the simple undifferentiated jelly-like mass of protoplasm which constitutes an egg-cell. If this process could be shown to be guided by physical and chemical forces a severe blow would have been struck at the roots of the obscurantism which it was Loeb 's main object to destroy. In the course of his experiments at Naples he showed for the first time that the development of the organs and structures of animals is, in fact, directed by physical and chemical forces. He showed that if the animal be placed under exceptional conditions involving a change of the usual physical and chemical factors, development becomes abnormal</page><page sequence="7">I20 SCIENCE PROGRESS in a direction determined by the new factors. In many of the simpler forms of life which inhabit the ocean there is a clear differentiation of function and structure between an anterior end in which is situated the mouth, provided with suitable appendages for facilitating the entry of food, and a posterior end which is frequently fixed to some solid object on the floor of the ocean. In these forms mutilation results in the regeneration or regrowth of the missing parts. If the posterior end be cut off, a new foot, or posterior extremity, is regenerated. If the anterior end provided with mouth and tentacles be cut off, a new mouth and tentacles are regenerated. It was first shown by Loeb that if these animals be simply inverted after injury, placed upside down, that is, and kept in that position, that end which is uppermost produces the mouth and tentacles, that end which is lowest produces the foot or means of attachment to solid objects. Always the lower surface developed means of attachment, the upper surface the tentacular organs and orifice for the insertion of food. And such developments were shown to be totally irre- spective of their utility to the animal, since by suitable incisions slanting upwards or downwards it was frequently possible to produce more than one, or even several, mouths, all but one of which were useless to the animal ; or, conversely, it was possible to produce several organs for attachment to rocks, only one of which could possibly be of use. He showed that the polarity of many of these organisms is due to gravity, to the sinking of certain substances in their tissues to the lower levels, which substances prevent the growth of head appendages and facilitate the growth of foot appendages. So that by altering the ordinary direction of action of gravity it was possible to produce these organs in unnatural situations. This was the phenomenon which he designated Heteromorphosis, and many remarkable examples have since been discovered by many other workers besides Loeb himself. The most extraordinary is perhaps the discovery of Herbst that if, in certain Crustaceans, the eye be removed, instead of regenerating a new eye the animal regene- rates in its place a new antenna, so that it has now three antennae instead of two, and one eye. There is no utility in this, and consequently we cannot refer it to design, even if we were to suppose that the animal could control its own development. It is due to forces, not all of which are yet understood, but which we know to be of a physical and chemical character, and which the researches of Loeb have done much to unravel. During these years at Naples Loeb discovered, however, a series of phenomena which were destined perhaps, in the immediate future, to prove even more important and even more</page><page sequence="8">WORK OF A MECHANISTIC PHILOSOPHER 121 effective towards the promotion of his general objective than those which I have just outlined. It had always been a matter of common knowledge that many flowers, and most seedlings, turn towards the light, bend, that is, in the direction from which light is proceeding. It was also a matter of common knowledge that some animals, such as moths and other insects, are at- tracted by light. Until 1890 nobody suspected any relation between these phenomena in animals and plants. The bending of plants towards light was commonly assumed to be of a mechanical character, since nobody had yet seriously proposed to endow plants with intelligence. The seeking of light by animals, however, even by insects, was commonly interpreted to mean that these animals possessed consciousness, and were gratifying a sense akin to curiosity. Almost all actions of animals until that date were interpreted in an anthropomorphic way, that is, in other words, human feelings, human consciousness, human recollection, and so forth, were supposed by the observer to be possessed by all animals in differing degree, and the actions of animals were interpreted in terms of their supposed sensations and their supposed desires inspiring voluntary effort. There was a large literature, culminating in the well- known work of Sir John Lubbock, which employed, completely to its own satisfaction, this simple method of accounting for every feature of the behaviour of animals which the physiology of that day did not yet suffice to explain. A great change was to come. We now study the behaviour of animals chiefly from the outside. We assume nothing. We ask what they do with a curiosity which increases rather than abates, but if we venture to say why they do it we no longer appeal to their emotions, their thoughts, their desires. We know nothing of these things. There is, in fact, no way in which thought, or desire, or feeling can be conveyed to us by creatures who have no knowledge of our conventional symbols for the conveyance of thought. Hardly, even, can two different races of men thoroughly comprehend each other's thoughts or feelings, and, in fact, the thoughts and feelings of any other individual are merely inferred, we have no immediate knowledge of them ; but of the behaviour of men and animals we have immediate knowledge, it requires for us no interpreter but our senses. This change of attitude of mind we owe to Loeb. As Brett has said in his work on The History of Psychology, " The kindly observers who from i860 to 1890 entertained a large public with curious narratives were rudely silenced by the reports which Jacques Loeb published in the last year of that epoch. From this work arose a new type of comparative psychology, the Mechanistic Scliool,"</page><page sequence="9">123 SCIENCE PROGRESS The attraction of animals towards light was shown to depend upon precisely the same factors that govern the bending of plants towards light. The difference was simply this - that whereas plants are fixed by their roots to the soil, animals are usually free to move. The plant bends because the tension of its protoplasm is greatest on the illuminated side. The animal flies, walks, or runs towards the light, because the tension of its muscles is greatest on the illuminated side, and the wing muscles, or leg muscLs, therefore contract through a greater sweep on the unilluminated side and turn the animal mechanically towards the source of illumination. Many years of Loeb's life were devoted to the elaboration of this thesis. It was shown that both animals and plants exhibit many kinds of tropism besides heliotropism, or movement directed by light. Towards certain chemicals, animals, and some plant-cells, may exhibit chemotropism or attraction to, or repulsion from, the source from which the chemical is diffusing. Towards gravity many organisms show geotropism, swimming or crawling, or growing always upwards, away, that is, from the centre of the earth. Nor are these tropisms confined to usual or customary stimuli such as those to which the animal has become adapted in its environment. They are exhibited towards forces totally outside the normal experience of animals, for example, towards electrical forces, and in every instance the mechanism of attraction to or repulsion from the source of the stimulus is the same, namely, inequality of the tension of the muscles on the two sides of the body. It was in these years that Loeb met the lady who became his wife, Miss Anne Leonard, who was then engaged in study at the University of Berne. Loeb was an enthusiastic moun- taineer, and it was during one of his trips to Switzerland for the purpose of indulging this hobby that he met Miss Leonard. His wife was an American, and this, together with his hatred of the military spirit which dominated his own country, doubt- less turned his thoughts towards the New World. In 1891 he accepted the position of Associate in Biology at Bryn Mawr College for Girls. He occupied this position for one year, and then was appointed Assistant Professor of Physiology and Experimental Biology in the University of Chicago, being promoted to Associate Professor in 1895, and full Professor in 1900. In 1903 he left Chicago to accept the newly created professorship of Physiology in the University of California, where I joined him as Assistant two years later. During the first ten years of his sojourn in America Loeb directed his energies mainly towards the application to biology of the newer knowledge of physical chemistry which had been given to the world by the labours of Ostwald, Nernst, van 't Hoff and</page><page sequence="10">WORK OF A MECHANISTIC PHILOSOPHER 123 Arrhenius. A number of important facts were discovered of a somewhat technical nature, hardly lending themselves to brief description of a general character. Many of the things that interest us most in physiology at the present day, however, were first discovered or indicated in Loeb's laboratory during this decade. About 1900 Professor Loeb's former colleague at Bryn Mawr, Prof. T. H. Morgan, noticed a curious phenomenon among the egg-cells of a sea-urchin with which he was working. The sea-urchin normally reproduces by the simple method of discharging its unfertilised eggs into the sea, where by chance they may meet with a sperm similarly discharged into the sea by the male. When this union takes place the egg develops a clear transparent membrane around it which prevents the entry of any more sperm, and then proceeds to divide and undergo development, until, after a long time, the mature form is again produced. Now, Morgan observed that a very small number among a large mass of sea-urchin eggs would occasion- ally, if the sea-water had evaporated slightly, develop mem- branes just as if they had been fertilised, and might even undergo one or two divisions. He showed this to Loeb, who immediately grasped the potentialities of such an observation and its immense value towards the furtherance of his general objective. The process of fertilisation which initiates the development of animals and plants was surely the most mys- terious thing in the world. If he could strip the mystery from this and show that it was possible to imitate fertilisation by some physical or chemical agent, a deadly blow would have been delivered at that sort of mysticism which revels in our ignorance of natural phenomena. For several years he devoted himself to this problem, until at length he had succeeded in interpreting the accidental observations which Morgan had made, and in so improving upon the original chance experi- ment as to be able to produce at will a 100 per cent, of fertilised eggs from eggs which had never been fertilised by sperm. To-day the artificial fertilisation of these eggs is no more difficult than the development of a photographic film. From sea-urchins he proceeded to other forms, and artificial par- thenogenesis, or fertilisation without the agency of the male element, has now been accomplished, thanks to Loeb's researches, in a great variety of species of animals. The highest form in which artificial fertilisation has yet proved possible is the frog, but many embryo frogs have been pro- duced, and not a few have been reared to maturity without the agency of any male element. These researches afford a remarkable example of the fact that fundamental discoveries need not always be of an expensive kind. The laboratory</page><page sequence="11">124 SCIENCE PROGRESS in which Loeb discovered the majority of these facts was a simple shed erected upon the sea-coast of California at Pacific Grove, close to the old Spanish capital of California, Monterey. The equipment required was of the simplest and least expensive character, and the results are among the most valuable in biology. In 1 9 io Loeb left California to accept the position of Director of a department especially created for him at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York. His work upon marine forms of life was continued on the Atlantic Coast at that remarkable collection of marine laboratories which forms the greater part of the little town of Woods Hole in Massa- chusetts. The fourteen years during which Loeb was associated with the Rockefeller Institute were devoted to the refinement and elaboration of all his previous work. Experiments, which were formerly qualitative and inexact, were here rendered quantitative and exact, and his work upon tropisms especially was greatly extended. The phenomena of fertilisation, through the aid of the artificial method which he had discovered, were largely interpreted, and, thanks to his researches and those of others who followed in his lead, we now possess some exact knowledge of the essential nature of the chemical changes which the spermatozoon induces in the egg and which initiate its development. I have said that the personality of Jacques Loeb was imperfectly displayed in his writings. His point of view towards our social institutions is clearly and vividly expressed over and over again at every point at which his results bore, in his imagination, some application to human affairs and con- duct. But the impression created by his writings is not a true one of the man himself. Above all they fail to reveal to the reader the candour and simplicity and openness to convic- tion which must always stand out, in the minds of those who knew him well, as his leading characteristics. An amusing instance of his candour and simplicity I have often heard Loeb tell himself, not only in my presence, but in the presence of many others, so that I am revealing no confidence in repeating it. When Loeb accepted his first American appointment at Bryn Mawr he was assigned the duty of in- structing students in embryology, a subject in which he had not previously taken any exceptional interest. After one of his lectures a student approached him with a question. His answer was highly characteristic. " My dear young lady, I cannot answer your question, because I have not yet read that chapter of the textbook myself, but if you will come to me to-morrow, I shall then have read it, and I may be able to answer you." This was the man who was destined in a few</page><page sequence="12">WORK OF A MECHANISTIC PHILOSOPHER 125 years to become the leading experimental embryologist of his generation 1 His openness to conviction is far from apparent in many of his writings, nevertheless it was very real. He no more hesitated to reconsider his opinions than he did to avow his ignorance when he felt it. He always expressed himself with vigour and pushed home an argument in vivid language to its logical conclusion without any restraint. Nevertheless, if replied to in the same vein he would duly weigh the argument, and if it appeared to him to defeat his own, would instantly admit the fact without any reserve whatever. The opening sentence of his recantation was invariably "You are right," the second, " I was wrong." Those who were unaccustomed to the vigour and vividness of his speech would often, not unnaturally, consider him dogmatic ; but did they press their views with the same enthusiasm, singleness of purpose, and intellectual insight as Loeb himself, they would shortly recon- sider their first estimate. Loeb was not a scholar in the ordinary acceptance of that term ; indeed great investigators are very rarely scholars. Great capacity for assimilating the results of others is rarely associated with great capacity for the attainment of new results hitherto undiscovered. Loeb 's mentality was kinetic rather than assimilative ; the mere accumulation of knowledge for its own sake did not appeal to him. Nevertheless, he was a very widely read man in many branches of science, and par- ticularly in physics. In fact, although his social ideals and aspirations were, as we have seen, largely French in origin, as a scientific man he owed more to the inspiration of English workers than to those of any other nation. He very greatly admired the English school of physicists, and he regretted that their methods and outlook had not yet influenced biology to the extent that he considered desirable. He was not only well read in scientific literature, but also much better read in philosophical literature than his writings indicate. I well recollect an occasion when I was complaining to him of some events with which I was very discontented, and he replied, " You have read Spinoza. Do you not remember," and then quoted the whole of the opening paragraphs of Spinoza's Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding, paragraphs which breathe an almost Sophoclean calm and indifference to ordinary human joys and woes. I hasten to add that Loeb did not himself obey his own injunctions. His attitude of mind was far removed from that philosophic indifference which Spinoza sought to cultivate. In general literature, at the time I knew him, he did not appear to me to possess any especial favourites, but one who</page><page sequence="13">126 SCIENCE PROGRESS knew him in the later years of his life has stated that his favourite author was Anatole France. Considering his own attitude towards social and religious dogmas, one could well imagine that the satirical treatment of these subjects by this modern Lucian would strongly appeal to him, more especially since his own humour was frequently cast in the ßatiric mould. He did not share that love for administrative work for its own sake which the majority of Americans possess in such high degree, nor did he relish attendance upon the perennial committee-meetings in which the academic soul delights. He was an uncomfortable member of a committee, because he always insisted upon dragging fundamental principles into the discussion. There is nothing which so shocks your good committee-man as a naked first principle. He hastens to clothe it in a garment of compromise, no matter how patched and threadbare the improvised covering may be. Promptly Loeb tore it off again, once more revealing the principle in all its utter truth and simplicity, a proceeding which did not invariably tend towards the production of harmony. As a teacher Loeb was inspiring, as a lecturer at once brilliant and easy to understand. As a teacher he was best appreciated by those who approached the subject from the single-minded point of view of interest in science for its own sake. To these his inspiration was valuable beyond measure. By others who approached the subject as a duty, or as a means to some end which they esteemed useful, he was necessarily regarded as unpractical. This was particularly true of medical students, who found his lectures singularly disconcerting. He lectured on no fixed plan but dealt with current problems of paramount importance in a marvellously illuminating manner, always seeking for fundamentals and underlying principles, approaching a subject with a view to analysing it as a physicist or a chemist would analyse it, without any reference to its immediate utility for the purposes of professional life. The average medical student approaches his lectures from the point of view of a would-be artisan rather than that of a would- be scientific man, seeking recipes and methods rather than general underlying principles and a scientific comprehension of the phenomena as a whole. There is always this conflict between the point of view of the scientific man and that of the narrowly practical man. To the purely scientific type of man it seems obvious that application will flow naturally out of complete and comprehensive knowledge and may therefore be • left, in the main, to the initiative of the informed individual. It is for this reason that when one ceases merely to seek utility one most surely finds it. But to the so-called practical man</page><page sequence="14">WORK OF A MECHANISTIC PHILOSOPHER 127 applications are all-important, and comprehension is merely an intellectual hobby. So the medical students who desired to learn a recipe for the treatment of measles and the way to perform a tracheotomy were forced to listen to a brilliant and fascinating exposition on the general principles underlying the permeability of living cells to chemical agents ; or on the oxidations proceeding in the nucleus ; or on the fundamental laws underlying and governing the regeneration of lost parts in the lower marine animals, or in plants. It is, in fact, as Loeb foresaw it would be, out of these fundamental considera- tions that the new medical science is growing at the present time, and possibly some of the students who felt impatient twenty years ago at being forced to study such things, would esteem it a privilege to hear those lectures again to-day. I have sought to show that Loeb possessed that intellectual generosity which enabled him to admit the justice of the arguments of another even when they contravened his own. Not only in these, but in more material respects, he was generous also, and many among his students owed their ability to con- tinue their chosen career to his kindly and timely help, of a very practical kind, always so unobtrusively exercised that the greater part of it remained unknown. As an experimenter Loeb was unresting, tireless. Those who, in the decade from 1900 to 19 10, read the vast outpouring of results from his laboratories could not believe that so much could have been discovered by a single man in so limited a space of time, or that so many experiments could have been conducted with adequate care to ensure their accuracy. As a former member of his staff for five years, I can testify that Loeb was meticulously careful to avoid even the appearance of appropriating the results of any other man, particularly of members of his own department. He never even allotted us tasks for the alleviation of his own heavy labours. On the other hand, any suspicions that may once have been felt concerning the essential accuracy of his results (whatever may be thought of his interpretation of them) have long since been dispelled and made to appear ridiculous by the mere natural growth of those regions of scientific knowledge in which he laboured and in which he was, at that time, so frequently a lonely pioneer. The secret of his productivity as an investigator lay in his immense industry, and in the extraordinary sagacity with which he designed his experiments to elicit an unequivocal answer to the questions which he had in mind. To him his work was a first and paramount interest, and it was therefore at once a labour and a relaxation. His holidays were brief and infrequent. His working hours comprised the greater part of his waking</page><page sequence="15">128 SCIENCE PROGRESS life. Gifted with a strong physique, he rarely exhibited any sign of the immense strain which other men might have felt, had they performed half his labour. His experiments were multitudinous, and great as was his published output of experi- mental results, they represent but an inconsiderable fraction of the experiments which he actually performed. He never tired of repeating well-established experimental results, to assure himself once more of their validity, and that nothing of possible significance had been overlooked. And now what shall we say of his main theses, culminating in the view that man is an automaton, moved wholly by physical and chemical forces ? In his writings he does not seriously grapple with the problem of the relationship between mind or consciousness and matter. The writer of the obituary notice which appeared in Nature in April 1924 was evidently one who knew him well, and, as he says, Loeb waved aside all objections to his mechanistic view which were based upon the existence of consciousness " with a smiling epiphenomenalism which was impervious to argument." By epiphenomenalism we mean the simple statement of the obvious fact that con- sciousness and material changes in our body proceed parallel to one another, consciousness reflecting accurately in its own world that which happens in thè material world. The illustra- tion employed by Huxley, although very imperfect from a logical point of view, may convey some idea of the attitude of mind of the epiphenomenalist. He says that consciousness accompanies bodily events as the shadow of the wheel accom- panies the wheel. The defect of the illustration is this - that there is, in fact, a physical connection between the shadow and the wheel, the physical connection of light, whereas the epiphenomenalist assumes, in such connection, merely the parallelism. He makes no assumptions. His point of view is agnostic. He states a fact and leaves the matter there. So far as his writings go Loeb certainly may be classed as an epiphenomenalist. But undoubtedly he thought much more about this great central problem than he chose to express in his writings. He would probably have said that it was no busi- ness of his, as a scientific imvestigator, to throw frail bridges of hypothesis over abysses of ignorance. As for his doctrine that men and animals are machines, our attitude towards this will depend upon what we mean by a machine. As he con- ceived a machine, probably there are many who would disagree with him. But it may be questioned whether a machine is, in fact, anything at all other than something that we under- stand, understand fully in its origin, in the way it happens and in its effects.

They are pervaded by necessity and volition disappears, but it is possible that this impression arises merely from the relativity of human intelligence. Whatever we may individually think of the ultimate con- clusions which he drew from his investigations, there can be but one opinion of Loeb's immense serviceability as an in- vestigator. With his departure from our midst an immense intellectual force has been taken from the world and his disci- ples and those who disagree with him alike are permanently impoverished by its loss. 9</page></plain_text>
