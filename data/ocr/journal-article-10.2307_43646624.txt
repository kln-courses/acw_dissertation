<plain_text><page sequence="1">PINDAR'S 'THEBAN' COSMOGONY (THE FIRST HYMN) * ALEX HARDIE I: Introduction Pindar's first hymn presented a lyric cosmogony in a Theban context. It embraced the creation of the universe, the marriages of Zeus and the birth of the gods, as well as the foundation of Thebes itself;1 and its fragmentary remains, although amounting to under fifty lines (perhaps a quarter, or less, of the original), suggest that it was a poem of especial grandeur, a literary-religious statement of high significance, most particularly for its Theban audience. It was chosen to open the first book of the Alexandrian edition of Pindar. Bruno Snell' s justly admired essay 'Pindars Hymnus auf Zeus' remains, more than fifty years after it appeared, the standard account of the fragments.2 Of course, we now know more about Pindar's methods of work and about his sources of inspiration than was the case in 1946, and this alone would justify a fresh look at a work which stood so prominently at the head of the Pindaric canon. Another reason for attempting a new assessment lies in our enhanced understanding of Greek cosmology and its impact on other areas of Greek intellectual and religious life. Recent insights into the interplay of cosmology with mysticism and poetry have brought a new dimension to the reading of literary texts in this area;3 and in the case of the first hymn, they may help illuminate the ways in which Pindar's account of the origins of the gods relates to the theogony of his fellow Boiotian, Hesiod.4 In what follows, therefore, I shall offer some new suggestions as to the religious and intellectual currents of thought which influenced Pindar and helped shape his hymn. I shall focus first and foremost on the ways in which the cosmic order established by Zeus came to be manifested on earth.

Race [Loeb], adapted). Ismenus and Melia together allude to Apollo Ismenios and to his íepòç ycxjuoç with Melia on the site of his Theban oracular centre, the Ismenion.5 The Apolline opening foreshadows the extensive role which the god plays in the hymn, and probably has a bearing on the hymn's performance-location (below, VII). The remaining catalogue-items are enclosed by Cadmus and by Harmonia' s wedding to Cadmus, being thus separated off from Ismenus and Melia yet at the same time returning to the yájLioç implicit in their joint naming. Cadmus and the Spartoi ('sown men') together allude to the foundation of Thebes (confirmed by Thebe, the city's eponymous nymph), in obedience to the instructions of another Apolline oracular centre, Delphi.6 The three central items are elegantly grouped fļ láv ... fļ tó ...fļ Táv, within which are paired two Theban sons of Zeus, Heracles and Dionysus, syntactically parallel (attribute plus genitive of name) but conceptually contrasted ('all daring strength' and 'joyful worship') in ways which allude to their respective benefactions to mankind (clearing the world of monsters, and introducing wine). Dionysus is not named again in surviving fragments, but Heracles reappears in a conflict which seems to have exemplified his gûbvoç (fr. 33a). The final item supplies Pindar with his point of departure; and it represents Cadmus' establishment of a family dynasty in newly founded Thebes, parallel in that respect to Zeus' marriages following the cosmogony. This is not a random assemblage of myths, but an artful induction into Theban prehistory, in which allusive associations lead from one name to the next. There are also programmatic clues to the théogonie material which is to come. One clue lies in a probable echo of Hesiod in the joint naming of Heracles and Dionysus, in each case alluding to birth at Thebes.7 Another is suggested by ZrcapTCOV íepbv yevoç àvôpœv (fr. 29.2, 'the sacred race of the sown men'): the Spartoi are a variant of a widespread motif, the 'origins of a people' (other examples typically involve derivation of particular nations from the blood of Uranus, the Giants or the Titans); and this motif itself derives from more general anthropogonic myths.8 I would suggest that the end-line juxtaposition of yévoç àvSpcov with 'Melia' alludes to the myth that mankind originated from ash trees (ļieAiai), the tree nymphs born from Earth in parallel to the 'spear carrying Giants'.9 Pindar is here suggesting a kind of 'Theban anthropogony'. A comparable association of the Theban Melia with the earthborn tree nymphs appears in Callimachus' hymn to Delos.10 5 Ismenion: Schachter 1981, 77-85. 6 Spartoi and the foundation of Thebes: cf. esp.

Crítias will speak after Timaeus, 'having, as it were, received the men who have come into being in his logos' , and he will 'make them [Athenian] citizens'. Plato thereby sets the (pre-)history of Athens within a cosmic context, suggesting that Athens is the favoured product of a universal generative process, and that the Athenian citizenry came into being at the same time as mankind (ie. an 'Athenian anthropogony'). Such 'universal history' plays on city-state loyalties, suggesting that civic ideals mirror the principles on which the cosmos itself is founded.12 A later Theban illustration of these ideas appears in Nonnus' account of the foundation of the city {Dionys. 5.49-87), where it is stated that in laying out the city, Cadmus imitated the cosmos itself. Nonnus can be assumed to have found the analogue between Cadmus' foundation of Thebes and Zeus' establishment of the cosmos in some classical source.13 Pindar went on to use Thebes and Thebans as exemplars of universal themes to do with mankind. We know this from Aelius Aristides, who reports that Pindar, 'going through the experiences and vicissitudes befalling men in the entire passage of time, says that Cadmus heard Apollo giving a display of correct music'.14 Cadmus was an ancient exemplar of personal vicissitude who:15 (a) lost his sister Europa [variant: was then exiled from Tyre] and on enquiry at Delphi received the foundation oracle for Thebes; (b) located the site, but killed the dragon of Ares (the action leading to the creation of the Spartoi ), and spent a 'great year' in servitude to the god; (c) married Ares' daughter, Harmonia, at a ceremony attended by the gods;16 (d) was later exiled again (compare [a]), in punishment for Theban treatment of Dionysus, metamorphosed into a dragon (compare [b]) and placed at the head of a barbarian invasion of Greece which was halted and reversed at Delphi (compare [a]);17 (e) with Ares' help, was translated to a blessed afterlife in Elysium with Harmonia.18 The awkward fact was that Thebes and the Thebans owed their origins to acts of blood guilt, to the slaying of the dragon, and the fraternal strife of the Spartov, the first resonated throughout Cadmus' life, in the alternating extremes of felicity and misery; and the second resonated through the troubled internal history of Thebes itself.19 That Pindar told some of the Cadmean saga seems probable; but how he addressed the collective guilt of Thebes and the Thebans, if he did so at all, cannot be known. Théogonie poetry did, however, offer precedents for the handling of the collective guilt of mankind. Obbink (1997) relates such théogonie themes to observed social patterns in which mythography might be deployed 'to explain and thereby overcome... forms of crisis including blood-guilt from the killing of kin'; and he suggests that Orphic 11 The tradition is traced, with reference to the Aeneid, by P. R. Hardie 1986, 66-84 (noting the Timaeus)', 343-46. 12 P. R. Hardie 1986, 71. Dio Chrys. Or. 36 supplies a further extended example. 13 City as microcosm: P. R. Hardie 1986, 75; 227; 384.

Earlier, Seaford (1986) had suggested, with reference to the Prometheus Vinctus , that ancient linkages, based on the revelatory secrets of mystery cults, existed between the cosmological elements, the Titans' ancient wrong in dismembering Dionysus, their eventual release, and the promise to initiates of a blessed existence in the afterlife. Now, Cadmus would be a plausible Theban focus for the mystery concepts identified by Seaford and Obbink (and, as will be seen, the release of the Titans featured in the first hymn); moreover, the wedding of Cadmus and Harmonia itself had strong mystic associations (below, V). The Cadmus myth had no connection with the Titans' murder of Dionysus, but Euripides' handling of the Cadmus myth in the Phoenissae suggests that it offered some scope for figurative connection with the Titanomachia and its aftermath, most particularly in the fact that the Spartoi , like the Giants, were born, like a monstrous crop, from Ge (the Earth);20 and the read-across from this 'chthonic crop' to the agricultural basis of the Eleusinian mysteries is readily available, from this same play and elsewhere.21 Again, at least part of the Cadmus myth is understood to have featured in a Titanomachia ascribed to Mousaios (probably belonging to his Theogony, which was itself closely aligned with the cultic interests of the Eleusinian mysteries).22 In short, although no reconstruction of what he actually wrote is possible, Pindar could have been working within well-defined mystic-mythological traditions involving variant, but interrelated, treatments of the birth of mankind, its association with Giants and Titans, and also the warlike nature of Spartoi and 'ash-born men'.23 Aristides' term for Cadmus' vicissitudes, jLieiaßoXri, occurs at Pyth. 4.292, with reference to 'changes of fortune'. Aristides couples it with 7ta$TļļLiaTa. The two terms, or cognates, are regularly associated in testimonia on Presocratic cosmology.24 Cyclical change (juexaßoAri) with the passage of time, and its divisions (the seasons), was central to Presocratic thinking.25 It represented the determinant role of time in patterns of cosmic growth and decline, elemental supremacy and subordination. I know of no early context where this cyclical cosmic doctrine is explicitly extended to the varying experiences of men or of an individual mortal.26 But mortal existence and man's varying fortunes are compared to a kúkXoç by Herodotus (1.207.2);27 Xenophanes applies the cosmic analogy to the cyclical destruction of mankind (A33[6] DK); and cities too were subject to 20 Eur. Phoen. 638-89, esp. 667, 670, 673, 674, 681, 686, 689. This rich ode links Cadmus' arrival in Boiotian territory, and its fertility; the later birth of Dionysus; the slaying of the dragon, the planting of the teeth, the growth of the Spartoi and their slaughter; and an appeal to Io' s son Epaphos, linked to Persephone and Demeter.

Choricius of Gaza gives an extended summary of the scene:29 'Pindar represented even the gods as reluctant to hymn the acts of munificence performed by Zeus for the benefit of men; for it seemed. . .to the poet that the highest praise of Zeus lay in the fact that none of the Olympians dared praise him; and so in Pindar, Zeus sat enthroned, having recently created order in the universe (to nãv apxi KOO|LU1Gaç), and the gods were in his presence, struck dumb with astonishment at the wonder of what they saw; and when Zeus asked whether they were lacking anything, the gods said that his works of creation lacked one thing only, that he had brought forth nobody who might aspire to the measure of his accomplishments in expressions of praise.' Choricius' 'works of creation' (8īļļiio')pyrļļLiaai) suggest a Zeus akin to the cosmic artificer (ôruaiODpyóç) of Plato's Timaeus. Pindar may have used some word suggesting 'maker', 'craftsman' or 'architect', but he cannot have used ôr||Liio')pyóç itself.30 When his Zeus asked the gods whether they were 'lacking anything',31 he is articulating the standard wish of the universal craftsman to create a perfect cosmos from which nothing should be missing.32 Hesiod had emphasized Zeus' forceful role in overthrowing Kronos ( Theog . 73-74), but Pindar's Zeus acquired supremacy by lot. Aelius Aristides, in the peroration of his prose hymn to Zeus, cites him thus:33 ...ccòxòç av jlióvoç eírccov a %piļ 7C8pi amov, ůzoq axe kXéov xi A,a%cbv- xowo yáp oív nivõápco koKXiov fļ aM,' óxiotiv óxcpow eïprixai 7i£pi Aióç ('he alone speaking about himself in the right way, "as a god with something greater as his share"; this utterance of Pindar was finer than absolutely anything else which has been said about Zeus').

Zeus Soter was a common cult title, so that Pindar's epithet might connect with Zeus as helper of man, and as his protector in the hazards of human life.36 Certainly, Pindar's supreme deity is essentially benevolent towards mankind.37 Citing fr. 30, Clement identifies his beneficent rule with the dispensation of justice (8íkt|) (Strom. 5.14.137.1): nívôapoç Sè avxiKpuç Kai acoTTļpa Aia GDVOiKOwxa GqmSi eloáyEi, ßaai^sa, aorfļpa ôíxaiov... ('and Pindar openly introduces saviour Zeus co-habiting with Themis: a king, a just saviour'). This is one of a series of Clement's citations from classical Greek texts illustrating the benevolence of the supreme deity, and the proposition that he is not responsible for ills befalling mankind. Choricius too suggests a more general benevolence in 'acts of munificence performed for the benefit of men' (xáç toó) Aiòç elç àvûpomoDÇ (pitamjLiíaç). This Zeus begins to look like a fifth century precursor of the supreme being who, in his rcpóvoia, cared for man, his own creation.38 A further point is that Clement read Pindar's representation of Zeus as that of a (cosmic) 'king', and focuses his benevolence on one of the primary virtues of the 'good king', justice.39 Something of the poet's conception of the cosmos and its organising principles may be inferred from the epithets of Zeus' first children, by Themis, the Horai (that is, the Hesiodic Dike, Eirene, Eunômia):40 %pi)cyájLi7iDKaç ('with golden diadem') suggests anthropomorphic personification;41 ày^aoicápTtODÇ ('bringers of splendid fruits') signifies the growth of crops associated with the physical passage of the annual seasons;42 and àXaúéaq ('true') takes us into the metaphysical territory represented by Dike and her 34 For equal division and order versus violence, Theogn. 677-78 (men's actions in a sea storm), cf. esp.

Choricius is addressing a ruler (Justinian) and the Zeus/king analogy may reflect what he had read in Pindar. For the 'good king' and justice, see the bibliography cited by F. Cairns, Virgil's Augustan epic (Cambridge, 1989) 19. The king/Zeus analogy is implicit in the Homeric concept of the king 'nurtured by Zeus'; but explicit articulation is found first in Hesiod: Theog. 71 ; Erg. 111. 40 Theog. 902, with West; Pindar adopts the names at Ol. 13.6-8. 41 Theocritus and others later used the epithet for the same purpose: see Id. 17.67, with Gow. 42 See West's note on Hes.

The Horai remained central to the orderly functioning of the cosmos and to the principle of circularity within it;44 they ensured that it operated in accordance with natural laws of justice and good order; and they are fundamental to the Siicr| of Zeus.45 The justice of Zeus resided in the regular working of his cosmos, and it is in that sense that, when Pindar addressed him as àpiaxóxe%va Tcáxep (fr. 57.2), he was later understood to have delineated him as ôr|jLLio')pybç £Ùvo|niaç Kai 8íkt|ç ('artificer of good order and justice').46 In the first hymn, Zeus seems to have embodied the cosmic order and justice which on earth finds expression in the cyclical vicissitudes of the human condition. The differentiation between the genealogical world view and the abstract conception of a world governed by 8íkt| and by causal laws seems now to have been less sharply defined than was once supposed.47 Milesian theory may have represented not so much a break with Hesiod, and sources known to him, as a dialogue in which personalisation and depersonalisation of cosmic forces played central roles.48 Against this background, I would suggest that Pindar has blended traditional genealogy with fifth century cosmological concepts; and that in doing so he may have been influenced by the central Milesian contribution to cosmogony, the application to the natural world of kóg|HOÇ, that is, 'order' (in Kahn' s admirable summation, 'an organized system, characterized by symmetry of parts, periodicity of events, and equilibrium between conflicting factors').49 When Themis ascends to Zeus, she is led 'from the streams of Oceanus to a holy ladder, by the shining way [i.e. the Milky Way: see below] of Olympus'.50 It is not quite clear whether the journey stages are set out sequentially (i.e. Oceanus, ladder, shining way) or whether the shining way leads to the ladder; but either way, there is implicit contrast between the straight vertical axis of the ladder and the circularity both of Oceanus and the Milky Way. Pindar is offering a spatial picture which involves both straight lines and circles.51 The ladder has strong parallels in the Orphic mysteries as a means by which the initiate, too, might ascend to heaven after death;52 and the Milky Way featured prominently in Pythagorean astronomy, where it was commonly said (as in 43 R.

Chronos (Time) as 'master, surpassing all the blessed gods' (ava(KTa) toy TuávTCúv mepßaMxma Xpóvov ļiaicapcov, fr. 33) might owe something to the Orphic demiurgic figure.54 Anaximander, however, had given chronos (time) a central role in the dynamics of the cosmos, to do with periodic cosmic cycles, thereby establishing the twin dimensions of space and time within the Milesian contribution to cosmology.55 Such concepts might well have fed into the Orphic stream of consciousness, but they seem to have been independent of it in origin. IV : Apollo and Delos Two fragments (33c and 33d) describe how Delos, which formerly wandered unfixed over the ocean, buffeted by winds, was fixed by rising pillars to the sea floor at the moment when Leto gave birth to Apollo and Artemis. Snell suggested on metrical grounds that the fragments belong to the first hymn.56 Pindar speaks of Delos as 'the unmoveable wonder, which men call Delos and the blessed gods on Olympus call the far shining star of the blue earth'.57 He probably alludes in acrcpov ('star') to an alternative name for Delos, Asteria.58 He also shows the sea and island from the gods' perspective. The closest parallel for this inversion of land and heaven known to me comes from mystery initiation: in Plutarch's de Genio Socratis , Timarchus' experience at the Oracle of Trophonius includes a vision of the cosmos (590c-f) in which the sky and the stars are likened to ocean and islands; and Plutarch's vision, like Pindar's, vividly highlights colour.59 Pindar's description of 'earth as seen by gods' imparts knowledge normally concealed from men and suggests some analogy with mystery revelations which vouchsafed a vision of earth as seen from heaven.60 Pindar makes Delos an example in microcosm of the creative processes for which Zeus has been responsible in the universe. As a floating island, Delos may contain a reflection 53 Milky way: Cook 1925, 37, with earlier bibliography. Pythagorean: ibid, 40-45; Burkert 1972, 321-22, 367-68. Pythagoreans and 'way': Arist.

Some mountains are described as 'columns'.74 Related mythical-cosmological speculation is reflected in the picture of Atlas at Odyssey 1.52-54 'who knows the deeps of the entire sea, and himself holds long columns which hold earth and heaven all round'.75 Cosmic pillars appear in Hesiod ( Theog . 779), reaching from Tartarus to the heavens, and also in Ibycus (fr. 336 PMGF): "IpDicoç ôe èrìi xœv xbv oùpavòv ßoeaxa^ovTeov kióvcov, et&gt;|H£7E$8iç ^eycov ('Ibycus [sc. used the word 'slender'] of the pillars which support heaven, in the sense 'of great size'); and they are suggested in the 'straight poles' (ópůooTáxai) with which Euripides' Ion erects his 'cosmic tent' at Delphi (Ion 11 34). 76 The pillar concept was primitive and widespread.77 There existed 'four-pillared' cosmic models in early Near East, Egyptian and Sardinian cults.78 Indeed the entire Greek concept of the cosmos as a building, where the heavens represent the roof, supported by pillars arising from the floor, may derive from Egypt.79 In a long series of invocations in the preface to the (late) Orphic Hymns, the poet juxtaposes the 'winds and thunders and parts of the four-pillared cosmos'.80 These mystical lines combine forces of stability (the pillars) with those of disruption, and suggest some 'Orphic' correlation between the two.81 It is a reasonable inference that the correlation derives from an Orphic cosmogony; and Pindar might have found it in some such source.82 The four pillars also turn up, guarded by the 'seven fates of heaven', in the 'Mithras Liturgy'.83 That the cosmic stability of the pillars found its way into classical mystic symbolism is suggested by Euripides' exploitation of the motif in Dionysus' victory over 70 Circularity of the Milky Way: Arist.

Pindar has therefore used a Delian motif, its fixity following the birth of Apollo, to symbolise the grand concept of cosmic stability.85 The symbolic association of pillars with unchanging stability is reflected in a different way in the constraint of the Titans. Hesiod states that when Zeus immobilised the Titans, Atlas and Prometheus, he combined 'bonds' and 'pillar' ( Theog . 521-22): 8f|ae 8' ècÀ,UKT07té8r|ot npojiTļ^ea 7toiKiA.0ßouA,ov, / Seajioîç ápyaA¿oiai, ļneoov Sia kíov' éÀxxaaccç ('he bound wily Prometheus with unbreakable fetters, with harsh bonds, driving a pillar through the middle'). West's conjecture that Hesiod has in mind another pillar of heaven may be confirmed by a mid-sixth century vase painting, depicting Atlas supporting a starry oúpocvóç, facing Prometheus bound to a pillar.86 It is relevant to these ideas that Pindar described the release of the Titans in the first hymn (fr. 35): Keivcov àuùevteç caîç vkò %epaív, avai; ('[sc. the Titans] released from those [bonds] by your hands, lord').87 Delos' fixture was triggered by the arrival of Leto, herself KoioyEvriç (fr. 33d.3), daughter of the Titan Coeus, and I would conjecture that a direct sequence of events led from Zeus' victory in the Titanomachia, and the confinement of the Titans, through reconciliation and the merciful release of the Titans (fr. 35) symbolised in Zeus' marriage to Leto, daughter of Coeus, to her arrival on Delos. Simultaneously with that arrival (ónó t'... 8t1 tote; fr. 33d.3-5), the island is fixed, and given stability, by pillars with 'adamantine bases', material which is elsewhere associated with constraining bonds and pillars, and it here signals the new, constructive, use to which the older powers of compulsion have been put.88 Herein lies the genealogical reason for the choice of Delos as terrestrial microcosm for the process of cosmic construction. In Callimachus' hymn to Delos, we find a comparable cosmic contrast between the island's chaotic wanderings and its fixture after Apollo's birth, between the pre- Apolline rule of brute force and compulsion and the advent of song at his birth, and more generally between chaos and orderly circularity. Harmony triumphs over force and fear;89 '...the birth of music on Delos in the person of Apollo transforms and orders the world.

Two word-echoes point in this direction:92 the four Delian pillars were optìoci (fr. 33d.5), as is Apolline music (ļio-ooimv óptìav ¿TtiSeiicvoiLievo-o, fr. 32); and at fr. 35c, voļucov òcKO-oovTeç úeóôjuoruov KetaxSov ('hearing the god-built noise of the nomes') echoes the address to Delos (fr. 33c. 1, %o&amp;p ' œ ťteoSjuáxoc...), and will have invited the audience to ponder the conceptual interconnection of the island, its four pillars, and music.93 V : The Mysteries Two motifs from mystery religion were advanced earlier as parallels for words and concepts in the first hymn: the 'ladder' to heaven; and the cosmic inversion of ocean and islands, heaven and stars. A further possible feature which the poem shares with the language of mystic symbolism is the Delian pillars, and the motif of cosmic stability. To these may be added the release of the Titans, already alluded to in discussion of Cadmus and Thebes, for there is good evidence that 'imprisonment', 'enslavement', 'shackles' and 'release' played a significant part in mystery cult;94 and there is testimony to the Dionysiac equation of the cessation of hardship with release from shackles.95 Now, it has been shown by Richard Seaford that in the Dionysiac mysteries, the release of the Titans from their shackles functioned as a mythical paradigm for the salvation of their mortal descendants, men.96 Seaford has also shown, with specific reference to Aeschylus' portrayal of Prometheus in the Prometheia , that this conception of the Titans represents a fundamental revision of the Hesiodic account, in which the Titans are left permanently enchained and which thus, by extension, leaves mankind in a permanent state of suffering without hope of salvation.97 A further component of Seaford' s argument has to do with the cosmic elements, and their place in the mysteries, and this too finds parallel material in the first hymn (above, IV, especially n. 69). That Pindar should espouse the version whereby Zeus is reconciled to the Titans carries obvious significance for the divergence of the first hymn from the Theogony. It might be argued that this has nothing to do with mystery cult (Pindar mentions the release of the Titans at the end of the fourth Pythian [291] without any obvious mystic connotations); but recent advances in our understanding of the ways in which the ancient mysteries are alluded to in literature have helped to show that where we do find such central mystery motifs embedded in texts, a careful search for other cult allusions may be justified and necessary.98 Pindar himself refers to mystery beliefs in the second 90 Bing 1988, 110-28. 91 Bing 1988,99-103. 92 Word-echoes in Pindar: A.

In a recent paper, Richard Garner has shown that the sixth Olympian is susceptible of interpretation in similar terms.100 The first hymn has not previously been approached in this way, but its cosmological subject matter would certainly lend itself to the literary promulgation of mystery ideas. This section will accordingly register those verbal and conceptual elements of the first hymn which contain certain or possible allusions to the mysteries. The Greek mysteries held out the promise of personal salvation (acorripia).101 A late source cites an incantation linking the salvation of the god in one mystery cult with that of the individual initiand.102 A Christian writer speaks of popular belief that the sacred marriage enacted at Eleusis represented 'salvation'.103 We find explicit reference to mystery acorripia in the fifth century at Arist. Rhet. 1419a3-4, where Pericles cross- examines Lampón rcepi rfjç T£^exfļ&lt;; Tobv Tfjç ocoxeípaç iepœv. The idea is further reflected in derivative literary texts;104 and it is arguable that in two passages in Aeschylus and Aristophanes, cult references to (respectively) Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira are combined with allusions to mystery salvation.105 The first hymn, too, presents Zeus as 'saviour' (ccûTT1poç ... Aióç, fr. 30.5). This function connects with the god's general beneficence towards mankind (above, III); but Pindar juxtaposes it with the sacred ladder, whereby the souls of initiates ascended to heaven after death, and he may thereby be alluding to Zeus' role in the 'salvation' of men. Later, in an intriguing parallel which also connects salvation and post mortem ascent, Lycophron juxtaposes the 'ladder to the course of the stars' which the exploits of the Dioscuri raises up for them, and an address to 'saviour Zeus'.106 At the heart of most mystery cults stood a 'sacred marriage'.107 The union of Cadmus and Harmonia was one such marriage, which was itself celebrated in the mysteries of Samothrace;108 and, again like other mystery cults, Samothracian ritual prominently featured music and dance, reflected in aetiological myths associating the Muses themselves with the wedding. All this was appropriate to the figure of Harmonia, associated as she was with musical harmony and with the harmony of the cosmos. Moreover, the Muses, through the music which was performed at the mysteries, were themselves an essential element in the initiands' process of learning about the cosmos;109 and harmony itself seems to have carried revelatory force as a key to understanding the inner workings of the cosmos.110 Wilamowitz rightly saw Pindar's Harmonia-Cadmus marriage as bringing apļLiovia and kóc|lioç to earth, and also as a parallel event to Zeus' 99 Lloyd-Jones 1985. 100 R.

The Apolline elements in the first hymn might at first sight appear to carry no possible mystery allusion, since Apollo was not the subject of mystery cult. Lucian's story of Alexander the false prophet enacting mysteries in which there featured 'the parturition of Leto, the birth of Apollo, his marriage to Coronis and the birth of Asclepius' (Alex. 38) may suggest something about the style of dramatic tableaux in later telestic initiation, but nothing like this can have been available to fifth century initiands. Yet when Pindar says that Leto 'set eyes upon her blessed offspring' (et)8ai|Liov ' È7CÓ'1/axo ysvvocv, fr. 33d. 10), he is certainly recalling the initiands' £7C07tTeia, the culminating point of the mysteries, which in some cults involved the witnessing of the birth of a child.112 These mystic resonances are reinforced in e-ūSaiļiov,' a reference to the blessed status associated with the initiate, here transferred from the ènónx^c, (Leto) to the object of her vision, Apollo.113 Pindar thus assimilates the birth of Apollo to the experience of mystic initiation and revelation. His reasons for doing this will be assessed below (VII). VI: The Muses and Movgiki) The subject matter of the first hymn, the origins of the universe, of the gods and mankind, raises an epistemological issue: how does the poet know that of which he speaks? For to early ways of thinking the mind of Zeus was inscrutable, as was his treatment of humble mortals.114 The underlying question, with its differentiation between human and divine knowledge, was posed in different ways in different intellectual environments.115 For the poet, the answer might readily involve his patron goddesses, the Muses, as canonically invoked by Hesiod at the start of the Theogony. The philosophers, by contrast, challenged the ability of the poets adequately to praise celestial regions which they could not behold and the truth of which could not be known, except by the mind;116 and they helped create ways in which the inscrutable might be made intelligible, and in which Zeus' just and beneficial rule might be apprehended.117 Pindar uses Delos as a visible microcosm to demonstrate (i.e. make 8fļA,ov) the nature of the macrocosm.118 This revelatory wisdom is brought to Thebes by Apollo and the Muses, together with (or within) the ļHODOiKTļ which was the Muses' sacred province and which reflects the cosmic apjuovia of their father, Zeus. Pindar depicted Cadmus listening to Apollo 'giving a show of correct music' (iliodoikcxv òptììxv £7tiSetKvuļi£VOV, fr. 32), evidently speaking of a display performance of the central theogony, and suggesting that Pindar placed that performance in the mouths of the Muses themselves.119 111 Wilamowitz 1922, 191. 112 For mystic é7C07CT£Ía and its exploitation in literature, Seaford 1994a, 277-79.

It further suggests that the Correct music' contained within itself some revelatory truth about the cosmos from which it has come, and which it seeks to describe. As to the sense of ôptfáv, Plutarch evidently took Pindar to be making a polemical point, rejecting music which was 'designed for pleasure; luxurious or sinuous in its melodies' (with play between óptìcxv ['straight'] and ¿7ciKEKÄxxc|U£vr|v ['sinuous']).121 If Plutarch is right, Pindar may have intended a technical reference to the incompatibility of sinuous music (and melodic KoqiTcai ['twists']) and harmony.122 Something close to Pindar's sense of opťkxv may be found in Hippocrates' application of concepts of cosmic harmony to the well-being of the human body, where he speaks of beneficial change of environment as involving 'correct attunement, which has three harmonic proportionals...' (trans. Jones).123 I would surmise that Pindar too is alluding,, in a technical way, to harmony and its revelation through the Muses to Cadmus.124 We do not know how Apollo and the Muses were introduced as speakers, or for what proportion of the hymn they remained as such.125 It may be significant for their role in our poem that in his Hymn to Delos (see above, IV), Callimachus refers to the earthborn tree-nymph Melia, in the company of the personified Ismenus and Thebe (77, 80, 88; cf. fr. 29, 1; 3), and addresses a question about her nature, to the (Heliconian) Muses. Two testimonia illuminate their conceptual role. According to Aelius Aristides, 'Pindar states that at the wedding of Zeus, when Zeus asked the gods if anything was lacking, they requested that certain gods be created for himself, to adorn these great deeds, and that entire work of construction, with speeches and music.'126 The second passage, from Choricius of Gaza, was cited earlier (II) and tells a similar tale. The two accounts clearly refer to the same passage in the first hymn and to a unique Pindaric account of the origins of the Muses.127 Philo of Alexandria preserves a strikingly similar account in the de Plantatione Noe. The immediate context is Philo' s proposition that thanksgiving is best rendered to God not by temples, sacrifice and material gifts, but by praise and hymns. Philo cites an 'old 120 For ¿7ci5eÍKVüjii of shows of the mysteries, cf. Lys. 6.51. H. W. Parke and D. E. W.

Antipater of Sidon ( AP 7.34) appears to say that Pindar imitated the Muses in what they sang at Cadmus' wedding. This refers not to Pyth. 3.88-91, but to Pindar's 're-presentation' of the Muses' song in the first hymn. With Pindar's 'Pierian trumpet' juxtaposed with his melos and the Muses' song, cf. Nonnus' description of the wedding, juxtaposing Ares' trumpet, Apollo Ismenius' lyre and the Muses' melos {Dionys. 5.96; 100-3).

And he replied that all things through all parts were perfect and full, but that he sought one thing only, speech in praise of these things, which should not in fact praise, but rather herald, the surpassing excellences which resided in all things, including those which seemed most insignificant and inconspicuous. For the exegesis of the works of god represented quite sufficient praise of those things, which had no need of extraneous addition to adorn them, but possessed in the authenticity of truth their most perfect encomium. The father of all listened, and praised what had been said; and without delay there appeared the all-musical and hymnic offspring, from one of the powers around him, the virgin Mneme, whom the majority, altering the name, call Mnemosyne.'128 To the best of my knowledge, this text has not previously been connected with the first hymn. Yet Pindar and Philo both have to do with the work of a cosmic artificer/craftsman, his concern that nothing should be lacking, his consultation with others, the response that the work of creation requires praise, or at least explanatory treatment, in words/music, and the creation of the Muses to fulfil that role. The area of overlap is extensive, and evidently significant (though Zeus' t)7cocpfļTai have no obvious Pindaric analogue). 129 7taÀ,ociòç ... ocSexai Xóyoq ('an old account is sung...') suggests a poem/song in which the myth had been narrated, and direct borrowing from the first hymn should not be excluded.130 But it is more likely that Philo had before him some Hellenistic intermediary. Cumont argued that the myth was Pythagorean in origin, and (less plausibly) that Philo might have drawn on a version of a Pythagorean poem on number which he found in Posidonius.131 For present purposes, the main question is whether Pythagorean influence might be projected back to the fifth century, and to Pindar's presentation of the myth in the context of the wedding of Harmonia. Pythagoreanism was closely identified with the cult of the Muses;132 and the association of the Muses with harmony goes to the heart of Pythagorean interests in music, number and proportion, the background to which lies in traditional views of the Muses as the divine projection of music itself.133 The connection of Muses and harmony is attested for the fifth century by 128 1 27-29 : rcataxiòç yovv õtôexai Xòyoç, vnò (lèv oo&lt;1)(ûv eúpeúeíç ... è'Gxi ôe xoiÓGÔe- fļvim, cpaaí, xòv GÚ|I7iaVT(X KÓOJIOV Ó 7T0lT|Xr|Ç £T£A£G(pÓpT|G£V, £VOÇ XCÖV t)7C0(pT|XCÖV ¿IZVŮSTO, El XI 7tOlM ļlTļ ^EVOJIEVOV XCÖV ögoc mxa yf|ç Kai Kad' vôaxoç f' boa mxa xrļv jiexápoiov àepoç fļ xrjv éo%áxr|v xo'&gt; rcavxòç cpÚGiv ot&gt;pavo') 7¿tov£v. ó ôe àrceKpívaxo xeXeia fiev mi TcX,rļpr| návxa Ôiá mvxcov eivai, êv Ôe jióvov Çrjxetv, xòv ¿7caivexrļv aùxcov taVyov, ôç xàç év moi mi xotç ppaxuxáxoiç mi àípaveGxáxoiç Ôokoûgiv ')7teppoÀ,aç oùk ¿7iaivéoei ļiāAAov fļ ë^ayyeÀet- xaç Tap ôiirynoeiç x&amp;v xox&gt; ůeox&gt; êpTCOV aúxapKeoxaxov ¿Keívcov êrcaivov eivai, 7tpOGi3T1icr|ç o-òôejiiâç è^coûev eiç kógjiov Ôeojiévcov, àXXa xb à'j/et)ôèç xfiç áX,r|úeíaç xeÀ£ióxaxov ¿XÓvxcov éyK(û|iiov. àKo-óoavxa Ôè xòv 7caxépa xov mvxòç xò A^^úèv ¿7caivéoai, mi oòk eiç ļia^pav xò 7rámioi)ôov mi i5|iv(pÔòv àvacpavfjvai yévoq ¿k jiiâç ÔT1 xcov 7cepi aijxòv ÔDvájieíov mp-ôévot) Mvnjiriç, 1ļv Mvrļļj.oG'uvriv Tcapaxpéîiovxeç oí koXXoi xo"uvo|ia m&gt;x)"0oiv. 129 Boyancé 1946, 7, identified the interlocutor as Apollo; contrast Cumont 1919, 81. mocpTļxai are first found in Homer (II. 16.235) as oracular attendants of Zeus at Dodona: Fascher 1927, 27-32.

The divine Muses defined the relationship between the celestial music and harmony and their counterparts in daily 'musical' life on earth.135 This musical linkage of heaven and earth, and the extension to mankind of celestial harmonia proved a durable concept;136 but an early antecedent may be seen in the Pythagorean idea of terrestrial music as a jiiļiriļLia of heavenly music (Iambi. V.P. 64-66, where Pythagoras is said to hear the cosmic music directly, and to imitate it by strings and the human voice).137 In bringing music to earth for the first time, and thereby completing the demiurgic work of the supreme god, Pindar's Muses are, I would suggest, the product of this same body of Pythagorean ideas. VII: A Civic Context? The Pierian Muses had to do with Olympian Zeus.138 Kern saw this as a cultic expression of poetry which celebrated 'Zeus and his victory over the gods of the early world'.139 We might compare the i)7TO(pfļTai of Dodonian Zeus who, by the Hellenistic age, were thought of as learned expounders of the god's cult history.140 The linkage with Zeus remained constant, finding its strongest extant expression in Hesiod's Theogony. It is this tradition which is represented in Pindar's first hymn; and it would certainly be fair to describe the Muses' song at Cadmus' wedding as a 'hymn to Zeus'. Indeed it may be that Philo' s í)7CO(pfÍTai (whoever they were) in some way reflect the intermediary role of the Muses as divine expounders of the will of Zeus. But whether the work as a whole is a hymn to Zeus seems to me much less certain. Rather, what we have seems to be a hymn to Zeus within a poem which was itself classified as a 'hymn'. The Muses developed associations with other gods, notably Apollo and Dionysus, both of whom are found in the role of Musagetes ('leader of the Muses'). But the early connection with Zeus persisted; and Pindar elsewhere shows sensitivity to the fact that the Muses may serve both Zeus and Apollo. In the sixth paean he balances the Muses' 'panhellenic' role within Zeus' universal governance with their local role in the service of Apollo at Delphi.141 In the first hymn, the Muses are created to praise Zeus and his cosmos, but they act under the guidance of Apollo Musagetes. Apollo was clearly prominent in the first hymn, directing the revelation to mankind of the nature of Zeus' creation. Unsurprisingly, scholars have focused on the possibility of some wider Apolline context. Maurice Bowra speculated on performance on Delos, and Jane Harrison 134 Cf. also Epinomis 991b.

Pythians 1 1 summons the daughters of Cadmus and Harmonia to come to the Ismenion, 'shrine of golden tripods' and to praise Themis (Apollo's predecessor as presiding deity of the oracle) and Delphi (might we connect Themis' prominence at Pythians 11.9 with her promotion to being Zeus' first wife in the first hymn [fr. 30.1]?). 143 The Ismenion was also the performance location for the first and ninth paeans (fr. 52k.38-43), for a tripodophoricon (fr. 66) and perhaps for two fragments which have been identified as daphnephorica (94b; 94c).144 When Apollonius Rhodius compares the Argonauts rowing (in time to Orpheus' lyre) to choric dancers honouring Apollo, he names three Apolline dance sites, Delphi, Delos and 'by the waters of Ismenos' (1.536-37). The first two are standard components of such Apolline lists; but the Ismenion was not (it is omitted from the list at 308-9), and it arguably carries some specific allusion. Now, forty lines earlier, another reference to Orpheus' lyre introduces his cosmogony (494-511). Is Apollonius thinking of Pindar's cosmogony at the Ismenion, and might the latter supply the elusive link between these two Orpheus passages? Harrison identified the first hymn as a daphnephoricon and took its occasion to be the festival of the Daphnephoria , performed at the temple every eight years.145 For this precise context, there is no obvious textual evidence. But another festival which seems to have taken place at the Ismenion was a Tripodophoria ceremony, connected with the dedication of tripods.146 Pindar appears to have written a tripodophoricon for such a festival (fr. 66). Now, there is no reference to tripods in the surviving fragments of the first hymn; but an indirect link with tripods can, perhaps, be established. According to a variant version of the legend of the seven wise men, a tripod was passed from one to the next until it was dedicated to Apollo Ismenios.147 The Ismenion version must have been connected with the dedication of tripods (indeed, it could have been an aetion for it), and will have been one facet of the temple's strong identification with Delphi.148 Against this background, I would suggest that a reference to the seven wise men in fr. 35b (oocpoi 8è Kai to 1ir|ôèv ayocv enoq aīvTļaav 7t£piOGG)ç: 'the wise men have bestowed high praise on the saying "nothing to excess'") may have a Theban context: if this line was indeed uttered in the Ismenion, a Theban audience would surely have connected it with 'their' ao(ļ)oi-tripod. 149 Another fragment of evidence suggests that the tripods were dedicated by certain 0r|ßaYEvetq (Theban-born'), in a ceremony linked with the early establishment of a Boiotian confederacy, controlled by Thebes and meeting on the Cadmeia (Pindar himself seems to have mentioned the Gr^ocyEveîç in this context in an Ismenian tripodophoricon 142 C.

Tripod dedication by the Gripayeveîç might help explain this uncertainty, for it would require the poet to glorify Thebes as controller of the Boiotian confederacy and Cadmos as founder of the Theban Cadmeia: such a general brief would indeed open up a wide range of possible subject matter. If the hymn was indeed connected with Boiotian interests, a relatively late date might be indicated, for the confederacy was inactive after the Persian invasion, up to its reformation under Theban leadership around 447 BC;151 and indeed there is nothing to prevent us reading the first hymn as a product of Pindar's old age. The seven wise men were closely identified with Delphi and its propaganda.152 In praising their wisdom (fr. 35b), Pindar will have been reflecting the oocpia of Delphi as an oracular centre, placed in the context of revealed ao(pia about Zeus and the universe.153 And in a work where Pythagorean concepts of music, the Muses and ápjLiovía are so prominently reflected, it was natural to think of Delphi, for Aristoxenus recorded that Pythagoras 'took most of his ethical teachings from Themistocleia [a priestess] at Delphi'; there was Pythagorean interest (perhaps linked with the tetractys) in the Delphic tripod; an early acusma identified Pythagoras as the Hyperborean Apollo, and the biographical tradition associates him with the Pythian Apollo.154 Above all, there is the acusma identifying the tetractys , the Pythagorean secret of the cosmos, with harmony and with the Delphic oracle itself, 'the seat of the highest and most secret wisdom'.155 The early Pythagoreans will have wished to assert linkages between Apolline cult in Metapontum and Croton, and Delphi, as the panhellenic cult centre;156 and for their part, the authorities at Delphi will have had a strong interest in associating the oracle with Gocpia in other fields, including poetry and mystery revelation.157 VIH: Conclusions In an era which witnessed the emergence of new ideas concerning the universe, the place within it of cities and men, and man's sources of knowledge about it, Pindar's revealed Gocpia will have caught and synthesised some of the religious and intellectual currents of the time. The poet seems to have depicted a rational and ordered universe, presenting it as a apļuovia revealed to men through ļiODOiKiļ, a musical translation effected, moreover, in 'the godbuilt sound of vójuoť (fr. 35c), as the just universe was governed by 150 Schachter 1994, 82-83.

Behind these approaches to wisdom, we can glimpse something of the religious- intellectual dialogue between western Pythagoreans and Delphi, and perhaps also something of the mystic, revelatory impact of Pythagoreanism itself. For its part, in harmonising old and new world views, the first hymn will have represented a reworking of Hesiod's Theogony for the greater glory of Boiotian Thebes, its civic cults, and its connections with the great religious centres of the Greek world. It was at Thebes, Pindar tells us, that the Muses first brought |liougikt1 to men; a Boiotian poet, Hesiod, inspired by the Heliconian Muses, had composed the canonical theogony; and it was through Pindar's music, performed perhaps at a Boiotian religious ceremony and certainly by a Theban chorus, that a fifth century audience might gain access to true knowledge of the harmonious workings of the universe.
