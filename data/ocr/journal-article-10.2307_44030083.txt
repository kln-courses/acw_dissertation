<plain_text><page sequence="1">The nature/culture dichotomy finds uneasy meeting ground in the garden. But particularly in settler cultures, "the garden" introduces other unresolved dichotomies: indigenous and imported; wild and domesticated; pests and pets; traditional myth and scientific rationality. This essay considers these issues by focussing on the pub- lic debate over fruit bat colonies in the Melbourne (Australia) Botanical Gardens. Bats in the Gardens HELEN TIFFIN Gardens contradiction. nature while and gardening delighting As Dorothy have in how Jones been human expresses and hands remain it, "gardens have sites guided of invite radical and us controlled to ambivalence commune it" (31). with and Gardens contradiction. As Dorothy Jones expresses it, "gardens invite us to commune with nature while delighting in how human hands have guided and controlled it" (31). They represent an often troubled actual and symbolic meeting ground between what we have traditionally constructed as "culture" and its apparent antonym, "nature." While both the culture/nature dichotomy and its uncomfortable reconciliation in "the garden" are characteristic of a number of human societies, it is in the West that the paradoxes so generated are perhaps most evident. The Garden, original symbol of Paradise, is also the symbol of Paradise lost; cast out of Eden, Adam and Eve must labour in the "wilderness" to render it "fruitful," converting an untamed nature into human cultural territory. Wilderness also derives its primary mythic meaning from an imaginative geography grounded in Middle Eastern cultures, and perhaps not surprisingly, has come to con- tain further symbolic and material complexities and contradictions consequent upon Mosaic 38/4 0027- 1276-05/00 1016$02.00Â©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">2 Mosaic 38/4 (December 2005) the transplanting of Christianity to parts of the world where cultural history and geo- graphical realities often collide with it. Such complex foundational yet unstable connotations of "nature ""culture," "wilder- ness," and "garden" necessarily underpin the more specific ambivalences and contra- dictions in the attitudes toward the land and landscape of British settler colony cultures. One of the most obvious legacies of colonialism from the fifteenth century onwards was the increasing domination of the rest of the world not only by European peoples, but by European epistemologies and ontologies. Europeans, through invasion and settlement in what Alfred Crosby terms "the Neo-Europes," or as governing elites in, for instance, India and central Africa, drastically altered, albeit in a variety of very different ways and to varying degrees, the landscapes of the areas they settled or admin- istered. The result was often the destruction of age-old patterns of ecological accom- modation between indigenous peoples, animals, and plants, or, at worst, the entire annihilation of the partners in these traditional exchanges. Introducing their own crops and livestock, and with ideas that increasingly stressed "progress" and "development," Europeans attempted to recreate, in sometimes totally recalcitrant soil, the agricultural and farming patterns of their homeland or enforced cash crop growing on local com- munities in place of indigenous crop rotation. Native animals, especially in the neo- Europes, were increasingly displaced or hunted, sometimes to extinction, to provide land for sheep and cattle, wheat, corn, and barley. This re-creation (or attempted re- creation) of European patterns of agriculture and/or an aesthetics of landscape was not always energized by simple survival or economic gain. Memories of and nostalgia for the homescapes of "the old country" also provided a powerful impetus to alter the "new" land rather than seek to know and understand it. In the English settler colonies, gardens of all kinds still represented (and represent) a conjunction of "nature" (or, in Val Plumwood's useful designation, "the more-than- human world" [11]) and culture (predominantly the human or human-wrought). But the relationship between settler colony horticulture and agriculture and the surround- ing environment was also that between the exotic and the indigenous where exotic and indigenous sat in rather different relation from those they had established in Europe. From the perspective of early settler societies, gardens (and agriculture) represented the retrieval of a lost European culture ; less a discovery or recreation of the original Garden of Eden (except perhaps in the United States) than of the longed-for Garden of England. Unable and/or unwilling to exchange ancestral habits of sustenance and aes- thetics, and in disturbingly alien environments, settlers often regarded the new lands as virtually worthless, clearing vegetation to plant European staples (and ornamentals) on vast scales. Agriculture and horticulture in the neo-Europes, then, represented not only</page><page sequence="3">Helen Tiffin 3 an attempted re-creation of the former homelands but an indispensable buffer against both a mythologically recalcitrant "wilderness," and an actually hostile one inimical to Europeans in terms of climate, geography, geology, and vista. Inhabited by "wild ani- mals" and people who appeared the antithesis of all that was "civilized," the biotas (including human inhabitants) of the neo-Europes were at best disregarded; at worst, utterly destroyed. Native plants sent back from the colonies to London s Kew Gardens or to private European collectors in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth cen- turies evoked metropolitan wonder and contributed to the display of imperial knowl- edge and power; but to the colonists themselves, these local animals and plants frequently seemed of little material or spiritual value. By the late nineteenth-century, however, the very success of the settlers in "con- quering" their new lands, in converting an alien nature to European patterns of agri/ horticulture, had led, at least in some areas, to a belated perception of what had been and was being lost. "Wilderness" seemed increasingly less hostile, so little of it remain- ing that its value and the tragic results of its imminent extinction became alarmingly manifest. In Europe, the "more-than-human" had long succumbed to the human in incremental stages; in the neo-Europes, the pace of the annihilation of wild flora and fauna was palpable. Consequently it was in the settler colonies of the United States and New Zealand that the first wilderness preserves were set aside in the late nine- teenth century. National Parks arose in an always-to-some-degree-compromised attempt to protect nature from human culture in re-establishing, where possible, the "original" pre-colonial ecological relationships. In the United States, such preserves now occupy only a very small percentage of the country, with little more set aside in the other Anglo-settler colonies. Such preserves increasingly seem like walled gardens, tended by humans to preserve "wild" plants and animals radically threatened by human encroachment. Such attempts to preserve what remains are both essential and laudible, but they inadvertently encourage an increasing apartheid between an already radically dichotomized nature and culture. As a number of commentators have noted, such wilderness areas are supported primarily by urban dwellers who visit the parks only briefly on holidays, or at most, for recreation on weekends. Moreover, the increas- ing necessity of such (selective) preservation further divides not just plants but animals into the domestic and the wild, the tame and the dangerous. The third dichotomy on which the conception of such parks depends is that between native and exotic species where an initial obsession with the Euro-imported has been, in the late twentieth- century, selectively eroded, leading to the determined eradication from preserved wildernesses of animals and plants brought in by settlers or introduced since their arrival.</page><page sequence="4">4 Mosaic 38/4 (December 2005) Michael Pollan has argued that America's "two great contributions to the world history of landscape" are "the front lawn and the wilderness preserve" ("Beyond" 1) - ecologically antithetical areas. Yet both the wilderness preserve and the front lawn share, for all their divergences, a conception of "pest" species of both plants and ani- mals, however differently these are constituted. Ralph Waldo Emerson, so Pollan argues, "was unable to reconcile his sense of the sacredness of untouched land with the gardener's faith that the landscape can be improved by cultivation." For his disci- ple Thoreau, however, living out "in nature" at Waiden Pond, the same perplex was expressed a little differently. When Thoreau "determines to make the earth say beans instead of grass' - that is, when he begins to garden - he finds that for the first time he has made enemies in nature: the worms, the morning dew, woodchucks, and of course weeds [...]. He now finds himself making 'invidious distinctions with his hoe, levelling whole ranks of one species and seriously cultivating another.'" At the end of the bean field chapter, as Pollan notes, Thoreau cannot any longer take the guilt involved in "weeding and warring with pests" and he "trudges back to the Emersonian fold, renewing his uncritical worship of the wild" ("Beyond" 2). The establishment of park preserves in the late nineteenth and twentieth cen- turies to maintain (and sometimes actively re-create) pre-colonial ecologies changed the values ascribed to "exotic" and "indigenous" and increasingly, in reserve areas, inverted their value. Instead of the indigenous plants and animals of the settlers' new environments being regarded as "pests," the imported disturbers of a once pristine nature were re-cast in this role. Where "wild" animals and indigenized plants had threatened cottage and urban gardens and agricultural projects, these were often the very species now acknowledged as rare or even "endangered," and thus newly valued. But such a reversal of value still depended (and depends) on a spatial apartheid. The indigenous was cherished only in the preserves; such plants and animals could and can still become agricultural and urban pests if they strayed/stray into human domi- nated areas. From these areas they have usually been already exiled or exterminated and attempts on their part to re-colonize the wider lands they once inhabited was (and is) usually unwelcome. And if the wild is not encouraged to venture into urban districts, "domesticated" animals (such as cats and dogs or sheep and goats) are ban- ished from the parks. It is against this background of the vexed and changing relationships between the indigenous and the exotic, the pampered and the pest in Europe's settler colonies that I wish to examine a particular clash over the presence of fruit bats in the Melbourne (Australia) Botanical Gardens. The terms in which this rather savage debate came to be conducted are indicative of the degree to which traditional settler colony attitudes</page><page sequence="5">Helen Tiffin 5 to gardens and gardening, to wilderness parks, to the wild and the urban and to exoti- cism and indigeniety, continue to play major roles in human attitudes to our "more- than-human world" and influence its prospects in the future. Botanical gardens differ in purpose from both suburban lawns and wilderness areas, whether situated in Europe or the neo-Europes, and are usually found in urban areas, frequently in the heart of cities. In Europe, they had their origins in private and public herb and medicinal gardens; in the collection and cultivation of exotic species for enjoyment and profit; and as urban recreational parks with special buildings (such as glass houses) for the cultivation of climatically sensitive exotics. They were also key sites of state-sponsored agricultural and horticultural experimentation and focal in world-wide plant collection and cataloguing. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, major metropolitan gardens like London's Kew also became both the cen- tre of imperial/colonial plant exchange and the seat of authority for the classifying and naming of plants and animals long familiar to their indigenous populations, but new to the European settlers and to the European archive. In its exotic collections too, Kew offered a display of imperial power; regions representing colonial flora were con- tained within an English landscape and connected by areas and paths bordered by temperate trees and flowers in a relatively benign horticultural demonstration of cap- ture and enclosure. Botanical gardens in the colonies naturally shared many features with Kew and their other European progenitors. Their curators or directors kept in constant contact with Kew or other metropolitan centres (and sometimes received funds from them), collected local specimens for European cultivation and identification, and sent to and received plants and seeds from Kew as well as from other parts of Britain's vast empire (both directly from other colonial Gardens directors and through Kew). But in pri- vate settler colony gardens, local plants were unpopular and rare; instead, the settlers cultivated English and European plants and came to public gardens to marvel at exot- ic specimens and trees, shrubs and annuals transplanted from the "old country." As some thwarted naturalists remarked, the last place to see and study collections of indigenous South African plants would be South African Botanical Gardens, or for Caribbean plants, St. Vincent or the Hope Gardens (McCracken 42). Jamaica Kincaid observes the same of the Botanical Gardens in Antigua where she grew up: plants were named and interesting; but none were Antiguan (156). Settler colony botanical gardens then, represented for their patrons less a meet- ing ground between the local and the exotic or even culture and nature, than an urban place predominantly cultural in its meaning: an oasis of old world civilization con- tained within an otherwise barbarous landscape. That such gardens tended to contain</page><page sequence="6">6 Mosaic 38/4 (December 2005) combinations of temperate European plants and (often tropical) exotics from other parts of the globe did not in any way detract from their primarily cultural role. The exotics provided, as at Kew, a reminder of the reach and wonder of Empire, while European and English plants served as living icons of the lost ancestral land. Whether they were agricultural experiment centres or not, many botanical gardens were thus, for their settler colony patrons, predominantly recreational parks in which, for a few hours at least, one could believe oneself back at the seat of metropolitan sophistication. They also offered an enclosed retreat from surrounding "colonial" nature, bringing culture, order, and containment to an otherwise oppressively vast, alien, and seeming- ly uncontrollable landscape. In settler colonies, progressive "familiarization" with the land meant less a getting to know what was there than a conversion of it to the Euro- familiar. Outside urban and suburban areas, the transformation of indigenous plain- land to crop monocultures or cattle and sheep farming served a not dissimilar purpose. Acclimatization societies were also assiduous in importing European plants and ani- mals not just for food, but for sport, recreation, and nostalgia. Foxes, sparrows, and rabbits, to name a very few, were introduced into Australia for these reasons. If significance imported European for a number plants of - generations trees, shrubs, of white flowers settlers - carried in the a wealth "neo-Europes," of nostalgic the significance for a number of generations of white settlers in the "neo-Europes," the animals brought to these "alien" lands and those encountered there were already sym- bolically overdetermined by European associations; and not all such associations were positive or benign. While there had never been fruit bats of the size of those encoun- tered in, for instance, Australia and the South Pacific, smaller insectivorous and blossom bats were quite familiar; but the European settlers brought with them a rich tradition of bat lore that had little to do with "natural" history. While vampire bats were not to be found in either Europe, Australia, or the South Pacific, they were nevertheless a funda- mental part of European folk belief, always more significant in their symbolic reso- nances than in their actual presence. For Westerners and for many other societies, bats have a remarkable range of metaphoric associations. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the term "bat" to an Old Icelandic word meaning "leather flutterer," while genetic studies suggest that fruit bats, branching off from other bat species thirty-five million years ago, may be much more closely related to us than we had thought. But neither the observational (and very poetic) Icelandic description nor the contemporary genetic revelations are most characteristic of the images that bats conjured for nineteenth century settlers, and which they still evoke in contemporary Western societies. Unless they are being observed for scientific purposes, bats - both concept and animal - conjure a broad range of associations with</page><page sequence="7">Helen Tiffin 7 darkness, the occult, and blood sucking. While they are thus redolent of vampirism, the legends of Dracula, the un-dead, clouded moons, and caves, an English expression often associated with them, "bats in the belfry," suggests an added connotative range. The always half-joking question "Are you bats?" tends to reference the belfry metaphor (first noted in 1901) and suggests a massive confusion in the brain; the "disorderly" wheeling and flapping observed of disturbed bat colonies. Such negative associations, particularly the most obvious Western cluster (vam- pirism, death, caves, castles), are not universal. From South American communities Elizabeth Benson reports very different Genesis stories from both that of the Western biblical fiat of human dominion over all animals and the specific European associa- tion of bats with terror and the (un) dead. The leader of the first people of the Chaco region of Northern Argentina, for instance, was "a bat man hero who taught people all they needed to know as human beings" (7-8), while from the Ge in Brazil comes the story of a tribe who "moved through the night led by a bat who looked for light towards which to guide them" (8). The central significance of bat or bat/human fig- ures in Meso and South American pre-Columbian cultures was that, according to Benson, they symbolized anomaly and transformation; they were also revered because many of the plants on which these cultures depended were bat-pollinated or dispersed (9). There have been helpful or benignly neutral bat/human figures in Western tradi- tions, Batman being a very modern example, while in the Odyssey there are bat-like souls headed for Hades. But these are reserved for children, or in the case of the Odyssey ; still more redolent of death than life or light. If the species boundary, in Western cultures at least, is constructed and main- tained by quotidian metaphorical practice, it is a practice that necessarily acts as a double-edged sword, simultaneously connecting and dividing. Both anthropomor- phism and theriomorphism (or zoomorphism) are intrinsic to daily discourse, so much so that anthropologist Nick Fiddes challenges us to get through one day with- out employing animal metaphors or maxims such as "Like a lamb to the slaughter"; "These people are animals"; "politicians with their snouts in the trough"; "you greedy pig"; "you stupid cow," and so on. Conversely, we anthropomorphize our pets, and when animals render us an unexpected service we call them "heroic," praising their actions in human terms; or, when their needs conflict with ours, vilifying them as "evil" (Baker 35) as in the case of wolves, or that of the Tasmanian tiger, whose mis- placed reputation as a "sheep killer" led to its extinction. Such patterns of apparently casual (or deliberately rhetorical) metaphorical usages simultaneously maintain, as they appear to erode, the "species boundary"; and they provide a further background against which to consider the terms of the contemporary debate occasioned by the</page><page sequence="8">8 Mosaic 38/4 (December 2005) intrusion into urban (and suburban) areas of Melbourne by a colony of indigenous Australian fruit bats. As one commentator has noted, debates about native bat "invasions" in Australia have generated as much (or more) heat and even violence on the part of opposed human groups than almost any other animal issue (Powell, "Bats/Flying"), and through the terms in which such debates have been conducted, we sometimes become acutely aware of inherited contradictions in our attitudes to animals and to ourselves, to our environments, both urban and wild, indigenous and exotic, and to specific paradox- es generated by settler colony histories and their clash with contemporary ideas about the environment and conservation. In 2001, a colony of "flying- foxes" took up resi- dence in the Melbourne Botanical Gardens, a place described by one of the debate's protagonists as "the cultural heart of the city" (AAP, "New website"). Over the previ- ous three years, a colony of flying foxes had established a base in one particular area of the Gardens, their increasing numbers inadvertently (they don't eat leaves) damag- ing the tree foliage in which they roosted/slept during the day. Since 1994, all flying foxes (including the grey-headed bats) had been protected in Australia, but people who wished the bats expelled from the Gardens argued that their numbers had increased so rapidly that they were no longer in need of protection. Various methods of discouraging (expelling) the bats - for example, constant disturbance morning and evening, a method that had already been tried in the Sydney Botanical Gardens (Crawford 3) - failed to dislodge them. As the debate in Melbourne escalated, Gardens supporters called for their removal, while bat supporters retaliated with threats to destroy hundred-year old (mostly imported) trees in the Gardens if the bats were killed (AAP, "How animal"). By now, so the Gardens supporters claimed, bats were nesting "indiscriminately" in both native and exotic trees, particularly in the Fern Gully. Australian native flying foxes are nocturnal, feeding on - as their name sug- gests - fruit and fruit blossom, occasionally (but not deliberately, as in the case of many smaller bat species) consuming insect pests with the fruit and blossom. But much of their ecological importance lies, as with a number of other fruit-bat species, in their role in pollination. Nevertheless, their consumption of orchard fruits and fruit in urban gardens (together with the long-held negative associations not just with bats but also to a lesser degree with "foxes") has often made them unpopular in urban and country areas. During the debate over their fate in Melbourne (and earlier in Sydney, as well as at a number of sites in Queensland and Maclean on the Northern New South Wales coast) the bats, as well as provoking constant allusions to vampirism and darkness, were ironically depicted as outsiders; invaders, newcomers, vandals</page><page sequence="9">Helen Tiffin 9 destroying "centuries" of European culture; an anomalous turn, given current Australia- wide campaigns to eradicate imported" pest" species of plants and animals (and not just in park preserves) to save native flora and fauna. Grey-headed flying fox colonies migrate from one nesting site to another, sometimes staying several months or years in one particular area. But it is the loss of suitable habitat due to human encroachment that has increasingly driven them into the urban and suburban areas to seek both food and suitable roosting sites. 'Tm calling for the immediate culling of the bats," professor of Urban Planning at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Dimity Reed, wrote, This treasure house [the Melbourne Botanical Gardens, specifically the Fern Gully] is being destroyed by an invasion of grey-headed flying foxes [...]. The flying foxes dont actually eat the trees and ferns, but their activities wear out the canopy [...] as they squabble and flap about. They also nip leaves off to let sun and warmth in for their comfort [...]. The fly- ing-foxes arrived and found the city so amenable because of the seemingly endless food supply of the private gardens and fruit trees around our suburbs. They devour the private gardens and rush back to the Botanical Gardens to mate and sleep. Then they set off again at sunset for our suburban paradise. But in the Botanical Gardens, trees, ferns and smaller plants [ . . . ] are now shockingly damaged and vast areas of lawn unusable [...]. These gardens [...] were established to celebrate plant life, [and they] will die within twenty years [...] unable to withstand the onslaught of these predators (13). Reed paints a picture of selfish, invading marauders attacking the "cultural heart" of a city that was "a centre of civilisation far from the ancient European inheritors of the Western tradition" (3). After giving an account of the history and scientific impor- tance of Melbourne's Botanical Gardens, Reed invokes an Anglo-urban/pastoral idyll of "families strolling and picnicking" while "children tumble down the hills, feed the swans and collect tadpoles in jam jars." The now "newly arrived" (but actually indige- nous) bat savages can, however, only "squabble and fight." Other Gardens supporters calling for flying fox killing also accused them (and the tone is accusatory) of "hang- ing up side-down" (their natural resting posture) and being "creatures of the night" disturbing "our days" (Powell, "Bats/Flying"). What is particularly interesting about the rhetoric and negative anthropomorphism employed is its invocation of a European pastoral spoiled by the Australian grey-headed flying fox in an era of support for and attempted restoration of native flora and fauna after a century of settler- colony envi- ronmental destruction. Paradoxically, the indigenous "invaders" of the Melbourne Gardens are regarded as bent on the destruction of European civilization. Moreover, the bats, like native peoples in the era of European colonization, are, in contrast to the</page><page sequence="10">10 Mosaic 38/4 (December 2005) Gardens themselves, figured as being without history; static, timeless, a species whose individual members are by definition interchangeable and hence replaceable. Repeatedly during the campaign the term "historic" accompanied mention of the Melbourne Gardens in the press (see Powell; Hart; Simeon; Gallagher): "These historic Gardens are now threatened by an invasion of Letting the bats live was likened by the director of the Gardens to allowing "a plague of rats to chew through the State Library Collection" (Gallagher). This was not the first time that the Melbourne Gardens' plant collection had been likened to a European archive or library. Under the late nineteenth-century director Ferdinand Von Mueller, thirty thousand trees had, by the 1860's, been planted and arranged, as one antagonist wrote, "with humorless teu- tonic thoroughness, a living textbook of systematic and economic botany with garden beds for pages" (qtd. in McCracken 32). Historyless themselves, the bats are represent- ed, like "human savages," as lacking respect for archival culture. And as a "plague" species, they cannot be regarded as suffering individuals. Instead, these (collective) "others" exist outside of time and progress, an attitude whose nature and effects in human colonialist contexts Johannes Fabian has so eloquently examined in Time and the Other. The bats were also negatively anthropomorphized by association with other animals: "As dusk settles over Melbourne's majestic Royal Botanical Gardens, winged black silhouettes fill the sky accompanied by a cacophony of shrill barks" (Garrett 6). Like veritable Hounds of the Baskervilles, they "howl and bark weirdly" and in a very contemporary evocation of the terrors of an insect otherness, "look like giant larvae" (Garrett 106). Like unruly gardens visitors, their manners also leave much to be desired. They "behave appallingly and urinate while hanging upside down" (Hart 17), proclivities reminiscent of earlier (human) botanical gardens pests. In his study of botanical gar- dens throughout the British Empire, Donai McCracken notes that while curators of some Indian Gardens had difficulty in controlling the more arrogant members of the Raj, some of whom insisted on riding horses at speed through them, nineteenth and early twentieth-century Australian curators reported having more problems with "drunks, vagrants and impropriety," the latter activities detailed as "grossly indecent goings on among the bushes" or "displaying uxorious affection" (McCracken 168). Human pests had also frequently been expelled (though not culled) for urinating (not necessarily upside down). If economic cultivation and imperial botanical study coupled with settler nostal- gia for England was the motivation for the establishment of many "new world" gardens, early ecological studies of indigenous flora and fauna in the settler colonies tended to concentrate on the so-called pest species, and in this Australia was no exception. "The</page><page sequence="11">Helen Tiffin 1 1 appearance of Charles Elton's Animal Ecology in 1927 provided a basis on which zoo- logical ecology could build [...]. [But white Australia's] animal ecology began with agri- cultural and pastoral pests rather than with its distinctive marsupial fauna" (Robin 69) or its astonishingly beautiful birds and flowers. One of the first specialist ecologists sent to Australia was Francis Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe came to study the biology of the so-called "giant" fruit-eating bats, regarded as an agricultural menace on the East Coast, espe- cially in Queensland. The fruit growers were interested not in the bats' ecology, but in the most economical method of extermination. Ratcliffe's findings, however, tended to exonerate the bats as primary orchard marauders, in that the majority did not live on orchard fruit (Robin 78). Ratcliffe also published his widely disseminated Flying Fox and Drifting Sand : The Adventures of a Biologist in Australia in 1947, sections of which were used in Australian primary school classrooms (including Queensland and Victoria) to attempt to alert the next generation to "the limits of [settler-colony] agri- cultural enterprise" (Robin 79). The 1950s thus signalled the beginning of the rehabilitation of the image of the native bat from its hellish and pestilential reputations. In many cases it was even trans- formed from pest to pet. Numerous bats were rescued from lethal human entangle- ments (such as barbed- wire fences) and bottle fed as orphans to be reared as pets until they could be released (AAR "New website" 2). In this way, the bats crossed, troubled, or interrogated that confidently maintained boundary between ourselves and other species. For, as Nick Fiddes has noted, pets and primates (for rather different reasons) introduce irresolvible "greys" into the black and white of the idea of the human and its animal others. Pets, for instance, become an intrinsic part of human families, loved, cared for, and often mourned and missed as deeply as are human family members. Moreover, actual relationships with individuals rather than detached observation of species members make mass killings seem more like murder or genocide. As bat pop- ularity with humans increased, more flying foxes were adopted as pets, a trend accel- erated in the 1980s when the Australian Broadcasting Commission's Richard Morecroft charmed nation-wide audiences with his stories of raising Archie, an orphaned bat. Morecroft bottle fed Archie, showed him off in handkerchief nappies, and kept him snuggled under his shirt when he read the news (Powell, "Time" 11). By 1994, flying foxes were protected in every state in Australia, and when, not long after, they "invaded" the "historic" palm grove in the Sydney Botanical Gardens, the tone of press articles recounting the efforts of staff and scientists to dislodge them was initially benignly anthropomorphic and sometimes comic in tone. Even in Melbourne in 1998, the Age commented of the bats in the Gardens that "during the day you can see the bats in the trees in the fern gully, hanging upside down in slumber or discussing</page><page sequence="12">12 Mosaic 38/4 (December 2005) issues of interest (fruit preferences, blood-sucking cousins, etc). It is at dusk that things really get going as the bats strike out for their nightly flap to the food laden sur- rounding suburbs [...]. The lazy ones take cabs" ("Bats" 2). But between 1998 and 2001 bats suffered a spectacular fall from grace. Just as they seemed to have begun to escape their inherited freight of European symbology (Dracula, night, caves, cabbal- istic associations) and their settler- agriculturalist stereotypes as crop pests and thieves, they suffered a particularly heavy setback through their sudden publicity as (potential) vectors of three previously unknown diseases: Lyssavirus, Equine morbil- livirus (or Hendra virus), and paramyxovirus (Powell, "Bats/Flying"). The latter pri- marily affects pigs, though in certain circumstances (particularly in conjunction with Japanese meningitis), it can infect humans, in extreme cases causing death. Lyssavirus is curable, and Equine morbillivirus is known to have killed a small number of hors- es and two people in Queensland (Powell; Garrett; ABC, "Fatal"; "Bats Bites"). All three viruses require another mammalian host apart from bats and humans to com- plete their transference cycles, thus crossing the so-called disease species barrier not once, but twice. Such "species jumping" and genetically mutating diseases, like AIDS, like Ebola, like "mad cow," have become the particular terror of our times; not only because we have just recently become aware of them, but because they violate our own sense of special identity, our singular subjectivity constructed against the "non- human," that is, the animal and the animalistic. Such viruses (or protein prions in the case of "mad cow" disease) remind us that we are not special, but ineluctably an intrinsic part of that more-than-human world. Thus, although there have been many more deaths of humans in Australia from snake bites and bee stings (not to mention cancer, our other human diseases, car accidents, suicides), bats once again became the target of public vilification. Ancient associations with death and darkness were revived and reinvoked. And while none of these new viruses is a true haemorrhagic fever, the horror of a genetically mutating and species-crossing disease was redolent of the most notorious of the latter, Ebola. Connections to Ebola were made by some scientists and members of the general public, with the horrors of a lethal capillary- dissolving dis- ease necessarily setting off the older echoes of Dracula and vampirism. Together, then, with the flying foxes' inadvertent damage to foliage in the Fern Gully of the Melbourne Botanical Gardens was added the fear of patrons contracting a possibly fatal disease from the bats. After unsuccessful attempts had been made to move the colony to Ivanhoe (where some bats had instead "colonized" the Geelong Botanical Gardens), the debate over the fate of the remaining Melbourne bats was rekindled. The bats were shot, secretly at night, to thwart supporters who had threat- ened to damage the trees if the bats were killed. Against the bat detractors, who</page><page sequence="13">Helen Tiffin 1 3 termed bats "tree killers" and dangerous to humans using the historic park, bat sup- porters invoked counter anthropomorphic images of nursing mothers with babies; bats screaming when they were shot, and many of the wounded simply left to die in pain. Some scientific supporters also appealed to the important ecological roles of bats and their status as an endangered species. The latter, however, was frequently met with a sentiment anti-bat protagonists in Melbourne and elsewhere had expressed: "Go and be endangered somewhere else" (Darling 6). The fruit bats were "out of place," a native, wild species invading our urban space(s); the wild (re) encroaching on the human, the essentially "savage" on the "civilized." Such out-of-placeness has become a not uncom- mon problem world wide, as we claim more and more land while attempting to shore up what we can of "wilderness," protecting it from its increasingly accelerating global destruction by human groups. But having congratulated ourselves on some apartheid protectionism, we remain unwilling or unable to accommodate those species capable of moving into our spaces; an accommodation we will need to accept if we are to pre- serve even something of the biodiversity of the planet. In the logics of (Euro -American) human domination, placement in hierarchies and in space is crucial. As Michael Pollan has argued, the great American contribu- tions to environmental practice and understanding have been the suburban lawn and the conserved wilderness area. But like the border between human and animal, and with a worldwide crisis of human overpopulation, the lines between wilderness and lawn that we are often intent on maintaining will also need to be accepted as perme- able. In the settler colonies, and in Australia in particular, there is a current drive for the preservation of wilderness not only in space/place but in terms of time; the time before white invasion of the continent. This is a laudible attempt at environmental restitution, and it certainly deserves support. But attempting to preserve (always pro- tean) environments, in time as well as space, creates its own apparently irresolvable problems. What of the animals we imported, whose own interests run counter to the attempted re-assembly of a pre-colonial environmental "purity" circa 1788, a con- temporary project not unrelated to its much earlier pre-Enlightenment progenitor, the re-assembly or recovery of a pre-Lapsarian (Botanical) Garden of Eden (Prest 9)? What of those indigenous animals like bats, other mammals, and birds who, pressured out of their environments by our increasing populations, have little alternative but to try to share our space? Do we consider animals as suffering individuals (as the sup- porters of the flying foxes did in the "bats versus Gardens" debate) or as part of a species we may or may not wish to preserve? As sizeable wild areas disappear, it will simply not be possible for animals to "go and be endangered somewhere else." In the settler colonies of the world and especially in Britain's former settler</page><page sequence="14">14 Mosaic 38/4 (December 2005) colonies, the radical human experiment that has been undertaken has involved - often from a basis of what we now consider genocide, and difficult, painful, and still unresolved though it so often is - an accommodation between settler-invader popu- lations and the (now minority) indigenous owner-occupiers of the land. It has also involved a suspension of prejudice against ethnic and racial immigrant "others" who have had to be accommodated in what were often deeply prejudiced Anglo-Saxon set- tler enclaves. "Immigrants," especially those not deriving from British or even European backgrounds, have been, like native peoples, vilified as "out of place" in pre- dominantly Anglo-settler areas. Frequently told by the descendants of British settlers to "go back to where you came from," later waves of immigrants, like banished, segre- gated, and ill-treated native populations, have been and are still accused of "behaving badly" (i.e. not like "us"); of carrying diseases; of invading our space; of being "smelly" and of making too much noise, disturbing our notions of who and what "we" are. There is little cause for self-congratulation on the part of any former settler colony in learning to "share" space, in spite of the contrasts we liked to draw between our own vexed acceptances of racial and ethnic "otherness" and South Africa's noto- rious apartheid policies. But it is nevertheless the case that in Canada, the United States, New Zealand, and Australia, "multiculturalism," for all the government hype that so often surrounds it, and in spite of its constant falterings, has had at least a par- tial success. "Places" are, however imperfectly, being shared with "others." In both "Beyond Wilderness and Lawn" and Second Nature, Michael Pollan's praise of the garden as a potential meeting ground between culture and nature, lawn and wilderness, depends on a necessary degree of exclusion. Emerson, he argues, tried to "pass off the truly dangerous idea [...] that there is no such thing as a weed." Thoreau gave up and became a wilderness preservationist whose campaign with Frederick Law Olmsted was in part responsible for the establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872. The Park was Thoreaus answer to the conundrum he could not solve in terms of his attempted self-sustenance at Waiden: "Do not these beans grow the woodchucks too? How then can our harvest fail? Shall I not rejoice also at the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granaries of the birds?" (qtd. in Pollan, "Beyond" 2). Thoreau, Pollan notes, thus "gives up entirely on the garden - an act with unfortunate consequences not just for the American garden, but for all American cul- ture in general" (2). During his own education as a gardener, Pollan faces the same dilemma as Thoreau and Emerson: What about garden pests strayed in from "the wild"? But he solves the dilemma differentiy from Thoreau (and Emerson) by declar- ing against both plant and animal "pests," whether indigenous or imported: "I soon came to understand the distance between the naturalist who gazes benignly on all of</page><page sequence="15">Helen Tiffin 15 nature's operations, and the experienced gardener, who perforce has developed a somewhat less sentimental view. Particularly toward woodchucks. I am not ready to see them banished from the planet altogether [...] but I seriously doubt that news of some form of woodchuck megadeath [ . . . ] would put me in an elegiac frame of mind" (Pollan, Second 47). Pollan is concerned specifically with ornamental gardens in mak- ing a worthwhile plea for heterogeneous urban cultivation over the monotonous and ecologically destructive lawn, and he recognizes that, with the inevitable spread of human populations, the lawn/wilderness apartheid is both destructive and ultimate- ly unsustainable. There is much with which to sympathize in this view, and the Emersonian dictum of re-thinking the cultivar/weed distinction inevitably raises the issue, not so much in terms of ornamental garden cultivation, as agricultural sustain- ability for a human population of planetary plague proportions. Small scale organic farming, important though it is, probably cannot and will not offer a universal long- term solution. Crops (if not ornamental gardens) may continue to require the ban- ishment of pests. But long term human "sustainability" in all its forms also requires more than the wholesale extermination of those species we uncompromisingly (and often quite casually) designate as "pests" or "vermin" without exploring the potential, however limited, for their accommodation. As national boundaries become increasingly permeable (in spite of current United States paranoia) over the next twenty years, we will need to concentrate on internal as well as external spatial adjustments; adjustments that will have to include the "more-than-human" as well as the human. While we maintain our defence of those areas of wilderness which remain, we must at the same time seek to accommodate, both philosophically and actually, those other species - the indigenous and exotic, the wild and the tame, "pests" and pets - whose planet we also inhabit. As an American Humane Society slogan proclaimed some years ago, "It's their world too." Our refusal to acknowledge and at least attempt to accommodate this philosophy will necessarily result, at the very least, in our own material and spiritual impoverishment.
