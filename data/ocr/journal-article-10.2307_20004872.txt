Concepts of God in Africa. (S.P.C.K.) 6os. One of the most important and puzzling manifestations of religion in modern Africa has been the emergence of many sectarian or independent churches. Viewed on the one hand as undisciplined, if not heretical, and on the other as Africa's own way of evangelism, they testify to the vitality of religious life. Such churches are almost entirely of African inspiration and organisation, breaking away from a mother mission or bursting out spontaneously. Full of colour and music, they are often remarkably conservative in liturgy and doctrine and even where they appear to deviate, in emphasis on baptism by immersion or healing by faith, they reproduce elements of an older religious life. David Barrett reckons that there are some six thousand such movements in Africa south of the Sahara and they are growing. With only a small amount of field work, he relies on other writers of uneven quality and some of his statements and figures may be questioned. Nevertheless the size of the problem and the multiplicity of churches are both obvious and most interest is to be found in his general approach and tentative conclusions. Is such sectarianism the result of unbridled Protestantism, which will degenerate into superstition and immorality? And does it not make nonsense of the ecumenical movement? It can be argued that sectarianism is a feature of all religions, the result of individual differences, and that in Africa there is an earnest desire to remain faithful to the historic faith and the Bible, while polygamy has played little part in the formation of independency. Apparently the Christian Councils have shown a coldness, to put it mildly, to African movements that appeared 'exotic', from a European point of view. There has been an extraordinary slowness in recognising one of the largest and most orthodox churches in the Congo, founded by the martyr Simon Kimbangu. Barrett, differently from many missionaries, sees African In dependency as a surge of reformation and renewal and he is not frightened by unusual customs or costumes. He points out that, differently from sects in some other continents, the independents do not simply steal each other's sheep but are concerned with the evangelisation of their country and are beginning to make progress in regions hitherto closed to Christian missions. His book may be over-optimistic, and some of its facts need checking, but it is essential reading for understanding a continent that is explosive religiously as well as politically. J. D. Y. Peel's book is the kind of specialist study on which Barrett relied, though of course it was too recent to have been used by him. It is a narrow concentration upon the 'praying people', an independent church of the Yoruba of western Nigeria. It overlaps H. W. Turner's African Independent</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 9I Church (I967, reviewed here previously), which is also on the Aladura, though that book is miore eccelesiastical and doctrinal in interest. Peel makes a sociological approach, discussing the composition of church membership, village and town locations, the search for authority and congregational tensions. It is valuable in its restricted field though even here, as in so many similar studies, there is little consideration of the indigenous background, the earlier social and religious framnework, and the religious differences and independency of paganism which have been taken over into Christianity. For a picture of traditional African theology John Mbiti's work gives the most complete overall coverage. This Makerere professor is bursting into print, with another major work published just before this one, African Religions and Philosophy, and an interesting article on eschatology in a recent symposium. He gathers material from over two hundred and seventy tribes and if much of it reads like a catalogue, it is useful to have so much in handy compass. He relies largely upon the writings of modern anthropologists who have done so much to record African customs and beliefs, in countless particularist studies which are invaluable though not always readable. Some of them would no doubt criticise Mbiti's method, but this is comparative theology and this author shows himself fully competent. Ideas of the nature and attributes of God, according to many African peoples, are listed and dissected into many sub-headings, and attractive pictures emerge. God is both transcendent and omnipresent, just and loving, king and providence, father and mother, anthropomorphic and mysterious. God once lived near to man but moved away at human offence, and few Africans offer God regular worship though anyone can pray to him at any time without an intermediary. The divine care is not restricted to this life, and if any belief is held as firmly in Africa as faith in God it is the certainty of a future life. If the early missionaries had known all this there might have been fewer schisms. lf Christian Councils were more generous to the independents now they might ensure that much of tropical Africa that has become Christian remains so. If studies of comparative religion pay attention to books like these they will no longer ignore the contributions which African religion and theology can make to understanding the religious consciousness.
