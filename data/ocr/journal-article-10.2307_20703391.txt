<plain_text><page sequence="1">295 THE POLYNESIAN FAMILY SYSTEM IN KA-'U, HAWAII By E. S. CRAIGHILL HANDY AND MARY KAWENA PUKUI. VIL?TRADITIONAL MANNERS AND CUSTOMS, AND THE SOCIAL ORDER. IN this, the concluding chapter of our series, we shall summarize as briefly as we can a considerable variety of attitudes and practices characteristic of the old Polynesian civilization in Ka-'u, which have not hitherto been described, in such a way as to give a lively sense of relationship and the home; of status and obligations; of kapu, manners and etiquette. It has seemed to us that a simple and effective means of conveying a sense of these intricacies as actualities in the doings of a lively people would be by interspersing the descriptive matter and our comments with sayings and expressions relating to the topics under discussion. Te Rangi Hiroa (Dr. Peter H. Buck) once described how, in his early days as a Public Health Officer visiting Maori communities, it often was necessary to explain to the assembled elders of a tribe the reasons for some regulation or medical measure that he had to enforce. His careful exposition of the dry facts of the situation without recourse to a chant or an anecdote or a story to flavour and enliven his discourse, would be interrupted by some friendly old fellow calling out: Te vai! Te vai! (" Water! Water!") This final paper on the Ka-'u family system we endeavour to flavour with sayings, expressions and some anecdotes. Family Characteristics. Hawaiians, like all Polynesians, were keen observers of physical, temperamental and mental characteristics. There are a great number of terms and numerous sayings descrip tive of physical form and appearance of the body, face, eyes and other features. These refer to individual characteristics rather than to relationship, so we do not include them here. The two sayings that follow show that Hawaiians were observant of the inheritance of traits both physical and psychological.</page><page sequence="2">296 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY Ku no i ke ke'a. E like me ke keke'e o ka lala la'au, pela no kona aka. Like parent, like child. He has the ways of his sire. According to the crooked ness of the branch, so is the crookedness of its shadow. Marriage and Mating. There were figurative ways of expressing the readiness of a youth to mate and to assume the responsibility for mak ing the fire and preparing the food, which was the man's function in the household. Aia a wini kakala, a 'ula ka When the spur is sharp and lepe o ka moa, alalia kau i the comb red, then shall ka haka. the cock rest on a perch. When a boy becomes a man, then shall he take a wife. Kokoke e 'a ke ahi o ka Almost ready to make fire 'aulima. with a fire-stick held in the hand. Said of a boy : almost old enough to mate. Nui e mo'a 'ai ka pulehu. Old enough to broil food. Old enough to have a wife (or husband). This was the period of courtship for youth and maid. Whereas for the first-born of 'ali'i families the marriage was pre-arranged, for the younger lines of 'ali'i and for com moners (as likewise for the ranking 'ali'i in the love matches which took place in addition to the arranged marriage) free dom of choice and spontaneous, casual, or passionate attach ment were the sanctioned prelude to unions which became permanent. These permanent unions were monogamous amongst the people in the lower ranges of the economic scale and polygamous among the wealthy. Though there was freedom of choice in most cases, nevertheless the young folk were given plentiful advice concerning the practical characteristics most desirable in a husband or wife, of which the following is a good example; but one may doubt that the practical was always a prime consideration with ardent youth !</page><page sequence="3">The Polynesian Family System in Ka-'u, Hawai'/ 297 Nana no a ka *ulu i paki Look for the breadfruit that kepau. is gummy on the skin. Advice to a girl to look for a prosperous husband. Love making and courtship were a subtle art in which love songs with hidden meaning, the nose-flute and musical bow were used to carry to the ear of the maiden wooed the delicate innuendoes of sentiment and passion. The maid and her lover both had their own subtle language of glance and gesture. Ho'oipoipo. (An expression.) Refers to the courtship and love-making between lovers, or a song or chant for a sweetheart. Ho'oha'i. (An expression.) A flirtatious coyness. It is perhaps a furtive glance, a coquettish smile, etc. The notion, for which uncomprehending whites in the early days were responsible, that Hawaiians in their old culture-setting were promiscuous is a false one, for promis cuity was indulged in only by the dissolute and was held in contempt by the majority. The saying quoted immediately below, expresses this contempt for the promiscuous ; while that which follows is a slap at a woman whose favours are available to any man?in other words, the harlot. He nohona huikau, naho aku A life of confusion, living noha mai. this way and that. Referring to promiscuous people sharing each other's mates. He 'uha lea Ole. A thigh over which no word is spoken. Said of a woman who never refuses to have sexual inter course with any man who asks her. Young people were taught the wisdom of practical importance of pleasant " in-law " relations, as the next two sayings indicate. Ho'ohoihoi makua hunowai. A pleasing of a parent-in law. Said of one who begins with a great deal of enthusiasm which soon fades into a lack of interest.</page><page sequence="4">298 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY E a'o i ka hana o pa i ka leo Learn to work lest you be o ka makua hunowai. struck by the voice of the parent-in-law. Advice to a son or daughter before marriage. Respect for the parent-in-law, for the sake of a peaceful and kindly existence, was stressed ; but equally an attitude of unkindness toward any relative by marriage was decried, such as that expressed in the following saying, which was regarded as extremely rude. He pili papakole. A backside relationship. Relative of a relative-in-law and not by blood. A dis respectful term used only in anger. Kane and Wahine. Compact and explicit is the following saying which des cribes the faithfulness, in crises, of man and wife. In travelling, the danger on lonely trails, along shore, or on the rough slopes or in the forested uplands, was the pouncing of the marauder or murderer from behind. Even greater, at night along lonely paths, was the dread of malevolent nature spirits or ghosts that leapt upon the back and strangled the victim. And we must picture also those times known not infrequently when a family was in flight before raiders, overland or by sea, during the wars which were common in this land where fighting for conquest or for vengeance was the preoccupation of chieftains and of their warriors trained in the arts of war. At such times the man, as protector of wife and children, came close behind his loved ones. Ka pili kua; ka pili alo. Close to the back; close to the front. A husband is referred to as pili kua, standing back of his mate as her protector. She is the pili alo, the protected one. Another saying is this of a woman whose husband was gentle :? He kane 'eha 'ole o ka 'ili, A husband that doesn't [even] hurt the skin. Said by an appreciative wife of a husband who never beats her.</page><page sequence="5">The Polynesian Family System in Ka-'u, Hawai'/ 299 ?s with all Polynesians, passionate attachment often became jealous, and from this violence could result. The following somewhat equivocal saying is the expression of a wife whose husband was perhaps too easy-going:? He kaue maikai; na'u ka A good husband ; the doings hana. are mine. A husband who never bothers, leaving me free to do as I please. The lazy and negligent man was unfortunately not un common, and his laziness was recognized as leading to an unthrifty household and uncared-for children, as in this saying:? Hiamoe-wale ke kane, Nana- Sleepy-head is the husband wale ka wahine. and Gaze-about is the wife. When the husband sleeps too much, the wife just looks about her and does nothing. But even negligence seems to have had a limit, for a complaining wife was reminded that even the worst hus bands could be expected to make some provision for their families :? 'Aohe kane hanai nalo. No husband feeds his wife flies. Every husband has some virtues, some more, some less, but none has ever been found that gives his wife nothing but flies to eat. Keiki. To a mother her child is a lovely thing. Ka Opu'u pua i inoliala. A flower bud that unfolded. A baby. Ka lei ha'ule 'ole, he keiki. A lei that is never cast aside is one's child. The carrying of the beloved child?the mother's arms around the child and the child's arms around the mother's neck?evokes the simile of the flower garland, the lei. He hi'i alo. One borne in the arms. A child dearly beloved.</page><page sequence="6">300 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY He hi'ialo, ua milimili ia i ke A beloved one, fondled in the alo, ua ha'awe ia i ke kua, arms, borne on the back, ua lei 'ia i ka 'a-'i. whose arms have gone about the neck as a lei. Said of a beloved, favourite child. Especially treasured was the only child, which seems to have been of sufficiently frequent occurrence to have been coined into these sayings : He hua kahi. A single egg. An only child. Ho'okahi no hua a ka 'a'o. An afo bird lays but a single egg. A mother who has borne an only child. Perhaps the first expression of what the Hawaiians termed 'aloha was between mother and child. Ho'oheno. (An expression.) Caresses such as patting the hand, kissing the ear, and so on. As an adjective it is applied to a demonstrative child. Ho'oalohaloha or ho'aloha- (An expression.) loha. An intense demonstration of affection, perhaps of child for parent. (Not applicable to lovers, for in that case it is ho'oipoipo). Also making oneself loved by doing lovable deeds. When an undemonstrative child suddenly becomes demonstrative, some believed it a sign of impending separation. 'A*a. (An expression.) A demonstration of joy at the sight of a person who is loved. When a child extends his arms eagerly, makes an audible sound of joy or other demonstrations at the sight of a home-coming parent, that is a(a. When any person is so glad to see the other that he can hardly contain himself, this is 'a'a. Ho'opunini. (An expression.) Commonly applied to children or pets. It refers to a child who clings to a person, refusing to go to someone else who tries to take him, holding fast to the person he wants to stay with ; or when left on the floor, the child stays close. A dog going round and round his master, wagging his tail, barking, creating a great fuss and</page><page sequence="7">The Polynesian Family System in a-u, Hawaii 301 refusing to leave: that, too, is ho'opunwi. When fish circle in one spot, never leaving it for long, this term is also applicable. Ho'opunini ka 'ia i ka punawai?The fish gather and remain at the spring. The following is a very wise observation, applied to the rearing of children, showing an appreciation of the life giving power of the sun's rays for healthy golden brown little bodies. O ka moa i hanai ia i ka la, A cock raised in the sun ua 'oi i ka moa i hanai ia i light is stronger than one ka malii. raised in the shade. If you want a strong son, raise him with plenty of sun light. Equally, there was scorn for the parent who neglected the health of a child, as expressed in the following. Hupe kole. Red, runny nose. Often used to small children who do not bother to wipe their noses. " Kamali'i hupe kole "?" Runny nosed kids!" is a common expression. When a tot showed a tendency to hide away, the mother became fearful. Pe'epe'e. Literally " hide-hide." If, for no apparent reason a child sought to hide it might imply impending illness or separation. In the old days, Hawaiian children would not run and pretend to hide from an approaching friend, much less " boo " at him, as they have learned to do nowadays. The following saying shows that the well and happy child is one who is cared for : He keiki mea makua A child who has a parent (or mea kupuna). (or grandparent). Said of a child whose parents, uncles, aunts or grand parents show affection by making beautiful things for his use or composing songs and chants in his honour. It is said in respect and admiration, for, to Hawaiians, it was a great thing to show love for their children.</page><page sequence="8">302 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY A good mother, foster-mother or grandparent who raised a child must see to it that each child had as a dowry its own bed coverlet?in the old days a handsome sheet of kapa, in post-missionary days a hand-quilted coverlet of some favoured design.

There are a number of sayings that characterize the state of infancy and childhood and the relation of the child to elders. Mai ka wa huli Huna ke alo. From the time the face is turned up. From infancy. Ua pau ka 'ino. The filth is ended. In olden days diapers were unknown and the nursing mother was soiled by the baby. This saying refers to a child old enough to go to the toilet. Na la e lana ana ke koko. In the days when the blood circulates freely. The days of youth. Aia i ka mole kamali'i. Still rooted in childhood. Said of one who remains physically or mentally a child.</page><page sequence="9">The Polynesian Family System in a-' , a a/' 303 Hanai. Anyone who knows Hawaiian family life even today has seen many instances in which an adopted child has become as intimately one with the feeding parent (hanai) as a child born to the parent. This is well expressed in the following saying :? He Oha pili wale. A young taro that attaches itself to an older corm. Said of one who attaches himself to another in order to receive care. It is a mistake, however, to think that the desire to adopt children was always motivated by pure altruism :? Hanai kanaka, hiki ke ho'o- Feed human beings for they unauna. can be sent on errands. An adopted child, well cared for, will be a help later on. And there is a saying that expresses disgust with an adopted child that proves itself an ingrate:? Poho i ka malama i ko hai A waste of time to rear the ke'ake'a. result of someone else's semen. Used by foster parents angered by ingratitude and neglect of adopted children not related to them by blood. 'Aloha. The leaven of love makes the joy of gathering together and sharing.

Blood relationship makes for affinity, and this affinity is the cement that makes the members of the 'ohana adhere one to another.</page><page sequence="10">304 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY E kolo ana no ke ewe i ke The rootlets will creep to ewe. ward the rootlets.

Said of one who remains close to a loved one?as a child, perhaps, to his parent or grandparent. The constancy of devotion between 'ohana from infancy to old age is coined compactly into the following sayings :? Aia i hi'ikua, i h?lalo. Is borne on the back ; is borne in the arms. 1. Said of a beloved child carried about on the back and in the arms. 2. When one is gone to a far place where he cannot be seen by those who love him, he is said to be in hi'ikua (borne at the back) and when one is where he can be seen daily, he is in Mialo (borne in the presence). Ola na iwi. The bones live. An expression meaning that there is comfort, content ment and happiness for one. When a child is good, thoughtful and loving, the oldsters of his family say of themselves, " Ola ma iwi." A complimentary saying to a friend who finds contentment with his loved ones or is blessed greatly. Devotion and companionly friendship and hospitality was and is typical of the Hawaiian people, both within and outside the bounds of blood relationship and homeland and race. In Hawaiian lore, as well as in contemporary life, count less instances of devoted and faithful companionship are to be found. Here are a few sayings which convey a sense of the quality of such affection in friendship. Ku'u hoa 'ohumuhumu. The companion I voice my complaints to. An expression of affection for a sympathetic, understand ing and helpful relative or friend to whom one goes with all one's problems.</page><page sequence="11">The Polynesian Family System in Ko'u, Hawa?i 305 Hoa pupu'u o ka po ami. A companion to crouch with on a cold night. A sweetheart, a wife or husband. Anu ko'u ka hale, ua hala ka Cold and damp is the house makamaka. when the friend (or kins man) is gone. Since the earliest days of discovery and white contact, and unchanging even in these times when the Hawaiian people see themselves overwhelmed and outnumbered by other races from West and East, the spirit of 'aloha in the form of hospitality has been and is so spontaneous that it seems innate in the breed. He makamaka, ke pa la That is a friend, for he calls kahea. out an invitation. This pleasant invitation quoted by Dr. . B. Emerson is characteristic (Malo, p. 203) :? E kipa maloko e hanai ai, Come in and have food, Ahewa a'e ka waha. And loosen the tongue. A eia ka uku, ka leo. And the pay?your voice. He ukana na ka wai. A burden for the water. A kindly reassurance to a friend who has, perhaps, acci dentally tracked in mud, or spilled something. " 'A'ohe pilikia." u Never mind, it is only a burden for the water to carry away." Mu ka waha heahea 'ole. Silent is the mouth of the inhospitable one. To call a welcome (heahea) to any one approaching one's home was considered essential to good etiquette. The saying last quoted shows that hospitality was not always wholly spontaneous but was recognized and appreci ated as a human and social virtue. Friendliness and affec tion are a tonic and lubricant which constitutes one of the chief ingredients of the joyous temperament of our Hawaiian people. They keenly sensed the crippling effect of the opposite of 'aloha. Na hana ku i ke 'aloha. Work that fits love. Deeds that express true love.</page><page sequence="12">306 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY Aloha mai no, "aloha aku: When love is given, love 0 ka huhu ka mea e ola 'ole should be returned ; anger ai. is the thing that gives no life. Love begets love ; hatred begets hatred. Greeting. The old Hawaiian mode of greeting was termed honi, and this referred to placing the nostril gently beside that of the person greeted. Kissing the cheek or gently touching lips to lips is recent. However, persons swept by sudden passionate affection are described in legend as " flying upon the neck " (lele 'a ) of the beloved. In ancient Hawaii join ing hands (papa lima or ho'opapa lima) was not a greeting but a token or confirmation of agreement.1 When I2 was a child men, women and children kissed each other, a common greeting for all. To refuse to kiss a kinsman was considered rude (ho'okano). A person who avoided his friends and relatives was ho'okano. A person who was friendly to everyone was said to be H'ike, and such a person was well liked. Old time Hawaiians never " made love " in public, or even in the presence of relatives or friends. Kindly deeds, courtesy and affection in speech and action were all that were needed to show 'aloha. 1 The expression " pa'i a pa'i " for a tie between two contestants in a game came from the way in which they made their agreement before the game was played. The contestants and their supporters discussed the points which would make one of them the winner and also the articles or amount of goods used in a wager between the two parties. Having agreed, one player held out his hand and the other lightly slapped it; then he in turn held out his hand to be slapped. This was called the ho'opapa lima or hand touching. If the contest was a draw and neither player won, the expression " pa'i a pa'i " (slap and slap) was used. They remained equals as they were at the time they made their agreement. So, when two people were equal in skill, they were said to be pa'i a pa'i. But two equally handsome people were said to be " like a like " and never pa'i a pa'% as physical charm was not an acquired skill. The holding of hands was called kuiUma or kuikui lima. When two people walked arm in arm, or hand in hand, this was kuilima. Holding hands in climbing or helping with some work where this was necessary was done in the olden days, but lovers never held hands, walked arm in arm, or kissed as they do today.?M.K.P. 2 Small type is used for lengthy direct quotations. Where not otherwise indicated by specific reference, these quotations are verbatim from Mrs. Pukui's own voluminous notes, published writings or trans lations.</page><page sequence="13">The Polynesian Family System in a-' , a a/ ' 307 There were several forms of greeting between relatives, of which the heahea, the kahea, and the uwe are described below. Heahea (Calling). The heahea was a still common practice in my childhood. Except in remote country places, it is now a thing of the past. It was a custom for an adult member of the family to come to the door, stand there and call a welcome to an approaching person, "Come hither, come" (He mai! Mai! Mai). If the person was an acquaintance, a little more might be said, perhaps, " So it is you! The folks are here at home. Come!" (0 'oe no ka keia. Eia no ka po'e o kauhale nei. Mai!) As soon as he was seated he was asked to have something to eat (E 'a ). If the stranger was hungry, he accepted, but if he was not, he declined. So with a good friend or relative who had come from a distant place, food was prepared as soon as he entered and he was asked to partake of it. If a friend came to one's house and did not see anyone at the door, he would cry out " ". This is a long drawn o-o-h-oh! with a drop of the voice at the end. This would be followed by the call: " Where are the people of the house?" (Auhea kanaka o kauhale nei?) As soon as the was heard, someone would hurry to the door to heahea, to call him to come in. A dearly beloved kinsman or friend was welcomed, not only with the heahea but with a chant of welcome, kahea. For example:? " Come! He mai! You are welcome, o lehua He mai e ku'u pua lehua o ka blossom of mine from the wao&gt; upland forest, A blossom around whom the I pohai Ha e na manu o ukat birds gather; My lehua that bloomed in the Ku'u lehua i mohala ikaua o Ha'ao rain, Ha'ao, Light comes to our house, for Uaao ka hale nei, ua hiki mai you are here. la 'oe. Come! come, we are here." Mai! mai! Eia no makou nei. There was no set chant of welcome ; each person made up his own for the occasion. With favourite children and with chiefs, the heahea was followed by the name-chant (mele inoa) of that individual or of his family. This was to show that that favourite child possessed parent or grandparent to welcome him with this honour (he mea makua or he mea kupuna), or that the 'AWi possessed here a person to serve and love him (he mea kanaka). The purpose of the heahea was to make a person feel welcome. When th? heahea was lacking, a guest felt unwanted and ashamed to come. People would watch the host or hostess</page><page sequence="14">308 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY and whisper to each other, " Oh ! he merely looks and does not heahea" (Auwel o ka nana wale mai no ka ho'i o ka maka, 'a'ohe heahea mai.) A hospitable person was called a kanaka heahea or a wahine heahea. Uwe (Wailing). If the guest was a dear friend or a relative who had been absent a long while, the heahea was followed by an embrace and a loud wail of welcome (uwe). The words of the uwe were spontaneous and not memorized, and they expressed the affection of the host for the returned traveller. Loved ones, home, the hills and the sea, places where they had been together, loved ones who had passed on during his absence might be mentioned. One person might do the wailing while others sat about and wept silently, or one adult followed another in uttering the uwe. Children did not run around and make noise during the uwe but sat quietly near a parent or grandparent. Older ones, able to help with the preparation of food, hurried off to prepare and serve the guest as soon as the uwe was over. The younger ones waited to be called forward to meet the guest. Hawaiian children were quiet at times like this and did not prattle about this and that. When a child saw and recognized an approaching person, he did not dash out to talk to him but hastened to call his parents or grandparents so that one could come and heahea the coming guest. After the uwe, the food would be ready for the guest to eat his fill. In olden times Hawaiians removed their shoes before enter ing the house. They wore sandals made of dried ti leaves, banana or hau bark and other materials. In later times these were replaced by leather shoes or sandals, but the old folk always left them on the porch (lanai) before entering. Home. How home was treasured and craved is made explicit in these sayings depicting the dread of homelessness and the unhappiness of being unwanted. Hana a ka mea kama 'ale What a childless person will hele kuewa i ke alanui. (eventually) do, is to wander about uncared for on the highway. Ma'ewa'ewa i ka hale kule- One receives abuse in a ana 'ale. house without a relative. Pitiful is the lot of one who dwells with those who do not care.</page><page sequence="15">The Polynesian Family System in a- , Hawai'/ 309 The sense of serenity and joy, the charm of familiarity, the happiness of companionship, as the essence of home, are distilled in the following :? He lani i luna, he honua i The sky above and the earth lalo. below. Said to or of a person who has a home of his own. Ua ike no makou i ko m?kon We know our own nooks, po'opo'o. We know all about our own family. I wawa ia ka hale kanaka. Voices are heard around an Nawai e wawa ka hale inhabited house. Who kanaka Ole? hears voices around an uninhabited one? Where people are, life is. Makua. The home was centred in the parent and provider. The makua in the household was (and is) that person who is the responsible "head of the family," to use our English phrase. As such, he or she, irrespective of age or relation ship (it often is a younger member by adoption or marriage) is in truth physically and spiritually the king-post of the house. Pumehana ka hale i ka noho Warm is the house in which ia e ka makua. a parent dwells. Pohaku Kaomi moena. A stone to keep the strips of a newly made mat in place. A person who likes to remain at home. A home body. O ka makua ke ko'o o ka The parent is the support hale e pa'a ai. that holds the household together. Ea pouhana. The main post. Said of a person on whom others depended for leadership, guidance and help, the mainstay of the family or of a group.</page><page sequence="16">310 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY In historic times at least, an industrious and devoted mother or grandmother has so often, single handed, been the support of her home and brood that this social phenomenon has become a recognized institution. Luhi wahine 'ia. Laboured over by a woman. Said of a family reared by a widow or by any woman who, by her own labours, fed and clothed them. It was said in respect and admiration. Inevitably, dependence was a natural consequence of the dependability of the true makua. We find coined in several sayings recognition of the psychological immaturity that may result in the children. No ka 'ike no i ka makua. Because he sees his parent. Meaning that as long as there is a parent there the child feels no need to do anything for himself. (Said of a parent who remarks that his son or daughter will not do a thing for himself.)

Food Production and Preparation. Offshore, reef and along-shore fishing was the function of men, while the collecting of shell-fish, sea urchins, crabs and the like, and sea weed was done by women and children. In planting, men alone planted the noble taro, while women as well as men cultivated the humble sweet potato and yam. Sugar-cane and gourds were cultivated by both men and women. In hard times everyone searched the forest for wild foods but under normal circumstances this mis cellaneous foraging on and beyond the fringes of cultivated land, like the foraging for small marine life, was done by the women and children: men of action and dignity would scarcely " putter about " in this way unless times were hard. Under the old system of kapu, requiring not only that men and women eat separately but that their food be cooked in separate ovens, the Hawaiian kitchen economy was some what complicated and certainly burdensome. It is small wonder that Kaahumanu's abolition of the kapu in 1819 was welcomed by the masses, if for domestic reasons alone. The Ka-'u rules were like those elsewhere. David Malo wrote (Chapter XI, p. 50) :? " The man first started an oven of food for his wife, and, when that was done, he went to the mua and started an oven of food for himself. Then he would return to the house and open his wife's oven, peel the taro, pound and knead it into poi, knead it and put it into the calabash. This ended the food cooking for his wife. Then he would return to the mua, open his own oven, peel the taro, pound and knead it into poi, put the mass into a (separate) calabash for himself and remove the lumps. Thus did he prepare his food ('ai), and thus was he ever compelled to do so long as he and his wife lived." Though the mashing of cooked taro corms to make pot was normally the work of men every woman knew how to do it and would make poi for herself when left alone.</page><page sequence="18">312 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY Certain foods were denied to women by reason of their sex. These particular kapu had nothing to do with prohibi tions relating to guardian spirits ?aumakua), gods (akua) or particular nature spirits, either kupua or 'e'epa, which might have family (or individual) personal psychic relation ship to a woman or women in an Ohana or community. These foods were strictly forbidden to any woman unless it might be a high chief ess under particular circumstances, as when the mother of Kamehameha the Great craved, demanded, and received the eye of a tiger shark when she was pregnant, before giving birth to the great warrior chief and conqueror. To womankind these foods were kapu, for reasons given below :? Pork, because it was feast food for gods, chiefs and priests ; and also related to the god Lono, as Kamapua'a. Bananas, because the banana tree was a body of Kanaloa. Coconuts, because the coconut tree was a body of Ku.

By taking their part in so far as age and skill permitted in the respective activities of the older men and women of their household and of the 'ohana, boys and girls acquired knowledge and skills by natural process, rather than by artificial means as in formal education. Young 'ali'i had guardians or tutors (kahu). In the simpler households, it was the grandparents of the respective sexes who were the tutors of the young, the transmitters of knowledge and lore. Hence arose the intimate sense of attachment between grand parent and grandchild which is recognizable today in the use of the affectionate appelative " tutu " for beloved elder.</page><page sequence="19">The Polynesian Family System in Ka-'u, Hawai i 313 The sharing and divisions of labour in all work (lau lima)?in planting and fishing, in housebuilding and pre paring feasts, in work on the irrigation ditches (auwai), taro terraces (lo'i) and walls (kumma), on ponds (loko) and in rituals, the hula, war?was also a way of education, for every one did his part. What one or another did was partly subject to the direction of the 'AW i and his or her priests and supervisors {konohiki) : but largely it was deter mined, according to status, age and sex, in accordance with traditional custom. Even the children had their duties, according to size. Ka nui e pa'a ai i ka hue wai. The size that enables him to carry a water bottle. About two years old.

In ancient days the age of a child was not reckoned by years as we do today but by his physical ability to do something. A man who planned to build or rethatch a house counted on his 'ohana to lend a hand. His male relatives helped him prepare the foundation, get and prepare the timber and cords, erect the frame and thatch it, while the women-folk aided in collecting p?i grass, pandanus or other leaves for thatching. The making of mats for the floors, the beating of kapa cloth for sheets were the work of women. Men made the wooden vessels used in eating and storing and both men and women worked on gourd containers and the nets used for carrying them. (These were generally acquired by exchange, however.)</page><page sequence="20">314 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY KUPUNA.

The mother is no longer bearing, but her children are. The Kapu in the Family. In the matter of clothing, a general rule was that it was not right to wear clothing of anyone other than kin. But as between generations there were strict rules affecting this. A daughter's clothes might be worn by the mother, but not the mother's by the daughter, and the same rule applied as between aunts and nieces. The same kapu prevailed on the male side as between the generations. As affecting the sexes, there should be no sharing or exchange of clothing. All these kapu affected also adoptive (ho'okama) and fostering (hanai) relationship. In some parts of Hawaii it was not good form for mother and daughter to wear at the same time clothing printed with the same design. This " trying to look the same" (ho'ohalikelike), involving the daughter's wearing the same design, was analogous to her wearing her mother's dress, which was forbidden. The following are remembered as specific rules learned in childhood, relative to personal kapu typical of Ka-'u. They were observed with particular fidelity by those of 'ali'i or kahuna status. A very near kinsman was indicated if a man said, " My malo he may gird about his loins " (No'u ka malo, nano, e hume) ; or a woman said, " My skirt she may gird about her hips " (No'u ka pa'u, nana e kakua). Relationship by marriage, even the sealing of the union of two families by the birth of an heir (puka-a-maka), did not affect the clothing kapu. Marriage in other words was equivalent to the blood tie. Contestants in games sometimes, however, exchanged loin cloths. If the contest had demonstrated equality in skill, and each admired the other, such exchange indicated that they had accepted each other as brothers. When any suggestion was made of another's wearing a malo other than that of his close 'ohana, the answer was " The skin is different " (A'ole i like ka 'ili). It was kapu to use a sleeping</page><page sequence="23">The Polynesian Family System in a-'u, Hawai'/ 317 mat for anything but sleeping upon ; or a head pillow as a foot rest or to sit upon, or a seat cushion for the head to lie on ; or to sit above anything containing food. It was kapu to use a mat one had sat upon over the food in the imu; so to preserve that kapu intact, the kauewe (imu mat) was hung up where no one would be likely to step over it (a'e). During retirement in the hale pe'a, the menstruating woman used only her own worn-out skirts for pads. Cloth ing worn around the hips only, could be used for such pads but not those worn above the waist. Every girl or woman saved only her own old clothing for her period of retirement and never anyone else's, not even her husband's cast-off maio nor her sister's old pau. Thus the daughters of the kahuna and the 'ali'i upheld the personal kapu. The old time Hawaiians used to talk often, when I was a small child, of the terrible custom the Whites had of using a sheet sometimes to lie upon and sometimes to lie under?they (the Whites) did not seem to know that what belonged above (ma luna) should remain above and what belonged below (ma lalo) should stay below. There were in my time people who did use floor mats and bed kapas for imu covers, but generally this was not done, unless by very careless families; in the olden times, never. In a hula school conducted by my cousin Ilala-ole-o-Ka'ahu manu, one of the pupils thoughtlessly draped her skirt over her shoulder. The hula master spoke sharply to her, saying, " What belongs above should stay above, and what belongs below should stay below." (Ko luna, no luna no ia; ko Iah no lalo no ia.) One must never ask for a lei which another person was wearing. It was proper, however, if one were wearing a lei, to take it off one's self to garland a near relative or someone held in esteem But a lei carelessly given, or left about after being worn, might fall into the hands of a sorcerer, and could result in ulc?rations on the neck of the original wearer. Old, worn out clothing was disposed of by burying so that the kapu concerning their use might not accidentally be broken. Many a time I have seen my people soak old clothes in water that they might rot the faster after being put into the ground. Obligation. In the extended family there should be giving and taking freely, without stint. But the selfish individual may pervert this good way of life by insistant demands.</page><page sequence="24">318 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY 'Ike aku, 'ike mai: kohua Recognize and be recog aku, kohua mai; pela iho nised ; help and be helped ; la ka nohona Ohana. such is family life.

Yet even evil speech towards a relative would be punished. Make no o Pamano i ka 'i'o It was a near relative who pono'i. destroyed Pamano. Pamano was a hero of an old legend, who met his death through his uncle, Wai-pu. The saying is used when a relative brings trouble. Ka'i ka waha. Smites his mouth. Having gossiped unkindly a person finds what he said happening to himself ; as when a woman who gossips about her neighbour's daughter finds her own doing the same thing. Offense and Forgiveness. Hala is a wrong committed by or against one, and a hala is a binding thing, holding the wrong-doer to the person against whom the wrong was done. One is bound by the fault he had committed, the other by holding the cord, if it may be called that, to the wrong doer. One is the debtor, the other, the person indebted to. The hala is the debt that lies between them. If the one who holds the invisible cord does not wish to relax it but continues to bear the wrong in mind, he is said to ho'omau hala; continue the fault. This continuation makes him feel unhappy and dissatisfied ; he is ho'ohalahala, literally " to make fault a fault." The Hawaiian word " to forgive ' 'is kala, that is, to undo, untie, unbind and set free. By kala the person to whom the wrong doer is indebted frees him of that debt. It isn't there any more. The Hawaiians use the expression, " Unbound from the top of the head to the soles of the feet and throughout the four corners of the body." (E kala ia mai ka piko o ke po'o a ka manea o ka waewae; a la'a ma na kihi eha o kona kino.) The " four corners " are the two shoulders and two hips of the torso.</page><page sequence="26">320 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY The kala works both ways, freeing forgiver and forgiven from the hala. I have heard this said in many a ho'oponopono (set to rights) ceremony: "I unbind you from the fault and thus may I also be unbound from it." (Ke kala aku nei 'au ia 'oe a pela noho'i au e kalaia mai ai.) Huikala (all together freeing) is to take all and every fault, remembered and forgotten, secret or open, and com bine them (hui) into one. Then with the kala, all faults, big and little are entirely done away with. The kala required prayer and ritualistic acts of various sorts, according to circumstances, often involving the sym bolic use of the kala seaweed (Sargassum). Politeness and Hospitality. It was polite to greet any person one met on the road, acquaintance or not. If a man in a nearby food-patch saw a stranger going by, he might call out, " Aloha e ka maUhini." The stranger returned the greeting, after which the native would say, " Let us go home to have something to eat!" (E hoi kakou i kauhale e 'ai ai!") If he was not hungry, he declined the invitation, but if he was, he accepted. Then the two talked as they walked to the native's house. He learned where the stranger had come from by the politely indirect : " You must have come a long way in this warm sun." " Yes, I have. It has taken me two days' walk from my home in Kahalu'u." As they neared the house, seeing his wife busy at some household task, the native called to her and said, " I have a guest." (He malihini ka'u.) Looking up, she hurried to the door and called : " Come ! Come ! Come inside here." (Mai! Mai! Komo mai maloko nei.) Then, "Sit down and rest till your weariness is gone from you, then have something to eat." (E noho iho a ku'u ka luhi, hele e 'ai.) In the meantime food was being prepared in the eating house and the guest was taken there to eat. The polite way of asking one to eat was to say " E 'ai!" in an urgent and sincere tone. It was not polite to say, " Hungry? Perhaps you will like something to eat?" (Pololif ea? E 'ai paha?") This was embarrassing to the guest and sounded reluctant on the host's part. " Yours is the house " (Nou ka hale) was a courteous way of telling the guest that he was very welcome. " Do not be bashful." (Mai ho'ohilahila.) When the guest was ready to leave he said to his host, " I am going." (E hele ana au.) Then the host was expected to reply, " You may go." (O hele.) If two or more people were departing, he would say, " E uhaele " instead of " Ohele." Once a foreigner complained that a guest kept telling him that he was going but made no move to do so. Later he learned</page><page sequence="27">The Polynesian Family System in Ka-u, Hawaii 321 that the man was too polite to do so without his host's per mission. Yet the foreigner was too polite to say the " Depart, then," for which his guest was waiting! Once a person had started out, it was an annoyance to him to call him back (kahea kua). He would give up his plan of going, for it was a sign of bad luck to be called back. There was beach ettiquette, too. When one went to talk to a fisherman and found him sitting on the sand, picking the trash out of his net, then the polite thing to do was to sit down and help him as they conversed. It was bad manners, because bad luck, to take bananas or hala to a fishing place. It was equally impolite to cross hands behind one's back, step over the net or ropes, break wind, wear anything red, or ask the fisherman about his plans for the next fishing trip. There is still need to guard the tongue in those respects with the few oldsters that remain. What may be an innocent remark to a modern person may be an offense to an old timer. In admiring a pretty object belonging to a friend, one should only point out its fine features but should never say, " I wish I had one like that." Such a remark was called ho'omaoe (a hint for) and politeness required that the owner give it to the rude admirer. A friend or relative should never say " What a pretty child you have." Instead, one should say, "A homely child!" When gently spoken, this was a compliment; when harshly said it was not. One never spoke of the amount of food a person ate, only that he had a wonderful appetite: " How he relishes his food!" (Ono kana 'ai!) Past favours should never be recalled and told, such as, " I was the one who helped her by doing this, that or the next thing." This was called helu or counting Sometimes the person so offended would return every gift given to her and would replace others she had used. A person, skilled in humorous expressions and witty remarks ('olelo ho'oka'an), in the use of figurative speech and in making similes ('olelo ho'opilipili), was always well liked. How I remember listening to the Hawaiians of my childhood! Skilled were they in using the 'olelo ho'opilipili to make their con versation or their sermon interesting and comprehensive. Such choice of words ! Poetic and beautiful and never offensive?even when directed at a person's faults. The point of the dart was so well wrapped in the velvet of fine speech that it left not even a tiny prick. Instead it created a feeling of pleasure and a desire to do better. In the olden days, a wit, who had humour and wisdom, found his way to the court of the chief. Hospitality was typical of all Hawaiians on all of the islands. My own parents, our relatives, friends and associates were always glad to share whatever they had, be it little or large. The best sleeping place, was for the guest. People going from Ka'-u to Hilo, and from Hilo to Ka'-u, in the days of the horse</page><page sequence="28">322 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY drawn vehicle, often stopped at my aunt's to pass the night? usually unexpected. There was no market at Glenwood and whatever of fish and meat there was, was salted. Back of the house was a wide field of taro, in the bins were rice and flour, so there was actually no lack, but sometimes visitors might come when the poi was low and after night had descended The family gave the poi to the guests, and the best salted meat, even if it was the last; for the guests were always very welcome even if unexpected and the time most inconvenient to have them! I still remember the running around and the hustling to prepare sleeping places for them and then retiring, tired, to sleep on the floor with other members of the family. No matter what, there wa* no complaining, no grumbling. Cowboys came too, tired and hungry, to share the salted fish, or meat with poi. Sometimes, they came with a portion of a wild bullock or pig?then there was fresh meat But only for that meal : the rest had to be salted for preservation, to be eaten later with vegetables. Admonitions. Admonitions relating to manners and behaviour are sometimes direct and sometimes, to the non-Polynesian, oblique. Ho'oke a maka. Deny the eyes. One who looks toward no one else ; a selfish person who gave to his own children and refused to share with those of his relatives and neighbours. Keke. Literally, " the teeth are ex posed." A sharp admonition to a girl. A girl so warned will not sit so that she exposes herself. " Keke !" A small girl, hearing it, pulls down her skirt or changes her sitting position. Piapia. (A common expression.) Maka piapia means that one's eyes are so thick with mattery substance that he cannot see well; a very rude expression. Misbehaviour, even in the little child, will bring bitter ness to the parent or elder. Li'ili'i kamali'i, 'awahia ke Though the child is small, au. the gall is bitter. Said of a rude, impudent child.</page><page sequence="29">The Polynesian Family System in Ka-'u, Hawaii 323 Mentioning the shortcomings of an 'ohcma, and tall talk, and reckless speech, all are bad manners. Holehole iwi. To strip the bones of flesh. To speak disparagingly of one's relatives. Ho'onuiitui. Make big-big. The dire threat of a husband, wife or parent which is used only to frighten, but never carried out. Bad Manners and Inhospitality. Politeness and good manners were carefully, even severely taught, but as in all civilizations there were the impolite and the ill-mannered, and special types of rudeness in all grades of society. These were recognized and so labelled. It showed a lack of good manners to stand talking to a person with hands on hips This posture, hi 'aha'aha, signified a sense of superiority. It was rude to stand with hands crossed behind the back (ope*a kua), for this was a sign that the person who did so wished a load of trouble to descend upon the back of the beholder. It was bad manners for a visitor to stand in the doorway (ku i ka puka) of a house While waiting to enter or to depart he stood a little to one side. The doorway was never obstructed for any length of time. Nor was it proper for members of the household, or outsiders, to sit in the doorway (noho i ka puka). That was an obstruction, hence an annoyance to the family 'aumakua (ancestral spirits) who might want to go in and out freely. To break wind (puhi'u) in the presence of anyone was not only bad manners but insulting. If one did so accidentally, he apologised immediately To break wind while someone was eating, working with his fishing gear, discussing business or praying was the height of rudeness. He guarded against giving offense to others through carelessness in speech. He was not bluntly outspoken (koOpaka ku) nor did he make rude remarks (kikoi). Sometimes an action or remark that a foreigner did not con sider rude was very much so to a Hawaiian; as for instance a teacher's playfully pulling a child's hair, or (as a matter of discipline) threatening to slap her face. Because the head was regarded as sacred, this threat could cause instant rebellion from otherwise mild-mannered Hawaiian children, who felt the sting of unbearable insult in the threat. To compare human beings to animals was also insulting. I</page><page sequence="30">324 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY have not forgotten how angry my aunt Kamakolu was when her son was called "a wild goat of Puna" (ke kao ahiu o Puna). Another form of rudeness in speech was kiko'ola (literally, reaching for the sun) : speaking to another in a manner to imply that one regarded himself as superior. A third form of rudeness in speech was to break the peace of the moment with a loud and nasty remark, termed kikaho. It was like dropping a rock in a quiet pool. Hawaiians did not take the names of their gods in vain, but they were experts in using insulting language, both figurative and direct. No part of the human body was spared in the kuamuamu. To call a person " shrimp-headed " (po'oOpae) was kuamuamu. (The eliminative organs of the shrimp are in its head, and so a remark like this meant that one's head contained only excreta.) The word pilau is very freely used today, but in olden times Hawaiians were taught never to call anyone that. Pilau is a stench like that of a decomposed body. Another humiliating word carelessly used today is kauw?, " outcaste " (see the section on kauw?). The term kauw? applied to one who was not of kauw? ancestry was an insult that was bitterly resented. A person who liked to hurt another by prodding his feelings (pahupahu, jabbing) was generally avoided. For example: " So you had to go to So-and-So's home?Well, who do you think you are to expect welcome there?" Lawe Ohio and holoholo 'olelo are practically the same thing: to bear tales from person to person, which often resulted in fights (ku kau hakaka). Such a person was certainly un popular. There were some people who liked to have a reckoning (ho'oku'i) when they heard anything said about them that was not to their liking. Such a one would hurry to seek the person who was believed to have made the remark and ask him why he said such things, and so forth. My wise old grandmother used to say to her children: " Let the matter go; we shall see in time what it is all about." (Ho'oku'u aku, na ke au e nana.) The ho'ona'aikola or ho'aikola was behaviour that expressed one's contempt for another and it could take several forms. One was the ho'opohopoho, or bending over with the rump towards another, a sign of defiance and contempt. Another was the ho'opu'ukahua, a thrusting of the thumb between the index and middle finger, also as a sign of contempt. It signified the female genitalia. Sometimes the hand was thrust forward with the words "Eia kau This is what you'll get!"?that is, mis fortune. Sometimes a similar gesture was made toward the face and the eyelid drawn down (ho'ohelei). As it was a sign of bad luck to meet a person with eyelids drawn down (maka helei), this was equivalent to wishing one bad luck. A person, blessed with a sense of humour, would merely cry out in amuse ment, "A 'ula!" (Ah! a red one!) at such bad manners, but others would feel insulted.</page><page sequence="31">The Polynesian Family System in Ka-'u, Hawai'/ 325 To double the fist and raise it with a quick bend of the elbowr (ho'opanau) was the male sex sign, equivalent in significance to the female sign mentioned above, and with the same contemptu ous meaning. To spit (kuha) resoundingly at or to one side of a person was a gesture of utmost contempt. To thrust out the tongue (ho*opake4o) or to "make faces" (haikaika) meant con tempt and defiance. Among friends the protruding tongue meant not defiance but an impudent " I don't care!" And, when certain persons were mentioned, a swaying of the chin and a twist of the mouth meant, "I certainly care nothing for those people!" A quick wrinkling of the nose meant " no," the quick elevating of the eyebrows " yes " ; and a quick lift of the chin was a question: "What did you say?" With a slight inclination of the head toward a third person it meant " Who is he?" Any of these gestures of contempt might be sufficient cause for an offended person to consult a sorcerer by way of revenge, so children were taught that such behaviour was rude, offensive and might bring serious consequences, even death. Treating a parent, a relative or friend with utter disregard for their feelings was also termed ho'ona'aikola. To fail to heed the teachings of parents and grandparents and to be wilful and headstrong, was called ho'ok?eki'e, to elevate one's elf above others. To break into or interrupt a conversation was called kaha maha (literally?to thrust in the temples) and children were taught that this was a rude thing to do. Likewise to behave in a bold manner toward strangers, asking for things, going through the premises of others without permission, claiming something that is not one's own?all such behaviour was called maha'oi (literally, temples thrust forward). It was also rude to ask too many questions (niele). Instead, one should observe what was being done and how, and if there were things he did not understand, then he might ask. Claiming relationship to the 'al?i or trying to be the equal of one's superiors was to be pi'ikoi (straining to ascend) and a person who did this was regarded with scorn. Hukiku means to pull against the others, to be contrary and want one's own way instead of co-operating with them. When this unmannerly attitude becomes contentious, then it is huki huki, to keep pulling in the opposite direction. When members of a family disagree with each other over a piece of property, each one desiring to have his way, that is hukihuki. A child over which various members of the family would dispute (hukihuki) as to who would have the right to rear it, would sicken and die unless the dispute was quickly brought to an end. A person is termed paiveo when he pretends not to see an acquaintance approaching and looks or walks in the opposite direction to avoid speaking to him. It was regarded as equally rude to walk up to an aquaintance and say " Oh what a pretty lei. Give it to me." That is noi ku, to ask point blank, indulged in only by the very ill-mannered.</page><page sequence="32">326 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY Old fashioned courtesy demanded that we do not ask, " Give me this " or " Give me that." If one had need, let him say, " Have you such and such to spare? If you do, I would like to have some." Then at a later date, bring to the donor something that he may not have. When one had been given a gift of something in a bowl or dish, the container was kept for a few days at least, then filled with something and returned. To return something in the con tainer immediately after receiving a gift in it, savoured of trade or ku'ai. This trading back and forth at once was called ku'aku'ai. It spoiled the pleasure of the first giver, therefore it was not polite. The kuhilani was also impolite, that is, to say to others, " Do this for me " or " Go and fetch that." Literally, the word kuhi meaning to point and lani meaning a chief, the expression means to give orders like a chief. Inhospitality was so rare that a case would be discussed with horror for years. Nevertheless, there were of course some who were stingy and avaricious. Here are several stories showing how such folks were treated. A story is still told in Puna of some stingy natives who were peeling cooked breadfruit when a missionary with his native helpers who had walked a long distance and were tired and hungry came along and asked if they might have some to eat. " Oh no," said the natives, " we have only enough for ourselves and the pigs." Soon after that the people of this village took sick with a strange malady resembling leprosy. Those who died first were buried, but those who died later were left unburied. The hungry pigs came in and ate some of them. " Thus," the story was told, " they were saving for the pigs!" Being so seldom met with, when a case of inhospitality was found, it was noised abroad and discussed with derision. A victim of any meanness practised often paid back in the same coin, as in the following story, long told with satis faction. A Hilo man went on a visit to Puna and expressed a desire for coconuts. " Come to my place," said a Puna man and I'll give you all you want." When they reached his place, the Puna man pointed to some very tall coconut trees and said, " There they are, help yourself." The Hilo man was unable to climb and so he went without the nuts. A few years later the Puna man needed a canoe and inquired where he could find one and was told that the Hilo man was the best canoe maker there. His request was kindly heard by the Hilo man, who took him to the upland</page><page sequence="33">The Polynesian Family System in a- , Hawai'i 327 where the logs were already cut but not yet dubbed out into canoes. " There you are," said the Hilo man pointing to the logs, " take your pick of the canoes." I remember a case in my childhood of a man in Ola'a noted for inhospitality who refused lodging to a traveller one dark and rainy night, only to discover him the next day, at a neighbour's along with several pack-mules loaded with bundles of sea food and dried goat's meat. The neighbour's wife was cooking goat meat and on the table were some fish, all from the stranger. " Woe is me," the Ola'a man exclaimed aloud. And then to the stranger : " As you are not going home today, come up and stay with us for the night!" But the stranger refused to accept. Manners in Eating. Haw?iians ate when hungry. The one cooked meal a day was eaten before sundown lest hungry ghosts be attracted. Hands were rinsed in the washbowl (po'i wai holoi), or when water was scarce, as often in Ka-'u, they were wiped on wet ferns or leaves. A long, narrow mat (pa kaukau) laid on the floor with food set in readiness for eating was the papa 'aina (a term later applied to the dining table). A poi bowl was set between each two persons facing each other, and a meat dish between each two persons sit ting side by side. Favourite children and kapu 'ali'i had their private dishes. Men sometimes dipped poi with one finger. Generally two fingers were used, dipped to the first joints only when eating daintily, to the second joint for the hearty appetite. A deft twist (awili) on the way to the mouth gracefully retained the semi liquid paste on the fingers. " One finger, two fingers and three finger poi is a modern notion. Dipping with one finger used to be regarded as a sign of stinginess (pi) ; and eating with three fingers was greedy. The old hand-pounded poi was uniform in consistency, not pasty or liquid as mechanically milled or watery poi may be today. To be finicky in picking from the meat dish was termed kama lani (behaving like an 'ali'?s child). It was proper to eat what came to hand, and to consume all of it. Smacking the lips (muka) to show appreciation was good manners. To sit cross legged was approved ; but for women and girls to sit with knees together and to one side was preferable. Host or hostess should continue eating till the guests were satisfied; and never should the pof clinging round the sides of the bowl be scraped down (kahi), a sign of intended</page><page sequence="34">328 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY removal, while a guest was still eating. " Eat your fill !" ('Ai, 'ai maona) ; " Do not be bashful, the food is yours!" (" Mai ho'ohilahila, nan ka 'a ") were generous expressions of hospitality.1 We come now to a convention in the old Hawaiian household in relation to eating which shows the reverence that was felt for the Provider of the staff of life. In a very real sense, the bowl or bowls of poi round which family and guests were gathered on ordinary or festive occasions, was to the Hawaiian household what to the Greek and Roman family the hearth represented. It was from the first-born child of Heaven and Earth that all taros descended. In remembrance of this, all taro, poi, and the bowl of poi were reverenced. The ancestor of the chiefs and the people was Haloa. This Haloa was the son of Wakea by his daughter Ho'o-hoku-ka-lani. But this Haloa was the second-born: the first-born was Haloa naka-lau-kapalili (Long stem-shaky-leaf -trembling), which came forth a shapeless mass, but when buried close to the wall of Wakea's house grew into the first taro. Haloa was named in honour of this elder brother. This explains why, when the poi bowl was open, there must be no haggling, quarrelling, arguing, for this was displeasing to Haloa. Eating around the pot bowl was the time for pleasant ness and heartiness. Nor should any serious business be dis cussed until the poi bowls were covered. " Haloa will nullify it." (Ke Mole mai nei o Haloa) was the warning that would be voiced by an elder if some child mentioned any work or under takings while the family was gathered round the poi bowl. Wisdom. A very great number of the deft sayings of Hawaiians express the age-old folk wisdom of this people. We have selected a few that seem to relate particularly to family relationship and social ethics. The wisdom of turning an attentive ear to one's elders is the theme of the following. 1 In the above commentary I wish to acknowledge having briefed, with her permission, some detailed notes made by Miss Margaret Titcomb in conversation with Mrs. Pukui about old Hawaiian " table manners."?E.S.C.H.</page><page sequence="35">The Polynesian Family System in Ka-'u, Hawaii 329 Mai kapae i ke a'o a ka makua, aia he ala malaila.

Haloa will nullify it. Said of business discussed over the poi bowl. Status and Prestige. Hawaiians of the old order had a strong sense of status, but likewise a very definite sense of modesty with respect to it, and of contempt for those who made unwarranted pretensions. Mai kaula'i na iwi o kupuna Do not put the bones of i ka la. your ancestors out in the sun to dry.

Said of one who claims a very questionable relationship.</page><page sequence="37">The Polynesian Family System in a-u, Hawaii 331 Keiki a ka pueo. Child of an owl. The child begotten on the wayside, whose paternal lineage is unknown to the mother. Socially, political and ceremonial status and prestige were theoretically determined by genealogy. The 'ohana of a particular lineage depended on an elder* who was known as the Mea-pa'ctrku'aukau ( Person-firm-in-knowledge-of genealogical-history) ; or, briefly, this person was the Ku'auhau. The last word refers to genealogy and pedigree in the context of history : The knowledge of the names of ancestors as such was not enough: the family genealogist must be also an historian, whose knowledge of facts (tradi tional and mythical) relating to the forbears was " firm " (pa'a), i.e., accurate, sound. This was no casual matter. Error in craftsmanship or ritual was inacceptable to the vigorous, hard thinking Hawaiians. The canoeman's and fisherman's very life, as well as his livelihood, depended upon accuracy and soundness of tested materials and techniques. The same accuracy was required in the all important science of oral verbal documentation of pedigrees which comprised the basis of legal, social, political and ceremonial status, prestige, rights and obligations. Possibly one reason the Polynesians relied entirely on accuracy of memory rather than upon any of the various mnemonic devices they used occasionally for other purposes was because it was safer to have the ku'auhau in the private and secret repository of a trustworthy elder's mind than to record it by means of some simple mnemonic or graphical device, which would lay it open to inaccuracy and possibly to misappropriation. The ku'auhau for persons of rank was the most precious of all heritages, requiring as careful guarding as the bones of the dead, for the names and the bones had a related, and equal, intimate relationship to the 'uhane of the individuals who were forbears. Genealogies. True to old Polynesian folkways, Hawaiians in Ka-'u who had any claim to distinction memorized and passed on to their following generations their genealogies, and these had a very important function in the determination of precedence and right. With the 'ali'i class, genealogy was, in fact, a carefully and critically guarded historical science: order</page><page sequence="38">332 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY and right in the matter of succession, formal marriage of aristocrats, and claims to relationship with the high-born had to be proven genealogically. Such matters were authori tatively and legally determined in the 'Aha 'AWi (councils of 'Ali'i) subject to judgment of the experts in genealogy (po'e ki?auhau) of the lines involved. The matter of pre cedence, that is say, whether an individual belonging to kaikua'ana (elder) or kaikaina (younger) lines, was of course registered in the genealogies. Mo'o or kuamo'o means succession, mo'okupuna the succession of ancestors, and mo'oku'auhau the story or tell ing of genealogy. Ku'auhau, as we have said above, was also the term for one skilled in genealogy and traditional history. Hanwwria or " Birthings " means a generation. The imagery of mo'o (lizard, with vertebrae visible) and kua mo'o (verte brate backbone) is apt and obvious as a simile for sequence of descendants in contiguous unbroken articulation. The mele ko'i honua (adzed earth chant) was one in whose verses were woven genealogy, place names and history. Such " earth-wrought " chants, composed only for the high-born, were tokens of rank and prestige. They had ritualistic and magical potency, were imbued with mama (spiritual power). There are interesting sections in Malo indicative of the place of genealogy in the polity of the 'ali'i. The Hale Naua1 was a house built on occasion by a ruling 'Ali'i, where his family experts in genealogy tested the claims of persons who claimed to be kin of the 'Ali'i, in accordance with a formal mode of challenge and examination. The institution and its functioning are described in some detail by Malo and Emer son (pp. 253 ff.). What is here described by David Malo, a native of Kona, was true for the neighbouring moku of Ka-'u. A number of the words that were used with reference to family reveal the conception of human propagation and the growth of the generations as similar to that of the plant world. The Hawaiians in many instances thought of plant forms in anthropomorphic terms : yet their imagery shows 1 We refer here to the old purely native Hale Naua, not to that instituted by King Kalakaua in Honolulu in the late nineteenth century which combined ceremonial akin to Masonic lodge ritual with elements and conceptions of the old.</page><page sequence="39">The Polynesian Family System in a-' , Hawai'/ 333 us that they thought too, of human kind figuratively as botanomorphic. Oha means specifically the sucker or shoot growing from the corm of the taro plant: the family as a group was termed 'oha-na, which literally means " all the offshoots/' Pulapula, which was applied to human offspring or descendants, literally means offshoots of a plant. Kupuna, or ancestor, is probably the substantive, formed by the suffix na, affixed to the root kupu, to gvow. Laupa'i, which means specifically the first leaves put forth by the newly planted taro, is used figuratively to describe a family that is growing, producing many children. A person who had no grand children of his own and who is in danger of having no descendants was lala make, &amp; " dead branch." One with living descendants was a " living branch " (Ma ola). Keli'ihue, when she was an old lady, came to her niece's home one day with her great grandson, Likeke, and said, " E Pa'ahana, he loia ola 'au, he lala make 4oe " (Pa'ahana, I am a living branch and you are a dead one). Pa'ahana had no grandchildren then. But a year later, Pa'ahana held out her new born grand daughter to Keli'ihue and said, " Eia 'au la! He lala ola, 'a*ole 'au he lala make " (Here I am now, a living branch, not a dead one). Sayings of the 'Ali'i. We are including these following sayings relating to the 'ali'i because the Paramount Chief ('Ali'i Nui) fulfilled the role of father to this people. All the people of Ka-'u felt their blood kinship to him and to his relatives, who were the aristocracy of senior and junior lines : in other words, the relationship of commoners to chiefs was but an extension of the social custom based upon 'ohana folkways. Also numer ous sayings reflect what was proper behaviour for persons of 'oli'i descent, as members of that 'ohana whieh ranked at the top of the social order by reason of primacy in genealogical prestige. Status. As the first-born in the line from the gods, the person of the 'oli'i was as sacred as that of a god. The paramount chief was not regal, he was divine ; and he was supreme.</page><page sequence="40">334 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY Kuneki na ku'auhau li'ili'i, oho mai i lalo; ho'okahi no o ko ke 'ali'i ke pi'i i ka . Set aside the lesser genea logies and remain humble ; let only one be elevated, that of the chief. Said to members of the junior line of chiefs: Boast not of your lineage but elevate that of your chief. The scion of the royal house was the most precious of all children to all the people. He liko 'ali'i. A royal leaf bud. A child of a chief. The high ranking female 'ali'i was too sacred to rear her infant. He 'uha kapu. A sacred lap. Said of a person whose kapu forbade the carrying of babies lest the lap be wet by them. Such a kapu woman was often unable to rear the children she bore. Such children were usually adopted and reared by others. The concomitant of the sacredness of the chief was his power. He mano holo 'aina ke 'alii. A chief is a shark that travels on land. Like a shark, a chief is not to be tampered with. Those related to the chief did not boast of it abroad, though they served in his household; nor did those of aristocratic ancestry speak of their pedigree unless they were insulted or challenged. Maloko o ka hale, ho'opuka Inside the house, the rela ia ka pili, a mawaho o ka tionship may be men hale he haku ia. tioned but outside your chief is your lord. Those who served inside a chief's home were usually blood relatives of a junior line; they were taught from childhood not to discuss the relationship and always to address him as " ku'u haku" (my lord), ku'u (ali'i (my chief) or ku'u lani (my heavenly one), and not by any relationship term.</page><page sequence="41">The Polynesian Family System in Ka-'u, Hawaii 335 Aia a paiia ka maka, hai Only when your face is ia kupuna nana oe. slapped do you tell who your ancestors were. Never boast. Only when slandered or called a worthless offspring of worthless ancestors may one mention one's lineage to prove that the slander is baseless. Proud and zealous were those relatives of the 'Ali'i who were of his entourage. O ka ilio kahu no ka ilio hae. A dog who has a master is the dog who barks most. Said of a chief's servant who resents any disparaging remarks concerning his lord. Ho'okahi mea mana'o nui a There is one thing all ka 'ohua o ka hale, o kahi members of the household mea mai ka lima mai o ke look to : whatever they 'alii, are given by the hands of the chief. All members of a chief's household are dependant on him. Ke kaena a ka noho hale. The boast of the stay-at home. The boast of the people for their own local chiefs and home land. Pono. Certain sayings point out the fact that good comes neither to the chief nor to his people out of weakness on the part of the 'Ali'i. Uprightness (pono) must be the forma tion of good rule. 'A'ohe e nalo ka iwi o ke The bones of an evil chief 'alii ino, o ko ke 'alii will not be concealed but maikai ke nalo. the bones of a good chief will. The people will not care for a bad chief who does not care for their welfare and, if he dies, will not take too much trouble to hide his bones. It is the good chief that the people will faithfully serve.</page><page sequence="42">336 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY 'A'ohe alo o ka 'a?na ? ke The land can not live under 'ali'i haipule Ole. an irreligious chief.

Advice to a chief to take care of his lesser chiefs and commoners alike, for together they are the strength of his rule. E 'opu 'ali'i. Have the stomach of a chief.

Next in honour to the 'oli'i and the priestly orders of Ku and Lono (whose pedigrees ranked second to the high chief's) were the able warriors who had won fame in war like games and the favourite sport of the 'ali'i, the game of war. These heroes, whose name, koa, is taken from the magnificent hardwood forest tree (Acacia koa), sometimes called Hawaiian mahogany, were revered by the people because they were the defenders of the homeland and the valiant guard of the beloved 'Ali'i. Their prowess gained for their families fame and wealth in lands and gifts and, in conquest, loot. He maka lehua no kona one One who has the face of a hanau. warrior for his birthplace. Said of a person who wins honour and praise for his homeland. Ke kaulana pa'a 'aina o ke The famed land holders of 'alii. the chiefs. The best warriors received the best land grants. Ike no ke 'alii i kona The chief recognizes his kanaka, a 'ike no ke man and the man recog kanaka i kona 'ali'i. nizes his chief. At the other extreme of the social order were the des pised kauiv?, who were outcasts compelled to live in a barren locality apart from the tribesmen or people " belonging to the land " (morkaSaina-na), and whose only function and destiny was to serve as human sacrifices to the 'Ali'i's war god Ku when a Luakini or war temple was dedicated in anticipation of a season of fighting. Not so despised but held in contempt were worthless fellows referred to in the following saying : He 'unu pehi 'iole. A pebble to pelt a rat with. An insignificant person, worth no more than a pebble. Such ne'erdowells sometimes made a great fuss about pretended prowess and status : He kohu puahiohio i ka Like a whirlwind, whirling ho'olele i ka lepo i luna. the dust upward. Said of a commoner who makes an attempt to elevate him self so that he would be regarded as of chiefly blood.</page><page sequence="44">338 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY There were various sayings which aptly described the humble place of the hard working farmers and fishers who were serfs of .their overlords and yet were proud to belong to their chief and their homeland. He ma'ona 'ai a he ma'ona The commoner is satisfied i'a ko ka noanoa. with fish and food. The commoner has no greater ambition than success in fishing and farming. It is the chief who plans the wars. 'A'ohe nana i ko lalo 'ai i Never mind if the taro at ka papa'a, nana i ko luna the bottom burns, but 'ai i ka 'ahulu. watch out that that at the top is not under-cooked. It matters little what happens to commoners: look out for the welfare of the chiefs. The wise chief well knew, and the people knew, that it was these humble folk upon whom the 'AM'i and his en tourage depended : I lele no ka lupe i ke pola. It is the tail that makes the kite fly. It is the number of followers that raises the prestige of a chief. He mai'a ua pa'a i ke ko'o. A banana tree well sup ported by props. A man well supported by his followers. These had their recognition and reward on occasion at the home and at the hands of their 'AWi : He pololi kali ko kahi o na At the place of a chief one 'li'i. must wait for hunger to be appeased. One must wait for the will and favour of a chief. No one is independent in his presence. Ho'i pu'olo no o kahi'ali'i. One returns with a bundle from the place of a chief. When one visits the home of a generous chief, one always has a gift to take home.</page><page sequence="45">The Polynesian Family System in a-'u, Hawaii 339 Under the authority of a forceful chief, the proud and the humble alike must be alert to heed the least command of their lord : Ho'okahi no leo o ke alo A command is given only 'alii. once in the presence of a chief. The commoner at least enjoyed a certain security in that he ran less risk of giving offense than those in high places in the entourage of the 'Ali'i. Ko luna pohaku no ke ka'a It is the stone that is high i lalo, 'a'ole hiki ko lalo up that can roll down but pohaku ke ka'a. a stone that is down can not roll. When a chief is overthrown, his followers move on but the people who have lived on the land from the days of their ancestors, continue to live on it. The Outcaste Class (Kauwa). The aristocrats .'{'ali'i), experts in priestcraft of one kind or another (kahuna), and tribesmen of the land (ma ka-aina-na) were proud of being one stock, native to Ka-'u. But there was an outcaste group whose origin is subject to speculation. A part of Ninole, in Ka-'u, was set apart for the kauw? people; a people so despised that they were never allowed to mingle even with the commoners nor to marry any one. but a kauw?. Should any forbidden union take place and offspring result, the baby was put to death. Should any person walk on land set apart for the kauw?, he or she was regarded as being defiled and was put to death. A kauw? was allowed to go to the place of the chief who was his lord and nowhere else. In travelling, the head was covered with a large handkerchief of kapa, and the eyes kept downcast in humiliation. When there was no law-breaker or war victim to offer as human sacrifice in the heia'u&gt; the kahuna went near the boundary of the lauw? land and selected a man, as one might select a fowl in a barnyard. A kauw? could not refuse, and followed the kahuna who called him. If he were not to be put to" death immediately, he was given an elongated gourd to wear, suspended from the neck with a string* which was referred to as " garland for waiting" (lei i ka ). To say to one that his ancestor</page><page sequence="46">340 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY had worn the Olo gourd, was the equivalent of saying that he was a person of no consequence. For a person to refer to himself as his chief's kauw? was all right, because it implied a properly humble spirit. In Christian times the expression kauw? o ke Akua, God's humble servant, came into use. But in other than Bible language we prefer to speak of servants as kanaka hana (work man) or kanaka lawelawe (lawe: to carry, serve). With the overthrow of the kapu system the segregation of the kauw? was done away with. It was no longer compulsory for them to wear distinguishing marks tattooed in the middle of the forehead or at the outer corners of the eyes. They mingled with the people in general and were lost sight of. Some married outside of their own group, thus mixing kauw? blood with that of others. In our homeland lived a man in whose veins ran the blood of chiefs and of the kauw?. One of his daughters became intensely interested in genealogy and went to question him. He would only mention the chiefly side but of the kauw? side he was silent. To his daughter's plea, his one reply was, " What do you care about such smutty nosed people?" (He* aha ka nana ta po'e ihu papa'a?) At one time my mother's brother fell in love with a pretty girl who lived in Pahala. She was industrious, well mannered and the kind of person who would have made an excellent wife. Plans for the coming marriage went on until my grandmother learned that she was of kauw? ancestry. The engagement Was broken at once and all plans laid aside! Excellent though the girl was, she was absolutely not acceptable as a new addition to the family. It is my own belief that the despised kauw? were early settlers, who fought against those who migrated hither at a later date, were badly defeated, greatly reduced in numbers and forced by their conquerors to live a segregated life on a tract of land allotted to them?despised and regarded as the very lowest of the low. Ho'opau Pono. In concluding this series we remind our readers that the task we set ourselves was that of sheer description, not analysis; nor comparison, even with other areas in the Hawaiian Islands. We have drawn to the best of our ability an accurate picture of a phase of old Hawaiian civilization now well nigh extinct, namely the old Polynesian family system of Ka-'u. This we have done with the utmost brevity compatible with thoroughness. The task has not been a simple one : it wpuld have been easier and would have taken less time and effort had we compiled voluminously from</page><page sequence="47">The Polynesian Family System in Ka-u, Hawai1/ 341 notes and knowledge available. Each topic has been reduced to bare essentials, generally with a single example, and some times not even that, as in the case of many relationship terms : these alone, if fully discussed and illustrated would have made a book-full in themselves. The same is true of the subject matter of each paper. It is for others to analyze and compare in accordance with their interests and knowledge.
