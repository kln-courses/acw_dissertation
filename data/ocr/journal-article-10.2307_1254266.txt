<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRESIDENTTAL ADDRESS. I. IN addressing the Folk-Lore Society for the last time as its President, I ask leave to offer some observations as to the light thrown by the study of folklore on the origin and development of the faculty of imagination in mankind. 2. In the first place, I propose to submit the question from the point of view of anthropology. The earliest peoples of whom we have any knowledge, are those of the Palaeolithic period, and there is little or no evidence to show that they exercised the faculty of imagination at all. They possessed remarkable executive skill in art; they formed small imple- ments of flint with which they scratched upon objects of bone or other material portraits of mammoth, horse, deer, wild goat, and of man. These implements were fashioned with great delicacy, and were well adapted to their purpose. The Palaeolithic peoples also drew on the walls of the caverns they occupied other similar pictures on a larger scale; but these show the skill only of the faithful copyist. It may be that in other ways they gave play to their fancy. Dr. Haddon, indeed, thinks there is some trace of original design in their drawings; but if we may venture to con- jecture from what we know of the habits of life of the primaeval savage, so little raised above mere animal exist- ence, we should be disposed to conclude that they exercised their imagination very little, if at all. Antiquity appears to have begun long after their primaeval race was run. 3. When, however, we bridge over the wide gulf that (in this part of the world at least) yawns between them and the neolithic peoples, the case is greatly altered. In this later Stone Age, we find, associated with human skeletons, stone weapons and other objects, carefully polished and</page><page sequence="2">Presidential Address. 13 worked into elegant forms. We find also the practice of trepanning the skull in operation on the living and on the dead. What is implied in these? Surely, that man's imagination has been active. He has worked out the idea that his existence continues after death, and that things useful to him in this life will be wanted by him, and will prove equally useful to him, in that other condition of continued existence. Again, if Broca is correct in his view of the purposes of trepanning-that, as used upon the living, it was for the relief of the patient from epilepsy, and as used upon the dead, it provided amulets and charms against various diseases-we have at the foundation of this, the idea that disease of the brain is the work of a foreign and invisible spirit, who has to be let out of his hiding place; and that diseases generally are the work of spirits, who are to be diverted from their purpose by means of amulets or charms. These conclusions can only have been arrived at by neolithic man through the unrestrained exercise of his faculty of imagination. One cannot but marvel at the liveliness and activity of mind displayed at so early a stage. 4. Passing on to the next period, the Bronze Age, into which, as Professor Montelius has shown, the Neolithic Age almost imperceptibly glides, we find, 'in connection with interments, drinking vessels, objects of personal adorn- ment, bronze plates that may have served as armour. Evidence of this is given in detail in General Pitt-Rivers' work on his excavations of burial-places at Rushmore and in Cranborne Chase. The drinking vessel indicates a further effort of the imagination. The deceased required food in his altered condition. Some objects in these inter- ments are burnt, as if to prepare them for his use. There are even traces of the custom of immolating wives, children, or slaves to be companions of the deceased in his other state. Whatever we may think of the morality of such a practice, we must at least admit that it could not have</page><page sequence="3">14 Presidential Address. been adopted by any people until they had worked out a theory of the future state which could in no way have been based upon evidence, and therefore must be the result of pure imagination. That imagination must have been powerful indeed which led willing victims to submit to be slaughtered for such a purpose. The custom could hardly have been maintained without the establishment of a class of men professionally bound to urge it upon the people, and to stimulate their imagination with the promise of future joy in reward for the present sacrifice. By this means imagination was developed into belief. 5. An example of this is afforded by what Herodotus tells of the Thracians who dwelt above the Crestonaeans. ' Each man has several wives. When he dies, a great contest arises among the wives, and violent disputes among their friends, on this point-which of them was most loved by the husband. She who is adjudged to have been so, and is so honoured, having been extolled by both men and women, is slain on the tomb by her own nearest relative, and when slain is buried with her husband. The others deem this a great misfortune, for it is the utmost dis- grace to them." (Terpsichore, 5 ed. Cary, and see Valerius Maximus, ii. 6.) 6. The other form of this practice, the immolation of slaves, is illustrated by an extract from the Book of Bally- mote, a MS. belonging to the Royal Irish Academy (fol. I45bb), which is translated as follows by Professor Sullivan in his introduction to O'Curry's Lectures on the Manners and Customsof theAncient Irish (vol. i., p. cccxx) : "Fiachra then brought 50 hostages with him from Munster . and he went forth then on his way to Temar. When he reached Forud . ... in Meath, Fiachra died of his wounds there. His Leacht was made, and his Fert was raised, and his Cluiche Caintech was ignited, and his Ogam name was written, and the fifty hostages which he brought from the South were buried alive around the Fert</page><page sequence="4">Presidential Address. '15 of Fiachra, that it might be a reproach to the Momonians for ever, and it might be a trophy over them." Upon this Sullivan observes that putting them to death in the way here described, and burying them around Fiachra, as they would have sat in fetters along the wall of his banqueting hall, consecrated them, as it were, to perpetual hostageship even among the dead. 7. In the Iron Age, the same process of imagination con- tinued to operate. The cemetery of Nordrup, in Zealand, belonging to the earlier Iron Age, yielded (as described by Mr. Henry Petersen in Nordiske Fortidsmzinder), in connec- tion with the burial of a female, a vase of fluted bronze, a bronze saucepan with a strainer, two goblets of coloured glass, and a beautiful chest-ornament of silver with plates of silver gilt, a silver brooch, an amber bead, twenty-five beads of coloured glass, a small bronze pendant, a box of ointment attached to a little chain, a bone comb, and other objects by which the lady might make herself as splendid in her future state as she had been accustomed to be in her former life. Not far off, in the grave of a man, were a silver brooch, a gold finger-ring, a clay vase, the useful saucepan and strainer, a glass goblet ornamented with excellently designed, painted, and vitrified figures of animals, another adorned with perfectly drawn figures of a bull, a bear, a man, a lion, and a stag, a bronze bucket,. the bronze ornaments of a wooden box, and forty-one draughtsmen, eighteen of red glass, and twenty-three of variegated glass ; so that he was provided not only with ornaments and food utensils, but also with means of amusement if he could find any one to play with him. Possibly he may have been also provided with a companion for that purpose. 8. In these prehistoric times, another idea attached itself to this imagination of a continued existence. It was that this existence ought to be kept within bounds, and that the dead might make themselves very disagreeable to the survivors if they came up again and mixed with them.</page><page sequence="5">16 Presidential Address. Why it should be thought that piling great stones over them would be an effectual way of keeping them under ground is not clear; but that is the flight of imagination to which we owe cairns and megalithic monuments, the pyramids of Egypt, and the very mausoleum itself, and which is represented to us in our own day by the strange fine art of the cemetery mason. What needs my Shakespeare for his honoured bones, The labour of an age in piled stones; Or that his hallowed relics should be hid Under a star y-pointing pyramid ? Milton's answer indicates another association of the monument than that which gave it its origin: Thou our fancy of itself bereaving, Dost make us marble with too much conceiving; And so sepuilchred in such pomp dost lie, That kings for such a tomb would wish to die. 9. In the second place, I propose to submit the question from the point of view of history. To suggest that that is a point from Which even prehistoric times may be viewed is not such a contradiction in terms as it would seem at first sight to be; for by the use of the convenient method of analogy, we may guess from the records relating to the lower races of mankind at the present time what the primi- tive races were likely to have been. I need not repeat what I said last year as to the aborigines of Australia; that if they had dim surmises as to a Supreme Being, they also indulged in fancies as to their own origin and future con- dition, as to their relations with other animals, and with the spirits which they imagined to lurk in thickets and rivers and rocks, and as to the consequences that would follow any breach of their social contract. It is not a violent assumption that early races of man had some such dim fancies as these, though we should not be safe in attributing all even of these to the primitive aboriginal imagination. 10. I may, however, add to what I then said the testimony</page><page sequence="6">Presidential Address. 17 of that most competent observer, Dr. Walter E. Roth, as to the aborigines of North-West-Central Queensland. They have imagined "a time when all the birds and quadrupeds were blackfellows," and they use that phrase for an ex- pression of the most remote time that they can conceive of. Upon this foundation they have built fables, tales, and legends, to account for the colour and appearance of certain animals, to whom they attribute speech and cunning. They also believe in the power of a bone apparatus in the hands of a doctor or medicine man to produce sickness and death in the person against whom it is directed; and they stimulate their imagination by an elaborate system of sign language. 1i. They practised cannibalism. Now my friend Mr. Morley Roberts has suggested that if we were rightly to regard the true function of cannibalism we should not feel the necessity for supposing that a very long period was needed to create the present large brain of man; and he holds that cannibalism is a factor in evolution, by which those who show the greatest capacity for combined action are the fittest to survive; that it leads to war, which brings forth the qualities that make man man; that if it is now dying out, it is because it has done its work, and that probably all flesh-eating of any kind whatever will have the same fate. I am afraid that I cannot altogether agree with him, though the arguments by which he supports his views are wonderfully ingenious. I think that cannibalism is in general only to be accounted for by the exercise of imagination, as tribes would not adopt a custom so opposed to natural instinct if they did not persuade themselves that the result would be their acquiring the good qualities of the defunct. 12. This is illustrated by a poem written in French in 1847 by M. Chev6, a naval officer, and stated by him to have been founded on an occurrence within his own experience in the Marquesas Islands. I will not attempt VOL. XIV. C</page><page sequence="7">18 Presidentz'al Address. to render it into English verse, but the following is a literal translation of an extract from it in English prose. " My tayo (or friend) was a tall man, of lofty and proud bearing; in his glancing eye there glowed a warlike fire; his exploits, his martial boldness, were the boast of his tribe, and the tribes around spoke of them with trembling. He was a chief of high lineage, cousin and favourite of the king of the tribe, who was an impotent old rascal, a sinister man-eater, foundered with leprosy, brandy, and murder ..... I had occasion to go to a neighbouring island to succour a shipwrecked vessel; on my return to the bay at the end of a week I sought my tayo; the king had eaten him! The high priest had said to the king, If old age and ill-health have bowed thy noble head, feed thyself on a warrior; his vigour, his suppleness, and his valiant soul will pass into thy body; and so, to incorporate in himself youth and strength, to refresh his thin blood by a thickened lymph, the king had eaten him on a large plate of bark, well peppered to his taste, and stuffed with potatoes." Thus the highest compliment you can pay a conquered enemy is to eat him. As the subject is not an agreeable one I shall not pursue it further, but shall merely refer to the evidence as to the practice of cannibalism in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages collected by various members of the International Congress of Prehistoric Anthropology and Archaeology, and recorded in the report of their meeting at Paris in I867- 13. Among primitive peoples, representing the Stone Age, the Eskimo of North America, who call themselves Innuits, or " the men " par excellence, may surely be reckoned. Evidence of the exercise by these people of the several flights of imagination that we have attributed to the neolithic stone workers is given in the reports of Dr. Franz Boas and Mr. Hill-Tout to the British Associa- tion, and of Mr. Lucien Turner and Mr. Nelson to the Bureau of American Ethnology. The Eskimo about Bering</page><page sequence="8">Presidential Address. 19 Strait hold annual festivals for the purpose of making offer- ings of food, water, and clothing to the shades of those recently deceased. The great feast to the dead, held once every ten years, occupies five days, and is attended by persons from surrounding villages for a distance of nearly 200 miles. These people imagine that the shades of the dead linger in the vicinity of their life-scenes, and will do harm to the survivors if precaution be not taken. They conjecture also that the same attributes are possessed by the shades of animals, which in their fancy are half human. Upon these conjectures and fancies they have built up a mythology and practice that give ample play to the imagina- tion. 14. A very similar custom to the festival of the dead among the Eskimo is observed by the inhabitants of the far- distant island of Car Nicobar, in the tropics, and is described by Mr. V. Solomon in the 7ournal of the Anthropological Institute. We have here therefore an instance of the wholly independent working of the human imagination in the same direction among peoples who can never have come into contact. Another of their feasts is described as "feeding human shadows." The excuse for another is to feed and propitiate the devils from the jungle. The Car Nicobarese appear indeed to be engaged in continual festivity, and to have to draw upon their imagination for pretexts. They have ceremonies for expelling the devils from people who are ill, and for catching devils and throw- ing them into the sea. Their theory of their own origin is that they are descended from the union of a dog and a human being; but they are divided into two sects, one holding the dog to have been the father, the other that it was the mother. The result is more happy than usual with such dissensions, for both agree that they ought to treat their dogs kindly and never beat them. They quiet them by simply saying " hoos, hoos ! " 15. It will not be necessary to seek further evidence from c2</page><page sequence="9">20 Preszdential Addrcss. the lower races of mankind to show that the faculty of imagination is in lively exercise among them, and goes far to account for many of their practices. There is one race, very low down in the scale, the Bushmen of South Africa, which has in common with the paleolithic peoples the imitative artistic faculty highly developed. The late Sir Bartle Frere said that their arts of music and painting are far superior to the rudimentary efforts of which traces are to be found in most savage tribes. Indeed, their very stone implements are of the palaeolithic type, but there is some evidence that even they possess the idea of continued existence after death. In other respects one would be dis- posed to look upon them as the race of all existing races most nearly approaching what man may have been in palaeolithic times. 16. Where a custom or system is found in operation in many widely-separated parts of the world, it may be safely assumed that it is a custom of great antiquity. Whether it is supposed to have arisen from communication between the several races, or whether it is an instance of the uniform working of the human mind under the like circumstances, either supposition requires a long space of years-many centuries of years-to produce the effect. This observa- tion applies to the custom or system of totemism, of which we have heard so much lately, especially in the learned address of Dr. Haddon to Section H at Belfast, the equally brilliant address of Mr. Lang to this Society, and the informing discussion that took place in this room last July. I am no more disposed now than I was then to come down into the arena where that contest of intellectual giants was fought; my concern is with the relation of totemism to the imaginative faculty, not with its origin ; but I think I may venture to say this much, that when I look at the varied applications to which that system, in one or other of its forms, has lent itself, I can conceive the possibility that it has arisen from as many varied sources of origin.</page><page sequence="10">Presidential Address. 21 I7. Among the North American Indians it is a system of heraldry. A pictorial roster of the heads of families forming the following of Chief Big-Road is given by Colonel Garrick Mallery, in the fourth report of the Bureau of Ethnology, in which the object which answers to the name of each individual is depicted above his head and attached to it by a line in the same manner as a crest surmounts a helmet in an achievement of arms. Little Eagle, Spotted Elk, Pretty Weasel, Prairie Chicken, are some of these. Red Cloud, a Dakota chief, made a census of his band on the same principle, which is also reproduced in that report, though in this the crests are sometimes represented without the heads belonging to them. Mad-hearted Bull, Medicine Horse, Black Bear, Red Star, are among these tokens of honour. These are the personal distinctions of a totemic character, by which the individuals and their families were known, the totems applying to larger groups being some- times tattooed upon the bodies of persons belonging to them. 18. Another use of the totem is as architectural decora- tion, as may be seen by the elaborate totem-posts to be found in many of our museums. These no doubt served other purposes, but for that of mere adornment they are quite effective. 19. A third use of the system of totemism by many peoples is in the enforcement of tabu. The animal or bird which is your totem is not to be killed or injured or eaten by you. In this point of view it may form part of an economic system for regulating the use of food, such as Dr. Roth suggests the complicated system of class-marriage in Australia was intended to be. 20. Finally, the totem is itself a method of regulating marriage, inasmuch as among some peoples you must not marry a person bearing the same totem. From all these points of view, and I daresay there are many others, I leave those who care to do so to seek for the origins of the</page><page sequence="11">22 Presidential Address. system. Totemism is heraldry, architecture, economics, sociology. I have only to point out that it all rests upon this bold stroke of imagination :-that there is between an animal or even an inanimate object and man a mysterious relation by which man can profit if he cares to do so. 21. Upon historic considerations, therefore, we have as yet met with nothing to disturb the inferences we drew from anthropological considerations. May I now, in the third place, turn to the literary aspect of the question ? Folklore takes the literary form so long after the appear- ance of the material upon which it is founded that we are at some disadvantage; but at any rate we are safe in assuming that the more widely apart the peoples are among whom a folktale is spread, the more certainly it is ancient, for the same reasons as those we alleged in regard to customs. The collection of variants of Cinderella made by Miss Roalfe Cox and drawn from all four quarters of the globe is a case in point ; and the masterly introduc- tion to that work shows that we are justified in believing that that group of stories dates back to remote antiquity. One of the motives on which it turns is known as the Help- ful Animal, many instances of which have been collected by Mr. Hartland in the Legend of Perseus, and this is precisely the same stroke of imagination to which we have referred as bearing on totemism: that man is no stranger to the rest of the creation, but has relations with them by which they can be of service to him. The variants of no other folktale have been worked out in the same manner, but in some tales the leading motive is the imagination of a con- tinued existence after death, and there is no reason for questioning that many of these may be ancient. Take for example a few of the types described in the Handbook of Folklore, the Juniper-Tree type, the Snow-White type, and the Thankful Dead type, and possibly some others. 22. Thus the three strands of folklore, anthropological, historical, literary, may be twined together to form a cord</page><page sequence="12">Preszdentz'al Address. 23 that is strong enough to bear up the theory I present to you: that the human race passed through a period of infancy, when its imaginative faculties were dormant; that in the childhood of the race those faculties had a surprising development, and man imagined grander generalisations than any that have ever since been supposed by him; and that as the race grows to manhood, its imagination becomes weaker, for it is more controlled by reason. We have here a complete analogy between the history of the race at large and that of every individual. After the infancy of unconsciousness is over, every man enters upon a childhood full of bright fancies. He beholds the light and whence it flows, He sees it in his joy ; The youth, who daily further from the East Must travel, still is Nature's priest, And by the vision splendid Is on his way attended ; At length the man perceives it die away, And fade into the light of common day. 23. You will observe that I have not mentioned the scientific imagination, and may think that I have used it too freely to do so with discretion. Nor have I made any but a passing allusion to belief in a Creator, and that for three reasons-first, there are no trustworthy means of fixing a time for its origin; second, it is rather an act of reason than of imagination, for the existence of the Deity is part of what used, when I was young, to be called Natural Theo- logy, and as an excellent writer to whom I have already twice referred most admirably puts it, a man who himself makes things may well reason that such things as he could not make must also have had a maker; third, and this springs from the second, our ideas of the Supreme Being are necessarily and essentially anthropomorphic, lacking the saving grace of imagination. Even Christian art can find no better image of the Creator than the seated figure of an old man. In this we are no better than our fathers; and a</page><page sequence="13">24 Presidentiz'al Address. negative answer has still to be given to the question put by Zophar the Naamathite: " Canst thou by searching find out God ? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto per- fection ? " 24. I will now, with your permission, inquire what light has been thrown upon the views I have attempted to lay before you by the many excellent papers that have been contributed to our Society's transactions during the past year. The valuable paper by Mr. Crooke on "The Lifting of the Bride," which I regret to say I was prevented from hearing, but which appeared in the September part of Folklore, falls in well with them. He drew the conclusion that the customs to which he referred are of two classes. What may be called the Petting Stone group of rites were probably fertility charms, as may also be those connected with the threshold, which may, however, be protectives against various forms of evil influences that beset the bride at the beginning of married life. The spring and autumn lifting rites fell, he thought, within the Saturnalia class. All three, he observed, seem to be worn-down survivals of customs which, when viewed in the light of similar usages among people whom we are pleased to call savages, lead us back to a series of conceptions dating from the very infancy of humanity. As I think the expression infancy as used by Mr. Crooke corresponds with the expression childhood as I have been using it, his conclusion is that the act of imagina- tion upon which these customs are based dates back to that period, and that subsequent ages have maintained the customs while gradually forgetting the imaginative con- ceptions that lie at the root of them. 25. The same observation applies to nearly all survivals of early customs, as for instance the customs of harvest time, upon which we received several communications, and those recorded in the papers relating to local folklore in various parts of the world which have been obligingly laid before us. Mr. Skeat, indeed, observed, in his paper on</page><page sequence="14">Presidential Address. 25 "Malay Spiritualism," that there is far less of importance still remaining to be learned by those who are interested in studying the evolutional growth and development of the human mind from the scriptures of the great religions of the world, than from the products of that more untutored imagination from which the primitive peoples have derived their incantations and their customs; and a similar observa- tion is made by Mr. Frazer in the preface to the Golden Bough. 26. Perhaps, however, the paper that affords indirectly the strongest support to my views is the very learned dissertation of Dr. Gaster on "The Letter of Toledo." We find from this that in the year 1184 the faculty of imagina- tion had become so dormant that it had to be stimulated by a letter from the sages and astrologers of Toledo pre- saging the destruction of the world in two years' time by wind and storm, drought and famine, pestilence and earth- quake. Nothing could more strongly indicate the deca- dence of that power of imagination which had led the neolithic peoples to their sublime generalisations. 27. I have obtained similar indirect confirmation from personal inquiry. The other day at the Authors' Club, I asked a brother member who is a well-known and popular novelist, "Whether the wonderful imaginative books with which he had charmed us were not less brilliant than those he would have produced if his powers of expression and composition in childhood had been equal to the powers of imagination which he then possessed ? " (We are allowed to take such freedoms one with another, in that pleasant place of resort.) ".No, no ! " he said, " I do not agree with you at all. Wordsworth's trailing clouds of glory are all nonsense. The fancies of children are the fancies of savages. My novels owe the success they have had to long training and culture of a disciplined imagination." While I accepted his contradiction of the view I had suggested, I inwardly thanked him for his support to the</page><page sequence="15">26 Presidential Address. theory on which it is based. It is quite sufficient for my purpose to know that the spontaneous and untrained imagination is the appanage of the savage and of the child, while the civilised novelist of mature years has to submit to long labour, study, and discipline to produce the results with which he delights us. 28. Miss Bulley's valuable paper read at Belfast, and about to be read before this Society at an early meeting, which contains a study of the psychology of primitive man, denies him some faculties, but leaves open the question which I have attempted to put to you of his imaginative powers. While we shall probably agree with her as to the imperfection of his reasoning faculty, we may fairly claim for him an active and creative fancy. 29. Another paper, which has not yet been read, but which we have accepted with especial gratitude, is the description of the Musquakie Indians by Miss Owen, in illustration of her munificent gift to us of her collection of Beadwork. 30. That collection is not yet suitably displayed at Cam- bridge, but I must express my acknowledgments to Baron Anatole von Hugel for the admirable manner in which he has arranged our Starr collection of objects from Mexico. 31. Finally, I must offer to the officers of the Society- the Treasurer, the Editor, and the Secretary-as well as to the Council, and the members at large, my earnest thanks for their kind support and their indulgence to my many shortcomings during my two years of office. I am gratified to think that you are about to appoint as my successor so distinguished an authority on the subject of Folklore as Professor York Powell, to whom I may apply his own words, written with reference to the Swedish scholar, Rydberg, that he has commented upon Saxo with brilliancy, with minute consideration, and with success. Indeed, I may also sum up all I have been trying to say in the apt language of Professor York Powell himself, taken</page><page sequence="16">Presidential Address. 27 from the introduction he wrote for us to Mr. Oliver Elton's translation of Saxo Grammaticus: " Man makes his gods in his own image. .... Man is a finite animal; he has a limited number of types of legend; these legends, as long as they live and exist, are excessively prehensile ; like the opossum, they can swing from tree to tree without falling; as one tree dies out of memory they pass on to another. When they are scared away by what is called exact intelli- gence from the tall forest of great personalities, they continue to live humbly clinging to such bare sticks and poles as enable them to find a precarious perch." 32. May we not then conclude that all the good stories were told, and all the good jokes made, while the world was very young ? E. W. BRABROOK.</page></plain_text>
