Of the more than 700 manga he pro- manga literally  duced in his lifetime, as many as 180 had insects  swarms with mushi. in them.3 It is no exaggeration to say that insects  inspired Tezuka Osamu’s own “Manga Life,” and  that his manga literally swarms with mushi.  Tezuka was hunting, identifying, and illustrating insects (konchū) in his  earliest manga at elementary and middle school in the 1930s. Governmental  and social institutions had already popularized insect collecting as scientific  learning for boys, and such youths were called konchū shōnen. Jean-H enri Fab- re’s (1823–1915) ten- volume Souvenirs Entomologiques (1879–1907), translated  as Konchūki, began to appear in the Taishō era and never went out of print.  Fabre’s entertaining and educational stories of insect life made them popular  with adults and children alike. Fabre’s books were not banned during the war,  unlike most foreign books; allegedly, kamikaze pilots could carry the impe- rial poetry anthology the Man’yōshū (circa 785, Collection of myriad leaves)  and Konchūki.4 Any rush to presume nativism in talk of a unique Japanese  love of insects is complicated by the fact that socialist anarchist Osugi Sakae  (1885–1923)5 first translated Fabre in 1922. He read Fabre in English during  his years of incarceration before being murdered by police in 1923.6 Japanese  nationalists and insurrectionists alike praised Fabre’s Konchūki. In the short manga, Faaburu sensei no mushi monogatari (1958, Dr. Fabre’s  bug story), Tezuka retells Fabre’s story of the dung beetle, loved by Osugi  Sakae and many other readers.7 Tezuka plays up the scatological humor of  Dr. Fabre urging boys to look more closely at a pile of cow dung (Figure 2). In  it lives a bug who enjoys eating smelly dung before making a ball out of it two  or three times its size (called amusingly a dango, after the round Japanese  sweet), which it then comically has to push, pull, and determinedly roll all  the way home. A slapstick show to observe, the dung beetle chases after its  runaway dango, retrieves it, then does a handstand with its hind legs in the air,  kicking the ball backwards along a crazy zigzag path.8 By the manga’s end, we  learn the female bug has brought the dungball home as both shelter and food  for her larvae that will be born just as she dies. For Tezuka, this was a mov- ing story of humor and pathos. The humor of shitballs rolled by an acrobatic  beetle is inexhaustible; the pathos comes from observing the beetle make  its arduous journey only to die soon after arrival in her underground home.  4 mary a .  knighton </page> <page sequence="5"> But that death is overcome phoenix- like  by new beetles winging their way into  full insect life with the mother beetle’s  sacrificial demise. For Tezuka, writing in  a 1964 column aimed at young readers  called “Boku no konchūki – 1” (My insect  life – part 1),9 what amazed him was the  tamaoshi kogane’s (ball-p ushing beetle’s)  mysterious power of rebirth and trans- formation.10 Such themes of rebirth  and metamorphosis are reworked over  and over again in Phoenix (Hi no tori),  Tezuka’s self- confessed life work. How  curious to think that Tezuka’s glorious  firebird may have its mysterious origins  not only in his early love of bugs and  Fabre’s Konchūki, but more specifically  in the lowly dung beetle, revered since  ancient Egypt as the sacred scarab of the  Sun God attending each day’s rebirth.11  Insects comprise the largest num- ber, and most diversity, of animal spe- cies, and, as this essay’s epigraph attests, figure 1.

Tezuka’s fecund and futuristic  insect imagination seeded this immense cultural production in contemporary  Japan.13  In this essay, discussion of Japan’s entomological affinities and Tezuka’s  attraction to insects, real and imagined, in his life and corpus give way to  gekiga, the adult manga, of Ningen Konchūki (1970–71; trans.

Written in the same time period as ZEPHYRUS, Human Insects stresses survival  and adaptation via insect metaphors, but, in contrast to the former’s individual  story of a boy’s lost innocence in the experience of war, Human Insects develops  them as an adult story of sex and corruption in Japan’s societal, governmental,  and business institutions. Insects allow Tezuka to effect both individual and  national critique due, on the one hand, to insects’ radical alterity, but also  because even individual insects represent insect societies as complex, even  mechanistic, systems. Ultimately, Tezuka’s insect trope complicates binary sex  and gender in human society, with surprisingly feminist implications.  6 mary a .  knighton </page> <page sequence="7"> NINGEN KONCHU ̄KI   (THE BOOK OF HUMAN INSECTS) The Book of Human Insects centers on Tomura Toshiko, a beautiful woman who  achieves great fame and fortune over the course of the story.15 Within pages  of opening the manga, though, we learn that her gains are ill gotten and have  left others in ruins. Having just won Japan’s highest literary prize for her  novel, Toshiko gives her acceptance speech amid flashing lightbulbs. Juxta- posed against this scene of brilliance, however, is a dark room where a name- less woman has hanged herself: the real Tomura Toshiko. In what turns out  to be her modus operandi, “Tomura Toshiko” gets close to lovers and friends  the better to learn their talent, steal it from them, and finally supplant them  altogether. When the real Tomura Toshiko learns of her novel’s theft with the  prize announcement, she commits suicide, leaving her name and success to  be inhabited by Usuba Kageri.  Initially an actress who impersonated others, “Toshiko” continues to as- sume new roles, first sexually seducing and then slowly draining her male  partners of their money and talent. Toshiko’s former lover, Hachisuka Hy- oruku, once ran Theatre Claw to some acclaim. Unwittingly, he had helped  Toshiko study under, then replace, his star actress. It was only a matter of  time before Toshiko forced him out, too, by taking his place as director. Fallen  on hard times and with unrequited love for her, Hachisuka follows Toshiko’s  career rise. His narrative function is to fill the reader in on her past while  sympathetically justifying her actions.  This narrative stresses that Toshiko once loved, and married, designer  Mizuno Ryotaro, but when she stole his drawings and used them to win the  prestigious New York Design Academy competition that he was preparing  to enter, Mizuno leaves her. Toshiko’s next victim is the novelist, which is  where the manga opens. In a more subtle substitution, she foils the anarchist  Arikawa in his plot to assassinate the prime minister by publishing a “fic- tional” story about it gleaned by stealing his notebook. When Toshiko bests  her second husband and CEO of Dai Nippon Steel, Kamaishi Kiriro, at his own  high- stakes corporate games and causes his downfall, he, too, kills himself.  She finally usurps famous photographer Yamato Tamao’s role: having stolen  his film catching her in the act of criminal deception, Toshiko uses the nude  photos to hide her crimes in plain sight, publicizing them as her own to inter- national acclaim. Infatuated men, like the reporter Aokusa, follow her home in order to find  out who the multi- talented Toshiko really is. Surreptitiously, they witness  “becoming-insect woman” 7 </page> <page sequence="8"> her shocking secret: like a butterfly or other larval insect, Tomura Toshiko  sheds one female skin in order to assume the next and is periodically born  anew in a process of metamorphosis (Figure 3). Transforming through stages  of development, Toshiko becomes a new woman each time, as if a molting  insect shedding an exoskeleton that no longer fits. Guided by an apparent  “homing instinct,” Toshiko returns regularly to her childhood home in a rural  village where she narrates and records her life story to a grotesque wax replica  of her dead mother. Nursing at her mother’s fake withered breast, a naked  Toshiko rolls freely on the tatami, stretching and laughing like an animal or  a child (27–29). Her regression to infantile suckling on a fake breast implies  a desire for nourishment unattainable physically; it might also remind us of  insects, such as the dung beetle, that nourish themselves on their mother’s  dead bodies. In her home, detailed from frame to frame simultaneously as  a mausoleum to her childhood (319–20), as a primitive animal den (28–29),  and as a chrysalis for her ceaseless rebirth (22), Toshiko knits together her  strength for self-g eneration. Like a larval insect, her new body is as tender  and vulnerable as a baby’s, requiring her to stay safe at home until it hardens  into a new exoskeleton. While Toshiko steals others’ talents, she has her own  “natural” talent, or instinct, for metamorphosis and mimicry. Toshiko’s real identity, which we learn briefly at the start of Human In- sects and are reminded of again at its end when she takes a passport with that  name, is Usuba Kageri. We may well forget it because she is called Tomura  Toshiko throughout the story. Near the manga’s opening, a large close- up  of Mizuno’s face accompanies his thought- text, “Tomura Toshiko” (5). The  character for To is the same in both of her names, meaning “ten,” but this is  less significant than the shape of the characters (十) as crosses, or x’s. In the  vertical text, the two characters are deliberately, and strikingly, lined up, sug- gesting that her names are mere placeholders for the many identities yet to fill  in these blanks. We can imagine the reader’s confusion if Tezuka had changed  her name each time she assumed a new identity; and yet, rather than call her  by her true name, he maintains the fake one as the one that best represents  her character and talent. It takes only a slight twist or two on Usuba Kageri  to see why: usubakagerō means “ant lion,” 16 which all too aptly identifies the  femme fatale temptress and vampiric Toshiko. Separating her names again  to study the characters literally, we learn that usuba refers to a “mortar” (usu)  in its “place” (ba); with women frequently likened as mortars to male pestles,  the word is almost anatomical. Moreover, Kageri, when read as kagerō, refers  to a kind of dragonfly whose name in Japanese, as in other languages, echoes  the Greek ephemero (“short- lived”). Most insect lives are ephemeral, and so  8 mary a .  knighton </page> <page sequence="9"> figure 3. Tomura Toshiko’s metamorphosis.

Assuming national  proportions by the manga’s conclusion, Tezuka’s Usuba Kageri stands in for  the Japan that Emperor Jimmu once anointed Akitsushima, “The Island of  Dragonflies.” 17  In the end of Ningen Konchūki, Hachisuka confronts Toshiko with her  diary, but she murders him and escapes to Greece under her real name, Usuba  Kageri. In the manga’s final panels, she stands amid ruins in Athens. Having  immolated her fake mother and the shrine to her childhood by setting fire  to her house, her homing instinct guides her to the West. This new home  functions as a new origin site of birth and decay, replacing the “womb” (324)  space of her former home. Finally, we see her atop the Acropolis. Toshiko has  come to represent something larger than herself, standing in for a postwar,  capitalist Japan that, like her, is empty (munashii, 303).18 Thus metonymically  aligning Greece’s ruins with Japan— and linking the old and the new, the  past and the present, through Hadrian’s Arch— Toshiko stands at the edge of  extinction atop the Parthenon. The race to prosperity has led to a lonely, lofty  seat at the top of the world, on civilization’s pile of ruins. Tezuka’s satire, we  see, lies not simply in questioning Western civilization as a good model for  Japan in the first place but, more poignantly, in prefiguring that choice’s final  flowering for both East and West into decadent ruins.19  THE FEMINIST SPECIES Post-O ccupation politics, “miraculous” economic growth, mass consumerism,  and the “women’s lib” movement backlight Tezuka’s use of a female protago- nist’s sexual conquests to tell a tale of corporate and government rapacity.  Sexist representations in media and literature were a focus of “consciousness-  raising” feminists of the 1970s, and in order to depict the challenges his insect  woman confronts, Tezuka dallies with stereotypes to exploit both sympathy  and antagonism toward feminists. Lacking a core self or sense of responsibil- ity while manipulating others for narcissistic gain in vampiric dependence, To- shiko appears as a reactionary argument against female independence. Never  a mother and arguably always a child (in the larval stage), Toshiko’s ability to  transform herself in the story’s themes of rebirth verge on the superstitious  and supernatural, acting as the flip side to worship of women’s reproductive  capabilities. Other female stereotypes— that women are frivolously childish  and fickle, hormonal monsters, insatiably sexual without understanding their  own desires, and frighteningly closer to nature than men— easily map onto  10 mary a .  knighton </page> <page sequence="11"> Toshiko, a highly biological creature. Echoing the film All About Eve (1950),  Toshiko’s pathology is, in short, her feminism: she loses her femininity in  being ruthlessly ambitious in seeking social advancement and abandoning  family for selfish career aspirations, trying to be “like men.”  And yet, in Human Insects, the species-i fication of female sexuality as an  aberrant, monstrously adaptive, and insect-l ike one also produces in Tomura  Toshiko a strong female protagonist concerned with survival at all costs in a  hostile male-d ominated environment. This feminist species functions as a na- tional allegory for Japan’s means of negotiating power relations domestically  and with the United States and other countries on the postwar, late capitalist  stage; it also serves as an autobiographical mask for Tezuka’s career- shifting  experiments in gekiga with the quasi- autobiographical ZEPHYRUS, as he ne- gotiated professional fears of impotence and decline in the face of new manga  trends. Tezuka’s feminist species thus serves as a vehicle to depict not only  the obstacles Japanese women faced in being recognized as fully human and  allowed to participate in all spheres of society as a legacy of the Occupation—  a trope that maps onto Japan’s relationship with its own dominant “partner,”  the United States—b ut also those of Japanese men emasculated first in defeat  and Occupation and then in the cutthroat postwar race to become the world’s  second- largest economy. Tezuka’s “Afterword” to Human Insects makes clear that understanding  the historical moment is necessary for grasping his goals in this work: I wrote this story in a time when all the news blaring on the television and  in the newspapers was gloomy— the antagonism towards those groups call- ing themselves the New Left, indiscriminate acts of terrorism, the quagmire  of Vietnam, and the Cultural Revolution in China. On the other hand, it was  also a time of Japan’s high economic growth running at full speed for the  world’s top GNP spot. The sunshine and the shadows of this absurd time  made me want to depict a strong, Machiavellian woman living through it.20 Tezuka’s “sunshine and shadows” are literally dramatized from the manga’s  outset. Only the opening pages in the Japanese editions of Human Insect are  in lush color, depicting the glittering lights and elites at Toshiko’s awards  ceremony. Abruptly, the black- and- white section begins with a nameless and  anonymous suicide hanging in a dark room, a full- page panel saturated in  black ink. Toshiko’s “Machiavellian” opportunism and mimicry allow her to  operate within her society’s pell-m ell pursuit of material wealth and rise above  the pack. Her successful adaptation satirizes the self- destructive costs of such  “becoming-insect woman” 11 </page> <page sequence="12"> a society, her insect form a satirical counter to the anthropomorphic.21 In hav- ing to adapt to human society, Toshiko fractures its rational surface and then  reflects our repellent qualities back at us.  Reinforcing the historical backdrop and intentions described by Tezuka in  the above “Afterword,” the labyrinthine plot of Human Insects is one through  which Toshiko moves to define not only her personal identity but a national  identity as well. For Tezuka’s insect woman to master the maze, and succeed  as such a character, she must pull together the tightening subplots, from the  yakuza Tousan Gang’s criminal ties to past war crimes in Korea and asso- ciation with left- wing terrorists, to the corporate predations and corruption  played out by Dai Nippon Steel’s Kamaishi in his own master scheme to stage  a political and corporate coup in their business dealing between Taiwan and  China. Notably, Toshiko’s initial role in these plots is simply to react to how  inhuman these “wars” of history and business are, even to an insect woman.  As fantastic insect woman, Toshiko is such a cold-b looded murderer  and manipulative identity thief that to argue that misogynistic negative  stereotypes should not characterize her misses the point. Rather, we might  revel in her eroguro glory and lament that we do not have more of it. To- shiko’s parasitic insect life and polymorphous perversity go hand in hand,  enabling her to obscure (almost) her negative feminist image. Strikingly ab- sent, though— particularly if Toshiko were indeed intended as more eroguro,  quasi- pornographic insect woman than “real woman”— are scenes of kamakiri  (praying mantis) sex. After all, Tezuka delighted in repeating this story in his  konchū comics: the female has sex and in coitus interruptus has her mate for  dinner, too. Although generally more Umezu Kazuo’s style than Tezuka’s, it  is not difficult to imagine a kamakiri lover among Toshiko’s career perfor- mances. Tezuka once joked with author Kita Morio that although his manga  developed a “discourse of female kamakiri” (josei kamakiriron) he had to be  careful— or his wife might eat him.22 One such kamakiri manga can be found  in Yoromeki dōbutsuki (1964–65, Tales of fallen animals), a gag comic of a hus- band henpecked by his wife.23 Dated gender jokes such as these remind us that  Tezuka was a man of his generation, facilely wielding sexist stereotypes as his  prerogative. As a manga artist, though, he still had to adapt to changes afoot  at home and abroad with the sexual revolution. Moreover, faced with govern- ment and local censorship of gekiga manga for its sex and violence, artists  like Tezuka found themselves caught amid moralizing censors, housewives  wringing their hands over children reading obscenities, and feminists coming  down on both sides of free sexual expression.

In his insect fable “Diary of an Insect Shōjo’s Vagabond Life”  (1955, Konchū shōjo no hōrōki—i ncluded in its first English translation in this  volume), a precursor to Human Insects that includes a kamakiri scene, Tezuka  depicts the suffering of women in a male- dominated society. The heroine is a  female silverfish named Shimiko who sheds her exoskeleton and goes to the  big city to make her way in the world. Once there, innocent Shimiko falls in  with the wrong crowd and gets caught up in the sex trade; that is, she sells  her juices in return for money. After a series of predations by male insects,  Shimiko recognizes political and social corruption for what it is and becomes  an activist. Surrounded by placard-w aving protesters, she shouts slogans on a  soapbox in support of the Law to Prevent Selling One’s Juices. Selling juices,  or baijū, is a homophonous twist on baishun, or prostitution, which makes of  the latter a verb applicable to both men and women in all professions who  choose to greedily prostitute themselves for profit over their own integrity. In  the end, though, the bill does not pass into law because of collusion between  male interests in government and business. In despair after her political de- feat and literally beaten up by hired thugs for having been a feminist pest,  Shimiko decides to commit suicide.  The suicide panel appears in the manga’s first frames and ends it, allow- ing the manga’s story to fill us in on an ending we know from the start.25 Our  expectation is subverted, though: when Shimiko jumps to her death from a  drainpipe, above her a human woman jumps too, mirroring her despair in the  different worlds in which they live. The woman survives unhurt, then saves  Shimiko. In the final panel, Shimiko resolves to go on living: upon realizing  that women’s lives in the human world are not the ideal she had imagined,  she chooses insect life instead.  To understand how Shimiko evolves into Toshiko requires a closer look at  both texts. The insect Shimi, written with the characters for “paper” and for  “fish,” is a silverfish known in a Japan as the equivalent of the “bookworm.”  It lives in the pages of books and eats the glue of bindings.26 But, as Tezuka’s  entomologist colleague Kobayashi Junji points out, the narrative preface to  the manga tale suggests a different kind of insect: the aburamushi (aphid, or  “becoming-insect woman” 13 </page> <page sequence="14"> plant louse), which has an unusual mutualistic relationship with ants. The  aburamushi secretes tasty juices from its nether end that the ants drink and,  in return, the ants share food from their mouths with the aburamushi. Tezuka  deliberately uses the mutually beneficial society of aburamushi and ants to  inform the “moral” of his insect fable from its outset: we should live together  in harmony despite our differences.  Unnamed in the preface, the insect with the ants that Tezuka intended was  surely the aburamushi, not the silverfish; Kobayashi conjectures that Tezuka’s  error may actually be artistic license. But Tezuka just as intentionally omits  naming the insect, drawing Shimiko with a distinctive silverfish tail, while de- picting her later civil servant clients with the apple shape and tail of the abura- mushi. We see now why our heroine Shimiko cannot secrete juices, no matter  how hard her clients try to squeeze them out of her: she is not an aphid. Con- sequently, she cannot milk her clients either. She is simply a different species.  Forced to think beyond any pat ending, we see how the layered insect and hu- man tales tell one story. The moralistic conclusion and preface are overwhelmed  by the story itself, which undercuts the moral of “harmony among differences”  by likening it to a mutually parasitic form of social and government corruption  reliant on prostitution and distasteful insect pests; even a dirty joke of mutual  oral sex lurks behind the fable’s façade of clear morals.  Even as one hesitates to describe Tezuka’s personal politics as feminist,  his insect woman fictions afford a surprisingly progressive take on women’s  human rights in a rapidly changing and reactionary Japanese society. That  Shimiko is a book- loving silverfish and not as harmful an insect pest as the  aburamushi (which forms a gall on trees) implies sympathy for his protagonist’s  feminist leanings. This sympathy is evident in Tezuka’s manga title, which  borrows from Hayashi Fumiko’s enormously popular A Vagabond’s Life (1930,  Hōrōki). Hayashi’s artful diary details her wanderings from place to place, job  to job, lover to lover. The artist she would finally marry was named, coinciden- tally enough, Tezuka (Rokubin). Other Hayashi novels with similar themes  ended up as enormously successful films by director Naruse Mikio, including  Floating Clouds (Ukigumo) in 1955, the year that Tezuka creates his curiously  feminist insect manga. The significance of diaries to feminist thought is shared  by Hayashi’s and Tezuka’s vagabonds and informs as well a key motif in Human  Insects. We should note that the autobiographical impetus also shapes Tezuka’s  ZEPHYRUS/Paper Fortress response to gekiga demands. To succeed in a man’s world as the postwar second wave of feminism broke  over society, Japanese women needed veritable super(insect)powers. Shimiko  aptly illustrates what the so- called Housewife Debate (shufu ronsō) of 1955  14 mary a .  knighton </page> <page sequence="15"> documents, that feminists were debating the value of women’s work in and  outside the home, and whether a wife was a bourgeois prostitute or an unpaid  source of labor.27 The easy ridicule and institutional obstacles to women’s ad- vancement outside the home were rife.28 The women and men who participated  in the Housewife Debate often disagreed heatedly but the ongoing series over  two decades thoroughly explored the complex role of women and gender in a  changing Japan. Any process of social adaptation to, and transformation of,  women’s roles in society would proceed by throwing out what does not work,  like an old exoskeleton. Tezuka replaces Shimiko with Toshiko, but Toshiko has  yet another exoskeleton in her closet: Mizuno’s wife, Shijimi. Shijimi and Toshiko are alter egos, and not only because they look preter- naturally alike and both marry the same man.29 Just as Toshiko is likened to  an insect metamorphosing through its larval stages, as if a butterfly or moth,  Shijimi in Japanese refers to one kind of Zephyrus butterfly, Tezuka’s favorite  insect. This butterfly was the subject of his quasi-a utobiographical manga,  ZEPHYRUS, written as Tezuka  was serializing and writing The  Book of Human Insects. When we  take this into account, Toshiko  reads as Shijimi’s dark twin, a  night moth to Shijimi’s butter- fly. Tezuka depicts just such a  moth fatale in an episode of I.L.  (Figure 4).30 Toshiko refuses to  be her twin, Shijimi: a decorative  and passive woman, a good and  quiet wife with no opinions, a  sexually attractive and pliant for- mer geisha, a wife for whom her  husband’s wish is her command.  While Shijimi is always dressed  in kimono, Toshiko dresses in  modern clothes— when she  wears clothes!— and represents  a modern woman with ambition.  figure 4.

In refusing to be Shi- jimi, though, Toshiko evokes their contrast and choices even more vividly,  paralleling Tezuka’s vagabond shōjo manga in striking ways. In Human Insects, Shijimi, like Shimiko before her, is victimized by her  patriarchal society, while Toshiko thrives on the competition within it like  Tezuka’s “strong Machiavellian woman.” Exploited as a geisha working for the  company boss who later hires Mizuno, Shijimi had been forced to take many  clients until multiple abortions damage her health, leaving her susceptible to  tuberculosis. Shijimi dies, too weak to survive in this world. Although Tezuka  and his first readers may have found Shijimi/Zephyrus more beautiful in her  sacrificial ephemeral life (understandably preferable to the murderous To- shiko), it is worth remembering how Shijimi helps Toshiko: Shijimi agrees to  switch places with her temporarily so that Toshiko can escape her husband’s  surveillance, get an abortion, and thwart her husband’s next move in their  chess game of a marriage. This switch is a plot device but it also functions  to tell the reader that the two women are alter egos who still have much in  common, and their alterity may be less adversarial than a matter of different  choices made. Toshiko loves Mizuno, but she never tries to hurt Shijimi or get  Mizuno for herself. The weak Shijimi is simply no match for Toshiko, her more  evolved sister, and, bluntly put, loving Mizuno is not enough for Toshiko. To- shiko is a biological creature, but unlike Shijimi or a pure insect, her biology is  no longer her destiny. The insect woman is thus made, not born. Consider how  Toshiko stands out wherever she goes in her society: as a woman surrounded  by men, it often looks as if she does not belong. One would think that she  constituted the “problem” (josei mondai) when in fact she only appears as an  aberration in a “natural” world of men. Tezuka’s feminist species, we might  say, is a freak of this particular kind of nature. “BECOMING- INSECT WOMAN” Pat acceptance of corruption and women’s sexual exploitation as the human  way of the world goes against the grain of Tezuka’s konchū shōjo manga. Its  narrative structure, sexual humor, and conclusion reinforce the fact that the  story is about an imagined third term, what feminist theorist Rosi Braidotti  in Metamorphoses (2002) calls “becoming-i nsect,” and which I contend over- lays the concept of “becoming- woman” in this reading of Tezuka’s feminist  insects.31 Working from theorists Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s elabora- tion of philosopher Henri Bergson, Braidotti’s concepts stress the need to  16 mary a .  knighton </page> <page sequence="17"> envision our social and lived intensities in new ways, in order to create a more  materialist feminist ethics of bodies in their environments. One such way is  through the more radical biomorphic alterity of insects rather than through  our usual anthropomorphic and corporeal lenses: [Insects] pose the question of radical otherness not in metaphorical but in  biomorphic terms, that is to say as a metamorphosis of the sensory and  cognitive apparatus. In this regard, the insect provides a new paradigm for  discontinuous transmutations without major disruptions. The key elements  of this are: larval metamorphoses; the speed of their reproductive system;  the propensity to generate mutations; the faster rate of genetic recombina- tion. Moreover, not having any major neuronal reservoir, insects are free  from the hold of memory and of the socially enforced forms of sedimented  memory, known as institutions. In Deleuze’s terminology, they are multiple  singularities without fixed identities.32 A “becoming” phenomenology redefines ontology in movement and change,  in what one does, and how one connects to the world and to one’s senso- rium rather than in what one is. “Becoming-i nsect” as a further conjugation  of “becoming- woman” means being neither simply woman nor insect alone,  offering instead a posthumanist and feminist vantage point for imagining  anew the myriad and complex performances, exchanges, transactions, and  circulations of embodied “women.” As hybrid natural and social animal, break- ing free of the preconceived molds that constrain her as either woman or  insect, the insect woman plugs into social and natural environments with  an efficiency, ethical commitment, and affective intensity that promises to  alter the systems of which she is a part.33 The reassurances of static defini- tion and identity are trumped by sure mobility and change in our brave new  world where adaptation is revitalizing and nothing short of vital. In short, this  is the posthumanist species of feminist subject that Tezuka could not have  articulated as such in his time but that nonetheless speaks uncannily to our  own via his insect woman figurations.  Strict literary conventions accompany Japan’s long and rich insect culture,  but Tezuka cultivated an insect imagination free from such constraints by also  drawing on world literature and fabricating nonexistent creatures. Besides  realistic drawings of insect specimens, Tezuka conjured forth insect species,  hybrids of human culture and insect biology, giving them satirical, humor- ous, or Latin- sounding names (Figure 5).34 Manga scholar Takeuchi Osamu  describes the anthropomorphized insects in Tezuka’s fictions as “chimera,”  “becoming-insect woman” 17 </page> <page sequence="18"> figure 5.

Manga critic Ishigami Mitsutoshi argues that although most anthropo- morphized insects in manga are male, Tezuka stands out for the many fe- male insect protagonists in his work. He claims that Tezuka’s young male  readership was more comfortable with the overt physical and biological attri- butes of mesu (female sexed) life- forms because, unlike the demanding social  and emotional complexities— and sexual taboos— surrounding real women,  young men could scrutinize, discuss, and dissect insect females without em- barrassment or social disapprobation.36 Ono Akira agrees with Ishigami that  it was audience above all that determined the choice of gender for Tezuka’s  human insects.37 This “science of sex” thinking perhaps underlies Tezuka’s  description of his fictional females as “cute” iseibutsu (foreign bodies).38 But  in Tomura Toshiko, Tezuka does not supply the usual object of male desire.  Behind Tomura Toshiko’s side- by- side 十十’s, from the very start of The Book  of Human Insects, are the eyes of an insect woman with her readerly male prey  pinned in her crosshairs. Like them or not, Tezuka’s feminist species enact multiple biomorphic  and social possibilities. Their “insect woman” fictional guises in representa- tive manga—C hiteikoku no kaijin (1948, Strange creatures in an underground  18 mary a .  knighton </page> <page sequence="19"> country), Ari to kyojin (1961, Ants and giants), Chikyū o nomu (1968, Swal- lowing the Earth), and ZEPHRYUS (1971)—r each their apotheosis in Human  Insects.39 Almost twenty years before Human Insects gives us Tomura Toshiko  (aka Usuba Kageri) as a dubiously victorious feminist adaptation to the post- war environment, Tezuka sketched out its less happy precedent in “Diary of  an Insect Shōjo’s Vagabond Life.” This earlier social satire of postwar corrup- tion creates Shimiko as a feminist victim in a manga published in the wake  of an Occupation that roiled Japan’s gender dynamics: women got the vote  and new freedoms that men, reinstalled in power, were, at best, ambivalent  about and, at worst, tried to roll back or resented as the lingering sting of the  Occupation’s emasculation.  The term “feminist” aptly captures this postwar history, Tezuka’s natural  environment for creating insect women characters. As used in Japan through- out the 1960s and 1970s, it referred less to women than to men who were kind  to women; gentlemen opening doors for women, for instance, was deemed  “feminist.” Designating foreign liberated women and Japanese men as “femi- nist” doubly troubles this word’s accrued domestic and imported connotations  in Japan. The liberated human as foreign woman renders the Japanese woman  a different species, like Shimiko. The man, meanwhile, who cannot compete  in his society risks emasculation, and he who panders to weak women as a  “feminist” risks feminization by association. “Becoming- woman” is evidently  not limited to biological females, and negative gender stereotyping of the  “feminine” and “feminist” impacts men as surely as women in Japan.  HOMME / FEMME FATALE: MW My conclusion proceeds by way of anecdote. Tezuka insisted to his friend,  Kita Morio, a fellow writer and insect collector, that when he used to collect  bugs, he was most interested in the hermaphroditic (shiyūtai) insects, as they  were more unusual. These insects led to his interest in creating fictional pro- tagonists that were neither male nor female (otoko demo nai, onna demo nai)40  or that were, in human terms, hermaphroditic (haninyō). Characters such as  Mitchy in Metropolis, the eponymous Princess Knight, and MW’s Yuki Michio  are well- known examples. “Diary of an Insect Shōjo’s Vagabond Life” is ap- parently Tezuka’s earliest use of the term “MW” to describe a more complex,  hybrid gender: man/woman; half- male, half- female; intersex, and complex  gender are all encompassed by this significant concept in Tezuka’s fictions.  Strikingly, in the September 1955 essay he contributed to the Housewife  “becoming-insect woman” 19 </page> <page sequence="20"> Debates to warn Japanese men and women against such blurring of gender  lines, Mochizuki Mamoru invoked “MW.” This was the same month and year  in which Tezuka’s manga “Diary of an Insect Shōjo’s Vagabond Life” first  appeared.41 Tezuka’s observations in the natural world led him to create fictional  characters that explored more expansive notions of sexed bodies. What his  intellect made room for, his imagination expanded considerably in conjuring  fictions of human insects. In line with Fabre’s insistence that books alone are  insufficient, Tezuka’s insects were also drawn from both life and imagination;  why wouldn’t his insect women be too? The insects that he caught and cata- logued challenged the categories and limits of single- sexed bodies, complicat- ing common- sense notions about society’s sex/gender systems.  As we saw with his “Afterword” to The Book of Human Insects, Tezuka  wanted Usuba Kageri to represent the contradictions and absurdities, the  “sunshine and shade” (in to yo), of larger historical and political forces in his  time. Much later, in his conversation with Kita Morio, Tezuka repeats this idea  in the expression haninyo to evoke his biological notion of a third sex (han/ in/yo is literally “half sun, half shade”). Usuba Kageri evolves out of earlier  MW characters as well as Shimiko and Shijimi to most fully realize Tezuka’s  gekiga insect woman. As a Machiavellian feminist species, she only comes to  life, and thrives, in the very particular social and political environments that  humans can make.

Media studies professor and well- known Tezuka scholar Takeuchi Osamu recounts  Tezuka’s oft- repeated story that his best friend in elementary school, Ishihara Minoru, be- stowed the nickname upon him (Tezuka Osamu: Aachisto ni naru na [Tokyo: Minerva Shobo,  2008], 28–32). Besides Ishihara’s own written account claiming that Tezuka was drawn to  the name without Ishihara needing to give it to him (included in Tezuka Osamu, Boku no  manga jinsei [My Manga Life][Tokyo: Iwanami Shinsho, 1997], 44), Takeuchi refers to other  classmates’ testimony that just who gave Tezuka the name at the time is not clear as they  all teased him while looking at the illustrated book of insects that Ishihara had brought to  class. In looking at Hirayama Shūjirō’s Genshoku senshu konchū zufu [Original color pictures  of 1000 kinds of insects] (Tokyo: Sanseido, 1933), it was the osamushi (carabid beetle)  that caught the boys’ attention for its appearance, and for the pun they could make with  20 mary a .  knighton </page> <page sequence="21"> Tezuka’s first name. In Tezuka Osamu shōnen no jitsuzō (The real shōnen Tezuka Osamu),  memories of Tezuka’s elementary school life are recalled by a classmate, Izutani Susumu  (Tokyo: Jinbun Shoin, 2003). (Note that Izutani Susumu was the Sinified name that Ishi- hara Minoru chose for himself after the invasion of Manchuria when many students were  making these names up for themselves [Tezuka, Boku no manga jinsei, 49]). Tezuka later  writes that his namesake, the carabid beetle, which has 600 species in Japan and more than  20,000 worldwide, was just like him with its skinny neck and tendency to wander about  at night (“Boku no konchūki: Part 1,” first published in Tetsuwan Atomu kurabu [December  1964], and collected in Kobayashi Junji, ed. Tezuka Osamu no konchū hakurankai [Tokyo:  Isoppusha, 1998], 90).  2. Osamu written as 治 is pronounced the same with or without the added 虫. Ishi- hara Minoru definitively introduced Tezuka to the wonderful world of bug- collecting.  Kobayashi Junji, a fellow insect enthusiast who also worked as an animator at Tezuka’s  Mushi Pro, has compiled several volumes that collect Tezuka’s early notes and realistic ren- derings of insects from his school days. Kobayashi’s edited volumes include Tezuka Osamu  no konchū hakurankai and Tezuka Osamu: Konchū zukan (Tezuka Osamu’s illustrated guide  to insects) (Tokyo: Kodansha Plus- Alpha Bunko, 1997 [1992]). Tezuka’s early writings and  drawings from 1943–44 at Osaka Prefecture’s Kitano Middle School are also reproduced,  updated to modern kanji, and occasionally excerpted and annotated in Tezuka Osamu,  Konchū Tsurezuregusa (Random scribblings about insects) (Tokyo: Shogakkan Bunko,  2001). This also includes early manga works and essays about insects.   3. Kobayashi, Tezuka Osamu no konchū hakurankai, 2.  4.

The second manga in this  collection also indicates its source in Fabre: “Faaburu Ojisan no mushi monogatari: karyu- dobachi no ohanashi ” (Uncle Fabre’s bug tale: the story of the hunter bee), 20–27. The  insect stories are submitted to an entomological science checkup by Kobayashi, as he ex- plains the real insects behind the fictional ones Tezuka created.  8. Miramax French film Microcosmos (1996), written and directed by Claude Nurid- sany and Marie Pérennou, portrays a wonderful sequence with a dung beetle as it undertakes  in a Chaplin- esque manner its Sisyphean task (often excerpted and available on YouTube). “becoming-insect woman” 21 </page> <page sequence="22">  9. Literally “My Book of Insects,” but I rather willfully translate it this way to site it  between Tezuka’s autobiography title, My Manga Life, and the target of this essay’s discus- sion, The Book of Human Insects. These essays were serialized in Tetsuwan Atomu Kurabu  (Astro Boy Club).  10. In Tezuka’s own words: “Desukara tamaoshi kogane wa, mukashi, umarekawaru  chikara no aru fushigi na mushi toshite, sugoku tōtobaremashita” (Kobayashi, Tezuka  Osamu no konchū hakurankan, 91).  11. Various sources also suggest that the Egyptians saw the dung beetle as sacred be- cause it seemed to have the power of parthenogenesis, giving birth to itself.   12. This work originally appeared in 1978 as “Manbō pajama taidan” (Manbō pajama  dialogue) and is collected in dialogue format as “Onna wa totsuzen henshin suru” (Women  suddenly transform) in Mushirareppanashi (Talking about bugs and stuff) (Tokyo: Shio  Shuppansha, 1981). Author Kita Morio shares Tezuka’s love of insects and collecting, as  evidenced in his well- known collection of essays Dokutoru Manbō konchūki (1961, Doctor  Manbo’s insect stories). He also shares with Tezuka a pen name—h is real name was Saito  Sōkichi— and training as a medical doctor and psychologist. Just before he passed away   in the fall of 2011, a new species of beetle discovered by his entomologist friend Hirasawa   Tomoaki was named after him: manbō biidorokogane or, in Latin, Eumaladera kitamorioi,   a manbō gold beetle.  13. C. J. Suzuki, in “Learning from Monsters: Mizuki Shigeru’s Yokai and War  Manga,” Image &amp; Narrative 12, no. 1 (2011), contends that Mizuki alone rivaled Tezuka in  the production of yōkai that produce an “insectile feeling.”  14. Kami no toriide (1974, Shūkan Shōnen King) and ZEPHYRUS (1971, Shūkan Shōnen  Sandee), both collected in Tezuka Osamu, Sensō Manga: Kessakusen (War manga: Master- pieces) (Tokyo: Shōdensha, 2007), 5–44 and 177–216, respectively.  15. Tezuka Osamu, Ningen Konchūki (Tokyo: Akita Shoten, 1995); translated as The  Book of Human Insects (New York: Vertical, 2011). It was originally serialized in 1970 and  1971 in Play Comic, a manga magazine aimed at young men. The translation uses some  awkward slang expressions (“No biggie,” 343, or “my bad,” 308) that are anachronistic and  off- key for Toshiko. Other translation choices are a matter of interpretation, as with the fi- nal lines and the use of terms for insect. See my translations of the final lines at this essay’s  conclusion. An instance of the latter is Hachisuka calling Aokusa a “bug,” which sounds  cute rather than disparaging in its context (32, 43).   16. The very mention evokes Teshigahara’s wonderful film based on Abe Kōbō’s novel  The Woman in the Dunes (1964), where an entomologist out hunting insects ends up him- self caught in the hole of the titular “woman in the dunes,” a human “ant lion.”  17. Lafcadio Hearn’s Japanese Miscellany (1901) mentions the earliest source for  insects in Japanese culture: the ancient Chronicles of Japan (720, Nihon Shoki) reports  that the legendary first Emperor Jimmu ascended to a mountain summit overlooking  the Yamato plain and saw that it took the shape of a dragonfly. Later, the Imperial poetry  anthologies include the story of Emperor Yūryaku who, having been bitten by a gadfly  (abu), watches as a dragonfly swoops in to make the gadfly its meal in turn. Moved, Em- peror Yūryaku composes a poem to dragonflies that echoes Emperor Jimmu’s anointing of  Japan, Akitsushima, or “The Island of Dragonflies”: “Even a creeping insect / Waits upon  the Great Lord: / Thy form it will bear, / O Yamato, land of the dragon- fly!” In true Nippon  22 mary a .  knighton </page> <page sequence="23"> konchūki fashion, the country of Japan and insects are inextricable signifiers from the ear- liest of Japan’s origin stories passed down even today.  18. A double meaning operates here, of course. We see the psychological and emo- tional emptiness of Toshiko/Japan as she sacrifices everything for success only to have  nothing that matters to her when she achieves it (“it’s lonely at the top,” indeed). But as an  insect woman, she is also literally an empty shell capacious enough to assume any new role  she must play.   19. When Toshiko first mentions her urge to go to Greece, it is to Hachisuka, in this  way: “Let’s see . . . I’m actually rather fond of Greece. The way it’s been ever so in decline,  barely scraping by on tourist money” (141). Civilization, in short, has been reduced to  global capitalism’s commodity.  20.

A genius sees through to the truth of the Japa- nese) (Tokyo: Shindensha, 2005), 152–65. Nakano cites in full Tezuka’s “Afterword” from  the Tezuka Osamu manga zenshū (160).  21. In making Toshiko an insect woman, he does not vilify the insect, just as the tar- get of Karel and Josef Čapek’s 1922 satire The Insect Play (a work much admired by Tezuka)  is not the insect. The play’s parenthetical subtitle, “And so ad infinitum,” is derived from  the Jonathan Swift poem, “On Poetry: A Rhapsody,” excerpted on the play’s title page.  22.

See Jan Bardsley’s excellent essay, “Discourse on Women in Postwar Japan: The  Housewife Debate of 1955,” U.S.–Japan Women’s Journal [English Supplement] 16 (1999):  3–47. Bardsley focuses on 1955, the inaugural year of the debates and just when Tezuka  published his short manga in September. Made up of thirty- three essays published in Fujin  Kōron [Women’s review], they lasted until 1976.  28. For two good sources on the history of modern feminism in survey and for more  local social movements, see Vera Mackie, Feminism in Modern Japan: Citizenship, Embodi- ment, and Sexuality (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), and Sandra Buckley,  Broken Silence: Voices of Japanese Feminism (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997).  29. Fujimoto Yukari contends that alter egos in shōjo manga, be they same sex or op- posite sex, often overlap with the categories androgynous, hermaphroditic, or polysexual,  and that this all began with Tezuka’s Princess Knight and the Takarazuka Revue. Polymor- phously perverse sexual trysts and cross- dressing scenes are everywhere in Tezuka’s works,  and most critics intone Fujimoto’s insight that they were inspired by the performances of  women dressed for both male and female roles in the all- female Revue. Tezuka knew per- sonally Takarazuka Revue performers, using them as models for numerous characters, male  “becoming-insect woman” 23 </page> <page sequence="24"> and female.

I.L. is a Pygmalion- esque invention of man in female form, endowed with the  ability to transform and mimic whatever or whomever is requested of her.

Of course, Braidotti, too, would connect these concepts, just not to the Japanese  literary and historical context as I do here.

Braidotti, Metamorphoses, as cited in Jussi Parikka, Insect Media: An Archaeology of  Animals and Technology (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2010).  33. Parikka reminds us that in A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari’s famous  example of “becoming- animal” is told as a story of a wasp and an orchid, where “the reality  of the becomings is not constituted in the terms that are connected— for example, those  of man becoming animal. Instead, what is real is the process of becoming itself, which  ‘lacks a subject distinct from itself.’ Becoming- animal is a process of creative involution  that proceeds by alliances and the new assemblages produced by the pairings” (245, note  26).  34.

Cited in note 49 to her essay, Jan Bardsley sums up Mochizuki’s concerns: “Mo- chizuki imagines that men are dressing in a distinctly feminine way and do not realize that  the fashions they think so wonderfully American are in fact those of gay American men. In  case the reader has any doubts here, Mochizuki uses the Japanese term for homosexuality  (dōseiai) and follows this with gei boi (“gay boy”) in the katakana syllabary. Mochizuki also  states his belief that Japanese men lost faith in their masculinity and in their superior- ity to Japanese women because of the Occupation experience” (Bardsley, “Discourse on  Women in Postwar Japan,” 44).
