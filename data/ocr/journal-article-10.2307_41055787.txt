<plain_text><page sequence="1">" BABY " AND PUNISHMENT OF THE DIVINITY by Pierre A. Radwanski Upon analyzing the problem of the primitive, pagan conception of divinity, one has to observe the general existence of anthropomorphism : Divinity is considered as a man, with a man9 s qualities and faults. If one prays and offers sacrifices to this divinity, it appears on the surface to be a commercial transaction, based on mutuality : "I to you - you to me". Supporting this, R. Lowie x quotes the prayer to the divinity of a Crow Indian : "If I live to see the autumn and I will bring a booty, I will build you a bath." 225</page><page sequence="2">Etudes Slaves et Est-Européennes If the petition, expressed in the prayer and in the sacrifice is accidentally accomplished, then the supplicant is satisfied and even grateful. But on the other hand should the divinity fail to fulfil the request, then hostile reactions of hatred and a desire for vengeance are awakened in the supplicant, and these same emotions are found in normal human relations. The vengeance on the divinity is a universal phenomenon met among primitive peoples. The usual methods of punishing the divinities are by offending, beating or by destroying them. Among the Ostiaks there is a belief that when the fish are returning to the sea and escape the nets of the fisherman, the protective divinity As-iki has failed them. The fisherman then insult and beat him ; however should there follow a good catch, the divinity is reinstated to his former dignity. Among the Siberian tribes the statue of the divinity is usually destroyed. But when the anger disappears, the statue is rebuilt with as much faith as before. Perhaps the phenomenon of punishment of the divinity offers the best proof for the primitive, anthropomorphic conception of God. Examining the history of Slavic peoples, we can state that in spite of un- remitting efforts on the part of the Christian clergy to destroy the pagan beliefs, nevertheless, some of these beliefs remain deeply rooted in the popular tradition of Slavic peoples. They were not only retained but became integrated with certain Christian religious elements. Regarding punishment of the divinity, certain phenomena in the popular Slavic tradition suggest that it existed with the ancient Slavic peoples. Among the Great-Russians punishment of house divinities existed and was manifested by beating the air with sticks in different parts of the home, while concomitantly insulting the divinities with vulgar nicknames. In the same country the punishment of the Christian saints was also practised. Should a particular saint disregard a request, his picture was taken from the wall and beaten. But hope springs eternally and soon after the saint again occupied his old place. According to S. Udziela and T. Seweryn 2 the Polish mountain dwellers of the Tatra during periods of drought threatened St. John Nepomuce : if rain did not come, he would be beaten. According to K. Dobrowolski 3, we meet the following mediaeval in- cantation to St. Adalbert : "Adalbert ! if you do not help me against the Prussians, I will break your arm and leg !" ("Adalberte ! si non vis me iuvare contra Prutenos, frangam tibï manum et pedem !"). In certain Slavic territories particularly Russian, we meet stone statues, representing women called baby kantienne 4. According to statements made by archaeologists, the chronology of these statues reaches back into prehistoric times. It is an interesting fact that some of these statues were found knocked to the ground. The peculiar position of these statues seems to be connected with the punishment and vengeance on these divinities. At the same time we meet among some Slavic peoples a custom consist- ing of turning over boulders - also sometimes called baby - to obtain changes in the weather. 226</page><page sequence="3">Slavic and East European Studies Concerning this K. Moszynski 5 writes in his Kultura Ludowa Slowian (Slavs' Popular Culture) that it would be interesting to find out whether the turning over of boulders to obtain a change in the weather has an evolutionary connection with the punishment of divinities. More profound analysis of this problem suggests that the turning over of boulders was not related to the punishment of divinities since stones, as such, do not enter the hierarchy of the divinities in Slavic Mythology. The boulders found in the Slavic territories may be similar sometimes to the megaliths found in other parts of Europe but they did not have the status of divinities. Today in some Slavic countries it is believed that the boulders have magical properties. For instance in Bielo-Russia, near the village of Perezir, there is a boulder called Maria which is frequented by many pilgrims asking for recovery from disease (A. E. Bogdanowic). As well as healing properties, some boulders were thought to possess magical powers connected with marriage or birth. Thus it was that sometimes girls looking for husbands, or even married women desiring to have children, frequented the places where the boulders were situated and presented their requests to them. The legend about the boulders is that they were thrown to earth by the devil. Another legend is that they resulted from the devil's fight with God. Pebbles were carried by the Slavic peoples as amulets. We can conclude that the attitude of the Slavic peoples toward boulders is similar to their attitude toward plants and animals. In the world of nature, according to popular beliefs, there are elements possessing magical powers ; therefore these elements are respected but not venerated as divinities. The stones would have become divinities, had they a human aspect. The turning over of boulders does not seem to have the characteristics of the punishment of divinities ; however the knocking down of the stone statues, representing the divinities, as in the case of the ancient baby kamienne, does. 1.
