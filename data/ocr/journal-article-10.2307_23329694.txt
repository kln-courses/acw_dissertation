<plain_text><page sequence="1">Indian English and Man Indo-Anglian Fiction C. PAUL VERGHESE I. Indian English The concept of an Indian English is generally pooh-poohed on the ground that it can only be bad English or baboo English. For instance, M. Chalapati Rau, a well-known journalist and therefore an Indian writer in English, says: 'There are Indo Anglians who think they can manufacture their own brand of English like Americans and other English-speaking peoples. Indian English can only-be bad English!'3 So, too, the English novelist and critic, John Wain in his Essays on Literature and Ideas finds little to commend in Indian English. He, however, concedes that Indian English is a lingua franca; his quarrel is with the use of English by Indians for creative expression. He thinks that Indian English 'lacks the finesse of nuance that makes literature possible' and that the simultaneous influence of Ame rican English and British English on the Indian writer's style is a drag on his creative expression.2 In view of this condemna tion of Indian English, both from inside and from outside India, it is necessary for us to arrive at a definition of Indian English. It is generally believed that the characteristics of Indian English are a fondness for "tall" writing, a delight in "six-foot" words 6</page><page sequence="2">INDIAN ENGLISH AND INDO-ANGLIAN FICTION and . . . grand expressions, magniloquence of style ... coupled with colloquialisms', the use of 'fine imagery often derived from ancient classical sources', the practice of'interlarding or ... embellishing ... periods with misplaced or misguided idioms or phrases, forced allusions, tags, quotations and such bits of Latin or French as those picked up second-hand' and mistaking 'garishness for splendour, tinsel for ornament'.3 Ellis Under wood who has noted these characteristics as typical of Indian English undertook his study of the Indian character as revealed ■ in the kind of English written by Indians, before 1885. He has based his conclusion on petitions and requests written by Indians, and naturally, therefore, the conclusion he has arrived at regarding Indian English and Indian character (which he says is noted for its obsequiousness, na'iveté, sentimentalism and indifference to moral principles) cannot be taken as anything but unjust and unsound. The position has not changed even in this century inasmuch as there are people who equate Indian English with baboo English and as such condemn it. Indian English is not baboo English; nor is it the type of English satirised by Nissim Ezekiel in his poem 'Very Indian poem in English' published in the September 1967 issue of Literature East and West (New York): 'You want one glass lassi'/Very good for digestion/With little salt lovely drink,/Better than wine :/Not that I am ever tasting wine./I'm the total teetotaller, completely total,/But I say/Wine is for the drunkards only.'Also, it cannot be said that indiscriminate use of Indian words in English by an Indian writer makes his English Indian. Perhaps the best definition of Indian English is the one given by Prof. V. K. Gokak. According to him Indian English represents 'the evolution of a distinct standard—a standard the body of which is correct English usage, but whose soul is Indian in colour, thought and imagery, and, now and then, even in the evolution of an idiom which is expressive of the unique quality of the Indian mind while conforming to the "correctness" of English usage. It is illustrative of a special type of language 7</page><page sequence="3">INDIAN LITERATURE phenomenon—a language foreign to the people who use it, but accepted by them because of political and, recently cultural reasons.'4 What Prof. Gokak means is that good Indian English is simply good English, English that differs a little in vocabulary and idiom from good English as written in London or New York, so that it brings out the inwardness of Indian life and culture. It rests upon the same basis as that which the standard English of Great Britain rests upon, but it reveals the Indian character and Indian life in all their glory and shame. Further more, Indian English establishes an Indian idiom of English as opposed to the English idiom of British English, the American idiom of American English and the Australian idiom of Austra lian English. Most of us are not writers, but ordinary users of the language. The question of the Indianness of English does not arise in our use of the language as much as it arises when English is used by Indian writers as a medium of creative expression. For us plain, workaday prose is good enough. But Indian writers in English determined to be writers have to use the English language in such a way as to enable them to give expression to the thought pro cesses of their Indian characters. So, these writers will have to approach English from the angle of their own Indian languages and have to face and overcome a multitude of problems in English which are not discussed in ordinary English grammar books since they never present themselves to the grammarians, but are due entirely to Indian vernacular constructions, word meanings and ways of thought, which are the daily use of Indians at house and among themselves. In other words Indian writers in English will have to adapt the English language to their purpose. The earliest Indian novelist in English who consciously strove to adapt English to meet his needs was Mulk Raj Anand. His. success, however, is only partial; for one notices certain draw backs in his attempt. What is suggested here isthat certain idiosyncrasies of style and purposeless verbiage stand in the way 8</page><page sequence="4">INDIAN ENGLISH AND IND O-ANGLIAN FICTION of his compelling the language to conform to his mode of experience. But Raja Rao in his novels, especially Kartthapura, can be said to have achieved complete success. What is admir able in his achievement is that he does it without grossly violating the syntax and grammar of the English language at any place in his novels. His is an earnest attempt to carry over and trans mute into English the idiom, the rhythm and the tone of the natural speech of his characters. In Katithapura Raja Rao achieves a kind of idiom with a distinct echo of regional speech and reflection of local cololtr,. without slipping into uninten tional solecisms. His achievement is, therefore, much better and more satisfying than Mulk Raj Anand's. Other Indian novelists in English too—whether living in England or America in the direct milieu of the language in which they write or living in close contact with Indian condi tions of life—find English adequate enough for their purpose of depicting the emotional and intellectual life of Indians. Perhaps in some cases the achievement is vitiated to a certain extent by a stiff style which suffers from a tendency to verbosity and heavi ness and a fondness for clichés. However, R. K. Narayan like Raja Rao may be said to have achieved complete success. He has himself said: 'English has proved that if a language has flexibility any experience can be communicated through it, even if it has to be paraphrased sometimes rather than conveyed, and even if the factual detail... is partially understood... We (i.e., Indian writers in English) are still experimentalists. I may straightaway explain what we do not attempt to do. We are not attempting to write Anglo-Saxon English. The English language, through sheer resilience and mobility, is now under going a process of Indianization in the same manner as it adopted U.S. citizenship over a century ago, with the difference that it is the major language there but here one of the fifteen listed in the Indian Constitution. I cannot say whether this process of transmutation is to be viewed as an enrichment of the English language or a debasement of it. All that I am able to confirm 9</page><page sequence="5">INDIAN LITERATURE after nearly thirty years of writing, is that it has served my purposes admirably.'5 Narayan himself, as Alan "Warner points out in his A Short Guide to English Style, writes admirably clean English'.6 Narayan's style is direct and straightforward and is characterised by an economy of expression and vocabulary adequate to deal with the range of subject matter and Indian sensibilities. He avoids unique or obscure phrasing, and a too constant use of compound sentences. Syntax comes closer to the pattern of the normal conversation of an educated Indian. It is these things, as also the lucidity, simplicity, colour, verve and exactitude of his writing that account for the leisurely decorum of his novels. The intimate liaison of his language with the senses and its fidelity to the idiom of speech enable him to achieve casualness, realism and Indianness as a story teller. To quote William Walsh, 'Narayan uses a pure and limpid English, easy and natural in its run and tone... Narayan's language is beautifully adapted to communicate a different, an Indian sensibility.'7 He has also skilfully solved the problems posed by dialogue by making his characters communicate their ideas in straightforward English. The dialogue therefore does not read like a translation and is at the same time free from English collo quialisms. His narrative and descriptive prose with its crispness and flow adequately express the subtle social implications and distinctions of character. Perhaps it is not too much to hope that in course of time as a result of the conscious adaptation of the English language as has already been done by Raja Rao and others in writing Indian fiction, the vast community of Indians will possess a common standard English. However, practical measures will have to be adopted so that it does not merely remain the language of the Indian creative writers in English, but appeals to the Indian intelligentsia and sheds the stigma associated with it. If this happens, then such expressions as 'pin-drop silence', 'family members', 'cousin brother', 'foreign-returned', 'strong friend ship', etc., which are often captured, convicted and hanged by 10</page><page sequence="6">INDIAN ENGLISH AND INDO-ANGLIAN FICTION some scholars on the plea that they are 'Indianisms' because they are not used in British English and therefore sub-standard, will not only pass muster but will be considered good expressions in Indian English. Also, expressions like' salt-giver', 'turmeric ceremony' and 'bow my forehead' will no longer be condemned as unpleasant and ugly collocations. What I have tried to say is that the Indian social, cultural and linguistic set-up has affected the features of the English language as used by the Indian creative writers in English, especially the novelists, and that Indians by and large will in their spoken and written English increasingly use what we today describe as 'Indianisms'. Indian English is only a variety of English whose characteristics stem from the life and culture of the people of India. And the Indianness of it consists in its cultural overtones and undertones and not in a legalization of the ignorant misuse of English. 2. Man in Indo-Anglian Fiction One of the chief sources of pleasure in reading fiction is its satisfaction of our desire to know more about man in his relation to society, in his relation to himself and in his relation to God. A novelist, it may be said, is in search of a unity in the diversity of life and civilization. He, therefore, cannot turn his back on the social realities of his time, but should carve man's image in his art with his social awareness and insight into life. This does not, however, mean that the function of fiction is social legislation. A novelist writing with the avowed purpose of bringing about social change and reform commits an act of transgression. Perhaps one of the drawbacks of Mulk Raj Anand's novels arises from the missionary zeal with which he pleads in them for the amelioration of the lot of the have-nots. This defect is in evidence more in his later than in his earlier ii</page><page sequence="7">INDIAN LITERATURE novels. The Old Woman and the Cow and The Road, both published in the sixties, are examples of this. In his two famous novels Coolie and Untouchable, Anand deals with the misery and wretchedness of the poor and their struggle for a better life. Almost all his subsequent novels are a Variation on the same theme and are intended to bring home to the read er the plight of the over-burdened peasant who is powerless to fight superstition and social convention and is baulked at every step in his aspirations for a better life. In a statement in his Apology for Heroism on his own evolution as an artist, Anand says: '... as my media as a writer were the memory and imagination, and the substance of my work, the whole of my varied experience, the theme of my work became the whole man and the whole gamut of human relationship, rather than only one single part of it'.8 Later in the sajjie book he asserts: '... just as I desire a total and truly human view of experience, a view of the whole man, in order that a completely new kind of revolutionary human may arise, so I have been inclined to stress the need for a truly humanist art commensurate with the needs of our time'.9 Anand has all along written novels and short stories with a view to teaching men 'to recognize the fundamental principles of human living and exercise vigilance in regard to the real enemies of freedom and socialism'.10 He has been conscious of the need 'to help raise the untouchables, the peasants, the serfs, the coolies and the other suppressed members of society, to human dignity and self awareness in view of the abjectness, apathy and despair in which they are sunk'.11 But Anand's heavy emphasis on the didactic quality of art stands in the way of his attainment as a novelist; for obtrusive propaganda makes his novels suffer from an inability to visualize clearly the objective situation of his characters. The charac terization is not particularly clear and the structure of his novels rather loose. However, Anand, as one writing in the tradition of European social realism, 'sees life in the raw and exposes it 12</page><page sequence="8">INDIAN ENGLISH AND INDO-ANGLIAN FICTION mercilessly, flesh, wounds, blood and all .. shedding sentimen talism and writes with a fine touch of scorn of social and eco nomic inequalities'.12 Anand's man is rebellious and is anxious to redeem the world from its misery and pain. Anand's huma nism 'does not therefore rest on a Divine Sanction, as does the mystical humanism of Gandhi or Tagore .. . but puts its faith in the creative imagination of man in his capacity to transform himself., .(and) raise himself to tremendous heights of dignity'.13 This is the saving feature of Anand's art; he is quite definite in his aims as a humanist. And this is also the reason why he leaves severely alone questions relating to man's relationship with himself and his God. The object of proletarian humanism is to reconstruct the complete personality and free it from the distortion and dis memberment to which it has been subjected in class society. In the India of today, class-ridden as it is, the artist whose primary concern is with the political man, will not be able to escape being a proletarian humanist and cannot be indifferent to the lot of the hungry millions. Food is a primary requisite of human dignity; hunger debases and dehumanises man. That is why hunger is the theme of a large number of Indo-Anglian novels. Besides Anand, Bhabani BMttacharya and Kamala Markandaya have dealt quite forcefully with the theme of hunger and the concomitant theme of human degradation in some of their novels. Mention may here be made of Bhattacharya's So Many Hungers! and He Who Rides a Tiger and Markandaya's Nectar in a Sieve and A Handful of Rice. In the last of these novels, Markandaya related the story of the ambitious country boy who decides to swop the poverty-stricken but friendly shelter of the village for the cold menace of city streets. His plight is extreme. He is reduced to the company of petty crooks and whores, but is finally rescued by an old tailor, set up as his apprentice and married off to his daughter. Burdened with a family, his life steadily moves into a climax of despair and tragedy. And his vision of a new India that is /to provide all 13</page><page sequence="9">INDIAN LITERATURE men, high and low, with fresh hope and happiness, turns out to be a will-o'-the-wisp. It is true that in these novels on the theme of hunger, there is a streak of sentimentality and even cheapness. This is so in the description of the exodus from the village to the city of the famine-stricken rural people in these novels. There is also a certain degree of weakness in plot construction and characteriza tion as in Markandaya's A Handful of Rice. But in spite of these weaknesses, it may be admitted that within the terms these novelists are working, their novels on the whole have life and substance and present a convincing picture of human existence, besides revealing an awareness of life's fundamentals. They should, however, guard against being led by their strong sympathy for the poor people into carrying on a political pro paganda. It is in this respect that Nectar in a Sieve and He Who Rides a Tiger score over Mulk Raj Anand's The Old Woman and the Cow and The Road. Closely linked to the themes of poverty and hunger and rural life is the theme of conflict between tradition and modernity. This is a theme which though separately dealt with in novels like Music for Mohini by Bhabani Bhattacharya and A Silence of Desire by Markandaya is also obliquely referred to or indirectly treated in almost every Indian novel in English. This is as it should be in the cultural context in which these novels are written. In Music for Mohini Jayadev, the quiet scholar who lives in his ancestral village, and Mohini, the young city-bred wife of his, who adapts herself very well to her new environ ment, are the two forces that put the .village on the path of progress and modernization. The mother of Jayadev, calm and determined in her ways, holding fast to convention and superstition, relizes in the end her mistake and becomes recon ciled to the changing times. In Markandaya's novel the conflict between tradition and modernity is presented through a husband and a wife. The 14</page><page sequence="10">INDIAN ENGLISH AND INDO-ANGLIAN FICTION husband, Dandekar, is a clerk in a government office. Though not Westernized he is modern and has disóarded the superstition of his forbears. Sarojini, his wife, as submissive and modest as any old world Indian woman, believes in faith cure and so, meets a Swamy for the cure of a growth in her womb. Fearing opposition from her husband, she keeps her visits to the Swamy to herself. This conflict between the husband and the wife is treated in the novel as part of a conflict between science and superstition. The novelist in presenting the conflict does not make an outright condemnation of superstition or faith healing or the Swamy. She attempts to strike a balance between science and superstition. Man in the Indo-Anglian novel is represented as continually adjusting and reacting to society. This is more so because of his having come in contact with the West and his having been exposed to the Western culture and thought. Krishnan, the hero of 33. Rajan's The Dark Dancer, is a typical example of this adjustment. He represents the Western-educated young Indians on whom the stranglehold of society is too strong to allow them to live a life of their choice. After a struggle, which is as brief as it is futile, Krishnan submits to the convention-ridden way of life in India. His attempts at resisting the demands of convention end in a surrender, total and abject. His is the all too familiar story of the idealist ending up as a near-reactionary. Kit in Markandaya's Some Inner Fury also reveals this difficulty to adjustment. He himself is irritated at the Eastern inefficiencies and tries to build his social life on a Western pattern. However, the study of the problem of adjustment in these novels cannot be said to be deep; the novelists just skim over the issue and tend to oversimplify it. The twentieth century concept of individual freedom rests on a view of the welfare of society as not being apart from the welfare of the individuals that constitute it. It is this view of individual freedom that Bhabani Bhattacharya expresses in his A Goddess Named Gold. The scene of this novel is Sonamitti, 15</page><page sequence="11">INDIAN LITERATURE a North Indian village. The interest of the story centres round a taveez, a talisman, which a wandering minstrel presents to his granddaughter Meera with the instruction: 'Wearing it on your person, you will do an act of kindness. Real kindness. Then all copper on your body will turn to gold ... Parted from your arm, the touchstone will be dead, a worthless pebble.'14 She is coaxed by a greedy Seth to enter into a partnership with him on fifty-fifty basis. However, the situations arranged for her by the Seth to change base metals into gold do not yield any result because the taveez will act only when the wearer does deeds of pure goodness involuntarily. Meera becomes exhausted and disgusted and throws away the taveez into the river. The minstrel who now returns to the village on the eve of India's independence tells her that the true talisman, the only taveez is Freedom and that Freedom will be a mere word unless it inspires us to deeds of faith and enables us to achieve the leap from darkness to light. The novel has an aura of fable about it. This only strengthens the symbolic dimension of the novel. The taveez is the symbol of Freedom. The Father of the Nation has given it to us even as the taveez is given to Meera by her grandfather* The freedom of the country is in danger if it is entrusted to the selfish Seth and will become meaningless in the same way as the taveez becomes worthless when it is turned into a means to selfish ends. Freedom should be cherished with selfless devotion; then only will the nation prosper. If the Seth and his henchmen are allowed to make freedom a means to profiteering the country is doomed. Bhattacharya as a novelist has the vision of a welfare society at heart. His concerns are clear and unambiguous; they are political, economic and social. In other words, the dignity of man both in national and international contexts is uppermost in his mind. In this he follows the tradition of European social realism as does Mulk Raj Anand. For him art is always the communication of certain social and political ideals and the artistic form the means of winning over his readers to his views. 16</page><page sequence="12">INDIAN ENGLISH AND INDO-ANGLIAN FICTION . But the lack of depth in his treatment of problems in human relations is a wekness of his art. For example, though his fifth novel Shadow from Ladakh provides an insight into the contrasting contemporary life of India symbolized by Satyajit who regards Indian village life as the ideal life and by the Westernized Ame rican-trained Bhaskar, the forward-looking engineer of Steel town, who feels India's future lies in industrialization, it ends on a weak note of the co-existence of these two ideologies. The inclusion of Chinese aggression as a major incident in the novel and the references to Gandhian idealism and Tagore's ideal of international brotherhood only add to the topical interest of the novel. A philosophical base rather than the prop of a topical event would have strengthened the discussion of the conflict of the two ideologies presented in the novel. More over, an artist who turns recent events into fiction, cannot easily succeed; for the unconscious mind requires much time to per form its wonder of transmuting incident into art. If Mulk Raj Anand is a 'committed' artist, R. K. Narayan may. be described as a novelist of the middle class. His novels present members of the Indian middle class as engaged in a struggle 'to extricate themselves from the automatism of the past'.15 Though not vehicles of mass propaganda, his novels also depict the breakdown of feudal society and express the changed ideas concerning the family as a unit and the conflict between old and new. But Narayan is more concerned with the analysis of the character of the individual in his course through life. Vasu in The Man-eater of Malgudi and Raju in The Guide are examples of this. In both novels the character of Vasu and that of Raju are determined by their actions. They rise from humble beginnings to ill-gotten affluence and are overwhelmed by disaster through over-confidence and self deception. A consideration of Vasu in some detail perhaps illustrates this. Vasu is a giant of a man, a bully who has had his training under a famous phaelwan. He descends on Nataraj, who owns a printing press in Malgudi, and sets himself up as 17</page><page sequence="13">INDIAN LITERATURE a taxidermist. The otherwise placid life of the good printer is disturbed and his effort to get Vasu out of the attic of the press building further establishes his position as a tenant. In search of larger game Vasu threatens to kill á temple elephant. Nataraj's attempts to prevent the killing of the elephant are not in themselves successful, but the elephant is saved miracu lously when Vasu, to trap a couple of mosquitoes, bangs on his forehead with his fist and dies of concussion. Commenting on Vasu's death, Sastri, a friend of Nataraj, says: Every demon appears in the world with a special boon of indes tructibility. Yet the universe has survived all the rakshasas that were ever born. Every demon carries within him, unknown to himself, a tiny seed of self-destruction, and goes up in thin air at the most unexpected moment. Otherwise what is to happen to humanity!16 The action of The Man-eater of Malgudi is determined completey by the character of Vasu. His removal from the scene alone restores the normal life of Nataraj and his friends. The story also makes it clear that Narayan's conception of life is an essentially Hindu one in that he shows through the story as in Hindu classical writings that 'Dharma protects those who protect Dharma and Dharma destroys those who try to destroy Dharma' (The Gita). Nataraj tries his best to throw Vasu out of his world, but all his attempts are in vain. However, the solution comes on its own. It is to emphasize this aspect of human life that Narayan makes Sastri comment on the death of Vasu and by implication compares him to a rakshasa. Narayan seems to have great belief in a balance of power in human relationships. In an earlier novel, Mr. Sampath, writing about a very level-headed character, Srinivas, Narayan says: His mind perceived a balance of power in human relationships. He marvelled at the invisible forces of the universe which maintained this subtle balance in all matters. It was so perfect that it seemed to be unnecessary for anybody to do anything. For a moment it seemed to him a futile and presumptuous occupation to analyse, 18</page><page sequence="14">INDIAN ENGLISH! AND INDO-ANGLIAN FICTION criticize and attempt to set things right anywhere ... If only one would get a comprehensive view of all humanity, one would get a correct view of the world: things being neither particularly wrong nor right, but just balancing themselves.17 Narayan's portrayal of Raju in The Guide leads the novelist to the Verge of a treatment of the theme of man in his relationship with God, but he, however, seems to evade it deliberately at the end of the novel. Raju's character develops because of certain events and the events in turn change his character till he finds himself a saint, willy-nilly, fasting to induce rain for the drought-affected village in response to the expectations of a crowd of admirers and worshippers. He spoke to them on godliness, cleanliness, spoke on Ramayana, the characters in the epics; he addressed them on all kinds of things. He was hypnotized by his own voice; he felt himself growing in stature as he saw upturned faces of the children shining in the half light when he spoke. No one was more impressed with the grandeur of the whole thing than Raju himself.18 Raju plays his part so well that a stage is reached when he is compelled to undertake a fast to bring rain to the rainless village. Realising what he is in for, he confesses his story to Velan and hopes that he will no more be regarded as a saint. But ironically enough Raju's confession only confirms Velan's faith in his saintliness. And Raju assumes the role of a martyr. Narayan leaves blissfully vague whether Raju's saintliness is an imposture or a real oneness with the Absolute. Though Narayan is 'a moral analyst', yet the emphasis in his novels is not on man's relation to himself. Actually there are no Indo-Anglian novels entirely devoted to a study of human destiny and of the human predicament. No Indo Anglian novel looks at the world as a basically sick society. This is because in India, unlike in Europe or America, writers have not begun to face a crisis of culture; nor do they deeply involve themselves in the confusions and anxieties which beset their counterparts in Europe. Only when the writer is faced 19</page><page sequence="15">INDIAN LITERATURB with uncertainty, irrationality and an oppressive sense of the sickness of society, will he turn to the psyche of the individual and make an exploration of man's hidden motivation to find meaning in life. The Indo-Anglian novelist by and large writes in the classical tradition and makes a search for an integrated view of man's identity, his place in the society he belongs to and the social values within which he works out his destiny. This is so in Anand Lall's Seasons of Jupiter in which a feeble attempt is made to deal with the theme of man's quest for peace and happiness and his destiny. Perhaps Anita Desai is an exception to this; for if in her Cry, the Peacock we have the exploration of the human psyche in Maya's self-examination, in her Voices in the City there is the delineation of a world-weary character. In both these novels she seems to have renounced the larger world in favour of the inner man. In Voices in the City, she creates a rebel in Nirode who is poetic, fanciful and isolated and has reached a disillusioned maturity. He (Nirode) himself knew by instinct that he was a man for whom aloneness alone was the sole natural condition, aloneness alone worth treasuring.19 Nevertheless, it cannot be said that Anita Desai has successfully brought out in this novel the characteristic feature of a modern city-dweller's outlook, namely his ambivalence towards himself and towards what is happening to his life and the life about him. Another rather satisfying novel on the theme of loneliness is Arun Joshi's The Foreigner. Joshi has chosen a typically apt story for the treatment of the theme. Sindi Oberoi who narrates his own story does not belong to any country in particular. Born in Kenya of a Hindu father and a European mother, he studied in London and Boston and chose to come to India in his search for peace. He says: Somebody had begotten me without a purpose and so far I had 20</page><page sequence="16">INDIAN ENGLISH AND INDO-ANGLIAN FICTION lived without a purpose, unless you could call the search for peace a purpose. Perhaps I felt like that because I was a foreigner in America. But then what difference would it have made if I had lived in Kenya or India or any other place for that matter. It seemed to me that I would still be a foreigner. My foreignness lay within me and I couldn't leave myself behind wherever I went.20 Nirode in Voices in the City does not face the problem of rootlessness; for his loneliness is born out of a revolt against his own people and society. But Sindi Oberoi's alienation is the result both of a lack of mooring and of the loneliness of the soul. "What to the traditional Hindu is the sheet-anchor of his life has no meaning for Sindi Oberoi. He himself is aware of it and says: You had a clear cut system of morality, a caste system that laid down all you had to do. ^You had a God; you had roots in the soil you lived upon. Look at me. I have no roots. I have no system of morality.21 But then what is the mainstay of the uprooted, lonely man in his search for the meaning of life? Arun Joshi attempts to give an answer through the hero of his novel. Early in lift- it dawns on Sindi Oberoi: 'All love—whether of things or persons or oneself—was illusion and all pain sprang from this illusion. Love begot greed and attachment, and it led to possession.'22 He himself practises detachment in life, but for a time he misses the positive content of detachment which consists in actually getting involved. And when he realises that detachment is not merely negative but also positive, he comes to believe that detachment consists of right action and not escape from it. The concept of detachment which Arun Joshi expounds through Sindi Oberoi is almost the same as Aldous Huxley's concept of non-attachment. Huxley says: The ideal man is the non-attached man ... Non-attached to his bodily sensations and lusts. Non-attached to his craving for power and possessions ... Non-attachment is negative only in name. 21 2</page><page sequence="17">INDIAN LITERATURE The practice of non-attachment entails the practice of all the virtues. It entails the practice of charity ... It entails the practice of courage... It entails the cultivation of intelligence ... It entails the practice of generosity and disinterestedness ... Non-attachment imposes upon those who would practise the adoption of an intensely positive attitude towards the world ... The non-attached man is one who, in Buddhist phraseology, puts an end to pain; he puts an end to pain, not only in himself, but also, by refraining from malicious and stupid activity, to such pain as he may inflict on others. He is the happy or 'blessed' man as well as the good män.23 The twentieth century man tends to reject intellectually the cruder forms of anthropomorphism. There is in him a mount ing disbelief. This has resulted in an attempt in Indian philo sophical writings to redefine man's relation to the supernatural or the Absolute in terms consistent with modern thought. But in Indo-Anglian fiction, to my knowledge, Raja Rao is the only Writer who has turned his serious aftention to this problem. In his The Serpent and the Rope, he regards Hinduism as providing a basis for reconciling scientific thought with basic religious beliefs. Ramaswamy, the hero of the novel, is the interpreter of Hinduism in comparison with other religions and philoso phies.. A scholar and historian, and above all a vedantin, he is a seeker after metaphysical truth—the truth of birth and death and that which is before birth and after death, the truth of man discovering his Godhead. Ramaswamy establishes his relationship with the Absolute through having sought and secured an inner harmony—a harmony with his inner self. There is no negation in his life. For him, all is harmonised. To him, 'Marxism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Hitlerism, the British Commonwealth, the Republic of the United States of America, all are so many names for some unknown principle, which we feel but cannot name. For all the roads, as the Gita says, lead but to the Absolute !'24 It may also be pointed out here that Raja Rao's success in the novel is mainly due to the fact that the spiritual autobiography of Ramaswamy is indeed 22</page><page sequence="18">INDIAN ENGLISH AND INDO-ANGLIAN FICTION an expression of Raja Rao's own spiritual quest. In his novel The Cat and Shakespeare too, Raja Rao is meta physical. His achievement in the novel does not come any where neac that in The Serpent and the Rope. The 'cat' in the novel is supposed to refer to marjara kishora nyaya (i.e., the kitten principle) which is followed by the devotees of the Visishtadwaita school of thought. The principle is based on the blissful manner in which the helpless kitten surrenders itself utterly to its mother and is well taken care of and therefore means that the devotee who adopts an attitude of self-surrender to the Creator need have no fears about himself or his near and dear ones in the world. Most of the Indo-Anglian novels are concerned with an examination of the problems of an agrarian, tradition-oppressed society struggling to free itself from poverty and follow the road to prosperity and modernity without losing its hold on its mores. As a result, though man in his relation to society-is either directly or obliquely dealt with in these novels, yet man's relationship with himself and with God has not become a common enough theme. The themes of hunger, social inequa lities and iniquities, the movement for independence, the con frontation of East and West, race relations and interpersonal relationships which have been popular with the Indo-Anglian novelists, have been exhausted and become stale and have lost their significance, today. This exhaustion of stock themes should be regarded as a healthy sign; for it will force the Indo Anglian novelist to engage himself in a search for the essence of human living. Perhaps this is inevitable; for in course of time as India becomes highly industrialized, the novels will have to reflect the struggles of men all over India to achieve order out of the new experiences and conceptions brought by the scientific theories and technological application and by the social and political changes that determine the direction of their lives and mould their hopes and fears. This means the novelists' main concern will not merely be an examination and revaluation 23</page><page sequence="19">INDIAN LITERATURE of society but also a. consideration of the nature of man and his place in the universe.
