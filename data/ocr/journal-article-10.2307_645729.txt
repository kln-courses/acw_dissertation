The Kalabari world is one of continual interaction of the living, the ancestors, the heroes, and the water spirits with carved and constructed images providing critical points of contact among these realms. As well as providing an avenue to Kalabari worldview, the duein fubara permit comment on Kalabari aesthet- ics which find application primarily in public dis- plays of dancing and costume rather than in ob- jects, which are secreted in sacred shrine areas as are the screens. At several points in the work, Barley discusses cross-cultural aesthetics and the difficul- ties in approaching Kalabari art. While the impor- tance of visual appearance which Westerners usu- ally associate with aesthetics may not be totally ap- plicable to these pieces, they do illustrate the "art of assemblage" which reflects a larger theme in Kal- abari culture, a culture which easily assimilates "foreign" elements. Barley suggests that the form and content of the screens may have been influenced by European photography (in contrast to an older suggestion of origin in the extraordinary bronze plaques which decorated the king's palace of the powerful Benin empire to the northeast). Although the screens seem to predate the introduction of photography to the Niger Delta, the relationship of such aspects of Eu- ropean cultures and indigenous cultures encoun- tered by European travelers, missionaries, and trad- ers surely needs to be better understood. The Kala- bari do view the screens' central figures as portraits of specific ancestors despite their highly stylized form. Although a somewhat specialized volume, this work serves as an excellent case study of how an artistic tradition reflects its culture and thereby pro- vides an excellent example of the value, to both his- torian and ethnologist, of considering a full cultural complex diachronically in order to understand a people and a process of acculturation. While Bar- ley's specific conclusions may be debated, his dis- cussion of the multifaceted interaction of European and Kalabari cultures is highly informative. This volume certainly belongs in any library serving pro- grams in art and anthropology as well as African studies. As we learn more about individual African cultures, I hope there will be more such tightly fo- cused studies. Sayings of the Ancestors: The Spiritual Life of the Sibundoy Indians. JOHN HOLMES MCDOWELL. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1989. x + 206 pp., photographs, ap- pendix, references, index. $21.00 (cloth). RAQUEL ACKERMAN California State University, Los Angeles The Ingano people in the Sibundoy valley of southwestern Colombia are at the juncture of three major cultural traditions: native Amazonian sha- manism, Inca Quechua, and Spanish Catholicism. Contemporary migration to large South and Central American cities has added to the array of cultural influences. Despite the syncretic nature of their cul- ture, their everyday life is guided by a vast corpus of proverblike sayings attributed to the first Ingano. These sayings in the Inga language-a dialect re- lated to Imperial Cuzco Quechua-have remained unchanged through the centuries, we are told. They provide key insights into the Ingano culture. Their first function is that of omens. They are used to foretell the future by helping in the interpretation of dreams and signs. In their second function, John McDowell regards the sayings as linking the present with the "ever-present ancestral past." The sayings bring an atemporal wisdom into the particular cir- cumstances of individuals' lives. Their third func- tion is that of accessing the otherwise obscure and hard to reach spiritual world. The spiritual world has a direct effect on the health of people. It is con- stituted by anthropomorphic, animal, natural, and fantastic characters. Close adherence to the moral principles of the sayings assures "spiritual health." Spirits share the ancestors' temporal sphere. It is through their ability to connect individuals with their ancestors in the past that the sayings serve as a means of making contact with the more inacces- sible spiritual realm. If the ancestors give advice as to how to behave in the world and interpret its signs, it is the spiritual realm that is responsible for the health and destiny of the Ingano. The sayings are just one door to the spiritual realm. Other insights are provided by the Ingano mythic corpus and by visions obtained through a variety of Amazonian hallucinogenic drugs. Two-thirds of the book is devoted to the compi- lation of 203 sayings and several myths. The sayings are grouped into two general categories-those that refer to dreams and those that refer to signs. Each of these categories is further subdivided into sets that share some element mentioned in the sayings. Each saying is presented in the Ingano language with a textual English translation. Some have an additional commentary made by Ingano informants, and oth- ers have comments made by John McDowell. McDowell claims that the sayings have "a logic and a frame of reference all their own, external to the human dramas to which they are applied" (p. 154), while at the same time "the spiritual life of the Si- bundoy natives [is seen] as a rational and coherent system" (p. vii). Regretfully, neither the "logic" of the sayings nor the "coherence" of the system un- derlying Sibundoy spiritual life becomes apparent at any point in the book. Rather these "logics" re- main opaque to the reader, probably due to the book's organization and the arguments advanced by the author. Moreover, insufficient cross-refer- ences among the sayings and poor indexing at the end of the book compound the problems. The data in this book are abundant. It has, how- ever, two serious flaws. Most of the sayings are de- contextualized from their conversational setting. The data lack a systematic presentation, and one is often puzzled by the purpose of specific informa- tion. These two flaws detract greatly from the use- fulness of the data. Livelihood and Resistance: Peasants and the Politics of Land in Peru. GAVIN SMITH.
