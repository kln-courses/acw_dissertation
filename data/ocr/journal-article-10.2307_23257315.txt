<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS The Star of Redemption, translated from 2nd edition of 1930 by William H. Hallo; Foreword by N. N. Glatzer (New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1970). Reviewed by Shalom J. Carmy In a thought-world cluttered with the credibility-gapped apologetics of too-traditional rabbis, made su perficial by sermonized glibness, co-opted by ambassadors of secu larism, biography has granted Franz Rosenzweig a place on the philosopher's Mount Rushmore re served for those whose lives are a commentary on their writing. Ro senzweig proved that it is possible for a modern man to remain a Jew and that "since possible, it is neces sary," in this, his inspiration to our generation. For many years the general reader knew only of Ro senzweig's life: his eleventh-hour decision for Judaism in the squalid shtibbel; his slow appropriation of mitzvot; his retirement from Ger man university life: his legendary triumph over physiological martyr dom; and his death at the young age of forty-three. Only recently has his major work, The Star of Redemption, been available to the English reader revealing the divari cating monologue of an omnivor ous and committed mind; hopeful ly a dialogue as well! Is Rosen zweig's lonely path another of the dead ends; or does it lead us back to the highway—forsaken? Rosenzweig elevated the Jewish people above the vicissitudes of history. The Christian world is a missionary world, a world of ac tion. It cannot pretend to Truth, for it is on the Way to Truth, pick ing up the dross of paganism as it flows forward in time. This permits us to view sympathetically the com promises of Christian doctrine with its idolatrous birthright; the Star is replete with such insightful at tempts as "ecumenical interpreta tion." Since one cannot be born a Christian, Christianity must be re garded as operating on a "natural ly pagan" original self: "I am not a Christian," said Kierkegaard: "I am becoming one." Engaged in the world of action, yet unredeemed, Christendom 135</page><page sequence="2">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought knows the judgment of death and the destiny of war. War, theorized Hegel (on whose political theory the academician Rosenzweig had written a long monograph), is the ambassador of progress, and all succumb to it, return to the dust from whence it emerged. The Jewish people seem to be a standing objection to this philoso phy of history. According to Hegel, the Jew's hour on the stage of his tory had ended by the time Chris tianity appeared.* Yet the Jew, standing in the wings, continues to be very much a part of the picture, as proved by the persistence of anti-Semitism, if by nothing else. The Jew, by virtue of his Jewish affiliation, contributes something intangible but valuable to the world. Thus Rosenzweig reached the conclusion that Judaism is eternal because it remains outside the re alm of history, never submitting to the law of growth and decay. The Jew bears testimony to the exist ence of a Divine destiny beyond this week's editorials and next year's inaugural address. For the Jewish people, standing before God, communal existence in the present moment becomes infused with eter nal significance. The price of eternity is the sac rifice of "normality." Exile is the normative condition of the Jewish people. The First Temple period is virtually viewed as a prelude to the Galut looming ahead in prophetic vaticination. If the Jews were a people like all others, we would also be doomed to the Hegelian slaughter-bench, and we would lose our transcendent role of witnessing to the nations. If this is the case, then even wholesale conversion to Agudat Yisrael couldn't save the State of Israel for Judaism! And were we forced, God forbid, to gather and found a political com munity for self-preservation, this would mean the end of Torah! Rosenzweig is wrong in assum ing that Judaism must, of necessity, be politically passive. The Bible presents the vision of a fulfilled Judaism in its own land, under its own law, speaking its own lan guage, and enjoying as profound a relationship with God as that dis covered by Rosenzweig. This is a fulfillment that includes the witness to the world that Rosenzweig sees as the historical destiny of Judaism. Such a phenomenon—an eternal people, in spiritual communion with each other and with God—would be miraculous, from the Hegelian point of view, regardless of the cir cumstances under which it occurs. Given our failure to live up to this ideal type of existence, Galut be comes the unavoidable strategy of God (cf. Ezekiel's "with a strong arm I shall rule over you"; and in these conditions, Rosenzweig's an alysis is helpful. Rosenzweig is jus tified in making an undesirable situ ation meaningful; but that doesn't make it desirable, certainly not normative. •For greater detail, see N. Rotenstreich: The Recurrent Pattern: Studies in Anti-Judaism in Modern Thought, New York, Horizon Press, 1904. 136</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews II But there is a deeper difficulty in Rosenzweig's analysis of Ju daism, one perhaps insoluble, save by life itself. It amounts to this: The institutions of Christendom are geared to individuals who are "on the Way," i.e. who are not capable yet of acting from the true theo logical perspective. Unable to ap proach God directly, he is granted the "tactical" luxury of the Media tor, always reminded (mainly by the unassuming Jew) that he is only on the Way. The Jew is the Eternal Fire; the Christian is the Eternal Ray. But how can the Jew keep from getting burnt? Defuse the metaphor; reformulate: Is it not the case that the individual Jew is also "on the Way?" Yet the in stitutions and religious forms of the Jew, according to Rosenzweig, are geared to express the intersec tion of the world, but he is also alienated from himself! Plagued by the inadequacies of all flesh, he must behave as if, qua Jew, he is a more perfect spiritual self than he really is. He must feign the spir itual identity he feels does not fit him. He is simply not cut-out to be a Jew! Judaism is "possible therefore necessary" for Rosen zweig; is it equally possible for any offspring of a Jewish mother? Rosenzweig apparently was not bothered by this. In his own case, the religious decision was relatively straightforward. He decided to re main Jewish, and gradually trans formed himself from an assimilated graduate student to an observant and aware Jew. Not recognizing the absolute, impersonal, bond of Halakhah, he quite possibly was not distressed by the possibility of another reaching the opposite posi tion (his own cousin chose to em brace Christianity). In general, Ro senzweig saw Torah-law as binding "as much as possible," leaving the definition of "possible" to the in dividual. A detailed and inconsistent ac count of Rosenzweig's understand ing of these issues is presented in his exchange of letters with Martin Buber, published as On Jewish Learning. That its "conservatism" is inadequate and unsatisfying from a viewpoint that totally accepts Torah-u-Mitzvot goes without say ing. Personally, I find the under standing of human nature underly ing his approach to be lacking in appreciation of some of the subtle ties and self-contradictions inherent to the human condition; I find a failure to come to grips with the Kierkegaardian gulf between con cept and reality, to recognize the porousness of all abstract cate gories. To do justice to this psycho logical variety one might need to become more radical — radically Orthodox. But this would take us far afield. What is clear, however, from Ro senzweig's account, is that the in dividual who accepts his Jewish destiny (or, for us, is obligated to accept it) must be able to integrate himself in a way of life that is naturally alien to him, and that this creates certain difficulties. We shall ignore Rosenzweig's remarks on the Blutsgemeinschaft because of the failure of this concept to explain Jewish consciousness, as much as because of the scientific and ethical 137</page><page sequence="4">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought dubiousness of the racist hypothe sis. Thus education becomes focal to Jewish existence, both habitua tion and sensitization to the spirit ual values of the Torah, and also to membership in a people, in an existing social entity, chosen to re alize the ideal community of men with men before-God. We should appreciate Rosenzweig's remarks on the role of the family-bond and communal prayer in Jewish life. Therefore we should also recognize the tragic dimension in halakhic life for those individuals who are incapable of full integration into Jewish society: the failure, the mamzer, the homosexual, the burnt-out case, yoked to the Torah by fulfillment-less obligation and the unsatisfying sacrifice. But even for those of us who are more for tunate, who have been properly educated and socialized, are too young to know genuine failure, and desire the halakhically approved sexual object exclusively, the ten sion remains. Perhaps Rotenstreich is correct when he claims** that when Rosenzweig speaks as a Jew he ceases being an existentialist philosopher; and when he speaks as an existentialist philosopher he does not speak as a Jew. On the one hand, one is a Jew by birth, and part of one's function as a Jew is fulfilled merely by re taining this identity. On the other hand, "becoming a Jew" is as chal lenging and difficult a task as Kier kegaard's "becoming a Christian." An Existentialism that could em brace this living contradiction with in its compass would need a great er reach than Rosenzweig's or, for that matter, Kierkegaard's. The paradox; that we inadequate indi viduals are to present Divine testi mony in the world. Surprisingly— and for the realist, marvellously— we have! . . . Ir&gt; limiting myself to this brief discussion of the crucial question of Jewish identity, I don't mean to ignore Rosenzweig's many aper çus on the Bible, the Calendar, Jewish and General Theology, Aes thetics, etc. The Star is a system of philosophy, an important transi tion from the ripe old-age of Ger man Idealism to contemporary sys tems of Existentialism. One might merely refer, in passing, to the sug gestive material on miracles, crea tion, prayer, religious language, and anthropomorphism. In his 1907 Diary at the age of twenty, Rosenzweig wrote to the effect that it is better to write than to read, better to write poetry than to write . . . and better to live than any of these. He is worth knowing well, and rewards those who spend time with him, even if the time is spent in reading. •• Jewish Philosophy in Modern Times (Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston), 1968, p. 210. 138</page></plain_text>
