Formerly we understood that bipedal locomotion freed the hands for making tools and together these two behaviors, bipedalism and tool making, enabled intelligent small-bodied apes to succeed as hunters. Though it has never been clear what forces drew those apes out of the trees, it appeared clear at the time that success in hunting drew them from the forest and out of competition with their relatives and, in this way, isolated them from the line leading to the contemporary apes. Today we have more information-more fossils, more sites, apparently more reliable absolute dates, more detail on com- ' An early version of this paper was presented at the 3d European Anthropological Congress, September 1982, under the title "House- hold Economics in the Pliocene." A revised version more clearly indic- ative of our concern for the exchange features of the emergent hominid family household was presented at the 3d meeting of the Society for Economic Anthropology, April 1983. The present paper is a revision of the complete text from which the SEA version was extracted.

Also, we have convincing molecular evidence of the close phylogenetic proximity of Homo sapiens to the African apes and a growing body of concepts, models, and data derived from ecology and applicable to paleontological reconstructions. At the same time, we are less certain of what most of us used to take for granted. We no longer know if the earliest hominids were hunters (Binford 1981, Brain 1981); we are not certain if they were tool makers (Lovejoy 1981); indeed, there are reasons to suspect that they were not yet entirely out of the trees (Tuttle 1975). The uncertainty is expressed in the current menu of speculative reconstructions that compete with one another as explanations for hominid origins (Isaac 1978a, b; Dahlberg 1981; Fisher 1981; Lovejoy 1981; Tanner 1981; Hill 1982). In view of all this uncertainty, it seems appropriate at the outset of any discussion of hominid origins to acknowl- edge that we do not know how the event took place. In this paper we want to talk about these reconstructions without adding yet another speculation to the menu. Specifi- cally, we wish to note some of the assumptions which underlie them and examine certain aspects of the exchange logic which is implicit in them. This examination leads us to offer two suggestions: one concerning the value of viewing hominid ori- gins from the perspective of exchange within small social units, the other concerning the usefulness of the concept of culture in defining the distinctive hominid niche. In an earlier version of this paper we compared four theories of hominization (Quiatt and Kelso 1983): a hunter theory, a gatherer theory, a dual reciprocal subsistence theory, and a supplementary feeding theory. Though distinguishable in terms of their central hypotheses, the theories all share two basic features. First, instead of juxtaposing cultural and biological change and trying to explain one in terms of the other, all four view hominid and human evolution as biocul- tural from the beginning, a matter of multiple causation and feedback. Second, all four theories postulate something like a social revolution at the heart of the transformation from a more apelike to a more human way of life-a new relationship, at the very least, between breeding males and females. All of these theories have their roots in Washburn's reflec- tions, beginning in the 1950s, on the implications of bipedal locomotion for hominid evolution (Washburn 1950, Washburn and Avis 1958, Washburn and Lancaster 1968). Washburn and his coauthors pointe'd out a number of ways in which cooperative male hunting might have influenced human evolu- tion. The hunter theory was subsequently simplified, codified, and popularized by others, especially Ardrey (1976), in a rigid, sex-biased form which has been challenged repeatedly. 207</page><page sequence="2">The gatherer theory was presented in part as Washburn's own correction of the hunter theory (Washburn and Lancaster 1968) and was developed further by others (see Zihlman 1978a, b; Zihlman and Tanner 1978; Tanner 1981; and Dahlberg 1981). It derives from the observation among contemporary hunting and gathering peoples that the plants collected by fe- males are always more important to survival than the meat obtained by hunting. The authors conclude from this observa- tion that, from the beginning, female gathering played a criti- cal role in human evolution. The dual reciprocal subsistence theory is an integration of the hunter theory and the gatherer theory; in fact, the latter two are sex-biased variants of the former. Building again on Washburn's ideas, this theory has been set forth most clearly by Isaac (1971, 1978a, b). Isaac presents a picture of the ear- liest hominids as emerging out of a complex of interdependent adaptations each element of which is foreshadowed in preexist- ing primate behaviors-occasional tool using, food sharing, bipedal locomotion, and meat eating. The primary evidence that all of these elements came together early on in human evolution is the presence of home bases at some of the East African sites. A home base is indicated when tools occur in the same location as the remains of different kinds of animals. The implication of such an assemblage, as Isaac sees it, is that meat obtained elsewhere by hunters was returned and exchanged for plant food gathered locally. The most significant feature of the dual reciprocal subsistence theory is that it postulates a regular exchange of nutrients by individuals, male and female, at specific locations where collection and processing activities were concentrated (Isaac 1978a). The other theories take for granted a feedback connection between bipedal locomotion, manipulation of objects, and material technologies which may or may not have been lithic. Thus, while sexual division of labor is implicit in all four theories, the dual reciprocal subsist- ence theory is distinctive in its emphasis on reciprocal ex- change, an emphasis, it should be noted, that involves more than merely a balanced affirmation of the importance of males and females in human evolution. Reciprocity, in this theory, is judged to be at the heart of a distinctively hominid dual econ- omy. The paleontological evidence for Plio/Pleistocene hunting and home bases has been challenged, especially in connection with taphonomic reassessment of relevant materials from both South Africa (Brain 1981) and East Africa (Binford 1981). This is not the last word on the issue. The nature of direct evidence for and against early hunting, let alone reciprocal exchange of food in some accustomed place, is such that it would prob- ably be unreasonable to look for unanimity in interpreta- tions. Nevertheless, the challenges remind us how little evi- dence there is to substantiate hunter-gatherer theories of hominization. Another and in some ways more serious criticism of these theories is that they proceed from group-selection assumptions, as a rule unacknowledged. What are the mechanisms of recip- rocal exchange? What are the selective advantages to the indi- viduals involved? Proponents of the dual reciprocal subsist- ence theory have tended to remain vague on the subject of underlying social organization even when attributing the ad- vantages of reciprocity to energy savings earned from in- creased organizational efficiency. Lovejoy's supplementary-feeding hypothesis emphasizes the social aspects of the hominid "revolution" more than do the others. Lovejoy (1981) insists that because the anatomical cor- relates of regular bipedalism are established in the fossil record well before the appearance of recognizable stone tools, we can- not assume that tool making was important to bipedal locomo- tion. Thus, the supplementary-feeding theory is essentially an explanation of hominid bipedalism as the outcome of an adap- tation to feeding: male protohominids, ranging more widely to begin with than females preoccupied with dependent off- 208 spring, are supposed to have been more efficient at transport- ing food home to mates if bipedal.2 The main value of the supplementary-feeding theory resides in the rigor with which it explains the benefits of the earliest hominid way of life in terms of individual selection and adap- tation.3 In primate evolution, Lovejoy argues, selection for singleton births and prolonged infant dependence appear to have limited the avenues by which individual females could increase their reproductive fitness. If the African apes today are analogous to the prehominid ancestor, for example, the lifetime limits of offspring per female would have been barely sufficient for replacement even under conditions otherwise favoring survival. (That this is a problem for apes was ob- scured for a long time by skewed sampling for both nonhuman and human primates, reproductive data for the former coming primarily from zoos and for the latter from a few groups of hunter-gatherers apparently characterized by inordinately re- sponsive demand feeding.) Obviously, reducing the birth inter- val offers a way out of the predicament, and Lovejoy suggests a way, one that does not involve group-selection assumptions, in which such a reduction could have been managed: pro- tohominid females who had their diet supplemented by com- muter males could have directed more of their attention (and more food) to their offspring and thus, by giving birth at short- ened intervals without depriving their still-dependent young of food, might have increased their reproductive fitness in rela- tion to that of females whose diets were not so supplemented. Similarly, so long as they were not cuckolded, contributing consort males might have improved their reproductive fitness in relation to that of their more promiscuous conspecifics. The supplementary-feeding theory has been debated at length. We would note only that it is the shortened-birth- interval hypothesis rather than the supplementary-feeding hy- pothesis that we find of particular interest. There is no neces- sary connection between the two, and it may be as well for purposes of analysis to disengage them. The important ques- tion is: under what ecological circumstances would selection, favoring one or another kind of behavior, have had as an outcome reduction in birth interval? We wish to look at this question in what we take to be the more generally acceptable context of the multifactorial dual reciprocal subsistence theory and see where it leads. We may proceed by examining birth interval reduction as an outcome of selection favoring several factors that constitute the hominid behavior system connected with dual reciprocal sub- sistence (see Isaac 1978b): (1) behavioral (and probably a mate- rial) technology, (2) plant and animalfood sources both impor- tant to diet, (3) sex-based division of subsistence labor, (4) bipedal transport, and (5) a home base and processing/exchange center, linked together by (6) reciprocal exchange in a dual economy, these behaviors constituting a basic adaptive "strat- egy" with advantages accruing directly to individuals (through increased reproductive fitness) and to the group (through en- ergy savings in system organization). Generally among nonhuman primates and specifically 2 This raises the question of how to account for food transport behavior in terms of proximate causation. Hill's (1982) suggestion that males exchanged food for "sexual favors" strikes us as oversimplified and unduly anthromorphic. Though we reject the supplementary- feeding hypothesis as insufficient, our view that the proximate condi- tions associated with nutrient exchange are best considered in terms of individual bonding and systems connections between reciprocity in various role activities (sexual, parental, economic) seems in accord with Lovejoy's proposal. 3 This is not to suggest that discussions of human evolution should always be phrased in terms of individual selection, only that unex- amined assumptions constitute dead ends. Group selection may have played an important role at certain junctures of human evolution, e.g., the advent of vocal language-given the exclusionary potential of that mode of communication (Quiatt n.d.). CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Quiatt and Kelso: HOUSEHOLDS AND HOMINID ORIGINS among the great apes, sexual dimorphism is associated with different but overlapping subsistence needs (Rodman 1979) and with different strategies of parental investment. Primates that forage as individuals are likely to differ by sex in their diet, if only in relative proportions of the same food (Galdikas and Teleki 1981). Such differences, with concomitant differ- ences in time spent foraging and in distances traveled in search of food, may be expected to have important implications for species whose habitat is ecotonal. Most paleoanthropologists have come to view hominization as an adjustment to life on the ecotone (forest-edge, lakeshore, or river-valley habitat) by creatures undergoing morphological adaptation to bipedal foraging. Ecotonal habitats commonly contain not only greater diversity of food species than do abut- ting habitats (e.g., the forest proper) but greater overall density of organisms as well (Odum 1971). Thus, while feeding habits and food preferences appropriate to an abutting habitat might make for slim pickings on the ecotone, increasing the number and variety of species collected could lead to significantly im- proved nutrition. If we accept the archaeological evidence for a home base as real, then three linked assumptions are basic to the dual recip- rocal subsistence theory: (1) that efficient exploitation of eco- tonal diversity and abundance call for coordinated scheduling of diverse search procedures and extraction/processing routines appropriate to the utilization of a wide range of food species; (2) that regular division of labor based on general differences in the collection of plant vs. animal foods would have been a major step forward in systematizing such complex foraging activities; and (3) that the lines of an original division of labor would have been set naturally by sexual dimorphism and by secondary behavioral consequences of reproductive role differ- ences. For females, constraints imposed by childbirth and nursing are more compatible with collection of sessile plant foods than with that of widely dispersed or mobile animal foods. But also, and more important from the perspective con- sidered here, the reciprocal aspect of the sexual relationship provides a ready basis for the exchange of different foods ob- tained through division of labor. What is "natural" about a sexual division of labor is not that men are born to hunt, women to gather berries, but that the reproductive pair bond provides a continuing basis for exchange between individuals who labor together and apart, with built-in mechanisms for promoting reciprocity and parity. When we plug individual selection considerations into the reciprocal-subsistence framework, reproductive fitness in- creases can be seen to derive from close cooperation between pair-bonded males and females in a complex partnership (seen in table 1). Pair bonding, which is a logical requirement of the birth-interval argument critical for males (who realize fitness benefits only if it is their own offspring in whom they invest), is TABLE 1 HOUSEHOLD ACTIVITY FUNCTIONS OF REPRODUCING PAIRS IN A DUAL ECONOMY ROLE BEHAVIOR Sexual Mutual cooperation Economic Dual foraging strategies Differential technologi- cal expertise Reciprocal exchange of nutrients Parental caretaker Different contributions to diet of offspring and to subsistence training congruent with sex-based divi- sion of labor Vol. 26 *No. 2 *April 1985 critical also to the functional implementation of that reciproc- ity in the system with which we are concerned. Praxis plays an important part in securing fitness benefits for individuals who perform appropriate roles in a pair-based dual reciprocal econ- omy. Active cooperation by breeding males and females in all three aspects of their partnership (table 1) confirms the pair bond and contributes to the development of a two-parent fam- ily system as an effective vehicle for economy in reproduction.4 This is a central point. We view hominization as a shift from one mode of subsistence (individual foraging) to another (the dual economy) through a systematic transformation of behav- ior components (table 1) conjoined under special (ecotonal) cir- cumstances. Reproductive fitness is increased for individuals who engage in such "hominid" behavior, and so is that of ecotonal populations (relative to like-species populations in abutting habitats) for which "hominid" behavior is func- tionally adaptive. Central to the shift, in our view, is the two- parent family and household, a domestic strategy which meets the productive, distributive, and reproductive needs of the emergent dual economy (see Wilk and Rathje 1982), giving rise to a new set of niche relations, a set we can call culture. Conventional models of family household exchange, whether biological or economic, have tended to focus on ge- netic and energetic investments of the reproductive pair (though cf. Becker 1976, 1981). But the transformation which interests us as cultural biologists-the shift from individual foraging to a dual economy specific to hominids-was too com- plex to yield many of its secrets to simply dyadic analyses of mating-pair activities. An effective exchange strategy within a household would seem to involve distinct contributions from, as well as benefits to, all those who belong to the unit. The nuclear family is a child-serving, child-centered system (Kelso and Quiatt 1982) inasmuch as it affords an increase in re- sources allocated to producing and nurturing offspring, but this increase depends on an organization (the household) which enables still-dependent offspring to make significant contribu- tions to family maintenance activities. Comparison of the human family, as an adaptive system, with the mother-plus-offspring units common to other species of primates points up the complementary aspect of the caretak- ing characteristic of the former. The comparison reveals that the human family involves (1) an increase in the number of at least partly dependent offspring and (2) a provision for allo- parental caregiving on a regular basis, some of it by siblings. While the contributions of baby-tending and errand-running to family subsistence may be difficult to quantify in precise ener- getic terms, most will agree that these are important elements in the routine operation of a household. In providing these services, juveniles and subadult offspring (while themselves learning the complex routines of bulk food collection, trans- port, and processing) could offer contributions essential to early hominid survival, and so, of course, could grandparents or unmated siblings of the mated pair, if we can think of, say, H. habilis as having a maiden aunt or bachelor uncle. None of this assumes anything like family conferences and family planning in the Pliocene, nor need it imply vocal or developed gestural language at such an early stage of human I The supplementary-feeding hypothesis assumes monogamy as the necessary reproductive context for males supplementing female and offspring diets probably because males could not be expected to con- tribute significantly to the nutritional needs of more than one reproduc- tive partner and young in a pretechnological state (Lovejoy 1981). From the perspective of the dual reciprocal system, in which tech- nologies are taken for granted, males could establish as many repro- ductive partnerships (or, from our analytic standpoint, two-parent family systems) as the technology, female tolerance, and male ability to forestall cuckolding might permit (not many, in all likelihood). 209</page><page sequence="4">evolution. Analysis of the logic of household exchange within and between families in societies characterized by sex-based division of labor should lead to an understanding of the extent to which group cooperation in a reciprocal economy can be modeled without assuming language. For some time now eth- nologists interested in the organization of work and basic sub- sistence activities have been putting together precisely quanti- fied data bases which allow rigorous comparative analyses of household economies in societies at different levels of techno- logical development. Archaeologists today recognize the household as "the initial and crucial point at which to study variability in the archaeological record" (Willey 1982) because "households are at the level at which social groups articulate with ecological processes" (Wilk and Rathje 1982). And stu- dents of nonhuman primate behavior for years have been mak- ing notes on what might be called preterminological kinship processes relevant to the study of household exchange, e.g., the ramifying influence of the mother-infant bond, the pathways along which innovations have been adopted, the predictable nature of troop fissioning and composition of postfission units, the integration of functionally divergent male and female dominance networks, and the character and circumstances of allo-parenting and "adoption" of orphaned young. A third and fourth generation of fieldworkers, methodologically sophis- ticated and oriented toward integrative eco-energetic analyses of nutrition and behavior, are currently amassing a wealth of information on species-characteristic food preferences and foraging patterns and, most interestingly, on hitherto unre- marked differences in these feeding dimorphisms (see Galdikas and Teleki [1981] for an informative review, the significance of which is somewhat obscured by a conventional and an- thropocentric theoretical perspective). As of now we do not have much reliable information on other matters equally ger- mane to an evolutionary analysis of household exchange: within-sex differences by age in food habits and general nutri- tion, the nature and extent of actual sharing and "tolerated scrounging" (a la Goodall's hunting chimpanzees-the felici- tous phrase is of course Glynn Isaac's) within and across lineal cohorts, and measurable benefits to parents of kin-based allo- parenting, especially by older offspring. Some of this is in the works. Primatologists ought to be encouraged to do more of it, and the integrative cultural-biological theory that appears to be shaping up around the concept of the household as adaptive strategy in human evolution may provide just the stimulus that is needed. The shift from nonhuman primate individual foraging to a dual subsistence economy appears to have been contingent on the development of a biocultural system characterized by regu- lar cooperation and reciprocal exchange within and among subgroups of close spatial and interactional associates in the exploitation of ecotonal habitats. It is this systematic coopera- tion that we have in mind when we speak of a household as an "adaptive strategy." What is involved is a complex of social, spatial, and material features, and it is useful to distinguish these when considering households from an evolutionary per- spective. From such a perspective, the emergent system de- pends on (1) the pervasive influence of the prolonged mother- infant tie on kin recognition via association and close spatial contiguity and (2) the hominid tendency toward differences in male and female diets, feeding schedules, and nonmaterial food technologies associated with sexual dimorphism. While the latter provides the basis for pair bonding and first-order exchange of nutrients, the former provides the structural framework for effective allo-parenting (essential to shortening of the birth interval) and, with incorporation of a male parent into the parent-offspring subunit, a more comprehensive sys- tem of behaviorally recognized kin in households linked by accustomed exchange behavior. From the standpoint of behav- ior evolution it would seem to be the household, as the base unit of dual reciprocal subsistence, that provides the context for "invention" of the specifically human family with its nexus of broader kinship ties, not the other way around-that is, there is small heuristic utility in thinking of individually forag- ing nonhuman primate consort pairs or mother-offspring units as little families in search of households. If the hominid family is a complex biocultural system from the start, then consideration of its energetic features ought to go beyond what might be called eco-energetic activities- finding and consuming nutrients more or less in situ. It should take into account as well time and energy expended by a family (and by classes of family members) in materials processing and technological activities (techno-energetics) and in the promo- tion and maintenance of the social bonds essential to reciprocal exchange (socio-energetics) within and between families. Thus analysis of household economies can provide the basis for a meaningful model of biocultural evolution within the order Primates (fig. 1-note that proportions designated therein are exemplary and arbitrarily set). Herein, ultimately, may lie the power of household analysis applied to human evolution. A household economics approach to the problem of hominization has several implications for anthropological theory and research. Three strike us as partic- ularly important and deserving of immediate attention: First, if the two-parent household is the appropriate unit of Prosimians Monkeys Small apes Great apes Humans Eco- energetic activities Socio- energetic activities Techno- energetic activities FIG. 1.

Such approches seem not to generate the interesting questions about important systems processes that we believe- and have tried to show-a more integrative approach can generate. Second, what is most significant in the changeover from individual foraging to the dual system is a thoroughgoing transformation of relations between early hominids and their environment, including conspecific social relations (which take on important economic functions). Ecologists today view the niche as comprised of a characteristic set of relations between a subject species and other plant and animal species and, of course, inorganic elements in the environment. Eco-energetics is the study of the energy transfers involved in those relations. We have suggested that the hominid and later human niche is characterized by high loadings of socio- and, especially, techno-energetic activities (fig. 1; see also Ruyle 1973). Any description of the hominid niche that is limited to eco- energetics in the narrow sense must be incomplete. In opposi- tion to this view is the claim that to label the hominid niche or any of its domains "cultural" cannot contribute to understand- ing of ecological relations. We take issue with this argument. It seems to us significant that those who make it have as their basic research strategy the application of optimal foraging models drawn from animal behavior to human hunting and gathering (Winterhalder 1980, Winterhalder and Smith 1982). We suggest that models developed to describe individual forag- ing procedures are simply inappropriate when applied without modification to human or to early hominid subsistence activi- ties (but see Smith 1983a for a more recent discussion of an- thropological uses of optimal foraging theory). This leads to our final point: If it is meaningful to view the two-parent family household as a basic adaptive strategy in the transformation from individual foraging to a reciprocal econ- omy, and if it is therefore useful to apply a household exchange theory (with data from contemporary and recent human sociocultural systems) to the reconstruction of early hominid group social life, then ethnologists can and must collaborate with primatologists and paleoanthropologists in teasing out the rules of biocultural evolution. Such synthetic, integrative col- laboration, involving "reciprocal exchange" among the subdis- ciplines of our common field, seems to us what anthropology is, after all, if it is anything. Comments by COLIN P. GROVES Department of Prehistory and Anthropology, Australian Na- tional University, Canberra, A.C.T., Australia. 12 Ix 84 The important point about household analysis, as the authors note, is reciprocal exchange. But between whom? There is too much and too little in this paper: too much in that reliance on Lovejoy's rather odd model of hominization is not necessary for the basic argument and distracts attention from the valuable points the authors have to make, too little in that the baseline from which households emerged is left ob- scure, and it could make a difference. The new model has been weighed down with some spurious baggage. First, neither the authors nor Lovejoy, from whom this concept derives, really demonstrate that a demographic dilemma exists. Clearly, to derive an estimate of apes' fertility from zoo data is misleading, and, as the authors suggest, we have obtained a clear idea of the real state of affairs only from field studies. But to state baldly, without substantiating refer- Vol. 26 *No. 2 *April 1985 ences, that the existence of a problem of low fertility in humans was long obscured by reproductive data "from a few groups of hunter-gatherers apparently characterized by inordinately re- sponsive demand feeding" will not do. Where is the evidence? Few enough hunter-gatherer societies have survived long enough for demographers to get at them, but are these sur- vivors necessarily abnormal in that they all, with one accord, breast-feed their babies at will? The evidence from these societies suggests that, far from having a problem of low fertil- ity, they may, like the rest of us, have been too fertile but in contrast to the rest of us took steps to counteract this. Yen- goyan (1976) argues, for Australian Aboriginal societies, that restricting population growth was the problem; while Dicke- man (1975) traces the extraordinarily widespread practice of infanticide in societies that include many hunter-gatherers. Another unnecessary aspect of the authors' argument is pair bonding. This term refers to a type of social organization, common among birds, rare in mammals, in which a male and a female are exclusively bonded to one another: the bond is only with difficulty dissolved and is such that it excludes all other social bonds, except of course those within the "family." Hu- man pairs are, with the best will in the world, not uniquely exclusive and are part of a wider network of social bonds. Moreover, the occurrence of polygamy equally argues against the view that human pairing is pair bonding. For Lovejoy early hominines must have been monogamous; the text of the present authors' paper gives this impression too (e.g., "Central to the shift . .. is the two-parent family and household"), but in n. 3 they do finally admit that perhaps it is not so after all. The important point here is that any household, polygamous or monogamous, is a hotbed of reciprocal exchange: between man and wife or wives, between co-wives, between collateral relatives, and between siblings. The authors are absolutely right to emphasize the one really striking demographic differ- ence between humans and other primates, the length of the dependency period: dependent children remain part of the household long after they would have left its analogue in apes, and the consequent increase in the number of siblings for each child adds again to the exchange networks that are bound to obtain. How, then, did these households originate? Are they in ori- gin the gluing together of formerly independent individuals, or are they a ritualization of a more flexible subgrouping system? If the former, then we have a much harder task before us, to reconstruct the processes by which the reciprocal exchange networks arose; if the latter, as I believe, then we have already in embryo these very relationships. A male chimpanzee does have, in theory, a fair idea of which his own offspring might be (Tutin 1979), and gorillas, too, have their not-quite-exclusive mates (Veit 1982). Individualize the consortships and make them quasi-independent economic units, and the household organization begins to emerge. The authors, then, have put their finger(s) on something important; I feel, though, that they have not thought through their innovation or analyzed it to the point where it achieves its maximum utility. by SUSAN G. HORNSHAW Department of Anthropology, University of Western On- tario, London, Ont., Canada N6A 5C2. 3 x 84 Quiatt and Kelso have presented an important and interesting set of ideas, both in their critical evaluation of preceding ideas about hominization and in their central hypothesis about household economy. There is considerable merit in beginning with the assumption of a biocultural adaptational and, hence, selectional process. They have strongly criticized the hunter, gatherer, and supplementary feeding theories, largely by point- 21</page><page sequence="6">ing out the gender biases underlying their interpretive mecha- nisms. Gender biases, though important, are not the only biases that enter into the situation. Science is, after all, as much a cultural category as economics, politics, etc., and as such recapitulates and reinvents the enculturation process, values, and interpretive styles of a particular ideological sys- tem. Introducing the concept of "household" into our thinking about the processes of hominization presents a stimulating di- rection in which to proceed, but there is no reason to presume, as Quiatt and Kelso do, that "household" implies a nucleated situation with one parent of each gender. At particular points in time, when copulatory mating occurs, we are clearly dealing with a pair bond, but this pair bond need not be extended in time. Hypothetically, the sex can be separated from the eco- nomics. Quiatt and Kelso state that the "nuclear family is a child-serving, child-centered system," but so, of course, is the non-nuclear or "extended" family. Furthermore, if we are talk- ing about adaptation and survival, a strictly nuclear household puts its children in a high-risk situation as the extended or non- nuclear family does not. One could postulate large groups of cooperating nuclear "households," but I think this would be begging the question. Western ideology tends to view many situations, including procreation, in economic and political terms. Why, for in- stance, must exchange be only dyadically reciprocal? Why can it not be seen as complementary contributions by, to, for, and from classes of individuals who are differentiated by both cul- tural attributes of gender and biological attributes of sex? Women can bear and nurture children; men do not bear chil- dren, at least in the biological sense, but they may nurture them. Perhaps "paleoreciprocity" took a different form than our current cultural notions might suggest. Women do not always have to be tending infants; women in cooperation with women can take turns much as we often see nonhuman pri- mate females doing. Men and women could be involved in exchange not just of different foodstuffs but of subsets of role behaviour such as baby-tending and the collection of both sta- tionary foodstuffs (gathering) and mobile ones (hunting). by ADRIAAN KORTLANDT Vakgroep Psychologie en Ethologie der Dieren, Universiteit van Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 127, 1018 WS Am- sterdam, The Netherlands. 7 x 84 It is not clear to me precisely what Quiatt and Kelso's paper is aiming at. However, its extremely anthropocentric approach to the subject and its disregard of comparative data on higher vertebrates in general may be confusing if not misleading. The authors seem to suggest (or at least to imply) (1) that the only (or main?) energy-consuming parental task is feeding the young, (2) that the development of a "dual economy" in a two- parent household is a specifically hominid phenomenon, (3) that the "extended family" in which nonparents share in rear- ing the young is also a specifically hominid phenomenon, and (4) that pair bonding is commonly a product or by-product of an instinctive sexual drive. All this is erroneous. I would like to make the following points: Parental care by more than one family member. Parental care includes nest building, incubating the eggs, warming the nestlings, territorial defense (to provide, among other things, food for the household), defense against predators, etc. These types of behavior occur among males in various animals rang- ing from invertebrates to mammals, including most bird species. Parental care is even an exclusively male task among many fish (e.g., the stickleback and the seahorse), some am- phibians (e.g., the midwife toad), and several genera of birds (e.g., many shorebirds) (Ridley 1978). In most genera that have a "dual economy," especially among birds, the male is predom- 212 inantly the one that chooses the site, defends the territory, and actively courts the female, while the female chooses the male, and both share more or less equally, as a rule, the tasks of nest building, incubating the eggs, and warming and feeding the young (Emlen and Oring 1977, van Rhijn 1984). In several genera, however, this "classical" role division is to a large degree, or even entirely, reversed. Among mammals, of course, the role of the father is more restricted because he can neither "incubate" the foetus nor suckle the infant. Never- theless, in the nidicolous taxa, bringing food to the nest and the young occurs among the males of several genera ranging, for example, from beavers to wolves (Kleiman 1977). Thus there is nothing specifically "hominid" about a two-parent dual- economy household. Similarly, participation in the protection, defense, and feeding of the young by older siblings, "aunts," and "uncles" occurs among widely diverse taxonomic groups, from ants, bees, and termites to jays, moorhens, ostriches, bats, wolves, and chimpanzees (Vehrencamp 1980). Again, there is nothing specifically hominid in this phenomenon. The reader may refer to any general zoological encyclopaedia (e.g., Grzimek's). "Love" and "sex." With regard to reproductive behaviour, laymen, psychologists, and ethologists alike tend to distinguish two motivationally separate systems of behaviour: the sexual "drive" or "instinct" and the parental "drive" or "instinct." Between these two there is, of course, a physiological link that results from fertilization, gestation, and the birth of the baby, but psychologically and ethologically they are usually thought to be really independent though interacting systems. Since about the turn of the century, however, sexologists have distin- guished two components within the sexual instinct in humans: a tender component (zartliche Stromung, Freud 1905), cele- brated as "love" by poets, writers, and lovers, which we may call "amorous love" or "amorous courtship" for present pur- poses, and an aggressive-submissive sensual component (sinn- liche Stromung), rarely celebrated but nowadays popularly known as "sex," which we may simply call "sexuality" (sensu stricto), "sexual courtship," or "copulatory courtship." The phenomenological difference may perhaps best be defined by the response by noninvolved casual onlookers: in a cinema, for instance, the audience will titter when intensive amorous fon- dling is shown but falls silent when unvarnished sexual be- haviour emerges. This provides an objective criterion for the distinction. Exactly the same difference in audience response may be observed when the actors in a documentary film are not humans but courting birds in the processes of pair formation and copulatory behaviour in nature. The interesting point, now, is that the tender patterns of intercourse among human lovers show remarkable resem- blances to parental behaviour towards infants. Kissing the lov- er's body is reminiscent of maternal cleaning by licking (as observed in all mammals), oral kissing resembles oral feeding by the parents (occasionally occurring among apes, with pre- chewed food, and widespread among carnivores and birds), embracing is like protecting the child from the rowdy be- haviour of other group members, and, finally, the use of di- minutive words between lovers is similar to the way parents talk to their infants. The same principle applies to many forms of courtship behaviour performed especially by birds during the pair-forming process. Observing such behaviour, a zoolo- gist experienced in evolutionary interpretation might guess that patterns of amorous love between adults are just deriva- tives of patterns of parental love toward the offspring. That is, from an evolutionary viewpoint at least (and possibly also from a motivational viewpoint), such amorous courtship behaviour should be interpreted as a precocious and preparatory exercise of parental care, in the same way that playing with a ball is for a kitten a precocious and preparatory exercise of mouse catch- ing. This interpretation is supported by the fact that this type of courtship occurs mainly in those taxonomic groups in which CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Quiatt and Kelso: HOUSEHOLDS AND HOMINID ORIGINS both parents care for the young. Thus the amorous partner appears to substitute for the forthcoming baby. The interpretations of laymen, psychologists, and, surpris- ingly, even ethologists have not followed this line of thought. Sex education today tends to overlook love or to consider it a kind of orienting phase of sex. Ethological theoretical thinking has been committed to the rather unfortunate concept of the so-called consummatory act and consequently has tended to consider all courtship by birds either as precopulatory be- haviour (Paarungseinleitingen, in the language in which ethol- ogy originated) or as a mixture of fighting, fleeing, and sexual components that spring from conflicting territorial and sexual drives. This system of concepts apparently has not provided enough intellectual leeway for a recognition of parental compo- nents in courtship (except, however, surprisingly again, in the stickleback). Freud (1905:98) went another way. In the somewhat inade- quate English translation of the Standard Edition (p. 223), "[The] mother herself regards [the child] with feelings that are derived from her own sexual life: she strokes him, kisses him, rocks him and quite clearly treats him as a substitute for a complete sexual object. . . . She regards what she does as asexual, 'pure' love." From a zoological viewpoint it would have been more meaningful and consistent, in my opinion, to conclude just the opposite, that is, that lovers regard one an- other with feelings that are derived from their parental life: they stroke, kiss, and rock one another and quite clearly treat each other as a substitute for a complete child object. There are in fact some very good reasons to reconsider the current concepts of "love" and "sex" in higher vertebrates and man: 1. As early as 1914, Huxley (p. 516) concluded that in the great crested grebe "the actions of courtship . . . are self- exhausting processes, not leading up to or connected with coi- tion.... I believe that the courtship ceremonies serve to keep the two birds of a pair together." Some decades later I myself found that, in the European cormorant, amorous courtship and copulatory courtship largely share the same overt motor patterns but have different internal driving mechanisms and are occasionally focused upon different mates. Furthermore, the sequential development of amorous behaviour in these birds may precede or lag behind that of sexual behaviour, thus causing sexual monogamy or sexual promiscuity respectively. Amorous courtship ends when the marital bond has been formed, which is usually when the eggs are laid, i.e., when true parental behaviour starts, whereas copulating may or may not continue for some time thereafter. Apparently the be- havioural mechanism of the pair-bonding process is sequen- tially linked with incubation, whereas that of copulatory be- haviour is less so (Kortlandt 1949, 1959, n.d.). I presume that much the same applies to humans and may also have applied to hominids in palaeotimes. 2. With some oversimplification, one generally finds that those animal species that have a highly specialized and energy- demanding foraging technique and that consequently must produce small eggs and/or small and helpless young relative to their body size build a nest or burrow or den and have evolved extensive parental care, often by both parents. This applies especially to birds because, as mentioned already, mammalian males are handicapped by being unable to produce milk. Again with some oversimplification, one finds the most exten- sive amorous courtship and the best-established (albeit sea- sonal) monogamy among those genera whose offspring require the most extensive parental care, for instance, in insectivorous, fish-eating, and raptorial birds, in a somewhat different way in wolves, and in humans (Kortlandt 1955-56). Such behaviour is not shown, as a rule, by those animal species whose young do not require paternal care. Obviously the biologically most essential feature of monogamy is not sexual faithfulness but parental faithfulness by a dedicated and energetic father. The Vol. 26 *No. 2 *April 1985 mechanism of pair formation that produces this faithfulness is quite simple: the female behaves childishly, begs for food, etc., and thus elicits in prospective mates precocious parental be- haviour. She then chooses the most active protector, courter, nest builder, and feeder and consequently secures a capable and energetic father for her offspring (Kortlandt 1949, n.d.). All this still leaves open how it happens that, in our time, laymen, psychologists, and ethologists alike tend to consider human amorous courtship sexual rather than precocious pa- rental behaviour. Part of the answer may be that Victorian morals rejected the notion that "love" and "sex" were motiva- tionally to some extent independent. This explanation may even apply to ethological theories on the subject; these scien- tists tend to be somewhat anthropomorphic when they study birds rather than sticklebacks. Another part of the answer might be that, in the course of the evolution of reproductive behaviour, the instinctual mechanisms underlying amorous courtship have been motivationally "emancipated" (Tinbergen 1952) from the parental system and linked with the sexual system in certain taxonomic groups, including the hominids. The idea might be tested by fact-finding comparative studies on birds. 3. The foregoing considerations provide some clues for guess- timating the time period during which amorous courtship and parental monogamy evolved in the hominid lineage. Judging from the analogies with nonhuman animals, the major shift should probably have taken place when the hominids evolved from opportunistic small-game hunters and gatherers into cooperative big-game hunters and gatherers. Accepting the in- crease of large-game bones and the Pelorovis find in Middle and Upper Bed II at Olduvai (Leakey 1971:260-62) as indications of cooperative big-game hunting with spears (Kortlandt 1980:87), the major shift may have occurred around 1.5 million years ago. Another clue might be the decrease of sexual dimorphism in hominid evolution, because, among birds and nonhuman mam- mals, an increase in the parental share of the father tends to be correlated with a decrease of sexual dimorphism (contra Quiatt and Kelso). I doubt, however, whether the available fossil mate- rial is sufficient to date a time period of accelerated decrease of hominid sexual dimorphism. So much for my review of the contributions that compara- tive zoology, ethology, and psychology may make to the prob- lem of the origins and evolution of hominid family life. Such contributions will be effective and fruitful, however, only if there is more multidisciplinary open-mindedness among zoologists, ethologists, psychologists, psychoanalysts, an- thropologists, archaeologists, and the like. My 46 years of ex- perience with scientists in these fields makes me rather pessi- mistic about the prospects for such open-mindedness. The content of Quiatt and Kelso's paper only confirms this pessi- mism: it ends with a plea for exchange of data, but where and what are the data they wish to exchange? by W. C. MCGREW Department of Psychology, University of Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland. 24 Ix 84 This is yet another speculative scenario on human origins to add to the many others now available (as cited by the authors). Speculation is good fun, but in this case much of the argument sounds familiar, giving the impression of a reshuffling of the same old deck of cards. Of course, as facts accrue, reshuffles (and new deals) are needed, but the authors seem a bit pushed to produce a novel hand. For example, are there really four theories of "hominisation" here? The male hunter theory is long gone, but in any event, Washburn always recognised the contribution of gathering. Similarly, the gathering theory has always been presented with complementary hunting. Both are 213</page><page sequence="8">versions on a continuum of dual reciprocal subsistence theory, as the authors acknowledge, and is not the supplementary feeding theory just a subset of the rest? Rather than seek to counter speculation with speculation, my comments from here on will try to focus on matters of fact: 1. Quiatt and Kelso make a serious charge in stating that previous theorists have proceeded from group-selectionist as- sumptions. This needs substantiating and does not apply in all cases (McGrew 1979, 1981). 2. Contrary to the authors' claims about the reproductive potential of African apes, there are quantitative data which show them in a better light (Tutin 1980:54-55). A typical female produces five or six offspring that survive to weaning and probably two or three that survive to adulthood; an aver- age male is likely to achieve about seven impregnations. Both of these comfortably exceed replacement rates. 3. The authors' proposition that early hominids are "not certain" to have been tool makers and only "probably" had a material culture seems very cautious. Given that all known populations of wild chimpanzees subject to long-term study have proven to be tool makers (e.g., Beck 1980:111-14), it would seem most paradoxical if early hominids did not. 4. The splitting of energetics into three types (eco-, socio-, techno-) runs counter to the whole point of ecological ener- getics, which is synthetic, in terms of the common currency of calories. In any case, phylogeny is a poor guide, despite the authors' figure 1; for example, acorn woodpeckers store food communally (eco-), rear young cooperatively (socio-), and exca- vate family home-sites (techno-) (Stacey 1984). 5. It may be that ecotonal habitats provide special circum- stances, but there is nothing uniquely human about their ex- ploitation. Chimpanzees do the same, even in "techno- energetic" activities (McBeath and McGrew 1982). Are there any data which show higher reproductive success for primate populations (human or nonhuman) living in ecotonal as op- posed to "abutting" habitats? 6. The discussion of the family here fails to take account of the marmosets and tamarins (Kleiman 1978), whose familial adaptation is impressive even in the authors' terms: callitrichid monkeys have secondarily evolved twinning as a norm and show extensive caretaking of young by father and older sib- lings, to the extent that the mother conceives postpartum. This means that she carries two in utero while she suckles two more-an energy-budgeting achievement made possible by fa- milial cooperation. 7. The crucial point of the authors' case would seem to be "the concept of the household as [an] adaptive strategy in hu- man evolution." It is not clear to me how this concept accords with the existence in the Callitrichidae of an extended family, cooperative child rearing (including food sharing), communally defended and worked resources (such as gum trees), and a permanently occupied nest-hole home base. by MARTIN K. NICKELS Department of Anthropology, Illinois State University, Nor- mal, Ill. 61761, U.S.A. 27 IX 84 Quiatt and Kelso view the "dual reciprocal subsistence theory" as the preferable model for understanding the hominization process, "i.e., the transformation from individual foraging to dual reciprocal subsistence." They see the "two-parent house- hold," with its sexual division of subsistence labor coupled with reciprocal food exchange, as the "base unit" of this pro- cess. I think they may be making too big a conceptual leap from individual foraging to male-female division of labor and food exchange when there may be an intermediate step in this process, one that involved the presumably already existing fe- male social networks of the protohominids. Such an interven- ing stage seems at least plausible to me in light of the following: First, female social networks exist in some variety and com- 214 plexity in many primates (Hrdy 1981). They frequently center around mothers with offspring and involve cooperative par- enting and other coordinated activities. Second, fess mobile females and subadults in present-day hunting and gathering societies are extremely successful in obtaining the highly nutri- tious vegetable foods that comprise most of the food eaten by the group (Lee 1984). Such success involves cooperation, but it is cooperation between the females of the group, not between males and females. Third, while the authors claim that there is uncertainty about the archaeological evidence for Plio/ Pleistocene hunting and home bases, there is good evidence for the butchering of carcasses obtained through scavenging (Ship- man 1984). This need not have been done only by males and clearly does not necessitate a sexual division of subsistence labor. In the context of the hominization process, why couldn't the "efficient exploitation of ecotonal diversity and abundance" that the authors cite as leading to the dual reciprocal subsis- tence system involving a sexual division of labor actually have led to greater cooperation and an exchange of food (possibly including trapped and/or scavenged meat) between the mem- bers of an already existing female social network? Quiatt and Kelso acknowledge that allo-parenting or "aunt- ing" behavior exists in nonhuman primates. Hrdy (1981:98 and 217) documents that this practice, in which females other than the mother care for her infant, has been seen to free the mother for unencumbered foraging on occasion. It seems probable that food sharing between these "allo-mothers" would have pre- ceded the addition of the male to the mother-infant relation- ship, creating the more complex subsistence economy sug- gested by the authors. It appears that they are close to suggesting this themselves in their emphasis on the importance of the "prolonged mother-infant tie" and its provision of "the structural framework for effective allo-parenting" (by which, of course, they mean the introduction of the male into the mother-infant relationship). I am merely suggesting that such allo-parenting would have been less likely to occur than would an elaboration of the allo-mothering that already exists to some degree in many primates. It is even possible that the reduction of the birth interval that Quiatt and Kelso find so useful for their thinking took place within a food-sharing female social network. If such a network were comprised of genetically closely related females, then the selective advantages of allo-mothering and food sharing would have accrued to individuals sharing many of the same genes- an idea referred to as "inclusive fitness" in sociobiological terms. If it is premature to introduce the male as a cooperative parent and food exchanger at this early stage of hominization, then the question is when this distinctive human pattern did emerge. Perhaps our characteristic sexual division of subsis- tence labor combined with reciprocal food exchange did not arise until the advent of systematic, more energy-expensive, time-consuming, and less reliable hunting patterns. Such pat- terns, of course, are most extensively associated with Homo erectus. Since this form is much later than the early hominid forms Quiatt and Kelso are referring to, my suggestion puts a different temporal perspective on the origin of both the dual reciprocal subsistence pattern and the human household. I offer these thoughts in the form of a "friendly amendment." by JOHN F. OATES Department of Anthropology, Hunter College, 695 Park Ave., New York, N.Y. 10021, U.S.A. 22 ix 84 I admire Quiatt and Kelso's attempt to get a new perspective on human origins by integrating some of the differing perspec- tives of different kiinds of anthropologists, but as a primate ecologist I find myself in disagreement with parts of their anal- ysis. I do agree that the two-parent family and household has considerable significance as an adaptive unit in our species -at CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Quiatt and Kelso: HOUSEHOLDS AND HOMINID ORIGINS least in contemporary Western industrial societies. It seems far from clear to me, however, that such households (even if mildly polygamous, as permitted in Quiatt and Kelso's n. 3) characterized early Homo, let alone the earliest hominids, whoever they may have been. If the level of human evolution being discussed is that at which the first effective bipeds appeared, then I see no evi- dence to support the argument that one of the crucial behav- ioral features of these bipeds was the tendency to live in two- parent households. At least, there seems to be no evidence that the fossils generally called Australopithecus afarensis are the remains of creatures that lived in such societies. There is no good evidence to support the assumption implicit in Lovejoy's (1981) argument that A. afarensis females had shorter birth intervals than their more apelike contemporaries, nor is there good evidence that "provisioning" was a significant part of an early hominid feeding strategy. In discussing the nature of past events leading to the emergence of human beings we must obviously be careful to make clear what we mean by "human" and "hominid. " Do we mean any human-like primates, includ- ing apes (Szalay and Delson 1979)? Do we mean something bipedal, with teeth similar to our own (and perhaps a larger brain too)? Or do we mean a primate that exhibits not only some of these anatomical features but also social behavior and subsistence patterns similar to those of Homo sapiens? Having decided what level of organization, or grade, we will call hominid, we must obviously be careful not to assume that it has all the features of lower levels in our classification. As Quiatt and Kelso say, all the theories of hominization they review postulate some sort of social revolution, a new relationship between males and females. But does hominiza- tion have to involve social revolution? If bipedal locomotion and partial dental modification were the earliest unique fea- tures of unquestioned hominids (Lovejoy 1981), then we might reasonably assume that changes in locomotion and diet were crucial factors in hominization. Changes in social behavior might have accompanied these other changes, but there is no special reason to assume that they would have been revolution- ary. A model of hominid origins not reviewed by Quiatt and Kelso is that a drying climate in the Miocene changed the pattern of distribution of our ancestors' food supply, selecting for a new combination of locomotor and feeding techniques: bipedal locomotion between trees, combined with vertical trunk climbing and arboreal feeding (Prost 1980, Rodman and McHenry 1980). Although man walking between lunch and dinner is a more prosaic concept than man the hunter or man the nurturing husband, it is at least consistent with some climatic evidence and with the significant role we now recog- nize food distribution patterns to play in nonhuman primate behavior. Combining the thinking of ecologists, morpholo- gists, and paleontologists, this model is a good example of the interdisciplinary approach to which Quiatt and Kelso give their support. by SALLY SLOCUM Department of Anthropology and Ethnic Studies, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, 4505 Maryland Parkway, Las Vegas, Nev. 89154, U.S.A. 14 x 84 I agree with the authors on the usefulness of viewing the house- hold as a basic adaptive strategy and the application of a household exchange theory. I disagree strongly, however, with the notion of a two-parent family. The most striking features of human, as compared with nonhuman primate, sexuality are (a) the difficulties and dan- gers of childbirth due to a combination of increased skull size and changes in pelvic structure related to bipedalism; (b) hair loss (leaving nothing to which the infant can cling) and the loss of grasping ability in the foot; (c) shortening of the birth inter- val as a way of compensating for the increased dangers of Vol. 26 *No. 2 *April 1985 childbirth; and (d) the loss of estrus and the development of continuous receptivity (linked to c above). These features sup- port arguments for the development of the household: the re- duction in female mobility, an increase in the number and the length of dependency of infants, and the importance of allo- parenting. It is not necessary, however, to make the leap from this to a theory of individual selection for a two-parent family. Even as late as Malinowski's fieldwork there was widespread lack of knowledge of the mechanisms of paternity. Not only has pater- nity been poorly understood throughout human history, but the family itself has been defined in widely different ways. The matrilineal/matrilocal family, with an important role for the mother's brother and a much less important one for the father, is by no means uncommon in our species. If we lay aside, for the moment, our modern preoccupation with the father- mother-child family structuire and think about the matrilineal/ matrilocal pattern, another sort of Pliocene household takes shape. It seems more fruitful to speculate that the developing hominid household structure was based on the common pri- mate mother-offspring pattern, in the following manner: (a) The mother shares food with her offspring, intensifying the already strong mother-infant bond. (b) With the development of dual foraging strategies the offspring begin to share food with those they are closest to: mother and siblings. Thus the groundwork is laid for dual reciprocal subsistence and house- hold formation without hypothesizing a two-parent family. This phrases the argument again in terms of group selection and eliminates any need to imagine a Pliocene monogamy. Monogamy has always been rare in our species, achieved sel- dom and then only by application of the most stringent cultural rules, which would surely have been beyond the scope of evolving Pliocene hominids. We know that the development of the adult male/female sexual and affectional bond is (along with fatherhood) an im- portant feature of our species, but we need not assume that it dates to the Pliocene or that it formed the basis of the hominid household and family. by EUCLID 0. SMITH Department of Anthropology, Emory University, Atlanta, Ga. 30322, U.S.A. 15 x 84 Quiatt and Kelso have provided a useful reformulation and integration of several different theoretical perspectives that have been part and parcel of our anthropological intellectual baggage for the last two decades. They have gone a long way toward clarifying these positions and charting a sane and sens- ible course for integrating the best features of each into a posi- tion that makes sense. There are some points that require clarification and com- ment, however. The most troublesome aspect of their thesis is that an implied monogamous pair bond is central to it. Al- though this is certainly a possibility, an equally likely alterna- tive is that a household began through the cooperative effort of a group of females who exploited the association of an adult male. We know the importance of matrilineal relationships in a variety of Old World monkeys and apes (see Wrangham [1980] for an interesting discussion), and we should be mindful of their potential place in hominid evolution. Given their ability to diversify foraging activities on the basis of age and repro- ductive status, a cooperating group of females could be an important force in hominid survival in the ecotonal habitat described by the authors. The emphasis on some degree of cooperation among females does not diminish the role of males in subsistence activities, but it does provide a firm core for the 215</page><page sequence="10">evolution of additional subsistence patterns as well as techno- logical expertise. Additionally, although Quiatt and Kelso acknowledge the role primatologists have played during the last decade in pro- viding new insights into the behavioral ecology of our closest relatives, they could have made their points more forcefully if they had specified more precisely the kinds of data that are needed to begin to test their theory. For my purposes, I would like to see them delineate clearly a set of hypotheses that could begin to shed some light on their notions. I applaud Quiatt and Kelso for their efforts and look forward to a dialogue that will help clarify the issues they present. Although the major com- peting theories they outline have certain commonalities, a series of testable hypotheses could be developed to differentiate among them. It is only through the integration of approaches from primatology, paleontology, and ethnology that we will be able to reconstruct the hominid evolutionary niche. by MARK F. TEAFORD Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, The Johns Hop- kins University School of Medicine, 725 N. Wolfe St., Balti- more, Md. 21205, U.S.A. 11 ix 84 Quiatt and Kelso's paper is a timely review of a subject that never ceases to promote discussion and debate. The authors are to be applauded for providing an organized summary of the various theories concerning hominization and also for present- ing their ideas in CA, where discussion and debate are en- couraged. While their household analysis adds new insights to our overall perspective on hominization, there is a very real danger here of trying to force the past into a mold from the present. As Potts (1984:347) has recently noted, "the study of human evolu- tion requires the ability to see . . . things that were not quite as they are today." The importance of the two-parent household would seem to be a perfect case in point. On would expect household analysis to provide insights into the lives of Homo sapiens. The question is, can it shed light on the lives of the earliest hominids? Here, the timing of certain events is of criti- cal importance, and in theoretical discussions such as Quiatt and Kelso's it is the timing of evolutionary changes that fre- quently becomes blurred. For instance, were home bases really a focus of social activity in the African Plio/Pleistocene (see Potts 1984), or did they become socially important only much later? Could the two-parent household really be the "basic adaptive strategy" for the earliest hominid hunters or scaven- gers (see Shipman 1983, 1984), or were evolutionary develop- ments such as language necessary beforehand? If the two- parent household appeared only relatively recently, then rather than a model of the way change occurred it may be nothing more than an interesting end in itself. by PETER M. WASER and RICHARD D. HOWARD Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Ind. 47907, U.S.A. 15 x 84 Quiatt and Kelso provide a refreshing scenario of hominid evolution based on individual selection. We have several com- ments, drawn from cross-species comparisons, on their as- sumptions. Sex-based division of subsistence labor. Sexual differences in diet and foraging are widespread in vertebrates and correlate with size dimorphism. However, diet dimorphism is not neces- sarily confined to populations in ecotones. For instance, sexual differences in diet equal or exceed those between species in Chalidris sandpipers in the Canadian tundra, Cercopithecus monkeys in West African rain forest, and Centurus woodpeck- ers on the island of Hispaniola (Holmes and Pitelka 1968, Gautier-Hion 1980, Selander 1972). Such niche divergence be- tween sexes is predicted either where interspecific competition 216 is lacking or as a consequence of size dimorphism caused by sexual selection (e.g., Carothers 1984, Clutton-Brock 1977). For most vertebrates, including primates, food items taken by males and females do not differ sufficiently to require funda- mentally different foraging paths. An illuminating exception is the eland Taurotragus: males browse more and graze less than do females; in heterogeneous habitats, males forage indepen- dently in pockets of woodland, whereas females prefer more open grassland (Leuthold 1978). Thus, in ecotones (or, more generally, in any mosaic of habitat types) dietary differences may lead to differences in ranging patterns. Plant and animal food both important to diet. Proto- hominids in Quiatt and Kelso's scenario are distinguished from other vertebrates not so much by the assumed sexual difference in diet as by males' efficiency at harvesting food sources as valuable to females as to themselves or more so. In many species with dietary dimorphism, including primates, (larger) males collect and can survive on a lower-protein diet than females. This phenomenon is a by-product of digestive physiol- ogy and the size scaling of feeding and digestive rates (Dem- ment 1983, Terborgh 1984). Only among relatively carnivor- ous mammals do males have a more protein-rich diet as a consequence of their size: for instance, male coatimundis (Nasua) forage for large invertebrates and small vertebrates, while female groups are more frugivorous (Smythe 1970). Patterns of mate preference. If the mating system of pro- tohominids was originally polygynous-an inference from size dimorphism-what conditions might have favored reduced polygyny (or monogamy)? Quiatt and Kelso suggest that fe- males favoring "parental" males have shorter inter-birth inter- vals (see also Lovejoy 1981). However, such a benefit must be weighed against the reproductive advantage that females pre- viously obtained when mating with a less parental and more polygynous male. After all, where polygyny occurs it does so because of reproductive benefits to both sexes, not just to males. In many polygynous vertebrates, successfully mating males are those that control access to high-quality resources. In such cases, each female and its young receive only a portion of the polygynous male's resources, but the amount received may still exceed that available from a more parental but less domi- nant male. An alternative advantage to choosing subordinate but parental males could be that they provide aid or resources more predictably over the long term. Increased reliability of aid from a male could increase offspring survival in a species whose young require constant and prolonged care. In particu- lar, if the duration of parental care was increasing during hominid evolution, the short tenures of top-ranking males might cause them to be less preferred as mates. Reciprocal exchange. Many male birds and mammals pro- vide parental care, including feeding their mates. Such aid is not generally "reciprocated"; however, males benefit reproduc- tively by increasing the survival of their offspring. Species with extensive male parental care-for instance, songbirds and canids-are typically monogamous, and sexes are similar in phenotype. Since the diets of the sexes are similar, neither sex can provide the other with "goods" it cannot collect itself. Quiatt and Kelso's protohominids are unique in the simultane- ous occurrence of aid giving with dimorphism in size and foraging capabilities. How this combination could have arisen appears to us to be a central question raised by their scenario. by BRUCE WINTERHALDER Department of Anthropology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, N.C. 27514, U.S.A. 12 x 84 In their penultimate paragraph, Quiatt and Kelso "take issue" with "any description of the hominid niche that is limited to eco-energetics in the narrow sense." It is well that they should do so. However, they attribute this misguided exclusion of culture to "those who . . . have as their basic research strategy CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Quiatt and Kelso: HOUSEHOLDS AND HOMINID ORIGINS the application of optimal foraging models drawn from animal behavior to human hunting and gathering." Winterhalder and Smith are cited as the errant authors, standing in "opposition" to the biocultural household-economy perspective presented in this paper. I suggest that the oppositions drawn here by Quiatt and Kelso do not exist. They have misread the culture-niche discus- sion in Winterhalder (1980), rather too narrowly defined the theoretical inspirations of foraging theory, and incorrectly im- plied that the latter is an approach incompatible with their own. The first two points are minor but worth correcting; the latter is more important because it seemingly isolates them from a strong complementary source of ideas. I will elaborate these issues in order. In my 1980 article I referred to a specific definition of cul- ture-structured, learned behavior-and a specific argument about the culture-niche relationship-that it would be impos- sible for several such culture-bearing hominids to coexist sym- patrically. Both the definition and the claim were central to Wolpoff's single-species hypothesis. I argued (p. 114): Culture-as defined above-is no more an adaptive niche available to only one sympatric species than instinct or quadrupedalism or sexual reproduction are adaptive niches occupied exclusively in a given loca- tion. The fact that early hominids were culture-bearing tells us nothing that is operationally important about their ecological niche; this re- quires reference to specific components of the niche. . . . Learned behavior is a way of adapting that does not specify a particular content to the adaptations.... This is to say only that one kind of highly generalized use of the culture concept is ecologically uninformative. Use (such as that of Quiatt and Kelso) which does specify the components or the particular content which the label of culture brings to the niche concept are valid-indeed, for hominid studies necessary. In contrast to the single-species hypothesis, I stated that "cultural abilities and initial niche generality would only facilitate the processes of niche differentiation predicted by the [foraging] optimization and selection models" (p. 118), and that "direct confrontation with the possibility of two or more hominid species, each with significant cultural abilities, may have de- cided heuristic advantages for hominid paleoecologists" (p. 119). Contrary to the Quiatt and Kelso assertion, this argues for viewing hominid ecological relations from the viewpoint of cultural abilities. Quiatt and Kelso then state that it is "significant" that forag- ing models are drawn from "animal behavior," as if this heri- tage confirmed the model's association with the reductionism that would deny cultural behavior to hominids. This allusion to source is partial at best, an important point because they use it to suggest separation where in fact there are close ties. Al- though frequently applied or developed by biologists, foraging models have origins in the same microeconomic theory that underlies the household economics studies cited favorably by Quiatt and Kelso (see Rapport and Turner 1977). It is worth noting that the individual-level selection concepts Quiatt and Kelso find useful are drawn from animal behavior to a like degree without being considered inimical to biocultural studies of hominids. In themselves, these two corrections are minor. They be- come important as the reasons Quiatt and Kelso muster to imply that foraging studies are in opposition to their own ap- proach. This is an erecting of redoubts where there is commu- nity. Two examples, both recent developments of foraging theory, will show why. Quiatt and Kelso rightly stress that "consideration of [the hominid family's] energetic features ought to go beyond what might be called eco-energetic activities-finding and consum- ing nutrients. . .." Drawing on foraging theory and consumer demand concepts, I have recently (1983, n.d.a) extended forag- ing theory to address just this issue. The model uses opportu- Vol. 26 *No. 2 *April 1985 nity-cost concepts to evaluate marginal trade-offs between foraging for food and participating in the other activities adap- tively important to an organism, including those that can be called socio-energetic and techno-energetic. Quiatt and Kelso also argue that the early hominid subsis- tence economy "appears to have been contingent on the devel- opment of a biocultural system characterized by regular coop- eration and reciprocal exchange within and among subgroups of close spatial and interactional associates." This is a plausible hypothesis, but evaluating it will require close study of the selective advantages and disadvantages to individuals of such associations in various social and ecological circumstances. Foraging-theory models are becoming available that will con- tribute to this evaluation (see Smith 1983b). For instance, one recent development has shown that risk-avoiding foraging choices predicted for a stochastic environment are quite similar to efficiency-maximizing choices predicted by simpler models which assumed a normative environment (Stephens and Char- nov 1982, Winterhalder n.d.b). An extension of these stochas- tic foraging simulations is now producing a detailed quantita- tive picture of the degree to which exchange (pooling and sharing of the catch) among independent foragers can reduce fluctuations of harvest. Models like this give us insights into one of the several individual-level adaptive advantages that may have influenced the formation of the groups Quiatt and Kelso predict. One can-as a student of foraging theory-ask limited ques- tions about evolutionary ecological topics and believe the an- swers to be both correct and important without also believ- ing-as an anthropologist-that they are sufficient and exclusive. Read and interpreted correctly, the papers and theory cited by Quiatt and Kelso in their next to last paragraph add an important component to more synthetic and integrative studies of hominid origins. The view of anthropological in- quiry offered in that paragraph and their final one may be better advanced by taking account of this work than by taking issue with it. Reply by DUANE QUIATT and JACK KELSO Denver, Colo., U.S.A. 20 XI 84 Our goal was to reformulate and reintegrate some theories of hominid origins "that have been part and parcel of our an- thropological intellectual baggage for the last two decades" (Smith). As McGrew notes, it is not really four distinct theories with which we were concerned but a continuum of perspec- tives on the same set of ideas, ideas which go back to Wash- burn's suggestion that when bipedalling apes began to increase the proportion of meat in their diet the course of evolution was powerfully influenced. The most important of those ideas, or so it seemed to us, and one common to the view from Wash- burn's and most subsequent perspectives, is that sexual di- morphism provided the original basis for division of labor and reciprocal exchange in a dual subsistence economy. We wished to examine the implications of this view that hominid evolution hinged upon, at some juncture, the system- atic transformation of one complex of subsistence behavior, individual foraging, to another, a subsistence economy involv- ing a general division of labor by sex in the systematic procure- ment of plant and animal foodstuffs, with reciprocity in subse- quent distribution. We were particularly concerned with clarifying assumptions about the eco-setting of this transforma- tion (why should it be assumed that life on the ecotone would induce division of activities within groups?); the character of exchange (what would be the facilitating individual-individual 217</page><page sequence="12">connections, how might cooperation in subsistence coincide with other role relationships, and why should one anticipate reciprocity?); the kinds of benefits assumed to result from specialization and cooperation in subsistence efforts (in terms of both individual fitness and efficient group performance); and what we take to have been the primary vehicle of change, the basic unit of socio-spatial organization and material articula- tion to habitat in which the behavior of individuals is trans- formed by processes involving both selection and learned adaptation-i.e., the household. In connection with this last, we especially wanted to suggest how the household might have functioned as a system promoting survival of offspring in con- junction with (assumed) evolutionary shortening of birth inter- vals. The reconstruction of human evolution necessarily involves speculation, and speculation is speculation however it is dressed out. Our approach was formal in the sense that we focused on functional-relational features of the hominid sub- sistence system in transformation. We avoided quasi- historical, particularistic scenarios, partly for concision, partly to maintain a consistent focus and an appropriate level of dis- course. To reconstruct behavior in evolution would have in- volved overworking the imagination, nor was it our intent to introduce a new, improved speculative reconstruction-only to review established theories, picking out elements we per- ceived as most valuable and linking them together via the analytic concept of the household. We will reply to individual comments as they appear, avoiding repetition as much as possible. Where we appear to belabor a point it will be with this in mind and to eliminate the need for subsequent recapitulation. Most of the comments seem to us critical in a positive sense, and we will try to keep our reply positive, clarifying and proposing areas of agreement rather than defending and denying. This of course will be easier in some instances than in others. Groves is undoubtedly correct in saying that it will not do "to state baldly . . . that the existence of a problem of low fertility in humans was long obscured by reproductive data 'from a few groups of hunter-gatherers apparently character- ized by inordinately responsive demand feeding,' " but that is not a problem we discussed. The problem we discussed was whether our apelike ancestors of the Plio/Pleistocene gave birth to singleton offspring that required close maternal attention and prolonged breast-feeding and whether the hominid way of life would have involved increased reproductive fitness via shortening of the birth interval, presumably in conjunction with effective allo-maternal care. This problem, we suggested, was likely to be obscured for anyone directing his or her atten- tion to fertility rates, on the one hand, of contemporary apes in captivity and, on the other, of groups of contemporary Homo sapiens (presumed beneficiaries of selection for shortened birth intervals) whose apparently prolonged intervals between births might be maintained in part by unusually responsive breast- feeding extended into the third or fourth year of life. Although we focused on this aspect of cultural behavior, we did not mean to suggest that nursing habits were the only factor affect- ing fertility rates, and it is difficult to see how Groves could have turned the familiar birth-interval issue with which we were concerned into a problem of low fertility in humans. Presumably he misunderstood us. He then foists a highly re- strictive notion of pair bonding on us in order to develop the point "that any household, polygamous or monogamous, is a hotbed of reciprocal exchange: between man and wife or wives, between co-wives, between collateral relatives, and be- tween siblings." We agree; to emphasize the complexity of the family household as an exchange system was one of our main objectives. We wonder why Groves thinks we may have hit on something important but not thought it through. Hornshaw finds the household concept useful but suggests that "there is no reason to presume, as Quiatt and Kelso do, 218 that 'household' implies a nucleated situation with one parent of each gender," and she wonders why we assume exchange to be "only dyadically reciprocal." We don't. As mentioned, our view of households is in accord with Groves's. Nevertheless, a particular pair of breeding adults predominates in many if not most extended-family households; affection and intimacy pro- vide a ready basis for exchange; affectional, sexual, parental- care, and economic roles of a mated pair involve reciprocity and appear to be mutually reinforcing; and, after all, at some level of analysis reciprocity must involve mutual exchange be- tween individuals A and B, whoever else may be involved. Interactions need not be simply dyadic, but dyadic analysis is not simply an arbitrary convention either; it can be very help- ful in getting at the ontogeny and development of social behav- ior, presumably in some part because of the way we are pack- aged, perceive one another, and handle transactions as individuals. We chose a dyadic approach not (we hope) be- cause Western ideology drove us to it but as a first approach to examining reciprocity within households-see our reply to Nickels, Slocum, and Smith for further discussion of the rationale. Kortlandt's comments are mostly tangential to our argu- ment, perhaps because (as he notes) it was not clear to him what we were aiming at. Anthropologists inquiring into the origins late in evolutionary time of a form of subsistence which they take to be (contra Kortlandt) distinctive and in its system- atic character diagnostic of hominids are in some sense com- mitted to an approach that can be characterized as "an- thropocentric." After all, H. sapiens is our primary study species, and it is the species to which in this instance we must keep referring. We have some acquaintance with the literature on other animal behavior, vertebrate and invertebrate, and we understand that there is a continuity in life which insures the repeated production of behavior part-systems in parallel. Though to say so will not relieve Kortlandt's pessimism about multidisciplinary open-mindedness in this quarter, we believe that catalogs of analogous part-systems selected from across the full range of vertebrate behavior shed but a dim, deceptive light on the specific evolution of hominids unless they are di- rected toward highly specific problems and selected with care to illustrate constant relations between behavior and habitat. No doubt the problem of communication here stems in part from competing strategies of evolutionary analysis. In any event, we can only deny that the first and the last of the errors with which Kortlandt charges us are ours and that the second and third are, in the terms set forth in our discussion, errors. McGrew's comments are germane and constructive, though his Sergeant Friday approach (weary and implacable-"Let's just stick to the facts, Ma'am") leaves us a little glum. We remarked earlier on the issue of whether there are "really four theories of 'hominisation' here" but would like to note in addi- tion that the establishment of categories for purposes of discus- sion is an ordinary, indeed a necessary, strategy of analysis. We think that a review of the literature will convince most readers that our categorical distinctions are not arbitrary. McGrew suggests that Lovejoy's supplementary-feeding theory is just a subset with the rest, but the reasons for except- ing it from a more general collection of hunter-gatherer theo- ries should be obvious: Lovejoy specifically excluded as ex- planatory factors both hunting and tool making in his discussion of hominization. We gladly except McGrew (1979, 1981) and, in advance, other individual-selectionists who believe that we made a "seri- ous charge" in suggesting that "another and in some ways more serious criticism of [hunter-gatherer] theories is that they pro- ceed from group-selection assumptions." This was a transi- tional generalization on the way to contrasting Lovejoy's ap- proach with those previously considered. We do not feel obliged to defend it (it was not intended to be read "all, without exception, until ye present authors"), nor do we wish to scout CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="13">Quiatt and Kelso: HOUSEHOLDS AND HOMINID ORIGINS out all exceptions. Readers must decide whether it is likely to have sufficient validity to make it useful in context. McGrew thinks that Tutin's (1980) calculations of the repro- ductive potential of chimpanzees show them "in a better light" than our discussion suggested. We disagree. As McGrew un- doubtedly knows, getting a fix on that typical female he sees as comfortably exceeding replacement rates is not easy. For the eight females at Gombe for which it was possible to estimate number of offspring surviving to adulthood, the median num- ber was 2 (range 1-3: Tutin 1980). Although this may be a conservative estimate, it is hardly cause for rejoicing. Nor, given the time depth of work at Gombe, is thiere more cheer to be derived from Tutin's observation that "the only chimpanzee male of known age at Gombe to have reached puberty was first seen to ejaculate when he was 9 yr 2 mo of age" (Tutin and McGinnis 1981, our emphasis). Still, we do not wish to cavil; McGrew's cautionary objections are well made. Tutin's work at Gombe, Harcourt's and Stewart's at Virunga (Harcourt et al. 1980, Harcourt, Stewart, and Fossey 1981), and Howell's with the Dobe Kung (Howell 1979) provide essential bases for comparisons of reproductive life-history patterns, but a variety of speculative evolutionary reconstructions, most of them habitable, can be raised on these bases (see Lancaster and Lancaster 1983 for one that resembles ours in some respects while differing in conclusions with regard to birth intervals). Either McGrew has misunderstood our recognition of eco-, socio-, and technoenergetic activities or we misunderstand his objections to it. The "common currency of calories" remains the same; we simply would like to have expenditures tracked in a particular way-and, McGrew's observations concerning woodpeckers notwithstanding, we believe that phylogeneti- cally limited comparisons would prove useful. The real prob- lem, which no discussant was so mean as to point out, would seem to lie in measurement. We did not suggest, as McGrew implies, that hominids were unique in exploiting the ecotone. McGrew's objection here strikes us as captious and his example of chimpanzee termiting on and off the ecotone (McBeath and McGrew 1982) as not quite to the point. Whether hominids may have learned to exploit ecotonal resources with a uniquely effective general subsistence strategy which gave rise to human culture is quite a different issue. That they did is a premise basic to many if not most hunter-gatherer theories (we have learned to qualify our generalizations). We think it is a heuristic premise, albeit en- compassing and speculative, and we tried to be clear about what we think it must mean to adopt it. If it could be reduced to a single hypothesis, and if the data for which McGrew calls can be controlled to afford meaningful comparisons, it perhaps could be confirmed or refuted or judged irrefutable and con- signed to the ash heap of evolutionary theory. More realisti- cally, such data (concerning reproductive success of primate populations on the ecotone as opposed to abutting habitats) might be expected to help clarify terms. In any event, they would be good to have. As McGrew notes, monogamy in certain species of mar- mosets and tamarins in conjunction with multiple births is of great interest and relevant to consideration of selection for "household" organization; the amount of caretaking appar- ently performed by siblings, at least in captivity, is of particu- lar interest to us. Reliable aid by an attentive companion is evidently important to the female, where monogamy obtains among the Callitrichidae, and twins or triplets appear to con- stitute an initial investment sizable enough to deserve post- natal attention by the male parent. Also, assuming that twins or triplets are dizygotic, as seems likely, the possibility of mixed male parentage if mating were promiscuous would ap- pear to favor monogamous arrangements from the male's point of view. The gase of the Callitrichidae is important in the sense that they provide an exception that "proves" the rule in the original sense-i.e., testing its application. Our rules don't Vol. 26 *No. 2 *April 1985 apply to them because different mechanisms appear to be oper- ating than in the case of hominid evolution (the problem of transport of multiple offspring for these small arboreal pri- mates seems central to monogamous cooperation in a way that it is not likely to have been for early hominids), but this is hardly a reason for omitting the Callitrichidae from discussion, and we are glad that McGrew has brought them in. Nickels, Slocum, and Smith (like Groves and Hornshaw) note that reciprocity in other relationships than that of the mating pair is likely to have been important in hominid evolu- tion. We agree. Cooperation between breeding adults has theoretical priority only if one begins with the assumption that sex dimorphism provided the original basis for division of labor. We made that assumption as a heuristic, then assigned ontogenetic priority to reciprocity in this relation as a way of underlining what seemed to us a likely feature of emergent hominid households (i.e., a systematic connection between re- duced birth intervals and allo-maternal care of younger by older but still immature siblings), limiting our discussion to simple two-parent households. We think our approach was correct (i.e., we weren't just fooling around), not least because it involves a logic which should give rise to the sort of testable hypotheses Smith would like to see us come up with. Impor- tant questions that lie just outside the scope of this initial pre- sentation deal with the factors, including sex dimorphism, that govern parity and disparity in exchange relations between breeding adults and with how the character of subsidiary ex- change relations within and across sexes may be affected by that of the primary one in, for example, a group or congeries of groups in which the mated-pair relationship is economically central and males are dominant. Of course none of this means that cooperation in other sec- tors of an extended household and the larger group must wait upon the formation of long-term mated pairs. Mother- offspring groupings, as Slocum points out, have their own dy- namics, and so do groups of closely associated female siblings, or males for that matter. Smith's suggestion that households may have been founded on the cooperative activities of females who "exploited the association of an adult male" strikes us as eminently reasonable. Nickels seems to be tending toward the same conclusion in his "friendly amendment," and we recog- nize it as a compatible alternative. We are not insistent advo- cates of primordial monogamy, as some discussants appear to assume (our polygynous yearnings betrayed by n. 4); the birth- interval hypothesis requires only long-term relationships be- tween a single male and female(s), with exclusive rights to insemination of the latter by the former. Oates raises an important question which we begged: how closely connected are those revolutions in locomotor and social organization variously represented as the engines of "hominid" behavior? There is no evidence from the earth or in the bones of a social revolution, at least not the one at issue, prior to ca. 2.5 million years ago, which is why we were careful to separate the birth-interval hypothesis from Lovejoy's supplementary- feeding hypothesis. Manufacture of stone tools and increase in brain size suggest significant changes in behavior beginning around this time (and this seems as good a place as any to remark that we are confounded by a tendency of some discus- sants, though not Oates, to accept seemingly without question narrow taphonomic assumptions that reliable data concerning hominid evolution derive solely from stone and fossil bone, and not much from the former). Depending on how archaeologists and paleontologists resolve their changing interpretations of East African materials, it seems likely that the social revolu- tion which we discussed ended with the emergence of H. habilis or, if not then, with H. erectus of the Lower Pleis- tocene. Some time obviously was required for such a transfor- mation, though in evolutionary terms presumably not much. 219</page><page sequence="14">Our view is that it must have been concluded at latest by the Middle Pleistocene, if the geographical expansion of H. erectus over the Old World can be assumed to have been contingent on a gradual cultural loosening of habitat constraints afforded by that ecotone-based social revolution. The question of timing within these confines is important but not critical to our view of what would have been involved in a transformation from individual foraging to a dual reciprocal subsistence strategy. Since morphological adaptation to efficient bipedal locomo- tion appears to have been well under way by ca. 3.75 million years ago, selection for regular bipedal behavior must have been a factor in hominid evolution in the Miocene, some mil- lions of years (2 or 3 at least) before the social revolution. With Oates, we view bipedalism and accompanying dental modifi- cation in small-brained hominids as primarily feeding adapta- tions (the change in title from our first draft [n. 1] reflects the evolution of our view here, but we confess to a residual wishy- washiness which must have irked readers). Selection for biped- ality under the conditions outlined by Oates, following Prost (1980) and Rodman and McHenry (1980), suggests an applica- tion of Romer's Rule to hominid origins; the novelty, bipedal foraging, may be viewed as an effort by apes on the forest edge to maintain a forest adaptation. The later change, involving a new and more characteristically hominid efficiency in exploit- ing ecotonal resources, seems to us more "revolutionary" in character, whenever it occurred. Each involved important modifications in behavior; the first involved more striking changes in morphology, and it enabled the second. For ter- minological clarity it would have been better had we elimi- nated general references to "hominids" and "hominization" and referred the social revolution in question clearly to the emergence of H. habilis, with H. erectus an alternative pos- sibility. Teaford warns of the "danger ... of trying to force the past into a mold from the present," and that warning is implicit in the comments of others. We recognize the danger. Teaford's comment is too brief for us to do more than guess how much he and we may differ on issues such as the role of an articulate vocal language in hominid evolution (very considerably, it would seem), but we agree with him that recent work by taphonomists and experimental archaeologists provides a nec- essary corrective to any view that holds the behavior of Plio/ Pleistocene hominids to have been not very different from that of the !Kung San. At the same time, we do not assume that categories of evi- dence and modes of interpretation currently in vogue must be freer from bias than those against which they are placed in apposition. Glynn Isaac, reviewing East African materials in the 1970s, leaned heavily on interpretations drawn from data lately accumulated from the study of contemporary chimpan- zees and human hunter-gatherers. There is a tendency today to focus attention on taphonomic issues and to emphasize the bones themselves, with a dubious eye even to materials found in direct association unless it can be established that they have made material marks on the bones of concern. But one mustn't suppose that evidence from comparative behavior is in- validated by evidence from bones. The two are complementary and must be used along with other sets of evidence to correct one another. Lewis Binford, speaking from a programmati- cally material standpoint, has been eloquent in his exhortations to archaeologists to fix their eyes firmly on bone and stone (Binford 1981, 1983), but he does not pretend to be speaking to everyone. Brain's work (1981), and Binford's for that matter, con- vinces us if convincing were necessary that South African au- stralopithecines did not sit around feasting on fresh-killed game in furbished caves they called home. But it is important to keep in mind that Brain's careful analysis does not preclude a few days' extended stay now and then under rock overhangs or in cave galleries (see Binford's [1983] discussion of 220 Swartkrans). Similarly, while Potts's (1984) computer analysis of stone and bone accumulations at Olduvai has led him to propose that stone tools were cached in places which yield no evidence of having been campsites of long-term and intensive use, one would not want to leap to the conclusion that these cache-sites were not themselves foci of social activity (as Teaford seems to imply). Shipman's studies (1983, 1984) do not so much invalidate the concept of a home base (as food- processing, storage, and exchange center) as suggest that early hominids carried with them the materials to set one up and tear it down in the morning. Perhaps the most important conclusion of work such as Potts's, Shipman's, Brain's, or Binford's is not that our ances- tors now stand exposed as simple scavengers or that we can no longer think of them as capable hunters but that we are forced to wonder about the connection between scavenging and hunt- ing in a way that we may have avoided in the past. What might it be like to be a hunter competing with other predators, claiming a partially consumed kill on occasion or on other occasions giving one up? How might this differ, if at all, in terms of associated technology and search and consumption strategies, from being a scavenger who occasionally kills a competing scavenger or predator? It is unlikely that we will ever know exactly what to conclude about hominid behavior from accumulations of bone and stone, but we have certainly learned to try to hold back from leaps to what seem obvious conclusions. We read Waser and Howard's comments as supportive in a way that is primarily supplementary to our interpretations rather than corrective. Their comparisons of behavior refer directly to problems of central importance to the theory we set forth and are selected to illustrate general rules (and rule- testing exceptions) that can reasonably be expected to obtain across species. Their observation that reliability of aid over the long term might be a factor promoting female preference for "subordinate but parental" males reminds us that, as Kort- landt emphasizes, parenting includes more than feeding the young. Teaford's comment and our reply to it refer to a grow- ing body of work in which early hominids are represented as roving foragers, living a precarious life in competition with other predators and predatory scavengers, small groups of in- dividuals in more or less continuous association, with no regu- larly frequented campsites selected or fitted out for safe relax- ation. While we think that the footloose (and, in effect, footless) features of this Hobbesian representation have been overdrawn, to the extent that they are correct regular protec- tive aid contributions by male parents to offspring might be expected to be disproportionate to food contributions (relative to those of female parents), and this could go a long way to- ward resolving the issue to which Waser and Howard refer in closing. In our reference to optimal foraging theory, particularly as applied to hunter-gatherer foraging strategies (Winterhalder and Smith 1981) and specifically with respect to Winterhalder's extended discussions of culture and the hominid niche (Win- terhalder 1980, 1981-it is from the latter work that the pas- sage Winterhalder cites is drawn), we were too glib. We agree with Winterhalder that we misread him. Intent on setting forth the basis for an operationalized definition of culture as niche, we no doubt were too ready to contrast our approach with one that seemed to us on first reading in stark opposition. Those two papers (Winterhalder 1980, 1981), excellent in many re- spects and provocative throughout, are easy to misread on this point-we invite readers to confirm that for themselves, but we offer no further excuse. Our understanding of the theoretical inspirations of foraging theory may be less narrow than Winterhalder supposes, al- though comprehension perhaps cannot be said to characterize our grasp of the literature as a whole. Assumptions as to the degree and character of individual decision-making and the CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">Quiatt and Kelso: HOUSEHOLDS AND HOMINID ORIGINS nature of costs and benefits at issue seem to us similar, and equally problematical, in optimal foraging theory, microeco- nomic theory, and selfish-gene theory. To Winterhalder's ob- servation that we don't seem much discomfited by "individual- level selection concepts" it is worth noting that our whole endeavor is to apply these to complex group behavior-the same sort of exercise in which Winterhalder appears to be currently engaged with respect to optimal-foraging concepts. As he notes, these are minor issues. On the important one, that of essential community in defining and investigating the hominid econiche, we report ourselves instructed not only by his careful explanation here but by published or in-press re- ports of his own work which he has graciously provided us and for which we thank him. From the outset we tended to think of our paper as a kind of dateline exercise. It seemed appropriate and timely to reex- amine a body of speculative theory as it was undergoing in its own evolution a period of especially intense selection. We be- lieve, obviously, that the dual reciprocal subsistence theory makes a lot of sense and that the evidence for it is not in- validated by the exercise of new options of interpretation (vide our reply to Teaford's comment). Examination across disci- plines of a wide range of interpretations is most important, of course, and that is primarily the kind of interchange we called for in our final paragraph. That is the kind provided in the responses just discussed, and we would like to express our gratitude to all who took the time to respond.
