<plain_text><page sequence="1">The tapia walls and fill on the top of Huaca Tello , C ajamar quilla. Cajamarquilla7 Peru The Necropolis on the Huaca Tello By P. G. SESTIERI Director of the Prehistoric and Ethnographic National Museum, Rome A report of the rare and unusual vases, largely from the late eighth and ninth centuries of our era, excavated at the cemetery on Huaca Tello by the Italian Archaeological Mission during its campaign from February to April 1969. H 1 Muaca Tello is one of the largest huacas (sacred pyramids) at Cajamarquilla, a town on the central coast of Peru. Named for the Peru- vian archaeologist, J. G. Tello, who excavated and made restorations there, it is located on the eastern end of the site and looks like a hill with a few stretches of tapia walls visible on its east- ern and western slopes. Tapia is the term used for large blocks of adobe that look very much like stone. The Italian Archaeological Mission whose first campaign at Cajamarquilla was re- ported in Archaeology 17 (1964) 12-17, turned its attention to Huaca Tello when fragments of painted vases were found in the top soil. In the previous campaign (1968), we had learned that the summit of the huaca had served as a necropolis and had been plundered by hua- queros (clandestine diggers) who, in their usual fashion, collected only perfectly preserved vases and tossed away the fragments. We collected many of the discarded fragments and in 1969 continued digging among the blocks of tapia used to fill a large square court on the top of the huaca. The result of this work was that we gathered many sherds that fitted the fragments already found and we were able to reconstruct many vases. Excavations were carried out systematically with two aims in mind: investigating the build- ing on the top of Huaca Tello and discovering any preserved tombs. We hit both targets. The building proved to be a very large open-air square court surrounded by huge tapia walls with perfectly fitting courses at square angles. We exposed the northern side almost entirely. It is about thirty meters long and over five meters high. At its base is a floor of packed earth (piso) . The full height of the wall has not been exposed along its entire length, but a gate was found about ten meters from the northwest corner. The east wall has a gate three meters from the north- east corner. When we opened a broad (four- meter) trench to reach the base of the wall, we found the area in front of the wall and within the square court filled with broken blocks of tapia for the entire height of the wall. The ex- terior of the court on the north is buried under an artificial landslide of the same sort (tapia blocks and earth) as the fill inside. Only the east side had not been completely hidden and the remains of similar carefully constructed walls were still visible. Nevertheless, for the most part, the building has been filled in and hidden - a fact which suggests that it was used as a cemetery after it had lost its function as a sacred or civil complex. 101</page><page sequence="2">Burial on Huaca Tello.

Ihe cemetery contained not the ordinary graves, but rather simple burials set among the blocks. Originally there were two layers of graves corresponding to two successive periods of use. Unfortunately, the upper layer was completely destroyed by plunderers who left as evidence only many whitened human bones among the blocks and great quantities of sherds which we found on the surface. The huaqueros intruded into the deeper layer of graves. Nevertheless, we were able to uncover eight burials. Some were untouched; others were partially destroyed, but preserved items at the feet of the burials which had been overlooked by the grave robbers who concentrated on the head and chest. Like the burials found by Dr. A. L. Kroeber in the Huaca Maranga ("Proto-Lima: a Middle Period Culture of Peru," Fieldiana Anthropology 44 [1954]), the skeletons were stretched on a litter. Sometimes only the litter was left and the bones had been scattered by the huaqueros. The litters were made of two poles of balsa which converged at the feet and to which were tied transverse pieces of reeds arranged in pairs and becoming shorter toward the feet. In some cases, remains of a mat were found on the litter. In one grave, a perfect- ly preserved skeleton had its legs wrapped with bands of undecorated cloth. There are seven graves of this type (one, tomb vm, is different) all arranged in parallel rows with heads facing west. The seven tombs contained largely un- decorated vases, but a few unusual painted speci- mens appeared. From tomb i comes a small, globular vase (not illustrated) with a broad circular mouth, small handle and a slanting, cylindrical spout. The shape of the body is probably borrowed from the shape of a gourd. On its cream slip is a series of four brown lozenges arranged in a cross, be- tween two broad bands which cover the two grooves on the body of the vase. From tomb n comes a paccha or "teapot." Its lenticular body is less flat than later examples and the handle and spout are almost vertical. Tomb n also con- tained a canteen (not illustrated) without han- dles, with a vertical neck narrowed in the middle. The lower part has a yellow slip and the rest is painted dark red. On the two narrow sides, the decoration consists of a rectangle divided by a line into two squares; in each square are five white circlets forming a cross.

The spout is red and the ribbon handle . is painted with red herring- bone pattern between black dots. Height , 12 cm. Vase from tomb v with feline monster. The slip is orange while red paint is used for the spout, handle, the bands at the top and at the carinated edge and for the monster. Height, 15 cm. tomb il is globular, flat bottomed and has a vertical cylindrical spout, a vertical ribbon- shaped handle and two tiny frog heads in re- lief on the shoulders. In tomb n, besides some beads from a necklace, was also a pair of copper pins with disk-shaped heads pierced by a hole. Such pins (tupu) , worn with the head down, are characteristic of the Sierra and are part of the feminine dress. Tomb in contained a rather flattened, lentic- ular vase with sharp carination where the two halves join. On the top is an inclined spout which tapers to the end and is joined by a bridge handle to the figure of a bird with wings spread which firmly holds the tail of a snake in its beak. Two wooden spindles and five miniature vases were also found by the skeleton in tomb hi. In tomb IV, were found a small utilitarian jar and a decorated jug, the body of which resembles an ovoid flask truncated at the bottom. In tomb v, the only vase had been deposited near the left side of the skull and it was smashed completely among the blocks but could be per- fectly repaired by the restorer. The vase is lentic- ular and the long tapering spout rises from an upper concave "disk." The ribbon handle joins the spout to the shoulder. The decorative figure is repeated three times, very crudely rendered, and appears to be a combination of a feline and a snake. The decorative elements on the mon- ster's legs and body have been described as "ray appendages," by D. Menzel in his article publish- ed in 1964. Tomb vin is completely different from the others we excavated. The skeleton originally wrapped in an embroidered cloth of cotton so as to form a fardo or bundle was placed in a foetal position with the head to the north. It was sur- rounded by plain and decorated vases. At its feet was a second skeleton evidently pushed aside to make room for the fardo which is clearly intru- sive and later and belongs to a people different from that of the skeletons stretched on a litter. Near the left side of the crouched skeleton was the skeleton of a small monkey with its skull drilled like the skulls of humans. Among the decorated vases from tomb vm, one is particularly striking : the lower part, cover- ed with a brown slip, is shaped like a truncated cone. The orange top is shaped like a calotte or skull cap and has a vertical red spout which is joined by a handle to the figure of a seated 103</page><page sequence="4">View of the monkey skeleton in tomb vm. Note the hole drilled in the skull . A vase from tomb vm with painted , two- headed snake and the figure of a puma; height , 16.5 cm. puma. On both sides of the calotte are two, two- headed snakes - one is red and the other in purple paint - each forming an "S." The heads with ears and open mouths and sharp teeth are feline in character. On the snakes' bodies are motifs of ray appendages like those on the feline monster of the vase from tomb v. Of the other vases from tomb vm, the most important is a fragmentary cup (not illustrated) made from mate or gourd, with incised designs representing the figure of a winged being with both human and feline characteristics and with a row of feline heads (clearly Tiahuanacoid) on the wings. In previously reported graves at Cajamarquilla, the tombs all contained bodies wrapped in textiles to form the bundle or fardo. With the bundles were buried various objects including utilitarian mi- decorated vases together with cups made of beau- tifully incised mate. Mate vessels were never associated with painted or decorated vases and this leads us to think that the painted vases be- longed to the skeleton which had been shoved aside to make room for the intrusive fardo. Kx&gt;m the sherds left by the grave robbers, it was often possible to reconstruct vases that were quite different from those we have described. There are beautiful examples of Maranga Negro : one bottle with two crayfish in relief on the shoulders; a second imitates four pumpkins tied together. The two slanting spouts are joined by a bridge handle decorated with a row of seeds identified as Nectandra Pichurin by M. A. Towle in her work Ethnobotany of Precolumbian Peru (Chicago 1961) page 40 and plate IV, 8. Other vases of the same style not illustrated here are in the shape of deep saucers and drinking glasses. The majority of the vases belong to the so- called Nieveria style with the characteristics of the Huari-Ayacucho phase. The most common decorative elements are snakes, felines, the octo- pus and crayfish. Feline characteristics usually occur in all the figures. Even the octopi and crayfish are provided with feline claws and fangs. Thus the natural forces of earth and water are joined to symbolize the divinity which rules the elements. La serpiente de Ayacucho , a two-head- ed snake rendered as a row of circular rings, is represented three times on one large vase. It has a mouth with a double row of fangs and on both sides of the head are long whiskers. Until now la serpiente was represented with only one head on the Nieveria vases of the Huari phase.

Vase with the figure of a shark, reconstructed from fragments left by grave-robbers. H eight } 10 cm. snake, a symbol of earth and water, is the symbol of the sky when it has two heads. Therefore, on the vase from Cajamarquilla the three elements: earth, air and water are associated. Some representations have no religious con- notations: on the sides of a cylindrical vase were two plastic sharks (only one is preserved) and we have already spoken of the lenticular vessel with the plastic figure of an eagle eating a snake ; a composition which occurs very often in Ni- everia vases. On the top of another vessel not illustrated here are two small human figurines sitting and 'chewing coca; fragments of similar figurines occur frequently. Anthropomorphic vases from Cajamarquilla and the neighboring necropolis of Nieveria, were already known. Our excavations have brought to light some frag- 105</page><page sequence="6">Portrait vase from C ajamar quilla. Height , 10.4 cm. Four-sided bottle from C ajamar quilla. The rare shape was previously known only from fragments in the Museum of Puruchuco. Height, 22.7 cm. mentary heads, and a sitting figure with an em- broidered bag on the back. The most interesting piece is a portrait vase, which looks very strange because of the vaulted form of the forehead, the fixed eyes and the open mouth with two rows of teeth looking like fangs. The facial painting is also very peculiar: cheeks, nose and eyebrows are painted red in such a way that the face looks as if it is wearing a mask shaped like two birds' heads facing one another in profile. The vase was surmounted by two spouts which, certainly, were joined by a bridge-handle. This as well as the facial painting, is an element borrowed from the Nazca culture and the cylindrical bottom is a Mochica element, so that this vase illustrates the meeting of northern and southern influences on the central coast of Peru. Perhaps the most beautiful of the vases found in this campaign is a rare bottle of fine and elegant shape. Only in the Museum of Puru- chuco near Lima are there fragments of a similar vase. This has four small feet. Its body is broader at the shoulders and presents four flat surfaces painted red and bordered with black and red chevrons. The same decoration occurs on the top of the vertical spout. The brown shoulders are covered with white dots - a clear reminiscence from the Proto-Lima culture, while the rest of the decoration is Huari. We can now infer that on the top of the Huaca Tello there were at least two layers of burials containing Nieveria pottery with a very strong Huari influence. The necropolis therefore can be dated between the end of the Early Inter- mediate Period and the beginning of the Middle Horizon. This chronology corresponds to the dates a.D. 790 and 850 obtained from Carbon 14 analysis in the Laboratories of the University of Rome on samples of the 1965 campaign.
