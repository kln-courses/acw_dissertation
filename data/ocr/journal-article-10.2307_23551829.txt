<plain_text><page sequence="1">TO PERFORM, OR NOT TO PERFORM? A THEORY OF RITUAL PERFORMANCE VERSUS COGNITIVE THEORIES OF RELIGIOUS TRANSMISSION1 Robert A. Yelle 1. Cognitive Theories of Religious Transmission: Some General Criticisms One of the more exciting recent developments in the study of religion has been the discovery of the relevance of cognitive science to religion. Anthropologists, psychologists, and even some historians of religion have applied the theories and findings of cognitive science to explain such important religious phenomena as the belief in supernatural beings and the regularity of certain forms of religious ritual. Although cognitive theories of religion have significant implications for our understanding of such widespread aspects of traditional religion, and have become increasingly sophisticated and powerful, the awareness of these theories within religious studies remains confined to a small (but growing) cir cle of scholars.2 The present essay attempts to widen that circle, out of a conviction that both cognitive approaches to religion and more tra ditional historical and humanistic approaches would be enriched by cross-fertilization. In the further conviction that the highest form of appreciation is cri tique, the present essay presents some criticisms of cognitive theories of religious transmission. My argument is that what we might call a "theory of ritual performance," attuned to the rhetorical dimensions of ritual, offers a better account of some of the phenomena addressed by these cognitive theories. Cognitive theories claim that certain cross cultural regularities in the form of rituals contribute to the memorability and transmission of such rituals and of the traditions they embody.

Some of the same ritual forms that contribute to memorability and transmission also contribute to the way that ritual produces persuasion. Specifically, the repetitiveness of ritual, in which cognitive theorists have seen only a mnemonic function, is in many cases better explained as contributing to a heightening of the "message" of ritual, or to making ritual more persuasive. Moreover, a brief analysis of some historical shifts in modes of religious transmission—including the Reformation, which serves as a touchstone for certain cognitive theories—reinforces the importance of ritual performance. One of the factors associated with the decline of certain forms of ritual repetition during the Reformation was Protestant polemics that targeted the rhetorical func tion of such devices. A theory of ritual performance frequently provides a better account of some aspects of the structure and the history of rit ual than do current cognitive theories. In the future, cognitive theories of religious transmission should incorporate a recognition of ritual per formance and its interaction with transmission. Let me begin on a note of agreement. The anthropologist Harvey Whitehouse, who has proposed an important cognitive theory of reli gious transmission, has defined the necessary assumption of any cogni tive theory of culture: "Culture in general—and religion in particular—are far from being infinitely plastic. There are material constraints on what people think and do, and some of the most significant of these constraints derive from the regularities of human cognition" (Whitehouse 2004a: 26). This is an assumption with which we should agree without hesi tation. Buttressed by experimental data that suggests some of the actual "constraints on what people think and do," cognitive theorists of reli gion have developed this assumption in order to account for the preva lence of certain religious beliefs and practices across different cultures and historical periods. For example, Pascal Boyer (2004) and Justin Barrett (2004) have focused on the widespread belief in supernatural beings, and have found that such "counterintuitive" properties as the ability to read minds may make these putative entities more memo rable. Other cognitive theorists have focused on religious practices. Whitehouse (2000, 2004a) proposes a fundamental distinction between two "modes of religiosity" or types of religious transmission, the "imag istic" and the "doctrinal." The imagistic mode, although it may involve the use of visual images, is characterized principally by its association with images, or with one-off, terrifying or otherwise impressive ritual events, such as rites of initiation. The doctrinal mode is characterized by its dependence on the elaboration of a systematic body of doctrine</page><page sequence="3">374 ROBERT A. YELLE that is transmitted verbally. In the absence of impressive images and harrowing experiences, the recall of such doctrine depends on a great deal of repetition. A key example would be the weekly sermon. Unlike the imagistic mode, therefore, the doctrinal mode tends to produce tedium. These two modes of religious transmission coordinate with different forms of social organization. The imagistic mode is local, face to-face, or in any case confined to small groups. The doctrinal mode allows larger and more centralized forms of political organization. There are other variables that coordinate with these modes of transmission, but these are some of the important ones. Whitehouse (2004a: 4) states that he is attempting to improve upon some earlier binary theories of religion, including Max Weber's dis tinction between "charismatic" and "routinized" religion, and Jack Goody's distinction between oral and literate traditions. His revision of such theories is designed to incorporate, among other things, the findings of experiments that suggest a fundamental difference between two types of memory: episodic and semantic. The former is also in certain cases called "flashbulb memory." Heightened emotional experiences can, as it were, burn an image onto a person's brain, even though such mem ories may not be reinforced by subsequent repetition. Semantic mem ory, on the other hand, lacking as it does the benefit of emotional arousal, requires such repetition. Whitehouse, who is an ethnographer rather than an experimentalist, finds in this cognitive distinction a kind of key for interpreting the results of his fieldwork in Melanesia, where indigenous modes of religiosity based on imagistic, local cults alternated with more diffuse, doctrinal modes of religiosity influenced by Christian missionaries. He believes that his distinction of modes of religiosity also provides a general theory of religious transmission. Whitehouse is not the only cognitive theorist to have produced an account of ritual transmission. E. Thomas Lawson and Robert McCauley presented an early and influential theory of ritual "competence" that sought to account for the regularity of ritual structure or grammar, and the ease with which human beings acquire facility with such ritual oper ations (Lawson and McCauley 1990.)3 More recently, they have endorsed some of Whitehouse's claims regarding the mnemotechnics of ritual, and also have contested his theory on certain points that do not con cern us directly here (McCauley and Lawson 2002). Lor our purposes, it is sufficient to note the points of agreement between these theories. Like Whitehouse, Lawson and McCauley are concerned primarily with 3 See McCauley and Lawson (2002: 4) for a definition of competence theories.</page><page sequence="4">TO PERFORM, OR NOT TO PERFORM? 375 developing a theory of ritual transmission, and they eschew explicidy the development of a theory of ritual "performance" (Lawson and McCauley 1990: 77, 83). Their emphasis accordingly is on what the form of ritual contributes to its memorability. They attribute to Whitehouse what they call the "ritual frequency hypothesis" (McCauley and Lawson 2002: 100), the claim that the frequency with which a ritual is repeated varies inversely with its ability to produce emotional arousal through what they call "sensory pageantry," which corresponds to what Whitehouse calls the "imagistic" mode. In other words, rituals that do not create sensory stimulation or emotional arousal require repetition in order to be memorable. Lawson and McCauley agree that the repetition of rit ual may lead to tedium. Before proceeding to evaluate the deficiencies of these theories from the perspective of a theory of ritual performance, some general criti cisms should be noted. The first is that no binary theory, such as Whitehouse's,4 is capable of capturing the full range and complexity of all religious forms. Whitehouse's own attempts to improve upon ear lier binary theories is an admission of their deficiencies that should serve to promote greater caution regarding the viability of any binary theory. A range of factors may serve as focal points for religious expres sion and authority, including charismatic leaders, terrifying or ecstatic rituals, the aesthetic experience of pictures and plastic images, elabo rated bodies of theology, oral traditions, and written canons. Why should it be thought advisable to reduce such complexity to yet another binary opposition? Of course, any attempt at explanation is also an act of simplification, or to use a pejorative term, of reduction. Simplicity does have its (cognitive) virtues. Yet two modes of religiosity may be too few. Whitehouse (2004a: 75) acknowledges that it is frequently difficult to distinguish fully between his two modes of religiosity, which seem to constitute ideal types rather than exclusive alternatives. No actual religion is only imagistic or only doctrinal. For example, traditional Hinduism involved elaborate doctrines which, until the modern period, were transmitted orally, as well as in manuscript form. Yet many if not all forms of traditional Hinduism also involved image-worship and other forms of sensory pageantry. In this respect, traditional Hinduism resem bled medieval Catholicism, which, as some critics have noted, seems 4 It should be noted that McCauley's and Lawson's theory is less reductively binary. However, as concerns the fundamental polarity described by the frequency hypothesis—that between sensory pageantry and repetitiveness—it is similarly dichotomous.</page><page sequence="5">376 ROBERT A. YELLE to contradict Whitehouse's description of this latter tradition as simply "imagistic" (Howe 2004: 136; Vial 2004). Other doctrinal traditions, such as Protestantism, may be much less compatible with, or even antagonistic to, image-worship. The inability of Whitehouse's theory to account for these differences among doctrinal traditions calls into ques tion his fundamental distinction between the two modes. He appears to recognize the uniqueness of the Reformation in promoting a ver sion of the doctrinal mode that was relatively exclusive of any admix ture with the imagistic mode (Whitehouse 2000: 149-50), but he does not believe that this requires recognition of a third category. A further ambiguity stems from the fact that his use of the term "imagistic" is, as previously noted, not confined to religions that employ pictures or plastic images. Even many Protestant denominations that avoid or min imize such images employ memorable, on-off rituals, such as adult bap tism by immersion, or pageantry in other sensory registers, such as singing or even speaking in tongues, all of which are, in Whitehouse's sense, "imagistic." Despite such serious problems of definition, Whitehouse's distinction between the two modes does appear to explain a great deal about the choices religions make regarding their own propagation and survival when confronted with particular material and social constraints. Together with, rather than to the exclusion of, other factors, the theory of two modes may be used to account for some important variations among religious traditions. As others have previously argued (Vial 2004), Whitehouse's choice of the terms "imagistic" and "doctrinal" appears to invoke and, to some degree, to privilege the historical case of Reformation iconoclasm. This conclusion is reinforced by the first book devoted entirely to his theory, Arguments and Icons (Whitehouse 2000). He expends some effort in applying his theory to the Reformation, and to the forms of Melanesian religion influenced by Protestant Christianity under colonialism (Whitehouse 2000: 147-59). Similarly, iconoclasm as a potentially cross-cultural phe nomenon became a test-case for Goody's theory of the differences writing makes to culture (Goody 1997). Given these indications, some further objections to Whitehouse's theory appear justified. One is that there are significant weaknesses in his account of the Reformation. I previously noted the problem with Whitehouse's association of medieval Catholicism with the imagistic, and of Protestantism with the doctrinal mode. Both traditions were actually doctrinal, but only the latter was hostile to images. Whereas Whitehouse's theory cannot explain this difference of attitudes, it will be suggested below that a number of other factors appear to have played a role in these Reformation developments.</page><page sequence="6">TO PERFORM, OR NOT TO PERFORM? 377 One factor, the advent of print culture, is well-known, and coincides with Goody's thesis regarding the importance of writing. However, the Reformation represented more than a shift in modes of religious trans mission. Protestants also advanced various criticisms of ritual performance, or of the "magical" dimensions of ritual. They associated certain forms of ritual repetition with rhetoric and idolatry. This contradicts Whitehouse's account of the Reformation on several key points. The first is that the crucial change in religious transmission appears to have been from orality to literacy, that is from one verbal mode to another, rather than from image to doctrine. The second is that repetition was associated with the "outmoded" oral mode, rather than with the written tradition that replaced it. The third is that the decline, such as it was,5 of ritual repetition resulted not from "tedium," but from two rather different factors: obsolescence due to a more efficient form of storage—namely the printed book—and polemical attacks against the rhetorical, magi cal, or performative dimensions of ritual. A further objection flows from this historical réévaluation. Reformation polemics against ritual performance provide an historical precedent for the cognitive theories' more benign neglect of ritual performance, and suggest that such theories, although apparently scientific, may depend on unacknowledged Protestant presuppositions. Whitehouse's scientific distinction between the doctrinal and imagistic modes, although devoid of any apparent normative judgment, parallels the earlier theological distinction between true religion and idolatry. These observations raise the disturbing possibility that a specifically Protestant understanding of religion, together with its attendant biases, may have been reproduced, unconsciously, in cognitive theories of religion. Another criticism of cognitive theories' emphasis on the transmission of religious ideas and practices stems from the general inability of such an emphasis to produce an adequate account of ritual function. Transmission potentially explains only the existence of ritual—its prop agation and survival—rather than its purpose for existing. There are some good reasons for limiting the inquiry in this way. Without the ability to transmit or perpetuate itself, religious discourse can serve no further purpose. Moreover, transmission may be more easily, and accu rately, measured than perhaps anything else. Transmission entails only the bare existence and perdurance, or susceptibility to memorization and recall, of particular, observed or reported aspects of religion. This 5 The question of whether there was an actual decline in such forms of ritual is a very difficult one, and some very tentative suggestions are given below.</page><page sequence="7">378 ROBERT A. YELLE conduces, at least potentially, to the experimental orientation of cog nitive science, although only some cognitive theorists of religion are actually engaged in experimental trials of their hypotheses. Other potential functions of religion—such as "persuasion"—may be difficult or impos sible to measure in a laboratory, or with a survey. Other reasons for the exclusive emphasis on transmission appear less compelling. One is an analogy to Darwinian evolution explicit in the appeal of cognitive theories to Richard Dawkins's idea of cultural "memes" as analogues of "genes" (McCauley and Lawson 2002: 39; Whitehouse 2004a: 17, 19; Boyer 1994: 35). There are valid parallels between cultural selection and natural selection, but these should not be overstated. Ritual behavior has a purpose or function beyond sim ple self-propagation, and cannot be understood adequately without tak ing this purpose into account. A focus on modes of transmission alone will not reveal what this purpose is, just as a focus on the mechanics of distribution of printed texts will fail to elucidate the meaning and function of any particular text, and its differences from other texts. To use another example, it is as if one were to attempt to explain the wide distribution of technologies such as flint axes or the wheel without ref erence to the utility of such devices. My objection is obviously not to the analogy with natural selection, but to specific applications of that analogy that emphasize transmission to the exclusion of other functions that might also be regarded as "adaptive" in a broader sense. For exam ple, the phenomenon of anthropomorphism, or the attribution of agency and, therefore, potential hostility to inanimate objects or processes, has plausibly been interpreted as enhancing the chances of survival in a dangerous natural environment (Barrett 2004; Boyer 2004). There is a revealing parallel between cognitive theories of religious transmission and Edward B. Tylor's theory of "survivals" from "prim itive culture," which was similarly influenced by Darwinism. Accounting for something as a "survival" does not yet constitute an adequate account of its total social function, nor especially for its present function in a living culture. Surely every cultural form must have had some purpose to begin with that recommended its adoption, and generally speaking, that function must have continued during the life of that cultural form. Otherwise, we reduce tradition to habit plus idiocy.</page><page sequence="8">TO PERFORM, OR NOT TO PERFORM? 379 2. Toward a Theory of Ritual Performance These criticisms lead directly to my main criticism of cognitive theo ries of religious transmission: namely, that they lack any developed notion of ritual performance such as would be capable of accounting adequately for the function of ritual forms. A theory of ritual performance can account for many aspects of ritual better than current cognitive theories can. My discussion here builds from a brief critique I made earlier in the context of developing a theory of ritual performance (Yelle 2003: 103-106). Religious discourse is not only a device for self propagation, a kind of perpetual motion machine or wind-up toy. Ritual is also a mode of performance serving a variety of functions, including intersubjective communication, cultural transmission, social influence, and rhetorical persuasion. In many cases the mnemonic or transmissive function of ritual cannot be distinguished easily from its other perfor mative functions. The same devices that contribute to the memorability of rituals may also contribute to their ability to persuade, or to influence behavior. This is clearest in the case of rhythmic or poetic ritual lan guage, a case examined below. An exclusive emphasis on transmission leads to a misinterpretation of the function of such ritual forms. Specifically, when the cognitive theorists argue that ritual repetition is a mnemonic device that can both reinforce itself and lead to tedium, they are partly misconstruing both the function of such repetition and the reasons for its decline. Lawson and McCauley (1990: 77, 83) state that theirs is a theory of ritual "competence," not a theory of ritual "performance." However, in their more recent work they acknowledge that there are "motivational" rather than mnemonic reasons behind the form of some religious rituals: "[RJeligious rituals . . . containing increased sensory pageantry, stimu late participants' emotions in order not only to augment their recall for these events but also to motivate them religiously. . . ." (McCauley and Lawson 2002: 114; cf. 7). What do they mean by "motivation"? One answer is given by their comment that "sensory pageantry . . . helps to persuade . . . participants. . . that they have undergone funda mental changes. . . ." (2002: 123). This gesture towards a theory of rit ual performance is a positive step, but it cannot be regarded as an adequate one. Whitehouse (2004a: 64) also mentions the need to consider the motivational aspects of ritual, but his account of such motivations is even less well developed. What should we mean by "performance" in the context of ritual? Performance generally denotes the entire range of pragmatic effects that</page><page sequence="9">380 ROBERT A. YELLE can result from human action, including changes of behavior, affect, or attitude. This broad definition of performance may not appear imme diately to have any special connection to ritual. Indeed, the apparent lack of practical effect of many ritual behaviors, their evident non utilitarian value, seems to violate our intuitive sense of what "performance" means, and can lead to pejorative characterizations of ritual as behavior devoid of meaning or purpose. Against such biases, a theory of ritual performance recovers a sense of the function of ritual as a form of communication or persuasion. Building from the very impractical sense in which the theatrical or dramatic arts constitute a performance, a theory of ritual performance emphasizes the aesthetic and rhetorical dimensions of ritual behavior. Through the unfolding of the ritual process, certain effects are produced that are not merely a restatement or expression of a "meaning" existing independently of the ritual. A theory of ritual performance is intended to recapture the "work" done or the difference made by ritual. I do not claim that these ideas are new. Theories of ritual per formance have been around for some time (see Bell 1998). Numerous anthropologists and scholars of religion have applied J. L. Austin's concept of the "performative utterance," or John Searle's related con cept of "speech acts," to ritual. Others have developed the analogy between ritual and dramatic performance (Turner 1974, 1987; Schechner 1977, 1993). Perhaps the most systematic theory of ritual performance has been elaborated by Stanley Tambiah in a series of articles culmi nating in "A Performative Approach to Ritual," which synthesizes the key concepts: Ritual is a culturally constructed system of symbolic communication. It is constituted of patterned and ordered sequences of words and acts, often expressed in multiple media, whose content and arrangement are charac terized in varying degree by formality (conventionality), stereotypy (rigid ity), condensation (fusion), and redundancy (repetition). Ritual action in its constitutive features is performative in these three senses: in the Austinian sense of performative, wherein saying something is also doing something; in the quite different sense of a staged performance that uses multiple media by which the participants experience the event intensively; and in the sense of indexical values—I derive this concept from Peirce—being attached to and inferred by actors during the performance. (Tambiah 1985: 128) In defining what he means by "a performative approach," Tambiah amalgamates the senses of theatrical performance and linguistic per formatives with a third, less common sense of performance taken from Charles Sanders Peirce. The concept of ritual as an "indexical icon"</page><page sequence="10">TO PERFORM, OR NOT TO PERFORM? 381 (Tambiah 1985: 156) that signals or points to its context is a difficult concept that has been developed especially by Michael Silverstein (1993, 1998; cf. Silverstein and Urban 1996) in the context of a general the ory of linguistic pragmatics. (Readers who may wish to learn more about this concept, and especially its application to ritual, may consult Yelle (2003).) Peirce's semiotic pragmaticism is indeed a rich source for a theory of ritual performance and, with its orientation toward the func tion of texts or discourses within their social contexts, is a worthy suc cessor to the classical rhetorical tradition. These theories will serve as background for the present discussion. Within this orientation toward performance, Tambiah highlights sev eral features of ritual that are also highlighted by cognitive theorists, including especially its repetitiveness and use of multiple media, or what Lawson and McCauley call "sensory pageantry." Tambiah identifies a quite different function for these ritual forms, one that we might broadly term persuasion (cf. Tambiah 1985: 72, 77) or the rhetorical function. However, this function is not sharply distinguished from transmission in his account. In an earlier article, he suggested that such devices in ritual language serve "for transmitting a message through redundancy, for storing vital technological knowledge in an oral culture, and for the construction of the spell itself as a lengthy verbal form" (Tambiah 1985: 36). Different traditions of interpretation converge in this statement. One is the application of communication theory to explain how ritual repetition facilitates the conveyance of a message (cf. Leach 1966: 404; Smith 1982: 54). Another is Albert Lord's and Milman Parry's demon strations of how poetic devices contribute to the recall and composition of the epic in oral performance (cf. McCauley and Lawson 2002: 52). This reinforces the connection of ritual performance with transmission, and at the same time, suggests the inadequacy of limiting the former to the latter. The rhetorical and mnemonic functions, in both ritual and other discourses, are closely linked, although depending on the occasion one or the other may be more prominent. Perhaps reflecting that fact, the classical rhetorical tradition encompassed both the arts of persuasion and the arts of memory. A few examples of common rituals will serve to illustrate these points. The first example is so-called "sympathetic magic," such as pouring water on the ground to bring rain, or injuring a voodoo doll in order to injure one's opponent. According to Tylor and James Frazer, these rituals mistake symbolic relations of similarity or contiguity for a real, causal relation between the ritual and its intended goal (Tylor 1803: 115ff; Frazer 1951: 12ff). Applying Tylor's concept of "survival"—the</page><page sequence="11">382 ROBERT A. YELLE resemblance of which to cognitive theories of religious transmission has already been noted—at best accounts for how this mistake endures after it is initially made. However, we still need to account for this initial error. What is it about the structure of the magical ritual that con duces to such an error? More recent theorists have glossed Frazer's two laws of magic, based respectively on similarity and contiguity, using the paired terms "metaphor and metonymy" (Jakobson and Halle 1956: 81; Tambiah 1985: 35) or "icon and index" (Sebeok 1976: 31-32, 76-77, 131-32), in this way reinforcing the rhetorical function of such devices in ritual. Another way of putting it is that rhetorical devices are used to "heighten" the message of ritual as a signal of its goal, albeit a mis leading one. So magic would be not a simple mistake, but rather one determined, or encouraged, by the persuasive power of rhetoric. This more or less coincides with Tambiah's suggestion that we reevaluate magic, not in terms of its truth or falsity, but in terms of its persua siveness (1985: 72, 77). The case of such rituals illustrates the convergences, and divergences, of the mnemonic and rhetorical functions of ritual. The devices magic employs, namely similarity and contiguity, have long been interpreted as contributing to the memorability and, more broadly, the association of ideas (Smith 1982: 20-21). However, in the case of magic, the function of such devices is not primarily mnemonic. The idea called to mind by the ritual is its goal, for example, rain falling from the sky. This goal is not remembered retrospectively but signaled prospectively ("indexed") by the ritual. Of course, in constructing its message ritual draws on an existing repertoire of stored ideas. But these are used to heighten the message of ritual, rather than for the simple purpose of recollection. As the concept of sympathetic magic has been criticized lately, it would be unwise to rest any theory exclusively on its example. Perhaps a better example of the intersection of the mnemonic and persuasive functions of ritual is found in ritual language. One of the most wide spread religious phenomena cross-culturally is the use of poetic devices in spells, incantations, and prayers. Whether we are talking about "actual" magic words, such as the so-called Ephesian words in Greek spells that begin "aski kataski"; or folk-spells such as "Fever, fever, stay away/Don't come in my bed today"; or even later parodies of magic words, such as "hocus pocus" and "mumbo jumbo"; the poetry is pal pable. Whitehouse associates magic spells and other such repetitive lan guage with the doctrinal mode of transmission, which depends on repetition for its memorability (2000: 184). This seems intuitively correct,</page><page sequence="12">TO PERFORM, OR NOT TO PERFORM? 383 as the contribution of poetic repetition to the memorability of formulas, especially in an oral culture, has been noted previously (Goody and Watt 1963; Goody 1977; Havelock 1963). Among cognitive theorists, the psychologist David Rubin, building upon the work of Lord and Parry, has argued for the contribution of alliteration and rhyme to the memorability of verbal formulas (Rubin 1995; cf. McCauley and Lawson 2002: 52-54; Slone 2004: 65). Although Whitehouse notes that "We know relatively little about the psychological effects of high-frequency verbal reiteration on processes of analogical thinking" (2004a: 167), it seems likely, if not thoroughly established scientifically, that a range of forms of verbal repetition may contribute to memorability. And there's the rub. Because the very same forms also appear to contribute to the rhetorical force of ritual language. Our intuition that rhythmic form contributes something to the strength of spells is sup ported by several observations. The first is that this is the explicitly articulated opinion, or folk explanation, of such devices in some of the traditions that employ them, such as the Hindu Tantric tradition as described below. The second is the continuing role of such devices in contemporary culture, where magic has declined but analogous uses of rhythmic language for rhetorical purposes are ubiquitous in advertising jingles and political slogans. The third observation, developed in the final section of this essay, is that the contribution of such devices to persuasion or illusion made repetitive ritual language the target of Reformation polemics, which may have contributed to the historical decline of such language in certain genres. The verbal formulas of Hindu Tantric ritual known as "mantras" employ both overt forms of rhythm, such as alliteration, and more covert structures that imitate various processes of creation, including the cos mogony (Yelle 2003). The tradition regards these different forms of repetition as ways of making a mantra successful or effective (siddha), for either magic or worship. Even simpler forms of repetition, involv ing the chanting of the entire mantra over and over, are also regarded as having the same effect. The Tantric tradition itself emphasizes the pragmatic or performative rather than the mnemonic function of mantric repetition. Of course, what the tradition regards as magically effective speech I am reinterpreting as rhetorically persuasive speech, thereby substituting a different sense of performance. But the point remains. I have used Saussure's concept of "relative motivation" to name the motive force produced by such rhythmical language, and to analyze the semiotic mechanism that underlies this force (Yelle 2003). In sim ple terms, relations among words, based solely on resemblance in sound,</page><page sequence="13">384 ROBERT A. YELLE are mistaken for something deeper, namely a substantial relation. In the case of magical language, the words point not only to each other, but also to the world, and are taken to bring about the concrete result that they name. This is a key example of the ability of poetic language to mislead us. Other examples may be found closer to home. Consider an advertising jingle or political slogan, such as the one Jakobson (1960) analyzed, "I Like Ike." Is the primary function of this phrase to be memorable, or to persuade? Actually, both functions are perfectly consonant. The formula works on us the more it is called to mind. But clearly, when placed in its proper (pragmatic) context, the goal of the formula is not simple self-propagation. The goal is to persuade someone to vote for Ike. The mnemonic function of the formula is ancillary or subordinate to its rhetorical function. One is encouraged to associate Ike with pos itive feelings ("like"). One is encouraged to repeat, or really to ventril oquate, a phrase that indexes one's allegiance to Ike. Another, everyday example of how repetition contributes to the pragmatic force of dis course is: "Do it, John! Do it now!" When I repeat myself in this way, am I trying to get John to remember what he is supposed to do, or am I, quite simply, reinforcing the message that, whatever it is, it must be done quickly? What the cognitive theorists have interpreted as the function of rhythm or repetition in ritual, namely its contribution to memorability, does not account for the prominence of such devices in ritual language. Such devices, considered merely as mnemotechnics, may serve to promote the memorability of any cultural form. Why, then, should they be espe cially prevalent in effective rituals, such as magic? The answer, already suggested by Tambiah and other theorists, and evident to those familiar with the Western rhetorical tradition, is that such devices contribute not only to memorability, but also to the persuasiveness of rhetoric, the illusionism of spells, and the binding force of oaths and other performative utterances. 3. Historical Changes in Modes of Ritual Performance The importance of the performative dimension of ritual is reinforced by a consideration of some historical changes in modes of religious transmission. One factor in these changes was polemics against poetic repetition as an illegitimate form of persuasion associated with magic. By focusing exclusively on transmission to the neglect of performance,</page><page sequence="14">TO PERFORM, OR NOT TO PERFORM? 385 cognitive theories of religious transmission may have misdiagnosed the reason for the decline of certain forms of ritual. Whitehouse suggests that the primary cause for the decline of repet itive ritual is the "tedium effect." Lawson and McCauley have also accepted this factor. Although repetition can serve to heighten the expe rience and promote the recollection of a ritual, it can also lead to fatigue and boredom. For similar reasons, Tambiah noted repetition as a factor contributing not only to ritual performance, but also to "rit ual involution" (1985: 153, 161), a process of decline stemming from "tedium." In the final paragraph of his essay "A Performative Approach to Ritual," Tambiah announced as an unfinished task the framing of an explanation of the following paradox: How is it that the very same features that contribute to the function of ritual also contribute to its decline? How can devices that reinforce the power of ritual also cause its weakness? (Tambiah 1985: 166) This question remains unanswered by cognitive theories of religious transmission. Whitehouse has recently admitted the possibility that repetition may lead to "arousal" rather than tedium (2004a: 99). He has further acknowledged defects in his earlier "portrayal of the 'tedium effect' as a necessary outcome of rou tinization" (2004b: 324). These admissions underscore the inability of the modes of religiosity theory to account for the conditions under which repetition will lead to tedium. Obviously, a complete answer to this question cannot be attempted within the scope of the present essay. However, some indications may be given that call into question the adequacy of the accounts so far presented by cognitive theorists. Any discussion of these questions touches upon the "literacy hypothesis" advanced by Goody (1977; Goody and Watt 1968) and the classicist Eric Havelock (1963) to account for the debate between Plato and the Sophists in ancient Greece, and the birth of a new genre of philoso phy specifically opposed to rhetoric. Goody and Havelock argued that the discovery of alphabetic writing worked a profound transformation on culture. Writing presented opportunities for recording, storing, and communicating ideas that rendered obsolete the mnemonic function of poetic devices that had encouraged their use in oral culture. Plato's attack on the poets supposedly represented the conflict of the newer mode of cultural transmission based on writing with an older, oral mode. Although persuasive in many respects, the literacy hypothesis has cer tain flaws, particularly as an account of the vituperation directed against poetic repetition. Why should the replacement of one, less efficient medium of communication by another have produced this degree of</page><page sequence="15">386 ROBERT A. YELLE animosity? Another factor that appears to have motivated this debate was a concern regarding the rhetorical or performative dimensions of poetic repetition. In his Encomium of Helen, the Sophist Gorgias of Leontini argued for the persuasive power of poetry, defined as "speech with metre," which he identified with magical incantations. Plato, in his Republic, Book 10, adopted the association between poetry and magic and used it to condemn poetic imitation (mimesis) as a form of deception. Both sides of this debate were focused on the persuasive, and not the mnemonic, function of poetry. European culture witnessed another fundamental shift in modes of cultural transmission resulting from the rise of printed books and lit eracy that followed the technological innovation of movable type in the fifteenth century. Prior to this time, writing was in manuscript form, and oral tradition still retained significant priority. Oral traditions often relied on the use of poetic devices for memorability. Printing allowed an entirely different form of transmission, one largely independent of individual memory, and was consequently less reliant on poetic devices. However, as in the case of ancient Greece, these changes in material culture explain only the functional obsolescence of poetic repetition con sidered solely in its capacity as a mnemotechnic. They do not explain fully the broader reorientation toward language associated with Protestant literalism. It has often been claimed that the advent of the book played a significant role in precipitating the Reformation. It is not necessary for our present purposes to resolve this historical debate. What is clear is that, with respect to religion, print culture facilitated the translation of scripture into vernacular languages, and the codification of the liturgy as represented, for example, by Thomas Cranmer's publication of the Book of Common Prayer in 1549. Protestant literalism, as apparent in the so-called "plain style," emphasized the semantic content of language at the expense of its stylistic form. Moreover, as did Plato in ancient Greece, Protestants advanced polemics against certain forms of poetic language. Repetitive prayers, such as the Catholic rosary, were proscribed as forms of rhetoric, magic, and idolatry. Some of these polemics invoked Matthew 6:7. The Authorized Version or King James Bible of 1611, following the earlier Geneva Bible, translated this verse as follows: "But when ye pray, use not vain rep etitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking." What was supposed to be the matter with "vain repetitions"? They were regarded as a form of rhetoric or magic designed to persuade or even compel God. This association was made already by John Calvin (1509-1564), who argued that Jesus "does not forbid</page><page sequence="16">TO PERFORM, OR NOT TO PERFORM? 387 us to pray long or frequently, or with great fervour of affection; but he forbids us to confide in our ability to extort any thing from God by stunning his ears with garrulous loquacity, as though he were to be influenced by the arts of human persuasion" (Calvin 1947: 138). Such practices were associated with the erroneous belief that God could be persuaded like a man, a belief based upon the grossest idolatry and anthropomorphism. Cranmer's reform of liturgy appears to reflect such prejudices. In his introduction to the Book of Common Prayer, he explained that he had removed various corruptions, including a "mul titude of Responds, Verses, vain Repetitions, Commemorations, and Synodals." This may have impacted his revision of the marriage vow. Older, manuscript versions of the vow, reflecting an oral tradition of Anglo-Saxon law, included more extensive alliteration in its formulas, especially in such parallelisms as "for fairer or fouler" and the wife's promise "to be bonour and buxom at bed and at board." Cranmer's printed version replaced most of these alliterations with their literal "translations" into more modern English, retaining of these only the essential formula of ownership, "to have and to hold." These polemics against "vain repetitions" resurfaced in nineteenth-century colonial India, where they were applied against the chanting of mantras, the impor tance of which in the Hindu Tantric tradition was described previously. The foregoing account, as brief as it is, already indicates some significant problems with Whitehouse's theory of modes of transmission as concerns the Reformation. In the first place, the crucial change in modes of transmission may have occurred, not with a shift from local imagistic rituals to doctrine, but rather with the replacement of oral tradition by writing. Whitehouse's association of repetitive ritual lan guage with the doctrinal mode fails to account for this shift, and for the decline of such language. Rather than tedium, it was a combination of the partial obsolescence of poetic language in a print culture, and of polemics directed against the rhetorical function of such language, that led to its decline in certain genres, or for certain uses. Given his emphasis on the importance of transmission, it might be expected that Whitehouse would recognize the role of writing in these developments. However, he has specifically underestimated this role. He argues that during the Reformation transmission remained largely oral, rather than written (Whitehouse 2004a: 152). This claim may be granted, but it does not refute the fact of the growing importance of writing at that time, especially among the more elite and influential sectors of society, who were largely responsible for the developments in question. Moreover, Whitehouse's contention (2004a: 80) that the doctrinal mode precipitated</page><page sequence="17">388 ROBERT A. YELLE the development of writing, rather than the other way around, seems especially dubious. McCauley and Lawson (2002: 46; cf. 52) similarly downplay the significance of writing to these religious differences. Although they acknowledge that there is a greater need for repetition as a device for transmission in oral cultures, they conclude that, cog nitive abilities being the same in oral and literate traditions, "both Whitehouse and we hold that, finally, literacy is not the fundamental variable in this mix" (2002: 108). Above all, it is the neglect of the performative dimensions of ritual that undermines cognitive theories of religious transmission. A survey of the polemics against repetitive prayers shows that what was at stake was precisely their rhetorical function. The negative affect inspired by such rituals was not tedium, but hostility against what was regarded as a violation of the prohibitions against idolatry and witchcraft. As in the earlier debate between Plato and the Sophists, Reformation polemics against poetic ritual language emphasized precisely the per suasion-producing rather than the memory-inducing function of such language. One question that looms large here is whether, and to what extent, it is valid to speak of a "decline" of such forms of ritual as poetic rep etition. This question is beyond the scope of the present essay, which suggests only that, to the extent that such a decline may have occurred, it may have been motivated by factors other than, or in addition to, those pointed out by proponents of the literacy hypothesis, and by cog nitive theorists of religious transmission. Havelock and, to a lesser extent, Goody accepted such decline as a fact. However, what the prototypical Greek case may have demonstrated was only the proscription of poetic repetition within a newly literalist genre of philosophy. Cognitive theories are less dependent on the factual status of a general decline in ritual repetition, as they argue that ritual forms may oscillate perpetually between the two modes, the imagistic and the (repetitive) doctrinal. Certainly poetic repetition perdures in many genres of modern culture, such as advertising, as noted previously. Yet the decline of poetic repetition for certain ritual uses, such as magic, and in certain genres of culture in which literalism has become hegemonic, seems to be a real historical phenomenon.</page><page sequence="18">TO PERFORM, OR NOT TO PERFORM? 389 4. Conclusions This essay has suggested that cognitive theories of religious transmis sion are on the right track in attending to the contribution of ritual forms to cultural transmission. However, these theories would become more powerful if they incorporated a more developed notion of ritual performance. A theory of ritual performance reinforces the importance of transmission, but broadens the range of functions served by ritual to include communication and persuasion. This orientation toward the rhetorical function of ritual provides a better account of many types of rituals, including magic; and of the reasons for the historical decline of such ritual forms. The historical repression of the performative dimen sions of ritual suggests further that cognitive theorists' current neglect of these dimensions may itself be a legacy of the Reformation. Earlier it was speculated that another reason why cognitive theorists have not attended to the rhetorical effects of ritual is that these are difficult, or perhaps impossible, to measure scientifically. Memory may be tested more easily than persuasion. Yet I wonder whether an exper iment might be designed to demonstrate, or refute, some of the claims advanced above concerning the effects of ritual. Is it possible through experiment to confirm the rhetorical effects that appear to be associated with ritual? Whatever the case may be, the limits of the scientific or experimental method should not be allowed to restrict our modes of inquiry as scholars of religion, nor the questions to which these are applied. This suggests that the strongest theory of religion will come from a conversation among cognitive theorists, humanists, and historians. Experimentalists and interpreters of culture have much to learn from each other. Speaking as one of the latter, I am confident that no exper imentalist can afford to ignore the historical record of cultural practices in framing a theory of human nature. What greater control could there be on the biases inherent in our own culture than the records of other cultures and times, radically dissociated from ours, and not embedded in its presuppositions?
