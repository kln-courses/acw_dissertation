<plain_text><page sequence="1">Soldiers, Sailors, and Sandalmakers: A Social Reading of Ramesside Period Votive Stelae. By Karen Exell. GHP Egyptology 10. Pp. 213, pis 16. London, Golden House Publications, 2009. ISBN 978 1 906137 10 6. Price £30. It is rare to find a book that brings a fresh perspective to well-treated material—such is the case with Exell's Soldiers, Sailors, and Sandal Makers. Displaying a solid knowledge of current anthropological theory and literature, the author avoided conducting a more traditional typological or religious study of votive stelae in favour of a social analysis. Exell recognises that votive stelae are not just religious monuments, but 'the material manifestation and record of a select repertoire social practices, and act as markers of social identity. As inscribed private monuments, conveying information via text, iconography and materiality, the stela displayed a multilayered message about the dedicator, his/her place in society, and the structure of that society' (p. i). Chapter I focuses on the evolution of funerary, votive, and commemorative stelae, and previous approaches to their study. The author discusses the connection and evolution of stelae, demonstrating how they all carry social and religious information and can display personal piety, but highlights the social information displayed on these objects. Comparing Middle Kingdom votive stelae from Abydos, special attention is given to the use of higher-ranking intermediaries whose appearance on stelae may have granted the stela donor a higher level of religious access by including an individual who could have directly accessed a deity. This preliminary discussion, while brief, serves as a fine introduction to votive stelae and their study. Chapter II focuses on Deir el-Medina, and details the author's methodology. An overview of the history and nature of the community of Deir el-Medina, and approaches to its study, is given. The author's criteria for inclusion in her dataset are of central importance: 'that [the stela] is private (non royal), retains the title of the owner, an indication at least of who the deity is, and that it is possible to distinguish the representation of the individual in relation to the deity on the stela' (p. 20). The total dataset comprises 436 stelae: 319 come from the Theban region (264 from Deir el-Medina); 74 from Qantir; 21 from Abu Simbel; 15 from Wadi es-Sebua; and 7 from Zawiyet Umm el-Rakham. The resulting study is therefore mainly focused on Thebes. Many important observations are made, but the lack of sufficient data from other sites inhibits comparative analysis. The author explains that 'one of the principal aims of this study was to establish whether aspects of the design and content of a stela were related to the social status of the dedicator', using three criteria: the 'compositional form' of the scene; the cult image (hypostasis) depicted; and the original location of the stela (p. 20). The 'compositional form' relates to depicting access to a deity: such access could be direct, through the use of an intermediary, or on a separate register. The use of an intermediary is especially relevant to the author as it may represent an attempt to display imagery that was restricted to higher ranking individuals, the recording of an actual cult ceremony, and/or an attempt to elevate one's social status through connection with a higher ranking member of the community. Similarly, a particular cult image may represent access to a specific form of the deity, or even a specific cult location. The third criterion of location, or find spot, is, as the author admits, the most difficult of the three criteria. It is rare for a stela to be found in situ, and most early excavation records only list the general area where the stelae was found, if at all. The central aim of the study is to 'examine an individual's social status based on the form, content, and location of the stelae, to attempt to reveal the motives for the commissioning and erection of votive stelae, and to determine whether stelae can be linked to actual historical events' (p. 25). Other issues considered include the principles which governed the creation of votive stelae, and whether or not these varied from site to site. Chapter III is the core of the book, containing a detailed analysis of the stelae from Deir el-Medina and greater Theban region. The author states (p. 26) that the Deir el-Medina subset of 264 votive stelae all meet the necessary criteria (i.e. being private and retaining owner's title, indication of deity, and indication of relative location of deity and individual); however, approximately 1/6 of the stelae</page><page sequence="2">2oi3 REVIEWS 339 from this subset do not meet each criterion (see specific points at the end of this review). Exell attempts to date the selected stelae to specific reigns using the prosopographical and genealogical work of Benedict Davies.1 This is an important contribution, as the author has been able to more firmly establish the date of many stelae, but it is inconvenient that no specific explanation is given for the re-dating of each stelae, nor is there an easy reference that allows one to determine which stelae she has re-dated.2 She dates 198 stelae to specific reigns and acknowledges that many stelae could have been produced in multiple reigns. If the specific reign is not clear, a stela is counted in both reigns in which it could have been produced, yielding multiple 'hits' for individual stelae. There are a total of 180 hits (on 170 total stelae) for the Nineteenth Dynasty, and 108 (on 64 total stelae) for the Twentieth Dynasty. The difficulty in dating Twentieth Dynasty stelae is due, as the author notes, to the relative lack of genealogical and prosopographical data. In regards to dating, the author's placement of 96 stelae to the first half of the reign of Ramesses II is most significant. J. Moje's study, Untersuchungen zur Hieroglyphischen Palaeographie und Klassifizierung der Privatstelen der iq. Dynastie (AAT 67; Wiesbaden, 2007), which is not used by the author, could provide an interesting comparison to the author's conclusions. Exell next conducts a comparative analysis of the compositional form of stelae from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties, demonstrating an overall trend for the use of stelae showing individuals directly accessing deities (type A), although she points out important outliers: for instance, in the Nineteenth Dynasty there are actually more stelae that depict an individual on a separate register (type C) than directly facing the deity. However, 21% of type C stelae belong to one man: the Senior Scribe, Ramose (p. 28). As Exell notes, once these are removed, one finds a trend very similar to the Twentieth Dynasty (i.e. the dominance of type A stelae). This observation allows the author to conduct an interesting analysis of the possible artistic and societal motivations of Ramose, and his preference for a more traditional type of stelae. Transitioning from her analysis of stela type, the author focuses on cult trends at Deir el-Medina, with special attention to divine hypostases and their accompanying epithets. Amun-Re is the god most represented on votive stelae in this study, but nearly 2/3 of the time he appears besides multiple gods. It is actually Meretseger and Ptah who have the most stelae dedicated to them alone (pp. 29-33). This is a fascinating observation about cultic activity Deir el-Medina, but the author does not speculate as to why Amun so often appears in the company of other gods. Cult images depicted on stelae are next discussed, as is their possible connection to cult statues, barques, and images found in temples and chapels. Exell attempts to connect specific cult images with specific cult locations. The attempt to connect images and epithets found in chapels and on temple walls to those found on stelae is unfortunately only dealt with in descriptive text. While the author herself admits that matching of iconography and epithets to specific cult locations is tentative at best, a stylistic analysis conducted by means of a photographic comparison of images and epithets (analysing orthography and paleography) might have offered a more convincing argument. It seems more likely that there was a general acceptance of divine forms that fit within an established iconographie repertoire. Deir el-Medina Ostracon 246 (to my knowledge the only text that deals with the commissioning of a votive stela) emphasizes this point: Please send it back to me right away today. Pay heed, pay heed! A depiction of Montu seated on a throne and a depiction of the scribe Pentawere kissing the ground before him in adoration of him—(to be) in outline drawing.3 While specific in the choice of iconography, deity pose, and his own pose, there is no mention of a specific hypostasis which the sculptor is to use as a model. Chapter IV analyses the possible motivations for commissioning votive stelae. Exell proposes that one of the central motivations was an attempt to record the public presence and/or participation at a specific royal visit, oracle procession, or festival. To focus on one example of such an event, Exell proposes that stelae depicting Ramesses II offering to Hathor actually commemorates the inauguration 1 B. Davies, Who's Who at Deir el-Medina: A Prosopographic Study of the Royal Workmen's Community (Leiden, 1999)· 2 The appendix lists a dynasty and reign (if it is possible to determine one). In the case of Ramesses II, some stelae are specifically assigned to the first or second half of his reign. 3 Ε. Ε Wente, Letters from Ancient Egypt (Atlanta, 1990), 139.</page><page sequence="3">34° REVIEWS JE A 99 of a cult temple of Hathor by the king. However, Exell has dated the various stelae which depict this event to different periods in the king's reign. Therefore, while it is possible that this is the case, it seems more likely that, in most cases, the imagery found on cult stelae represents a generalised conception of religious practice. The author herself makes a similar suggestion when it comes to oracle and festival processions, stating that such stelae may refer to more than one oracle or processional occasion and thus had more value if non-specihc in context (p. 76). Besides commemorating specific religious events, the author theorises that certain personal events, such as conception and birth, entry into a profession or career promotion, entry into a religious order, and illnesses and personal crises, may also have led to the creation of votive stelae. The wife of the Scribe Ramose, Mutemwia, appears on 2 of his 21 stelae. One of these stelae is dedicated to Qadesh, Min-Amun-Re, and Reshep, while the other is dedicated to Taweret. Exell interprets these stelae as representing a desire for conception due to the phallic nature of Min and the ties Taweret has to procreation. She further argues that the inclusion of women on stelae (alone, or with their husband) is best interpreted as a wish for conception and safe birth. Interestingly, it is noted that water offerings are almost exclusively given by women (29 of 32 cases). Men seem to only be depicted pouring water in connection with Amenhotep I, suggesting a cult setting that may have precluded the presence of women (p. 86). The reviewer noticed that the majority of the stelae depicting women are dedicated to Meretseger (5 of 12), followed by stelae dedicated to manifestations of Hathor, Renenut, and other goddesses. The gods most represented on votive stelae in this study (in descending order) are Amun Re, Meretseger, Amenhotep I/Ahmose Nefertari, Ptah, and Hathor. The lack of women connected to Amun-Re, Ptah, or Amenhotep I, may indicate that, at Deir el-Medina, women were not allowed to participate in the cults of male deities, or that decorum did not allow the representation of such practice unless accompanied by a male figure. Chapter V focuses on the votive material from sites outside Thebes. While the author's discussion of each site is well informed, and her attempt is admirable, she is limited by a lack of material from each comparative site (with the exception of Qantir) to conduct a thorough comparative analysis. There are only 7 stelae from Zawiyet Umm el-Rakham, 15 from Wadi es-Sebua (6 of which are dedicated by King's Son of Kush, Setau), and 21 from Abu Simbel (4 of which are dedicated by King's Son of Kush, Paser II). Chapter VI concludes the work and reiterates the possible societal motivations for creation of votive stelae as suggested throughout the work. The richness of the material which the author has collected and analysed is remarkable. The author makes many interesting and important observations about the social nature of votive stelae and possible reasons for their creation. This will no doubt inspire other scholars to adopt such an approach. The appendix provides an especially useful resource as it contains not only an index of titles, names, gods, and epithets, but also important descriptive information on types of offerings and positioning of donors, and a scholarly bibliography of each stela (which the reviewer found especially useful and accessible). There can be no doubt that this work will serve as an important resource in future studies of Egyptian stelae. Some specific points: pp. 36-7: Meretseger is described in the text (and summarised in the chart p. 29 fig. 3.5) as having 44 stelae dedicated to her. However, figure 3.11, which details the various manifestations of Meretseger, lists 50 total stelae (4 anthropomorphic, 21 mixed, and 21 zoomorphic, 4 lost/no form). p. 43: figure 3.14, meant to list the various forms of Amenhotep I/Queen Ahmose Nefertari on the Deir el-Medina stelae in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties, is not the correct chart. It is instead a reprinting of figure 3.11, which shows the various forms of Meretseger on Deir el-Medina Stelae in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties. p. 52: Hathor is described in the text (and summarised in the chart p. 29 fig. 3.5) as having 34 stelae dedicated to her. However, figure 3.19, which details the various manifestations of Hathor, lists 39 total stelae (21 anthropomorphic, 8 cow, 5 cat/swallow, 3 other, 2 lost/ no form). pp. 139-86, Appendix 1: examination of this catalogue of the stelae in the dataset reveals that 75 of 436 stelae in the database do not meet the author's criteria for inclusion (see above citations from p. 20 and p. 26): Stelae with owner in text only or lost (no relationship to deity): DB3, DB6, DB7, DBn, DB38, DB52, DB100, DB101, DB102, DB115, D117, DB125, DB148, DB149, DB159, DB161, DB167, DB170, DB181, DB184, DB191, DB206, DB241, DB242, DB248, DB249, DB251, DB259.</page><page sequence="4">2oi3 REVIEWS 341 Stelae with no donor title: DB6, DB46, DB108, DB111, DB112, DBi49, DB154, DB161, DB162, DB223, DB233, DB236, DB239, DB247, DB248, DB25S, DB256, DB258, DB259, DB280, DB289, DB294, DB304, DB315, DB319, DB344, DB355, DB361, DB368, DB376, DB380, DB382, DB397, DB400, DB404, DB410, DB411, DB412, DB413, DB414, DB41S, DB416, DB417, DB418, DB419, DB420, DB421, DB423, DB426, DB435.
