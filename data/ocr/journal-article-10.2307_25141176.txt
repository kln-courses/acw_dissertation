<plain_text><page sequence="1">A RELIEF FROM AMARAVATI Early stone sculpture from Northern India is fairly well represented in the Museum, as are the bronzes of a later period from the south, which are most strikingly exemplified by the great Natarajas or Dancing Sivas of about the fourteenth century; but it is only recently that a fragment of a marble relief from Amaravati has been acquired, to give partial repre sentation to this important locality. Amaravati is a town on the Kistna River in which a large Buddhist stupal was erected in the second century B.C. At a later date in the Andhra Period, probably in the second and third centuries A.D., the monument was encased in reliefs of greenish-gray marble. Early in the nineteenth century the stupa was destroyed, and what is now extant is presumably only a small part of the original output. Most of the remaining sculp tures are now in the museum in Madras, India, and in the British Museum in London. Others have been dispersed, and some have found their way to museums in America. The sculpture of Amaravati exemplifies the period of change from the representation of the Buddha by symbols to his repre sentation in anthropomorphic likeness. It gives evidence, more over, of the incorporation into Buddhist iconography of the spirits of local nature and fertility cults. In the Museum's relief there is no Buddha, but a central column with regularly spaced, bulbous capitals; a "pillar of flame"; nature spirits; and vegetative motifs.2 From the metaphysical point of view, the bulbous capitals symbolize the lotus, or Universal Ground of 1 A special kind of Buddhist shrine. 2 No. 43.72.

The small column at the base can be taken as the masculine symbol of divinity, the intellec tual operation of which is denoted by the flame. On top of this column is a precursor of the vajra, the double-ended trident that indicates pure Being. The nature motifs require more elaborate explanation as Buddhist symbols than can be given in this brief article.3 The difference between the more austere sculpture of the north and the voluptuous expression of the south is here evi dent. The upright central column seems to sprout from lush floral roots, and is flanked by rich, leafy scrolls and full, sinuous figures. In fact, the vibrating, undulating rhythm of the figures at the sides accentuates the perfect uprightness of the main pillar. HOWARD HOLLIS For further information on Buddhist symbolism, see A. K.
