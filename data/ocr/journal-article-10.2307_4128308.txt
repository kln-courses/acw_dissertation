Their role is explored through case studies of two sites by discussing the dynamics of their socio-political contexts and interconnections to everyday life. The tying of strips at these sites is the personal dedication of pilgrims to ancestors and saints, which are embedded in complex relationships related to how a community conceives and interacts with the tangible and intangible worlds around it. Keywords Central Asia; Kazakhstan; folk Islam; petroglyphs; sacred sites. Introduction In Central Asia an important form of dedicatory offering is the tying of rags on branches and other amenable surfaces at special places and sacred sites in the landscape. The phenomenon is found among the Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Turkmen and Uzbeks (e.g. Maksimova 1958; Tyson 1997) but it has been noted as a practice found among numerous peoples from Tibet and Afghanistan to Europe (Walhouse 1880; Hartland 1893). The nine- teenth-century account by the Kazakh scholar Chokan Valikhanov provides the essence of this and related offerings, which are still actively conducted today: 'a single tree growing in the steppe ... serves as an object of worship. All who ride by this tree hang upon it scraps of their clothing, rags, pots are placed beneath it, offerings of animals are made there or are tied to it by horse's hair' (Valikhanov 1961 [1904]: 113). Though Valikhanov utilizes the simplistic nineteenth-century interpretation of 'worship', his description can be further illuminated by comparison with the practices of present-day Rz Routledge Taylor&amp; Francis Group World Archaeology Vol. 36(1): 158-172 The Object of Dedication 0 2004 Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd ISSN 0043-8243 print/1470-1375 online DOI: 10.1080/0043824042000192605</page><page sequence="2">Rags and rock art 159 Central Asians. Turkmen Muslims in Turkmenistan, for example, also tie rags and small objects to branches of trees and bushes at shrines and holy sites (Tyson 1997: 27). The strips themselves are called ilem and signify a Turkmen's wish or dedication to the saint of the place. Turkmen also call them mata or mata b6legi (a piece of cloth), while the Kazakhs call them mata. During my field research, into the rock art of the Republic of Kazakhstan, I had found the practice of rag tying directly associated with the two important petroglyph sites of Tamgaly and Terekty Aulie (Lymer 2000, 2002) (Fig. 1). These sites are significant to Central Asian archaeology as they contain large concentrations of rock art depictions that date as early as the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1400 BC) and extend into other later periods up to the present day. Rags tied on bushes at these sites have been dismissed by scientists steeped in positivistic rationalism or Marxist-based atheism as the frivolous by-products of the 'opium of the masses', religion. This narrow focus upon past remains by investiga- tors has ignored the fact that archaeological sites are engaged with by different kinds of individuals from a variety of cultural backgrounds. The thin strips of cloth may not be petroglyphs, lithics or metal artefacts, the stock in trade of archaeologists, but, as objects of dedication they are worthy of scholarly attention with direct implications for Central Asian archaeology: they lie at the centre of a web of religious practices which actively incorporate rock art sites in Kazakhstan into the landscape of Islamic pilgrimage. Through the case studies of Tamgaly and Terekty Aulie, it is proposed here that the role of the tied rags can be approached through recent theorizations of sacred sites in the landscape, and the consideration of their dynamic natures by embedding them in their cultural and socio-political contexts, while at the same time conceptualizing them as an intimate part of every day life (Carmichael et al. 1994; van Dommelen 1999; Humphrey RUSSIAN FEDERATION \ RUSSIAN FEDERATION ? -- ,.)

The Marxist-based dismissal of religion, in contrast, portrays religion as a phenomenon disjunct from society, a view which is in part derived from the post-Enlightenment division of society into separate spheres such as art, politics, religion, science, etc. (Tambiah 1990). Such artificial divisions create disassociated domains whereby ordinary life becomes further devalued and disconnected from people's living experiences. In the field of religious studies there has been an acknowledgement that the distinctions between religious and non-religious are not as rigid as the 'sacred versus secular' argument presents it; many communities do not partition their lives into separate components of religion, society, etc., for people live lives in which these are interconnected, entwined and inseparable (Harvey 2000: 2). It is time to approach sacred sites from a more nuanced and potentially more productive perspective, which recognizes that the landscape is not reducible into disparate components of 'sacred' and 'secular' as the everyday lives of people interact in complex relationships among themselves and the world around them. Places in the landscape have many potential uses and certain points can be special locations where significant relationships and connections can be realized (Blain and Wallis 2002: 20-2). The discussion of these complexities provides greater understanding of the dynamic socio-political roles that sacred sites play in the landscape. Therefore it is argued here that the rags at Tamgaly and Terekty Aulie do not merely mark sites special to Kazakh Muslims, but are the personal dedications of the pilgrims to the ancestors and saints of a place, which are deeply embedded in a nexus of relationships related to how a local community conceives and interacts with the tangible and intangible worlds around it. Kazakh Muslims Present-day Kazakh Muslims of Kazakhstan have retained their Islamic heritage despite years of anti-religious campaigns enforced against Islamic and all other religious phenomena during the Soviet period (e.g. Bennigsen and Lemercier-Quelquejay 1967; Bennigsen and Wimbush 1985; Subtelny 1989). Islam in Kazakhstan was portrayed in the Soviet conception of religion as a superstitious relic, which had survived from earlier barbaric feudal times (e.g. Petrash 1981). However, this was based in the nine- teenth-century idea of the unilinear evolution of societies from 'primitive' to 'civilized'. Kazakh religion has also been described by scholars inside and outside the former Soviet Union as 'folk', 'popular', 'ritual' or 'everyday' Islam (e.g. Basilov 1987; Olcott 1987; Mustafina 1992; Poliakov 1992). These terms have also been pejoratively employed in a way that implies a less than authentic form of Islam, and the everyday beliefs of Kazakh Muslims have been characterized as superstitious domestic rituals that lack the education of formal teachings (e.g. Olcott 1987: 197). This follows from another former Soviet policy of separating Islam into the everyday practices of local communities and 'Orthodox' or 'official' Islam tolerated by the state through the lens of pre-industrial tradition versus modernity (Saroyan 1997: 104-5). Undoubtedly, 'Orthodox' forms of Islam are directly related to mosques and classrooms, but in contemporary Kazakhstan, as in other societies across the Muslim world, this is not the only vehicle of expression of religious beliefs; spirituality can also be demonstrated through the practice of domestic rites and</page><page sequence="4">Rags and rock art 161 pilgrimages to saints' shrines and family cemeteries (Saroyan 1997; Tyson 1997; Privratsky 2001: 245). Despite its previous negative connotations, the term 'folk Islam' can be critically used in discussing local heterodox and synthetic mediations of Central Asian Islam. It is generally recognized that contemporary Islam is not uniformly static across the Muslim world; there is a mosaic of forms and practices steeped in Islamic traditions, the result of continuously ongoing processes embedded in local historical circumstances (e.g. Geertz 1968; Gellner 1981; Gilsenan 1990). In this article 'folk Islam' is used to refer to the unique Kazakh negotiations that involve both Islam and local traditions as well as their embeddedness in complex social processes that are dynamic and multi-faceted. Kazakh Muslims belong to the Sunni branch of Islam (Bacon 1966: 42; Akiner 1986: 301), which has been infused with Sufism in the past (Mustafina 1992; Privratsky 2001). Notably, one of the most famous and ancient of Central Asian Sufi brotherhoods, the Yasawiya, was stationed in the historic city of Turkestan in southern Kazakhstan. Turkestan has been an important centre of Sufi teaching since the twelfth century AD. Sufism, like other aspects of Islam, was discredited by anti-religious policies and in Kazakhstan no Sufi brotherhood survived beyond the early Soviet period (Bennigsen and Wimbush 1985; Privratsky 2001: 56-7). Though Kazakh religion lacks the esoteric features of 'classical' Sufism, elements of Sufi mysticism continue to play a role in Kazakh spiritu- ality (Privratsky 2001: 16). In particular, Kazakh Muslims place an emphasis on ayan (Arabic: personal revelation), the illuminationist dimension of Sufi spirituality, which manifests in Kazakh dreams and visionary experiences and impels religious behaviour at shrines and in the household. The other important aspect of Sufism drawn upon by the Kazakhs involves the pilgrimage to saints' tombs, ziyarat. Throughout the Muslim world, the common alterna- tive to the pilgrimage to Mecca involves the process of ziyara, continual visits to local holy places, shrines or individual saints' tombs (Saroyan 1997: 106ff.; Insoll 1999: 113-14). The Kazakh meaning of the word ziyarat refers to 'a visit for imparting greetings', but it is connected particularly with visiting Muslim saints (Kaz. aulie) and 'sainted' places (Kaz. aulieli zher) where they are buried (Privratsky 2001: 154). The most famous destination in Kazakhstan is the ancient city of Turkestan, where the tomb of Saint Ahmet Yasawi, the ancient founder of the Yasawiya Sufi brotherhood, resides as well as that of several other shrines for other saints. Ahmet Yasawi and his spiritual power, bereke (Kazakh form of the Arabic word baraka), reside in his tomb (Privratsky 2001: 3). Kazakhs visit this and other shrines to encounter the bereke that emanates from the living presence of the saints at tombs and shrines. In Muslim cultures that focus on shrine activities ziyarat becomes a variation on the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca (Privratsky 2001: 90). Privratsky also reports that some Kazakhs consider that taking three ziyarat journeys to the holy shrine of Saint Ahmet Yasawi in Turkestan can be an acceptable approximation to the hajj. The Kazakh word aulie derives from Arabic wali, God's representative, and both words are commonly translated into English as 'saint'. Unlike in the Catholic Church where a central authority canonizes saints, in Islam the saints are chosen by localized historical factors. The Kazakh aulie, like their counterparts in the Muslim world, may have been a living person who was the heir of a Sufi master or an individual with qualities of piety, the knowledge of God and who had performed miracles during their lifetime (Hoffman 1999). Their holy life allows them to become an agent of the power of God and local</page><page sequence="5">162 Kenneth Lymer mediator of baraka blessings. Prayers can be offered only to God alone; therefore lesser devotions in the Kazakh acts of dedication to the saints and ancestors are to be distin- guished from the worship of God (Privratsky 2001: 161). Ziyarat does not take people only to saints' shrines but also to family graves to meet with the Kazakh ancestors, ata-baba. The ancestors are not simply genealogical progeni- tors but also Kazakh Muslim women and men of the past imbued with the same bereke, spiritual power, as the saints (Privratsky 2001: 150-1). Therefore the graves of deceased relatives hold special qualities, like a shrine of a Muslim saint, and to visit them is essentially the same act of ziyarat. There is a symbiotic relationship between the Kazakh ancestors and saints and this is can be seen particularly in Kazakh dreams, which, as briefly discussed above, are based within Sufi tradition. The saints can reveal themselves to the pilgrim in a dream at a shrine, while Kazakh ancestors can appear in dreams instructing a person to conduct a special household rite for commemorating ancestors or impelling an individual to go on shrine pilgrimage (Privratsky 2001: 186-7). Kazakhs also commonly see in their dreams their mothers, fathers or ancestors and they receive warnings of impending troubles. Rock art and ziyarat Tamgaly is the most famous petroglyph site in Kazakhstan and it has received much scholarly attention since its archaeological discovery in 1957 (e.g. Maksimova 1958; Maksimova et al. 1985; Francfort et al. 1995; Rogozhinskii 1999, 2001). The Tamgaly valley is found along the northern edge of the Anrakhai mountains about 170-80km north-west from the city of Almaty (Fig. 1). Numerous petroglyphs were carved into the exposed sandstone bedrock and placed on surfaces along hills, valleys, summits and slopes. The majority of the petroglyphs are located in the main valley which is 'enclosed' between Andronovo cist cemeteries (Middle to Late Bronze Age, c. 1400-1000 Bc) at either end of the valley (Rogozhinskii 1999). The petroglyphs are argued, from associations with the surrounding Andronovo cemeteries, to belong predominantly to the Bronze Age (c. 1400-1000 BC). There are also petroglyphs stylistically correlating with the Sako-Scythian period (c. 500 BC) and the Early Turkic period (c. AD 500) as well as images from more recent historical times up to present-day graffiti (Maksimova et al. 1985). Of all petro- glyph sites in Kazakhstan, Tamgaly has been the most extensively cited in the literature because of its scenes of the so-called 'solar-headed' gods1 - anthropomorphic figures with large round heads emitting 'rays' (Fig. 2). The 'solar gods' and their associated petroglyph imagery are coupled with the adjacent Andronovo graves by archaeologists who argue that Tamgaly was a great Bronze Age 'ritual sanctuary' (e.g. Mar'yashev and Goryachev 1998; Rogozhinskii 1999). The tying of rags at Tamgaly was also noted at its time of discovery in 1957 when archaeologists first discovered the area (Maksimova 1958: 110). Presently, in the 'centre' of the Tamgaly valley there is an open area with large bushes growing along the river. All these bushes are covered with numerous white strips tied to their thin branches. They are in a natural enclosed area surrounded by rocky hills covered with petroglyphs. On a high ledge overlooking the bushes is one of the most celebrated scenes of the 'solar-headed</page><page sequence="6">Rags and rock art 163 20 cm Figure 2 The famous scene of 'solar-headed' gods from Tamgaly petroglyph group 4 (tracing used with the kind permission of A. Rozwadowski). gods' (Fig. 2) and Kazakh pilgrims have tied rags to the small scraggy bushes growing directly in front of it. In the north 'entrance' of the Tamgaly valley there are more hillsides covered with petroglyphs and rags have been even tied on small jutting rocks near petroglyph scenes. The other large petroglyph site important to ziyarat activity is Terekty Aulie, which is located outside of the city of Zhezkazgan in Central Kazakhstan (Fig. 1). The Kazakh word aulie (Muslim saint) refers directly to Terekty Aulie's contemporary role as the focus of folk Islamic pilgrimage: the local Kazakhs have erected a small shrine upon the highest hill in the area (Plate 1), which is placed directly atop two large scenes of petroglyphs (Fig. 3). The shrine hill of Terekty Aulie, as well as the two other adjacent hills, is covered with ancient petroglyphs, which are argued to be predominantly Bronze Age (c. 1400 BC) in date based on their stylistic proximity to animal figures on Seimo-Turbino objects found in Kazakhstan (Samashev and Zhumabekova 1996). Within the immediate vicinity there are a few Middle Bronze Age burials (c. 1500 BC) as well as a nineteenth-century AD Kazakh cemetery (Samashev et al. 1999, 2000). Rags have been tied to all stray bushes growing from the cracks in the granite hillsides of the Terekty Aulie area. Terekty Aulie is an important destination of Islamic pilgrimage within the Zhezkazgan</page><page sequence="7">164 Kenneth Lymer region, as local pilgrims come to visit the shrine erected above the petroglyphs and pay respect to the mausoleums of the nineteenth-century cemetery beside the shrine hill. During the two field seasons of my petroglyph research I was able to observe and meet pilgrims visiting Terekty Aulie (Lymer 2000). They were mainly women who set up rugs near the shrine and kept vigil with their copies of the Quran. The Terekty Aulie shrine itself is a medium-sized stone slab covered with thick layers of white rags and erected in a crack between two rock surfaces covered with petroglyphs (Plate 1 and Fig. 3). At its base were placed small stones that were individually wrapped with thin strips of cloth. During times of adverse weather conditions the pilgrims would sit on their rugs in the grotto directly beneath the shrine and continue to keep their vigils. The grotto walls and floors were covered with ancient petroglyphs of camels and horses. Below, in a space by a natural spring near the cemetery, their menfolk would prepare a fire and bring out a goat from the car. After their devotions the women would tie a rag around the shrine and join their family below. The goat was sacrificed and eaten by all. Rags were also tied onto nearby branches or on the cemetery fence (Plate 2). A gift of paper currency (Kazakh tenge) was inserted within the rag and this assisted in the blessing they sought. The folk Islamic practices at Terekty Aulie are similar to those conducted at Turkestan: Kazakh pilgrims recite the Quran at shrines and give alms in the name of the saint for protection from misfortune. Afterwards they visit family graves in their respective cemetery and recite the Quran there before returning home (Privratsky 2001: 155). Visits to Turkestan shrines always involve the recitation of the Quran and dedications of food to Figure 3 The petroglyphs at the base of the Terekty Aulie shrine (diagrammatic reconstruction by author). Note: there is an image of a bull among the numerous forms of horses, which is indicated by a small arrow.</page><page sequence="8">Rags and rock art 165 Plate 1 The Terekty Aulie shrine with the nineteenth-century Kazakh cemetery in the background (photo by author).

The Kazakhs believe that the spiritual force of the shrine sanctifies the sacrificial animal (as it does the monetary gift) and the execution of the act becomes the essence of the pilgrims' offering (Privratsky 2001: 189). The tradition of slaughtering animals for 'memo- rial meals' at holy sites is another common feature among Central Asian peoples. In Turkmenistan, the Turkmen hold special meals at shrines, which are given in honour of the saint by the pilgrims (Tyson 1997: 30). This is done to seek the saint's assistance or give thanks for the favourable outcome of a previous pilgrimage to the saint. Feasting can also be seen in the greater pattern of everyday activities as it is part and parcel of activities in Central Asian people's lives. In particular, the day-to-day religious practices of the Kazakhs have been described as 'a pattern of culinary events and ceremonial meals where food and a Quran recital are dedicated to the ancestor-spirits' (Privratsky 2001: 18). Miraculous events and special powers emanating from shrines and tombs are common in Sufi-based folk Islam in the Muslim world (e.g. Geertz 1968: 48-54). The grotto below the shrine at Terekty Aulie was used by women for night vigils, which also involved waiting for the reception of a significant dream. Privratsky notes from the activities conducted at shrines around Turkestan that women desiring to conceive a child will drink from a sacred well and sleep overnight at the shrine of Arstan Bab, in particular, in order to receive a dream message from the saint (Privratsky 2001: 160). Dreams may also call someone to a new vocation and, for Kazakh healers, it is essential that a helping spirit is sought in their dreams. The Kazakh healer falls within the tradition of the aulie by healing sick persons through the technique of breathing on them after reciting verses from the Quran (ibid.). Local people also come to experience the healing properties of Terekty Aulie itself, which is reputed to cure colds, barrenness, nerve disorders and other illnesses (Samashev et al. 1999: 5). Similarly, Turkmen pilgrims journey to saints' shrines and holy sites in Turkmenistan to meditate, seek cures for physical ailments and insanity or, for women, to seek fertility (Tyson 1997: 28). This comes from the common folk Islamic belief that the power of saints can inhabit special places. The foremost example of this is the shrine of Saint Ahmet Yasawi in the city of Turkestan (Kazakhstan) where his body and spiritual power, bereke, reside in the tomb. To receive a blessing or bereke from this saint and others at shrines and cemeteries in and around Turkestan, Kazakhs will brush their faces with semi-cupped hands within the sacred area (Privratsky 2001: 52). They may also make a quiet invocation to the saint for personal matters. Privratsky also points out that these same practices are performed after meals in Kazakh households and these domestic practices connect their everyday lives to ziyarat, the acts of pilgrimage to holy places. Terekty Aulie is believed to have been originally discovered by the travelling prophet Khazrat Ali, son-in-law of Muhammad, and, according to local pilgrims, the petroglyphs were also derived from his visitation (Samashev et al. 1999: 5). It is common to find, in particular, footprint markings of prophets and saints at Islamic shrines from the Caucasus and Iran to Pakistan and India (e.g. Saroyan 1997: 106; King et al. 1998: 189). At Terekty Aulie and Tamgaly there are petroglyph images of human footsteps (Fig. 4) and there are also petroglyphs that resemble horse hooves at Terekty Aulie (Fig. 5). Further apprecia- tion of the significance of these engravings can be gained by comparison with related</page><page sequence="10">Rags and rock art 167 Figure 4 Petroglyphs of footprints from Terekty Aulie (tracing by author). 0 ancm 10 o0 m s Figure 5 A horse hoof petroglyph from Terekty Aulie (tracing by Zh. Zhetybaev). phenomena in Turkmenistan. The Turkmen Muslims have a tradition of their saints being connected with local rock features. Turkmen saints, heroes and heroines leave their marks in the landscape by the transformation of melons into stone, the splitting of particular rocks, or by leaving impressions in stone from their legendary disappearances into the hillsides (Tyson 1997). Tyson also reports that this is a common feature to Turkmen saints' shrines and holy sites lacking tombs or burials. The Hazret Ali shrine in Turkmenistan is the focus of Islamic saint pilgrimages and impressions in the rock at the site are believed by the Turkmen pilgrims to be derived from Ali's hands and the hooves of his horse Duldul (Tyson 1997: 28). Perhaps the footprints at Tamgaly and Terekty Aulie (Figs 4-5) could have been impressions created not only by Ali but by other saints or Kazakh heroes, batyr, of legend and the horse hoof petroglyphs at Terekty Aulie may have belonged especially to Ali's steed, Duldul. The petroglyphs of Tamgaly and Terekty Aulie were part and parcel of the overall significance of place, which Kazakhs sought in their ziyarat pilgrimages and actively incorporated into Kazakh engagements with the world around them. A poignant example of this comes from my brief conversation with a Kazakh woman whom I met at the Terekty Aulie shrine during my first field season (1999). She was impressed by the animal petroglyphs and especially emphatic about the image of a bull (Fig. 3) and its relationship to her personal cosmology. The ethnographer Vladimir Basilov (1987: 15) had also noted that it was still possible to meet elder Central Asians who believed the world was flat and was supported on the horns of a bull. However, these local perceptions do not simply and mimetically reproduce the given attributes of the place, for present-day practices acknowledge and dynamically interact with the archaeological artefacts of past societies. Kazakh interactions are enmeshed in negotiations between local traditions and Islam as well as between their engagements with the petroglyph site and people's daily lives.</page><page sequence="11">168 Kenneth Lymer Landscape and Kazakh identity The practices of pilgrimages to sacred sites and tying rags by the Kazakhs and other Central Asian peoples could be seen as their unique negotiations in their adoption of aspects of Islam. The holy sites are not only abodes of miraculous power, which serves to maintain health and well-being and ward off harmful forces, but also places where local communities engage with facets of Islam and practise it in their own particular ways. It has been recognized that Sufism and pilgrimage together in many parts of the Muslim world have provided the primary foundation for the mediation of Islam (Geertz 1968: 51). At such sites in Central Asia, Muslims not only learn but also participate and pass down customs and rituals, and discuss issues of power, piety, virtue and proper behaviour along with other Islamic values and teachings (Tyson 1997: 32). These holy sites are available to all persons in the community and the specific local character of the sites contributes to communal identity. Therefore, not only does a special place become an important local holy site but it also becomes a nexus point where the local community, its cultural heritage and their Islamic traditions intertwine, fuse and develop. The importance of these shrines was made even greater during the anti-religious policies of Soviet times. Pilgrimages were recognized by the Soviet authorities as being subversive but were not as a great threat as the propagation of theology and institutions of urban Islam which anti-religious attacks focused upon (Bennigsen and Wimbush 1985; Subtelny 1989). Furthermore, shrine pilgrimages involved sacrifices of meat and bread, which are the same activities as are conducted in people's daily lives in the form of communal meals in Kazakh homes. These food offerings continued through the Soviet period in the privacy of the home as public Islamic rituals were targets of anti-religious policies (Privratsky 2001: 188). Domestic religious practices went on quietly and became an element of Kazakh culture that survived 'Sovietization', while their fully nomadic economy and residential patterns of living in mobile tents (yurts) did not (Privratsky 2001: 241). The case of Terekty Aulie also highlights the continuity of Kazakh ways from pre-Soviet times. The petroglyphs and the specialness of the place were noticed by Kazakh groups in the nineteenth century and they built their mausolea at the base of a hill covered with petroglyphs upon which the shrine was erected. Thus the Kazakhs incorporated a given archaeological feature into their landscape and transformed it into a place of their own construction: a necral space of mausolea and a place of pilgrimage which honours the dead, ancestors and saints with dedications most visibly represented by cloth rags tied to amenable surfaces. Reverence towards shrines and cemeteries is an important feature of the folk Islamic practices among Central Asian peoples (e.g. Basilov 1970; Subtelny 1989; Chaudhry 1997; Tyson 1997; Privratsky 2001). Cemeteries dotted along the Kazakh steppes are also a strikingly visible aspect of the Muslim heritage of the Kazakhs. The Terekty Aulie cemetery itself is composed of mud-brick mausolea from the nineteenth century inter-mixed with modern brick constructions (Samashev et al. 1999, 2000). The cemetery follows the Kazakh mortuary practice of erecting domed mausolea in honour of their buried ancestors, which connects them architecturally to the major tombs and shrines of Sufi tradition (e.g. Turkestan) and reaffirms the Islamic heritage of their Kazakh ancestors. The Terekty Aulie cemetery is one of many found all over Kazakhstan that provide another link for contemporary Kazakhs to their historical past.</page><page sequence="12">Rags and rock art 169 The saints (aulie) lie at the boundaries between the Kazakhs and the powers of the spiritual world and also between contemporary Kazakh identities and their Muslim connections to the past. As Privratsky found during his ethnographic studies of the Kazakhs, 'in Kazakhstan a Muslim shrine is sacred space not only because of the saint buried there, but also because the saint legitimates the Kazakh ancestors' (Privratsky 2001: 189). The aulie mediates between Kazakh Muslims and God and the Kazakh ancestors were devoted to the saints, which in turn confirms the Islamic heritage of the Kazakhs (Privratsky 2001: 162). The Kazakh pilgrims who visit saints at holy sites connect these spiritual beings and their ancestors together, as they are both with God. At the shrine, Kazakh activities, such as rag tying and related actions of veneration, are appropri- ating the same kind of spiritual power that is present in the invocation of the ancestor-spirits at home. Therefore, the saints do not mediate only blessings from God (bereke) but Kazakh cultural heritage as well. Conclusion Thin strips of cloth may not have the permanence of petroglyphs or stone tools, but they play an active role in re-incorporating archaeological sites into the contempo- rary religious practices of Kazakh Muslims. The rags visibly distinguish special places in the landscape, which are the focus of movements embedded in folk Islamic activities of ziyarat, holy site pilgrimage. Ziyarat, in turn, plays a larger role in Kazakh ancestral obligations, and visits to the saints and their shrines are inseparable from duties to the ancestors. The rags lie at the heart of complex processes of consumption, transformation and re-incorporation of significant places and repre- sent the resistance of the Kazakh landscape through times of socio-political tension and upheaval. Through the lens of contemporary approaches to sacred sites and landscape, tied rags at archaeological sites and other significant places can be moved from the fringes of idle curiosities and relocated as central to the activities of people's daily lives. Archaeologists and related professionals may be custodians and investigators of ancient sites, but they are not the only ones interacting with these places, as indicated, indeed, by the presence of rags. Though the fabric strips are archaeologically ephemeral they are significant in straddling the boundaries of personal, social and religious realities in the landscape. The importance of these and similar votive objects should not be overlooked as their contem- porary roles provide an invaluable contribution towards furthering discussions about objects of dedication in the past as well as the present.
