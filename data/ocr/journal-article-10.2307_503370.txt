Their sim- plicity of form, their austerity of style and the in- trinsic beauty of the raw material itself combine to invest these objects with a dignity and a direct- ness of impact which is almost without parallel in prehistoric art. In recent years they have been much praised by art historians and greatly valued by collectors.' Despite their considerable importance for the history of art, these small sculptures, or figurines, which vary in size from about 5 cm. to i.5 m., have received little serious attention from archaeologists.2 In particular, there has been no analysis of the con- texts in which the excavated examples were found. This lack of appreciation of the associated finds has prevented the establishing of an adequate relative chronology for them. Thus most writers express doubt as to whether the schematic figurines pre- 1 In writing this article I have received valuable assistance from Dr. Stylianos Alexiou, Professor J. L.

The schematic "violin" figurine and the more detailed Folded-Arm figurine (hereafter FAF) are universally recognized, but other forms have often been considered somewhat eccentric varia- tions, mere caprices on the part of the sculptor. On the contrary, however, there are several evident and distinct varieties within the FAF complex, al- though they have never been clearly defined. There are several distinct types of schematic figurine, and other distinct and separable types, such as the Plas- tiras type, which is described below. Some attempts have already been made at the religious and aesthetic interpretation of the Cycla- dic figurines.4 But such speculation seems rather premature in advance of a systematic study of the various forms and of their contexts, which alone can provide an adequate chronological foundation. For only through the recurrent associations of the different types can a relative chronology be estab- lished. The present article sets out, by such a study of contexts, and by the definition of the principal forms, to outline a chronology for the figurines, making use of recent researches in the Cyclades. A discussion of the antecedents and origin of the various forms then becomes possible, aided by the discovery of Cycladic Neolithic cul- tures within the last five years. The question of the religious or symbolic interpretation of the figurines, and of the aesthetic problems which they present, is not here considered.5 The chronological basis on which the following observations rest is the division of the materials from the settlements and cemeteries of the Cycladic Early Bronze Age into three cultures, Grotta-Pelos, Keros-Syros, Phylakopi I, of which the first two are further subdivided into groups.6 This divi- sion of the Cycladic material has recently been corroborated by a seriation analysis of the Cycladic cemeteries, executed with the aid of the IBM 7094 computer at the University of California at Los Angeles.7 The figurines of the three Early Cycladic cultures are considered in the four sections which follow. In the final section their origin and affinities with other Aegean figurines are discussed. The word "type" is used throughout to indicate a distinct form defined by the clustering of several traits or features, repeated in several examples. It is therefore a statistical concept: a single figurine does not alone constitute a type.8 The Cycladic figurines, like the Cycladic pottery and marble ves- sels of the same cultures, fall very clearly into type categories." The FAFs and the Plastiras figu- rines, for example, form distinct, well represented groups (clusters, types) without many ungrouped intermediate forms. This is perhaps surprising, particularly in comparison with the very much greater freedom and variety of the Hacilar figu- rines, for example, or those of the Vinia culture. Such pronounced clustering of traits allows the es- tablishing of meaningful types without a strict and formal statistical analysis. The subdivisions or varieties within the FAF type are less well defined, and a formal analysis would here be illuminating. The subdivisions put 3 Preziosi 105; Zervos 47; E.

I hope to present this material in greater detail in a monograph now in preparation. ?C. Renfrew and G. Sterud, "Close-proximity analysis, a rapid method for the ordering of archaeological materials," American Antiquity, forthcoming. 8 The concept of type in archaeology has been considerably refined recently through the application of statistical tech- niques, some of them developed for the biological sciences, cf. J. R. Sackett, "Quantitative analysis of Upper Palaeolithic stone tools," American Anthropologist 68 (1966) 356; R. R. Sokal and P. H. A. Sneath, Principles of Numerical Taxonomy (1963). In applying numerical taxonomy to human artefacts and cultures it should not be forgotten that these are not biological species, and the assumption that the methods and conclusions applied in biology are equally valid for archaeo- logical material may be a misleading one. Indeed the criticisms leveled in the biological sciences at concepts like that of type do not necessarily hold for archaeological material, where the hand of a sentient Maker may often be assumed. 9 In numerical taxonomic terms the operational units (figu- rines) fall readily into well-separated and compact phenetic clusters even when a high coefficient of similarity is selected as the criterion for clustering.</page><page sequence="3">1969] EARLY CYCLADIC FIGURINES 3 forward in this class must therefore be regarded as tentative. Unfortunately the number of FAFs de- riving from excavated contexts is limited, and the authenticity of many of the others is open to doubt, so that a detailed formal analysis of well authenti- cated or associated specimens would be difficult."0 It is hoped that the chronological and regional divisions established will banish some of the con- fusion which has surrounded these very attractive objects. They may also, perhaps, indicate a path for further research. For while the recognition of the hand of individual craftsmen may perhaps seem an ambitious hope in the case of objects so basically simple, there are variations and similarities between figurines within the various types and varieties which remain to be explained. In particular, the realization that the large and elegant figurines manufactured during the later half of the Cycladic Early Bronze Age (and with them the charming musicians) represent the prod- uct of nearly two millennia of artistic activity in the Cyclades, may lead to a reassessment of the religious and artistic principles which governed their production. FIGURINES OF THE GROTTA-PELOS CULTURE The Grotta-Pelos culture of the Cyclades was the first to develop during the earlier part of the Early Bronze Age. It shows just a few similarities with the earlier Saliagos culture of the Neolithic period. A new feature, however, was the burial of the dead in cemeteries of cist graves, like the celebrated Pelos cemetery in Melos. Most of the material pre- served from this culture derives, in fact, from the cemeteries, although several settlements are known, including Grotta in Naxos, from which the culture partly takes its name."1 The principal forms of the cemetery assemblage are the pyxides, cylindrical or spherical (the latter often footed), and the "suspension jar" with verti- cal lug handles. These types often have incised herringbone decoration.'2 The chief marble types are the open bowl, the "kandili," and the rhyton or beaker."3 Metal objects are not found. The pres- ence of any one of these types is sufficient to estab- lish a grave as belonging to the Grotta-Pelos cul- ture.4 The marble vessels generally occur without pottery, and the graves containing them constitute a sub-group of the culture, the Plastiras group. The homogeneity of this material is well indi- cated by some typical graves of the Grotta-Pelos culture, inventories of which have been published in full. Particularly noteworthy are Graves I, 7, 8, and 31 to 36 in Naxos; and Graves 21 to 24, 82, 84, 91, 93, 96, 98, 00oo, I3, 105, II3, II4 and II7 in Paros-Antiparos." Others in Naxos and Paros have recently been excavated by Mr. C. Doumas. It is not difficult, therefore, to establish the figu- rine types which occur in the Grotta-Pelos assem- blage. In no case whatever do these types occur in secure contexts of the later Keros-Syros or Phyla- kopi I cultures. Nor are figurines typical of the Keros-Syros culture found in Grotta-Pelos graves. One may therefore place some confidence in the associations, although these are not very numerous. Chronologically the Grotta-Pelos culture is to be equated with the Kum Tepe Ib culture of the Troad and the early part of the Troy I culture, with the Early Minoan I of Crete, and the Early Helladic I and the preceding phase of the Greek mainland. Radiocarbon dates for mainland Greece accord adequately with such cross-datings as can be made with Egypt and Mesopotamia."6 On the present C-I4 chronology, the duration may be set from 3200 or 3000 B.C. to about 2500 B.C.17 I. Schematic figurines (ill. 1) Most common in the graves of the culture are the very simple flat figurines or "Brettidolen." They are 10oThe principal excavations which have yielded Cycladic figurines are those of Bent, Tsountas, Mackenzie, Stephanos, Doumas and Caskey in the Cyclades, as well as those of Xan- thoudides and Alexiou in Crete and Mylonas in Attica. These excavated figurines have been considered here as well as those in the National Museum in Athens, the Naxos, Apeiranthos and other Cycladic museums, the Herakleion Museum, the British Museum, the National Museum in Copenhagen, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and the N. P. Goulandris Col- lection. Most of the figurines in these collections may be ac- cepted as authentic through the circumstances of their acquisi- tion. In particular, most figurines acquired and published be- fore about 1920 can be regarded as genuine. 11Cf. N.

M. Stuiver and H. E. Suess, Radiocarbon 8 [1966] 534). The EB I cultures of the Aegean, including the Grotta-Pelos culture, may all thus be several centuries earlier than the dates given here.</page><page sequence="4">I.A l.B I.C I.E I.D VI VII Be. Ku.

Many of them have prong-like necks, but none have separate heads. In this they differ from the schematic figurines of the Keros-Syros culture (Type VI infra), and from some Anatolian ones. These figurines were especially numerous in the graves of Paros, Antiparos and Dhespotikon. One grave, no. 103 in the Pyrgos cemetery in Paros, contained no fewer than fourteen such figurines, and the various schematic forms described below seem to have been contemporary. There are also intermediate forms between the varieties defined. Schematic figurines of this kind have also been found in Naxos, Siphnos, Melos, Kimolos, Amor- gos, Santorin and Kea. I.A. Violin form18 (ill. I, I.A; pl. 2, d). The base, and usually the shoulders also, are distinct- ly rounded, while the waist is marked by a pro- nounced and wide indentation. The neck is shown by a long prong and the outline somewhat resem- bles that of a violin. The front is often incised to indicate the neck and shoulders, and more rarely the waist. Notable examples of this form were found by Tsountas in Paros and Antiparos,19 and there are several examples from Kimolos, Siphnos,20 Kea and probably Amorgos. I.B. Notch waisted form21 (ill. I, I.B). The neck is again indicated by a prong, but the overall form is rather simpler. The shoulders are squarish and the base flat or slightly curved. The waist is in- dicated by a notch at each side. There are often incisions at the neck, and sometimes a line joins the notches at the waist. Examples are known chiefly from Paros and Antiparos22 and there is an example from Amorgos. I.C. Shouldered form23 (ill. i, I.C). The neck is again indicated by a prong, and the shoulders are pronounced, with arm stumps. The figurine as a whole resembles a torso in outline. The incisions are limited to the shoulders. A figurine of very similar shape was found at the Neolithic settle- ment of Saliagos near Antiparos2" (pl. 2, c). I.D. Pebble form25 (ill. I, I.D; pl. 2 b). The shape is a simple and sometimes irregular oblong or oval, without any separation at the neck. In many cases they may not be worked at all, being no more than specially selected pebbles. Bent found several of this shape in Antiparos, which he dis- carded, only later realizing that they were figurines. Others have been found at the Neolithic site of Saliagos2" (pl. 2, a). I.E. Tripartite form (ill. I, I.E). The simple oval shape is twice indented at each side, giving an out- line of three superimposed convex curves. This unusual form is known also from Naxos, and simi- lar figurines were found in the EB i and EB 2 levels at Beycesultan.27 I.A-I.E. Grotta-Pelos culture I.A. Violin form. AM AE 416.

I, d-e) This type, not hitherto defined, has long been known from an example found by Tsountas in Grave 23 at Glypha in Paros (II.i on the list infra). The head is oval, and usually has ears in relief as well as the nose. Sometimes the mouth and eyes are marked also. The hands meet above the waist, finger to finger (the arms are not folded), and the navel is indicated. The knee caps are usually pro- nounced, and the figure stands upright on feet which are flat on the ground. The type cannot thus be termed "schematic." Four examples were found by Mr. C. Doumas in the Plastiras cemetery in Paros, and two others by him in the Akrotiri ceme- tery in Naxos. The associations are principally marble kandilia of the Grotta-Pelos culture, and constitute, together with marble rhyta, what I have termed the Plastiras Group. II.i.

Related to these are several male figurines, with arms similarly meeting at the waist, and similarly well rounded legs. The first, with eyes, nose and mouth indicated in relief, is from Antiparos (11.13 infra). Another, in very doubtful style, is said to come from Amorgos. The third male figurine, like the others, has well delineated genital organs, but is exceptional in wearing a little conical hat with incised horizontal lines round it (11.15). It is said to come from Amorgos, and there is no reason to doubt its authenticity.29 The fourth male figurine, with hands likewise meeting above the waist, again shows the facial features, navel and genital organs, although in style it approaches some of the FAFs.

The very interesting Plastiras type is apparently the earliest in the Cycladic Early Bronze Age to show such details as facial features, fingers and toes. Although the number known is not great, the female ones resemble each other so closely, and differ so markedly from the other Cycladic figu- rines that they undoubtedly embody a strict and well-defined convention. They are to be dated to- ward the end of the Grotta-Pelos culture. III. The Louros type (ill. 2, III; pl. 2, f) The featureless head with its rounded face, arm- stumps, and the divided and rounded legs are the defining features of this type. It was first reported by Bent from Antiparos (III.i and 2 infra). Seven were found in the Louros grave in Naxos (111.3 to 9), together with objects of the developed Grotta- Pelos culture, including a frying pan of Kampos type. A group of six rather flat figurines of Louros type, three of them made of shell, is said to have been found together in a grave in Paros (III.14 to 19) and were acquired by the Fitzwilliam Mu- seum, Cambridge, in 1933- III.I.

The figurines of Louros type are at present to be dated to the end of the Grotta-Pelos culture, on the grounds principally of the associations in the Lou- ros grave itself. But like the Plastiras figurine, the antecedents of the form may be earlier. With their smooth and rounded forms, they seem to herald the slightly more elaborate FAFs of the succeeding pe- riod.3 These, then, are the three basic figurine types of the Grotta-Pelos culture. Together they include all the forms which are known to have come from graves of that culture.32 Naturally many of the examples known have no archaeological prove- nance, but so far there is no instance known where one of these types occurs in a later context. The associations indicate that we have three con- temporary types or traditions in the Early Cycladic cemeteries, although the schematic forms may be- gin first. Cases have been quoted above where one type influences the other,33 but in general they re- main distinct, although both the Louros and Plas- S0 The Louros figurine: Papathanasopoulos pl. 70, e; Zervos fig. 41; see also a schematic figurine in the Ashmolean Mu- seum (1946.I20), Zervos fig. 37 (my pl. 0o, a).

This must be dated to the later Grotta- Pelos culture. But several arm-stump figurines are clearly later (e.g. Metallurgy pl. 4,28) and should not be confused with the thin and slender Louros type. 32 Mention should also be made of a curious spade-like shape of schematic figurine, known only from a couple of examples from grave 103 at Pyrgos in Paros, cf.

The origin of these types is discussed in a later section. It does not seem possible to attribute these types to any single island or group of islands. Nearly all varieties are found in Naxos, Paros and Antiparos. The schematic figurines of specifically Cycladic types extend their distribution from Kea and even Attica to Melos. The Plastiras and Louros figurines, although rarer, are found also in Amorgos and perhaps more widely. Nor can the marble itself, in the nature of its composition, be of any help. Petro- logical examination has clearly shown that fine- grained marble, like that from which the majority of figurines are made, can be found on virtually all the Cycladic islands (except Melos and Kimolos), as well as on the Greek mainland, in Crete and in West Anatolia.34 Neither a chronological nor a geographical explanation can account adequately for the existence of these types. Unfortunately the social or ritual explanation required will be difficult to provide in view of the paucity of associated or well excavated finds. The contemporaneity of these types, from the highly schematic pebbles and violin figurines to the much more anatomically detailed Plastiras types, should forever dispel the notion of a unilineal evo- lution from a schematic to a "developed" represen- tation, or of the converse, from "developed" to schematic. Already in the Neolithic period at Salia- gos, around 4000 B.c., schematic figurines and a much more elaborate Fat Lady were found in the same context. It therefore seems scarcely likely that psychological theories of change in actual visual perception can be called upon to explain major transformations in the conventions of Cycladic representation.35 FIGURINES OF THE KEROS-SYROS CULTURE With the Keros-Syros culture of the Cyclades, and its contemporaries, Early Helladic II, Early Minoan II and Troy II, life in the Aegean took on a new appearance. Metal tools, weapons and even vessels became widespread, and their influence is seen also on pottery and marble.36 The Bronze Age has now begun in earnest, cultural contacts in- crease, and the early stages of urbanization, which were soon to lead to the first Aegean civilization, are apparent. The Keros-Syros culture is best known from the important finds of Tsountas at Chalandriani in Syros. But the distribution is wide, extending south- ward beyond Naxos to Santorin. The settlement and cemetery of Dhaskalio in Keros, recently ex- cavated by Mr. C. Doumas, as well as important finds in the Apeiranthos Museum in Naxos, have given important new material to add to the earlier Naxian finds of Stephanos, and to those of Tsoun- tas. The range of ceramic, marble and metal forms is different now, and much wider. Jugs and pyxides (of different shape from those in the Grotta-Pelos culture) are common, sometimes with dark on light painted decoration."' The incised herringbone decoration has disappeared, and is replaced by stamped and incised decoration on "frying pans" and footed vessels.38 Only the open marble bowls continue, and are supplemented by little spouted bowls, cups and footed cups."9 There is a wide range of metal types. Various parallels, including finds of "sauceboats" and various metal types, indicate that the Keros- Syros culture is contemporary with the Early EH II of mainland Greece, with EM II and with later Troy I and Troy II. Consequently it may be dated between about 2500 and 2100 B.C.40 IV. The Folded-Arm Figurine (ill. 3, pls. 4-6, 8) The most important form among the Cycladic figurines, and the most numerous, is the FAF. It is known from hundreds of examples in museums throughout the world, although regrettably only a score have come from excavated, well stratified and published contexts. There are several varieties of the folded-arm type, which are discussed below. But all these share certain features in common. The head is tilted up- ward and backward on a short neck, with only the nose indicated among the facial features. Ears and 34 C. Renfrew and J.

The arms are folded at the waist, nearly always right below left. Above them the two breasts are lightly indicated. There is sometimes a horizontal line at the waist, and the pubic triangle is often indicated by inci- sion. The legs, always held together, are often slightly bent at the knees, and the feet (except in the Kapsala and Chalandriani varieties) are in- clined so that the figure, if it was indeed imagined as upright, was standing on tiptoe. There is a marked lack of detail: often only fingers and toes are indicated by incisions, and details such as ankles, kneecaps, navel, ribs or hair are not shown. The back is extremely simple, with only an incised line for the backbone, and sometimes incisions behind the arms. All the figurines, including the several pregnant ones, are notably slim. In general the figurines are very graceful.

However, the Apeiranthos Museum contains several FAFs, all of which may be pre- sumed to come from south-east Naxos or Keros. The Naxos Museum has a figurine excavated by Stephanos at Polichni (Stephanos p. 223), together with more than 25 FAFs and fragments, mostly of the Spedos variety, all of which can be presumed to have been found on Naxos. There are sev- eral unpublished figurines from Naxos in the Na- tional Museum in Athens. Four figurines in the Goulandris Collection (D-G 308, 309, 312, 328) are believed to have come from a single grave in the Spedos cemetery.

Kapros, Diimmler's grave D, although there is confusion concerning the figurines in this grave.

Diimmler, AM i i (1896) i5f; Metallurgy p. 6 and pl. 4,29. Of the numerous other figurines known or be- lieved to come from Amorgos, none is well associ- ated. However Wolters illustrated a folded-arm figurine with two Keros-Syros daggers and a clay cup (Wolters 49). Syros Tsountas excavated about 540 graves at Chalan- driani in Syros (Ts.1899 78-79), from which the finds belong exclusively to the Keros-Syros culture. Unfortunately he did not illustrate the four FAFs which he found there, but in the text he records their associations. Grave 307 (Ts.i899 III) contained two FAFs, an incised "frying pan," a bone tube, two footed cups and a marble bowl. The two figurines have not yet been identified in the National Museum in Athens. Grave 345 (Ts.I899 iii) contained a folded-arm figurine, a footed jar with stamped and incised decoration, another without decoration and two marble dishes. O19. Grave group 345 has been reconstructed by Mr. G. Papathanasopoulos from the finds of Tsoun- tas now in Athens, and is shown in the National Museum.

The figurine is illustrated by Zervos fig. 245- Excavations were conducted at Chalandriani by Stephanos and other archaeologists, and several of their finds are shown in the National Museum in Athens. Since none of the graves at Chalandriani contained material other than of the Keros-Syros culture (so far as is known), it is reasonable to take the occurrence of these FAFs at Chalandriani as evidence of association between the folded-arm type and the Keros-Syros culture. 421 (IV.C.I7).

Keros The recently discovered settlement at Dhaskalio in Keros, with the very rich cemetery opposite, rivals Chalandriani in importance. Literally dozens of FAF fragments have been found in the ex- cavations of Mr. C. Doumas (ArchDelt 19 [1964] 409) and, in 1967, of Mrs. P. Zapheiropoulou, Ephor of Antiquities for the Cyclades. I myself collected four fragments from the surface in 1963 (now in the Naxos Museum). All the other finds, ceramic and lithic, are of Keros-Syros type. Thus, although the cemetery deposit is disturbed and without se- cure associations, all the evidence indicates a Keros- Syros context for the figurines. In 1967 a complete figurine was found. 035 (IV.F.30). Complete figurine of the Spedos variety, ht. 58 cm. F. Zapheiropoulou, Athens An- nals of Archaeology I (1968) 97, fig. I. Other Islands There are no good associations of figurines from other islands, but FAFs are known from Ios (Brit- ish School at Athens L 253 and L 254; cf. also Blinkenberg 57), Dhespotikon (Paros Museum, un- published), the Ano Kouphonisi and Schinousa (D-G 10o2). Probably such figurines have been found in all the Cycladic islands, but unfortunately the dealers' attributions and museum catalogues are not a reliable indication of place of origin. From this documentation, it may be seen that in only one case (b4 above) has a folded-arm figurine been found associated with finds of the Grotta-Pelos culture, and in this instance there are other grounds for thinking that the burial in fact belongs to the Keros-Syros culture. In no case has a folded-arm figurine been found securely associated with, and dated by, finds later than the Keros-Syros culture. However the Phyla- kopi and A. Irini finds leave open the possibility, discussed infra, that the FAF survived into the Middle Bronze Age. In twelve cases, FAFs have been found securely associated with Keros-Syros material in the same grave, and there are at least eight examples in addi- tion from Chalandriani and probably more than twenty from Dhaskalio where the Keros-Syros as- sociation cannot be doubted. The Cretan and mainland contexts are in con- formity with these findings. The bulk of finds are EM II or III and EH II or III. None is earlier, Probably few if any are later. The chronological position of the FAF may thus now be regarded as established. It made its ap- pearance about 2500 B.c., and declined after the Amorgos Group of the Keros-Syros culture, around 1900 B.C. V. Figurines related to the Folded-Arm Figurine It is appropriate here to refer to the seated figu- rines and the other elaborations of the simple stand- ing or reclining FAF form. Only one is from an entirely sure context: the fragment of a seated musician, playing a harp or kithara, from Aphen- dika in Naxos.3 Regrettably there are no associa- tions.44 However, because of their close similarity to the FAFs, there can be no doubt that the figu- rines of this class belong to the same culture and period. In particular the tilt of the head and the rendering of the nose is in every case very close to that of the FAFs, and unlike that of any other type. The famous harper and flautist in the National Museum in Athens are said to be from Keros, and it is indeed likely that they derive from the ceme- tery at Dhaskalio itself, which has yielded a great variety of figurines. Little bases, like that for the flautist, have been found there, and in this case at least there can be no doubt of the Keros-Syros as- sociation. The two seated harpers, possibly from Thera, 43Papathanasopoulos 148 and pls. 79-80. 44 Koehler however records that the harper and flautist from Keros were found in the same grave together with two FAFs (U.

But the charming seated figurine in the N. P. Goulandris Collection, offering up a cup, is entirely satisfac- tory.47 Unfortunately grave doubts must be ex- pressed about the seated harper in the Metropoli- tan Museum of Art, New York, and on the very curious figurine from Tegea in Arcadia, whose whereabouts is not now known."8 The seated figu- rine from Teke in Crete is the only example of this series, found outside the Cyclades, whose provenance is known'" (pl. 9, a). Double figurines are also known. There is a frag- mentary example from Amorgos, now in the Brit- ish Museum50 (pl. 9, d), where two figures stood side-by-side, as is shown by the arm across the back of the torso preserved, and a similar fragment from Dhaskalio in Keros. From Teke in Crete comes the little pair of figurines standing on the same base, made of steatite51 (pl. 9, b). There are also figurines which support another on the head. A damaged example in Copenhagen is said to come from los5" (pl. 9, c), while a splendid and complete example in Karlsruhe"5 may possibly come from Paros. VI a. Schematic Figurines of the Apeiranthos Type (ill. I, VI; pl. 7, a-b) An important result of the study of the contexts of the Early Cycladic figurines is the division of the schematic figurines into those of the Grotta- Pelos and those of the Keros-Syros cultures. The most numerous series of schematic figurines from the Keros-Syros culture is from the site of Chalandriani itself. Others have been found in Keros, at Spedos in Naxos, and at various sites in southeast Naxos on land associated with the vil- lage of Apeiranthos. Their essential feature, distinguishing them from those of the Grotta-Pelos culture, is that they all have some indication of the head. Even when in outline the head is little more than a prong, both in section and in profile, it is asymmetrical in the same sort of way as the heads of the Louros figurines. Sometimes the facial features are actually shown. In addition, the waist is generally entirely absent. Usually these are not completely and uniformly flat: they are not Brettidolen. Tsountas found three examples of this type at Chalandriani in Syros, and the National Museum in Athens has altogether eight from that site. All must belong to the Keros-Syros culture. VI.i.

For an understanding of the development of the Cycladic figurines it is essential to distinguish these schematic figurines of the Keros-Syros culture from those of the Grotta-Pelos culture, although the forms are rather similar in some cases. Once again schematic figurines and more elaborately fea- tured representations are contemporary. 45 Koehler op.cit.; Zervos figs. 316-317. 46 Cahn nos. 28, 140; Thimme (op.cit. n. 4 supra) pl. 22,1; K.

Before considering the figurines of the Phylakopi I culture, and the origin of the Cycladic figurines, it will be convenient to discuss in greater detail the several distinct varieties into which the FAFs may be divided. VARIETIES OF THE FOLDED-ARM FIGURINE In the last section, the chronological position of the FAFs was set in the Keros-Syros culture, al- though a few examples may have been produced right on into Middle Bronze Age times. The figu- rines were thus being produced over a period of something like 500 years. In many ways it is surprising that the conven- tions of position and of treatment should have re- mained so constant over so long a period of time. There is scarcely ever any taxonomic difficulty in deciding whether or not a figurine is of the folded- arm type: a dozen features will indicate that it is. But within this single type, which is a coherent and discrete category, several distinct varieties may be distinguished. Given the rigour of the convention evidently governing the type as a whole, the range of varia- tion within this type is very striking. Even more surprising, perhaps, is the discovery that this varia- tion is itself governed by convention. Six varieties may be defined, of which five account for most of the striking variations observed. The sixth category, the Spedos variety, is at present something of a residual category, not as well defined as the others, within which the figurines are broadly similar. A formal statistical analysis might well yield use- ful results with this material, but these results might not differ greatly from the system of varieties here put forward.54 Mrs. Patricia Preziosi has in- dependently reached some analogous conclusions, for she writes of a "squat type" and an "elongated type" which perhaps correspond approximately to the Chalandriani and Dokathismata varieties de- fined here." It is not claimed that these varieties are as clear-cut as the major types already defined in this paper, but they do bring out some real divi- sions in the material which should be culturally meaningful. The varieties have been distinguished by morpho- logical features rather than by measurement, al- though the breadth of the Dokathismata figurines, for instance, or the small size of the Koumasa ones, have been taken into account. Within a single variety the proportions can vary very considerably. For example, in the Spedos variety, the legs can be very long, and the mid-point of the figurine is be- low the base of the abdomen.5 Or the legs can be relatively short so that the mid-point is at the right arm as it folds across the waist.57 For convenience each variety is designated by one of the findspots of a typical example. In every case the general features of the FAF, described at the beginning of the last section (folded-arm posi- tion, tilted head, etc.) are assumed. Only those traits which serve to distinguish the varieties are cited below. IV.A. The Kapsala Variety (ill. 2, IV.A; pl. 3, d-e) This is a figurine which is fairly narrow across the shoulders and arms. All parts of the body show good round modeling, so that in profile it is not so thin or flat as varieties B to E, nor yet so stocky as variety F sometimes is. The head is convex viewed from the front (the cheeks being somewhat rounded), and distinctly plump in profile. Often it is not flat at the crown, and it is usually well distinguished from the neck. The breasts are rather clearly shaped, often squar- ish, and are close to the arms. The torso is well rounded, and the shoulders are not angular, and only a little wider than the hips. The thighs do not bulge. The buttocks are sometimes rounded, in re- lief. The knees are pronouncedly flexed. The legs are often separated a little below the knee, and rounded. There is often some slight indication of the knees themselves. The feet are neat, lightly arched, often very flat on the ground, unlike the tiptoe position of the other figurines. There are generally few incisions on the body, and conse- quently little emphasis on the pubic area, since the overall effect is not a linear one, but is achieved by sculpting in the round. 5 Naturally when there are few clear breaks between clus- ters, marginal cases occur and different taxonomic criteria produce different groupings. It is not possible to say that one grouping is "better" than another, if both are internally consistent, except by reference to criteria which have to be agreed upon. 55 Preziosi 105, n. 5. Zervos figs. 244 or 247 do not how- ever fall within the Dokathismata variety, as defined here. 56 E.g. D-G 282. Ht. 74.5 cm., line at base of abdomen, 38.3 cm. from toes. 57 E.g. D-G 304.

The distribution of the Kapsala variety appears to be chiefly in the central Cyclades, from Anti- paros eastward to Naxos and Amorgos. The possi- bility that it may be an early version of the FAF is discussed below. IV.B. The Dokathismata Variety (ill. 3, IVB; pl. 5, a-d) The most long, thin, angular and elegant figu- rines are of the Dokathismata variety. All are thin, with rather sinuous lines, broad and often very an- gular at the shoulders. The surface of the figurine is flat, so that details, especially at the pubic tri- angle, are shown by incision. The head is sometimes triangular, with cheeks straight, although the chin is usually rounded, not pointed. The head sometimes has a slightly S- shaped edge in profile. The crown of the head is indicated by a smooth vertical plane, as in the Spe- dos variety. The head and neck are not clearly dis- tinguished at the back. The shoulders are wide and pointed, the breasts very flat. The arms across the waist sometimes show a gentle upward curve at the middle, and sometimes the belly bulges a little in profile. The upper arm is distinguished from the torso by an incision, which sometimes cuts right through to separate the arm. But there is no rounding or modeling. The waist is not usually narrower than the torso and the thighs, and the buttocks are indicated by a ridge at the rear, which appears in profile as a minuscule protrusion. The waistline is often not delineated by an incision, but the pubic triangle usually is. The leg above and below the knee is indicated by a continuous single line, so that the knees are not shown by any relief. The legs are not flexed. The feet are on tiptoe, with flat, widen- ing soles. Extremely typical of this variety are the two figurines from grave 14 at Dokathismata (IV.B.I and 2 in the list infra) which are very much alike. Another good example is a large figurine from Syros (IV.B.3). A very large figurine of unknown provenance in the National Museum in Athens is similar (IV.B.4), although the legs narrow at the knees. There is a particularly beautiful example in the Goulandris Collection (IV.B.5). Being very much more slender than the Spedos variety, this form is often found headless and without feet. Judging by its beautiful and sinuous profile, the large head in the Louvre may be from a figurine of this type (IV.B.I4). Ears seem to be a feature com- monest, for some reason, in very large heads." In recognizing this variety it is particularly neces- sary to see the profile view. The following list is by no means complete, and does not include any examples from Keros. IV.B.I (016 supra).

The distribution of the Dokathismata variety is wide, from Syros and perhaps Kea in the north, southward through Amorgos and Keros, to Melos (Plaka Museum, unpublished). No examples have been published from Paros-Antiparos or Naxos. Significantly, there is none in the Naxos Museum, but there may be unrecognized fragments in the Apeiranthos Museum. IV.C. The Chalandriani Variety (ill. 2, IV.C; pl. 5, e; pl. 8, b-d) In this variety the thorax is almost exactly square. The arms are strictly horizontal at the waist, the upper arms are vertical, and the shoulders form a right angle, and then run horizontally to the neck. The legs are often very short, giving a square ef- fect also. The neck is long and cylindrical, and the head is simply a flat inclined triangle, set rather absurdly on the neck as if on a stalk. The nose is often a rough blob, rather than the neatly chiseled feature of varieties A, B and E. The chest is very flat, with low breasts. Usually there is no waist, since the pubic triangle is incised immediately below the arms. Seen from the front, the legs run straight from the arms to the feet, al- though there can be a slight prominence at the knees to offset that of the buttocks behind. The legs are broad and short, and the pubic tri- angle extends almost to the knees. The feet slope only slightly, or may be flat on the ground, while the toes are heavily indicated by incision. From the front, the toes are notably broader than the ankles. Of this form, three notable examples are from Chalandriani in Syros (IV.B.I-3 infra). There are two fine ones in the Goulandris Collection (IV.C.4 and 5), and one in the National Museum in Athens, said to be from Ios, is very typical of this form (IV.C.6). A special feature of these figurines is the some- times anomalous arrangement of the arms. Exam- ple IV.C.2 below has the left arm set below the right, and this feature is seen again in one of the examples from the Goulandris Collection, and one in the British Museum. Indeed this left-below-right arm position is apparently restricted to figurines of the Chalandriani variety. Of very great interest also are the few similar figurines where the left arm is raised, sometimes to run along a diagonal shoulder strap which runs from the right shoulder to the waist at the left. There is a good example in the British Museum without the shoulder strap (pl. 8, c) and another in the Paros Museum. The male figurine from Syros in the National Museum, which has a penis sheath, is in this posi- tion. Although it does not have the square shoul- ders and short legs of the Chalandriani variety, the broad feet with pronounced toes are typical, and it is at least related to the Chalandriani variety figurines. There is a splendid male figurine of the Chalandriani variety in the Goulandris Collection, again with the shoulder strap or baldric (IV.C.I4), and with pronounced facial features. There is a very similar figurine in the Dresden Museum, said to come from Amorgos. It has the shoulder strap, raised left arm, pronounced facial features on a very rounded head, and there is a dagger in the right hand. It has many features of the Chalandri- ani variety, and in many respects resembles the Goulandris male warrior (pl. 8, d). IV.C.I (026 above). Chalandriani. Zervos fig. 249- IV.C.2 (027).

The Chalandriani variety thus includes within its scope some of the most noted variants of the FAF type: the male figurines, those with a shoulder strap, and most if not all of those where the left arm is held below the right across the abdomen. This in itself seems a valuable corroboration of the reality of the grouping. Although it is difficult to date these variants, I have the feeling that those with facial features clearly indicated, notably the incised mouth and eyes, are late in the series. This point is considered again in the next section. Before leaving the Chalandriani variety, an im- portant figurine from A. Irini must be mentioned.5" Unfortunately very damaged, it appears to end at the waist, and thus approximates in shape to the schematic Apeiranthos type (Type VI a). However it has breasts in low relief, the incised arm at the waist, and the left arm upraised, like those de- scribed supra. It shares with some of them (e.g. IV.C.I2 supra) the curious trait of carelessly incised outstretched fingers, which is seen in some of the other Chalandriani varieties. The interesting point is the overlapping of features of the Apeiranthos schematic type (Type VI) and the Chalandriani variety of the FAF (Type IV.C), which serves to confirm their contemporaneity. IV.D. The Kea Variety (ill. 3, IV.D; pl. 8, e-f) Although features of this variety relate it to both the Dokathismata and Chalandriani forms, a single arresting feature sets it apart from the others. This is the presence of horizontal rolls of flesh at the waist, extending to the pubic triangle. There may be three, four or five parallel rolls. It is possible that these indicate the condition of a mother im- mediately after giving birth.60 In the one known example with preserved head (IV.D.2; ill. 3, IV.D) the head is a flat triangle, like those of the Chalandriani variety. The shoul- ders slope, however, and the thorax is not rectangu- lar. The legs are straight and rather long, especially in this instance, like the Dokathismata variety. In the British Museum specimen the feet widen and slope like the Dokathismata form, but in the Gou- landris example they are flatter. The only complete Kea figurine is in the Gou- landris Collection, while the only example from a sure findspot is that from Professor Caskey's ex- cavations in Kea. It should be noted that some schematic figurines indicate the same condition"6 (cf. pl. 10, a, also pl. Io, f, of A. 0. type), and there is a class of hybrid figurines discussed infra (Drios A variety) where rolls of flesh are seen at the waist, just as in the case of the curious figurine cited in the first section supra.

Koumasa Variety (ill. 2, IV.E; pl. 6; pl. 9, b) The distribution of this form is of particular in- terest, since it is restricted exclusively to Crete. Evidently there are factors at work here which have not hitherto been suspected, and the recogni- tion of a variety peculiar to Crete reopens the ques- 59 Kea K 4.250. 60o Mrs. Preziosi has suggested to me that these figurines of the Kea variety may be regarded simply as variants of the Dokathismata variety. The overall impression is, however, a different one. 1x BMC pl. i A7.</page><page sequence="19">1969] EARLY CYCLADIC FIGURINES 19 tion as to whether the FAFs were manufactured exclusively in the Cycladic Islands. These figurines are generally very small (the heights are given in the list infra). They are broad in the shoulder and short in the leg, with sloping shoulders. In profile they are thin and exceedingly flat, with a slight forward inclination for the torso, and a backward one for the top of the head. Among FAFs they are exceptional in that the head is usu- ally not separated from the neck, except by a light incision. As in the Chalandriani and Dokathismata varie- ties, the legs run straight without any indication of the knees and without flexing. The arms, legs and pubic triangle are indicated by incisions rather than through modeling. These figurines are distin- guished from both varieties, however, by the way the head merges with the neck, and by the smaller size. They differ also from the Chalandriani figurines in the sloping shoulders, the tiptoe feet and the head itself, which curves back, and is not so markedly triangular. They differ from the Doka- thismata variety also by the much greater width/ length ratio, the absence of a chin and the exceed- ingly flat profile. A number of these figurines have been broken at the neck, and repaired by boring a hole above and below the break. This is perhaps a notably Cretan custom, rather than one restricted to the Koumasa variety, for it is seen in three pieces which are not strictly of Koumasa type.62 The known figurines of the Koumasa variety, all from Crete, are as follows: IV.E.I.

Figurines of length less than io cm. are in general elsewhere extremely rare.6' All the Koumasa figurines are from Crete, and only twelve more FAFs or frag- ments of other varieties are known from the is- land.65 The question naturally arises as to whether they were made in Crete. A good source of marble is now known, at Xeropotamos near A. Nikolaos,66 and there is now no reason to suppose that marble was specially imported as some writers have argued. Of course the folded-arm form is essentially a Cycladic one, and must surely be of Cycladic origin. But it seems likely that the Cretans began to imitate the Cycladic type in the EM II period, just as they may have imitated Egyptian types 62Head and body from A.

Probably the curious schematic figurines of Aghios Onouphrios type"9 (pl. Io, d-f) were influ- ential in the formation of the broad, short, rather dumpy form of the Koumasa variety. IV.F. The Spedos Variety (ill. 3, IV.F; pl. 4) This is the commonest variety of the FAF, and probably some further subdivision of the very numerous examples would be possible. Finds are especially frequent in Naxos. The figurines appear thick and well built in profile, and there is much sculpting in the round. The head, seen in profile, is fairly thick, with a vertical surface at the crown. Seen from the front it is sometimes lyre-shaped, broadening markedly at the crown. The face is a convex surface, and the chin is rounded. There is considerable variation in the body, which may be rather straight, although more often flexed at the knees. The waist is usually clearly modeled, being narrower than the thighs, and ter- minates with an incised line at the lower edge. It certainly does not disappear, as it does in the Cha- landriani variety. The shoulders are of varying width, although not as wide as in the Chalandriani and Dokathismata varieties, and are sometimes rounded. The upper leg (knee to pelvis) is modeled separately from the calf (ankle to knee), so that the knees are shown by modeling rather than by incision. The arms too are generally modeled rather than simply incised or cut. Incisions are not numerous, and often the pubic triangle is not marked at all.

Within the group there are considerable variations, and one can perhaps distinguish: a) figurines with lyre- shaped heads, generally with bulging thighs and calves, e.g. D-G 282, Zervos fig. 246, BMC pl. 11 A 24. b) figurines with heads which narrow at the top, and which are almost the same width from shoulders to feet, e.g. Blinkenberg p. 8, fig. I (pl. 4, b), BMC p. 9, fig- 7 A 18, Zervos figs. 297, 300. But there are many intermediate forms, and fur- ther classification, which may well be possible, will require further study. It should be noted also that several figurines show features of both the Doka- 67 . D. Pendlebury, Archaeology of Crete (1939) 74. s8 Cf. Xanthoudides pl. xxI,I22 (Spedos variety). 69 E.g.

Although the Spedos variety is most abundant in Naxos, it is found widely throughout the Cycla- des, and occurs in Crete and mainland Greece. Apparently it cannot be ascribed to a single area. Geographical and Chronological Position of the Varieties of the Folded-Arm Figurine The division of the FAFs into six distinct varie- ties opens up entirely new possibilities in the un- derstanding of the stylistic development of the figurines. The geographical and chronological dis- tribution of these varieties does, in fact, give some further insight into the way the conventions which governed their production may have worked. In the first instance, there is no clear-cut regional division among the varieties, such as to allow one unequivocally to assign a place of manufacture to them. Only the Koumasa variety has a well defined locus: I know of no examples found outside Crete. In the attempt to assign varieties and specific figurines to their place of origin, it was at first hoped that a study of the marble from which they are made would provide valuable evidence. If by examination one could distinguish Parian, Naxi- an and the other island marbles, the task would be made very much easier. Unfortunately the re- sults of a detailed petrological investigation into the problem of island marbles are entirely nega- tive.71 Neither by inspection nor by microscopic study can the marbles of various sources and quarries be distinguished. A marble source has been identified on Crete, as reported supra, and indeed the only important Cycladic island totally without marble appears to be Melos. The study of the marble composing these figurines-and most of it is fairly fine-grained-appears to hold little prom- ise of result. The most widely distributed FAFs are those of the Spedos variety. They are also the most numer- ous, and the range of form is the greatest. In addi- tion to examples from the north and south Cycla- des, there are several in Crete, including a com- plete figurine from Koumasa (IV.F.28). Most of the mainland Greek examples are of this form, al- though one purchased in Elis is of the Dokathis- mata variety (IV.B.I6). The distribution of the Dokathismata, Kapsala and Chalandriani varieties within the Cyclades is widespread. All are found on Naxos. The Doka- thismata and Chalandriani forms, although per- haps not the Kapsala one, are found on Syros. And the Chalandriani-form figurine from los pre- vents our seeing this as a northern variety. The morphological variation, then, does not cor- relate with the geographical distribution, with the notable exception of the Koumasa variety of Crete. One is therefore tempted to seek a chronological explanation for the varieties of style, seeing the figurines as a product of a typological evolution, rather than of coexisting traditions restricted to specific islands. There are, indeed, insufficient good associations to establish a clear chronological picture, beyond the fact that the FAFs belong within the span of the Keros-Syros culture, although a few may be later. The finding of a figurine of Kapsala form among Bent's graves on Antiparos (IV.A.5) may perhaps hint at an early date within the Keros- Syros culture for it, although the Kapsala example itself (IV.A.I) unfortunately had little associated material. The flat feet and rounded head of this variety seem to place it closest, of all the FAFs, to the Plastiras type of the Grotta-Pelos culture. The Spedos variety can be placed with accuracy chronologically. Found with Keros-Syros painted pottery and a sauceboat in the rich Spedos grave io, it was clearly in existence during the floruit of the culture. Its later duration is unknown. The Dokathismata variety could well be a de- velopment during an advanced phase of the Keros- Syros culture. Certainly the silver diadem and two daggers from grave 14 at Dokathismata suggest a date towards the end of the third millennium. There is no way of establishing that it did not de- velop earlier, but the profile and flat kneeless legs (which it shares with the Chalandriani and Kou- masa forms) seem to support the idea of a late development. The Koumasa variety has been found in a pure EM II context only at Lebena (IV.E.12 and i3), and perhaps the Pyrgos example (IV.E.7) is as early. Some of these could be of EM III or even MM I date, however, for the tombs at Koumasa and Platanos, as well as Lebena tomb Ib continued in use into the Middle Bronze Age. 70 Cf. Zervos fig. 252. The chest and arms are of Dokathis- mata form, but the legs resemble the Spedos form. 71 Cf. nn. 34 and 66 supra.</page><page sequence="22">22 COLIN RENFREW [AJA 73 Figurines of the Chalandriani variety have as- sociations only at the eponymous cemetery. There is nothing in them to indicate whether they be- long to an early or a late phase of the Keros-Syros culture. The chronological placing of the Chalandriani and Kea figurines has to be attempted, if at all, chiefly on typological grounds. It is perhaps rele- vant, however, that at A. Irini in Kea, where some of the figurines could be late in date, the Chalan- driani variety is particularly well represented, and the Kea variety occurs. At present it appears possible that the Kapsala and Spedos varieties developed first, with the more austere and stylish Dokathismata variety a little later. All the largest and most impressive figurines are of these varieties (especially of Spedos and Dokathismata form), and certainly the musicians belong with them. The Koumasa, Chalandriani and Kea varieties have more in common, in the treatment of the neck and head, the lack of three- dimensional carving, the sketchy treatment of the legs, without sculptured indication of the knees, and in the sometimes inferior workmanship. Per- haps these developed towards the end of the dura- tion of the Keros-Syros culture (and hence late in EM II). With their thin and flat profile, they could certainly emerge more plausibly from the Dokathismata form than from the Kapsala or Spedos one. The hypothetical evolution would then be as follows. Kapsala I i Spedos Dokathismata II I Koumasa Chalandriani Kea It must be emphasized that, while the position of these figurines within the Keros-Syros culture is secure, the schema above is largely hypothetical, based on formal and not associational features. We should remember, too, when attempting to base an evolutionary sequence upon typological and stylistic features, that our idea of "good style" is not necessarily that of the makers of these figurines, a point documented by the painted examples men- tioned below. Mrs. Patricia Preziosi has hinted72 at an explanation of the variations found in terms of the styles of individual artists, and this interest- ing suggestion must be very carefully considered. The existence of regional schools cannot be ex- cluded-indeed in Crete such a "school" or tradi- tion certainly existed. But the widespread distribu- tion of the different varieties may nonetheless in- dicate a chronological rather than a geographical explanation. Prehistoric Copies of the Folded-Arm Figurine There can be no doubt that the FAF was copied in prehistoric times, by craftsmen unfamiliar with the usual and strict conventions of the Cycladic sculptors. These copies are sometimes overlooked by scholars, possibly because they are confused with the numerous, and not always crude, modern copies made with intent to deceive. Often these closely resemble the ancient ones, since both differ from the original FAFs, of Cycladic manufacture, for similar reasons. The Koumasa variety figurines themselves, be- ing made in Crete, could in a sense be regarded as copies of the FAF type. But they constitute so homogeneous a group, of good workmanship and conforming to most of the precepts of the FAF canon, that they are best regarded as a re- gional variety of the type. The contemporary copies, on the other hand, are usually crude in style, of much cruder workman- ship than the originals. Sometimes they are un- polished, while in nearly every true FAF known, the marble has been carefully smoothed and pol- ished.7" Two such copies were found in association with three good FAFs of Koumasa type (IV.E.8-io) at Teke in Crete, where the finds, to judge by the daggers, are of MM I date74 (pl. io, g-h). The first has a head with a blob nose, and the mouth in re- lief. The legs are separated and rounded, and the figurine can certainly not be classed with the Kou- masa variety. On the other hand the mouth is in fact similar to the mouth in relief on the largest of the Koumasa variety figurines75 (IV.E.I).

The second Teke figurine, like the first, has the arms folded left below right. This is itself a curi- osity, since the other FAFs, including the Koumasa variety, have the arms folded right below left. Only some of the Chalandriani variety, which are proba- bly late in date, break this rule. The legs are again rounded and separated in a way never seen in true FAFs. The third copy has been listed above, with the other figurines from associated finds ()18). It is from Amorgos.7" The parts of the body are not very clearly shown. The style lacks precision, and the form is not of any of the six varieties listed supra. Two more instances are in the British Museum.77 The second is particularly interesting, and again the left arm is below the right. There are raised squares at the front (pl. Io, b), which caused Pryce very plausibly to suggest that the figurine is un- finished. There is another apparently unfinished figurine in the Goulandris Collection.7" A figurine in the Ashmolean Museum in Ox- ford,7" with separated rounded legs, is of very curious style. It too is an imitation of the folded- arm convention, but whether or not it is an ancient one is uncertain. Several figurines outside of Greece have been claimed as copies of the FAF. Those of the Vinca and Gumelnitsa cultures are considerably earlier in date and cannot imitate the FAF. Indeed the possibility of influence in the reverse direction is considered in the last section infra. The Sardinian marble figurines"8 have also been claimed as imita- tions of the FAF, but the similarity is not a very close one, and it is doubtful whether there is indeed any connection between them and the Aegean figurines. Painted Decoration on the Folded-Arm Figurines Before leaving the FAF type, it is useful to em- phasize that the original appearance of the figurines was probably very different, in many cases, from what it is today. Many, if not all of them, were painted on the face, and some at any rate, on the body also. The red paint seen on the faces of some Plastiras figurines (e.g. III.3 and 4) has been mentioned above. Red colouring matter, probably red ochre, is found in many of the marble bowls in the Cycladic graves, and sometimes little lumps of the material are also found. Traces of red paint are seen on the faces of sev- eral FAFs. The best preserved example is in the National Museum in Copenhagen" (pl. 8, a). There are vertical lines on the cheeks, well-defined eyes, and higher up, curves and lines which may represent eyebrows or a diadem. In the Goulandris Collection there is a figurine with lines of paint on part of the body also.82 In some of the graves blue pigment has also been found, sometimes contained in little pots. Analysis by Mr. J. A. Charles has shown this to be the cop- per ore azurite.83 Probably this was used for colour- ing the eyes; a large head in the Athens Museum has the eyes outlined in dark pigment,"4 and there are traces of vertical lines on the cheeks. Together with these examples must be classed a few where the facial features, especially the eyes, are very lightly incised. These are not at all the same as those few, generally crude, figurines where the facial features are in relief or indicated by heavy incision.85 The fine incisions in question were probably intended to take pigment. There is a good example in the British Museum,"8 and an- other in Oxford. The fine relief lines on a figurine in the Goulandris Collection are in similar style."7 Some figurines also show markings at the top of the elongated forehead, and it is possible that a headdress or diadem of some sort is intended in the representation. We should perhaps imagine some of the figurines actually wearing an applied diadem of silver, just as the figurine from Hasa- 76 Metallurgy pl. 4,29. 77 BMC p. 12 figs. io and ii, A 32 and 33. 78 D-G 209, cf.

The custom of painting the figurines is obvious- ly related to a habit of decorating the human body and face. This may have been especially a funerary custom, and the custom of using red-ochre in buri- al, perhaps for its bloodlike colour, is seen widely and probably independently at various times and places. But it may equally well relate to a habitual cosmetic practice." In any case, the FAFs, like many archaic Greek sculptures,"9 must not be imagined in the white purity of the marble, but often brightly decorated with paint. FIGURINES OF THE PHYLAKOPI I CULTURE AND OTHER FIGURINES The Phylakopi I culture succeeded the Keros- Syros culture in the southern Cyclades. Finds are especially rich in the First City at the type site of Phylakopi in Melos, and in Paros. The Second City, which immediately succeeds the first, received imports of Middle Minoan Ia pottery from Crete, so that the Phylakopi I culture can be regarded as essentially an Early Bronze Age one. Probably it is in part contemporary with the later Keros-Syros culture in some of the more northerly islands, and especially with the Amorgos Group of the culture. The principal ceramic forms diagnostic of the culture are the "duck vase," the conical pyxis, the kernos, the inturned-rim bowl, and a particular form of jug.91 A new type of figurine is seen at Phylakopi at this time. VII. Schematic figurines of the Phylakopi I type (ill. I, VII; pl. 7, c-g) This small group of figurines has a form which resembles in several ways the schematic figurines of class I.C described supra. Here, however, the figurine is thicker, the body almost triangular in shape, and the shoulder stumps more clearly dif- ferentiated from the body. VII.I. Phylakopi, First City deposit (see infra).

Although these figurines are not dramatically different from the schematic figurines of type I.C or VI, the distinction is an important one, since the cultural context is systematically different. These figurines have not been found in contexts earlier than the Phylakopi I culture, and it is prob- able that the form is not earlier than this period. The late contexts of the two Kea ones in particular do not necessarily imply that the figurines are of Late Bronze Age manufacture, and this point is discussed infra. These two have a very flat edge, and were probably carved with a metal tool. On one of them the breasts are indicated by hollows, rather than in relief (pl. 7, g). THE DURATION OF THE CYCLADIC FIGURINES The date of origin for the various forms of the Cycladic figurines can now be fixed rather well. Certain forms originated in the Grotta-Pelos cul- ture, and probably died with it, although some curi- ous hybrid forms may be later. The FAF originated and developed with the Keros-Syros culture, but we cannot be certain that its production terminated with the end of the culture, and there are some indications that it did not. The Cycladic custom of cist burial certainly survived beyond the Early Bronze 2 period. In Amorgos there are cist graves containing duck-vases of the Phylakopi I culture,92 and at A. Loukas in Syros a cist grave was found with Minyan ware and a Middle Bronze Age jug." Minyan ware has also been found, probably in cist graves, in Siphnos. More remarkably, there are eight cups of Middle Minoan I to Late Minoan Ia form from a cist grave at the cemetery of Aila in Naxos.14 It seems that cist burial continued in an un- 88 E.

For possible indications of later figurines we are forced to turn to the two important excavations of Middle and Late Cycladic settlements: Phylakopi in Melos and A. Irini in Kea. At A. Irini, no complete Cycladic marble figurine has been found (to the end of the 1967 season). The two damaged figurines of type VII listed supra were from Late Bronze Age deposits. Twelve FAF fragments have been found, all in Middle or Late Bronze Age deposits. However there is a certain amount of undoubtedly Early Bronze Age ma- terial in most of these deposits, and Professor Cas- key cautions against assuming a late date for these fragmentary finds. He points out that large areas of the Middle and especially the Late Bronze Age town have been excavated, and the absence of figu- rines in the limited area of Early Bronze Age set- tlement that has been uncovered is probably not significant. Certainly it seems unlikely that all of the Kea figurines were actually manufactured or used in Middle or Late Bronze Age times. There is indeed one typical Grotta-Pelos figurine of Type I.A, actually from a Late Bronze Age deposit. It is likely that many of these figurines were found in or near the site by the Middle or Late Bronze Age successors of the Early Bronze Age in- habitants who made them. They may have picked them up as curiosities, or "worry stones" to use Mr. W. Kittridge's term. The attraction of smooth stones and beads is not diminished today, and is, of course documented by the present fondness in Greece for komboloia, which, without any religious significance, are simply "worry beads.""9 At Phylakopi the situation is a similar one. Since the original excavations were not published in great detail, the Phylakopi figurines are listed again here with comments, where available, from Dun- can Mackenzie's unpublished Daybooks of the excavations."9 Phyl.

Clearly many of these frag- ments must have been reburied, through whatever agency, far from their original contexts. It would still be possible, I think, to argue that no Cycladic marble figurines whatever are later than the Early Bronze Age. But Professor Konto- leon17 has suggested that the Cycladic marble figu- rines may have persisted well into the Mycenaean period, continuing so late as to influence archaic Greek sculpture in the islands. This possibility cannot be excluded. But the great clay figures of Kea,98 which are in the main- stream of Minoan-Mycenaean sculpture in clay and bronze, suggest that a different style was fa- voured in the Late Bronze Age. Certainly the rather schematic Mycenaean figurines in clay have little in common with the Early Cycladic marble figurines. At present it seems safest to conclude that, while Early Cycladic marble carving traditions probably continued into the Middle Bronze Age, there is no good evidence to support their later survival. "HYBRID" FIGURINES Several figurines exist which seem to cut across the classification here proposed. Almost none have associations, so that their dating must be on the basis of typology alone. For this reason they are grouped here as "hybrids," although the phenetic similarity does not necessarily imply a cladistic re- lationship. Already mentioned in the first section is what may be termed a Louros/Plastiras hybrid, with fea- tures of both types,99 and a violin figurine with a head of Louros type.100 There is a violin figurine with a head surmounted by the sort of hat seen on both the Louros and Plastiras types"0' (pl. Io, a). And a schematic figurine in the British Museum has arms and the pubic triangle clearly indicated.'x" Within the FAF class there are of course hybrids between the different varieties,103 but hybrids be- tween the folded-arm type and other types are rare. One such is an interesting figurine from Naxos, with a general Louros type outline, a face like the FAFs, and knees of Plastiras type.Y0' Another is a clear Apeiranthos-schematic/FAF hybrid, with an entirely schematic body, and a head of Chalan- driani type."05 These are all simply curiosities, and others exist which, like them, combine features of various types.x06 But of more general interest, because more numerous, are two varieties, both known from the cemetery of Drios in southeast Paros. Drios variety A (pl. 7, h). Fairly large, solid figu- rines of violin outline, but supporting a head, some- times with facial features. The breasts are indicated, and the pubic triangle, and sometimes hands which meet at the waist (as in the Plastiras figurines). Sometimes there are folds of skin at the waist. Drios A.I.

Finally, to conclude this survey of marble anthro- pomorphic representations of the Cycladic Early Bronze Age, a remarkable beaker or rhyton must be mentioned. Now in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford (pl. 9, e), and made of marble, it has indicated upon it, in low relief, legs, breasts and crossed arms. The vessel itself is of the usual Grot- ta-Pelos shape,'07 but the decoration is without good Cycladic parallel. There is however a marble rhyton in the Goulandris Collection'08 with breasts similarly in relief, where the base is not circular but oblong, perhaps representing feet. There are no other anthropomorphic vessels in the Cycladic Ear- ly Bronze Age, but fragments of clay pots with hu- man feet were found in the Neolithic settlement of Saliagos near Antiparos,'o' and there are paral- lels for these clay forms in mainland Greece and in Central Europe. THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE CYCLADIC FIGURINES The chronological sequence developed above makes it possible to reconsider the origin of the various forms of Cycladic figurine. The conclu- sions reached, which are admittedly hypothetical, are illustrated diagrammatically in ill. 4. This family tree, or dendrogram, does not indicate mere- ly similarities between figurines: it is able to pre- sent a cladistic arrangement, that is to say, genetic relationships between figurines. This is possible since the chronological contexts of the main types were determined above by considering patterns of recurrent association."11 I. Schematic Figurines The distribution of schematic figurines in Early Bronze Age times is by no means limited to the Cycladic islands. At least four further types of Brettidolen have to be considered. Perhaps the earliest of these is the Troy I type (ill. I, Tr.). It has a figure-of-eight outline, formed by the separation of the head and body. The form is exceedingly rare in the Cyclades."' It is seen al- ready in the First City at Troy,112 but its predeces- sors are unknown. The Beycesultan type (ill. I, Be.), with its hori- zontal, outward-pointing arm stumps, is very simi- lar to the shouldered type in the Cyclades, apart from the distinguishing shape of the arm stumps. At Beycesultan it belongs to the Early Bronze I period."' The Kusura type (ill. I, Ku.) is known from Winifrid Lamb's excavations at Kusura, from Ka- ratag-Semayiik, and from other Anatolian sites.'"" It is distinguished by its disc-shaped head, joined by a prong-like neck to a spade-shaped body. It is perhaps rather later than the Troy I and Beycesultan types, both of which are seen already in the Early Bronze I period. In Crete, although the figure-of-eight Troy I type is found,"' the most characteristic is the Aghios Onouphrios type (ill. i, A.O.; pl. io, d-f), where a broader-than-circular body on exceedingly short legs supports a small head and narrow neck.16 The Troy I type is known in Crete from an EM I context at Lebena, but the Aghios Onouphrios type probably began in EM II. Schematic figurines are found in Crete as early as the Neolithic period (pl. Io, c). These Early Bronze Age figurines are not suffi- ciently early to serve as prototypes for the schematic 107Ts.I898 pi. IO,I8; Zervos figs. 1-2. 1os D-G 57. 109 Evans and Renfrew, op.cit.

Typological development of Early Cycladic figurines from their Neolithic prototypes</page><page sequence="29">1969] EARLY CYCLADIC FIGURINES 29 figurines of the Grotta-Pelos culture, whose be- ginning antedates that of Troy I. But they do at least show that the taste for Brettidolen was com- mon to Crete and west Anatolia as well as the Cyclades, although the precise form was generally a local one. Much earlier than these, however, and among the Cycladic islands themselves, a very closely similar prototype is available. At the Neolithic island site of Saliagos near Antiparos, a schematic figurine very close to the Grotta-Pelos shouldered type was found"'7 (pl. 2, c). The site has been dated to about 4000 B.C. Apart from the notch on the prong neck, which perhaps indicates the mouth, it is hardly dis- tinguishable from the Grotta-Pelos shouldered form. The ancestry of the Grotta-Pelos schematic figurines is thus a long one. Interestingly, a much more detailed representation, of a fat lady, was found in a context of the same period at Saliagos, indicating that then, as in the Grotta-Pelos period, schematic and more elaborate figurines were in use at the same time."8s It may be that this schematic form at Saliagos is derived from such seated fat ladies. Certainly an intermediate stage in the development seems to be represented by a seated figurine said to be from Melos and published by Wace,*'9 who rather cavalierly rejected the island attribution. The prong head has no neck, but simply a nick, just as is seen on the Saliagos schematic figurine. The arms have almost disappeared, and the legs are much thinner than on the Saliagos Fat Lady. In outline at least, and in the profile from above the waist, this figu- rine is very like the Saliagos schematic figurine. Saliagos can also provide prototypes for the peb- ble figurines of Type I.D (pl. 2, a), and several other forms of schematic figurine were found.120 The origin of the Apeiranthos-schematic figurine, of the Keros-Syros culture, does not present any problems. It is doubtless a development of the Grotta-Pelos schematic figurines, perhaps of the notch-waist type. But these are no longer Brettido- len: the head often curves back, perhaps in imita- tion of the FAFs. The suggestion is perhaps strengthened by the existence of a nose on a figu- rine at Aghios Kosmas.'21 An example from Aghia Irini on Kea goes so far as to indicate the arms in a style related to the FAFs of Chalandriani varie- ty.122 ty. 2. Plastiras Figurines The Plastiras figurine differs in almost every way from the contemporary Brettidolen of the Grotta- Pelos culture. Lacking the stylish simplicity of the latter, it shows in some points--ears, navel, knees-a surprising attention to detail. As mentioned above, such a variety of styles is already seen at Saliagos more than a millennium earlier, where schematic figurines and the seated Fat Lady (pl. i, a) belong to the same period. The position of the hands of the Plastiras figurines, meeting finger to finger above the waist, is the same in the Plastiras figurines as in this Neolithic Fat Lady. And the resemblance between the Plas- tiras figurine and the Neolithic fat figurines is yet closer if a standing example of the latter be con- sidered. The seated lady of Saliagos, with that from San- gri in Naxos, is one of a large family of seated fat ladies,'23 including an example from near Athens (pl. i,b) and some from Sparta in the Pelopon- nese.12' These in turn are closely related to the numerous standing figurines of marble of the Aegean, such as those from Sparta,125 once again, and from Aegina.126 Another, possibly from Amor- gos, is in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford (pl. I, c). These figurines, whether seated or standing, may be regarded as broadly contemporary, the Mid- dle Neolithic successors of the standing figurines of clay of the Greek Early Neolithic. The similari- ties between the seated Fat Lady of Saliagos and the standing figurines of Aegina, Sparta or "Amor- gos" are self-evident. All of these standing versions, with arms held, finger to finger, at the waist, would make very good prototypes for the Plastiras figurine type.

The stylistic dichotomy of the Neo- lithic Saliagos culture (fat figurine/schematic figu- rine) thus continued directly into the Early Bronze Age Grotta-Pelos culture. 3. Louros Figurines The third figurine form of the Grotta-Pelos culture, the Louros type, does not have any suit- able prototype at Saliagos."x2 The arm stumps, the slightly tilted head and the simple form can, how- ever, be paralleled by some of the Late Neolithic figurines of Thessaly (cf. pl. 3, a)."129 The range of forms in the Dhimini culture is very great, how- ever, both in clay and in marble, so that a prototype should not be accepted unless it can show a close resemblance to its supposed successor. The marble figurines of the Dhimini culture do not usually show divided legs, and the suggestion is perhaps not as satisfactory as that of the Saliagos proto- types for the schematic and Plastiras types. How- ever the chronological position should be correct. Dhimini is certainly later than developed Sesklo, and precedes the Thessalian Early Bronze Age. There is a Radiocarbon date of 3680 ? 150 B.C., which places this phase of Dhimini contemporary with the end of the occupation of Saliagos.'3 The Dhimini culture must certainly be underway well before the inception of the Grotta-Pelos culture. Just as schematic figurines of marble developed in the Cyclades during the Middle and later Neo- lithic, a range of rather simple forms came into be- ing in Thessaly. Both had as their ancestors the more carefully representational figurines of the Early Neolithic. And both apparently had some in- fluence on the development of the figurines of the Grotta-Pelos culture. Contacts between Thessaly and the Cyclades, from the earliest Neolithic times, are well documented by finds in Thessaly of Melian obsidian. It seems likely that the Louros form arose as a result of these contacts. The three major figurine types of the Grotta- Pelos culture, the schematic, the Plastiras and the Louros, thus find convenient prototypes in the Middle and Late Neolithic of the Cyclades and of Thessaly. Doubtless the evolution was a rather gradual one. 4. Folded-Arm Figurines There is in the Cyclades no single and adequate prototype for the FAFs of the Keros-Syros cul- ture. Certainly marble figurines were already being produced in great quantity during the Grotta-Pelos culture, and these were buried in cist graves in very much the same way as were the FAFs of the succeeding period. But only the Plastiras figurine shows the same sort of detail as the FAF, and it lacks entirely the overall stylistic unity and grace of the FAF. And two essential details are there lacking which are common to all the FAFs: the tilted-back head with prong nose, and the folded- arm position. Naturally there is no obligation to seek an ear- lier origin for every feature possessed by this type. To do so would be to deny any originality what- ever to its makers. But the possibility of a gradual evolution for several points of detail makes the de- velopment of this form more comprehensible. In- deed the stylistic unity of the FAFs is testimony enough to the skill and originality of their makers, and it is not likely that they developed the type without reference to those already in existence. For the tilting of the head, a number of proto- types may be considered. The first is the rather rounded head of the Louros figurine, which is simi- larly simplified, but which entirely lacks a nose. Certainly relevant here are two clay figurine heads from the Late Neolithic cemetery at Kephala on the northerly Cycladic island of Kea.3*' Both the nose and the tilt of the head are there, although unfortunately the bodies which go with these heads have not been found (cf. ill. 4). A similar head has been found in the Athenian Agora, with other finds which, like those of Kepha- la, relate to the Thessalian Late Neolithic. Chief among them is the remarkable "coal scuttle" ves- sel,"32 found also at Sesklo.3ss Clay heads with striking noses somewhat reminiscent of the Kephala ones have been found at Dhimini, but this is not unduly surprising in view of the large range of 127 Marble figurines are found also in the Neolithic of Crete, cf. J. D. Evans, "Excavations in the Neolithic Settlement of Knossos," BSA 59 (1964) pl. 66. Neither these nor those of Anatolia offer any close similarity to those of mainland Greece or of Saliagos. 128 The flat profile and divided legs are however seen, cf. Evans and Renfrew (op.cit. n. 24 supra) fig. 78, 1:2; pl. XLIV, 1-3. 129 E.g. Zervos op.cit. (n. 124 supra) pls. 341, 467, 469. 130 Cf. V. Miloj6i6, Germania (1961) 446. The range of occupation at Saliagos is from 4222 ?_74 B.c. (P-131 ) to 3766?-85 B.c. (P-1939). 131 Caskey, op.cit. (n. 98 supra) pl. 46,c-d. 132 Ibid. pl. 46,e-f. 133 Zervos, op.cit.

It may be that the Kephala head, like the Louros type, was inspired by pre- cursors in the Dhimini culture. And both were in- fluential in the formation of the FAF shape. The Dhimini culture can also provide proto- types for some of the variants of the FAF. Seated figurines of rather simple style are found in the Dhimini culture,'' in some cases on four-legged stools,"s5 very similar to those supporting the Keros- Syros seated figurines. The Dhimini seated figu- rines are of clay, however. The seated clay figurines of Hamangia in Rumanial36 have often been quot- ed in connection with the Cycladic ones, from which they are sometimes supposed to have de- rived. It is now clear that the Hamangia figurines are earlier than the Keros-Syros culture, however. There seems no need to suppose any connection when the Dhimini culture, with its proved Cycla- dic links, can provide closer prototypes. The tilted head of the FAFs, and the general simplicity of the form, both find adequate precur- sors in the Cyclades. But there are no satisfactory prototypes for the folded-arm position itself, in the islands, in Greece or in Crete. In this instance it seems necessary to look eastwards. At Hasano'lan in Central Anatolia was found a magnificent figurine made of electrum, covered in places with sheet gold137 (pl. 3, c). The arms here are precisely in the folded-arm position, so that a comparison with the Cycladic figurines is inevita- ble. 18 Although no other figurines of precisely this type are known in Anatolia, a lead figurine from Troy,'39 and a trinket mould for similar figurines bought at Izmir0 are close to the folded-arm posi- tion. Several other metal figurines are known from Anatolia and the Near East"' at this period, the second phase of the Early Bronze Age. The won- derful cache of six metal figurines from Tell al- Judaidah in the Amouq4"' may indeed be earlier. It is thus very possible that the folded-arm position may have antecedents in metal figurines in Ana- tolia or the Near East before the Early Bronze 2 period. Certainly it appears to have none in the Cyclades before the Keros-Syros culture. I would like to suggest that metal figurines like the Hasanowlan figurine (although this object it- self may not be earlier than the Keros-Syros cul- ture) were responsible for the basic idec, of the folded-arm type, which became so populk r in the Cyclades."3 Metal figurines were probabl) already in existence in the Cyclades during the Grotta- Pelos period,"4 and a few silver figurines of the Hasanoglan type could well have found their way to the Aegean. This was a time when many metal forms were being imitated in marble in the Aegean. The metal depas cup is seen in stone at Knossos"' and at Lerna." The metal sauceboat was imitated in marble in the Cyclades."7 It seems eminently plau- sible that metal figurines should likewise have been imitated. However there is another possible origin for the folded-arm position of the Cycladic figurines, and indeed of the Hasanoglan one, among the marble figurines of the Gumelnitsa culture of Bulgaria. The chronological position of this culture is fixed in the fourth millennium B.c. by its stratification in Levels V and VI at Karanovo, and by recent radiocarbon dates."" The suggestion that the Gu- melnitsa figurines show influence from the Cycla- des can thus be ruled out. Along with a variety of clay figurines, two rather well-defined types occur: a schematic one, usually of bone, which is also common in Rumania,"49 13' Zervos, op.cit.

Canby indeed (op.cit., n. 138 supra, 51) noted the flattening of the inside of the leg of the Hasanoklan figurine and suggested that this was due to a marble proto- type, from the Cyclades. This may, of course, be the case, but it would leave us with no prototype for the folded-arm position in the islands. 145 N.

The Hasanoglan figurine could be imagined as a rather thin Anatolian variant of this Bulgarian form, which in one case (Blagoevo near Razgrad) attains the height of 35 cm. Even the separate ankle rings in the Hasanoglan example find parallels in copper on some of the Bulgarian figurines. The extent of Bulgarian influence on Anatolia at the end of the Chalcolithic period has yet to be estab- lished,152 but the close similarity between the finds of Karanovo VII or Dipsiskata Mogila and those of Troy I and Thermi indicate that there is at least a possibility of Bulgarian Chalcolithic traditions surviving into the Anatolian, and hence the Aege- an, Early Bronze Age. In this case the similarity between the Cycladic and the Bulgarian figurines would not be fortuitous. The Bulgarian figurines could be prototypes for the folded-arm position both in the Cyclades and the Hasanoglan figurine. All this is of course hypothetical at the moment, and will remain so until we know more of Aegean/ Anatolian/Balkan contacts at this time. But it is, perhaps, worth remembering that what at first ap- pear to be somewhat superficial similarities may have a genuine historical cause. This search for prototypes is, of course, only part of the story. A separate question is the need for such figurines at all, in the society which produced them-a need already felt in the Grotta-Pelos pe- riod. Another problem is the formation of the uniquely Cycladic style: this was the real contribu- tion to prehistoric art, rather than the adoption of a particular posture. So coherent a style is rare among prehistoric cultures. Finally there is the question of the extreme stand- ardization already referred to in the first section: this pleasing conventionality which required that Cycladic objects and idols should conform to types rather than enjoy the much greater freedom of form seen in the Dhimini culture of Thessaly or the Vinia culture of Serbia. So strict was the con- vention that deviations appear to us as liberties: the chosen form has become a rigorous norm. Art is said to imitate art rather than nature, and surely some such process lies behind the conserva- tism of the FAFs. Perhaps the most satisfactory parallel case lies in the kouroi of archaic Greek sculpture. Here a similarly rigid convention domi- nated the sculpture of an entire culture for a con- siderable period. And the history of the sculpture of the time is very much one of development in, and divergence from, the established norm. In both cases the fundamental posture seems to have come from overseas, and the precise reasons for its enthu- siastic adoption are in neither case clear. In both, the Cycladic islands, with their marble and emery, were crucially important in the development of the style. This sense of style, its consistency and the religious feeling which inspired it, were local creations. And in the Early Bronze Age these qualities are already evident in the simple schematic figurines of the Grotta-Pelos culture. Compared with the bewildering variety among the Dhimini figurines, these too show a tough single-minded- ness, for which the nature of their material can only partly account. The folded-arm figurines of the Keros-Syros culture again have these features, coupled with another which is uncommon in prehistoric art: grace, combined with a vivid sense of artistic unity. These qualities are not lost, even on the monumen- tal scale of the largest figurines, or in the different poses of the musicians. They are indeed qualities which are very much what we seek in the artistic products of the present day. It is perhaps this early and consummate anticipation of modern aesthetic criteria which makes us today so very sensitive to the appeal of these beautifully simple and con- trolled works of art. There is still much which we should wish to learn about them--of their religious function, of the rigid conventions which determined the form, and of their sculptors. But at least it now seems possible to identify the prototypes of these remark- able sculptures, and to follow the apparently con- tinuous development from the rather lumpish figu- rines of the Greek Neolithic period to the sophis- ticated products of the Cycladic Early Bronze Age, some three millennia later.
