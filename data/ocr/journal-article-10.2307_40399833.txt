<plain_text><page sequence="1">Milton's Royalism: A Study of the Conflict of Symbol and Idea in the Poems. Malcolm Mackenzie Ross. Ithaca, N. Y.: Cornell University Press, 1943. Pp. 150. According to Mr. Ross, Milton's comparative isolation among the Cambridge Platonists and at Horton caused him to continue the Faerie Queene tradition, not only in the early poems with their allegorical, ab- stract virtues, but also in his projections of an Arthurian nationalistic epic at a time when contemporary implications were becoming ever more difficult for one of middle class, Parliamentarian sympathies. The latter fact and Milton's eventual disillusionment with the seeming political failure of his ideas in the Restoration led him to abandon earthly kings in favor of the Paradise Lost theme. Insofar as this epic presents a completely autocratic God of necessity</page><page sequence="2">198 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY depicted in regal symbolism, Milton fell into a "conflict between royalist imagery and anti-royalist ideology" and, consequently, into contradic- tions like the following: God is anthropomorphic rather than the Platonic essence of the early poems; Hell is but a copy of Heaven; Heaven itself is, by turns, decoratively Arthurian and Catholic rather than Puritan; Satan and followers must be worthy opposition for God and so, signifi- cantly, not until after the war in Heaven, "after the royalist symbolism of power has served its purpose of providing dramatic opposition to God," are they presented in images of evil. Such shifts can be justified logically and theologically, but not poetically. A single three-level symbol with three separate connotations is a difficult problem, but it becomes an insoluble one "when one connotation, one set of traditional values attached to the symbol, is in sharp contradiction with another." In Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes Milton consciously tried and usually succeeded in controlling the connotation of the royalist symbol. The Arthurian symbol of Paradise Regained is also split, but external power is always associated with evil, the inner virtues always with good. Samson Agonistes, concerned with God's power triumphing through man's virtue, never refers to God as "King." "Thus political revolution has forced Milton to restrict the range of poetic suggestion. Like Samson, he is shorn of his power symbol. The Elizabethan royalist tradition is dead." Mr. Ross has developed his study in well-reasoned, well-documented fashion, and in a very readable style. Particularly praiseworthy is his treatment of the Elizabethan class background and the influence of political and social pressures on Milton's poems as manifested in their symbolism. Studies of literary imagery have too frequently been too ex- clusively occupied with mere subject matter classification or with purely individual factors. I offer the following qualifications only to temper occasional enthu- siastic overstatements relative to a thesis with which I am in general agreement. (1) The vengeful justice of God must not be though of as dominating Paradise Lost; of equal import are mercy symbolized in the Son and human heroism represented in Adam's rather cheerful shoulder- ing of his mortal burden. (2) The anthropomorphic nature of God in this poem is less certain than Mr. Ross thinks, for God is seen only in the Son and speaks only to, or in the presence of, the latter. (3) The royalist symbolism is not attributed to Satan and his followers to make them worthy adversaries of God; the rebels began as angels, a theological assumption which precludes any immediate poetic distinction between them and the faithful, and between Hell and Heaven.
