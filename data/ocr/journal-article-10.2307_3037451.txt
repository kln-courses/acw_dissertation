ISBN: 0-87156-379-7. 1995. This is a beautiful book. So beautiful, in fact, that many academics may succumb to the snobbish re- flex that often accompanies visual pleasure of this scope: the text has got to be a letdown, they will think; it must appeal to the smallest common de- nominator and serve out mental pablum. All the more so when they glance at the title and topic: Bird Brains: The Intelligence of Crows, Ravens, Magpies, and Jays. Anthropomorphic anecdotes on clever pets? Or abstract lab experiments designed to order cor- vids on the middle steps of the scala naturae of com- parative psychology? Well, not so! This book is as beautifully written and researched as it is illustrated. Candace Savage avoids the most obvious pitfall of a book like this one, the common view that animals are intelligent when they do humanlike things such as talking to chimp-friendly computers, grooming themselves in a mirror or imitating a teacher. Fifteen years ago, Donald Griffin persuaded many black-box biolo- gists that it was worth listening in the dark of animal minds. What we should listen for, and how we should recognize it when we hear it, however, remain unre- solved. Candace Savage brings together several classic re- search programs on corvid behavior and weaves them together with the common thread of animal intelligence. Complex family relations and helping at the nest in Florida scrub jays, recruitment signals in ravens, food storing and spatial memory in Clark's nutcracker, search images in carrion crows, optimal shell-dropping in northwestern crows, tool use in blue jays: all have been the subject of careful primary research focusing on natural behavior, which Savage summarizes very neatly. Seen against this background of hard data, the anecdotes on jackdaws quoted from old Konrad Lo- renz books seem a bit out of place. Despite the title (which may be misleadingly "cute"), there is also surprisingly little about brains in Savage's book, not even in the obvious section dealing with recovery of stored food, where robust data now exist linking the hippocampus with spatial memory. These are minor quibbles, however, about a book that is, over-</page><page sequence="2">SEPTEMBER 1997 NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 355 all, both beautiful and intelligent, like the birds it describes. It is remarkably affordable as well. In addition to the often breathtaking photogra- phy (Hannu Hautala's shot of three magpies in flight will persist in many people's minds as an im- age of avian perfection), the greatest value of this book may be to remind both the professional and lay audience that animal intelligence is best viewed in the animal's own terms, offering complex, inno- vative solutions to feeding, kinship and memory problems the animal faces in its own world, not the world of the human experimenter.
