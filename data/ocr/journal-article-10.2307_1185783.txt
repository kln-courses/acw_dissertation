<plain_text><page sequence="1">ELIADE AND HULTKRANTZ: THE EUROPEAN PRIMITIVISM TRADITION BY ALICE B. KEHOE Copyright @ 1997 Alice B. Kehoe Two Europeans, Mircea Eliade and Ake Hultkrantz, have inspired a generation of academics and the public fascinated by the field of comparative religions. Intellectual brilliance, passion, vision-in short, charisma-mark these savants. So, too, does an arrogant cultural imperialism that denies full humanity to the first nations of the Americas. Eliade, and to a much lesser extent Hultkrantz, have fed the romantic demiurge presenting American Indians as primal survivals husbanding an archaic ecstasy that may yet save the White millions who suffer, in Hultkrantz's words, an "inability to lead authentic lives" (quoted in Vecsey 1981:xii). Eliade created for these poor souls "a new humanism" readily popularized into New Age "neo-shamanism." His "new humanism" turns out to be a very old primitivism (Lovejoy and Boas 1965[1935]) seducing "transvestites in the cultural domain," to borrow Christian Feest's (1990:327) felicitous phrase for contemporary Europeans who dress in Indian costume. Prominent in the oeuvre of these European scholars are studies of what they term "shamanism." To clear the deck here, let me survey the uses of this term. "Shamanism" has come to be used to refer to: (1) Its original reference, a religious complex in Siberia centering on the Tungus-Evenki trained practitioner utilizing drum and chant to create an altered state of consciousness believed to enable the practitioner to divine and to negotiate in the spirit world for desired effects (e.g., Shirokogoroff 1935). (2) Religious practice opposed to historical Western religions, featuring ecstatic states (trance, possession) and emphasizing individuals' subjective calling by spirits as contrasted to the literate religions' formal ordination of practitioners (cf. Liberty 1970). (3) A primordial or primeval religion, or type of religious leader, supposed to have persisted since the Paleolithic among primitive hunter-gatherer/nomadic peoples (cf. Kehoe 1990). (4) Techniques of altering consciousness, in contemporary Western societies no longer necessarily yoked to religious beliefs (Harner 1980). Contemporary "shamanism" may be used to heal or for self-expression. Senses (2) and (3) perpetuate the ideological dichotomy between "civilized West" and "others," a construction of the Wild Man attributed to "shamans" since the eighteenth century (Flaherty 1992).

KEHOE IS A PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SCIENCES AT MARQUETTE UNIVERSIT MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER /VOL. 20(3) 377</page><page sequence="2">ELIADE AND HULTKRANTZ If we restrict "shamanism" to its historical association with Siberian (or Subarctic) nations, we must discuss concepts that have been inappropri- ately lumped under the rubric "shamanistic." These include the notion of personal numinosity attributed to spiritual leaders, for which I suggest the appropriate term is "charisma" (cf. Overholt 1984). The principle that rulers serve by divine agency is "divine mandate" or "heaven's mandate." Rex est mixta persona cum sacredote refers to the concept of priest-king (Feeley-Harnik 1985). Neither of these is compatible with shamanism historically attested (Hamayon 1994:88). The premise of survivals of primordial, or Paleolithic, religion among non-Western nations must be rejected by historians and social scientists; the premise is contrary to evolutionary biology and I cannot think of any scientific method of establishing its validity. Finally, techniques of altering consciousness should be described according to their physiological correlates to clarify, insofar as medical knowledge permits, human biological features tending to appear in similar emotional situations. SHAMANISM SENSU STRICTO The entry on "Turkish and Mongolian Shamanism" in Bonnefoy's Asian Mythologies states, In the narrow sense of the word, shamanism is a tech- nique specific to the Altaic (Turks, Mongols, Tungus) and Siberian peoples. It involves a representation of the world as divided into levels connected by a central axis and the use of trance as a means to accomplish the cosmic voyages, to heal the sick, and to foretell the future .... [The] Turkish name for the shaman, qam [kam], is attested in the Tang Annals on the subject of the Kirghiz .... [It] appears that up to the end of the first millennium, if not longer, the quest for magical powers, which is today its essential constituent, did not exist (Jean-Paul Roux in Bonnefoy 1993[1981]: 339). David Holmberg (1989:144-145) remarks that: Although a rich ethnographic literature is subsumed under the term shamanism, shamanism remains intractable as an object of general study, in part because disparate practices have been disassociated from larger cultural contexts and linked to universal motivations .... [The] reconstruction of shamanism as an isolate appears as an anthropological illusion ... historically comparable to totemism, the reality of which lies as much in anthropological conceptualizing as in ethnographic reality. 378 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER /VOL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="3">ALICE B. KEHOE Thomas and Humphrey (1994:2) situate the persistence of this anthropological illusion in "the broader cultural preoccupation with the primordial and transgressive," nurtured by "exclusively discursive reflec- tion." The Finnish ethnographer Uno Harva published a classic general description of Subarctic shamanism in volume 4 of Mythologies ofAll Races (1927). Harva spent the summers of 1911, 1912, and 1913 with respectively the Votiaks (Votyaks or Udmurt, their indigenous ethnonym), a Permian-speaking nation in the Urals, in the Siberian Arctic, and among the Cheremis (Marl, a Volgic-speaking nation in the great bend of the Volga), to extend his knowledge beyond the Finnish groups he already had studied. Harva incorporated published materials in Finnish and Russian as well as the Western European languages. His volume is divided into two sections, Finno-Ugric and "Siberian," the latter referring to Altaic speakers. The word "shaman" is from the Tungus saman, postulated to have derived from Sanskrit sramana via Pali samana, but Siikala (1992:2), contrary to Eliade (1964:496), accepts Berthold Laufer's 1917 argument that the derivation is spurious. I. M. Lewis (1986:114, n. 10), citing "personal communication" from Austerlitz, states: "The distinguished authority on Tungusic languages Robert Austerlitz ... considers the hypothesis of an Indian origin of the Tungus form 'moribund.'"'1 Whatever the origin of the word, Tungusic shamanism partakes of practices and beliefs common throughout central and northern Asia as "folk" or "practical" religion. Among the nomadic peoples of Siberia and Inner Asia (Siikala 1992:2-12), shamans train to induce trance and to learn the map of the multi-layered alternate world they must traverse to meet and gain assistance from spirits. Shamans would be ranked by their communities according to the status or power of the spirits with which the shaman could ally. The one essential component of all Asian (and northern North American) shamanism is the drum, usually a single-headed skin drum, beaten either by the shamans themselves or by assistants. Asian shamans (except for the Chukchi, who are closely associated with the American Inuit) also require special dress, traditionally a hide shirt or tunic to which are attached cut-out figures and masks. These pendants were often of iron or other metal. Bird shamans, whose spirit allies were birds and/or who flew like birds in the alternate world, had long fringes said to resemble feathers on their garments. Shamans generally wore headdresses, often with copper plates and/or iron or other metal antlers. During the Stalinist era, Russian persecution of shamans as "parasites" on society (Levin and Potapov 1964:10) resulted in some photo- graphs of shamans wearing only ragged citizens' clothing.2 Among European and Central Asian societies, shamans functioned as (or with) priests leading sacrifices, including sacrifices of horses and cattle; in these ceremonies, communicants might all wear special white dress (e.g., Harva 1964:Pl.19, AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER /VOL. 20(3) 379</page><page sequence="4">ELIADE AND HULTKRANTZ 21-23, 34, 46), an indication that the celebrants consciously constituted a congregation. Hamayon (1992) has a provocative generalization on Siberian shamanism: that the prominent shamans' rituals for hunting luck in the "most archaic" (apparently Buryat, Yakut, Tungus, and Samoyed) Siberian societies reveal a basic signification of "life renewal," communicated both through the necessity of game for human sustenance in these regions, and through mimicking the game's procreative activities in the rut. Hamayon (1992:134) claims that "in all Siberian languages" there is a term glossed as "games" referring to obligatory community exercises in wrestling (boys and men only), round dances (men and women together), other dances, and "gambols of various kinds" resembling the actions of game animals courting and mating. Shamans direct and lead these various activities, he states, and the "shaman himself behaves as a game animal at the end of the seance: he ritually falls down, as if he were dead, on a small carpet representing the supernatural world." Furthermore, "the very fact of imitating game animals makes man himself similar to them, that is, destined to be eaten" reciprocally by the animal spirits (1992:136). The relationship, he continues (1992:137 n. 3), leads to the shaman "ritually marrying the daughter of the game-giver spirit, thus he will behave in the supernatural world as a full-right husband and not as an abductor." Compare this to David Holmberg's recounting (1989:171) of the foundational myth for Tamang "shamans" in Nepal, whose role is said to derive from a marriage between a human hunter and the daughter of the game-giving family. Most sources mention, but general commentaries omit, the standard practice of shamans being called to practice as a family profession. It is both expected and usual for shamans to be children or grandchildren of shamans.3 This is an important point (Thomas and Humphrey 1994:4) contradicting the common characterization of the shaman as a member of an unstructured egalitarian society called to his vocation by spirits. Hamayon (1992:137) suggests the shamans' emphasis on "partner relationships are a major means available to minorities for counterbalancing the hierarchical relationships on which centralized power rests." Overlooking the evidence for lineages of professional practitioners in favor of repeating the societies' rhetoric is but one of the effects of scholars deductively seeking data to confirm hypotheses created from Western ideology (D. Holmberg 1989:148). That ethnographic Finno-Ugric and Siberian shamanism and Ameri- can Subarctic shamanism are historically related seems indubitable. They share a suite of elements including use of the single-headed hand-held drum, icons of spirits hung from the shaman's costume (so that they jingle and clang as the shaman dances) and in the tent, the technique of inducing trance by increasing the rapidity of the drumbeats while performing dancing move- ments that often become frenzied, and preparing for the seance by fasting and, immediately prior to the drumming-dancing stage, ingesting a 380 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER /VOL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="5">ALICE B. KEHOE mind-altering substance-mushrooms, tobacco, vodka.4 Eurasian shamanS' souls leave their bodies, and the tent, during the trance and journey to alternative realms in the multi-layered cosmos, where they meet and actively seek to ally with (struggle with or propitiate) spirits who can assist in the shaman's task of healing or divining. Eurasian shamans do not usually transform into animals, they may fly as a bird, their long fringes serving as feathered wings and/or assisted by a flying spirit, or tunnel or swim, but they seem to be more or less ambiguously anthropomorphic in their soul travels. How far south did the complex of shamanic practices and concepts go in the Americas? Certainly it can be seen in the northern temperate latitude where historic nations were in frequent contact with, or themselves migrated from, the southern Subarctic. Yuwipi, for example, the seance practice of the Lakota, and the Ojibwe shaking tent (Hallowell 1942) are very close to Subarctic shamanism (Grim 1983); the powows of New England Algonkians probably would be another example. I do not see evidence of shamanism in the Spiro engravings or other Mississippian representations (trance does not equal shamanism). As for Meso- and South America, it is not impossible that Eurasian shamanism did reach so far, but it would be wise to distinguish the complex including the drum, shaking-tent seance, and jangling icons on the costume that marks Subarctic shamanism from more general physiological altered states of consciousness. A reasonably cautious evaluation can focus on the increase in intensity of occupations along the eastern North Pacific Rim ("Northwest Coast") in the first millennium A.D., correlating with an increase in sea mammal hunting that carried with it long-distance travel and increased importation of foreign materials and goods into coastal villages (Holland 1992). Early in the first millennium, the town (several hundred houses) of Ipiutak on Point Hope, Alaska, contained quantities of carved bone, antler, and ivory similar to the Scythian animal style of northern Eurasia, and one fragment of smelted iron. Direct contact between Siberians and Americans is historically attested from the mid-seventeenth century with the establish- ment of the Russian post on the Anadyr River, whence trade goods moved through the Chukchi into Alaska. In 1789, the Russians instituted an annual trading fair on the Anyni, a tributary of the Kolyma 1,300 kilometers west of Bering Strait. Chukchi continued to be the middlemen between Russians and Americans, although some Yuit traveled to the Anyui to trade directly. Many of the furs the Chukchi traded were American (Kehoe 1992: 503-504). The Russian hunting outpost on the Russian River in northern California, 1812-1841, employed hundreds of Siberians, many of whom married Pomo women and some of whom settled in the Indian villages. Opportunities for Siberian shamanism to be learned by Americans probably are as old as the development of Eurasian Siberian shamanism itself (accepting Roux's first millennium dating, above), and unquestionably existed from the mid-seventeenth century. The strong similarities to Siberian AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER /VOL. 20(3) 381</page><page sequence="6">ELIADE AND HULTKRANTZ shamanism throughout Subarctic North America, to the Innu [Naskapi] in Labrador and Inuit in Kalaallit Nunaat [Greenland] very likely reflect contacts over the past millennium: it should be obvious, from the multitude of data from history and languages, that the closer the similarities, the more recent the contact. The supposition that Subarctic shamanism is the survival of Paleolithic religion is contrary to the principle of descent with modification that Darwin articulated and that is congruent with historical knowledge; the supposition reflects the racist premise that non-Western nations are static and unchanging, in contrast to the dynamic West. ELIADE'S METAPHYSICS Mircea Eliade called himself a historian of religions, indeed he co-founded the journal History of Religions (in 1960, at Chicago). To inaugu- rate the journal, Eliade contributed an opening essay conjoining in its title "History of Religions and a New Humanism." It is the second term that describes Eliade's work, for he asserts that The sacred is a universal dimension and the beginnings of culture are rooted in religious experiences and beliefs....their original religious matrix [led to] ... secular cultural values ... (Eliade 1991[1969]:41) That which characterizes us as human and defines us vis-a-vis other orders of nature and God is the instinct for tran- scendence, the craving to be freed from oneself and to pass over into the other ... the fundamental and fated instinct of human nature for emergence from oneself and fusion with the other ... a bounding toward perfect freedom in the freedom of the other (Eliade 1991[1981]:62). Committed to this vision, Eliade said he believed all history is in some measure a fall of the sacred, a limitation and diminution. But the sacred does not cease to manifest itself, and with each new manifestation it resumes its original tendency to reveal itself wholly ... [there is an] ahistoricity of religious life (Eliade 1964:xix). Continuing his denial of time's arrow, Eliade declared (1964:xvii) that the very dialectic of the sacred tends indefinitely to repeat a series of archetypes, so that a hierophany realized at a certain "histori- cal moment" is structurally equivalent to a hierophany a thou- 382 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER /VOL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="7">ALICE B. KEHOE sand years earlier or later. I give Eliade's own words at length, for this mystique at the core of Eliade's thinking tends to be obscured by its overburden of citations to recondite publications in German, French, Italian, Russian, Hungarian, and Victorian English. Eliade embodied the erudite Continental savant; listeners could miss the clues that his pronouncements were more religious revelation than scholarly conclusion. Given his own ecstatic vision of transcendence, it is not surprising that Eliade had been collecting descriptions of "archaic techniques of ecstasy" since 1940. Six years later, he noted in his autobiography, he was invited to review a book attributing shamanic ecstasy to trances provoked by "Arctic hysteria." I attempted to situate the "problem of shamanism" in the context of the history of religions, the only perspective which does not nullify its significance and function. Thus I analyzed the typology of shamanic initiation and the structure of the ecstatic journeys . .. emphasizing analogies with the initiatory rites and mystical experiences of certain primitive and Oriental peoples (Eliade 1981:116-117). The review stimulated the preparation of a full-length study (Eliade 1964 [1951]). There Eliade presented his construction "shamanism" as a timeless phenomenon "at once mysticism, magic, and 'religion'.. one of the archaic techniques of ecstasy" (1964:xix). "Archaic" is not defined: Most often he refers to "societies" exemplified by "Central Asian shamanism... part and parcel of the prehistoric culture of the Siberian hunters,5 and ... among the primitive peoples ofAustralia, the Malay Archipelago, South America, North America, and other regions" (1964:502-503). Eliade selected certain tech- niques of inducing altered states of consciousness, noted their use in a variety of historic non-Western societies, and equated these societies with a supposed archaic time. That contemporary and prehistoric Homo sapiens sapiens share common physiology and therefore the capacity for similar altered states of consciousness is a reasonable, although not demonstrated, assumption. This premise does not allow one to label historically described and contemporary societies "archaic." The techniques of inducing altered states of consciousness that Eliade collates under "shamanism" may have persisted from Paleolithic discoveries extensively shared, or they may have been discovered again and again (and shared again and again), but we have no present means of determining states of consciousness of prehistoric humans.6 Eliade's premise that these altered states of consciousness are "the sacred" expressing itself is neither historical nor scientific. If it is phenomenological, it is flawed by AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER /VOL. 20(3) 383</page><page sequence="8">ELIADE AND HULTKRANTZ Eliade's metaphysicalpresupposition that "the sacred" does indeed exist and does reiterate its manifestation. Speaking in 1982, Eliade insisted that all believe in the inevitability and the imminence of our world's end ... The discovery (or re-discovery) of the value and significance of non-Western spiritualities represents a cultural innovation, for it launches a dialogue and an interrelationship with the others . . . historically, culturally, and spiritually we are entering, or ready to enter, a new era" (Eliade 1991[1982]:11-12, his italics). Mircea Eliade became a guru for the New Age. "Archaic techniques of ecstasy" bring devotees "back to the archetypal spiritual democracy enjoyed by primal tribal cultures and societies" (Le Vie 1990:39), explained one admirer. Eliade's remarkable abjuration of linear time visualized "the man of the archaic civilizations proud of his mode of existence, which allows him to be free and to create . . free to annul his own history through periodic abolition of time and collective regeneration" (Eliade 1991[1954]:81). Such annulment fits many New Age metaphysics, and Eliade's books and lectures gave it authority. If Eliade had acknowledged his intention to be inspirational, to present "poetic inquiry . . . an aesthetic expression of conceived Truth" (Geertz 1990:120), he would not concern us here. Unfortunately for members of the first nations of the Americas, Australia, and Asia, he labeled his work "history of religions" and embellished it with daunting arrays of scholarly citations. Willard Park, reviewing the 1964 English version of Shamanism, was impressed by Eliade's "great skill and learning" but concluded that "Eliade's scholarship is weak on ... the evaluation of the sources" (Park 1965:1306). Edmund Leach (1966) excoriated Eliade following the publication of Shamanism. Marjorie Balzer (1990:47-48 n. k) states that Eliade is "remarkably inaccurate on details about Siberian shamanism." We could situate Eliade's failing as a scholar in the fallacy of an appositive proof, defined by Fischer (1970:56) as a common but complex form of empirical error, which consists in an attempt to establish the existence of a quality in A [for Eliade, contemporary Western societies] by contrast with a quality in B ["archaic" peoples]-and B is misrepresented or misunder- stood. Eliade did no ethnographic fieldwork other than three years of study, during his early twenties, in India. Although he publishedAustralian Religions: An Introduction in 1973, he never went to Australia in spite of invitations to 384 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER /VOL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="9">ALICE B. KEHOE lecture and meet Aborigines (Carrasco 1991:141), nor did he ever go to sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, or, except for a winter trip to Yucatan and Guatemala in 1978-79, Latin America (Ricketts 1981:xiv). None of the several adulatory studies of his work mentions any contact with American Indian religious leaders, much less trips to reservations. Eliade was strictly, after his youthful adventure in India, an armchair savant. His student and translator Ricketts (1981:xxi) gives this astonishing judgment of Eliade as a scholar: One reviewer of the first volume thought he had demolished Eliade's autobiographical effort by calling it a piece of "creative hermeneutics" and "sacred fiction," a work that ascribes meanings to events "even when they aren't there." I believe that Eliade would not have objected to these characterizations, nor would he have considered them to be destructive criticism. HULTKRANTZ'S FAITH Ake Hultkrantz, Professor in the Institute of Comparative Religion, University of Stockholm, appears to organize behavior labeled "religious" by classifying observations under a set of themes established within the Euro- pean academic discipline: mythology, shamanism, owner/master of animals, trickster, culture hero, totemism, quest, High God, and so on. Examples of these categories are collected, collated into "careful inventories of religious categories ... a complete atlas of the morphology of conceptions, rites and myths" of homo religiosus (Hultkrantz quoted by Vecsey 1981:xvii). This view of comparative religion, premising the universality of European categories, is firmly rooted in the imperial ideology of the European Age of Exploration. Hultkrantz was fascinated since boyhood by "the mysterious and the unusual" in accounts of American Indians. He told Christopher Vecsey, the foremost American editor of his writings, that when he was encouraged, as a University of Stockholm student, to pursue this interest, "I threw myself over the literature on Indian religion. I was in the blessed isles. I loved it" (Vecsey 1981:x). Vecsey reports (1981:xi) that "Hultkrantz's romanticism has persisted," mentioning that the professor is a member of a popular Swedish "Indian Club." Contrasting with Eliade, Hultkrantz did carry out ethno- graphic fieldwork with North American Indians, specifically on the Wind River Reservation with Shoshone and Arapaho, beginning in 1948 when he was twenty-eight, returning in 1955 for six months and for the summers of 1957 and 1958. Ten years later, he found he was no longer welcome on Wind River, reducing him "[to trying] to conduct some small field work wherever he goes in the States, especially on the northern Plains" (Vecsey 1981:xiv). With Eliade, Hultkrantz shares a "'humanistic devotion' to his subjects ...[and] an 'intuitive process of controlled imagination' [rather than] the models of the social sciences" (Vecsey 1981:xix). Most importantly, both AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER /VOL. 20(3) 385</page><page sequence="10">ELIADE AND HULTKRANTZ scholars share the European primitivist (Lovejoy and Boas 1965[1935]) presumption that "remote" (from urban universities) "tribal peoples" pre- serve an Edenic primal religion immeasurably older than any literate religion. One of Hultkrantz' American students, Joseph Epes Brown, provides the most extreme statement of this assumption: American Indian religions represent pre-eminent examples of primal religious traditions that have been present in the Americas for some thirty to sixty thousand years. Fundamental elements common to the primal nature of those traditions ... survive into the present among Indian cultures of the Americas (Brown 1982:1) Hultkrantz himself is more circumspect: Some time very long ago, perhaps about 30,000 years before the present time, the first ancestors of today's Native Americans arrived in North America. ... Many of their ancient cultural traits have survived right into our own century, such as some dwelling types (earth lodges, conical tents or tipis, birchbark lodges or wigwams, wickiups of grass and brush), feathered ornaments (including feathered crowns or "war bonnets"), a democratic political organization (relative lack of chiefly authority, predomi- nance of tribal or group councils), hunting ceremonialism, and a deeply spiritual religion (Hultkrantz 1992:9) In this list, only the possibility of tent or wigwam dwellings can be inferred from actual archaeological data from the Paleoindian period. There is no evidence of feathered head ornaments before the Late Prehistoric period, no archaeological evidence for democratic political organization, group councils, or lack of chiefly authority-to the contrary, there is clear evidence for authoritative leadership in the temperate and tropical zones of the Americas for the past three thousand years. Hunting ceremonialism is as characteristic of English aristocrats as of contemporary American Indians, but is seldom attested archaeologically. Above all, there is no archaeological foundation for the claim of "a" (notice the singular) "deeply spiritual religion" among Paleoindians. How could "deep spirituality" be evidenced archaeologically? Such obliviousness to archaeological canons of evidence betrays Hultkrantz' reputation for rigor.7 As with Eliade, a cascade of bibliographic citations8 in six languages obscures the unattested premise. 386 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER /VOL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="11">ALICE B. KEHOE ARCHAIC ECSTASY There is, as Rodney Needham noted (1985), a genre of Western writing portraying exotic founts of spiritual knowledge. The genre persists from the Classical Greeks (Lovejoy and Boas 1965[1935]) and it is going strong, very strong, today (Kehoe 1990). Allied to the notion of the deeply spiritual primitive is the Enlightenment myth of unilinear cultural evolution with survivals visible today from earlier stages (Meek 1976). Already in 1794 the Scottish philosopher Dugald Stewart perceived the illusionary nature of the universal history: A few insulated facts may perhaps be collected from the casual observations of travellers, who have viewed the arrange- ments of rude nations, but nothing, it is evident, can be obtained in this way, which approaches to a regular and connected detail of human improvement. In this want of direct evidence, we are under a necessity of supplying the place of fact by conjecture, and sometimes our conclusions a priori, may tend to confirm the credibility of facts, which ... appeared to be doubtful or incredible. To this species of philosophical investigation, which has no appropriated name in our language, I shall take the liberty of giving the title of Theoretic or Conjectural History (Stewart quoted in Slotkin 1965:460). Conjectural histories are, as Agassi (1981:386) observed, myths for modern Western intellectuals, an alternative to Genesis. Malinowski con- cluded, Every historical change creates its mythology... but indirectly related to historical fact, . . a constant by-product ... of sociological status, which demands precedent; of moral rule, which requires sanction (Malinowski 1954 [1926]:146). The historical change from feudal to capitalist political economies engendered the Enlightenment. Capitalism's driving need to expand, to overcome or ignore political boundaries, demanded a universalizing worldview and the Enlightenment produced it. Dissecting phenomena into so many quanta to be subsumed into European categories, conjecturing a unilinear history for the single species Homo sapiens, eighteenth century philosophes laid the basis of modern knowledge in close colloquy with capitalist imperialism (e.g., Ludden 1993). There are now dozens of books outlining the construction of the Other as the necessary obverse of the Western self (Clifford 1986:23). This AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER /VOL. 20(3) 387</page><page sequence="12">ELIADE AND HULTKRANTZ Sartrean exercise tends to not only oversimplify the dialectic of role creation, but to imprison discourse in familiar Western oppositional dualism, hardly a new means to self knowledge. Primitivism is more than a drawing of the not-us. For Eliade and Hultkrantz, as for the Classical Greeks cited by Lovejoy and Boas (1965[1935]), the myth of the "deep spirituality" of non-Westerners is an existential condition shimmering on the edge of urban Europeans' horizon. Yearning to shed bourgeois clothing and partake of archaic ecstasy, they did realize that, as Hultkrantz remarked to Vecsey (1981:xi), "such a scenario [would be] 'ludicrous."' Educated men cannot become shamans. But educated men can see shamans, watch archaic ecstasy; though educated men may lead inauthentic lives of spurious culture (Sapir 1966[1924]), they do live in a world still throbbing with primal power. Eliade's and Hultkrantz' projections of their repressed romantic fantasies upon the Fourth World of encapsulated colonies draws upon classical Western primitivism and Enlight- enment unity of mankind (a masculine "kind") to envision: the world in which everything seems possible, where the dead return to life and the living die only to live again, where one can disappear and reappear instantaneously, where the "laws of nature" are abolished, and a certain superhuman "freedom" is exemplified and made dazzlingly present (Eliade 1964:511; his italics). Here is the charisma that draws disciples to these scholars: archaic ecstasy lives; there is a dazzling present world transcending the dull empiri- cism of the bourgeois West. After his youthful fling, Eliade wisely avoided physically traveling to these places of ecstasy. Hultkrantz did go to Wind River, in the wide green valley below snowy peaks, only to find politics and fry bread. The primordial spirituality they sought beckons educated Western- ers today, as it has for more than two millennia. This most venerable European tradition of primitivism, so thoroughly documented by Lovejoy and Boas, comes down to a myth that far away the long ago still exists. There in the wild places, noble savages preserve the true spirituality cast out of our cities. The European Enlightenment academic legacy that formed Eliade and Hultkrantz appropriated American Indians to roles already hoary in Herodotus' time. Contemporary scholars of comparative religion, as well as anthropolo- gists, have generally moved past the Enlightenment myth and modus operandi. Unhappily for the real people who belong to America's first nations, hundreds of thousands of other men and women seek the noble savages wisdom and archaic ecstasy. Primitivism pays off handsomely for New Age shamans. Those of us who consider ourselves honest scholars want to challenge this European legacy twisting, like the serpents of Laocoon, around so many accounts of American Indian religions. 388 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER /VOL. 20(3)</page><page sequence="13">ALICE B.

Balzer [1990:xvi, n. 4] lists a 1986 entry, "Shaman," by Austerlitz in Ural-Altaic Yearbook 58:143-144, but does not take a stand on the derivation. 2. Milovsky 1992, 1993 describes the resurgence following termination of the U.S.S.R. 3. Basilov (1990:8) cites a description of a child encouraged to imitate his shaman grandfather. 4. Siberian shamans are frequently mentioned smoking before a seance, I assume a practice brought in by Russian colonizers. They now use vodka "instead of" mushrooms, according to several contemporary ethnographers. 5. He cites here, K. J. Narr's "Nordasiatisch-europaische Urzeit in archaologischer und volkerkundlicher Sicht," Anthropos 1955. 6. Lewis-Williams and Dowson (1988) attempt a neuropsychological model but can only postulate a probability that it accounts for prehistoric human behavior. 7. Vecsey (1981:xv) tells us that Hultkrantz "characterizes his own work as 'academically rigourous' ... and in his scholarly bent toward historical and phenomenological rigor, eschew[s] the speculation of the Germans." 8. Yet with some strange omissions, for example, no citation of Virgil J. Vogel's standard American Indian Medicine (Oklahoma, 1970) in Hultkrantz' 1992 book subtitled Health and Medicine in Native North American Religious Traditions. 392 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER /VOL. 20(3)</page></plain_text>
