Ibáñez and F. Braemer Abstract: The lack of excavated Southern Syria Pottery Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites makes it difficult to undesrtand links between the Southern Levant and Central Syria. The youngest archaeological strata of Qarassa North Tell (Suweida governorate, Southern Syria ), excavated from 2007 to 2010, give an occupation sequence that witnesses these periods from the last quarter of the 6th millennium BCE to the middle of the 4th mill. BCE. This archaeological sequence is described by archaeological strata and pottery sets. Pottery as the main chrono -cultural tool is described in details with a techno -typological study, and inserted in the Levant context. Resume : Labsence de sites fouillés représentant les périodes néolithique céramique et chalcolithique en Syrie du sud a rendu difficile jusqu'à présent la mise en relation des mondes de la Syrie centrale et du Levant sud. Les niveaux les plus récents du tell nord du site de Qarassa ( province de Suweida, Syrie méridionale), fouillés de 2007 à 2010, fournissent une séquence d'occupations représentant ces périodes entre le dernier quart du VIe millénaire et la première moitié du IVe millénaire av. notre ère. Cette séquence est présentée par phases architecturales et horizons céramiques, avec l'analyse des structures qui marquent certaines de ces occupations. Le matériel céramique, principal témoin chrono -culturel, est décrit en détail dans une étude techno-typologique et inséré dans le contexte global du Levant.

INTRODUCTION In recent decades, excavations and surveys have slowly increased our knowledge about the Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic periods in Southern Syria, filling the void between the Euphrates and Jordan regions (Stordeur et al. 2010). The information gap in Southern Syria and Northern Jordan is still large for the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods: there is no excavated and published sequence between the mid Orontes Valley (Shir) and the settlements in the Northern Jordan Valley (Munhata, Sha'ar Hagolan) and the plateau area (Sahab, 'Ain Ghazal, Jebel Abu Thawwab, Wadi Ziqlab). The Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods are sparsely documented in the basalt Southern Syrian plains, for the most part by lithic artefacts: Cauvin, during his survey around Taybeh and Zeizun (Cauvin 1963), identified lithic scatters but no built settlements, and the tumulus near Deraa station exca- vated by J. Nasrallah (1950) was disturbed by later tombs. The Late Chalcolithic Jawlan sites are not stratified (Epstein 1998). To the north, the excavation at Tell Ramad (de Contenson 2000: 15, 219), on the first slope of the Hermon massif, highlighted for the first time Pottery Neolithic artefacts found in a large pit. The rescue excavation at Tell Khazzami (de Contenson 1968) within the area of Damascus Airport was a reference for a potential stratified settlement, but the complete sequence was never excavated and the site is now destroyed.

Braemer, French map). excavated Tell al-Baharia (Sulaiman 2012) is a very important site, and the data analysis, when published, will probably yield the best sequence for the 6th-4th millennia BCE in the Ghouta of Damascus. A broad investigation program started in 2003, with the objective of identifying pre- and proto-historical sites within the borders of the Leja basaltic plateau in Southern Syria. The initial regional survey identified a new set of sites occupied from the Epipalaeolithic to the Chalcolithic periods, but few stratified settlements. This survey was followed by archaeo- logical exploration at Qarassa (fig. 1). We focused our field- work on the Qarassa site (Lat.: 32,832915; Long.: 36,412547; Suweida Mohafazat, Syria) for several reasons. First of all, it presents a chronology of occupation, pre- served in stratigraphy, from the Natufian to the Iron Age, divided between two tells. The northern one yields Pre Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) to Final Chalcolithic occupations, and the southern one was occupied from the Early Bronze Age I to the Iron Age, while the Natufian settlement was on the rock surface 400 m to the north (Terradas et al. 2012; Ibáñez et al. 2010; Braemer et al. 2011) (fig. 2). Furthermore, the Qarassa micro-region itself - with peren- nial waters from a spring and its lake, and in the wadi Abu Dhahab - offers interesting possibilities to tackle the issue of environmental changes throughout the Early Holocene in a region so far lacking such research (Braemer et al. 2011). Ultimately, the Qarassa excavations, connected to the recent Leja archaeological surveys (Braemer 2011), are shed- ding light on regional archaeological evidence and cultural developments from the onset of Neolithisation to the rise of complex urbanism in a region so far practically neglected, at last merging the Jordan Valley with the Northern Levant and Syria. The knowledge gap in Southern Syria may thus be, if not completely, partially filled. Fig. 2 - Qarassa.

A few lights against a dark background 155 Archaeological investigation of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic sequence at Qarassa North Tell started in 2009 after a diagnostic campaign in 2007. A first chronological evaluation of the partly mixed-up ceramic assemblage from the 2007 campaign pointed to the high probability of an occupation spanning from the Late Neolithic to the Final Chalcolithic, lying upon a PPNB level.1 Radiocarbon dat- ing of five rather poorly stratified samples2 confirmed the sequence in 2007. The excavation area was extended in 2009 and 2010. Due to the current Syrian troubles, the ongoing fieldwork was interrupted after the 2010 season and the fate of the Qarassa region and its friendly inhabitants is far from being settled. Thus, our paper will be restricted to the stratigraphy and the preliminary analyses of the pottery. QARASSA NORTH TELL, AREA 2: EXCAVATION STRATEGY AND THE STRATIGRAPHY Located on the southern fringe of the Leja plateau, the northern tell at Qarassa is a large mound, some 10 m high, 3.37 ha at its base and 1.21 ha on the higher terrace, topped by a small anthropic platform located on its eastern ridge. Dating back to the sixties, some houses are spread on the tell's south- ern side, as the vast majority of its surface is covered by olive trees. The north-western part is characterized by a middle ter- race culminating at 741 m amsl, some 6 m above the northern depression that separates the tell from the Leja basaltic lava flow (figs. 3 and 4). After highlighting its Neolithic and Chalcolithic charac- teristics during the 2007 excavation season and a preliminary analysis of pottery samples, it seemed obvious that a thorough analysis of the stratigraphy and chronology needed to be car- ried out, as the region was dramatically lacking such a long- lasting archaeological sequence. In 2009, a joint operation started in three excavation areas3 on the northern tell, directed by J.J. Ibáñez, in order to deter- mine its chronology and cultural aspects with two main objec- tives: one to determine the PPNB levels at the site and the 1. M. Godon and Z. Kafafi unpublished reports. 2.

Area 1 lies on the eastern slope of the tell, Area 2 and 3 were opened on the northern slope. Fig. 3 - Qarassa North Tell viewed toward the south. other to determine their chronology and cultural aspects of the post-PPNB occupations (Braemer et al. 2011). After two seasons of fieldwork, some 155 m2 were exca- vated in Area 2, by giving priority to a stratigraphie analysis of the northern tell terrace during the first season, then an exten- sive excavation on the terrace edges during 2010. As the 2007 campaign evaluated PPNB and Chalcolithic remains by removing surface layers that consist partly of stones rolled down the northern slope (squares K/L41) and the first architectural stratum on the edge of the terrace (squares N41/42), it seemed convenient to continue in the same excavation area. Therefore, in 2009, our strategy was to reach stratigraphie levels by excavating a trench of 5 x 10 m on the slope and at the edge of the terrace in a 5 x 5 m square (M41). With a steep kind of embankment 5 m high, covered by loose stones fallen down the slope, and topped by the mid- dle north-western terrace, this side of the tell is indeed the most suitable area for a stratigraphie evaluation. This first six weeks' season allowed us to identify the géomorphologie dynamics at the edge of the tell's northern side: the erosion and natural drainage effects cutting through archaeological deposits, and forming in some places quite thick fill including disturbed archaeological materials. Our first aim being the diagnosis of the tell's stratigraphy and formation processes, we attempted to record environmental dynamics such as climatic events. Consequently, instead of quickly removing all the disturbed layers covering and filling the slope, they were recorded thoroughly and samples were taken for environmental analyses. At the end of the first sea- son, the archaeological excavation was ca 3.5 m deep from the edges of the terrace to the lowest part of trench K41, with two more metres below to reach the northern base of the tell. As the stratified evidence of the Late Neolithic occupation Paléorient, vol. 41.1, p. 153-176 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2015</page><page sequence="4">156 M. GODON, J.S. BALDI, G. CHANEM, J.J. IBÁÑEZ and F. BRAEMER Fig. 4 - Qarassa North Tell, general plan and excavation areas . was still lacking at the end of the 2009 season, an enlarge- ment of the excavation area was planned in 2010, adding ca 80 m2 to the 75 m2 already excavated. The excavation of the PPNB levels was resumed in 2010, with the extension of the trench towards the north in the square J41, increasing the excavated area to ca 100 m2. A new excavation area (Area 3) was opened on the top of the terrace to obtain a better view of the most recently built structures (squares Q41/R41/R42/ R43). STRATIGRAPHIC HORIZONS Five stratigraphie horizons were identified, two of them anthropogenic, the other three corresponding to climatic events recorded in the tell sequence (figs. 5 and 6). The virgin ground has not yet been reached. HORIZON V The earliest Horizon (V) comprises the early occupation levels, dating back to the PPNB (Ibáñez et al. 2010; Santana et al. 2012). From the start, the excavation strategy included the identification of the PPNB stratigraphie pattern on the northern side of the mound (fig. 7). The architectural evi- dence supports our first diagnosis that this is a levelled settle- ment pattern, with two building stages discovered so far. The upper one (in L/M41) is probably later in its establishment if we consider the stone wall construction and the choices in stone size between those two architectural levels. The exact nature of this upper PPNB architectural layer, located some 1.3 m under the northern terrace surface, still raises some questions, as Late Neolithic material was found in tangible amounts close to the bottom of this structure. Further field- work is needed to understand the implantation process in the Late Neolithic particularly whether PPNB structures were reused as they were or were altered profoundly. There are other examples of the occupation of PPNB architectures by Paléorient, vol. 41.1, p. 153-176 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2015</page><page sequence="5">Qarassa North Tell, Southern Syria: The Pottery Neolithic and Chalcolithic sequence.

In Basta (Gebel 2009: 41), Pre-Pottery Neolithic C (PPNC) squatters lived among the ruins of L/F later PPNB buildings. In Jericho, in square FI, a squatting or camping stage was documented after the PPNB town was abandoned, probably by newcomers settling down at the beginning of the Pottery Neolithic period (Kenyon 1981: 92). In Ba'ja, Final PPNB squatters occupied some areas of the previously aban- doned Late PPNB village (Gebel and Hansen 2004: 16). The rough congruity of this squatting phenomenon, from Final PPNB, PPNC to Early PN, could indicate a largely spread behaviour during the Late 8th millennium and the first half of the 7th millennium cal. BCE. HORIZON IV Horizon IV corresponds to a wet climatic event, with heavy rains causing significant erosion processes that truncated anthropic deposits on the slope. Attested by periods of colluvial fill punctuated by variable drainage flow contained by the PPNB architectural remains,4 this horizon may corroborate the known climatic changes and increase in humidity around 8200 BP (Guilaine and Berger 2009). However, the absolute chronology of this level was not unequivocally determined (fig. 8). 4. See the NeoLithics 1/09, 2009 thematic volume about "Rubble Slides and Rapide Climate Change".

A few lights against a dark background 159 Fig. 9 - Chart of the archaeological horizons and the settlement phases . HORIZON III The third horizon represents the Late Neolithic to Late Chalcolithic occupation layers on the northern terrace. Preliminarily identified in square M41 during the 2009 sea- son, it was obvious that the complete stratigraphy of this hori- zon needed further investigation. The pottery material coming from the colluvial and drainage fill indicated an extended chronology of occupation that testifies a more complex devel- opment than the stratified records themselves. The 2010 excavation on the terrace's edge, eastward of the 2009 steep stratigraphie trench, allowed identification of four occupation macro-phases from the Late Neolithic to the Late Chalcolithic, which will be described below. HORIZONS II AND I A continuous colluvial deposit up to 70 cm thick on the Horizon III fill characterizes Horizon II. Just a few drain- age layers are evident, unlike in Horizon IV, as a heavy accumulation formed by loose stones expended from Horizon III structures on the slope acted as a barrier and stopped fast water flow. Light remains of platform layouts made of pisé and flat stones were recovered during the 2007 test excavation; a rather flimsy evidence of, perhaps, a Final Chalcolithic occupation connected with the better preserved one in the upper terrace Area 3. Erosion processes and agri- cultural activities, helped by rainwater flooding, washed away the pisé toward the northern slope, where it becomes mixed with colluvial deposits by percolation, forming a dense and thick padding through the whole extension of the excavated terrace's edge. This badly destroyed occupation is covered by Horizon I, namely the recent deposits displaying the expected and usual modern activities, in this case an unfortunate recent agricul- tural use that ploughed through some 20 to 40 cm of archaeo- logical sediment. OCCUPATION PHASES IN HORIZONS III AND II With the 2010 campaign and the first evidence from the slope trench excavation, Horizon III and its long and lasting chronology from the Final Neolithic to the Late Chalcolithic is close to being understood. Four archaeological phases are dis- cernible, almost 3 m in depth and exhibiting quite unexpected changes in architecture and use of space in such a restricted outer boundary area of the tell (fig. 9 and table 1).

THE LATE NEOLITHIC This lower phase, partially excavated on a limited surface in three squares (L41/M41/M42) still raises some questions to be clarified in future fieldwork. Embedded in the upper PPNB architectural level, the main issue to be tackled is the exact nature of this reoccupation of Qarassa North Tell in the Late Neolithic. The evidence at hand consists of a partially exca- vated curvilinear structure (Phase IV.2/US-25), seemingly the latest PPNB architectural level identified so far, with the stone wall construction method diverging from the two other PPNB structures near the base of the tell in terms of stone module selection (fig. 10).

A few lights against a dark background 161 Fig. 11 - Deep sounding in Phase IV showing a Late Neolithic occupation layer inside the upper PPNB structure. Furthermore, both an adjustment in the wall creating a pas- sageway through it as well as an occupation level deep inside the structure with, beyond any doubt, in situ Late Neolithic materials, clearly indicate that the architectural remains of the PPNB settle- ments were visible and reused during the Late Neolithic (fig. 11). During our 2009 excavation on the slope and its northern exten- sion, ceramic materials recovered in the last fill of the PPNB struc- tures are predominantly Late Neolithic, but mixed with PPNB lithic products. This predominance of Late Neolithic pottery, bearing in mind the lack of a Late Neolithic architectural level, strengthens the idea of a direct contact merging, if not embedding, the Late Neolithic occupation in the latest PPNB level. PHASE III. THE EARLY CHALCOLITHIC Even if partially excavated on a restricted surface, part of a structure in square M42 and a larger one in M/N44, some evidence characterizing the Early Chalcolithic occupa- tion is important to mention, presenting a clear stratigraphie development from the reused PPNB structure, and thus shed- ding light on architectural changes between the Late Neolithic and the Early Chalcolithic. Fig. 12 - Early Chalcolithic structures in squares M/N44. Part of the structure exposed near the southern limit of square M/N44 (fig. 12) discloses a front wall facing north, with four preserved layers of stonework. Flanked by two massive pillars about a metre high, a flagstone-paved entrance gives way to a room showing three occupation floor levels, the two later ones contemporary with phase II being stone-paved. This structure was not excavated. In square M42, the excavation reveals a stone wall oriented northward, where it bends toward the east without presenting any right-angled turn (fig. 10, north of square M42). It may represent a stage between curvilinear architecture and straight-walled construction, a character- istic already evidenced in Yarmukian sequences in Jordan (Garfinkel 1992; Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo 2009; Banning 1998). PHASE II. THE MIDDLE CHALCOLITHIC The Middle Chalcolithic phase differs from the previous ones, as its main feature is the laying out of ovens aligned on a West-East axis at the edge of the tell's slope. Covering the extension of three excavated squares (namely M42/43 and M/ N44), the seven recovered ovens are placed directly above the Paléorient, vol. 41.1, p. 153-176 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2015</page><page sequence="10">162 M. GODON, J.S. BALDI, G. CHANEM, J.J. IBÁÑEZ and F. BRAEMER PPNB/Late Neolithic phase. No specific structuring ground- layout was made as their foundation, consequently a large amount of ashes infiltrated into the Late Neolithic phase fill. Their complete elevation is destroyed by the latest occupa- tion phase. However, the concavity of some of the largest oven walls as well as collapsed stones and rubefied clayish masonry parts inside them, point to a slow-burning type of ashy layers, thus suggesting an ogival type of combustion vault (fig. 13). The micro-stratigraphy of ash deposits inside the oven shows several utilisation phases punctuated by rainy events that formed crusty layers of ashes outside and even inside the ovens: evidence of periods when they were left open. Furthermore, evidence of rebuilding is attested, especially in one of the ovens (structures M42- US19) where the rebuilding was carried out to match the reuse and the raising of an earlier structure established during the Early Chalcolithic. The small excavated area does not afford a clear under- standing of the relationship between households and ovens. Still, in square M/N44, the Early Chalcolithic house with its pillar-frame door was still in use during the Middle Chalcolithic, located very close to the oven area. Badly destroyed paved platforms laid out at the back of the ovens may indicate a late use stage, including more elaborate facili- ties that are probably related to cooking activities. Indeed, the seemingly slow burning attested by the ashes and the lack of wood charcoal among the evacuated ashes suggests the hypothesis of cooking the food on a dry dung hearth. Those questions will receive further attention by proceeding to the ash samples and faunai analyses. To prevent the destruction of such an interesting example of settlement pattern and social organisation, the ovens were not removed but, instead, wrapped in geotextile before backfilling squares M43 and M/ N44. PHASE I. THE LATE CHALCOLITHIC The Late Chalcolithic layer is the last preserved occupa- tion on Qarassa northern terrace. Well-preserved in squares M41 and M42, only traces of architecture were found in the rest of the excavated area. This phase witnessed the end of the Middle Chalcolithic oven use. They were all filled with gravel and stones, and a stony layer embedded in clayey sediment covers the whole kiln area. In trench M41, a first Late Chalcolithic structure (US-3 sub-phase 1.2) was built directly on the colluvial fill piled up inside the PPNB structure. To ensure the wall's stability, some of this unstable ground was strengthened by stony fill. The inner floor was made of a compacted clayey soil. A second building phase (US-3 sub-phase 1.1) using the previous one's eastern wall as a foundation extends to the north, gaining on the tell slope by leaning on the remains of the PPNB structure. Considering the massive construction of the walls, with up to three rows of stones, the breakdown of this structure's northern side by sliding down the slope is not surprising as such a heavy construction lacks evidence of stronger foundations. It created an increased risk of subsidence for the wall at the slope's edge (fig. 14). Going eastward in trenches M42 and L42, a less mas- sive structure contemporary with sub-phase LI in M41, constructed with two rows of medium-sized stones, shared a similar fate at its northern side by settling down in the slope, its wall collapsing while loose stones spread downwards. The very light foundations a thin layer of small stones covering the rather unstable colluvial sediment combined with erosion processes, culminated in its demise. Just beneath the terrace surface, some flagstones preserved from the recent agricul- tural activities attest to the presence of a flat pavement cover- ing the 5 m2 inner space of the structure. The same can be said for the remains characterising the Late Chalcolithic in trenches M43 and M/N44, unfortunately in a very bad state of preservation. These Late Chalcolithic levels were better preserved a few centimetres beneath the surface on the top of the terrace. They were excavated over 100 m2 in squares Q41/R41/R42/ R43. The major structure, destroyed to the west, comprises at least two rectangular rooms with very well made cobble floors (1.7 X 3.7 m and 2.2 x over 5 m) connected by a smaller trap- ezoidal room. It seems that the outer structure's limit, marked by a thick double-row stone wall, is rounded. The western room has double row stone walls and the eastern one a single row stone wall. If we have here a part of a regular struc- ture, it is possible to hypothesize a circular or polygonal outer wall approximately 20 to 35 m in diameter, bordering six to eight broad, rectangular rooms, perhaps around a large inte- rior courtyard. Open-air floors were partly destroyed and it was not possible to connect stratigraphically the three flimsy western structures with each other or with the major eastern one. The rounded wall on the western limit of square Q41 belongs perhaps to an apsidal house built in the last occupa- tional period. The other two walls and their floors (fig. 15) are possibly an intermediate occupational layer (Nicolle and Braemer 2012). The last Phase I settlement is a village built on the upper terrace.

THE POTTERY ANALYSES: TOWARDS A CHRONO-CULTURAL DEFINITION TECHNOLOGICAL PROCESSES The ceramic corpus from the northern terrace and upper terrace excavations was analyzed during the 2010 season and although further technological investigations are planned, this preliminary study has already shed light on the cultural net- works in which Qarassa participated. Nearly 12,000 sherds were analysed, some 18% from Phase IV; 30% from Phase III, 23% from Phase II and 29% from Phase I, resulting in a fairly well-balanced corpus. Furthermore, some 330 sherds from the layers disturbed by erosion processes were also analysed, supporting some tech- nological observations made for undisturbed layers. In the analysis of the ceramic materials from Qarassa North Tell, all sequences of the chaîne opératoire have been examined through a technical approach in order to broaden the archaeological perspective. The descriptive analysis of the sherds encompasses all stages of the manufacturing process and highlights different traditions corresponding to different producer groups (Roux and Courty 2005 and 2007). The first stage of the study consists of distinguishing technical groups and their variants based on recurrent combinations of 'macro- traces' resulting from building methods. Four different techni- cal groups are identified: - shaping a small mound of clay by beating it; - hollowing-out a lump and pinching and stretching; - overlapping coil building (4.5 or 2.5 cm thick); - wheel-coiling methods. Some evidence for slab-building and the apparent use of a beater for shaping were recorded but, again, not in sufficient quantities or a clear enough stratigraphie context to be of more help concerning the development of technical traditions as well as cultural traditions.

A few lights against a dark background 165 In a second stage, within the four above technical groups, all the sherds were classified according to their pétrographie characteristics. Fine mass and non-plastic inclusion analy- ses enabled the identification of three main pétrographie macro-groups: - A group: yellowish-beige fabrics, with vegetal and min- eral inclusions (mainly basalt, sub-angular calcite and ferruginous particles); - B group: orange-red and brownish mineral fabrics with substantial quantities of ferruginous inclusions; - C group: orange-reddish fabrics with small vegetal and mineral inclusions (basalt, limestone) and coal particles. According to preliminary environmental studies, it is likely that the clays involved were found in the near vicinity of the site. Natural basalt inclusions are a good signature of the Leja plateau while the tiny sediment agglomerates (probably carbonate from basalt erosion) are present in the palaeolake sediments. Ferruginous inclusions are not a surprise in basaltic contexts and are probably a result of ferrite oxidation while firing. In reference to fabrics, which is a rather limited way of merging two parameters at both ends of the chaîne opéra- toire (Godon 2012), we obviously stress that the colour dif- ferentiations from yellowish-beige to orange reddish fabrics do not result from a conscious choice but are determined by the natural amount of ferruginous elements in the selected clays as well as the firing time and temperature curves. From our first observations, we can only say that a large part of the recovered sherds present core reduction while the surfaces are oxidized. These point to two general conclusions about firing methods at Qarassa: 1) firing was done in oxidizing atmospheres; there was no attempt to control any reductive firing; 2) firings prob- ably reached their upper temperatures quickly, without main- taining this upper stage very long, avoiding a disappearance of the organic carbon at the core of the pottery walls created by the firing of organic tempers. The decrease in temperature was fast enough to avoid complete oxidation of the sherd's core. The third and concluding stage of the analysis consisted in the morphological and stylistic classification of the sherds within each group. The sorting of all these aspects enables the recognition of some regional parallels and cultural developments. The presen- tation of an exhaustive typology combined with stratigraphie details is an ongoing work. However, the available ceramic materials and current stratigraphie evidence provide relevant information about the Neolithic - Chalcolithic transition and the development of the local Chalcolithic culture. PHASE IV, LATE NEOLITHIC POTTERY Phase IV is characterized by a large amount of straight and curved bowls (fig. 16: 3), short-necked and holemouth jars, pithoi with horizontal handles or knobs, and squat basins. Among bases, flattened examples are the majority, but chalices (fig. 16: 5) and some rare disc types are also documented. The parallels with the Yarmukian assemblages of Munhata 2b, 'Ain Rehub, esh-Shallaf and Sha'ar Hagolan (Gopher 1995; Garfinkel 1999: 16-67; Bastert et al. 1999; Bienert and Vieweger 2000; Muheisen et al. 1988) are evi- dent. The so-called "Sha'ar Hagolan jars" are well documented and about 10% of the sherds are red slipped and burnished. Reddish paint is often present on incised samples with hori- zontal, oblique and herring-bone patterns organized in bands (fig. 16: 1-2). Generally, in this phase, the pottery typology of Qarassa displays important similarities with the 'classical' Yarmukian inventory (Garfinkel 1993 and 1999a). Clear paral- lels with Jebel Abu Thawwab, 'Ain Ghazal, Tel Qiri (Hazorea), Hamadiya, Wadi Shu'eib, Tell el-Farah North, Tel Qishion and Megiddo indicate that Late Neolithic Qarassa was well inte- grated into a system of cultural exchanges between Yarmukian sites in the coastal area, Northern-Central Jordan and Israel (Obeidat 1996; Kafafi 1993 and 2001; Rollefson 1993; Anati et al. 1973; Tsori 1958; Simmons et al. 1989; de Vaux and Steve 1947; Arnon and Amiran 1981; Shipton 1939: 44-46). At the same time, some features seem peculiar. Yarmukian figurines, goblets, small pots and some types of large jars are absent, as well are zigzag incisions (Garfinkel and Miller 2002: 92-96). On the other hand, painted cups with cross or lozenge motifs (fig. 16: 3) and some miniature hole-mouth jars have no strict parallels in the area. The small area excavated for the Late Neolithic phase does not allow general conclusions, but it seems already that many symbolic aspects of the Yarmukian culture are absent from Qarassa North Tell: neither male cylindrical images nor peb- ble-incised and anthropomorphic figurines, ceramics seem to be the most evident cultural connection between Tell Qarassa and 'classical' Yarmukian sites such as Munhata 2b and Sha'ar Hagolan. In a similar context, the absence of mugs with large handles or spoons (respectively types C3 and A3 in Garfinkel 1993) could be considered significant on functional basis, indi- cating different food-consumption habits. Therefore it is possible to suggest that Qarassa represents a 'variant' of the Yarmukian culture, as argued by Gopher (1995) and Garfinkel (1999) for other assemblages including some distinctive features in Lebanon and Southern Jordan.

BALDI, G. Ghanem, J.J. IBÁÑEZ and F. BRAEMER evolutionary tendencies are clear: hole-mouth jars with pinched raised rims are very rare, while simple and rounded rims form the majority (fig. 17: 5), and bases are increasingly elaborate (about 30% disc bases as in fig. 17: 6, and pedes- tals, convex and annular examples, even if 50% are flat as in fig. 17: 3). The comparison with some Wadi Rabah "norma- tive sites" (Munhata 2a, Nahal Beset I, Tel Te'o, Abu Zureiq, Al-Basatîn, Tabaqat al-Bûma) (Garfinkel 1992; Gopher et al. 1992; Sadeh and Eisenberg 2001; Garfinkel, Matskevich 2002; Anati et al. 1973; Banning 2007; Banning et al. 2005; 2010 and 1996) shows that in this phase Qarassa contacts were oriented towards Northern Israel and Jordan. Nevertheless, as observed in the previous phase, the assemblage of Qarassa represents a regional variant of the Wadi Rabah culture in its broader definition. If Wadi Rabah's long-distance relationships with other cultural entities have been largely demonstrated, its territorial diffusion between Jordan, Lebanese Beqa'a and Israeli southern coastal plains (Rosenberg and van den Brink 2005; Copeland 1969) allows the identification of various local specificities. In the Qarassa assemblage such a noteworthy character as the large diffusion of slipped and burnished pottery is not necessarily a Wadi Rabah trait, but rather a long-standing tradition attested in pre- vious and later phases, as demonstrated for other sites in the Southern Levant.7 Moreover, this assemblage does not include some typical Wadi Rabah characters, like pebble-impressed wares, triangular-profile pithos rims and, above all, bow-rim jars. Therefore, it seems reasonable to ascribe this phase at Qarassa to a local version of the Wadi Rabah complex, on the same level as other variants like Jericho VIII (PNB),8 Abu Hamid I9 and Byblos "Néolithique moyen".10 Beyond closest sites in Southern Syria (table 2), some important similarities exist with the Hula valley assemblages. In particular, thumb-nail impressions, red slipped and punc- tuated incisions characterize the Wadi Rabah occupations at Beisamoun (Rosenberg et al. 2006: Fig. 4.2-4), Hagoshrim Level 4 (Rosenberg et al. 2010: Fig. 6 [parallels with stone and chlorite vessels as in fig. 11. A-E and with pottery]; Getzov 7. Kerner 2001: 111-113; Lovell et al. 2007: 63, 74. Other occurrences at Qarassa can be assigned to long-lived traditions: for instance, a bowl with internal knob (PI. 2.4) is a type also recognizable in later periods and distant areas (the Besorian assemblage of Grar; Gilead and Goren 1995: Fig. 4.4, 3-5). 8. See Kenyon and Holland (1982 and 1983) for the Jericho assemblage, and Gophna and Sadeh (1988-1989: 20) for the identification of a Wadi Rabah variant at Jericho VIII. 9. See Lovell et al. (1997) and the considerations about the chronology of Abu Hamid in Banning (2007: 89-90). 10. According to the terminology of Dunand (1973). 1999) and Tel Te'o (Sadeh and Eisenberg 2001, with pottery considered as 'normative' Wadi Rabah). Within the Wadi Rabah entity, the Hula Valley Basin represents an homoge- neous cultural area, with which Southern Syria had even closer ties than with the Beqa'a (Copeland 1969). But, as in the precedent phase, Tell Qarassa seems to belong to a discrete cultural entity devoid of certain Wadi Rabah typical traits. Bow-rim jars account for 20-31% of the necked jars in Tel Te'o Levels X-VIII, while 'weave-combing' pattern (Garfinkel's type 5) is largely attested in Hagoshrim and the whole Hula Valley as a type fossil shared with the larger Wadi Rabah hori- zon. In this sense, the Hula Valley settlements may have played a role in bridging the northern Early Chalcolithic sites with the southern centres of this cultural entity (as Wadi Rabah itself and Jericho) through the Jezreel Valley and Tel Qiri (Anati et al. 1973; Baruch 1987). Compared with this area, as well as with western Galilean sites as Tel Kabri (Kempiński 2002) and Nahal Beset I, Qarassa North Tell presents more generic parallels. PHASES II AND I, FROM MIDDLE CHALCOLITHIC TO TERMINAL CHALCOLITHIC The two upper phases are characterized by clear continuity in the ceramic repertoire. Red slipped and burnished potter- ies decreased in number and completely disappeared toward the end of Phase I, a trend in pottery style largely observed so far for the Terminal Chalcolithic (Lovell 2001; Lovell et al. 2007). Handles are vertical (fig. 18: 6), sometimes indented or punctate. The general tendency to morphological differen- tiation affects both bases (low and high pedestals, disc, annu- lar, rounded bottoms; the flat ones are a minority) and rims (simple, rounded, pinched, bevelled and sometimes impressed or incised on the lips). Basins, hole-mouth jars and large bowls often have plastically applied bands and rounded knobs or little triangular pierced lugs. Concerning decoration, some exam- ples of red-painted bands are documented among bowls, while thumb-impressed and 'spatula-indented' incisions (fig. 18: 2) are widely attested (Artin 2009: Fig. 58C; Commenge 2005: Fig. 10.18). A peculiar type of straight-sided bowl, manufac- tured by a coiling technique (Roux and Courty 1997 and 1998) (fig. 18: I),11 appeared at Qarassa during Phase II, provid- ing a good reference for Middle Chalcolithic occupation, but throughout Phase I (at the peak of its expansion), in the Late 11. These bowls, known from every Chalcolithic site all over the Southern Levant, are the most diffused "type fossil" for this phase.

At the same time, despite some differences, the parallels with the Chalcolithic Golan (Epstein 1998: 161-162) and the "Néolithique recent - Énéolithique" phases at Byblos (Dunand 1973) indicate the quite local and specific character of the Southern Syrian Chalcolithic, as confirmed by similarities with the published materials from Tell el-Khazzami (ca 25 km south-east of Damascus).12 The links with Central and Northern Levant seem to become increasingly significant in the Terminal Chalcolithic. In fact, in the later occupation of Qarassa North Tell (Area 3), some classi- cal Ghassulian types (such as jars with rims sharply angled on the interior side) (Lovell 2001: Fig. 4.39.5; Kafafi 2001: Fig. 39.90) are found alongside the first appearance of the so-called Grey 12. A substantial quantity of red slipped pottery, as well as rope-decorated shapes and spouted bowls, represents the most evident similarities between Chalcolithic Qarassa and Tell el-Khazzami (de Contenson 1968). Ware (Kafafi 2001: 19), and some samples of large hammerhead bowls, typical of the Amuq F phase (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960: Fig. 174.380, 400). This shape is specific to a pottery type produced in large number during the LC3-LC4 phase (3800- 3300 BCE) and spread among Northern Mesopotamia, Southern Anatolia and the Northern Levant (for instance at Zeytinlibahçe, Hacinebi B1 or Tell Brak TW17-16: Balossi Restelli 2006; Pollock and Coursey 1995; Pearce 2000; Oates and Oates 1993). Their early presence in a central Levantine site like Tell Qarassa could stress some indirect relations between Mesopotamia and the Levant since the first half of the 4th millennium. CONCLUSION In the chronological and terminological confusion of the Late Neolithic - Chalcolithic periods in the Southern Levant (Banning 2002), the first seasons at Qarassa North may offer Paléorient, vol. 41.1, p. 153-176 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2015</page><page sequence="19">Qarassa North Tell, Southern Syria: The Pottery Neolithic and Chalcolithic sequence. A few lights against a dark background 171 a somewhat limited contribution to clarity. Qarassa provides new data about Southern Syria between the 7th and 4th mil- lennia and its regional relations, although the archaeological and material data need more thorough analysis beyond this preliminary study. In this sense, the proposed relative chro- nology (table 2) has a provisional and controversial character. In particular, the assemblage available from Qarassa seems to support a reassessment13 of the sequences of Abu Hamid and Teleilat Ghassul. Abu Hamid phase II and Ghassul phases G-F, previously considered 'Early Chalcolithic' and associated with the Wadi Rabah complex, can probably be ascribed to the Middle Chalcolithic (Qarassa North Tell, Phase II). In this sense, the analysis of the technical features of the ceramic assemblage is fundamental. The technical evolu- tion at Qarassa North shows a first rupture between the Late Neolithic and Early Chalcolithic with the disappearance of the shaping technique by hammering a lump of clay. At the same 13. As proposed by Banning (2007). time, beneath the veneer of strong continuity between the Late Neolithic and Middle Chalcolithic, ceramic fabrics are submit- ted to a slow process of selection, with a constant decrease of the 'A group' in favour of the ferruginous 'B group'. These same heralds of a specialization process are visible at a mor- phological level, where one can observe a long tendency towards regionalization. During the Pottery Neolithic, Qarassa was part of the Yarmukian cultural complex. But from the Early Chalcolithic onward, local specificities become increas- ingly important. The relationship with the Wadi Rabah com- plex is undeniable, but the main links seem to be with Byblos "Néolithique moyen", Lebanese Beqa'a and LN3-5 phases of the Wadi Ziqlab assemblages (Dunand 1973; Copeland 1969; Kirkbride 1969; Banning et al. 2005; 2010 and 1996; Banning 2007). In the same way, the typological continuity during the Middle Chalcolithic comes with the decline in ancient tradi- tions (such as red slipped and burnished pottery).

GODON, J.S. BALDI, G. CHANEM, J.J. IBÁÑEZ and F. BRAEMER the middle of the 5th millennium BCE. The predominance of the B fabrics became more noteworthy, while the ceramic paste of the 'C group' is associated with specific culinary vessels (pots with flattened bases and smoothing traces and large shallow bowls: fig. 16: 7). Moreover, the overlapping coils 4.5 cm thick disappeared and the wheel-coiling tech- nique emerged as a building method exclusively reserved for 'V-shaped' bowls and miniature pots. This very innovative step marks a discontinuity in terms of quantity of production (that becomes serial for some shapes) and quality. It indicates a somewhat hierarchical organization of production, with a sub- stantial decrease in the number of part-time specialists.14 In this period, Qarassa belonged to the general Chalcolithic koine of the Southern Levant but the outcomes of the regionalization process are visible and tally with the material culture of Byblos "Énéolithique ancien", Tell el-Khazzami and the Golan. Indeed, the regionalization process is not associated with cultural isolation. On the contrary, it seems to express a reor- ganization of the social links on specific geographical bases while, on the other hand, long-distance relations were becoming more and more frequent. In fact, if for the Wadi Rabah phase "trade between centres" or "down the line trade" have been sug- gested (Rosenberg et al. 2010: 291), the appearance of jars and hammerhead bowls with typical Amuq shapes at the end of the Chalcolithic clearly indicates indirect (but recurrent) contacts between different groups and technical borrowings between potters of distinct traditions. The Late Chalcolithic emergence of ceramic provinces (as in Southern Syria between Qarassa and Tell el-Khazzami, or the Ghassulian in Southern Jordan Valley and the Negev sites around Beer Sheva) seems to be the expres- sion of social entities with strong locally-based cultural links and increasingly important long-distance exchanges.15 The Qarassa excavations shed new light on poorly known periods and allow the construction of a first general frame- work for the Southern Levant during the Pottery Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods extended to Southern Syria. They allow the definition of a new regional cultural entity strongly con- nected to those in the Southern Levant, and demonstrate the existence of exchange links with Northern Levant from the end of the 5th millennium onward. They show the existence of long-lasting occupied sites contrasting with the dominant picture of temporary or short-term occupied settlements that emerge from the Jawlan and Hawran surveys. The transition 14. The emergence of some kind of specialization is also stressed by Bourke (2007: 22), Lovell (2001: 50) and Kerner (1997). 15.

It is thus a new attestation of the hiatus that characterizes the end of the Chalcolithic in the Southern Levant (Braun and Roux 2013). The Qarassa sequence gives a new picture of the long-term history of the region.
