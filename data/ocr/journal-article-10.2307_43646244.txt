<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME ASPECTS OF THE GODS IN THE ILIAD by M. M. Willcock There is so much to be said about the gods in Homer - factual information, archaeology and anthropology, hints of religion and the beginnings of moral standards, comedy and light relief on Olympos, that books and articles about the gods often stop short of considering the meaning of divine activity. For example, a recent paperback by Professor Severyns, Les Dieux d'Homère , 1 has nothing to say about the implications of this subject, and confines itself to the external facts about the gods as they appear in the Iliad. I am one of those whose interest in Homer centres on the eighth century, not the twelfth. Just as the decipherment of the Mycenaean tablets, and the discussion of Aias' great shield or the boar's tusk helmet, seem to me proper subjects for research, but of minor importance to the understanding of the Iliad, so the antiquarian features of the gods, their cult names and so on, are of less significance in my eyes than the way Homer uses the gods in his story. Nor am I here concerned with the Odyssey; there is of course a divine machinery there, with Athene and Poseidon, and for a while Helios, interfering and to some extent directing the plot. But the Odyssey in this respect is not very different from the Aeneid (in which Juno and Venus respectively oppose and assist the Trojans in their quest), except perhaps that the gods are more convincing in the more primitive poem.2 In the Iliad we may see a subtlety in the acti- vities of the gods which is greater than what happens in the Odyssey; and far greater than what happens in the Aeneid. Professor Lesky, in his admirable Göttliche und menschliche Motivation im homerischen Epos^ discusses the common situation when a particular human action seems to be separately motivated by a god as well as by the human being. This is not quite my subject, although I shall be touching on the fringes of it; I am rather concerned with occasions where the gods are described as acting independently on the human plane, as if they were another kind of humans, while nevertheless retaining their divinity. HEKTOR AND POLITES We are at the climax of the Iliad, the single combat between Achilleus the invincible hero of the Greeks and Hektor the defender of Troy, to whom we have become deeply sympathetic as a result of his strenuous efforts in the battle and our knowledge of the loss facing Andromache and the baby. We would surely expect a poet telling a tale of war to make of this an epic struggle - the two great heroes, each the mightiest of his countrymen, laying into each other like a pair of heavyweights for hours on end, while the armies stood and watched and waited, until in the end Achilleus came victorious, and Hektor died gloriously, having achieved his greatest triumph in</page><page sequence="2">this defeat. This is how Quintus of Smyrna portrays the fight between Achilleus and Memnon in the second book of the Posthomerica. 4 All day long the noise of battle rolled, and still those two fought on, amid the corpses and the blood, etc., etc. The Iliad story is nothing like that at all. The poet has not chosen a trial of strength, ending with the victory of the stronger, but apparently a deception, a trick. Hektor stops running round the walls of Troy, and Athene appears to him in the guise of his brother Deiphobos, so that she may trick him into standing and facing Achilleus. Hektor is pleased with his brother. Then the fight starts. They both throw their spears without effect; but Athene secretly and supernaturally returns Achilleus' spear to him, so that when Hektor rushes on him with his sword in the accepted way Achilleus is able to pick him off with no more effort or danger than a good shot would have in picking off a charging tiger. This action of Athene has been, consciously or subconsciously, a stumbling block to many modern readers of the Iliad. It seems so unsporting; two against one. Hektor seems more like a victim of murder or assassination than a brave and glorious hero. The American scholar James Duffy, writing just before the war, brought this feeling out into the open, when he described Athene's return of the spear to Achilleus as "one of the most repulsive acts in the poems". 5 What is more, it spoils what would otherwise in many cases be a plausible explanation of Athene's interference in the action of the Iliad. When she comes down in Book I to stop Achil- leus from drawing his sword and killing Agamemnon,6 we might say that this is his own good sense and self-control restraining him. We would be willing to allow Homer to personalize the good sense of Achilleus to the extent of saying that Athene took him by the hair, provided she is not visible to anyone other than Achilleus. Similarly, her encouragement to Odysseus to stop the run for the ships, her persuasion of Pandaros to break the truce by shooting at Mene- laos, her encouragement of Diomedes at two points in his aristeia , her appearance to him in Book X to tell him that it is time for him and Odysseus to get back to safety from the Trojan camp in the night7 - all these may be quite easily explained as manners of speaking, i.e. Athene is described as persuading people to do things which they might perfectly properly be described as doing on their own account. We could in these cases say that Athene is an exter - nalization of an inner motivation . And that is all right so long as she does not do anything physical. We permit her to pull Achilleus' hair, because all that is involved there is a sensa- tion on his part. But when she returns his spear to him in Book XXII, this is not the exter- nalization of an inner motivation; it is a physical action as if she were a human helper supporting Achilleus - a bit more than human perhaps, but acting on the human plane. And this is where we begin to feel shocked. Two immediate lessons are to be learned from this passage: the poet has chosen not to make the climax of his epic a trial of strength, and the actions of the gods cannot always be explained away. My second example is more complicated, but less significant to the story, than the first. After the Greek Catalogue of Ships in Book II, the poet wishes to switch to the Trojan Cata- logue. So the narrative changes over to the Trojan side; and the introduction is made as follows. The Trojans are in assembly. They have left the fleet Polites, son of Priam, on a hillock in the plain, with strict instructions to come hot-foot to them with the news when the Greeks are on the march. Does he come? No. Iris comes to the Trojan assembly "in the likeness of Polites", and warns Hektor that it is time to get the army drawn up in its contin- gents;8 and thus an opportunity is given for the Trojan Catalogue. Now this is difficult to understand, and has been the subject of considerable discussion recently. 9 What exactly does the poet mean when he says that Iris, the messenger goddess, acts in the likeness of Polites, bringing a message which Polites was in fact specifically under instructions to bring? To put it simply, are we to understand that it really was a goddess who came to the assembly, as Homer directly tells us it was, in which case what was Polites doing? Why did he not come himself to give the news that the Greeks were on the move? Or are we to understand that it 2</page><page sequence="3">was really Polites who came, but for some reason the poet can describe this as being Iris in the likeness of Polites? And if we can offer a rational explanation like that - that "Iris in the likeness of Polites" is merely a form of words for Polites himself - what implication has that for other statements about the gods' behaviour in the Iliad? I shall return to both these problems later: what are we to make of Athene's return of Achil- leus' spear to him in XXII? and what are we to make of the statement that Iris came to the Trojan assembly "in the likeness of Polites"? GIFTS OF THE GODS Before we look at particular examples of the relations of gods and men in the Iliad, let me try to define a general pattern. The participation of gods in human activity may be thought of as taking place over a range of meaning between two extremes. At one end is the use of the god's name in a purely allegorical way, or even as a mere figure of speech. When Hephaistos is used for fire, or Ares for war (for example, when Hektor says that he knows well how to tread the measures of Ares), there is no religious implication, nor is the individuality of a particular god in any sense under consideration; one is simply using the name of the god for the power or function which is ascribed to him. 10 This is not much more than a manner of speaking. At the other end of the scale are occasions when a god acts as a totally independent agent in the human sphere, anthropomorphic, just like a human being and with human motives; often doing something completely unconnected with the particular power or function of that god. For example, when Aphrodite spirits Paris away in Book III, or Poseidon does the same for Aineias in Book XX, they are acting with superhuman strength, but their particular functions of love and the sea (or earthquakes) are not relevant to their actions. It is a question of divine favour to an individual. Their actions in this field are like those of the comic strip hero Superman - stronger than ordinary humans, and not earthbound, but otherwise not very different from the rest of us. They move Aineias or Paris much as we might move a piece at chess. At this end of the scale, the gods are little more than an aid to the plot; they are the divine machinery; their activity has as its aim the fulfilment of the Iliad story; there is little religious feeling about them. This is how individual gods act in later epics - to some extent in the Odyssey, and absolutely in the Aeneid. The two extremes are the function without the god and the god without the function. But most divine action in the Iliad falls somewhere between the two; and there in the middle, where the god simultaneously retains his function and acts in some sense as an individual, one may indeed get some mystical, or spiritual, or religious, feeling about the gods in their dealings with men. To begin the examples, let us consider a particular class of statements where it is said that such and such a thing (often a weapon or a piece of armour) was a gift to an individual from a god. The first case is that of Pandaros' bow, and here a problem appears. In Book II, in the relevant entry in the Catalogue of Ships, it is stated that Pandaros' bow (which in fact is going to play an important part in the plot of the Iliad) was given to him by Apollo. 11 In Book IV, when he is about to use his bow, the poet tells us at some length how Pandaros obtained the bow by shooting an ibex and handing over the horns to a bow-maker. 12 How do we explain an apparent inconsistency? Was it in fact a gift of Apollo? Did Pandaros have two bows? I looked at four commentaries on the Iliad to see how they explained the difficulty. Pierron says nothing; Faesi says that the bow given by Apollo in II must have been a different bow from that described in IV, and suggests that perhaps we have a case of the conflation of two different legends (!); van Leeuwen says we cannot get away from the inconsistency, and we cannot hope to explain everything in the Iliad, and perhaps the best solution is to excise 3</page><page sequence="4">the lines in Book IV as an interpolation (!) ; Leaf, following the scholia and some earlier editors, says that when the poet states that Apollo gave Pandaros his bow, he means that Apollo gave him his skill in archery. I would go still further. I would say that "Apollo gave Pandaros his bow" does not really refer to any action on Apollo's part at all; the words mean "Pandaros was an outstandingly successful archer". Apollo was the god of archery. He is also said to have given Teukros his bow (XV. 441). And one remembers the death of Achilleus - shot by "Paris and Apollo" at the Skaian gate. How do we picture that? Who pulled the bowstring? We are in trouble if we imagine Apollo as an anthropomorphic god in these cases; it is clearly a way of saying that a man is a successful archer, to say that he has the help of Apollo, or his bow is the gift of Apollo. This in fact is near one extreme of divine activity as defined earlier, where the god stands for his function; but it is not quite the same as Hephaistos 11 fire, because here we are dealing with human qualities and human achievements, and belief in the god does play a part. As well as being the god of archery, Apollo was the god of prophecy; at 1.72 we read that Phoibos Apollo gave Kalchas his skill in prophecy. Similarly, the poet tells us that Artemis herself taught Skamandrios (a hunter, killed by Menelaos at V.51) to shoot wild beasts. It makes the point clearly enough, I think, to say that the statements that Apollo gave Kalchas the art of prophecy, and that Artemis taught Skamandrios the skills of hunting, are statements about Kalchas and Skamandrios, not about Apollo and Artemis. So there is no inconsistency between the statement in II that Apollo himself gave Pandaros his bow, and that in IV that it was made for him by a mortal bowyer. And when we hear that the armour of Areithoos was given him by Ares, that the breastplate of Diomedes was made for him by Hephaistos, or that the helmet of Hektor was provided for him by Apollo, 13 we shall not talk about a pre-homeric legend, or think of those gifts in the same way as we think of the breastplate that Kinyras sent to Agamemnon.14 In the last case there is a simple material gift, from a human donor to a human recipient; in the others, the statement that the piece of armour is the gift of a god is a qualitative statement about the armour or the person wearing it.15 APHRODITE Having related Apollo's 'gift' to Pandaros to the particular function of Apollo (archery), I turn to the functions of three other gods - Aphrodite, Ares and Athene. Aphrodite's function in human life is well known. Three occasions where her gifts or support are mentioned in the Iliad come to mind. When Hektor, with a typical elder brother's scorn for his weaker younger brother, abuses Paris at the beginning of Book III, calling him "beautiful to look at" and "mad about women", Paris replies, "Do not blame me for the gifts of Aphrodite; one should not abrogate the gifts of a god." 16 Here Paris is talking language that we understand, without even bothering to think that it is metaphorical, not literal. To say that beauty is the gift of Aphrodite seems quite natural to us, and we do not insist that Aphrodite in person gave a particular present to Paris. The example is very parallel to that of Apollo himself giving Pandaros his bow. The second example of a gift of Aphrodite is more moving, because it brings her into a higher kind of relationship than the selfishness of Paris and Helen. When Andromache ran up on to the wall like a madwoman, guessing that something had happened to Hektor, and saw his body being dragged behind Achilleus' chariot, she fainted and her complicated headdress fell to the ground. Homer mentions the various parts of her cap, including the veil "which 4</page><page sequence="5">1 7 golden Aphrodite gave to her on that day when Hektor took her from the house of Eetion". That is, on her wedding day. It would be wrong to think of that present in the same way as the present of Kinyras to Agamemnon. Surely Andromache made her own veil for her own wedding. Weaving was women's work in the house. But obviously there is an intelligible sense in saying that Aphrodite gave Andromache the veil that she wore at her wedding to Hektor. It was a love match, and the bride was beautiful. As in the case of Pandaros, because we do not believe in these gods as gods, we have a tendency to treat their gifts as if they were the gifts of another person, supernatural, but other- wise not different from the humans. We try to rationalize the gods away, to create so far as we can a purely human world. We are uncomfortable because we cannot understand; but surely this lack of full understanding is a feature of religious experience. Except for the few, who manage to reach a state of complete certainty about god, most people are in a state of uncer- tainty, believing with one part of their minds, while preserving considerable scepticism with another part. Once again, the commentators do not generally comment on Andromache's veil at all; they presumably treat the statement in the line as one of fact, and fail to understand the subtlety, and even spiritual feeling, which it contains.18 The function of Aphrodite is attraction between the sexes. If Helen were to say, 4 'It was not my fault that I went with Paris; I was persuaded by Aphrodite", she would be speaking in a way that would strike us as familiar in early Greek thought. In such a statement, Aphro- dite would be almost wholly an extemalization of part of Helen's personality; as in the case of ÖCTT1 (delusion) , they can say, "It was not my fault; a force over which I have no control constrained me." 19 Not in fact that such a disclaimer lessened an individual's responsibility for the results of his or her actions. Humans are not thought of as puppets, even though they ascribe their motivation to something outside themselves. We cannot, however, go the whole way, and say that such statements are simply allegorical; for Homer uses language which shows that he himself treats the external motivating agent as a real agent, not just a figure of speech. This is the basic difficulty. Consider the scene between Aphrodite and Helen at the end of Book III. Here it is not a question of gifts of Aphrodite, but of her support and favour. Paris has been whisked away to safety in his own bedroom. Aphrodite goes to the wall to tell Helen to come to her husband. Helen at first refuses, whereon Aphrodite turns angry and menacing. The disturbing effectiveness of this scene is caused by our realization that Aphrodite is simul- taneously two things - the force of sexual attraction and a wilful goddess. She is both a part of Helen's personality and a being quite independent of Helen. These are the two extremes mentioned above - the force and the independent god. The scene is difficult and uncomfortable for us because in this case the two aspects are not integrated, but seem to be working against each other. ARES In the cases noticed so far, the poet describes certain supposed actions of the gods as if they were literally and factually true. But as it is the gods who are in question, we may come to the opinion that their actions are true on a different level of reality from that of ordinary human life. Consider Ares, god of killing. Many of the gods take part in the battle in the Iliad; do any of them ever personally kill a human opponent? No; such behaviour would seem quite wrong; they spend their time encouraging those whom they favour, and frightening their opponents; they put fresh strength into some shepherd of the people, or throw a thunderbolt in front of an aggressive Diomedes. But they do not personally kill a member of the other side, with one significant exception. On one occasion one god is described as stripping the body of somebody he has just killed; and of course it is Ares (V. 842). It is obvious that Ares can 5</page><page sequence="6">be described as doing this himself, because this is his function - he is the god of killing in battle. A man may be killed "by Ares";20 this is a metaphor. It is not such a long step to the description of Ares, as an independent agent, human in shape, killing a man. It would be a much bigger step to describe Athene, Poseidon, Apollo or Hera as personally killing an opponent in battle. Apollo does of course kill by the plague in Book I ; that is part of his divine function. 21 At the beginning of the section of the battle in Book V which culminates with the unique description of Ares himself having killed a human, the Trojans had begun to enjoy a period of success and to drive back the Greeks. Such a reversal of the natural course of events is not to be understood without the help of a god, and what better god than Ares? So the poet brings the situation into the open, and tells us clearly how Apollo urged Ares to enter the battle and help the Trojans against Diomedes and the Greeks.22 Ares did this, and pressed the Greeks back. Diomedes could tell, because his vision had been clarified by Athene, that a god was helping Hektor; and therefore he advised the Greeks to give way slowly. And then the poet can say, "Whom first and whom last did Hektor and Ares kill?"23 Hektor and Ares, just in the same sense as Paris and Apollo killed Achilleus at the Skaian gate. The presence of Ares is a deduction from Hektor' s successful attack; but it is a deduction which, from the poet, becomes a statement of fact. So, at the risk of boring the reader by repetition, I summarize. The gods' participation in human affairs, in those cases which fall between the two extremes of mere figure of speech and a totally independent agent, will relate to their particular function, and will be more or less metaphorical, and even psychological. But the metaphor, as the scene is described by Homer, sometimes spills over into the real world, and the god shows his presence by a physical action which is not explicable as a metaphor. Then, for a believer, the göd is shown to be fully present in his own person, performing on the plane normally reserved for the humans. Metaphor and religious belief have moved into the real world; ovap has become uTrap as Pindar said. 24 ATHENE We are close to an explanation of Athene's return of the spear to Achilleus. But what is the function of Athene? What in her case is parallel to sexual attraction for Aphrodite, and killing for Ares? The answer, at least in the Iliad, is winning , success , and specifically Greek success. The Greeks believed that it is not for humans to command success; or at least, if it is, it would be very dangerous for them to think so. This is a common feature of so-called archaic thought. Their view would be that a man may strive and struggle, expending his energies with all the intelligence and skill he is endowed with; but if he wins, then that shows something more than his own efforts; it shows he is supported by a god.2^ In other words, success implies the help of a god. This is why the unexpected Trojan victory in Book V involved with it the statement that Ares in person was helping Hektor. Consequently, as Greek success is the particular function of Athene, those of the Greeks who are successful are described as being the favourites of Athene. We tend to look at the matter in a different light. We might say, "Odysseus is successful, because he has the help of Athene"; and that is how Athene herself puts it,2** and how Homer allows us to imagine. But underlying this divine assistance is a rather different attitude, "Odysseus is successful, and so he must have the help of Athene." We try to make her the agent, misled no doubt by the way the poet chooses to express himself; but in the thought of a believer, the god is not the agent, but the explanation. 22 The gods help those who. help themselves. 28 This is why the favourites of Athene are Tydeus, Diomedes, Odysseus, Achilleus - the naturally successful, the natural winners. Consider the foot race 6</page><page sequence="7">and the chariot race in Book XXIII. Athene was always helping Odysseus, as the mean Aias sourly comments.29 She helps him precisely because he is a winner. In all his actions, his prudence and determination and skill are going to bring him out on top. Therefore, with the assistance of Athene, he wins the foot race.30 In the chariot race, divine participation takes the form of Apollo making Diomedes drop his whip, Athene restoring it to him, and then breaking the pole of Eumelos' chariot.31 The dropping of the whip, and the breaking of the pole, are perfectly explicable as accidents in the race, and we may so rationalize them if we wish. The restoration of the whip to Diomedes is supernatural and not to be explained without the physical intervention of a god. Are we to say then that Athene in effect cheated , and arranged that Diomedes, who would otherwise have come second, won the race? The thought is absurd. Diomedes is simply not a person who comes second. The interference of Athene, including the magical return to him of his whip, merely achieves what would be the proper result in any case. The natural victor wins. The events of the single combat between Hektor and Achilleus must be explained in the same way. As has been said earlier, many people find it difficult to accept Athene's behaviour in tricking Hektor to stand and fight, and then restoring Achilleus' spear to him, so that he has an easy win. Many people think, consciously or subconsciously, that this is unfair to Hektor, that it is unsporting. Two against one. That is a blasphemous thought, arising out of disbelief. The god is not another human being.32 There were two people, not three, standing out there on the plain under the walls of Troy. Moreover, in our desire for a fairness that is not true to life, we so easily forget that Achilleus was bound to win. Hektor never had a chance. Achilleus was a far better fighter. Aias and Diomedes could deal with Hektor ^ -i with some ease, as is shown elsewhere in the Iliad, and probably so could Agamemnon. And Achilleus was certainly better than any of these. So he did not need the assistance of Athene at all. Indeed, it is precisely because he did not need her help that he gets it; Athene helps him because he is going to win. To that extent she is a sort of externalization, because she is a concomitant of human success. In restoring his spear, however, she is a god taking part in the human action, just exactly parallel to her restoration of Diomedes' whip to him in the chariot race. We have to believe two things at once, as religious believers do. The god is simultaneously corporeal and incorporeal, matter and spirit; her activity is simultaneously real and allegorical. 34 MOMENTS OF ENHANCED AWARENESS We now turn to another kind of divine epiphany. Human success, as I have shown, implies the help of a god. And not only the fact of success but the moment of success contains some- thing of the divine.35 This again is a feature of religious experience - a momentary flash of enlightenment or revelation. The early Greeks believed that the world is full of gods. They are an explanation, not only of success, but also of other things which are not to be explained in human terms - a storm at sea, for example, or the coming of a favourable wind to sailors who are exhausted by rowing.36 And there are other moments - of excitement, of a sudden hush in a large gathering - when a human being may have a strong impression that something super- natural is present. A ripple passes over the surface of the water in a pool, and the believers immerse themselves with all the speed they can, because it is clear to them that some divinity is at hand. 37 At Line 278 of Book II, Odysseus stands up to speak in the reconstituted assembly. Agamemnon's testing of the morale of the army has misfired, and they have taken to the ships. Only the presence of mind of Odysseus (encouraged, naturally, by Athene) has brought them back. Thersites has been publicly humiliated for his untimely freedom of speech. Odysseus stands up. There is a hush of expectancy in the throng. The poet says, "Odysseus stood up, holding the sceptre; and beside him grey-eyed Athene in the likeness of a herald ordered 7</page><page sequence="8">the people to be silent, so that both those at the front and those at the back could hear the words of Odysseus." Clearly there was a herald there. That it was Athene is a deduction from the hush and expectancy in the air. This was understood by some nineteenth century scholars;38 and is hinted at in the scholia;39 but the more recent commentators make no remark on it. We should associate Athene's appearance here with actions of hers previously discussed in this paper; she is an explanation rather than an agent.40 From Athene acting as a herald in the critical atmosphere that followed Agamemnon's dream, we turn to the goddess Iris coming to the Trojan assembly "in the likeness of Polites". The position is critical for them too. The assembly is waiting, expectant, for the news that the Greeks are on the move. The figure of Polites appears, and there is a hush. It is no wonder that the poet can describe this as the divine messenger herself in the likeness of Polites. And (interestingly) the words that Polites speaks are in part suitable to the prince and in part to the goddess.41 We cannot give a simple answer to the question "Who was it, Polites or Iris?" We can only reply that the figure was the figure of Polites, but the tension and expec- tancy in the assembly was such that the coming of the messenger seemed to have something more than human about it, and thus the poet says that Iris came in the likeness of Polites. In effect they both came, but the goddess on a different level of reality from the human.42 University of Lancaster NOTES 1 Paris, 1966. 2 The difference in the activity of the gods in the Odyssey is well expressed by M. P. Nilsson in "Götter und Psychologie bei Homer", Archiv für Religionswissenschaft 22 (1924) 367. Athene in particular is more specifically a divine patron or tutelary deity of Odysseus in the Odyssey than she is in the Iliad. 3 Heidelberg, 1961; cp. also B. Snell The Discovery of the Mind (tr.

These are of course real artifacts for the purpose of the stories, and here we move nearer to the other extreme, of the god acting in an almost wholly physical way; but it is still Hephaistos acting within his particular function, and still the fact that divine arms are made for them is a qualitative statement about Achilleus, Herakles and Memnon. 16 1 1 1. 64-5. 17 XXII. 470. 18 There is no relevant comment on Aphrodite's gift in Eustathius, nor anything at all in the scholia or any modern commentary consulted by me, except that Bothe quotes with approval the view that the gift of Aphrodite refers to the beauty of the bride, which is my sense here; and van Leeuwen speculates that the story of the gift must come from some prehomeric legend which recounted that wedding, comparable to the legend of the wedding of Peleus and Thetis (!). 19 For aTTļ see especially Agamemnon's self-justification, XIX. 86 ff.; and cp.

Griffiths has brought to my notice the proverb quoted by Plutarch " 'Eppfjs 6T^£laeXr|ÄuÔ6,, (LSJ under 'Eppfjç 1 1.4); the ripple on the surface of the pool is St John V.4. 38 Pierron quotes with approval Dübner's remark that it is because of the unnatural silence that the poet tells us it was no ordinary herald but Athene in the shape of a herald who controlled the mob. 39 1 (BT) 11.278-282. ttgõç yàp àÀAcoç fyjuxacjav, ouç TTpcórjv (11.96) svvea póyiç STrelyov Kr)puK£ç; 40 It is, I think, right to contrast with this scene Athene's acting as a herald in Od. VII 1.7 ff. There she is acting more simply, as a god who takes human form to help her favourite Odysseus (cp. n.2 above). 41 Aristarchus (£A to 11.791) objected that 796 and 802 do not suit the person of Polites, and are more proper as from the goddess. Leaf (ad loc.) added that 798 on the other hand comes better from a human warrior than a goddess, (cp. Wilamowitz 11. u. Horn. 278, Jachmann op. cit. (n.9) 110, Von der Mühll Kritisches Hypomriema 61.) 42 Elsewhere in the Iliad and Odyssey a god frequently assumes the shape of a particular human being. P. Chantraine ("Le Divin et les Dieux chez Homère" in Entretiens sur l'Antiquité Classique 1 1952 p. 61) ascribes such thoughts to human experience, in that looking back men may see that at certain important times in their lives the words of another person had a decisive influence; archaic thought would deduce from this the presence of the divine. Homer in these cases, as in the examples discussed above, actualizes the situation, and treats the gods as really and physically there, some- times showing their divinity by a particular sign or a metamorphosis on departure. 10</page></plain_text>
