<plain_text><page sequence="1">Animal Pain, God and Professor Geach R. W. K. PATERSON In Chapter 4 of his Providence and Evil (Cambridge University Press, I977) Professor Peter Geach defends the ascription of goodness to God against the objection from the existence of animal pain. Geach acknow- ledges that all animals are divinely created and under divine superinten- dence; that their sufferings are real and often excruciating; that these exemplify torments befalling the innocent; and that God, unlike 'an army commander or big business executive', is fully conversant with the detailed results of 'the main line of policy' he has adopted in his creative design. Nevertheless, according to Geach, God cannot be accused of cruelty, and indeed no amount of animal pain could tarnish God's goodness in the slightest. Geach accepts that sympathy with the sufferings of lower animals can be a virtue in human beings-but only to the degree that we 'share the nature' of those animals whose sufferings we compassionate. Thus the sufferings of 'a shark or octopus or herring' are quite improper objects of our compassion. And since, unlike men, God has no ingredient of the animal in his nature, 'only anthropomorphic imagination allows us to accuse God of cruelty' for tolerating animal pain as part of his glorious creation. Geach's choice of terminology is significant. The name he gives to the virtue which we cannot predicate of God is 'sympathy', conspicuously avoiding the terms 'compassion' (my word above) and 'pity'. Geach's motives are perfectly transparent. 'Sympathy' connotes some participation in the feelings of those whose predicament we might conceivably share, and perhaps therefore it would be 'folly or affectation' for men to try to sympathize with the travail of an octopus. Perhaps not. But clearly a man might appropriately have pity for the agony of such a creature, inclining him to do what he could to alleviate its suffering. And only a pedantic allegiance to etymology could deter us from saying that one often can and ought to have compassion for great pain suffered by animals whose nature is radically different from one's own. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines 'compassion' simply as 'pity inclining one to be helpful or merciful'. Thus the objection to theism from the existence of animal pain does not depend on the assumption that a perfectly good Creator would have 'sympathy' in the sense of 'fellow feeling' with the sufferings of animals. It depends merely on the ethical premise that the capacity of animals to i i6 Philosophy 59 I 984</page><page sequence="2">Discussion experience suffering provides the Creator with a good reason for so designing things that animals will not be caused to suffer. We need not equate pity or compassion with some passive, quasi-organic, 'feeling' characteristic. It suffices that these terms designate the mental state of any agent who judges that a good reason for avoiding some possible action is that it would cause pain to some innocent creature. Of course a Creator who pitied the sufferings of animals might have a still better reason for permitting them-for example that they were necessary evils subserving a dispro- portionately greater good. However, Geach declines to explore such possibilities. He prefers to claim that it would be 'a mere impertinence' to expect God to 'share the moral perfections proper to his creatures'. To ascribe to God the virtue of pity for animal sufferings would be as silly as to describe God as courageous or chaste. In designing the processes of nature God does not even minimize animal pain, for he simply does not count it among the intrinsic goods and evils which figure in his creative plan. If he forbids men to cause unnecessary suffering to some animals, this is entirely because of his concern for man, not because of any pity for animal suffering as such. Professor Geach's God, then, is simply indifferent to animal suffering as such. Geach denies that this indifference constitutes 'cruelty'. However, an agent who fails to judge that a good reason for avoiding some possible course of action is that it would cause pain to an innocent creature is with- out question an agent whom we would correctly describe as cruel. Com- plete indifference to the pain suffered by some innocent creature is quite certainly a form of cruelty. A being who logically could not evince courage or chastity because it was logically impossible for him to be faced by danger or sexual temptation would of course not be cowardly or unchaste. But of an agent who logically could not judge that an outcome of innocent suffering furnished a good reason for avoiding some act we should have to say, not only that he 'could not evince pity', but also (because equivalently) that he was 'pitiless'. Now because God is omnipotent and pure spirit, he cannot face danger or sexual temptation, since to face these hazards is to face them occurring to oneself. And of course God cannot be faced by suffering occurring to himself. However, since he can be faced by the innocent sufferings of his creatures, where he cannot be said to have the virtue of pity he must necessarily be said to have the vice of pitilessness or cruelty. God may be logically 'beyond' both courage and cowardice, but not 'beyond' both pity and pitilessness, for an agent who is devoid of pity is (tautologically) pitiless. In this case to lack the virtue is necessarily to have the vice. A God who acted without pity for suffering animals would be a God who acted cruelly towards animals. Cruelty is evil because pain is intrinsically bad. When we set aside all the causes, accompaniments, and consequences of someone's pain (as we at least provisionally must do, if we are to assess the relevance of his pain I 17</page><page sequence="3">Discussion to the overall moral situation), we judge that an individual's pain is in itself a definite and distinctive evil and that intense or protracted pain is in itself a very considerable evil. Self-evidently, these judgments remain true whatever the other characteristics of the individual sufferer. If it takes a massive wound to cause a shark suffering as severe as that caused to a child by a much lesser wound, this does not in the least affect the degree of intrinsic evil of their respective sufferings, which is necessarily equivalent if the degree of suffering (of course including any mental suffering) is equivalent. Thus when Geach approves human pity for animal suffering on condition that 'the Aristotelian mean is observed', he is quite wrong in supposing that observance of the mean would limit us with respect to those species whose sufferings we could rightly pity. The principle of the mean merely requires us to proportion our pity to the degree of suffering undergone, and not at all by reference to the biological species of the sufferer. Agony suffered by a mouse is a greater intrinsic evil than discomfort suffered by a child. It may indeed be difficult, perhaps impossible, for us to know what degree of pain is being experienced by a particular mouse. However, in the theodicean context our particular cognitive limitations are nothing to the point. We may not know what degree of pain is being suffered by a member of a very different species; but the point is that surely God is supposed to know. And unless Geach is prepared to claim (as he evidently is not) that the lower animals never suffer great pain, we are left with the alternatives that either God does not know that animals frequently suffer intense pain, or what it is for animals to suffer pain; or, while knowing, he does not care; or, while knowing and caring, he can do nothing about it. There can be no doubt as to which alternative Geach is committed to upholding. He does not plead any restriction of God's power to reduce animal pain; and I am sure he does not regard God as fully acquainted with the nature of physical pain as a sentient state, its distinctive horridness, but somehow (erroneously) judging it not to be an evil. Clearly, Geach's God simply does not know what it is for animals to live through this distinctive sentient state in all its horridness. It would be tempting to argue that God's ignorance in this respect would be culpable ignorance, like that of, say, a eunuch who had no pity for sexual deprivation or an extraterrestrial alien with a wholly inorganic body who had no pity for physical distress while well understanding what deprivation and distress were in general. It is noteworthy that, in his lively chapter on 'Hell', Geach portrays God as having enough understanding of what he is about to include 'a physical pain of sense' among the miseries awaiting those who reject him. However, despite inconsistencies in his account, Geach does not, I am sure, want to impugn divine goodness by maintaining that God has but does not take cognizance of animal suffering. His position i i8</page><page sequence="4">Discussion is clearly that, not being himself an animal, God cannot be expected to be cognizant of what it is to undergo purely animal torments. The objection I shall press, therefore, is the objection that unavoidable divine ignorance of the nature of animal suffering is incompatible with divine omniscience. A being is not omniscient merely because he knows everything that he can logically know. An omniscient being knows everything that is knowable. If a disembodied spirit were logically incapable of knowing what it was like to move one's limbs, he would not be omniscient even if he knew everything else knowable. A logically unavoidable deficiency is still a deficiency. Of two minds both possessing as much knowledge as they logically could, one might nevertheless know more than the other because not subject to the logical restrictions limiting possession of knowledge by the other. Both minds would be fully stocked, but the second mind would be a lesser mind. An omniscient being must know everything that anyone else knows and a great deal more besides. Now, understanding something of the intrinsic nature of animal pain is not a rare or difficult feat. A child can do it, and many animals themselves show some understanding of what other animals (sometimes of very differ- ent species) are undergoing when in pain. Someone who had no grasp whatever of animals' experience of pain would be incapable of under- standing one of the chief springs of animal action, and to such a being much animal behaviour would be a closed book. Presumably he would not understand animal pleasure either. But in that case most if not all of the springs of animal behaviour would be beyond his grasp. Can we suppose that the Creator of the dog, elephant, rat, the designer of their nervous systems, is wholly ignorant of what (pace epiphenomenalism) makes his products function as they do? Moreover, the behaviour of animal species affects the physical environ- ments in which they seek pleasant and pain-free lives. Streams are dammed, forests defoliated, hillsides pitted with burrows, patterns of vegetation altered-a terrain populated by animals can differ greatly from the same terrain unpopulated. Animals' pain-avoiding and pleasure-seeking be- haviour influences their population levels, in killing and procreation for example, and migrations can spread changes over fresh parts of the earth's surface. Thus a God without understanding of the nature of animal pain would have at best an imperfect understanding of the past, present, and future states of the world he had created. How could 'omniscience' be ascribed to such a Creator? Man too is an animal. (This is why, for Geach, men may sometimes rightly sympathize with animal sufferings.) It would seem to follow that God logically cannot compassionate the physical sufferings of men, and indeed Geach roundly states: 'One virtue, if I am right, that God cannot share with his creatures is the virtue of sympathy with physical suffering'. But if God lacks pity for man's physical sufferings because, not sharing I 19</page><page sequence="5">Discussion the animal part of our nature, he does not grasp their distinctive horridness, he must fail to understand many of the springs of action in man as well as in the lower animals. Since the reduction of physical suffering and the pursuit of physical pleasure lead men to drain, clear, mine, dam, till, and in countless other ways alter the physical world, it equally follows that God would have a woefully inadequate understanding of how large tracts of his physical creation have come to be as they are and will be in the future. And how could such a God understand, and judge, physical cruelty and kindness or many classic forms of courage and mercy? How could he judge our diverse physical temptations and sins? How could the physical sufferings of martyrs be a relevant witness in the sight of such a God? How could Christ's physical torments on the Cross be deemed a sacrifice? All this is no doubt a far remove from the issue of animal pain. However, if such implications follow from a version of theism which argues that God logically cannot compassionate the sufferings of animals, what this shows is that the existence of animal pain constitutes an absolutely crucial problem for the theist. If mishandled, as by Professor Geach, it can blow a gaping hole in some of the central claims of theism. I have not troubled to mention the many further problems created by the occurrence of mental distress in animals, their anxieties, terrors, and frustrations: for example, the problem of whether God can be supposed to understand what in general unhappiness (or happiness) means in his creatures-and if so, why he does not alleviate it, but if not, how he can be said to under- stand his own creatures at all. I believe I have said enough to show that the problem of animal pain is at least not resolved by postulating a divine indifference to it. But of course what else is Professor Geach to say? That animal suffering is the necessary price of their development as moral beings? That Christ has redeemed the whole animal creation as well as the fallen human race? That the sufferings of innocent animals will be glori- ously compensated in an after life? Such suggestions would presumably repel Geach as incredible, if not blasphemous. Perhaps we ought to have sympathy (pity, compassion) for him in his dilemma. University of Hull 120</page></plain_text>
