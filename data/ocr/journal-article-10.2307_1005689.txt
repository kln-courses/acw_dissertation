Be- yond this their works were referred to very briefly, at best, and the authors were commonly disparaged. In an article published in 1929 I attempted to direct atten- tion to their historic significance. Subsequent publica- tions of mine on Ledoux, including the first monograph, were followed by French biographies in 1934 and 1945. As to Boullee and Lequeu, my essays in the Art Bulle- tin, 1939 and 1949, seem to be the only biographical studies on these two men. Continued research yielded much new material. Moreover, I will discuss the predecessors of these three men who were also highly interesting personalities, and enter another hitherto neglected field, that of eighteenth- century French architectural theory. Some of the trea- tises I have used are rare and not easily accessible, while others are too lengthy for the average reader. There- fore, selected passages which provide a deeper insight into the thought of the era and reveal the character of their authors have been assembled in my notes. The bibliography lists monographs and essays of general interest; further bibliographical references are included in the notes. Those interested in Ledoux will find here sources that are missing in other biographies, just as they will find among the illustrations many designs not before reproduced. This book ventures into unmapped territory. It at- tempts to lay the groundwork for an investigation of the architecture of the era which culminated in the French Revolution. Although the attempt here is to clarify the historical position of the architects by set- ting off their production against the general trends of their period, it does not pretend to say the last word on the development which it will discuss for the first time. I know that one can look at the extremely original works of these three architects from various angles. It is to be hoped that others will not limit themselves to pointing out the shortcomings of this attempt, but will carry on with independent and better interpretations based on a renewed scrutiny of their works, and of the treatises referred to in the text. To begin with, I should like to make it clear that I do not regard as "revolutionary architects" those archi- tects who were commissioned by revolutionary authori- ties in the years 1789-1799 to design public buildings, memorials or ephemeral decorations for revolutionary celebrations. The architects considered here did not 433</page><page sequence="5">434 KAUFMANN: THREE REVOLUTIONARY ARCHITECTS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. play any active role in the political scene; nor did they belong to the host of minor artists who pretended that they were abreast of the times when they affixed Phryg- ian caps or other petty emblems to thoroughly conven- tional designs. They were men imbued with the great new ideals set forth by the leading thinkers of the cen- tury, and strove unconsciously rather than intentionally, to express these ideals in their own medium. No broad- minded historian of the French Revolution will restrict himself to the deeds and misdeeds which occurred in the years of turmoil, from the destruction of the Bastille to the ultimate restoration of order. He will rather study how the concept of the individual's rights, and of a new order of society developed and took hold during the decades prior to 1789; how people began to defend the new ideas, failing temporarily, but paving the way for the future. Art history, likewise, must deal with the growth of ideas before commenting on their materializa- tion. Historians have believed that architecture and the fine arts in general remained apart from the eighteenth- century movement of reorientation and reorganization. This erroneous belief resulted from the fact that the protagonists of the architectural revolution fell into oblivion when the ideas for which they fought were discredited. Most contemporaries and the following generations were not able to distinguish between those attempts which were to become fruitful and permanent, and those which proved to be merely whimsical and transitory.' But there are other reasons why the great changes remained almost unnoticed up to recent times. In the first place, many of the actual buildings by the revolutionaries were, on the surface at least, conserva- tive, adhering to Baroque 2 tenets or looking back to the remote past-above all, to antiquity and to the Mid- dle Ages. Secondly, almost all of these buildings have been destroyed, so that it is only by turning to the writ- ings and projects of the architects that one can learn about the aspirations of the era. Along with the general unrest which was to lead to the political revolution, went a slowly-growing dissatis- faction with the established modes of artistic composi- tion. This discontent caused the architects to search for, and finally find, new forms and, even more impor- tant, a new principle of composition. A brief outline 1 Lemonnier, Henry, La megalomanie dans l'architecture, L'Architecte 5: 92-97, 1910, devotes two pages to Boullee ridi- culing the artist: "de projets tres pousses, dont quelques-uns deconcertent au premier abord . . . on devine ce qu'il pouvait faire du chateau de Versailles...." He also finds that Boullee would not deserve mention at all, had he not enjoyed a certain reputation while alive, and been a member of the Institut de France, Benoit, F., L'art franCais sous la Revolution et l'Empire, 267, Paris, 1897, disparages Ledoux: ". . . avide d'inedit, il in- venta des monstruosites." Only recently it seems, has opinion about these artists changed in their country. 2 In this investigation the term "Baroque" will be used in a wider sense. It will serve to indicate certain basic composi- tional principles which were already decisive in the Renaissance, and reached their climax in the Baroque proper. of the main architectural trends in the late eighteenth century may help to make this detailed investigation more easily comprehensible. Well-balanced harmony within a hierarchical order had been a foremost aim of the Renaissance and the Baroque, even of the Baroque's last stage with all its sumptuousness and exaggeration. In the late eight- eenth century, however, the chief aims were the ex- pression of character, the creation of atmosphere, and the division of the composition into independent units. The French architects at the close of the century were not content with literary picturesqueness, but aimed at expressiveness, legitimately through form. The forms which promised best to serve the double end of expressiveness and individualism were those of elementary geometry. Self-contained, these forms al- lowed the parts to be independent from each other. Moreover, they allowed the architect to give "character" to a building by differentiating the constituents in size, or by contrasting them in shape. The revolutionary architects also passed from the traditional to the geomet- rical forms because their attitude toward the material had undergone a profound change. The sensuous Ba- roque features with their flexibility expressed the Ba- roque trend toward animism (All-Beseelung). This trend accounts for the preference that was given to "living" forms, e.g., supports in the shapes of Caryatides and A tlantes, or furniture legs ending in claws, etc. The revolutionary architects began to pay more atten- tion to the inherent properties of the materials and liked to present them without any disguise. Although some of their experiments were expressive of the excitement of the period, their goal was no longer outward show, it was restraint. Expressiveness and individualism were also the aims of the rising romantic movement. Revolu- tionary architecture differed in that its creators were hostile to revivalism of any kind, and in principle they rejected any imitation of the past. In reality, of course, the different currents crossed constantly and in many of the revolutionary works reminiscences of the Ba- roque, as well as traces of Romanticism are to be found. But the most advanced of the designs resemble in plain- ness and monumentality those of the twentieth century. In architecture, just as in politics, the reactionaries were to triumph over the inspired, though not suffi- ciently realistic, modernists. But the temporary victory of the conservatives should not lead us to believe that the achievements of the progressives lacked significance. On the contrary, great events took place in eighteenth- century architecture-events which were as significant as the processes of transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, as momentous as the contemporaneous changes in philosophical thinking, in literature, and in social life. A glorious artistic tradition was abandoned, and the foundations of a new tradition were laid.3 3 In my Von Ledoux bis Le Corbusier, 5, 39, 48, 59, Vienna, 1933, I pointed out that one should not see merely the sterile classicism about 1800, but realize that then certain new artistic</page><page sequence="6">VOL. 42, PT. 3, 1952] INTRODUCTION 435 Revolutionary architecture in its entirety is not dis- cussed in this book.4 More than a general survey of the period would allow, it presents the most original personalities in the reform movement, by recounting their lives and by discussing their achievements and the ideals for which they strove. Etienne-Louis Boullee, Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, and Jean-Jacques Lequeu were not the only representatives of French revolutionary architecture. There were many more who shared the same ideals, who had the same contempt for the past, and the same hopes for an artistic renascence. But the work of these three represents the height of the move- ment that ended the Baroque and presaged the architec- ture of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Having lived in the atmosphere of growing political and social discontent, the revolutionary architects wished to realize, for the common good, the ideals of the time by contriving architectural schemes such as had never existed before. They did their part in the double task of the period: tearing down the old and building the new. Like others who served the same cause, they were not spared the ordeals of their times and were menaced by its fanaticism. In the end they themselves became disillusioned and reactionary. principles rose to live on all through the nineteenth century. Cp. my review, Art Bulletin 30: 288, 1948, of Raval, Marcel, and J.-Ch. Moreux, Ledoux. 4 In my forthcoming Architecture in the Age of Reason the transformation of architectural thought in the eighteenth cen- tury will be discussed, with special regard to French Revolu- tionary Architecture. Of the three, Boullee represents primarily the strug- gle for new forms; Ledoux, the search for a new order of the constituents; Lequeu the tragic ultimate stage of the revolutionary movement-despair, resignation, and return to the past. Because of the depth of Ledoux' thought and the wide scope of his building activities, his work will be presented more completely and more thor- oughly than has been done in any previous publication. Today Ledoux is recognized as a great architect. Twenty years ago it was difficult to bring out any pub- lications on him. In general, people are reluctant to concern themselves with artists whose names they have never heard. Or, as Francois Blondel so brilliantly put it in the dedication of his Cours d'architecture: "nous n'avons point d'amour pour les choses que nous ignorons." 5 Today, the revolutionary current in eight- eenth-century architecture is an accepted historical fact. The increased knowledge of the period will remove what may be left of former doubts. Many contemporary sources spoke, approvingly or otherwise, of the indomitable urge toward innovation, and of the innovators themselves. Thus we are pro- vided with the background for a better understanding of the three architects. Prominent among the sources are the publications of Jacques-Francois Blondel, who was the founder of the most renowned school of archi- tecture in the eighteenth century. We shall begin with him, for he was the first teacher of the eldest of our architects, Boullee. 5 Paris, 1675.</page><page sequence="7">PART I ETIENNE-LOUIS BOULLEE I. THE TEACHERS JACQUES-FRANQOIS BLONDEL Jacques-Francois Blondel's reputation is based chiefly on his activities as teacher and writer.' He himself felt that his principal merits lay in these fields. When his last hours approached, he asked to be taken to his school in the Louvre. There he wished to wait for death, and there he died.2 His architectural work, however, was to be as i'mportant as his teaching, for his buildings il- lustrate the great change which took place in the eight- eenth century. His early manner may easily be recog- nized in the designs of his first publication in 1737, De la distribution des maisons de plaisance; 3 his late man- ner in the structures he erected at Metz between 1761 and 1771. The most striking traits of the five maisons de plai- sance are the plastic character of the architectural body as a whole and of its single features; the predominance of voids over walls; the lavishness of decoration. In these projects he almost reached the borderline where disintegration of Baroque composition begins (fig. 1). The portico of the Cathedral of Metz, however, has a different character.4 Here the wall is emphasized and a heavy parapet crowns the sides, but without the row of statues by which formerly buildings seemed to fade into the sky. The Corps de Garde and the H6tel de Ville in the same city are of still greater sternness.5 Like his buildings, Blondel's writings contain prin- ciples of the Baroque, side-by-side with the germs of the tendency toward simplicity and "purity." One might surmise that this tendency merely formed part of the return to antiquity, which is generally consid- ered a chief trait of late eighteenth-century development. However, extremely few statements in Blondel's volumi- 1 About Blondel as the teacher of Boullee, see Papiers de Boullee, Paris, Bibl.

It is, moreover, interesting to note that in his early, more Baroque phase, he called attention to the impor- tance of studying classical works,6 whereas in the late Cours d'Architecture-composed in the time of the sup- posed ascending "Classicism"-he declared that it made no sense to erect buildings in the manner of the An- cients.7 Studying their work, he pointed out, should teach one to think, but not in the same way that they thought. Each nation, he felt, had its own approach. What was right for one generation would not be right for those to come.8 It is, of course, not possible to draw a clear demarca- tion line between Blondel's early and his late periods. The opposed concepts crossed constantly, just as they were to do in the works and writings of his pupils, Boullee and Ledoux. The older architect, naturally, devoted more space to the older ideas, while the two younger men gave more attention to the modern views. FIG. 1. Country house-BAtiment A~ l'Italienne. How-ever, a mixture of contradictory ideas is not all that the work of these three architects had in common. Many of Boull1'e's and Ledoux' achievements seem to be removed from those of Blondel by centuries rather than by a generation. But on reading their respective texts there can be no doubt that the seeds of the revo- lutionary thinking of the later architects were planted in Blondel's school. If one is startled by the originality of Ledoux, one will perhaps be still more amazed to find a very similar boldness of thought in Blondel's cool, 6 Blondel, Distribution 1: xv, "a puiser dans l'ancienne Architecture les premiers elemens de cet Art." 7 Blondel, J.-F., Cours d'Architecture . . . contenant les le-ons donne'es en 1750 et les annees suizvantes 3: liv, Paris, 1771 f., "il seroit peut-etre dleraisonnable de vouloir aujourd'hui elever chez nous des edifices precisement dans le gofit de l'antique." 8 Ibid., lv, "Les Anciens . . . peuvent bien nous apprendre a penser; mais nous ne devons pas penser comme eux.

His criticism of the moderns, how- ever, provides us today with the clearest description of their style. Blondel was extremely proud of his profession: Ar- chitecture, he prods, is a creative art,9 and is clearly to be distinguished from the process of building; 10 the architect was to combine art with the techniques of construction." Some of Blondel's passages are the very forerunners of Ledoux' enunciations: 12 There should not be a single moment when the architect ceases to think of his mission, not even in the hours of relaxa- tion; 13 he must ardently endeavor to discover the prom- ise latent in the building site; 14 he should be possessed by a thirst for knowledge of every description.15 A good architect should be interested in every aspect of life.'0 Soon the reader will see how a new type of architec- ture developed in the eighteenth century. In Blondel himself we already find the new type of "enlightened" builder 17 who was to be guided by "reason"; and we recognize in him the universally-minded architect who could claim to be the legitimate judge of the other arts.'8 Blondel, an indefatigable worker, forever intent upon improvement,'9 was predestined to be the leader of the younger generation. My view of Blondel as a progressive teacher is based not only on many of his statements, which I shall discuss later, but corroborated by Pierre Patte, who edited the posthumous fifth volume of Blondel's Cours. Transi- tory and minor changes would hardly have prompted Patte to say: He has succeeded, by his teaching, in preparing the revo- lution that came to pass in architecture in the last twenty years. We should not forget that we owe him this.20 9 Ibid., xiv, "L'Architecture est un Art createur." 10 Ibid. 4: viii, "plus de veritable Architecture . . . et moins de maconnerie." Cp. Ledoux, C.-N., L'Architecture, 15, Paris, 1804, "L'Architecture est a la maconnerie ce que la poesie est aux belles lettres; c'est l'enthousiasme dramatique du metier; on ne peut en parler qu'avec exaltation." 1 Cours 4: xxv, "il faut reunir la science au metier." 12 Ibid. 3: xv, "Doue d'un heureux genie l'Architecte . . . se trouve appele pour elever les merveilles que l'Architecture enfante." 13Ibid., xxiv, "Lors de ses delassements meme, il faut faire en sorte que tout . . . tourne au profit de l'Art." 14Ibid., xxv, "on parcourt d'un ceil avide les environs. 15Ibid., xxvi, "c'est avec la passion de devenir un Architecte de merite, qu'on s'eclaire avec tous, et en tout temps." 16 Ibid., xxv, "tout interesse, tout instruit."

Blondel avoit pour principe d'eclairer par le raisonnement . . . tout ce qu'il enseignoit." 18 Ibid. 3: lxxiv, "L'Architecte, Juge-ne de tous les Arts liberaux." 19 Ibid., 388, "la premiere pensee n'est jamais precisement celle a laquelle il faut s'arreter. 20Ibid. 5: vii, "Aussi a-t-il reussi a preparer, par ses instruc- tions la revolution qui s'est faite depuis 20 ans dans le gofit de notre Architecture." It seems worth while then to study Blondel's writings to learn what had happened. Patte declares explicitly that Blondel was not a revolutionary, but only prepared the revolution. This characterization conforms with the picture we gain from Blondel's text. The "professor full of fight," as Georges Len6tre dubbed Blondel,2' was a staunch defender of the old faith, but he had also much understanding of the new trends. Blondel never tired of putting emphasis on the basic principles of the hierarchical Baroque, on gradation and concatenation,22 or, as he put it, "l'architecture pyra- midale" and "les liaisons qui seules peuvent mettre d'ac- cord les parties avec le tout." 23 As to the requirements of gradation he offered general comments as well as specific suggestions. He favored the predominance of the main avant-corps, and an "air of superiority" for the dominant part.24 The liveliness of the plan and the "pyramidal" form, in his view contributed most to the excellence of the Luxembourg.25 For this very same gradation he praised Palladio, but not for that classical- ity which so many critics, past and present, have ascribed to the Vicentine master.26 He pointed out that just as within the single structure one part is to rule, so in a group is one building to be accentuated.27 He warned against combining a basement with an attic, for two "subaltern" stories could never make a satisfying whole.28 He found it quite unpardonable to adorn the basement with orders while leaving the higher-ranking main story bare and unadorned.29 Attics, he held, should not contain rooms, but serve only as crowning features.30 Orders deserved blame if used indiscrimi- nately without regard to the rank of the stories.31 Simi- larly, he censured the over-ornamentation of Islamic art with its persistent repetition of identical Motifs.32 To him, concatenation and integration were as im- portant as gradation. He incessantly pleaded for per- 21 Lenotre, Blondel, 6, "le belliqueux professeur." 22 Gradation means the differentiation of the parts according to their rank; concatenation their formal unification. Both terms were used in these senses by Robert Morris, Rural Archi- tecture, London, 1750. 23 Cours 1: 386, 430. 24 Distribution 1: 190, "air de superiorite."

As the most efficient means of unifying the interior space, he recom- mended the enfilade, or the threading of rooms along an axis ; 35 and he also suggested the use of mirrors on opposite walls to create the illusion of continuous vistas." The enfilade, which had been extremely popular in France since the late seventeenth century, not only tied all of the rooms together, but also served to tie the in- terior to the exterior vista. Staircases were not to be placed in the center of the structure, lest they obstruct 33Blondel, J.-F., Architecture francoise, 1: 56, Paris, 1752, "les rapports du tout aux parties, et des parties au tout."

Thus Blondel agreed with the Baroque con- ception of the house as a breathing organism, in which all of the parts communicated with each other, and with the surroundings.38 He was fond of the open alleys which afforded the splendid views of Baroque parks.39 Blondel regarded as particularly beautiful his projected Manor House for a Gentleman from Florence because one could enjoy the wide vistas from many of its parts; 40 the entrance to the park was to have been from the Grand Salon.41 In the fourth volume of his Cours, which came out as late as 1773, Blondel still exhorted his pupils not to forget the correlation of buildings erected on the same site,42 and to be careful about the correspondence of interiors with their environment.43 He considered Pal- 37 Arch. franCoise 1: 39, "les escaliers situes dans le milieu de l'edifice masquoient 1'enfilade de la cour avec celle des j ardins." 38 Distribution 1: 58, "Il faut percer le milieu de son Batiment de facon qu'on puisse profiter de la vue des differents objets qu'on a assujettis au Batiment. 39 Arch. fran(oise 1: 46, "prolonger le coup d'ceil que for- ment les enfilades principales d'un parc." 40Distribution 1: 11, 13. 41 Ibid., 13. 42 Cours 4: 148, "l'art de faire marcher ensemble les issues, les dependances et la distribution exterieure des faqades." 43 Ibid., 153, "l'art de rendre relatifs les dehors avec les dedans."

Sculpture was to be blended with architecture so that it would be impossible to sever them without destroying the whole.46 This precept, too, stemmed from the desire for perfect unity. Blondel was speak- ing like any architect-sculptor of the Baroque period when he demanded that the wall between the openings should be adorned with reliefs.47 He took pride in the design of his B?atiment a l'Italienne because the plastic character of the body derived directly from the plan 48 (fig. 1). His criticism of buildings by other architects was based on this principle. He praised, for instance, the project for the Abbaye de Panthemont, by Franqois Franque, because its walls tied the porch of the church to the adjacent monastery.49 On the other hand, he found fault with the Tuileries for the lack of unity,50 which partly resulted from the application of petty, disharmonious features.5' Broken cornices,52 and en- tablatures differing in design,53 were a horror to him, and he found harmony imperiled when the single parts were in discord, or, as he put it, "quarrelling." 54 The description of the Batiment a l'Italienne in his earliest publication reads like an eighteenth-century treatise on the aims of the Baroque.55 Despite Blondel's allegiance to the established sys- tem, new views gradually crept into the doctrine of this defender of the old, and, what is more, he himself was aware of the cracks in the old structure. He still shared to some extent, the belief that there should be a sort of kinship between architectural performance and nature, in particular the human body. The most re- nowned architects, he found, reached perfection only by imitating nature and conforming to the proportions of man.56 This belief is illustrated in the plates of the Ibid. 3: 431, "il accompagnoit ses edifices d'avant-sc'nes toujours interessantes." 45 Distribution 1: 18, "afin que l'aeil embrasse le plus d'objets qu'il est possible." 46 Ibid., 56, "que la sculpture semble se marier avec son Architecture . . . qu'on n'en peut rompre l'accord sans de- figurer l'Edifice." 47 Ibid., 57, and still so in Cours 3: 21. 48 Distribution 1: 181, "Ce Pavillon regoit beaucoup de relief de la forme de son plan." 49Encyclopedie, loc. cit., 8, "se lient heureusement." 50 Cours 3: 75. 51 Ibid., 77, "les niches trop petites et disparates entr'elles." 52 Arch. fran(oise 1: 72, 73. 53 Distribution 1: 136, "desunion dans les entablemens." 54Ibid., 162, "rien ne peche plus contre l'harmonie . . . que de voir les arriere-corps d'une Facade disputer avec les avant- corps." 55Ibid., 181. 56 Cours 3: 3, "les Architectes les plus renommes ne sont arrives 'a ce degre de perfection, qu'en imitant la nature . . . Tuscan capital.57 To test the divergent precepts of Palladio, Scamozzi, and Vignola, Blondel drew human profiles over archi- tectural "profiles" (fig. 2). The result might be a reminder of the classical saying: Man is the measure of all things. Yet several passages in L'Architecture francoise which seem to agree with the "profiles," 58 have in reality quite another meaning. He gradually became aware that to force architectural features to conform to organic shapes was to use them in a man- ner contrary to their own nature. For a while he had shared the belief that all artists had held since the Renaissance. They appreciated matter for its sensuous beauty, yet did not want it to influence composition by its properties. According to their doctrine, . . . la matiere doit etre comptee pour rien, la beaute des masses, la proportion des parties et la reunion du tout en- semble, sont les premieres considerations qu'on doit avoir dans l'Architecture pour ce qui concerne F'ordonnance.59 Notwithstanding his "profiles," Blondel on the whole had abandoned the anthropomorphic concept of archi- tecture. He disapproved using Caryatides and Persanes as substitutes for columns. The Greeks, he realized, may have had some good, though not strictly artistic, reasons for their use-probably as commemorative of certain historical events-but to him they were "un- bearable." 60 The ultra-naturalistic Caryatides 'I and Persanes,62 which Eisen had designed for Blondel's book, illustrate all their physical strain in supporting the entablatures. They seem to have been added to the text as warnings rather than as models (fig. 3). The notion of the "Natural" had acquired a new sig- nificance in the late eighteenth century. It no longer meant the imitation of organic nature, but rather the rational adaptation of the forms to their purpose, and their conformity to the material. This new point of view is reflected in a passage in Blondel's Architecture franfoise dealing with the "natural arrangement" of the plan.63 Obviously, the "natural" plan had nothing to do with a model taken from nature; it was the logical, or the practical, as opposed to the organic and orna- mental plan of the Baroque. The same functional think- ing prompted Blondel's remarks on pediments: the tri- angular alone were legitimate, since they followed the et en cherchant a concilier ses beautes diverses avec les pro- portions . . . dans le corps humain."

Decorative pediments, except in some cases, were to be avoided.64 Remarks such as these are in no way incidental. The defender of the old had become an apostle of the new. This change in his thinking is mainly apparent in his late Cours. Sud- denly he discovered a lack of consistency in the tradi- tional structures, and he wanted to reinstate "la Logique de l'Art . . . qu-il paroit important de retablir"; 65 true style he believed would reveal the individual character of each structure.66 As far as we know, the functionalist point of view was first set forth in about 1750 by the Venetian theo- rist Carlo Lodoli, and his adherents the rigoristi, who were so violently repudiated by Gianbattista Piranesi.67 Yet it seems that the concept of architectural logic ap- pealed more to the French than to the Italians. A cer- tain measure of proof of this statement can be found in a rare booklet of 1702, the Metmoires critiques d'archi- tecture, by Fremin, who was President au Bureau des Finances 'a Paris. Fremin, who was not a learned archi- tect, may be taken as a representative of the current taste in France. He was progressive enough to declare that the orders were the least part of architecture. And although he advocated unity, regularity, and the corre- spondence of the parts, he objected to profuseness of decoration and permitted ornamentation only if it was "necessary and natural." 68 The first consequence of the new point of view was the attack on ornament, especially the decorative rather than the interpretative.69 In any case, it was to be applied with the greatest restraint.70 The Spaniards and the Germans in particular were singled out as guilty of extravagance and confusion.7' While Blondel in the Distribution advocated the most intimate connection of architecture and sculpture, he stated in a lecture deliv- ered in 1747, and in the Cours, that in architecture sculp- ture was as superfluous as any other kind of decoration. Architecture could well do without them; it required only solidity, practicality, and symmetry.72 (Symmetry 64 Cours 3: 220-222. 65 Ibid. 4: liv. 66 Ibid., lv, ". . . vrai style qui assigne a chaque Edifice le caractere qui lui est propre."

On trouvera peut-etre etonnant que was to be the last remnant of the traditional concept from which not even the far more advanced Ledoux could depart.) Another source of the hostility against ornament was the new fondness for the plain and the calm, "le grand gofit de la belle sieplicite." The de- mand for "simplicite male," 7 or "noble simplicite," 7 appeared frequently in the Distribution. As a model of restraint, Blondel cited a house on the rue du Coq Saint-Honore, by Franque,6 which was of the type built around 1800 on the rue de Rivoli. The new aesthetics were summed up in "le style simple est preferable au style ampoule...." A further factor in the development of post-Baroque architecture was the appearance of individualistic tend- encies. These tendencies most probably were the very ground from which structural rationalism, as well as aesthetic purism, sprang. They appeared first under the aspect of Romanticism, but were to last long after Romanticism had passed. Previously the great codi- fications of architectural taste of the Renaissance and the Baroque had laid down a norm binding for all. Blondel was one of the first to declare: "Taste is a mat- ter of the individual and is indeterminate." 78 This statement was a bold challenge at a time when the an- cients were still the first, and almost the sole, authori- ties, and ties Blondel to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.79 The demand for individualism was closely related to the newly arising requirements of character,80 and Blon- del thought that to be able to express the character of a structure, one must, above all, have grasped its specific significance. Architecture was not the only field in which the late eighteenth century tried to penetrate the "mysteries" of character.81 The very popular physi- ognomical studies were similar attempts in this direc- tion. Whereas Renaissance architects had studied the measurements of the human body and had tried to apply these to architecture-Blondel's profiles are a late in- stance of these endeavors-architects now tried to instill human characteristics into the buildings.

It began with a passionate desire for a thorough-going reformation of the architectural body; it was to end in shallow symbolism. Blondel dealt at length with the new goal of architec- tural character in the fourth chapter of the first volume of the Cours, entitled "Analyse de l'Art." 83 He did not intend to present a new body of doctrine, but merely to express his beliefs as an artist. His academic sup- port of the modern movement must have impressed his pupils considerably more than the dusty time-honored precepts which he repeated almost by habit. The second volume of the Cours presents the same views in a more condensed form: Every work of archi- tecture was to express its purpose, and to be shaped accordingly.84 Blondel added the stern warning that it was not sufficient to rely on symbolic sculpture; 85 that the architect must speak through the arrangement of masses, the choice of forms, and elegance of style.86 In his condemnation of extra-architectural means, Blon- del came somewhat closer to the point of view of the Rigorists, while the literary-minded Romanticists en- joyed narrating the character of the structure rather than visualizing it. His chapter "Programmes" tells the students how the new architectural, ideal was to be put into practice,87 but a detailed discussion here of this chapter would lead us too far afield. The concept of giving each building personality by stressing its character had hardly yet been born, when the menace of exaggeration became evident. Blondel soon felt compelled to caution against displaying char- acter for its own sake. He derided the senseless pic- turesqueness of sentimental landscape architecture with its artificial ruins, and the like.88 Nonetheless, he him- self indulged in dreams of the mysterious, grand, bold, terrible, and frivolous in architecture.89 Blondel felt that architecturally, the most reasonable demand was for grandeur: that this held out the great- est promise of counteracting the over-ornamentation of the late Baroque.90 Looking back to Italy, Blondel was fascinated by the grandeur of her architecture, and this he missed in France.91 82 Etudes d'architecture en France, Magasin Pittoresque, 388, 1852, "Ledoux etait partisan de ce qu'on a appele depuis l'archi- tecture parlante." 83 Cours 1: 373-447. 84 Ibid. 2: 229, ". . . tous doivent avoir un caractere qui determine leur forme generale et qui annonce le batiment pour ce qu'il est." 85Ibid., 229, "II ne suffit pas que ce caractere distinctif soit seulement designe par les attributs de la Sculpture." 86 Ibid., 2310, "la belle disposition des masses generales, le choix des formes, et un stile soutenu." 87 Ibid. 4: lxxxiv. 88 Ibid. 3: xxxiv, ". . . ne plaire qu'aux Peintres de Ruines." 89 Ibid. 1: 422-430. 90 Ibid. 3: 347, he praises St. Sulpice by Servandoni for "la suppression de toutes les petites parties." 91 Ibid., 426, "grandeur qu'on rencontre rarement dans nos productions Francoises." FIG. 4. Plan of a Parish church. In a discussion of artistic concepts of the past, we must carefully consider how the various ideas changed their significance almost imperceptibly. One of the cornerstones of classical aesthetics was the category of convenance, which meant thinking of the decorum, or regard of the rank of the patron. To Blondel, con- venance meant the consideration of the proper atmos- phere.92 It is not easy to disentangle in his lengthy treatises the crossing lines of his thought. More con- cise information about the new demand for Narrative Architecture can be found in Nicolas Lecamus de Mezieres' Genie de IArchitecture.93 How the demand for character affected the actual planning can be seen from Blondel's project of his Parish Church 94 (fig. 4), which was the predecessor to Ledoux' church of the Ideal City. Blondel admit- ted having been inspired by various French church buildings, first among them Hardouin-Mansart's Chapel of Versailles.95 Thus, we may believe him to be sin- cere when he asserted that he was not influenced by 92Arch. franCoise 1: 22, note, "(la convenance) apprend que dans un edifice grave tout doit inspirer la tranquillite, le re- spect, . . ." 93 Lecamus de Mezieres, Nicolas, Le Ge'nie de l'Architecture ou l'analogie de cet art avec nos sensations, Paris, 1780. 94Cours 2: 312, 3: 382; pl.

Saint-Amand en Flandres, near Valenciennes, built in 1624,96 despite some similarity in his plan. We may the more believe him since he introduced a composi- tional motif of great significance in his Parish Church that distinguishes it from that of the Flemish church. In both, the sanctuary and the choir are raised above the nave some forty steps-"inegalite de sol qui produit necessairement le plus grand effet." 97 Whereas the choir of Saint-Amand is situated in the transept, under the dome, and the altar is at the east end of the nave, Blondel inverted this order: his altar is situated in the transept, under the dome, and the choir follows in the nave beyond. Moreover, Blondel raised the side arms of the transept to the level of the sanctuary.98 He sacrificed the continuity of the entire interior space, and preferred to center the church around the altar. His chief aim was to exalt the main feature as strongly as possible, by bringing it impressively close to the congregation.99 The traditional arrangement with the sanctuary at the far end offers the entering visitor a continuous vista all through the main nave. Blondel disrupted the unity of the whole so as to let the altar speak with greater intensity than it could from its cus- 96 Ibid. 2: 312, note n, 3: 383, 4: xxxiii. 97Ibid. 3: 383. 98 Ibid., 389. 99 Ibid., 388, 389.

The concept of blending the parts has been superseded by isolating and contrasting them; the Baroque pattern has been replaced by the Roman- tic.100 Blondel expected the decoration, also, to conform to the atmosphere. He wanted the interior of a cathedral to express grandeur without the help of paintings or sculpture.10' The light was to be subdued, to inspire awe.102 Twilight he found most appropriate to add to the mysteriousness, and most conducive to introspec- tion.103 He was opposed to any illusionistic decoration of the dome that made it appear to open into the sky, preferring instead solid vaults 104 which would embrace the mystery and shut out the world. The trend toward isolation of the parts is illustrated in his design for the front of the Eglise Conventuelle 105 (fig. 5). Here, substructure, tower, and spire are dis- tinctly severed from each other. Each in itself might serve a distinct purpose, without any change in its form: the spire as an obelisk, the substructure as a temple. Contrariwise, if any part of a Baroque structure were removed from its context, it would become merely a fragment. Blondel, incidentally, stated that he would have preferred sober Doric forms to the richer Corin- thian ordered by clients.106 The craving for expressive architecture developed a predilection for commissions that were compatible with architecture parlante. There was, of course, little prac- tical need of structures which, by their very nature, were likely to "speak." Yet we find many of them dis- cussed in the "Programmes," where Blondel presented Mile posts,107 Lighthouses,'08 Entrances to arsenals,109 and Prisons.1"0 Soon such buildings became favorite subjects in schools and in competitions. The sympa- thetic response of the younger generation can be found in the designs for the Grands Prix."' Simultaneously, architecture was confronted with more realistic problems. Outstanding among these was the improvement of the private dwelling. Here the new ideals, especially those of simplicity, indi- viduality, isolation, "naturalness," found a still better outlet. In his Cours, Blondel blamed some writers- Daviler, Boffrand, Briseux, and also himself in his earlier treatise, De la distribution-for not having dealt 100 Later we shall see how the new compositional principles gained ground. 101 Cours 2: 327, 328. 102 Ibid. 3: 307, 315. 103 Ibid., 417. 104 Ibid., 419. 105 Ibid., 398; pi.

There is still another field which Blondel covered very thoroughly in the Cours, the vast field of utili- tarian buildings.113 He wrote at length about Mints, Exchanges, Libraries, Judiciary Buildings, Markets, Reservoirs, etc. These "lower" categories were now considered worthy of the architect's efforts. In this crucial moment traditional formality became almost senseless. But the French revolutionary architects did not think of replacing it by the Lodolian Utopia of pure functionalism; they searched rather for some timely form. We have seen Blondel, as an architect and as a writer, standing between two periods. His written work pre- sents one more interesting aspect. It contains his com- ments on the contemporary situation of architecture, and a characterization of the generation growing up. The respective passages, especially those in the third and fourth volumes of the Cours, are very instructive and Blondel's views may be summarized as follows: Not so long ago, it seemed as if the century was Rococo. Now, everything has changed, though one can hardly understand why it has. Formerly Greek and Roman architecture was held in little esteem, con- sidered cold and monotonous. Now it has become fash- ionable to imitate the works of the Ancients and those of exotic nations. One goes even so far as to copy the Chinese bizarreries in decorating interiors, to ape the heavy style of ancient Egypt in building, and to expect other nations to follow the French example. The re- introduction of the Gothic seems not to be far off."14 In interior decoration, a distance of a century seems to separate current manner from that of only thirty years back.115 Only those architects are given credit who add some singular novelties to what has been customary, defying tradition and reason.116 The desire for change has stirred everyone.117 The new fashion does not con- 112 Cours 4: 107, 188. 113 Ibid. 2: 389-449. 114Ibid. 3: lviii, "II y a plusieurs annees qu'il sembloit que notre siecle etoit celui des Rocailles; aujourd'hui sans trop savoir pourquoi, il en est autrement.

A well-known architect introduced these a few years earlier as an adornment above the windows of some public building; six months later, Paris was full of them.124 Blondel continues, though it may be advisable for the beginner to follow the Ancients, the mature architect should adapt their forms to the modern exigencies and the available materials.125 Architecture is creativeness, genius, the art of taste. This is why one breaks with the old canons.126 The works of predecessors have mer- its of their own.127 But the living have the right of criticism.128 One should not discard all the rules,129 but neither should one remain silent when architecture "degenerates." 130 Already the new reform spirit has infected the stu- dents.

One might believe that he had in mind the latest phase of the Baroque when he criti- cized the lack of symmetry and simplicity,150 and the incongruities in composition.151 But beside his remark that the era of the rocailles was past,152 there is further evidence that productions other than those of the Rococo must have aroused him. He illustrates a doorway in order to exemplify what architecture should not look like,153 and points out its modernistic "faults," particu- larly the discrepancy between the small opening of the entrance and the huge mass of the whole.154 Elsewhere he assails the oversized and disproportionate projects in vogue among the students,155 and also objects to the modern, repellent heaviness.156 He draws a clear de- marcation between the "frivolous" furniture decoration of former times and the four-square solid furniture of modern times, which he dislikes.157 It is obvious that Blondel was not so much opposed to the "license" and "abuse" of the Rococo, as to the revolutionary innovations: the shapeless, the extrava- gant, the megalomaniacal,158 the ponderous.159 The only modern tendencies with which he agreed were those of 147 Ibid. 4: ix, "ces contrastes . . . ces pretendues opposi- tions, en un mot . . . ces tours de force que le vulgaire applaudit." 148Ibid. 3: 151, "tout ce que le dereglement de l'esprit peut produire de pittoresque." 149 Ibid., 159. 150Ibid. 1: 434.

He declares, almost angrily, that he knows very well that undecorated piers are popular because they are calm, but to him they are "dissonances," or gaps, undermining unity.163 Blondel certainly was not prejudiced. He was full of doubt and afraid of the things to come. He was aware of the changes occurring in architecture but could not grasp their full meaning.'64 In his fear he saw the contradictory features combining to bring about the end of architecture: walls pierced by openings out of place; columns without "order"; crude apertures in- stead of framed windows and doors; accidental embel- lishments instead of decorative sculpture; exuberance instead of character; distorted forms; altered propor- tions; and complete confusion through the mixture of antique, Baroque, and modern elements. The down- fall of "true" architecture seemed to him predestined and imminent.165 There was neither rhyme nor reason for this condition: On ne peut assigner 'a leurs compositions bizarres, un nom qui leur convienne, ni decider 'a quel particulier elles pourroient etre propres.166 Though I believe I have furnished ample documenta- tion to present Blondel's position, I feel that in writ- ing a new chapter of art history I should not pass over the opportunity to clarify further the condition of fer- ment in which architecture found itself in the eighteenth century. There is a highly interesting posthumous pub- lication by Blondel, L'homme du monde eclaire par les arts, which his biographer, Auguste Prost, knew only by name.'67 It contains letters exchanged between two correspondents (probably fictional) holding divergent 160 Ibid., 159, "Il est vrai que depuis quelques annees l'Art a beaucoup gagne; il est certain qu'auj ourd-hui nos j eunes Architectes sont plus severes dans les dehors de leur facades. 161 Ibid. 1: 139, "cette noble simplicite." 162 Ibid. 3: 430, "Peut-etre abusons-nous trop des ressauts . mais ne doit-on pas convenir aussi que cette continuite lisse, poussee 'a 1'exc'es, ne presente plus qu'une composition froide ?" 163 Ibid., 430, "Nous savons bien que quelques Architectes apelent ces intervalles des repos dans l'Architecture; mais nous les appelons des dissonances, des disparites, des nus . . . qui nuisent 'a l'unite." 164Ibid., lviii, "sans trop savoir pourquoi."

Here we see side- by-side the two currents in which the architectural "decay" of the eighteenth century became manifest, one at the beginning of the century, the other toward its end. The two currents, different as they were, had grown on the same soil and been nurtured by the same spirit of rebellion, Some passages leave the question open as to which of the two trends Blondel meant, e.g., when he censured unruliness, lack of proportion, and lack of interrelationship; or inveighs against sense- less contrasts and faulty symmetry.17' This ambiguity is not caused by a lack of discrimination on his part, but rather is due to the fact that the two trends had some outer similarities, and basically the same motiva- tion-insurrection. In this publication we find, moreover, a telling char- acterization of the young generation and their works; and learn about the influence of the Abbe Laugier whose teachings will be discussed later. Those artists whose immaturity must account for their imperfections are not aware that their oversized features are ridiculous, that their scale does not fit human measure- ments. . . .

Pavillon de Bouchefort. . . .173 They have read the essay of Laugier, but there is no reason in their reasoning.174 Blondel's comparison of Meissonnier with Delafosse belongs to the great revelations of art history. He evi- dently understood that both the Rococo and the revo- lutionary architecture were equally hostile to tradition. He condemned Meissonnier's frivolity and Delafosse's heaviness.175 Yet, although he did not agree with the new sternness and sobriety,176 he recognized the superi- ority of the modern over the Rococo masters. He must have sensed that the modern conceptions contained greater promise. (Space does not allow me to deal with Delafosse in this book.) GERMAIN BOFFRA.ND What made Blondel despair, and what in retrospect appears to have been one of the tragedies of art history -the hopeless struggle for contradictory ends-made the young revolutionaries dream of unlimited possibili- ties. Yet they were not the first who went through this crisis. Before them a great old man, Germain Boffrand, had also grappled with the same problems.

Parce qu'ils ont lu l'essai du Pere Logier [sic], ils se croient tres-instruits." Blondel, J. F., Dis- cours sur la necessitW de l'etude de l'Architecture, 88, Paris, 1754, remarks about Laugier's Essai (see note 201), "ouvrage plein d'idees neuves et ecrit avec sagacite." 175 Ibid., 48, "l'un est d'une frivolite choquante, l'autre d'une pesanteur assommante."

Boffrand, too, pointed out the importance of unity and concatenation in his Livre d'Architecture.177 (He used the word enchaineme.t just as his contemporary, Robert Morris, spoke of concatenation.178) He still favored the high French windows which had been common in France since the seventeenth century. These windows have a dual effect: they reduce the fa?ade to a frame- work of piers and narrow bands that separate the stories, and they create the most intimate interrelation between inner and outer space. The relationship between the parts and the whole seems to have meant as much to Boffrand as to any Baroque architect, but he frequently disregarded unification of the components. In the gar- den fronts of the Hotel de Torcy,179 and the H6tel de Seignelay,180 the main cornices of the wings have no continuation in the middle portion. Moreover, the front of the H6tel Seignelay presents a strangely de- ranged rhythm with five bays in the center and two on each side. The unrest exhibited in these features did not re- main confined to the facades. It took hold of plan and mass as well. On the hunting lodge, Pavillon de Bouchefort, built for the Bavarian elector Max Emanuel, near Brussels,181 the chimneys are decorative motifs, competing with the bizarre beacon and the ornamental vases (fig. 6). The central cylindrical part including the salon, contrasts strangely with the octagonal sub- structure. Its four porches recall the Rotonda by Pal- ladio. But there is not a vestige of Palladio's com- posure in Boffrand's work. The elements are in an uproar. Continuing restlessness characterizes the facade of the Palace of Wiirzburg, which owes so much to Boff- rand, and much excitement is also expressed in his design for the Palais de la Malgrange.182 Its roof is adorned with statues, trophies, vases, and chimneys; the openings prevail, the walls have almost. disap- peared. The structural ties are inconspicuous in the general agitation. In his book, Boffrand found it worth while to illustrate his second, and unexecuted, project for Malgrange 183 (fig. 7). This last was to consist of a circular salon from which four apartments radi- ated.184 The upper part of the salon, emerging from 177Boffrand, Germain, Livre d'Architecture, 11, Paris, 1745, "un enchainement et une liaison convenable . . . pour que toutes les parties soient relatives au tout."

Its whimsical plan and ele- vation testify to the unquenchable desire for change which overpowered even the architect considered to be the Grand Master of the Rococo. The structural disintegration, more than the luxuriant decoration is indicative of the historical position of the design. Yet, perhaps, there is really not a great deal of dif- ference between Rococo and revolutionary architecture. But one step separated the two, and Boffrand's text indicates that he had alreadyi taken the step. He ob- jected to the confusion of curves and straight lines,186 and praised the noble simplicity and calmness 187 which soon became the battle cry of the art critics largely through the activities of Johann Joachim Winckelmann. Boffrand claimed that materials were to be treated ac- cording to their inherent nature. Like Lodoli, he dis- approved of wooden forms forced upon stone.188 And FIG. 7. Palais de la Malgrange, second proj ect. while his works merely indicated the symptoms of dis- integration, his words disclose the awakening of a new architectural consciousness. During this awakening noteworthy new ideas rose to the surface. Prominent was the concept of the true, or sound principles-"les veritables principes," or, as the Latin translation of the text puts it, "sana principia." 189 With the concept of soundness, two new categories of aesthetic appreciation appeared: the Natural and the Characteristic. Boffrand found that the beauty of an- 185 Ibid., pl.

And he added this attack against the classicists: "Works which are but copies of other works, will necessarily lack liveliness and beauty." 190 "Nature" was no nebu- lous notion to Boffrand. It was the sum of the indi- vidual properties. "Chaque chose doit &amp;tre faite suivant la nature de l'edifice." 191 The first stage of the struggle for a rational archi- tecture had a Romantic hue. Boffrand felt that a structure should have meaning, and should express it.192 This was the new program of the architecture parlante, of an architecture which would speak to the spectator's mind rather than appeal to his eye. The first criterion Boffrand used in judging an architect was to determine whether the creator understood the character of his own building: Un homme qui ne connoit pas ces differens caracteres, et qui ne les fait pas sentir dans ses ouvrages, n'est pas Architecte.193 To support his view, Boffrand, like so many authors of the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries, turned to a clas- sical authority. From the works of Horace he picked the passage in which the poet wants poems to be not only beautiful, but also moving: Non satis est pulchra esse poemata, dulcia sunto Et quocunque volent animnum auditoris agunto.194 Architecture, like music, said Boffrand, should express joy and sorrow, love and hate, serenity and horror.195 Boffrand stood between two epochs. He could not part entirely from the old ideal of a specific formality, yet he was already affected, and perhaps deeply moved, by the new ideal of expressiveness. Thus it happened that the concept of architectural unity achieved a dual meaning: it came to imply both unity of form, and unity of character. The concept of the visual unification of the parts joined with the concept of their spiritual unison: II faut dans un ouvrage suivre le meme caractere depuis le commencement jusqu'a la fin, pour que toutes les parties soient relatives au tout.196 190 Ibid., 14, "les belles statues antiques et quelques-unes de notre temps sont les enfans de la Nature . . . celles qui sont copiees sur d'autres ouvrages, n'ont ni la meme vie, ni la meme beaute." 191 Ibid., 26. 192 Ibid., 16, "L'Architecture est susceptible de differents genres qui rendent ses parties animees par les differents carac- teres. . .

AMER. PHIL. SOC. Here I should like to refer briefly to the famous Sup- plication aux orfevres by Charles-Nicolas Cochin, the younger, which appeared a few years after Boffrand's Architecture, revealing that Cochin was somewhat in advance of the great architect. Cochin's main point was a warning against the curves of the Baroque, or, in his words, "ces formes barroques," 197 with a plea for straight lines and right angles: "II n'y a que l'angle droit qui puisse faire un bon effet." 198 ABBE LAUGIER Before dealing with the third, and last, teacher of Boullee, I should like to discuss the Abbe Laugier, whose writings, according to Blondel's report, were so avidly read by the young revolutionaries.'99 Laugier was not an architect, but his thought appears to have influenced the students more than did the teaching of their instructors. The writings of Marc-Antoine Laugier exemplify the architectural trends of the mid-eighteenth century. He was more advanced than Blondel and nearer to the point of view of Lodoli.200 He was accused by certain contemporaries of merely reiterating the opinions of an earlier theorist, De Cordemoy, and while Laugier admits 201 having profited from De Cordemoy's Nou- veau traite . ,02 their views were really quite dif- ferent. Laugier, who had imbibed certain new ideas of the mid-century, had a deeper understanding of architecture than De Cordemoy, whose treatise is just another book on the orders, with some feeble disap- proval of the exaggerations of the Baroque.203 The publications of Laugier, however, reveal a profoundly critical thinker, and a typical representative of the Enlightenment. Although Laugier was fully aware of the novelty of the principles he set forth, and of the boldness of his criticism, he was not afraid to state them,204 and felt free to castigate, without mercy, even 197 Mercure France, Dec. 1754, 2: 186. 198 Ibid., 184. 1 Cf. note 174. 200 Cf. note 67. 201 Laugier, Marc-Antoine, Essai sur l'Architecture, x, xxxvii, 16, 262, Paris, 1752.

II, 326. 204 Laugier, Essai, v, "la nouveaute des principes, la hardiesse des Critiques, tout me faisoit craindre pour le sort d'un Ecrit, ou . . . j'osois combattre des usages recus et des prejuges dominans." Laugier was severely criticized by Frezier, 19-59, and La Font de Saint-Yenne, Examen d'un Essai sur l'Archi- tecture, Paris, 1753. the most respected works.205 His dogmatic self-con- fidence came from the conviction that he had found the true principles of architecture: 206 Only a rational doctrine, he believed, would help art to progress.207 Laugier was one of the first, in the era of "classicism," to question the authority of Vitruvius. The Roman writer, he found, was too much concerned with prac- tice to investigate the basis of architecture as an art.208 Laugier, on the contrary, was looking for the solid, im- mutable foundation from which the only true architec- ture could rise.209 In his opinion, all prejudice had to be overcome if this were to be attained.210 The Greek orders themselves were to be tested as to how far they still fitted modern needs.21' Laugier still clung to some of the old tenets, how- ever. He found fault with heavily projecting cornices because they disturbed harmony and unity,212 and he recommended gradation by differentiating the heights of the structural parts,213 with the heavy parts below, and lighter ones above.214 Yet he did not fail to observe the symptoms of decay in contemporary architecture: 215 the swelling of the columns,216 broken entablatures,217 statues in niches,218 engaged columns,219 and that great favorite of Baroque builders, the huge scrolls,220 As a panacea against these and similar follies, the "natu- ral" made its appearance. Laugier still understood "natural" as the affinity to nature, ignoring Lodoli's great discovery, that every thing has a naturalness true to itself. Though Laugier was imbued with new architectural ideals, he yet did not want the elimination of conven- tional forms. Thus it happened that in the last stages of the Baroque there arose a new theory in regard to columns, looking at them from a quite new angle, and 205 Ibid., 15, "En relevant les imperfections de cet edifice (Saint-Gervais, Paris), j'acquiers le droit de n'en epargner aucun autre." 206Ibid., xxxviii, "principes evidens."

When the pro- gressive architects began to favor pilasters, Laugier made a last attempt to salvage columns-the noblest of classical features-from the impending deluge. He saw great merit in the isolated column; it was "true." With its entablature it revealed the real significance of the structural parts.22' He considered interior columns as being merely decorative 222 and pointed out that in- side entablatures made no sense.223 All capricious vari- ations of columns, he condemned, especially the rusti- cated 224 and the twisted.225 But the very worst that an architect could be guilty of, in Laugier's opinion, was the porte-a-faux, i.e., insufficient, or seemingly in- sufficient, support of the upper parts. (The porte-a- faux had already been condemned by earlier authors.226) Consequently, Laugier would allow for only plain post- and-lintel architecture; 227 doors and windows other than the straight, were to him "unnatural." 228 Laugier ultimately came to the conclusion that only the strictly necessary was beautiful; commodiousness en- gendered license, and arbitrary additions meant abuse.229 The remedy, and the path to beauty, were to be found in simplicity and naturalness.230 Thus a new purism arose, hostile to all superfluous ornament 231-to the "hors- d'ceuvres" as Laugier called them 232- and still more hostile to additions to historic buildings. Stylistic purity was a quite new concept. We know of its deplorable consequences during the nineteenth century, especially as it affected restorations. The Baroque was not averse to its own altars, baldacchinos, and statues in Gothic churches. The new purism did not admit of such con- glomeration.233 Laugier made a pregnant statement when he spoke of the decorative additions to Notre- Dame de Paris: "le systeme d'Architecture a ete de- nature' 234 Hand in hand with the new ideals of truth and purity went a new contempt for sensuous beauty, another men- 221 Ibid., xviii, "des colonnes isoles . . . ne laisseront jamais de doute sur la verite du spectacle d'Architecture qu'elles pre- sentent." 222 Observations, 110, "la colonne y devient simple deco- ration." 223Ibid., 110, "deplaces et contre nature." 224Essai, 21. 225 Ibid., 22. 226 Ibid., 48.

Laugier found in it those awe- inspiring qualities for which his contemporaries also began to yearn. In his criticism of its single features, he could not overlook the character of the Gothic build- ing. He admired the contrasts of its masses, which began to mean more to him than "order." He saw in the choir of the Gothic church the atmosphere of the forest.240 We know that the tendency to give buildings char- acter did not do architecture much good. Laugier, too, knew this, and pointed out another way toward archi- tectural progress. Geometry was to be the new point of departure.24' In his suggestions for church plans, Laugier declared: Toutes les figures geometriques, depuis le triangle jus- qu'au cercle, peuvent servir 'a varier sans cesse la compo- sition de ces sortes d'edifices.242 The new architect was to work undeviatingly with simple geometric forms.243 Laugier developed the idea of a triangular church, with a dome above the inscribed circle, entrance porches in the middle of each side, and circular sanctuaries in the three corners.244 Very soon architects were to follow this suggestion, among them, John Soane.245 Another of Laugier's designs meeting the chief ex- igencies of simplicity and originality is a hospital in the shape of St. Andrew's Cross.246 No wonder the circular Halle au ble by Lecamus de Mezieres met with his approval.247 235 Essai, xl, "des beautes essentielles, independantes de l'habi- tude des sens, ou de la convention des hommes." 236Ibid., 156, "II ne faut dans une eglise rien que de simple, de male, de serieux; rien qui puisse faire diversion 'a la piete." 237 Observations, 39. 238Essai, 2, "un edifice construit dans toute la perfection de l'art . . . reveille dans l'ame des idees nobles et touchantes." 239 Ibid., xl, "susceptible de froideur et de vivacite, de justesse et de desordre." 240 Ibid., 199.

AMER. PHIL. SOC. Laugier did not tire of urging architects to leave the trodden paths, to form ideas of their own, to invent, to make something new.248 His charges of sterility and insipidity are the precursors of Ledoux' indignant and contemptuous fulminations against the uninspired.249 We also find Laugier to have been a modernist and a pioneer in the field of city planning. He was perhaps the first to see the defects of the plan of Paris.250 The most remarkable of his suggestions was the recommen- dation of a transverse road from the Porte Saint-Martin to the Porte Saint-Jacques.25' Furthermore, he pro- posed the erection of monumental and dignified entrance gates to the capital,252 such as were later carried out by Ledoux on the eve of the French Revolution. The con- cept of the Place de l'Etoile can be found in Laugier's first book, for which he suggested a large avenue lined with two or four rows of trees, terminating in a semi- circular piazza. In this square a Triumphal Arch was to be erected from which several streets were to radi- ate.253 He was proud of this scheme which posterity, he was certain, would carry out, as it did.254 In gen- eral, Laugier wanted decorative unity within the single blocks,255 although at the same time warning against too much uniformity and, in particular, against the monotony resulting from over-stressed rectangularity and parallelism (the gridiron plan) .256 We must note with interest that his idea of isolating outstanding build- ings antedated the theories of the nineteenth century by a hundred years.257 Much beauty was destroyed in old cities when these ideas were carried out and critics of the 1900's who found fault with these changes, were perhaps justified.258 Attempts to realize the new ideas in old surroundings were destined to be unsuccessful. Aesthetically satisfying solutions were not found until 248Essai, 206, "Je ne puis trop les exhorter a se faire des idees propres, a inventer, a donner du neuf." 249 Observations, 179, "Nous ne varions point assez les formes de nos edifices, nous qiii sommes variables en tout le reste . . . l'uniformite insipide regne dans leurs plans." 250 Essai, 209, "Nos villes sont un amas de maisons entassees pele-mele.

Laugier's suggestions 259 were not given serious con- sideration until 1793 when the Commission of Artists took up city planning.260 The modernization of Paris was at last realized under Napoleon III. JEAN-LAURENT LE GEAY Having studied the inception of the great change in architecture, let us now turn to Boullee's third teacher, Jean-Laurent Le Geay. It seems Boullee had pro- ceeded, as if on purpose, from the less modern archi- tects to this rather young artist, whose work fore- shadowed the very outbreak of the architectural revo- lution. With Le Geay's return from Rome,26' Charles- Nicolas Cochin declared that a new era of improved taste had begun. Le Geay had received the Grand Prix of the Academy of Architecture in Paris in 1732 but had not left for Rome until five years later,262 where he had remained from 1737 to 1742. In an obituary on the architect De Wailly, Andrieux, Secretary of the Academy, also remarked that the "renaissance of taste began with Le Jay," who knew how to impart grandeur to his schemes, and who helped to form the taste of the most famous modern architects, Boullee, Moreau, Peyre, and De Wailly.263 Joseph Lavallee, in his obituary on De Wailly, expressed the view that the builder of the Odeon in Paris derived from Le Geay's drawings- bizarre as they were-the idea of true architectural per- 259 Observations, 313, "II faudroit aligner et elargir presque toutes les rues . . . percer de nouvelles.

On vit changer sensiblement l'ecole d'architecture au grand etonnement de tous les archi- tectes anciens de l'Academ'ie." This passage is of extraordinary significance for art history. It tells of the rise of a new epoch, and presents a forgotten artist of great influence. 262Acad. roy. d'architecture, Proces-verbaux, ed. Henry Le- monnier, 5: 96, 104, Paris, 1911 f.

Tomb among ruins. fection.64 This brief reference to the oddity of Le Geay's designs reveals that Le Geay had not returned from Italy simply as a convert of Neo-classicism. There must have been other elements in his designs or in his ideas, which, according to Cochin, perplexed the old men of the Academy in Paris. Perhaps we can learn what these elements may have been from Le Geay's etchings published in 1767-1768, but created, probably, in his Roman years, as their subject matter, the Italian titles, and the Italianized Christian names, Giovan Lo- renzo, intimate. In spite of the differences of spelling-Le Geay, Le Jai, Lejay-I believe that the author of the etchings,265 264 Lavallee, Joseph, Notice hist. sur Ch. Dewailly, 7, Paris, 1799, "ce ne fut que chez I'architecte le Jai qu'il parvint a decouvrir, a travers les exagerations de ce nouveau maitre, le veritable point de perfection dans 1'Architecture dont il avait le pressentiment." 265 Cf.

M., Recueil, 1765, contains rather tame etchings by Le Geay. More interesting are the the prize-winner of 1732, the teacher exalted in obitu- aries, was that architect who worked in Germany, chiefly for Frederick the Great. Charles-Francois Viel de Saint-Maux reports that Le Jai, architect to the King of Prussia, had numerous pupils in Paris.266 It is curious that an artist, distinguished in his youth as Le Geay was by the Grand Prix, later a famous teacher in the French capital and recognized outside of France, left no further trace behind him. Viel gives this ex- latter's views of ancient Rome, and a view of the Hedwigskirche, Berlin, signed "J. Legeay del et sculp." About this church cp.

Whether this was for some unknown personal reason, or because of his eccentricity as an artist, the sources do not say. Le Geay seems to have been a quarrelsome man who had left the services of the King of Prussia and the Duke of Mecklenburg because of some differences. To help the disheartened artist, Bezout, a member of the Acad- emy of Sciences, procured a position for him as a draw- ing teacher in a boarding school conducted by Bene- dictine monks in the provinces. In 1786, from a castle near Narbonne, Le Geay appealed to the Duke of Meck- lenburg for assistance so that he might spend his last years in Rome. Even if Le Geay had not been the teacher of Boullee, we would feel impelled to comment on his etchings. They should not remain unnoticed in this introduction to revolutionary architecture, for they tell us much about the new trends. We find in them the evidence of a strong personality reminiscent of Gianbattista Piranesi. Was there any connection between the two architects? We know that Piranesi, after his arrival in Rome in 1740, suddenly changed his style, passing from the com- posed representations of his Prima parte di architetture to the dramatic manner of the Carceri and Capricci.267 We also know that he had many contacts with the artists of the French colony. It is very probable that the al- 267 Cf. Giesecke, Albert, G. B. Piranesi, 11, 75, Leipzig, 1912. ready renowned Le Geay had influenced the younger Venetian architect and it may be that the famous Pira- nesi style could better be termed the Le Geay style. The etchings of both men are similarly fantastic. With all their excitement they are symptomatic of the crucial moment in architectural history reflected in the writings of the theorists. Le Geay's Fontane, Vasi, Tombeaux, Rovine clearly reveal a state of restlessness. Some vases attract our attention not only by their extravagant forms, but even more by their disproportionate sizes.268 Often the whimsical effect results from an accumulation of in- congruous features. In the Tomb among Ruins we see relief panels hung on fluted pilasters in a most inconsistent manner (fig. 8). Two Tombs are com- FIG. 10.

In the etching, Christ at the Well of Samaria, a lever of extraordinary dimensions is depicted, apparently for the purpose of lifting the water bucket. Evidently the artist did not think of devising a practicable machine, but seems to have felt the need to visualize some unbalanced force. The lever most assuredly is far too big to be handled by the woman 271 (fig. 12). Leaving Le Geay's weird visions, I should like to quote a last contemporary voice. In 1778 the archi- tect Franqois-Michel Lecreulx 272 noted that architec- ture had changed in the past fifteen years. Grandeur and boldness had become characteristic; decoration had FIG. 11.

II. THE MAN Etienne-Louis Boullee, born in Paris, February 12. 1728,276 was the son of Claude-Louis, expert-jure' des baitiments du roi,277 and his first wife, Marie-Louise, nee Boucher.278 Boullee's life and activity seem to have been confined to the capital and its environs. That he was never in Italy we know from contemporary sources.279 The father wanted him to become an archi- tect and to learn drawing, and with this in mind en- rolled him in the studio of the painter Pierre.

Despite his progress as a painter, Boullee was forced by his father to take up architecture and to attend the classes of Blondel. In 1746 he became a pupil of Boff- rand, after that of Lebon, and Le Geay.282 He regretted even to his old age, that he had to abandon his original vocation and is reported to have cultivated friendships with many painters. It is said that he persuaded a promising student to forsake architecture and to study painting with David, under whose guidance the young man became one of the foremost painters of his time. (Our source gives only his initial, G; it may have been Antoine-Jean Gros, or, perhaps, Francois Gerard, or Anne-Louis Girodet.283) At the early age of eighteen Boullee began his own career as a teacher at the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees. According to Villar, he taught with great enthusiasm and imparted his enthusiasm to the students: "II s'at- tachoit 'a les penetrer de la chaleur qui le transportoit lui-meme." 284 When several chapels of Saint-Roch in Paris were to be redecorated in 1753, he was called to do the architectural work.285 Some historians report that the sculptor in charge of the entire project, the famous Etienne-Maurice Falconet, made Boullee and the painter Jean-Baptiste Pierre his assistants.286 A contemporary writer relates that Jacques-Germain Souf- flot, having recommended Boullee, was full of praise and when he saw the designs, "il y a trouve du ge- nie." 287 In spite of Soufflot's favorable opinion, how- ever, the parson of Saint-Roch asked for other designs. Boullee proceeded to make inferior drawings to empha- size the fitness of his original ideas for this project. When the inferior designs were accepted, he refused to carry them out, declaring that his aim was not to receive the commission. He was afraid that the second designs would not do him justice.288 We do not know what the final arrangement of the three chapels, of the Virgin, the Communion, and the Calvary, owes to Boullee. He may well be responsible 281 Villar, 43. 282 Papiers, fol. 38, obituary, records how Boullee became Blondel's pupil.

One of his ideas was to have the light falling directly upon the praying Sainte-Genevieve as the central figure in a large painting.289 In his later works, and in his writings we find him particularly fond of such romantic effects. In February 1762 Boullee submitted to the Royal Academy of Architecture a perspective drawing of a proposed Royal Mint (Hotel des Monnoyes), to be erected on the Quai de Conti. The Academy was pleased with it and asked him to work out the plans and details.290 But it was Jacques-Denis Antoine who was finally entrusted with the work, six years later. In February, and again in June 1762, Boullee was a candidate for second-class membership of the Academy; he was admitted in August.29' In 1764, according to the historian Gustave Macon, he was called in by Louis Joseph, Prince de Conde, acting on the recommenda- tion of Soufflot, in connection with the renovation of the Palais Bourbon.292 Again Boullee was rejected and the commission was given to Gabriel Barreau.293 The only private residence by Boullee that won fame was the Hotel de Brunoy, built in 1772 between the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honore and the Champs-Elysees. Its appearance has been preserved for posterity in a great many engravings and has frequently been described, erroneously, as the achievement of another architect. From the Marquis de Brunoy the house passed to the American Leavenworth,294 about 1800. In 1773 the financier Beaujon bought the neighboring Hotel d'Ev- reux which for a time had been owned by Madame de Pompadour, and today is known as the Palais Elysee.

In this capacity he was in charge of the interior arrangement of the Count's apartment in the Temple, and of similar work for the Countess in the H6tel des Ecuries, at the corner of the rue de Bourbon (today, de Lille) and the rue des Saints-Peres.297 In 1780 he worked out a plan for the alteration of the prison of La Petite-Force between the rues de Sevigne and Pavee. Upon the request of the Minister of Fi- nance, Necker, the Academy examined his designs and approved them. It is not known whether Boullee or Pierre Desmaisons carried out the structure as it is illustrated and described in Saint-Victor's topographical work.298 In 1780 Boullee took part in a competition for the remodeling of the Palace of Versailles. Neither his designs, which are still extant in the Bibliotheque, nor any others were used.299 In the early 1780's he built the following h6tels: Alexandre, often called de Colanges, after a later owner, between the rues de la Ville-l'Eveque and de Suresne; Demonville, rue d'An- jou; Pernon, Chaussee d'Antin; and Thun, at the corner of the same street and the rue de Provence.300 Prior to 1787 he designed a salon in the Hdtel de Tourolle, between the rues d'Orleans and Charlot.30' When in the mid-eighties the H6tel de la Compagnie des Indes, at the corner of rue Vivienne and rue des Petits-Champs, was transformed into the Bourse of Paris, Boullee added an arcade and side pavilions to the fa?ade.302 Boullee had bad luck in the few large projects he hoped to be entrusted with.

Funerailles mentions the transformation. commissions for the Mint; there was never a chance for him to realize the plans for Versailles, the Chateau of Saint-Germain-en-Laye,303 or the Church of the Made- leine.304 Neither did he succeed in a project that was particularly dear to him, the erection of a new building for the Royal Library. About 1780 the Count d'Angi- villers asked Boullee to work out plans for such an edifice. It proved to be too large and the architect then devised plans for the adaptation of an already existing hall. He wanted to give it extraordinary monumental- ity by finishing it with a gigantic barrel vault, and by terminating it with triumphal arches at both ends. This project is described in his Mermoire sur les moyens de procurer a la Bibliotheque du Roi les avantages que ce monument exige, which appeared in 1785. There are several designs for it in the Bibliotheque Nationale. One of these, representing the entrance front, bears the date 1788. A model of the library was put on ex- hibition in 1790.305 A rather unimportant commission given by the Minister of Finance was for the improve- ment of the bridge near the Place Louis XV (de la Concorde) 306 According to Michaud, Biographie universelle,307 Boullee built, or rebuilt, several chateaux in the en- virons of Paris: Chateau Tasse at Chaville (Seine-et- Oise); Chateau Chauvri at Montmorency (Seine-et- Oise); and Chateau du Pereux at Nogent-sur-Marne. I have not been able to find any trace of them. During the Revolution, Boullee was the target of a malicious attack. In 1794, on the nineteenth of Germi- nal of the second year of the Republic, hostile and apparently envious artists posted a libel against an alleged faction among the jury des arts, headed by Boullee, "that foolish architect." He, as well as Le- doux, Le Roy, and the sculptor Dardel, was denounced as sympathizing with the Royalists.308 This we learn from a copy of the poster preserved among the papers of Lequeu in the Bibliotheque Nationale.309 The latter scarcely was the author of this attack; he may have 303 Boullee on this project, Papiers, fols. 86, 104-106.

SOC. simply kept the copy because it mentioned his teacher Le Roy.310 Boullee, whose custom it was to attend the meetings of the Academy with great regularity, was also one of the nine academicians present at its final session on August 5, 1793.311 In 1795 he became a member of the newly-formed Institut de France, and was nomi- nated Professor of Architecture at the Ecoles Cen- trales.312 On the seventeenth of Pluviose of the year VII (February 6, 1799) the artist, who had remained unmarried,313 died at his home in Montmartre, rue des Fosses, of a painful illness.314 A note by a certain B- Boullee's pupil Benard 315-"aux auteurs du Journal" gives the architect's last words: Je souffre beaucoup . . . je sens que je ne peu[x] pas revenir, et je voi[s] arriver la mort avec tranquil[l] ite." On the following day Boullee was buried. The funeral oration was pro- nounced by Baudin (des Ardennes), a membJer of the Institut.316 Apart from these fixed dates of Boullee's biography, the sources give a clear picture of his personality. From the protocols of the Academy we learn that he took an eaiger interest in its activities, urlike Ledoux who rarely attended its meetings. As a member of various com- mittees, we find Boullee continually busied with the Academy's problems. Education, technique, internal organization, public building, all these were matters for the Academy. A brief account of his participation in the routine of the Academy is interesting, and inci- dentally throws some light upon many of its functions. In 1763 Boullee suggested certain changes in the rules of admission for students. The Academy disapproved of these changes.317 He was several times a member of the committee that chose the themes for the Grands Prix,318 and among the jurors who decided on the dis- tribution of the prizes,319 or examined the work done 310 Boullee would appear as a partisan of the Revolution, if it could be ascertained that he was the co-author of the leaflet in the British Museum, Boulee (sic) et Damoye, Petition pre'sentee au Directoire executif et au Ministre des Finances par les acquereurs du ci-devant Chateau de Chantilly, n. p., n. d., claim- ing, 4, "ayant touj ours donne des temoignages de patriotisme pendant la revolution, ayant lie notre existence a la cause sacree de la liberte, nous avons cru pouvoir mieux que d'autres nous presenter pour l'acquisition d'un domaine que le royalisme, touj ours esperant, sembloit envisager comme mis en reserve pour la contre-revolution." 311 Proces 9: xxx, 349. 312Papiers, fol. 33, draft in Boullee's handwriting (cf. note 419).

Boullee was one of the academicians consulted in such major cases as the reorganization of the Louvre galleries in 1785,325 the examination of the condition of the Pont Rouge be- tween the Cite and the Ile-Saint-Louis; 326 the plans made by Philippe de la Guepiere for the theatre of Stuttgart, 1763-1764; 327 the layout of the Place Peyrou at Montpellier by Fran?ois Franque, 1765; 328 the de- signs for the Chateau of Coblence by Michel d'Ixnard, 1779; 329 the doming of the Paris Halle au ble, pro- posed by Jacques-Guillaume Legrand and Jacques Molinos, 1783; 330 Ledoux' projects for Aix-en-Pro- vence, 1785; 331 the reconstruction of the Cathedral of Rennes, 1785; 332 the designs for the Madeleine Church by Guillaunie-Martin Couture, 1786; 333 and those for an academy building at Bordeaux by Louis Combes, 1788.334 Villar credits Boullee with great conscientiousness in regard to all commissions, and with neither receiving nor giving favors. The obituary in the Gazette Na- tionale mentions that the contract for work at the Palais Bourbon was not awarded to Boullee because, in his scrupulousness, he declared that he could not figure out the probable expense in less than three months.335 The same necrologist lauds his brilliant fantasy and his uprightness: "l'imagination brillante 320 Ibid. 8: 337, etc. 321 Ibid. 8: 321-330. 322 Ibid. 9: 52, 156, 207. 323Ibid. 7: 241. 324Ibid. 9: 323. 325Ibid. 9: 170, 358. 326 Ibid. 9: 265. 327 Ibid. 7 151, 176. 328 Ibid. 7: 231, 234. 329 Ibid. 8: 385, 386. 330Ibid. 9: 117. 331 Ibid. 9: 163. 332 Ibid. 9: 144, 150. 333 Ibid. 9: 191. 334Ibid. 9: 232.

I will not pause over other obituary items which ap- peared in his praise, but, considering his life and work as a whole, I am inclined to agree with Boullee's self- appraisal in l'Architecture: Le vrai bonheur consiste dans. l'amour de ses devoirs. . . . Cet ouvrage a ete commence et acheve sans autre motif que celui de satisfaire au besoin du travail que j'ai contractle toute ma vie. . . 336 Domine par un amour ex- cessif de mon art, je m'y suis entierement livre.337 That he loved his art with a "passion impe'rieuse" appeared in a draft of an anonymous obituary recount- ing the architect's habit of getting up during the night and setting down on paper the ideas that had come to him in sleepless hours.338 That he was too advanced to be fully understood by his contemporaries was stated more than twenty years after Boullee's death not in one of the customary post mortem eulogies, but by a sober lexicographer: "Boullee fit revolution dans son art; mais il lui manquait un grand siecle et un grand em- pire." 339 The invective in the poster of 1794 was dictated, to all appearances, by envy of Boullee and the men around him, with the probable purpose of denouncing them to the authorities. But we know of another attack, no less venomous, contained in a document of great value for art history; the pamphlet Decadence de l'Architec- ture, of 1800,340 by the architect Charles-Franqois Viel de Saint-Maux, pupil of Chalgrin. Viel abhorred the modern ways, contrary to Blondel, who watched with much concern what was going on in architecture. In the critical spirit of the era Viel assailed the revolu- tionaries, though formerly he himself in his Letters (1787),341 had inveighed against the established styles, 336 Papiers, fol. 47. 337 Ibid., fol. 70. Here, he speaks also of his "passion im- perieuse." Fol. 125, "c'est 'a l'amour de mon art que je dois mon inspiration."

He had been in sympathy with the revolutionary Le Geay and con- trariwise had abused the late Blondel as a "charlatan" who sided with the Classicists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. He had disparaged Vitruvius and his followers who preferred his unintelligible text to nature, to reason, and to the great works of the past. Viel had censured Leone Battista Alberti who repre- sented, in his opinion, an architecture in which line- the Italian theorists would have. said il disegno-and sensuous beauty of matter were emphasized, rather than plain simplicity, the consistent use of materials, and spiritual qualities. (Here we note the Romanticist contradicting the Rationalist.) Buildings should be symbols, according to Viel, not merely models of regu- larity and proportion. He had characterized his period by the significant word, already used by Blondel, in- certitude. In his actual building, too, he was inclined toward the modern, as seen in his H6pital Cochin (Saint-Jacques du Haut-Pas) of 1780, with its gigantic portal 342 (fig. 13). Towards the end of the century Viel reversed his position. Perhaps disillusioned, he turned reactionary; perhaps he was the villain in the drama of the revolu- qu'Alberti admet dans l'Architectu.e ?" 7: 19, L'Artiste doit s'eever contre la profusion des materiaux." 7: 26, "on doit au public une decoration exterieure, oii la noble simplicite carac- terise et l'Artiste et le sage emploi des materiaux." 7: 47, note 15, "Jean [sic] Francois Blondel, Artiste qu'on peut considerer comme le charlatan de l'Architecture.

AMER. PHIL. SOC. tionary architecture-always against the successful. In any case, in the Decadence, Viel saw his task as passing judgment on the -reformers of architecture. He attacked the modern exaggerations with vehemence. If nothing were left of late eighteenth-century architecture and ar- chitectural criticism but this publication by Viel, we should know that there existed an Architecture of the Revolution. The essay is an indictment: an enumera- tion and description of the sins committed, in Viel's opinion, by the modernists. Thus, the first prosecutor of the Architecture of the Revolution became, involun- tarily, its first historiographer. Alarmed by what he termed decadence in the contemporary architectural scene, Viel wrote: Jamais les causes generales et particulieres de decadence de l'architecture n'agirent avec plus d'activite qu'aujourd' hui . . . jamais l'art de batir n'a et plus altere qu'il est de nos jours.343 We cannot take up in detail here Viel's criticisms of the abuses by the moderns; the discrepancies and dis- proportions,344 Exoticism and Gothicism.45 But I should like to stress that he was not aiming at the mas- ters of the Rococo-detrimental as their methods seemed to him. Still in his Principes (1797) his attacks were directed merely against the Gothic and against Borro- mini, Guarini, Meissonnier, Lajoue and Oppenort, but now, in the Defcadence, he was aiming at his contempo- raries, at the architects of the Revolution.346 He did not refrain from pointing out the chief culprits. The end of the century, he remarked, had seen the rise of two upstarts: the one famous for his ruinous enter- prises, the other for the multitude of designs engen- dered by a disorderly mind. Their evil spirit, Viel felt, had distracted others from the only meritorious study, Antiquity, and had brought about the abomi- nable "revolution in building." They were guilty of having fostered a new type of architect, eager to play a role in society and proclaim that he alone knew the 343Decadence, 5, 23. 344 Ibid., 7, "un plan oii les loix memes de la symetrie sont violees et sur lequel s'elevent des constructions gigantesques surmontees par des parties de petites dimensions; la ce sont de foibles supports couronnes par de lourdes murailles, ailleurs les ordres y sont denatures; les profils y sont en opposition et en un discord complet avec l'ordonnance qu'ils enrichissent et entre leurs propres membres.

Decadence, 8, "Le dix-huitieme siecle est remarquable par deux periodes egalement fatales a l'architec- ture." The first "detrimental period" was that of "les Lajoue et les Oppenort," the second was to the contemporary the era of a "true revolution," as the next note will show as well as a passage in Principes, 250, "Jamais, a la verite, les arts n'ont eprouve de plus violentes secousses que celles dont nous sommes les temoins, et l'Architecture y a et soumise particulierement." truly grand manner.347 These architects ruled in the juries and occupied places which they did not deserve. In spite of the praise bestowed upon them, the enlight- ened observer could find no trace of beauty in their works. Because of their sterility they could not attain perfection.348 The "ruinous" architect was obviously Ledoux; the maker of a "multitude of designs of unbridled fancy," Boullee. Soon we shall see that these two artists were anything but sterile. The Decadence sheds more light on the architectural situation at about 1800 than any other written record. It tells of the great role the revolutionary architects played for a short time, and of the narrow-mindedness that was to delay the further development of architec- ture. Viel himself was to share the fate of those whom he assailed. He, too, fell into oblivion. Boullee's obituary in the Gazette Nationale mentions as his particular friend the renowned painter Vien, the "Nestor of the arts." 349 Boullee's friend and pupil, Benard, was given a life interest in the manuscript and drawings which Boullee bequeathed to the nation. (This may have been Joseph Benard, the prize winner of 1774, Charles-Joachim Benard who got the better of Ledoux in the competition for the theatre of Mar- seille, or the Benard who built the Timbre National.350) 347Dcadence, 8, "Le meme siecle, vers sa fin a vu paroitre deux architectes trop celebres: l'un, par l'6tendue de ses entre- prises ruineuses; l'autre par la multitude de ses dessins, produits d'une imagination vagabonde et dereglee.

Villar apologizes for him, saying that the architect left no monumental work worthy of him, but that only lack of opportunity was to blame.35 Never- theless, the anonymous obituary in the Gazette Nationale reveals that the artist was appreciated during his life- time.35 Its author grasped Boullee's significance, as this passage points out: 351 The names of the pupils are taken from these sources.

Born at a moment when architecture had fallen back into infancy, he had to overcome the taste of the day and to purge architecture from its ridiculous forms.354 The three private residences by Boullee, known to us through old engravings, seem not to be very original. The H6tel Alexandre had a porch with four Ionic col- umns and a balcony in front of the attic.355 The H6tel Demonville was a similar simple building with an hexa- style porch and with rich interior decoration. Its Salon a la Turque was designed to simulate a pavilion with a view into an Oriental garden.356 Even the H6tel Bru- noy, highly praised by contemporaries and represented on the first plate of the engravings of Krafft and Ran- sonette, seems at first glance to have little individual character 357 (fig. 14). And yet the architect Nicolas Goulet was right in remnarking that Boullee, in design- ing it, paid, little attention to convention, but rather followed his own imagination.358 In each house the 354 "Ne dans un temps oii l'architecture etait retombee dans l'enfance, il eut a vaincre le gofit regnant, et a purger son art des formes ridicules et tourmentees que l'ignorance avait mises en usage." 355 Musee Carnavalet, Paris, etching, dossier 135 G.

(According to the description given in Thiery's guidebook, Boullee finished the Paris Bourse also with a small attic story.359) We find, more- over, on the three houses, porches with excessively high columns. The harmonious equilibrium of old had dis- appeared. Boullee's uniqueness can best be seen in his drawings and the manuscript of his Architecture bequeathed by him to the nation. Both are preserved in the Biblio- theque Nationale in, Paris. Since in these drawings Boullee constantlv sought new goals, let us take them 359 Thiery, Guide 1: 292. as a first starting point for discussion and later see how his ideas found expression in his text. There is only one design in which we find Boullee tied to the ancien regime and baroque inl style. It rep- resents the sumptuous circular hall of a Musee Fran- cais, with the legend Dcdie au Roi and the statue of Louis XVI in the center, inscribed on the pedestal REGI BENEFICO 360 (fig. 15). Most of the projects, however, are distinguished by monumentality combined with simplicity. The unbroken long stretch of wall of the Assembly Hall, inscribed with the headline Droits de l'homme, is impressive by its solemnity. The free- standing tall columns on either side add greatly to the monumentality of the composition 361 (fig. 16). Truly 360 Bibl. Nat., Cab. Estampes, Ha 56, no. 47.

The most impressive of these designs is the proposed Newton Memorial, 1784, which consists of a sphere ris- ing from a circular structure 366 (fig. 22). This Me- morial, as well as the conic Cenotaph is surrounded by rows of trees on different levels, probably to alleviate the sternness of the whole. The interior of this Me- morial is empty, except for the sarcophagus: nothing is to distract the eye (fig. 23). The curvature alone, with- out beginning, without end, is to dominate. The light- ing is to be effected through tiny star-shaped openings grouped like celestial constellations. With evident pride, Boullee wrote that all this was his own invention.367 362 Ibid., Ha 55, no. 28, Chapelle des morts, Kaufmann, E.-L. Boullee, Art Bulletin 21: fig. 7, 1939.

Boullee, it would seem, was interested in geometrical forms rather than intent upon copying ancient models, whether Egyptian pyramids or Roman amphitheatres. This predilection is even more apparent in the ground plans of his Opera House which is a cylindrical build- ing with a domical vault 368 (figs. 24, 25).

The outer col- onnades were to extend beyond the garden faqade and terminate in cubic pavilions. On second thought, Boul- le'e wanted also to change the front facing the Place d'Armes, by replacing the Cour Royale and the Cour de Marbre with a single oblong screened court 371 (fig. 27 ). To relieve the monotony of the long-stretched front he meant to add gigantic columns on each side of the palace, after the model of Trajan's column 372 (fig. 28).

All of his other designs with classical features are not mere copies of earlier examples, but rather para- phrases, with a personal note-the circular Opera House, the afore-cited projects for a huge circus intended for the Place de l'Etoile, the circular Public Library 374 (fig. 29), the Triumphal Arch with Aisles (fig. 30), and the Triumphal Arch with Inscription (fig. 31) deviate noticeably from the conventional.

We find, for example, in the square plan 376 as well as in the elevation 377 of the Museum the new motif of repetition in the four porticoes echoing the cylindrical Temple of Fame (Temple a la Renommee), which emerges from the center of the cubic substructure 375B.

The interior, 1789, is striking by its boldness and dramatic lighting (fig. 34). The artistic effect will be greater when not merely single features are called into play, but when the masses themselves begin to speak with their stronger voices. Then a de- sign results like the Metropole, planned on the Greek cross and crowned with a conventional dome above its center 378 (fig. 35). What distinguishes this project is the dome towering high and lonely above the whole, totally unrelated to the four porticoes. The interior of the Metropole is remarkable by its extraordinary dimen- sions. Boullee represents it at nocturnal rites, and a second time at the celebration of Corpus Christi (fig. 36). The Opera house on a Square is a group of three structures. The central rotunda and the two independ- 378 B.

Triumphal arch with inscription. ent blocks are most starkly set apart and have nothing in common with each other 379 (fig. 37). Eventually the classical forms diminished in impor- tance; modern patterns began to play the foremost role, supported, at last, by modern forms. These advanced designs no longer look like daring experiments, but like well realizable projects. The simple juxtaposition of the four tall prismatic projections is enough to impart artistic character to Boullee's City Gate with Four Towers 380 (fig. 38). The elements here are independ- ent and equivalent without any one part ruling. The motif of repetition, shown so vigorously in the verticals, reappears, subdued, in the horizontals of the duplicated roof line and the stepped bases. The erormous nude walls derive overwhelming grandeur from an almost primitive arrangement of the masses. The drawing of this gate also illustrates how Boullee translated his the- ory of architectural chiar-oscuro into practice. (I shall deal with Boullfee's theory later.) The shadows cast 379 B.

In the City Gate with Cannons, the architect sets a frieze of warriors over the arch and places cannons in front of the side towers (fig. 39). The groups of people at the gate powerfully emphasize its magnitude. The frieze of the warriors may be interpreted as "Narrative" architecture. The warriors represent vigilance; they are the guardians of the city. In addition, the horizontal array has also a definite formal significance. The crenelated roof line, the brack- ets below it, the horizontal layers of the podium (to which the voussoirs of the mighty arch form a superb contrast) repeat, with varied intensity, the line of the ground. The concept of horizontalism reaches a climax in the frieze of the warriors. The stressed horizontals, not the traditional features, are the chief characteristics of the Palace of Justice (fig. 40) and a Square Temple (fig. 41) which is beautiful FIG 33 Museum view- Mu seum destine c. contenir les statues des Grands-H--mes- FIG. 33.

On the library facade with the pedimented portal the latter is contrasted both with the small niches with statues and the long stretched cornices (fig. 43). The central motif of the other library fa?ade (with the date 1788 on the wall) is the portal flanked by two Atlantes carrying a mighty globe, which is markedly set off the neutral background (fig. 44). There is, in all these, an antithetical effect: the flatness of the wall is opposed to the spatiality of the central motif.

Library in three zones: the basic zone of the bookstacks in three receding steps echoing the semi-cylindrical ceil- ing; the intruding zone of Ionic columns in solemn ar- ray; and the lofty zone of the coffered barrel vault opening into an enormous skylight 384 (fig. 45). The three zones are set off against each other in size and shape, and contrast in texture. The ground zone is agitated, its texture derived from the display of the books. The middle zone presents the rigidity and cool- ness of unfluted shafts. The top zone with its caissons is full of explosiveness which finds an outlet in the light-giving cleavage. Boullee populates the hall with readers in various poses, reaching for books or con- versing. He wants to exalt the work of stone over the human activity-the enduring over the temporal. It matters little that the Library is full of practical shortcomings. The drawing is the direct expression of Boullee's artistic will; is an end in itself. We should look at all the designs of the revolutionary architects from this point of view: their true meaning is form for form's sake. It might be interesting to note here that in commenting on his Opera House, Boullee him- 384 B. N., Ha 56, no. 36, Salle de lecture, signed.

The former is a classicized edifice, somewhat similar to the Paris Panthe'on 386 (fig. 46) ; the Town Hall, designed in 1792, however, contains almost no reminiscences of the past 387 (fig. 47). It consists of a low cube from 385 Papiers, fol. 104, "que ce fussent eux (les spectateurs) qui decorassent ma salle . . . en formassent le principal ornement." 386 B.

Moreover, on the walls a second, more refined pattern appears. This consists of two rows of windows, one below the roof line, the other at a considerable dis- tance down, very close to the ground.

The sarcophagus in relation to the vaulting is so small that no real impression of contrasted sizes can result. It is rather the skilful ar- rangement of the whole which produces the effect of an all-pervading tension. The tiny sarcophagus at the bottom is the only object in the immense room, and from any point of the infinite sphere the eye ever re- turns to it. The room becomes a vast magnetic field traversed by innumerable lines of force. By an extra- ordinarily simple compositional device, the void lives.88 388 B. N., Ha 57, no. 8.

Madeleine church, proj ect. In this interior of the Newton Memorial no longer is there that balance of power which was essential to classic and Baroque architecture, unifying and har- monizing the dominant and the subordinate parts. Here we have the irreconcilable contrasts of the small and the large, the finite and the infinite, the mortal and the immortal. Plain elementary forms and austere composition are first in Boullee's designs. The touch of Romanticism results chiefly from the graphic treatment. The archi- tectural form itself is not meant to express any mood, and is free from shallow symbolism. Both Boullee and Lecamus de Mezieres (with whom I cannot deal more extensively here),389 are architecturally-minded in their buildings and literary in their doctrine. In analyzing Boullee's manuscript we shall find him an advocate of "Narrative" architecture. Yet though his text is full 389 See note 93. Work and thought of Le Camus will be dealt with in my Architecture in the Age of Reason. of passages reflecting the point of view of Romanticism, in his designs he was careful to retain the architectural forms untouched by sentimental accessories. IV. THE THINKER Boullee's Architecture forms only a part of the Papiers de Boulle'e of the Bibliotheque Nationale.390 These papers consist of one hundred and fifty folios as numbered by the notary Doulcet, who was in charge of the bequest. Several concern the death and the estate of the architect; others are obituaries, or drafts of obituaries; still others are miscellaneous notices of several sorts. The first hastily thrown together nota- tions for the layout of the Architecture begin on little cards on folio 40. On folio 46 begins the first systematic draft of the Architecture, when Boullee starts to use foolscap. The pages are full of cancellations and cor- rections. Folio 52 is the start of a second draft, neatly written and seemingly intended as final. Yet its pages, too, like those of the first draft, are left half blank, ob- viously for the purpose of further alterations. The pages of folios 52! to 60 are numbered 1 to 16. (Folio 55 is not included for it does not belong to Boullee's draft.) The pages of the succeeding folios, which con- tinue to folio 65, are unnumbered. Folios 66 and 68 are blanks. Folio 67 carries the legend that the manu- script which follows was written entirely by the de- ceased. The third, and final, version then begins with folio 69, titled and subtitled Architecture: Essai sur l'art, and with the quotation "Ed io anche son Pittore." The text actually begins on folio 70. It is very clearly, neatly written, and carefully ruled, without the wide margin allowed for correction. Clues for dating Boullee's manuscript and drawings, only some of which are signed, are scant. On folios 101-105 Boullee remarks that the sketch for the Palais d'un Souverain at Saint-Germain-en-Laye was made 390 See note 1. FIG. 47. Town hall-Palais municipal pour la capitale d'un grand empire.</page><page sequence="41">470 KAUFMANN: THREE REVOLUTIONARY ARCHITECTS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. long before there was any thought of the French Revo- lution, and he adds that the design, intended for Saint- Germain-en-Laie (sic!) could be used for some other purpose. On folio 109, in commenting on his draw- ing of the Palais Municipal, he notes his age as sixty- four, and thus dates this design in 1792. On the drawing of the entrance to the Royal Library the date 1788 can be read in an inscription the rest of which, probably intentionally, is illegible. Newton's Memorial is dated 1784; the interior of the Museum, 1789. The first draft of the Architecture must have been written in the 1790's, for on folio 47 there is a reference to the tragic events of the time: "attendant le moment fatal qui pouvoit me joindre au sort des malheureuses vic- times dejA immolees je me suis livre 'a ce que j'appelle ici mes delassements." Boull6e, like Ledoux, appears to have taken up the work on his text in the disturbed days of the Revolution. The second and third drafts were written in Boullee's last years. On folio 62 men- tion is made of the Institut, which had been founded in 1795, succeeding the Academy. On folio 54 Boullee refers to one of Napoleon's expeditions, which could only have been the Egyptian Campaign of 1798: "Je prends pour exemple l'expedition de Bonaparte. Ce grand general et les sWavans qui l'ont suivi apprendront au monde eritier l'art de former un grand etablissement." Boullee's Architecture is mature in its calm reserve; it is the summation of his experience; it reveals what he regarded as essential and permanently significant in his designs. With him, as with Ledoux, the writ- ten word was not a program antecedent to his work, but a clarification following it. Boullee expressed his artistic convictions in a dry, dogmatic idiom; Ledoux in words consonant with his passionate temperament. The text begins with a pedantic discussion of a dif- ference of opinion between Claude Perrault and Fran- cois Blondel, i.e., whether architecture should be a free creation of the imagination or should derive its funda- mental principles from nature.391 Boullee favored the closest relation to nature. However, we need not linger over this somewhat scholastic disquisition. It is only our interest to uncover first, his goals as a teacher; second, his attitude towards tradition; third, what spe- cific currents of thought of the period are reflected in his composition; and last, and most important to us, how he himself intended to reform architecture. As a teacher, Boullee, like Blondel, emphatically states that a clear distinction must be made between the art of architecture and the technique of building. Only by doing this can one comprehend why art has made little progress.392 It was his belief that the textbooks up to this time had been gravely mistaken in paying little 391 Papiers, fols. 40, 71, 77. 3921bid., fol. 40, "L'objet de cette partie est de ne plus con- fondre en architecture l'art proprement dit avec la science . . . ensuite de faire appercevoir ce qui jusqu'a present a pu retarder le progres de cet art." attention to "art proper"-"l'art proprement dit." 393 With much human warmth he calls his beloved craft ;he "beneficent art"-"l'art bienfaiteur." 394 True ar- chitecture, he feels, springs from a creative inspira- tion,395 while building is merely a mechanical proce- dure.396 The architect should strive for the sublime,397 and the architect-teacher must present more than hard and fast rules. He must teach his art as he himself conceives it.398 What was Boullee's attitude toward tradition? It is a far cry from those who, with superstitious awe per- sist in the sterile theory of the classical orders, to the artist to whom teaching was a mission with ever chang- ing goals. The orders, of course, are no longer dealt with in Boulle's treatise. What is more: Boullee, who disdains traditional knowledge, likewise has little re- spect for the old masters. The past does not bind him. He believes architecture to be only in its beginnings.899 He is not afraid to declare that the great men of the age of Louis Quatorze, Perrault and the elder Blondel, had no idea of the fundamentals.400 Eventually, he even apologizes for having followed the conventional arrange- ment of Italian palaces, with the preeminent bel-etage above the groundfloor, and the emphasis on the center. Practical necessity was the consideration for recom- mending the obsolete scheme.401 Had this necessity not hampered him, he would have chosen a quite different facade disposition. Instead of projections and recesses, he preferred large intervals between the single features. This appeared to him the right way to produce "move- ment," 402 ("tension" would be a better term to distin- guish between the Baroque and the revolutionary man- 393Ibid., fol. 72. 394 Ibid., fol. 52. 395 Ibid., fol. 70, "II faut concevoir pour effectuer.

It is not good to tread in other's steps, Boullee thinks.403 The Greek temples he finds are without character; one looks like the other. Nor does Saint Peter's at Rome make any impression on him.404 The Colosseum seems to him majestic, but its decoration in bad taste.405 His own Arch with Inscription (fig. 31), however, is different from all arches of the past. I believe it sur- passes in greatness Francois Blondel's famous Porte Saint-Denis, Chalgrin's Arc de triomphe de l'Etoile, and even many ancient arches.406 It means little that Boullee occasionally praises symmetry. The heritage of the past could not be entirely dropped at a moment's notice. Symmetry, especially, is so closely connected to the "architecture" of the human body, that it will forever appear to men "natural." Eventually, Boullee explains symmetry in a rationalistic manner,407 even- tually, he finds in it the greatest beauty.408 As to the major trends of the period, Eclecticism, fruit of the historical interests of the time, appears only sporadically in the Architecture. Boullee often thought of combining "Greek beauty" with Gothic construc- tion.409 Rather conspicuous in his text are the trends towards individualism, or, equality of the elements, and toward expressiveness, or "Narrative" architecture. He explains that in designing the Palace of a Sovereign for Saint-Germain-en-Laye, he avoided exalting it over the adjacent houses of the noblemen by different decoration, or by different height.410 He wants each structure to be complete in itself.41' Like Boffrand, he expects "character" to show in the building,412 and he, too, 403Ibid., fol. 110, "Ce n'est pas en se trainant sur les traces des autres qu'un auteur parvient a se faire distinguer, dans les beaux-arts." 404 Ibid., fol. 142, "Leurs temples ont tous, a peu pres, la meme forme." On fol. 138 is the warning, "de ne pas rester . . . esclave ... des anciens." Fol. 142, on St. Peter's, "On n'epreuve dans ce Temple aucune sensation relative 'a son etendue." Similarly, fol. 91. This was remarked by many; characteristic of Boullee is that he expects emotion from the structure. 405 Ibid., fol. 111. 406 B.

The drawing of the Palace, Ha 56, no. 22, is damaged and cannot be reproduced. 411 Ibid., fol. 106, "J'ai conqu ce projet de maniere que chacque Palais, vu separement, presentat un ensemble qui peut plaire particulierement." This is, one of Boullee's most significant statements. 412Ibid., fol. 84, "Les tableaux en architecture se produisent, en donnant au sujet que l'on traite le caractere propre d'oi nait l'effet relatif." cherishes the vague ideal of "poesy in art." 413 Soon we shall see how he hoped to attain these ends. Boullee's more concrete concepts for the reform of architecture are revealed in the brief headings: "De l'essence des corps-De leurs proprietes-De leur ana- logic avec notre organisation." 414 The appearance of the architectural masses is the important thing for him -in other words, the architectural form. His state- ment that regular forms are most concordant with our human constitution 415 can be regarded as pure theoriz- ing; the immediately following praise of the form of the exact sphere for its magnificent beauty-"magnifique beaute' 416 reflects the artist's basic convictions. Boul- lee never tires of emphasizing the majesty of the sphere, the grace of its outline, the regularity of its gradations from light to dark.417 But it was not with the sphere alone that he tried to satisfy his demand for elementary forms. He saw new possibilities in all regular solids. Elementary geometry as the basis of architectural design was to find a champion in him: Tired of the emptiness and sterility of the irregular forms, I have passed to the study of the regular. . . . These cap- tivate by simplicity, regularity, and reiteration.418 A further very interesting "Note" appears in folio 33 of the Papiers. This "Note ecrite de la main de feu Cen [Citoyen] Boullee," as we read on a slip, folio 32, apparently was intended as a draft of a letter to a pub- lisher, or a preface to his book, and reads: The Citizen Boullee, a professor of architecture at the Ecoles Centrales, guided by the love of his art, has spent his, lifetime to promote its progress. In studying nature he has developed a new theory of masses.419 It would be doing the architects of the Revolution an injustice if one believed that they were occupied solely with experimentation and theories. The task of a Boul- lee was not merely to search out new forms but also, and primarily, to discover their artistic effect: "By ana- lyzing the specific qualities of the solids, I have at- 413Ibid., fol. 43, "la Poesie de l'art," fols. 70, 107, 108, 110, etc., "Poesie de l'architecture." 414 Ibid., fol. 77. 415 Ibid., fols. 77, 78- 416 Ibid., fol. 78.

Necropolis (Grand monument funeraire). tempted to find how they affect US." 420 The means which Boullee regards as especially appropriate are dis- tribution of masses, illumination, monumental dimen- sions, and emphasis on the character of the building. According to Boullee, the art of combining the masses effectively is the most important in architecture.421 All effect is to be derived from the whole, but not from its details.422 The masses should be grand, and full of movement,423 the "character" depends upon them.424 Yet how can movement be brought into the masses when the richness of the Baroque has been superseded by the austerity of stereometric forms ? Villar informs us of the means which Boullee chiefly emphasized. The artist declared himself to be the "inventor of the architecture of shades and shadows," i.e., disposing the masses so that their contrasting forms produce attrac- tive lighting effects. I am left with the impression that Villar had learned the architect's point of view from Boullee himself, rather than from similar statements in his manuscript.425 The idea of architecture des ombres had occurred to Boullee, as he states, during a walk in the moonlight.426 Another appropriate means to give simple geometri- cal forms impressiveness, was through colossal dimen- sions. "Grandeur pleases because our soul yearns to 420 Ibid., fol. 70, "je devois faire des recherches sur la theorie des corps, les analyser, chercher a reconnoitre leurs proprietes, leur puissance sur nos sens.. 421 Ibid., fol. 47, "l'art de combiner les masses." 422 Ibid., fol. 48, "nos emotions naissent de l'effet du tout en- semble et non pas des details dont la beaute ajoute seulement aux premieres impressions causees par les masses." 423 Ibid. fol. 86, "que leurs masses aient un mouvement noble, majestueux." 424 Ibid., fol. 142, "c'est de 1'effet des masses que provient l'art de donner du caractere a une production quelconque." 425 Villar, 45, "l'architecture des ombres dont il se declare l'inventeur. II appelle ainsi l'art de disposer les masses des edifices, de telle maniere que leurs saillies et le contraste de leurs formes produisent les effets de lumiere les plus propres a charmer la vue."

Under all circumstances it ex- cites our admiration." 427 Boullee was so thoroughly imbued with the idea of grandeur that his drawings were carried out on a huge scale. It was not always neces- sary that the absolute measurements should be excep- tionally large, as are, for instance, the library hall- that "immense basilique." 428 It was enough for him when the buildings appeared on a grand scale-"paroitre grand." 429 Extreme frugality of ornament adds to the impression of size. Thus in practice Boullee preferred smooth surfaces, and was thoroughly averse to vain profuseness, "les richesses steriles." 430 These demands were rather common about 1800, as a remark by Madame de Stael proves: Toutes ces gradations, ces manieres prudentes et nuancees pour preparer les grands effets, ne sont point de mon gofit. On n'arrive point au sublime par degres. On another occasion she criticizes the neglect of practi- cality and the predilection for the superfluous, "cette negligence du necessaire et cette affectation de l'inu- tile." 431 The last point in Boullee's doctrine-character-was to play an eminent role in the program of Romanticism. Boullee insisted that to impress the onlooker, buildings should show character,432 but he does not content him- self with plain symbolism, and demands for instance a city gate to be "l'image de la force." He saw the goal of architecture in the "tableau expressif," 434 and wanted the building full of "poesie enchanteresse." 4 427Ibid., fol. 79, "L'image du grand nous plait, sous tous les rapports, parce que notre ame, avide d'etendre les jouissances, voudroit embrasser l'univers." Fol. 90, "L'image du grand a un tel empire sur nos sens . . . elle excite toujours, en nous, un sentiment d'admiration." 428 From Boullee, Mfnioire . . sr la Bibliotheque, Paris, 1785.

In his manuscript he tells of his plan for a church on the heights of Mont Valerien or Montmartre, high above the city, for the celebration of Corpus Christi, with scented gardens to frame it, and tree-bordered roads to lead off into fruitful fields. And he mentions another plan similarly conceived, for the Monument de la Recon- noissance Publique to be set in beautiful natural sur- roundings.440 The architect, he claimed, should "put nature on the stage." 441 The Newton Memorial was to stand in the midst of flower beds and cypresses; the great Necropolis placed in an heroic landscape 442 (fig. 48). Boullee was fully aware that he aimed at discrepant 436 Ibid., fol. 93, "Ils ont introduit la magie de l'art." 437 Ibid., fol. 123. 438Ibid., fol. 123.

He lived in the illusion that he was able to reach the impossible, to reconcile the irreconcilable. This is the meaning of his confession at the end of his text: I had to fear that in taking the way of picturesqueness I might become theatrical. But I was anxious not to re- nounce that purity which architecture demands. I believe I have circumvented the risk of ambiguity.443 In Boullee's work the old is dead. Hardly any vestige of Baroque forms and Baroque composition is traceable. Even the last stage of Baroque disintegration, the Ro- coco, is overcome. The elementary forms and simple patterns play a larger role in his designs than compli- cated or more refined solutions such as were the pat- terns of compensation and interpenetration which Le- doux favored. Boullee did not follow the various fash- ions of exoticism, nor was he affected by the functional doctrine of Carlo Lodoli. Interested chiefly in purely artistic problems, he concentrated on monumental proj- ects, where practical concerns could not hamper his ideas.444 It was for Ledoux to probe the validity of the newly-discovered principles in buildings of every type: in sumptuous residences and in humble houses for workmen; in the most diversified utilitarian struc- tures and in shrines to serve the humanitarian ideals of the revolutionary era. 443Ibid., fol. 130, "J'avois a craindre, en employant les moyens pittoresques . . . d'etre ce qu'on appelle the&amp;tral [this word is underlined by Boullee] et de m'ecarter de cette purete qu'exige l'architecture, et sans laquelle toute production porte avec elle un vice insupportable, que je crois avoir su eviter." 444Ibid., fol. 110, "Les sujets steriles sont ceux d'habitations."</page><page sequence="45">PART II CLAUDE-NICOLAS LEDOUX V.

In the case of both architects, the understanding of their characters and of their intellectual backgrounds is more important than any comparison of their work with works of the past. I shall therefore deal at some length with Ledoux' per- sonality before entering upon his highly controversial achievements (fig. 49).

This he went to Paris where he enrolled at the College Beau- vais on a scholarship. Soon he devoted himself to the art of engraving, and made his living by selling his battle scenes. But before long he decided to become an architect and entered the school of Jacques-Frangois Blondel, worked under Louis-Frangois Trouard, and carefully studied Servandoni's work.3 In the obituary by J. C., a friend or pupil of Ledoux, it is emphasized that the architect had never been in Italy.4 The first known works of Ledoux were the novel decoration of the Cafe Militaire in Paris, which brought him sudden renown,5 and the restorations of the Cathe- drals of Auxerre and Sens.6 Beginning in the seven- teen-sixties he received an ever increasing number of commissions from prominent members of Parisian so- ciety, particularly Madame Du Barry. In 1771 Jean Charles Philibert Trudaine de Montigny, intendant general des finances, appointed him inspector of the Royal Saltworks' in the Franche-Comte, which office he held for twenty-three years.' In this post he was active in erecting at Arc-et-Senans, 1775-1779, office and factory buildings, as well as homes for the work- men.8 After having been rejected by the Royal Acad- emy of Architecture in 1767 as second class member, he was finally accepted in 1773 and given the desig- nation, as all such members were, Architecte du Roi.9 Two years, later the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel admired the house which Ledoux had built for Mlle Guimard in Paris, and invited him to his capital. Here Ledoux was feted by the court according to the report of Simon Louis du Ry, a former pupil of Blondel, and designed a triumphal arch, a palace, as well as a library, none of which was carried out. Discontented with the small remuneration he was receiving, he left Hesse-Cassel plagiarism is reported in Ztschr. f. Kunstgeschichte 4: 189. 1935. 3 L. R., Avertissementt. 4 J.

These arrived safely in St. Petersburg and pleased the prince.13 Un- fortunately, it is not known what became of them, for they have never been located. Between 1775 and 1784 Ledoux built the Theatre of Besancon.14 In 1784 he was entrusted by the Ferme generale with the construc- tion of the toll houses, the so-called Barrieres de Paris. Wishing to create "magnificent propylea," 15 he did not consider cost, and as a consequence the commission was taken from him in 1789 and transferred to the architect Jacques-Denis Antoine.16 Ledoux' last important com- missions were the Palace for the Governor, the Courts, and the Prisons of Aix-en-Provence. The plans for these projects were approved in 1785.17 Work pro- gressed very slowly, and in 1790 was finally discontin- ued because of the Revolution.18 In 1792 Ledoux was refused promotion to first class membership in the Acad- emy.19 The political events made him suffer in many ways. In 1793, he was placed in jail 20 and barely es- caped the guillotine, or, as he termed it, "l'hache na- tionale." 21 Rival artists availed themselves of the op- portunity to make him suspect. In a poster of the year II of the revolutionary era they warned against him as an intrigant.22 The outbreak of the Revolution deprived him of the last hope of receiving the accumulated pay- ments for work done in the king's service.23 It is not to be wondered that he welcomed the rising star of des volontes versatiles qui neutralisent les elans du genie, je n'offrirai point a mes lecteurs de ces projets qui se perdent dans le vague des combinaisons imaginaires . . . j'ai rassemble, dans une lecture de quelques jours, toutes les richesses des siecles qui nous ont pr&amp;edes."

Originally he had intended to set forth the development of architecture through the ages, but his own achievement and his own tenets meant more to him than the accomplishments of his predecessors. So it came about that the one volume which was printed deals exclusively with his own proj- ects and executed works, between 1768 and 1789.2&amp; The book appeared in 1804 under the pompous title L'Architecture consideree sous le rapport de l'Art, des Mwurs et de la Le'gislation. Ledoux had to bear the expense of its publication out of the remnants of his own fortune, for no publisher had been ready to bring out the strange work with the fantastic projects for an Ideal City and the obscure text.26 He himself composed the Prospectus,27 and sent it out to learned societies and acquaintances. In a letter of March 28, 1803 he felt proud of its style and expressed the hope that the work, lavishly produced, would be a success.28 It speaks well ,for his unbroken spirit in his last years, that he an- nounced in the Prospectus the project for a second city. The publication, which he considered as his legacy to posterity, is a fascinating work, quite unique in all the literature of architecture. The text of 240 folio pages was apparently written in the nineties-partly while Ledoux was in prison-and after 1800.29 Daniel Ramee, son of Joseph Jacques Ramee,30 one of those architects who spread the modern French ideas to the New World, published a second edition in 1847.

A survey of Ledoux' life serves as an introduction. It may well be that this collection by Ramee is identical with the designs which Ledoux, before his death, handed over to his trusted friend and pupil, the architect Pierre Vignon.32 On November 19, 1806, Ledoux passed away.33 His uncompromising personality does not seem to have at- tracted many students,, in contrast to Boullee who was a successful teacher. I could trace only four of Ledoux' pupils: Pierre Fournerat who showed much promise in his beginnings; 34 Jean-Nicolas Sobre,35 who followed the master's fantastic approach; Louis-Ambroise Dubut and Louis-Emmanuel-Aime Damesme,36 both of whom followed the master's, attempts towards a new form. Ledoux tells little of his life in his verbose composi- tion. His, statements, moreover, must be received with much scepticism, for he was fond of fanciful embellish- ments of real occurrences. The text is often almost unintelligible, even to Frenchmen.37 Far better, per- haps, than a sober report, it is the passionate outburst of a deeply disappointed man, the resentful remembrance 31 Ramee, Avertissement, on Ledoux, "un de ces hommes qu'une critique partiale et superficielle a j ete dans l'oubli on s'apercoit aisement qu'il a voulu inventer une nouvelle archi- tecture." 32 J.

Ledoux' L'Architecture . . . is both a confession and a legacy. He had been firmly convinced of his artistic mission long before he wrote his text. In a letter of August 24, 1775, directed to the governor of the prov- ince of Franche-Comte, Lacore, he compared himself with the founder of a new faith: ". . . je scais ce qu'il en cofite pour etablir une nouvelle Religion." 40 The book reveals the architect's, personality, and reflects the ideas of the era of Enlightenment, the philosophy of Condorcet, as well as the ideals of Rousseau. Of great- est significance is the new architectural program he sets forth. Many of his statements might serve as an intro- duction to an architectural textbook of our time. Ledoux was a true representative of the late eight- eenth century. Imbued with the humanistic erudition of his period,41 he was, nonetheless, an ardent propa- gandist of new aims, a fanatic and a fighter. When in 1784 he strove to receive the commission for Aix, he was confident of winning, even if he had to fight for it.42 Looking back on his life some years later, he com- plained that too often the circumstances forced him to give in.43 Fully alive to the problems of his day, he did not confine himself to his professional field alone. In his opinion, the architect should be a leader of his community.44 Ledoux would have liked to remodel everything. Religious, social, and economic topics, as 38 L., 32, "la gloire que les hommes dispensent n'est jamais en proportion avec le travail qui la procure, elle est comme l'ombre, toujours plus longue ou plus courte que l'objet." 33, "II vient un moment oii l'horizon de la vie ne laisse entrevoir que le vuide du passe." 71, "Pour combler la mesure des maux, qu'obtient (l'artiste) ? la permission de vivre." 71, n. 2, "L' artiste a fait un travail infructueux; on a paye l'ouvrier.-O posterite! me vengeras-tu?" 39 L., 12, "J'attaquerai, ouii, j'attaquerai les abus accredites par la servitude des usages qui retardent la science de la dis- tribution." 40 Arch. du Doubs, Besancon, C 40. 41 L., 16, 148, etc. refers to classical authors. 42 Berluc-Perussis, 198, Letter to Mignard, Sept. 14, 1784, "Je suis acoutume aux tracasseries, je n'ai rien eu en ma vie qu'au fil de l'epee, et cependant tout m'a reussi . . . je me pre- pare au combat, et je me battray bien." 43 L., 33, "Contrarie toute ma vie, sous tous les rapports, je n'ai rien fait que j'eusse voulu faire; j'ai commence beaucoup de batiments que l'inconstance ne m'a pas permis d'achever.... II semble que cette nation . . . ne puisse atteindre au-dela du provisoire. . . . Ce qui auroit le plus contribue a faire valoir mon ouvrage n'a pas ete acheve." To this Ledoux adds a note, "La suspension du palais de justice, des prisons d'Aix a excite mes regrets." 44 L., 17, "J'aurois rempli a peine la moitie de mon but, si l'Architecte qui commande a tous les arts, ne commandoit a toutes les vertus. 175, "L'Architecte creuse l'avenir . . .; il voit par-tout le bien dans l'puration du systeme social . . . l'homme de metier est I'automate du createur; 1 homme de genie est le createur lui-meme."</page><page sequence="49">478 KAUFMANN: THREE REVOLUTIONARY ARCHITECTS [TRANS.

SOC. well as questions of hygiene, are dealt with, or at least touched upon in his text.45 He regarded it as a privi- lege of the architect to concern himself with any issue: " . tout est de son ressort, politique, morale, legis- lation, culte, gouvernements." 4" An academician, free from prejudice, he did not dis,dain the experience of the craftsman.47 He wanted to serve the highest ideals of the era,48 and was concerned with the smallest details of architectural practice, even to the ventilation of the classroom and kitchen,49 the convenience of the stable.50 His mind was shaped by the leading thinkers -of his day.51 From the Rationalists he had inherited the criti- cal vein, from Rousseau he drew the new appreciation of nature and the new ideals in education and physical culture.52 A beautiful old tree against the sky means no less to him than a work of art.53 Human compas- sion, he claims, should extend even to the animal.54 L'Architecture . . . is the outgrowth of a period of transition, full of contradictions, full of doubt, and full of promise. 45 L., 17, "Est-il quelque chose que l'Architecte doive ignorer, lui qui est ne au meme instant que le soleil, lui qui est aussi ancien que le sol qu'il habite ?" 81, "Les arts d'agrement doivent marcher d'un pas egal avec l'economie politique. . . .

These words recall a similar statement of Montesquieu, Esprit des loix, 1748, others remind one of Rousseau, e.g., 118, "Deja ce nouveau pacte social reflette par-tout son influence." 52 Cf. n. 365 and several little lyrics scattered in the text, as, 41, "Egayons le present, jettons des fleurs sur l'avenir.

Au printemps de l'annee, au printemps de mes jours, je vois des milliers d'hommes s'associer a mes plaisirs; je les vois elever des pierres immortelles." 78, "Deja la fraicheur du matin s'etendoit dans la flaine.

Ledoux was never to carry out his novel ideas. Only in his designs and in his text could he lay down his pro- gressive views, and cry out against convention.55 Con- temporaries ridiculed and spurned him, as the necrolo- gist J. C. relates.56 He found comfort in the conviction that posterity would recognize in him the artist who redeemed architecture and would, in the end, do him justice.57 "Avant de franchir les marais du Styx, j'aurai la satisfaction d'avoir brise les chaines qui l'entravent [l'architecture]] * Many passages reveal his passion- ate devotion to his work,59 and at the end of his career, he complained that the lifetime of an architect was far too short. Never should he miss a single hour; he must dream in the night of his work in the coming day.60 To him, the architect is a "rival of the Creator." 61 In ec- static moments he had dreams of moving mountains, of drying swamps, of transforming the face of the earth.62 No wonder then that in estimating costs, Ledoux dis- regarded financial limitations, and again and again met with opposition from his patrons.63 Often he spoke of unaccomplished projects as if he really had carried them out.64 He was faced with adversities all his life.65 When his first project of the Saltworks was denounced to Louis XV as a product of mania-"comme une pro- duction conZue dans le delire"-he answered with three 55L., 8, "Enfin le flambeau du genie ravive sa flamme, et l'excite en l'agitant contre les ruines des chefs-d'ceuvre antiques; l'art eclaire se ranime." 9, "je regarderai comme un devoir d'opposer a cette perfide lueur, la lumiere vraie des principes destines a eclairer notre age." 14, "On perd la vue si on s'ac- coutume a voir par les yeux d'un autre." 21, "la methode et la rectitude, le sublime des sots." 96, "un centre d'instruction souvent favorise la maniere." 110, "la methode engendre l'uni- formite, perpetue la maniere, la resserre dans le cercle etroit des conventions." 56 J.

He expressed his fullest admiration for the buildings of Jacques-Ange Gabriel on the Place de la Concorde.70 Ledoux' bitterness was not entirely justified, for he was entrusted with many commissions, and there were many who expressed the highest esteem for his talents. His teacher Blondel praised his house for the dancer Guimard, and tells of the general praise for Madame Du Barry's Pavillion de Louveciennes. Ledoux' nomi- nation to the Academy appeared to Blondel well de- served.71 The architect Nicolas Goulet admired Le- doux' inventiveness,72 and when in 1800 the curator of the Musee central des arts, Lebrun, was asked by Lucien Bonaparte to name the ten most prominent architects of France, he included among them Ledoux, characterizing him "Homme de genie; imagination ardente." Ledoux' artistic development did not progress step by step like a carefully elaborated course in architecture. The outer world was in chaos; old and new ideas strug- gled for supremacy. Ledoux' inner world, too, was full 66 J. C., 5. L., 40, "les delits de mon imagination." 67 L., 159, "ces meutres auxquels on attache quelque gloire ... une armee n'est souvent qu'un rassemblement de coupables envoye par les dieux vengeurs pour chatier les humains." 212, "Quel miserable triomphe que celui que l'on remporte sur un animal timide." 68 L., 23, "Qui pourra juger l'homme de genie, puisqu'il est touj ours neuf ? est-ce le grand nombre? l'opinion?

C'est la, c'est dans ce fastueux edifice que brille le sentiment inepuisable de l'Architecture francaise." 71 Blondel, Homme du monde 2: 109 f.

L * * *, jeune Architecte, ne manquant pas de genie," showed him around the house; he blames Ledoux who "se laisse entrainer au torrent, et neglige, ainsi que la plupart de ses emules, les convenances, les proportions . . . vous y verrez un ordre ridiculement colossal." (Here follows the quotation of pt. I, n. 172.) 1: 260, "le jeune architecte vous suit par-tout, lorsque vous venez examiner cet H6tel, et s'applique a vous faire remarquer qu'il a observe des ornements dans le genre antique . . . qu'il a su enfin s'affranchir de la routine." 72 Legrand and Landon 3: 58. 73 Fillon, Artistes francais en 1800, Nouv.

The works which sprang from this chaos throw new light upon the era itself, which in its artistic aspi- rations has been thoroughly misinterpreted up to the present. Ledoux certainly made abundant use of conventional forms. Yet one cannot grasp the meaning of his work by hunting for similarities in the works of Palladio and Piranesi. He himself warned against the critics who confine themselves to comparisons.74 He felt proud of having fought the copyists and of having shattered the prestige of the old doctrine and the old models. He wanted the creative mind to depend upon its own think- ing, and exhorted the artist to dare in order to over- come the past.75 The likeness between so many of Ledoux' works and those of the present time leaves no doubt that he antici- pated the future. This does not mean that he originated modern architecture. No one alone ever created a new style. The new would have come into existence even had Ledoux never lived. While Carlo Lodoli was the first, or one of the first, to express the bold ideas of Functionalism, so was Ledoux among the first to visual- ize a new formal ideal. He believed that the principles which had guided him would last "longer than the pyra- mids," 76 and would make him immortal. Most cer- tainly, he was justified in the choice of the motto for the front page of his Architecture, the proud words of Horace, EXEGI MONUMENTUM. VI. BUILDINGS ERECTED OR PROJECTED Ignorez-vous ce qu'il en coate a ceux qui osent changer la masse des idees reques? 77 No consistent development can be traced in Ledoux' dated works. Typical Baroque productions alternate 74L., 23, "La plupart des hommes instruits ne jugent que lorsqu'ils comparent: compilateurs exacts, ils s'appuient sur tous les exemples qui servent de boussole." 25, "Nulle situation n'est feconde pour l'homme sterile." 75 L., 34, "j'aurai la satisfaction d'avoir fait tomber (les chaines). . . .

Osez; l'exemple que vous donnerez fera eclore de nouveaux preceptes qui epureront les anciens." 76 L., 34, "Le principe qui m'a dirige durera plus que les pyramides." Ledoux' work was still in very low esteem up to twenty years ago. Martin Henry, Style Empire, 7, Paris, 1925, "F. Belanger et Charles [sic] Ledoux ne sont pas des artistes de grande valeur." Michel, Hist. de l'art, 7, 1924, ignores the proj ects for the Ideal City, Ledoux' main achievement. Du Peloux, Charles, Repertoire biogr. et bibliogr. des artistes du 18e siecle franc. 1: 234, Paris, 1930, refers vaguely to Ledoux' "divers ouvrages sur l'architecture," not naming his only book. In 2, 1941, he lists a few French publications, but, significantly, leaves out all foreign ones. Mourey, Gabriel, Tableau de l'art franc. 3: 18, Paris, 1937, sees in Ledoux' work "une regression du genie franqais." 77 L., 71.</page><page sequence="51">480 KAUFMANN: THREE REVOLUTIONARY ARCHITECTS [TRANS.

So their arrangement in chronological order would not serve to disentangle the crossing currents. It seems best, therefore, to abandon the chronologer's sterile enumerations, and group the artist's works in stylistic sequence, according to our knowledge of the architectural development of the past two hundred years. For this is the span of time which in one way or another is reflected, or foreshadowed, in Ledoux' work. Paren- thetically, may I remark that critics of my former pub- lications were mistaken in asserting that I recognized only the modern Ledoux.

Castle of Benouville. BAROQUE SURVIVALS In 1770 Ledoux erected the Palace of the Prince de Montmorency', at the corner of the rue Basse-du-Rem- part and Chaussee d'Antin 79 (fig. 50). Its two main stories were tied together by colossal Ionic columns and markedly set off against the rusticated basement. Thus we see on the facade both concatenation and gradation, and, as a further Baroque feature, statues on the roof balustrade. Ledoux did not need to borrow this feature 79 L., 175, states 1770.

L.R., pl. 159. from Palladio, for it was very common in the eighteenth century and had often been applied by his teacher, Blon- del.80 The basic concept of the plan of this Palace was Baroque, too. Ledoux ingeniously adapted the conven- tional sequence of the main rooms to the corner lot: on each floor, the main axis coincided with a diagonal of the square plan; the principal entrance was situated in the corner (fig. 51). The H6tel d'Uzes was built between the rue Mont- martre and the rue Saint-Fiacre a few years earlier, in 1767 81 (figs. 52-54). Its plan was conventional, but contained only rectangular rooms. The house stood on a narrow, deep plot. From the monumental entrance, praised by a contemporary as "a wonderful composi- tion," an alley led to the court and the house.82 The garden front extended on one side a good deal farther than the court front. When Courtonne built the H6tel Matignon, 1721,83 he was confronted with a similar situ- ation. He solved the problem by centering each front around its main room, projecting the latter. Thus he 80 Blondel, Distribution 1: ills., p. 1, 11; pls. 6, 42. 81 Thiery, Almanach, 365, "remarquable par l'arc de triomphe qui sert d'entree et par la decoration imposante de la fagade . . . par Ledoux."

In the still extant blocklike Chateau of BPnou- ville, begun in 1768, Ledoux abandoned the Baroque scheme 84 (fig. 55). Here the staircase in the center 84 L.R., pls. 93, 246-250.

Palladio, of the garden front disrupts the continuity of the main axis. Again, the central portions are screened by colos- sal porticoes. The chapel at Benouville is a rotunda at the far end of one wing, with the altar in its center. Still somewhat dependent on Baroque patterns were two never-completed residences for Madame Du Barry, the Chateau of St. Vrain 85 (fig. 57) and the Palace of Louveciennes, which was begun in 1773 86 (fig. 56). In both emphasis, was laid on the central portions and end pavillions. But the masses were treated in a new way: they were shaped as aggregates of prisms. The Palace of Louveciennes was finished with straight roof- lines, whereas the Hotel d'Uzes still retained a mansard roof. So far, we have seen Ledoux clinging to traditional composition, and at the same time, tending to negate it. His Schemitt House 87 was another specimen combin- ing the old, organic, with the new, geometrical, concept (fig. 58). The plan still shows the centralized arrange- ment with a vestibule and salon, but in the elevation, Quattro libri dell'Architettura, Venice, 1570, Bk. I, xxv, is for the enfilade.

THE FASHION OF CLASSICISM The still extant house of M. de St. Lambert, or de Mezieres, at Eaubonne, 1776, represents a less signifi- cant phase of Ledoux' development X8 (fig. 59). Its temple-like elevation is a dull performance of revival- ism. No trace of Ledoux' inventive mind can be found here except, perhaps, in the forceful design of the open stairs. The house of the Chevalier de Mannery at Salins,89 is a product of academic classicism (fig. 61). Soon we shall see how ardently Ledoux strove to rid himself of convention and to achieve new solutions. THE RULE OF GEOMETRY The Chateau of Maupertuis would have consisted of a central pile with loosely connected pavilions 90 (fig. 63). Various features would have distinguished it from Baroque works: the cylindrical belvedere contrasted with the triangular pediment, the almost frameless windows, and the undifferentiated row of arcades on the ground floor. Ledoux planned to add to the castle two very curious outbuildings, which it is doubtful that a patron 88 Krafift, J.-C., Recueil d'architecture civile, pl. 8, Paris, 1805. L.R., pls. 278bis, 279.

The Pheasantry,91 designed on the plan of a Greek Cross (fig. 65), in the center is crowned with a hemispheric cupola above a massive drum; the crossarms are prisms with bare walls and Venetian doors. The Shelter for the Rural Guards (Maison des gardes agricoles) is one of the architect's most daring inventions 92 (fig. 64). He worked out the designs for this Shelter methodically in perspective, plan, and section. It was to have been a complete sphere set in a sunken basin, accessible by four bridges. The ground floor was to contain stables and green-houses; the main floor bedroomsr with the kitchen in the center; the top floor, storage rooms. In the Shelter, Ledoux shows an extreme instance of pure geometry. In the still existing H6tel de Halwil, which was the first house built by him, between 1764 and 1767,93 at 28 rue Michel-le-Comte, in Paris,94 the upper portion is markedly severed from the lower by the strong cor- nice; the receding center is clearly set off from the sides (fig. 69). The whole seems to disintegrate into single compartments. The rooms are arranged in the freest manner, their sizes and shapes depending exclu- sively on their practical purposes.

FG67Du Barry house, planned in rue d'Artos tures, such as the columns flanking the door, play a minor role in this building. A new simplicity and clar- ity has been reached in this house and in Antoine's Hotel de Fleury, 1768,95 which belong to the same stylistic phase. The House of President Hocquart on the rue de Monsieur,96 was a cube erected on a nine-partite square (fig. 70). The center was occupied by the very high circular dining room. On the outside the low dome above the dining room was contrasted to the cubic mass; four-columned pedimented porticoes were loosely ap- pended to the fronts. The staircase of the House of Mlle de St. Germain, on the rue des Porcherons, 1772 97 (fig. 71), inserted between the salon and the porch, disrupted the con- tinuity of the rooms. On the exterior, the tendency toward cubism had definitely gained in strength. The central portion of the front receded markedly. The high four-columned porch projecting from the recess suggested a smaller block intruding into the larger one. The walls were nude, the windows unframed, the roof flat. The house was far more modern than Gabriel's Petit Trianon which, as early as 1765, emphasized the compact cube, but still showed Baroque gradation and concatenation, and even a certain plasticity in the deco- ration.98 Baroque centralization, with a variant of the Palladian motif, characterizes the facade of the project of a Monu- ment de Popularite. Here Ledoux was probably ex- perimenting in his search for new solutions. Its frame- work is unique in Ledoux' work 99 (fig. 66). (The term "Palladian motif" appears frequently in the following text. This is the name of a pattern, appear- ing chiefly in windows (also called Venetian windows) and portals, often used by Palladio, though not invented 95Vieux h6tels, ser. 7, 18; pl. 41. 96 L.R., pls. 197-199.

When Ledoux erected the residence of the Comte d'Atilly on the rue Poissonniere, in 1780,100 he gave it the appearance of a block resting upon a podium. The stops ascending from the street to the porch were flanked by projecting aisles containing offices. The house which Ledoux built for himself in 1780 on the rue des Petites Ecuries, and which later was oc- cupied by the Comte d'Espinchal,101 resembled the house of Atilly very closely (fig. 72). It was distinguished by the semi-circular porch leading into the oval salon. Again the stairs were flanked by aisles with terraces above. Maison Jarnac, rue des Petites Ecuries,02 looked like a variant of the Atilly House (fig. 68), but it was erected on a real podium which had a double aesthetic function: it separated the house most definitely from the environment, and repeated its plain cubic shape. By this very repetition the plain cubic form became artistically effective. The house was truly modern with its cool reserve. In these houses and in the House with a Balcony on the rue Poissonniere,103 the porches impart the idea of a small body opposed' to the main mass (fig. 62). In the design of House with a Belvedere, also on the rue Poissonniere, standing in a park with statues,104 the architect contrasts the m(ain block with both the semi- circular porch and the cylindrical belvedere (fig. 60).

Moreover, he emphasizes the cylindrical form by pre- senting it twice: as a columnar screen below, and as a massive solid above. The belvedere reverberates the porch. While the ground plan with its gracious curves and its balance reminds one of bygone times, the con- trasts in the third dimension foretell the compositional possibilities of the future. Ledoux' devotion to elementary geometry manifests itself with particular intensity in the project of the cylin- drical DeWitt House 105 (fig. 74). Here the large po- dium is crossed by a canal and thoroughfare (fig. 73). (We shall find this strange idea of a watercourse pass- ing through a house again in the Chateau of Eguiere 105 L.R., pls. 193-196.

The most famous of Ledoux' residential buildings in Paris was that of Mine de The'lusson, finished in 1780 (fig. 77). Its renown was greatly due to the sumptuous- ness of the rooms, by which the patron, the widow of a rich banker, wanted to surpass the houses of her social rivals. The grandeur of the architectural accomplish- ment must have impressed contemporaries, as can be seen from the many comments and numerous engravings of the structure.106 The house was situated in a park. 106 L.R., pls. 160-167.

NEW SURFACE PATTERNS We have found in Ledoux' work the decline of the Baroque, the rather insignificant symptoms of classi- cism, and the two trends so characteristic of Boullee's work-the tendency toward grandeur and the introduc- tion of elementary geometry.

Raval and Moreux tried to give a better foundation to the old concepts. They see (22, 44, 50, 67) Palladio's heritage in some features, none of which is distinctive of his work. Ledoux did not have to refer to him for the widely used "Palladian" windows, roof balustrades with statues and the colossal order. Any observer not dependent on ready-for-use formulas can see that most of Ledoux' plans are as distirct from Palladio's as possible. The Greek cross in particular, so frequent in Ledoux' work, is exceptional in Palladio's. It is a far cry from the Palladian motif on the Basilica of Vicenza, plastic and exuberant as it is, and thus FIG. 79. Thelusson house, plan. of some few single features in the works of Palladio and Ledoux seem to have misled these critics. One who is aware that Palladio's composition was in a wider sense Baroque 109 cannot overlook the fact that Ledoux was moving in a different direction. In many of his designs little is left of the gradation typical of the schemes of Palladio,110 who applied pediments chiefly to enhance the center of his houses,1ll and still less is left of the former concatenation. thoroughly Baroque, to the atrophied motif of Ledoux and his variations of it. Ledoux' remark to which Moreux, 44, 67, refers, says merely that he preferred Palladio's roofs to the mansards. Discussing the castle of Eguiere, 54, Moreux ex- claims lyrically, "A-t-il pense A la Brenta?" If the two authors had come across Ledoux' Prospectus, they would know how he thought of it: "Ces palais qui se reproduisent dans les eaux limpides de la Brenta . . . qu'ont-ils produit pour la classe nombreuse? Rien." And they might have observed his warn- ing, "L'homme qui se traine sur les traces des autres, se croit dejA un erudit. Celui qui est plein du sentiment de ses forces, n'emprunte de personne...." 109 Palladio liked it to make "the middle part higher than the sides" (II, 49, quoted from the edition by Isaac Ware) and he felt that the aisles "like arms come out of the fabrick" (II, 52), or "like arms tend to the circumference" (II, 55).

As an example I might cite the residence which Le- doux planned for Madame Du Barry on the rue d'Ar- tois 112 (fig. 67). Here we find the colonnades on the long-stretched front, which extinguish almost every dif- ferentiation. The front of the d'Evry house, between the rues Ven- tadour and Sainte-Anne,113 likewise reveals a tendency to replace the old hierarchical order by plain juxtaposi- tion of equivalent elements (fig. 82). The center is em- phasized only in the pediment; rows of equal apertures appear in the stories below. The scheme for the Lauzon house at Chauvigny en Poitou,114 attempts to establish an entirely new arrangement of the facade (fig. 83). This house consists of three stories and a garret. The garret window and the entrance door below enhance the center but slightly. Just as Ledoux disrupted the main axis of several of his plans by interposing the staircase between the principal rooms, he now tears apart the vertical main axis by inserting a loggia all along the front of the third floor and replaces the old harmony of the fronts with a new principle. There is neither har- mony nor balance between the stories. Instead, there is tension, the result of the uneven spacing of the rows of variform windows. In the well-balanced Baroque facades any possibility of tension had been forestalled. 112 L.R., pls. 168-172.

Their parts were interrelated and never showed that condition of deceptive calm, with underlying unsettled conflicts, which was to become a main characteristic of twentieth-century architecture. NEW WAYS OF SPATIAL COMPOSITION In his search for new spatial solutions, Ledoux be- came the true precursor of the twentieth century. In ever varying attempts he wanted to present buildings: as aggregates of interpenetrating masses; or as crossings of volume and mass; or as piles of stepped off units (motif of contrasted sizes) ; or as assemblages of incon- gruous elements (motif of contrasted shapes). The pattern of interpenetrating masses appears in many variations in Ledoux' works, beginning in feeble essays and ending in forceful; outspoken solutions. We may recall that this was one of the modern patterns which Blondel had condemned so explicitly.115 About 1783 Ledoux was asked to submit plans for the Town Hall of Neuchatel (not carried out) 116 (fig. 115 See pt.

The facades remind one of the Lauzon House, where the openings were spaced in such a way that the wall between them was full of tension. In Town Hall it is the spatial pattern which is the most remarkable element, rather than the surface pattern. Here we see the side pediments inti- mating the intrusion of a secondary block into the main body. Virtual interpenetration of two blocks is even better visualized on the still existing Theatre of Besancon, 1775-1 784,117 for the secondary block here is more emphatically projected (fig. 85). Ledoux' letters to Governor Lacore, 118 as well as his later comments on this project in the Architecture,119 reveal that at this time it was his intention to present something abso- lutely new in this theatre. The new ideas he advo- cated for the interior were not entirely his own, for he followed some suggestions of Blondel,120 and redis- covered some advantages in the theatres of the An- FIG. 84.

He preferred the uninterrupted sweep of the balconies to the "cage-like" boxes, and asked for restraint in decoration.125 In front of the top ranks he arranged a row of columns similar to that in Palladio's Teatro Olimpico. One of his en- gravings, presenting the audience mirrored in a big eyeball, reveals his propensity for the unusual (Coup d'ceil du Theatre de Besan?on) 126 (fig. 84). Revert- ing again to the exterior we note that Ledoux planned the sloping roof to be concealed by a parapet, for the northern climate did not allow for a flat roof, which he would have preferred.127 About the time Ledoux completed the Theatre of Besangon, he designed another, the Theatre of Mar- seille for which not he but Charles-Joachim Benard received the commission 128 (fig. 81). Ledoux' mighty porch of eight columns carries a quadriga over the entablature. Again, the spatial and surface patterns are of greater significance than the reminiscences of antiquity. On the side fronts, rows of small square windows above are contrasted with alternating Vene- tian windows and tall rectangles below. The lateral projections look like intersecting blocks.

The pattern of interpenetrating blocks stands out with great distinctness in the Stables of Mme Du Barry, at Versailles, 1773 131 (fig. 76), with blocks intruding on both the main front and the sides. The concept of interpenetration can be perfectly real- ized on the Greek-cross plan. Ledoux had a predilec- tion for this plan type, as can be seen in many instances, especially in the projects for Aix-en-Provence.132 The Palace of the Governor of Aix shows a central cylin- drical dome emerging from the cross-shaped body 133 (fig. 87). Similarly, in the Courthouse, the upper masses seem to burst forth from the larger lower blocks 134 (fig. 86). In this huge pile we begin to see the great possibilities latent in the concept of inter- penetration. The plan of the Prisons of the city of Aix,135 is a square with four inner courts (fig. 88). The archi- tect intended to dramatize this structure by various contrasts: heavy towers project from the four corners, barrel vaults over the porches seem to intrude into the big cube. Two rows of tiny openings run along the bare walls, one high up, the other at a considerable dis- tance below. Here we see tension on the surface, and antagonism in the masses.

A weak copy was the prison at Brussels by his pupil Louis-Emmanuel-Aime. Damesme, in 1813.138 In the Episcopal Palace of Sisteron,139 the pattern of interpenetration is expressed in an extremely strong way, without impairing the self-contained character of the whole structure (fig. 89). The edifice rises like an erratic block on the plain. Its cross-arms, ending abruptly in the porches, find neither response nor con- tinuation in the environment. Nor is there any inter- relation between the elements of the structure itself, the belvedere atop and the masses below. The plan of the Chateau of Eguiere 140 is a Greek cross, the angles of which are filled in with additional rooms (fig. 90). The curious thing about this house is that it is planned to sit astride a canal. The disposi- tion of its masses alone was not enough for Ledoux. FIG. 88. Prisons for Aix. He pierces the substructure by a watercourse-hardly for any practical reason, but surely so as to express with extreme intensity his cherished pattern of interpenetra- tion: "Chacun a sa maniere de sentir, de s'exprimer. L'homme eleve . . . ne compose pas avec le moment, il suit l'impression qui le domine." 141 In the project of the Chapel of Bourneville,142 vaulted corridors cross the substructure. On their intersection, in the center of a circular hall, the altar is situated, lighted by the height of the dome. Obviously the artis- tic intention here is simply another version of inter- penetration. 136 Levallet, 110, classifies, "d'un style assyro-6gyptien." Raval, 26, surpasses this simile by conjuring up the architec- turally rather unknown entrances to Dante's Hell and the abode of the Minotaurus. 137 Ledoux, 22, n. 1. 138 Goetghebuer, P.

Palace for Sisteron. The still existing Pavillon de Louveciennes, built for Madame Du Barry in 1771,143 became famous for its interior decoration, to which many excellent artists con- tributed, among them the painters Fragonard and Vien, and the sculptors Felix Lecomte and Augustin Pajou.144 (Some of Fragonard's panels representing the Romance of Love and Youth are now in the Frick Collection in New York) (fig. 91). The entrance hall, the dining room, and the salon are arrayed on a main axis in the traditional manner. The house itself is an oblong block with a protruding porch. The form of the semi-cylin- drical entrance hall has a special significance, in that it hollows out the block and thus visualizes space (fig. 92). At about the same time Robert Adam favored niches screened with columns. I don't think there was an inter- dependence between the two architects.

Pavillon de Louveciennes, played a greater role in the Guimard house: it is now the decisive factor. In 1783, Ledoux designed the Storehouse for Salt at Compiegne (today Fish market) 148 (fig. 96). Its partly extant entrance is an enormous niche running up almost to the gigantic brackets under the cornices. Here, however, Ledoux dispensed with screening col- umns. He could achieve greater monumentality by presenting the niche openly. It is a simple matter to observe Roman reminiscences on the Guimard house, or to point out the Greek models of its columns. Such superficial observation will not lead to a better under- standing of Ledoux, however. We must rather go behind the traditional forms to perceive his own archi- tectural thought which is so clearly expressed in the new spatial and surface patterns. Having seen how Ledoux grappled with the prob- lem of bringing spatial effects into plain blocks,149 we begin to comprehend the significance of a feature like the lunette over the portal of the Halwil house 150 (fig. 69) and the frequent application of sunken panels in general, about 1800. Today, glass construction permits the concept of volume versus mass to be presented far better than was possible in former times. Let us not fail to observe that this artistic ideal preceded the tech- nical potential, just as eighteenth-century cubism pre- ceded the era of concrete. A further method for visualizing the third dimension was the superposition of blocks of diminishing sizes, the concept of the terrace house. An instance of this method is the project of the Lauzon house 151 (fig. 83) a more outspoken example, the project of the chateau 148 L.R., pl. 106, 107. Levallet, 75. 149 In this connection I might refer to the garden front of H6tel de Valentinois (later, de Mlle Mars). Thiery, Guide 1: 143; Jarry, in Vieux H6tels, ser. 18, pl. 1; and Lefeuve, fasc. 15, p. 3, tell of Ledoux' work on the house, which, however, seems to be by Visconti, after Normand fils, Paris moderne 1: pls. 53-56, Paris, 1837, and Krafft, J.-C., Choix des plus jolies maisons de Paris, pls. 3-5, Paris, n. d. 150 See n. 94. 151 See n. 114. of M. de Barail 152 (fig. 97). The latter is a four- storied, stepped building on a rectangular plan. The ground floor and a mezzanine formed one block carry- ing a terrace. Out of the center of this rise the second and third floors, topped by a belvedere. The aspect of the whole is that of a stepped building. One might again interpret the structure as an instance of rever- beration of a large block by smaller ones, or as an instance of vertical interpenetration (telescopic effect). How we put it does not matter, the essential thing is to recognize the artist's idea. His intention was a pat- tern of antithetical elements. It seems obvious that Ledoux was not motivated by the "zoning" laws when he created this new form, and we are safe in conclud- ing that he was inspired by an aesthetic ideal. The square, subdivided into four courts, became one of the most popular plans for public buildings in the nineteenth century. On this concept of the sub-divided square, about 1783 Ledoux designed an office building for the Ferme Generale, between the rues de Grenelle sopitiae (fig 95) Hi E'.s primary- ide was tot set wh S ie the uppe the storie ros only abv th central ; g ..... .. # ..3 E X : ; M.; ..

His primary idea was to set off the main body f rom a sturdy podium with monu- mental portals. The podium alone was a full square, while the upper three stories rose only above the central cross and there were only two side wings. This scheme recommended itself from a practical point of view. By giving up a few rooms, Ledoux obtained more light and air for all the others. Of greater interest is the artistic solution: interpenetration of masses (three structures crossing the central structure) ; interpenetration of vol- ume and mass (the intruding courts) ; and the super- posed belvederes. 152L.R., pls. 264-266. 153 L.R., pls. 95-100. Avertissenient states that Ledoux was nominated architect of the Fermes in 1782. Thi6ry, Almanach, 358, 1784, says, "D'apres les travaux commences par M. Ledoux pour la reconstruction entiere de cet H6tel, on peut juger que ce batiment presentera une masse imposante. La corniche . . . annonce un caractere male, ainsi que les portes d'entree."

The project for the Rural School of Meilliand 156 was planned as a Greek cross building on a square sub- structure (fig. 100). Whereas the Rotonda of Pal- ladio,157 or his Villa Trissini,158 presented "integral wholes," 159 the Rural School consists of unrelated up- per and lower portions. The substructure, moreover, is not a compact mass but a vast open hall on arcades. Decomposition of the whole is the chief character- istic of the project of a country house in the Parc de Bellevue 160 (fig. 101). The plain block opens in an arcade; oversized stairs are loosely appended to it; a columned belvedere is awkwardly set on top of the roof. The house is a piecemeal composition in which the elements have won more independence than the whole can put up with. Traditional buildings were com- mislead us. He, and his progressive colleagues, passed from this concept to a new one, "die freie Vereinigung selbstandiger Existenzen," as I said, Von Ledoux, 17, adding, 19, "Das ist ein hauptsdchlicher Wesenszug des neuen Systems."

Here, every part represents insubordination.1'6' Architecture is in full revolution. Discrepancy of upper and lower parts also character- izes the project of a house on the rue Neuve de Berry 162 (fig. 102). Its basic idea is the unrelated juxtaposition of the cubic house with the semicircular substructure in front of it. Yet this whole complex with the dominant horizontals looks far more composed than the disrupted houses of Meilliand and Bellevue. The stage of tem- porary restoration of the old "order" was reached in architecture sooner than in politics. Further struggle for the new ideals in both fields belonged to the future. THE IDEAL OF INDIVIDUALISM Thus far we have traced the vicissitudes of Ledoux' development in his designs of single buildings. It now remains to deal with groups of buildings, and with his two greatest projects: the tollhouses of Paris, called barrie'res, and the Ideal City.

From the simple juxtaposition of independent ele- ments Ledoux proceeded to the grouping of equivalent units on variegated geometrical plans. The House of Entertainment (Maison de plaisir) 164 was planned as a circular colonnade from which twelve two-storied ca- sinos would have projected radially, while the principal building was to be located within the colonnade (fig. 98). The complex was to be surrounded by a square garden with coachhouses in the four corners (fig. 75). For the Farmhouse de la Roche Bernard, Ledoux made two plans, each based on the Greek cross. The 164L.R., pls. 238, 239. This design, missing in the 1804 ed., should not be considered as belonging to the Ideal City, nor should Moreux, 64, speak of the megaron form of the houses, for they have two stories, each with three rooms, and many windows. one with the legend Bergerie is rather plain, with the main house in the center, and with outbuildings placed at different points of the cross-shaped court.165 The other with the legend Ferme paree shows a complicated pattern of rectangular and polygonal forms.166 The Gate of the Parc de Bourneville 167 is a further curious instance of Ledoux' experiments (fig. 105). Two small circular structures form the bases for tall columns, a central oblong house bridges the road be- tween them.

Kunst- wissenschaft 64: 219, 1924, I pointed out the significance of the gridiron plan in Ledoux' and Durand's works, declaring this scheme to be a noteworthy new start in planning. Raval and Moreux accept this view. Yet they are mistaken in finding, 34, 51, the pattern on the Saiseval House, and praising it as a new solution. Looking closer at the layout, they could see that Ledoux did not think, here, of a checkerboard arrangement, of eight houses, but presents the group of three buildings with small coachhouses tzwice, in front and in the rear of the plot. There are not "huit blocs egaux." Ramee says, "se composant de trois pavillons," and the view reveals, unmistakably, an ensemble of three houses with the main accent on the central one. Raval and Moreux apply the concept they borrowed to the wrong place. Still more curious is that Moreux, 45, al- ready finds the gridiron scheme in the sixteenth century. Were repetition of independent motifs has its own history, which I plan to discuss in a forthcoming book on the entire eighteenth century development. this correct, then he, 51, could not speak of Ledoux' "nouvelle solution." But the drawing he refers to has nothing to do with architectural planning. It is the well known figure of a man, reproduced in many Vitruvius editions, to demonstrate the theory of exemplary proportions. To make the point clearer, the draughtsman of the Cesariano edition, 1521, set the figure off against a system of coordinates. This superficial similarity makes Moreux think of a plan craticulaire, without questioning the meaning of the design. Moreover, the Renais- sance theory to be set forth with this figure, is diametrically opposed to the concept of the gridiron plan. The latter means geometrisation, the former, tending toward humanisation or organisation, wants the architectural "body" related to the human body. FIG. 105.

The Commercial Building (Maison de Commerce), on the rue St. Denis,170 was planned on a nine-partite square (fig. 107). Here again there is much reciprocity 1)etween the single features, but no formal interplay. Ledoux' last opportunity to present his creative power came to him through a man of the New World. About 1787 the American Hosten asked him to build a private residence for him on a large corner lot on the rue Saint- Georges (fig. 109), and fourteen other houses to be rented.171 Rather than dwell on the single plans which prove Ledoux' inventiveness in practical solutions, I 170 L.R., pls. 221-225.

He strove to master the problem of the multiplicity of these houses, chiefly by the simple device of juxtaposition, and by the diversified treatment of the facades. These late designs have little in common with his previous experiments, nor with anything in architecture that came before or after him. Ledoux was a searcher to the end. The incertitude of the era did not allow him to reach a clear-cut formula. It is easy to find the negative char- acteristics of the designs; difficult to characterize them positively. They almost completely lacked Baroque gradation and concatenation, depending largely on the effect of contrasted arches and rows of rectangular openings (houses 4, 5) (fig. 111). There was much unrest in the facades, despite the monotony of the array FIG. 107. Commercial building.</page><page sequence="69">498 KAUFMANN: THREE REVOLUTIONARY ARCHITECTS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. FIG. 108. Hosten houses, 11-14. of equal apertures. Particularly characteristic were the houses Nos. 1, 2, 3 which, screened by two rows of columns, look like one building 172 (fig. 110). Houses 11-14 showed by alternating projections, the pattern of rigid juxtaposition 173 (fig. 108). This last known production of Ledoux serves to throw some light on his personality. Apparently he was aware that he had not attained his ultimate goal in finding a new form. Even so, he did not, like the Revivalists, turn back to the past as long as there was any hope to attain something new. The Hosten houses represent a last attempt and a last failure. The architect's life work ends with the confession: Non possumus. All his ex- periments were just as premature as those of the politi- cal revolution. Yet they were not in vain. While the precursor might fail, the revolutionary ideas lived on, challenging those who came after, to take up the struggle for their realization. Now let us turn to a much earlier project which at first glance looks just as enigmatic as the Hosten houses, but in reality, was much sounder. It was a true link between the past and the future, a consistent step in the continuous line of the architectural development. The country house planned for the Princesse de Conti at Louveciennes,174 was to be a bold and grand combina- tion of contrasted masses and voids, erected on a slop- ing ground (fig. 112). On the lowest level were to be three rectangular courts, side by side; on the next level 172 L.R., pl. 188. 173 LR., pl. 183. 174L.R., pls. 273-277. The Princesse de Conti named in the engravings was, most probably, Louise Elisabeth who spent all her life at Versailles and died 1775. Cf. Capon, G., Vie dnt Prince de Conity, 377, Paris, 1907. Ledoux may have made the designs when he worked for Mme Du Barry. Levallet, 62, is not impressed by the great composition, "C'est un defi au bon sens ... tout y est inutile." Raval, 33, believes that in it Ledoux tried to get rid of his "complex of failure." This is unlikely for up to the early 1780's he was successful and self-confident (cp. n. 42). the hothouses; higher up the H-shaped main building; and at the far end, on the highest level, a huge columned niche. The voids would have been the three courts sunk into the rising ground, the courts within the H-form, and the spherical vaulting of the niche. The mass of the main building was to be somewhat relieved by arcades; that of the hothouses by a deep loggia. The single structures would not have been tied together for- mally, but brought into some unity only by their array on the central principal axis. This, and only this, is the Baroque heritage in the great project. In it Ledoux would have accomplished a strange, but truly monu- mental spatial composition. Showing both the consist- ency of the traditional layout and the soundness of cubism, it can be considered as a landmark on the cross- roads of two architectural epochs-the Baroque and the modern. I have attempted to trace the development of the architect, showing how he passed from Baroque formal- ity, through rare classicizing performances, to pure ge- ometry; how he aimed at bringing life into the rigid masses, and how in the large complexes he advanced from juxtaposition to more complicated patterns. Yet when the last great opportunity came with the Hosten commission, he had not won clarity at all. He was still hampered by that uncertainty which Blondel had re- marked at the outset of the revolutionary movement,175 and had nothing to offer but a new experiment. VII.

Some of these projects were too bold to be acceptable to the patrons.178 While working on the tollhouses, which though commonly known as barrieres, were called Pro- pylaea of Paris by Ledoux,179 he planned also several inns (guinguettes) .180 In 1787 the work done by him was considered too expensive and too extravagant. Public opinion was so aroused-"Le mur murant Paris rend Paris murmurant"-that the commission was taken from him two years later. The barrie'res were badly damaged in the Revolu- tion 181 (fig. 128). A few years after their mutilation, the French National Convention decided that these relics of the monarchy-"des pierres . . . entassees par la tyrannie"-be transformed into memorials to honor the revolutionary' victories and preserved as "monu- ments publics." 182 Most of the barrieres were finally FIG. 109. Hosten's own house, 15. destroyed in 1859. Today, only four are still extant: the almost unaltered Barriere du Tr6ne ** (or, de Vincennes), place de la Nation; the Barriere d'En- fer,*** terminating the Route d'Orleans; the Barriere de Saint-Martin ** (or, de la Villette) ,183 powerful still in its deterioration, and the small Rotunda in the map, 1: 41. Occasionally we add other names from L.R.; the map of the Fermiers generaux, reproduced in B. Soc. Hist. Paris, 120, 1912; the map of Paris by Paul Verniquet, 1791; that in Legrand and Landon; that by Th. Jacoubet, which shows the plans of all the barrieres as they were 1836; and from Louis Prudhomme, AMiroir hist. . . . de Paris 1: 56, and map, Paris, 1807. In this text, asterisks refer to Saint-Victor's plates, reproduced in our figs. 113 (one), 120 (two), 127 (three).

Parc de Monceau, also called Barriere de Chartres,184 (fig. 114) which up to recent times was in a shameful state of degradation, and thus a witness to how little Ledoux was thought of in his country. THE HERITAGE OF THE PAST Anyone interested in the artistic significance of the barri'eres, rather than in factual data and insignificant similarities with ancient works,185 will be richly re- munerated in scrutinizing all the projects. Some are reminiscent of the Renaissance (Barriere de la Croix- Blanche,* 186 and the similar "Project V," 187) ; nearly 184L.R., pls. 3, 4. Verniquet, "Barriere de Chartres." 185 Levallet has gathered much valuable material about the executed barrieres, but disregards the proj ects and the guin- guettes.

Yet it is not enough to exclaim "Paestum" when confronted with the Barriere de Courcelles,* or "Cecilia Metella" in front of Saint-Martin.** 188 The "professeur circon- snrit dans les cinq ordres," 189 as Ledoux calls those who ever and again look for ancient models, will find it hard to grasp the artist's intentions. Even those few barrie'res where Ledoux rather strictly follows ancient models deviate from the cliche in char- acteristic details. The project of the Barriere de Cour- celles (rue de Chartres),190 for instance, is distinguished by the application of doors and small double stairs to the side fronts which, though perhaps conditioned by practical considerations, impair the solemnity of the Greek temple scheme, dependent largely on the empha- sis of the longitudinal axis. For this main axis, lead- ing from the portal to the sanctuary, terminated the processional road. (It is, of course, irrelevant whether a cult made use of this road, or availed itself only of its inherent symbolism.) The project of the Barriere des Rats ** (or d'Aunai) 191 is a simple peripteros. (In the execution, Ledoux applied columns ringed with square drums.) The project of the Barriere de Gen- tilly *;** (or, de l'Oursine, or de la Glaciere) 192 is an amphiprostyle, with the oddity of the single window on 188 Hautecoeur, Louis, Rome et la renaissance de l'antiquite d la fin du 18e siecle, 140, Paris, 1912, "Ledoux dans ses bar- rieres imite Poestum (a Courcelles), il unit au dorique des souvenirs de Cecilia Metella (a Saint-Martin)." 189 L., 135. 190 L.R., pls. 1, 2. 191 L.R., pl. 9.

The Barriere Saint-Jacques *** (or, d'Arcueil) presents arcades instead of colon- nades.193 Project VII is a variant of the Roman Pan- theon.194 Except these and a few more temple-like barrieres, such as those of Saint-Mande,** Charenton ** (or, Marengo),195 and Bercy,*** 196 the vast majority differ widely from the models of antiquity. The bar- rie'res of Monceau * 197 and Montreuil ** 198 present columns densely covered with rings, which impart to the traditional feature a new expressiveness. It does not lessen Ledoux' claim as an innovator that occa- sionally he designed a capricious thing like the cabin of the police-galley belonging to the Barriere de la Rapee,199 surrounded by arcades with twin columns (fig. 116). The barrie're itself shows cross-arms emerg- ing from the cylindrical body. Ledoux seemed particularly fond of ringed coluns which remind us of those described by Sebastiano Serlio as of "cinte dalle fascie Rustiche" 200 (Barriere de Chail- lot,* better known as de l'Etoile, or de Neuilly, and many others). Yet there is a considerable difference between the Renaissance columns and those of Ledoux. Serlio's stone bands look as if they were of flexible 193 S.-V. 3: 842 bis. 194 L.R., pl. 36. 195 S.-V. 3: 840 bis, both. 196 Ibid., 842 bis. 197 Ibid., 839 bis. 198 Ibid., 840 bis. 199 L.R., pl. 14. 200 Sebastiano Serlio, Extraordinario libro di architettura, text to plate I, Lione, 1551.</page><page sequence="72">. .,., .., . ........... ....... .I- - " : x - ::::: ........... . ..... - - :::- :-: ::::: ' -- - ..'.-- ,.- . ....

Vignola, too, joined similar columns to the wall,201 while Ledoux' square drums vir- tually tear the shafts apart, without establishing any connection with the wall. Eventually he presented twin columns held together by broad bands (Barrieres de la rue Royale * or de Montmartre,202 d'Enfer *** or d'Or- 201 Same, Regole generali di architettura, fol. xiii, ill. fol. xiv, Venetia, 1537.

Sometimes he cre- ated a vigorous pattern by duplicating the outline of the pediments (Barriere des Vertus,* 204 de l'Observa- tion,*** or Paillassons; des Fourneaux *** or Voie- rie,205). Often he inserts a heavy keystone in the tympanum (Des Fourneaux,*** des Ministres,*** or 203 Ibid., 842 bis, both. 204 Ibid., 839 bis. 205 Ibid., 842 bis, both. .0 .. . .. . . - - -W ----------0 FIG. 114.

PHIL. SOC. FIG. 121. Barriere Chemin de Chaillot. Grenelle).*0 Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor had already dramatized doors and windows by oversized keystones. But we should not infer that Ledoux copied them. It was the same spirit of revolt against tradition that in- spired all progressive architects in the Age of Reason. Those gigantic keystones were no longer willing merely to perform their humble tasks; they asserted themselves in the boldest way. To Ledoux the Palladian motif no longer meant what it had meant to Renaissance and Baroque architects; the expression of perfect gradation and concatenation; the symbol of the integral whole formed by the ruling central part and the subservient sides. Ledoux frequently changed the dynamics or the rhythms of the motif. In some cases he made the central arch protrude into the pediment (Passy,* or Sainte-Marie; Reservoir,* or de la Pompe de Chaillot; 207 Vaugirard; *** Observa- tion *** 208) ;in others he inserted three higher arches between the low rectangulart sides (Clichy; * 209 Cha- ronne ** or Fontarabie 210) or even five (Fortaine- bleau,*** or d'Italie 211). This means that he proceeded from the well balanced rhythm of the Palladian motif to a pattern in which equivalence was more important 206 Ibid., 842 bis, both. 207 Ibid., 839 bis, both. 208 Ibid., 842 bis, both. 209 Ibid., 839 bis. 210 Ibid., 840 bis. 211 Ibid., 842 bis.

A forceful variation of the motif pre- sents twin columns between the arches (Belleville; ** Menilmontant; ** 212 Enfer; *** Bord de l'Eeau,*** or Cunette,213 ). All these transformations of tradi- tional features reflect the unrest that had come over architecture. MODERN COMPOSITION Many of the patterns which we have discussed in the foregoing chapter appear also in the barrieres. The Barriere des Bons-Hommes,* or de Passy, de la Con- ference,214 has a porch similar to that of the Guimard House. The Barrieres de Longchamps,* de Mont- martre,* or des Martirs,215 resemble the Tabary house; the Barriere de l'Ecole Militaire *** 216 opens in a deep niche like the Storage House of Compiegne. A note- worthy feature of the Barrieres des Bons-Hommes * (fig. 128) and de l'Ecole Militaire *** is the top-heavy upper part, which the architect Legrand has already observed.217 The extant tollhouses of the Barriere du Tr6ne present the contrast of the solid block to the void FIG. 123. Project II for the barrieres. of the niche.218 Interpenetration of voids into mass is visualized also in a project for the Chemin des Car- 219 20 rieres, resembling the Barriere du Reservoir.* 220 The Barriere Picpus ** exhibits in its plan the same basic idea: 221 semi-circular niches invade the cube on 212 Ibid., 840 bis, both. 213Ibid., 842 bis, both.

The cylindrical belvedere was omitted in the execution.222 In the Barriere de la Chopinette,** near the end of the Chemin Saint- Laurent,223 Ledoux carved out of the block deep niches on the front and the back fa?ades. In the Barriere des Trois Couronnes,** or Ramponneau,224 both intersect- ing masses and emphasized volume can be seen in the arms of the Greek cross and the deep porches. The Barriere Pantin,** or du Combat du Taureau, or de la Boyauterie, or de Saint Louis, was erected on a triangular plan, with bevelled corners and niches on each side.225 Contrasted cubic masses form the principal motif of the projects for the Barriere Saint-Hypolite, also called des Groseillers, and de la Sante.226 The former, planned on the Greek cross, presents a pedimented block to which lower blocks with slanting roofs on each side are added (fig. 118). The upper part of the wall is flat and unpierced, the lower has horizontal grooves. The Barriere de la Sante is composed of elementary FIG. 124. Project I for the barrieres. geometrical shapes (fig. 119). From the prismatic podium a tall cubic tower rises, with three tiny aper- similarity. There is, moreover, on the map nothing like a Porticus A. But there is the legend Porticus a S. P. Q. R. amoenitati dicata. Moreux, apparently ignoring that a is a Latin preposition, has read only half of the legend. 222 S.-V. 3: 840bhis. 223 L.R., pls. 6, 7. S.-V. 3: 840 bis. Raval and Moreux, fig. 260, illustrate la Chopinette, but present, 66, its plan as that of Belleville. This latter denomination is wrong, according to the maps, though it appears in L.R., Table and plates. Moreux again finds a somewhat similar shape in the plan of a dock (navalia) in Piranesi's map, believing that Ledoux picked it out for an entirely different purpose. Yet Ledoux' greatness was being an explorer, not an exploiter. 224 L.R., pl. 8. S.-V. 3: 840bis, altered. 225 Plan in Jacoubet's map. S.-V. 3: 840 bis, elevation. Moreux, 66, unaware that in the eighteenth century many de- signed triangular plans in France and England, turns to Piranesi's map and discovers a tomb as the inspiration of Ledoux. Since the latter's plan shows a completely different arrangement of some identical features, Moreux dubs -it pompously "Metathese du Sepulchrum Agrippae." 226 L. R., pl. 19, both.

The cylindrical belvedere on top is capped by a hemisphere; the four crossarms projecting from the tower are covered with heavy barrel vaults. This project fascinates even twentieth-century observ- ers, accustomed to monumental simplicity and bold con- trasts. Instances of interpenetrating masses are the Rotunda of Monceaux,227 and the tollhouses of Reuilly.** 228 Their cylindrical bodies emerge from circular colon- nades so that a telescopic effect results. Of great in- terest are a few designs which show top-heavy cylinders rising from low substructures: the Barriere Chemin de Chaillot 229 (fig. 121), "Project VI" 230 (fig. 115), and the Barriere Saint-Martin.** 231 The architect Nicolas Goulet commented upon this last: Cette architecture, pleine de force et de grace, n'est ni egyptienne, ni grecque, ni romaine, c'est de I'architecture franqaise: elle est neuve, et l'artiste n'en a puise le gout et les formes que dans son imagination.232 Saint Victor praised it: "la plus belle de toutes." 233 227 L.R., pls. 3, 4. 228L.R., pls. 12, 13.

Barriere du Maine, May 1, 1791, after the excise was abolished. The Barriere du Roule * is less classical than most barrie'res with its disproportion, with the conflict of the verticals and the horizontals, and the contrast of dis- parate features-arches on rusticated columns below, oblong openings in smooth walls, above.234 "Project II" 235 (fig. 123) and the similar Barriere du Maine *** 236 belong to Ledoux' most dramatic de- signs. Both show a grand crescendo: the broad, rusti- cated substructure carries twin houses which are held together by a windowless wall, concave in the project, flat in the execution. The steps on top of the portal, practically of no use, point upwards to the belvedere crowning the structure (fig. 127). We may under- stand these grand compositions best from a passage in L'Architecture proclaiming Ledoux' artistic program: Souvent; tres-souvent, j'offrirai cette ordonnance libre et debarrassee de ses entraves, cette ordonnance qui plait avec de belles masses, et doit sa pompe 'a 1'economie sub- sidiaire, a des oppositions bien entendues.237 "Project III," 238 a tollhouse surmounted by a rostral column, is a highly original assemblage of incongruous features (fig. 122).

The Barriere Saint-Denis,* as it was car- ried out, was a sober classicizing edifice.241 "Project I" 242 shows two houses held together by the common gable and the powerful horizontal cylinder sitting astride the roof (fig. 124). The conflict between the opposed principles of isolation and unification is evident. "Proj- ect IV" is similar.243 A high arch bridges the gateway between the two units. On the sides the central por- tion recedes on a semi-circular plan, creating an effec- tive void in the mass. The inns, which were to be erected on certain main roads of Paris,244 recapitulate in brief the architectural development in the eighteenth century in all its fluctua- tions. The plans are modern in the sense of 1800, i.e., geometrized. All are squares except the one for the faubourg Saint-Marceau; this is a triangle inscribed in a circle 245 (fig. 135). The elevations differ widely in character. The inn for the faubourg Poissonniere presents Baroque gradation; the main accent is put on the central dome, secondary accents on the end- pavilions 246 (fig. 130). In the inn, Quai de la Rapee, however, little is left of Baroque unity (fig. 131). It consists of three structures loosely connected by long- stretched arcades which veil the four-partite square of the court.247 Space-mass antagonism, visualized by plain stereometrical forms, shows in the Inn of Chaillot (fig. 132). A flat-roofed, unpierced cylinder replaces the upward-pointing dome. The traditional supremacy of the center has been abolished.248 The disintegration of the old scheme becomes manifest on the Inn for the faubourg du Temple (fig. 133). Here there is no longer any relationship between the center and the pavilions.249 In the inn, faubourg Saint-Marceau, gra- dation and concatenation are superseded by the simple juxtaposition of three cylinders rising on the corners of an equilateral triangle 250 (fig. 134). This means absolute equality of the elements-none is exalted over the other-and equality of aspect from all sides. The pageant of the pictorial Baroque fa?ade has gone. Stern geometry has replaced, for the moment, the concept of organization. The chronological order of these projects can be ignored. The rivaling concepts lived side by side, each striving to hold its ground. One who faces the Barrieres Saint-Martin ** and du Tr6ne ** must be impressed by the vigorous treatment of the stone.

The project of the Barriere de l'Ecole Militaire,252 would have shown porches composed of rough blocks set against the fronts (fig. 126). The execution of the latter was less powerful, drawing its principal effect from the deep entrance niche alone.*** The double program of dramatized composition and exaltation of the material underlies most of the barrie'res, and most of Ledoux' entire work. It is laid down in the following passage from L'Architecture: Je differencierai la decoration pour la presenter dans ses contrastes. La pierre, sous la touche de l'art, eveillera un nouveau sentiment, developpera ses propres facultes.253 VIII. THE IDEAL CITY Une ville s'elevera....254 PLAN Ledoux in his Architecture illustrates two different projects for the Saltworks. In the first,255 he confines himself to the manufactory and the living quarters of the personnel; in the second, he adds the plan of the city which he would build around the Saltworks, nam- ing it Chaux, after a nearby forest 256 (fig. 140). Part of the second project was carried out between the vil- lages of Arc and Senans, in the Franche-Comte. The still existing structures are in a ruinous condition. In 1926 the owner of the estate, afraid that the authorities in charge of the preservation of historical monuments might prevent him from tearing down some parts dam- aged by fire, decided to act before they made up their minds, and blewv up a portion of the complex with dyna- mite.257 Ledoux still rated very low in his country at that time. Previously, ignorance had destroyed the majority of his buildings; now this main work of his was wrecked. The plan of the First Project shows all the houses coherently arranged around a square court, with bor- dering alleys forming an outer square (fig. 136). Within the court, diagonal corridors serve as addi- tional communications between the central pavilions. The pattern of the ground plan is strictly geometrical. However, the main front is, in all its plainness, basically 251 L.R., pl. 31. 252 L.R., pl. 23. 253L., 14. Lacroix, Paul, Le dix-huitieme siecle, 378, Paris, 1878, after having censured Ledoux' bad taste, remarks, "Ce qu'on admirait le plus dans les nouvelles barrieres, c'etait la coupe des pierres." This masterly stone cutting can be seen on the extant barrieres and in the large plates of Dimier (see n. 218). 254 L., 1. 255L., pl. 12. L.R., pl. 113. 256L., 35; pI. 14.

The main entrance is marked by a portico of four large, ringed columns. The geometrical layout is masked by a conventional front with a dominant center and subordinated sides. The practical disposition is as follows: The forefront contains the gateway, flanked by the apartments of the director and the employees; the left corner pavilion houses the circular chapel with the altar in its center, that to the right, the bakery. The wings and the pa- vilion of the lateral fronts include the homes of the workers. The rooms destined for the fabrication are located in the rear. The center of the court is marked by a fountain. The first plan was not satisfactory.259 Ledoux then made a Second Project, adding to the apartments and the workshops a number of buildings for common use, and fundamentally changing the general form (fig. 141). This time he decided on an elliptical arrange- ment.260 Its major diameter coincides with a stretch of the route leading from Besanuon to the river Loue; the minor forms part of the road connecting the villages Arc and Senans. The house of the director rises' in the center of the whole. On either side it is flanked by the factories; behind it the coach house has its place. In front, where the major diameter intersects the ellipse, 258L., pl. 13.

L.R., pl. 117. is the portico, inserted between the houses of the work- ers and employees. These buildings only were carried out. In the perspective view several other structures are shown: the city hall in the rear corresponding to the portico in front; the parsonage and the courthouse at the ends of the minor diameter; and the public baths on the perimeter of the first quadrant (fig. 140). Many further projects for the Ideal City are illustrated in L'Architecture, but are missing in the map and in the 2,61 ,th perspective view. In the latter, the picturesque build- ings seen in the immediate surroundings are apparently embellishments on the engraving, among them two churches with campanili, and the chateau with a crenel- lated tower. They are of little interest, although prob- ably not the engraver's but Ledoux' inventions. Incidentally, a few words may be said about the hy- gienic considerations of the architect, which show him well ahead of his time. Anxious to make the houses conducive to health, as well as commodious, he pro- vides orchards and kitchen gardens,262 and has the bedrooms facing south, the pantry north.263 Imbued with the new ideal of raising the standards of the work- ing class, he wants to promote in his city a new way of life,264 which will make the inhabitants healthier and happier.265 Ledoux was a good architect, firmly rooted 261 L., pl. 15.

What reasons may he have had for passing from the first to the second project? Had Ledoux only the practical in mind? In traites cheries, c'est pour cultiver un champ productif qui remplit les intervalles du travail, amuse ses loisirs." his text he declares that he conceived the first project without knowledge of the site; 266 and that he wanted to avoid the risk of the living quarters and the fur- 266 L. 65, "On avoit congu ce projet avant de connaitre la carte du pays." 67, "La connoissance des lieux change les premieres dispositions."</page><page sequence="83">512 KAUFMANN: THREE REVOLUTIONARY ARCHITECTS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. naces being under one roof.267 Accordingly, practical reasons would have prompted the change. But there is another passage in which he regrets having given up the convenient diagonal corridors of the original scheme, N8 adding a significant remark: If the inner square were replaced by a circle, some practical ad- vantages could be obtained, and besides, a "pure form" achieved.269 He praises the ellipse of the second proj- ect: "la forme est pure comme celle que decrit le soleil dans sa course." 270 There is no doubt, in his second project, Ledoux was guided by a definite formal ideal. Indeed, the practical necessities could well be satis- fied in different ways. Whoever has seen the site at Arc-et-Senans, knows that the wide plain allows for several alternative layouts. Ledoux' reference to the peculiarity of the site is merely one of those explana- tions architects habitually advance. It is wiser to rec- ommend a plan with practical advantages than with formal ideals. Detached structures of Baroque complexes, such as the pavilions of the Chateau of Marly,27' were related to each other even without direct contact. Their shapes, or tying lines such as alleys and canals, expressed their interrelationship. At Arc-et-Senans, the single units are aesthetically independent; each building-the direc- tor's house, the saltworks, the houses of the employees -might stand alone. Ledoux wanted both practical isolation and formal independence.272 Afraid that this might result in harshness or abruptness, he thinks of the simple device which Boullee applied: trees or shrubs make the whole more pleasant.273 Contrary to other Utopian cities, Chaux was con- ceived for an actual site. Ledoux' aim was not for pictorial effect by blending architecture with nature. Neither was he strictly utilitarian. He wanted to com- bine his new formal ideal with the new ideal of the garden-city. 267L., 67, "L'artiste sentit qu'il devoit tout isoler; que les habitations . . . les fourneaux devoient etre 'a l'abri de l'ad- herence." 268 L., 66, "La ligne diagonale inscrite dans un carre, sembloit reunir tous les avantages: elle acceleroit tous les services. 269L., 66, "Un cercle inscrit dans un carre n'auroit-il pas produit les memes avantages?

Here we remark that incertitude typical of the era. 270 L., 77. 271 Blomfield, R., History of French Architecture 1: pl.

To sum up, the first project is still a complex de- rived from the basic concept of Baroque building, which may be defined as follows: One part is to rule over the others and form with them an indivisible whole. The concept which underlies the second project was to be- come law in the future: Let the elements be free and of equal right. The momentous years which advanced the freedom of the individual brought freedom to the architectural elements as well. The second project fore- shadows the nineteenth century also in that it combines traditional features with a new composition. Though disguised by garments borrowed from the past, the architectural whole already conforms to a new formal ideal. In proceeding from one project to the other, the artist gave up the time-honored old pattern and moved on to its successor.274 It may be of some interest to compare the second project of Chaux with an almost contemporaneous struc- ture, the Royal Crescent of Bath, erected by John Wood, Jr., about 1770.275 The crescent, too, is on an elliptic plan, but its single buildings are moulded into a com- pact mass and its main front is on the concave, inner side of the ellipse. It embraces the site in front, just as the colonnades of Here de Corny, built in the 1750's, embrace the hemicycle of Nancy.276 The main front of Ledoux' not much later complex is, however, on the convex side; the houses withdraw from the entrance, avoiding contact with the surroundings instead of seek- ing it. As a city planner, Ledoux foresaw the nineteenth century. A precursor of Haussmann, the creator of modern Paris, he wrote: "Je presenterai les chemins destines 'a desobstruer l'interieur de la ville; ces magnifiques boulevards, sans exemple pour l'eten- due. . .. 277 In the second project of Chaux he abandoned the principle of the differentiation of the buildings according to their rank at the moment when the ideal of social hierarchy vanished: "Pour la premiere fois on verra sur la meme echelle la magnificence de la guinguette et du palais." 2 Ledoux did not want civic art to be strictly utilitarian, he did not want the city to be simply an agglomeration of houses; he wanted it to be the crown of all archi- tectural endeavors: . . .j'ai place tous les genres d'edifices que reclame l'ordre social, on verra des usines importantes . . . donner nais- sance a des reunions populeuses. Une ville s'elevera pour les enceindre et les couronner.279 274 The observation that the change from the first to the second project marks the fateful moment of transition from Baroque to post-Baroque architecture, was contained already in Von Ledoux, 16, 17. It was adopted by Raval, 24. 275 Green, M. A., Eighteenth century architecture of Bath, ill. p. 147, Bath, 1904. 276 Blomfield 2: pl.

UTILITARIAN BUILDINGS . .. ici c'est une ville naissante qui demande ce que la necessite prescrit.280 The buildings of practical purpose are to be dealt with first, since from them grew the project of the Ideal City. It is significant and symptomatic that an architect who was a member of the Royal Academy and a favorite of the upper circles of society devoted himself to utilitarian projects. The changed attitude towards the architect's function was a revolution in it- self. It was to widen the field of the architect's activi- ties to an extent never heard of before.28' No longer did designs of an humble structure lower the architect's prestige. Now it depends on him to ennoble his "lower" task: "Les projets les plus simples prennent la teinte de l'ame qui les conqoit." 282 The utilitarian building re- ceived full attention, for life and all its activities in the growing modern city were now to center around the worker.283 The Gateway leading into the precinct of the Salt- works (fig. 137) carried, according to the engraving, the inscription: SALINE DU ROI BATIE SOUS LE REGNE DE LOUIS XVI L'AN MDCCLXXVI 284 It was to house the room of the guards, the prison, and the bakery. With all the traditional apparatus of col- umns, entablature, etc., the porch of the Gateway has a character of its own. Its blocklike mass emerges from lower wings, its back wall is shaped as a grotto in un- hewn rock. Thus three non-homogeneous elements are combined: classical features, pseudo-natural Romantic finishing, and the new cubism. The spirit of inde- pendence, which created this modernized version of classical models, appears also in many passages of Le- doux' text. Ledoux rejects the impotent teachings of the past,285 and refuses obedience to authority.286 He rebukes the copyists who exploit others' ideas,287 and is 280 L., 101. 281 L., 25, "Est-il quelque chose que l'artiste puisse dedaigner? les thermes de Plutus, le hangard du negociant, la grange du cultivateur doivent porter son empreinte.

This entrance consists of a sturdy, squat lower portion and a disproportionately high triangular, sloping roof. The latter opens in three Venetian windows, which in liveli- ness form an effective contrast to the surface behind them. There is, moreover, on the walls of the ground floor, the dramatic contrast of smooth ashlar, the rusti- cation of the quoins, and the framing of the doors. The vigorous exploitation of the material is an outstanding characteristic of all the structures erected at Arc-et- Senans. Blondel, in his earlier years, had maintained that "matter does not count." 292 His pupil Ledoux holds that the material should be emphasized.293 Side- by-side with this modern tendency appears the Romantic trend-Architecture parlante 294 in the urns seemingly pouring forth the precious fluid, to tell us of the saline, the source of the city's wealth (figs. 137, 139, 142). Ledoux carefully designed each type of building needed in the growing city. The Houses of Commerce form a row of isolated units screened by arcades in front 295 (fig. 145). The Horse Pond 296 (fig. 146), the Fountain, the Building for the Evaporation of the saline water (Batiment de Graduation) ,297 are archi- tecturally of less interest. Commenting on the foun- tains, Ledoux inveighs against Baroque animism and illusionism, as "les tromperies de l'art." 298 He ridi- cules theatrical statuary, e.g., a Thetis pressing the water from her hair, or a Neptune whose mighty trident brings forth from the rock a poor rivulet. All this is to him bluff, "Tout est imposture." 299 What had seemed "natural" to the Baroque, was bad theatre to the revolutionary. The Bourse of Chaux is a peripteral temple rising on a high stepped podium 300 (fig. 144).

Ledoux' Bourse, like that of Brongniart in Paris, already reveals the end of the era of revolutionary e'lan and the rise of the mor- bid style of the Empire. According to his text, Ledoux planned the Bourse in the center of the Ideal City, but it does not appear on the map, nor in the perspective view of the city. Similar discrepancies occur frequently in L'Architecture, owing perhaps, to the fact that his designs and the text originated, at different times. In his comments on the Bourse, Ledoux discusses eco- nomic problems, condemning speculation and defending honest trading.30' Ledoux' interest in his city manifests itself in visions of the life of its prospective population, the "peuplade laborieuse, dans le plus beau lieu du monde." 302 He shows the church approached by solemn processions,303 and the market with its buzzing activity.304 The Mar- ket, situated in the outskirts of Chaux, is planned on a square, subdivided into nine rectangles (fig. 149). The raised central structure is contrasted with the lower 301 L., 126, "dans une ville que la philosophie fonda, c'est le rassemblement d'hommes choisis, qui traitent de bonne foi, soit en matieres reelles, soit en echanges.

Here we see again the system of independent pavilions which we found in the second project of Chaux, and in the schemes for the Discount Bank.306 This system appears also in the Gun Foundry (Forge 'a canons),307 where the main accent has been shifted from the center to the pyramids in the corners (fig. 143). It is characteristic of both the Market and the Foundry that the single elements do not form into pictorial ensembles, contrary to the Baroque complexes where the parts of the house, foreground and back- ground, building and nature, are blended into a whole. No longer is the center the "heart" from which all "circulation" goes out and to which it returns; it is merely the crossing-point of the main axes.

Now, let us turn to a very humble building which shows that the doctrine of pure functionalism had also entered the thoughts of the Master of Dormans, the doctrine which had already been so fervently propa- gated by Carlo Lodoli about 1750. Ledoux must have been proud of his extremely plain little Grange (Grange paree) 309 (fig. 168). He puts the following words into the mouth of the granger whom he introduces as the imaginary builder: "ce petit edifice . . . porte 1'em- preinte de mes facultes: tout ce que vous avez vu est motive par la necessite." 310 There is no "art" in the house, or in its setting,311 for to the granger art is waste.312 The inclination towards the ideal of func- tionalism,313 and the hostility against decoration,314 are 308 L., pl. 7. 309 L., 48, "la masse est carree," pl. 5. 310 L., 49. 311 L., 48, "La situation, favorisee par la nature, ne devoit rien 'a I'art." 312 L., 50, "A quoi bon toutes ces impostures? tous ces outrages de l'art absorbent les produits." 313 L., 65, "Le sentiment appreie d'un plan est 'a I'abri de toute domination.

Obviously, Ledoux was familiar with the current ideas of his time. The main problem is how he reacted to these ideas, not how much or how little he owed to others. The quest for the "creator" of a style need not preoccupy the historian too much, for the problem of precedence, apart from being practically insoluble, is secondary. Important is the recognition of the ideas at work in the particular period. The great artist is not a man taking one detail from here and another from there. He is rather like a focal point in which rays from all directions converge, are assimilated, and finally emerge in a new form. Ledoux' main ob- jectives were to overcome the past and to present the new individualism. (The trend toward the latter is clearly stated in a passage on the Recreational Build- ing.315) Whatever "rays" reached him, he bent them to his own will, whether he preached the Lodolian creed or the principles of geometrization. Either way ap- peared promising to him who called himself "l'archi- tecte puriste," 316 and he incessantly inveighed against the "savants de convention." 317 With the self-will of a great personality he always worked toward his own ends. So it was possible for him in one breath to ad- vocate both functionalism and, suddenly, pass to geo- metrization.318 One of the most striking instances of Ledoux' artistic intentions is the Coopery (Atelier des cercles) 319 (fig. 171). It is a plain cube, the four fronts of which are formed by gigantic concentric circles inscribed in fram- naissance, qui s'ecrasent sous le poids du faux gofit; ces corniches qui rampent comme les reptiles du desert, et epousent tous les vices." 108, "des surfaces tranquilles, peu d'accessoires." 118, "Moins on divise les surfaces, plus elles paroissent grandes." 204, "Etablissez de belles masses, preparez d'heureux contrastes . . . soyez avare de ces accessoires que la mode commande." 315 L., 172, "On peut voir dans les plans et elevations 1'esprit qui a dicte cet etablissement; tout est isole, tout est appercu."

Market Marche. ing squares. After having met the functionalist Ledoux in the Grange, we find him here an extremist of geo- metrical formalism. In these two designs, the wide span of the era itself is reflected-an era avid for the unheard-of, wherever it could be found. The Grange not only recalls Lodoli, but also Rousseau, and the Coopery may be interpreted as a document of a new formalism, as well as an outstanding instance of "Nar- rative" architecture. Ledoux did not content himself with the simple apposition of shallow symbols, like the manyi who put lyres on the walls of a theatre, or Mer- cury's caduceus on a commercial building. Eventually we find him applying fasces to one of his stern cubes.320 But in the Coopery he goes beyond the literary sign- board symbolism and transforms this entire building into a fantastic pattern representative of its purpose, which he himself finds pregnant with meaning.32' Par- enthetically I want to point out here that Ledoux was deeply interested in the pseudo-scientific physiognomical studies of the era.322 The Bridge across the Loue is supported by piers in the form of ancient galleys (fig. 148). Yet the presentation of classic shapes was not at all Ledoux' 320 Cp. below the descriptions of the Pacifere and the Panare- teon. 321 L., 179, note, "un edifice qui s'empreint de l'emanation du sujet qui l'autorise."

Porches of eight columns each are added to all four sides; above the center a low saucer dome finishes the whole. The horizontals prevail, contributing greatly to the repose- ful character of the sanctuary. This self-contained, static church is a far cry from the cathedrals of the Baroque, with their dynamics, their domes with ascend- ing ribs, and their Latin-cross plans which make the nave look like an extended arm. Yet even the Greek cross seems to Ledoux not to be sufficiently restrained. He girds his church with a low stone screen adorned with narrative reliefs. In the four corners of this sacred precinct are cemeteries planted with cypresses (one each for men, women, boys, and girls). Contrary to Baroque structures with their inviting gestures, the Church of Chaux does not communicate with the outer world. The churches of the counter-reformation prom- ised ecstatic delights; Ledoux' church promises peace and quiet. 323L., 45, 46; pls. 3, 4. L.R., pls. 108, 109. 324 L., 3. 325L., pl. 72.

The bare, windowless walls are reminiscent of the Paris Pantheon after its transformation in the Revolu- tion. Only very low, narrow doors, hardly perceptible from the outside, lead into the church of Chaux. Its interior, no doubt, was influenced by the Parochial Church of Blondel. Ledoux, too, places the main altar in the center,326 high above the level of the entrance doors. Thus the worshipper is compelled to look up- wards from the moment he steps into the church. He will then ascend the stairs in the eastern or western cross arm, and during the service will stay in one of the two other cross-arms on the level of the altar, and is himself now lifted above the plane on which every- day life proceeds. Utilizing Blondel's ideas, Ledoux imparts extraordinary solemnity to the room which, to a great extent, is achieved by the unpierced walls. Light falls from the height of the dome alone, sublimating and exalting the altar while the vaulted cross-arms are dipped in mystic darkness torn by the flicker of the torches. Ledoux tells of his intentions quite explic- itly.327 There is no point in comparing this great combination of Romantic expressiveness and the aus- terities of cubism with the Roman Pantheon. The wish to separate neatly all the parts of the Church controls the disposition of the crypt and the cemeteries.328 Only subsidiary stairs connect them in- 326 Cf. Cochin, Misotechnites, 93, and pt.

The extremely sensitive architect disliked the idea that the worship by the liv- ing and the rites for the dead be performed in the same, or in contiguous rooms. The "incense of joy and that of sorrow should not mingle." 329 Directly from out- side, below the raised aisles for the congregation, steps lead down into the crypt, from which the cemeteries can be entered. In this whole arrangement we find once again "Narrative" architecture in a refined and elab- orated form. TIhe visitor approaching the crypt will have the sensation of the earth opening wide. Suddenly he will pass from bright daylight into the darkness of the nether world. The architect does not say to which denomination the church is dedicated. He mentions rather vaguely side altars consecrated to the virtues and the most mo- mentous events in human life, birth and marriage.330 It may be of interest to note that he recommends cre- mation for hygienic reasons.33' Much the same ideas guided Ledoux when he con- ceived the Chapel of the Director's House 332 (fig. 159). Two stories are combined into a single room. From the lower story, steps lead up to the altar placed in front of a niche. But the alter cannot be approached on its own level. Thus, it is radically separated from the wor- shippers assembling in the opposite tribune.

The composition is largely based on the contrast of these openings to the almost empty room. Such opposition of voids was the main motif also in one of the most remarkable interiors of the French Revolu- tion, the Hall of the National Convention in the Tuileries by Boullee's pupil, Jacques-Pierre Gisors.333 Ledoux' Chapel calls to mind the chapel in the Palace of Ver- sailles by Hardouin-Mansart. This architect of Louis XIV had placed the tribune on the second floor above the entrance, so that the king looked down upon the altar at the far end of the first floor. Ledoux, however, as- signs to the altar the most exalted and most exclusive position. In the execution, he had to simplify his design. L'Architecture illustrates both his first project and the one carried out.334 The lighting of this Chapel is similar to that of the Church: Only upon the spot where the priest is to stand, is the light to be thrown. You may believe that the Deity has descended from Heaven and has filled this place with all His majesty and splendour. . . . My chief aim was to eliminate diffused light, and to avoid any trifling accessories, so as to induce the faithful to contemplation and devotion. I had to arrange everything in a manner to exalt the sanctuary. The light falling upon the minister, should announce the Divinity; the dimness all around' tell of human insignif- icance. . . . I had to call to mind the heavenly spheres . .. and to show tl-he infinite distance parting man from God, which human imagination in vain attempts to penetrate.335 In designing the Church, Ledoux was still dependent on his teacher and on tradition as well. Yet when he designed buildings to glorify the humanitarian ideals of his time, he abandoned almost completely the forms of 333Cf. pt. I, n. 308. Prieur 2: pl. 115.

In his city two buildings above all others are destined to serve the new ideals: the Panareteon dedicated to the new ethics; and the Pacifere representing the new rights. In his en- thusiasm Ledoux speaks out loudly: "I have erected a temple to Happiness. In my blind enthusiasm I have piled stone upon stone, wishing to create a monument worthy of the great idea which has carried me away." 336 The Pacifere, or Conciliateur,337 is a mighty cube ris- ing on a sturdy podium 338 (fig. 151). The Panareteon, with equally unbroken surfaces, is a terraced building 339 (fig. 152). The simplicity and straightforwardness of both do not call for explanation or justification in the twentieth century. Ledoux, however, felt he had to justify the novel form with its symbolic meaning. To him, the cube of the Pacifere is the symbol of justice; 340 the cube of the Panareteon, the visualization of stead- fastness.34' Even more significant is his remark that the building which he has conceived is as simple as the law for which it stands.342 To make his cubes more palatable to his critics, he refers to the Greek who called an honest man a "square one." 343 Paving the path to the future, he appeals to the past for support. He does make some concessions to contemporary taste by adding statues of the Virtues and Graces to the austere walls of de la majeste supreme, que la teinte mysterieuse qui l'enveloppe representat le neant des nations . . . il falloit elever les degres qui rappellent les hauts cieux, les hautes montagnes, et mettre entre l'homme et la divinite cette distance incommensurable que l'imagination parcourt et ne peut atteindre." 336 L., 113, "J'elevois un temple au bonheur.

These sculptural decora- tions are set against the walls, not blended into them in the Baroque way. The new manner of affixing the decoration-the applique' technique-became very pop- ular in the early nineteenth century both in architecture and in furniture. The difference of the materials on small objects added to the effect: brass ornaments were affixed to mahogany or ebony, white reliefs were con- trasted to the bluish fond on Wedgwood's ware. Ledoux eventually resorts to inscriptions to interpret his productions. It is characteristic of the universalism of the period that he borrows his edifying proverbs and moral sentences from the wise sayings of both An- tiquity,345 and the Orient.346 Tripods on the podium of the Pacifere emit incense clouds, to create atmosphere. Again we see Romanticism vying with the modern forms. Architecture, Ledoux says, should have emo- tional qualities in order to equal poetry: Si les artistes vouloient suivre le systeme symbolique qui caracterise chaque production, ils acqu'6reroient autant de gloire que les poetes; . . . il n'y auroit pas une pierre qui, dans leurs ouvrages, ne parlat aux yeux des passants. On pourroit vraiment dire de I'Architecture ce que Boileau dit de la poesie: chez elle tout prend un corps, une ame, un esprit, un visage.347 Ledoux thinks of the Pacifere as a court of arbitration. Its main purpose is not to punish, but to reconcile, to re- establish peace among the members of a family, or, better still, to prevent dissension.348 (The men in the foreground of the engraving appear to disagree with the modern concepts of justice.

The Panareteon is a school where the virtues are taught and man's duties discussed.349 The massive walls of Pacifere and Panareteon do not even allow a guess at the disposition of the interior. The ideal of geometry has got the better of the Baroque principle of animation; restraint has superseded outward show. The exterior of the Baroque chateau clearly ex- presses the differentiation between the lordly grand salon, the private apartments, and the mezzanine of the servants. The blocks of the revolution are mute. As soon as the architects will renounce the petty devices of "Narrative" architecture, the purposes of their struc- tures will no longer be reflected in the outside. Costume and manners also developed a new reticence; after 1800 dress became more and more uniform; profession or trade would no longer be displayed by attire. People of the Baroque, and the Romanticists, too, liked to exhibit their feelings openly and often excessively, but mankind since has become increasingly reserved. Ledoux himself urges the new attitude in his text: "Let us not reveal our sentiments in public, let us keep them in the secrecy of our hearts." 350 These words are contained in Ledoux' comment on the project of the House for Four Families. FIG. 154. Hospice. But the new feeling for restraint is clearly enough ex- pressed in Pacifere and Panareteon,351 and their synm- bolism, indeed, is only a justification of the modern form. The Pacifere and the Panareteon are crowned with cylindrical belvederes. The problem how to combine cylinders with prismatic masses occupied Ledoux in- tensively, as we know from the barrieres and the Palace of the Governor of Aix, and appears once more in the Parsonage and the Public Baths. In these last, the architect resorts to the pattern of interpenetration. Again one may trace these two designs back to some classical models, again the main interest lies in the original new solutions. The Parsonage, illustrated in the View of Chaux, to the right, (fig. 140), is a rotunda inserted into a square substructure.352 The Public Baths are surrounded by a low square wall, like the Church 349L., 184, "ecole de morale oiu l'on enseigne les devoirs de l'homme." 350 L., 99, "On n'est pas tenu d'exposer au grand jour, dans la place publique, le sentiment qui nous domine.

The discussion of the Baths gives Ledoux the opportunity to set forth some of the ideas that have guided him. He accounts for the unpierced walls by referring to that privacy which is particularly required in a building for the sick. We take from his words that he must have been vehemently criticized for his predilection for unbroken surfaces.355 But with no uncertainty he reaffirms his credo: la decoration d'un edifice doit emaner de l'inspiration du sujet, 1'effet depend du choix des masses pyramidales, des plans, des contrastes qui produisent des ombres, . . . il faut elaguer les croisees cofiteuses et oisives, les corniches sans motifs, les accessoires de mode . . . tout ce qui n'est pas indispensable, fatigue les yeux, nuit a la pensee et n'ajoute rien 'a l'ensemble.355 It is obvious that in this passage he does not give a hard and fast rule by which he worked and expected others to work. But to us these words reveal, unmistakably, the double impact of Romanticism and Functionalism on his thought.356 FIG. 155. Union house-Maison d'union. At a great distance from the city, in a stretch of v.-oocs, the Hospice was to be located 357 (fig. 154). It would shelter the worthy traveler, and contribute to the improvement of mankind by separating the sheep from the goats. Not every one would be allowed to continue on his journey; whoever aroused suspicion would be put on trial and, if found guilty, be condemned to forced labor.358 The Hospice is a two-storied stepped house 353L., pls. 80-82.

Luilt around a square court; the central portion of each front opens in arcades. Although Ledoux declares that lhe was inspired in this design by the caravansaries and in the general layout has included a pagoda and a bazaar, the Hospice seems to show no Oriental characteristics. In no way should we derive the cubic inventions of Ledoux from Oriental models. Instead of looking around for fortuitous analogies, let us attempt to grasp the formal ideals of the architect. Even when he used some model, he had a definite reason for choosing it to accord with his artistic goal. What is important is not where his work comes from, but where it leads. Con- trary to general opinion, the late eighteenth century in the arts cannot be considered altogether as the last stage of a great tradition. Its true significance, in fact, is that it was a most significant beginning. This is how Ledoux himself understood his era and sensed the great awaken- ing in his time: "Deja I'aurore s'empare du monde; ... les arts se reveillent; un nouveau jour commence." 359 The ideal of comradeship has found a home in Union House (Maison d'Union)360 (fig. 155). It would have been a shrine of Rousseauism, a meeting or club house.36' Separate rooms are assigned to each profession. Archi- tecturally, it is a four-storied block, rising on a podium, topped with a cylindrical crowning. The disposition of the fa?ades is remarkable: here, once more, is that ten- sion which results from the peculiar distancing of the rows of openings.

AMER. PHIL. SOC. . .......... FIG. 157. Oikema. The plan of the Educational Building (Maison d'Edu- cation) is the Greek cross within a square 362 (fig. 156). The latter is expressed only on the ground floor (the concept of the Church and the Public Baths!), while the upper stories are formed by intersecting bodies (motif of interpenetration). The center is occupied by the chapel running up through the three stories, and topped by a monopteral belvedere. This belvedere is distin- guished from Baroque domes by its shape, its incon- spicuousness, and the lack of formal affinity to the struc- ture. In the nineteenth century cupolas were similarly placed on prismatic blocks, and could be removed with- out any harm to the whole. Often even an aesthetic im- provement might result from such an amputation. The Oikema, the House of Passion, or, one might say, the Temple of Immorality, is to contribute to the im- provement of youth by a curious method (fig. 157). Confronted with vice (in the "Atelier de corruption"), youth, in its innate goodness, will be revolted by the ugliness of vice and turn to the path of virtue which in the end will lead to the "altar of Hymen." 363 The Oikema is very advanced in its architectural form.364 The prostyles are about all that is left of Hellenic archi- tecture in the design. Elongated nude walls and hori- zontal lines dominate, low semi-cylindrical blocks are attached to each side. To mitigate the severity of the composition, Ledoux applies natural decoration. He 362 L., pIs. 105-108.

The exterior should not give away the interior: "ces murs tranquilles cachent les agitations du dedans."366 As always, the practical considerations are not the motive of the archi- tectural form. The architect could have added statues or any sort of decoration, had he not been fond of the bare walls which are enhanced by the contrasted columns of the porches and the arcades of the basement. The in- terior is divided into halls, galleries, a salon and a number of cubicles. The educational experiment which Ledoux had in mind is as daring as the architectural form which he has devised. The modern architect, Ledoux finds, should design recreational buildings to promote a healthier and more pleasant life. He wants gardens to be added to the houses of the workers,367 and expects the community to provide a Gymnasium (Portiques) 368 (fig. 160) Its halls should afford a place for exercise and play, and for mental relaxation as well.369 With his hygienic sug- gestions, and with the novel form of this design, Ledoux 365 L., 200, "le vallon est entoure de prestiges seducteurs; un vent doux caresse I'atmosphere; les varietes odoriferantes de la foret, le thym, l'iris, la violette . . . soufflent leurs parfums sur ces murs; le feuillage qui les abrite repand le frais et s'agite en murmures.

We see it in a more outspoken form on the Casino (Maison de jeux),372 destined for ball playing, dancing, and chess. (Card games are for- bidden for the sake of morals 373 (fig. 189).) From the city of the living, we must now turn to the city of the dead. Apart from the four Cemeteries adjoining the Church of Chaux, Ledoux planned another large necropolis (fig. 158). In it subterranean galleries after the model of the Roman catacombs lead in three stories to a spherical hall with a diameter of about eighty yards. Its lower half opens into the galleries in alternating large Pal- ladian motifs and small arched windows. The vaulting of the upper half contains no apertures, nor any kind of decoration which might disturb the calm surfaces. Only in the zenith is there a skylight, so that even oni the brightest day dimness reigns under the silent dome. The hall is not intended for funeral ceremonies, it has 370 L., 102. 371 L., 102, "Que d'effets les Architectes pourroient tirer de ces arcs multiplies qui offrent a la combinaison, des contrastes, des oppositions." 372 L., pl. 112.

The upper half of the gigantic globe towers high and lonely over the plain, an austere symbol of infinity. Around the edifice there is nothing but a wide empty space. No tree, no lawn, no lively stream relieves the gloom. Whoever approaches it shall face an image of nothingness, a vision of the void-"l'image du ne'ant.o 7 We know from Boulle'es work that the pure sphere appeared particularly dignified to the revolutionary architects, for structures connected with death and etern- ity.

Its cap- tion "View of the cemetery" probably means the place where the souls find rest, the cemetery of the spirit beyond the cemetery of the body.379 In the designs of his places of worship, and his other community buildings, Ledoux emerges as a true repre- sentative of the era of the Revolution, as a reformer and a visionary.

Writer's house-Maison d'un homme de lettres. those illustrated in L'Architecture. Though they were most certainly conceived within a short time, all the varieties of eighteenth-century development appear in them. Ledoux was not the "creator" of any of the different trends, but he was affected by them and capable of expressing the new revolutionary ideas in the most positive way. The work he left behind him is an epitome of the architectural history of his period, of its aims and its doubts. The Baroque tradition was alive in many of his executed buildings, but only meager vestiges remain in the projects for the Ideal City.

Hunting lodge-Retour de chasse. with the typical sequence of salon and vestibule on the main axis. Nothing is left of the differentiation of the stories, nor of that "organization" which consisted in mimicking organic shapes, such as "wings," or "arms." The House of the Treasurer (Caissier),382 which would have been one of the most sumptuous residences of the city, shows in its exterior that the concept of the ruling center has not been quite forsaken, although the plan intentionally deviates from the schemes of the past (fig. 162). It is a square with a four-columned porch in front, and an elliptically-columned vestibule supporting a terrace, in the rear. The through-going main axis no longer coincides with the axis of the staterooms. Con- sequently, the old equilibrium of the plan is lost. We still find some classical decorations such as the heavy cornice, the statuary on the terrace, and the colossal pilasters on the side-fronts. But the elliptical vestibule, partly projecting from the house and partly intruding into it, is an instance of that interpenetration which was to become a favored pattern of the rising new architec- ture. There is still a remainder of the gracefulness of the Louis XV style and yet there is in it much of the harshness of geometrical architecture. At first glance, the Hunting Lodge (Retour de chasse), planned for the Prince de Baufremont, and dated 1778 in the engraving,383 seems to be Baroque in its general layout (fig. 165). But on closer view we note significant changes. The composition lacks in bind- ing power. Although the building masses seem to be grouped in a manner very similar to Baroque disposi- 382 L., pls. 85, 86. 383L., 212; pls. 110, 111. tion, and, although the main house rules over the out- lying buildings, each block is independent from the other, and from its natural setting. Each is a solid entity, with straight and rigid edges. None makes an attempt to come into contact with its neighbor. Now, the elements make no effort even to acknowledge each other. The reliefs, composed of trophies, are flat, and the roofs of the four-corner towers also are flat.384 The Venetian doors are inconspicuous whereas the window bands on the upper stories play a marked role. Old and new features mingle in the complex, the latter having obviously got the better of the former. The buildings of the Saltworks show Classicism and Romanticism interfering with the new compositional ideal. The portico of the House of the Director,385 has almost entirely lost its traditional character, for the shafts of the columns disappear behind the square drums ringing them (fig. 166). Likewise, the Venetian win- dows of the upper story are ineffective in the rustica- tion. Compositionally, the Director's House is thor- oughly modern. The upper story is superposed on the lower, one block on top of the other.386 Ledoux con- trasts the masses in shape and size. From this very arrangement he expects greatest impressiveness. 387 The 384L., 214, "on n'y voyoit pas ces applications illusoires . . . fragiles, desapprouvees par l'immensite de l'air qui devore tout ce que la proportion neglige." 385L., pl. 60.

To this there can be no better answer than that which the architect himself provides. He remarks that there had been rusticated orders long before him, but for these there were quite different underlying reasons.390 He is fully aware of being an innovator and anticipates that his modifications of the traditional forms will be attacked as "abuses"; 391 he 388 L., 134, "Les assises carrees et rondes des colonnes . . . produisent des ombres tranchantes, des effets piquants; ces combinaisons de P'art changent les contrastes a mesure que le soleil s'etend dans sa course methodique." 135, "Les saillies produisent des ombres piquantes; c'est un moyen de substituer des forces a la foiblesse produite par 1'eloignement." 389 L., 205, "I'Architecte entoure son edifice de pales fant6mes; la flame d'un volcan s'elve, eclaire les masses et fait oublier les details . . . quelle magie! que de merveilles!" 390 L., 136, "Inigo Jones, et d'autres Architectes qui ont employe de petits ordres 'a bossages, sans pourtant avoir les memes motifs." 391 L., 135, "J'entends le professeur, circonscrit dans les cinq ordres, crier apres I'abus....

In these the central portion is emphasized and lower wings are loosely added. But the chief goal is to impress with the heavy rustication, the deep entrance niche running up through both stories, and as Ledoux points out, the chiaroscuro effects.397 The House for the Overseers (Commis employes a la sur- veillance) is of similar shape, but stands free 398 (fig. 173). The House of a Councilor of Besan?on presents a portico of three arches running up to the height of the second story.399 The effect of this portico is like that of the niche in the houses of the workmen (fig. 163). Ledoux advises those who are not inventive enough to create something new, to keep strictly to the cubic forms, instead of imitating the past.400 We have seen him making ample use of prisms and other elementary forms. The House of the Lumbermen (Atelier des bicherons, gardes de la foret) is a pyramid composed 396 L., pl. 39. L.R., p1. 137.

The architect knew h-ow to harmonize this traditional motif with the pyramid; the roofs atop the entrances, and single windows above serve as mediators between the discrepant elements. The second House of the Lumbermen is a cube with low gables and arcades (fig. 170).

Anxious to free himself from the conventional forms -"le cercle etroit des conventions" 404 -he invents the cylindrical House of the Broker (Agent de change) 405 (fig. 174). This house shows that the architect was not swayed by emotions as he was when creating the Coopery and the Shelter of the Rural Guards, but care- fully searching once more for some new mode of com- position. The massive cylindrical body is contrasted with the sturdy prismatic podium, and is echoed in the flatroofed belvedere. From the latter, small superstruc- tures depart in opposite directions. The house is full of antagonisms, each element-podium, body, belvedere, superstructures-strives to assert itself. Different sizes and different shapes battle against each other. The same happens on the surface with its rectangles, arches, and Venetian windows. The ground plan, too, is the invention of one eager to find some novel pattern. "L'uniformite des plans et des elevations est ennuy- 404L., 110. 405 L., pl. 37. FIG. 173. House of the overseers-Maison des commis employes a la surveillance. euse." 406 The salon and the dining room are arranged on the main axis, but separated by a narrow corridor. Within the geometrical pattern, each room is as self- contained as is the entire structure. In most of the houses discussed so far, we observed Ledoux' determination to break away from tradition and to find new formal solutions. The House of the Broker in particular, exemplifies his keeness to apply new patterns, in the second and third dimensions. We now come to deal with designs in which he attacked, separately, the problem of surface composition, or the problem of spatial arrangement. The first instance is what I propose to call the House of 1773 which, according to Ledoux, was one of the 150 projects approved in that year 407 (fig. 172). The modernity of some of its features-modernity in the sense of the twentieth century !-with the fact of its exact date, make it a landmark in architectural history. The bare wall and the frameless openings alone would not justify my terming it modern, were it not that the cntire composition is so advanced. The entrance group FIG. 174. Broker's house-Maison destine a un agent de change. of a square-headed door flanked by rectangular windows -a degenerate descendant of the Palladian motif !-is challenged by the competition of two distant, rather small side-windows. 'In the center of the upper floor, an enlarged Palladian motif appears, with two compart- ments on each side of the central arch. Obviously the point of departure of the whole facade is the Baroque idea of centralization. But the conventional balance of the stories is completely abandoned. The enlarged Pal- ladian motif above has greater weight than the rudi- mental motif below. To mitigate this inconsistency of the heavier over the lighter, the architect has sacrificed the supremacy of the lower central group by adding the lateral windows. Yet the latter are, for obviously prac- tical reasons, too small to compensate fully for the big motif above. They are therefore put at a considerable distance from the entrance and thus work like a light load at the end of a lever. In other words, weight is compensated by distance. The pattern of compensation is rare in Revolutionary architecture, but became ex- 406 L., 110. 407L., 196, 234; pl. 123.</page><page sequence="100">VOL. 42, PT. 3, 1952] CLAUDE-NICHOLAS LEDOUX 529 tremely popular in our century in building, painting, and the minor arts. It is a pattern thoroughly alien to the hierarchical scheme of the Baroque. Still another effect in the fa?ade is reverberation. The ruling en- larged Venetian window is echoed by the entrance group; and the rectangular apertures of the center find a remote, very feeble resonance in the lateral windows. There is, of course, some interplay between the patterns of compensation and reverberation. One may make the distinction between them clearer by putting the differ- ence this way: Compensation is a pattern of different sizes; reverberation is (chiefly) a pattern of similar shapes. It is noteworthy that Ledoux conceived this little house at about the time he built the Baroque Palais Montmorency. It makes a great difference whether an architect works on a commission or is free to follow out his problems in his own way. A variant of the pattern of compensation appears on the House of the Engineer (mecanicien) 408 (fig. 175). Three large, slightly framed rectangular openings below are contrasted with a row of tiny arched windows on the second story and the huge Venetian door of the base- FIG. 175.

The Casino, already briefly dealt with earlier, presents another instance of disturbed balance (fig. 189). Its front is built up in three tiers, the broadest of which is in the middle.410 Very characteristic also is a design which I should like to name the Country House with the Novel FaIade 411 (fig. 178). Here the main accent is on the top floor. This was a bold innovation in the eigh- teenth century, but it has become a common feature in ours. The Memorial (Temple de memoire) 412 is dedicated to the glorification of womankind: "Ledoux, an pied de ces autels, vous rend grace par ces inscriptions solem- nelles; en pensant ' vous il fut heureux" 413 (fig. 195). The mother from whom life springs appears to Ledoux to deserve monuments, not the bloodstained conqueror.414 408 L., pl. 20. 409 L., pl. 108. 410 Cf. above, p. 523. 411 L., pl. 98. 412 L., pl. 75. 413 L., 161. 414L., 159. FIG. 176. House with the Palladian row-Maison d'un employe. The house is a cube flanked by four columns with reliefs, reminiscent of the column of Trajan. More interesting than the spatial composition of contrasted shapes is the surface arrangement. Rectangular and arched apertures alternate, combining in Pallaclian miotifs or variants of it. In writing of this monument Ledoux is acrid in his sarcasm directed against the copyists: On va chercher bien loin, chez les Perses, les Assyriens, le style que l'on fait revivre au bout de vingt siecles. Puisez dans les puissances de I'ame, c'est le seul moyen d'etre independant des prejuge's classiques; elles vous serviront mieux que la vieille tradition.415 The House with the Barrel Roof, destined for an employee, presents a "maimed" Palladian motif (the celitral arch has the full size of a door, while the side compartments are only small windows), as the only feature on the bare front 416 (fig. 180). The arch echoes the semi-circular outline of the roof; the narrow side compartments echo the rectangular door of the base- ment. The stairs and the side roofs form a pattern of reduplicated slanting lines. Such compositional use of the stairs occurs in many of Ledoux' designs, as for in- stance, in the Broker's House, the House of the Lumber- men, the terrace of the Hunting Lodge, and the Educa- tional Building.

The trans- formations of the Palladian motif, too, have deep signif- icance. Originally this motif meant the supremacy of the central portion, anl the integration of all its parts; it was a true symbol of Baroque order. Ledoux again and again deprived the motif of this meaning by various modifications. After the "maimed" Palladian motif we find another l-ouse of an employee, the House with the T-Pattern-what might be called the "degenerated," or even "decapitated" Palladian motif 420 (fig. 179).

Both houses have unframed windows and flat roofs. Ledoux' comments help to clarify what he intended when designing the two houses: He aimed for serenity and grandeur, believing architecture without ornamenta- tion to be the architecture of the future: . . . il n'est pas necessaire que l'ordonnance exterieure ait constamment le caractere architectural que la severitle des ordres exige . . . de grands repos grandissent la pensee et consolident la construction . . . pourquoi . . . des orne- ments somptueux qui . . . n'ajoutent rien a la purete des lignes.

Under this double compulsion he de- FIG. 191. House with the cylindric crowning- Maison de campagne. signed three other houses of similar composition full of excitement and drama. One of these designs is the House of Four Belvederes; the four roof turrets are oversized and their walls are pierced by huge Palladian motifs 432 (fig. 196). The projecting roof above the main floor adds to the unrest and is another example of unbalance. The second house may be named the House with the Cylindrical Crowning, since a cylinder is wedged between the belvederes, a bold intruder tearing apart the unity of the whole 433 (fig. 191). Finally, the Farm (Cour de Service) 434 shows the belvederes grown into corner turrets (fig. 192). This house is full of antagonisms, with its contrasting masses, contrasting 431 L., 147, 99, 149. 432L., pI. 55. 433 L., pl., 24. 434 L., pI. 65.</page><page sequence="104">VOL. 42, PT. 3, 19521 CLAUDE-NICHOLAS LEDOUX 533 directions, and contrasting surface arrangement. Here are the foreshadowings of modern cubism and modern purism mingled with revolutionary unrest. The rigid elementary forms could be made expressive and more appealing by several different methods. The simplest method, embellishment by decoration, was not in harmony with the steadily increasing functional feel- ing. Another method, extraordinary dimensions, suited the Romantic sentiment, but was impractical. Ledoux abhorred the first, and understood that the second was suitable only in monumental architecture. Not willing to confine himself to this restricted field, he had to find the way to enliven normally dimensioned residences. Juxtaposition in twin houses was the first pattern he tried. Then he proceeded to the pattern of reverbera- tion in the Houses of the Writer and of Four Families. From this refined scheme he turned to the dramatic ac- FIG. 192. Farm hou e-Cour de service. centuations in the Farm and the House with Four Belvederes. This last method is liable to undermine both unity and grandeur, as may be seen in the dispro- portions of the Farm and the House with Four Belve- deres. At last, Ledoux has found a pattern of elemen- tary geometrical forms which grants the rights of the individual parts and is full of dramatic life-the pattern of interpenetration. It is difficult to determine whether Ledoux proceeded in the order I have presented here. If the complex solu- tions were not the latest achievement in his career, they became the most important and successful for the future development in architecture. This much we can assert with some certainty in the twentieth century. The design which I should like to call the House with Roof Terraces 435 consists of a prismatic body with in- serted high loggias on each of the four sides, and a 435 L., pl. 18. FIG. 193. House of the foresters-Logement des gardes de la foret. cylindrical turret emerging from the center (fig. 190). The loggias and the turret look as if wedged into the body, effecting a tremendous spatial tension. Upon the plain nine-partite square-the cool gridiron scheme-the structure rises, filled with the conflict of rivaling ele- ments. In its dramatic quality it surpasses the Country House with the Cylindrical Crowning 436 (fig. 191 ). Many passages scattered throughout the text of L'Architecture explain the intentions of Ledoux when he designed these houses. They conform to the formula ".assez et rien de trop," 437 or to the fuller version of this precept: On aura fait quelque chose pour le succes de l'art, . . . si on agrandit les surfaces, si on offre des effets inattendus, dans les situations les plus communes, si on supprirme les details qui attenuent la pensee, si on a suivi les loix que la soliditle exige.438 Ledoux' final objective is grandeur.439 Practicality, he believes, is best achieved through simplicity.

C.: II ne pardonnait pas les mesquineries, il voulait que les masses fussent toujours grandes et plus imposantes par leur dispositions, que par la recherche abusive des details.443 Of Ledoux' pupils, Louis-Ambroise Dubut appears to have best understood the master's ideas. For this reason, and because his work is the true link between the older revolutionaries and the ninteenth century, I feel I should briefly comment on his achievements.444 Hardly less daring than Ledoux in his boldest ex- periments, Dubut designed the telescoping, cylindrical 441 L., 92, n. 2, "les pilastres carres font la fonction de mur- plain, et cependant off rent dans les interlignes des ombres qui les dessinent." 442 L., 82, 28, "les seuls effets que l'on puisse tirer des corps; des saillies bien combinees, des ombres portees, cet isolement enfin qui offre en tout sens le contraste des masses." 154, "des masses contrastees qui assurent des effets pour les elevations." 443 J.

House of a Scientist, or House 28 (fig. 201). (Here he gives his project a name, or thinks of a definite pur- pose, although as a rule he distinguishes the houses by numbers, concerned apparently only with formal prob- lems.) He was still to some extent heir of the Baroque when he conceived House 3 with a dominating main block and lower side pavilions; yet instead of harmoniz- ing the elements, he bestowed the center with over- whelming power (fig. 202). Thus, this group is an out- standing instance of disturbed balance. The single forms mattered little to the architect when occupied with House 2 (fig. 203). He wanted to find new surface patterns and applied to the body first a Gothicizing, then a Renaissance fa?ade. The plans reveal how anxious he was to overcome the traditional scheme of centraliza- tion and open vistas. Masking the struggle for a new composition with forms borrowed from the past was to become typical of nineteenth-century architecture. Calm juxtaposition characterizes House 24 (fig. 204); in- terpenetration of blocks, House 10, planned on the Greek cross (fig. 205). To people of our time these solutions FIG. 197. House of a merchant of Besanqon-Maison d'un marchand de Besanqon. look rather tame, but compared with Baroque produc- tions they were extremely advanced. This is particu- larly true of the stepped House 41, which represents one of the commonest types of our century, the terrace build- ing (fig. 206). What seems important to me is not the mere fact that there was such a stepped house already about 1800, but that the type originated long before prac- tical regards recommended it. The art of architecture went ahead of city planning, in creating new forms. A further instance of interpenetration of masses is the House of the Foresters (Gardes de la foret) 115 (fig. 193). The House of a Merchant of Besan on,446 with its deep niche, presents volume pervading mass (fig. 197).

The House of the Surveyors of the River (Maison des directeurs de la Loue) consists of a low prismatic block with open stairs on each side, and a superimposed hori- zontal semi-cylinder 451 (fig. 198). Ledoux makes the river pass through the building so that the mightly vault- ing is set astride the rushing waters. The composition may, of course, be interpreted as architecture parlante, as the symbol of human rule over nature. Man's mastery of the flood is visualized so vividly that one might easily suppose some present-day expressionist had devised it for a hydraulic power plant. However, now familiar with the architect's inclination to dramatize form, we understand that the floods are to produce an uproar which stone alone cannot bring about. The house is full of contrasts: the vaulting versus the stepped substructure; the void of the tunnel versus the massive masonry; the rigid edges versus the gushing waters. There is tension between the tiny apertures and the large lower ones. There is reverberation of the double outline FIG. 198.

The open stairs, ascending in opposite directions, enact a drama for themselves. It would prove but little understanding of architecture as an art, to ridicule this design because of its practical defects: the disturbance caused by the rushing water and the inadequacy of the small upper windows. It is among those inventions which have a higher purpose than satisfying the miserable lower necessities of life. We must look at it as a "great picture," 452 and as the reflec- 449L., pl. 15.

It tells of the desire for innovation and for a new order of the elements; of the struggle after form for form's sake, and grandeur for grandeur's sake. It may teach us that architecture can and should be more than the plumber's domain. All of Ledoux' designs are not as great as the Sur- veyor's House. Often the sentimentalism of the period tinges his most serious attempts at a new artistic form. Such sentimentalism found vent in the petty fabrics of the "English Gardens," which made extensive use of logs, rocks, straw, and moss in order to conform with the natural surroufidings. This side line of Romanticism does occasionally crop out, as in his grotto in the Gate- way of Chaux, in the Houses of the Woodcutters and the Lumbermen, and in the House of the Charcoal Burners (Atelier des charbonniers) 151 (fig. 194). Ledoux' reaction to the humanitarian ideals of his day shows in the engraving of the Home of the Poor (L'abri du Pauvre), where the good intention must com- pensate for its poor artistic quality. It represents a naked mnan under a tree, sheltered only by Heaven's goodness.4 Rousseau's Utopianism inspired two large complexes destined to promote happier ways of life: the Tene- mentary forms, as well as those of the creative, independent architect. 453 L., pl. 109. 454 L.. pal. 33.

They would enjoy peace and freedom under patriarchal rule and wor- ship in an enlightened mode, unless some "philosopher" intruded and interfered with their innocent ways. If Rousseau's ideas never were realized in actual life, they have become true in Ledoux' vision.460 Architecturally, 459 L., 180, "Jeunes artistes, ouvrez ce grand livre pour etudier les contrastes, vous eprouverez dans la solitude des sensations qui s'empreindront de teintes sombres; c'est-la que vous medi- terez sur les grands evenements de la vie.

Having given this picture of a Rousseauian idyll, its illusions, and its ill fate brought about by the rationalists, Ledoux wonders where in the world he might find satisfying conditions. Everywhere something is wrong; only in Switzer- land there is liberty. About France he prefers to keep silent. the Cenobie presents projecting and interpenetrating masses: . . . c'est la projection des masses, la saillie du corps qui donnent le caractere decidIe . . .

Ledoux knew of the struggles of his era and he knew about its hopes. He expressed both in his architectural work. In reviewing the manifold productions of Ledoux we become aware that he saw some distinct artistic goal ahead of him, yet did not in the least reach a definite, teachable formula. He tried to approach his ideals with untiring efforts, sometimes inspired by the past, more often foreseeing the future. Boullee, although hardly less affected by the diverging trends of contemporary thought, succeeded in working out a doctrine of strict cubism, tinged with a Romantic hue. It is understand- able that the architect who could present some new archi- tectural "truth" had more students and followers than the searcher, never content with his findings. But to posterity, the work of Ledoux with its overwhelming richness, tells more of the aspirations of his era, than the work of any other architect. 461 L., 183.

LEQUEU'S LIFE Jean-Jacques Lequeu was born at Rouen on Septem- ber 14, 1757.1 His father, Jean-Jacques-Francois seems to have been a cabinet maker or a designer of furniture, with some interest in landscape architecture and in archi- tecture itself. Scattered among the collection of draw- ings by his son in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris are several by the elder Lequeu: a mantelpiece, signed and dated 1745; 2 a sideboard (buffet) with Rococo carving, signed and dated 1750; two portals for the palace of an archbishop, dated 1766; the layout of a garden; 4the elevation of a monumental terrace build- ing (fig. 207) representing, apparently, the temple of FIG. 207. Reconstruction, Fortuna temple of Praeneste. Fortuna at Praeneste,5 and others. The younger Lequeu was to follow the father in his various activities but with this difference, that architecture played the major role in his life, interior decoration the minor.6 As a pupil of the school of design at Rouen, he was awarded prizes in 1776 and 1778.7 The director of the school, the painter Jean-Baptiste Descamps the elder, was favorably im- pressed by Lequeu's ability and wished him to carry on his architectural studies in Paris. Descamps persuaded the artist's uncle, a priest, to grant the young man a two- year pension and Lequeu went to the capital in 1779.8 'According to a letter of application directed by Lequeu to the Minister of the Interior, kept among Lequeu's drawings in the Bibl.

On the day following his arrival he sought to present himself, with several letters of introduction, to Jacques- Germain Soufflot, but the aging architect of the Pantheon was ailing and could receive him only a few days later. Then Soufflot recommended him to the architect, and friend of Boullee, Julien-David Le Roy, the renowned editor of Ruines . . de la Grece, who accepted him as a student of the Royal Academy. Soufflot also permitted him to work in his own studio together with his nephew, Fran?ois Soufflot, who had just arrived from Rome.9 Lequeu never forgot Soufflot's benevolence.10 In his later days he donated a collection of engravings of Souf- 9 B.

A handwritten announcement of his lessons ("Avis aux amateurs") and many painstakingly carried out drawings dated from 1777-1784 inform us about this side of his activities 13 (fig. 208). In 1779, perhaps still before his journey to Paris, he tried his hand at a large architectural project, a town hail for Rouen, which later brought him recogni- tion in his native town 14 (fig. 214). It must have been in the early seventeen-eighties that he made the Italian tour with the Gomte de Bouville. He mentions it in a little note, and several drawings also testify to this journey. One carries the legend "al campidoglio," an- other "Nella villa Medici," and a third, "Candelabre antique a Ste. Agnese." The "Progetto . . . del Grande Padiglione Italianamente" (sic) is dated 1783.15 Back home, in 1786, Lequeu, though living in Paris, was nominated ad joint tassocie of the Academie Royale des Sciences, Belles Lettres et Arts de Rouen.16 In a further note, and also in an application submitted to the Minister of the Interior in 1801,17 Lequeu states that he built the Casino of Madame de Meulenaer in 11 B.

(In a drawing he calls this house "Temple du silence," dating it 1788.20) About this time he was still employed by Soufflot, "dit le Ro- main" (as he describes him to distinguish him from the architect of the Pantheon). When the younger Soufflot carried out the Hotel Montholon on the Boulevard Mont- martre,21 Lequeu was "a draughtsman and inspector" under him, providing also designs for furniture.22 I could not ascertain whether our architect executed the Church of the Capuchin Nuns of Marseille, which 18 B.

In the application of 1801 he lists as further achievements the project for the parochial church of St. Germain-en- Laye and one for a hospital at Bordeaux in 1788. He also states that he was the Chef de l'un des ateliers publics in the faubourg Saint-Antoine in 1790 and 1791 and that he took part in the preparations for the first great revolutionary festival, the Fete de la federation on the Champ-de-Mars, on July 14, 1790. The era of political upheaval brought about an im- portant change in Lequeu's career. He had to give up the free profession of an architect, and became a civil servant, for he had lost all his property,24 and the general situation, of course, was unfavorable to building. He entered the office of the cadastre in the first year of the Republic (1793),25 and remained employed there until the office was discontinued in 1801.26 Yet in the be- ginning of his new career in the year II, his art was to do him a good service in a highly critical moment. He must have aroused suspicion. To prove his genuine republican feelings, he produced an odd drawing titled "Porte du Parisis," 27 and submitted it to the Committee of Public Safety (fig. 251). The latter was pleased with the extravagant composition and the drawing went on exhibition in the Salle de la liberte.28 Later, Lequeu wrote on the back of this life-saving drawing the remark, "Dessin pour me sauver de la guillotine" and the ironical comment, "Tout pour la patrie." In the same year II and the same place he exhibited also the project of the Monument in Honor of Illustrious Men 29 (fig. 238), 23B.

It refers to the victims of the Terror, "Ce temps ou on immolait des victimes humaines a la liberte." The patriotic plan of the year I, "Monument destine 'a l'exercice de la Souverainete du peuple" (fig. 277) may just as well have been inspired by enthusiasm as by fear.31 In the year IX Lequeu entered the com- petition for the erection of commemorative columns in the departements, and in the year XI he took part in an- other held in the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre.32 The change of profession had not changed Lequeu. He retained the unbridled mind he had before. The dated designs of the seventeen-eighties and those of the seventeen-nineties are equally extravagant.

They cannot be dealt with in this context; I am preparing a separate essay on them. Among Lequeu's drawings is a copy of that poster of the year II in which Boullee, Le Roy, Ledoux, and the sculptor Dardel were violently attacked.33 The placard, addressed "Aux citoyens du concours"-the participants in a competition-informs us that the four artists were reg,arded as belonging to a group with reactionary aims, or, as the slanderer would make believe, to a faction. There is no indication that Lequeu was the author of the libel. His interest in it certainly was only due to the fact that it was directed against his former teacher Le Roy. In 1801 Lequeu's application for another position met with success. He was appointed a cartographer in the Department of the Interior. First he worked on maps of Paris, and later in the Bureau of Statistics, on maps of the French Empire. In 1815 he projected a Mausoleum on the Place de la Concorde, in memory of the martyrs who had been beheaded there, including a bust of Louis XVI, and planned to embellish the Chamber of Deputies and the bridge leading to it. Still in the same year he 33B. N., Ha 80. See pt. I, n. 308. FIG. 218. Chinese house-La demeure du jardinier, appell6e Maison chinoise. FIG. 219.

Lequeu never composed a continu- ous text, but added merely brief comments to the draw- ings. These, he asserts in the advertisement, were exhibited in the Louvre, though unfortunately they were not listed in the catalogs. In 1822 and 1824 he was anxiously concerned that not a single word of the textes he had composed for new advertisements should be omitted from print.38 In 1822 he wanted to sell also "eight or nine" plays he had written, one of which was Le faux Defme'trius. It is pathetic to read of his fear that no one would be interested in the works of an unknown artist, and that some prospective buyer might not find where he lived, for his neighbors hardly knew him.39 A note probably written in his last years, is full of com- plaints about "injustices et ingratitudes." In another note he bitterly assails his colleagues, "acteurs d'in- trigues, faiseurs d' architecture Parisienne." 40 The de- sign of his own tomb bears his portrait in relief, with the inscription "J. J. DE QUEUX." This unusual spell- ing, if it is not by another hand, reveals the artist's ab- sent-mindedness; the caption, however, his life-long suf- ferings: Sepulchre de l'auteur, frere de Jesus; il a porte sa croix toute sa vie. One of his latest designs is the 37 B. N., Ha 80.

This is the more curious as he states ini a draft to the announcement of 1822 that he had lived in the same house since 1786. 40 B. N., Ha 80, both. FIG. 228. Dairy-Laiterie. FIG. 229.

Like the previous adver- tisements also that of 1824 had, we may say, fortunately, no success. For then Lequeu decided to donate all his drawings and a copy of the treatise on Chinese building by Chambers to the Royal Library, according to the latter's inventory of 1825.4' In or after this year Lequeu died. Yet even if he lived for several more years, there is no doubt that by 1824 his career as an artist had been long since finished. Those frantic outbursts and the somewhat confused text of an undated note scribbled on a letterhead of the Ministere de l'Interieur with Annce 181 (sic) might confirm one's first reaction to Lequeu's drawings, that he was abnormal from the beginning. Should we leave him to the psychologist and exclude him from art his- tory ? It is not necessary to have recourse to the simple generalization that all artistic creation is beyond the normalcy that makes and marks every-day life. Rather 41 B.

SOC. should we refer to such great figures accepted by art history in spite of their deranged mental condition as El Greco, Borromini, Van Gogh. What counts is not whether abnormality is more or less manifest in their production but whether their presentations have the qualities of any normal work of art. We can find in Lequeu's drawings the same will to master form, the same trend toward abstraction, the same desire to ex- press human feelings, and the same wish to enhance the "normal," or, the banal, as in any less eccentric achieve- ment worthy to be considered art. The question whether he was sane in his early years can be answered by point- ing out some characteristics of the designs. The hand- writing is calligraphic, minute rather than extravagant. The comments are clear, most of them sober and tech- nical. Later, he makes sarcastic remarks which prove sound reasoning. The attitude of his environment is likewise elucidating. Descamps, Soufflot, and Le Roy re- garded him as a gifted student whom they liked to en- courage and to assist. His patrons had similar opinions. Nor would be have been employed for twenty-two years in republican and imperial offices, had he not behaved like a normal person. Almost all of his known works originated before the end of his civil service career and long before the possible outbreak of insanity in his last years. I believe that not a personal condition, but the general unrest of the periodl must account for his production in the first place. Lequeu's dream-architecture marks the end of the period at the beginning of which stand the architectural dreams of Le Geay. Though Lequeu wandered beyond the regular bounds, his fantasies are more than extravaganzas. They are works of art in which we recognize the man, and through which we ap- prehend the period. Building for patrons after classical canons must have been for Lequeu in his early years just as boring as delineating charts and maps in his advanced age. Classicism was the field in which the unoriginal, the minor spirits, felt at home. The independent minds strove to free themselves from the old heritage, in one way or another. They laid down their novel ideas in passionate words, or in ecstatic designs which must be looked upon as expressions of evolution. To measure their inventions by the standards of a perfected, stable style or tradition would be to misjudge their position and significance in the history of art. They are neither to be judged by any aesthetic canons of mature style, nor to be approached with any expectation of practical utility or even possibility. If ever there was such a thing as l'art pour l'art, we find it in the outbursts of the revolutionary architects. Unlike the artists at the end of the nine- teenth century, they were not out to discover some novel FIG. 231.

Boullee, Ledoux, and Lequeu had to speak out because they were swayed by the emotions and the needs of the moment. The transi- tion from a stabilized tradition to diametrically opposed goals brought about an uproar in any field. Contrary to other historians, art historians were not aware of the crisis of the close at the eighteenth century. They reg- istered the works of the Revivalists, but they didi not see the seers. Like the heroic architecture of Boull6e and the reform work of Ledoux, Lequeu's fantasies re- flect the main trends of the pericd, its passion for grandeur, its will to innovation, and its yearning for the unheard-of. The fact that Boulle'e's, Ledoux', and Lequeu's fan- tasies-at least part of them-originated long before the political revolution broke out gives one much to think. Let us remember th-at the dawn of the Renaissance came prior to the Reformation, the symptoms of the Baroque came earlier than the absolute monarchy, and art nou- veau, with all its excitement, preceded the political cata- clysm of the twentieth century. Architecture- the arch- craft-allows men, when they build their sanctuaries or their homes, and, still more when they merely dream of FIG. 236. Look-out of the game keeper- (Poste du) garde-chasse. FIG. 237. Tomb monument-Sepulture pres Voorhout. them, to express their yearnings long before they dare to reform their social institutions. Modern historians hold that some of the leading ideas which were to shape the nineteenth and twentieth centuries originated about 1700.42 They became formative in architecture much earlier than in life. This is what the drawings of the revolutionaries make evident. X. LEQUEU'S WORK In Lequeu's development one can distinguish three phases: As a youth he followed the main currents of the time; the late Baroque as well as the rising fashion of Neo-classicism; and shared the Romantic interest in medieval architecture. In his second phase his strong individuality began to assert itself with great intensity. Less bold than Ledoux, he availed himself almost ex- clusively of forms of the past and did not think of pre- senting undisguised geometrical shapes. But he trans- formed his models in the most daring and most un- orthodox ways, and created designs unparalleledi in architectural history. In his third and last stage, the impetuosity of youth is gone and with it the revolution- ary enthusiasm. We cannot, of course, expect a clear demarcation line between each of these phases, but per- haps can say that he passed from the first stage to the second in the 1780's, and that the last stage began about 42 Cf.

Monument '' la gloire de nombre d'hommes illustres. 1800. In each phase there were high and low tides, moments in which he rose high above the fashions of the day and moments when he lagged behind; moments of ecstasy and moments of despondency. Even in his most fantastic designs he added sober instructions for the stu- dents. When, on the other hand, he wanted to explain some abstract subject, he presented his diagrams in an artistic form. For instance, a sheet for the instruction in light and shade has become, in his hand, a specimen of Romantic art full of vigorous contrastS 43 (fig. 208).

The frieze in high relief consists of a multitude of figures hiding almost completely the wall to which they are applied. Clouds efface the architectural lines of the upper part of the structure. There is much movement and plasticity in the design but there is no trace of the stern classicism which at that time already had become fashionable. The de- sign might make a good model for a decorative piece in porcelain, but, if carried as an outdoor monument, the bulky substructure and the comparatively tiny figure of the goddess would hardly produce a pleasant effect. Not much later the pompous, overdecorated chapel of Sainte-Genevieve in the Emperor's Palace must have originated. Lequeu noted on the back that it was shown to Soufflot and the King (fig. 210). Quite different is the design of a barrie're for Rouen (fig. 211). An inscription on it states that it was sent to Descamps, "Par nous Le Queu architecte et envoyee a M. Descamps." From this self-confident, almost child- ish enunciation, and from the immature character of the drawing itself, we may infer that it was made when Lequeu was a student under Descamps, or even at an earlier moment when he wanted to show his hand to the master. The barriere in the "castellated" style is a prod- FIG. 239. Pompe a feu. FIG. 240. Dairy, interior. FIG. 241.

The porch of the plain house is finished by a curious crenellated pediment, a battle- mented tower rises above the roof. The Small Fort (Fortin) is likewise derived from medieval castles. The plasticity of its rendering points to a later date (fig. 212). In 1779 Lequeu made a design for a Town Hall (fig. 214). He evidently hoped that his project might be ac- cepted to replace the scheme which Antoine Mathurin Le Carpentier, a member of the Paris Academy of Archi- tecture, had worked out for Rouen in 1758.44 According to Lequeu's own statement the Royal Academy of Rouen approved of his design which belongs to the type of cool, impersonal buildings common to the Louis Seize style. The elongated structure consists of a rusticated ground- floor with arched windows and a second story with straight-headed openings. The central Doric portico runs up to the height of the Mansard roof; slightly pro- jecting end-pavilions frame the whole; a dome with a spire terminates the composition. The arrangement is, 44Le Carpentier's project is illustrated in Encyclopedie (see pt. I, n. 31), pl. 22; Patte, Pierre, Monumens eriges en France a la gloire de Louis XV, 180 pl.

Le Carpentier. basically, Baroque, but all Baroque liveliness has gone. There is no movement in the front, and the single ele- ments appear to be frozen. Lequeu's project differs from Le Carpentier's chiefly in two ways. It lacks the latter's rich decoration, especially the columns of the second story; and the central portion is considerably altered. The old-timer Le Carpentier was still intent upon unification. To this end he used the two-story pattern both in the center and on the sides. Lequeu, however, disrupts the continuity of the front by adding the colossal portico. His dome is less conspicuous than that of the former master, who exalted the crowning feature by inserting an attic story between it and the main floor of the building. Though Lequeu's design is based on that of his predecessor it reveals unmistakably a changed attitude toward composition. In the Casino of Terlinden at Sgrawensel, built for a certain dowager Meulenaer in 1786, the main entrance is on the short side of the rectangular plan, like an ancient temple.45 But the porch is followed by the 45Cf. note 18.

The plan is definitely lacking in centralization, or orientation around a dominating element, and this is contrary to truly Baroque plans. A structure that was supposed to imitate a classical temple did not, of course, permit a centralized arrangement. The architect was not free in designing the plan. Yet it is significant that the patron himself followed the new fashion. In the era of the Baroque the formal pattern was imperative and no FIG. 249. Mausoleum of Voltaire. FIG. 250.

Whoever was responsible for the temple-dwelling of Terlinden, its interior indicates that the loose arrange- ment of the rooms was satisfactory at that moment. The interior decoration was strictly Louis Seize, stiff and rather closely following Greek models.

However, it means much that many passages of Blondel could be illustrated with the drawings of Lequeu, and that the latter's strange designs can be explained with Blondel's comments. The two men had more in common than any mere outer con- nection which might have tied the work of the one to the words of the other.

We find in Lequeu's designs the confusion of bor- rowed styles so disapproved by Blondel. There is an Egyptian House, (fig. 216), a Chinese House (fig. 218), a Turkish House (fig. 220), a Little Synagogue (fig. 223), a Persian Porch (fig. 225), a Persian Sanctuary (fig. 227), a Hen House, with Oriental motifs (fig. 229), the Winepress (fig. 221), and the Pigeon-House (fig. 230), mixtures of Oriental and geometric shapes. There are several gothicizing projects, such as the Dairy (fig. 228), and the front of the Temple of Isis (fig. 231). The details of the latter, especially the decoration of the portal, are far more personal than the sober copies of most of the Gothicists. Yet the absurdity of mixing up different styles, indiscriminately, appears in the legend: Portail d'Eglise applique au Temple sup'rieur d'Isis, bati par les Gaulois et conserve par Frangois ler; le quel fit revivre l'Architecture Grecque. The Duke's Chapel was obviously inspired by Venetian Renaissance build- ings (fig. 232). We find in Lequeu's work also the idea that structures destined to stand in free nature should _ If FIG. 259.

Each of these designs might be re- garded as just a playful pastime of the Romantic Mood, but the fact that such different realms simultaneously entered the consciousness of mankind may teach us that there was a great awakening about 1800, uncertain of its goals in the beginning but untiring in the effort to reform architecture. THE SEARCH FOR NEW FORMS We find in Lequeu's projects other excesses which Blondel had condemned. Overabundance of statuary characterizes the Monument in Honor of Illustrious Men, dated an 2 de la Republique (fig. 238); columns transformed into bizarre shapes without any "order" appear in the Entrance of the Infernal Grotto (fig. 213); distorted forms on the Pompe 'a feu 47 (fig. 239); and the Powder Magazine (fig. 241). In the last two de- signs the roof lines are transformed into features of great expressiveness: mute matter here speaks of restive elements. The winding stairs of the Beacon (Colonne cochlide) also have become a fanciful, oversized pattern (fig. 222). Lequeu knew how to raise the ordinary to something extraordinary. His capricious metamorphoses of every-day features are far more stimulating than the 47Kaufmann, Boullee, Art Bulletin 21: 217, fig. 3, 1939. insipid works of the Classicists, and his variations on classical themes in artistic value surpass the most "cor- rect" duplications of the unimaginative copyists. His Arch for the Triumphal Road (fig. 217), the Memorial to Victor Moreau (who died in 1813) (fig. 242), and the Arch in Honor of the Brave (fig. 243), have little in common with the classical precedents. The Memorial to the Citizens Who Died for Their Country is not a pedantic imitation of Egyptian or Greek motifs, but a mixture of both with much of Lequeu's own (fig. 244). Likewise, the Belvedere (fig. 246) and the Rural Retreat (fig. 247), both of 1785, show how freely he handled traditional features and how free he felt to change traditional composition. The desire for innovation also speaks out clearly in the Seigniorial Tribunal (fig. 248). The Mausoleum of Voltaire is a polygonal pavilion ap- proached by curiously shaped arcades (fig. 249). The remarks on the drawing are very specific, as was usual with our architect, though there was no need to add the explanatory words plume and globe terrestre to the neatly delineated symbols on top of the structure. But this was Lequeu: the phantastic, the imaginative artist : FIG. 266. Porte flamande FIG. 267.

Nice inventions are the sun dial and the fountain in a niche on the sheet with the Mausoleum. The Inn of the Enchanted Garden (Guin- guette a 1'entree du petit bois admirable) deviates from FIG. 270.

Most of these designs combine a classical background with unclassical composition. Lequeu took the general layout of Porsenna's Tomb from the description in Pliny's Na- tural History (XXXVI, 19), which he quotes on the margin of his drawing. He was very free in the details. Instead of the five pyramids carrying the metal globe, he presents small cones on truncated pyramids; and in- stead of the pyramids on top of the globe he adds a canopy on slender columns. The main effect of Lequeu's Tomb is derived from the contrast of the giant globe to the other features. Lequeu may have known original Etruscan work. But if we compare his Tomb with bowls on high stands of the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., we notice significant differences.48 The Etruscan 48 Cf.

Island of love-L'ile d'amour. FIG. 276. Holy city-Aqueduc pour conduire l'eau vierge a la Sainte Cite'. products show supple, almost organic shapes with lavish sculptural decoration in harmony with them. Lequeu, however, builds up his Tomb of rather geometric forms. Even if we were to find Etruscan objects more like his design than the ordinary bowls on high stands, we should not be satisfied that we had discovered his true model. We would still have to ask why the architect copied these particular objects and not the "organic" type. His aim now was to create an agglomerate of inorganic shapes rather than a compact plastic body such as his early Monument to Athena. The composition of the Tomb is typical of the new time, as is the fantastic ele- ment in it, although it differs widely from the usual Romantic productions. A further very curious invention is the Entrance to the Deer Forest, decorated with plastic heads of a stag, boars, and hounds (fig. 258). Again early Etruscan ob- jects appear to have been Lequeu's inspiration. In this extravagant composition he is a classicist turning to a primitive stage of ancient art. "Narrative" architecture is carried far in the Cowshed in the form of a cow with a jug on her head and in that antler-shaped gate. The new compositional principle of independence of the elements appears in the imposing Castle on the Sea (fig. 259). This consists of a low cylindrical substruc- ture, a tall cylindrical house, and a polygonal super- structure forming the base of a square spire. It is a "castellated" building free of pettiness.- Here we face Romanticism in austere grandeur. This work of archi- tecture is the perfect counterpart of the restless waves. From the point of view of its artistic meaning, the compositional principle of the Tomb of Porsenna and the Castle on the Sea appears again in the apparently totally different Church of the Capuchin Nuns of Marseille of 1788 (fig. 260). This is also an agglomerate of ele- mentary geometrical forms; a spherical dome, a hemi- cylindrical portico, and flanking prisms, with a halo-like crowning arch. IN THE STYLE OF THE STAGE Many of Lequeu's designs might very well serve as theatrical decorations of that higher type which aims at mood and expressiveness rather than at realistic repre- sentation. The Temple of Ceres is unobtrusive "Narra- tive" architecture, the delicate work of a skillfull dec- orator (fig. 261). The Temple to the Unknown God is a cave carved out of rock and framed by a rusticated arch in which a pedimented Ionic portico has found place. In the dim interior of the cave we discern a globe topped by a flickering flame49 (fig. 245). The Nymphee is a vaulted, niche-like structure built around a fountain, in the midst of the woods (fig. 263). The Temple of Terpsichore is flanked by platforms on which 49 Kaufmann, Art Bulletin 21: 225; fig. 17. FIG. 277.

Pagode Indienne. dancers perform (fig. 226). The drawing with the En- trance to the Abode of Pluto, conceived in delicate colors, and with dramatic lighting, is in its plainness and monu- mentality a precursor of scenic decoration of our time, and is of superior artistic quality 50 (fig. 264). The Porte Flamande, dated an 1, serving as the entrance to a garden, belongs, with its severe design, to the noblest inventions by Lequeu (fig. 266). The Interior of the Dairy is transformed into a pattern composed by the jugs and the posts carrying the roof (fig. 240). Lequeu attempted later to symbolize his era in several designs which, as all productions prompted by non- artistic motives, were quite poor. In the Symbolic Order (Ordre symbolique de la Salle des Etats d'un Palais National), dated 1789, the entablature is: carried by enchained enemies of the people "seigneurs aris- tocrates et leurs complices subalternes" (fig. 268). The Temple of Wisdom (Temple de la sagesse), too, is rather bad literature, than fine arts (fig. 265). The Monument of Deserving Citizens, planned for the Place de I'Arsenal, unhappily combines classical fea- tures and revolutionary symbols (fig. 269). These two designs are architecture parlante at its lowest. The Obelisk for the estate of the Citoyen Prouy, conceived by the "Citoyen Le Queu" is somewhat better, for the symbolism here is less obtrusive and the will to artistic form more conspicuous (fig. 270). 50Ibid., 225; fig. 16. STRUGGLE FOR GRANDEUR Setting aside eccentricities, theatrical fantasies, and weak symbolisms, Lequeu created many designs of re- fined simplicity and striking grandeur. The Temple de l'Egalite is composed of a globe emerging from a circular portico (fig. 271). In the interior a small globe topped by a statue stands near the base of the larger one. Its tiny mass is effectively contrasted to the immense void. This design was devised in the year II of the Revolution to glorify a revolutionary ideal. It is; a veritable prod- uct of the stormy time, not confused or bizarre, but simple and grand. The equally dignified Temple de la Terre is similar in shape and artistic qualities 51 (fig. 272). It bears above its entrance the legend A la Sagesse Supreme. Two notes on the verso manifest how tenaciously Lequeu strove for success and how easily he changed' his political views. When he exhibited it in the year II, he saw in it a means "pour retablir . .. l'eternelle egalite." Much later he offered the design to the Minister of the Interior as a Chapel of St. Louis in the Pere Lachaise cemetery, "parce qu'il est veritable- ment inutile aux Francais enemis de l'egalite, et qui ne s'accommoderont jamais avec leurs semblables."

The elementary forms have in themselves the quality of grandeur which agreed so well with the intentions of the revolutionary architects. Often the artists present the impressive basic forms with a minimum of decora- tion. The pure, primitive shapes suffice to sublimate both "great" structures like the Castle on the Sea and humble utilitarian buildings like the Ice House (fig. 262). The monumentality of all these designs may well have been derived from the same sense for greatness which inspired many of the leaders of the French Revolu- tion. The architects, too, wished to build in a new and grand manner. The Tribune of the Revolutionary Orators (Tribune des harangues), dated an 1, is great and plain with reticently applied classical features (fig. 267). The contrast of the boldly advancing tribune and the curved wall behind it is grand. On the margin we read the revolutionary curse, to be engraved on the wall of the canopy in the center: "Perisse maudit de Dieu avec sa race, celui qui agira, parlera ou pensera contre la republique." I do not know whether these strong words were originally those of the then revolutionary architect, or whether he just found them suitable. Grandeur and fantastic beauty mark several large projects. One of these architectural dreams is called Palais champetre (fig. 274). Trees and trellis clad with foliage mitigate the sternness of the stonework, similar to Boullee's thought to plant trees on the Cenotaph of Newton.53 A pile of primordial scale is the Tomb Monument near Voorhout (Sepulture des plus Illustres et des plus Savants Hommes pres Voorhout) (fig. 52 Ibid., 221; fig. 11. 53 Ibid., 212; fig. 1. 54 Ibid., 226; fig. 20. 237). This is built up by receding cylinders and a mas- sive conical dome topped by a temple. Tall flanking obelisks and cypresses planted on the terraces add dramatic accents. According to a note on the back of this drawing, Lequeu submitted it to the President des Etats Generaux . . . des Pays-Bas in 1785. The Island of Love is another great dream of the architect-poet (fig. 275). Stepped terraces crowned by a temple are flanked by lower houses. In the extra- ordinary variety of architectural features and in the marginal description of the fountains and the flowers, the birds and the beasts of the park, we recognize Lequeu's exuberant fantasy which distinguishes him from the austerity and the restraint of Boullee and Ledoux. Somewhat morbid and perhaps even somewhat infantile, he appears in this house from fairy-land almost like one of the common-run Romanticists. Yet we must give him credit for his great inventiveness and his comparative in- dependence from his models. The whole is strictly sym- metrical, whereas asymmetry is stressed in two other designs. The one is the aqueduct with the Sainte Cite in the background 55 (fig. 276) ; its tower to the left has no counterpart to the right. The other is the Rendez- vous de Bellevue (fig. 2,35), the most extraordinary of Lequeu's inventions. The deep unrest of the period which so ardently strove to overcome the old and to at- tain the new becomes manifest in this fantasia. It is 55Ibid., 225; fig. 15. Placed at the beginning of the road to the Holy City, the tower seems to the onlooker to be counter- balanced merely by the distant hills. FIG. 282.

Pavillon Romain. hardly inferior in artistic quality to the Castle on the Sea, but unlike the latter, it is asymmetrical. Thus a further characteristic of the conventional art has been given up, and now contrasts both in size and shape mean more than balance. The simultaneous appearance of forms of diversified origin is also a significant symptom. A Greek temple on top of an attached tower, a donjon carrying an observatory, a Venetian window, a gothiciz- ing door, and plain frameless windows appear side by side. A mixture of incoherent and incongruous fea- tures, the Rendez-votis tells much of the period which struggled for innovation, and again and again turned to the past, haunted by weird dreams. WHEN THE TEMPEST STILLS Lequeu's post-revolutionary phase reveals that there was a road from fantastic inventions to a more realistic but nonetheless, artistic architecture. The circular monument to the Sovereignty of the People, dated an I de la Republique presents all the beauty of elementary shapes (fig. 277). The Indian Pagoda is one of Le- queu's most advanced compositions (fig. 278). Al though it seems to be just one of the Romantic excur- sions into far-away countries, it already foreshadows the stepped houses of the remote future. On the way to this future stand two late designs: The Soldiers' Memorial (fig. 279), bearing the name of Louis XVIII, and the Funeral Monument (fig. 280). In these designs the architect once more availed himself of various features of the past. Although they are still somewhat restless, they have much of that severity which architecture in our own time was to reach after long and strenuous ef- forts. The concept of unrelated blocks appears also in the Terrace on the River (fig. 219) and the Temple of Virtue (fig. 281). The Casino (fig. 282) is a terrace building with roof gardens, which, in its rigidity, is a far cry from the plasticity of the Athena Monument, one of his earliest inventions. The Ecclesiastical Prison is of utmost sobriety (fig. 283). The date MCCCC on the roof should certaintly read MDCCC. There is less ten- sion here and less vigor than in Ledoux' Prison of Aix. Architecture is beginning to calm down. The strong portal with the oversized keystones calls to mind similar forms on Ledoux' barrieres. The Roman Pavilion is an instance of the return to the Renaissance which became characteristic of the nineteenth century (fig. 284). This is not a slavish copy, for it has a personal touch. From the ultimate stage of the Baroque with its marked exaggeration of forms and its affections; from classicism and exoticism, Lequeu passed to the preter- natural. Anticipating the twentieth century, Boullee and Ledoux restored the elementary forms to their right- ful place in architecture. Moreover, Ledoux showed his progressiveness in his attempts to find a new order of the elements. Lequeu was destined to introduce into building the emotional and the irrational in a higher de- gree than the two older artists. His weird fantasies re- veal much of his era to one who is interested in the de- velopment of artistic ideas rather than in practical improvement. Though Lequeu, like all Romanticists, looked back to remote times and remote regions, he was nonetheless a forerunner of a significant current in the early twentieth century. Here and there similar unrest and similar incertitude inspired strange performances; here and there expressiveness counted more than formal- ity; then, as now, great and dignified works emerged from the turmoil. It is not my intention to imply any direct connection between 1800 and 1900; I am con- cerned only with the continuity of ideas. Le Geay and Lequeu, who died in the dark, Boullee and Ledoux, who ended in doubt, all were seers of far- away goals. None left examples for easy imitation. But their vision most certainly ushered' in that "new day" which Ledoux so hopefully awaited.56 56 Ledoux, Architecture, 86. Cf. the motto of this book, and the quotations pt. I, note 399, pt.
