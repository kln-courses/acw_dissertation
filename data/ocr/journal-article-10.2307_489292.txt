Fujii. Uni- versity of California Press, 1993. Pp. xvii + 287. $40 (cloth); $14 (paper). READING AGAINST CULTURE: IDEOLOGY AND NARRA- TIVE IN THE JAPANESE NOVEL, by David Pollack. Cornell University Press, 1992. Pp. x + 259. $14.95 (paper). Reviewed by Ann Sherif As readers of modem Japanese literature, we find ourselves faced with a body of canonical texts that appear to emphasize the individual, affect, and private experience. Working in a critical community in which the demands of politics and ideol- ogy are pressing, the apparently apolitical, insular characteristics of Japanese prose fiction may strike us as either a drastic limita- tion or a welcome escape. How does one account for the seem- ing lack of attention paid to turbulent political and social events in the canon of postwar narrative as it is currently defined? Or is this ultimately a false issue, because any thematic approach- one that looks for texts that overtly address Japan's expansion- ism and military aggression, class structure, Hiroshima, gender differences and on and on-falls into the traps of ignoring the ideological assumptions underlying any narrative and of reduc- ing narrative structure, linguistic features, and poetics to inci- dentals. James Fujii's Complicit Fictions and David Pollack's Read- ing Against Culture present themselves as potent reminders of the political and ideological nature of all texts and of the acts of reading and criticism. Fujii goes the farthest in challenging us to reconsider the means by which we evaluate the worldliness 195</page><page sequence="2">Volume 28, Number 2 of literary texts and the textual nature of our understanding of the world (a la Edward Said and Bakhtin): a "valuation of a literary work by its association with a history conceived either as context (background) or determinant of the literary text inadvertently trivializes both text and history by writing out the vital contestatory interaction between text and social process and the creative possibilities of that encounter" (Fujii, p. 104). At the risk of appearing reductive, I think it is fair to say that Fujii's and Pollack's texts concur on many basic tenets. For example, both writers assume the importance of situating themselves as critics and theoreticians, and both take as their primary point of reference the critical discourse on post-struc- turalist and deconstructionist theory. They repudiate the West- ern notion of the sanctified, transcendent individual and also question the concept of modernism and the West as inherently superior, as well as the claim that modern Japanese literature is primarily derivative. While Fujii focuses on the works of prewar male authors (Shimazaki T6son, Natsume S6seki, Tokuda Shusei, and Origuchi Shinobu), Pollack's hefty volume encompasses close readings mostly of postwar canonical texts (Soseki, Tanizaki Jun'ichiro, Kawabata Yasunari, Abe K6bo, Mishima Yukio, Oe Kenzaburo, and Kaik6 Takeshi). Formal components suggest the intended audience for each book. Pollack claims to cater to the general educated reader and thus, for example, does not put names in Japanese order (sup- posedly so as not to confuse the reader who, though otherwise intelligent, is unable to understand a preface in which Japanese name order is explained) and restricts his discussion to literary texts available in translation and critical works in English. At some points, Fujii seems to have in mind an audience of specialists, as is evidenced in his omission of glosses for some Japanese terms in the text itself (kindai jiga, p. 52; burakumin, p. 77; shominteki, p. 81). Given that, it is puzzling that he neglects to provide Japanese-speaking readers with the Japanese equivalents for sincerity, authenticity, and truthfulness, which he uses liberally in his discussion of Shimazaki Toson's works and Naturalism. 196</page><page sequence="3">Journal of the Association of Teachers of Japanese Stylistic and editorial decisions aside, the contrast between Pollack's and Fujii's critical stances and between their approach- es to narrative is highly suggestive. One significant sign of theoretical disagreement between the two critics lies in their approaches to difference. Following Catherine Stimpson's call to recognize and live "generously with difference," Pollack in- sists that "only by careful attention to and appreciation of modes of difference will we be able to deterritorialize the con- tentious ground that we all, ourselves and our others, stand on and must finally learn to share" (p. 11). Fujii, in keeping with his goal of "truly radical(izing) the study of Japanese literature" (p. 44), stresses that in our critical thinking we should not ignore or gloss over the "hard political edge" (p. 29). While this phrase appears in his discussion of contemporary readings of Bakhtin, it accurately describes Fujii's critical approach. He warns that "embracing Bakhtin's dialogism as polite encounters of respectful individual differences ignores the aspect of social struggle so central to his criticism" and also cautions against ignoring "a vast network of socially structured determinations and contradictions .. ." because doing so is yielding "to precisely the terms dictated by the empowered over the impoverished" (Fujii, p. 29). In other words, we should recognize that all social relationships are inherently unequal (or, as Audre Lorde has urged us, question whether the master's tools will dismantle the master's house). One of Fujii's projects is examining the ways seemingly apolitical texts are complicit with the structures of power, and even with Japan's aggression and brutal expan- sionism, an integral part of its becoming a moder nation. At the same time, Fujii recognizes "how tenuous is the distinction between a text's resistance to and complicity with other interests such as the state vying for control over subjects" (p. 222). Precisely because of Fujii's "hard political edge," which de- mands dogmatic adherence to certain principles, and because of Pollack's liberal generosity concerning difference, the two texts exhibit radically different approaches to narrative style and structure. Both writers make much of Bakhtin's notion of mul- tiplicity of voices in literary texts, but while Fujii writes about polyvocality, Pollack performs it. When reading Fujii's text, one gets the impression of sitting, seminar after seminar, with an 197</page><page sequence="4">Volume 28, Number 2 incisive, challenging thinker who is spelling out with greait precision his theoretical (and, to a lesser extent, subjective) "investment" in the study of (literary) texts. The teacher speaks with a fecund, though unitary, voice of authority. One can even detect the presence of his readers/students, as they silently question him about various aspects of his argument, constantly prodding him to refine his thesis. In addition, Fujii stresses the necessity of constantly taking into account the "present inter- pretive moment" as a further hedge against pretenses of time- less "objectivity and scholarly remove that has served to vali- date academic inquiry" (41), although, interestingly, he never allows his authority to lapse or his style to vary. In keeping with his advocacy of heterogeneity and poly- vocality, Pollack adopts many stances and speaks with many voices. In the space of one page, the reader variously encoun- ters the literary critic, the philosopher, the general educated reader ("Our picture of Japan is in large part a pastiche of ... colorful and exotic dramas, bloody revenges, delicate emotions, inscrutable suicides," p. 1), the would-be editor of Oe Kenzabu- ro's novels ("every reader must wish that Oe had ended the novel when . . "), the acerbic cultural critic, the theorist, the Western resident of Japan, the interpreter of Japan for non- specialists, as well as a creator of narrative who revels in the play of language, complex syntax, asserting his presence in the text. As Pollack himself acknowledges, an "important problem for [his] book . . is the extent to which one may legitimately play with another's language and still claim not to presume to be speaking for the Other" (p. 183). The metaphor of a hall of mirrors takes a central role in the work, presuming the signifi- cance of the indeterminacy and instability of language and discourse, and of culture itself. For Pollack, these mirrors are "self-reflecting regressions"; in other words, the "mythologiz- ing function of the idea of culture" that needs to be "resisted." As the title of Fujii's work suggests, a main focus is on the notion of the subject and "the way narratives participate in constructing subject positions" (p. 222). By Fujii's definition, a subject is not identified with the individual or self and is not necessarily human: "subjects can manifest themselves as voices, expressions of resistance or affirmation, speakers of a 198</page><page sequence="5">Journal of the Association of Teachers of Japanese particular language, even grammatical or linguistic forms" (p. 25). Subjects do not have a transcendent, essential, or stable identity, but rather are generated by narrative itself, and even narrative style can be the subject of a text. Fujii defines subjects as follows: "In the maze of conflicting views in the deconstruc- tive theories of the subject, the present study aligns itself with those that see subjects as the effects of agency" (p. 25). One difficulty with Fujii's theoretical position is his refusal to explain what he means by the term agency. He even confess- es his awareness of the vagueness of this concept: I proceed with analyses of the conditions of a subject's possibility and view subjects as reflections that can claim presence only through the intentions, deeds, or enactment of deeds from which subjects are inferred. This perspec- tive carries with it what many will judge an unfortunate ambiguity regarding the status of the subject and agency. Whatever its shortcomings may be, this approach has the virtue of focusing on the processes that narrativize or create subjects.... For it is precisely in the praxis, or the failure to act, the contingencies, and the unfolding of responses to them, not in some finalized image of a sub- ject, that meaning resides." (p. 26) In fact, I found Fujii's ambiguous treatment of the concept of agency a puzzling contrast to his usual conscientiousness about qualifying, defining, and defending his theoretical choices and terms (for example, the overly lengthy and detailed discus- sion of Bakhtin's thought and its reception in Japan). His terse statement that agency should be viewed as "positions character- ized by a self-reflective sense of responsibility and self-affirma- tion" (p. 73) is not very helpful, especially in trying to under- stand the relationship between agency and subjects, the latter being sometimes anthropomorphic, sometimes not. In addi- tion, I was left wondering if Fujii would only invoke the term agency in a discussion of post-Restoration Japanese literature, as opposed to premodern prose and verse (a brief note referring us to Norma Field's and Richard Okada's studies of Genji is of lit- tle help). In contrast to Pollack, who pays scant attention to autoch- thonous Japanese critics, Fujii rightly regards an exploration of 199</page><page sequence="6">Volume 28, Number 2 critical discourse surrounding literary works as an integral part of his study. In other words, Fujii recognizes that the critical narratives concerning any text become an inseparable part of that text. Fujii presents useful surveys of critical estimations of the works at hand, invoking the writings of critics such as Komori Yoichi, Karatani Kojin, and Kamei Hideo. One of the most fruitful discussions of a specific text is included in his chapter on Tokuda Shusei and the creation of the aru ga mama style, in which Fujii carefully examines Shusei's use of warai and me. Stepping back from individual scholars to consider the cur- rent state of the field in Japan, Fujii tosses out two tantalizing yet infuriating statements. First, he states that the more astute contemporary Japanese critics regard "judicious use of Western critical theories as a way out of the essentially Eurocentric stan- dards inscribed in nineteenth-century mimeticism" (p. 43). But is not this a paradox? Does this mean that there are no Japa- nese/non-Western critical theories/philosophies/systems of thought to which Japanese scholars refer? Are Western critical theories not by definition Eurocentric? As if in response to these queries, Fujii tersely concludes that "I suspect that much of contemporary theorizing is motivated by a conservative in- clination (passing as progressive) to claim an essentially decon- structive heritage predating European expressions by centuries and, relatedly, to affirm a native literature along similar lines" (pp. 43-44). One detects a contamination metaphor at work here, as if Fujii views pre-Restoration traditions of thought or criti- cism as inherently conservative, essentialist, and thus automat- ically polluted with right-wing, nationalist underpinnings. Rather than addressing this issue straight on, Fujii largely avoids probing into the complex and sensitive relationship between Japanese and non-Western systems of thought and nationalism. He does mention the aspects of Karatani's writing (specifically on fukei) and Origuchi's thinking that seem to "tread on sensitive ground" (p. 159), but then, without much explanation, gives them stamps of approval. He does not even comment on Origuchi's potentially potent use of the concept of kami no ronri (logic of kami; p. 228). 200</page><page sequence="7">Journal of the Association of Teachers of Japanese If Fujii's consistent and rigorous approach to methodology makes this book a model, his lack of interest in historical detail and Japan's connections to the Asian continent is disappoint- ing. For example, Fujii tends to employ the concepts of Western realism and Edo period gesaku as monolithic terms, static and possessing only a few defining characteristics. His consideration of genbun itchi starts out on a promising note, but is ultimately unsatisfying because it is heavy in critical pronouncements and glosses over or ignores detailed exploration of the ways readers, writers, publishers, and teachers regarded this new experiment in narrative-in other words, the process by which the new style of writing came into existence. Fujii instead concentrates on genbun itchi as a tool of the state aimed at exercising control over subjects, a "totalizing discourse for national consolida- tion." Eventually, Fujii begrudgingly admits that genbun itchi also might be considered an "egalitarian sign of language trans- formation that leveled class and gender-based distinctions" (p. 189). In his ambitious work, Pollack concentrates on four major issues: "1) the individual self, 2) ideology and its particular articulations, 3) the novel as a mode of representation, and 4) the concept of culture" (p. 6). For the most part, Pollack refuses to buy into popularly accepted notions about twentieth-century Japanese prose narra- tive. In addition to stressing the cultural, social, and historical ties of Japan to continental Asia more than do many interpre- ters of Japanese literature, Pollack balks at the assumptions that "modernism is inherently good; that individualism is inher- ently healthy; and that social homogeneity in a Japanese sense is somehow more pernicious than its manifestations else- where" (p. 231). For the most part, wrestling and sparring with Pollack is fun, but, I must admit, I got pretty damn tired of reading about Joseph Conrad and Roland Barthes and trying to figure out why Pollack devoted more pages to their work than to any of the following JAPANESE writers: Soseki, Kawabata, Abe Kobo, Oe Kenzabur6, Kaiko Takeshi. Only Mishima Yukio is accorded lengthier treatment. Pollack might have made his point (that as "contrasting paradigmatic examples of Rudyard Kipling and 201</page><page sequence="8">Volume 28, Number 2 Barthes suggest, Japan has exercised a powerful and various fas- cination on the Western imagination," p. 229) more succinctly. I, along with Pollack, found myself "blushing entirely too often in The Empire of Signs" (p. 30), but wish to point out that many volumes have been written on Barthes already, and for Pollack to devote so much space to Barthes' embarrassing stereotypes about Japan only serves to valorize that text. If Pollack had given equal time or credence to the works of Japanese critics or writers, then it would be easier to allow him the many pages he has devoted to blasting Barthes out of the water. Reading Against Culture is astonishingly male in its orien- tation, as is Fujii's Complicit Fictions. The fact that neither Pollack nor Fujii deals with any Japanese women writers, and that they pay only scant attention to feminist criticism, shows their complicity in the continuing canonization and privileging of texts by male authors and traditional conceptions of gender. They adhere to previous concepts of the center and the margin- al. I do appreciate Fujii's refusal to "focus on issues of gender, treating it as an essentialized binarism that endlessly replays the dominance of maleness in its myriad forms over its putative obverse, femaleness" (p. 204), as well as his confession of his "own marginal relationship to feminist thought" (p. xv). At the same time, considerations of gender can also take the form of bringing to light aspects of literature and culture previously ignored in intellectual inquiry. Fujii's acknowledgment of marginal presences in Japanese literature is evidenced only in his inclusion of Origuchi's text. Pollack sometimes goes overboard in his attempt to be fair, almost sounding like an apologist for Confucianism, for exam- ple, which "does at least manage to provide them [women] with a legitimate place in the social scheme. This is something with which the Freudian account of Western psychosocial de- velopment never really manages to come to terms" (p. 47). In his effort not to ally himself with the misogyny of Freud, Pol- lack ends up comparing apples and oranges, a social ideology and a psychology. Pollack also comes to some astonishing estimations con- cerning female characterization in the works he examines. It is a disservice to advise the general reader that Mishima in After 202</page><page sequence="9">Journal of the Association of Teachers of Japanese the Banquet has rendered Kazu as "one of the most entirely sympathetic women in Japanese fiction" (p. 105, n. 9). Have not Higuchi Ichiyo, Kanai Mieko, K6da Aya, Uno Chiyo, and others (not to mention many male authors), created extremely sympa- thetic female characters? One wonders what reader Pollack is trying to correct when he asserts that Kawabata's Komako in Snow Country "might appear to be one of the few women in Japanese fiction who really does develop over time" (p. 112)? To what reader might Komako appear that way? He corrects this misconception by insisting that Komako's "development is in fact determined by the homology between her character and myth." While his point about the role of myth in Snow Coun- try remains compelling, why does Pollack insist on muddling it all with sweeping generalizations about the misreadings of a hypothetical reader? If there is a critic to whom he is respond- ing, then he should name names, rather than assuming that all of us misguided readers, even the feminists among us, have mistaken Komako for one of Japanese literature's more fully developed female characters, rather than, as only Pollack seems to know, one that is mythical in dimension, and imagistically often little more than an alluring scent on Shimamura's "fin- ger" (the one that remembers Komako so well) and a desire for fire and ice. On Kawabata's Snow Country, Pollack writes that the text "represents and supports an ideology of male authority" by "depicting the fundamental role of such authority as the cre- ation and occupation of that essential and seminal space which alone is able to unite the otherwise unbridgeable and oscillating polarities between the schizophrenically divided and eternally incomplete Whore/Mother and Heaven/Earth aspects of fe- male nature" (p. 119). Furthermore, Pollack asserts that Shima- mura and others of Kawabata's men are like "gods-or to make clearer the ideological nature of the problem, like the emperor himself-they need only exist to confer being and order upon an otherwise chaotically fragmented universe" (p. 120). In this scheme of things, Kawabata's works do not ultimately challenge male authority "thanks to the active intervention of women- whose very existence, after all, depends entirely on keeping it propped up" (p. 120). So male authority is all the women's 203</page><page sequence="10">Volume 28, Number 2 fault! Pollack even invokes Terry Eagleton, whom he inexpli- cably regards as writing "as if in reference to Kawabata's work" to assert that if it "offers a generous utopian image of reconcilia- tion between men and women,... it also blocks and mystifies the real political movement towards such historical communi- ty" (120). How can Snow Country be said to offer such utopian imagery? To flip the coin over, men such as Shimamura exist only in reference to women. Shimamura's dominance derives from his privileged position as a man of leisure, yet he is also pathetic, bored, a man who comes alive-exists in the narrative-only in the company of women he hires to perform as companions. There is something aesthetically pleasing about Pollack's com- plex assertion that, on the contrary, Shimamura's character is not shallow, but rather like the "night-mirror" in the opening passage, pointing to the "interpenetration" of reality and illu- sion, which in the end are not opposites but "realms that inter- penetrate in complex ways" (p. 119). At the same time, render- ing this ambiguous role of man into that of a god, the creator, requires a mighty leap of faith. Pollack refers to the critical writings of only a few female and feminist critics, and almost the only female fiction writers whom he mentions are Virginia Woolf and George Eliot. In the process of pointing out that the "Western novel" is not a uni- tary or uniform genre, Pollack states that "narrativity had fragmented into that shattered mirror of points of view and divergent spaces already pointed out by Erich Auerbach in his famous 1947 essay on Virginia Woolf" (p. 141). Rhetorically, in this sentence, Pollack relegates Woolf to a position of inciden- tal, marginal. It is Auerbach, the male critic, whom he situates centrally. In the very next sentence, however, he goes on to point out that "In Japan, . . . writers such as K6b6 Abe were also at work helping to turn conventional expectations on their heads" (141). In another vein, the chapter on Kokoro offers a compelling case for regarding Soseki's work not merely as a coming-of-age narrative, but in relation to Confucian thought and social prac- tice as it existed in early twentieth century Japan, as well as to the concept of the self. It is interesting, however, to contrast 204</page><page sequence="11">Journal of the Association of Teachers of Japanese Pollack's thinking on Kokoro with that of Fujii's discussion of the same text. While Fujii's discussion would have been strengthened by consideration of the philosophical and ideo- logical issues that Pollack focuses on (especially Confucian thought), great merit lies in Fujii's insistence upon examining Kokoro's canonical status. Pollack asserts that in Kokoro S6seki strove to show that the loss of traditional Confucian social norms resulted in exposing the essential evil of human nature. To S6seki, such human nature stood in opposition both to Western notions of the sacrosanct individual and Confucian affirmation that people are essentially good. Pollack's reading reveals Kokoro as subversive because it is a "potent attempt to dismantle the central ideological tenet of the Meiji emperor's Imperial rescript on education" (239). In contrast, Fujii asserts that the "canonization of Kokoro in part rests upon the text's very inability to articulate the connec- tion" between modernity and "Japanese nationhood, particu- larly as the former becomes manifest as expansionism on the Asian continent" (p. 127). While Pollack is content with person- ifying the Novel by quoting from Fredric Jameson's assertion that the Novel is a "hegemonic work whose formal categories as well as its content secure the legitimation of this or that form of class domination" (p. 184), Fujii recognizes that a literary text has no power to secure anything (also drawing on Jameson). Rather, the processes of canonization as evidenced by Japan's educational system, critical practice, and consumption patterns become the means by which Kokoro is rendered hegemonic, or legitimizing of certain hierarchies or power relationships. To Fujii, Soseki's glorification and Sensei's emulation of Nogi's junshi (following one's lord in death) represent the sup- pression of the ugly reality of Nogi's role as a military leader, sacrificing the lives of tens of thousands of his troops during the Russo-Japanese war. In other words, Soseki considered Nogi merely in his iconic and idealized role of mythical "hero" because of his astonishing suicide, and by extension ignored the brutal aspects of Japanese nationhood, its military aggression and economic expansionism. Pollack does not delve into the very real historical and ideological implications of Soseki's regard for (or blindness concerning) Nogi's role as a military 205</page><page sequence="12">Volume 28, Number 2 leader in Meiji Japan. At other points, Pollack, relying heavily on Jay Rubin's fascinating Injurious to Public Morals, examines the role of censorship and state suppression, but does not as often take the extra step of looking at the role of education, the critical establishment, and the marketplace in forming the canon, and specifically, in determining what is deemed to be serious literature to be read and discussed, and what is not. While Pollack regards the canonization of S6seki's works as a given, he bemoans Oe Kenzaburo's inclusion in the literary canon as a "sad but understandable fate," even implying that this is just punishment for Oe's supposed essentialism and inability to sustain in his narrative "that lightness of being which signals the ability ... to be inside oneself and outside at the same time" (p. 227). For Fujii, "modern Japanese narratives that come to occupy what we can only metaphorically call the heart of the canon observe a kind of social contract to occlude such differences as class and competing political interests.... A text like Kokoro does not simply or neatly eliminate traces of social and political differentiation; but the very internal contra- dictions and differences of that text must be suppressed so that it can be made to belong to, and to construct, a modern Japanese literary canon" (Fujii, p. 131). Pollack does similarly stress that the novel is "founded on the myth . . . that its own privileged condition is natural and good, even as it depends on the op- pression of others" (p. 98). At other points, Pollack radically understates Japan's role in the international community. For example, in his effort to contrast Japan's experience with other nations where "the late nineteenth- and twentieth-century novel is predicated in part upon the experience of a colonial empire with its shock ... of otherness and alienation" (p. 189), he posits that the Japanese shosetsu is based on the lack or "pretense of lack" of that colo- i:ial experience. And then, in one astonishingly brief and dis- missive passage, Pollack informs us, "Only relatively belatedly did Japan become modem enough briefly to possess a colonial empire of its own: Korea in 1910, then Taiwan, later Manchuria and Sakhalin, and during the Pacific War an appetite for China, 206</page><page sequence="13">Journal of the Association of Teachers of Japanese the Philippines, and Southeast Asia" (p. 189). The same sort of flippancy leads Pollack to other questionable judgments, and not only about Japanese narrative. In his discussion of imperi- alism and the novel, Pollack comes to the defense of writer V.S. Naipaul, attacked by Rob Nixon for capitalizing on his status as "a permanent ex-colonial" (p. 184) who complains of his "homelessness" although he lives comfortably in a world where there are many people who truly have no access to shel- ter. Pollack does so in the following terms: "This seems ungen- erous [of Nixon], not unlike accusing Hemingway of a life mis- spent in writing stylishly about bullfighting instead of working to protect the poor animals from such wanton brutality" (p. 185, n. 9). Pollack's analogy is both inappropriate and brutal. Hem- ingway never claimed to be a bull, and, besides, people are people and cows are cows, sacred or not. Or is that valorizing the human too much? In studies of post-Restoration Japan, a critic must constantly struggle to make distinctions between Western influence, mod- ernization, technological advances, and the concept of progress. For example, Pollack describes one of Kaiko Takeshi's characters as somehow "Western" because he enjoys the luxury of mate- rial cultural "closer to the metropolitan experience of Europe" and the U.S. than "to that of the rural peasantry of a Third World country such as Vietnam" (p. 215). Are such patterns of consumption and advanced technology "Western" or are they indicative of socioeconomic class and economic and (post)in- dustrial conditions? At the same time, Pollack concedes that Kaiko's Japanese character does share cultural assumptions and baggage with the Vietnamese because they are both "Asians," hinting that the common script and Confucian and Buddhist systems of belief constitute the concept that is called Asia. In this review, I have taken issue with many aspects of both Fujii's and Pollack's texts, but this is a function of how stimulat- ing, rich, and suggestive both are. A reading that would do jus- tice to these texts would be many hundreds of pages longer than this article, partly because the complexity of thought and rhetoric demands response in kind, with the same erudition and a similar predilection variously for rigor and daring. Fujii 207</page><page sequence="14">208 Volume 28, Number 2 and Pollack challenge the reader to consider in much greater depth the boundaries that have been conceived of as separating narrative and the extraliterary.</page></plain_text>
