<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORLD VIEW AND SOCIAL RELATIONS IN GUATEMALA* By SOL TAX T WO classes of people constitute virtually the entire population of the present-day Republic of Guatemala. They are the Indians and the Ladinos. The Indians are for the most part relatively full blooded de- scendants of those whom the Spanish conquerors found in possession of the land in 1524. The Ladinos for the most part are mixed bloods. But the dis- tinction is not to be drawn in terms of biological race, nor even of socio- logical race; for the people concerned are little inclined to attach social differences to biological origins. At least in the Western Highland region of the country, the area to which this discussion is limited, the class indices are primarily cultural and linguistic. The origin of the use of the terms Indian and Ladino with non-racial connotations is suggested by Batres Jauregui's definition of the term Ladino: The word ... meant in old Spanish "the romance or new language," from which it was derived that those who spoke one or more languages besides their own were called ladinos, and thus the Indians who spoke ladino (or Castilla as they themselves call it) were called ladinos. The meaning of this word is now extended to all those who in these countries are not Indians, or even when they are Indians, do not retain their language or customs.' It appears that after the Conquest colonists were few and women among them scarce. Spanish men married Indians and an intermediate class of Mestizos emerged; for a period, classes of Negroes, Zambos, and Mulattoes were also recognized.2 But simultaneously the term Ladino came to be applied to Indians "who lived and worked in the cities as artisans"3 and it may be surmised that such Indians had already adopted elements of Spanish culture and language. Possibly the Ladino Indians tended to marry into groups of other blood; but whatever the case, it is noteworthy that the mixed-blood classes which had been designated by race names were even- tually absorbed into the Indian-Ladino classification which had from the beginning cultural rather than racial connotations.

The Indians today live for the most part in communities in each of which they retain ethnic identity and separateness from Ladinos expressed in a unified Indian social-political-religious system, in a body of cultural meanings and beliefs not shared by Ladinos, in a distinguishing costume pattern, and in the use of an Indian dialect. The Ladinos are the representa- tives of Spanish and European traditions, even though not unmixed with Indian. There is not, and apparently for a long time has not been,4 any serious social impediment to passage from the Indian to the Ladino class. To say that despite this there occurs virtually no such passing' in the Western Highlands is largely another way of asserting that the Indians are not being acculturated to the Ladinos; for when an Indian adopts Spanish as his language, Ladino-style clothes, and the Ladino way of life in general, he is generally recognized as having passed into the Ladino class. This evident lack of acculturation is not explicable in terms of physical isolation of Indians from Ladinos. It is true that Ladinos comprise less than ten percent of the population of the region, but they live in every part of it. They live for the most part in towns, while the Indians are to a greater ex- tent rural. But they live in towns which are social, religious, and market centers for the Indians,6 and as will be seen below, the contacts are con- tinual. The towns are, moreover, linked to the capital by highways and bus- lines and by telegraph and telephone, while the Ladinos of the towns often- 4 Jones (op. cit., p. 272) says that "those who take on Ladino dress and activities become Ladinos even though of Indian blood" and adds in a footnote (p. 395) that "Precedents of this sort were created by law even in the colonial period. A law of October 13, 1876 expressly authorized such changes." It may be added that change from Indian to Ladino ways, espe- cially in language and costume, appears to be encouraged rather than discouraged by both the government and Ladino opinion. What little anti-Indian prejudice there is among Ladinos is expressed in depreciation less of Indian blood and character than of Indian "backwardness." 6 This statement is based chiefly on field experience, but it is borne out by the census records. If very many Indians were passing into the Ladino class, the rate of increase of the Ladino population would probably be considerably higher than that of the Indian. But the rates of geometric increase per 1000 from 1893 to 1921 were calculated by Shattuck (A Medical Survey of the Republic of Guatemala, Carnegie Institution of Washington Publication No. 499, Washington, 1938, p. 11) as 13.5 for Ladinos and 13.7 for Indians. Nor can the possibility that the rate of natural increase is greater among Indians be allowed, for Shattuck (op. cit., p. 13) calculates the natural increase rate per 1000 population as 22.5 among Ladinos and 21.9 among Indians. Unless, therefore, it be supposed that many Ladinos pass into the Indian group (contrary to observation) the conclusion is inescapable that Indians have not been becoming Ladinos. 6 Sol Tax, The Municipios of the Midwestern Highlands of Guatemala (American Anthro- pologist, Vol. 39, No. 3, 1937), pp. 430, 432.</page><page sequence="3">TAX] WORLD VIEW AND SOCIAL RELATIONS IN GUATEMALA 29 have close connections with that center of modern influences. The Indians may therefore be said to be living in continued physical contact with sub- urbs of modern urban civilization. To suggest some of the reasons for the lack of acculturation of the Indians to Ladino and modern Euro-American civilization, it will be necessary to turn first to the equally interesting inter- relations of the Indian communities themselves. It may be recalled that communities of typical Indians are identified with municipios which, while somewhat comparable to townships, are in Guatemala the important ethnic units.' There is much that is common to the cultures of all of the municipios, but there are also some rather striking differences as one passes from one to another. The Indians of a municipio think of themselves as a distinct group of people, biologically and socially. Each municipio typically has its own costume, different from those of its neighbors, and this costume is a label wherever the Indians go. Each has, moreover, a relatively exclusive set of customs and practices, including those of birth, baptism, system of naming, marriage, burial; kinship and family and household organization; and rituals of many kinds. Even in de- tails of diet and cookery, and etiquette, as well as in house types and other material things, municipios often differ in greater or less detail from all of their neighbors. Each municipio tends to have its own economic specialties, sometimes its own economic and social values, and even its own different standard of living. Each municipio has a politico-religious organization in- dependent, within limits, of any other; each has a variant of the general system of public service; each has its own saints, its own fiestas for them, and its own annual religious calendar. At the same time, all of the Indians typical of one municipio are strictly part of that community, wearing rela- tively the same costume, speaking the common dialect (different in most cases from the dialects of its neighbors), engaging in the favored economic pursuit, participating in the politico-religious organization, and having the common customs and beliefs. To be sure there are variations and non- typical individuals, but the variations are not often such as to bring a person closer to a neighboring-municipio than to his own. Such mutual exclusiveness exists in spite of the physical proximity of the municipios to each other. Towns are in some cases separated by no more than a half-hour's walk, and in one case by only a few blocks, while the lands tilled by the townspeople of two different municipios in many cases adjoin. Where Indians live in the country, moreover, there are many cases where neighboring families are in different municipios, and yet most of the differences typical of those municipios exist also between such neighbors. Op. cit., pp. 433 ff.</page><page sequence="4">30 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 43, 1941 There is, furthermore, continuous intercommunication among the municipios. First of all, the Indians of one often go to live in others, some- times intermarrying (in which case the offspring are usually absorbed into the culture of the community in which they are raised), more often holding themselves somewhat aloof and forming either a separate social class or a colony apart. Such "foreign" Indians keep their old costumes, their own language, often their own trades or economic specialties, and, apparently, their own culture. Such colonies represent the closest kind of contact be- tween municipios (excepting intermarriage itself) because of the social rela- tions that inevitably grow up between the home group and the foreign groups and because the "colonial" Indians frequently visit "back home" and serve as connecting links between the municipios involved. But there are other interrelations of municipios as well. Economic rela- tions are most important. Specialization begets exchange of commodities which is accomplished for the most part through public markets. Most towns have regular market-days on which people from far and near meet to buy and sell their own products or, as middlemen, those of others.8 Regularly, once or twice a week or more, large numbers of Indians from diverse municipios come to each market to buy and sell, or often merely to enjoy the gaiety of the occasion. Usually the relations established are super- ficial; but often, since the same people come together repeatedly, they come to know one another by sight and by name, and learn something of the personal characteristics, language, and customs of such acquaintances. They sometimes eat and sleep together and become friends. In some important markets people from many towns regularly meet. In travelling to the market-town they pass through still other places and in the course of time come to know them well and to establish personal contacts in them. At the same time, middlemen regularly visit several towns each week and establish relationships in each. Nor do merchants meet only in the markets; they also sometimes buy at homes where merchandise is grown or made, and such contacts may be repeated. Economic relations concern not only trade, but land ownership and cultivation as well. Indians of one municipio frequently own land in another and go to work it days or weeks at a time. Likewise, Indians of land-poor municipios find work in neighboring municipios; such laborers frequently board with their employers. It may also be noted that Indians from diverse municipios of the highlands meet to work and live for seasons or years at a time on plantations of the lowlands, where they are the closest of neighbors. 8 F. W. McBryde has described economic specialization and the market system in The Native Economy of Western Guatemala (Thesis, University of California, Berkeley, 1940).</page><page sequence="5">TAX] WORLD VIEW AND SOCIAL RELATIONS IN GUATEMALA 31 Government, too, brings together Indians from different municipios, since those who are officials in any given year frequently meet in the offices of the Departmental capital to transact similar business. Also, Indians of small and out-of-the-way municipios pick up mail and telegrams in other towns and stay the whole day or night. Finally, religious fiestas and pil- grimages take Indians from their home towns to others where for a few days they witness dances and rituals differing in details from those of their own. With the exception that the women of some towns rarely visit others, so that their contacts with outsiders are confined to visitors to their towns, there is hardly a man, woman, or child that I know who has not visited a dozen or more municipios, and who does not regularly frequent at least one or two. Some municipios are virtually deserted one or two days every week. Everybody travels, and travels often, for even if the Indians have nothing to buy and sell, they still enjoy going to markets and fiestas. Men, however, travel oftener and farther, as a rule, than women. It is therefore not surprising that the Indians of one muncipio know a great deal about the people and customs of others. The average Indian could no doubt write large fragments of the ethnography of half-a-dozen towns other than his own. Although occasionally scornful of the customs of other communities, he more frequently does not evaluate them. "That is their custom; it is all right for them," appears to be the most general atti- tude. To the Indians cultural differences between themselves and outsiders are as much to be expected as differences in kinds of trees. It would be in- accurate to say that the close contact and resultant knowledge on the part of one group of Indians of differences of culture among others have not re- sulted in some diffusion. Many cases of borrowing of crops and the tech- niques for growing them have been noted; when it is a matter of dollars and cents, the Indians do not ordinarily evidence conservatism; indeed, the free competition of individuals, each looking for a profitable enterprise, would discourage such conservatism. There also appears to be a fairly free interchange of folklore and remedies and the like. But it is a curious kind of interchange, one that recognizes the local nature of culture. Just as it is known that a plant that yields well in one town will not necessarily yield in another, so it is supposed that a remedy need not be universally ap- plicable. A plant or technique or custom appears to be considered as belong- ing to a particular community, its people and its soil. Thus, there is a fairly strong belief in Panajachel that if a crop that grows well in one town is planted in another where it has not been grown, the "spirit" of the plant might shift its locale and the plant consequently prosper in its new habitat and fail in its old. (Hence the Indians are disturbed when Indians of another</page><page sequence="6">32 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 43, 1941 town begin to cultivate a local crop.) Somewhat similarly, merely because Indians of one town are believed able to secure fortunes from the owner of a hill or volcano does not mean that those of another can do likewise. There may be said to be a culture trait of acceptance of cultural dif- ferences. In general the attitude required is one of neutrality--neither laudatory nor condemnatory. The Indians of one town may look down on those of another, possibly all others, but as far as I know, there are no cases of mutual acceptance of vertical status of any kind in the relations of two Indian communities. As a consequence, there is no question of the ap- preciation of elements of culture because of their association with a superior group. Indians of another town may be considered lazy or stupid, but as far as I know, depreciative epithets in terms of customs are not applied to them. It is of course a relatively simple matter to explain cultural similarities in contiguous communities. We take it to be natural that culture diffuses. The great similarity of the cultures of these Indian societies, which makes it possible to draw a generalized picture of the culture of the whole region, is easily understandable when it is considered that the groups are genetically related in the first place, that influences from outside were given the op- portunity to affect them all equally, and that new developments in each could easily diffuse to others. We also recognize in culture the tendency to differentiation, especially under conditions of isolation. The two opposite processes, differentiation and diffusion, account in general for the distribu- tion of culture traits as we find them anywhere. It may appear to observers in Guatemala that the proportion of differences to similarities, in view of the lack of physical isolation, is greater than might be expected. Whether this is true or not would be difficult to judge without some study of local culture variations all over the world measured on the basis of some estab- lished index. But whether or not the Guatemalan situation should properly occasion surprise, it may supply data for the study of barriers to normal diffusion where isolation is not a factor and where the cultures involved are much alike. That is, in order to understand how culture assimilation comes about, it is of value to uncover some of the factors that prevent it. Such factors as the relative efficiency of competing traits, differences between traits of technology, social organization, and folklore, or the com- patahility of the new traits with the established culture, need hardly be dis- cussed here. They are amply covered in the literature and are sufficiently a part of anthropological experience to permit the assumption that they are known to the reader. The observations that follow are based on such general knowledge, but they grow directly from experience in Guatemala. In the large area of culture wherein questions of obvious efficiency are</page><page sequence="7">TAX] WORLD VIEW AND SOCIAL RELATIONS IN GUATEMALA 33 absent, a factor aside from ordinary conservatism that in Guatemala stands in the way of diffusion is the indifference that is engendered by knowledge on the part of the Indians that cultures do after all differ just as do plants or people. It would appear that just as some languages tend to adopt the foreign words that are diffused with the things or concepts for which they stand while other languages make up new words under the same circum- stances, it is part of the pattern of some cultures to decline for no social or special cultural reason the adoption of new culture traits when there is no particular reason for such adoption. This happens to be a trait of the Guate- malan cultures. One of the ways in which this trait apparently works is in- direct. It acts as a barrier to disorganization of the culture that is apt to result from the presence of alternative ways of customary behavior.9 Where an individual of society A has a culture trait x, he may also be aware that in society B there is a culture trait y that is an alternative to x. But for him y need not become an alternative mode of behavior if it is altered by the recognition that it belongs to B. So it appears to be in Guatemala. If all Guatemala should be considered one society, many of the cultural dif- ferences between the Guatemalan communities would thus be what Linton has called "Specialties," or differences of culture associated with different culturally recognized sub-groups of the society. The Guatemalan com- munities may, however, be more fruitfully treated as separate local societies, and it may be said that as such they merely recognize in each other groups which appropriately have different cultures. By thus making "Specialties" of what would otherwise be alternatives, the attitude of culture-conscious- ness discourages disorganization which would bring into being a fluidity in which cultural assimilation would flourish. Another consideration involved in explaining the situation in Guatemala is that the nature of the society or culture emphasizes the impersonal character of social relations of all kinds, both within the community and be- tween people of different communities. There is first of all, and even in the family, a commercial spirit;'0 but whether or not the development of com- merce was historically responsible, today impersonality is manifest not only in economic but in political and religious life, and in family relations as well. More about this characteristic will be said later; the point here is that it allows the establishment of widespread social relations with a minimum of the kind of intimate contacts by means of which cultural items are best exchanged. 9 R. Linton, The Study of Man (New York, 1936), pp. 282-283. 10 Described in Robert Redfield, Primitive Merchants of Guatemala (Quarterly Journal of Inter-American Relations, Vol. 1, No. 4, 1939), pp. 48-49.</page><page sequence="8">34 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 43, 1941 Redfield has published" a brief account of two institutions which exemplify mechanisms in Guatemala by which this is made possible. One of these, by which possessions are left recomendado with acquaintances or even strangers along the roads of commerce, is comparable to a checking service in the Union Station (except that there is no charge), and it facilitates the wide commerce without establishment of close social relations. The other, by which people ask posada at the homes of acquaintances or strangers when away from their home towns, is comparable to hotel service in a large city, since relations between guest and host are often no more intimate. Redfield cites a case from the Ladino community in which he lived where an Indian came several times a year to a Ladino home where "he slept in a corner of the kitchen while the women of the house continued their cooking and con- versation. But these women knew almost nothing about the man; they were not even sure of his name."'2 Since merchants have regular routes, they tend to seek lodging and to leave merchandise recomendado in the same places repeatedly. The institutions are well established, and great impersonality characterizes their exercise. These institutions Redfield considers mechanisms by which travellers are insulated from the deeper contact that might otherwise accompany such mobility as is found in Guatemala.3 Thus the physical contact remains little more than physical. But they are also significant as symbols, for the reason why the social contacts do not have depth is to be found in the general culture and the structure of the society. Part of it goes back to the indifference to cultural differences; curiosity is not fanned by interest. Part of it is to be found in the general sameness of Guatemalan culture be- cause of which many questions that might be asked visitor or host are answered without being asked; there is usually no question as to where an Indian hails from, or where he is going, or why. Part of it may be accounted for in the very frequency of such contacts, by which shoulders are rubbed with strangers every day of the week and every week of the year; if there were less physical contact of people of various communities, it is not un- likely that there would be more interchange of culture. As it is, the inter- societal relations are not unlike those of a great city in which a most general characteristic is the anonymity of the inhabitants. More will be said on that score, but it may be pointed out here that the impersonal nature of social relations that characterize the Indians may also be considered a reason why they can continue indifferent to cultural diversities, even as such indiffer- 11 Ibid., pp. 53-54. 12 Ibid., p. 54. 13 Ibid.</page><page sequence="9">TAX] WORLD VIEW AND SOCIAL RELATIONS IN GUATEMALA 35 ence makes possible the impersonal plane on which the social relations are maintained. It seems to me that the pattern of relations that exist between Indian communities and Indian cultures, and which I have now so briefly described, is a fundamental characteristic of Guatemalan Indian life. Both Redfield14 and 115 are inclined to the opinion, in fact, that much of it goes back to pre- Hispanic times, and that it developed with the money economy and wide- spread system of trade, and the wide formal political institutions, that existed in Guatemala before the Conquest. The processes of secularization and individualization that result from contact with Euro-American civiliza- tion, as Redfield has described them for Yucatan,' have no doubt strength- ened similar tendencies already present in Guatemala. But it is not difficult to suppose that the pattern of Guatemalan Indian society served to defend it to some extent from the disorganization of culture that was another result of the contact in Yucatan. For in the first place the local Indian cultures had already built up a resistance (with the aid of their culture trait of indiffer- ence) against the acceptance of alternative patterns of behavior incompati- ble with those already present; in the second place, the impersonality of relations with outsiders, which could be carried to newcomers, shielded them from contacts with cultural depth; and in the third place the very similarity of their kinds of social relations to those characterizing Spain reduced the shock of the contact. These processes are not entirely something of the past, for one can see them at work in some places in Guatemala today. There are places where Ladinos have moved into the community only relatively recently, and although the great revolution took place 400 years ago, the Indians since then were able to reorganize their lives in relative isolation until the coming of these new outsiders. One can see in a place like Chichicastenango, for example, how the Indians could take in their stride the opening of a car road, the establishment of a hotel, and the influx of thousands of tourists with avid curiosity, cameras, and most important of all, money. There was a short period from about 1932 to 1936 when there was some rebellion against the invasion of the church and marketplace of the town; but the tourists were rapidly fitted into the economic system as a market for textiles with no apparent effects on the fundamental culture which, after all, is patterned to make just such outward adjustments. It is seen also in places where 1 Ibid., pp. 55-56. 15 Cf. my Culture and Civilization in Guatemalan Societies (The Scientific Monthly, May 1939), p. 467. 16 Culture Change in Yucatan (American Anthropologist, Vol. 36, No. 1, 1934), pp. 57-69.</page><page sequence="10">36 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 43, 1941 Ladinos have lived for many generations, for here it is apparent that the attitude extended by the Indians to Indians of other communities is carried as well to the Ladinos. Ladino customs are known, but again the Indians are largely indifferent to them. The case of Ladinos (and of course foreigners) makes significant another trait of Indian culture that has been mentioned above-the belief that culture is local, and even tied to the biology of different peoples. If an Indian is not sure that a remedy for a certain sickness will be equally effective in one community of Indians as in another, it is not difficult to see that he is also protected from conflict when he sees that Ladinos or foreigners con- tinually do things that his culture tells him are sinful or will cause sickness or idiocy. The Ladinos can behave differently because they are different. It does not long surprise the Indians to hear that in the United States bread is preferred to tortillas, and even that there are no tortillas, in spite of the fact that they know absolutely that an Indian cannot fill up on bread no matter how much he eats. Nor does the information cause them to question the veracity of their stomachs. Acculturation to Ladinos can therefore be described largely in the same terms as acculturation of Indian communities to each other. And indeed it seems to me that the same factors apply to what acculturational influences stem from modern civilization, if not to those resulting from the Conquest itself four centuries ago. In attempting to put the factors involved in general terms, I have had recourse to the concepts crystallized by Redfield in his interpretation of culture change in Yucatan.17 As he generalized from his experience, he pointed out that the way of life of "primitive" peoples can be contrasted with the way of life characterizing "civilization," and es- pecially modern urban communities, in terms of a change from a relatively immobile, homogeneous society in which relationships are personal and con- trols familial and characterized by a well-integrated culture adjusted to its local milieu and in which sacred sanctions and ritual are important, to one tending to have opposite characteristics. But it soon became apparent to both Redfield and myself that in Guatemala the societies studied are "small, unsophisticated, homogeneous in beliefs and practices... mobile, with relationships impersonal, with formal institutions dictating the acts of in- dividuals, and with familial organization weak, with life secularized, and with individuals acting more from economic or other personal advantage than from any deep conviction or thought of social good."18 We have been led to believe, furthermore (as I have already indicated), that this is no 17 Ibid. 18 Tax (1939), p. 467.</page><page sequence="11">TAX] WORLD VIEW AND SOCIAL RELATIONS IN GUATEMALA 37 case of cultural lag of some elements in a process of acculturation. As Redfield put it, "The combination of commercialism and certain features of primitive life appears to be a relatively stable one. It is probable that before the Conquest the Highland Civilization had already many of these fea- tures."'" Nor do we need to assume that Guatemala is unique in having a combination of characters that partake of the characteristics of both folk culture and civilization. West Africa, and doubtless other localities, prob- ably supply other examples. It seems to me that we can profitably make a distinction between two aspects of culture that will cut across Redfield's distinction. We may say that in respect to their world view the Guatemalan Indians are of the primitive type, while in respect to their kind of social relations, they are of the civilized type. By the phrase "world view" I mean of course "the mental apprehension of reality" which includes the total of knowledge and beliefs about nature and man. By the phrase "social relations" I mean to include all kinds of personal and institutionalized social, economic, political and religious relations among men. And while it is true that the mental percep- tion of social relations enters into and is part of the world view, I mean to treat the general world view separately from the dominant kinds of social relations. It appears justifiable to say that the world view typical of preliterate peoples is different from that typical in our Western urban society. In the first place the primitive view is quantitatively smaller and more restricted in its range; we know about them and they do not know about us; we have some acquaintance with the whole world, they of a very small portion; we are said to be more sophisticated than they. In the second place the two views differ in content. This difference, so familiar to ethnologists, is de- scribed by Boas as follows:20 One of the most striking features in the thoughts of primitive people is the pe- culiar manner in which concepts that appear to us alike and related are separated and rearranged .... The whole classification of experience . . . follows entirely dis- tinct lines (p. 198). The concepts of primitive man make it quite clear that the classes of ideas which we consider as attributes are often considered as independent objects. The best known case . . . is that of sickness. While we consider sickness as a condition of the organism, it is believed by primitive man ... to be an object which may enter the body.... Other qualities are treated in the same way. Thus the conditions of 19 Redfield (1939), p. 55. 20 Franz Boas, The Mind of Primitive Man (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1929), pp. 197 ff.</page><page sequence="12">38 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 43, 1941 hunger, exhaustion, and similar bodily feelings are considered by certain primitive tribes as independent objects which affect the body. Even life is believed to be a material object that may become separated from the body. The luminosity of the sun is considered as an object that the sun himself may put on or lay aside. ... The concept of anthropomorphism seems to be one of the important cate- gories underlying primitive thought (pp. 200-201.). This does not, of course, imply a difference in "kinds of minds" or of mental processes. The difference is strictly cultural; the world view of a people is a facet of its culture, and one of the respects in which the cultures of typical primitives differ from that of our civilization. It is not contended that the distinction is so clear-cut that a particular people or person can always be said to have either a primitive or a civilized world-view; for that matter I cannot even answer the question as to which kind of world-view the Chinese or the East Indians or the ancient Egyptians or Athenians have or have had. But we can safely deal in terms of such a distinction in a comparison of aboriginal Sioux Indians or Australians or Eskimos and 20th century Chicago, London, or Paris. A similar distinction can be made between the general type of social relations governing preliterate tribes and the general type present in modern civilization. Such relations in a primitive group, as Redfield has pointed out, are personal, based on kinship, and sacred, governed by informal institutions and by moral convictions. In our society, of course, the characteristic type of social relations tends to have opposite characteristics. The world-view general among the Guatemalan Indians is, as I have said, of the primitive type. Like classical "primitives," their minds are clouded with animism: sun and earth, river and hill, are anthropomorphized; animals talk; plants have emotions; it is possible for a hoe to work alone; such things as fire and maize are capable of direct punitive action. A pair of twins, a mute, and a six-toed man have special powers; a woman by her organic nature is dangerous to masculine strength; some people have such natures that with a look they bring disease to one who is "weak of blood." Animals, plants, humans alike change their natures with the phases of the moon. People can change into animals; ghosts are always abroad; the soul of a person leaves his body for hours or days while he still lives. Sorcery is a commonplace, and an important part in treatment of disease is divina- tion and ritual. These are not simply superstitions still left to a few old people; they are part of the life of the community, shared by old and young alike and normally taken into consideration in determining courses of action. They are premises upon which the people ordinarily reason and the considerations</page><page sequence="13">TAX] WORLD VIEW AND SOCIAL RELATIONS IN GUATEMALA 39 which shape action: you do not buy lumber that was cut in the waxing moon because you know it will rot quickly; you place the skull of a horse in the sheep corral to keep out coyotes; you do not fret at climbing a hill lest the land itself give you a terrible sickness; you try to show no fear when you meet a werewolf, lest it conquer you; you tie a woman's skirt over the horns of a bull to make him tractable; you cover the stump of a felled fruit tree lest it be ashamed before its fellows; you do what you can to avert catas- trophe when a dream augers ill; you know that barbed wire makes a superior fence because while coyotes by verbal agreement pass through other fences, they cannot strike a bargain with barbed wire that, coming from abroad, speaks a different language. But while this complex of beliefs forming a basis of action constitutes a world view of the type we have come to expect in isolated preliterate tribes, the type of social relations of the Guatemalan Indians, as I have indicated, is of a different character. Economic relations tend to be strictly economic, without involving personal relations; money is the standard of value not only in trade but in religious rituals and in gifts prescribed by custom: a feast-day, a baptism, a shamanistic rite, a funeral, or an appoint- ment to office all require expenditures pretty well fixed and anticipated in terms of money. In matters of social control neither public opinion nor familial organization is depended upon as is the formal courthouse organiza- tion where brother may be pitted against brother or father against son. In- deed, almost all matters of religion, community welfare, and social control are taken care of by officials set apart to care for them, while the rest of the people go about their business-business usually in a literal sense because every- body individually tends toward a major interest in trading and a variety of private economic enterprises. To know these Indians outwardly-without knowing their minds, so to speak-is to know a people who, albeit on a small scale, partake of the impersonal, secular, individually-free social and economic life that is the pattern of our big city. This is reflected in the mo- bility of the society-individuals and families rise and fall in their fortunes -as well as in the continual state of flux: for within the fixed pattern, businesses no less than styles change almost as rapidly as they do among us. People move around, go places on business and come back, or move to another town for a few years or for the rest of their lives. Life is filled with dollars-and-cents values, earning money, getting rich, legal documents, mortgaging land, borrowing, lending, witnessing, going to court, and so on. In their social, economic, political and even religious interrelations these people are in significant degree practical, matter-of-fact, mundane, and secular minded.</page><page sequence="14">40 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 43, 1941 However interesting it may be, the case of the Guatemalan Indians is not important simply because they are neither wholly primitive nor wholly civilized. We have come to expect such a condition when a primitive tribe is in contact with modern civilization, and indeed Redfield has very good examples from Yucatan itself. The point is rather that, as has been in- dicated above, the situation in Guatemala is probably not attributable to such acculturation, that we suppose the Guatemalan Indian communities to be in equilibrium in their mixed character. In general the society is not changing rapidly, for although in details many alterations have occurred in the memory of living people, in respect to their kind of life and their values the old people find their young people doing what they did and would want to do. It is also well to recall again that even at the time of the arrival of the Spaniards, there were wide and complex systems of trade, govern- ment and religion, and something of a money economy. If this supposition is correct, we have to deal with a people whose world view is of the primitive type and whose social relations are, and have been for a long time and without regard to influences of Western civilization, of the civilized type. The question immediately arises: Is such a condition anomalous? The Guatemalan situation described would have to be so con- sidered if there were reason to believe that there is a causal relation between a civilized type of social system and a civilized kind of world view-if, specifically, it were supposed that the civilized type of social relations that developed among the Indians of Guatemala should have changed the Indians' world view from its primitive type to the civilized type. If such a causal relationship could be established, we should have to conclude that in Guatemala the world view has simply not been given time enough for its inevitable transformation-that we have only a case of long-time cultural lag. For the existence of such a causal relationship arguments may be of- fered, since widespread trade and governmental relations would appear to be conducive toward wider mental horizons, and since money and the de- velopment of impersonal institutions on a wide scale would seem to lead to wider contacts, cross-fertilization of new ideas, and the divorce of beliefs from restricted milieus. And indeed there seems little doubt that a study of the history of our own civilization would demonstrate that in general "advances" in mental life accompanied periods of widening integration of social and economic institutions. Nevertheless it appears more probable that while a civilized social sys- tem is a likely necessary condition for the development of a civilized world view, it is not a sufficient condition. After all, our civilization and its history are but one case, and such factors as the development of writing and print-</page><page sequence="15">TAX] WORLD VIEW AND SOCIAL RELATIONS IN GUATEMALA 41 ing, and the tradition of philosophy and science that came early into our culture, make it unique. We do have at least two other cases of develop- ments of widespread economic, political, and religious relations presumably independent of our own civilization (the reference is to West Africa and to Middle America), and in both of these cases the prevalent world-view ap- pears to have remained on a primitive level. It may of course be argued still that not enough time was given these world-views to develop, but that would only bring us back to the original proposition that is supported by only one case. On the basis of present evidence it would seem easier to con- clude that a civilized type of world-view does not necessarily develop to- gether with a civilized type of social relations. If that is so, of course there is nothing necessarily peculiar in what we find among the Guatemalan Indians. It may very well be, moreover, that what is defined here as the "civilized world-view" is something that developed only once in the world-in our civilization-and now of course will never be given the chance to develop independently again. I incline to that interpretation and would consider the "civilized world-view" as a culture complex that has developed in our tradi- tion. If such a thesis be acceptable, we may also treat the civilized world- view as we do any other cultural invention, and we can conveniently speak of its diffusion to other peoples. The question arises as to why, considering that the kind of social rela- tions prevalent in Guatemala render it fertile ground for the acceptance of the civilized world view-why this invention has not diffused to the Indians of Guatemala. For generations the Indians have been in contact with urban Ladinos who share the civilized world view, while the higher officials of the government under which they live, and of their church, partake quite fully of civilized culture. Yet the Indians have proved immune, except those few who, educated in our culture, have either forgotten their education or have left the Indian community. That exception probably supplies the clue to the answer. In the nature of the culture complex with which we are dealing, no matter how fertile the ground, the seed to sprout must be given some minimum of attention; and the fact is that the education of the backward Highland Indians in the fundamentals of our mental culture is all but non- existent. It is true that the Indians are not physically isolated; but the sys- tem of impersonal relations is a form of isolation that restricts communica- tion and borrowing. Mentally the Indians are least isolated from other Indians with whom they share the same world view, and next least from rural Ladinos whose world view is almost as primitive, while from the urban Ladinos they are mentally isolated almost completely first by a dif-</page><page sequence="16">42 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 43, 1941 ference in language and second by one of social distance. Their relations with such civilized Ladinos are for the most part perfunctory: they are employes or customers. The priests are few and their non-ceremonial con- tacts confined to people of like culture and status. The high government officials the Indians see only on business, and the kind of business is not usually conducive to cameraderie. The Indians, since their Spanish is poor or non-existent, can profit little by stray conversation of educated people or by bits from the radios they hear in town. Since they cannot read, old newspapers or other reading matter are valued for wrapping purposes only, unless there are pictures. When and if effective education is given the Indians in substantial numbers, and they learn Spanish and become literate, acculturation to the civilized world view will probably go on apace; and then their world view will become of the kind that is more usually associated with the kind of social relations they have so long had. A general implication to be drawn from the distinction made between the world view of a people and their social relations is that it might be profitable to distinguish two kinds of acculturation. In one kind, both our world view and our type of social relations are imposed on native peoples. In the other, only our world view is imposed on a people who have inde- pendently (or previously) developed an analogous kind of social relations. It seems likely that the effects of the contact might be more rapid in the first class of instances, since the imposition of our kind of economic and social system seems to result in rapid breakdown of all aspects of native culture. It may also be that in the second class of instances, where only our world view is substituted for that of the native, there does not result the shaking-to-foundations of societies and cultures that occurs in places like Polynesia.
