<plain_text><page sequence="1">VI.-NEW BOOKS. Towards a Religious Philosophy. By W. G. DE BURGH. London: Macdonald &amp; Evans, 1937. Pp. xix, 260. lOs. net. IT is doubtful whether a philosophical book is best reviewed by one whose close sympathy with its manner of thinking may make him less quick than another to suggest objections and difficulties in dealing with which the author might be led to strengthen his arguments and elucidate his conclusions. The present writer is, however, in this position in regard to the work before us, and the following notice will accordingly be rather an account of its contents than a criticism of the reasonings which it presents. Towards a Religious Philosophy is a collection of twelve essays, several of which have already appeared in various journals, and is intended, as the preface informs us, 'not primarily for academic philosophers, but chiefly in the hope of appealing to the larger public interested in philosophy.' The 'religious philosophy' towards which Prof. de Burgh desires to lead his readers is not a 'philosophy of religion, which may or may not be the expression of religious conviction,' but an ' outlook upon the world and life, which, as philosophy, must be grounded on reason, and, as religion, must be centred in God' (p. v). Such an outlook stands in strong contrast with any abandonment of reason in favour of emotion or desire as the guide of life, while, at the same time it is not content, with the dominant tradition of Roman Catholic thought, on the one hand to claim for the praeambula fidei, such as the affirmation of the existence of God, a demon- strative certainty independent of any specifically religious experience, and, on the other hand, these preliminary positions once secured, to permit reason to interpret indeed, but not to call in question, the dogmatic state- ments which are commended to us by what has been, once for all, accepted as divine authority. Prof. de Burgh defends the claim of revelation to address itself to the rational faculties and so to have the right to be taken into account by philosophers; but he would not have reason abandon its native function of criticism in face of revelation, any more than he would allow that, apart from some measure of religious experience, and therefore of revelation, reason can establish the reality of the object of religious worship. There is, from first to last, a co-operation, or rather a mutual implication, of faith and reason. The spheres of ' natural ' and 'revealed' religion are not cut off from one another as by a hatchet. Without a rudimentary sense of God reason cannot find Him out (some indeed, and those among the most worthy, seem, as Prof. de Burgh notes on page 43, and again on pages 157, 158, to be 'deity-blind '), and He never to the end deprives reason of its birthright of freedom by a revelation of Himself taking the form of sacrosanct affirmations, exempt from its. critical examination. The first essay in the book is entitled ' Logic and Faith '. In it the writer disputes the propriety of limiting the term 'reason' to processes of inference so as to deny the character of 'rationality' both to the intuition of self-evident premises and of the necessity of inferential conclusions,.</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 99 and also to direct experiences-social, moral, o?sthetic, religious-which lie beyond the pale of what is generally called 'logic', though not of 'reason' in the wider sense which the word has borne in the terminology of some of the greatest philosophers. In the case of religion, it is no more irrational to believe in God's existence than to believe in that of one's friends. Neither belief is the result of an inferential process. As men know other men through the experience of social intercourse, so in religious experience 'they find themselves in presence of a reality, and know it to be God in the response that it evokes ' (p. 16). The problem, raised by the claim that religious faith is rational, of the relation of religious to metaphysical knowledge is considered in the two following essays, on ' Metaphysical and Religious Knowledge ' and on 'The Idea of a Religious Philosophy'. The former recognises the auto- nomy of both religion and philosophy, and urges that each must acknow- ledge the other's autonomy. In both ' reason includes faith, and the faith, though different in each, is in each rational' (p. x). 'Religion is the response to God of man's whole personality, and its knowledge is by way of personal acquaintance; it thus differs from metaphysics both in form of apprehension and in the object apprehended.' The essay on ' The Idea of a Religious Philosophy' pursues the same subject. It insists that religion is not merely practical (as Kant and Bradley explicitly held), nor merely emotional (as our Logical Positivists affirm), but gives knowledge; and that 'revelation' and 'faith', which have been supposed to be inconsistent with philosophy, are, as a matter of fact, involved in all knowledge. The distinction between religious knowledge and philosophy would indeed, so Prof. de Burgh holds (with Dante), disappear in a knowledge which should be perfect; but this we must be content to allow that ours, in this life at any rate-in via, as the old phrase went-, can never be. This acquiescence inevitably brings Prof. de Burgh up against philosophers like Spinoza and Gentile, to whose theories of immanence his fourth and fifth essays are devoted. The substance of his criticism of both is that they fail ' to account for the experienced facts of human (and other) individuality' (p. 55). I feel less sure than Prof. de Burgh appears to do that Spinoza, by his doctrine that man's love to God is part of the infinite love with which God loves Himself, has really cancelled, for a higher level of spiritual life, that denial of a reciprocation by God of man's love for him which won indeed the enthusiastic approval of Goethe, but has repelled many religious readers of the Ethics. But our author's judgment that, despite Spinoza's air of finality, his thought at his best has burst through the limitations of his system, is all the more impressive for the obvious fact that the great Jewish philosopher has exercised upon his mind a far stronger attraction that he has, for example, upon that of Prof. Taylor, who has lately been criticising his teaching from a point of view very similar to that defended by Prof. de Burgh in the work before us. With Gentile, the other representative exponent of a thorough-going doctrine of immanence with whom he deals, Prof. de Burgh is less in sympathy; and he effectively presses the question Who, in Gentile's system, thinks ? suggesting that the Italian thinker is exposed, like the medioeval Averroists, to the reductio ad absurdum urged against them by St. Thomas, that, if they were right, Socrates non intelligit. The sixth, seventh, and eighth essays illustrate Prof. de Burgh's con- ception of such a religious philosophy as he would have us attempt, by a discussion of the light it might be found to throw on the important</page><page sequence="3">100 NEW BOOKS. questions of Time, of the World-Order, and of Teleology. On the first of these it is argued that time, as we experience it, implies a non-temporal reality, and that, if the evidence of religious experience be taken into account, though not otherwise (and here our author admits that he is diverging- in the present writer's view, rightly diverging-from the main tradition of Christian thought), this non-temporal reality may be recognised as a ' personal' God, that is to say, a God with whom we may be in a personal relation. As to the world-order, Prof. de Burgh holds (like Prof. Taylor) that only if we call to our aid our religious experience can we obtain an adequate assurance that such an order exists. Nor can even religious experience (he goes on to contend) give us this assurance unless, with St. Bernard, we find in love a conception of God's nature, revealed in that experience, which can be affirmed univocally of God's love towards man and of man's love towards God. With respect to the third problem which, in Prof. de Burgh's opinion, such a religious philosophy as he has in view would serve to illuminate, that of teleology, he recognises the force of the criticism brought by Hume and Kant against the argument from design in its traditional form, but defends the principle which that argument embodies against the charge of anthropomorphism, and argues that 'purposiveness within nature implies purposiveness beyond nature, and this in turn implies an eternal purposing mind' (p. xv). (Incidentally it is remarked in a note on page 133 that Hume's Dialogues-which seem to be distinguished from his 'writings', but perhaps the word 'other' has dropped out of the text-' should be prescribed for study to all students of theology and to all candidates for Ordination '.) The ninth essay deals with the relations of morality to religion. Prof. de Burgh, observing that Kant proclaimed 'once for all the independence of morality upon religion' (p. 154), finds the distinction between the two to rest on the fact that religion 'is not merely practical, but essentially a form of knowledge and that its knowledge is of God' (p. vi). In the three concluding essays he contrasts two kinds of 'humanism' -a 'this-worldly' or 'secular' and an 'other-worldly' or 'theistic'. In the first of the three he points out the unsatisfactoriness of the formula of 'self-realisation' as a description of the chief good for man; in the second he urges that the history of modern thought shows ' secular' humanism to have failed both as a speculative theory and as a working creed, having begun in a 'restricted rationalism' which tended to limit the sphere of reason to the mathematical and physical sciences, and ended in a revolt against reason consequent on the collapse of scientific naturalism brought about by the criticism of the Newtonian physics by the exponents of the principle of relativity; a revolt which can only be met by an ' enlargement of the scope of reason to include intuition and faith ' (p. xviii). An additional note illustrates the conception of another kind of humanism, not secular but theocentric, from the system of St. Thomas Aquinas. Prof. de Burgh, however, is not of those who would go 'back to Aquinas' and repudiate the central tradition of modern philosophy as an aberration -still less of those who would see in Aquinas and Kant two mighty opposites between whom the philosopher must make his choice; on the contrary, he brings out very suggestively an analogy between these two great thinkers. The conclusion of the whole matter, as Prof. de Burgh sees it, is given in a sentence on page 222: 'Think out what it is rational to believe-and you are led to acknowledge religious revelation; think out what is revealed in religion and you find that it is the word of reason'. In the last essay,</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 101 which opens with this remark, we find a strikingly interesting, sympathetic and discriminating study of the mind of contemporary youth towards problems which are yet 'common to men in all ages, though they press on us in forms peculiar to our own time '. ' Only through faith in God and his eternal kingdom can the diversity of this-worldly and of our other- worldly experience be thought in unity, or a sure anchorage be found for individuals and for peoples amid the perplexities of a distracted world' (p. 251). There is a misprint of vero for verae on page 298, and I may perhaps be allowed to mention that the first series of my Gifford Lectures, to which a reference is made on p. 181 n., bears the title God and Personality. CLEMENT C. J. WEBB. Measuring Intelligence. By LEWIS M. TERMAN and MAUD A. MERRILL. London: G. G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd., 1937. Pp. xiv + 461. 10s. 6d. OF all the mental characteristics which the psychologist seeks to measure, 'intelligence' (as it is loosely called) is by far the most important, as it is by far the easiest, to assess. The medical officer certifying the feeble- minded, the local education authority awarding scholarships for higher education, the vocational psychologist giving advice on future occupations, the educational psychologist giving help to the dull and backward, the social psychologist investigating the causes of delinquency or crime-all require some simple and trustworthy criterion for estimating the innate abilities of individual children. And for this purpose, despite its obvious defects, the scale devised by Binet and Simon nearly thirty yea'rs ago remains the standard method. In almost every civilised country these tests have been used; and their very simplicity has often led the practical worker to forget their admitted imperfections. Binet's own standardisation was based on very inadequate data. His age-assignments, for example, were by no means free from criticism. Some of the tests could be solved by the London child two or three years earlier than Binet had believed; and the mere process of translation often changed the difficulty of the problems. Consequently, both in this country and in America, various investigations were at -once attempted in the hope of rendering the scale more accurate. Of the American revisions, that published by Prof. Terman in 1916 was by far the most thorough. It was based on a test of approximately 1000 children. The London revision, carried out independently and about much the same time, was based on 3000. And the results of the two inquiries wer'e in fairly close agreement. Prof. Terman's ' Stanford Revision' was an undoubted improvement on the French version; but further experience has revealed many minor defects which the author himself has been among the first to recognise. Below the age of five the tests were inadequate both in number and in nature. Above the age of eleven the tests were not only too few, but, as a rule, appreciably under-estimated the intelligence of older and brighter children. Many of the tests, too, were later shown to have but little correlation with intelligence: often they were greatly influenced by teaching or coaching; and in several instances the method of marking was so arbitrary as largely to invalidate the results. Ten years ago Prof. Terman took up the problem afresh. With the aid of a small band of trained assistants and with the co-operation of teachers</page><page sequence="5">102 NEW BOOKS. throughout the country a new investigation was planned; and the project received generous financial support from the Social Science Research Council of Stanford University. The new revision is the result of these joint and long-continued labours, and has been eagerly awaited by psychologists in Great Britain and else- where. The compilers began with a systematic survey of all the available -work on intelligence testing, and have apparently endeavoured to incor- porate every type of test that has been shown to have a sound theoretical and practical basis. The rejection or retention of each test has been de- termined by three criteria: (i) 'the validity of the test as a test of intel- ligence', determined ultimately 'by the correlation of each test with the composite total score' ; (ii) 'the ease and the objectivity of the scoring'; (iii) 'various practical considerations, such as economy of time, interest to the child, need for variety, and the like'. The upshot is not one scale but two; and each is twice as comprehensive as its predecessor. Binet's original scale contained 54 tests: each of the new scales contains 129. The provision of an alternative form will largely evade the risks of coaching, and will make it possible to test the same groups of children a second time. One welcome feature of the new revision is the reduction of the verbal element. The new tests for younger children consist largely of problems to be solved with the aid of beads, coloured cubes, diminutive objects, and other materials that appeal to the infant mind. Unfortunately, the special apparatus thus required is costly; and, if the tests are to be widely used in elementary schools, it is to be hoped that the price will subsequently be reduced. As judged by the age-assignments worked out in this country, the American children on whom the first Stanford revision was standardised were a little above the English average in inborn capacity, but a little below in school attainments. For the present revision the investigators have chosen a more representative group drawn from different sections of the community: 3000 boys and girls were tested from eleven different States; and an attempt made to secure a just proportional representation of all the main social and economic classes. The assignment of each test to a given mental age has been based on no single or simple criterion. In English revisions the principle usually followed has been to allocate a test to a given age if 50 per cent. of the children of the age below succeeded in passing it. In theory this should yield 101 as the average mental age of an average group aged ten last birthday. In practice, since the percentages passing are rarely exactly 50 per cent., a good deal of balancing may be required. We are told that this was done empirically; and that six successive readjustments of the age-assignments were required before the average mental age coincided with chronological age. The data incidentally collected by this survey must be a mine of sugges- tive information; and, to the theorist, the most interesting chapter in the book is that which deals with a statistical analysis of the results. A more detailed treatment, we are told, is reserved for a separate publication. The authors propose to make a number of more intensive studies on special problems: the differences between the two sexes, the influence of schooling, the influence of inheritance, and the results of a factor-analysis of the abilities involved, are all to be investigated. Meanwhile, a brief account is given of the conclusions that bear more directly on the validity of the scale. It is shown that, when measured in terms of the ' mental ratio' or ' I.Q.', the standard deviation with both scales is approximately constant from</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 103 age two to age eighteen. This justifies the use of the ratio or quotient as a measure of innate capacity. On the I.Q. scale the average standard deviation proves to be about 17 points. This is rather higher than that obtained in earlier surveys; but a better test always yields a wider scatter, and it has long been suspected that the amount of individual variability within the total population has been under-estimated. The new figure, if confirmed, will be of great practical significance. If we assume that intelligence is distributed in accordance with the normal curve, it implies that 4 per cent. of the school population would be ad- judged mentally defective according to the borderline commonly accepted in this country. In my view it is doubtful whether exact normal distribution can be safely assumed: but the empirical distribution given by Terman's own charts still reveals, even in the town populations, an unexpectedly high proportion at the lower tail-end. The greater part of the present volume gives instructions for administer- ing the two scales and for scoring the child's performance. From the note to the English edition it would appear that, with Prof. Terman's approval, a number of verbal alterations have been made to adapt the instructions for workers in this country. Even so, however, many diffi- culties remain which only a systematic study by experimental methods can hope to eliminate. The most obvious defects are the Americanisms which are still left in the injunctions to be recited to the child. In the test containing the familiar story of a man who saw in a wood the body of a man 'who had been lynched', the London child may have some difficulty in guessing what is meant by 'hanging from the limb of a tree '. In the 'tests of comprehension' the Londoner might be tempted to interpret the phrase 'on the streets' rather differently from the American. In general, however, the wording of the old tests has been much improved; and the new tests greatly enhance the value of the scale. One or two, it is true, seem open to criticism. The eight-year-old child is asked, ' What makes a sailing boat move ?' The ability to give the right answer must surely in part depend on the child's familiarity with sailing boats. The nine- year-old child is asked why the following statement is foolish: 'Bill Jones' feet are so big that he has to pull his trousers on over his head'. How many adults could give the explanation required ? Plans have already been proposed for a co-operative study of the new revision with a view to making it as valuable in Great Britain as it un- doubtedly will be in America. In the past much injustice has been done by those who have assumed that a scale of tests standardised in one country could be forthwith adopted in another. The original Stanford revision was at first widely used by school medical officers without modification, despite the fact that it was far too severe for English children: with Terman's own consent an English revision was prepared, and has long been in private use at most psychological clinics. It is to be urgently hoped that a similar restandardisation will be attempted for the present scale. All who are engaged in intelligence-testing-whether teachers, doctors, or psychologists-will feel an immense debt of gratitude to Prof. Terman and his colleagues for their long and arduous research, and will be eager to congratulate them on the success with which they have managed to combine the requirements of a serviceable scale with the de- mands of scientific precision. CYRIL BURT.</page><page sequence="7">104 NEW BOOKS. Hume's Theory of Knowledge: A Critical Examination. By CONSTANCE MAUND. London: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1937. Pp. xxi + 310. 12s. 6d. COMMENTATORS and critics have presented Hume's philosophy in various guises. He is called, and he called himself, a sceptic. He is called a phenomenalist, an empiricist a outrance. He is sometimes regarded as a penitent rationalist, in spite of all. Mrs. Maund regards him as an epistemo- logist, and a pioneer in that branch of philosophy in a sense in which not even Locke was a pioneer. Some of this epistemology, she admits, is imputed rather than discoverable. " I shall try to avoid [certain] difficulties ", she says, " by taking Hume's epistemology to be not simply what he states it to be, but the theory implied by his procedure in relation to this statement. Thus, despite the fact that his statement is inadequate, I hope to show that some of his arguments do provide a contribution to that distinct branch of inquiry which is concerned with the investigation of the different mental processes in relation to their objects and with the nature, and perhaps also the validity, of these different objects." These remarks give a fair statement of Mrs. Maund's programme, and her book has the merits of careful analysis in a very high degree. She has also the necessary equipment, including a sound and ample textual ac- quaintance with the Treatise and Enquiry. A question may, however, be made whether Mrs. Maund's programme is not anachronistic and in ways misleading. Should there not be some difference in the methods appropriate to the cross-examination of a contemporary and those ap- propriate to a cross-examination after a couple of centuries ? Are there not some disadvantages in asking a defunct philosopher to answer other people's questions when he himself was trying to answer his own ? What Mrs. Maund means by an epistemological question is very well conveyed by her term " accusative "-the " accusatives " of perceiving, conceiving, believing, and the like. She admits, quite frankly, however, (p. 282) that Hume " had no clear conception of an accusative ". There- fore he had no clear idea of epistemology in Mrs. Maund's sense. There- fore his " epistemology " was largely unwitting, although he may have had a vivid and almost prophetic interest in the sort of question that Mrs. Maund persists in putting to him. Mrs. Maund's way of gathering honey may be very good. It is one of the uses to which the history of philosophy may be put; but it it scarcely an account and scarcely a criticism of Hume's "theory of knowledge " (unless " theory of knowledge " = epistemology = what Mrs. Maund understands by that term). Hume himself wanted a theory of knowledge that would give him entrance into the citadel of human nature and so enable him at his leisure to develop all the human sciences. (Maundian) epistemology per se could, not do the business, how- ever great Hume's predilection for that sort of discussion. Mrs. Maund has pursued her inquiries with so much zeal and patience that all students and lovers of Hume (among whom I should like to reckon myself still) are very much in her debt. These inquiries are often very detailed, and therefore I am sorry to argue generally about her book. They also, through a proper determination to stick to her method, treat slightly (or at least briefly) what Hume discusses at length, e.g. causality and self-hood. (On the other hand, her method permits her to be expansive about Hume's scepticism, with great advantage to the volume.) I cannot help thinking, however, that the boundaries between criticism and ex- position tend to be confused in her discussion, and that she sometimes denies what is quite obviously true.</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 105 Consider, for instance, her discussion of concept accusatives. Here she has to face Hume's denial of abstract ideas (in various senses) and his attempt to undermine the so-called distinctio rationis between, e.g., colour and shape. Her argument in general is that since it is perfectly clear that a concept-accusative is not a perception-accusative (in Hume's sense of "perception") and since Hume, ambulando, makes various statements that would be unintelligible if a concept-accusative were a perception- accusative, therefore he must be held to have maintained that there are concepts that are neither impressions nor ideas. But surely he tried his hardest to dispense with them, and, in his most explicit argument-the note on pp. 96-97 of Selby-Bigge's edition of the Treatise-the last sentence plainly interprets a concept as an idea that may acquire an almost impressionistic vivacity. A Maundian concept-accusative could not con- ceivably masquerade as an impression. Take, again, belief. It may be clear in itself that belief attaches to pro- positions, and Hume's argument may require proposition-accusatives when he refers to future or to " external " existence. What he usually maintains, however, is that belief applies to impressions and ideas, and is a certain indefinable " manner " of accepting (a) impressions of the senses and memory, (b) any ideas causally associated therewith. There is no idea or impression of reality or existence. There is just a real-feeling " percep- tion ". Whatever the defect of Hume's analysis may be, that does appear to be his view about the " judgments " that " people the world ". So much for confusion of boundaries; now for denying what is patently true. I shall remark upon a pair of statements, both of importance, and each, as it seems to me, quite indefensible. On page 165 we read:-" It would be the greatest mistake to suppose that Hume wanted to deny the existence of any accusative which either philosophers or plain men suppose themselves to experience. In Hume's investigation there is no place as to whether there is or is not a certain accusative. If there is anything about which any question can be asked, then ipso facto there is that accusative." The reference here is to " ab- stract or general ideas ", but the statement does not stand alone, and it is plainly inaccurate. Consider for instance what Hume says about the Self. " There are some philosophers who imagine we are every moment conscious of what we call our Self. . . . Unluckily all these positive assertions are contrary to that very experience which is pleaded for them, nor have we any idea of self, after the manner it is here explained. For from what impression could this idea be derived ? . .. It must be some one impression that gives rise to every real idea. But self or person is not any one impression . . . and consequently there is no such idea." It is true that Hume goes on to explain the "feigned " identity of personality, and finds something in experience to suggest that fiction; but he never maintained that what philosophers or plain men supposed was in con- sequence necessarily a " real idea ", and he never denied that questions could be raised about unintelligible chimaeras like the " substance " of metaphysicians. There were plenty of words about which people disputed when there was no genuine " accusative " in the case. In the above quotation the question " From what impression could this idea be derived ? " is plainly vital. That question is what Reid called Hume's " articles of inquisition ", and the question is equally prominent (as Mrs. Maund herself admits) in Hume's attempt to discover a basis for the Idea of necessary causal connection. Yet Mrs. Maund says (p. 210)</page><page sequence="9">106 NEW BOOKS. that the " principle of the Inquisition was Reid's inventio4 and has no application at all in Hume's philosophy ". I may perhaps be expected to say something on a point regarding which Mrs. Maund criticises Stout and myself, viz., the irrelevance of our view that for Hume ideas had frequently to be " ideas of " or representatives known to be such. According to Mrs. Maund, Hume simply meant to assert the neutral proposition that ideas de facto were derived from and similar to impressions. I am anxious to confess my faults, but I find Mrs. Maund's statements unconvincing, although I find what she says about the reference in memory (p. 162) yery acute. I cannot see, for instance, how she could explain a passage she herself quotes on page 115: " As every idea is derived from a preceding perception, 'tis impossible our idea of a perception, and that of an object or external existence can ever represent what are specificallv different from each other ". Again in the Enquiry (which Mrs. MaLnd regards as more authoritative and more clear- headedly " epistemological " than the Treatise) we read at the very opening of the serious discussion in Section II, that "impression " means " all our more lively perceptions " and that " ideas" are " the less lively per- ceptions of which we are conscious when we reflect [my italics] on any of those sensations or movements [i.e. impressions] above mentioned ". Again, in the next paragraph but one we read, " When we think of a golden mountain we only join two consistent ideas, gold and mountain, with which we were formerly acquainted ". I hope, however, that I have made it plain ohat I consider Mrs. Maund's book a very valuable contribution to the growing bulk of recent discussions upon Hume. JOHN LAIRD. John Locke. By R. I. AARON. Oxford: University Press, 1937. Pp. xii + 328. 12s. 6d. IT is odd that this latest volume of the Leaders of Philosophy series is the first comprehensive work in English on Locke since Fraser's small book of 1890. Except when we have wanted help on the Essay alone, for which Gibson's fine study (1917) has been invaluable, we have had to be content with Fraser, Fowler's volume in the English Men of Letters series (1880), and the biographies by Lord King (1829) and Fox Bourne (1876). If in consequence we have read Locke's own writings more than writings on them, the exiguity of the latter has been an advantage. The most English of English philosophers has certainly not been written about excessively in his own country, even when we include in the account books and articles on particular topics. Even the tercentenary of Locke's birth evoked here only four printed lectures-one given by Gibson before the British Academy, Prof. Kemp Smith's " Adamson Lecture ", and the two delivered by Prof. Stocks and Mr. Ryle at the commemorative meeting in Oxford. Prof. Aaron's book, long awaited, is therefore all the more welcome. For it and his recent discovery and publication of the first draft of the Essay, every student of Locke will be grateful. My only regret is that the limits imposed by the need of uniformity in volumes in a series have prevented him from expressing more fully his long study of such papers in the Lovelace Collection as have not been utilised by anyone before him: his use of the unpublished material has had to be severely restrained. On page 54 he mentions that among the Lovelace papers</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS. 107 there is a list of the books in Locke's librarv at the time of his death. Would it not be worth while to have this printed ? The book opens with a clear and well-pruned sketch of Locke's life, followed immediately by an account, critical as well as expository, of the Essay, occupying nearly two-thirds of the book. Then come three chapters on Locke's views on morals, politics, education and religion, and an all too brief " Conclusion ". The length having been externally dictated, any consideration of Locke's opinions on economic matters has had to be omitted. A selective but sufficient bibliography has been appended, and there are indexes of subjects and names. Throughout the matter has been ordered and expounded with a quiet and easy competence and with a singularly clear style which avoids both rhetoric and the new jargon of aggressive precision. The author has been content to give us what is now none too common, a perfectly workmanlike piece of writing, wholly determined by the desire to present not himself but his subject and cleared of the scaffolding of research. The costly trifles he must have acquired in his long hunting have been firmly kept in his drawer. The book, besides its usefulness to those of us who want to know not simply what to teach but also how to teach it, should be ideal f or Honours students and f or the general reader intelligently interested in the history of philosophy. A long note on " How the Essay was written " (pp. 54-59) effects a natural transition from the biographical to the philosophical part. On the growth of Locke's views we now have much information at hand-the earliest draf t of the Essay, together with relevant extracts f rom the journals, published last year by Prof. Aaron himself in collaboration with Mr. Gibb; the second draft, published by Rand in 1931; Locke's own epitome, published in translation in 1688 in Le Clerc's Bibliotheque Universelle and, from Locke's English manuscript, in Lord King's Life and Letters of Locke; and the changes in the several editions of the Essay itself, noted in Fraser's recension of the text. Through all these and through the manuscript sources Prof. Aaron threads his way with ease, and shows that some of Locke's obscurities and inconsistencies become at any rate understandable when they are approached genetically. Locke's very scanty treatment of ideas of reflection, for example, is partly explained when we learn that the subject was an afterthought, having no place in either of the two drafts (p. 120); and his difficulty in bringing ideas into their rightful classes is illustrated (p. 102) from the change made in the fourth edition, where relations and universals are for the first time regarded as distinct classes instead of as species of complex ideas. The distinction of all ideas into simple and complex revealed its own inadequacy. On the question what the chief influences were on Locke, the author stresses most Boyle and Gassendi. That, on the side of science, we must adduce Boyle instead of Newton, would be approved by anyone familiar with the biographical facts. Whether the emphasis on Gassendi is right or not I cannot claim competence to pronounce, since my first-hand knowledge of him is confined to his objections to Descartes' Meditations, objections which suggest to me that he was a better philosopher than Descartes, and might with advantage to ourselves be given a bigger place in our curricula than his much overrated fellow-countryman. Descartes' relation to Locke, says Prof. Aaron, was "primarily that of liberator rather than teacher. . . . When, as the result of his Oxford training, he had lost faith in philosophy, his reading of Descartes restored it " (p. 9). It is certainly refreshing to be told to look outside England for the source, or at least the armoury, of Locke's empiricism, to be asked to see Locke, as</page><page sequence="11">108 NEW BOOKS. Leibniz saw him (Aaron quotes aptly on p. 34 from the Nouveaux Essais), as a member of the small Gassendist opposition to Cartesianism. I hope the injunction will be examined, and that the examination will recover Gassendi from neglect and draw attention to G. S. Brett's solitary and forgotten, indeed scarcely ever noticed, Philosophy of Gassendi (1908). In his emphasis on Gassendi, Prof. Aaron is wishing to underline Locke's empiricism, which recent emphasis on the rationalistic strain has tended to depreciate. While admitting the rationalism of Book IV (knowledge as intuition and demonstration), he refuses to let us forget that the whole point of Book II is to exhibit the empirical origin of all our ideas, and he rightly refers some of the exegetical problems of this book to Locke's occasional straying from his main purpose into side-issues. Indeed, he declares (p. 104) that Locke's empiricism is deeper than, and independent of, the representationism, and in this I am sure he is right; and right also in saying that nevertheless Locke was not a nominalist-though I doubt if there ever was a nominalist in the sense in which this term is usually understood. It was, of course, Locke's empiricist zeal that led to the tedious chapters on innate ideas. On these chapters Prof. Aaron is com- mendably blunt: " Book I is badly written. . . . One or two brief para- graphs would have sufficed " (pp. 82 f.). The ambiguities and shortcomings of Locke's representationism are well brought out. Ideas of reflection, for instance, seem to be conceived realis- tically; and the final assertion of the reality of physical qualities at the time when they are being perceived implies (since'it is never argumenta- tively justified) a dropping of the representative view even of sensa. One must admit Prof. Aaron's criticism that Locke leaves us puzzled about what is usually called the metaphysical status of sensa, though I know no writer who does not. Mathematical ideas are exempted from any repre- sentative office, but are not treated under the heading of universals. The author's discovery of three theories of the nature of universals in the Essay (pp. 195-200) constitutes a very interesting criticism of Locke's weakness at a vital point of his philosophy, and leads one to speculate what would have happened if Locke had inquired into the empirical origin of the idea of logical necessity. A clearer view of the nature of universals would probably have enabled him to obviate Prof. Aaron's censure of his feeble account of numbers (p. 160)-except the censure that the series of whole numbers begins " not with 1 but with 0 ", for from zero alone, without an operational rule which includes the material idea of a unit, I do not see how anything at all can be got. It will be clear that Prof. Aaron is not blind to the weaknesses of the thinker whom he has studied so closely. He never writes as a supporter or apologist. But he concludes that Locke, with all the unclearness, inconsistency and incompleteness that-twenty years of work on the Essay still left, remains the great figure we always thought him to be; for, besides. his positive contributions on special points, he has the general merit that, more than anyone else in this country, he started that deep questioning of tacit assumptions with which philosophy renews itself after a period of decadence. " In this connection ", Prof. Aaron adds with perfect truth " much of the credit which has gone to Hume really belongs to Locke" (p. 307). T. E. JESSoP.</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 109 Sinn und Geschichte, historisch-systematische Einleitung in die Sinn- erforschende Philosophie. Von PAUL HOFMANN. Verlag von Ernst Reinhardt in Munchen, 1937. Pp. 712. RM. 23. THIs work claims to provide a new and fundamental basis for philosophic Weltanschauung in general; and it certainly contains a very fascinating discussion of one of the cardinal problems of philosophy, besides being of high value as a piece of research. Paul Hofmann emphasises throughout his long book the marked difference existing between the " Ich-bezeich- netem Ich " and the " Ich-sagendem Ich ". That is to say, there must be most careful discrimination between the "ego" which can be observed and investigated as a kind of object among other objects and that " I " which alone is truly able to say " I ", which we need if we are to observe at all and which can never itself be observed. Of course we may try to observe and to describe even this " subjective I " ; but in that case it no longer remains the " Ich-sagende Ich ", but it becomes an object and we have another new " I " observing and recognising the first one. We may even continue this process and think of the second one; and thus we may speak here, to use Hofmann's expression, of a possible infinite " springing back " of the " Ich-sagenden Ich ", just as we can speak correspondingly of a possible " leaping back " of the object, the thing in itself, because every object in itself, after thought has been directed towards it, leads on to the assumption of another new object in itself lying beyond it. In other words, there exists in all thought, feeling and action a fundamental correlation of " I " and object, the poles of which are connected as well as separated by a possible infinity of iterations (see pp. 490, 25 ff., 3 ff.). Yet, whilst such a doctrine may already be found in Kant and in Cohen's Neokantianism (see pp. 607, 457, 274 ff.), Hofmann is specially concerned with a much more detailed analysis of the " I " and its relation to meaning, to sense (Sinn) in general. He therefore develops here only his view of the " Ich-sagenden Ich " as able to become conscious of (" spuiren ") meaning, Sinn; and suggests that as there are certain categories of the knowledge of objects which are the " transcendental " conditions of this knowledge, so there are to be found " introscendental " presuppositions of " Sinn " (p. 198). Whilst we need relatively " subjective ", transcendental concepts (such as unity or relation or the like) for the understanding of the multitude of objects of the outside-world, we need relatively " objective " " Sinnbilder ", that is symbolic pictures, as introscendental conditions for the shaping of the meaning which " lives " and can be experienced in our " Ich-sagendem Ich " (pp. 160 f., 48 ff.). For these reasons "I" and " Sinn " or meaning can never be thought of as existing objects or attri- butes of objects; on the contrary, they are only that element of con- sciousness or action which within consciousness and action is connected with the " other ", the object; but which is in strictest contrast to this " other ", to all objects and to any kind of existence at all. The cardinal contrast to existence is therefore not non-existence or nothing, as all " objectivism" hitherto wrongly assumed, but it is the " Ich-sagende Ich ", " Sinn" whose meaning " lives " in quite another sphere than the sphere of existence (21 f., 25). And according to Hofmann even the logical principles which apply within this " sphere of Sinn " are other than those applying to the thought of objects and things: instead of the axiom of excluded contradiction we have here to deal with the axiom of " included contrast " (within the whole structure of Sinn) consisting of the " Ich- sagenden Ich " and the " other ", the object thought by this Ich. Instead</page><page sequence="13">110 NEW BOOKS. of the principle of excluded middle, we find in the logic of " Sinn " the principle of the " inclusion of distinguished aspects" (" eingeschlossener Gesichtspunkt der Unterscheidung der Momente "). Lastly, to the principle of sufficient reason of the " Sachlogik " there corresponds in the " Sinulogik " the principle of the " Sinn-Ziel " of knowledge, according to which the whole of the sense represents the reason, and an example having sense is the consequence in which the interpretation of the meaning of the whole is to be found; for instance, the single and unchanging meaning of a juristic law is interpreted by the decisions taken under it (202, 162). At any rate " Sinn" for Hofmann remains bound specifically to the " Ich- sagendem Ich " from which alone "objective" laws or judgments can receive their meaning; and even the " Ich-bezeichnete Ich " is in com- parison with it a kind of object, although this " Ich-bezeichnete Ich " is, on the other hand, identified with the " Ich-sagendem Ich " which has here, so to speak, divided itself into the proper Ich and a " first Thou ", namely, the " Ich-bezeichnete Ich " (505, 454). The second " Thou" then consists of my ideas of objects as persons animated by my " Ich- sagendem Ich "; therefore the " Thou " could be characterised as the animated " It " in the " I " as well as the " I " in the " It " (507, 505); for here the being an object is the fundamental point and the animation by an " I " is a merely accessory one (585). Finally, within the proper " Ich ", or more precisely within the " Sinn ", a distinction has to be made between the mere " form " and the " matter " of Sinn (586 f .. But Hofmann has not contented himself with these and other similar analyses concerning Sinn which are scattered throughout his work. He has tried also to erect upon this " Sinnforschung " a new Weltanschauung which he calls occasionally the philosophy of " Sinnbewusster Existenz " (682, 680); and here, indeed, I cannot follow him. First, I think that the stress laid on the importance of the " Ich-sagenden Ich " does not represent such an original idea as is here assumed. For instance, the similarity of this research with several tendencies of Emil Lask or with the first drafts of Fichte's Wissenschaftslehre is in characteristic points much more remarkable than would be supposed from Hofmann's interpretation of Fichte as an " objectivist " (248, 343). Secondly, I believe that it is impossible to demonstrate-as Hofmann tries to do-that the whole history of Philosophy or human thought has altogether failed hitherto, because it has been too" objectivistic ". My studiesinromantic philosophy (1927) led me, for example, to quite opposite results as regards the so-called " romantic universalism " (665) ; and no historian of philosophy will be able to agree with Hofmann on many others of his wide historical generalisa- tions. Thirdly and decisively, it seems to me clearly impossible to draw from the merely formal character of the " Ich-sagenden Ich " such definitely " material " consequences as the identification of this " I " with " love " and with the will to the most concrete self-realisation. (Again Hofmann's polemic against Nietzsche (414, 512 f., 493), is here in my view not convincing.) And it is surely unsatisfactory to solve the problems of the " inter-objective " and the " inter-individual " validity of " Sinn" in such a relatively simple and formalistic way as is done by Hofmann (see pp. 666, 498 f., 474, 501, 578). Indeed, Hofmann has to confess several times that he cannot deal with casuistry, but only with fundamental problems (606, 501). On many points, however, questions which are for Hofmann notfundamental, confront us with the mostdecisive moral conflicts of our day, which can never be solved with the help of his analyses, although he is convinced they can. Unfortunately, it seems only too optimistic</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS. 111 when Hofmann writes: " Ich darf . . . gewisz sein, dass die . . . tiefsten tYberzeugungen und Zwecksetzungen,' die ich dem Gebote der Wahrhaftig- keit gemdss in mir selbst zu erkennen strebe, fuir jedes m6gliche Du . wahr sind" (683). On the contrary, I think it can scarcely be denied that with the recognition of the same formal " Ich " and the same formal " honesty " by no means the same concrete material decisions on " Sinn " need necessarily be connected, but it may be quite contrary ones such as a " material " ethics of power or an ethics of love. Moreover there are to be found in Hofmann thorough-going confusions between merely formal and " most material " conceptions of " Sinn ", just such " ingenious confusions " as appear in the corresponding passages of Kant's Kritik der praktischen Vernunft and of Fichte's Wissenschaftslehre of 1794 and Sittenlehre of 1798. I tried in my book, Der Kampf urn den. Lebenssinn unter den Vorldufern der modernen Ethik (1933), to clear up in detail these most instructive paralogisms, and I shall not deal with them here. Nevertheless, I believe that Hofmann's energetic attempt to revive in modern terminology an extreme ethics of pure intention is to a large extent an illuminating experiment-more particularly as he proposes to supplement his research later on. This continuation we may await with interest. DAVID BATUMGARDT. Surprise and the Psycho-Analyst: On the Conjecture and Comprehension of Unconscious Processes. By THEODOR REIK, translated by MARGARET M. GREEN. London: Kegal Paul, 1936. Pp. viii + 294. 12s. 6d. DR. REIK'S book is very suggestive. He describes with ample illustration a psycho-analyst's introspections and how they may be interpreted; he raises questions that are important both for philosophers a,nd psychologists, without, however, claiming to offer complete solutions. Though it is not an outstanding work, the author does well to recognise certain problems; but unfortunately the material is not well handled and grouped. The English, edition is very poorly got up and printed; the translation as re- gards style is never more than mediocre, and as regards accuracy is some- times unclear or ambiguous where the German was quite clear-a more literal translation might have been stronger and clearer. For example, one sentence at the top of page 3 and another five lines from the bottom of page 113 need to be turned differently; on page 94, line 5, for less read not so much, on page 97, line 18, for any read every. The paper wrapper gives a misleading account of the book, for it gives the impression that the work is chiefly about telepathy. Dr. Reik does treat telepathy seriously, but he does not make more than half-a-dozen references to it; for he regards it as a particular case of a more general situation, and he does not think that the material at our disposal is as yet, adequate for dealing with it. The general theme may be divided up as follows: (1) conjecturing unconscious process in others, (2) comprehending unconscious process in others, and (3) the close connection between these activities, which we may call unconscious perception, and the phenomena of surprise and laughter. Very probably such a grouping is an over-simplification, but as a rough guide it may serve. We may say that the apparently heterogeneous collection of chapters all describe aspects of conjecture, that the chief</page><page sequence="15">112 NEW BOOKS. concept used to explain or describe it is surprise, and that comprehension is regarded as the goal of conjecture made complete. The book is therefore essentially a descriptive one whose theme is the psychological process by which the analyst conjectures what is passing in the unconscious of his patient. Tiny signals of which we are unaware form the key to a person's mind: "We perceive peculiarities in the features and bearing and movements of others, which help to make the impression we receive without our observing or attending to them. We remember details of another person's dress and peculiarities in his gestures, without recalling them; a number of minor points, an olfactory nuance, a sense of touch in shaking hands too slight to be observed-warmth, clamminess, roughness or smoothness in the skin, play a part-the manner in which he glances up or looks: of all this we are not consciously aware, and yet it influences our opinion." He cites how insects and animals have sense functions that we no longer possess, and suggests that these may have left traces that modify our behaviour although they are unknown to us. " Originally most likely it really was first and foremost man's bodily surface, the skin, that showed what was going on within." " The self-betrayal of another is sucked in through all our pores." On such data unconscious inferences are based. It is clear that all this depends upon unconscious perception and the existence of an unconscious that can be rendered accessible, both for patient and analyst, i.e., upon the analyst's interpretations' being objective and not figments of his imagination-" The analyst can be made responsible for the supposedly absurd or inane content of his interpretation exactly as much and as justly as an Egyptologist for the content of a hieroglyphic text that he deciphers." The only satisfactory guarantee of this, Dr. Reik admits, lies in making correct predictions. There is, however, an important feature of analysis over and above those possessed by, say, physics, namely, its heuristic side; therapy is effected only when the case is comprehended by the patient, i.e., when the theory is seen in the facts. The author skilfully compares the investigation of a crime with an analysis: conjecturing is similar to detecting, and comprehension to judging; logical processes are out of place while conjecturing or in de- tecting, but in place when comprehending or judging. " Just as in criminology people long failed to realise the importance of guarding the traces on the scene of the crime from unskilful or careless hands, of pre- serving small indications of apparently minor significance for subsequent examination and use, so the art of analysis will pay increasing attention to the fleeting, barely noticeable impressions which we generally overlook or fail to capture. . . . In the psychology of the unconscious, too, it is very important to 'preserve the traces '." There is ample material here for a philosophical inquiry of an epistemo- logical character; and the subject should prove of considerable philoso- phical importance. Whatever philosophy has been implied by the physics of recent years has come up for discussion from time to time; and it is surprising that the same has not taken place in the mental field, where achievements have been no less great. There is much to be sifted in the philosophical aspects of Freud's Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Totem and Taboo, and of the work here reviewed. It may be that greater technical knowledge is required for the discussion of mental phenomena than of physical. The book may be recommended as containing some excellent ideas off -the beaten track. I have space to mention but one of these that concerns</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS. 113 research in many fields in addition to that of psycho-analysis. This is the conception of poised attention, which implies that the analyst is alert and receptive, ready to spring in any direction, rather than deliberately and consciously attentive to every available piece of datum; any train of thought may be pursued, no matter how illogical it may appear-in fact many a good clue would be lost if logic were followed too closely-it is a case of saying "What ideas occur to me ? " rather than " What ideas can I deduce ?" J. 0. WISDOM. A Creed for Sceptics. By C. A. STRONG, LL.D. London: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1936. Pp. ix + 98. 6s. net. THis book consists of five chapters. The first two are mainly concerned with stating and defending a theory of perception. In the third, which is written in French, a philosophy of nature is developed. Most of the fourth chapter is occupied by a translation of a dialogue by Voltaire about free- will. The last chapter is that from which the book takes its title. The author also inserts two poems of his own composition which bear upon the theses of the book. The theory of perception is that previously defended by the author in his Essays on the Natural Origin of the Mind. According to this theory sense data (or " phantasms " as Dr. Strong prefers to call them) are apparent entities which essentially refer to the objects which they depict. Hence phenomenalism, which makes the mistake of regarding sense data as substantial entities, is false. The function of sense data is to enable the percipient to adjust himself to objects with which he has practical concern. An unusual feature of this theory is the view that in internal perception " there is the same duality of datum and object as in external " (p. 3). Dr. Strong boldly maintains that time is composed of indivisible instants and space of indivisible points. The separate instants of time are bound together because the earlier ones produce, engender or create the later. Because instants are the ultimate constituents of time, events are derivative. The points of space are occupied by energies or powers which exist at instants and engender those that succeed. These basic constituents of the world are, for various reasons, held to be animated. This is not to say that they are conscious, but that they possess that sort of blind vitality which is called sensation or sentience. Were this not so, Dr. Strong argues, it would be difficult to see how minds could have evolved. In the last chapter, which is very brief, the author indicates the bearing of these theories upon his attitude towards the world. By implication, if not explicitly, he rejects theism. The non-human world is indifferent to human aspirations. This does not mean, however, that moral distinctions are devoid of an objective basis. They are based upon the nature of human instincts and the necessity of living together. " The fixity of human willing supplies a standard as valid and changeless as could be desired " (p. 97). However strange some of these conclusions may seem, the arguments leading up to them are neatly compressed and-clearly stated. But it was almost certainly a mistake to include the poems. H. B. AcToN. 8</page><page sequence="17">114 NEW BOOKS. Einleitung in die Philosophie. Von MAx DEssoIR. Stuttgart: Ferdinand Enke Verlag, 1936. Pp. xi + 248. THIs book ranks high for two reasons at least. it is written by the leading aesthetic thinker of Germany; and its author has probably introduced more students to philosophy than any other living University teacher in his country. As the title of his book indicates, Dessoir does not here want to solve problems any more than he wants to give detailed discussions ; he only wishes to give a vivid account of the different functions philosophy had once to fulfil, and has still to achieve in our day, illustrating this most instructively on specially important points throughout the whole of the systematic field and the history of philosophic thought. He starts with the fact that during the early Middle Ages, people who were only able to read and to write were occasionally honoured by the name of " philosophers ", whilst in Cicero (Tusc. Quaest.) and in the ancient world in general philosophy was understood to be " vitae dux ", and in Shakespeare's Borneo and Juliet (III, 3) to be " adversity's sweet milk ". Dessoir then proceeds to discuss the problems of " Metatheoretik" and of truth in general, and clears up drastically the major complications existing there by demonstrating the defects of radical relativism in respect of objective truth, that is to say, the shortcomings of radical " historicism ", biological relativism and " psychologism ". Historicism, for instance, acknowledges truth only as valid in a special epoch, but does not admit any universally objective science; and Dessoir grants that it is important to understand how special beliefs are only significant for, and are even true only at, a certain stage in the development of mankind, that is, only in a special historical atmosphere. But all the same, he urges, even the power of time has its limits. There is indepen- dently valid truth in every phase of history; and consistent historicism itself has finally to grant that it is according to its own doctrine not absolutely true, but only a characteristic expression of an epoch of par- ticular intellectual uncertainty. And corresponding arguments can be used against biological relativism attributing to every race or nation different ideals of truth which exclude each other. The mere fact that the most heterogeneous races and peoples can often understand each other best confutes all such radical relativism. And lastly the so-called radical psychologism implies a similar prejudice. For as Dessoir shows, again very briefly but convincingly, it is impossible to reduce all questions of knowledge to mere questions of psychology. Certainly the sense of truth (das Wahrheitsgefiihl) is a psychological fact, but this is not the case with regard to the objective truth of what is meant by our thought if we " feel " that this thought is true. Even the knowledge of stars is communicated by mental perceptions; nevertheless astronomy can not be merged into psychology. In a short survey of the whole history of philosophy from Thales down to the present day Dessoir tries further to demonstrate how helpful, and to a certain extent how indispensable, is the knowledge of the history of thought even for the most original intellects of our day; and then with a brief summary of the relations between philosophy and mathematics, natural sciences, " Kulturwissenschaften " and religion the small volume finishes. Readers approaching the book from the side of science and logic may regret that too many problems are here touched upon with no attempt at penetrating exposition, but artists and " Geisteswissenschaftler " foregoing this and wishing to have a concentrated glimpse of the whole</page><page sequence="18">NEW BOOKS. 115 breadth and wealth of human thought will scarcely find a better introduc- tion to philosophy than this small book, the work of a rcal artist and of one of the most cultivated thinkers of our age, intimately connected by personal friendship with almost all essential movements of the intellectual life of Germany during the last fifty years. DAVID BAUMGARDT. The Credibility of the Christian Faith. By H. S. SHELTON. London, Simpkin Marshall, Ltd., 1937. Pp. 291. 8s. 6d. THE subject of Mr. Shelton's book is, as it could hardly help being, less wide than its title. Mr. Shelton sees that his problem requires the con- sideration of alternatives, that the credibility of the Christian religion must mean its credibility as compared with that of other possible religions and philosophies. In fact, however, Mr. Shelton is chiefly concerned with the dilemma, Roman Catholicism or, naturalistic agnosticism; "for a truly rational position we must choose between Rationalism and Rome ". Broad Church Christianity he regards as a compromise, orthodox Pro- testantism as without intellectual foundation -Calvinism is barely mentioned-and the Greek and Anglican positions as fatally weakened by their lack of a Pope. Admittedly only a few words are given to other religions, on the ground that they are without practical importance for Mr. Shelton or his readers; and non-Christian philosophies, with the exception of Agnosticism, do not come off better. Mr. Shelton argues that, since natural reason, based on the argument from design, points to God, and since neither revelation nor miracles are impossible, the Catholic faith is defensible without accepting either the inerrancy of the Bible or of the moral teaching of Jesus. In setting out the Catholic position, Mr. Shelton a little forgets that his argument from design did not point to a God with the needful moral, or even metaphysical, attributes. He is deeply impressed by the Catholic claim to divine authority embodied in a living representative. Catholic morals, if in some respects open to objection, for example as regards religious persecution, he thinks in others to be superior to current beliefs. New religions and new prophets he dislikes: " if Christianity is not the true religion it can be confidently asserted that there is none and never will be ". Strong though the logical position of Agnosticism is in Mr. Shelton's view, he urges against it that it leaves unsatisfied, and perhaps unexplained, the religious instinct and that, in practice, very few, if any, people remain genuine agnostics. It is not Mr. Shelton's purpose to decide between his two alternatives, but to exhibit the rational grounds for choice, a choice which, as he rightly emphasises, turns upon the question, Is Jesus God ? E. W. EDWARDS. Types of Modern Theology. By H. R. MACKINTosH, D.Phil., D.D., D.Th. London: Nisbet &amp; Co., Ltd., 1937. Pp. vii + 333. lOs. 6d. net. THIS volume contains, in an expanded form, the Croall Lectures delivered in 1933, by the recently deceased Professor of Christian Dogmatics in the</page><page sequence="19">116 NEW BOOKS. University of Edinburgh. Its subject-matter belongs to the sphere of dogmatic theology rather than to that of philosophy; for, though the theory of knowledge, etc., of some of the theologians dealt with is briefly touched upon, the book is not concerned with any of the fundamental questions, issuing from various sources, which the critical philosopher must raise when confronted with the truth-claim of Christian dogma. Hence a detailed consideration of its contents, however excellent and important they may be deemed as a contribution to dogmatics, would scarcely be in place in this journal. Throughout these lectures the truth of the fundamental doctrines of ecclesiastical theology is presupposed: the New Testament, notwithstand- ing the forthcoming conclusions of critical studies, is an authentic witness to Christ, whose deity alone can explain His influence; Christian faith is insight; Christianity differs absolutely from all other religions; and so on. Prof. Mackintosh was sanguinely convinced as to such matters, and does not seem to have entertained the opinion that one of the surest ways of arriving at certainties is, in Cartesian fashion, to begin by critically ex- amining the credenda as to which we cherish certitude. So the dogmatic systems successively expounded and evaluated in these lectures are appraised according to the degree in which they respectively approximate to orthodoxy. Schleiermacher is found unsatisfactory in that he tended to substitute discovery for revelation, and the religious con- sciousness for the Word of God. The Hegelian interpretation of Christi- anity deepens the conviction that the speculative reason cannot conduct one to the knowledge of God: " if we are to know Him, with the knowledge which is life eternal, He must speak His free and gracious Word, and we must hear in faith ". Ritschl's value as a theologian suffered from his habit of putting historical and ethical judgements in place of the living Lord, and from his failure to understand the gospel of the Reformation in so far as it insisted on justifying faith as the one source of the inspiration of moral life. Troeltsch, the most critical of all the types of theologian discussed, in that he endeavoured to construe Christianity in the light of the history, the comparative study, and the psychology, of religions, is least in favour with the author. Indeed, he quotes with approval the verdict of another writer that Troeltsch's creed frankly renounces all that is specifically Christian-' Christian' here denoting what Protestant Reformation-theology regarded as de fide. The next typical theologian reviewed is the only one of the list who is not a German, viz., Kierkegaard. This theologian, we are told, has been called " the greatest Christian thinker of the past century " and " the greatest of all Christian psychologists ". Dr. Mackintosh's account of his teaching leaves with me the suspicion that Kierkegaard was too much of a rhetorician, an irrationalist and a lover of paradox to have merited much less superlative estimations than these. But he gains the author's admiration chiefly because of his vehement insistence on that element in Christian faith which is none the less certain for defying satisfactory explanation. The last of the selected types of modern theology is Barthianism; and Barth, on account of his basal doctrine that God has uttered His word and will in the Scriptures, or that He has spoken His Word which attests itself in Scripture, is the one of the " types " with whom the author has most sympathy. Dr. Mackintosh may have justly ascribed to Barth " an unrivalled power to wake up the sleeping intelligence of the Christian society"; but Barth's apparent indifference to a' multitude of problems which biblical and other studies during the last hundred years have brought to light-problems which it</page><page sequence="20">NEW BOOKS. 117 should be the duty of the dogmatic theologian to face and reckon with- causes the more critical class of theologians to see little difference between Barthianism and ' fundamentalism' of other kinds, such as can only subsist where ignorance prevails.
