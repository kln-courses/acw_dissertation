<plain_text><page sequence="1">READING ORDINARY VIEWING TOM CONLEY Jean-Louis Schefer. L'HOMME ORDINAIRE DU CINEMA. Paris: Gallimard- Cahiers du Cinema, 1980. Ordinary has become a password for nature. Not long ago when Roland Barthes's distinctions held sway over intellectual order- when he compared the onion to the nut, the readerly to the writerly or the studium to the punc- turn - his most powerful and no doubt most sustained pairing opposed history to nature. Whatever fell under the logic of nature was an indication of ideology, our unquestioned, imaginary feel for human activity as we unwittingly sense the way things have been for all time. In its posters and spots, advertising fabricates natural human behavior. By subjecting its illusion to the pressures of history, Barthes succeeded in alienating whatever had passed off as eternal. He pro- vided a more objective condition for the study of cultural forms. No wonder then, that Mythologies, his first crucial piece of writing, was the work he deplored the most. There he scrutinized the gloss of everyday life in ways that uncannily predicted the fragmentation of ordinary objects that was soon - three or four years later - to become the obsessions of the more successful versions of pop art in North America. By isolating ordinary forms either in formal discourses of linguistic, Freudian or Marxian bent, or by representing them in a tradition of painting that had excluded them, for a short while Barthes and a generation of artists offered the most pervasive study of the unconscious shapes that fill most of the space and time of our lives. In specious ways notions of the ordinary have crept into the field of every- day life, as if they were harking back to a time existing before the distinction be- tween nature and history. A student of language and iconography knows that no common sign or commodity can ever be natural, yet in our relation with the medias we project everyday activity between our daily lives and periodic engagement in their representations in newspapers. It occurs when we read weather reports, Ann Landers, William Safire, Russell Baker or any syndicated voice of critical opinion that reassuringly writes the same grist three times a week, in all areas of television or in art and literature (when we visit art galleries every two weeks, read fiction on Sunday afternoon, following our mire of boredom in tired encounters with the Sunday New York Times). If it can be given an imprimatur of self-evident truth because of recurrence, we can easily accord to an event the status of ordinary fact. One of the more telling signs of critical activity that has fallen under the label of the "post-modern condition" has been its attention to ordinary behavior. In its study of minimal- hence instructive- moments of communication be- tween groups of interlocutors, speech-act theory deals with instances of conver- sation or moments when speakers become self-authorized guarantors of power. Theories of the dynamics of reception of literature reduce the opaque alterity of a literary text to everyday discussion around it in classrooms. Entire monuments of art and their commentary of the last decade have given credence to everyday representations (photography, hyperrealism or movies celebrating the rhythms 4</page><page sequence="2">Scotophorous</page><page sequence="3">.... ....... . ...... . .... ...... . . ...

The logic is as plausible as their product: if, for exam- ple, a sculpture of Duane Hanson arouses slight distaste over its extraordinary and compel- ling duplication of shapeless bodies-fulsome, fat and forty-in shopping malls, it is recuperated as "art" because its meticulous attention to detail can be construed as a ground for a "critique" of mimesis through the patience taken in its reconstruction of detail in homage to tastelessness. Now any work that returns to a mode of realism ("It was about time," assert the poor souls dissatisfied with everything of the last forty years) can be re- deemed by the way its imitation of our everyday encounters with signs and objects can draw attention to the history of their nature. What is evinced from all this is of course more than the ordinary. Quite possibly the hyperreal and postmodern aesthetic brought back or recuperated the irrecuperable- hence artistic-elements of Barthes and the better pop art- ists. Ordinary configurations seem most appropriate for the work of the bland objectification that most criticism undertakes. Ordinary films become proponents of grandiose, libidinal in- terpretations of the organic beauty of daily life, where seemingly imperceptible activities, for lack of more monumental material, become the crux of faintly politicized criticism which casts its "stern approbations" upon the mass medias. The stupendous power of photography, video and cinema has neutralized the extraordinary so much that even experience, a con- cept once dear to the American pragmatic and romantic ethos, and still a basic tenet of its literature, no longer holds. Experience must be figured today in the metaphor of an infinite series of Beta cartridges retaining the narratives of our vacations and weekends. On its magnetic fields are mixed old movies and advertisements along with late-night classics so that, in sum, experience sifts through icons of common stamp and, like memory of our lives that compete with movies and spots, is now only potentiated information. The metaphor of personal experience might also be essayed as floppy discs conserving monthly bills, in- surance payments, letters, manuscripts of review-articles for Diacritics, r6sumes kept in view of hypothetical salary increase, shopping lists and drug prescriptions; or as statements from Amex and Visa that return, like the repressed, to remind us of the moments when we let ourselves go, when we treated guests with extra bottles of wine during regional conventions or when we spent an extra night at the Conrad Hilton where we nervously read our papers and listlessly listened to others, to see friends and an exposition of hyperreal sculpture. Cast in these three metaphors, experience avers to be effusively ordinary, and our most idiosyn- cratic "drives" are bound in systems of retrieval that program their return before they are ever repressed or released. Implied also in critical concern for the ordinary is the maxim which should dictate that where experience no longer has currency, neither can intimacy. Intimacy would have depended on entirely personal distortions of signs, or apprehensions of things in ways that common icons could never be able to express them. Once watched, spied, or intercepted by some form of the medias-whether through rumor, a camera, or a video-recorder- intimacy, which also involves sharing an inchoate mass of memory, can only disappear. The everyday and the ordinary find their most powerful vehicles of expression in films and criticism. This is what sociological study of the medium has taken such care to prove in analysis aiming at producing differences between the medium and the viewer who expects to see those differences. In visual terms, this means that a public can interpret the world through its dialogue with the realism offered through photographic conventions. By way of the difference inherent to the mimetic dimension of photography or film, a public is lured to discover, between what it perceives to be real and what is portrayed on screen, a shape of specious truth. A public can politicize itself simply by virtue of its reaction to a difference and of the strength it invests into its analytical perceptions. Yet this is programmed and eminently retrievable, since the most obvious patterns of signs become the ponderous truth of interpretation proving how the film industry produced symbols of itself, and how it established endless and variously conceived knots of anticipa- tion and desire. The medium has promoted modes of identification coordinated with com- mercial industries and styles of fashion, etc. Seen in this light, film might have been an agency promoting the configurations and methods at the basis of most sociological research and, miraculously, at the very moment when its findings would have been most critical of the medium. Film already baits the interpretor into launching criticism - of either the public diacritics / spring 1985 5</page><page sequence="5">or itself- in order to maintain a negative relation between its product and a consuming mass. As an example, we might test the conditions of our viewing experience of professional football broadcasts, where an obstinately unyielding, always negative participation is evinced through our nauseous (but not unpleasurable) sense of time passing. The archaic spectacle of strident colors, consummate blazonry and bonecrushing violence is displayed compressed, reiterated and also wrapped, packaged and taped according to a balance of psychological shots (close-ups of coaches biting their nails or staring blankly over the field between the subject and the telescopic lens on the other side), ever-repeated interpretations (and verbal anticipations summing up strategies) that not only make an extraordinary con- sumption of energy seem religiously usual on Sunday afternoon, but also force us into wondering if, indeed, with the sameness of it all, the medium is asking us to sociologize ourselves through the allegory of mediated strife. What is ultimately produced amounts not to the record of a game but an uneasiness about what to do with the surfeit of interpretation it places before our eyes. Should we mop floors during the spots, or knit? Do push-ups, or simply relax and drink a few cans of beer? All the intimacy of a relation with excellence, achievement, or even with the unnameable lure of violence that players and spectators share so eagerly, is subject to complicated patterns of editing that elicit sociologized interpretation. A dimly poetic relation with the spectacle is foreclosed by the subjection of proper names (that maybe formerly pertained to the residual order of myth) to new forms of sociology. We are given the statistics of their lives - positions, weight, "experience" or years of service, plus height and collegial "background"-that are part of a colorful curriculum vitae eroticizing the body with its overlays of letters and numbers. Yet, however much we should like to disregard NFL broadcasts, we enjoy forcing ourselves into the laziness it takes to see them, if for no other reason than having them give us a precious clue (or perception) about mass media; provide grist for the discussions to be shared among members of an insipidly "interpretive community"; yield important truths about the art of editing in high technology; reveal a wealth of imaginary relations to produc- tion that multinational corporations invest in the costliest and most carefully produced advertisements in all the medias. The games' astoundingly neutralizing power would seem to be strong enough to erase everything except for the sociological analyses which they en- cou rage. In the midst of the levelling effects of major visual forms, L'Homme ordinaire du cinema comes as a modest revelation. It does not aspire to retrieve any memory of an individual essence through the intelligence of its author, nor does it try to seek a collective experience of our past through common icons and narrative that are evoked with a corpus of European and American films. And contrary to the fashion in which some reviews wished the book to be "received," it does not provide an antidote to cinematic formalism. Nor does it offer a space of retreat for an honnete homme du cinema, that hypothetically well-viewed person who should decry the psychoanalytical and Marxian collages made of the best celluloid of Hitchcock and Welles. The book is hardly written with the dissatisfaction that an ordinary reader might invest in its title. Schefer's book comes from nowhere. It harks back to the patristic tradition that had, in early Christian times, taken as its task the most severe critique of representation that we have ever known. An eminently personal essay, of an intimacy in its commitment to silent film that the book cannot completely share with its reader, Schefer's writing reformulates the sociology of all viewing experience. In a note appended to the book, when its opacity left many readers either perplexed or bored, Schefer remarked that most writings on film recognize a basic division between the viewer and what the film im- poses as an ideal condition of life. This he sees as "hopelessly schematic and totally false in that such a mechanism attempts to define the perceiving subject as somehow an instan- taneous act of perception, a subject for whom memory does not exist and who is constituted entirely within this kind of split" ["Our Written Experience of Cinema: an Interview with Jean- Louis Schefer," enclitic 6 (1982), 40. A reader of this interview has the fortune of consulting Paul Smith's very cohesive study of the same book, in "The Unknown Center of Ourselves: Jean-Louis Schefer's Writing on Cinema."] From this point any efficacious reading of cinema is annulled by the bankruptcy of the logic of perception as a productive mode of analysis, since it is only the repetition of the same set of differences that are taken to have cognitive 6</page><page sequence="6">validity. If we note the gap between ourselves and what we see, Schefer implies, we can be lured into giving false credence to our perceptive faculties. Faith in perception is buttressed by the mainstream of ideological analysis, which sets forth as an operating principle a rift be- tween what is intended to be real and what a critic ascertains as consequential, or "really" real. Far more crucial, the book states, is the strong role which memory plays in devaluating perceptive faculties. With film we have a common cultural experience that programs almost every sphere of human action, since the icons are all known and shared. Images choose and direct spheres of activity of huge masses of individuals.' When facing a movie, "the ordinary man of the cinema" ransacks his memory fleetingly to assign structure to the spectacle he sees. He makes himself a rhythmic part of the irruptions of a past, of an autobiography, or of an ensemble of desire interfering with the narrative of a film. Our attention, like the construct of the film, must be divided in order to be productive. In a mode akin to the dynamics of viewing abstract expressionist painting, Schefer sees memory working through the cinematic image all over, in a process of analogy in which our bodies located the different familiarities, but now with an urgency that leads the eyes not only to exhaustion, but to a triumph of melancholy. Scatter of objects, partial drives, stress of disorder and apprehension of recurring points of articulation (which cannot, since they are unconscious, be schematized or given physical shape) leads us to a personal sense of collec- tive memory which opens onto a vista of monstrosity. The supremely creative side of the melancholic attitude, Schefer implies, can account for prodigious distortion between the anomalies it discovers in itself and the shapes it apprehends. Two recurring examples in L'Homme ordinaire du cinema attest to this kind of interior- ization. One is the "mummy," or the figure of Boris Karloff wrapped in gauze and dragging his bandaged arms and legs wrapped in puttees through the dark corridors of pyramids. The creature never imparts fear upon his viewers. Rather, we wrap ourselves into the gigantic core of its empty body and force the inner walls of our skin to swell and, then, in a momen- tary nightmare, to flake like dandruff along with the ancient tatters hanging from our arms and shoulders. Through a bizarre empathy we disappear into a history of monstrous forms that test the limits of figuration. Schefer notes how as spectators we are virtually the birth- place and duration of what would really be refused to any monster, even to one inhabiting our ordinary daydreams. The mummy gives new degrees of reality to the beings its threatens. As Schefer adds, once an image taken from this genre of the horror film, "This gigantic rag doll of bandages and whose body is a cuirass of pus, becomes, up to his blind- folded eyes, a look of putrefaction which condemns the world" [31, my italics]. No doubt the mummy's curse is one damning both representation and eschatology, since the monster covers the image as a mass - or a cloud - that dissolves all anthropomorphic shapes in its heap of rags. Through the purple optic of the melancholic soul, the mummy enters on the stage as a foil to ideation. He makes the decor crumble by having us draw our dreams of its menace- its living excrementality, its fecal force- into a scene we share with intimacy and calm. The mummy precipitates a regression to a productively visual state of general indif- ference between ourselves, our appendages, and the world we touched when we crawled in diapers through the same dark halls and over the same exotic carpets of the Orient in living rooms we would like to imagine from our past. Such an affable regress to monstrosity has a perfect analogue in the study of a still from Tod Browning's Freaks [which Schefer entitles "The Blood Sausage" (le boudin)] to describe the sight of a white man, in casual dress, framed in medium close-up, who converses with a black figure in repose on a table. The form lacks arms and legs but sports a woolen pirate- IWe need only recall how photographs of Albert Camus, dressed in a trenchcoat with wide lapels, could suggest the tenets of existential philosophy in North America simply because the studied dress- which drew a tight belt around his midriff, providing an ideal B-film backdrop for the intense stare from his murky eyes. His body slumped against a grey wall, the philosopher carefully puffs a cigarette dangling from the corner of his lips: these details can only be remembered unconsciously in guise of Humphrey Bogart of The Big Sleep or legions of films noirs. Any sociology of existentialism, let us say, of its reception and influence in North America, would therefore have roots in fantasies from obscured photographic metaphors affixed to dust jackets or pictures in anthologies. diacritics/ spring 1985 7</page><page sequence="7">sweater of Breton style. The sausage man has just lit his own cigar while propped on a miniature aquarium. Man or monster, asks Schefer, only to muse with delicious irony, "I don't know why this character reduced or condensed into a single swaddled member, this crawling muff that this photograph shows us, evokes the Husserlian idea of this curious sub- traction of phenomena allowing us to attain essences" [55]. This reveries of the critic bring forth the real spectatorial fantasms that show where a notion of sociology can never quite ap- ply to cinema. A pragmatic study of the "difference" between the lump of body and his in- terlocutor simply distracts us from the disquieting thought about "neither what the sausage can do with his desires, nor with his sleep, but with his turds." Perhaps we share with him our history of his return to original form when, "after being continually sabred in so many board- ings in pirate movies, the buccaneer is no more than what remains, a tube who lives in a sweater that, maybe, no mother could have ever knit for him." Did he ever know, Schefer continues, bliss or sorrows of love? He muses that the monster may well be just a perpetual grief of love and its bestial wail. There is nothing either nostalgic or romantic in this view. The monster shares affinities with memories of our basal lives, of our will to be indifferently proper when the dream of an opposite condition surges forth in all of its fecal fantasy that ultimately betrays the implica- tions of the loss of metaphor, or those recurringly frightful thoughts that imagine language having no bearing upon representation. The sausage man, a black stool dressed in white striped wool, a reminder of purity, is a hilariously melancholic dejection of both object and mind. He and the mummy emblematize the condition of cinema that draws us, by way of im- ages, back to scenes of greater flux and stir that too often have been cut away, or expunged from memory. The recall of these obsessive figures overtakes our apprehension of the narra- tions that stage them in the frame of ordinary life. Yet their projection of material essence in dissolution is what, in terms of Raymond Bellour's analysis of classical cinema, constitutes their symbolic blockage, that is, their will to overdetermine the binds and contradictions of meaning that rivet our attention to the synchronies of image and sound. This is most ap- parent in the studio years of Hollywood, when, in a mode akin to allegory, the disjunction of all the elements of a scene (for example, even in such meticulous detail that would account for the arrangement of the two fountain pens on Johnny Lagana's desk in The Big Heat) are so carefully orchestrated that their positioning through the course of a shot reiterates what the narrative has yet to yield. The monstrous would be that blockage personified in the shape of mummies and sausage men who impede us from arriving at any resolution. They disjoin the image through their regressive example, and in doing so, they bring forth a very strange visual panorama of invisibility right where they force the representation to disagregate before our eyes. Elsewhere in Schefer's work the mummy is evoked to suggest the overall process of Husserlian subtraction in cinematographic terms. In L'Espece de chose melancolie, a propos of the notion that writing can, in line with Derrida's critique of logocentrism in the inaugural program of Grammatology, be seen as a "corrosion of the image," evokes the figure of the debobinage de la momie [35, "unwinding the wrappings of the mummy"], or the regress of scripture to hieroglyph that finally recaptures its double essence of disjoined articulations, which reverses the historical line we have inherited from Hegel about the progress of writing (that voice releases script from its dependency on the sterility of the ideogram). But Schefer's metaphor suggests that the scene of writing is embodied - or blocked - in mumified forms unwinding themselves from their own celluloid bandages- hence the figure of the movie reel or bobine written in ddbobinage- that are the shards of all representation, fragments and tatters which lead us to capture over and over again our primal and forever visual grasp of the world we touch. Even the title, L'Homme ordinaire du cinema, suggests a similar regress to the bizarrely organic look of the adjective ordinaire. Since the book has nothing ordinary about it in view- ing cinema, it can only bear a redolently olfactive, richly musky recall in orde, where the order of memory harks back to the Old French ord, or a farcical, Rabelaisian hieroglyph, hors de propos, that cannot be traced unilaterally to the Latin ordo or rectilinear, perspectival sense of meaning. As the title regresses within itself, the overall movement of the major por- tion of the book turns all nameable objects into virtually fecal substance knowing no name. 8</page><page sequence="8">This is shown in Schefer's taste for the predicament of the monster, and also in the obsessive preoccupation that the book has with a Proustian search for adolescence. Adolescence embodies a collective- and very intimate- experience of cinema, where once more the faculty of sight becomes an act of language, or where our apprehension of forms illuminates the invisible relations we feel as we seemingly touch them. But the in- visibility can only be engineered mechanically, through the commonplace of many movies, or grasped intuitively by our inscription of fecality and separation in the texture of all mean- ing. This is to imply that any phenomenology of cinema would have to lead us to a line of rift, perhaps in a Freudian ideolect, redrawn between primary and secondary narcissism, where the body demarcates and retrieves its separation from itself and the world. Here dif- ference is problematic; any cognition of drives or mimetic urges are almost impossible to chart because they recur within the field of memories flowing into the present through a past that cannot be assigned any place or date in history. This stupendous moment of gestation Schefer calls "cette espece de flc.tcrment et de 16vitation du corps dans le souvenir" [214, "this sort of floating and levitation or the body in memory"]; it may be also akin to our lifelong introjection of adolescence, our fascination with its palpable effects left upon us at every moment of our lives, and also of the marvelous power that it has in insulating us from the death of maturity. There can be no better sign of such adolescence than in the role that Laurel and Hardy play in the way the illustrations relate to the book. Three photograms taken from their silent period force us to recall our own problematic experience with the couple. Yes, they are stupid, jovially insipid, and of lightly inflated farce. They are neither as inane as Abbott and Costello nor so grotesquely sadistic as the Three Stooges. They share absolutely none of the poetry of either Keaton, Chaplin or Fields. But who are they? No doubt they appeal to the adolescence we try to repress with our enjoyment of them. For, Schefer reminds us, the pair visualizes the profes- sion of Bouvard and Pecuchet. The objects they touch have a screwy relation with the language they use to name them. Are they perhaps a couple of mother-in-laws of masculine sex who are condemned to live together, since they try to perform what their bodies can never accomplish? Are they ensconced in a virtual adolescence that erects fantasies around the women who, with snickers under their breath, quickly take leave of them? Consigned to parrot each other, they stand on screen in a plan ambricain, stolidly, as if to feel the joy of re- taining shit in their bowels between every vocal or gestural sign they pass to each other about the disconcerting presence of the two girls. Curled into their own circuit of play, they might be "chimera of an embryonic author" who would be named Flaubert. In one remarkably chosen still, we behold pudgy Oliver holding a pair of an ample woman's underwear; looking off and to the left, contained in his inexpressible revery of the grotesque truth that these might have been his own breeches in a former life, he remains almost oblivious to Stan Laurel's modest, forever decent visage of inquiry-the thin partner looks up to the fat master as if he were both a sister and a father- while pointing to two adolescent females to their left, one the embodiment of a teeny-flapper, and the other a model of Gish-like, girlish innocence in a bouffon dress of many layers of a diaphanous gauze of silk. "This is one of the most obscene photographs I have ever known (I must therefore come to terms with the type of horror that underlines it): none of the characters here is completely desirable but this group is a rebus, it must contain the fattest ass of which Hardy is evidence with disgust" [50]. Obscene, no doubt, because its adolescence projects the scene toward invisibility through the points that our own past, our intimacies with ourselves, can only ascertain. The sexual division of boys from girls is clear, but as Schefer reads, the underwear forms a sort of chiffon d'interrogation, a "rag of interrogation," or another shroud of Turin which allows them to anticipate an intense moment of sexual discovery, when as children they- we- play doctor or discover our genitals together, when we put our lips around each other's formerly stupendous erections or spread our legs and delve into the folds of our sexes unencumbered by pubic hair. This seems to be what we gather, pruriently, from what we construe to be exchanged between the two girls who con- fer about this image of Laurel and Hardy. Here Schefer is less graphic than sublimely sug- gestive: "In this Laurel and Hardy a combinatory can be imagined that is impossible, each anatomical group whispering a secret about the other-one does not inquire about a mode of such strange panties in the hands of a man (he does not offer them, does not manipulate diacritics / spring 1985 9</page><page sequence="9">them with devotion, does not sniff them), the viewer does not wonder to whom they will go but to whom they belonged" [511. Implied is that Hardy may have worn them in another life to which he might be regressing. The encounter with both monstrosity and the visible memory of things beyond figuration is made in the way our eyes touch the underwear which play such a dominant role in the photograph. Indeed, once the regression can be associated as both monstrous and obscene-each term being endowed with strong metaphysical, hence farcical and carnavalesque dimensions - then the experience of Laurel and Hardy and the mummy or pirate sausage can be figured in the same obsessional network. In the next ensemble [52-53] of image and commentary in the first section of the book, Schefer illustrates a scene from a Dreyer silent, The Master of the House (1925). In deep focus that frames a woman beyond a doorway, and in front of the realistic decor of a shed in background, a young woman reflects as she is about to hang a piece of white laundry on a clothesline. The rope is parallel and just adjacent to the upper edge of the frame. She literally collects the white light on the shroud from a space beyond and above the frame, holding it, Schefer writes, as "an immaculate splash" (un 4clat immacul). Because the swatch of light that she holds is formless, akin to what escapes metaphor, and lacking memory that could localize or historicize the scene, the shroud cannot even figure the possibility of non- figuration. Through infinite scale of duration which the photograph conveys as its proper essence- like the Freudian unconscious, the photograph knows no time- we are absorbed into the swath of light. "This woman bends over, chooses this sheet and, along, through these hands, this goodness and pity, from now on we can be no more than this white, this sheet, or breeze that dries it or the incomprehensible flood of light which gives duration to an entirely other night" [53]. These words appear to be mystical, of a "folly of vision"2 im- bued with a material absolution of their luminosity. As such, they are of a substance that more phenomenonal or logical analysis cannot attain. And grounded in arcane practice of analogy, their mercurial power forces the literally black and white aspect of the photograms and the printed words to reflect the shroud of light that illuminates our reading. Since the underwear that Stan Laurel sports in front of his immaculate sailor-boy uniform is a shroud we see by day, and the sheet in the Dreyer still a figure egressing from night, the ensemble duplicates the system of "black" and "white" versions of a Hollywood orgy four pages before (chosen from Stroheim's "Merry Widow"), but in order to inflect even the typography with a collective presence of a universal memory of bodies passing timelessly through the light-and ink-of a cosmic projection of cinema. Mysticism and caricature blend in all of Schefer's readings of images. Laurel and Hardy are subjected to a dense meditation on obscenity in absolute terms of light and dark. Its almost Baroque presence in the book is chiaroscuro grounding the farce of its early silent cinema. Since the art of distortion has been a problem of the relation of the body to the frame (each imposes its strictures upon the other), we can surmise that, as blocks of light, the sheet and underwear destroy the perspective, linearity and depth of field that would spur the process of analogy and illusion. And so does the burlesque body which theorizes the tradi- tion of the frame by having us inhabit its grotesque form within our imagination. Akin to a fantasied reading of Daumier's drawings of Louis-Philippe as a pear that ripens and spoils, through which we feel our jowls expanding, our bodies sweating from overingestion and swelling with flatulent wind, Schefer's sideshow of caricatures from silent cinema brings the representation of the body into a mystical field of absolution. This effect is achieved through a skewed relation with perspective. A fat child sits ensconced in his laughter before a blur of Chaplin who passes before him [74]. He is of outrageous self-containment, seated on a chair too small for his bottom and next to a gentleman concentrating on the evening playbill. "This jovial fatass, this triumph of the first communicant canker, finally reunites the imagination of the gobbler of chocolate 2They act out what Michel de Certeau writes of the madness of perception in Merleau-Ponty, in his decisive "Folie de la vision," Esprit 6 (June 1982), 86-89, especially: "De ce fait, voir est ddjA un acte de langage.

It is hardly prob- able that one of us (or myself) might have been that little boy, despite his large lace collar on a costume where we would have expired other sighs. But, in fact, it is the character of a painting, one of the 'Children of Edward,' the model of the boy that is bounced around in vaudeville and stuffed with sugar candies like a bouddha" [75]: once again the reader's body passes through the distended image and verges toward perspectival distortion experienced through the paradoxical intimacy of a collective memory. Was the little fat fanny a figure of ourselves, or was it guided and programmed by way of some imperious caricature that led us from the pleasures of chewing candy bars and sucking ice cream cones to some other form that, now all too present, happens to be the erectile body seated at another music hall? No doubt the mystical presence of this kind of memory in Schefer's writing might owe a great deal to Andr6 Bazin's crucial essay, "Ontology of the Photographic Image," a text which essays the paradox that photography, an avatar of the embalming arts, immortalizes death by effacing any relay or gap between a representation of the world of which the image would be a shadow or illumination. "For the first time," Bazin repeats with litanic insistence, the photograph is, objectally, the world. As death is the victor over time and the body, en- shrouded in cloth, the mummy represents a defense against its ravages. "Liberated" by photography, an object is no longer attached to "temporal contigencies" of the artist's hand, to descriptive words, or to sets of languages approximating it after its disappearance. In a vein equally mystical as Schefer's, Bazin concludes that photography does not create eternity through the poverty of its "artery," but that it embalms time, it subtracts it from its own cor- ruption. Which explains why we are charmed by Schefer's gallery of grotesque stills from the olden days of cinema, because the figures are vaguely remembered as Fatty Arbuckles, Blanche Sweets, Chaplins, Ben Turpins or Tom Mixes- which are ourselves, arrested, in our own duration of history. The pictures he takes are relics, or "souvenirs," that have undergone a transfer of reality- reality having been assured its existence in the mimetic tradition through the process of transfer-owing its success to the mummy complex. Entitled the "Gods," the stills wipe from all abstraction of time the fantasm of symbolic shapes knowing no analogy with nature. Hence the capital role that underwear and shards of cloth will play in the mystical frame of the book. Its unspoken allegiance with Bazin and his haunted fascination for the white screen 3 gives its materiality a presence that, like any sacred text, allows its writing to become absolute and timeless in the act of its apprehension through memory. The bias of L'Homme ordinaire du cinema directs us to the reasons why film is most suc- cessful in its treatment of apocalypse, monstrosity, doubling or bloodletting, or when its at- tention to freaks, amorphous shapes, or draculas divesting the human form of its allegiance with nature. It suggests, too, that even the most banal of all genres, the documentary, suc- ceeds only when it accedes to some form of liberation from the objectal forms that its mode avows to be real (as in Huston's Let there be Light that had long been banned in the United States, a film whose finality is caught in the last dissolve in the light of Key Largo, or Land without Bread which is initially a study of clouds and writing). Schefer's work seems to be aimed against the overriding reason of the reality of photographs. It relentlessly puts in ques- tion our unconscious desire, which most filmic analysis takes to be axiomatic, that would associate the photograph with an adequacy of the transfer or truth of self identity. Bazin had quipped ironically, "Perspective was the original sin of Western painting." A reincarnation of photography, the monocular perspective inherited from Leonardo was also perhaps a cause for the intensified appearance of monsters and prodigies on the Western horizon of the arts of medicine, genealogy, narrative and popular painting. The obsessive fascination of the later Renaissance with scenes having no pictorial equivalence touches on the repressed that Schefer's "ordinary" view brings forth. In frame is the obvious flatness of a world that really has no depth when seen from a cockeyed bias-a view that may well have 3See the praise of the end of Bresson's Diary of a Country Priest in "The Stylistics of Robert Bresson": "Quite naturally, at the command of an imperious logic, there is nothing more that the image has to com- municate except by disappearing. The spectacle has been led, step by step, towards that night of the senses the only expression of which is a light on a black screen," in What is Cinema?, v. 1 [Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967, 140]. diacritics / spring 1985 11</page><page sequence="11">been blinded with the triumph of perspective. Pure light, a cloud, an aura of mist, a reflective glimpse angling back to no origin, the irruption of a mummy shuffling through a deep cor- ridor, or even the stare of Dracula in close-up: these momentary scenes that cannot be fixed in any extended syntagma run through ourselves in irruptive patterns that are not always born of an easily historicized past, be it in early modern culture which dictates the shapes around us, or in the adolescence of cinema in the growth of Hollywood. The most dominant word in all of Schefer's writings is espece. It heralds L'Espece de chose me/ancholie [Paris: Aubier-Flammarion, 1980], plays a dominant role in the analysis of Paolo Uccello entitled Le Deluge, la peste [Paris: Galil6e, 1976], and dominates even the more recent articles in Camera/stylo and L'Ecrit du temps (especially "Comment cette couleur" in number 3, Spring 1983). Espece, a noun of modification that might generalize a phenomenon to make it accessible - a "kind of .. ." or "sort of .. ." that would translate cette espece de...- makes any designation intolerably monstrous, either in its echo of damna- tion or its literal reduction to an unnameable sort of ... species. The "species of this melan- choly thing" might well be the memory of some kind of intimacy that refuses mediation or transfer except through autobiographical glimpse. The apparition of the word in an emblematic movement at the overture of "Comment cette couleur" might convey the hold that cinematic images have on our imagination of beginnings. Mais ces concours vers le temps, o0i cette main qui voudrait le redessiner, ne com- mencent pas a rassembler des souvenirs, ils tracent la tension d'une exp6rience lointaine par laquelle les fuites ou les perspectives imaginaires du pass6 sont des experiences douloureuses, seulement parce qu'elles r6alisent une segrcgation ac- tuelle d'un temps impossible, d'un temps sans alliance dans le vivant. Douloureuses, quand m me les figures ainsi montr&amp;es ne serait que grotesques: le grotesque mime des figures apparues pourrait &amp;tre le signe que quelque chose du temps reviendrait pour la premiere fois afin d'etre mesur6 (mesur6 pour la premiere fois sur le corps mime de ce qui a disparu): comme si une espece de jouet abandonn6 a des milliers d'annees n'6tait plus que le corps, improbable dans sa mesure, de quiconque cherche ou scrute le temps qui I'a rendu invisible. [105] [But these concourses toward time, or this hand that would like to draw it over again, do not begin to collect memories, they trace the tension of a fargone ex- perience through which the vanishing points or the imaginary perspectives of the past are painful experiences, only because they achieve a current segregation of an impossible time, of a time without any alliance in life. Painful, nonetheless, the figures thus shown would only be grotesques: the very grotesque of apparent figures might be the sign of something measured (measured for the first time on the very body of what disappeared): as if a kind of toy abandoned for thousands of years were no more than the body, so improbable in its measure, of whoever searches or examines the time that made it invisible.] These sentences sum up and repeat Schefer's fascination with cinema and the insight that a reading of its memory can offer. Redundant and powerful, the words have a staunchly allegorical imprint in their simultaneous return to common fantasms. Once again regress in time and space is paramount. The inchoate but omnipresent tension of a faraway experience returns to the "original sin of perspective" that Bazin had located in the quattrocento, incor- porated into an intimate, common and collectively painful experience of mimesis. Its agony, of course, entails the vision of residue, if not dejections, of colors and human forms. This was the concern of the study of Paolo Uccello, and now it is seen in the word grotesques caught in the oxymoron of their recurrently initial vision. These grotesques are not just tracings, half- human and half-chimerical, monstrous forms like those of early cinema and of our autobiographies, but also figures emerging from a hidden cavity, another limbo of time, held intact by the magma of history and intimate experience. A French reader cannot dissociate from these obsessions those remainders that dominate L'Homme ordinaire du cindma or the metaphysics of excrement which Montaigne had cast in his figure of crotesques framing his essay on "Friendship" for an absent La Boetie: yet the espece de jouet abandonne in the 12</page><page sequence="12">passage above returns to the trail of the grotesques through its affinity for the thread of the bobin - or pick-up reel - in the parable of Beyond the Pleasure Principle, now personified in order to mark the fugacious tactility of its invisibility. The prose bends and turns on the allegorical axes of the words and embodies at every moment what, in Schefer's work on cinema, is cast in the relation between the images and the more autobiographical and mystical writing in the second portion of his book. Seen in this light, L'Homme ordinaire du cinema can only be read through intense scrutiny of the fragmentary images of autobiography. These images that would be possessed both by the individual remembering them, or held in an imaginary cinematheque of collec- tive memory of films, force the beholder to recollect and, simultaneously, to "collectify" the intimacies of experience that are held to be true because they are beyond transfer. How can we argue with or against a mummy that exceeds the genre or the period in which a history of cinema may have buried it? Regress is reading. It is even part of what the book elicits: as a child the most frightening film I ever saw, and which to this day brings forth fear because of its timelessness, a film whose effects remain embedded in some of my closest brushes with death, was Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. When the two clowns crept into an alcove where Bela Lugosi waited to ambush them with his prolonged stare, in a sustained condition of arrested panic, I covered my eyes and slowly curled into a mass behind the seat in front of me. Holding my body together in seizure, I dared to ask my older brother above and to my left to tell me when the movie would be "Okay." My palms pressed some licorice candies-two or three Mason "Black Crows," I think, little domes of anise flavored molasses- in anticipation, hopefully, of the day I would suck them again with pleasure and taste them in the afternoon light when the movie would be over. No matter how trivial the account of such an "ordinary" moment of children at a Satur- day afternoon matinee in the late 1940's, an autobiographical moment of this sort betrays evidence, thirty-five years later, of the monstrosity that the comedy opened within the body, for Abbott and Costello, timeless brethren then, were the stuff of fascination on Saturdays after timelessly boring weeks during which the body was stuck to a wooden desk in grammar school. Unfortunately the stricture of criticism almost disallows memory from taking any part in its process; and somehow it seems to be the only virtual way by which the work of Schefer's breadth can be followed. As another reminiscence of memory anchored by death, one which is far more recent and direct, but less nagging than the stills of silent film or the haunting encounter with two buffoons, came through the semblance of the picture of the pirate sausage man taken from Freaks. In the last year, accompanying the protracted death of my mother, after three months of visits at home, in a hospital and then in a nursing home, I beheld an emaciated, paralyzed figure which had been, I think, my mother, reduced to a sum of sixty pounds. It was erected in a bed on the third floor of the institution, the level to which the last cases are always relegated. The woman discoursed with us through grunts and winks of the eyelids ("One if it's'yes,' Ma, and two if it's 'no.'"). Over the last two months she staged a corporal dissolution into a peculiar kind of reduced essence where, in her white shrouds, breathing less and less easily, wheezing with enormous difficulty, finding herself gripped in her Yankee past with its ferocious will to gyp death at all cost, she gripped the light that streamed through the win- dow, grimaced as if in a paralysis between a smile and excruciating pain, stared vacantly with opaque, blackening eyes that had the look of early Christian icons, and slowly lost the rhythm of her breath. The hand we held became colder and colder, its blood was slowly retreating from it, as if her lungs somehow could not reach the crisp light of late winter beyond the window. There was something usual, or olfactively ordinary-as in the look of ordinary conversation between the cylindrical figure cited above- that we had attained after grievous struggle in the approaches to death, but only after the images that had coded the loss were cleansed by the light on the shroud over the lump of body in bed. Finally achieved, an espece de mort ordinaire reigned over the scene in the nursing home before official words came to verify that it had passed. L'Homme ordinaire du cinema can open any number of passages of this kind and, for- tunately, they leave their violence to the imagination. Schefer's text provides what elsewhere it calls a gaping eye to detect some of the evanescence of these moments we carry with us, like souvenirs, beyond the realm of words. "Un oeil biant s'est ouvert en nous, il a fait naitre diacritics / spring 1985 13</page><page sequence="13">le visible et ne le d6truit plus" [213, "a gaping eye has opened in us, it has given birth to visibility and no longer destroys it"]. The monocular view of a single eye brings forth the ever- renewed incipience of the sight of memory and of its total resistance to any easy inscription of a sociology of fantasm. For even the most impoverished memory that clicks through a still or grips a reflection about a scene, whether in film or of time passed, disallows a relation of communication from ever taking place between two spectators and its photographic inter- mediary. Any irruption of meaning through its relations with images and words of cinema - cinema that has to be pressed to oblivion because we are always seeing it in memory- disenfranchises the kind of recuperation that the medias project in the videotapes of most everyday life. Through the very literal stamp of a mystical discourse on film, from a rejection of resemblance that constitutes the stuff of the "post-modern" condition, we owe infinite gratitude to Schefer and the difficult, dense view of cinema he brings to writing. 14</page></plain_text>
