<plain_text><page sequence="1">Double Discourses in John Irving's The World According to Garp KIM MCKAY In The World According to Garp John Irving forms a type of dialogue within the narration by creating a narrator who uses a double discourse: that of the biographer and that of the fiction writer. It is not unusual in the Bildungsroman genre, to which this novel most certainly belongs, for the narrator to adopt the role of biographer to a certain extent. Bildungsroman narrators do not generally, however, adopt that stance as explicitly as Irving's narrator does. As Michael Priestly notes, the narrator "is intended to be Garp's official biographer" (87). Using evidence from secondary sources, paying particular attention to the incidents in Garp's life that appear in his fiction, and evaluating Garp's writing and artistic philosophy, the narrator often adopts an academic language-that of literary biography. The text he creates is one suitable for fictive future students of Garp's work, who also want to be informed about his life. As presented in this language, Garp is not a character created but a historical figure for study. When he does treat Garp as a character, however, the narrator adopts the language of fiction. Calling attention to his omniscient power over the text, the narrator manipulates the sequence of events, spins metaphors, creates a persona, adopts comic and satiric attitudes, and uses the present tense-the techniques of the fabricator. Using both the language of biography and that of fiction, the narrator's discourse reflects an important conflict that develops in Garp as artist, that of memory versus imagination. In his youth Garp's imagination seems to be easily accessible to him. But as he develops in this Kunstlerroman, he relies more and more on memory, although he fights that reliance. As Gabriel Miller writes, "one problem he [Garp] 457</page><page sequence="2">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE must contend with during the novel is an inability to separate his own personal life from his fiction" (90). During his stay in Vienna as a young man, Garp creates a wonderful short story from only a few details from his experience. But he knows, even this early in his career, that "Imagination . . . came harder than memory" (87) because he has watched his mother Jenny Fields at the typewriter. In the time that she writes her entire autobiography, Garp manages only one rather lengthy short story. Always conscious of the lesson learned from reading Marcus Aurelius, that the difference between good and bad writers is not subject matter but "intelligence and grace" (88), Garp chooses a subject quite separate from his experience for his first novel. Ironically, he later feels that his novel, Procrastination, suffered from being too distant from his life. No amount of intelligence and grace could overcome the lack of first-hand knowledge of Vienna during the Russian occupation. In his next novel, Second Wind of the Cuckold, Garp attempts to weld biography and fiction by simply altering the events of his life, but he produces a work of questionable literary value. His short story "Vigilance" is almost literally autobiography, and the result is a comic but "small" story. In his third novel, The World According to Bensenhaver, Garp uses autobiographical material, but, by narrating through the consciousness of a character unlike himself, he manages to apply imagination and to create rather than simply record. Finally he rediscovers the balance between memory and art. In the novel he is writing when he dies, My Father's Illusions, Garp has the same imaginative control of experience that he achieved in his first piece of fiction. His growth as a writer, then, encompasses his regaining as an adult the aesthetic perspective that he had as a young man. Just as Garp is drawn toward the language of memory, the narrator is influenced by the language of fiction, the art form of his Kunstlerroman hero. When the narrator commences the text he seems sure of his biographical approach, but soon he becomes seduced by the fiction writer's freedom with his material, as well as by Garp's life and art, and his discourse begins to reflect techniques borrowed from the fabricator's craft. Conversely, Garp begins his career determined to use only imagination, but soon he becomes seduced by the ease of recording his life, the narrator's ostensible task. His discourse begins to reflect techniques borrowed from the biographer's craft. In this way the narrator's struggle with the languages of fiction and biography is the mirror image of Garp's struggle as a writer with the forces of memory and imagination.' This double tension creates a kind of dialogue in the narration, a trait indicative of Irving's earlier novels as well. 458</page><page sequence="3">JOHN IRVING'S DOUBLE DISCOURSES In his first two novels and, to a lesser extent, in his third novel Irving experimented with the kind of layered narrative voices and incorporated genres that provide the complex dialogue in Garp. Indeed, in Setting Free the Bears, his first novel, Irving relies on three voices, each of which raises a question about the division between biography and fiction. Although Hannes Graf is Irving's central narrator in Bears, his voice controls only parts one and three. In part two Hannes transcribes, apparently word for word, Siegfried Javotnik's notebooks, much as the narrator in Garp presents Garp's fiction. Once the text is turned over to Siggy in part two, though, it picks up not one but two voices. One voice is Siggy's as he records his watches while planning the zoo break; these records make clear that Graf is Siggy's intended audience. The second is Siggy's as historian and autobiogra- pher; the audience in these segments is the more general, unknown audience of any text whose writer hopes, as Siggy seems to have hoped, that it will be published. Although Siggy credits his source for the biographical events that occur prior to his ability to remember them, "At least Ernst Watzek-Trummer claims so, and I take my history from him" (201), the dialogue he quotes extensively surely comes from his imagination. In other words, he, not unlike Garp in Irving's fourth novel, creates fiction from his life. Siggy is not, however, the only writer in this text who feels free to adapt biography by employing fictional techniques; as we learn in part three, Hannes has altered his sources for part two by choosing and reshaping, as the fiction writer does: "Of course, there's more to the notebook than that. And, of course, the zoo watches and the autobiography don't appear together in the original; it was my idea to interleaf them" (221). In his second novel, The Water-Method Man, Irving continues to weave a novelistic whole from various voices. The pattern of the first five chapters exemplifies the narrative structure: chapter one uses the first-person narration of Fred Bogus, chapter two uses a third-person narration, chapter three uses no narrator per se, for it consists of a letter, chapter four uses Bogus as narrator again, and chapter five returns to the third-person narrator. Irving does, however, break from the neat arrangement of one narrator per chapter and mix the controlling voices within chapters, as he does in chapter ten. Within the third-person narration, in a manner perfected by Irving's narrator in Garp, the narrator shows his proximity to the central character when he presents the character's language as his own, as he does through his use of exclamation marks and his lack of quotation marks in the second sentence that follows: "Trumper listened to Colm's sweet breathing. 459</page><page sequence="4">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE How fragile children's faces are in sleep!" (427). Parallel to the narrative style of Garp in another way, this novel incorporates parts of a film script as well as reviews of the completed film, letters, lines and explication of the Norse poem "Akthelt and Gunnel," and a chapter from the novel Vital Telegrams. In addition, Irving explores the effects of the present tense in a text that is predominantly in past tense, as he does in chapter eleven when Bogus shifts from past to present and back to past without a page break or any other cue. In The Water-Method Man, then, Irving's multi-layered narrative suggests the fractured mind and spirit of his central character, a method of storytelling Irving returns to with great success in Garp. Irving abandons the plural voices he established in the first two novels in his third one, The 158-Pound Marriage, and chooses a single first-person narrator who is a historical-novelist, a choice that seems to refuse the tension Irving has established between the two sides of that hyphen. Speaking of this novel, Harter and Thompson claim that Irving fails to "create a multidimensional narrative persona who can embody an artistically integrated human experience, an experience that should be revealed through its narration" (60). Certainly The 158-Pound Marriage is Irving's weakest novel to date, due in large part to its narrative limitations. Yet in its uneasy blend of history and fiction we can see Irving struggling with a theme and a style that remain key to his work. For example, when the anonymous narrator adopts his friend Severin's point of view, complete with extensive dialogue in a scene from which the narrator was most surely absent (chapter 8), he is practicing his trade, coaxing fiction from second-hand information, as both Garp and the narrator in Garp do. In regard to Irving's interest in narrative voices and the conflict between life and art, biography and fiction, the first novels represent crucial experiments in form and theme. Not until Garp, however, does Irving shape a text that codifies voice and theme so effectively. In an analysis of the narration of Garp the theory of Susan Lanser is most helpful. As Lanser suggests, a study of the phraseological and psychological stances of a narrator reveals the ways in which he or she is affected by the textual world. "Phraseological stance" refers to the "languages"2 in the text. This stance reflects a range of discourse styles from diegetic to mimetic, in which pure diegetic discourse is the narrator's own language and mimetic discourses are written records he or she provides for the reader. A midway point is a character's indirect tagged discourse. As Lanser notes, the range between diegetic and mimetic indicates "not only phraseological form, but also the degree to 460</page><page sequence="5">JOHN IRVING'S DOUBLE DISCOURSES which the narrator is involved in a given segment of discourse" (187). Psychological stance is a measure of the narrator's distance from or affinity with a character or event. It refers not only to the quantity of information given about a particular character or event but also to the kind of information given-subjective or objective (205). Subjective information reveals the perceiver's ideology while objective information does not. Psychological stance further incorporates "how" a character is seen, whether the vision is internal or external (209). In addition, the depth of the vision, whether the perceiver supplies only what can be seen and heard or also supplies the thoughts of the character (212), might be considered. Through these indications one can determine the degree to which the narrator approves or disapproves of the character (215). The secondary sources Irving's narrator uses in Garp correspond to the most mimetic manner of expression in Lanser's description of the phraseological stance-journals and written records. The narrator's adoption of Garp's fiction style also reveals his phraseological stance, for this is a language borrowed from the character; therefore it is a kind of hybridization. But the narrator's reproduction of large parts of Garp's fiction and his interest in the events in Garp's life that influenced his fiction are indications of the narrator's psychological stance. In addition, the depth of the narrator's "subjective information" about Garp reveals his affinity with Garp-a further measure of his psychological stance. The first sentence of the novel establishes the narrator as researcher and the text as "fictionalized history" (Harter and Thompson 75), in its attention to detail, date, and place: "Garp's mother, Jenny Fields, was arrested in Boston in 1942 for wounding a man in a movie theatre" (3). The speaker assumes that we know the Garp spoken of, and that, indeed, we are reading this book because its title announces Garp as its subject. The first sentence also suggests that the narrator feels no need to write "T. S. Garp," for in the tradition of literary criticism and biography one often refers to well-known writers by their last names. As he proceeds, the narrator continues in the biographical format when he quotes from various written records. Mikhail Bakhtin calls such external documents "incorporated genres": "All these genres, as they enter the novel, bring into it their own languages, and therefore stratify the linguistic unity of the novel and further intensify its speech diversity in fresh ways" (321). These genres are mimetic elements from the phraseological stance, in Lanser's terminology. But the prominence the narrator assigns to them in his 461</page><page sequence="6">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE text reveals his psychological stance -his admiration and respect for the artist. In the narrator's biography these genres are sources of information about the life he portrays. (In Irving's novel they serve a similar purpose, though a fabricated one: they introduce a voice apart from the narrator's and a language separate from the narration.) One finds quotations from Garp's journals and personal papers, Jenny Fields's published autobiography, Garp's fiction, and his critical reviews, all of which stratify the novel while for the most part they suggest the narrator's role as biographer.3 In the first two chapters the narrator provides twenty-six quotations of Garp's words from an unknown source. One finds such references throughout the novel (except for chapters 6 and 10-15), but not to the extent that one finds them in the beginning, when the narrator initiates his role as biographer by providing evidence of his research. Seemingly taken from Garp's journal, although we never hear of his writing one, the first quotations are autobiographical in content. They provide evidence to support the narrator's recounting of Jenny Fields's early years: "'My mother," Garp wrote, 'was a lone wolf'" (4); "'My mother,' Garp wrote, 'was not one for making fine distinctions"' (6); and "'My mother,' Garp wrote, 'went through her life on the lookout for purse-snatchers and snatch-snatchers'" (8). At times the narrator uses his storehouse of biographical material to form a larger part of his narration. For example, the narrator quotes Garp's explanation of what a ball turret gunner is after he establishes the fact that "Garp's father was a ball turret gunner" (15). Generally, however, the narrator selects only one or two sentences from the famous writer's papers and marks the quotation with the narrative tag "Garp wrote." Quotations from Jenny Fields's autobiography work in a similar fashion, but the source for this information is clearly Jenny's autobiography, A Sexual Suspect. As biographer, Irving's narrator uses these quotations to provide evidence of the influence Garp's mother had upon him. The narrator records Jenny's famous words: "I wanted a job and I wanted to live alone. That made me a sexual suspect. Then I wanted a baby, but I didn't want to share my body or my life to have one. That made me a sexual suspect, too" (13). Jenny manages to conceive without sharing her body. And Garp's Bildung is clearly shaped by the manner of his conception. His ideology is also influenced by this strong woman's very certain ideas about the rights of the individual and those of women in particular.4 The narrator quotes her on the subject of Garp's father: 462</page><page sequence="7">JOHN IRVING'S DOUBLE DISCOURSES "Of course I felt something when he died," Jenny Fields wrote in her famous autobiography. "But the best of him was inside me. That was the best thing for both of us, the only way he could go on living, the only way I wanted to have a child. That the rest of the world finds this an immoral act only shows me that the rest of the world doesn't respect the rights of an individual." (23) The most important texts for the biographer, however, are T. S. Garp's novels and stories.5 A particularly generous biographer, this narrator goes beyond the usual reproduction of passages from the writer's work and reprints for us in full Garp's first notable piece of fiction, the short story "The Pension Grillparzer." Like an academic biographer, the narrator does not discuss the work so much as he describes the period of Garp's life from which it comes. For this purpose the narrator tells us that "In his time spent in pensions, Garp discovered that a water closet was a tiny room with nothing but a toilet in it.... The W.C., of course, would also feature prominently in Garp's story" (83). In addition, the narrator explores the evolution of the story: He saw a four-member circus unload from Hungary, or Yugoslavia, at a railroad station. He tried to imagine them in his story. There had been a bear who rode a motorcycle, around and around a parking lot. A small crowd gathered and a man who walked on his hands collected money for the bear's performance in a pot balanced on the soles of his feet; he fell, occasionally, but so did the bear. (86) Because that description precedes Garp's short story in the text, the narrator has prepared us for the parallels between the events in Garp's life and his first work of fiction. He further explores the story's creation when he describes Garp's visit to the writer's room in the museum that Jenny has directed him to: "The writer . . . was named Franz Grillparzer; Garp had never heard of him" (86). Soon we learn that Garp has made progress with his story and has decided to incorporate a bad circus and a pension named Grillparzer. And, guiding us through the young writer's development, the narrator as biographer divides the story into two parts in his own text: the first part Garp wrote before he understood the meaning of death, but the second part follows the death of Charlotte, the whore Garp came to love. Conversely, we receive only the narrator's summaries, not excerpts, of Garp's first and second novels. The first, entitled Procrastination, is called "'historical.' It is set in the Vienna of the war years, 1938-45, and through the period of the Russian occupation" (137). The narrator summarizes the novel for us, records the various reviews it received, 463</page><page sequence="8">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE and comments on the book's impact: "It was, of course, never a popular book, and it hardly made T. S. Garp into a brand name; it would not make him 'the household product'-as he called her-that his mother had become" (139). Although Garp avoids the autobiographical in his work because, as the narrator writes (borrowing Garp's adjectives), "He knew about all the shitty autobiographical associations that make those rabid readers of gossip warm to an occasional fiction" (328), Garp's second novel clearly uses events from his life. The narrator-biographer makes that evident when he carefully details the Garps' affairs with Alice and Harrison Fletcher upon which the novel is based. Garp insists that Second Wind of the Cuckold is "not about us . . . It's not about any of that. It just uses that." But, as the narrator says, the novel "was about four people whose finally unequal and sexually striving relationship is a bust" (160). As Gabriel Miller asserts, "Garp's vision is a limited one, consistently colored by autobiography and his obsession with death; he's unable to get beyond his personal life" (107). The reader has no doubt, nor does the biographer, that Garp's second novel bears a strong resemblance to the Garps' and the Fletchers' experiment in neighborly love and that Garp uses too much memory and not enough imagination in its creation. The narrator reveals the source for Garp's short story "Vigilance" by relating in the chapter entitled "The Eternal Husband" how Garp, suffering from writer's block, chases cars on his street. As he approaches them, he berates the drivers for speeding where children play. Three chapters later, in "It Happens to Helen," the narrator records Garp's short story "Vigilance" in full. Written to try to win Helen back, just as Garp used "The Pension Grillparzer" to get her to marry him, this story has none of the merit of Garp's earlier story. Helen knows why: "I mean, what is it? A self-parody? You're not old enough, and you haven't written enough, to start mocking yourself. It's self-serving, it's self-justifying; and it's not about anything except yourself, really" (238). In other words, it is a record of his life, not art. The story is Garp's attempt to use only the language of memory. But the biographer shows the relation of Garp's life to his art, how the two intertwine, by printing the short story. The final piece of Garp's fiction reproduced by the narrator is the first chapter of The World According to Bensenhaver. By the time the narrator presents this chapter, the reader knows of not one but perhaps three biographical impulses behind the gruesome rape story. First of all, as the son of Jenny Fields, the famous feminist who helps abused women (the Ellen Jamesians, for example), Garp has been exposed to 464</page><page sequence="9">JOHN IRVING'S DOUBLE DISCOURSES female suffering for most of his life. In addition, Garp has found in the park a young girl who has just been raped. Although he catches the rapist and becomes a hero, Garp feels responsible: "Rape, Garp thought, made men feel guilty by association" (149). Finally, the novel that Garp writes is influenced by the disastrous car crash that kills his son, Walt. Unlike the autobiography of "Vigilance," however, as Harter and Thompson note, in this novel Garp has found "an objective distance" (95). In fact, these critics see the first chapter of The World According to Bensenhaver as a measure of "Garp's maturing aesthetic purpose and vision" (97). He is beginning to learn how to control the facts of his life with his imagination. In the narrator's text as biography, one finds another incorporated genre, the critical reviews of Garp's fiction. The inclusion of these reviews suggests that, as a student of the famous writer Garp, the narrator has done his homework. He records Garp's first rejection: "The story is only mildly interesting, and it does nothing new with language or with form. Thanks for showing it to us, though" (129). And in reference to Garp's Procrastination the narrator reproduces these reviews: "It is amazing that the now-famous son of Jenny Fields has actually grown up to be what he said he wanted to be when he grew up" (139). Another reviewer wrote, "Young Mr. Garp is still writing about bears. Perhaps, when he grows up, he'll write something about people" (139). A critic of Second Wind of the Cuckold "called the novel 'bitterly truthful,' but he hastened to point out that the bitterness doomed the novel to the status of 'only a minor classic'" (159-60). "The novel confused nearly everyone; even its reviews were confusing" (160) the narrator writes. Ironically, The World According to Bensenhaver, which Garp's publisher John Wolf thought was so pornographic as to warrant publication in the pornographic Crotch Shots, earned Garp this very winning review: "The women's movement has at last exhibited a significant influence on a significant male writer" wrote the reviewer, who was an associate professor of women's studies somewhere. She went on to say that The World According to Bensenhaver was "the first in-depth study, by a man, of the peculiarly male neurotic pressure many women are made to suffer." And so forth. (342) These mimetic records establish the separation of the narrator's voice from the voices he records. But on a psychological plane his recording of these genres suggests the high value he applies to them. In addition to quoting his sources, the biographer discusses Garp's 465</page><page sequence="10">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE thoughts about writing and provides an informed summary of Garp's aesthetic ideas. This subjective approach and the display of Garp's unconscious thoughts further reveal the narrator's psychological stance-his affinity and approval. In such discussions the narrator approaches Garp's essential aesthetic problem, the tension between memory and art. We learn that Garp thought "a writer's job is to imagine everything so personally that the fiction is as vivid as our personal memories" (119). Similarly, the narrator writes, "What was 'going on,' in Garp's opinion, was never as important as what he was making up-what he was working on" (135). That the two impulses, what's going on and what's made up, are implicated is clear from the narrator's claim that "His first novel, Procrastination-in his opinion- suffered from the pretentious weight of all the fascist history he had taken no real part in. His second novel suffered from his failure at imagining enough-that is, he felt he had not imagined far enough beyond his own fairly ordinary experience" (170). In these passages the narrator explores Garp's struggle to find a subject and a style without succumbing to autobiography or losing vividness by relying too heavily on imagined life. A degree of the difficulty Garp experiences in that struggle is suggested when the narrator quotes Garp's metaphor about writing: "If you are careful, . .. if you use good ingredients, and you don't take any shortcuts, then you can usually cook something very good.... With writing, I find, you can have all the right ingredients, give plenty of time and care, and still get nothing" (176). The narrator also shares Garp's frustration with the insignificance of his life's work. For instance, he quotes Garp's consideration of the lack of social value in art: "Art doesn't help anyone.... People can't really use it: they can't eat it, it won't shelter or clothe them-and if they're sick, it won't make them well" (179-80). Irving's narrator, using the language of the biographer, quotes written records as evidence for his claims about Garp's life and discusses his aesthetic philosophy. Harter and Thompson refer to "the tone and technique of the objective biographer who deftly sketches . . . in matter-of-fact, even journalistic form" the first two pages of the novel (85).6 This is the language of memory that Garp strives to keep to a minimum in his fiction. Beneath the surface of this biographical style, however, the narrator tends to manipulate the text with the techniques of a fiction writer.7 Influenced by Garp's language, the narrator uses figurative language, creates a persona, adopts a comic and satiric approach, and writes in the present tense. These are indications of the 466</page><page sequence="11">JOHN IRVING'S DOUBLE DISCOURSES influence of Garp's language on the narrator's. This imaginative language is the one that Garp strives to make dominant in his own work. Rather than simply retelling events as they occurred, a method Garp as fiction writer tries to avoid, but a method the biographer would not normally avoid, the narrator uses the fictional methods of foreshadowing and withholding information. For instance, the narrator foreshadows the car accident when he describes Garp's driveway trick. If Garp knew the children were sleeping upon his return home at night, he would turn off the car's engine and the lights and coast up the driveway, using the momentum from the descent of the road leading to it. Helen called this practice "puerile and dangerous" (224), a comment that stays with the reader. In further preparation for the accident's outcome, the uncovered metal shaft of the Volvo's stick shift has been described at some length and mentioned frequently. As a result, as soon as the reader learns that Garp and the boys will arrive home while Helen and Michael are still parked in the dark driveway, he understands the potential for disaster. The narrator as fiction writer adds to the suspense he establishes when he refuses to chronicle the accident immediately. Although we suspect the collision, the chapter ends with Walt's response to the feeling of climbing up the driveway without lights and engine: "It's like a dream!" (266). A few paragraphs into the next chapter, we learn of the injuries to Duncan, Helen, Michael, and Garp. But we don't learn of Walt's death until twenty pages later (284). His role as a fiction writer's biographer also affects the narrator's discourse stylistically. Although he uses few metaphors in the text, compared to many other third-person narrators, he does employ figurative language. The chapter "Second Love, Second Children," for instance, opens with a comic description of Walt's name that as a writer Garp would surely envy: "He was simply a t at the end of a wall. Walt: like a beaver's tail smacking water, like a well-hit squash ball" (152). The narrator has the advantage of distance that allows him to apply figurative language to his depiction of Duncan's lost eye, which he describes as "a kind of tidal irrigation of the hole where Duncan's right eye had been" (257). The narrator also knows how to incorporate anthropomorphic images poetically. For instance, when Helen's student hands Garp the note she has written saying that Helen is having an affair with the student's ex-boyfriend, the narrator writes: "The slow unwrapping of the note-so it wouldn't tear-made sounds as crisp as autumn, though all around Garp it was a cold March, the hurt ground 467</page><page sequence="12">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE thawing to mud. The little note snapped like bones as he opened it" (250). And the narrator displays the influence of Garp's language on his own when he uses a metaphor taken from Garp's first short story: "like a bear holding a great trough of food in his forepaws" (257). The narrator also enjoys Garp's Under Toad story. He uses the image as the source of several metaphoric passages: "His voice against the stolid stone buildings bounced back to him like the froggy belching of the Under Toad, the foul and warty beast whose sticky nearness he felt like breath" (345); "The room reeked of toad" (401); "Garp heard the cold hop of the Under Toad thudding across the cold floors of the silent house" (511). After the attack of the woman in the white Saab, "he heard the croak of the vile-tasting Under Toad in his dry throat" (557). Seeming to forget his role as biographer, the narrator allows his voice to invade the text in a manner befitting the narrator in one of Garp's own novels. He makes personal comments and observations and uses exclamation and question marks. For example, he seems to have transported himself to the scene of Garp's early years when, after mentioning the books that Jenny brings into the infirmary annex, he exclaims, "What a wet dream for lovers of literature, to lie sick at Steering! At last, a hospital with something good to read" (28). Only one of two voices could be responsible for such an exclamation: Garp's or the narrator's. Since there is no suggestion that Garp has taken charge of the narration, one must assume that the narrator has appropriated Garp's language. The same is true when the narrator describes the scene of the cannon: "Hundreds of prophylactics! A display of arrested reproduction. Like dogs urinating around the borders of their territory, the boys of the Steering school had left their messes in the mouth of the mammoth cannon guarding the Steering River" (71). This is a passage that the writer of The World According to Bensenhaver might have written with some pride. In addition to these signs of the narrator's other voice, he joins in the narrative as only a homodiegetic narrator could. For instance, he says of Garp's and Alice's lovemaking, "And they made love, of course, and despite what everyone knows about such things, it was special" (156). The narrator also suddenly speaks openly to the reader as he has not before. He writes of Garp's conflict with the Ellen Jamesians, "They let Garp seethe. What else could they do? It was not one of Garp's better points: tolerance of the intolerant. Crazy people made him crazy" (386). Not only can the narrator use the language that Garp struggles to master as fiction writer, but he can also analyze from an objective distance. Not unlike Garp's voice as we know it from his fiction, the 468</page><page sequence="13">JOHN IRVING'S DOUBLE DISCOURSES narrator's voice is often comic and satiric. For instance, when Garp realizes that the old man he finds in the park is not the one who raped the young girl, the narrator describes the man as the one "whose mustache had been innocent" (145). In a satiric tone, the narrator discusses the effect of the car accident on Michael: "Helen may have supposed that biting off three quarters of a student's penis was fairly high on the scale of conceivable abuse to students" (270). Similarly, when Garp feels that he is finished as a writer but might be a marriage counselor, the narrator echoes Garp's comic idea by using that image of Garp in the chapter entitled "The Eternal Husband": "Garp the marriage counselor, full of advice" (183); and "The marriage counselor is the I'm-sorry man, like a doctor with bad luck-the one who gets to diagnose all the terminal cases" (183). But one of the narrator's favorite Garp-like touches is his use of Alice Fletcher's speech impediment: "Garp knew about writers who couldn't white" (154); "The good-byes that Garp imagined conducting with Alice were violent scenarios, fraught with Alice's incoherent speech and always ending in desperate lovemaking-another failed resolution, wet with sweat and sweet with the lush stickum of sex, oh yeth" (157); "Did Garp love Alice? Oh yeth" (157); and "She couldn't thtop" (158). Ironically, the narrator makes a point of letting us know that Garp's saying "I've thtopped" is a "short, cruel imitation of poor Alice Fletcher" (170). When the narrator shifts into the present tense for the first half of the chapter entitled "Mrs. Ralph," he breaks most profoundly from the biography he began and adopts not only the voice of Garp's fiction but also its tense. Garp's "Vigilance," for instance, uses the present tense. The narrator's present-tense segment follows Garp's narration of Walt's bedtime dog story, in the chapter entitled "The Dog in the Alley, the Child in the Sky." It is as if the tense shift were the narrator's response to his relative silence in that chapter (it takes less involvement to record his character's speech than it does to describe the character's feelings, thoughts, and actions). With the change in tense come a new perspective and voice. The segment opens with these metaphors: "Like a gunman hunting his victim, like the child molester the parent dreads, Garp stalks the sleeping spring suburbs, green and dark; the people snore and wish and dream, their lawn mowers at rest" (199). Clearly the suburban scene and the mock-heroic tone present an image that the writer of "Vigilance" might employ, but this voice is the narrator's. Indeed, in the opening paragraphs of the segment, the narrator makes the fabricator's language his own. For instance, he describes Mrs. 469</page><page sequence="14">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE Ralph's breath as "a startling mixture of a fresh-cut lawn and cigarettes" (200). The scene in her kitchen receives similar treatment: There is a litter of dishes in the sink, a bottle of gin on the kitchen table, the sour smell of slashed limes. The cord to the overhead light . . . had been substantially lengthened by one sheer leg and hip of a woman's pair of panty hose.... The nylon foot, spotted with translucent stains of grease, dangles in the breeze above the gin. (200) Secure in this voice, the narrator even invents a word: "In the blackened houses an occasional dog snorfles" (200). And, like a good fiction writer, the narrator makes sure he connects images in this segment with previous chapters. So we find that he returns to Garp as "the marriage counselor" (206), the "marriage-counsel man" (205). No longer does the tense separate the narrator from Garp's world, Garp's language. Once Garp is shot, the narrator as biographer would have to depend on the words of those close to Garp to complete his life story. But the narrator as fiction writer does not have that limitation. In fact, he can apply imagination and phrase Garp's last thoughts, revealing his psychological affinity: "If he could have talked, he would have told Helen not to be frightened of the Under Toad anymore. It surprised him to realize that the Under Toad was very familiar-as if he had always known it, as if he had grown up with it" (575). The narrator pursues fictive techniques to such an extent that he even records Garp's thoughts in interior monologue: "Don't worry-so what if there is no life after death? There is life after Garp, believe me. Even if there is only death after death ... be grateful for small favors.... Oh yeth, as Alice Fletcher would have said." (576). Certainly, the narrator has not used a biographical source for those words. Yet in the final chapter, "Life After Garp," the narrator again employs a clearly academic language, ending his study in the biographer's language even though he has not always relied solely on biographical techniques. The first sentence of the chapter sets a tone for the conclusion of the text: "He loved epilogues, as he showed us in 'The Pension Grillparzer.'" The final chapter allows the biographer to discuss openly the conflict in Garp's writing between memory and imagination. Analyzing Garp's conflict, the narrator writes, "He had been too impressed by what he now called the 'mere accidents and casualties of daily life, and the understandable trauma resulting therefrom'" (405). In other words, he has been unable to leave his life out of his fiction. But his last work of fiction brings a clearer vision. Although Garp does not complete My Father's Illusions, the narrator tells 470</page><page sequence="15">JOHN IRVING'S DOUBLE DISCOURSES us that "Because he was inventing a father, Garp felt more in touch with the spirit of pure imagination that he felt had kindled 'The Pension Grillparzer'" (405). Garp dies, then, on the verge of reaching his full growth as a writer. As Irving's novel moves toward its conclusion, it becomes clear that Garp needs some of the language of memory in his fiction to make it vivid, and the narrator needs some of the language of imagination in his biography to make it whole. At first Garp uses imagination like an artist; at first the narrator uses facts like a biographer. Yet just as Garp progressively relies more on autobiography until it threatens to overwhelm his creative ability, the narrator relies more on fictional techniques until they threaten the factual account of the life he relates. Finally, both writers resolve their aesthetic conflicts. As a result, Garp's Bildung becomes a kind of return to where he began with "The Pension Grillparzer," in which he used imagination to control memory. And, conversely, the narrator returns to using memory to control imagina- tion, his initial narrative stance. In this way, Irving shapes a narration that re-creates the hero's struggle between the forces of memory and imagination, a struggle that represents a large part of Garp's Bildung as a writer. But The World According to Garp's continual debate about the value of the two languages ends as it begins: in the dialogue between them, art finds its form. After Garp, Irving continues his interest in the Bildungsroman as well as his interest in the relation between the story and its narration. In The Hotel New Hampshire, Irving's first-person narrator seems to have learned Garp's lesson about using imagination when rendering the facts of one's life. In fact, when John writes, "But the first of my father illusions was . . . " (62), recalling the novel Garp is writing when he dies entitled My Father's Illusions, Irving seems to suggest a relation between these two fictional creations. Trained in the search for literary patterns and parallels, John extends that training to his life, which he presents as a "story," a fairy tale, to be precise. For instance, while the family's reading of The Great Gatsby might be a biographical fact within the realm of the novel, it is John's imagination that seeks out and establishes parallels between Gatsby and his father. And although his father has relatively little direct discourse in the novel, John, desiring to show him as the hero of the family tale, often "reads" him as a third-person omniscient narrator might: Father looked at Franny. It reminded me of the looks he occasionally gave mother; he was looking into the future, again, and he was looking for forgiveness-in advance. He wanted to be 471</page><page sequence="16">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE excused for everything that would happen. It was as if the power of his dreaming was so vivid that he felt compelled to simply act out whatever future he imagined-and we were being asked to tolerate his absence . . . from our lives, for a while. (243). John also analyzes other people in his life as if they were truly characters, rather than real people in the real life he purports to be telling. For example, after establishing the idea that the whores and the radicals in Vienna treated him well, John says that "despite their day-and-night differences, they bore more similarities to each other than they might have supposed" (221). But John's vision of his life as a fictional construct prompts him not only to note but also to develop such similarities. With John as narrator, Irving provides, once again, a narrative that represents in its style the major concerns of the text, in this case the creation of a text that resembles a Gatsby-like American dream. Cider House Rules, Irving's next novel, centers on an entirely different set of motifs from his previous novels, but the tension between imagination and biography remains, along with the attendant narrative approach. Indeed, this text represents a combination of the techniques in Garp and Hotel. Just as the narrator in Garp quotes from Garp's journal and Jenny's novel, this third-person narrator regularly quotes from Dr. Larch's notebooks, thereby layering a second voice into the text: " 'Here in St. Clouds,' Dr. Larch wrote in his journal, 'we have only one problem'" (34). This narrator also involves himself in the telling, showing his proximity by the use of exclamation marks and the adoption of the character's language. Apparently enjoying Irene's fear of her husband, who is unrecognizable either as himself or as a human, dressed as he is in a beekeeper's suit, the narrator writes, "No doubt this was what had been molesting the hives! The ghost of a beekeeper of bygone days!" (156). And suspending time in order to heighten his images, this narrator, like the narrator of Garp, calls attention to his power over the textual world. At the end of chapter four we are shown by way of their shadows reaching across a field behind the orphanage that Homer is now taller than Larch. As if the narrator has stretched that image through space and time, several pages into the next chapter the station master sees "the towering shadows of Wilbur Larch and Homer Wells" (166). And just as John in Hotel explores the connections between his story and Gatsby, this narrator continually weaves in references to David Copperfield and Jane Eyre, other novels in the Bildungsroman tradition, thereby establishing parallels between Homer and David, Wally and Steerforth, Melony and Jane, and Homer and 472</page><page sequence="17">JOHN IRVING'S DOUBLE DISCOURSES Rochester. Combining the allusiveness to similar novels and the layering of narrative voices, Cider House Rules is evidence of Irving's continuing growth as a storyteller. The narration of A Prayer for Owen Meany, Irving's latest novel, shows the author experimenting still further with the relationship between narrator and text. Owen, the focus of the first-person narrator's, Johnny's, memoir, is said to have an extraordinary memory, but memory is also the narrative method which shapes Johnny's text and adds layers to his discourse. In one example Johnny juxtaposes the town's production of A Christmas Carol and his memory of the baseball game that kills his mother. After quoting Christmas Past's warning to Scrooge, the narrator leaps into memory, writing, "With a shudder I realized that it had been my father in the bleachers--it had been my father she waved to the instant she was killed" (238). The number of pages given to the brief episode of his mother's death is inordinate to actual time, but memory works by selectively expanding and contracting time. Similarly expanded is the Christmas Pageant, in which Owen plays the Christ Child, and the Christmas Carol, in which Owen plays the Ghost of the Future, events which establish Owen's "special" quality. Irving's text gains another layer of memory, therefore another voice, when Johnny weaves more than twenty-five of his present-tense diary entries into his past-tense text. The three selves, shown in memories reached through events in the past time of the narrative, in memories reached through the present time of the narration, and in journals representing the present time of the narration, are juxtaposed via this narrative. The coexistence of those selves suggests the influence that the past has on the present and that memory has on the individual, major themes in the novel. Irving's handling of the narration is clearly essential to his success as a writer. In A Prayer for Owen Meany the elongated layers of memory that are punctuated by diary entries provide the perfect narrative vehicle for a text concerned with time and memory. The power of the third-person narrator in Cider House Rules, as seen in the manipulation of time, the proximity to the characters, and the weaving in of journal entries, enables Irving to shift from subjective to objective vision, a movement that supports that novel's theme of one's responsibility to others. In The Hotel New Hampshire the first-person narrator's presumed task doesn't give him the power of the narrator in Cider House Rules, but he claims the freedom of a third-person narrator anyway, a fitting approach for his American fairy tale. As we have seen in some detail, the narration of Garp re-creates the character's conflict as a writer 473</page><page sequence="18">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE through its use of incorporated genres, manipulated tense, and shifting proximity to the characters. On the other hand, Irving's The 158-Pound Marriage lacks the techniques displayed in the other novels, resulting in a single-level narrative without the force to give substance to the characters portrayed. Yet in the earlier novel The Water-Method Man the mix of voices, incorporated genres, and tense shifts provides a suitably fractured surface with which to portray its main character. Even in his first novel, Setting Free the Bears, Irving found that incorporated genres present other voices that can serve any number of relationships to the main voice, allowing the novelist to accent theme through narrative style. Irving's power to create fascinating plots has long been accepted; these plots depend to a large extent, however, upon a handful of narrative techniques and the layers of discourse they bring to the text. NOTES Lounsberry notes the literary excesses of "reality (nonfictional fact) and imagination (fiction)" in the novel (33). 2 See Bakhtin's discussion of the three major means of stratifying the language of the novel: hybrid construction (304), character influence (316), and incorporating genres (320). 3 See Cosgrove for a different vision of Irving's use of these materials: "In remarkable and original fashion Irving uses quotations from Jenny's autobiography and her son's later writings to intrude comments on characters and events throughout the novel. These intrusions offer judgments which are often surprising and at odds with the present narrative, but which the reader is obliged to accept until he can know better" (53). 4 Doane and Hodges do not think that Irving's Garp finally supports the feminist ideals it contains. Using the same conflict that this chapter develops, they cite the fact that only Garp's male writing is imaginative, while all the female writing in the book, Jenny Fields's, for example, is "unlike art" because it "can only catalog experience . . . and render this personal experience in a literal-minded way" (67). Similarly, Carton writes, "The individuality of Jenny Fields-like every expression of what passes for feminism in The World According to Garp-finally accommodates rather than challenges a masculinist ideology and model of the self and reinforces the association of sex with violence on which it is based" (53). 5 Although Dickstein considers Garp weakened by Irving's lack of distance from the clearly autobiographically based character, he does credit Irving for these "big chunks of Garp's fiction" that "evidence more invention and less autobiography than Irving's own novel" (399). 6 In fact, Harter and Thompson provide convincing evidence that the narrator is Donald Whitcomb, the author of Garp's official biography Lunacy and Sorrow (87). Although I am satisfied with isolating the aspects of the narration in which the narrator uses the language of the biographer, without 474</page><page sequence="19">JOHN IRVING'S DOUBLE DISCOURSES needing to identify him, I might add to their evidence the fact that Whitcomb is the only one whose death is not recounted in the epilogue to the book. 7 Cosgrove has a different interpretation of the narrator's manipulation, humor, and uncertainty: "The narrator does not seem sure whether the events are serious, or funny, or vulgar, or all three at once in the mode of black humor" (54).
