CURRENT ITEMS THE HUMAN ECOLOGICAL APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF POPULATION DYNAMICS Krishnan Namboodiri Abstract: In this paper, I begin with a brief sketch of the history of human ecology. I then point out that its problems are more complex than those of general ecology and review some basic features. A discussion of how the demography of households can be approached from an ecological perspective follows, then I outline ways to improve the formal and methodological aspects of human ecology. To conclude the paper, I argue that demographers could gain by thinking in human-ecological terms. Textbook definitions of ecology vary somewhat, but in essence they say that ecology concerns interconnected populations of organisms interacting with their environments, and not the behavior and biology of individual living forms. Human ecology is a specialization of ecology, tailored to suit the characteristic features of human populations'. The various aspects of population dynamics are of central concern to human ecology, as they are to demography, but the two disciplines differ widely in their theoretical orientations. Human ecology operates from within a unique theoretical framework, while demography commonly adopts an eclectic style. That human ecology provides demography with a much-needed elegant binder has been repeatedly pointed out in the literature (Duncan 1959; Namboodiri 1988). To what extent have demographers adopted human ecological thinking in their theoretical and empirical explorations? The answer to this question depends upon how broadly one conceives human ecology and demography. Suppose human ecology refers to all studies of social dynamics that use competition as the engine of change or all studies that use a macroscopic, materialistic orientation. Similarly, suppose the scope of demography is widened to include studies of populations of any kind, e.g., small groups, formal organizations, etc. Then it would be no exaggeration to say that a great number of demographic studies use a human ecological orientation. On the other hand, if one restricts the scope of human ecology to that described in Hawley (1950, 1986) and of demography to the scientific study of the structure and dynamics of human populations, then it seems that human ecology has not been popular among demographers2. This essay focuses on human ecology as set forth in Hawley (1950, 1986) and Duncan (1959, 1964). Some of the other conceptualizations of human ecology will, however, be referred to briefly when I outline the historical background. This review begins with a brief sketch of the bio-ecological framework, introducing the distinction between population ecology and community ecology. Bio-ecology is an important subdiscipline of biology, but its subject has never been as complex as that of human ecology. Of necessity, human ecologists developed their own theoretical framework distinct from that of bio-ecology. I summarize the history of human ecology, and emphasize two phases, the initial one during which the so-called Chicago School, with its emphasis on spatial patterns of human phenomena, dominated the field, and the succeeding one, in which a reorientation took hold that emphasized the organizational aspects of population dynamics (Hawley 1950, 1986; Duncan 1959, 1964).

In the final section of the essay, I return to the spatial concern of human ecology and place it in a broader context. With that background, I discuss a few features of human ecology that raise questions about certain popular demographic research strategies. I conclude by stating why I believe it is fruitful for demographers to think in human- ecological terms. Background General Ecology There are those who believe that human ecology would benefit from remaining within the general framework of bio-ecology (Siegel 1984), but others do not think so (Hawley 1986). It is instructive, therefore, to take a brief look at bio-ecology. Some textbooks on ecology written for biologists (Begon, Harper, and Townsend 1986) state that ecology deals with three levels of concern: organisms, populations (each consisting of individuals of the same species), and communities (each comprising an assemblage of interacting species and the relationships that bind them). Other textbooks (e.g., Stiling, 1992) add a fourth level, that of the ecosystem--a biotic community and its abiotic environment viewed as a single complex whole3. At the first level, ecology concerns how individual organisms are affected by and how they affect their biotic and abiotic environments. The term autecology 4 is sometimes applied to this study. At the population level, the concern is with the abundance or rarity of a particular species, territorial differences in this respect, and factors affecting changes in these over time, including different types of interactions (e.g., predation, competition, parasitism, and mutualism) among species that live together in a territory. The ecological community is viewed not simply as a species mosaic but a dynamic interdependent system of populations. The main features include its composition (the species present and their relative abundance or rarity), the nature and form of the relationships among the species, and territorial differences and temporal variations in these. Studies at the community level have been mostly descriptive for a long time, but during the last two decades community ecology has become highly sophisticated with respect to data collection and analysis and formal modeling (Putman 1994). Two approaches have been adopted in the study of community ecology. The reductionist approach focuses on the dynamics of individual single-species populations, concentrating on factors affecting the population dynamics, including the various interactions (predation, competition, etc.) that link the focal population with other populations. The alternative, holistic approach involves the study of the community in its entirety. Population interactions receive attention in this approach also, but it includes many other things such as: 1. Explanations for the broad association between kinds of environments and kinds of communities around the world (e.g., that between tropical climates with high rainfall throughout the year and what are known as tropical rain forests.) 2. Food web patterns (Cohen, Briand, and Newman 1990) and internal structure within food webs (Pimm and Lawton 1980; Pimm, Lawton, and Cohen 1991). 3. Niche packing and community structure (defining an organism's niche in terms of its address, i.e., the types of assemblage in which it might be found; and by its role in the community, i.e., its pattern of utilization of resources and its interaction with other organisms over the use of those resources). 4. Species composition and its determinants, considered by some as the central</page><page sequence="4">519 problem of community ecology (Roughgarden and Diamond 1986). A particular concern is why of all those species that have the appropriate physiological machinery to cope with a given environment, only a small subset is usually found in that environment. 5. The problem of equilibrium: do communities ever reach equilibrium or is the gradual process of adjustment toward a steady state always interrupted before the steady state is reached? Much of the ecological theory of the 1960s and 1970s took it for granted that most of the communities studied were in equilibrium. (For opposing views on the matter see Miller 1982; Wiens, et al. 1986; and Chesson and Case 1986). 6. Species diversity (number of species present and their relative sizes) and the factors that influence it. This includes the productivity of the community (the rate at which energy is bound or matter is combined into organic compounds by organisms per unit of time per unit of area. For a review see Brown 1981. Also see Begon, Harper, and Townsend 1986, pp. 784-813). 7. Stability or sensitivity to disturbance (constancy of structure and function, the ability to resist external perturbations, the ability to continue to function after perturbation, and the speed of return to the pre-perturbation state.) In the 1950s and 1960s the conventional wisdom in ecology was that increased complexity brought with it increased stability (Elton 1958; MacArthur 1955). A widely shared view now seems to be that the relationship between complexity of a community and its inherent stability is not clear-cut and that it varies with such factors as the precise nature of the community, the way in which the community is perturbed, and the way stability is assessed (Begon, Harper, and Townsend 1986, p. 772). Turning to ecosystem ecology, it covers all the topics mentioned under community ecology and additional ones concerning relationships with the environment. Particular emphasis is given to energy flows. The common currency of energy or nutrients allows the comparison of the biology of communities and populations between and within trophic levels (such as in a food chain). It is believed that the ecosystem approach, focusing on energy flows, provides considerable insight into the structure and functioning of biological communities, thereby helping the development of general theories of communities (Stiling 1992, pp. 368-9). Over the past two decades impressive progress has been made in the study of ecology at the population and community levels. Sophisticated modeling techniques have been developed to handle complex interrelationships. It is widely believed that such developments have produced tremendous advances in biologists' understanding of population and community ecologies (Putman 1994, p. x). Undoubtedly, some of the conceptual developments and modeling techniques of bio- ecology apply equally well in human ecological studies. But as will become clear later on, human ecologists have to deal with more parameters than bio-ecologists do. In particular, the virtual unboundedness of the number and variety of human organizations and of technological change possibilities make the problems studied in human ecology quite different from those in bio-ecology. The Checkered History of Human Ecology There is no consensus regarding when human ecology was first recognized as a scientific discipline5. Clement (1905), one of the founders of plant ecology in the United States, viewed sociology as the ecology of humans, and hence, a close relative of plant and animal ecology. The British Ecological Society at its first Summer Meeting in 1914 viewed ecology as a broad field, "including human ecology" (McIntosh 1985, p. 302). Adams (1917) exhorted his readers to remember that "the economics of man is a phase of human ecology" (McIntosh 1985, p. 313). Robert E. Park's (1916) article in the American Journal of Sociology about sociological studies of the city "from the point of view of ecology" is believed to have been the take-off piece for a voluminous literature on urban ecology that appeared over the next two decades (Berry and Kasarda 1977, p. 3). This literature was impressive enough to bring the so-called Chicago Ecological School</page><page sequence="5">520 to center stage in American sociology. But, according to Berry and Kasarda (1977, p. 3), that movement breathed its last by 1950. Not everyone agrees with this diagnosis (Guest 1984). In any case, the next phase in human ecology began with the publication of Hawley's influential treatise Human Ecology: A Theory of Community Structure, published in 1950. Some students of human ecology might push back the beginning date of this phase to 1944 when Hawley's article on ecology and human ecology appeared in print. (I am indebted to an anonymous reviewer for this observation.) In his 1950 treatise, Hawley drew heavily on the works of plant and animal ecologists and on the contributions of Park and his colleagues, but he developed a coherent theoretical framework distinct from that of the Chicago School. Whereas Park and his colleagues emphasized spatial patterns of population phenomena, including crime rates and mental disorder, Hawley emphasized human organization. He treated the territorial community as an interdependent whole with a stable structure, or interconnected activity complex, that evolved as the community interacted with its environment. This new approach assumed that the community and its environment provided the smallest ecological system accessible and manageable for observation and analysis (Duncan 1959, p. 682). The emergence of supralocal interdependence was, however, recognized, as was the possibility of eventual global interdependence. Duncan (1959) suggested that the main features of human ecology can be set forth in terms of four referential concepts: population, organization, environment, and technology. The four are frequently referred to by the acronym POET. As mentioned, traditionally, human ecologists have adopted as their unit of analysis a territorial community and its environment. The former stands for a localized population of human beings and the network of relationships (organization) involving its members that provides the population with its sustenance (Hawley 1950, p. 180). Environment includes all external phenomena that influence the population under study. Technology is broadly conceived to include the tools, techniques, methods, procedures, protocols and the like that people employ in producing, distributing, and consuming things. For example, science is a tool to gain knowledge; statistical methods are used to collect and process information; and marriage is a protocol that puts constraints on certain interactions. From here on, I use the term human ecology as set forth in the works of Hawley and his followers6. Since Hawley's 1950 treatise on human ecology appeared in print, the ecological framework has been refined in several ways. But before commenting on the current thinking, it is worth noting that not all social scientists like human ecology, and that it has not become popular among bio-ecologists either. The main objections from social scientists are that economic, cultural, and behavioral dimensions receive inadequate attention (or none at all) in the framework, and that the exclusion of ideational factors such as sentiments, motivation, and values amounts to discarding much of what matters in the study of social phenomena. Berry (1988, p. 139) pointed out, for example, "There is no room in this mechanistic logic for cultures to interpose cognitive screens between environment and behavior. Neither is there room for a society to organize its universe via symbols and myths--no idealism, only materialism." According to Berry and Kasarda (1977, p. 17), economic, cultural, spatial, and behavioral dimensions of social organization must be incorporated into the ecological framework to obtain a fuller understanding of human adjustment to the environment and substantively significant ideational factors should be integrated with basic ecological variables when explaining empirical phenomena. The reason for the lack of attention from plant and animal ecologists perhaps has been that this particular brand of human ecology was not developed strictly within the bio-ecology framework, but instead with an emphasis on what is special about the human situation7. To some observers (Hawley 1986) it was inevitable that human ecology, in building its conceptual framework, drifted away from the fold of bio-ecology, never to return. There are those who believe that the trend could be reversed (Siegel 1984).</page><page sequence="6">521 Basic Features of Moder Human Ecology Informative discussions of different aspects of human ecology can be found in Bidwell and Kasarda (1985), Bogue and Bogue (1976), Bogue and White (1984), Bogue and Hartman (1990), Duncan (1959, 1964), Frisbie and Kasarda (1988), Gorey (1993), Hawley (1986), Kasarda and Crenshaw (1991), Micklin and Choldin (1984), and Namboodiri (1988, 1994), among others. The most current and systematic exposition of the theoretical framework of human ecology is in Hawley (1986). Some features of current thinking, drawing heavily on Hawley (1986), are highlighted below. 1. The interaction of the population-organization duo with the environment produces outcomes that enable the population to modify the environment as necessary, using existing technology, to obtain sustenance, to learn about itself and about the secrets of the universe at large, and to progressively expand its collective life. Incidentally, it is postulated (see note 1) that human beings have an inherent tendency to expand life to the maximum possible under prevailing conditions (Hawley 1986, p. 5; Simon 1962). In this context, it should be emphasized that expansion of life has qualitative and quantitative dimensions. Increases in numbers or in longevity, and occupancy of wider geographic territories illustrate quantitative aspects of expansion. Absence of disease and infirmity, and departure from optimal physical and mental well- being illustrate the qualitative dimension. Generally speaking, any qualitative or quantitative enhancement of the scope of the art of living can be regarded as an expansion of life. 2. Two comments about the referential concepts of the POET complex deserve to be added to those made earlier: (i) from the human ecological point of view, population and organization each enter into the other's definition. A population is a collection of people engaged in a network of relationships (organization) in which each part is connected directly or indirectly; organization is a network of relationships among the people, created and run by the people for their benefit8; (ii) environment, broadly conceived as everything that is external to and influential, actually or potentially, on that which is environed, is to be redefined with each change in the population-organization duo. Thus, for hunter-gatherers the coal deposits under their feet are of no relevance. For a truly isolated village, what goes on elsewhere in the world does not matter much. For a moder-day metropolis, on the other hand, its backyard consists of practically the entire world. 3. The human ecological framework pays considerable attention to the question of appropriate unit of analysis for investigating a given problem. As already mentioned, earlier investigators tended to focus on the city (Park, Burgess, and McKenzie 1925) or the community (McKenzie 1933; Hawley 1944, 1950, 1971). But as Zimmer put it, the current thinking is that the theory applies to any system of relationships ranging from dyads to the world system (Zimmer 1988, p. 135), provided that it has or is in the process of attaining unit character (see below). Hawley (1986, p. 74) has suggested a typology of units, based on a two-way classification: unifying principle (familial, territorial, associational) by relational structure (corporate--based on differences, or categoric--based on similarities). Thus, households are familial-corporate units, a tribe is a familial-categoric unit, a professional organization is an associational-categoric unit, and a government is an associational-corporate unit. 4. Unit character implies, among other things, the existence of a boundary between the focal entity and its environment. The boundary of a territorial community is commonly fixed by the maximum distance of routine movement to and from the center (Hawley 1950, p. 246). The assumption is that interactions occur much more frequently within the community thus demarcated than between entities within and those outside the boundary9. The boundaries of units such as families, guilds, and trade unions are fixed in terms of specific membership criteria (Hawley 1986, p. 70). 5. Unit character is a property that applies also to populations, irrespective of whether the reference is to human individuals or complex entities such as households, corporations, or trade unions. How does one determine whether a given aggregate of</page><page sequence="7">522 entities has unit character? One way to do this is by determining whether a necessary condition is satisfied, namely, whether there is at least one organization (network of relationships) to which they all belong. This criterion is usually satisfied, as far as human individuals are concerned, in terms of membership in a territorial community such as a village or city. 6. Obviously, populations are hierarchically arranged with respect to membership in territorial units: for example, local communities are nested within regional communities. Hierarchy in terms of time scale, that is with respect to the periodicity of interactions, has received relatively less attention from human ecologists, although it is presumed that the interactions within local communities recur with much higher frequency than do interactions between communities. In contrast, bio-ecologists have given a great deal of attention to hierarchy in terms of time scale, based on the notion that levels of organization are ordered by the frequency of the return time for the critical behavior of the entity in question, higher levels having a longer return time, i.e., behaving at a lower frequency and constraining lower levels (Allen and Hoekstra 1992, p. 30). 7. Questions regarding changes in size, composition, and spatial distribution, and components of such changes (fertility, mortality, migration, and social mobility) are regarded as most relevant when they refer to populations with, or in the process of attaining, unit character. Changes in population are believed to correspond to changes in the population requirements of systems. Viewed in this way, migration is believed to correspond to a redistribution of opportunities (for participation as producers and consumers); and reproduction is assumed to be a contribution to replacement and growth requirements (Hawley 1986, p. 19). When territorial communities and other population segments become tightly interconnected with each other, the corresponding differentials in migration, fertility, mortality, and social mobility are expected to progressively diminish. Research Questions The basic features of human ecology can be highlighted also by examining the human ecological approach to various research questions. I focus on a few questions that interest demographers, using three for illustration: one concerning changing population size and its implications, one concerning population composition, and one concerning population distribution. It is not my intention herein to provide an exhaustive review of the literature under any of these. Excellent reviews are available in Gorey (1993), Frisbie and Kasarda (1988), and Micklin and Choldin (1984), the last covering the whole field of sociological human ecology. Changing population size and development:. Human ecologists expect a close correspondence between "opportunities for living" and population size (Hawley 1950, p. 149; Frisbie and Poston 1975, p. 773; Poston 1984, p. 335). But on closer examination, it becomes clear that this relationship is complex. The labor force requirement may in fact decline with growth and development of the productive sector (Hawley 1986, p. 114, citing Hirschman 1958, p. 181), for example, through increased efficiency of labor productivity and mechanization. Reduction in labor force requirement does not translate automatically into a corresponding reduction in the population requirement, however, because the population's consumer role continues to be a strong stimulant and a forcible constraint on production. Producers of goods and services go out of business if there is not enough demand for their wares, and where there is demand for something, there is a strong likelihood that some producer will come forward to provide it. Consistent with the expansion postulate, it seems reasonable to assume that a given number of consumers could support investment in an ever-increasing level of production of goods and services, provided that the increase is primarily with respect to the quality of products rather than just quantity. Thus growth and development conceivably may occur with no change in population size. The upshot is that there is no universally</page><page sequence="8">523 applicable simple relationship between growth and development of the production sector and changing population size. (For a review of the related demographic literature see Kelley 1988; for a discussion of the effect of indigenous labor supply on net migration, see Poston and White 1978, and Ervin 1987; and for an empirical examination of the relationship between sustenance organization and population change, see Frisbie and Poston 1975). Population composition: A number of human ecologists have contributed to the analysis of population composition in their study of the division of labor. For reviews of conceptual analyses and operationalization of the division of labor see Clemente (1972); Clemente and Sturgis (1972); Frisbie and Poston (1978); Gibbs and Poston (1975); and Smith and Snow (1976). There is consensus among those writing on the subject that the division of labor involves differentiation and interdependence (Hawley 1950, pp. 182- 205; 1986, pp. 33-8). The latter dimension, however, has received less attention in empirical analyses of the division of labor because of data and measurement problems (Frisbie and Poston 1978, p. 43). Two aspects of differentiation dimensions are usually stressed (Poston 1984): the number of different activities performed (structural differentiation) and the differences in their input structure (distributive differentiation). With respect to the latter, inputs of human resources are commonly the primary focus. Thus, measures of distributive differentiation usually deal with the diversity (degree of departure from even spread) of the activity composition of the labor force (Frisbie and Poston 1978, pp. 47-52). The division of labor among territorial units has also been analyzed by human ecologists. The main focus has not been on the interdependence dimension of the division of labor (see, however, Eberstein and Frisbie 1982), but on the classification of units by activity specialization followed by an examination of the covariates of specialization. A classic example is the Duncan-Reiss (1956) study of social characteristics of urban and rural communities classified by type of functional specialization. In that study the average levels of selected indexes of population composition were examined for possible association with functional specialization of communities. Kish (1954) examined the association of the variability of composition indexes by spatial distance from community center. Seldom, if ever, have analysts treated composition vectors in their entirety. The strategy commonly followed has been to focus on a summary measure calculated from the observed composition vector. That this strategy forces one to sacrifice some available information has not escaped the attention of analysts, but the tendency has been to ignore it soon after acknowledging it. Population distribution: Human ecologists hold that any imbalance between territorial distribution of opportunities and labor force is likely to produce movement of people from areas of diminishing opportunities (Hawley 1950, p. 167-8). Note that the imbalance just referred to pertains to the situation after allowing for new entrants to the labor force in the current period from those born in the respective areas at an earlier time. These are space-specific flows of population in time; survivors of birth cohorts of 15-20 years ago entering the labor force now. Such flows (time-lagged birth flows and associated survival patterns) have to be included in the picture before specifying the imbalance to be rectified via territorial movement. This point has been given some attention in the literature using the concept of indigenous labor force (Ervin 1987 and references cited therein). Time-lagged fertility and mortality differences among communities and the current set of intercommunity migration flows in their entirety must be analyzed together, in order to see how population change corresponds to alterations in opportunity structure in a system of interdependent communities. The usual practice of treating each community as a statistically independent case (e.g., Frisbie and Poston 1976) with its own net migration rate and host of covariates does not do justice to the presumed interdependence of communities and the corresponding complex interactions among population, organization, and environment. A similar observation applies to the common practice of studying areal differences in fertility (Poston 1984, pp. 339-42),</page><page sequence="9">524 which treats fertility rates for different areas as independent of each other. Murdock and his colleagues (Murdock, et al. 1991; Murdock, Hoque, and Backman 1993) have suggested that one way of taking into account the interdependence of areal units such as counties when examining the determinants of net migration rates is to focus on the ecosystem in which the units are embedded. For example, some units might be part of an international ecosystem while others might appear to be involved in intranational ecosystems. When defining membership in an ecosystem, however, it should be recognized that such indicators as trade relations may reveal only direct involvements, and that membership in an international ecosystem may involve indirect relationships. Population distribution has also been studied within territorial communities using the so-called subcommunities as units of analysis (see Choldin 1984 for a review of studies of such units). Choldin (1984, pp. 248-9) has argued that subcommunities qualify to be used as units of analysis in ecological studies because (1) they house workers (provide them with shelter from the elements and from enemies and offer them a place to rest and recuperate between work); (2) they supply the economic system with workers (by socializing children and migrants); and (3) provide the context for the final phase of consumption (cooking and eating) of the products of the economy. It seems to me that for the same set of reasons households are worthy of being treated as units of analysis in their own right (Namboodiri 1994, 240-57). The existence of subcommunities with varying characteristics suggests the utility of a multilevel design for population analysis, with households, subcommunities, communities, and region representing progressively more inclusive levels (Form 1993). Population Ecology Many of the works thus far mentioned fall under community or ecosystem ecology. One development that falls under population ecology concerns the study of formal organizations, such as newspaper organizations, trade unions, and voluntary associations (see especially Hannan and Freeman 1989 and references cited therein). Demographers rarely study populations of organizations, a minor exception being the study of households. As I have argued elsewhere (Namboodiri 1991), however, the demographic perspective can be profitably applied to the study of various kinds of populations, including populations of formal and informal organizations. Of particular interest to demographers is the application of a population ecology orientation to the study of the demography of households. Before commenting on this particular application, I provide a few observations on the population ecology of formal organizations. a field that has received considerable attention in the literature. They serve to highlight the difference between population ecology and human ecology and suggest ways to narrow the gap between the two. Populations of Formal Organizations The population ecology orientation to the study of formal organizations was proposed by Hannan and Freeman in an influential article in 1977. They felt that the then-popular microscopic approaches to the study of organizations were unproductive. They questioned the wisdom of viewing organizations as rational, flexible, and speedy adapters to changing environmental conditions, and of trying to explain the variability in organizational structures in terms of managerial decisions and anthropomorphic behavior of individual organizations. To them, an approach based on ideas borrowed from general ecology and evolutionary theories appeared more productive. The basic question Hannan and Freeman addressed was similar to the basic question of general ecology: How to account for the abundance or rarity of organizations and organizational forms? The answer was sought by examining the environmental conditions affecting the rates of creation and extinction of organizations and organizational forms and the rate at which these forms change, and the interactions that occur within and among organizational populations.</page><page sequence="10">525 Hannan and Freeman felt that other theories of organizations overemphasized adaptive change as a process producing variability in organizational features. To them, the force of inertia was a more potent factor in this connection. Accordingly, they introduced in their theory the following core assumption: the characteristics that locate individual organizations within a population change slowly relative to the processes of interest, and selection processes tend to favor organizations whose core structures are difficult to change quickly (Hannan and Freeman 1989, pp. 66-7). The fact that in plants and animals, membership in a population (species) is determined by an inert genetic code parallels the first part of this assumption. The second part of the assumption holds that organizations with high inertia have a relatively greater chance of being selected (to survive) in a given environmental setup. The opposing position is that units that change their structure as needed to suit changing environmental conditions have a higher chance of survival. The Hannan-Freeman position seems to be that very few organizations are able to change their structures quickly when faced with dramatic changes in their environment, because such fluid organizations are selected out over time. The overemphasis on inertia seems to be misplaced. When a system is growing and becoming increasingly complex, subsystem survival is likely to depend heavily on adaptive capabilities, whereas in stable contexts inertia might be the more beneficial survival strategy (Hawley 1986, p. 80). In empirical studies, the main concern of the Hannan-Freeman approach has been with the demography of organizational populations. Births (foundings and entries), deaths (declarations of bankruptcy, disbandings, mergers, and absorptions), and transformations of organizations are analyzed as events using techniques familiar to demographers. Hazard rates are expressed as functions of observed characteristics of organizations and their environments, unobserved heterogeneity, and measures of time. To illustrate, in analyzing the founding rates of U.S. labor unions during the period 1836-1985, Hannan and Freeman (1989, p. 212) report the results of a model using a number of covariates representing (1) density (the number of unions), (2) environmental conditions, and (3) the number of recent foundings and entries. Drawing on their theory of competitive and institutional processes, Hannan and Freeman hypothesized that there is positive density dependence at low densities and negative dependence at high densities. Following a study by Delacroix and Carroll (1983), it was hypothesized that the founding rate depended, in addition to density and environmental conditions, on the number of recent foundings and entries. Environmental conditions were captured in terms of period effects. Similarly, Hannan and Freeman (1989, p. 284) present results of an analysis of the disbanding rate of labor unions over the period 1836-1985. The effects of age, density, recent failures, organizational characteristics, catastrophes (depression years), periods, and so on are examined in this connection. Interactions within and between populations are sometimes examined using the well-known Lotka-Voltera-type equations. Competition for scarce resources receives considerable emphasis, while other types of interactions are given relatively less attention (Hannan and Freeman 1977). This approach has an elegance of its own, but it also has two major problems. If the aim is to understand the more inclusive system, this approach is of little help. Even when all organizational populations are studied in detail, one does not obtain a picture of the whole entity of which the populations are each a part. Rather, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The situation is not much different even if all possible pairs of populations are examined, emphasizing intra-pair interactions. That approach still leaves out much of the interdependence characterizing the whole. There is another problem. When a single population is the focus, all other populations with which the focal one interacts are lumped together in the focal population's environment. The internal structure of the environment seldom enters the analysis. Thus, when the focus is on labor unions, all other organizations affecting or affected by those unions-the government, political parties, etc.--are in the environment. That those organizations are also interacting is not given any attention in the analysis,</page><page sequence="11">526 yet the influence of the environment on labor unions is a function of the nature of the interactions among the organizations in the environment. When these interactions are ignored or inadequately specified, one is in danger of drawing misleading inferences. Despite these problems, the literature on organizational ecology has amply demonstrated the applicability of many basic ideas of human ecology to the study of organizational populations, which are viewed as cultivating competitive and cooperative interdependence among themselves to cope with and take advantage of their environments by developing and using technology. To me, the output of the organizational ecology literature clearly indicates that there is much to be gained by extending the human ecological framework beyond the study of human populations. What about the problems mentioned above? To avoid them, the populations of interest must be studied within the context of the whole of which they are a part. Even when the focus is on a single organizational population, due recognition must be given to the interactions between that population and relevant others in the ecosystem. A few points on how a human ecologist might approach such an investigation are outlined below. Households as Populations The human ecological framework has not been used frequently in the study of fertility dynamics, and fertility researchers have seldom turned to the framework for guidance in their investigations. This state of affairs is not surprising, because fertility investigations have been predominantly of the micro-level variety, focusing on the fertility preferences and desires of individuals (Poston 1984, p. 340). Those who have looked at fertility from a human ecological perspective have focused primarily on the association between rural and urban residence, place size, nature of sustenance organization (e.g., functional classification of communities), on the one hand, and fertility on the other. For reviews, see Duncan (1959) and Poston (1984). For the examination of the human ecological approach to fertility in a less-developed country see London (1987) and London and Hadden (1989). How would a human ecologist approach the study of the demography of households and treat reproduction as an output of the aggregate (population) of households? Imagine drawing an analogy between a population of organizations (as discussed earlier) and a population (aggregate) of households. Changes in the latter may result from formation, dissolution, or transformation of member households. It should be emphasized that herein the reference is to the formation or dissolution of individual households as members of an aggregate. Speaking of outputs, households shelter their members, provide them with rest and recuperation, and facilitate the consumption of various goods and services. In short, the household imparts a maintenance service to its human members. Households also produce new members of society. Attention will be drawn later to another type of household output (see the section on the input-output approach). With reference to inputs (human and material resources) used in the production of outputs, the aggregate of households competes with other populations. Human individuals spend only part of their time in the household. Some spend a large amount of time at work and others at school. Similarly, other populations use up a large fraction of material resources in their activities. How many resources households gain in this competition is a function of the dominance structure involving households and other production sectors. In some contexts, such as in preindustrial rural villages, households enjoy high priority; in highly industrialized societies, their claim on resources is probably heard after all others. The input structures differ for the two mentioned outputs of the household population. The production of new human resources requires the investment of human and material resources over a lengthy period. The length of the period involved and the volume and composition of inputs are associated with the quality of the final product. For example, the production of a college graduate involves more time and more goods</page><page sequence="12">527 and services than does the production of a high school dropout. Regular servicing of human needs (repeated with more or less fixed periodicity) also requires the use of human resources and other goods and services. The inputs required in this connection depend upon the lifestyle (consumption pattern). From the human ecological perspective, obviously fertility is linked to the production of new entrants to the work force. (Compare this idea with the notion popular among demographers that a couple's fertility is geared to ensuring that a certain number of children survive to adulthood). When a system is in equilibrium 10, the volume of new entrants to the work force corresponds closely to the volume of leavers (Hawley 1986, 41-2). No system is assumed to remain precisely in equilibrium for any length of time. Isolated communities have the greatest chance of being in equilibrium over long periods. But even they fluctuate, sometimes widely. Imbalance in numbers between exits and potential or actual new entrants may occur during growth and contraction periods. If migration between two societies is free, the flow between them will be significant only when the sending country is in a contraction period while the other is expanding (Hawley 1950, p. 330). It should be emphasized, however, that expansion need not necessarily translate into an increase in the labor force requirement. The linkage between the two is conditioned by the nature of the associated technological change and alterations in lifestyle. New entrants to the work force in a given community obviously could be either produced within or recruited from outside. In fact, there are those who hold that external recruitment is more efficient (Poston 1984, p. 341; Sly 1972, p. 618). This way of thinking imparts inadequate attention to the interdependence between the community that supplies migrants and the one that receives them. Unless the migration in question is an isolated affair, the interdependence of the communities serves as the setting for reproduction, socialization, and training of the young in all the member communities. In such circumstances it does not make sense to regard reproduction within one of the member communities as geared to the human resource requirement of that community exclusively. The household approach to the study of fertility is discussed further in the section on input-output models. Data and Methods Since human ecology holds that wholes function because of the interdependence of their parts, attention is given to (1) the makeup of the parts, emphasizing the relative numbers of different types of them, and (2) the interrelationships among the parts, their structure, working, and the evolution of interdependence (Hawley 1950, p. 206). The simplest part of a whole is a position or status that responds to or evokes response from one or more other positions. A household illustrates a slightly complex part of a very complex whole (e.g., a territorial community). Data for human ecologists come in different forms, primarily as frequency distributions; compositions; sequences of rates, ratios, or proportions; networks of relationships; and presence or absence of an attribute. Examples include distribution of households by income, size-class distribution of places, educational composition of the employees of a city, rates of death (disbanding, merger, absorption) by duration, and classification of rural villages according to presence or absence of a school. Compositions and Distributions A common procedure in empirical analyses is to replace distributions and compositions by summary measures such as means (average income) and proportions (number of workers in the primary sector as a proportion of the total number of workers). That this procedure sacrifices a part of the information available in the data is often recognized, but it is almost always ignored, perhaps because it is easier to work</page><page sequence="13">528 with the simple numbers in summary form than to work with full distributions and compositions, which are vectors of numbers. It has been proposed (Gibbs and Martin 1962) that division of labor be represented in terms of the summary measure obtained by subtracting from unity the ratio of the sum of squares to the squared sum of frequencies in different categories into which individuals or other units have been classified. For a critical review of this and other measures of the division of labor, all of which are summary measures of the frequency distribution just mentioned, see Smith and Snow (1976) and Frisbie (1984). Since there are differences of opinion regarding which summary measure to use for representing division of labor, it is preferable not to use any summary measure at all when examining factors that affect and are affected by division of labor. The statistical literature on compositional analysis provides a way of doing that (see Namboodiri 1994, and the references cited therein, e.g., Aitchison 1986). Segregation analysis provides another example in which multiple indicators have been proposed for representing a given phenomenon. For reviews of a number of measures of segregation see Massey and Denton (1988) and White (1986). Duncan and Duncan (1955), Taueber and Taueber (1965), and Bogue and Bogue (1976) have warned against indiscriminate reliance on any single index to capture the complex phenomenon of segregation. Lieberson and Carter (1982) advised those contemplating the use of a single index in segregation analysis to specify the dimension of segregation they wish to emphasize and then choose an appropriate measure for that dimension. Massey and Denton (1988) suggested five possible dimensions of segregation (evenness, potential exposure, concentration, centralization, and clustering) and indicated which measures currently in use capture which dimension ". Segregation analysis may be thought of as focusing on the association between each entity's spatial location on the one hand, and other traits such as social and economic characteristics on the other. In practice, a study area (for example, a city) is segmented into parcels (census tracts, blocks, or neighborhoods) and the parcel of residence is taken to represent spatial location. This makes spatial location a discrete variable. Segregation analysis thus focuses on the association between this and one or more other discrete variables. For example, a basic question is whether racial or ethnic composition varies across neighborhoods, and if so whether there are characteristics of the neighborhoods, such as distance from the city center, that account for the variation. This is typically a compositional analysis question. See Namboodiri (1994, pp. 21-8) for a discussion of segregation analysis from a compositional-analysis perspective. It should be emphasized that compositional analysis does not sacrifice information available in the data since it is not tied to any particular summary measure, and it translates such segregational dimensions as evenness, concentration, centralization, and clustering into compositional comparisons and contrasts. Levels of Analysis Human ecologists have observed that the strengths of relationships of interest to them are not immune to the unit of analysis used in estimating them. A well-known example is that many of the conventional segregation measures vary in magnitude according to the level of aggregation of the areal units used in their calculation (Taueber and Taueber 1965, p. 230). Kasarda (1974) provided another example, involving the relationship between size and structure of social systems. The literature on the so-called aggregation bias explains why relationships such as the ones just mentioned vary by level of aggregation used in the analysis (Hannan 1971; Cressie 1991). If the magnitude of a relationship varies by the level of analysis used in estimating it, then it follows that one must be cautious in making inferences about lower-level relationships from corresponding higher-level ones (Robinson 1950), except under special conditions (Goodman 1953, 1959; Duncan and Davis 1953; Hannan 1971; and Blalock 1964). For some practical suggestions aimed at detecting and reducing bias in such inferences, see Bogue and Bogue (1976).</page><page sequence="14">529 Hierarchical Models Speaking of levels of aggregation, one could imagine lower-level units nested in progressively higher-level ones: schools nested within school districts, which are in turn nested within states or, in cross-national studies, communities nested within regions, and regions within nations. This type of hierarchical arrangement of units demands attention in certain types of analysis. For example, suppose one is interested in analyzing the distribution of scores received by high school students in a standardized test. Suppose one suspects not only that within each school the test score distribution significantly differs by student's social class (SES), but also that this association between test score distribution and SES background differs across schools. Under such circumstances, it is natural to seek school properties that account for the interschool variation in the relationship just mentioned. Statistical models for studying such issues have come to be known as multilevel (hierarchical, mixed-effect, random-effect, or covariance- component) models (see Goldstein 1987; Wong and Mason 1985; Longford 1987; and Bryk and Raudenbush 1992). Multilevel analysis has been suggested as a useful strategy in the so-called contextual analysis (Boyd and Iversen 1979). In the example just mentioned, the school may be regarded as the context affecting students' achievements. Multilevel designs are appropriate for the study of demographic processes such as fertility and mortality, and compositional differentials including variation in racial differences in income distribution across cities. Also, small-area analyses in human ecology almost always require a multilevel design because the commonly used small areas (e.g., census tracts) do not ordinarily have unit character and are spatially correlated with others of their kind, one of the reasons for the spatial correlation being that the entities in question are parts of a common whole. In multilevel analysis, traditionally the focus has been on the level-specific variation of the study phenomenon. For example, in the study of student achievements, one focuses on the student-level variation within schools, the school-level variation within school districts, the school-district-level variation within states, and so on. The same principle can be applied to the study of variation in distributions. Human ecologists have not taken advantage of this development. Models of Interdependence: Graph Theory Another development that human ecologists could have benefited from, but have not, is graph theory. This is a tool for the analysis of interdependent wholes, their structure, working, and evolution. Many of the concepts developed and propositions listed in Hawley (1986) can be approached from the perspective of graph theory. For an elementary mathematical introduction see Wilson (1985). For a less technical treatment see Knoke and Kuklinski (1982) and Namboodiri (1994, pp. 107-35). Social science applications of graph theory have been surveyed by Roberts (1976), among others. Linkage between organizations (e.g., interlocking directorships) has been studied by Aldrich (1979); and Galaskiewicz and Marsden (1978). Burt (1983) has pursued the idea that an economy is a network of exchange transactions between actors (persons and corporations). Similar to the idea of functional classification of communities (Duncan and Reiss 1956; Duncan, et al., 1960), those using graph theory in the study of interdependence have developed the notion of clustering units into structurally equivalent groups (Burt 1983; Alba 1982; Knoke and Kuklinski 1982). They define a structurally equivalent group as one where all members resemble one another (strictly speaking, are identical) with respect to their relationships to units outside the cluster, no matter what their relationships are to their clustermates. A limitation of this approach is that the intracluster relationships receive no attention. But the idea of analyzing the two-way table of intercluster flow of products to get a handle on the topological network model of social structure should interest human ecologists, given their focus on the fabric of interdependence.</page><page sequence="15">530 Input-Output Models I have argued elsewhere that the use of input-output models helps to make human ecology more elegant as a framework to study interdependence (Namboodiri 1988; 1994). Imagine (see Namboodiri 1994, pp. 187-91) a simple interdependent whole (e.g., a hunter-gatherer group) doing basically three things: food production, reproduction, and maintenance (feeding and sheltering the members). The outputs of these three activities are food, new members, and human resources, respectively. Human resources are represented in terms of person-time rather than head counts, because this helps to deal with the fact that the same person may engage in different activities at different times. Assume that the inter-activity flow of products is as follows: (1) All of the food produced goes to the maintenance activity. In particular, unlike in agrarian societies, no part of it is used for producing food. (2) As soon as new members are ready to carry out one or more of the activities, the maintenance activity takes charge of them. Until then they remain as unfinished products of the reproduction activity. For simplicity, we assume that socialization and training are carried out as part of reproduction. (3) The maintenance activity supplies the human resources needed to carry out each of the three activities. There are thus five flows: from food production and reproduction to maintenance and from maintenance back to each activity, including itself. Notice that in this simple setup, the biotic environment is the sole source of food (game for hunting and fruits and roots for gathering) and human resources are the only input used in procuring food. Notice also that the unit of time has not been specified explicitly. For the present purpose, it is sufficient to keep in mind a time unit such as a calendar year. The technological level can be described in terms of input-output ratios corresponding to each of the five product flows: (1) Food per person-year reaching maintenance activity. (2) The number of new entrants to the work force (new members who are ready to staff the various activities) per person-year. (3) Person-years used in food production per unit food output. (4) Person-years used in reproduction activity per new member. (5) Fraction of total person-years used in maintenance activity. These ratios are labeled technical coefficients. For easy reference, denote these by a(1,3), a(2,3), a(3,1), a(3,2), and a(3,3) respectively, using code 1 for food production, 2 for reproduction, and 3 for maintenance, and a(i,j) standing for the input from activity i to activity j, per unit output of the latter. The first coefficient, a(1,3), should remind one of per capita food production, the second, a(2,3), resembles the rate of new recruitment to the work force, and the last three, a(3,1), a(3,2), and a(3,3), are indicators of the human resource requirements of the three activities involved. If the technical coefficients are time invariant and are independent of the volumes of outputs, the interdependence of the three activities can be captured in terms of an equation system involving the outputs and the technical coefficients. The output of activity 1 equals a(1,3) times the output of activity 3; that of activity 2 equals a(2,3) times the output of activity 3; and that of activity 3 equals a weighted sum of the outputs of the three activities (1, 2, 3), the weights being a(3,1), a(3,2), and a(3,3), respectively. The chief problem with this description is that the environment is ignored. A simple way to bring it in is to assume that it directly affects only the output of the food production activity. A fraction of the food available in the environment is procured by the hunters and gatherers. The rest is retained by the environment itself. It is likely that some of the procured food goes unused. Writing a(4,1) for the ratio of the procured food to the used portion thereof, and a(4,4) for the fraction of food that is retained by the</page><page sequence="16">531 environment, we have a fourth equation to be added to the three-equation system mentioned above: x(4) = a(4,1) x(l) + a(4,4) x(4) where x(4) stands for the output (food) of the environment and x(l) that of activity 1. The four-equation system brings out the effects of changes in the environment on the production, distribution, and consumption within the system of activities in question. Thus, the relationship between x(l) and x(4), from the fourth equation, is: x(1)/x(4) = [1 - a(4,4)]/a(4,1) It follows that, if the technical coefficients remain time invariant and independent of total outputs, the ratio of x(l), the output of the food production activity, declines or increases proportionately with the environmental bounty. The ratio of the output of activity 2 to the environmental bounty is proportional to the ratio x(l)/x(4) and so is the ratio of the output of activity 3 to the environmental bounty. Here then is a description of an isolated system at the mercy of its environment. Each activity within the system is affected directly or indirectly by the environmental output (food, in the present instance). This illustrates the point that the input-output framework can be adapted to the study of even simple situations such as that of a hunting and gathering group that remains in virtual isolation from the rest of humanity. That the framework applies to the economies of advanced societies is, of course, well known. The input-output framework can be used in the study of households, disaggregated into a number of classes to facilitate the study of social stratification (Miyazawa 1976; Namboodiri 1994, pp. 162-75). The implications of this approach that focuses on different strata of households for the study of reproduction remain to be fully worked out. In the analysis of reproduction, it makes sense to regard households as organizational populations that interact with other populations such as hospitals and schools to produce children (1) for consumption--i.e., as a source of pride and joy12, and (2) as future human resources. Human ecologists have emphasized reproduction as the creation of new human resources, but the production of children as an item for the consumption basket has not received the attention it deserves. That people are consumers as well as producers is, of course, emphasized and in that connection one entertains the notion that if there is demand for a product, organizations to produce that product usually emerge. Also, if broadly understood, the postulate of expansion (the notion that humans have a tendency to expand life to the maximum level possible under given conditions) covers the tendency to change the number and variety of the items in the consumption basket and their quality and composition. These considerations apply to the production of children as a consumption item. It should be emphasized in this connection that children are a source of pride not only for their parents but to others as well, including close relatives and friends of the parents'3. Arrangements such as adoption and surrogate-mother services fall within the same framework. Note that the consumption aspect of reproduction is not confined to the infancy of children--it is a lifelong phenomenon. Furthermore, the enjoyment that parents derive from a child depends upon the type of human resource that child turns out to be. For example, children who succeed in life are a source of greater pride and joy to their parents and other relatives than are those who turn out to be problems. To pursue further the idea of disaggrpaotion of households, note that among the relevant stratification variables are (1) the level and composition of resource flows to households and (2) the input structure of their outputs (children as consumption items and as future producers and the daily maintenance of household members). The main question of interest is whether the level or composition of outputs differs from one stratum of households to another.</page><page sequence="17">532 Conclusion In this section I comment on a few features of human ecology; some of which concern agenda items for future work. I have already touched upon a few items (the use of graph theory and input-output models to formalize the theoretical framework, and the adoption of multilevel research designs to take into account the hierarchical arrangements of units). I turn now to the research design issue and put it into a broader context. With that background I comment on a few features of human ecology that raise questions about certain popular research strategies of demographers. First is the research design issue. The human-ecological view of social life as patterned in space and time has important implications for how one collects and analyzes relevant data. When data are patterned in space and time, they cannot be modeled as if the observations are statistically independent, as many analysts are prone to do. Kruskal (1983, p. 933), in his presidential address to the American Statistical Association, suggested that a plausible explanation for the widespread assumption of independence in data is its "seductive simplicity". Be that as it may, human ecological orientation compels analysts to be cognizant of the space-time dependence in their data. An important process that creates such dependence is the flow of goods, people, and information from one location to another, a basic characteristic of interdependent systems. Dependence in data results also from the hierarchical arrangement of complex units, such as households within communities and communities within regions. Then there are repeated, and hence dependent, observations on the same unit, for example, the survival experiences of a mother's infants of successive birth orders (see Guo 1993 for a recent look at this dependence). Statistical inferences based on any analysis of data ignoring spatial-temporal dependence, if present in them, are likely to be misleading (see Cressie 1991, pp. 13-26, for a discussion of this point.) A straightforward way to take into account spatial or temporal dependence in one's data is to explicitly model that dependence. Techniques of time series analysis deal with temporal dependence. Usually it is assumed that observations are equally spaced in time, have identical statistical distribution, and are dependent. Ord (1988a) has given a brief review with key references. Stochastic models for spatial data are of relatively recent origin'4. See Cressie (1991) for a comprehensive treatise. For less technical and quite limited discussions see Boots and Getis (1988); Odland (1988); Morrill, Gaile, and Thrall (1988); and Namboodiri (1991, Chapter 8). Concepts such as spatial autocorrelation, space-time diffusion, and point patterns are used for detecting and modeling departures from the random pattern. An agenda item for future research effort is the development and application of multilevel designs that incorporate spatial correlation among observations at the lower levels. An example of a research question that requires this approach is the following: Imagine modeling the spatial pattern of breast cancer incidence in each U.S. county. The question then is why the model parameters differ among counties; what county characteristics account for the variation? The first part of the investigation requires the use of spatial models. The second part uses multilevel analysis. Human ecology puts constraints on research designs in another fashion. To illustrate, suppose one wants to compare the fertility levels of two parts of a country, say, north and south India. Human ecology requires that in order to make sense, the comparison must take into account the interaction between the two parts and between each and the outside world. Put differently, the two parts are not to be treated as independent entities but as interdependent ones embedded in an environment. I now turn to a few features of human ecology that raise questions about certain popular demographic research strategies. One such feature is the human-ecological position that focusing on individual behavior (birth, death, migration, or change in social status) is unproductive, and the focus should be instead on the distribution of behaviors over a population with unit character or one in the process of acquiring it. Thus, it is meaningful to investigate how the distribution of districts in India by the net</page><page sequence="18">533 reproduction rate has been changing over time, and how those changes have been associated with changes in the interdependence both among the districts and between them and the world outside. It does not make sense to focus on the population dynamics of any single territorial community as if it is a self-sufficient entity when in fact it is not. Associated with the position that focusing on individual-level behavior is unproductive is the human ecologist's lack of interest in micro-level models. Thus, the usual utility maximization models popular among fertility researchers are of little interest to a human ecologist. This does not mean, however, that the decision-making capacity of human individuals is of no concern. The focus on human resources necessarily raises considerations of mental well-being (including the capacity to make rational choices). The macroscopic nature of the human ecological approach has made it unpopular among demographers who prefer microscopic frameworks. The belief that one could easily step into the shoes of the social actor seems to attract many analysts to the microscopic perspective that emphasizes how each individual thinks, feels, and makes choices. To make matters simple, the analyst throws in the postulate of independence. I am not convinced that the preoccupation with microscopic perspectives has improved our understanding of population dynamics. Hirschman (1994) expresses a similar view. It seems to me that demographers stand to gain by investing more of their time and effort in the analysis of macroscopic patterns. In that venture, the human ecological orientation would serve as a valuable guide. Even those who are wedded to microscopic perspectives are likely to benefit from thinking in human ecological terms. Human ecology offers them a systematic way of picturing the macroscopic contexts in which micro-level processes take place. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I am grateful to Edward Crenshaw, Reynolds Farley, William Form, Amos Hawley, Charles Hirschman, Joan Huber, and two anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions on an earlier draft of this essay. NOTES Human ecology postulates that individuals are inherently interdependent, expansive, temporarily constrained, dependent on the environment for sustenance and the knowledge for procuring it, and unlimited in the variability of their behavior (Hawley 1986, pp. 3-6). The first four characteristics are shared with other living forms, but the last one is not. Behavior is treated as an activity patterned by a structure of relationships, and as such is subject to changes within the structure (Hawley 1986, p. 6). The unlimited variability in behavior helps to explain the formation of complex units, cumulative change, and many other aspects of the collective life process (Hawley 1986, p. 126). 2 I hasten to add that demographers such as Frisbie, London, Micklin, and Poston are among the major contributors of demographic studies using an ecological framework. My impression, however, is that micro-level analyses far outnumber macro-level investigations in demography, and that among the latter, those using a human-ecological framework form a minority. This impression is not based on any systematic computer search of the literature. A reviewer has pointed out that a quick search of the current POPLINE CD-ROM revealed enough entries using the human-ecological paradigm to cast doubt on the validity of my impression. 3 There is no universally shared definition of the term ecosystem. It was coined by A. G. Tansley in 1935 to denote a community and its environment forming a single</page><page sequence="19">534 whole. Hawley (1986, p. 26), however, has defined an ecosystem as "an arrangement of mutual dependencies in a population by which the whole operates as a unit and thereby maintains a viable environmental relationship". He thus chose to keep the ecosystem separate from its environment. For a detailed discussion of the evolution of the concept of ecosystem see McIntosh (1985, pp. 193-4; 202-3). 4 The International Botanical Congress in 1910 formally adopted the following distinction between autecology and synecology: "Ecology, the study of conditions of environment and of adaptation of plant species is if taken isolately 'autecology,' if taken in association 'synecology' " (McIntosh 1985, p. 146). Chapman (1935, Animal Ecology, New York: McGraw Hill) confirmed that this distinction applied to animal ecology also and commented that the concern with autecology, which borders on physiology, raised questions about the distinctiveness of ecology as a science. Such questions do not arise with respect to the synecological focus. 5 There is consensus on the position that human ecology, as understood in sociology today, is built on a tradition that began with such luminaries as Durkheim, Marx, and Spencer. The question here, however, is which publication or public pronouncement marked the beginning of human ecology as a distinct scientific specialty. 6 Poston, Frisbie, and Micklin (1984) distinguished four brands of human ecology: (i) the Chicago School; (ii) Hawley's ecosystem theory; (iii) Duncan's ecological complex (POET model); and (iv) the sustenance organization model as developed by Gibbs and his collaborators. The last focuses primarily on the O part of the POET complex. Any activity involving an expenditure of energy in the production of goods and services is a sustenance activity (Poston, Frisbie, and Micklin 1984, p. 109). 7 See note 1. 8 It is not implied here that organization has a definition similar to that of democracy. What is implied is the following: People organize themselves to get certain tasks done--tasks that they cannot carry out working independently of each other; furthermore, there can be no organization if there are no humans to run it; and finally, the output of any organization is for consumption or production, the latter eventually leading to output for consumption. 9 The interaction frequency no doubt is a function of transportation and communication technology. Of all interactions involving the members of a given local community, those among the members of the community make up a very large fraction. Bio-ecologists make a similar point with respect to ecosystem: "Tracers put into an ecosystem will move around inside the ecosystem much faster than they move out of the ecosystem" (Allen and Hoekstra 1992, p. 28). 10 Hawley (1986, p. 22) has pointed out that equilibrium as applied to population has two dimensions: one demographic and the other organizational. Demographic equilibrium obtains when the population growth rate is zero. Organizational equilibrium obtains when the number of units engaged in each function is just sufficient to maintain the relations of each function to all other functions comprising the system. According to Massey and Denton (1988, pp. 283-293), the various dimensions of segregation address the following questions: (i) Are the social groups differentially distributed among areal units? (ii) What is the possibility of interaction or potential contact between minority and majority members within geographic areas? (iii) Is the relative amount of physical space occupied by a given group small (large)? (iv) Is a group spatially located near the center of an urban area? (v) Are the areal units inhabited by a group clustered in space? 12 The new household economics views children as a consumption item, which the household members produce for their enjoyment. Human and material resources are among the inputs. Quality and quantity dimensions are distinguished. The item is not for sale--it is produced solely for the producer's consumption. See, e.g., Willis (1973).</page><page sequence="20">535 13 Compare this view with that of the new household economic model, where the consumer is none other than the producer. 14 I am referring to the application of models of spatial processes to spatial data. As far as I know, this development is relatively recent (Ord 1988b). The techniques for analyzing population distribution that are usually discussed in demographic books are of a different kind.
