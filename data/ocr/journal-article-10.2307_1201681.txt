<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Church, the Spirit, and the Hands of God Joseph Haroutunian [EDITORS' NOTE.-At the time of his sudden death in 1968, Joseph Haroutunian was at work on a major historical and constructive reinter- pretation of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. Had the study reached com- pletion, it would have summed up many years of the author's theological reflection. Extensive manuscript materials in Haroutunian's own hand- writing, consisting either of lecture notes or of drafts specially written, have been assembled from the literary remains and incorporated into a "Harou- tunian Archive" in the Joseph Regenstein Library of the University of Chicago. In the judgment of those who have examined the archive, there would be no possibility of preparing the materials for the kind of book Haroutunian had envisaged. However, to bring the manuscripts to the attention of those who knew him and of future students who might wish to study his ideas further, two excerpts are offered here from what was plainly designed as a draft for the opening chapter, which would have taken up in detail the "model of the two hands of God" proposed by Haroutunian in an article published posthumously. (See "Spirit, Holy Spirit, Spiritism," in A Dictionary of Christian Theology, ed. Alan Richardson [London: SCM Press, 1969], PP- 318-27.) It will be understood that the manuscript from which the excerpts are taken remains an unpolished draft.] Since the intellectual difficulties we have had with the doctrine of the Spirit are largely due to the "models" or basic images theologians have used in trying to understand it, we have found it necessary to search for a new model, or to turn to an old and neglected model, by way of making a fresh start. The old models which we find unsatisfactory were based on notions of God's transcendence and immanence, of theos and logos, which left the place and function of the Spirit in the doctrine of God in a perennial state of uncertainty. Given God the Creator- Redeemer and his act of creation-redemption, God the Revealer and God's self-revelation, God the primary Cause and God as instrumental Cause (the Logos), God in short "beyond" and "God with us," there was no place for a third, the Holy Spirit. Not even the formula "from I54</page><page sequence="2">Church, Spirit, and Hands of God God the Father through God the Son in God the Holy Spirit" could be sustained, because there was no logical need for distinguishing between "through" and "in" as symbols of God's immanence. God, as it were, needed One, the Son, to be transcendent and immanent Cause, but he did not need Another. It is reflection on this basic difficulty in the logic of the Church's faith (that God cannot be without the Spirit any more than He can be without the Son) that turned our attention to Irenaeus's "two hands of God." We are not at this point concerned with the immediate use Irenaeus made of his simile. He was engaged, like other Fathers in the East and West, in combating a type of heresy known as Gnosticism. The Gnostics could not and did not believe that the world, with all its evil and misery, is the creation of a good Deity. They saw a vast chasm between God and the world. They placed God in a transcendent sphere full of good spirits, and they filled the chasm between earth and heaven with a hierarchy of intermediate spirits of evil disposition who were held responsible for the creation of this world in which man is impris- oned. The Gnostics believed that man's deliverance from this world was dependent upon good spirits descending into it and bringing a new kind of knowledge (gnosis). Thus they agreed that God is not the author of evil. But, in so doing, they denied that God is the Creator and in control of this world, as was believed by the Church. And it was precisely the intention of Irenaeus's simile of the two hands to dispense with the elaborate systems of mediation that the Gnostics proposed and to re- affirm the common faith that God, in his lordship over the world, rules it according to his good will and purpose. Obviously, of course, a person has two hands and not one, and it would have been odd to speak of God as having but one hand. Yet it was not simply anthropomorphism which led Irenaeus to speak of the two hands of God. He believed as a Christian that God is the Father of the Son, Jesus Christ. One hand of God, according to the faith of the Church, was the Word, the Logos, who had become incarnate for the salvation of God's people. Indeed, the gospel at the center of the Church's proclamation was that the Word had become flesh, that it was both Lord and Savior, that God had created the world by his Word and reigns as God and King by his Word. Hence the Word was one hand of God, and when Irenaeus spoke of a hand of God he was speaking of the Word or the Son of God. He wanted also, however, to speak of God as having a second hand, and this he conceived to be the Spirit of God. Here he spoke according '55</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Religion to a firmly settled tradition of the Church, for everybody, as it were, knew that where there was the Word there was also the Spirit. The Incarnation of the Word had been the work of the Spirit, as had the founding of the Church. As there was no God without his Word, there was no God without the Spirit. By the Word and the Spirit God had created the heavens and the earth, and by the same two hands He said and did all things as God. It was the faith of the Church taught at baptism and known by the baptized that there was "the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit," and Irenaeus reasonably enough regarded the Son and the Spirit as the two hands of God. Had he been thinking primarily of the transcendence and immanence of God, Irenaeus might have spoken simply of God and logos, and of the latter as the one hand of God. Or, if he had been thinking of the ways in which God is immanent and reveals Himself, he might have spoken of a number of hands, or loci of revelation. He might have spoken of angels, nature, history, Scripture, reason, conscience, and so forth, as biblical theologians have generally done. Indeed, the Gnostics, as they wrestled with the problem of God's presence and hiddenness, had recourse to an indefinite number of intermediates between God and the physical world. But Irenaeus preferred the metaphor of the two hands because neither God's transcendence nor His hiddenness was to Irenaeus the central theological problem. He was concerned rather to explicate a faith whose basic presupposition was not God's transcendence but the confession that Jesus of Nazareth is God's only Son, "our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit." The question was, How did God provide for the restoration of man to God? The answer was, By the birth and death and resurrection ofJesus Christ. Hence, the Word was the first hand of God, incomparable to any other being, spiritual and physical. There were not many Sons and Lords, but one, and He alone was the Word become flesh. But, then, why were there two hands and not one? As indicated above, the duality of the hands was to Irenaeus a confession of the Church, rooted in prophecy and the Incarnation. There was to him no Word, by the prophet or as the Son, without the Spirit, and in this he was at one with the tradition of the Church which did itself affirm that God did his mighty acts by his two hands, by the Word and by the Spirit. The Spirit was given as the Word was given, and Irenaeus followed tradition in crediting the Spirit with the realization of the work of Christ in the Church. However, Irenaeus was not called upon to follow through the logic 156</page><page sequence="4">Church, Spirit, and Hands of God of his metaphor, and he did not follow it through. In fact, with the hindsight given us after eighteen hundred years of church history, we can now see that he failed to reflect in a sufficiently rigorous way on the full implication of his metaphor. For it is by no means immediately clear as to why the one hand of an agent should be said to fulfill the work of the other. A man does not use one hand to bring to a head the work of the other. The traditional notion that the Spirit carries through the work of God in Christ-" by the Father in the Son through the Spirit" -has repeatedly been said to be a doctrine common to the Eastern and Western churches. Yet it is not wholly congruous with Irenaeus's metaphor. The two hands of a man may cooperate in doing a certain work, and he would be greatly handicapped by the loss of either, for he needs them both. But we do not normally think of the work done by one hand as fulfilled by the work done by the other: instead, we simply think of both together as performing certain operations. Yet, though Irenaeus's metaphor may be somewhat clumsy, it can be a wonderfully suggestive aid to reflection, and we hope to indicate here the kind of light it can shed on certain aspects of the Christian faith. I Let us begin with the traditional confession of the Church, be it Cath- olic or Protestant, Eastern or Western, that Jesus Christ is the right hand of God, the Creator and Reconciler. What is immediately given for Christian faith is Jesus Christ as the Word and first Hand of God, who was a human being "crucified under Pontius Pilate." It is unnec- essary at this point to go into "the christological paradox." For the present it is enough to point out that the humanity of the first Hand of God is firmly insisted upon by the Christian testimony, which says that Jesus Christ was Jesus of Nazareth. Now it might be expected that, since the first Hand is a person, readily identified as Jesus of Nazareth, the second hand would also be a person. But the ancient Church did not encounter any difficulty here, for the Spirit was thought of as a personal being who is the Agent of the Christian life, especially of sanctification. The Spirit as distinct from the Father and the Son was acknowledged by the Church, and his work was described in great detail. But the phrase "the Holy Spirit" had no such historical referent as did the phrase "the Word of God" or "the Son of God." There was nobody corresponding to Jesus who could be pointed to as the second Hand of God. Hence, theologians '57</page><page sequence="5">The Journal of Religion spoke of the Spirit as the wisdom, or the power, or the love of God, and were unable to speak of the second Hand as they did of the first, as personal and identifiable as such. In fact, they could not and did not employ the metaphor of the two hands in systematic reflection, and thus they tended to search for other metaphors. The Church never had any problem in identifying the first Hand of God, because it was a basic article of faith that the Word became flesh and "dwelt among us," full of grace and truth. The Word had become incarnate, or, as we would say, had become a man who was known by name and had done the things recorded of him in the Scriptures. Had the Word not become a man, there would have been no need to distin- guish between God and his Word, between God and the Son; nor would any of the great christological controversies or theories of the Atonement have arisen. And Irenaeus would not have spoken of the Word as the first Hand of God. The first Hand of God is not his discarnate Word, but the Word who became flesh. But the Spirit remains without any historical or empirical referent. Nobody is the Spirit, in the sense that Jesus of Nazareth is the Word. We are able to speak at length about the work of the Spirit, saying He or It illumines, guides, or sanctifies the church or the people, or that He or It makes for the efficacy of the means of Grace; but we are not able to speak of his or its Person (!), except by identifying him or it with God and Christ, or with some characteristic or attribute of either or both. We cannot agree as to Who or What is being referred to when we speak of the Spirit. The Spirit is nobody other than God and Christ, because, unlike the Word, He or It did not become flesh. The Spirit has one nature, the divine, and is thus unlike the incarnate Son, who has two natures, the divine and the human. In this aspect, there is no problem of His or Its Person. There have been no sustained controversies as to His Person, and no heresies to sharpen the mind of the Church with regard to the doctrine of the Person of the Spirit. In short, the incarnation of the Word is at the service of the rich Christo- logies of the church. The Spirit, without body, parts, or passions, said to be a dove, or wind, or fire, and so forth, has produced Pneumatologies which have been as poorly developed as they have been without appeal for logical reflection. If without the incarnation of the Word there would have been no Christology, or concern with the Person as well as the Work of Christ, without the incarnation of the Spirit there can be no Pneumatology in line with the metaphor of the two hands. It is true that the word 158</page><page sequence="6">Church, Spirit, and Hands of God "incarnation" is traditionally used in Christology, and we must find another word for use in the doctrine of the Spirit. However, "the two hands" requires that one become critical of docetist and monophysite heresies which have been common with regard to the Spirit. If the first Hand became flesh and was one Person with two natures, we should ask if it be logical to think of the second Hand as having remained Spirit, with only one nature or perhaps no nature at all. Granting that our language about both the second and the third Persons of the Godhead contains much that is metaphorical, it is to be wondered if it is right to use one set of metaphors for one and another for the other: "Son of God" being prominent in speech about one, and Breath or Presence in the other. In God's use of his second Hand there must logically be something analogous to his use of his first Hand. There must in a sense be an incarnation of the Spirit as there was of the Word: otherwise, Irenaeus's notion of the two hands loses any real cogency. Surely it is odd to speak of the one Hand of God as " He " and of the other as "It;" or of the one Hand as a Person, and of the other as a Thing. What the one hand is, the other, it would seem, must also be. Trinitarian thinking appears to require as much. In whatever sense the first Hand is a Person, in the same sense the second Hand must also be personal. If we are constrained to speak of the Word as one Person with two natures, so must we also be constrained to speak in a similar way of the Spirit. But two natures in the one case presuppose the incarnation, and, if the second Hand has two natures, He also must be incarnate. We are not, however, playing a logical game with the metaphor of the two hands. And at this point it may be important to raise the question as to what God does with his two hands. For the present, let us assume with the Church that we know what God did with his first Hand, that he "was in Christ reconciling the world to himself" (2 Cor. 5:I9). But is not this what he also does by way of the second Hand as well ? Surely God may be said always to have done his reconciling work through men, through his servants the prophets, and many more through the ages. Jesus Christ was a man, and in him most especially was God reconciling man to himself. The first Hand of God was a man and the work of his Hand was reconciliation. "God also is wise." When He set himself to turn his people to him, He did it through his servants, human beings, because reconciliation is a human act and is done by men among men. This is not the place to go into the process of recon- ciliation. It is enough to be reminded that, as enmity is a human way of being and acting, so is reconciliation. Jesus Christ the Reconciler I59</page><page sequence="7">The Journal of Religion was a human being, and had He not been a human being, He would not have been a reconciler. The reconciler must hear the word of his fellowmen; he must be capable of taking another man's place; he must be willing to suffer another's hostility; he must be faithful and act in faith. But such things are done by rational beings, that is by fellowmen. Therefore the first Hand of God was a man. If the word of God is reconciliation, and if all that He has done with man, from the time of Adam unto the present, is for reconciliation and "peace," how can the second Hand of God be other than a human agency? If the Word is none other than the word of reconciliation, the Spirit can be none other than the spirit of reconciliation. If the Word was Jesus Christ, then the Spirit must be somebody else, some other man, any other man whom God makes an agent of reconciliation, or his second Hand. But this other man is a member of the community, a transacting people, a historical and empirical reality, formed by reconciliation among men and itself the context of their reconciling activity. This people, severally and in their unity, is the Church, and the Church is the second Hand of God as Christ is the first. The Spirit is to the Church as the Word is to Jesus. At this point we may take it as certain that Christ is He who reconciles his people with God. The question is whether there is need for another reconciler. We again ask, Why two hands? But in a way this is not a "realistic" question. The advent of Jesus Christ was followed, as a matter of history, by the coming of the Church or a community of people who confessed that Jesus is Lord and Reconciler. The Church of Jews and Gentiles came into being, and has been upon earth ever since the Ascension. But this Church was constituted as a transacting people, and their transactions were by and in and for reconciliation. A people being reconciled with God with the first Hand were being reconciled one with another, thus acting as reconcilers, that is, the second Hand of God. It would be a failure of intelligence not to recog- nize that there is no reconciliation with God by the agency of Christ without reconciliation by the agency of the people of God as they are reconciled among themselves. The agency of Christ is one thing, and the agency of the people is another. People are agents, and this agency is a means of reconciliation with that of Christ, so that God has two hands and not one. Jesus Christ was the agent of reconciliation acting as a responsible human being: so also his people are agents of the same reconciliation acting as "moral agents." In this respect, Jesus is not they, or they Jesus, and both He and they are Hands of God, the two i60</page><page sequence="8">Church, Spirit, and Hands of God Hands of God. If it is true that Jesus Christ alone is Savior, it is also true that there is no salvation without the Church. My fellowman is not my savior, since Christ is Savior alone. On the other hand, I am not saved without the service of my fellowman. If I reject service of my neighbor, I have neither Christ nor God. Once we acknowledge that the work which God does among us is reconciliation, there is no escaping the metaphor of the two hands, and more hands are excluded because there is Christ and there are his people, and no more. The metaphor of the two hands thus functions as an invitation to Christians to turn to their neighbors as agents of their reconciliation with God and their fellowmen. In a sense, our basic criticism of the traditional doctrines of the Spirit is that they have obscured the mutual dependence of believers in their reconciliation with God and their life in toto as Christ's people. The confession that the Spirit is Lord and giver of life, or that He or It is God immanent, or that He or It unites us with God, in itself says nothing about fellowmen as agents of recon- ciliation. In fact, the doctrine of the Spirit, since Augustine, has been used as a weapon against Pelagianism and Arminianism, and has thus had the effect of denying any human agency in salvation. The practical outcome of such a use of the doctrine of the Spirit has been that Chris- tians, in spite of the realities of the case, have rejected the service of their fellowmen as peacemakers and their own responsibility as recon- cilers. Given the traditional and deep-seated notion that Jesus Christ alone is Savior, the posture of Christians toward their fellows has been one of independence and indifference in the prime matter of their peace with God and within themselves. They have expected little from and offered little to their neighbors by way of help and encourage- ment, thus impoverishing their own lives and those of others as well. But the metaphor of the two hands warns against this failure, for it invites the Christian man to turn to his neighbor with a hope grounded in an economy of salvation that accords a very high role to the fellowman. There is nothing audacious or new in the suggestion that Christ and his people belong together, or that the saving work of Christ is done in a community of believers. It is only the place of the Spirit in God's economy that has become a logical problem. Resistance to the metaphor of the two hands is theologically due to the notion that, since Christ unites his people to God and to one another, there is no need for any other agency of reconciliation. Why, it is asked, should it not be enough to speak of Christ and the Church ? Why is it necessary to speak of the Spirit and the Church ? I6I</page><page sequence="9">The Journal of Religion In trying to answer such questions, we need to be guided by what the doctrine of the Incarnation itself implies. Why is it that Christ is said by the Church to be the incarnate Word ? The reason is that, when we speak of Christ, we speak also of God. Reconciliation is the work of God by the agency of a man. In reflecting upon this faith and mystery, the Church found it least misleading to speak of the Word which became flesh in a man who was crucified, dead, and buried. And the true logic of its testimony about the Spirit is not much different. For the second Hand of God refers not only to God himself but also to something human-namely, the Church or the community of believers. The reason for distinguishing between the Spirit and the church is, mutatis mutandis, the same as the reason for distinguishing between the Word and Jesus. The Spirit refers us to God and the Church, as the Word refers us to God and Jesus. As there is a logical need for speaking of the Son of God, there is a logical need for speaking of the Spirit of God. It is not enough to say Jesus is Savior, unless one believes that Jesus is in a sense the Son of God; so it is not enough to say that salvation is in the Church, unless one believes that the Church is in a sense the Spirit of God, or the place of the Spirit's working. Since all is from God, the first Hand is the incarnate Son of God, just as the second Hand of God is the "incarnate" Spirit of God. As the notion of the Son is necessary in Christology, the notion of the Spirit is necessary in Ecclesi- ology; and for the same reason, namely, that God saves his people by the agency of the fellowman. II Now we must turn to a problem which requires a fresh treatment, namely, the doctrine of "the Person of the Spirit." The notion that the Spirit is a creature, like one of the angels, is, of course, no longer feasible, for it is manifestly absurd to think of the Sanctifier, any more than the Reconciler, as a part of the world or as a kind of created being. But the "personality" of the Spirit has often been very elaborately discussed. Modern orthodox theologians (Pietist and Scholastic, Angli- can and Methodist, Presbyterian and Baptist) have insisted, on the authority of Scripture and on the basis of experience, that the Spirit is a Person, a self-conscious being, with a mind and will of his own, able to convert sinners, to sanctify and direct, to help and enable, to act indeed as the agent of salvation. Thus the third hypostasis or persona of Nicene theology has become a veritable "personality"-one, to be sure, 162</page><page sequence="10">Church, Spirit, and Hands of God without a body but one fully endowed with the attributes of omni- science, omnipresence, omnipotence, infinity, eternity, and unchange- ableness. Yet a Person who has the psyche of a human being but who has none of the limitations of a man is something of a "mystery," and his existence may be affirmed by authority but not by reason- which is why Pneumatology has so largely been an affair of scriptural citation. The trouble with biblicist fundamentalism in this respect, however, is that it presents an account of the Spirit as lacking any real incarnation. But it is precisely this dimension of things which is restored by the metaphor of the two hands. For it reminds us that the radical humanity attributed to the one hand must be attributed to the other as well. Just as there can be no doctrine of the incarnate Word apart from the ques- tion of "the two natures," so too there can be no doctrine of the incar- nate Spirit apart from a similiar question. Given the metaphor of the two hands, there must be an X who is the Spirit humanate as Jesus is the Word humanate. One should speak of the Person of X, the Spirit humanate, as one speaks of Jesus Christ, the Word humanate. But considering that the Word and the Spirit humanate are engaged in reconciliation, and reconciliation is by human agency, X as well as Jesus must be human, and X must be the Church, for it is the commun- ity of believers which is the second Hand of God. Thus we have to do not with the Person of the Spirit but with the Person of the Church, the Spirit humanate, as we have to do not with the Person of the Word but with the Person of Christ, the Word humanate. It is as the Church that the Spirit is a Person, for it is fellowmen who are re- conciling agents. It is the Church that is the Spirit humanate; the Church is God-man; the Church is one Person, a "hypostatic union" of divine and human natures; the Church is the second Agent of reconciliation. The distinction between Jesus and his people is immovable, and so is the distinction between his Person and their Person or Persons. Hence a distinction must be made between "humanation" as used for the Word and for the Spirit. But in both cases we have to do with human- ation, because Jesus and his people alike are agents of reconciliation. If anyone, in the interests of safeguarding the grand distinction between the Savior and the sinners, finds it convenient to use one term for the humanation of the Word and another for the humanation of the Spirit, provided he does not revert to the perennially misleading language of "incarnation" and "indwelling," we may not object. But since there is 163</page><page sequence="11">The Journal of Religion no way of distinguishing these two as physical processes, and since in both cases we have to do with human agency, we find it necessary to speak of humanation in both instances. The distinction between the two humanations must be firmly rooted in the agencies of Christ and the Church as reconciling Persons. Christ is a human being and we are human beings. He is soul-with-body, we are soul-with-body. He was tempted, we are tempted. He reconciles, we reconcile. But He is the Prince of Life, who willed as God willed, who reconciled sinners with God and, in reconciling, made them reconcilers. We know him as one of us, as our Fellowman. We know ourselves as those who resist the Word and the Spirit of God, but we know him as the Giver of both the Word and the Spirit. It appears fitting that we should say that He is the Word made flesh and that the Spirit is His Spirit. But it does not appear fitting that we should say the same of ourselves, because we turn away from both the Word and the Spirit of God. Therefore, when we say that we are the Spirit humanate, it is as though we were engaged in presumption and were grossly in error. We say the Church is the Spirit humanate because we are called to be reconcilers, especially because we may hope for our neighbor's service of reconcil- iation; but we properly balk at saying we are the Spirit, because we resist God and our neighbor. It is for this reason that Christ is said to be the Word incarnate, whereas the Spirit is said to dwell within us. Even though we may say that there was a tension between the Word of God and Jesus, as apparent from his temptation, we confess that this was a sign of his humanity and not of his sin. But we know that we resist the Spirit in our unfaithfulness, and that in this respect the Spirit works in us and in judgment of us. We are not in this respect the Spirit humanate but "flesh" in strife with the Spirit. And thus many may feel it to be very nearly blasphemous to speak of the Spirit humanate as we speak of the Word incarnate. Yet, however much we may shrink from identifying the Spirit with the Church, God Himself, in the pattern of Christian faith, does not refuse to employ human agency in his reconciling work. And, in this as in all else, He is wise, for it takes human beings to make "human life human," even though these human beings are themselves deeply flawed. The fact is that reconciliation is the work of the Church, even as it is the work of Jesus Christ. To say that it is not the work of the Church because the Church itself needs to be reconciled with God, is to contradict the wisdom of God, to misunderstand the nature and mission of the Church, and to obscure the economy of reconciliation. I64</page><page sequence="12">Church, Spirit, and Hands of God It is to misconceive God and his way, by failing to reflect sufficiently on his two hands. The God of the Church is a God who called a Man to be the Recon- ciler and the people of that Man to be his reconcilers, even while these people are the objects of reconciliation. He is the God who has called sinners to be his servants, as He has called a Man to be his Mediator. And the notion that He deals only with "good" men is in accord neither with the doctrine of the Word nor with the doctrine of the Spirit. Indeed, from the perspective of the Christian faith, one of the great mysteries of life resides in the use God makes of sinners as peacemakers. These sinners are human agents and act as such. They do the work of reconciliation in their transactions one with another, not as though they are sufficient for the work they do, but as hands of God. God does all by his Spirit, who is to be distinguished from the Word, and they do all as transacting fellowmen. This is what we wish to signify by saying that the Church is the Spirit humanate. As in the Work of Christ God acts as God and Man as a fellowman, Christ not being therefore divided, so in the work of the Church, God acts as God and men as fellowmen, the Church therefore not being divided. And it is in this way that the Church of those who live in the hope of holiness is the Holy Spirit of God humanate. 165</page></plain_text>
