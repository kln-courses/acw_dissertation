<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SYSTEM OF ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY IN GENERAL MAX HORTEN Translated from the German by V. June Hager It is an almost impossible task to outline the common pattern of philosophy in a cultural sphere, just as it is to specifically determine movements, periods, and strata. For we all too easily mistake a particu larity for a general trait, or judge contents by their distinctive form. More over, systems exist only in individual given figurations. The "universal" is a careful abstraction from these, which, if correctly deduced, grasps the deeper essence, but is prone to a certain fanciful vision. A finely differen tiated, deeply penetrating abstraction from Near Eastern world-visions ? one which reflects the true essence ? is especially difficult to achieve. First, the Oriental world of ideas is a new frontier for us, and second, the intellectual forms are often so widely divergent, that what is "common" is meaningless, and our only alternative is to list side by side the typical formation groups as such (mysticism, philosophy, etc). Pertinent defini tion of universal thought constellations is one of the most delicate tasks of research in intellectual history. In the Islamic Orient this will not be feasible in the near future. What follows here is therefore only a provisional attempt, to be supplemented by any new discovery from other untapped sources. What is most important for an understanding of the culture, that is, of the inner life of the Oriental, is cognizance of the ideas, spiritual attitudes, and forms of spiritual experience common to all strata of the population. These latent principles define and destine the relationship of society and the individual to life and the world. The Oriental disposes his individual life according to the idea that he is part of a great whole. He views his existence as a fragment of the universe and constantly relates it to cosmic powers (God, angels, stars, spirits). In this sense his thought is completely steeped in philosophy. For this reason philo sophy makes its appearance in all fields and at all levels. That the pic torial arts take their inspiration from philosophy has always been self</page><page sequence="2">2 MAX HORTEN evident in art history, and this fact can be easily observed in Islamic art. Literature also is suffused by spiritual awareness and emotion, precipitating the appearance of philosophical ideas of all types. Science and ethics also seek ties with universal concepts, which intermingle and guide social, individual, and political life. Thus, since all life is characterized by the most universal orientations, knowledge of these will be our most important access to the Orient. Penetration of a foreign intellectual culture is especially facilitated by absorption in the basic ideas underlying the world-images of that culture. These can be discovered by posing the questions: What does the world signify for Muslim thinkers? What goal do they see in metaphysical scho larly observation of the world? Understanding the world according to a uniform and pivotal concept was an undertaking which especially fas cinated philosophers and speculative mystics (pantheism). Theologians and scientists are also under the spell of philosophical concepts, although they perceive these rather as isolated problems to be solved. The cohesion of the whole does not impress itself so distinctly on their awareness; for theologians are primarily concerned with the defense of Qur'?nic dogma, and scientists are primarily intent on analyzing the experience of immediate problems. The homogeneous construction of the entire universe, that is the actual philosophical problem, perhaps seemed to them unsolvable and retreated far into the background. Thus there are essential and basic differences in subjective attitudes. According to these different attitudes and theresulting goals, we can ask the further question: in the actual individual systems of philosophy, what is the fundamental concept and how is it pursued? I. The Theoretical Picture of the World 1. God It is at first surprising to find proofs of God constantly attemp ted in the Qur'?n (and we are primarily concerned with this source in our study of what is "common" to all strata in Islam). In general God's exis tence is self-evident for the Oriental and for all the southern peoples who live in more intimate contact with and experience a deeper awe of nature. For these reasons we do not expect proofs of God from the Oriental. We are tempted to consider those we find only pretexts, not stemming from any doubt, but only contributing to a more vivid representation of the God-concept.</page><page sequence="3">ISLAMIG PHILOSOPHY 3 Yet the urgency with which these proofs of God are pressed causes us to take a closer look. The Oriental with his acute and active intelli gence is also concerned with the mystery of God, but this concern (espe cially in the Qur'?nic cultural milieu) expresses itself in forms different from those we employ. The question of God is not absolute, but only relative; the goal is not the indisputable proof of God's existence, but rather the proof of his superiority to the world of spirits. There must be a convic tion that God is supreme2 and that He directs all spirits and lower world forces. Thus Allah is the supreme and only God. These proofs are accomplished by means of simple rhetorical re ferences to the greatness and wondrousness of the cosmic system with its various parts. Thus (and this is very important for our consideration) is prepared the ground upon which a more advanced civilization would be able to construct philosophical and theological proofs. Man shall contemplate the vaulting and harmonic movement of the heavenly spheres, the placement of the stars in the skies, the towering mountains and spreading plains. Man should admire the way in which God brings forth the seed from the open earth, waters the land, produces olive-tree, palm, verdant groves, grapes, grain, fruit, and fodder for man and beast. Who darkens the planets at night and illuminates them again each morning? God's grace sends winds and rains to give life to dried-up fields and pastures. In wondrous manner He creates man from a drop of semen and a clot of blood. He destroys the recalcitrant peoples and graciously protects the pious, etc. From these observations are evolved the concepts concerning the nature and attributes of God, which have always inspired later specula tion with their symbolic wealth and rhetorical - graphic power of con viction. God is Lord of the world (rabb), Ruler, Creator. The "Light verse", is striking and extremely relevant for philosophy: "God is the light of the heavens and the earth" (Qur'?n 24,35). With this a Qur'?nic illustration of manifestation doctrines is provided. God's attributes become evident in these Qur'?nic proofs. He possesses unity (directed against the Christian trinity, Persian dualism, and polytheism), omnipotence, power of creation, power to maintain and direct the world, but most of all ? compassion. He loves men who do His will, although He harshly punishes those who rebel. He it is who hears, sees, speaks, knows all, wills. He is eternal in the sense of being with</page><page sequence="4">4 MAX HORTEN out beginning (azal) and without end (abad), the Living. These images are poetically recapitulated in the ninety-nine "beautiful names of Allah". And thus God's activities are also conceived. God creates and maintains the existence of the world and subordinates the entire world order to His plans. These plans embrace as their core the life of man, and since the Islamic concept of God is eminently moral, God rules man according to the principle of Justice. Good is rewarded; evil is punished. If evil men seem to prosper, then God is remunerating their good works, so that they will experience the full impact of their punishment in the world to come. There is an astonishing refinement in the perception of the great problem of predestination and freedom. God brings about all events in the world, even human activity. Yet at the same time man is free and master of his acts. The ambivalence of these views is acutely experienced, and texts professing both convictions appear side by side. The conscious ness of freedom is so intense and so obvious in everyday life, that the Arab, a man of free nature, will not be dissuaded from this awareness by any theory. The solution is an appeal to God's infinite wisdom and to the concept of divine guidance of the world. According to His omniscient world-plan God also willed man's responsibility. Here theologians found a very fertile ground, already prepared, for further speculation. God receives the "submission" (isi?m) of men; He approves good works and condemns those that are evil, thereby meting out reward and punishment for the world to come. To ascertain the position of philosophers in Oriental civilization it is important to know how the common mass of Believers in Islam con ceived God; for from this we can establish to what a great extent the con cepts of the intellectual classes were innovations, and what risks these classes ran when exposed to the fanaticized masses. It is well-known that the early orthodoxy (fiashw?ya) and the "rever end fathers" (al-salaf al-s?lib) of Islam conceived God in anthro pomorphic terms; they imagined him as a venerable old man sitting on His throne. It is also easy to prove that these images continued to hold sway late into the advanced Abbasid civilization, even among authorita tive theologians. Ibn Huzayma (b. 923), one of the most celebrated law teachers of his day, explained:3 whoever does not acknowledge - or per haps even denies - that Allah sits on His throne above the heavens and is</page><page sequence="5">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 5 spatially separated from His creatures, should be summoned as an apostate to recant. If he refuses he should be decapitated and his corpse thrown on a dung heap, so he may no longer dishonour the people of the qibla. A fanatic4, DhahabI, told of Bust! (b. 965): "He possessed great knowledge but little religion. When he came to us he denied the spatial boundaries of the Godhead. So we drove him away". He was banished from Sijistan. The anthropomorphic images of the Qur'?n were to be taken literally. Whosoever advocated an intellectual interpretation of the Godhead thereby endangered his life. In Hamad?n above the portal of the mosque were inscribed the six verses of the Qur'?n in which All?h's reclining upon His throne was described. This was undoubtedly intended as a protest against the more educated and intellectual groups. In every age these pre-scientific ideas hold sway among the un educated masses; and it is clear that these masses directly stimulated, or at least provided the main support for the often harsh persecution of more liberally - leaning intellectuals. The most important determination about the Godhead, without which no understanding of the total system of Islamic revealed religion is possible, is that of God's "concealment". This element has been very much neglected, since it does not stand out in the dogmatic formulations. However, it is the base underlying all these dogmas. Only occasionally do we find a conscious definition of this; then it appears distinctly and monu mentally. The cosmos is an indirect expression of God's "concealment". For screens separate God from the lower world, - "veils of light", light oceans ; these are numbered according to the seven - motif: 70,700 to 70,000. Thus God's aloofness from the world is immeasurably great, and God is "inaccessible" to men i.e. "concealed". Beneath the light-oceans, the seven planetary tiers, the so-called "seven heavens", further isolate God from men. The sublunary world is reached only after all these. In the mystifying "Light-verse" of the Qur'?n (24,35) which has not yet been fully appreciated and utilized in the elucidation of Islamic God-concepts, All?h is simply called the Light of the World, with no diffe rentiation being made between material and spiritual light. This is ex</page><page sequence="6">6 MAX HORTEN tremely significant, and very characteristic of Oriental thought. "Allah is the light of the heavens and of the earth". The unique and identical light of heaven and earth, however, is the undefined brightness which suffuses the "world". Sun and stars cannot be thus described. A vague light permeates the "world" and the blue heavens, and this does not seem to issue from any determinable source. It is "lightness' or "daylight". The primitively reasoning man seeks a source for this light; per ceiving that sunlight comes from the sun's body, he reasons that the universal "brightness" must also have a source, which must be hidden in the depths of the blue sky. That is why we find in the Light-verse: "Allah, the Light, is as a lamp placed in a niche; and this lamp is enclosed in a glass globe, which shines like a sparkling star". The light-source itself cannot be seen, although it causes the globe to glitter and illuminates the niche. Only this reflected brightness is experienced by man. Allah is concealed from men first by the seven planetary heavens, i.e. the niche, then by screens and light - oceans, i.e. the glass globe. When he shines, i.e. when the blue heavens are bright, it is due to the Light of Allah which, beyond and behind, irradiates everything. It is the light of God which makes the blue sky so wonderfull radiant! The Light-verse is to be taken,first of all, then in literal sense. The primary experience of primitive man was not the sun or the moon, as had been incorrectly deduced from ancient religions, but rather the blue sky. It was the sky above which made the deepest impression on primitive man. He sought for this a primary source, a "cause", which he imagined within the blue depths. This source however was not visible, did not appear as a tangible and concrete body; it was "hidden". God also is "hidden" and must therefore send forth His Prophets, messengers, and revelations in order to make Himself known to men. Each religion of revelation necessarily has the doctrine of God's "concealment" as its underlying idea; for if God could be directly ex perienced by men, no revelation would be necessary. Thus we can understand the famous saying of the Prophet: Allah says: "I was a hidden treasure, and desired to be known; for this reason I created the world." The treasure is "hidden" in the depths of the blue sky. The myth of the blue heavens is the origin of these beliefs. When Muham mad ascended to heaven, he first penetrated the planetary heavens, then the light-oceans (the regions above the tropic), then he reached the lotus</page><page sequence="7">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY ? tree (North Pole) and finally beyond this he found Allah, in the infinite depths behind the blue sky.5 2. The World ? System Reality separates into two major spheres: the here-and-now and the world-to-come; the world of sense perception which surrounds us, and the supernal world of the divinity and the stars, remote in the higher regions. In Islam the physical nature of this world-to-come is not as starkly emphasized as it was in the ancient Orient, and the gardens of para dise (located supposedly among the heavenly spheres) are brought into sharp relief only in the folk-religion. On the other hand, the spiritually moral nature of this world is firmly underlined. Here we can again iden tify the process by which older cultures are preserved longest in the lower strata, while the educated in their strivings for advancement already reveal the signs of the future. Islamic mysticism more intensely accentuates this tendency, in that it completely rejects any physical afterlife; and this rejection is accompanied by a consciousness of superiority (vis-a-vis theologians and the uneducated masses) and by a certainty in having realized the deeper (??fm-inner), true meaning of Islam. So the developing trend is towards spiritualization and moral emphasis. In liberal circles Parsi doctrines were maintained: the world sepa rates into the spheres of Good and Evil which never overlap. For Good cannot encroach on the domain of Evil, nor Evil on the domain of Good. This irrevocable segregation of opposites is especially evident in the divine activity which suffuses the world. This extends to the sphere of Evil ? without encompassing it; that is the boundary. The divine efficacy is inhibited by the boundaries of evil as if it confronts an impregnable wall. "God can only bring about Good". Man is often conceived as a neutral element caught between these two worlds, and he can opt for one or the other; thus he is free, independent of any interior or exterior determination. The extreme dualist interpretation is seldom advocated. That would be that there are no neutral elements. Men are necessarily and by nature either of the good who cannot ever become evil-or of the evil who cannot ever become good. The good man, like God, can only do good. "God is obliged to produce what is good-eyen what is best". It is obvious that the orthodox circles rejected this Parsism. According to them God can also produce evil?as part of his omniscient plan ; the domains of Good and Evil are only relatively limited.6</page><page sequence="8">8 MAX HORTEN The Islamic world-system knows neither cosmology nor cosmogony in the old sense. The Babylonians imagined the world as coming into being with all its gods, then developing throughout the aeons from the fountainhead of wisdom and light, which supposedly contains in it all perfection; for "wisdom" signified the supreme ideal to which the entire universe in its evolution strives to return. Islam, however, conceives the world as having been created by God in one single act. Here there is no aeon long evolution from Ultimate Being. On the other hand, Islam fosters, from a tradition of the ancient Orient, the doctrine of world-evolution and world-cycles, proceeding according to God's eternal plan. The spiritua lization of form thereby is greater in Islam, although this cannot be said of the basic doctrine. Islam dispenses with a cosmological framework which would even embrace the gods and stresses, to a greater extent than had ancient Oriental wisdom, the uninhibited all - creation - directing power of God. The Oriental outlook strikes us as rather more "Greek" (because of its cultural subtlety and the possibilities of plastic elaboration) than the concept of divine and absolute will and power in Islam. Islam envisages a greater superiority bf God vis-a-vis the world. "God is bound by neither duty nor law." In the universe we must observe and distinguish between a material ? mechanical system and an abundance of spiritual beings, which operate within and animate this system. The material world structure may be described thus; 1. Throne of God ('ar?) 2. Footstool (kursl) 3. The Pen of Fate (qalam) and Tablet of Destiny ("the well-pre served tablet") 4. The spheres : a) sphere of the environment b) the sphere of the fixed stars c) the seven planetary spheres d) the spheres of the elements (fire, air, water, earth) 5. The spirit world which controls part of the sublunary and lower worlds 6. The underworld, darkness, evil forces The "upper" world (Hlliy?n) is to be sought with the heavenly ka'ba, The "well - built house," in the world of the spheres.</page><page sequence="9">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 9 This entire structure is activated and animated by spiritual beings. God is envisaged as sitting upon His throne, His feet upon a stool. An old cosmic myth is the foundation for this image. However, in the Qur'?n this myth is elaborated; for God cannot sit aloof upon His throne, placidly observing the world-tumult below, and still immediately effect every cosmic process. The contradictions between God's immanent and God's mediat ing activity have not been resolved in Islam. They result from strata of idea-evolution, simultaneously present; the older stratum is the anthro pomophic, fanciful - graphic; the upper, more recent stratum represents God as an immanent force active in the universe. The trinity-concepts are contained in the triad: Allah - Logos - Spirit, although, because of a strong monotheistic tendency, inherited from Judaism, these could never fully develop. The Logos (amr) is the Word and Command of God, a divine effluence, which ascends and des cends between the spheres. The spirit (r?h) emerges from the Logos and produces in each indivi dual human being illumination, strength, and holiness. A third divine hypostasis is the sah?na. This is God's nearness personified and His protective power, which inspires the despairing Believer with new courage (in Hebrew - schechina). Innumerable angels are distributed into graded levels and ascend and descend the ladder of the spheres, distrtibuting God's messages and commands.7 The spirits can (as can the devils) rise to the lunar sphere, and so control the sublunary world and even parts of the underworld. Some of these are harmless beings, not hostile to men, and many of them have accepted Islam. The spirits inspire the soothsayers and poets (sh?'ir-hc who knows), and that is why they can predict the future and harness natural forces (i.e. the magic influences of abusive poems). For this reason Murjtammad always emphasizes that he is no "poet", that is - he has not received his teaching from the spirits. And there are certainly angels But these are all subordinate to Allah8 and must not be considered Allah's children.This istheProphet's unique concern. Spirits are worshipped as idols; they hide within these to lead the foolish polytheists astray. The devils, culminating in Satan (ibl?s?diabolos), are the per sonifications of evil. They control the realm of darkness (they are the</page><page sequence="10">10 MAX HORTEN mythical apperception of this (probably from a prehistoric myth about daybreak), and seek to win over men and draw them down into their kingdom. Through insinuations they attempt to alienate men from God and to gain "their portion in the actions of God's servants". This struggle between light and darkness, between the God of light and the lords of darkness, between spirits of light and spirits of darkness, is continually raging, and helpless man stands between the two hostile armies as the prize to be conquered. Islam is to be understood against this backdrop. Islam wishes to fortify man for the Good so that he may not succumb to the devil's temptations and find himself dragged into the abyss. II. Practical Ethical Thought 1. The Moral Precepts The universal ethical foundations of Islam are just as important as - perhaps even more important than - the universal world-view. These ethical foundations provide the frame of mind and spiritual direction in Islam, and are at the same time the soil from which the world-philoso phies have grown and the manifestation of their inner strivings.9 Earlier it was thought that a study of the Qur'?nic texts would make these fields accessible. The Qur'?n, however, is a testimony of the Prophet's own religious experience and perhaps that of his immediate environment. Around 700 early Islam was involved in an extremely crucial process of development, as it confronted Hellenistic culture and entered the Hellenistic - Christian sphere of influence. This era contributed to the material content of the Qur'?n a spirit which was to be the determining factor for later periods. The era certified its religious and moral experience in the form of Prophetic sayings, and thus acquired for its doctrines and thought forms an authority equal to that of the "Holy Book", the Qur'?n. Each succeeding period had to hold to this early frame of reference, in order to construct upon it the edifice of its own religious outlook. So the material texts of the Qur'?n cannot, by themselves, illuminate us about the essence of Islam in later centuries, although the inspiration for the later doctrines may well, in part, be discovered there. Only the spirit with which Islam invested the Qur'?n can enlighten us, and this we find in the traditions, i.e. the sayings attributed to the Prophet in the period around 700-800.</page><page sequence="11">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 11 Orthodox mysticism recognized the significance of these "words of the Prophet" and through them expressed its moral conviction, render ing this the decisive symbol for the essence of Islam, the basis of most other developments. For orthodox mysticism accomplished for the Islamic consciousness a synthesis between extremes of right and left, establishing itself as-the "middle way". The primary and universal elements are to be sought in Islamic mysticism. So both the Qur'?n and the tradition should be studied and morally evaluated. The moral precepts of Islam are to be understood against the cos mological background. Human life is the prize in the great contest bet ween light and darkness. Man is snatched here and there by hostile powers and must see that he decides in favor of light, i.e. God. And God indicates the way for him (tartqa in monastic life, SharVa, in laws and cult rules). The moral commandments are to be found in the Qur'?n. These provide the Qur'?nic foundation for the moral development, yet are to be supplemented by Prophetic tradition. 1. Do not set up any other God beside the one God All?h; if you do you will be left disgraced and helpless. 2. The Lord has decided that you shall serve Him alone. 3. Be good (ifis?n) to parents, whether one or both may reach old age in your house. Do not say "Fie" to them or any other angry words but speak to them with respect and honor; with a loving and compassionate attitude lower to them the wing of humility and pray: "My Lord! be merciful to them, as they have raised me from childhood." 4. And give to relatives, beggars, and travellers that which is their due. Do not be wasteful or extravagant (prohibition of luxury), for the squanderers are brothers of the devils, and Satan shows no gratitude towards his Lord. But if you must disappoint these unfortunates while you are seeking mer cy from your Lord, then at least address them some gentle words. 5. Do not murder your children in fear of impoverishment; for we will provide for them as well as for you. The slaying of them is a grievous sin. 6. Avoid unchastity, for that is evil and a sinful way.</page><page sequence="12">12 MAX HORTEN 7. And slay no creature God has declared inviolable, except by right. If anyone is unjustly slain, so give power to his agent; yet this agent shall be moderate in his revenge; for he has our aid. 8. Do not wantonly approach the property of orphans until they are of age, unless it is for their own good. 9. And loyally fulfill the convenant, for concerning this you will be held accountable. 10. Give full measure when you measure, and weigh with just scale, for this is good and the best manner. 11. Do not gullibly believe what you hear if you do not have full knowledge of it, for you will be held accountable for your ears, eyes, and heart. 12. Do not strut arrogantly about the earth, for you will not part the earth nor reach up to the mountains. This is part of what your Lord has revealed to you (Muhammad) from the divine wisdom10 (Qur'?n 17, 23 ff). Ethics develops from this Qur'?nic foundation - proceeding to Prophetic tradition (utilizing the strong Christian influences) to the mystics, theologians and philosophers. Sarr?j11 accepted the basic prophetic sayings and shows thereby how his period, determinative for later times, absorbed the tradition and pereived the essence of the Islamic attitude towards life. The prototype of this civilization is thereby presented in general outlines. This is the appropriate place to cite the statement concerning faith. "The Archangel Gabriel asked the Prophet about three bases: (1) Islam (2) Faich and (3) Charity, in relation to exterior life, interior life, and the ultimate core - Ultimate Reality". The innermost essence of Islam is thus disclosed in this saying: "1) Islam - and here we mean Islamic law - is external, 2) faith is at the same time external and internal (3) charity is the ultimate core of both the external and the internal". 2. Selfless Charity According to the Words of the Prophet Charity (ifys?n) is the true essence of Islam's interior and exterior life, of "faith". Accordingly, whoever is lacking in charity (ifa?n) may well be a Muslim and a Believer from a material point of view,</page><page sequence="13">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 13 yet he lacks the "ultimate reality" of Islam and faith, the haqiqa, the actual core. Now we must ask: how is this charity to be conceived? It is the performance of Good insofar as this is to be incorporated into the pur pose and motivation of Muslim life as a whole. And the continuation of the Prophet's words quoted above enlightens us concerning this: "Ifa?n means that you must serve God in such a manner, as if you were actually seeing Him. For although in reality you do not see Him, yet He sees you". Gabriel sanctions these words and so they partake of heavenly, even divine authority. fys?n is thus not simply charity, but selfless charity, and this is, at the same time, the inner core of Islam. Whoever is deficient in ihs?n can be a lip-Muslim; he is, however, no true Muslim. And ihs?n must be guided by right intention. This occurs when "God's servant strives in theory and practice towards God's countenance". That is, he acts only for God (lill?hi) and relinquishes all selfish and worldly goals. Selfless charity for God's sake is the true essence, the "ultimate reality" of Islam. This ihs?n saying is the first link in a chain of four sayings (to be compared with the Logia) which Sarr?j characterized in the following way: "The basis of all teachings concerning our knowledge of the inner - the deeper significance of Islam - pan be found in four sayings - supported by the authority of God's Messenger: (1) That which Gabriel has spoken (2) The saying of Ibn 'Abbas: "The Prophet took me by the hand and said to me; "Oh, young man; guard God (in your heart) and God will preserve you; that is, preserve God in your soul, then He will protect you from eternal damnation". (3) The tradition of W?bisa reports as a teaching of the Prophet: "That which rankles in your breast is evil; that in which your soul rejoices is morally good." Natural religion, proclaimed with the voice of conscience, is in this manner set up as the kernel of Islam. Everything depends on conscience, attitude, personal conviction. The relation of the individual soul to God is ultimately the deciding factor. (4) This series of "sayings" ends with the tradition of Nu'm?n: "The Prophet advanced this opinion: 'What is permitted is clearly evident and what is forbidden is also clearly evident' ".</page><page sequence="14">14 MAX HORTEN Here, presented in a wondrously simple manner, we find the natural basis for all ethical and religious attitudes towards life. This is valid also for Islam, and it is even represented as the actual and true essence of the religion of the Prophet; each human creature knows instinctively what he should do and what he should not do, in order to truly relate himself to the Ground of all Being, the baq?qa. From these texts one could almost believe, although this is only vaguely intimated, that all positive religions, including Islam, are, in their rudimentary elements, only historically produced configurations of a natural religion common to all peoples - a religion of conscience and conviction. The fact that this essential characteristic of Islam has been so completely misunderstood by our diligent erudites has understandably evoked in Muslims the shrillest indignation and the deepest disdain for the biased "scholarship" of Europe. In a strikingly penetrating manner these texts, which seek to present a concept of the essence of Islam (coming from the mouth of the Prophet and from Gabriel - thus ultimately from God Himself) relegate exterior cult forms to the background. These dissolve like unsubstantial shadows, for they are not felt to be part of Islam's essential core; and although the individual Muslim cannot completely free himself from cult obligations, they are allotted a peripheral or accessory role. These are however the exterior symbols of Islam's basic outlook. All this is confirmed by yet another last Prophetic utterance: "There is no wrongdoing or enmity (dir?r) in Islam"; no one may harm his fellow creature or harbour hostility against him. And that this brotherly love is not limited to any one section of humanity, but embraces, not only Muslims, but all men, is attested to by the teachings and exhortations which demands that pity (shafaqa) must be extended to all "creatures", that is ? all men (Mi?k)-12 Once I was discussing with a Muslim: "Islam has no doctrine of brotherly love as does Christianity", I said. Whereupon I received as an answer: "Islam has ihts?n, and this is the act, the performance of bro therly love while Christian love signifies only the feeling which one man entertains for another, when he wishes him well. We Muslims therefore profess a higher moral ideal than Christianity." I was able to set my Muslim friend's mind at rest concerning Christianity, saying that Chris tianity conceives of love of one's fellow man not only as a subjective emo</page><page sequence="15">ISLAMIC PHILOOSPHY 15 tion, but also as an action. Yet this comment of an orthodox Muslim certainly shows how today's Islam perceives its morality. In the emphasis on the external act one might glimpse an activist trait of the Arabian character, easily explainable from Bedouin life. Never theless, we must stress that the exterior, taken by itself, is considered mean ingless, when it is not served by noble intention as its life - giving element. For the total action depends on tne purpose, according to a well-known Prophetic saying: "Actions have their foundation in their aims". Attitude and good will constitute what is moral. In order to assess the basic moral frame of mind out of which the Muslims understanding of the world develops, the doctrine of right intention must be kept in mind. This includes within it the idea of self lessness. The Muslim must perform good works for God's sake and in the process must not have his eye fixed on any earthly reward. The mystic goes so far as to relinquish any material reward in the afterlife and strives only for God. He denies the material afterlife. This becomes much clearer when we examine the common errors of pure intention, the aberrations which can nullify pure intention and deprive right purpose of the value of its works. These faults are: (1) selfishness, arrogance, and vanity ('ujb) 2) visual gratification (riya) 4) auditory gratification (sam'a). Any ambition, all egoism, any striving for merit other than divine - are to be excluded. God and only God is to be man's goal, and whoever aims for something else as the ultimate end of his ac tions, is guilty of "polytheism", in that he sets up, besides God, a second God. And in Islam polytheism in the most grievous sin. The extraordinary refinement and delicacy of Islamic spirituality is especially evident in the deep compassion for all human suffering, even for the suffering of the unreasoning creatures, the animals. Lack of pity in any form encounters the greatest moral indignation. And when a Muslim hears that men are dying of hunger in Europe's cities, his deep conviction of Islam's ethical superiority is encouraged and nourished. With the words: "There we find no charity" {ma t?jad rafyma hon?k) a stern judgement is passed on Europe and Christianity. For compassion (raf?ma) is the essence of God, "The All-Merciful", the Loving Provider (al-rafym?n aUrah?m), and man's moral endeavor should consist in be coming like God in all His characteristics, especially in compassion; that is, man should absorb into himself all God's "attributes" (akhl?q)</page><page sequence="16">16 MAX HORTEN through takhalluq and thus sanctify the human nature."^Whoever is compassionate resembles God; he is holy. 3. Exterior Life as Moral and Religious Unity The attitude towards marriage in Islam differs strikingly from the typical attitude in Christianity, which reflects the atmosphere of world renunciation in declining antiquity. Islam exhibits a more vigorous joy in life, although Islam also arose in the anticipations of the imminent world-end. Celibacy is frowned upon, is morally suspect, and conflicts with Prophetic tradition.^ B?b and Bah? decree marriage a duty for everyone. Mystics recommend marriage, however they recognize a celibacy as a path of world-escape and striving towards God, according to the example of Jesus, Paul and the Christian monastic orders. A tradition of the Prophet opposes this: "It is my precept that men should marry, and whosoever feels aversion for my precept does not belong to me". Then marriage would be the individual duty of each. Ahmad Rif 'at, who was influenced by monasticism, perceives marriage as a collective duty of the community.14 Among the Bektash? there existed a strong celibate - faction (tajarrud? stripping away of the worldly and material? celibacy) which was opposed by the married faction within the order. Celibacy is experienced somewhat like a trend of crypto-Christianity. "Even today the dervishes pierce their ears at the edge of B?lim's grave (the actual founder of the Bektashi order) to mark their vow of matri monial abstinence", and then insert earrings, "Since around the end of the tenth century a mutation seemed to have occurred in certain Muslim circles in the strongly disapproving attitudes towards celibacy", and this undoubtedly is related to the blossoming of mon asticism, to be traced back, consequently, to Christian or Indian influences.15 The Islamic world-doctrine can be observed in its manifestations in the total culture, thus also in politics and in the ideal according to which the government is incorporated. The authority of the government is divine in origin. It must introduce divine law into the world and smooth the path, prescribed by the Qur'an, which men must follow to reach God. Thereby the type and limitations of this power are determined : for it dare not transgress the Qur'an. Jurists must serve this authority, pass judgements as to what connotes divine law in an individual case; the execution of their verdicts is the responsibility of the Caliph. Like God, the Caliph is not held accountable to anyone. There</page><page sequence="17">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 17 fore a certain arbitrariness may characterize his actions, which according to conservative theologians, can be considered as part of the divine activity. According to Oriental mentality, a considerable degree of independence be longs to the character of a ruler in relation to his subjects (here we again note a strong voluntaristic trait). A strong government conforms to this world-doctrine, and if a democratic element occasionally surfaces, it may be explained by the democratic customs of Bedouin life. The Caliph cannot in any way be compared to the Pope; for in sunni Islam the vehicle of infallibility is the consensus of the community, that is, practically speaking, the theologians with the Shaykh al-Isl?m at the head. When these regard something as belonging to Islamic tradition, this becomes a permanent component of the faith. The Caliph is bound, just as is every Believer, by such decisions, otherwise the consequence is punishment as an apostate. The Caliph cannot himself pronounce any religious judgements, but is only the administrative organ of God's will, which proclaims itself in the Qur'?n, in Prophetic tradition, and in the consensus. In spite of these formal defences against any invasion by foreign elements, Islam has managed to assimilate innumerable foreign components in all areas of life, but especially in its world-view. In ShFa Islam the Imam is the highest religions authority, since he represents the very manifestation of God. 4. The Attitude Towards Culture in Islam This frame of reference provides the general mentality in which and from which the Oriental world-explanations were fashioned. This is a positive frame of mind which precludes any cynical outlook. The foundation of the world is absolutely good and true (God is truth? baqq) homogeneous, unique, just and moral, the origin of the harmony of beauty and wisdom which is manifested in the world. Human life is elevated to a higher order than that which is signified by the material world. Because eternal perfection is the basis of world events and human life, the attitude is solemn, exalted, reverential; here we have the experience of the sublime. The spiritual is the paramount way the real and only value. From this atmosphere a strong drive towards the spiritual and the ideal necessarily developed. Absorpotion in the study of truth and me ditation about the essences of things Qiaq?'iq) was considered the most</page><page sequence="18">18 MAX HORTEN worthy activity. The teacher was highly esteemed. Wisdom was regar ded with reverence. D?r?n? made the statement: "If I knew that in Mecca there existed a man who could communicate to me a word, even a single word, concerning the Gnosis (the deeper knowledge of God), I would travel there on foot- even if it were 1000 miles away - to receive the word from him". There was a certain immersion in deeply meaningful expressions. Zaqq?q confessed : "I heard from Junayd one word about Nirvana. That has occupied me without rest for 40 years, and even now I am absorbed in that word as if in a sea".16 Suffused with the grandeur of "Gnosis", Shibl? said to the people who filled his assembly room: "You are the seven stars of Sagittarius (qil?da). For you turrets of light will be provided and the angels of heaven will joyfully praise you". He was asked; "Why will these be joyfully praised". He replied: "Because they discuss this knowledge", i.e. the mystical perception of God and the world (mafrifa) which perceives all things according to their deepest essence, recognizing them as epi phenomena of the Godhead, or Ultimate Reality. It is essential that we obtain an insight into the attitude with which the Muslim approaches philosophy and higher learning. The commentary on Suhraward?17 formulates this general experience in Islam in a pertinent manner. This shows that every Muslim philosopher is a born apologist for Islam, and that in the study of "heathen" Greek philosophy no danger for Islamic faith is threatened, and rather that basically the whole of the antique world-wisdom has taught what the Qur'?n teaches, - that there has existed since the remotest ages of man a philosophia perennis which does not conflict with Qur'?nic revelation. Truth has always existed, and all revelations and philosophies partake of and agree in this. Each age can only contribute a fresh formulation of this truth, established once and for all, or more penetrating discoveries about the deeper meaning. A real battle between faith and knowledge can therefore never take place. Suhraward?'s commentator says: "In this book the resurrection of the body, all the promises of the Prophet, the miracles and prophecies - all these will be explained. But such knowledge can only be attained through purification of the soul, as Avicenna demonstrated in his 'thesis', in the 'deliverance' and in the 'healing of the soul', in harmony with the</page><page sequence="19">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 19 ancient philosophers. Agathodaimon (Anaximander?), Hermes, Empedoc les, Pythagoras, Socrates, Plata, and others, who strove to acquire God-like characteristics in their moral lives. Affinity with God {taithfllluq) is the goal of ethics and philosophy. Only he who has completely consecrated himself to God during a forty day fasting period can penetrate this mysticism". The accuracy of this historical construction is not in question here. We only wish to draw attention to the monumental liberality of the thought - process and to the absolute certainty with which the believing Muslim confronts philosophical problems. Even the mysteries of Islam which pose difficulties for the faith are assimilated and rendered comprehensible. No thought of rejection arises. Thereby the stage was set upon which the drama of developing Islamic world-views had to be played out. This was necessary for an articulation of the crisis and of the great tension which confronted the individual systems, especially the Greek and mystic systems, in their quest for harmonization with this foundation. Thus the spiritual conflicts and obstacles to faith of individual thinkers manifest themselves and the theological problem consists in the solution of these. With this the life-nerve of theology and also its essential tasks are exposed. The tension between the "foundation" and the "edifice of the system" accounts for the powerful motivating force for the great dis cussions. The Oriental of Aryan race conceives of God as non-individual, abstract (the Buddhist movement in Islam), or as the indeterminate uni versally conceived Being, represented by the sea image, perceived as the immanent inner core in all things (the Brahmanist movement in Islam) or as light, concealed primary light which seeks to reveal and manifest itself (the Persian trend), or as causa adacquata of phenomena (the Greek tendency). How should all this be brought into harmony with the volun taristic God-concept of the Semites? When Islam tried to come to grips with this monumental problem it suffered its most violent convulsions. Modern civilization has brought about a new confrontation between Islam and the historical interpretation of religion and Islam and Relativism. In this Islam can make use of older mystical doctrines which wished to differentiate between the exterior symbols of a religion, considered as a matter of indifference, and the true religious core, which is common in differing degrees to all religions (similarity of essence is not considered identity of spiritual worth).</page><page sequence="20">20 MAX HORTEN By revealing this "inner meaning" mystics wished to surmount the religious crisis. 5. Islamic Classification of World-Views The classification and arrangement of the different types of world views stipulated by the Muslims themselves strikes us as original. We must consider their judgement correct and profound when they place re ligion and philosophy on the same level. The essential identity of religion and life in Oriental civilization demands this. The standard of perfec tion is the affinity to Islam. These divisions are distinguished: 1. Idol worshippers and unbelievers 2. Materialists who worship the four elements (fire, air, water and earth), and the four characteristics (hot, cold, wet, and dry) 3. Philosophers, in the sense of astrologers, who worship the seven planets 4. The dualists with their doctrine of light and darkness 5. The magis, with their fire-worship 6. The Dahriya, atheists who worship no higher Being; actually they recognize the heavenly sphere as the highest and divine principle 7. The Brahmans who consider their religion equal to that of Ab raham 8. Jews 9. Christians 10. Muslims The mystics consider themselves above any narrow-minded concep tion of these groups and J?l? and Ibn al-'Arab?, for example, teach the fundamental and essential similarity between all these, since each, inspite of differences in exterior forms, worships God - that is Ultimate Truth. All religions and world-views differ only relatively - in degrees. III. The Inner Tension of Islamic Culture 1. Tension Due to the Original Interpretation of Foreign Idea - Masses Islam's basic world-view, described above, was soon confronted by a foreign and often hostile group of ideas. If one glances through great</page><page sequence="21">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 21 Muslim historical works - such as the Fihrist of Ihn al-Nad?m (d. 995), and the "History of the Wise of the World" of Qift?, Ibn Abi Usaybi'a, and the bibliographies, one becomes aware of an intellectual stratum which seems alien, even antagonistic to Islam. These are the "sciences of the ancients" (al-qudam?'), of the ancient Greeks and of pre-Islamic peoples in general: Persians, Indians, and indirectly (transmitted via Harr?n and the "Sabians" who resided there) the Orient of remote anti quity; out of all these the Muslims themselves give preference to the ancient Egyptians, represented by the legendary figure of Hermes. In short, we find a world of ideas which, as legends, surrounded the commen tators, yet which in regards to content, stood for a significant reality. An analysis of the contents of this idea - mass is almost impossible to carry out. All philosophical and scientific subjects are represented; mathematics and also astrology are included. If no clear definition according to substance is possible, then a definition according to form must be attempted. By virtue of the religion of the Qur'?n and of the unprecedented Muslim political successes achieved in its name (investing Islam with the sceptre of world sovereignty) a consciousness of the identity of all Muslims and of everything Islamic was forged, brought into relief, and contrasted to everything non-Islamic as a separate and con trasting mass. There was a rupture into two camps. This was a result of circumstances, although no conscious issue was made of the conflict. In the annals of mankind historical events are more powerful and deter minative than individuals. On the intellectual plane the contrast "Islamic culture and non-Islamic culture" appeared at the start equally as stark as on the political plane. The Fihrist (261, 25) coins the formula; the sciences of "the Ancients and the Arabians", which usually (depending on the accompanying texts) signifies "Greeks and Believers in the Qur'?n". 2. The Struggle to Harmonize the Two Components: Islam and Paganism (Non-Islam Obviously it was the Muslims who felt themselves superior. For religious reasons the foreign elements must have seemed to them of lesser value. If enthusiastic partisans of foreign ideas, and they were numerous, were imprudent enough to immoderately praise these, or even give them preference over Islam, the Islamic conviction of superiority was offended. Then a reaction set in from the side of the conservative Believers, often</page><page sequence="22">22 MAX HORTEN giving vent to persecution of intellectuals. A lay movement partial to the foreign culture developed, and even theology split into conservative and liberal camps. Thus the waves of conflict advanced and receded, until gradually a niveau of moderation was attained - the "true scholars" (mutabaqqiq?n) of the late period, who recognized scientific demands and developed philosophy with a tolerant attitude. The ingenious utterances of intellectuals of conviction, and in retaliation, the disparagement and even persecution of science by fanatical theologians and jurists - that is the spectacle of the intellectual struggle which is offered to us. Next we are concerned with a correct evaluation of the two diffe rent battle strategies in this intellectual contest. The great cultural task was the skimming off of un-Islamic elements of foreign culture, the assimila tion of the substantial content of these, and the final clothing in Islamic garb. The Muslims did not want to constantly hear that the Greeks had accomplished a higher civilization than Islam. One cannot expect Islam to confess itself inferior to heathendom. The Greek-pagan appearance of the foreign ideas had to be replaced by something Islamic. This process of assimilation was encouraged by theology's struggle against philosophy; for as the fire of battle became hotter, the intellectuals more energetically endeavored to remove the bone of contention and give Greek wisdom a new Islamic exterior. Autodafe's and fatw?s were the rule of the day, and the liberals were even more inclined to bring about an intimate union between Greece and Islam. 3. The Theological Reaction To the Un-Islamic Milieu This is the course of the cultural evolution in Islam. One extreme is, for instance B?j?r? who reasons with completely Avicenna-like ideas. If his commentary on San?s? were to be translated into Greek, it would hardly be distinguished from a work of Neoplatonism, with the exception of a few specifically Islamic terms. This phenomenon in intellectual history is an example of the terminus of one line of development. At the starting point we find the Hashw?ya, who around 700 reject any addition of "foreign knowledge" to theology. The intermediate links in this chain are on the one hand the creations of scholars, on the other hand, the persecution of these by religious fanatics. These are to be understood as vacillations in the process of adjustment and the end result is the Hellenization of Islamic learning evident at the present time.18 In a work which treats the historical development, the great conflict of the early period must be clearly elaborated; the extreme tension, which</page><page sequence="23">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 23 had to be relieved, will thus be brought into sharp relief. In the period of equalization struggles, the process of Hellenization of the Islamic world of ideas must be dealt with; we will see how the "foreign" gradually loses the tinge of "foreignness" and is fully incorporated into Islamic thought, and how the theological reaction ceases, once it no longer per ceives a tangible object. 4. The Fatw? of Shahraz?r? A legal opinion of Shahraz?r? (d. 1243), advanced in the Ayyubid reign, unconditionally condemns Greek logic and philosophy and re presents these as dangerous for faith. This strikes us as singular, when seen from this broader perspective of the general philosophical evolution. It is noteworthy that this counter-movement came from the Arabic cul tural sphere, from Egypt, which held sway at that time all the way to Syria. The occurrences in this empire naturally did not in any way challenge the other Muslim empires in Mesopotamia, Persia, or Spain. The inno cuous nature of such a fatw? was already assured, since around 1200 it could no longer direct itself towards any real object; for Avicenna's philo sophy had previously been invested by theologians with an Islamic role. R?z? (d. 1210) had appropriated the building bricks of Avicenna's thought for his own system; Ghaz?l? had one hundred years before substantially domesticated Greek logic for Islam by a modification of terms. Thus Greek philosophy no longer presented itself as something "foreign". Islam had by now assimilated this and removed the target from attacks of fanatics. Moreover Tus? (d. 1274) and ?j? (d. 1335) soon appeared on the scene and illustriously completed the intellectual synthesis of the age, incorporating Greek knowledge in a new form. The ideas of Aris totle and Plato had become genuinely Islamic, and without any scruples these were rediscovered in Qur'?nic statements and Prophetic tradition. The ensuing condemnation of Aristotle's writings in the Christian West, which occurred almost simultaneously with the fatw? of Shahraz?r?, was more insidious and pointed. It proceeded from the authority of the Church and struck out at the very beginnings of research on Aristotle. The prohibitions against this research had a definite object; for at that time the Stagirite had not been assimilated into Christian thought pat terns. He was still considered the great pagan who might possibly en danger Christianity. Yet these prohibitions were equally ineffective. "Naturally, when the bans forbade the reading of Aristotle's works</page><page sequence="24">24 MAX HORTEN until they had been corrected, neither the one nor the other actually came to pass. For, as a matter of fact, no official revision of Aristotle's books was carried out; yet since the beginning of the second half of the 13th century they were read by an ever expanding public. When in 1255 all of Aristotle's work was made the basis of instruction in the artes at the University of Paris, the legislative document was only following an established practice."19 "Probably because of the agitation caused by the pantheism and antinominalism of 'Amalric and the Amalricians there was a feeling that censuring the natural philosophical and the meta physical writings of Aristotle might check the spread of the new ideas. Yet all bans and prohibitions were fruitless. They soon became ineffec tive and the only successful - the intellectual?approach was initiated."20 5. The Intensification of the Intellectual Conflict The natural rules which govern the evolution of great intellectual syntheses usually produce a vigorous conservative counter-movement in defense of the status quo. The conservative reaction is crushed and often even accelerates the entrance of the new. An outsider could be misled into drawing historical conclusions from the fatw? above and inferring that philosophy ceased to exist in the following period. Equally absurd would be concluding from the Christian censures of Aristotle, that since the nineteenth century the West was no longer acquainted with his thought. It may be claimed that these censures prevented public ins truction in Aristotle's thought for a few years; but in the history of philo sophy it is a matter of indifference whether spirits gifted with genius approach the intellectual sources publicly or in secret. A prohibition can hamper scholarly activity, but secret proceedings are not so easily inhibited. A censure may even draw attention to what is forbidden and thus stimulate the denouement. To all appearances the 13th and 14th centuries were intensely devoted to the study of these "forbidden" books; for it is this very period which produces the most illustrious representatives of new and comprehensive cultural syntheses, completely imbued with Avicenna's spirit. The history of philosophy is not concerned with fatw?s of fanatics, but with the facts of intellectual evolution; these realities are immediately obvious to us, and no theoretical conclusion about the effect of a fatw? can prevail. The facts become apparent to us through the great works of the period following the fatw?, works completely permeated by Greek</page><page sequence="25">ISLAMIC PHILOOSPHY 25 thought. So it is apparent that the attacks of fanaticized theologians did not succeed in eliminating Greek knowledge from Islam; on the contrary, the process of assimilation seems to have been accelerated. The "facts" of intellectual history are ideas, and, if we consider the leading Muslim theologians to the present time, these ideas are completely Neo-Platonic, of Persian or Indian influence. In western Christianity as well, the prohibitions of 1210 may have stimulated responsible spirits to strive even more diligently for a solution to the crisis. "The sciences of the ancients" are flatly denounced with the at tributes "forbidden sciences" and "wisdom mingled with unbelief"21. In the end these lead to unbelief, that is to ttftll or "robbing the God - concept of all positive content", to denial of the attributes and percep tibility of God, perhaps even of God's control of the world. This is re ported from Spain in Avicenna's time22 and also through Y?q?t and S?y?t? concerning eastern Islam, especially of the Arabic race. Averroes is already considered suspect because he deals with the "forbidden sciences", and from Kind?'s era this censorious judgement was applicable to all the philosophers. The title "philosopher" was a great insult, as shown by the biography of Ab? Ma'shar; in his conservative period he reviled Kind! by using that term. However, it must not be inferred from this popular view, that the philosophers were, in fact, unbelievers according to the concepts of the Muslim orthodoxy. Concerning that we should consult neither the masses nor narrow-minded fanatics among theologians, we must refer to the works and the lives of these philosophers themselves; otherwise even Thomas Aquinas could be labelled a heretic, for his teachings were condemned by many bishops. And here we must distinguish a situation in which a philosopher, let us say Avicenna, sets forth doctrines, from which others draw heretical conclusions, never occurring to the philosopher himself. In such a case the philosopher cannot be held accountable for these perverted doctrines. Only a completely factual analysis of the philosopher's actual ideas can lead to recognition of the truth. The great intensity of the conflict between the knowledge of re velation and that of reason becomes apparent in the spiritual battles of conscience waged by one or another individual philosopher. Irbil? (d. 1262) was an adept of philosophy for his entire life and decided his contest of conviction in favour of the Greeks. On his deathbed, however,</page><page sequence="26">26 MAX HORTEN his religious conscience apparently again had the upper hand, and the last word's, which dramatically terminated his life were "Allah the Great has spoken the truth; it is Avicenna who has lied." 6. The Apologetica! Problem With the preceding description of the state of Islamic philosophy in mind, we can characterize the great apologetical problem as the most determinative strand in the fabric of Islam's intellectual life. Thus we can understand the attitude of philosophers who consider their role as primarily apologetic. We can comprehend Islam from this point of view and pursue this aspect in detail; then we will find that something essential, although not everything of course, has been stated. At the root of every world-system in Islam the apologetical question can be found; this operates within the systems as a latent - not always materially visible - force, determining the critical decisions. Just as the philosophy of a St. Thomas can be considered from the standpoint: "How did he manage to reconcile Greek thought with Christianity"; so Avicenna and others can be viewed according to the guiding question: "How did they manage to harmonize Greek intellectual civilization with Islam"? And in this way we certainly penetrate beneath the surface of events. As in the first instance, Neo-Platonism and Christianity stand face to face, so here we have Neo-Platonism and Islam seeking synthesis. Other spheres of ideas here also enter the picture. Parsism and Indian concepts are poles apart from Islam and strive towards accord. The individual systems represent attempts to resolve the resulting tensions and conflicts. In each system the radically conflicting elements must be brought into clear focus, so that the striving towards a common centre may be directed and channelled; thus the pivot of the system will be revealed. Each dulture strives to crystallize its innermost resources into a unity, for discord and dissension are psychically unbearable and contrary to the essence of personality.1 For these reasons the spiritual battles of Islam have been exceedingly violent. The annals of these struggles have been written with the life-blood of the followers. 7. The Unity of Intellectual Civilization in Islam The attempts to resolve these conflicts vary according to the diffe rent cultural strata. The lower tiers of folk culture are satisfied with an ostensible solution; astrology and soothsaying are in this case the established forms of religion which Islam must overlay with a m r? ?d</page><page sequence="27">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 27 vanced configuration. Magic and star-divination are therefore just as strictly forbidden as apostasy. How do the masses manage? Magic is practiced in "Allah's ?ame" and over astrological texts one reads "in the name of Allah the All-Merciful"! Worship of the stars, still practiced after Islam had established itself, had to be abolished as a grievous sin against faith. God's name was always inscribed on amulets and the world view was thereby assimilated with the Qur'?n. The middle cultural stratum of philosophizing dilettantes (i.e. the Brethren of Ba?ra) accomplished an integration of the older pre-lslamic beliefs with the new doctrines by setting23 them up as equals; the divine determination of fate is not caused by the stars alone, formerly a Dahrite doctrine, but is fixed by God, who uses the constellations as His instru mental agents. "The necessary workings and influences of the stars are really part of God's universal plan", and the decrees of providence are "God's knowledge of the effects which produce the workings and influences of the stars". Thus this point is integrated into the system and the harmo nization embraces the entire panoply of problems. The theologians held fast to the doctrine that God directly pro duces all occurrences in the lower world. With this the star-detour is no longer possible, and the idea that God sets forth destinies in the stars becomes a contradiction. When, therefore, after a quick glance, one wonders that the philosophers have found a better apologetical solution than the theologians, this can be thus explained; in their attempts to sup plant pre-lslamic belief in magic, the theologians radically precluded any influences of the stars; but in the philosophical tolerance of a certain astral efficacy, the gate was opened once more to a religion of magic. In this respect the higher level presents no uniform picture of attempts to resolve such conflicts. Astral thought can be easily incor porated into the framework of philosophy, in that the stars take on the role of secondary causes under the comprehensive control of the primary cause. Human actions of will are also adjusted into this "claim of causes."24 Yet for specific Islamic thought this doctrine is an abomination, for it has the astral dimension as its rudimentary stage. The later religious stratum critically struggles with the beliefs immediately preceding it and sees in them its greatest threat. The solution of philosophy, which to us seems so harmonious, would not be sanctioned by theology. However, practical life was more pressing and Islamic law tolerated the practice of magic, provided it was carried out in Allah's name.</page><page sequence="28">28 MAX HORTEN The residual world-beliefs of dynamism and animism were likewise assimilated into Islam. There was belief in the dynamic nature of stones, but Allah's name was inscribed upon these. The existence of spirits is not doubted in the least; these spirits have, however, been included in Allah's world-plan, and some have even converted to Islam. It is therefore evident that Islam has been practical and tolerant vis-a-vis earlier phases in the conceptual evolution of mankind, although it has established some exclusive and excluding theories. We shall not take up any more space here with a discussion of Islamic tolerance; it has already been amply demonstrated in the literature.25 But the idea of Islam's open-mindedness and receptivity to foreign ideas is an impor tant conclusion to these observations. Although theological counter movements can be noted, these are very limited in time and extent, and emerge from the Arab sphere of influence; whereas the Persian domain has always exhibited great intellectual flexibility26 (consider the B?tin?ya movement). Because of remark of "the Brethren of Basra"27 the apologetical motivation of the philosophical movement was called into question. "Philosophical minds", they say, "find the literal meanings of the revela tions absurd, and deep within they deny these; however they do not outwardly express these doubts in 'fear of the sword'." The "Brethren" here are speaking of philosophical dilettantes, sham philosophers, who "ponder anthropomorphic accounts from the message of salvation, apply their intellectual standards to these, and in the process neglect the true and actual meaning. They hold to the apparent literal sense and thereby fall prey to doubt and helplessness. They finally deny even this in their hearts, yet dare not confess this publicly, because they 'fear the sword' ". This statement is reminiscent of that of Bacon of Verulam, namely that superficial pursuit of the sciences tempts one away from religion, whereas deeper draughts from the cup of science lead again to God. Moreover it is entirely in keeping with the mentality of the "Brethren"28 according to whom only the "novices of philosophy and those who have halfway comprehended it", that is pseudo-philosophers, slight religious ties, in that they reject the anthropomorphisms of the books of revelation. This rejection, however, results from their "deficiency in comprehension", because of which they cannot grasp the true meaning of these images, and</page><page sequence="29">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 29 from the "defe?tiveness of their knowledge of the essences of transitory things in the sublunary world". Therefore the "Brethren" consider as their task "the investigation of both faith and knowledge and the revelation of the true essence of both philosophical speculation and prophecy" in order to bring to light the complete harmony of both. Accordingly they seek to smooth the path of faith and turn back those who, involved in the conscience strug gles of the age, doubt or inwardly disbelieve; for it is hot the "philoso phical minds" who are led to unbelief, but rather the "un-philosophieal". This intellectual flexibility has often been exaggerated and claimed as an Oriental racial characteristic,29 because the most heterogeneous concepts are fused in the Oriental soul and no especially exacerbating contradiction is experienced. Today this is called the co-ordination of the thought process or the "multipartite" quality of the soul. This explana tion may be valid for the activity of the imagination. As far as intellectual civilization as a whole is concerned, however, as the apology shows, there is an intense striving towards a uniform world-outlook. This has been the focal point of the greatest struggles. And even though the most diverse world-images are fused in the thought of today's Oriental, as we have seen, this jn no way belies that the carrier of these is endeavoring to reconcile the contradictions. Admittedly, the most conflicting ideas are found in the same world-vision, but only as building blocks. These do not form, individually and separately, the foundations of the world-view; only in this impossible case would there exist fundamental contradictions. Observers have overlooked this essential point. They concentrated on the most heterogeneous ingredients and in the process forget that these in themselves do not constitute the construction principle. These are all encased in a homogeneous superstructure and are governed by a uniform basic principle which dissolves the illusory and peripheral in consistencies. The powerful striving for unity of the Islamic spirit results from the ideal of education; the aim is to create a complete personality, there fore the moral ideal of life is considered part of philosophy, and the encyclo pedic comprehension of all knowledge is established as the apex of educa tion ( mpaie Leibniz). Natural scientists therefore had to come to terms with philosophy - and philosophers with natural sciences. The harmonic development of all faculties was required. A culture which</page><page sequence="30">30 MAX HORTEN keeps such an ideal of the complete personality before its eyes will always intensely strive to eliminate any discord and tension from its spiritual being. Even today one hears it said (in spite of many a correction of this misconception) that the Arab philosophers had embraced a religion of reason and nature and were far in advance of their times, perceiving in Islamic symbolism and in all positive religions the primitive first stage of a future religion without revelation. This falsification of history has today been absolutely refuted and revoked. For its philosophers Islam is no naive and imaginary Bedouin vision - a primitive beginning of a future religion of nature. The anticipation of some Western intellectual fathered this thought. A fanciful illusion, a historical fata morgana was created, which dissolved into thin air upon scholarly scrutiny. Without revelation there is no religion. That is the self-evident presupposition of Muslim philosophers. The culmination of revelation was fulfilled in the Qur'?n. The Greeks and pre-Islamic thinkers have possessed germs of this revelation, but because of the limitations of human reason they could not comprehend the full message which Muham mad had been able to communicate to mankind. All other religions are imperfect preliminary stages for the unique truth of divine revelation in Islam; among these Judaism and Christianity are preparations willed by God. Christianity relates to Islam as Judaism to Christianity. Of the so often invoked "double truth" we find not the slightest trace neither in Averroes nor in Islam. Admittedly great mystics such as Ibn 'Arab!31 have extolled the essential similarity of all religions, and "modern man's" heart beats faster when he reads such sublime poetry. But the search for what is essential must not be led astray by subjective attitudes. Similarity of essence does not mean identity of value. Even for 'Ibn 'Arab! (in spite of all the splendid words which seem to suggest otherwise) Islam is the most perfect and most meaningful of the religions. The deeper spiritual strata always claims the superiority of Islam; and 'Umar Khayyam was, as Ab? Nuw?s, no absolute cynic, but rather a mystic. A new external order of life - of social as well as political life can only be conceived by the Oriental in terms of a renewal of religion; for the profane in Islam is not a field separate from the religious. A basic centralization is still prevalent* since the entire sublunary world,</page><page sequence="31">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 31 not only a part of it, is determined by the forces of the heavenly world. So the new order must proceed from heaven, that is, God, as did the es tablishment of the original order. Otherwise the authority and confor mity, which this order must have as a result of its subordination to the divine, would be missing. There would be inconceivable disorder in the universe if the sublunary world could arbitrarily determine its circum stances. The fusion of all phases of life, so typical of the Orient, accordingly has its origins in the astral and theosophic world-vision. This perceives the universe as a metaphysical and dynamic unity, from which no one member can extricate itself as an independent entity. These characteris tics are evident even in the most recent movements experienced by the Orient, known as B?bism. The new order called forth by the exigencies of modern civilization is, in the oriental view, to be introduced by a new order in religion. With these concepts of the complete unity of life in mind, we can understand, in retrospect, the earlier "foundings of religions". These were socio-political reorganizations, which had become necessary for further natural development. The Oriental spirit sought a philoso phical basis for these, in order to invest the new with spiritual authority. Christian missionaries constantly encounter extraordinary difficul ties in their attempts to convert Muslims to Christianity. These difficulties may be understood from the previous description of the Islamic world view. A Muslim converting to Christianity is excluded from the all embracing unity of life in his culture and violates the "divine world-order". An opinion, advanced occasionally even by Orientalists, that the Orient can only reform by abolishing Islam23 - is incomprehensible appalling. NOTES The question of system and history in Islamic philosophy presents itself, in the intellectual milieu of modern Germany, differently than in the "historical** period. The basic errors of Zeller (over-emphasis on biography, bibliography, history, and philology) should be avoided at all costs. It is expedient to direct atten tion to the broad connections and associations, to make longitudinal studies of problems and movements ? not cross-sectional surveys according to artificial time-definitions. For this is not to be a chronicle of the individual philosophers, but rather a presentation ?f the life and evolution of their thoughts. We are concerned with their philosophies, not their careers. However, the essence of a phenomenon must be understood before the problem of history is tackled (failure to recognize this was the mistake of the "historical" century). So we should first</page><page sequence="32">32 MAX HORTEN outline the total system of the Islamic world-view (the static approach) and from this point survey past and future lines of development: from the standpoint of the accomplished?we observe the developing, from general characteristics?particulari ties and exceptions, from the whole?its parts. For we are to limit ourselves to a macroscopic observation and must overlook particular (typical of smaller groups) or even individual traits. An exhaustive presentation of Islamic philosophy will never be possible in Europe; for the source material is a boundless sea, alien to today's thought?patterns and not easily comprehended. The interest which European intellectuals took in the "Arabs" (as the Is lamic philosophers since the Middle Ages were called) dates from Averroist struggles of high Scholasticism ; for this reason we find studies of "Arab" philosophy in works of Scholasticism, although only as an incidental?episode. Orientalists wasted little or no attention on these questions concerning Islamic high civilization, and so a dis integration of the formal and material preconditions resulted. The Scholastics were familiar with the contents, but dispensed with study of the actual material (M. de Wulf with accounts characterized by fewer d?ficiences in the Italian translation, 1913; Picavet 1907; J.M. Verweyen 1917; too little in Baumker in: "Culture of the Present," I, V). Some Orientalists found their way to the lifeless material, but lacked understanding of the contents, (furnishing only the most general views of parts of the external material H.S. Nyberg: Ibn al-'Arabi, 1919; Obermannn: Ghaz?l?'s Subjectivity). Both these elements are missing in Uberweg-Heinze (outline of the other biography). There is an attempt to reconcile these elements in B. Carra de Vaux (Avicenne 1900; Ghaz?l? 1902), Miguel As?n Palacios (1901-1914; compare J VI, 106 B, all in all about of 29 pertinent works in Spanish and French). Because of Europe's lack of appreciation for and customary misunderstanding of the Orient, interest in Oriental philosophy is limited to a very narrow circle ; understanding of Oriental philosophy is limited to an even narrower circle, and even this sphere is characterized by a false approach, considering only what was familiar to Christian Scholasticism and rejecting all elements of purely Islamic nature. The path to truth is here also blocked by rubble heaps of human error. The outsider can hardly arrive at a correct idea of the wealth of philoso phical material in Oriental-Islamic literature. The greatest part of Arab, Persian, and Turkish literature can be included here; for in this literature the writer somehow relates himself to world and human life in its totality, in that a certain broad view of both world-vision and life-teachings (morality) results. The raw material there fore exists in large quantities, and the Orient has made much of this available, often in excellent works. Often a comparison with the original manuscript, espe cially for personal names, is necessary for scholarly work. Otherwise the texts are completely reliable, and the critical research is easily accomplished along with the study of the contents. Oriental scholars still experience vital links with their past, links which in our own case, have been torn asunder by the mighty advances of the modern age. Thus we often confront these Oriental texts helplessly. Many Orientalists have copied these texts and supplied variants, a mechanical work, occasionally described as "scholarly". Some have also laboured to understand these and after a short</page><page sequence="33">ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY 33 unsuccessful attack and abortive exertions, have given it all up as hopeless. The ideas themselves remained enigmatic, because they were incorporated without any thorough preparatory study of medieval thought-forms. The metaphysical nature of-Oriental thought has become alien to the West, although our Middle Ages followed the same thought-patterns. Today's pheno menology, however, is in many respects reminiscent of this trend. Therefore it is forgivable if people who have been studying the Orient for years, and in a broad sense could be considered Orient experts, find themselves helpless before the prob lem of existence vs essence. And yet this constitutes the main strand in the fabric of Oriental philosophy. In the Persian cultural sphere this is hidden behind terms of Light- philosophy, yet it still remains the underlying concept. The surviving designations of well-known movements are often inaccurate, since definition was attempted according to the conceptual material, the building blocks of the system, not according to its "form", its spirit, or its true substance. The Greek movement was called Aristotelian, and when the inapplicability of this designation was realized, no basically better title could be decided upon. So the movement was inconsistently characterized "the Neo-Platonic School of Arab Peripatetics". Yet the "Arab Peripatetics" are first of all Persians rather than Arabs, and furthermore followers of Plotinus rather than Peripatetics. It would be more logical to speak of "Islamic Neo-Platonists". Of course it is not possible to avoid characterizing the philosophers as having Greek, or better Hellenic tendencies. Here we must emphasize that the Greek dependencies are mostly those of the raw material, yielding only the rudiments of construction, and that Hel lenism here, in its core, already must be considered as belonging to the Oriental cultural and intellectual world. The typical Oriental spiritual foundation is the re ligious-theosophical, which considers a mysterious, almost "magical" world - fundament as the only truly efficacious element in the lively interpl?y of phenomena (from this ? Occasionalism), or as the essential carrier of our visible world (the Maya-doctrine of Islamic mysticism). All is animated by mysterious forces (the philosophical and theological conception) and "carried" (the mystic outlook). The last trend points to India. 1. In the systems of Ibn Masarra (d. 931) and his contemporary Hall?j these compo nents and contrasts are already distinct. Horten, M. "Besprechung von Miguel As?n Palacios; Abenmasarra" in Der Islam III, 106 ff. 2. One deeply rooted error should be corrected here: Allahu akbar is translated as "God is the Greatest", which actually would be al-akbar. The only grammatically correct possibility is, "The (only) God is greater", i.e. than the demons and night creatures (spirits), who throng around the Muslim as he prepares for his prayers, in order to distract him away from God. The kibriy? = God's majesty extolls sublime superiority and power over the spirits and realm of darkness. 3. Subk? : Tabaq?t 5, 204, ZDMG. 62, 64, 2. 4. Dhahab? : Tabaq?t 3,135. 5. The myth of the blue heavens and of the God "concealed" there is (compare the "unknown" God of the Gospels) a theme which runs through all the world*systems</page><page sequence="34">34 MAX HORTEN of the Orient. "Ultimate Reality" and "Primary Light** are considered equal. A people living in a rainy climate would not establish this myth as the centre of its intellectual life, religion, science, ethics, social customs ?as does the Oriental. Symbols of the Shah*s majesty are light - motifs! This idea of "concealment" has nothing in common with that of the "magic soul"; for "magical" means, in reference to clear concepts, only fairytale atmosphere and world of enchantment. The astral motifs and the related Light-philosophy however are worlds apart from this mentality. To call all this "magic" is inaccurate and vague. No Muslim philosopher dares attempt a definition of God. For them God is undefinable and ineffable. The singular Light-philosophy of the Orient is undoubtedly the final root of this belief. 6.

The catchword "multipartite" fails just as "magical" to capture the essence of the Orient, even thought there is truth in both descriptive terms. The Orient has no single soul, no uniform culture, but rather represents a variety of essentially different cultures and mentalities. 30.

Ab? al-Nuw?s and 'Umar Khayy?m subject Islam to blunt scorn; but these poets never ridicule religion as such. Their cynicism i s relative, and Qazw?ni (Cosmography II, 209 ff, chapter on Baghdad towards the end) proves that Ab? al-Nuw?s was a good Muslim. Gobineau is cer tainly correct when he emphasizes Islam's capacity for growth and receptivity to other cultures (Les Religions et des Philosophies dans l'Asie centrale, 25 ff) : "It is difficult to share the opinion of those who see in Muslim dogma a direct obstacle</page><page sequence="36">36 MAX HORTEN to intellectual development. The contrary is, as a matter of fact, easier to prove. A religion which has coined the formula: 'The ink of scholars is more precious than the blood of martyrs, and which further assures, that on Judgement Day each will be rigorously held accountable for the use of his God-given reason, cannot, injustice, be regarded as hostile to intellectual efforts". "I absolutely refuse to accuse of obscurantism a faith which one could reproach for resembling a quite vague and undefined philosophy, rather than a precisely defined life-style (observance), a faith which has let others achieve the numerous splendid intellectual Golden Ages, when not accomplishing these itself; the facts prove these accusations to be lies, and Islam should therefore be spared such reproaches". Yet Islam has not "let others achieve its high civilizations"; rather, it is believing Muslims who have created these cultures, and who have seen therein an unassaillable apology for Islam. Philoso phers such as Avicenna or Averroes were completely convinced that they had to defend the teaching of the Qur'?n (which they considered infallible) and its divine authority against scepticism, and that they had to show, that the Greek doctrines were not prejudicial to correctly conceived faith; concepts of a double truth (an ephemeral sensation of Latin Averroes - followers) are completely foreign to Averroes' nature and to the nature of the entire Orient. 32. Hartman, Martin, F?nf Vortr?ge ?ber den Islam, Leipzig, 1912, p. 113. According to this author, Islam originated (p. 35) as Muhammad "exhibiting nervous, cramped symptoms, gave out phrases which were experienced by himself and his milieu as inspirations of the highest wisdom". The error in this remark, incredible, and not worthy of criticism, is that it completely ignores Islam's philosophical foundation - at the same time its population movement, cultural development, religious revival, social impulse, and moral demands. Islam cannot be made comprehensible when it is presented as a chance phenomenon arising out of a delirium; and whoever overlooks the most essential question in Islam's formation will only spread false conclusions. The essential question is that of Muhammad's authority as1 a person. How was Muhammad able to overcome the original contempt shown him,to achieve supernatural authority in ever-widening circles of followers?</page></plain_text>
