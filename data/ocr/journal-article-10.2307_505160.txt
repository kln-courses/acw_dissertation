<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Anatolia MACHTELD J. MELLINK This review of excavations, survey, and research in Anatolia in 1989 is again selective. Whatever subjec- tive emphasis may be applied, the overall trends are evident. They come to light at the annual symposium for excavators and researchers organized by the Turk- ish Ministry of Culture and its Directorate of Antiq- uities and Museums. These symposia are a blessing to all Anatolian archaeologists who are called in to report to a general forum and who thus have the opportunity to learn about the vast range of annual excavations and surveys in progress. The blessing is strenuous. In 1989 over 150 papers were presented in five days, including the survey and archaeometry reports; time for discussion in the official sessions is limited. Yet the principle of this unique international event is excellent, the more so since the reports appear in print within a year. Generous hospitality provides relaxation and opportunity for symposiastic dis- course. The 1990 session was saddened by the loss of one of the leading archaeologists in eastern Turkey, Alba Palmieri, who died in Rome on 10 April 1990. Her leadership in the excavations of Arslantepe-Malatya, her illuminating study of this site in the upper Eu- phrates valley and its confrontation of Transcauca- sians and Late Uruk pioneers, her eloquent discussions of Arslantepe in Anatolian and Mesopo- tamian context, and her generous friendship to col- leagues will continue to be a source of admiration and affection. In the region of the upper Euphrates and Tigris in eastern Turkey, major ancient developments have been brought to light by regular as well as emergency excavations. The sites in the flood zones of the Ka- rakaya and Atatuirk dams in the Euphrates are nearly all drowned, including the great mound of Samsat, where Late Uruk levels were reached on a limited scale. Iron Age Kummuh was retrieved in samples of its fortifications and bits of ruined sculptures. The major effort was the recording of the sumptuous palace of King Mithradates of Commagene. The pre- history and history of the Euphrates area will be put together in a composite manner with the aid of results from a series of mounds sampled by rescue teams from Samsat in the south to Kalek6y and $emgiyetepe in the north. Tille is still accessible and yielding early Iron Age strata. Nevall (ori, slowly endangered by the Atatfirk Dam lake, has given us impressive evi- dence for art and architecture of Aceramic Neolithic, notably the ritual complex that held tall stelae carved with anthropomorphic figures in a formal setting (figs. 1-2). The nature and development of Aceramic Neolithic settlements in the Euphrates and upper Tigris area become better known annually also through surveys in the Qaybnii-Ergani area; archaeometallurgists are studying the incipient working of copper at Qay6nii. In central Anatolia, Aplkh Hdyiik will contribute its own chapter to the story of Aceramic Neolithic ram- ifications. iKIZTEPE SAMSUN TEKiRDAG I NBUL PENDiK iZMiT AINOS YARIMBURGAZ N AMASYA MARMAR iZNiKiNANDIK ALAC HUYUK *MA?AT ILIPINAR LILIPIRY M ESKIYAPAR TROY DASKYLAION ANKARA ATPATEPNORCS BOGAZKOY BE~iKTEPE DEMIRGI HUVUK 0R DI0N 0A D L CE ASSOS VANDILCEVA SM THEION AEZANI DKAMAN AERGAMON AA PESSINUS KEBAN YORTAN * AceoELAZIG (9112 PEAMORIUM PANAZTEPE KULTEPEEZAVUSTEPE e SA AFYON ?AA A BAYNAZTEPE LI U AFARSLANTEPE- * UAKLAZOMEN MALATYA CAFER BATMAN e SARDIS .A?IKLI CAybNU ERYTH RAI ILGIN* ACEMHUYUK IAROS ALA$EHIR . 4-ERAPL1SN E TILLE HASSEK Di YARBAKIR EPH ESUS-NDE GRITILLENEVALICPORI CiZRE \-\ * KARAHUYK KOSKHUYUK SAMSAT.LIDA.

MELLINK [AJA 95 Plans for new dams in the Euphrates south of Bi- recik now put a major challenge to excavators to rescue the Late Uruk sites close to Carchemish. The city itself will just escape flooding but it is in a precar- ious position astride the Turkish-Syrian border. The dams in the Tigris area will engulf a less known world, with victims from Seljuk (Hasan Keyf) and Roman (Bezabde) to Aceramic and Palaeolithic eras. New teams will have to be recruited to match the energy of the veterans of the Keban and lower Euphrates campaigns. The march of technology is unstoppable, as is also evident from interviews by Diane Raines Ward (Smithsonian 21:5 [August 1990] 28-41). Outside of the floodzones, two mounds east and west of the Euphrates will enlighten us on Syro-Mes- opotamian transit routes to Anatolia in the third mil- lennium B.C. At Girnavaz near Nusaybin, a cemetery of the Early Dynastic II period is providing ample evidence for burial customs and ceramic, metallurgi- cal, and glyptic crafts; at Oylum Hdytik, southwest of Gaziantep, good comparative data are beginning to emerge from a series of burials of late EB-early MB date. In central Anatolia, excavations have been resumed at Acemh6yiik-Burushattum (?) where the layout of the palaces and public building area of the 18th cen- tury B.C. will be investigated. At Kiiltepe the Karum Ib and Ia levels bring us closer to the link with Old Hittite history. At Bogazk6y the South Citadel and adjoining territory, in addition to the built chamber of Shuppiluliuma II with its reliefs and texts, revealed Hittite fortifications of subsidiary areas of the capital, as well as the remodeling and reuse of this citadel in several stages by Phrygian newcomers. The arrival of the Phrygians at Gordion seems to become tangible. The trenches excavated in the cen- tral plaza of the Midas citadel revealed three levels of architectural remains in the form of "pit-houses," the earliest two with some use of orthostatic stones and an inventory of handmade, "barbaric" pottery, the third a burnt wattle-and-daub house in which the pottery was wheelmade and of Phrygian type (fig. 14). The Phrygians were the subject of a symposium organized by the Middle East Technical University at Ankara and Anatolian University at Eski"ehir in June 1990; the great asset of this venture as planned by Prof. Sevim Bulug was the discussion of Phrygian facts and problems at the major sites and in front of the monuments in and west of Ankara (Hacltugrul, newly activated; Gordion; Yazlihkaya; and other highland sites). Western Anatolia is gradually revealing its contri- bution to the pre-Bronze Age development of south- eastern Europe and Anatolia in general. Yarimburgaz on the coast near Istanbul, in addition to its Lower Palaeolithic deposits, has a Neolithic-Chalcolithic se- quence, also observed at Toptepe-Eregli. In the re- gion of Iznik, Ilhplnar will yield a reliable stratification and a much needed study of West Anatolian timber architecture. At Troy, the EB Age is being scrutinized especially in its Troy I phases; the results will be helpful for the understanding of Troy I period sites along the Thra- cian and Anatolian coasts, and will aid the future excavators of EB harbor stations along the West An- atolian coast such as Bayrakli-Old Smyrna and Li- mantepe-Klazomenai. For the contact zones with the Aegean in the second millennium B.C., Troy will contribute evidence from the lower city. In Panaztepe, a test case of interaction in the lower Hermus valley is under investigation. The most articulate context is coming from the ship- wrecks off the Lycian coast at Ka?-Uluburun and Cape Gelidonya, meticulously excavated and analyzed. In the Classical era, two trends remain noticeable. One is that more and more temples, theaters, stoas, and gateways are being partially restored and pro- tected against the elements and human carelessness. Anastylosis and guidelines will help the visitors, who arrive in steadily larger numbers. The second trend is that historical and prehistoric stratification is being looked at or at least thought about under many of the spectacular marble sites. Miletus has a steady pro- gram, at Pergamon the earlier building levels and fortifications are being systematically examined, and the old city and cemetery levels of Ephesus are being probed. On the other hand, at Troy the neglected Classical remains overlying the famous citadels and lower city of VI and VII now will have the full atten- tion of the new excavation program. Bibliography.

PALAEOLITHIC, NEOLITHIC, CHALCOLITHIC Yarnmburgaz. In 1989, as reported by Professors Gfiven Arsebfik, F. Clark Howell, and Mihriban Oz- bagaran, geomorphological and palaeoecological study of the upper and lower caves made good prog- ress. In addition to aves, chiroptera, insectivora, roden- tia, and lagomorpha, this year pisces emerged from fine sieving, whether brought in by humans or animals. The largest group among mammals is ursus. Equidae, suidae, cervidae, and bovidae are represented. Some fossilized bones have stone tool marks as evidence of butchering. In the lower cave, work concentrated in three trenches. In trench S, measuring 3 x 4 m, 2 m of deposit were excavated; bedrock was not reached. Seven strata were distinguished. Level 4 has the great- est quantity of Lower Palaeolithic tools and faunal evidence. In trench T (4 x 4 m) levels 3 and 4 were the most prolific. In general, among over 1200 stone tools collected so far, flaked tools are about 80% of the total. Large pebbles, chunks, cores, choppers, and hammerstones make up the remainder. There are no bifacial Acheulean types, and no signs of Levallois technique. Choppers are rare. The Yarimburgaz in- dustry in general is simple but functional. Archaeomagnetic tests have given provisional ages of 350,000 and 400,000 B.P. for the Lower Palaeo- lithic strata. All available data belong to the first half of the Middle Pleistocene. An illustrated report on the 1989 campaign ap- peared in Symposium 11:1 (1989) 9-38; electron spin resonance analyses of bones in Archaeometry Sympos- ium 5 (1989) 133-46; a discussion of molluscs in Ar- keoloji ve Sanat 40-41 (1988) 28-32. A general introduction to the site is found in Miize 1 (1989) 77- 80. Karain. Prof. Imln Yalqnkaya expanded and deep- ened the excavation in area E, where late Upper Palaeolithic and Middle Palaeolithic levels were ex- amined. A second major part of the cave system, area F, was explored in a sample. A new topographic plan of the Karain cave was made. In the nearby cave of Okizini, previously excavated by the late Kili K6k- ten, the profile of the old excavation was cleaned and studied in the context of the ecological environment of Karain along the north edge of the Antalya Plain. Reports appeared in Symposium 11:1 (1989) 39-57 and Archaeometry Symposium 5 (1989) 77-86. Gaziantep Area, Hatay. Dr. Angela Minzoni Der- oche has worked for four campaigns in the area of the west bank of the Euphrates, where artifacts of Middle Acheulean and Middle Palaeolithic type were collected and a workshop of Levallois type was lo- cated. In the Hatay, ample evidence is found for an Upper Palaeolithic industry in coastal caves ca. 18-20 m above sea level. The study of lithic traditions in Anatolia and the Levant continues. Tigris Area Survey. In the context of the survey project of Dr. Guillermo Algaze, considerable evi- dence was gathered for the Palaeolithic era by Dr. Michael Rosenberg who reports extensive lithic scatter on the ridges extending out from Ramandag, from where the Batman River joins the Tigris east in the direction of Hasankeyf, and also on the less steep ridges on the other side of the Tigris. The industry is tentatively called Ramanian, dominated by choppers, discoidal cores, Levallois cores, pyramidal flake cores, side scrapers, and transverse scrapers. Less common are hand axes and denticulates. In addition, many caves contain artifacts of Upper Palaeolithic type. Cay6nii. In 1989, Dr. Mehmet Ozdo an reports, the ceramic Neolithic and later habitation of the site was investigated. The ceramic mound overlies the slopes of the aceramic site, which developed on two natural hills separated by a streambed. The upper ceramic layers contain dark-faced burnished pottery just antedating the Halaf period. Below this, mono- chrome burnished ware appears with some knobbed and incised ornament; there also is painted pottery in some variety with red stripes, triangles, and chevrons. Husking trays, animal figurines, and stylized human figurines turn up in these levels, the preserved archi- tecture of which consists of terrace walls and rows of stones set on edge serving as foundations. The affin- ities of the pre-Halaf wares remain to be studied. The report on 1988 in Symposium 11:1 (1989) 59- 79 gives a stratigraphic analysis of the architectural development; this is discussed in more detail by Meh-</page><page sequence="4">126 MACHTELD J.

In 1989, the Aceramic Neolithic building with stelae (House 13) was completely exca- vated, Prof. Harald Hauptmann reports. "This struc- ture in plan, construction, and location clearly differs from the rectangular storage and habitation units of which we have several excavated examples. The stela- building measures 14 x 14 m. A stone wall of 1.40 m thickness enclosed an open space with rounded inner corners (fig. 1). Along the inner face of the enclosure wall smoothed stone slabs (average size 1.00 x 1.50 m) are laid flat, separated by upright stones. The 1.80 m high north wall has a niche of 1.00 x 0.80 m opposite the presumed entrance. An open court of ca. 10 x 10 m has the 2.50 m tall stela illustrated in AJA 94 (1990) 128 fig. 1 in the center. The lower parts of two similar stelae come from the debris. The sculptured stelae and the paving slabs are of hard limestone. The main stela has, in low relief, long bent arms, the hands of which meet on the lower narrow side. The upper part of this stela is worn away by erosion; a projection on the north upper side suggests that a head existed here. Such heads are attested by a stela fragment that was built into the north foun- dations of House 3 (fig. 2). This head, 0.27 m high, projects from the stela-face, and surprises by its good modeling and the clear outlining of the eyelids. The hair is marked by incised lines. It is not yet clear if this head came from one of the stelae in House 13. A fragmentary human torso, AJA 94 (1990) 128 fig. 2, came to light in 1987 among the rubble in front of the niche; additional sculpture fragments were styl- ized heads of a lion and panther. "The building had an outer shell that adjoins the north wall but leaves a space of 1.20 m free along the east and west walls. Terracing was added along the north side. One notes resemblances to the skull-, flag- stone-, and terrazo-buildings of Qay6nii, but the mon- umental sculptures of Nevah Qori are the true marks of a sanctuary. ror Fig. 1. Nevah Qori.

MELLINK [AJA 95 "Layer 3 at Nevalih ori had at least three parallel houses. House 3 was the smallest, measuring 8.00 x 5.30 m, with two long rooms and one broad room, set on a stone platform with three channels covered by stone slabs, over which a stone chip layer runs, sup- porting a clay floor. House 2 is larger, 16.00 x 6.80 m, with long rooms flanking cells. Stone bases along the exterior must have been supports for roof-posts. Skulls and long bones were buried in a pit in the northeast. House 6 measured 12.00 x 5.90 m; it had six rooms. After removal of the clay floor the stone underpinning appeared with five covered cross-chan- nels (fig. 3). This house had a place for the making of stone tools as well as two hearths, roasting places, which may not belong to this level. House 8 is probably also of layer 3 (fig. 4). It is at least 9.50 m long but partly eroded; four channels divide it into five units. Layer 4 is attested by an earlier, largely demolished, structure, House 14, under House 3. "Artifacts are flint tools and points of PPNB type, ground stone axes, quartzite grinding stones, lime- stone bowls and mortars, human stylized figurines of baked clay and of soft lime, and some animal figu- rines. "Habitation is also attested for the Halaf period, with a complex of unusual plan (fig. 5). A tholos of 5.20 m diameter has a rectangular annex of 10.00 x 2.80 m to the west and two annexes to the northeast measuring 8.00 x 2.80 m, enclosing an open area. A small tholos to the east (diameter 3.80 m) had a con- tracted burial of a woman. The pottery includes painted ware analogous to Halaf wares from (avi Tarlasi. "Remnants of EB I walls did not yield house plans, but much EB I pottery comes from pits, as well as copper slag and fragments of crucibles. Two cist- graves had contracted burials, one with three vessels and a copper hammer." Apkkh Hoyuk. This Aceramic Neolithic site on the Melendiz River, ca. 25 km southeast of Aksaray, was discussed by I. Todd in AnatSt 16 (1966) 139-63. It will now be partly submerged by a dam to be put in the river. A rescue excavation was undertaken in 1989 by Prof. Ufuk Esin. Trenches were opened on the north and west slopes. The houses found were rec- tangular in plan and stood closely together. The walls are made of long mudbricks of irregular sizes. One structure had a red floor and red-painted walls, per- haps of ceremonial character. Burials were contracted inhumations found below floors, without gifts. Obsi- dian is used for chipped stone tools. Grinding stones, mortars, small polished celts, beads, and bone and horn tools are common. Hunting was evidently an important resource at Aplkh. Sheep and goat may have been domesticated. The architecture and inventory of Aplkl give evi- dence of an early, hitherto unknown aceramic cultural tradition. Eleven skeletons from the graves were an- alyzed by Prof. Metin Ozbek. The age of the adults ranged from 18 to 57 years; one female had under- gone and survived a trepanation. Ceramic Neolithic: K6ok H6yik-NigOde. Prof. Ugur Silistreli expanded his excavation to the north- east and northwest. The houses of the upper levels have walls on stone foundations with well-preserved hard floors. In a working area three ovens were stand- ing side by side with firepits in front. The domestic inventory includes dark gray pottery, storage jars, stone vessels, grinding stones and mortars, and female figurines. Some of the pottery has ornaments in relief. Most of the chipped stone tools are of obsidian (ca. 90%). Contracted child burials were found under the house floors, with some tomb gifts: sipping vessels, a small fruitstand, obsidian tools, and stone beads. On a floor of level 3 was found a human skull covered with a coating of red plaster. The eyes were inlaid in black stone. Some of the modeling (e.g., of the ear) was well preserved. Among the relief-decorated pottery are fragments with human figures, animals, horns, boukrania, snakes, and braids. One anthropomorphic vase has red-on-white decoration; the head is that of a woman with a small polos. Reports appeared in Symposium 11:1 (1989) 91-97, Festschrift Ozgii( 461-63, and Bel- leten 53 (1989) 361-74 with illustrations of relief ware. Cogkuntepe. Dr. JuOrgen Seeher reports his iden- tification of a Neolithic site south of Gfilplnar on the south coast of the Troad. The earliest occupation of the site, which is about 100 masl, is attested by red- polished jars and bowls of Hacilar IX-VI type. South- west Anatolian Neolithic monochrome ware is there- fore diffused as far as the northwest coast. The evidence will be published in IstMitt 40 (1990). Marmara Ereglisi-Toptepe. Dr. Mehmet Ozdo- gan conducted a rescue excavation jointly with the Tekirdag Museum at the mound of Toptepe, which in 1988-1989 had been largely destroyed by devel- opers of a holiday village. The prehistoric deposit in the remaining segment of the mound was investigated to virgin soil. There had been a long sequence with Kumtepe IA material at the top down to levels cor- responding to VinEa. In the Middle Chalcolithic range a series of phases could be distinguished in levels with thick strata of seashells. In the lower phases, a sizable building came to light. One room had an anthropo- morphic storage vessel about 1 m in height, with angular body, and arms, hands, and facial features rendered in relief. The vessel was painted in red on buff with spirals, triangles, and parallel lines. Euro- pean links are evident, but the main deposits of this</page><page sequence="7">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 129 phase were lost at Toptepe, along with the entire 10 m of the upper deposits of the Bronze Age and the Classical periods. Ihpinar. Dr. J.J. Roodenberg reports that this Neo- lithic-Chalcolithic site on the west shore of the lake of Iznik shows a series of building phases. Phases 6-10 are Early Chalcolithic. The architecture is wattle-and- daub as at Fikirtepe. Walls have vertical posts and horizontal wattling. Floors can be recognized as hav- ing been covered with wood. The houses are rectan- gular and freestanding. Under some walls transverse timbers serve as bedding. The pottery development shows affinities to Fikir- tepe, Yarimburgaz upper levels, and southeast Eu- rope. Radiocarbon dates for phase 10 point to the seventh millennium B.C. A report of 1988 is found in Symposium 11:1 (1989) 99-101; and in Anatolica 16 (1989-1990) 61-144. Mehmet Ozdogan comments on the problems of correlating Neolithic developments in west and north- west Turkey, with special reference to Fikirtepe, De- mircih6yfik, Yarimburgaz and Ilhpmnar in Varia Archaeologica Hungarica 2 (1989) 201-15. H6yiicek. A new excavation was begun by Prof. Refik Duru and Burdur Museum Director Selguk Bayer at the small prehistoric site of H6yuicek-Bucak, 35 km south of Burdur. In three trial trenches rem- nants of walls made of oak saplings and mud-packing came to light. No mudbrick was found in situ, but burnt fragments of walling lay in the upper levels. The pottery showed affinities to the monochrome and Early Chalcolithic painted wares of Kurupay. Some relief ware resembles that of K6ok. Among the small finds are oblong terracotta stamp-seals with geometric designs, spoons, green stone celts, beads, and chipped stone and bone tools. Kurugay. The results of the final (1988) campaign are reported by Prof. Refik Duru in Symposium 11:1 (1989) 81-90 with discussion of the Early Neolithic levels 12 and 13. Burdur-Senirkent Area. Prof. Mehmet Ozsait re- corded eight mounds with Neolithic and Chalcolithic habitation in the region south of Burdur, JKF 11 (1989) 1-22. In the course of his survey of mounds between Senirkent and Hoyran Lake, he identified some Chalcolithic as well as EB I-II material, Research Symposium 7 (1989) 381-89. Eskigehir. Dr. Turan Efe discussed the pottery found at a site on the north bank of the Porsuk, 6 km southwest of Eskigehir, Orman Fidanhgl, in Germania 68 (1990) 67-113. He assigns it to a Middle Chalco- lithic phase following Hacllar I, and examines ties with other regions of Anatolia and the Balkans. See also Anatolica 16 (1989-1990) 7-19. BRONZE AGE SITES Kiiltepe. Prof. Tahsin Ozgfiu reports that in 1989 conservation and repairs of the palace of Warshama, in the inner citadel on the mound, were undertaken in order to protect this oldest known Anatolian palace. In the east part of the central Karum, the new exca- vations again found the layout of streets and houses of the Ia and Ib periods well preserved. The houses have several rooms and are built of mudbrick on stone foundations. The walls are reinforced by vertical tim- ber and stone posts. One Ib house had an archive of 30 envelopes and tablets fallen from shelves and found lying in order at the base of a wall next to a set of pottery vessels. This archive is among the most informative of those recently found. We learn of a hitherto unknown great king named Zuzu, whose place in the king list must come in the later half of the dynasty after Warshama, although the relation to Pithana and Anitta remains uncertain. Stamp- and cylinder-seal impressions of Ib style appear side by side on tablets and envelopes. The pantry had an ample collection of pottery. Among the vessels was a vase painted with bull and stag designs in panels, a rare occurrence in this level. The tombs under the floors of the house had been plundered but still yielded considerable remains of the original inven- tory, e.g., a faience amuletic seal with the "omega" sign (of a type widely known in Anatolia), gold pins and earrings, pieces of gold foil covering the face, and bronze weapons (dagger, axe). In level II, two houses with well-preserved Assyrian archives were uncovered. The first had a large central unit supported by posts on stone bases; in one small area was a group of broken, discarded envelopes and tablet fragments. The archive proper, which had fallen from its shelves, consisted of ca. 100 tablets. Among the other inventory were two small serpentine weights in the shape of ducks. The second house, north of the first, also belonged to an Old Assyrian merchant. Here the archives and selected pottery were found fallen from shelves along the south wall of a long, narrow room. The envelopes carry native Anatolian, Old Assyrian, Old Babylonian, Syrian, and Syro-Cappadocian cylinder-seal impressions. Among the pottery were Syrian imports. The same room also stored tools, loomweights, and some toys. In Festschrift OzgiiC, Dr. Veysel Donbaz publishes several contracts of the Karum Ib period and presents the sequence of Anatolian rulers of Kanish Ib as: Inar, Wariuma, Harpatiwa, Labaria (?), Pithana-Anitta, and Zuzu. In the same volume, 337-405, Prof. Nimet Ozgui publishes the sealed bullae from Kultepe, 23 of which come from the palace of Warshama, about 170 from Karum II houses or the mound; Prof. Kutlu</page><page sequence="8">130 MACHTELD J.

Dr. Peter Neve expanded his work on the South Citadel, reported on the 1988 in AA 1989, 271-337 and Symposium 11:1 (1989) 229-46. In 1989, he reports, the Hittite building level at the north end of the citadel revealed two large structures, the east- ern one resembling Temple 31 in plan. A small bronze figurine of a bull on a stand was found here. The two Hittite vaulted chambers were further in- vestigated. The inscribed chamber of Shuppiluliuma had a sunken area in front of the relief on the rear wall. The floor of the chamber sloped down to the relief, and the walls here consist of five courses of limestone blocks instead of four as at the outer end. The retaining walls east and west of the entrance form the borders of an open plaza. Soundings made behind and to the sides of the vaulted chamber confirmed that it contained no other compartments. The cham- ber was set in a Hittite embankment, preserved to 30 m in thicknessand 4 m in height under the Phry- gian fortification wall built partly of Hittite spolia. The Phrygian habitation on the South Citadel is preserved in three levels. The first consists of houses and workshops gradually replaced by larger establish- ments in level 2. At this time the Phrygian fortifica- tions were built around the South Citadel with 11 bastions, two of which flank the west gate and its inner chamber. In the third stage the fortifications were given up along the west side and single-room houses began to cover the site, protected along the east by what now became part of the Phrygian city wall. The plateau and slope east of the South Citadel were also explored. A Hittite fortification wall ran along the outer edge, connected with the wall coming from the King's Gate and changing direction to link up with the southeast bastion of Biyukkale. No struc- tures were found on the plateau, but in the center a stela-base, a pavement, and a basin came to light. In the Phrygian period (Buiyikkale II as well as I) one- room houses, hearths, and workshops with iron and slag remains were located here. In the upper city, restoration work was done on Temple V and its temenos wall. The hieroglyphic inscription in the chamber of Shuppiluliuma II is discussed by H. Otten in AA 1989, 333-37; the term designating the chamber, the equiv- alent of cuneiform D KASKAL.KUR may refer to an entrance to the underworld (J.D. Hawkins in AA 1989, 337). The results of the 1988 season are de- scribed and illustrated by Dr. Inci Bayburtluoglu in an interview with Neve in Miize 1 (1989) 56-61. See also Anatolica 16 (1989-1990) 20-29.

Looters had begun to attack this site. The excavation in 1988 was concerned with cist- and pithos-graves of EB date. The pithoi were oriented with their rims to the northwest; the</page><page sequence="10">132 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 95 Fig. 9. Kaman-Kalehyuiik.

Tomb gifts were pottery, bronze and silver toggle-pins, earrings, bracelets, a torque, spearheads, and two violin-shaped idols. There also was a bronze "standard" consisting of a stag figurine set in a ring, with lower attachment. This Fig. 10. Kaman-Kaleh6yuik. Miniature lead figurine. Fig. 11. Kaman-Kaleh6yiik. Hittite stamp seal (a and b). was found in the fill over a cist. The importance of this cemetery for comparative study of EB burial customs is evident. Ikiztepe. Prof. Onder Bilgi deepened the excava- tion of Ikiztepe Mound I. Two levels of the EB II period were brought to light. A spacious room con- tained a large oven protected by a screen wall on the west side. The inventory consisted of much pottery, some of it with relief decoration, terracotta animal figurines, loomweights, brush handles, combs, bone and horn tools, a stone macehead, whetstones, grind- ing stones, and casting molds for points or arrow- heads. The Hellenistic tomb chamber found in 1975- 1976 was partially restored. A report appeared in Symposium 11:1 (1989) 211-20. Acemh6yiik. The direction of the work at Acem- h6yiik was handed over in 1989 by Prof. Nimet 6zguiC to Dr. Aliye Ozten. She reports conservation work on the two palaces, and new discoveries along the north side of the Sarikaya palace. Here Hellenistic houses and pits had descended to and through the floor of the palace courtyard. There was also a building level of the Colony period immediately after the conflagra- tion of the palace, using spolia from the burned pal-</page><page sequence="11">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 133 ace. In spite of these intrusions, the north court could be traced over a distance of 15 m from the north facade of the palace. Fragments of column bases of two types were found here: round with a sunken center in a first row 2.30 m from the north wall, similar to bases along the other sides of the palace, and rectangular bases with vertical grooves, a type found only along the north side, at a distance of about 6.90- 7.00 m from the north wall. The architectural contin- uation of porches north of the palace will be investi- gated further. The entrance to the Sarikaya palace was on the north side. Aliye Ozten in Festschrift Ozgii( 407-18 discusses the painted "metallic ware" that is characteristic of EB II in the Konya Plain, Acemhdyuik, and the Taurus Mountains. In the same volume, 149-52, Paul Garelli analyzes the references in Kuiltepe texts concerning the nature of the trade conducted by Burughattum. Karaman-Eregli Area. Semih Guineri in Tiirk- ArkDerg 28 (1989) 97-144 reports on a survey of mounds with special attention to "metallic ware" and second-millennium pottery. Porsuk. Prof. O. Pelon further investigated the construction and plan of the bent-axis Hittite postern at the west side of this large mound. Near the elbow, several pithoi were found crushed on the floor under the debris of fallen burnt beams. A crucible with traces of silver and lead points to supplies from the Bolkar- dag area. Among the pottery was a Hittite horse head. Kaman-Kaleh6yiik. This mound, 100 km south- west of Ankara, 3 km east of Kaman, is being exca- vated in a series of 10 x 10 m trenches (fig. 6) by a team from the Middle Eastern Culture Center in Japan. The general stratigraphy, Prof. Masao Mori and Sachihiro Omura report, yields good information on several levels of Phrygian habitation overlying Hit- tite and pre-Hittite levels. The Phrygian houses are of stone and mudbrick with cellars. Part of a Phrygian fortification wall came to light. The Phrygian inven- tory includes various types of early and late fibulae (figs. 7 and 8), evidence for metalworking and casting of fibulae in a terracotta mold, arrowheads, painted and monochrome Phrygian pottery of various periods (fig. 9), and a small lead figurine 4.9 cm in height (fig. 10). Hittite levels are represented by bullae with stamp seal impressions, a stamp seal with tripod handle and hieroglyphic legend (fig. 1 la, b), and by a typical repertoire of red-polished and buff wheelmade pot- tery. A report appeared in Symposium 11:1 (1989) 335-53. The team is also conducting a mound survey in the area of Klrgehir and Yozgat, with special attention to regional variants of painted EB wares, Research Sym- posium 7 (1989) 295-310. Karah6yuik-Konya. Prof. Sedat Alp reports fur- ther work along the northeast side of the mound, where MB houses are relatively well preserved with architectural details such as doorways, wooden thresholds, and steps. One complex has at least 15 rooms. A number of ring-shaped, red-polished vessels and a rhyton in the shape of a horse were among the pottery. Loomweights with markings are characteris- tic of the site. For 1988 see Symposium 11:1 (1989) 275-81. Kftahya-Bilecik-Eskigehir. Dr. Turan Efe re- ports on a survey in this district, Research Symposium 7 (1989) 405-24. Materials ranged from Palaeolithic to Classical. Notable is the good evidence for second- millennium settlements on Kocahiuyfik near Domanim and on the large mound and terrace of Taveanh hui- yuik. For a summary see AnatSt 39 (1989) 178. Chron- ological problems for the West Anatolian MB Age are reviewed by Brigitte Kull in PZ 64 (1989) 48-73. Troy. In 1989, Prof. M. Korfmann reports, exca- vations in the deep Schliemann trench were expanded to the north of House 102, area C-D/2-3, where early and middle Troy I sublevels were examined. The west part of House 102 is being restudied with the under- lying walls of the apsidal House 103. In the main part of the long trench, D/4-5, the walls exposed by Schlie- mann have been repaired with demarcation of old and new masonry and the original floors have been covered with sand and gravel for their protection. A modern mudbrick retaining wall was built against the lower (Troy I) part of the east scarp to prevent further erosion. The east profile will be scrutinized for clues concerning the transition of late Troy I to early Troy II. In E/4-5, the pinnacle over the southeast wall of Megaron IIA was taken down through levels IV and III with a good yield of samples. The next season will allow the examination of the only extant remains of the mudbrick and beam construction of the porch wall of Megaron IIA; the southwest anta of the smaller parallel Megaron IIB should also emerge. For the study of Troy VI, a new trench was opened against the outer face of the fortification wall in D/9- 10, west of Theater C. Here deep fills with large quantities of Hellenistic pottery came to light. Dirp- feld had examined the south face of the VI wall in this area in a narrow trench. The new operation will be deeper and longer, including a sounding behind the wall in D/8, which was also started in 1989. In the lower city, the trenches in K/12-13 and I-K/ 17-18 were expanded. The wide paved Roman streets running roughly north-south and east-west continue to emerge, as predicted by the magnetometer survey, as do several terracotta water supply lines. The nature</page><page sequence="12">134 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 95 Fig. 12. Troy.

Stella Miller and Brian Rose of the University of Cincinnati team, who also began the clearing and recording of the largest of the three Trojan theaters, Theater A northeast of the citadel. The search for the lower city of Troy VI so far has consisted of probes to 2 m depth below the Roman level in K/12-13 and I-K/17-18; ceramic ma- terial of late VI or VIIa type has turned up. A sample is the LH IIIB skyphos fragment that was found with local gray ware imitations (fig. 12). A report on the 1988 season appeared in Symposium 11:1 (1989) 283-304. Further reports will be pub- lished in Studia Troica, a new series to contain studies related to the archaeology and historical tradition of Troy. Korfmann has published a new edition of Schlie- mann's Bericht iiber die Ausgrabungen in Troja in den Jahren 1871 bis 1873 (Zurich 1990) with a selection of the most important plates of Schliemann's Atlas. Begiktepe. In Miize 2-3 (1989-1990) 67-79 and Festschrift Ozgii? 271-78, Korfmann discusses the ex- cavations of Begiktepe in the context of Trojan and West Anatolian prehistory. A report on the 1987- 1988 excavations appeared in AA 1989, 473-81. Troad. Dr. Mehmet Ozdogan in Research Sympos- ium 7 (1989) 443-57 reports on his 1988 survey in Thrace and Marmara, specifically in hitherto unex- plored zones near Can, Yenice, Biga, and Bayrami. Although Upper Palaeolithic and Neolithic materials were collected, Chalcolithic and EB occupation was difficult to establish in the plain of Can. One site near Kurmak6y has a sequence from Kumtepe Ib to Troy V and thus promises evidence for the elusive Troy II and III-IV periods. Many sites and tumuli are suf- fering from the side effects of modern engineering and agricultural developments. Arslantepe-Malatya. The excavation season of 1989 was the last in which Alba Palmieri participated. Her work has made a great difference in the inter- pretation of prehistory in the border zone of Meso- potamian and Transcaucasian expansion. Dr. Marcella Frangipane reports on the 1989 campaign in which the EB III levels were further investigated. The latest EB III strata are characterized by rectan- gular buildings with stone foundations and a drainage channel built of large stones. A slightly earlier level had mudbrick houses with clay benches, some with central hearths; one room yielded a workshop inven- tory, clay human figurines, a cart model, and pottery including EB III painted ware and a ribbed Syrian bottle. An intermediate level has the now familiar circular structures with a diameter of ca. 2.50 m, at the beginning of EB IIIb. One single level belongs to EB IIIa, damaged by the circular structures. For level VIA (EB Ia) at the end of the fourth millennium B.C. restoration work continued on the wall painting discovered previously in the central room of the storage complex. A counterpart painting with a similar representation was discovered on the other side of the niche, again painted in red and black on a greenish plaster. A figure with triangular face and wavy hair is represented under a canopy of branches both straight and curved. The figure may be seated on a bench. A new trench north of the main excavated area revealed Late Chalcolithic levels fairly high near the surface with mudbrick structures and a jar burial of a child. Clay sealings were found in a rectangular room with 1 m thick walls. One of the stamp seal impressions is of a quadruple spiral design resembling the silver belt (?) clasp found earlier. Conical bowls, some coarse, some with string-cut base, are associated with this level. A report on 1988 is found in Symposium 11:1 (1989) 191-201. In Festschrift Ozgik 419-30 is a study by Alba Palmieri of the storage and distribution system attested at Arslantepe in the Late Uruk period, a frontier site unlike the colonies of Habuba Kabira or Hassek type.</page><page sequence="13">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 135 Oylum Huiyiik. Dr. Engin Ozgen reports that trenches on the surface of the mound are exposing Hellenistic building remains. A hoard of 134 silver tetradrachms of early Hellenistic date was found in a jar embedded in the upper level. On the east slope, stratigraphic explorations were undertaken by Prof. Elizabeth Carter. The upper lev- els are of the advanced EB period and were cut by tombs of EB IV-MB I date. Previously, some chamber tombs had been plundered by villagers. The new trenches yielded pithos burials containing simple in- humations, and infant burials in cooking pots. Tomb gifts included pottery (pedestaled bowls, bottles, gob- lets, tripodic jars, and simple bowls), bronze rings, toggle-pins, bracelets, and torques. One special pithos burial had a gold' frontlet with rosette-like ornament, a silver pin and bead, and a set of five very small cylinder seals of ivory or shell in a local version of Early Dynastic style. For 1988, see Symposium 11:1 (1989) 203-10 and Anatolica 16 (1989-1990) 20-29. Girnavaz. At this mound in the Nusaybin area Prof. Hayat Erkanal had approached third-millen- nium levels on the north terrace and tombs of the Early Dynastic II period had come to light, as reported in Symposium 11:1 (1989) 261-73. In 1989, a fortifi- cation wall of the early second millennium was dis- covered along the west side of the north terrace. The work in the Early Dynastic II cemetery continued with the excavation of 32 additional tombs. These are bur- ials in jars and mudbrick cists with tomb gifts of ample pottery including Ninevite 5 and metallic wares, as well as bronze vessels, weapons (one Sumerian axe), and pins with curved ends, lapis, shell, and carnelian beads, and stamp- and cylinder seals made of lime- stone. One cylinder seal carries a remarkable scene of a four-wheeled chariot in which a seated figure is being conveyed. Harran. Dr. Nurettin Yardimci continued the sys- tematic excavation of the habitation area on the mound. In the course of the 1989 season reused stamped bricks from the Sin temple came to light, the inscription of which was studied by Dr. Veysel Donbaz, who kindly provides the following translation: "Na- bonidus, the king of Babylon . . . the Temple of Ehulhul, inside Harran, for the gods Sin, Ningal, Nusku and Sadarnunna my lords, I (indeed) rebuilt." Van-Dilkaya. The early Transcaucasian pottery from Dilkaya is discussed by Gilriz Kozbe in Research Symposium 7 (1989) 533-54; for the site see Symposium 11:1 (1989) 247-54. Bayburt-Kelkit. A. Sagona in 1988 started a survey project in the region of Bayburt and Kelkit southeast and south of Giimiighane. Chalcolithic, EB, and Iron Age sites were investigated in the expansion of the original survey by Killu K6kten, Research Symposium 7 (1989) 425-33. EUPHRATES AREA, SALVAGE EXCAVATIONS Samsat. Prof. Nimet Ozgiiu conducted a final sea- son at this great historical and prehistoric mound in the fall of 1989. She kindly reports the following details. In the east trench, deep soundings continued into levels 25-27 of the Late Uruk period. In level 27, 10 child burials were excavated. The children were buried intramurally below house floors, in wide jars covered with bowls as lids. One burial was a plain inhumation. Beads and small vessels served as tomb gifts. The pottery repertoire of the Late Uruk phase is well represented. In level 29, painted pottery of earlier Chalcolithic type came to light, transitional to the Halaf period. In the southwest area f-g/15-16 an altar of the early Hellenistic period was found to have been con- structed of reused and partly trimmed blocks belong- ing to the kingdom of Kummuh, carrying parts of lines in Luwian hieroglyphs. These blocks seemed to have belonged to the city gate of Kummuh. Fragments of reliefs of this period, both in limestone and in basalt, had previously come to light, with details of faces, hair, beard, and hieroglyphs. One hieroglyphic bulla was found. Glazed bricks with circle decoration, found in some quantity, may have belonged to walls of the Kummuh gate complex. The most spectacular monument of the Kummuh period is a postern, a staircase-tunnel con- structed in limestone on the northeast side of the mound (q-s/14-15). Its vertical walls are built of ma- sonry with clay mortar, but the roofing is made of Cyclopean blocks in Hittite fashion. The tunnel gives access from the Kummuh fortification system down to the slope of the mound to the level of a spring. A total of 63 steps were cleared. Near the lower end is a cistern with steps leading down. The construction system of this tunnel has strong affinities to the pos- tern and stairs of Yerkapi in Bogazkoy. The palace of Mithridates was further explored to the east and north. It continued on the east side under the previously excavated small Byzantine baths. Un- der the Roman building in opus reticulatum, also ex- posed previously, the palace continued to the north, where a corridor, rooms, and frescoed walls were added to the record. The history of Kummuh has by now architecturally come to light in the remains of fortifications, water supply system, orthostats, and inscriptions at Samsat.</page><page sequence="14">136 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 95 For the dynasty of Kummuh see J.D. Hawkins in RLA VI (1983) 338-40 and AnatSt 39 (1989) 107-12 (with M. Kalaq) on the inscription of Malplnar near Adiyaman. Tille. In 1989, Dr. David French and Geoffrey Summers report, the burnt level that was previously interpreted as LB was investigated. The removal of various Iron Age structures is reported in Symposium 11:1 (1989) 305-16. The major burnt level has a gateway on the west side through which a street rises to the east. Two pairs of buttresses articulate the roofed gateway; burnt chambers stand to the north and south of the gate. Burnt oak roof timbers will be examined for dendrochronological clues. Cerami- cally, the burnt level, which has some painted pottery, is considered to belong to the Iron Age, perhaps to the 12th or Ilth century B.C. After the fire, new structures were built on the ruins and a gradual de- velopment is noticeable. A preview of LB was a small bronze foundation peg with the upper part in human shape, stylized arms outstretched, and head with earrings. Ikiztepe. Prof. Ufuk Esin undertook a rescue cam- paign at this double mound south of the Euphrates near Kulugagi k6yi and in the Karakaya dam flood zone. When the water level receded in 1989 Palaeo- lithic remains and an extensive Ubaid settlement were noted. Soundings exposed two Ubaid levels with painted and monochrome (Coba bowls) wares and a lower, earlier level. The Ubaid artifacts resemble those of Degirmentepe. Iavi Tarlasi. The Halaf site excavated 4.5 km east of Hassek h6ytik in 1983-1984 is published in some detail by A. von Wickede and S. Herbordt in IstMitt 38 (1988) 5-35. There are three levels of tholoi and annexes belonging to the Middle Halaf period. Bur- ials were found in the upper level, mostly of children but two double burials had an adult and child each. The animal bones from Qavi Tarlasi are discussed by J. Schiffer and J. Boessneck in IstMitt 38 (1988) 37- 62. Qavi Tarlasi is a good example of the evidence for Halaf expansion along the Euphrates that has accu- mulated through the recent rescue excavations. Sempiyetepe. Prof. Muhibbe Darga reports in some detail on the cist-grave cemetery she excavated in 1988 at Suyatagi-MarmaraS, 8 km north of now submerged Semaiyetepe along the east bank of the Euphrates, Festschrift Ozgiig 67-73. The cists had floors of potsherds and were irregular in orientation. Similar cist-graves were observed in large numbers (80) near Kalekty, south of Suyatagi. The date of these cemeteries seems to be EB I, but they are now lost under the rising waters of the Karakaya dam. EUPHRATES AND TIGRIS AREA SURVEY Dr. Guillermo Algaze and his colleagues spent a third season on reconnaissance in the areas to be flooded by five new dams: two in the Euphrates, two in the Tigris, and one in the Batman River. He pub- lished reports on the 1988 season inJNES 48 (1989) 241-81 and Research Symposium 7 (1989) 391-403. Dr. Algaze reports: "In 1989, a geomorphologist worked with the archaeologists. A total of 130 sites were recorded west of the Batman River and in the Tigris basin up to Bismil. Apart from Palaeolithic open air sites and flint scatter, the earliest was Demirci Tepe, an Aceramic Neolithic site on the banks of the Batman River across from the town of Batman. At least 7 m of occupational debris can be seen in a section 330 m long, with plastered pebbled floors. Only 8% of the tools were of obsidian. Two Late Neolithic sites, several Halaf and Ubaid sites, and numerous Late Chalcolithic (Amuq F) sites were noted. EB materials (metallic wares) and some Karaz wares were seen at a small number of Tigris sites, but EB I wares (Ninevite 5 and diagonally patterned re- served slip wares) were absent; EB is poorly repre- sented in general. MB seemed to be absent, LB difficult to recognize. Iron Age of Keban type was common, and a neo-Assyrian site seems to exist at Ziyaret Tepe on the south bank of the Tigris. Hellen- istic and Roman are strongly represented along the edge of the plateau near the Batman River and along the Tigris, and a bridge crossed the Tigris near the Batman confluence. "In the Cizre-Silopi plain more than 40 small sites were identified in addition to 18 large mounds re- corded in 1988. The MB Age was the most important period of settlement. There is also substantial evi- dence for Late Assyrian presence. "In the Euphrates basin from Halfeti to Carchemish more than 100 sites were discovered. Palaeolithic re- mains are abundant. Teleilat and Akarpay are sub- stantial Aceramic and Late Neolithic sites east of the Euphrates. Ten Late Uruk sites with beveled rim bowls were found south of Birecik, some small. Four Uruk 'colony' sites closer to Carchemish are more substantial. The largest is Tiladir Tepe, 600 x 200 m on the ridge overlooking the east bank of the river some 3.5 km north of Carchemish. Sadi Tepe on the opposite bank has two satellites, and is notable for the presence of clay mosaic cones. North of Birecik, Ha- cnebi Tepe was a native site with an Amuq F reper- toire and a few Uruk types; a heavy mudbrick fortification wall appears in the scarp. EB wares are of Amuq G-H-I types. The EB III-MB era is a flourishing period marked by local characteristics. Ti-</page><page sequence="15">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 137 ladir Tepe was entirely occupied at that time. The later MB and LB sequence is less clear. "By far the most sites along the Euphrates date to the Classical era. Zeugma (70 ha) and Apamea (35 ha) span both banks of the river, situated barely 500 m upstream of the site where the Birecik dam will be erected. Observations were made to supplement the work done here by J. Wagner. Stamped tiles record the legio IV Scythica. "In 1990, the survey is continuing with the Garzan and Bitlis river basins and the Tigris itself between the Bohtan confluence and the Ilisu Dam site." METALLURGY Taurus Mountains. Dr. Aslihan Yener discussed her work in the Nigde-Camardi area in Archaeometry Symposium 5 (1989) 1-12 and 13-31 (tools and slag discussed by Ergun Kaptan). The Bolkardag area is the subject of an extensive report in NGR 5 (1989) 477-94. Fieldwork by archaeologists and metallurgists has started at Camardi sites in 1990. Acemhoyiik. Analyses of copper ingots found at Acemh6yiik are published by Dr. Alaaddin Qukur and Prof. Seref Kun? in Archaeometry Symposium 5 (1989) 33-39. Tepecik and Tiilintepe. Qukur and Kun? also present analyses of metal artifacts from Tepecik and Tulintepe in the Keban area, AnatSt (1989) 113-20. The samples ranged from Chalcolithic through the Bronze Age, including a large number of Hittite pe- riod items from Tepecik. Malatya-Arslantepe. C. Caneva, Alba Palmieri, and Kemal Sertok published a progress report on their studies of copper ores in the Malatya region, and on smelting experiments, Archaeometry Sympos- ium 5 (1989) 53-65. Weapons. Sixty weapons from the former Kocaba? collection are now published in an exemplary cata- logue of the Sadberk Hanim Museum by Cetin An- lagan and Onder Bilgi, Weapons of the Prehistoric Age (Istanbul 1989). There are spearheads, daggers, flat axes, lugged axes, shaft-hole axes including double axes, adzes, and arrowheads, and a two-piece mold for a double axe. All these objects are described and illustrated in photographs and drawings and 50 spec- imens are analyzed for trace elements by absorption spectroscopy. The KocabaS collection, now on display in the Sad- berk Hanlm Museum, had no recorded provenance for these weapons, although KocabaS knew of some alleged findspots that the dealers of his more innocent era reported. Several pieces are evidently West Ana- tolian and presumably come from EB cemeteries. The socketed spearhead no. 6 has a hieroglyphic Luwian inscription giving its owner's name as Walwaziti, Great Scribe, who may be the official who played a historical role in the days of Puduhepa, as Ali Dincol explains in an appendix and in Festschrift Ozgiiy 29-31. DENDROCHRONOLOGY Prof. P.I. Kuniholm reports on progress in Archaeo- metry Symposium 5 (1989) 87-96 and in Festschrift Ozgiik 279-93. Important analyses are those of Hittite timbers from the postern at Porsuk (overlapping with those from Acemh6yuk and Kiiltepe) and a juniper from the Sakarya River near Gordion, overlapping with those from the Midas tumulus. MINOAN AND MYCENAEAN SITES AND FINDS Ka?-Uluburun. The shipwreck with its heavy cargo of copper and tin ingots and diversified other mate- rials and artifacts is being systematically mapped and excavated. Cemal Pulak reports that along the west side, 18 oxhide ingots were brought up after consol- idation under water, and some 100 ingots still await skillful removal. Among the artifacts recovered in 1989 are three more stone anchors (bringing the total to 23), 266 lead fishnet weights in a group, beads of faience, agate, rock crystal, glass, and quartz, two cylinder seals, bronze tools and weapons, hematite balance pan weights, one tiny weight in the shape of a fly, a lid fragment of an ivory pyxis, and more Cypriot and Mycenaean pottery. Wooden elements of the ship's hull are left under sand cover for further study. Cross sections are being drawn of the site and its row of ingots, giving clues to the curvature of the hull. Reports appeared in Symposium 11:1 (1989) 317- 33 and INA Newsletter 16:4 (1989) 4-10; also in Miize 1 (1989) 68-76. Cape Gelidonya. George F. Bass in INA Newsletter 16:4 (1989) 12-13 reports that "the Bronze Age ship ripped her bottom open on the rock pinnacle south- east of the wreck, spilling small jars, a bronze spit, and other bronze items before it drifted down- ward. . . . A line of additional finds stretches to the southeast: fragments of copper ingots, unique bronze implements, and the largest balance-pan weight ever to come from the site." Investigations will continue in 1990. Panaztepe. Prof. Armagan Erkanal reports on this Aeolic site with its Mycenaean connections in Sympos- ium 11:1 (1989) 255-60 and AnatSt 39 (1989) 179- 80. On the citadel, the north fortification wall of the second millennium B.C. is partly exposed. A small megaron and other building remains can be assigned to the same period. A major campaign is planned for 1990.</page><page sequence="16">138 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 95 Fig. 13. Gordion. Burnt Early Phrygian pit-house, detail. Gavurtepe-Alagehir (Philadelphia). In 1989, Prof. Recep Meriu investigated the area of the mega- ron on the mound of Gavurtepe in a long trench, which revealed a stratum of Late Antique tombs, a soft fill, and a thick conflagration level. The floor of the megaron along the west wall was found to be made of schist paving on a rubble bedding. On the floor lay a Mycenaean handle fragment and a bowl of Beycesultan IVb type. The megaron may have been built in the 15th century B.C.; it was burned down late in the second millennium. For 1988, see Sympos- ium 11:1 (1989) 179-90.

The mound of Van kalesi, ca. 70 m to the north of the citadel, is the largest prehistoric mound in the area. A trench made by earlier excavators was widened and taken down to the Urartian level, where a building of four units was exposed. The base of the mound is of the EB Age. A general introduction to Van is a monograph by Prof. Oktay Belli, Van. The Capital of Urartu (Net 1989). Prof. Veli Sevin has traced stretches of the Urartian highway between the cities of Elazig and Mug over a distance of some 100 km.

Kaman-KalehiyUk. See above (Bronze Age Sites) for the Phrygian levels of this mound across the Halys along the modern road to Kirsehir and Kayseri. Gordion. The 1989 season yielded excellent new evidence for the levels postdating the Hittite Empire. In the expanded soundings in the open area between Phrygian megara 2 and 10 (AJA 94 [1990] 132, figs. 6-7), a Hittite basement yielded wheelmade buff and orange pottery of 13th-century type. Prof. M. Voigt reports: "The abandonment of this building presum- ably coincided with the end of the Hittite Empire. New buildings were soon under construction. The earliest was a small house set in a shallow rectangular pit edged with stones and bricks. The floor and wall faces were coated with mud plaster. Interior fittings included a small domed oven, two stone and plaster bins, and small storage pits in the floor. A second and larger 'pit-house' was more substantially built, with stone slabs lining the inner faces of some walls. The pottery found on the floors as well as in outside trash deposits and pits, was handmade, lightly fired, usually burnished, and sometimes decorated with impres- sions or incisions: bowls and bag-shaped jars. This early Iron Age handmade ware has generic parallels in Thrace and the Balkans. "A very different ceramic assemblage was found on the floor of another pit-house that had been burned (fig. 13). It had a narrow ledge around the inner edge. Large posts in the corners of the pit and small posts set into the ledge formed the framework for a light- weight superstructure of reeds and mud plaster. In- terior fittings of plastered clay included a two- chambered oven, an adjacent potstand with depres- sions for three vessels, and a large rectangular feature with two narrow bins, decorated with narrow pilasters. On the floor lay a clay spindle whorl, a stone weight or mace, charred wooden planks, iron nails, grain, an impression of a wicker basket, and grinding stones. The wheelmade pottery vessels from this structure (fig. 14) are within the tradition that characterizes the destruction level of 700 B.C., i.e., Phrygian ware. This pit-house therefore seems to represent an early stage of Phrygian occupation at Gordion, before the initia- tion of the formal building program. All aspects of material culture will be examined for evidence of continuity or change, particularly food preferences and butchering practices. "The anteroom of Terrace Building unit 2, de- stroyed ca. 700 B.C., was found to contain numerous pottery vessels and objects associated with textile pro- duction. Several pots contained seeds: barley, lentils, and sesame. The walls of the burnt building were leveled soon after the conflagration in preparation for the Middle Phrygian rebuilding of the site. "Architectural remains of the latter period include a subterranean room reached by a slab stairway lead- ing from Building I (fig. 15), one of the Middle Phry- gian megara excavated by Rodney Young. "Stratigraphic cuts were made in the 1950 trial trench along the southwest edge of the mound. Pot- tery from the lowest Middle Phrygian level (fig. 16) was very similar to that lying on the floor of the Building I cellar. At the base of the sounding was a deep layer of clay. This evidence suggests that the Middle Phrygian clay foundation extends over at least part of the southwest sector of the mound. "With the final abandonment of the Middle Phry- gian buildings, the entire area cleared in the upper trenches was used for industrial purposes. Cellars and adjacent trash deposits contained evidence of stone working (alabaster vessels, flint bowls, tesserae), and working of bone, ivory, and metal. Imports, including fine Attic pottery, suggest that Gordion was a pros- perous town at this period early in the fifth century B.C. A remarkable reference to the Persian rulers is a painted sherd with the head of a Persian in char- acteristic pose (fig. 17). Residential areas of the Middle</page><page sequence="19">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 141 and Late Phrygian periods may have lain primarily in a lower town located across the Sakarya River, discov- ered in 1987 through surface survey." Prof. G.K. Sams reports that his investigation of the monumental Phrygian Gate Building revealed that the flanking walls are bedded on earlier Phrygian walls with courses of stone and timber. In 1989, low altitude balloon photographs were made of Gordion by J. Wilson Myers and Eleanor Myers. Reports appeared in Symposium 11:2 (1989) 77-105 and Miize 2-3 (1989-1990) 80-86.

A tumulus across the Sak- arya River in Beylikkoprii territory was attacked by looters August 1988. A rescue excavation by Melih Aslan, reported in Miize 1 (1989) 62-66, revealed a collapsed wooden tomb chamber with one skeleton, wooden furniture, bronze belts, fragments of a bronze bowl, and 80 fibulae. An ancient robber's skeleton was found in the disturbed fill over the tomb. ~~~:iis?iziiiii~ i-:::-:-~~?-~-~~_:r:;I::-i-l:- i--iiiii--?iliiiii:i: :-- I;_:i:iiiiiii?i;:-i?:::--:?:::-::-::-:i- ""''-''-:-'?"-:"?'-`'"~-~-: --:::::- :-:ii:ii:i:i--:-i:ii-iii i. i:?i--~ iiii:i .:-. ii iii iiiii ii:i :. ii ii ii ?::::: -i i i~iiii ijiijiijii-i:_i: i- ::::? : :: : -~,__:-----:;-:-:-_:i - : :: i i iii?-~' L~~P*iiiii~ii -: iiiiiiii:i:iiji:i jii-i:i ----;-:::s:--;,,?-r -:--::::-;-:::::i: :iiiiiiii~ili3i-i-ji~ii: -::::_::---- .:..:z - :: -- ::_ - :- ?: -:: :: : -_i: :-i-:ii- -i :::i - - :: :: :: : :::: :' : ::-::: ::::; -I?.,? ~ : --; _~ -i-:I-'---------': : :-: .:ildi:ai~Pi-i-- ~~~:~i:~; _~:~_~~-_- ::::;:i::: Fig. 18.

S. Mitchell and M. Waelkens expanded their survey, begun in 1986, to the Corin- thian temple of Antoninus Pius with its colonnaded courtyard, the main north-south street leading from the temple to the lower agora, built in three sections connected by staircases, and the Roman Baths east of the lower agora. Three aqueducts were mapped, two of them rock-cut in the cliffs, the third built of boul- ders. Waelkens and Selguk Baser made a sounding in the potter's quarter east of the theater. A 7 x 7 m trench in the dump yielded over 3000 kg of pottery from the first until the fifth century A.C., with ample evidence for potters' wheels, molds, and misfired pieces. Reports on the 1988 season appeared in AnatSt 39 (1989) 63-77, where work at Ariassos is also in- cluded, and in Research Symposium 7 (1989) 119-52. LYCIA Xanthos-Letoon. Prof. C. Leroy reports on work in the southwestern area of the sanctuary: "The te- menos wall was cleared north and south of the main entrance, which revealed three inscriptions on the outer face. Soundings in the portico went through layers of the seventh century A.C. to the sixth century B.C. with Ionian banded hydriae and Attic squat lek- ythoi of the late fifth century B.C. (fig. 18). Thus the extent of the Archaic sanctuary matched that of its Hellenistic counterpart. "The study of the theater was resumed. A plan and elevation of the cavea and Roman stage building were drawn; soundings revealed the contours of the Hel- lenistic orchestra and the Hellenistic parodos. The two stages of the Roman theater, pre- and post-glad- iatorial combats, were analyzed. "The mosaic in Temple B (Apollo) was lifted. The bedding on a lime mortar and underpinning of stone flakes overlay a fill on bedrock (fig. 19), which did not contain helpful dating evidence. "Views from the French satellite SPOT allow the study of the changes in the course of the Xanthos River, its submerged delta, and the sanding up of the port of Patara."

"The naos of the Ptolemaion with its imbricated roof had an akroterion in the form of a Corinthian capital with three rows of akanthoi and two snakes coiling up amidst the foliage. A marble torso of a saddled horse (fig. 20) belongs to the sculpture of the temenos. In the east part of the Ptolemaion the ex- cavation came upon a church, the apse of which was probably built over the Hellenistic temenos. The By- zantine sculptural decoration, to judge by a parapet slab with scenes of paradise (fig. 21), is of high qual- ity." For 1988 see Symposium 11:2 (1989) 185-210. Arycanda. Prof. Cevdet Bayburtluoglu worked in the tomb areas to the east and northwest, in the bath- gymnasium complex, and in the commercial agora, where sculpture fragments of Roman and Byzantine date came to light as well as a fragment of a bronze portrait (Gallienus?). CARIA lasos. Prof. Fede Berti reports on a group of tombs of the first century B.C. in Symposium 11:2 (1989) 224-43. In 1989 the sanctuary that yielded votive double axes was further examined, and its north bor- der was defined. Four rectangular bases stood in a construction with heavy walls. Double axes were found as well as kantharoi. Labraunda. Prof. Pontus Hellstr6m conducted ex- cavation and study in 1988 and 1989. In the northeast part of the sanctuary, north of the propylaea, a build- ing with a south facade was explored to the east. Here five square rooms seem to have been built for ritual dining, with off-center doorways to the west. Discussions of Labraunda architecture as well as Maussolleion problems can be found in T.

Underlying levels of the sixth century B.C. will be investigated next. Knidos. In 1988, Prof. Ramazan Ozgan started work at this site, which had remained unattended archaeologically after the interruption of the cam- paigns by Prof. Iris Love (AJA 77 [1973] 413-24). First on the new program is the preparation of a new survey plan of the entire site. Small soundings were made near the circular monopteros identified by Love as the Temple of Aphrodite Euploia. To the north- east, Byzantine structures came to light. A report appeared in Symposium 11:2 (1989) 167-75. R. Ozgan published an Archaic seated statue from Knidos in Festschriftfiir Nikolaus Himmelmann (Mainz 1989) 47- 51. Nysa. The theater at Nysa is being excavated by Director Vural Sezer of the Aydln Museum; he re- ports in TiirkArkDerg 23 (1989) 307-22. The scene building is decorated with well-preserved friezes of the Dionysos cycle. Aphrodisias. Prof. Kenan Erim reports on the 1989 season: "Tetrapylon. The major focus of the campaign was the Tetrapylon restoration project. All of the western half of the structure is now fully restored. The archi- trave and frieze blocks of the western facade were restored and consolidated in their original position, as was the central semicircular lunette panel with its relief decorations of Erotes, animals, and Nikai amidst acanthus scrolls of the broken tympanum, topped by geison and sima elements, including the coffered ceil- ings between its two rows of columns. Four architrave and frieze blocks of the eastern half were also replaced over their fully restored columns. "Theater. Restoration of the stage building is in progress. A large number of frieze and architrave blocks of the three orders above the proskenion-lo- geion were rejoined and consolidated. All fragments were organized for study in the open space of the fourth-century tetrastoon behind the stage building.</page><page sequence="22">144 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 95 "Agora Complex. The focal point of investigations in the Portico of Tiberius was the pool stretching along the length of its north and south colonnades. Excavations were continued at both western and east- ern semicircular extremities. The west one yielded much statuary, including a seated full portrait statue of a high official of the late fifth or early sixth century. The almost intact head of an older bearded man probably belongs to a torso of an old fisherman found in 1904 by Paul Gaudin in the nearby Baths of Had- rian. The head is now in Berlin. At the east end of the pool were discovered a female portrait and an- other under-life-size head of a running horse, a com- panion to the one recorded here last year. The most remarkable find was a large carved wooden panel with a well-preserved band of meander pattern. It was transferred to the Bodrum Museum for conservation. The arrangement of seats along the outer edge of the pool and the north and west stylobates of the colon- nades of the portico suggests the presence of specta- tors. Consequently, the function of the Portico of Tiberius was that of a gymnasium and/or a palaestra for the Hadrianic Baths, which lacked such a feature. "An important step in the history of the site finally became a reality: the expropriation of the whole of Aphrodisias within the circuit of the late Roman- Byzantine fortification system was completed. Illicit excavations in the southeast necropolis led to an in- vestigation that revealed part of a hypogaeum and four sarcophagi. At least two of these were only par- tially carved. We have suggested to the Turkish au- thorities the need for continued expropriation of at least part of Aphrodisias's extensive necropolis within a minimum radius of 500 m beyond the circuit of the city walls." A report on the 1986-1988 campaigns appeared in Charlotte Rouech6 and Kenan T. Erim eds., Aphrodi- sias Papers. Recent Work on Architecture and Sculpture (JRA Suppl. 1, Ann Arbor 1990) 9-36. IONIA Miletus. Profs. W. Mfiller-Wiener and V. von Graeve report excavations on Kalabaktepe in contin- uation of the work of 1986-1988, IstMitt 37 (1987) 5-79. In 1989 work in the adjoining east sector re- vealed building activities through the entire Archaic period. The south slope was densely settled. The first fortification wall cut off some of the houses built in the first half of the seventh century B.C. (fig. 22); later house walls run parallel to the inner face of the circuit (fig. 23). Much pottery of remarkable quality, including a high percentage of Milesian ware, came to light: wild goat style, an oinochoe with a horse- protome on the shoulder, sixth-century Fikellura ware, an amphora with a bird frieze on the shoulder. In the olive grove on the west slope of Kalabaktepe a one-room structure with a bench, partly cut into bed- rock, dates to the seventh century. It was filled with Perserschutt, and may have been a shrine, to judge by slate revetment slabs and carefully worked slabs of serpentinite that may have belonged to a cult statue base. 1' t J7 ASCHENGRU8E ji oo 4*'-, UOE~UE ,i !;* "- ,c,u .... @_ Fig. 22.

Here Trajanic, Hellenistic, and Archaic levels came to light. "In Archaic times votives were set up in this area, as attested by two completely preserved Ionic capitals (width 1.28 m) with fluted echinus, a column frag- ment, and half of a round base with dowel hole, all supports of votive offerings. Metal finds, otherwise rare at Didyma, were a cast griffin protome and two omphalos bowls with charred animal bones. "The Trajanic paving of the sacred road was cleared over an additional 35 m between the Artemis sanc- tuary and the Apollo precinct; on both sides are sty- lobates for porticoes. This brings the exposed length of the road to over 200 m. "The study of the Archaic tiled roof from the east building in the temenos along the road to Miletus (AA 1989, 147-80) was completed by P. Schneider." Reports appeared in Symposium 11:2 (1989) 43-52 and AA 1989, 143-217. Herakleia under Latmos. Dr. Anneliese Peschlow resumed her work in 1988 with the investigation of the necropolis: "We registered ca. 2500 tombs, all anciently looted. They consist of simple rock-cut com- partments with gneiss coverslabs or gabled lids (figs. 25 and 26). Decoration is rare. Cuttings for stelai occur on or near the monuments. Cremations com- prise only 4% of the total, to judge by round cuttings. Tombs are cut in prominent rocks, which often are shaped with platforms, stairs, and drainage channels. There are two chamber tombs built of ashlar masonry, two simple rock-cut chambers, and krepis remnants of two small tumuli. The tombs cannot be dated by shape alone. The cemeteries of the new city and the old (Latmos) overlap." For a report see Research Sym- posium 7 (1989) 153-69. Magnesia on the Maeander. Prof. Orhan Bing6l in 1988 and 1989 worked in the theater and started a survey of the tumuli in the area.

In the harbor area, soundings continue; structures near the harbor are being studied. In the Artemision, a Geometric temple foundation of 13.50 x 8.40 m was found in the center of the temple; 8 x 4 columns are attested by bluish slate bases. For comments on the basic continuity of the location of Ephesus see Omer Ozyigit, IstMitt 38 (1988) 83- 96. Klaros. Prof. Juliette de la Geniere in her second campaign at the sanctuary reports clearance of the site and individual structures, e.g., the Propylon. Soundings continued between the temple and altar of Apollo. Here 18 blocks with iron rings stood in two rows to the west and south of the altar; these served to tie the animals destined for sacrifice. An earlier foundation may belong to an older altar. Sherds go back to the Protogeometric period. Near the Artemis temple, deep soundings also yielded early pottery and terracottas of the late fifth to early fourth century B.C. The Apollo temple is being studied for selective restoration. It was revealed that bronze astragals were used as decorative oracular symbols at the junction of krepis blocks. Reports are found in Symposium 11:2 (1989) 324-40 and TiirkArkDerg 23 (1989) 293-306. Metropolis-Torball. Prof. Recep Merit and the Ephesus Museum in 1989 started excavation at this site 22 km north of Ephesus, which he previously discussed in his monograph Metropolis in lonien (K6n- igstein 1982); see also Inschriften von Ephesos 7:1 (Bonn 1981) 236-94. The entrance gate dates to the third century B.C. and was used into the Byzantine period. A long stoa under the Byzantine fortification wall is also under investigation. The Uyuz Dere cave, the site of an ancient cult, was partly excavated. A rough rock-cut altar stood in the center. Hellenistic terracottas rep- resent a mother goddess, Meter Gallesia. The general range of finds (lamps, pottery, glass vessels, knuckle- bones, and coins) dates from the sixth to the second century B.C. A handsome pamphlet illustrating the first year's results was published by the municipality of Torbah, which sponsors the enterprise: Torbalz Metropolis Kazzsz '89. Klazomenai. Prof. Giuven Baklr is annually accu- mulating evidence for the settlement and burial his- tory and topography of the mainland and the island. Trenches dug in 1989 again yielded evidence for sixth-century houses abandoned in 499 B.C. when the residents moved to the island. An apsidal house stood next to a rectangular one, used in three periods. The abandonment lasts until the fourth century, when habitation resumes. Below the sixth-century stratum, burnt levels are attested for ca. 650 and 700 B.C., destructions possibly caused by Kimmerian raids. The seventh- and sixth-century houses yield local and im- ported painted pottery of Ionian type. In a context of 650-600 dated by skyphoi, a hoard of 10 electrum staters was found in a small banded jug. These are of much importance for the question of the beginning of coinage and the date of the Ephesian Artemision deposit. The types are partly familiar (bull and lion protomes), partly new to the record (slender, bearded men confronted). The history of more than Klazo- menai itself will be illuminated by the study of this hoard. LYDIA Sardis. Prof. Crawford H. Greenewalt, jr., reports that in 1989 work continued auspiciously on the great Lydian fortification wall (MMS). "Limited excavation in the artificial hill immediately south of MMS showed that the mudbrick wall can be traced to the south for 80 m and probably an additional 60-70 m. The recess in the west side of MMS was mostly cleared. On its cobble floor were iron nails and slight wood remains in patterns suggesting shutters or doors. The skeleton found in the debris here in 1988 was that of a man 22-26 years old, a soldier to whom the iron helmet found nearby may have belonged, killed during the siege of Sardis by Cyrus. "On the acropolis spur, sector ByzFort, excavation exposed the beautifully cut and trimmed marble foundations of a colonnade belonging to a small, pa- vilion-like building, on the outer end of the spur summit. From earlier deposits much painted pottery of the seventh century B.C. was recovered, notably stemmed dishes (some 100) and storage jars. "In the late Roman district more of a colonnaded street, several spaces belonging to three building com- plexes, and parts of a colonnaded ambulatory flank- ing an avenue were uncovered. All these architectural features date from the fourth through the sixth cen- tury A.C." A report on the 1986 campaign appeared in BA- SOR Suppl. 26 (1990) 137-77; for 1988 see Symposium 11:2 (1989) 23-41. Salvage excavations were again carried out by the Manisa Museum Directorate in Bintepe in 1989, as on previous occasions. A built chamber tomb with kline in the west of Bintepe had been robbed but important remnants were found in the dromos. Lydian jewelry and tableware rescued from a tu- mulus near Akhisar-Gokgeler in 1970 are illustrated by Director Hasan Dedeoglu in Image of Turkey 24 (1989) 27-30.</page><page sequence="26">148 MACHTELD J.

Dr. Wolfgang Radt reports on the progress of his work in the habitation area between the Hera sanctuary and an east-west street. "The area was expanded to the west in a 25-m wide zone (fig. 27). Only the upper, mostly late Byzantine, strata were excavated. In 1980 excavation had reached the ad- joining zone north of the east-west street. In the newly exposed area, a small church, cemetery, and long building (monastery) seem to have served a small community. The tombs are of 12th-14th century type, also seen elsewhere at Pergamon, and have hardly any gifts. The church once had fresco decoration. Its masonry was built with lime mortar, unlike most house walls, which had plain mud mortar. The opposite long building had a stone staircase along its front leading to the upper story, presumably living quarters over workrooms. "In the western zone of the excavation, typical large, barely worked stones belonging to the Archaic forti- fication wall turned up in secondary context. In the soundings east of the Hera terrace just a few reused blocks survive. Here the main discovery was the anta of the previously suspected Classical south gate jamb (fig. 28, directly west of the Archaic blocks at 205.14). The gate was of overlap type, approached from the southeast via a narrow ramp (level 204.83) with a battered retaining wall (see AA 1989, 401-402). The gate jamb must have continued to the south, perhaps in the form of a bastion, but it was partly removed by the construction of the Philetairan paved glacis (level 203.85). The north entrance wall of the Classical gate has been traced for 32 m (levels 208.95 to 204.52), with a thickness of 4.20 m, perhaps including a pas- sage for circulation. "The Philetairan wall (Hellenistic I in fig. 28) was further exposed. This wall was built on fill and hence had a paved glacis set on bedrock at its outer base, sloping at a 480 angle (fig. 29). Fig. 30 shows the glacis YL from the south, based on bedrock, with its rubble fill. YM is the southernmost preserved end of the Classical gate jamb. In fig. 29 the glacis is seen from the east; YG is the east wall of the Hera terrace; to the left is a Hellenistic tufa wall of the gymnasium. For the rear face of the Philetairan wall, with embra- sure, see fig. 31. "Other projects are soundings to establish the an- cient street system between the excavated area and the upper agora, study of mosaics excavated previ- ously in preparation of a corpus, and magnetometer soundings for the study of the tumuli in the plain of Pergamon. "Trajaneum: study and restoration of the temple and its foundations are proceeding with the aid of modern techniques and media. The northeast corner architraves were put in place at the end of the season. Fig. 29. Pergamon. Glacis of Philetairan wall.</page><page sequence="28">150 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 95 Fig. 30.

Reports have appeared in Symposium 11:2 (1989) 135-53; AA 1989, 387-412 and TiirkArkDerg 28 (1989) 225-61. Studies appeared in IstMitt 38 (1988) 179-87 (Pergamene West Slope ware) and 201-36 (late Hellenistic structures on the acropolis). Phocaea. Prof. Omer Ozyigit started excavation of a hill in the Ismetpapa district, where a ceramic factory dump of the first and second centuries A.C. overlies a Hellenistic necropolis with sarcophagi and tile- graves. Lower levels attest to Classical and Archaic habitation. Kyme. Excavations under the direction of Prof. Sebastiana Lagona in 1988-1989 were concerned with a Mediaeval building near the harbor, a Hellenistic structure on the south hill, where earlier pottery came to light as well, and the orchestra of the theater. A new plan of the site is being prepared. Symposium 11:2 (1989) 64-76. Fig. 31. Pergamon.

Prof. Umit Serdaroglu worked in the nec- ropolis adjoining the west gate. The upper level has Hellenistic sarcophagi, 12 of which were opened. Be- low these lie pithos burials of the Classical period in regular alignment. Cremations are found in am- phorae or hydriae, with kylikes or plates as lids. Smintheion-Giilpinar. Prof. Cogkun Ozgfinel is supervising the partial restoration of the temple and its stepped platform at the southwest corner. Exca- vation continues to yield new frieze fragments (part of a battle scene). In 1990 the remaining modern building over the temple will be removed, with ex- pectation of additional evidence for architecture and sculpture. A report appeared in Symposium 11:2 (1989) 125- 34. Prof. Orhan Bingol comments on the columnae caelatae of the Smintheion in Festschrift Akurgal (An- atolia-Anadolu 23, 1989) 115-26. PROPONTIS-THRACE-BITHYNIA Prokonnesos: Saraylar. Dr. Nuyin Asgari annually studies and rescues ancient quarries and unfinished and/or rejected blocks and carvings. The workshop procedures for the carving of sarcophagus lids were studied with the aid of 28 specimens found at Saraylar. An interim report is in Research Symposium 7 (1989) 93-109. Daskyleion. Prof. Tomris Bakir completed a sec- ond season. She reports that there probably is a pre- historic stratum, attested by stray finds: a green stone celt, flint points, and blades.

The site is disturbed by silos and rob- bers' pits. The ceramic record is rich, starting with bird bowls, East Greek wares, Protocorinthian and Corinthian wares, supplemented by Lydian fragments of the late seventh and sixth centuries B.C. Fragments of ivory point to former luxuries. A terracotta revet- ment with meanders and small crosses is a promising sample of local tradition. The program will include the tumuli to the south- west and east of the mound (total 14). Kyzikos. Prof. Abdullah Yaylali undertook a first campaign in 1989. South of the Temple of Hadrian a sounding yielded many fragments of the sculptured frieze and of architecture. The general topography is being studied. PHRYGIA Aizanoi. Dr. A. Hoffman reports on his work in the stadium in Symposium 11:2 (1989) 261-74. Pessinus. Prof. Devreker worked in the cemetery on the acropolis, which contains small individual bur- ials as well as larger stone-built tombs for multiple burials. The latter continue into the fifth century A.C. Later the site was fortified as a Byzantine citadel. Symposium 11:2 (1989) 275-99 and TiirkArkDerg 28 (1989) 165-75. Amorium. Prof. R.M. Harrison reports on his sec- ond season of excavation of this town near Emirdag northeast of Afyon. "Our main aim is to trace the social and economic changes within the city from the Hellenistic period to early Byzantine. We carried out a general survey of the upper town, the htiyuik, of ca. 5 ha. The principal periods seem to be Byzantine, Selcuk, and later, but prehistoric and Phrygian/Hel- lenistic sherds occur. A small fort (ca. 60 x 30 m) stands in the southwest corner. A large church in the northeast corner is associated with a concentration of blocks, glass, stone tesserae, and painted wall plaster. Evidence for industrial activity was kiln waste and some iron slag. On the southern edge of the upper town we encountered the city wall, a narrow gateway, and a square tower built of dressed stone faces on a hard white mortar rubble core. Eight Roman-Phry- gian funerary stelae, all reused, were found in the upper stratum. "In the lower town, a large building probably of the sixth century A.C. was further explored. On the southwest part of the lower town wall a triangular tower and the south flank of a gateway of the late Roman or earlier period and road were clarified. "The pottery (ca. 10,000 sherds) is predominantly late Roman and early Byzantine, with a good group of late Roman fine wares. Hellenistic and Augustan examples also occur at Amorium." For interim reports see Symposium 11:2 (1989) 155- 65 and AnatSt 39 (1989) 167-74. Docimium. J. Clayton Fant continued his studies of the Docimian quarries in Research Symposium 7 (1989) 111-18 and published Cavum Antrum Phry- giae. Roman Imperial Marble Quarries in Phrygia (BAR-IS 482, 1989). Hierapolis. Prof. Daria De Bernardo Ferrari re- ports on the work in the agora and necropolis in Symposium 11:2 (1989) 245-55. In the Late Antique period the east side of the agora was the site of tile factories bordered by an east-west wall built of spolia; north of this wasters were dumped. Along the west side fifth-sixth century Byzantine houses were built over the marble stoa. In the northeast necropolis the examination and recording of over 200 built tombs was begun. The study of sarcophagi also continues (1650 had been studied by 1988). CAPPADOCIA Kayseri Tumuli. Director Mehmet Eskioglu pub- lishes a tumulus with barrel-vaulted chambers exca- vated intact by the Kayseri Museum at Garipler in 1971, TiirkArkDerg 23 (1989) 189-224. The burial had one gold coin dated to year 2 of Augustus, and in its rich inventory now on display in the museum resembles that of two similar tumuli excavated at Beatepeler in 1940 and 1960, which had gold coins of 46 B.C. and 90 B.C. CILICIA Meydancik. Dr. Alain Davesne reports that he in- vestigated the north entrance road and the tower of the fortified entrance of the citadel in 1989. Several periods came to light, both Hellenistic (with a burnt third-century B.C. level) and a lower Iron Age, Lu- wian structure. The fortifications encircled the entire site over a distance of 2 km. Partly collapsed, partly traced by rock cuttings, they are being studied in context. Large ashlar blocks form the lower courses where preserved. The rock-cut and built tombs on the east slope were cleaned and drawn. The statues from the front of the larger tomb are now in the museum of Silifke. The smaller tomb is of the same style and period (first half of the sixth century B.C.). For 1988 see Symposium 11:2 (1989) 257-60. Kelenderis. Dr. Levent Zoroglu reports that a new 1:1000 survey map has been made of the site and its cemeteries. The rock-cut tombs are of several types. Tomb gifts are Greek and local wares of the late fifth and early fourth centuries B.C. Clearing of the Har- bor Baths is making progress.</page><page sequence="31">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 153 Rock Reliefs.

The temple can be dated to the late Antonine period, probably to Commodus, and may be connected with the emperor cult. It probably was left unfinished and destroyed in the early fourth century. PONTUS Satala. Dr. C.S. Lightfoot has been surveying this site, 25 km south of Kelkit, a legionary fortress guard- ing the Roman frontier in northern Anatolia. Previ- ous work by Biliotti was reported by T.B. Mitford in AnatSt 24 (1974) 221-44. A new plan is being made of the fortress and settlement.
