<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Home Letterbox: Glimpses into the Suburban John Kinsella Kenyon College AS seemed at A 152 SMALL Bateman like CHILD a long Road, I ONCE way, Mount and RAN it AWAY seemed Pleasant, FROM like MY Perth. forever, HOME It at 152 Bateman Road, Mount Pleasant, Perth. It seemed like a long way, and it seemed like forever, but I actually only got as far as the front letterbox and was there for no more than fifteen minutes before my mother came and convinced me to return to the back yard. To me, what signified my adventure was the fact that I sat on the other side of the letterbox - one of those brick-and-mortar jobs shaped like a reclining letter "L", with a flower-box full of geraniums and a galvanized iron letterbox flap that hid snails and spiders if left unattended for even a few days. With my back to the bricks, looking out onto the then- busy traffic of Bateman Road, I'd crossed the cordon sani- taire into the wilds. It wasn't the wilds of the farm, or the bush patches on the farm, but it was a crossing-over. The gardens of that city house were every bit as much part of the childhood pastoral idyll as the country. Furthermore, a few houses away on the corner was an uncleared bush block, and down around the corner, head- ing towards the river where the freeway now jets past, were a few hundred acres of bushland, full of banksias and under- ground cubbies. And beyond that, the Canning River which doglegged into Bull Creek, and the bizarre wonders of Bateman's Landing. The letterbox, then, was a transitional zone, a turnstile into a conflicting world of cars, houses, and "undeveloped" land. A few years before my adventure, I have a vague rec- ollection of the corner telephone box being dynamited, and a recurring memory is the finding of blankets to take to people in accidents, on a notorious corner where quite a few people actually died in car accidents. Out there, out- side Arcadia, was definitive danger. The letterbox at our place was a metaphorical extension of the house, though a good deal of space existed between both. It sat solidly on the boundary of the property - a quar- ter acre - and replicated the beige brick and mortar that supported lines of moss close to the ground. The edges were kept clear around the letterbox, and the six inches of grey sand formed a moat between the brick and the buffalo grass. In there, another world of insects and lizards would walk the metaphorical water to sun themselves on the brick. Later, I learnt the true wonder of the letterbox's func- tion - entering competitions and sending my dollars off for mail orders from the back of comic books, I (occasionally) received letters or notification of a package at the post office through the puckered baked clay lips (Bristile), via the rough concrete interior, and galvanized iron door with Bakelite screw knob. The letterbox was a polymorphous transitional zone: things from an unseen world materialized and brought their pleasures. And, my mother told me, dis- appointments. Bills, bills, bills . . . nothing but bills. As the writer she was in those days, my mother relied on the mail to bring her news of acceptances and rejections, and most importantly, remuneration for her efforts. The letterbox symbolized, or more literally was, a place of dis- appointment and reward. It was Pandora's box, Aladdin's lamp. The genie can give, but can take away as well. The letterbox increasingly seemed a place out of control: a per- verse, even malignant sense of arbitrariness seemed to operate in how it delivered its verdicts. At that time, the end of the '60s, the postman delivered the letters on a bicycle rather than motorbike. His vulner- ability to dogs (there also being somewhat slacker legisla- tion on protecting them from gnashing canines, if I recall correctly) was worsened by his inability to make a fast get- away, and his comparative slow acceleration meant more social interaction with the child or parent watching through the curtain or Venetian blinds for his arrival. Letterboxes and punctuality were a clash of the Titans. For some, I am told, the visiting postie was a social comfort: even a bill meant the possibility of human contact. A familiar face. Riding their bikes, a level of fitness and out- door typeness accompanied these posties. They were the bushies of the suburbs, surveying the firebreaks. Far away from Mount Pleasant, in the rural counties of Ohio, as in many other places in rural America, the post is delivered to outlying houses by private contractors working for the Postal Service, with letters going directly into road- side mailboxes, often clustered in threes and fours between houses. This separation of house and State, combined with its clustering communality, is almost a commentary on the federal versus the local, the familiar versus the unknown (i.e. what's arriving in the mail). Thinking back about neighboring letterboxes, within the world of our back yard there were three fence lines working as borders with four houses. That's because we were facing Antipodes ♦ 163</page><page sequence="2">out from the thin end of a long narrow block. The rela- tionships with people across those fence lines varied con- siderably, from relative familiarity to seeing people vaguely through broken fence pickets. Letterboxes were even more distant entry points. The back garden was the antithesis of the front. Generally hidden from the public eye, tires were burnt, oil dumped in sand, and so on. The garden itself thrived on artificial fertilizer, and no doubt an array of garden chemi- cals were deposited and sprayed. These of course found their way to the front garden as well, and around the let- terbox. The greener someone's lawn, the more you knew the ground (and ground water beneath) had been poi- soned. The neater the garden, the more likely noxious chemicals had been at work: back then, it was DDT as well as ant killer. Digging in our back garden behind the great double shed that could hold two trucks (reinforced con- crete), my brother and I unearthed a massive cache of phar- maceuticals that had been buried before the house was built - buried in what was then local bush. The police never supplied a satisfactory answer. The anti-pastoral of the country, the Indykian "poisoned pastoral" reached close into the city, or had not been driven out very far in the middle suburbs of the '60s and early 70s. The letterboxes either side of us were of the free-stand- ing sort: basically metal latticework columns supporting house-shaped boxes made of sheet metal. They seemed vul- nerable, and I certainly recall their being knocked over by storms and passing kids. "Get away from that bloody letter- box, you little bastards." But analogies with the peace or battles within these neighboring families did not seem con- tingent on the type of letterbox they had. The seesawing motions of family interaction continued regardless. Down around the corner, heading towards the Brentwood shops, there was a block of flats called Wongabeena. The letter- boxes out the front were of the same milky white bricks as the main building, and the Ned Kelly visor slots stared out- wards, their objective correlative numbers shining below. Kids walking back from school would shove firecrackers in them - in the days when firecrackers formed part of most juvenile arsenals. Pam Brown's ironic version of the pas- toral in her poem "Arcadia," ("&amp; not far away, / a heritage town [. . .]"), universalizes the regional, the parochial, in a kind of Cars that Ate Paris crisis of civilization and tradi- tion. The letterbox (a legacy of the suburban?) - symbol of civilized communication - is brought down: the metal letterbox blown up in the traditional manner - a double bunger on the night of the national holiday. Demolishing letterboxes is not uncommon. In recent times, there have been spates of blowing up letterboxes in York and, I am told, in Mount Lawley. On the surface, dam- aging a letterbox is easy because it most often sits on the 164 ♦ December 2004 property boundary line or is a gateway into the property itself, so the offender is both inside and outside at once; it is a literal violation of private space from the public, a form of desecration, and yet it allows for enough removal from the familiar to desensitize the crime. In Britain, the National Campaign for Firework Safety carries numerous examples of fireworks being used in let- terboxes with dire results: "November 7, 2002: . . . The Greater Manchester mother told how she suffered a mis- carriage after the firework was pushed through her letter- box by young thugs. The woman almost died." The use of the word "thugs" is part of the desire to sepa- rate social perversity from the norm, with the thugs operat- ing outside the State, and the expectant mother being a nur- turer of the good, ordered State, but there are gender impli- cations as well, as part of this. That's not to suggest that there's anything positive in what the "thugs" do - it is obvi- ously deplorable. The mail slot in Britain usually goes straight into the home, in the actual door of the house, so it's a violation of the home-as-body. The action of the "thugs" becomes a rape-murder fantasy scenario, where their unseen victim (whether known or not), becomes as inanimate as the house itself. The violation is carried out with apparent- ly fewer emotional implications for the perpetrators. The letterbox being a transitional zone, in which objects of only a certain size may pass through (offering some protection), and as a consequence a place of surveillance, has offered no protection. The State has been unable to protect through its icon and devices of good communication. There's also the penetration of the restrained hymeneal space: the squeezing of the dangerous and large phallus into the restricted entry. The impeding of sexual and emo- tional development is epitomized in the fort-da game of children: taking away and putting back, moving away and returning. The letterbox symbolizes this, but also the irre- trievability of an object. The use of the public letterbox to mail something, and wanting to retrieve it after it's gone through the slot or door, is a common twist to slapstick (and more serious) film scenarios. The depositing of the seed, the risk of pregnancy. The letterbox is two-way traffic. The bombing of a let- terbox stops this two-way traffic and seeks empowerment of the perpetrator over the victim. It simultaneously chal- lenges the State. This cause and effect are inextricably linked. The radical and retrograde are intimately connect- ed. In the book and the film, The Postman Always Rings Twice, the very title itself plays on the fear engendered in the public confirmation of mail and mail being delivered, and the threat that evolves if the expected patterns aren't adhered to. In another incident recorded on the same day at Preston, UK: "A sandwich shop was badly damaged after thugs threw a firework through the letterbox, sparking a blaze . . ." Once again, the faceless thugs, enemies of good order. The threat is like the unseen terrorist threat, and the fight against fireworks becomes a kind of war against terrorism: its targets indecisive, its tools of retribution (the police)</page><page sequence="3">dangerously akin to the very thing they are working against. The one-way flap on the letterbox or the narrow aperture, or the padlock on the "box," create a blockage to the very surveillance the citizens of the State want. They fear behind closed doors. Community lacks open conversation. The theft of letters, the reading of their contents, is an obvious violation of the personal, but the destruction of the means of receiving these is more fundamental. We never know what really happens to our mail from the time it leaves our hand to the time it arrives at its destination: there are many ways of surveying and tampering with its contents. But the letterbox is something we can see and monitor, and the ineffectiveness of such surveillance cre- ates a sense of the vulnerable. In some ways, letterboxes are muted two-way mirrors to the outside world. The freestanding letterbox is so much part of the Australian suburban myth of the quarter-acre block, with its attendant cultural insensitivity and occupa- tion of space. The quarter-acre block represents the egali- tarian right of all Australians to own a slice of the "lucky country," but of course it colonizes more and more indige- nous space. It also destroys more and more natural vegeta- tion and wildlife. The freestanding letterbox becomes the flag for this occupation, this ranching, and the city becomes a place of small farms. The freestanding letterbox becomes, as I said before, the turnstile, the porters' house at the gate of the estate: it regulates what comes in and out. Letterboxes find their origin in Britain, where they first started appearing in 1849. According to TheFreeDictionary.com, "Before then, letterboxes of a sim- ilar design had been installed in the doors and walls of post offices for people to drop off outgoing mail. An example of such a letterbox (originally installed in the wall of the Wakefield Post Office) is dated 1809 and believed to be the oldest example in Britain." But the slot in the wall has a very different cultural register from that of the freestanding letterbox. Even with apartments and flats in Perth, there is usually a separate space at the front of the property for the delivery of mail. The idea of dropping the mail directly into the place of abode is distinctly at odds with the cordon san- itaire separation of spaces. The myth of Australian space, of the fair go, applies to the smallest and most compacted residence as it does to the largest. The separated transitional zone of the letterbox is pivotal. People coming too near outdoors uninvited must be kept to a minimum. This is not to say the slot in the door doesn't exist here; it does, increasingly. Population and planning pressures change the nature of personal inter- actions, intensify familiarity in the (camera-) surveyed space. The surveillance camera becomes the distance between the house window and the freestanding letterbox. The mail suffers a loss of connection with address changes and new tenants in a block of flats. Mail hovers in no-man's land, is tossed in bins, returned to sender, inter- feres with the new tenants' sense of possession, belonging, and security. Most of us would rather it wasn't there. The codes of belonging are about deleting the presence of what came before. In the same way, the surveying, the clearing of native flora and fauna, and the laying of roads and utilities, establishes a new language of negotiating with a space before houses and gardens start to appear. The call for many years to owners of Perth properties has been to convert back from European-style gardens, or semi- tropical gardens, which rely on large amounts of water, to "native" gardens. The removal of lawn which is so water- thirsty, and rose bushes, is more than a water conservation move. It's a transformational move in which aspects of the earlier deletion are reclaimed as authentically part of the colonizing identity. The return to what came before or, more precisely, the mirroring of what came before - because native gardens are certainly not what was present before; they give the impression they are - represents a step up in confidence of belonging, that fear, or at best guilt, regarding what had been deleted has now passed, that there is no risk of it being reclaimed. Reclaiming might come about through proving connection, but all signs of that connection having been successfully removed, it's safe to start again. Fay Zwicky made the claim that Perth is like a well- watered garden at the edge of the desert, I have written an essay that uses as starting point the claim that Perth is a kind of lush paradise, and much has been written about the precarious nature of a city using more water than it can sus- tain. Behind the letterbox comes the garden, the con- trolled wilds that we diversify with varying degrees of com- fort. Crossing the lawn, walking the driveway or path to the letterbox, we traverse a fiction of place. Within a place, another place or places is created. Andrew Taylor's poem "The Gardener and His Garden: A Dialogue," with its metaphysical overtones, creates a conduit between the fixed abode, the place of residence, and the exotica of the world where we are not, through the change- able and malleable medium of the garden. Life remains fixed and socially secure, yet the world's wilds come to the garden. The suburban garden is a liminal space anchored by house, letterbox, fences, and roads. The poem begins: Ignoring the dour alternatives of winter I've planted a fleshy tropic which the sun should never graze, lolloping if it can under a canopy of trees much prized and slaughtered for their furniture grain. Transported though, on the salt-water edge of summer, sun slanting like a flare from the Grim Scythe, no matter how I water it, it decides no for now. All is bent to the will of the gardener, who will defy sea- sons and climate, but there's resistance. The seeds of discord have been sown, if you like. The play between "dour alter- natives" and "fleshy tropic" is played against the "graze" and "lolloping" with regard to the sun: the ironic counterplay to the gardener's desired omnipotence creates a sense of the absurdity of the suburban agenda. "Transported" evokes convict transportation, the forced passage, and therefore Australia's origins as a colonized space, and the inability to Antipodes ♦ 165</page><page sequence="4">control completely what one has punitively established. The plants cannot be controlled where they don't belong: "decides no for now." The model of the garden (opposite to Gioverà painted garden in Tasmania) is one in which the conditions of ordered society are challenged, but: I won't take that for an answer. Like a middle-rank executive it will mature, I determine, and grow into its role. Elms have, poplars, blackberries, the flu virus, Paterson's curse. So shall this. Like the roll calls and lists of Homer's Iliad, here's a roll call of colonization, mustered under the power-hungry mid- die-ranker who will overthrow his boss in order to usurp his boss's (dubious) power. The garden is a cultural and class bat- tleground; it's a place where wealth strategies are played out. The next stanza of the poem is italicized, the gardener's garden answering back. In the pastoral eclogue tradition, the right of reply is implicit, and the anthropomorphic alle- gorical urge is ironized and ridiculed. The poem is answer- ing back to the poet, writing in his "space," a space as medi- ated contextually as that of the garden. Transported like a felon to provide some far-flung scion of a British stock his dotty sense of what the tropics are or might be, had he ever been awash with crocodiles and curious bugs and universal mozzies, we eke out a post-colonial repertoire of roles: exotica, noteworthy introduced species, plant of the month, old- fashioned but still of some appeal then common stock, then weed. The garden is telling us what we already know through dramatic irony: the satirical tone and shifts of language in the first two stanzas have set the gardener up on his garden stage. The stage is simply replying, but with a subterranean critical knowledge of experience: it's happened before. The greed of the gardener is to keep the phantom body growing, to deny the virtual, to make real the screen of the garden bending to his will. The gardener's reply: Sand isn't enough, nor the plants sand succours. I want this world, and a world elsewhere. The garden here is like the post-box, since we receive our mail from elsewhere to enjoy elsewhere in our own space, like the exotica in a garden. (As an aside, when I was in my early days of publishing poetry, 1 asked a visiting American poet if a particular American journal was worth sending poems to. He said, "They're hard to get into, but they might like the look of your pretty Australian stamps!") The stanza continues: I want melaleuca and lawn, banksia and basil. I want what I have 166 ♦ December 2004 and the promise of what I can grow - a desert and a tropic, a gardener's absurdity, produced at the point of knife at the tip of a house. Outed by the garden, the gardener gets direct. This is warfare, and the world will bend to his will. By extension, we might conjecture that the swamp will be filled in, the hill flattened, to make way for the suburbs, and its gardens. The right to grow one's own food is fundamental to notions of freedom and liberty, even though cities feed off the country, sucking sustenance in, sending the waste to the country (to York, where the council holds sewage from the city near the local flora and fauna reserve!). This notion of democracy is displaced by the stage of the garden, and a mirror-world in which an apparent sustaining of self and family is created. The garden is a model of many little sim- ulacra that give the impression of having a template. It is the decorative real, in which the kitchen garden might supplement the table, but not sustain entirely, where the cool of the palms is reinforced by air-conditioning, where the starkness of the melaleuca is softened by cushions and carpet. The garden has the last word: We age together, but more gracefully than he, that stringy fool with secateaurs, twine, and a short memory . A bleak ars poetica for humanity, spoken by its subject; the communal versus the singular pleasure- seeking agency of the human. Designed for this pleasure-seeking aspect, but also as a calmative, the park is a core part of the Australian suburb, especially the older suburbs. It is the tamed wilds where the community can share space, a neutral ground of possibili- ties. A place of sports, picnics, and after-hours entertain- ment. It's considered healthy to have a certain amount of public space in most cities of the world, and in some, like our own, this is strongly legislated. The nature of that space has changed, and will continue to change, as the quarter- acre block has given way to the fifth of an acre and then split-level three-in-one on a single block. The intensifying of urban living is a practical and economic matter, but the old garden and the space are vestigial: the tiered garden, the sparser suggestion of the Mediterranean, have become cultural ploys mixed in with a return to the native. The let- terbox shifts with this: space is at a premium. Where we live in York, there's a letterbox at the corner of the top paddock. The mail is not delivered here as we're beyond the town limits - we collect our mail with a key from the boxes at the post office in the main street. These are the crypt-like depositories where transitions from the world of the dead to the living are made. The unused letterbox was placed in the paddock before any- one was aware that mail didn't get this far. And there it sits, maybe in the hopes that one day legislation will change that.</page><page sequence="5">At another house my family once lived in years ago - the old Geraldton hospital, opposite the prison (now no longer there because it was knocked down before anyone could protest, replaced by a shopping center car park) - the let- terbox was an afterthought. As a very early colonial build' ing, its letters were delivered direct to the door. When it became a private residence (actually owned by the educa- tion department), the letterbox ended up perched on the front fencepost by the gate. An acre of lawns and garden were behind that fence, and the letterbox seems a very slight entry point to what was penetrable from so many dif- ferent points. The confidence of space? 1 have suggested that the letterbox perched on the boundary line becomes a halfway house, a place of surveil- lance, and yet in this case it seems the opposite. I think it's to do with the confidence, even the arrogance of the colo- nial public place. The old hospital was a central and entire- ly necessary point of the community. The house was built with a public function in mind, and even as a private resi- dence it spoke of authority and functionality. So the letter- box doesn't need to work as a delay or protection, the pro- tection is built into the functionality of openness. What's available to all is protected by its social necessity. Extending this argument, the freestanding suburban let- terbox becomes a device of paranoia, a reflection of the uncertainty in urban security. It's like having mail delivered to a central point at the front of the retirement village, because those who have retreated within have done so out of a need for care, security, and familiarity. The letterbox doesn't stop them experiencing intrusion into their space, but it delays it. It's like an airlock. It was at least partly because his bombs were delivered through the mail that the American Unabomber so terror- ized the country. The recent anthrax scare sent shockwaves through America because death could arrive silently through anyone's letterbox. The postal services became the front line and suffered the casualties of the fight against the surveillance-dodging intruder. To protect the home dweller, ways of monitoring mail for biological and other agents became standard. There's a spe- cific and well-founded fear at work here, but also some- thing symbolic as well. The threat to personal liberty is most feared when the individual does not know where it is coming from. Whether or not the anthrax letters were specifically connected to 9/1 1 terrorism is not clear, though it is likely the perpetrator/s made use of the fear engendered by those events, either to further their cause, to comment perversely on issues of security surrounding those events, or maybe entirely independently of them (though this would seem unlikely given the targeting of Capitol Hill offices). Locating the source of the anthrax, and the place of mailing, became the focus. Was it anthrax from Iraq, anthrax grown in United States laboratories? This provid- ed contradictory scenarios, as the source of pre-first-Gulf War anthrax in Iraq was very likely American (or other Western) laboratories in the first place, at least in terms of family and types of spores. The use made by the Bush gov- ernment of the scare to further its own agendas is clear. It became part of the fabric of the war on terror, despite it being very likely an act of purely domestic terrorism done for personal revenge or again of some tangential sort. The Unabomber's activities, many years before the anthrax episodes, were aimed at corporate America, and the disaffected individual who carried them out saw himself as fighting federal corruption. His ends were political, though not part of any greater movement. The fear this ruthlessness brought about was not highlighted as some international attack on America, but as the work of a dis- affected individual. Over a longer period of time (at this stage), and with more casualties, the Unabomber's cam- paign was one of genuine terror, with an aim to overthrow corporate America. As it was pre-9/11, it was never used in the same way as the anthrax scares, which were welded to the war on Iraq, a war started for very different reasons than those claimed, as has become abundantly evident. The violation of the letterbox - be it in the post office wall, freestanding on one's own block of land, a batch of boxes inside an apartment building foyer or lobby, a slot in the wall - became part of the symbol of the attack on America, its freedom, and by extension that of its allies. As the perversities multiply, the letterbox is at the fore- front of the war against terrorism. And if we believe that this war is a false war, a war that is as much to do with a new imperialism as protecting the innocent, that it's an act of cultural revenge and a Christian crusade against Islam that makes an excuse of the tragedy of 9/1 1, that tar- gets not only the culprits but whole cultures, then the let- terbox must be claimed, or even reclaimed, as a place of community and exchange. Instead of being the demarca- tion line, the place of surveillance, it should be the place of non-violent interaction. TheFreeDictionary.com's entry on letterboxes is an inter- esting place to start this investigation of the language of let- terboxes. It's a net site, and as such part of the phenomenon that has changed the way we think about the letterbox, at least on the surface. The email letterbox comes directly into our home, but is not necessarily a fixed space - it can be checked from any computer anywhere in the world. The most we can achieve in removing physical objects arriving by mail or courier to our personal home is to have it sent to a neutral space where we collect it or it's forwarded on (to protect living space and create a sense of anonymity), a mailbox at a post office, or to have our mail held poste restante at a "foreign" post office in a city during our travels. The electronic letterbox is a private but comparatively neutral space. It can be set up using a false identity, and the false identity can check in from wherever without being surveyed or needing to provide evidence of identity to pick up mail. It's far easier, in essence, to be anonymous and part of something at the same time. The real person receiving real mail regarding money owed, or other personal legali- ties, becomes separate from the world of private correspon- dence. Fraud is easier to perpetrate because of the slippage between these real and false identities. The letterbox and Antipodes ♦ 167</page><page sequence="6">those identities making use of it, with regard to both receiving and sending, have mutated. The letterbox becomes a maker of alternative and even false histories of personal identity and interactions and also of wider social, cultural, and economic histories. But the electronic letterbox can live effectively without snailmail and its hard copy. Amazon.com might accept orders elec- tronically but delivers its books by snailmail. The virtual and the "real" intersect. The most interesting thing about the letterbox entry on the TheFreeDictionary.com site are the "External Links." First, "U.S. Patent #483525 for a design of letterbox held by George Beckett." Let's not click here, for our purposes we have enough information. Next, there are a couple of quotes (you can get "more") under "References in classic literature." Note how conservative the choices are: At first, everyone was eager to write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letterbox by one or the other of the sisters, who felt rather impor- tant with their Washington correspondence. (Little Women by Louisa May Alcott) Then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into our letterbox. ("The Valley of Fear" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle) If context is everything, then what we have here are dif- ferent accounts of the mechanism of letterbox (as postbox to send and letterbox to receive, in essence), placed against the greater mechanism of the novels they are extracted from. The letterbox, the sending and reception points of the mail, become nodes or points of contact with the author's own craft, his or her own reality. It's yet a further example of the cybernetic human, in which the text itself becomes part of the operation of production. The letterbox, the post- box, and the letter itself, become fetishes divorced from their pragmatic actions. The human melds with the object. Syntactically, the subject and object become one. More interesting is the next section of FreeDictionary.com's "letterbox" page: "Some articles men- tioning letterbox": "Anthony Trollope"; "Black box"; "Box Car Racer (album)"; "Box set"; "Dots and Boxes"; "Economy of Lichtenstein"; "International Boxing"; "Organization"; "Investigation of the arrest of Dreyfus"; "Kappa"; "Letterbox"; "Lichtenstein"; "List of albums (L); "Magic Adventures of Mumfie"; "NBA (Disambiguation)"; "PO"; "Text box"; "The Purloined Letter", "Thomas Brown"; "U" . . . All of these links seem tempting, though some more pre- dictable than others. "Organization" seems a generic take on the malevolence behind the mailbox: a way of tracking and containing people, a way of making sure laws are sub- scribed to, bills are paid. The letterbox is a key to the con- trolled society. Let's not go there. "The Purloined Letter" might furnish some more interesting literary lines than the Alcott and Doyle quotes, but the issues of context will side- track us. "Mumfie" seems fun, and "U" suitably deceptive. "Lichtenstein" gets two mentions, probably to the same 168 ♦ December 2004 article. The "NBA (Disambiguation)" is linguistically tempting; it would be the National Basketball Association of America, but what has it to do with letterboxes, and what is disambiguation? Essentially, the links show that the letterbox like any other word can be as invested with specific or tangential meaning as context desires. The letterbox, the further we explore indirect commentary, loses its iconicity and becomes a function of circumstances. The Internet is highly effective at doing this; so in checking an email in your electronic mailbox, you can link into a webpage mid-reading an email, and from there on digress from the original letter. The schematics of specificity are diluted, and surveillance seem- ingly becomes further and further away. Of course, an elec- tronic signature is left, but that can be distorted and, as I have said, the identity of the user vague at best. The letter- box becomes the uncontrolled and entirely permeable place that no amount of firewalls and anti-virus software can pro- tect from attempts to violate its imagined sanctity. From SPAM to passwords, the protected space becomes the challenge to violate in a pandemic way: more so than letterbox bombings and people stealing your mail. There's a Dead Kennedys song "Stealing People's Mail," and the last few verses go: People say that we're crazy We're sick and all alone But when we read your letters We're rolling on the floor We got more license plates, wedding gifts, tax returns Checks to politicians from real estate firms Money, bills and cancelled checks We cut relationships with your friends We're going to steal your mail On a friday night We're going to steal your mail By the pale moonlight Singing at a frenetic pace, lead vocalist and lyricist Jello Biafra invades your private space. His scream is a scream against the threats to your personal and civil liberties and the irony that such liberties rely on the icon of polite social exchange. Mail is a private correspondence traversing the public space, and though this refers to physical pieces of mail, the same applies to the electronic. The letterbox is an expres- sion of confidence that society is basically functioning to pro- tect your private space, and more relevantly, the sanctity of property. The freestanding letterbox in particular is vulnera- ble to aggression and presents itself as a target. The fact that so many remain standing becomes a confirmation that law and order and the illusion of good society hold sway. It's an outward symbol of a greater surveillance: a police surveil- lance of the collective property, private and State-owned. The damage the Dead Kennedys invoke is a psychologi- cal one against complacency: that "all is well" is an illusion, and that it's the orders of the state (wedding gifts and real estate firms are the products not of freedom but of social</page><page sequence="7">manipulation and are as much about profit and power as the "checks" themselves). They are saying "don't be safe." And that those who get the crazy delight, those society would see as miscreants for doing so, are outside your con- trol. The "stealers" have no desire to be part of the social fabric, to be part of the controls that mail, as allegory and quite literally, brings. The song ends: We better not get caught We'll be dumped in institutions Where we'll be drugged and shocked 'til we come out born-again christians. The social deconstruction is obvious here, but the double irony is that in those institutions they have no access to letterboxes, yet those who would lock them up for offend- ing rights of privacy, property, and State, are already impris- oned within the institutions they have created to protect themselves. This Dead Kennedys song undoes a pastoral in which landscape has been replaced by the overlapping lines of ploughing that are letter trails. Breaking out of the family home, the American traveler becomes the Winnebago Warrior, "true Yankee pioneer." The letterbox suffers its own disquiets. Control systems are disrupted when they are used for private pamphleteer- ing (or electronic SPAM), when the regular times of State delivery are altered by circumstances such as the weather. A vulnerability develops. Non-delivery days such as Sundays and public holidays suggest the systems of surveil- lance of networking that represent the State in the suburbs (police stations, schools, and the post office, etc), have earned their rest, that they are in control and functioning effectively enough to have downtime. Surveillance and control lessen on those days. We cross our gardens for plea- sure, rather than to make the run to the letterbox. Poetry may investigate the machinery of the letterbox, its place in the (specifically) city or town network of surveil- lance and control. The Australian poet Bruce Dawe actual- ly worked as postman, and the delivering of news itself in his poem is more than a passing reference; it becomes a specific coordinate on the map of the public-private space interplay. The telegram in particular, delivered to the door, bypasses all safety gaps and protections against the outside world: and on to cities in whose wide web of suburbs telegrams tremble like leaves from a wintering tree and the spider grief swings in his bitter geometry - they're bringing them home, too late, too early. These concluding lines of "Homecoming" are part of one of the most cutting anti-war poems written in Australia. These are the harbingers of the bodies brought home in "plastic green bags." The police or military arrival at the door with the letter or message that there has been a death traverses all boundaries. The State comes in person to tell of how one of its parts has been lost. It then leaves, and the lost limb is replaced, leaving those whose boundaries have been crossed, shattered. Poems and stories as or like postcards are almost a liter- ary genre, and the epistolary poem certainly is. The poem as letter is distinct from the letter or letterbox in the poem. It dictates its own terms of presentation and is the focus for the conversation between reader and writer. Conversations between "readers" and "writers" might also take a more embodied form in the external world. An increasingly popular pastime in the United States is that of Letterboxing. Letterboxing in the States has its origin in a 1998 Smithsonian article on the phenomenon in the UK, which proponents there claim dates back to the mid-nine- teenth century. It consists of creating a "letterbox" - usual- ly a sealable container that encloses a visitors' book, pen, and rubber stamp - and leaving it out in the open some- where. Enthusiasts follow clues to the letterbox, which they may get from a clues catalogue, then stamp their own book with that letterbox's stamp to show they have been there. This "orienteering and treasure-hunting game" has spread worldwide. The letterbox becomes a two-way mir- ror, in which people "steal" each other's mail, and record proof of their having been there - a mail system without content. It's a give-and-take scenario: the intrusion is wel- comed, but gratification is delayed by the search. The movement between public and private space is real- ly the key to understanding the phenomenon of the letter- box and its environs. The letterbox on the corner of the city or suburban block, or outside the post office waiting to receive our mail, is the communal ligature in the way that the home letterbox is its declaration of the private. Both are required to make the equation of transference work. To one you deliver your mail in person, to the other someone delivers for you. The personal and the public are insepara- ble, and the posting of the mail as a sexual dynamic is as much a part of a physicality as receiving it, as removing it from the letterbox oneself. The process of exchange, of cre- ating our personal boundaries, is regulated and controlled by the State whose true effectiveness is in staying as unob- trusive as possible. The post office is the nerve center of the community. As the Patriot Act in the United States allows for the check- ing of what an individual takes out of a library, so can peo- ple's behavioral patterns be observed via the post office. In her poem sequence "The Mandelstam Letters," Dorothy Hewett begins "Last Letters from the Transport Camp Vitoraya Rechka, near Vladivostok" with: Let me tell you about the last days of Osip Mandelstam. You will go to the Post Office at Nikita Gate, and be handed a parcel, ADDRESSEE DEAD, you will need no wit- nesses, learn of it only by hearsay. The post office and letterbox might be imperfect systems of State control: we can deny them, can escape them, but they are ever- vigilant. Events take place via their systems by proxy, and they continue to function no matter how great the crimes of the State. Thugs might be out there, but the State's thuggery exists on both sides of the mail slot.

Together, they feed on the power grid and create a sociology of town planning. Alone, they speak through the mailbox - despite telephones and Internet - and the postman is watched from the refuge of the window, connecting prospect and letterboxes as dots on his map. □ JOHN Kinsella is the author of twenty books whose many prizes and awards include the Grace Leven Poetry Prize, the John Bray Award for Poetry, The Age Poetry Book of the Year Award, The Western Australian Premier's Prize for Poetry (twice), a Young Australian Creative Fellowship, and senior Fellowships from the Literature Board of the Australia Council.
