Hermann Gufler and Njakoi John Bah Abstract. - In this article the authors give a detailed account of the introduction and historical vicissitudes of the growth and development of one key political, ritual, and performative element of Oku society. The princes' society in Oku (rjgele) was introduced from the fraternal chief dom of Nso' in the late 1940s. The interplay of ongoing interchiefdom relations and the exchange of performance of associations involved in the triangular relationship between neighbouring groups and the administration are brought to light in the context of this tale of rjgele. Since the authors were dealing with relatively recent historical events they were able to use good oral testimonies as well as administrative and judicial documents. [Cameroon, Western Grassfields, Oku Kingdom, palace institutions, princes' society (rjgele)7 Hermann Gufler is a member of St. Joseph's Missionary Society. Since 1967, he has been working in various parts of the Western Grassfields of Cameroon and is currently working in Elak-Oku where he continues to conduct research. He has published several articles on the Yamba which were republished in "Affliction and Moral Order. Conversations in Yambaland (Cameroon)" (Canterbury 2003). - See also Ref. Cited. Njakoi John Bah, a native of Oku, graduated from Yaounde University with a degree in law (1992) before becoming research assistant to Nicolas Argenti from 1992-1994. Since then, he has continued to conduct and publish independent ethnographic research and at the same time he has been engaged in a volunteer programme of the Human Rights Clinic and Education Centre, B amenda, in Elak-Oku. He has published various articles on the Oku society in Baessler-Archiv, Tribus, and Anthropos. 1 Introduction Much has already been written about the palaces of the Cameroon Grassfields and their institu- tions.1 However, as Argenti (pers. comm.) pointed out, most of these papers cover a great deal of complicated material with the result that one gets a tantalising glimpse of all the palace institutions but not really a full examination of any of them. A detailed study of the origin, development, and changes or adaptations of a single palace institu- tion may also supply an answer to an intriguing question Mzeka raised in connection with the in- troduction of new rjgiri masks and the adaptation of old ones in 1967 in Nso': "is the creation of new dances, institutions or jujus an adulteration of culture or its enhancement?" (1980: 116). In this paper we focus on the establishment of the princes' society, rjgele,2 in the small kingdom of Oku, located in the centre of the Cameroon Grassfields, and describe its turbulent history since its fledgling beginning in the late 1940s up to the present. Princes in most, if not all, of the eastern Grassfields chiefdoms were debarred from entering gwerog, the regulatory society recruited from commoner lineages, which existed virtual- ly in all the palaces. The princes, however, had their own secret society called ggiri. The exis- tence of princes' societies has been reported from 1 Mzeka (1980), Bah (2004); one entire edition of Paideuma (1985) was devoted to contributions by Cameroon scholars on Grassfields' palaces. 2 rjgele derives from rjgiri (variously spelled nggiri, ngiri, ngirri, Ngirrih, ngiirri), the Lamnso' word for the princes' society in Nso' . In the process of adaptation it has changed from rjgiri to rjgele the term widely used in Oku.</page><page sequence="2">56 Hermann Gufler and Njakoi John Bah Bamum (Tardits 1980; Geary 1983), Nso' (Mzeka 1980:106-116; Chilver and Kaberry 1967:102; Chem-Langhëë et al. 1985), Ntem (Chilver 1961; Chilver and Kaberry 1967: 111), Mbiame (Koloss 2000), and the Wimbum chiefdoms of Mbot (Chil- ver and Kaberry 1967: 107) and Wiya (Jeffreys 1962: 92-94). The dynasties of these chiefdoms invariably claim an origin from Kimi (present-day Bankim). We are told virtually identical stories of small princely emigrant groups which claimed to have brought with them "the things of Rifum" - "the regulatory society gwerog, the princes' so- ciety ggiri, and the model of seven royal coun- cillors and seven palace stewards" (Chilver and Kaberry 1967: 23). Whether the princely emigrants actually brought "the things of Rifum" along with them is open to question. In Nso', for exam- ple, there is a strong oral tradition which says that rigiri was introduced from Bamum "with- in living memory" (Mzeka 1980: 106). There is a similar story in Bamum. The acquisition of the ngürri society is placed during the reign of King Nshare. An attendant of Nshare named nji Moghe went to Bankim (i.e., Rifum), in or- der to acquire the instruments of ngürri (Tardits 1980: 112; Geary 1983:41). It seems that in the course of time the princes' society, in Bamum at least, underwent a change as paraphernalia of secret societies of neighbours were appropriated and integrated to become part of ngürri (Geary 1983:41). Whatever the ultimate origin, ggiri is, in fact, not originally Tikar. According to Njoya (1952: 133 f.) it was acquired by Kimi from Ngute (Wute [Vute]) and according to Price (1979: 91) by Ngambe (another Tikar chiefdom) from the Mimble clan (possibly also Wute). Njoya recounts variants of a rather bloodthirsty legend of its intro- duction in Kimi.3 It is quite likely that the spread of ggiri is connected with the period of Wute expansion. 3 The legend tells of three chiefs (princes?), uterine brothers, who had left "Nguti" (Wute) and were invited by the Fon of Kimi to settle at Rifum. A child of the Fon ventured into their quarters and saw rjgiri. They killed the child and ate him. The Fon demanded that they give him ygiri. After this incident the three chiefs left, crossed the River Mape, and settled there. - We are grateful to Sally Chilver for giving us this important information and to Ian Fowler for providing us with a copy of the relevant passages from Njoya' s "Histoire et coutumes des Bamum." 2 The Princes' Section (kechiale) in the Oku Palace before the Advent of g gele The situation in Oku was different. Only one secret society existed in the Oku Palace, viz. kwifon, as the regulatory society is called in Oku.4 ggele, the secret society of the princes (ghon ntok, sg. wan ntok) and members of the royal family (Mbele), did not exist before 1948. "ygele is not an old thing. It was not in Oku at the beginning" (Faay Manko), "ggele has come from Nso' brought in by dbkuo we lane (present-day Oku)" (Faay Nsanen). Its introduction was a difficult and long drawn-out process, which caused bitter animosity between FonJkwifon and the members of the ggele society as well as deep divisions within the royal family and the Oku population as a whole. The princes had their meeting place in the Lower Palace called kechiale (literally "mud," "swampy place"), sometimes also referred to as eyshaa ntok - "below the palace"),5 where some royal masquerades (omnkum md ntok) were kept. The origin of kechiale is not clear. Ndishangong (1984: 57 ff) reports an oral tradition according to which, during the reign of Fon Yancho6, members of kwifon attempted to kill a son of the Fon. A serious confrontation broke out between kwifon and the princes. The princes separated from kwi- fon and transferred their meeting place down to kechiale. According to Faay Ndintonen, the royal masquerade chiaamfa was acquired at that time and was under their control. The princes gave the nickname gkiy meaning "spy" or "observer" to its "running juju." gkiy was supposed to spy on kwifon and its activities. This tradition has little currency in Oku. One thing it seems to bring out clearly, is that the troubled relationship between the regulatory society kwifon and the princes is not something that started only of recent. Before the advent of ggele in 1948, there were two groups of masquerades in the Oku palace, viz. the kwifon masquerades and dmnkum ma ntok (royal masquerades). There are seven dmnkum mo ntok, viz. (1) chiaamfa/gkiy, (2) fenjii, (3) laabe, (4) nsum, (5) beg, (6) sekse and (7) fentiy. Only some of them are kept at kechiale. 4 Princes and members of the royal family could become members of kwifon, if they were not too closely related to the Fon. 5 For a map of the royal palace in Elak-Oku see Bah (2004: 438). 6 Fon Yancho is 7th in the king list following Krauß [1990: 30], or 8th following Koloss [2000: 29]. Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="3">The Establishment of the Princes' Society in Oku, Cameroon 57 2.1 Chiaamfa/rjkiy All informants were unanimous that chiaamfa/ykiy is the oldest and most important. According to Nforme Ndula there was only one house in kechiale before the introduction of shiorj in 1948 and that was ndaa rjkiy (house of rjkiy). Faay Laa supports this statement: "Oku had one thing at kechiale and that was chiaamfa/rjkiy". In fact some members of rjgele today call rjkiy the "founder" of the rjgele society. Koloss (2000:251) reports that at some point in the past the princes misused the "medicines" of chiaamfa after which it was dissolved by kwifon and its masks incorporated into f9lerjgarj, the main kwifon masquerade.7 It was Fon Yancho who returned some of the masks to the princes, thus reestablishing chiaamfa. According to Faay Ndintonen, members of chiaamfa who become nchiyse ndaa (members of kwifon) are free to join f9lerjgarj without further initiation. This ties in with another source which says that fdleygaij and chiaamfa were "originally one thing," brought to Oku by the Nkem family. Members of that family point out that even today the appearance of rjkiy is still announced by shouts of '"Taboiye, Taboiye,' the name of the lesser king who once led the Nkem [family] to Oku" (Koloss 2000: 251). When chiaamfa dances as a group, rjkiy, its single or "running" mask, does not take part in the dancing, rjkiy is alleged to have been confis- cated from an unnamed family. This seems to have been a common practice in the past. Secret soci- eties, masquerades, or dances were either forceful- ly appropriated by seizing the paraphernalia from conquered neighbours or by peaceful means such as entering into an alliance with compounds, lin- eages, or neighbouring tribes. This was part of a centralisation process whereby lineage-based ac- tivities were increasingly appropriated by power- collecting palace authorities (Gufier 1997: 501). In the process of appropriation rjkiy has undergone a change. The mask was taken over while the original gown was dropped and a different one provided by the palace.8 When rjkiy comes out, either for a palace cele- bration or when it goes to a private compound for the burial of a member, it is always accompanied by wel s ndds, a fully initiated member beating the small hand drum called ndos. The man, bare to the 7 The ykiy mask can clearly be recognised as one of the masks of fdleygaij although it wears a different gown. 8 For a description of the ykiy mask and its gown see Argenti (1996:235). waist, holds the drum by a string with his left hand while beating it at intervals with a piece of the root of a fig tree or the tough, reddish inner part of a mature bamboo (keshishik). He keeps a safe dis- tance from the masquerade. It is said that even for an initiated member it is very dangerous to get into contact with the masquerade. According to some people to touch its gown means certain death. The rest of the accompanying members (rjgarjserjkiy) again keep a gap between themselves and the wel 9 ndds. When crossing a bridge, rjkiy always crosses first alone followed by wel 9 nd9s before the rest of the group. When rjkiy attends a burial it is given a cock (like mabu kwifon)' returning the following day (kechii 9byii) it is given a fowl, a calabash of wine and eydirj 9 keban (loaves of fufu on a tray made of spear grass [cyscri'). New members are initiated into rjkiy only when ndaa rjkiy is opened. It is opened when a Fon dies and the new Fon is initiated into rjkiy. Every new Fon must be initiated into rjkiy. Secondly, ndaa rjkiy is also opened at the request of the Fon which may be at any time. To become a member of rjkiy one first has to give njemte (ritual food), then nton 9mnduk (two calabashes of wine), two fowls, a tray of three loaves of fufu (eydirj 9 keban), five logs of firewood, 200 CFA in place of two cowry shells and 100 CFA to buy the right to enter ndaa rjkiy wearing shoes.9 After some time one is asked to bring two fowls referred to as rjgv9se ketuu (fowls, head). Members who have given rjgv9se ketuu have the right to allow a strand of hair to grow long on the right side of the head (which is usually hidden under a cap). Any Oku man, irrespective of clan, can be initiated into chiaamfa (Faay Kerning). If somebody has been initiated into rjkiy he can enter sekse and nsum without further payments, but the reverse is not possible. Chiaamfa has eight masks: three bird masks, a vulture, another large bird, a bat, an ele- phant and a buffalo.10 Chiaamfa dances to a xy- lophone, two drums, a windpipe or flute (ke- furj) and the small hand drum (nd9s). Its impor- tance can be measured by the fact that it occu- pies the second place after f9lerjgarj, the most important masquerade of kwifon, and at death celebrations at the palace it dances immediate- ly after it. It is one of the characteristics of chiaamfa that it dances only for a very short 9 On the first occasion the candidate enters barefoot. 10 For an illustration of the chiaamfa masks see Koloss (2000: 252).

After having hardly started the dance, seeing the masks suddenly leave the dancing field, followed by the instrument players shouldering their instruments, is a strange and confusing sight for somebody who sees it for the first time. As to its organisation, the person regarded as ba omnkum (father, masquerade) of chiaamfa/gkiy is Faay Nkofon. The current Ba Ntok and Faay Bafon assist him. 2.2 Fenjii Fenjii dances as a group of over twenty maskers with feathered headdresses and sporting beautiful gowns made of the most expensive and prestigious cloths like kenlanlag or doma (royal or "Bikom cloth"), fenchii (satin, silk material smooth and shiny on one side), and kenfiyle. All these types of cloth are prerogatives of the Fon and the royal family (Mbele). Only the Fon has the right to give them as mbukmaa (gift) to other clans like Mbulum and abjarj. Shey Alfred Ngwiy offered the following ety- mology: "Fenjii is so called because it was seen as a rjkfdm12 who is greeted with or answered by 'n/n.' This masquerade was seen as a gkfom and given the respect due a gkfom. 'Njif is a greeting reserved for the 'big men' of the society. At that time the only 'big men' were the gkfdmse." When fenjii dances at the palace with the Fon as the kam (leader mask) he comes out from the Fon' s area of the palace while the other dancers come up from kechiale. If the Fon is not leading, Ba Ntok (the office holder at the time) dances with the leading mask. Fenjii is led by a masquerade called feyesewey said to have been introduced by Fon Ngek. It signals to the onlookers that fenjii is approaching. It wields a broom with which it pretends to sweep the dancing space for kam and to clean people's feet and it expects to be rewarded with a small gift. Feyesewey wears a skullcap decorated with cowries, a face- net and a short gown. It has no ankle rattles. One of the distinguishing features of fenjii is 11 Local etymology derives chiaamfa from chiaa kekaase which means "to pass through a cleared farm." It also means "passing without stopping or delaying" - chiaa ken cyyio eyyio. The name chiaamfa, therefore, describes the masquerade's brief dance "which is just like passing through the dancing space (obwey)" 12 rjkfdm is the original name in the Oku language ol a titled family head or "big man" now called Faay. that the pieces of its xylophone are made of camwood. Fenjii dances at the palace but it may also dance in any Mbele compound where an old death is celebrated with the exception of Mbele compounds that are still under the palace, e.g., the compound of Faay Chung in Keyon. When it dances at the palace its ntal (entertainment fee) is five fowls, five pots of wine (ntonse omnduk) and five trays of fufu (tedig d keban). When dancing in a compound away from the palace, it is given all the above mentioned plus two goats. One goat goes to the palace as the Fon' s share. Sometimes fowls are brought to the dancing area. A masker as well as members of the support group of the masquerade who get hold of a fowl can take it with them as their own share. There have been cases reported where two maskers have fought over a fowl and in the process torn the unfortunate fowl apart. 2.3 Laabe Laabe was originally a war juju. Similar mas- querades are found in the neighbouring kingdoms of Ake and Din. Before mfu and manjog were introduced in Oku, laabe was said to have been in charge of the war medicine. Laabe was used in war to confuse the enemy (Shey Alfred Ngwiy). Nowadays, when manjog fires guns, laabe still runs ahead. In praise of laabe "people shout Tarn wel balakr (Shoot the stranger!), because laabe and nontag chased strangers out of Oku and shot one at Chak village as they struggled to flee" (Faay Ndintonen). Laabe was originally owned by Faay Ndikon- sum of Kfam (Mbele). It is said to have been brought to the palace in the reign of Fon Mkong Ewuu (3rd in the king list), "because it had become too powerful and dangerous" (Koloss 2000: 191). The fact that initiation into laabe cannot take place in the palace in the absence of Faay Ndikon- sum or his representative, Nforme Ndula, sup- ports the claim that laabe was originally owned by Faay Ndikonsum. Further proof of this is that the last initiation into laabe, a few years ago, was done at Kum aykuy, the compound of Faay Ndikonsum and not at the palace (Sam Mentan). Similar to chiaamfa/gkiy, laabe, too, has a "running" juju. But it is "totally unlike gkiy in character, movements, dress and headdress. It is robed in a gown of human hair, with a faceless helmet-mask of long, thick dreadlocks tipped with Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="5">The Establishment of the Princes' Society in Oku, Cameroon 59 cowry shells" (Argenti 1996: 236). 13 Some people refer to it as a mask with a "Rasta"-like hairstyle decorated with cowries. Cowries are a prerogative of the Fon and the royal family. It carries three spears and a baton. Like ykiy it wears no ankle rattles. Its movements are erratic. It never walks but runs in short sprints. In the past it was used to punish wrongdoers with beatings. Even nowadays it brings down its hand in a heavy blow on crouching men, mostly initiated members, who somehow "feel honoured in the process of humiliation" (Argenti 1996: 236). The "running" mask attends funerals of all members of the royal family and it makes an appearance again on the second day, the day of celebration. Laabe also intervenes when a serious conflict erupts in a compound of the royal family (Mbele). Laabe is accompanied by an initiated member, usually of nchiy ndaa status, blowing a small wooden flute {see). During the reign of Fon Mkong Ndakoh (d. 1909) laabe was confiscated by kwifon following an incident involving its "running" juju. After the burial of Prince Kerning at Bow village, laabe did not return straight to the palace but entered the market which was being held on that day. In a wild frenzy it attacked people and wounded several of them. This action was considered very offensive, especially since fights are strictly forbidden in the market. Kwifon then dissolved laabe and confiscated its paraphernalia. After the death of Mkong Ndakoh, Ngek Zuelam succeeded. When he was taken into kwifon, he confessed that he had been the one who bore the mask of laabe during the incident at the market after the burial of Prince Kerning. Ngek Zuelam freely offered to pay a fine of five goats to kwifon. Kwifon then agreed to return the masquerade to the royal family under the condition that its "medicine men" were selected from members of laabe who were also members of kwifon (Koloss 2000: 191). The equipment of the runner mask is still in the custody and under the control of kwifon today but the costumes of the dancing laabe are said to be kept in ndaa gkiy in kechiale. Laabe dances at old death celebrations in the palace. It comes out in a group of about twen- ty maskers wearing feather headdresses. Its in- struments consist of two drums, two slit drums, and a flute (kefuij), but no xylophone. Some- times the Fon himself dances as leader (kam) of 13 Actually the gown is made of a type of sackcloth into which tiny patches of human hair are thickly inserted so that the cloth is completely covered with human hair. the masquerade at memorial celebrations. When he does, he wears a special headdress of white feathers resembling the special feather crown called fenon 9 mbor/ which a new Fon wears when he appears in public for the first time. As chiaamfa opens the activities of the royal mas- querades at palace celebrations, so laabe closes them. Initiation into laabe takes place about every four years. There are three grades. The third grade (laabe ntdk - laabe of the night) is associated with war medicine. "[It] honours the deceased King: during one of the nights following the official announcement of the King's death, it plays its 'terrifying' music" (Koloss 2000: 192). Before the ndaa emyin (house, gods) in the palace was furnished with a pan roof, the lead dancer of laabe would throw his spear into the thatch of the roof at the end of the dance at palace celebrations. This was called laabe torn njoy (laabe shoot moon), most probably because the spear was thrown upwards into the sky, i.e., in the direction of the moon. 2.4 Nsum Although a kekum a ntok, nsum is looked after and kept in Faay Chung's compound at Keyon. Shey Alfred Ngwiy insists that the compound of Faay Chung "is only a storehouse (eychiaa) for the masks because the gowns are kept in the palace."14 According to Faay Ndintonen, nsum was created by Chung who gave it to his father Fon Kerning. The Fon accepted it but indicated that it should be kept in Keyon, in Chung's compound. Koloss (2000: 255), in another version, states that nsum was founded by Fon Ngum Tayeah who then gave it to one of his brothers whose successor became Faay Chung of Keyon. Faay Chung, although living in his own compound in Keyon, has a special relationship with the palace in that he never really separated from it. Death celebrations of his family are still celebrated in the palace and not in his compound. Nsum is a masquerade of about 25 wooden masks. According to one informant (Faay Ndin- tonen) nsum and laabe are said to have similar medicines so that when one is initiated into laabe one has access to nsum. This is strongly denied by Nforme Ndula of Kfem. 14 One of the reasons given for this arrangement is that the masquerade cannot perform without the consent of the Fon. Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="6">60 Hermann Gufler and Njakoi John Bah 2.5 Beg Beg means rainy season. This royal masquerade dances as a group of more than 15 wooden masks, one among them with huge jaws called neya. Originally it is said to have been introduced by Fon Ngek. Nowadays, beg dances only in the palace. In the past it used to dance also in compounds of the obwey we saamba (the seven "great Lords" of Mbele), like that of Ndikentum, Ndishangong, Bainkong, and Ndifon of Lui. When bei) comes out, princesses accompany the dancers carrying food baskets (kelse) with corn flour which they gradually sprinkle on the ground. As the dancers leave the dancing ground, they sprinkle flour on the maskers until members of the support group collect the baskets with their content. It is quite obvious that we are dealing here with a symbol of fertility. One of the func- tions of the bei) masquerade is clearly the en- hancement of fertility, a good harvest, and plenty of food. At the beginning of the dance the leader mask {kam) leans its spear on the door of the ndaa eykuo (the house of the women's secret society fembien) where at royal death celebrations food is prepared for the kensoy eykuo. He collects it again when the masquerade is leaving the dancing field at the end of the dance. An interesting feature of the beg masquerade is the belief that each time beg dances, the weather must change as rain clouds appear in the sky even in the dry season. It is often compared with the performance of the omntiy rituals where one ritual is said to bring rain, another wind and yet another sun (Bah 2004: 447 f.) 2.6 Sekse This royal masquerade with its ten wooden masks is not kept at kechiale but by Mkong Taa, a prince, in Tinkong (Bow village). Similar to nsum, the wooden masks are kept in Tinkong but its costumes are in the palace. It seems that this is again a safety precaution, namely to prevent a prince or other members of the royal family from taking the masquerade for a celebration without the permission of the Fon. According to Koloss (2000:255) it was founded, like the nsum royal masquerade, by Fon Ngum Tayeah and entrusted to a member of the Mbele family whose successor is the present Babey Ndigham (of Bow). Sekse dances in the palace and in individual compounds. 2.7 Fentiy Fentiy means hailstone (pl. dmntiy) and is said to be indicative of the great number of maskers (about 30), "as numerous as hailstones." The distinguishing feature of this masquerade is that its leader mask (kam) wears a brass mask (eytian) and holds a walking stick in his hand (instead of the usual spear or cutlass).15 The walking stick of kam fentiy is decorated with beadwork. Its gown is made of fenchii cloth (satin). Only the Fon may dance with the brass mask. The brass mask is a symbol of greatness and wealth (Faay Ndintonen). Nowadays, fentiy dances only at the palace. In former times it used to dance also in individual compounds but before it would agree to do so the family head had to indicate that he had a young girl, a virgin, to give to the palace as Fon' s wife. "This was a very difficult condition, so people just turned their backs on fentiy" (Shey Alfred Ngwiy). 3 The Establishment of ijgele 3.1 The Introduction of shiorj Until 1947, the year when Fon Bi'fon I of Nso' died, Oku and Nso' were not on good terms. There was a long-standing unresolved problem between the two fraternal chiefdoms which is said to have arisen from the killing of an Oku woman in Nso'. It is difficult to get the exact details of what had happened since it is said to have taken place a very long time ago. Faay Kerning (5th October 2004) remembers the following story told to him while he was a nchiy ntok at the palace: "The Nso' had wronged Oku . . . There was a time when Nso' had planned 'war' against Oku. They got halfway to Oku where they entered the bush and spent the night lying in ambush. In the morning they discovered many of their people had died in their sleep without apparent cause. This led them to abandon the 'war' expedition. Later on they made a second attempt. When they were marching towards Oku they met a young woman called Kembong from Oku. She was on her way to Nso'. She was butchered. This brought much ill luck to the Nso' people because in warfare a woman is not killed." When the Oku people heard about this killing, they cut off all relations with the Nso'. 15 A masquerade with a brass mask exists also in Kom, Ake, and Din. Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="7">The Establishment of the Princes' Society in Oku, Cameroon 61 A similar story was told by Faay Manko but he linked the catching and killing of the girl with the death and burial of the Fon of Nso' which had happened at that time.16 After Sambum III17 (Sam III, alias Mbinglo, 1947-1972), had been installed, the two chief- doms decided to settle their problem. The Fon in Oku, at that time, was Ngum Yute (1940- 1956). Five Faay s of kebey ke saamba status from Oku18 and five senior Faays from Nso' were cho- sen to perform the reconciliation sacrifice called keman. Each chiefdom brought a goat. The keman was performed at the river separating Meluf from Tobin. "They called on their ancestors saying: 'Our fathers accept this sacrifice. We have finished the problem you have started'" (Faay Manko). After the ritual both parties took along part of the mix- ture of earth, medicinal leaves used in the rite, and some waste extracted from the stomachs of the goats sacrificed. This mixture was taken to the two respective palaces as a proof "that the keman had been carried out" (Faay Kerning). After settling their differences, the people of Nso' came to Oku for the celebration of the death of Fon Ngek Zuelam (d. 1940) and ggiri Nso ' took part. Since a princes' society did not yet exist in Oku, a place had to be found to accommodate ggiri Nso'. Kechiale, the princes' compound at the Lower Palace, was too small and it is said at that time only two houses existed there, one of which was ndaa gkiy (house of gkiy). So they evacuated all the people from Wamey's compound {dbchio eylag) which was situated opposite kwi- fon's compound and shielded it by placing bamboo mats all around it. ggiri Nsof stayed there for the duration of the celebration, ggiri Nso' came out to display in the palace courtyard (dbwey ntok) with shigwala and mbuh ggiri. These figures were not masked, "like the ggag masquerade in Nso'"19 (Faay Ndintonen). In 1948 ggiri Nso' had no wooden masks yet. Fon Ngum was greatly 16 In former times, it is said that in some chiefdoms at the death of a Fon a person was buried alive with him, for example, in Bum and Kom. One of the authors of this article (HG) was told that this was also the practice in Small Kimi (Kimi Petel), a fringe Tikar chiefdom east of Sabongari. But this seems not to have been the custom in Nso' and Oku. 17 Sambum III is said to be the son oí an Oku woman trom Ketongwang (Bow), of Ndingamkong's compound (Faay Manko). This could be the reason why he wanted to make peace with Oku on his accession to the throne. 18 These were Faay Baijong, Faay Kerning, Faay Ibal, Faay Chung, and Faay Ndifon. 19 They were not masked, because they had leaves ot the castor oil plant on their heads. disappointed that the masquerades of the princely society of Nso' should go around without helmet masks. Within a week of their departure he sent them a wooden mask20 which was similar to mabu gwerog. This did not go down well with gwerog, the regulatory society in Nso'. gwerog claimed that wooden masks were solely reserved for them. But since the mask was mbu 'mi (mbukmaa in the Oku language), that is a present or gift from the Fon of Oku, and the permission to wear it had been given by Fon Mbinglo, gwerog had to acquiesce (Mzeka 1980:110). In the same year (1948), about three or four months after the death celebration in Oku, the people of Oku went to Nso' to celebrate the death of Fon Bi'fon I (d. 1947). The Fon of Nso' had been surprised that Oku had no princes' society and he urged the Fon of Oku to start a society for the princes (ghon ntok) and male members of the royal family (Mbele). As a return gift for the shigwala mask Fon Mbinglo gave the Fon of Oku the ensemble of mbuh ggiri, a net-mask figure, including a cane with which this masquerade moved around, as a sign that he had given ggiri to Oku. This was the humble beginning of ggele, as the princes' society came to be called in Oku. But the Fon and princes of Oku did not just take over the mbuh ggiri masquerade. They adapted it to their own needs. The masquerade was equipped with a simple helmet (often referred to as a skullcap - gkàà) made out of cane which was covered with cloth and decorated with cowry shells. It was originally created by late Pa Bailak of Keyon. Fon Ngum is said to have donated an old gown of gkiy. The masquerade came to be known as shiog, also called fewan ggele (child of ggele). Originally, the Fon allowed the princes to have one shiog masquerade. But the princes found it necessary to add a second. The shiogse carried a long bamboo (obtotom) decorated like the walking sticks of the princes (ghon ntok) and a horsewhip. Until the beginning of the 1970s the masquerade of ggele consisted of only these two shiogse. One of the most important tasks of a shiog was to run ahead of the gkiy mask to warn people of its coming and to clear its path. Also, whenever the need arose, the masquerades were sent out to the different villages of Oku to rally members of the princes' society to come to work in the palace or in kechiale, their headquarters. Finally, they were used to collect njangi money {ßbkaa ngwa) from those members who defaulted. The 20 Some people talk of two masks. Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="8">62 Hermann Gufler and Njakoi John Bah Fon had encouraged members to start a njangi (a type of credit and savings association) to save money so that they could help themselves and their families. It did not last long before the shiorj mas- querades acquired notoriety for being very violent. "When they appeared in a defaulter's compound, the person had to appease the masquerade with a fowl, else they would cut down banana stems and dump them into the fireside until the money owed was brought" (Faay Ndintonen). Some members of rjgele now try to play down the violent be- haviour of the shiorjse. "They were not used as a tool of oppression or punishment on defaulters. They were violent, yes, but just for fun." Accord- ing to Faay Manko of Ngashie, Fon Ngum had to intervene and stop the violent behaviour of the shiorjse. Outwardly there was only the new masquerade shiorj which showed that rjgele had come to Oku. But within the princes' compound, too, a number of things were already happening. Primarily rjgele was set up to bring the princes and other mem- bers of the royal family (Mbele) together. They started a njangi (kechil a ngwa) to save money to help themselves and their families. They met on a weekly basis to discuss matters concerning their new society and the royal family such as work in the palace or the princes' compound, death celebrations, etc. Some princes were sent to Nso' to get better acquainted with the organisation and running of the rjgiri society there. They were taking the lead from Nso'. Newcomers who want- ed to join the rjgele society had to be initiated. There were several grades one could be admitted to by paying the required entrance fees (ntarj), the highest of which was kebam d rjgele (bag of rjgele).21 The princes' compound (kebey rjgele, kechiale), too, saw a great improvement. Before the intro- duction of rjgele there was, according to several informants, only one house standing, namely ndaa rjkiy. In due time the members of rjgele put up two additional structures, viz. a large assembly hall (rjgay) and a house for shiorj. 3.2 The "Baijong Incident" The violent behaviour of the shiorjse was only the beginning of the problems Fon Ngum had with rjgele. The situation deteriorated after what we call the "Baijong incident." This happened after new 21 Fon Sentie, when still a prince, gave an earthenware pot as part of the ntay for his rjgele bag. wives were recruited for the Fon. New Fon' s wives are taken to the palace when they are still young girls where they are put in charge of older wives to be trained. According to Faay Manko there is no force exerted on families to give wives to the Fon. When a Fon gives out a princess in marriage, he has the right to receive a girl from that family years later. "Them go talk say this woman whe he dey so, na Fon be give you for first time, whether na Fon Yancho or Fon Mkong or Fon Ngek or Fon Kerning or who, then you take pikin for that family come put' m for palace" (Faay Manko, 31st August 2004). Among the new Fon' s wives recruited (yiose, literally "rubbed" with camwood) was the daughter of Baijong' s sister, from the family of Prince Ngek Fimle who was one of the princes accused of having committed adultery with Fon Ngek' s wives and who subsequently was exiled. He had settled in Vekovi, Nso' territory. It is said that this girl's grandmother, the mother of Prince Ngek Fimle, was a princess22 and so the Fon had a right to get a wife from that family as a replacement for the princess he had given. What the family, and especially Baijong, seems to have objected to, was that the girl was still too closely related to the Fon to be given to the Fon as wife (Seh Peter Kerning). When Baijong heard about this, he was furious. He is said to have loaded a gun and gone straight to the palace. He vowed to kill the Fon or any person who dared to prevent him from taking the girl away. Baijong took the girl unhindered, snatched the string of cowries from her head, and tore it to pieces before leaving for Vekovi. According to one account, before leaving he stepped on the palace veranda and shouted out the Fon' s name, "Ngum," adding that "if he [Fon] had no blood in him, he should come out and see if he would not see death" (Fon Ngum III; Nforme Ndula). Some time later, during a death celebration at the palace23 the Fon came out onto the palace veranda to present a fowl to r/kiy and the shiorj masquerade accompanying rjkiy came near to the Fon, cutlass in hand. Looking at its legs the Fon guessed that inside the shiorj masquerade was none other than Baijong, his personal enemy 22 The term wan ntok (prince, pl. ghon ntok) strictly refers to a son of the Fon (son of the leopard skin) but it is often used in a much wider sense. Male descendants of the Fon of the third and even fourth generation and sons of princesses may refer to themselves as ghon ntok. 23 According to Faay Ndishangong it was the occasion of Yute's, that is Fon Ngum' s mother's reburial in the tombs of the queens at which Faay Kerning of ayghok e Ntul officiated. Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="9">The Establishment of the Princes' Society in Oku, Cameroon 63 who had once vowed to kill him. That the Fon guessed correctly was confirmed by Faay Kerning. Faay Kerning was angered because the shioy (i.e., Baijong) had beaten him with its horsewhip for refusing to provide enough room for r/kiy. The Fon felt threatened and seemingly feared a conspiracy against him. Overcome by a sudden burst of anger the Fon turned round and disappeared through the bamboo door (abchio ntok) into the Inner Palace without presenting the fowl to ykiy. To add insult to injury, a nchiy ntok (palace retainer) is said to have taken an empty wine calabash, pretending that it was full of wine, and carried it down to kechiale, the princes' compound. The princes felt deeply insulted and vowed that for as long as the celebration lasted no kekum a ntok would participate. Faay Ndintonen recounts what happened next: Chiaamfa was the main masquerade at kechiale, sec- ond only to kwifon 's foleggay. Traditionally chiaamfa always dances straight after fdleygay when there is a celebration at the palace. The Fon waited the whole day in vain for the participation of the ghon ntok to start. Finally he sent messengers to Mbejiaame, Keyon, and abchio Nkaa, inviting the royal family heads (Mbele) of these compounds to the nchii dmyin (the house of the gods) for a meeting. When they had gathered, the Fon presented them with two big cocks, two trays of fufu (tedii) keban) and a jug of wine (nton emnduk). He apologised saying that he had overreacted and behaved in an irrational manner towards the princes because he had recognised Baijong, his personal enemy who had vowed to kill him, moving around as shiog even to the point of stepping on the palace veranda. Since the Fon had apologised and tio njio (spit guilt) the Mbele family heads relented. The gifts were conveyed to kechiale and the celebration went ahead (Faay Ndintonen, 1st November 2003). After this incident, according to one version of events, Fon Ngum banned shioy outright and with it the rjgele society in Oku (Koloss 2000: 267). At night, nchiy se ndaa (members of kwifon) were supposedly sent to kechiale to bring the parapher- nalia of the shioi) masquerade which were then burnt (Nforme Ndula of Kfam). Before his death (17th February 1956) Fon Ngum is said to have reaffirmed the ban by a ritual proclamation called ketef. But there is another version which states that Fon Ngum only boycotted and "totally rejected" the fledgling r/gele society but did not actually ban it. What he banned was the shiorj masquerade. From that day on shioi) no longer accompanied the gkiy masquerade. The princes ignored the Fon and continued on their own, without any support from the palace (Seh Peter Kerning). Sentie succeeded as Fon of Oku and was installed on 2nd May 1956. Before becoming Fon he was a member of ggele. It is said that the wine pot in the rjgele compound was given by him as ntar) kebam ne wen (gift required for his ijgele bag) when he was still a prince (Faay Ndishangong of Mbejiaame), but when he became Fon he seems to have given it the cold shoulder. It is not clear what caused this change of attitude towards the ggele society. One reason could be the legacy of prohibition or total rejection by Ngum Yute. "Sentie had good relationships with r/gele while a prince, but when he became Fon he took over the objections Fon Ngum had against ggele" (Faay Kerning). When the people of Nso' came to Oku to cel- ebrate the death of Fon Ngum Yute in 1956, ygiri Nso' took part. They were very disappointed that rjgele was still not functioning properly in Oku. They promised to help the princes to reestablish their society. Nso' s support to establish rjgele in Oku was deemed of utmost importance by the Mbele. The matter concerning the prospective Fon' s wife seized back from the palace by Baijong was finally settled during the reign of Fon Sentie. Pa Nforme Ndula and another person were sent to report the matter to the Fon of Nso' who agreed to approach Prince Ngek Fimle in Vekovi. The outcome was that the family concerned substituted another girl for the one removed from the palace. "Before Baijong died, he had already brought a replacement to the palace where he started with a ntarjgle as Fon Ngum was already dead. This happened during Fon Sentie Njia Tee's reign" (Faay Kerning). The new dbvii ntok (Fon' s wife) is reported to be still living in the palace today (2004) having delivered many children. The settlement of the Baijong issue removed some of the tension between rjgele and Fon Sentie. 3.3 The Beginning of "Disturbing Events and Unrest"24 In the meantime, rjgiri Nso' had been making great strides as regards reorganisation and increase of membership of their society. From the few references we have, it emerges that rjgiri Nso ' also had a turbulent, sometimes even violent history since its introduction at the beginning of the 20th century. "According to Mzeka [1980: 106 f.], Fon Mapiri (1907-10) promoted it and even used it 24 Koloss 2000: 266. Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="10">64 Hermann Gufler and Njakoi John Bah executively . . . Bi'fon I placed it under an interdict after a brawl with ngwerong in 1925, which occasioned the intervention of a British officer. This did not prevent a second brawl ten years later which led to the destruction of its compound and reorganization. Sam III is said to have favoured it despite tensions in 1958. There was a further affray in 1976" (Chem-Langhëë et al. 1985: 172). From its underdog position, ggiri Nso' has always been striving to catch up with gwerog, even to surpass it. Up to the 1940s, ggiri Nso' had no wooden masks. It was only in 1948 that shigwala she ggiri began to wear a mask similar to that of mabu gwerong, a gift from the Fon of Oku, as we have seen earlier. In 1958, yee ggiri (mother of ggiri) in Nso' still had no mask (other than a gowned and hooded figure) although it had a strong medicine (shiv) and musical instruments (Chem-Langhëë et al. 1985: 172). Then, in the 1960s, there was a proliferation of masks; ggiri Nso' created five new masquerades and modified the existing ones thus surpassing gwerog' s number by two. This development which must be seen in the light of competition between the two societies did not go unnoticed in Oku. The princes in Oku were determined to restart the ggele society. An opportunity presented itself during the death celebration of No Ntok Nenembang in October 1971. When one Fon' s mother died at Jiyane - it was No Ntok Nenembang - we had to make ggele well-equipped. You see, ggele in those days before 1971 was not all those things you see coming out like that. They were not. r/gele was only that shiog. So now in 1971, we saw that you cannot be calling something ggele, ggele, when it is not as ggele should be. So we had to bring in wan mabu and all these other things (Seh Peter Kerning, 2nd September 2004). For this celebration the princes of Oku bor- rowed two masks and gowns from ggiri Nso' in addition to their own ggele masks shiog and displayed them at the Fon' s palace. The two mas- querades were wan mabu and no ggele (yee ggiri in Nso'). ggiri Nso' also supplied them with the necessary musical instruments. This performance of ggele with its borrowed masquerades and music hit Oku like a bombshell. It took the people of Oku by surprise and caused panic amongst the members of kwifon. Kwifon feared competition. They told the princes that they did not want "two ngumba (i.e., kwifon societies) for country" (Faay Manko). They were especially incensed by the ggele music, seemingly because it sounded very much like kwiforis music, although according to Faay Ndintonen their music was quite distinct from that of kwifon. It seems that kwifon was afraid that ggele would soon be using ggemse (double bells). Shey Alfred Ngwiy admitted that it would have been difficult to distinguish the music played by kwifon at night and the one of ggele had ggele used ggemse. So they refrained from including ggemse in their inventory of musical instruments. So why this uproar and why this fierce opposi- tion to the "new look" of ggele in Oku? Several reasons have been brought forward. The intro- duction of the "radical" or "Nso' -type" ggele, as some people call it, was seen as a threat to the political order. It was viewed by many as foreign to Oku tradition and as a challenge to the existing powers in Oku, especially to the Fon and to kwi- fon. According to Faay Mbuh Yang Daniel, MP, Fon Sentie was afraid that "if ggele was given the go-ahead it would usurp the power of kwifon. Sentie saw kwifon as the only legitimate authority in Oku and anything with the slightest resemblance to it was not to be allowed in Oku because it would diminish the strength of kwifon. Sentie did not want to see his 'government' which is kwifon destroyed." Since it feared the power of the "new" ggele, kwifon forbade Mbele who were members of kwifon as well as ggele (ghel jiise se baa - people of two roads) to attend ggele (Pa Tantoh Mbungwa). It seems that one of the main reasons for discomfort amongst Oku people was the fact that it was a new thing. Kwifon, being a traditional and very conservative institution, was vehemently opposed to any new or modern addition to their respected tradition. It must also be said that the introduction of the "new" or "radical" ggele was sudden and abrupt. People did not know anything about it and still had to get used to it. This forceful appearance of ggele during the death celebration of No Ntok Nenembang at the palace had serious consequences. Fon Sentie had been forewarned that the ggele society was going to display their new ggele masks. He reported the matter to the administration in Kumbo and requested that police should be sent to monitor the situation. He was afraid that the appearance of the new ggele masks would cause public disorder. The administration complied and sent three police officers. The police arrived in Elak on Wednesday, 13th October 1971. They were Brigadier Lukong Evaristus and Constables Lunga Emmanuel and Moses Andongcho. On arrival at the Oku Palace they called the leaders of ggele and, in the presence of the Fon and parliamentarian Mbuh Yang Daniel, Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="11">The Establishment of the Princes' Society in Oku, Cameroon 65 warned them to refrain from dancing rjgele. De- spite having been warned, three rjgele masquerades - shiorj, wan mabu, and no rjgele - displayed at the palace on Thursday, 14th October 1971, led by one Paul Kukua (Ngong).25 Immediately the police arrested five rjgele leaders26 and took them to Kumbo. The princes were undeterred and "vowed that their plans to have rjgele established in Oku would never change and if rjgele was not allowed to exist, kwifon too would cease to exist" (Faay Ndintonen). The princes also reported the matter to the Fon of Nso' who pledged his continuous support for the rjgele society in Oku. He failed to understand why the Fon of Oku supported rjgiri in Nso' but not rjgele in Oku. On Monday, 18th October 1971, the five de- fendants appeared before the Magistrate's Court in Kumbo. The presiding judge was Magistrate T. E. Mbuagbaw. The rjgele leaders were charged with "perpetrating a disorder and thereby offend- ing against section R 369 (5) of the penal code." The defendants pleaded not guilty. The case was then adjourned to 3rd November 1971. Each de- fendant was "granted bail to the sum of 30,000 CFA and one surety each in like sum." When the case came up on Wednesday, 3rd November, the court called three prosecution wit- nesses, viz. Fon Sentie, Mbuh Yang Daniel (MP), and Brigadier Lukong Evaristus. After having lis- tened to their statements, the court found no evi- dence that the first four defendants perpetrated any disorder. Consequently, they were discharged but at the same time they were "bound over" to be of good behaviour or face imprisonment for three months. However, the fifth defendant, Paul Kukua Ngong, was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 3,000 CFA or one month I.H.L. (imprisonment with hard labour). The fact that the leaders of rjgele had to oppose their Fon and family members (Mbele) made them feel bad but they had vowed to fight to the bitter end. "While in court, we stood against Fon Sentie. He declared that of the four of us, two - Faay Ndishangong of Mbejiaame and Faay Ndintonen - were his 'fathers' and the other two his sons" (Faay Ndintonen). "Fon Sentie stood up in court to argue against rjgele. I, Faay Ndishangong of Mbejiaame, argued in favour of rjgele. In court, 25 Although Paul Kukua was of Oku origin (of Nkwa Bey in Ichim), he lived in Tadu and was thought by many to be of a different chiefdom (Nso'). In the court proceedings his name is given as Paul Ngong. 26 They were Faay Ndishangong of Mbejiaame, Faay Ndin- tonen, Shey Fonntameh, Jeremiah Ngum, and Paul Kukua. Sentie said that it was the entire Fondom that hated rjgele, not him. The Fon of Nso' had advised Sentie not to stand in court and talk against rjgele. I felt ashamed in court as questions were put to the Fon" (Faay Ndishangong of Mbejiaame, 12th October 2003). It is clear that the court case did not deter the rjgele society in the least. It made them even more determined to fight on. On 23rd November 1971, barely a month after they had been discharged, the four defendants were back in court. They were charged "for contempt of court by organising and practicing the functions of a juju called 'Ngiri' on 23rd November 1971 at Elak-Oku after having been 'bound over.'" After hearing the case, Mag- istrate T. E. Mbuagbaw gave the following judge- ment: "The four defendants were bound over to be of good behaviour on 3/11/71. The court did not bound them over not to practice the juju of 'Ngiri.' There is therefore no contempt of this honourable court. The four defendants are discharged" (Copy of Court Proceedings). Opposition to rjgele in Oku continued unabated and even intensified. The Fon and kwifon had the support of their then parliamentarian, Mbuh Yang Daniel. "As a Member of Parliament I followed the stand taken by the administration in the matter. Since the administration had taken the side of the Fon, I had no choice but to follow ... I did not see how I could support that such a 'thing' could go on in somebody's compound when the owner of that compound (the Fon) was vehemently against it ... My concern was the Fon' s security and the peace in Oku as a whole ... I was not interested in juju" (Faay Mbuh Yang Daniel, MP, 14th October 2004). It was a coincidence that the Federal Inspector of Administration, Mr. Ngo, came on a visit to Kumbo at that time. The purpose of his visit was to settle the question about where a new Subdivision should be created in Bui Division. The Fon of Oku supported by Mbuh Yang Daniel, MP, and a nchiy ndaa (member of kwifon) were in favour of creating Oku as a Subdivision. John Tata, the former parliamentarian who had recently been ousted by Mbuh Yang Daniel, decided to exploit the disagreement (between the new MP and rjgele) to his advantage. He allied himself with the Mbele and accused the parliamentarian of rejecting rjgele because he was a nchiy ndaa. The exparliamentarian and his followers supported Mr. Kilo of Nso' in his bid that Oku should form part of Jakiri Subdivision. Mr. Ngo, the Federal Inspector, for his part insisted that Oku must go to Jakiri. The princes, mixing up the rjgele issue with Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="12">66 Hermann Gufler and Njakoi John Bah local politics, said that as the Fon hated them they were going to support those who favoured Jakiri over Oku as the Subdivision. In a tit-for-tat move a delegation from Oku opposed to rjgele seized this opportunity to meet the Federal Inspector and in their report stated "that the princes in Oku had formed a party (meaning a 'political party') called rjgele" (Seh Peter Kerning). Just to mention the name "party" at that time of the one-party system was already a serious offence. As a result, the rjgele society in Oku was banned by the S.D.O. Bui Division on 18th March 1972. The princes were prohibited from meeting in eyshaa ntok - kechiale, their rjgele headquarters. The administration reasoned that to allow the princes' society to operate in the Fon' s palace would lead to "anarchy" since they would be operating against the will of the Fon (Faay Mbuh Yang Daniel). As a further escalation of the conflict, kwifon announced in the Oku Palace, on 29th August 1972, that Faay Ndishangong and Faay Ndintonen were "to leave this compound on exile." All these punitive measures were ignored by the members of rjgele and they continued their activi- ties at kechiale. In October 1973, the police came from Kumbo and raided the rjgele compound. They confiscated all their masks and musical instruments and arrested 28 members who were at the time in the rjgele compound. They were made to sit in front of the palace with all the paraphernalia taken from the rjgele compound before being taken to Kumbo. The ijgele compound was sealed off and declared out of bounds to all members of rjgele. When the matter came up in court, rjgele lost the case. The four leaders were sentenced to one month's imprisonment and the rest of the defendants were given a fine of 2,000 CFA each. The four leaders who had been taken to B amenda to start their prison sentence appealed. They hired lawyer Omar Sendze, a Nso' man. The legal fees amounted to 82,200 CFA. The money was raised by taxing every rjgele member in Oku at 500 CFA. The case was judged in the High Court at Bamenda on 14th Januaryl974. The court decided in rjgele's favour and declared the establishment of rjgele in Oku as rightful and lawful. However, there was an unfortunate twist to the story. According to Shey Fonntameh, Faay Ndintonen, one of the three defendants, refused to answer any questions in court. That is why his sentence of one month's imprisonment was upheld. While the other three defendants were released, Faay Ndintonen had to finish his prison term. Lawyer Sendze advised the members of the rjgele society to select a neutral venue for rjgele activities to go on, since they were not allowed to go back to their compound in the Oku Palace. So rjgele moved to Faay Ndintonen' s compound. They stayed there until the case end- ed. To the consternation of the rjgele society, the S.D.O. of Bui Division, Mr. Kisob, refused to lift the ban. There was stalemate once more. A dangerous incident then happened on March 2, 1979, when Faay Ndishangong of Mbejiaame decided "to bring ijgele back home." When Faay Mbejiaame went to Nso' to bring back ijgele, he did not inform the other three [leaders] because he had earlier advanced the idea and it had been refused. Before he left, he came to me to collect the ankle rattles (dmbuak) his son had kept with me. He told me that they were his and he would like to have them under his control. He did not reveal his intentions to me. He went to Kumbo to get permission to restart ijgele but was directed to go to Jakiri because Oku was then under Jakiri Subdivision. He went to Jakiri and asked for the subprefectorial decision reinstating rjgele. After acquiring the desired document, Faay Mbejiaame started off for Oku via Mvem, unmasked. He had the gown and the mask of yee rjgiri {no ijgele) in his bag. When he got to Simonkoh he masked himself. He was seen by Joseph Mbunda, a son of Fon Sentie, who ran to the palace to inform the Fon. A plan was concocted to stop the masquerade when it arrived (Faay Ndintonen, 1st November 2003). Faay Ndishangong of Mbejiaame continues to tell what happened next: At a certain time, the administration in Nso' said it would be good for ijgele to come back after winning its case in court. There were individuals in kwifon who found fault with ijgele but this was not a view shared by all. I was advised that the masquerade must come home as a masquerade to let Oku people know that it was back in its compound. When I came home, masked in no ijgele, I went right down to the kola nut trees besides ijgele' s compound. Then, all of a sudden, I found Mbunda, Lemba, and Jiongwa pursuing me. They told me to go with the mask to my own compound and not to the palace. Since the administration had advised that there should be no fight, I started to move back with my arms behind my neck. When we got to the old market (dbwey sag), very close to kwifon' s compound, one of them asked me if they had allowed me to carry the mask and gown home. They held me and took everything that was on me. Those things are still with kwifon today. But it was not the problem of kwifon because if you kill somebody and run into another person's compound, you are still the one liable for the killing (Faay Ndishangong of Mbejiaame, 12th October 2003). After Faay Ndishangong of Mbejiaame had been unmasked in public "he continued walking Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="13">The Establishment of the Princes' Society in Oku, Cameroon 67 with only his ankle rattles on, 'half-juju,' an abominable act in Oku and elsewhere in the Grassfields. He had already decided that he would walk around with the rattles on to disgrace the 'system' by revealing to the women what was behind the mask. He first went down to eyshaa ntok, g gelé9 s compound, but then decided to go home. He was stopped by a man called Bafon Yuwun who then removed the rattles from his ankles" (Faay Ndintonen). After this incident, the Fon informed the administration in Jakiri. The matter was taken before the Magistrate's Court at Jakiri. The rjgele society again hired the services of lawyer Sendze.27 This time the case backfired for the Fon and kwifon. The people who held Faay Ndishangong and unmasked him were charged and fined for unlawfully detaining him. As a postscript, a sad event has still to be recorded. Not long after Faay Ndishangong of Mbejiaame had been unmasked and walked around "half-juju" with only his ankle rattles on, he became mentally deranged and has remained so until today. Many people blame it on his insistence of bringing rjgele to Oku and on his disrespect for "tradition." To many people it was the logical outcome of having defied Fon and kwifon. Other people, however, question this by saying that many more people were involved in defying the Fon and kwifon but none of them has been affected except Faay Ndishangong. So there must be a different reason why he became mentally deranged. 3.4 The Intervention by the D.O. of Jakiri, Mr. Peter Oben, on Behalf of rjgele After the raid on the rjgele headquarters in the Lower Palace by the police in 1973, the princes abandoned the rjgele compound and continued their activities in Faay Ndintonen' s compound with the result that slowly their former place reverted to bush. This seemingly provoked the ancestors' wrath who began to haunt the place and "asked for an explanation." It is said that Fon Sentie then wrote to the Government pleading that the ban placed on rjgele be lifted so that the princes and members of rjgele could relaunch their activities at eyshaa ntok - kechiale. It was then that the Divisional Officer of Jakiri, Mr. Peter Oben, was sent to Oku to "physically" lift the ban (Faay Ndintonen). The princes had meanwhile 27 According to the receipts kept by Nforme Jacob Ngum, the total amount in legal fees paid to lawyer Sendze for three cases was 312,900 CFA. been able to convince the public at large of their progressive ideas and rjgele was now widely accepted by the people of Oku. So on September 18, 1982, the Divisional Officer of Jakiri, Mr. Peter Oben, called a meeting attended by all parties involved in the dispute - the Fon, kwifon, and rjgele. Crowds of ordinary people who did not belong to any of the parties also gathered at the palace to witness the outcome of the meeting. "The D.O. judged the case in a very clear way and solved the problem. At one point he told the members of kwifon that 'you cannot wear clothes and say that another person may not wear them, except the man has taken yours'" (Seh Peter Kerning). After the meeting, the D.O. went down to kechiale and inspected the compound. He did not find anything wrong with it and allowed the princes to reoccupy their compound again and hold their meetings there, rjgele was finally recognised as lawful after years of suspicion, slander, and hostility. It is somewhat perplexing that the ban placed on rjgele Oku by the S.D.O. of Bui Division on 18th March 1972 was never officially lifted in writing. It seems to have been done only verbally. Looking back at the whole affair one cannot but agree with Faay Kerning who said that "different S.D.O.s and D.O.s took different stands on the matter, some opposing it and some being in favour. This was one reason why the palaver went on for so long." One year after the reestablishment of rjgele in Oku, the princes' society joined kwifon and mfu of Oku to celebrate the death of the Fon of Nso', Nga' Bi'fon II (Dini Mofor) (d. 15th July 1983). The celebration was marred by a serious distur- bance caused by Fon Sentie and the kwifon of Oku. Fon Sentie is said to have sent news to the palace authorities in Nso' that the masquerades of rjgele Oku must not be allowed to perform. The ensuing quarrel almost got out of hand were it not for the timely intervention of the forces of law and order. The S.D.O. for Bui, Mr. Tabi Arampe, warned the leaders of rjgele "to put a stop to their activities making it clear that the ban on Ngiri ac- tivities in Oku was still in force."28 Some members of rjgele escaped and ran back to Oku the very same day. One can see that the reluctance of the admin- istration to formally raise the ban on rjgele was exploited by those who were still opposed to the existence of rjgele, especially Fon Sentie and some 28 Letter written by the Fon of Oku to the Governor of N. W. Province, dated 13th July 1984. Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="14">68 Hermann Gufler and Njakoi John Bah other influential people in Oku. Maybe it is un- fair to put all the blame on Fon Sentie. There is evidence that some unscrupulous elements had de- ceived him by taking advantage of his illiteracy to further their own cause. There is some significant correspondence between the Fon of Oku and the administration in Kumbo. On 13th July 1989, the 2nd Assistant Prefect of Kumbo, Mr. Chama Eki Thomas, sent a letter to the Fon of Oku inquiring whether there was any problem with the "Ngiri and Nwerong societies" in Oku. There were two letters in reply from the Fon of Oku, both stamped with the Fon' s stamp and thumb-printed by the Fon. One letter, dated 17th July 1989, stated that "both societies in Oku are doing fine and that there is no problem with the two societies and myself [i.e., the Fon]. Here in Oku the two societies are helping in the development of the palace." The second letter, same date, states that the "Ngiri society in Oku" was an illegal organisation force- fully introduced into Oku from Nso'. It had been banned on 18th March 1972 by the administration in Kumbo and the ban had never been lifted. The Ngiri society had brought a lot of confusion and problems to Oku and was challenging and provok- ing the recognised traditional authorities - Fon and kwifon. On 19th July 1989, the D.O. wrote back to the Fon asking him which one of the two letters was authentic. In reply the Fon "stated categorically" that he stands by the first letter and wishes to withdraw the second letter "which sounds very dirty." He promised to find out who wrote it "because the writer might have deceived me by presenting a different subject matter." We were unable to find out who was behind the plot but suspicion points to one particular person. One wonders whether this kind of intrigue was just an isolated incident or whether it did not happen more often. 4 The "New Look" of the Princes' Society (ggele) in Oku After D.O. Oben had given the go-ahead to the princes to reoccupy their headquarters in kechiale, the princes' society in Oku received a great boost and improved its image amongst the members of the royal family (Mbele) and the Oku population as a whole. The "radical" ggele was finally integrated into Oku tradition. Many members of the royal family, who were vehemently opposed to ggele before, now became ardent supporters. Its mem- bership increased vastly, although still very few princes (ghon ntok) participate in ggele activities. It is difficult to say why this should be so. One reason could be that, being "eligibles" (i.e., liable to become future Fons), they do not want to spoil their chances in the eyes of kwifon and palace officials. Now that the road was free, the ggele society wasted no time in catching up with ggiri Nso'. Shey Alfred Ngwiy, the son of Faay Chung of Keyon, an ardent supporter of ggele throughout its struggle against Fon and kwifon, was very instrumental in implementing the "new look" of ggele in Oku: "I have gone to all the ggiris in Bui Division and seen how things are done there. As a result I am able to advise members on the right order of things in ggele. As Shiey, I am one of those charged with the implementation of the laws." But ggele still had no masks. The first rjgele activities in Oku were carried out with masks and costumes borrowed from ggiri Nso'. Being a carver, Shey Alfred Ngwiy took it on himself to carve the ggiri masks he had seen in Nso'. He did not just copy them: "When I started to carve masks for ggele, I adapted those of ggiri Nso' to suit my own imagination. As a carver I tried to differentiate them in structure and look, both of mask and gown. I saw the masks in Nso' but when I was carving the design for Oku I always introduced little changes to differentiate." Shey Alfred carved five rjgele masks within a short time. He received no payment. Instead he was given the prestigious ggele title Shiey (Koloss 2000: 269). In what follows, we first discuss the organisa- tion of the ggele society as it functions today. Then we will describe the new masquerades adapted from ggiri Nso'. 4.1 The Organisation of the "New" rjgele The ggele society is open to all princes, and all males of the Mbele clan (royal family) irrespective of generation, and to sons of princesses married into Mbulum or objar) clans. In the past, immi- grants to Oku from other chiefdoms like the Nkem family were given Mbele status and thus qualified to become members of ggele. ggele members who later are recruited into kwifon can continue to go there. Such members who double as members of kwifon and ggele are called "people of two roads" (gheljiise se baa). The Fon will only send nchiyse ndaa (kwifon members) who are ghel jiise se baa to ggele. Palace retainers {nchiyse ntok) who "see" kwifon with a new Fon are such ghel jiise se baa. Unlike kwifon, where people are recruited to Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="15">The Establishment of the Princes' Society in Oku, Cameroon 69 become members, men of Mbele status enter ygele by right. The ygele society consists of different sec- tions or "houses." Newcomers must be initiated to become members of g gelé (y gay ygele). The minimum age is about ten years. Newcomers first enter ygay (assembly hall) which is the "house" of ygele dbjim (general ygele).29 "General rjgele" incorporates three masquerades, viz., mabu ygele (also called kwala), nokay, and shioy. These mas- querades seemingly have no levels or grades. New- comers are asked to bring one calabash of wine and firewood. If a member dies without having provided wine, no ygele masquerade will attend or participate in his funeral, while in ygay the neo- phytes are under scrutiny from senior members. When a newcomer has fulfilled his duties to ygay, he can now choose to enter any "house" he likes. This depends on his character (nchiinen, ndee) and his financial strength. What usually happens is that the neophyte indicates his desire as to which "house" he wants to enter before the leaders of that section will decide. Suitability is not determined by fenyak (divination). Each "house" has its laws and its leaders. If he has been accepted, he has to fulfil the conditions laid down. There seems to be one exception. To enter the house of wan mabu is not up to the individual to decide but one has to be selected. Each section or "house" has different levels or grades.30 Candidates who enter a "house" or section start giving ntay. For example, the ntay for the first level of wan mabu is two fowls, one pot of wine (i.e., two calabashes), and a tray of fufu {eydiy keban). When the candidate has completed these payments, he may wear the wan mabu costume. One can detect a certain hierarchy among the different sections. The lowest level is ygay with the three masquerades kwala, nokay, and shioy. Next up the ladder are the "big masks" - Nchiyke- baky Shimandze, Morifem, and Momum. They are of the same importance although each of them has a separate lodge. Moo Ntok, the section where the Fon would sit if eventually he enters ygele, seems to have a special status. Then there is wan mabu. The highest level is that of ndaa noygele, also called ndaa y gay se (house of initiates). The group that determines the policy in ygele is called the "the seven men" (wel we saamba). In 29 According to Faay Ndishangong, "wealthy individuals" go straight into ndaa noygele, the highest section. 30 Koloss (2000: 271-276) gives the different levels of each of the rjgele masquerades and what payments have to be given. reality there are more than seven. "The seven men" are members of the Big House {ndaa eyghaken) which incorporates no ygele.31 When a member dies he is replaced by any suitable candidate. The position is not hereditary. How can one distinguish between what consti- tutes the particular rights of the Mbele in general and what is special to ygele. It is the right of the members of the Mbele clan to wear clothes made of kenlaylay (Bikom cloth). They may dis- play spider symbols (ygam), double bells and human figures on stools, doorposts, central sup- porting poles (obkfos) or house supporting poles (dbtok). They have the right to build a roof over the entrance (kenchay) to their compound. Mbele can also be distinguished by their walking sticks (kedioy) which have special designs carved onto them. All of the above apply also to members of ygele since they are all of Mbele descent. So by what kind of special features can one recognise them? First of all, they can be distinguished by their titles {eyghel). There are several of them. The most common one is Shiey. Here one has to distinguish Shiey ntay from Shiey kebam. After providing wine in all the houses, one has to make special provisions to ygele so as to become a Shiey ntay. Shiey kebam is one who has been initiated into the highest level of ygele, i.e., no ygele. Another title one finds is Ta-ygele.32 He is the leader of a lodge or "house." The leader of the first "house" has the title Ta-ygay. Other distinguishing features are the follow- ing: - dbbom ygele {ygele cup): The drinking cups are calabash cups or cups carved out of wood with different markings for the different houses and even for the different levels of initiation into these houses. What is special are the symbols and marks incised or branded on the cups which may be arrows, shields, or rings, etc. Just by looking at a cup an initiated member knows at once to which house the owner of the cup belongs and which level he has already attained.33 The cups are linked to the protective and curative "medicine" of the different houses. Let us take the wan mabu section as an example. The first grade is called Hi ndaa (enter house). When a person has paid two fowls, two calabashes of wine, and fufu he may 31 According to one source they are Faay Ndishangong of Mbejiaame, Faay Ndintonen, Shey Fonntameh, Nforme Yonka Simon Babcy, Shey Alfred Ngwiy, Shey Tom Nsaichia, Tantoh Emmanuel, and Shey Mawoh. 32 Ta in Lamnso' means "father of." 33 This knowledge is not secret, but few non-rjgele would know the difference. Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="16">70 Hermann Gufler and Njakoi John Bah now wear the mask. The second grade is called ntay obbom (payment, cup). When the candidate has paid two fowls, a calabash of wine, and fufu he is allowed to own and drink from a special cup decorated with black rings. The third grade is called ntay kefu (payment, medicine). There are not many members who can easily afford this grade which is also called mabu we ghel buumok (nine member mabu). After completing payment of five goats, three cocks, five pots of wine, and five trays of fufu the candidate is incised with protective "medicine" against spear injuries. His drinking cup which as regards shape is very similar to the one in grade two. In addition to black rings it has also arrows facing in the opposite direction symbolising spears. The fourth grade is called wan mabu we saamba ghel (seven member mabu) for which the candidate has to provide two goats, one cock, and six calabashes of wine and a crate of beer (for those members who do not drink palm wine). Having completed this stage the person is given a medicine bag for his own use. Again, special symbols, in this case a shield pierced by a spear, are incised onto his drinking cup. It is not surprising that members of ygele lay such strong emphasis on "medicine." They claim that it was their "medicine" which helped them through all the trouble and animosity they faced from different quarters of the Oku society and the administration. - Kebam y gelé (y gele bag): members who are initiated into no ygele, the highest section of the princes' society, are given a special bag. The bag is made of white raffia fibres with stylized human effigies in black stitched into the side facing outwards. These people are known as Shiey kebam. - Kefol y gele (y gele cap): these are of two kinds, viz. kesaysay and yaa ygele. Kesaysay are knitted caps with black and white stripes and are worn by those who have obtained their kebam ygele (ygele bags), i.e., ygayse ygele. yaa ygele are worn by Sheys and members of no ygele. These caps also have black and white stripes. Their special feature is that they have studs around the top. It is forbidden to wear these caps in bars (off- licenses). Members caught inside a bar wearing these caps have to pay a fine. This prohibition does not apply to ndaa eykuo (death houses) or manjoy houses. - dbkuu 9 ygele (cutlass sheath): such cutlass sheaths are given to members of ygele as mbuk- maa. When the ygele compound (kebey ygele) was under construction those who supported the project in an exceptional way were rewarded (buk) in several ways. Some were given the title Shiey, others a ygele cap (kefol ygele) or a ygele cup (dbbom ygele), and others again a cutlass sheath (dbkuu 9 ygele). In ygele a son succeeds a father only as far as kebam d ygele is concerned. When a member who has a bag dies, the bag is reactivated (lumse) and given to the eldest son but only if he has interest in ygele or is a member of ygele already. Finally a word about women and ygele. Women connected to ygele are all female members of Mbele and daughters of Mbele mothers or of princesses married into other clans. According to Shey Alfred Ngwiy such women play a vital role in ygele but they do not enter the ygele premises. They have a place at the palace called ndaa f onion (also called ndaa Shieyse)34 where they meet. Like their male counterparts they meet on dbkwey. When ygele has news for the women, messengers are sent to ndaa fonlon. At death celebrations at the palace, the women prepare food for the men while the men provide meat for the women and their own share of the food. 4.2 The New ggele Masquerades As stated above, before the advent of ygele in Oku the masquerades of the Fon and the royal family (amnkum ma ntok) were kept either in kechiale (the princes' quarter), in the Fon' s section of the palace, or in the kwifon compound, or in individual compounds. This arrangement continues right up to the present. However, according to some ygele informants all omnkum mo ntok came under its um- brella. The masquerades in the ygele section of the palace are still distinguished as being dmnkum mo ntok or royal masquerades but now all "belong to ygele" and are controlled by the princes' society. Notwithstanding the opposition to ygele by some influential members of the royal family (Mbele), ygele is now widely identified with Mbele; "ygele belongs to Mbele and ygele is Mbele" (Shey Alfred Ngwiy). It is significant that at palace celebrations all the royal masquerades and those of ygele emerge from kechiale, the ygele compound (kebey ygele), even if their paraphernalia are kept elsewhere (e.g., laabe, nsum, and sekse). In the latter case the masks and costumes are taken to kechiale where the maskers dress before moving up to the dancing field (dbwey ntok) in the Upper Palace. 34 Shiey is also the title for female members of rjgele. Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="17">The Establishment of the Princes' Society in Oku, Cameroon 71 There are ten ijgele masquerades,35 including shiog. All of them are more or less imitations of g giri Nso': (1) Shiog, (2) Mabu g gele or Kwala, (3), Nokag, (4) Wan mabu, (5) Momum, (6) Morifem, (7) Nchiykebak, (8) Shimandze, (9) Moo Ntok, and (10) No ggele. All the masquer- ades of ggele are single masks. Except for no ggele, none wears ankle rattles. The "big masks" Momum, Morifem, Nchiykebak, Shimandze, Moo Ntok, and No ggele wear wooden masks, brightly painted with glossy oil paint, an innovation which does not go down well with some Oku tradition- alists. 4.2.1 Shiog We have already described this masquerade (see above). Instead of the two shiogse which existed up to the beginning of the 1970s there are now six, the reason being that more "big masks" have to be accompanied. The main role of the shiogse is to run ahead and forewarn onlookers of the imminent arrival of the "big masks" during their appearances at death celebrations and to coerce people to stoop or crouch down in reverence to the masks. Occasionally they are also used to convene members of ggele when an urgent meeting is called for. 4.2.2 Mabu ggele Mabu ggele, also called kwala (shigwala in Nso') is a masquerade which strongly resembles mabu kwifon in appearance and function and is the "running juju" of ggele. It wears a black flat wooden mask with anthropomorphic features at the top of the head and a voluminous gown thickly covered with dark hen feathers. It is said to have been made in Nso'. It carries three spears and a short club-like stick which it frequently, and dangerously, throws ahead of it. It is followed closely by a crowd of shouting boys who all crouch down as soon as it turns and approaches them. In one significant way it is different from mabu kwifon: it does not whistle. It appears at funerals and death celebrations of members of ggele and at palace celebrations for a No Ntok, Ba Ntok, or a Fon. In the latter case, when mabu kwifon comes 35 For a description of rjgele masks see Koloss (2000: 271 - 276). The descriptions are accompanied by beautiful il- lustrations. Argenti (1996:374-378) also describes rjgele masks, but mentions only 5 of them. to obwcy ntok to start a palace celebration, mabu ggele follows immediately. 4.2.3 Nokag (jester) ggele has only one single nokag unlike kwifon where there are usually more than twenty. Nokag ggele has an impressive outfit: his face, legs, and arms are thickly coated with kaolin. He wears a hood sparsely applied with scruffy looking white feathers pointing in all directions. A large banana leaf, with a split down the middle just big enough for his head to pass through, covers the shoulders and the upper part of the body. He wears breeches made of rags and other pieces of tattered cloth are tied to his waist with bits of string or vines. In his left hand he holds a large, rough looking calabash drinking cup to which bits of straw and feathers are tied. In his left hand he has a long raffia pole; the top of which is fringed out. Nokag ggele speaks in a falsetto voice, the language is said to be that of Kom. One of the youths accompanying him interprets what he says. He demands small gifts from petty traders and market women who sell their wares along the road to the Palace and these he puts into a large basket suspended from a pole and carried by two boys. The boys help themselves to bananas and other things from the basket when nokag is not looking and for this they are constantly beaten by nokag. In order to prevent them thieving, nokag sometimes makes the two boys who carry the basket stand back to back so that they cannot see the basket. 4.2.4 Wan mabu (child of mabu) This masquerade symbolizes the "new" ggele. The masker wears a tightly fitting one-piece suit covered sparsely with white feathers and small round patches of red cloth. Only his hands and feet, coated with kaolin, are visible. Since the persons wearing the suit may be of different sizes, wan mabu has several suits of different sizes. The various colours and/or designs have nothing to do with the deceased person's rank in the lodge. Wan mabu carries three spears, a club and a shield painted with white lines and circles. The head is covered in a wig of thick strands of artificial, long, unkempt, bushy hair, some feathers, and a cowtail. The mouth protrudes in a snout-like extension which ends in a bright red circle. Wan mabu "is known for its wild antics and violent displays when it comes out" Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="18">72 Hermann Gufler and Njakoi John Bah (Argenti 1996: 376). It is a huge attraction and considered great fun when it appears. It does not inspire fear. Wan mabu is accompanied by two or three shioyse and a number of bare-chested young men wearing loincloths. They have stripes of red camwood or white kaolin painted on their chest or back "in patterns according to their levels in the ranking system of the acolytes of wan mabu" (Argenti 1996: 376). Two of them hold a rope between them which they use to control the unpredictable and sudden movements of wan mabu, usually with little success. Another holds a large calabash cup in his hand filled with palm wine. Every now and then he takes a sip from the cup and sprays a fine mist in the direction of the masker. 4.2.5 Momum Momum is a Janus-faced mask. Shey Alfred Ngwiy who carved the mask gives the following explana- tion: "Mö means Prince and mum is the Oku name for Bamum. So Momum means Prince of Bamum ... In Bamum there is a picture of a snake with two heads. So the idea to give the mask two faces was taken from there. The mask has two faces like the Bamum snake." What is implied here is a relationship with ngiirri, the princes' society in Bamum. The top of the mask is a crown formed by four child figures holding hands. Another charac- teristic of this masquerade is that it wears a gown and trousers thickly covered with porcupine quills and red feathers. It has a walking stick (kedioy) and a ceremonial cutlass. When it comes out, it is accompanied by two or three shioyse and about ten men in loincloths wearing necklaces and ygele caps (kefol ygele) and wielding cutlasses in their right hands. Pressing the end of the sheaths against their waist they hold the top part pointing away from their body, with the straps loosely hanging over the left shoulder. Momum moves in small graceful steps sometimes turning to clash its cut- lass against those of its followers. 4.2.6 Morifem The name of this mask means "Prince of Rifem," Rifem being the place where Nso' and Oku dy- nasties settled after their departure from "Tikari" (i.e., Kimi, present-day Bankim) and from where Oku later left to settle at its present location. As Momum indicates the relationship of Oku with Bamum, Morifem reflects their relationship with Nso'. The white-faced mask is depicted wearing a flat fooche cap (fooche tete). It wears a dark gown with trousers which are decorated with white buttons and cowries. Strands of wool are attached to the sleeves and bottoms of the trouser legs and also around the neck. As with the other "big masks," two or three shioyse and a good number of members of this house accompany the mask.36 4.2.7 Nchiykebak Nchiykebak literally means "guardian of the um- brella." There is no obvious connection between the mask and its name in Oku. The confusion aris- es from the Lamnso' name of this mask which has been assimilated into the Oku language without regard to the meaning of the word. The name of the mask in Lamnso' is nshiykiba' "which is short for nshiylav ye kiba' This refers to a page who has actually served in the palace. The message is this: not only you, yweroy, serve and guard the Fon. We also do" (Mzeka 1980: 109). We see here more than a hint of defiance and arro- gance of the Nso' princes against ywerong. But there is no suggestion that this is also the case in Oku. The mask portrays a "big man" with a fooche cap. The face in bright red colour exhibits huge staring eyes with bushy eyebrows and a gaping mouth showing the upper row of teeth. A short scruffy looking beard is attached to the lower part of the face. The masker wears the mask right down over his face so that he can see through the open mouth rather than under the mask as is usually the case. Nchiykebak wears a red gown and trousers decorated with large triangles of coloured buttons which are red, white, blue, yellow, black, green, and transparent. Red feathers are attached to the end of its sleeves. As behoves a "big man" of the status of a Mbele Faay, Nchiykebak carries a kedioy (walking stick) with a carved human head. In his left hand he wields a ceremonial cutlass. The support group are ygele members of this particular section and two or three shioyse. 36 On 1st February 2005, at a death celebration for Faay Njobe (Mbele, d. 1994), a man from Oku who had settled in Buh (Nso') and died there, a new Morifem mask was displayed. In design the new mask is similar to the old one except for its colour which is a dark chestnut brown applied to the whole mask. It is interesting to note that at the said death celebration two new masks made their appearance, the second one being that of no ygele (see below). There seems to be a constant "updating" and improvement taking place. Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="19">The Establishment of the Princes' Society in Oku, Cameroon 73 4.2.8 Shimandze Shimandze: mandze is Lamnso' (Nso' language) and means courtyard. It is the owner of the compound - ntete bey (Shey Alfred Ngwiy). The mask is quite unlike its Nso' counterpart which has anthropomorphic features. The Oku mask depicts a ram with long curved horns, its tongue protruding through its open mouth. The masker wears a gown and trousers made of dark cloth and decorated with lines and patterns of small crosses of cowry shells. In his right hand he wields a cutlass. He walks in brisk steps, raising his knee high at every step. He never stands still except when he clashes his cutlass with one of the support group. 4.2.9 Moo Ntok (Prince of the Palace) This is the section where the Fon would sit if he eventually decided to enter rjgele. The mask is that of a human head with wide-open eyes. The mouth is open and shows the upper and lower row of teeth. Attached to the chin is a beard of straight white goat hair. On top of the head there is a long conical piece - one can hardly call it a cap - tapering off towards the top and ending in a crown of four child figures looking outward and holding hands. The masquerade wears a wide blouse of blue and white indigo resist dyed cloth (kenlarjlarj) with long sleeves and baggy trousers of the same material. Around the waist it wears a wide belt of otter skin. Two garland bands of brilliant red cloth, decorated with cowry shells in sets of three, cross its chest and back. The masquerade holds a ceremonial cutlass in its right hand. 4.2.10 No rjgele No rjgele (yee rjgiri in Lamnso') means "mother of rjgeleT It is the innermost section of the rjgele society and its most prestigious. Some call it the "executive house" of rjgele. In Nso' this masquerade (yee rjgiri), "which existed only in the mystical and musical (seven cowrie-decorated flutes) forms now has a displaying juju like that of rjwerorj" (Mzeka 1980: 109). This is the mask Faay Ndishangong attempted to bring "home" to kechiale on March 2, 1979, when he was unmasked and his gown and mask confiscated by kwifon. According to Shey Alfred Ngwiy, the carver, the mask at that time depicted a human head with a fooche cap. The present no rjgele mask, which now usually appears at palace celebrations, is said by some to depict a leopard (Argenti 1996: 378), but according to its carver, Shey Alfred Ngwiy, it represents a lion. The mask shows a fierce looking animal head with a gnarling snout, huge fangs, and a protruding tongue. It ends in a bushy mane which is a clear indication that it is a lion. Others liken it to the head of a monkey (baboon?). The mask is brightly painted with glossy oil paint. It is interesting to note that at present there are three no rjgele masks, viz. a fooche mask, a lion head, and an elephant head.37 No rjgele wears a long wide gown of kenlarjlarj (Bikom cloth) with a line of cowries down the front. It is the only rjgele mask that wears ankle rattles. In his right hand he has a long raffia staff. The top of the staff has two short rows of bamboo plates like "wings" and is topped by a feather. Five cowries are inserted into the staff between the wings on each side. In Nso' and Mbesa (formerly known as Mbesenaku), a small chiefdom to the west of Oku, such bamboo poles have the function of a kelarj (injunction stick). This is not the case in Oku where this kind of raffia staff may only be used by no rjgele. The no rjgele lodge has six grades. Its members are mainly titled Mbele family heads. Payment of two calabashes of wine, a crate of beer, and 5,000 CFA allows one to wear shoes inside the house. The second grade concerns the rjgele bag (kebam rjgele). After payment of a goat, two cocks, and two calabashes of palm wine the candidate is allowed to own and carry the rjgele bag. On payment of one fowl, a calabash of wine, and a tray of fufu one enters the third grade (tarj keghen) which concerns the medicine calabash. The next grade (tarj no rjgele) makes one a full member of no rjgele. The payment is heavy: five goats, ten calabashes of wine, one crate of beer, and 20,000 CFA. The fifth grade admits a member to the "night juju" with its special instruments of a fric- tion drum, two bull-roarers, and five pipes.38 The final grade called "warming the pepper of rjgele" 37 At the death celebration in Buh (Nso'), mentioned in footnote 36, a new no ijgele mask made its appearance, depicting a human face and wearing a fooche cap. It is covered with white, black, and red beadwork. The mask was carved by Shey Alfred Ngwiy and the beadwork was applied in Fumban. It is interesting to note that the new no ygele mask did not make its first appearance at the Oku Palace, a practice which is demanded of all other new masquerades. 38 In Nso' the instruments of yee rjgiri include seven cowrie- decorated flutes, two drones, a pedestal drum, and other percussive instruments (Mzeka 1980: 112). Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="20">74 Hermann Gufler and Njakoi John Bah is said to involve 15 goats, 50 calabashes of wine, and 50 trays of fufu. The appearance of no rjgele differs from the other "big masks" we described so far. At palace celebrations no rjgele comes out of kechiale in a solemn procession. It emerges from the rjgele com- pound and moves up through Tamfu's compound to the motor road coming down from the market. It follows the road alongside the kwifon compound and continues down to the mfu house. Opposite the mfu house it enters the palace courtyard {dbwcy ntok) and moves to the front of the veranda where the Fon usually appears to offer a fowl or wine to the kwifon or royal masquerades. When no rjgele passes the veranda the Fon is always con- spicuously absent. The procession moves back to the palace courtyard, crosses, and goes down to kechiale. The procession consists of more than thirty members of the no rjgele "house," wearing loincloths of kenlarjlarj, rjgele caps (kefol rjgele or rjaa rjgele), and bead necklaces. They hold long bamboo poles in their right hands and rjgele bags over their left shoulders. They move very slowly taking long steps, stopping after each step, and shouting out praise names or making provocative statements. One of the praise names {ßmnkfvsm) given to no rjgele is bvdldk (lion),39 king of ani- mals, a praise name usually reserved for the Fon. It is also called lum nyam (husband, animal) meaning "great animal." Some of the names are shouted out in Lamnso' .40 Some of the participants talk of their plight and how they have suffered before being initiated into no rjgele. One person might say that he had a herd of cattle but used all of the cows to pay his way into no rjgele. This is mainly done to show off (kewel). The procession is led by a man beating a double bell. He is followed by two senior rjgarjse rjgele, one holding a kediorj (walking stick) and the other a bamboo pole. The fourth in line is the no rjgele mask followed by a shiorj. Every now and then, the masker steps out of the line and turns around. At this the procession stops. In 39 This is another indication that the mask represents a lion. 40 E.g., yga menlaa (owner of fault). Shey Alfred Ngwiy gave the following explanation: "If anyone finds fault with it, he has started menlaa that will never end. It will in return find fault with the fault-finder. If you fail to show respect and you are caught, you will never go free, except you come back to plead for forgiveness; if you choose to show power, greater power will be shown you in return . . . When we say rjga menlaa we add in the Oku language that we key dmlaa e we yen dmlaa (if you look for dmlaa you will see it)." long measured steps he goes back along the line, both arms stretched out horizontally and sideways, until he reaches the end. Behind the last man he stops and sharply shakes his ankle rattles. Then he walks to the front along the other side of the line touching each of the stooping rjgele notables on the shoulder or head with his left hand. When he returns to his original position he again sharply shakes his ankle rattles twice in quick succession. This is the sign for the procession to move on again. This sequence is repeated over and over again until the procession enters kechiale. No instruments are used other than the double bell. No rjgele appears at palace death celebrations for a Fon, No Ntok, and Ba Ntok, but also in private compounds for death celebrations of members of no rjgele. 5 ggele as "Modern Tradition" in Oku Although rjgele had officially been recognised in Oku at the meeting with the D.O. of Jakiri, Mr. Peter Oben, on 18th September 1982, the rela- tionship between Fon Sentie and rjgele remained cool and uneasy until his death. He never brought himself to accept rjgele. Also many members of kwifon, interestingly including members of the royal family (Mbele), continued their opposition to rjgele. It is also true that many Mbele are keen to associate with kwifon rather than rjgele. In fact, according to Shey Alfred Ngwiy, Mbele form the majority in kwifon. Some informants attribute this preference to simple greed: "They want to go where there is plenty of food to eat." But there are others again "who long to join kwifon because it is there where Oku society is shaped" (toyse ndee eylak). The "radical" rjgele masks have also come in for criticism, especially from traditionalists and members of kwifon. They are viewed as an adul- teration of culture. Argenti notes some of the reasons why people are very much opposed to the new masks. Firstly, "rjgele masquerades are spoken of as new arrivals by non-rjgele members, who support their position that the society has no basis in Oku culture by pointing out how its masquerades do not obey the traditions of Oku . . . they come out on the wrong days during palace celebrations, the attendants to the masquerades follow them in fay's clothes and paraphernalia they are not entitled to, and the masquerades take liberties, such as stepping onto the palace ve- randa during their performances, something only mabu, the most powerful and feared masquerade Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="21">The Establishment of the Princes' Society in Oku, Cameroon 75 of kwifon is supposed to do"41 (Argenti 1996: 236). Secondly, the ygele masquerades are breaking "the secret rule that masks must never be coloured (apart from the minimal application of red cam- wood on the mouth and ears and white kaolin in the eye sockets)" (238). Innovations like using glossy oil paint to paint masks in brilliant colours are for many Oku people unacceptable. Thirdly, the "big masks" Morifem, Momum, Shimandze, Nchiykebak, and Moo Ntok appear in trousers. Could this be one of the reasons why many people detest them? Trousers are not part of the outfit of Oku traditional masquerades. There are only two traditional maskers - kediaysen and kekum a yio (masquerade snake) - that wear suits, which cover them completely with no skin showing, unlike wan mabu who wears a tight suit but with his hands and feet showing although heavily coated with kaolin. Fourthly, the ygele society blatantly flouts royal prerogatives like the use of porcupine quills and cowry shells. The gown and trousers of Momum, for example, are thickly covered with porcupine quills. Another criticism reported by Argenti is the fact that the support group of mabu ygele are young boys. This could be interpreted as a "rub- bishing" of the kwifon mabu whose followers are always senior nchiyse ndaa (members of kwifon) and palace retainers {nchiyse ntok). However, these criticisms are no longer widespread. Some of the criticisms are simply based on misunderstandings by Oku traditionalists. The attendants of the "great masks," for example, do not wear "fay's clothes." They may be similar to the traditional attire of a Faay but they are not the same. They wear ygele caps42; since they are members of the royal family they are allowed to wear loincloths of kenlaylay (Bikom cloth); their cutlass sheaths are those specially made for the ygele society (obkuu d ygele), etc. It has to be said that with time the situation has improved greatly. Both societies, kwifon and ygele, go on with their business as usual and when there is a celebration in the palace both participate actively. Kwifon has seen that the existence of ygele does not cause any threat. It seems that 41 This statement is incorrect. Not only mabu but also rjkok (kwifon masquerade) and rjkiy (royal masquerade) step onto the veranda to receive a fowl from the Fon. 42 The design of these rjgele caps is very similar to that of kwifon caps, so much so that for most of the people they appear the same. Yet there are subtle differences which distinguish them. The issue of the rjgele caps was another cause of friction between kwifon and rjgele. Kwifon wanted to confiscate their caps but rjgele members stood their ground. many young princes and members of Mbele find the "new" ygele attractive, especially the beauty of its masquerades. Far from being put off by the colourful new masks of ygele, they love them as they love ygele in general because of its more modern outlook (unlike the "conservative" kwifon). Mbele youths, especially those financially better off, see in ygele a chance to climb the social ladder. It is interesting to note the high proportion of educated men in the ranks of ygele. Kwifon recruits its members thus limiting access. There is no restriction for princes and members of Mbele to enter ygele. Many people see things now in a positive and much more optimistic way. Faay Ndishangong maintains that although the Fon does not partic- ipate in ygele activities he is on good terms with ygele. Another leading member of ygele, Faay Ndintonen, is of the opinion that "even if the Fon is not cooperating with ygele, it is only a matter of time. At times he invites the six leading members of ygele to the palace to appreciate their activities and claims that when he hears their music he rests assured that whatever enemy comes into Oku, he has nothing to fear." Similar claims are made as regards the rela- tionship between kwifon and ygele. Shey Alfred Ngwiy, the master carver of the new ygele mas- querades, says that at present both ygele and kwifon are on good terms. According to him, ygele does not compete and never has competed with kwifon for power. What is clear in the minds of all Oku people is that kwifon is "first." And in the words of Faay Wantong of Lui, "all Oku people belong to kwifon', ygele is only for a group of people, the Mbele." Some senior members of kwifon also try to play down the acrimony that existed between kwifon and ygele in the past. "Kwifon did not, at any time, take a stand on this issue of ygele, although the Mbele believe that it was kwifon rejecting them. Each time the matter was taken up to kwifon, kwifon always directed them to go back to their 'father,' the Fon" (Faay Manko). Faay Mentan maintains that "it was only the Fon who hated ygele and not directly kwifon. If kwifon showed signs of dissatisfaction, it was only in an attempt to sympathise with the Fon. If kwifon had hated ygele as such, it would not have survived." So what about the present Fon himself? What is his relationship with ygelel According to Faay Kerning, "it is difficult for the present Fon to give ygele the official go-ahead because of his predecessors' objections. What he seems to have achieved is that disputes are no longer there Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="22">76 Hermann Gufler and Njakoi John Bah and the enmity between ggele and non-ygele, especially nchiyse ndaa, has ended though this was not something of his making. It just happened to have come about during his reign." For late Pa Tantoh Mbungwa, both a member of kwifon and ygele, the problem goes deeper. He said that "the wrongs committed in the past by the Princes needed to be finished in a keman (a reconciliation sacrifice). But Fon Sentie did not bring himself to do it and the present Fon has not done so either." In an interview granted to us on 28th October 2004, Fon Ngum III said: "The present relationship between myself and ygele, I would say, is quite cordial. It is cordial because of the way I have handled it. I have taken my understanding from culture and from both the traditional beliefs and positions of the people of Oku and applied it to the issue." The Fon tried to make light of his support for ygele before becoming Fon. "People accused me of being part of it ... [In 1971, during the death celebration of No Ntok Nenembang] I was accused of being a member of ygele. Some people denounced me to the Fon that I was one of them, but I cleared it with the Fon." Yet it is quite clear that Fon Ngum III, when still a prince, was on the side of ggele and tried to mediate between Fon Sentie and ygele. "He wrote to Fon Sentie telling him that he, Sentie, cannot exist without his 'children.' When he became Fon in 1992, he took out the letter from the Fon' s files and showed it to elderly Mbele to reiterate his position in support of their cause" (Faay Ndintonen). Samuel Sakse, as Fon Ngum III was called before becoming Fon, also tried to mediate between the administration and ggele. He made great efforts "to bring some understanding between the group (ygele) and the Government, but failed." While the four leaders of ygele were in Bamenda waiting for their appeal to be heard in the High Court, it was Samuel Sakse who fed and looked after them. After the death of Fon Sentie (26th April 1992), Samuel Sakse was put on the throne. "The first few weeks as Fon, I got warnings from left and right about the ygele society and that, if I was not careful with them, if I ventured into that society, I would die ... But then I thought to myself that in Oku the position of all Oku people is that people and institutions have always been in two hands - kwifon and Fon. Since all of them belong to the Fon and kwifon, why should I make ygele an exception? All the jujus all over Oku are those of the Fon. Since the people and things belong to the Fon and kwifon, ygele can just be one of them . . . [Although] they are to me like all other institutions in the entire Fondom, they are special to me because their membership is drawn from the royal family. Because of this [family] relationship, I always see myself as part of it, but without prac- tising. I have never been to any of their 'houses'; I know nothing about the inner organisation of the institution. I know just what I see from the outside ... I have talked to the family members and have told them that I have no objection whatsoever to their operations, except they are contrary to the laws of Cameroon. If they create any problem in public, it will be their responsibility. I will let them be picked up, because I cannot start negotiating with people who are doing things which are unac- ceptable ... So that is just how it is. I am prepared to protect them from morning to evening. I would not like to see them harassed by anybody what- soever. I gave them 'water' and I have told them, "whatever you have, eat. If you have five goats, eat them. Bring nothing to the palace.43 Just that and nothing more. If you bring nothing to the palace, I am OK." The Fon is well aware that he has a dual relationship with ygele: firstly, his relationship with ygele as a princely society and, secondly, his family relationship to them as a father to his sons. This second relationship is more important to him. But he also realises the value of having the ygele society at his disposal: ". . . it is very instrumental; if you want to have a population to talk to or to carry out any function, you just inform them. Wan mabu and others will come out and within a few hours you'll have the population you need." Talking to the Fon one could notice straight- away that he likes the ygele society. "Honestly, I like it. I have no problem with it whatsoever." He does not see the ygele masquerades as an adulteration of Oku culture. On the contrary, he thinks that these masquerades are a "successful marriage between tradition and modernity." But he also knows that he cannot be as free as he would like to be with the ygele society. The legacy left to him by his father, Fon Ngum II, and his uncle, Fon Sentie, do not allow him a free hand yet. "I am resting on the warnings that had forbidden me from having anything to do with ygele . . . Since our fathers left this legacy it is not easy for me to cross over. If I can philosophise sufficiently 43 What the Fon seems to imply here is that he cannot accept any gift from ygele when they go out for a death celebration. When a royal masquerade, like chiaamfa, laabe, or fenjii, goes to celebrate the death of a member of the Mbele clan part of the ntal (entertainment fee) is given to the Fon. Anthropos 101.2006</page><page sequence="23">The Establishment of the Princes' Society in Oku, Cameroon 77 and build up a solid ground under my feet to be able to stand well, I will be in a better position to defend myself. By understanding the whole issue better, I hope that enmity can be cleared. I can even become totally part of the institution. That is something I have to study. For now they have their rights to go where they want to go, take their goats and eat, but they must not disturb public peace." The Fon is open-minded as regards the future. He even envisages the possibility of joining rjgele. "I know that if a day were to come when I would be in that 'house' down at kechiale, the drumming would bring the sky down. But it needs to be slowly." As for now, he does not visit the rjgele compound except when he goes there for a matter concerning rjkiy, the palace masquerade. He still has not given his blessing to rjgele (mak moo se rjgele) as he does for all other masquerades. The Fon still does not give a fowl or palm wine to any of the new rjgele masquerades when they appear at dbwey ntok during palace celebrations as he does to kwifon or palace masquerades. In fact, so far he has not given and still does not give anything to rjgele at all.44 However, rjgele has finally become integrated into Oku tradition. Some people draw a parallel with the introduction of the manjor). Manjor) was not original to Oku either. "Manjor) came to Oku during the reign of Fon Ngek (1909- 1940). It was considered 'treason' because it came from Nso' Kwifon did not accept it until after a long struggle. Now there are two or three manjor) houses in every village!" (Seh Peter Kerning, 2nd September 2004). Kwifon was as vehemently opposed to manjor) as it was to rjgele. With time, manjor) came to be accepted and integrated into Oku tradition so much so that it is now called the "right arm" of kwifonl It is interesting to note that Faay Mbuh Yang Daniel, the present Member of Parliament of Oku and Noni, is now once more a member of rjgele. "Since the present Fon accepted it, I saw that there was no problem again as it was during the reign of Fon Sentie. Now I am a member of rjgele because 44 This statement has to be modified in the light of what happened at the last palace celebration in March 2005 in memory of No Ntok Zuelam. We have it from reliable sources that the Fon did send palm wine down to kechiale, the rfgele compound. There are persistent rumours circulat- ing that in future palace celebrations in which ygele takes part, the Fon may give wine and food to the princes' society at kechiale, sanctioned by kwifon. Whether he will also give fowls to wan mabu and the "big masks" when they come to the palace veranda has to be seen. I was already initiated into it ... I'm planning to go there and provide wine (naay). In fact, I have already provided some wine for them when they stopped in my house on their way from Ichim" (Faay Mbuh Yang Daniel, 14th October 2004). In 2004, he also donated the sum of 100,000 CFA to r/gele "for their development" [of the princes' compound at kechiale]. The "new" rjgele in Oku is one example of how modern elements can become incorporated into tradition. Its structures and principles are def- initely traditional but they have been successfully combined with modern features to form a valid synthesis. "As 'modern tradition' in Oku rjgele gives impulses in both directions - tradition and modernity - and signals more than any other in- stitution in Oku that the two can be reconciled" (Krauß 1990: 30; our translation). It is significant that in the last few years another new masquerade has been created with masks painted in bright oil paints. This masquerade which also dances at palace celebrations has been formed by the "Kilum Mountain Project" and has many brightly coloured bird masks. In all other aspects this masquerade is typical of all Oku masquerades. We are deeply indebted to Ian Fowler for reading the final draft of this article and making useful suggestions.
