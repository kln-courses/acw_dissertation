<plain_text><page sequence="1">117 IN DEFENCE OF NATURAL AGENTS BY E. H. MADDEN AND R. HARRA In this paper we are concerned to examine the objections that might be brought from a traditional Humean position against contemporary theories of causality, based upon the conception of natural agency. These theories are now sufficiently well known for it to be unnecessary for us to present more than a summary of the main elements of the position. The main features of the position can be brought out in four major aspects of the theory :1 1. Causality is to be understood on the model of the operations of powerful particulars, such as magnets, falling stones, compressed gases, stressed metals and the like. The model for causal concepts thus shifts from the essentially inert items of the billiard ball paradigm, to the essentially active items of the set of paradigms listed above. The active models are protected from anthropomorphism because their further analysis involves the standard scientific move of seeking the basis of the operations of active entities in the workings of generative mechanisms, and not in quasi-inten- tional or other misleading conceptions. 2. The products of the operation of generative mechanisms in powerful particulars are both new states of affairs, that is new qualifications of existing entities, and new individuals. On the new view any change in the regular course of events, or in the usual structure of generated individuals, is not a mark of a future so unconstrained that any outcome of a given state of affairs is logically possible, but is open to scientific investigation and explana- tion. Such a change is referred to a change in the nature of the entities involved. Thus a drug which does not have its usual effect is not treated as a violator of the uniformity of nature, but is supposed to have changed its nature, that is, its chemical constitution, in some way. Causal necessity is to be understood as the modality embodied in the concept of what must happen when powerful particulars act in accordance with their natures. 3. Events are not seen on the new model as producing other events without intermediary. It is powerful particulars, especially in the form of generative mechanisms, that produce things, and they do this when stimulated by some environmental contingency, but sometimes all that is required is that the occasion for the manifestation of the powers of an individual be suitable. That is, a powerful particular may begin to act because it has been stimulated, or it may be that a powerful particular simply migrates into an environment which, apart from this incursion, is 1Cf.

MADDEN AND R. HARRE stable, and so finds suitable surroundings for the exercise of its powers. The former case is exemplified by the tinder which ignites when struck by lightning, the latter by the more common natural situation of the drifting thunder-cloud which floats into the neighbourhood of a mountain, with the result that lightning flashes between as the cloud discharges. The charged cloud is a powerful particular. 4. An important but subtle consequence of the adoption of the modern generative theory, of profound philosophical significance, is the fact that the generative theory forbids the application of causal concepts to situations in which changes of the natural set-up do not occur. It is this prohibition that disposes of the Humean version of the induction problem, since that problem is essentially based upon the idea that even unchanging and en- during set-ups can be conceived of as sequences of instantaneous time-slices, whose unchanging character requires explanation. It is seen to be as problem- atic that one instantaneous time-slice is succeeded by another exactly like it, as that in cases of change an event should be succeeded by an instantaneous time-slice which is of a kind with an effect usually expected. Both cases are equally problematic, since on the traditional Humean view any form of instantaneous time-slice can succeed any other, and that an identical time- slice or indeed any particular other succeeds any given one is equally problematic. But it should be clear that only if one is willing to accept the artificial time-slice instant as a specification of genuine events is there a problem. Only by that acceptance is it reasonable to proceed to the de- composition of a changeless persistence in existence of some set-up into a sequence of identical but now logically disjoint events. After the decom- position there is indeed a problem of the explanation of the identity of the events, but that problem only comes into being in the course of the de- composition. Since a persisting existent is not changing, there can be no question of the application of the generative causal conceptual system to it, and hence the question of the explanation of its persistence, in scientific terms, cannot be raised, since the concepts which would be required in order to raise it of such a set-up cannot be applied. In this contrast lies the real basis of the dispute between traditional Humean views of causality and modern generative theories. It is in the acceptance or rejection of the basic entity as the event-as-instantaneous- time-slice ontology that the ultimate distinction lies. We shall try to show in this paper how the standard criticisms which are levelled by Humeans against less traditional theories depend entirely upon that underlying meta- physical theory, and the doctrines in philosophical logic that derive from it, and stand or fall with it. We shall see, in passing, that the basis for the adoption of the traditional event-ontology is thin indeed, and rests in the end upon an epistemic atomism that has little to recommend it. There are a number of instructive criticisms that can be made against our view of causality. For the sake of convenience and order, these criticisms</page><page sequence="3">IN DEFENCE OF NATURAL AGENTS 119 can be divided into three types. First, there is the claim that the new theory is not really in conflict with the Humean view. It might be urged that the meaning of 'change in the regular course of events ', which is involved in our rebuttal of the Humean contention that knowledge of the future is never rationally constrained by information about the past, is different from Hume's 'change in the course of nature ' and that we are trading on the unjustified assumption that they are, in essentials, the same. Second, there is the reminder that there are other arguments against " causal necessity" in addition to the argument that "in principle " there can be no causal necessity, since the description of a particular type of natural set-up can be conjoined, it is argued, with a description of any logically possible out- come whatever, without contradiction or any other form of inconsistency. There is the epistemic argument to the effect that the original of the concept power can be found in no single impression, whether external or internal, and hence 'power' must refer to some aspect of the repetition of these events. Far more important to the contemporary Humean, however, is the argument that ' p is necessary' is materially equivalent to ' p is a priori ' and ' p is contingent' is materially equivalent to 'p is a posteriori ', from which it follows that scientific statements, not being known a priori, cannot be neces- sary, but rather, being known a posteriori, must be contingent. Third, there is the charge that the new concept of causal necessity encounters inherent difficulties of a kind that attended the old concepts of natural necessity, difficulties which the Humean conception was introduced to re- solve. (a) The nature of a thing is essentially a static characterization of it clearly related to the outmoded concepts of natural kind and nominal essence; (b) the concepts of power, capacity, and natures of things involve generalizations and hence already presuppose, what Hume denied, that there are grounds for extrapolation from the particular to the general; (c) even if matters of fact were necessarily related in the way envisaged in the new theory, we could never know that such a relation existed in any given case. It might be further argued that (d) there is no place to account for contingency in the schema which refers those events, states of affairs, etc., which are thought to be effects to the inevitable productive powers of the natures of active particulars. Finally, it could be urged, (e) the schema of explanation according to which the nature of the powerful particular in the appropriate circumstances produces or generates the effect amounts to the reification of an abstract term. These criticisms have the merit of going to the heart of the issue. They are impressive but can be rebutted. We will consider them in order. I Let us briefly recall our argument that is the target of the first criticism. We say that 'change in the course of nature ' might mean either that the nature of a particular remained the same while its powers and capacities</page><page sequence="4">120 E. H. MADDEN AND R. HARRE changed, or that the particular had lost all of its previous characteristics and retained only a dubious numerical identity derived from temporal continuity of the occupation of a place or continuous sequence of places. The first sense, we have claimed, is self-inconsistent while the second is irrelevant to the conclusion Hume wants to establish. It is simply self-inconsistent to say that the atomic structure of dynamite explains why it explodes when detonated and yet that this piece will not explode when properly detonated though the structure is of the proper sort-this would amount to saying that the nature of the particular involved both did and did not explain its power to explode. On the other hand, it is irrelevant to say that there is no necessary connection between the nature of the particular and its ex- ploding, since it is always possible for the stick of dynamite to turn into a stone. That there is no relation of necessity between the nature of the stone, detonation, and exploding scarcely shows that there is not one between the nature of dynamite, detonation, and exploding. Hence, Hume's argument that in principle any logically possible outcome of a set-up is physically possible, that is, that for the purposes of philosophy logical possibility and physical possibility coincide, is vitiated. In criticism, it is argued that we have given senses to 'change in the course of nature' not intended by Hume. His sense is that events have shown certain patterns of succession in the past, but it is always logically possible that these patterns will change in the future. Then his point is that the C part of this pattern and the E part cannot be related necessarily, since the possibility of this change shows that ' C and not E' is not self- contradictory. The criticism might take the following form. What you have done is to translate ' change in the course of nature ' into your own conceptual framework and show what it can mean there. Given these mean- ings in your own system, Hume's " in principle " argument collapses. But this fact does not show that it collapses within the Humean frame of reference. The beginning of the reply is to remind ourselves what the Humean means by 'event'. Events are not conceived in the ordinary sense as changes in a state of affairs but as time-slice instants. That there are no connections between events so conceived, whether the relation be co-existence or succession, is an implication of this ontology. Hume's in-principle argu- ment is really redundant in the context of this concept of event. But why accept such an ontology ? Such metaphysical atomism was taken to be a consequence of epistemic atomism, but we have learned from recent epistemo- logy that the latter does not entail the former at all. So even if we were to accept Hume's point of departure that the only things we are directly aware of are our own punctiform impressions (which, of course, scarcely any epistemologist would be willing to do nowadays), it would not follow that we cannot talk about events in the ordinary sense and about particulars that have explanatory natures. Once given the fact that we can talk legiti- mately about events in the ordinary sense and about particulars with explan-</page><page sequence="5">IN DEFENCE OF NATURAL AGENTS 121 atory natures, then Hume's in-principle argument is no longer redundant and becomes wholly relevant. But then we see that in fact it does not establish what it purports to establish, namely, that the possibility of a change in the course of nature demonstrates the impossibility of non-logical necessity. The question now becomes this : does the possibility of a change in the course of nature establish the independence of events in their ordinary sense ? Say the events are the scratching of a match (with a certain force, with oxygen present, and so on) and the exploding of the match into flame, with the former always preceding the latter. Now ' change in the course of nature' might simply mean that the usual succession of events went awry, that the match was struck with the same force, etc., but instead of bursting into flame it crumbled. But such a change is quite uncontroversial and would do nothing to establish Hume's conclusion of event-independence. This match was wet, perhaps, and its atomic nature changed; hence the change in behaviour. If it had dried off before being struck with force x it would have burst into flame. To establish Hume's thesis of the impossibility of non-logical necessity it would have to be shown that these events are con- ceptually independent of the natures of the particulars that explain why these events occur in succession, and this we have shown to be impossible because it is self-inconsistent to claim that a particular with an unchanged nature should produce an effect in given circumstances whose description would contradict the description of the usual outcome of exposing such a particular to such circumstances. And the only other sense of 'change in nature' possible where the explanatory nature of a particular is involved is irrelevant to Hume's conclusion. II The ever-present Humean argument-the backbone of the tradition-is that any connection which is necessarily true must be known to be so on a priori grounds. But clearly a priori knowledge of factual matters is im- possible, so there can be no necessary relationship between matters of fact. It follows that our view, like all other claims about natural necessity, must be false. Humeans usually assume the first premise and spend their time establish- ing the second.2 They argue that no matter how carefully a person examines the sensible qualities of a particular, if that particular be new to him, he will be unable to infer anything about its causes and effects. Suppose a person to be rational to a perfect degree, still he could not infer from the fluidity and transparency of water that it would suffocate him, or from the light and warmth of fire that it would incinerate him. Humeans then confidently draw their conclusion: there can be no necessary connections between matters of fact. 2Hume, Enquiries, ed. L. A. Selby-Bigge; 2nd edition (Oxford, 1936), p. 27.</page><page sequence="6">122 E. H. MADDEN AND R. HARRE Examination of the First Premise. Since the acceptability of the second premise is usually taken for granted, the best short way with the Humean argument must clearly be to bring out what is wrong with the first premise. It is not as difficult to do so as some people think. There are, of course, two ways in which this can be done, namely by breaking up the assumed material equivalence between ' p is necessary' and ' p is a priori ' on the one hand, and between ' p is contingent' and 'p is a posteriori ' on the other. (a) The break-up between 'p is necessary' and 'p is a priori ' can be accomplished by considering the case of the replacement of one explanation by another. The first one was accepted on a posteriori grounds, and the second one replaces it because there are new a posteriori grounds supporting it more strongly. But each one that is acceptable at a given time must describe natural necessities-be about natural kinds and their powers and capacities-if it is to be an explanation at all. Say that a person pulls the switch but that the light fails to go on. He may explain the deficiency by saying that the bulb is burnt out and perfectly well justify this explanation by the previous experience that burnt-out bulbs are most frequently the causes of light failure and the recollection that this bulb has been in the socket a long time. The bulb is replaced but there is still no light. He then guesses a blown fuse and checks the fuse box. Indeed, the proper fuse is burnt through and when it has been repaired the light goes on. Having discovered the correct explanation of the light failure he is able to remedy it. The crucial point is that a burnt-out bulb and a blown fuse are both perfectly good explanations when true, and, like all other possible explanations, they are about natural kinds, their powers, and their capacities, between which and some environmental event there is a necessary connection. To be sure, we decide which explanation is the correct one wholly on a posteriori grounds, but it does not follow that the natures of bulbs, fuses, electric currents and their powers and capacities are related wholly contingently. Given the con- ditions of a broken filament or fuse, and no substitutes for them, the present natures of the bulb and the circuit are inconsistent with the production of light-electric current and conductors having the natures they do. If either condition in fact existed but the bulb nevertheless lit, then either the bulb or fuse, or the electrical current, had magically changed into something else. The same of course could be said for any other explanation of why the bulb failed to light. If the natures of these particulars are to explain their powers and capacities, then there must be a relationship of necessity among them and environmental conditions-in short, there must be natural kinds in any world in which explanation is possible. (b) The break-up between 'p is contingent' and ' p is a posteriori ' can be accomplished by disclosing the confusion in Humean thought upon which the claim that they are equivalent rests. This confusion is a variation on the one everywhere present in Humean thought, namely, the confusion between the meaning of a proposition, on the one hand, and the grounds</page><page sequence="7">IN DEFENCE OF NATURAL AGENTS 123 we have for holding it, on the other. A straightforward form of this con- fusion would occur, e.g., were one to define 'fair sample' as 'sample which has been stratified, randomized, etc.' If the latter were genuinely the de- finiens of' fair sample,' then they could not be offered as reasons for asserting in any case that x is a fair sample. But clearly they are the reasons that back up such claims; hence they cannot be construed as a definiens. Clearly the definiens of' fair sample' is simply 'sample that reflects the same ratio as the whole population'. The variation on the meaning/ground confusion operative in the present case is a second-order one. In holding that all propositions known a posteriori must be contingent, the Humean is assuming that a proposition itself must be characterized by, or have its nature determined by, the way we come to know it to be true. But clearly the nature of a proposition-including whether it is contingent or necessary-like its meaning, is independent of the way the proposition comes to be believed or known to be true. I believe on good grounds that a burnt-out filament is why the light fails to go on. It has usually been the right explanation in the past, and the bulb has been in use a long time. My belief certainly is based on a posteriori grounds, and it is always possible that I am in error. My recollection may be faulty: perhaps the bulb was put in fairly recently, or another has been put in without my knowledge. But the always present dubitability of evidence does not carry over to the nature, characterization of, or meaning of the proposition itself. It is true that the proposition about the burnt-out light-bulb is believed to be true on a posteriori grounds, and it is logically possible that it is a mistake to believe it to be true; but these facts are utterly irrelevant to the necessity which the proposition itself presupposes if it is genuinely an explanation. The natures of electric current, bulbs, and fuses, and the environmental factors of burnt-out filaments and fuses, explain why lights fail to go on, and this explanatory relationship of natural necessity exists quite indepen- dently of how propositions concerning them come to be held true in a particular case. (c) There is another way of rejecting the Humean claim of equivalence, though it is developed within a framework of natural necessity different from the one presented here. This argument has the following form. If there are no necessary connec- tions between matters of fact, as the Humean claims, then no confirmation- instance adds any probability whatever to any inductive inference. One has to assume, then, enough necessary connections so that the possibility exists that any two properties are necessarily connected. Then evidence of a regularity is the first evidence which increases the chance that the proper- ties of a certain pair are necessarily connected. And: From this it is inferred deductively that the same data make more probable the claim that the same properties are always connected. There is then empirical support for claims for which there is also</page><page sequence="8">124 E. H. MADDEN AND R. HARRE empirical support that they are necessary. And there seems to be no non-empirical support for such claims. So if there are any physical necessities at all, they are a posteriori.3 This is the familiar point that not all ensembles of predicates are equally likely to be manifested in nature. To assume that they are is to base one's epistemology upon a metaphysical theory that the having of a property by an individual is to be construed as an event, and that this event is atomistic, that is, unconnected with any other event, including the having of any other property by the individual. But, of course, events are atomistic only if they are instantaneous time-slices, and the having of a property by an individual is certainly not such an event. Examination of the Second Premise. It will be recalled that the second premise of the Humean argument, which we acknowledged to be true, is that a priori knowledge of matters of fact is impossible. Our agreement, however, requires clarification. Hume is quite right in saying that no man, however profound he may be, is able to infer from the light and warmth of fire that it could consume him or from the fluidity and transparency of water that it would suffocate him. But these undisputed facts only prove that there is no way of inferring one unrelated property or characteristic of a particular from another. This result scarcely comes as a surprise. It is a truistic consequence of unrelatedness. Thus the second premise is, though true, seriously misleading. Of course, given only some of the sensible quali- ties of a material or thing one could not infer all the ways it would behave. But were we to know the nature of the material or thing (for instance the structure of its component atoms) we should certainly be able to make these inferences. Bacon had grasped this point, and it lay behind his insistence that scientific knowledge must be found in the forms or natures of things, not in mere concomitances of their sensible qualities. As he pointed out in the example of fire, which produces induration in clay, but colliquescence in wax, the concomitances of sensible qualities may often be equivocal. The job of the scientist, he contended, is to find what it is in the inner nature of fire and the things and materials it acts upon that explains these very different effects. If we know the nature of a particular that explains its properties, powers, and capacities and relates them to intelligible clusters, then we can indeed infer from some of the powers and properties of that particular to others via its essential nature. Indeed, if we are successful in establishing the nature of the particular that relates its separate powers and capacities, we are in a good position to infer a priori the existence of still other powers and dispositional properties. A priori elucidations of the natures of particulars appear plentifully in science, and when such elucidations do not check out experimentally it is not a single elucidation that is vitiated but a certain strand of the over-all model. The model by which the nature of 3Milton Fisk, "Are There Necessary Connections in Nature ? ", Philosophy of Science, 37 (1970), p. 390.</page><page sequence="9">IN DEFENCE OF NATURAL AGENTS 125 the relevant particulars is represented then has to be changed in some crucial respect. The important fact still remains, however, that in establishing the natures of things and materials initially we go inferentially from properties, powers, and capacities to a hypothesis of a specific nature that explains them, and that this backward procedure is a posteriori in nature, utilizing imaginative model-building and analogy. But this backward inferential procedure, it must be emphasized, enables us to choose a model for the nature that will be successful but does not affect the conceptual relationship between whatever nature is established and the powers and capacities it explains. There are usually competitive models of the nature of things and materials and that one is chosen which is successful in explaining the most powers and capacities of particulars and in leading to the discovery of hitherto unsuspected powers and capacities, and whose plausibility is guaranteed by the usual rational constraints on the imagination in model-building. Here is the a posteriori dimension of the scientific enterprise, and it is, of course, indispensable. But once we see that its role is to decide which con- ceptual framework in fact is explanatory in a given area we also see that it in no way interferes with the necessary relation between whatever nature is decided upon and the powers and capacities of particulars that that nature explains. Thus, while it is true that no man can infer the other properties and powers of an individual from those properties he currently knows it possesses, it is quite untrue that the ensemble of properties of an individual cannot be inferred a priori from a specification of its nature. What is a posteriori is that the individual which manifests some of the appropriate properties has that nature, and, of course, that the world contains individuals and materials of that specification. III We now turn to the charge that the concept of causal necessity assumed in this paper encounters problems even within its own sphere of application. (a) The nature of a particular, it might be argued, is essentially a static characterization of that particular, clearly related to the outmoded concepts of natural kind and nominal essence. We know from biology that naturally occurring species do not exhibit the constancy required by the concept of natural kind. Classifications turn out to be divisions that reflect some convenience of notation. We also know from alleged logical considerations that it is impossible to separate essential and non-essential properties of the members of classes, except on pragmatic grounds. What properties we characterize as essential reflects some practical purpose. But it is a misconception to suppose that the nature of a particular is a static characterization of it, which must remain constant through time. Nothing could be further from the truth. At any given time the nature of a particular explains the powers and capacities it can manifest, but these</page><page sequence="10">126 E. H. MADDEN AND R. HARRE powers and capacities themselves may change. This change, in turn, is explained by reference to a corresponding change in the nature of the entity involved. There is nothing static or unchanging implied by our character- ization of things in terms of their natures; indeed, the concept of a non- fundamental particular implies that it is capable of some degree of change in nature without loss of identity. To be sure, fundamental particulars are incapable of change, but this fact is irrelevant as far as the present criticism goes. Since they are constituted wholly by their powers, they have no addi- tional characterizing nature to change. It is true that the introduction of a concept of the " nature of a par- ticular" entails the acceptance of the concept of natural kinds, but it is false to suppose that the acceptance of the latter implies that classes must be constant. The modern biologist is claiming that there are no unchanging natural kinds, not that there are no natural kinds at all. Our claim is that the concepts of " nature " and " change in nature " capture the very sense of natural kind that the biologist has in mind. Let us consider this question more fully. A class or species of anything may be said to be arbitrary or conventional when the individuals composing it have only the characteristics in common which formed the basis of classification, while a class may be labelled real or fundamental when the individuals composing the class have a cluster of characteristics in common. Thus the class of individuals composed of people whose last names begin with the letters A to D is a conventional or arbitrary one, while the class of mammals is a real or fundamental one. Sometimes a second ingredient has been added to this characterization of a fundamental class, namely, that the individuals composing it exhibit precisely the same set of characteristics throughout time. This additional character of " natural kind " is precisely the one rejected by Darwin and all contemporary bio- logists. But their rejection of it does not mean they reject the concept of natural kind. They simply have a better characterization of it. For them it again refers to a group of individuals that have a cluster of characters in common at any given time, though these characters themselves are constantly changing. What really makes this collection a natural kind is that the mem- bers share a genetic, generative mechanism which, along with the nature of the environment, explains why the characters are held in common, and changes in which explain the changes in the ensemble of characters. Far from counting against our view, this concept of natural kind, which is, of course, the biologist's concept of genotype, can only be clearly understood within the framework of causal concepts we have been defending. Finally, it is a simple matter to reply to the criticism that the nature of a particular is equivalent to its nominal essence, and that it is impossible to separate properties into essential and non-essential ones except on practical grounds. Nominal essences are unchanging ensembles of properties that supposedly define a class. We have seen abundantly that the nature of a</page><page sequence="11">IN DEFENCE OF NATURAL AGENTS 127 particular is not to be described in terms of unchanging properties and hence is not involved with nominal essences except in so far as the properties by which we recognize a member of a species are held to follow from the real essences, or genetic make-up, of the individuals of that species. Moreover, natural kinds so interpreted are not determined by properties at all, but by causal, generative mechanisms held in common by members of the class. (b) The concepts of power, capacity, and the nature of a particular involve generalizations and hence already presuppose that there are grounds for extrapolation. But, it might be objected, whether or not extrapolations are justifiable is precisely the point at issue. That these concepts involve generalizations can easily be seen. When we say this stick of dynamite has the power to explode when detonated in virtue of its nature as dynamite, we are committing ourselves, by virtue of the nature-concept, to the notion of any and all sticks of dynamite exploding under some appropriate con- dition. The same generality holds true for capacity-statements also, because, as we have seen, they too are explained by use of the nature-concept. But if power- and capacity-statements involve generalizations and yet are crucial in arguing against the Humean thesis, then the whole argument must be circular. Or, better, it presupposes the point at issue. The question is whether generalizations or extrapolations are justified. It will not do to show they are by using concepts that include generalizations. The answer to this criticism is that the legitimacy of extrapolation need not be demonstrated in every ontology. The problem itself is a function of the Humean ontology. The assumption of the critic is that the problem of justifying generalizations is ontology-independent. This assumption is quite false. Only the Humean, beginning as he does with the concept of event- independence, has the problem of justifying the extrapolation of previous conjunctions of logically and physically independent events. Since this problem is a corollary of the Humean ontology, one has the right to interpret it not as a general problem but as a reductio, one among a number of others, of that ontology. There is no problem of extrapolation in a thing-ontology, though there is a problem of the correct identification of a thing. Among the Humean claims are these : all events are logically and physi- cally independent. If an event of any kind has happened, an event of any other kind could, in principle, succeed it. Since events are independent, laws of nature must be interpreted as describing the contingent patterns of their succession. The logical form of law-statements is the material con- ditional, though lawfulness is only adequately reflected by the embedded- ness of a proposition in a theory. Non-statistical explanation consists in deducing an explanandum from an explanans that contains general laws in a non-vacuous way and some of the non-logical terms of which have empirical content. These Humean views have led to numerous puzzles, and puzzles which many philosophers of science have vainly spent thirty years trying to solve.</page><page sequence="12">128 E. H. MADDEN AND R. HARRE If every event is independent of every other, the fact that two kinds have always gone together in the past is no sign that they will continue to do so in the future. So there is the problem of justifying inductive inference. Event-independence also makes it a problem how to distinguish causal from accidental sequences, scientific laws from enumerative generalizations, and subjunctive from indicative conditionals. Still worse, it raises the question of how instantial confirmation is ever possible, since positive instances, on logical grounds, can never confirm a universal proposition. To be sure, negative instances legitimately disconfirm, but to restrict all evidence in science to what falsifies does not square with actual scientific practice or intuition, nor within a purely Humean ontology may we reject those con- jectures we have falsified. They may start to come true tomorrow. Nicod's criterion, along with the concept of logical equivalence, also leads to various paradoxes. If a general statement G is confirmed by some instances, all statements logically equivalent to G are equally confirmed by these instances. Finding a green emerald confirms 'All emeralds are green ', but it turns out, contrary to intuition, that finding a red ruby confirms it equally well. This is so because 'All emeralds are green' is equivalent to 'All non-green things are non-emeralds ', and finding a red ruby confirms the latter and hence the former. Goodman's well-known paradox results from the conjunction of Nicod's criterion with the view that predicates which have the same instances have the same meaning, the latter view being fed by the Humean notion that predicates obtain their meaning by ostension of instances. These "problems " are not general ones at all but flow from Humean ontological assumptions and constitute reductiones of that ontology. Assum- ing that nothing in nature belongs together, show that certain things, unlike others, belong together!-this is the hopeless and in principle impossible task faced by the Humean. Moreover, this way of looking at science violates both the intuitions and actual practice of scientists. We need an alternative view that does reflect what science in fact is all about and hence avoids this host of artificial problems. The way out is to be found by developing an alternative to the underlying metaphysical assumption upon which the whole structure rests, an alternative, that is, to the time-slice event-ontology. (c) It might still be argued that even if the notion of causal necessity were acceptable, nothing could ever be known to be so related, since it is always logically possible to be mistaken whatever causal claim is made. The argument rests on the strategy of showing that since there is no intrinsic mark of validity for empirical propositions, which are always corrigible by future experience, they cannot at any given time be said to be known to be true. There may be good evidence that the poor adjustment of the auto- matic choke is the cause of the slow starting of the car, but then it turns out that the starting is still slow after readjusting the choke. Then there seems to be good reason for saying that dirty points are the cause of the slow starting. But it is still possible that this causal claim too is false, since</page><page sequence="13">IN DEFENCE OF NATURAL AGENTS 129 it differs in no intrinsic way from other propositions (like the one about the adjustment of the choke being the cause of the slow starting) which seemed to be true, and had evidence in their favour, but later turned out to be false. The argument still holds even if the car starts quickly after cleaning the points-the better starting was perhaps, after all, the result of using another brand of petrol that was more highly refined. The limit of the argu- ment is quickly reached-since it is logically possible that every causal claim is mistaken, it is impossible to say in any given case that we know that x causally necessitates y, whatever x and y may be. The argument does not purport to show that there are no causal necessities in the world but only that even if there are we cannot know this. The assumption of this argument, it is clear, is that 'knowing p' is equivalent to 'being able to demonstrate p '-a strong sense of 'know' which is presented as the only legitimate sense of the term, and that usually without argument. Numerous replies have been made to this strange insis- tence on the exclusive excellence of the strong sense of' know', but for our purposes it is almost sufficient to note that this argument has no special relevance to the context of natural necessity. It is a general philosophical issue that occurs in many contexts, and accepting the exclusive excellence of the strong sense leads to scepticism in all these contexts and ultimately to scepticism about the possibility of any knowledge except demonstrative inference. Thus the argument, as far as being a criticism of causal necessity is concerned, proves far too much. If accepted in this context it must be accepted in all others, the result being scepticism about any factual know- ledge claims whatever. It is certainly not our purpose here to present a complete answer to this classical issue, but it will be helpful to point in the direction where a correct and complete answer is to be found. The beginning of an adequate reply consists in pointing out that the possibility of being mistaken is no good reason for thinking one is mistaken. Any fundamental distinction, whether it be between veridical and illusory experiences, fair and biased samples, or natural necessities and accidental universals, presupposes a body of knowledge in which these distinctions themselves make sense. To call x illusory, biased, or accidental, and to call x veridical, fair, or causally necessary, all require positive reasons drawn from this frame of reference. A statement is called causally necessary, for example, when it provides an explanation within an accepted scientific frame of reference, and accidental when it either conflicts with the framework or finds no explanation there. The framework is presupposed for saying either that x is causally necessary or accidental, just as a framework is presupposed for saying either that x is fair or biased, or that x is illusory or veridical. Simply pointing out that it is logically possible to be mistaken leaves wholly open the question whether one is or not, just as simply pointing out that it is logically possible that one is correct would leave wholly open the question whether one is or not. One</page><page sequence="14">130 E. H. MADDEN AND R. IARRE fears one has been shown to be wrong in one's basic beliefs by the sceptic's argument, but one has only been shown that it is impossible to demonstrate their correctness. But we are reassured when we remember that a frame- work is presupposed for saying either that x is mistaken or is correct-and hence that the sceptic presupposes all that we care about in his argumentative demand for a demonstration. The historical Hume, it must be noted finally, can be interpreted in such a way that he is both an epistemic sceptic and yet draws back partially from this position by arguments similar to those above. According to this interpretation of Hume, he is only claiming that constant conjunction is all we perceive of the causal relation, not that this constitutes the ontological nature of the relation. Hume rejects the principle that "nothing exists but what is experienced " but concludes that what 'cause' might denote be- yond constant conjunction must for ever remain unknown. Although we ordinarily mean 'necessary connection' when we use the concept of causa- tion, and believe that such a connection has ontological status, neither the definition nor the belief can be justified by reason or experience. And yet, Hume says, just as one believes in the existence of the external world by instinct, so nature has seen fit to set up within one's thought-processes a habit or custom which impels one to accept causation as necessary. The reasonings concerning cause and effect thus are " more properly an art of the sensitive than of the cognitive part of our natures ". And though reason is unequal to the task of proving that the external world exists and that there are necessary connections between objects and events, still it is equally incapable of proving these things impossible. This, plus the fact that the instinct which compels us to believe these things is useful, shows that it would be foolhardy to believe otherwise. (d) The claim that our view has no place for contingency is clearly false in one way, since we have acknowledged, in fact insisted, that no framework exists necessarily, nor must the fundamental entities of the real world have the natures they do. The universe might have been constituted in any way whatever. What the critic presumably doubts is that we can account for contingency within the system of individuals that actually constitutes our universe. It is clearly necessary, then, to point out a few senses in which our view allows for contingency, though the discussion will not attempt to be complete. There are senses of contingency available other than the ones we specify. Clearly, if the individuals referred to above are time-slice- instants all is contingency and there is no necessity. On the other hand, if those individuals are enduring particulars with specific natures, it might be argued that whatever happens is necessary, and within the world there is no contingency. However, even within such a world there are occasions for the application of concepts of contingency. i. The causal necessity we advocate holds between the active natures of things, on the one hand, and their productions in appropriate circumstances,</page><page sequence="15">IN DEFENCE OF NATURAL AGENTS 131 on the other. We are not asserting the determinist thesis, though, since we are not claiming that every product has been produced by an entity whose nature is independent of that product; far from it. On the most fundamental level there are no natures independent of powers and liabilities, and in the case where the product is the actualization of a human power it is not clear yet whether a nature-and-circumstances explanation is always or only occasion- ally applicable. We are claiming that when we do have a case of the pro- ductive action of a nature the relation between the nature, circumstances and outcome is necessary. In short, nothing in the conceptual system we advocate rules out the appearance of the novel or the spontaneous. Indeed, natural science, while maintaining the powers/natures conceptual system in general, is ready without inconsistency to contemplate spontaneity in quantum mechanics, in cosmology, and in the sphere of human action. ii. The relation between natures and the circumstances of their manifesta- tion is not a necessary one, since the occurrence of particular circumstances is completely independent of the nature of any particular, in at least some cases. There are cases, however, when the circumstances and the nature do seem to require us to recognize some more than contingent bond. Such concepts as that of the " accident-prone person " are of this character. Such a person might be conceived as one who creates around himself the circumstances most favourable to the manifestation of his nature. However, the more usual rubric for explanation runs something like this: given the nature of the things involved and the circumstances, the outcome must occur, but from the natures of the particulars nothing follows about when the appropriate circumstances must occur. That is, the occasions of the manifestations of natures, and the stimuli to action which individuals experience, are environmental contingencies, and certainly do not follow, in the vast majority of cases, from the natures of the individuals involved. From the fact that dynamite must explode when detonated, we can infer nothing whatever about when, or even if, it will be detonated. The relation between natures and circumstances for their manifestation may be either a chance one, if only physical events are involved, or an intentional one, if contrivance is involved. The relation between the bridge with the rotten timbers and the tractor that goes over it is accidental. The tractor might have come ten minutes later and the bridge would have collapsed just the same. Or a truck might have come ten minutes earlier and the bridge col- lapsed then. Contriving to bring circumstances and particulars with the proper natures into conjunction is the human being's and animal's way of using the contingency that is everywhere to be found in nature for practical purposes. Since the relation between natures and circumstances is always either a chance or intentional one, and since neither allows for necessity, the relation between the two must be contingent. In the case of chance relations, a positive and negative contingency can be distinguished. The coming of the tractor was a positive factor accidentally</page><page sequence="16">132 E. H. MADDEN AND R. HARRE present and the collapse resulted. That the truck did not come ten minutes earlier so as to collapse the bridge then-just as likely an event in a farming community-was a negative factor accidentally absent and itself thereby a contingent factor in the outcome. All of the points made above, of course, could be illustrated by any explanation of a happening in terms of the things and circumstances which produced it. Nothing depends upon particular examples. (e) It should be clear by now that we have not reified an abstract term. 'Causal necessity' should not be conceived as an undefined descriptive phrase referring to an ontological tie that binds objects and events together. Causal necessity is not a force or power that has some existence of its own; it is forceful objects at work. There are not both things and causality in nature, but causally active things. In Sterling Lamprecht's words, Causality is a name for a certain quality of events; it is not a name for the agency behind the events. The agency is there, to be sure: it is the lava-flow, the medicine, the light rays, the mechanic's muscles, the tossing waves. There is no other " force ", there is no other cause, than just these specific things. But these things are forceful; they operate, they produce. And they are forceful and operate and produce in that specific way we call necessary. Causality names that kind of necessary operation.4 This point can be made quite vividly if we are willing to take the death of Charles I seriously. The executioner had a good eye, a strong arm, and a sharp axe, and he whacked off the King's head. Swinging the axe to make contact in just that way (necessarily) caused the King to lose his head. This necessity, however, was no ontological tie of an event-like character behind events that bound them together (could anything be further from the truth in this case ?). It lay rather in the concrete situation, in forceful objects at work : the swinging axe and the right angle of descent. And so it always is. Causal necessity is nothing in general; it is always reduced to some forceful object at work-the powers, natures, and capacities of which are discovered by the experiments of science and the experiences of daily life. And of course to begin to look at the processes of nature in this way is to abandon the ontology of time-slice-instants for an ontology of enduring particulars with powers; within that ontology events are ontologically linked, but then they are no longer fundamental.
