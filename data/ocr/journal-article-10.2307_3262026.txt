<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Gordis reviews the various theories that have been advanced regarding the structure and purport of this Megillah, - the allegorical, the cultic and the dramatic, and con- cludes that it forms an anthology of twenty-nine love lyrics which are to be understood literally and separately. One of them, 3 6-11, with its three references to Solomon, is a royal wedding hymn, and the remainder are characteristic 'aw,df, dialogues, plaints and praises of lovers. While this view avoids the difficulties of more elaborate inter- pretations of the book, it has to be admitted that the divisions between the poems will perhaps always be a matter of dispute; and it implies that the reason for the admission of the book to the canon was either a factitious allegorical value or its human appeal and popularity. The songs are dated by Gordis to the period between Solomon and the Persian period. While he is right in rejecting a Greek etymology for 1p'sN (3 9) it is not impossible that DmDI (4 13) may have reached the Levant before Achaemenid times. Again the reference to Tirzah (6 4) does not necessarily imply that Samaria had not yet become the capital, and the tradition reflected by the LXX suggests that the phrase was a stock simile for which the etymology of the name was partly responsible. Such reservations, however, do not so much contradict Gordis' dating as emphasize the consideration which he urges -"that folk songs often undergo many changes with time." Similarly what Gordis says about the language may require modification. (Incidentally in n. 68 the two relatives have been inadvertently interchanged.) "Aramaic influence" is still too lightly and indiscriminately invoked, and while some of the linguistic features may be better attested for Northern Palestine the references to Jerusalem and the south cannot be ignored. There is still room for a special study of the character of vernacular and spoken classical Hebrew, and the reviewer suspects that one result of such a study may well be to establish that some at least of the alleged "North Palestinianisms" of the Bible are general vernacular features which have resisted the normalizing influence of literary Jerusalemite Hebrew. A. M. HONEYMAN The Exegetical Method of the Greek Translator of the Book of Job, by Donald H. Gard. (Journal of Biblical Literature Monograph Series, Vol. VIII.) Philadelphia: Society of Biblical Literature, 1952. Pp. 107. $1.50. The preserved Hebrew text of the book of Job and its Old Greek (LXX) translation are frequently the despair of the textual critic. Time and again he asks himself: What does the Hebrew mean, and why does LXX differ from it? The doctoral dissertation under review is an attempt to answer this question. It is the author's conclusion that "Although it cannot be assumed that the translator set out to remove all anthropomorphisms, there are numerous examples which show that anti-anthropomorphisms enter into his theological pattern of exegesis" (p. 92). This conclusion, however, lacks justification. The author, unfortunately, did not prove it, but assumed it in advance, so that throughout his study he operated with a hypothesis which coincided with his conclusion! 251</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Thus, "In the first [but correct this to "second"] exchange of words between Satan and the Lord the Hebrew reads (M 1 9): 'Then the Satan [correct to "satan"; how can hadldtan be a personal name with the definite article?] answered Yahweh,'... The translator objected to Satan's answering the Lord directly. Accordingly he employs the preposition Evavrlov 'in the presence of'. . ." (pp. 27-28). It so happens, however, that precisely two verses preceding (Job 1 7), in the first exchange of words between the adversary and the Lord, the Septuagint had rendered the same Hebrew literally, Kal aTroKpLOeIs 6 6LatlOXOS roc Kvplq eITrev! In the face of this fact, Gard merely notes, "This tendency [to tone down offensive ideas] is not, however, universally carried out" (p. 27). But whence the justification of the term "theological tendency?" Why not simply permit the translator some variety in his style? The entire chapter (II) on "Anti-Anthropomorphisms" (pp. 32-46) is a gross mis- representation of the true character of the LXX of Job. According to Gard, the trans- lator of Job avoided the Hebrew for "eye(s) of God," and the like, as anthropomor- phisms, and he cites four instances of this: 15 5, 24 23, 25 5, 28 10 (pp. 32-34). Yet in point of fact, the Greek-Hebrew of 24 23 is too difficult for anyone to make offhand judgment on the absence in LXX of an equivalent for w"sn9hu2; and Gard's interpreta- tion of 28 10 depends on his arbitrary selection of the reading ,uov (viz., of Job) in GB as against avrov in other uncials.I And the argument of theology loses its force at once when it is noted that I' is rendered by "before" even in passages where God was not involved, e. g., in 18 3, 19 15. Gard asserts that the LXX translator objected "to the anthropomorphic expression ,rnt nns, of line 2 [in 11 5], and accordingly omits the line" (pp. 34-35). But couldn't the translator merely have paraphrased rnvip, just as he did, and so neatly too, in 23 12, mi.wat .'pdtaw / evTraX,UirovT avrov, where God too was involved, without resorting to so drastic an operation as complete excision? And how can one say that theology, and not simply style, was involved, when 'S fepatdayim (viz., Job) in 11 2 was rendered freely, but aptly, by 6 ev;XaXos? Indeed, let anyone examine every passage where the yad, pgh, n'Jdmdh, nepeS, r4a?, leb (lbadb), pdanm, zro"a', kap, and the like, occur, where God and mortal man are involved, and he will see readily enough for himself that no theo- logical bias whatever is involved when LXX renders freely. Clearly the question of anthropomorphism never entered the mind of the LXX translator, and has been implanted there only by his modern critics. The tendency to explain the differences between G and M as due to the theological bias of the translator sometimes reaches the ridiculous level where the translator is accused of "playing" with his Hebrew text. Thus on 20 15 "Out of his [the wicked's] belly God casts them up," Gard asserts (p. 26), "The translator wishes to avoid the crude figure of God's casting ill-gotten wealth from a man's belly, and so omits the name I Gard does not argue that the translator (mis)read ''y in his Hebrew Vorlage, but that he "merely wished to avoid the anthropomorphism of i'r 'his eye'.. . . [and] there- fore employed a simple trick [sic!] of translation, reading l as ' to obtain ''y 'mine eye' " (p. 34). It is astonishing how frequently Gard attributes this kind of "simple trick" to our translator. 252</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS of God by rendering 5i as a&amp;yyeXos 'an angel.'

And should not the oft-proposed emendation of ei olKLas airov into EK KoLXIXas avrov = M l13: have been cited here? The section on "The Concept of Death and the Character of Job" (pp. 85-88) has left out too much data, apart from the inadequacy of the treatment of the meager data cited, to be of value. If the author had made use of my article on "The Hebrew and Greek Texts of Job 14.12," JQR XXVIII [1937-38], pp. 57-68, he would have seen there (in n. 27) nine different instances cited for my assertion that the translator "reproduced in his translation most of the passages throughout the Book that denied resurrection"; this is not a case of interpretation or opinion, but of plain statistical fact. The author has an extensive bibliography, but many of the bibliographical items do not appear to have been used in the study proper. Thus it is misleading to assert that "Up to the time of Gehman's article in the Journal of Biblical Literature [Sept. 1949, 231-240] most LXX studies had been governed by the idea that a departure from a literal rendering of the Hebrew was due for the most part to the literary style of the translator or to a different Vorlage" (p. 93); the author should have known that much of G. Bickell's doctoral dissertation De Indole ac Ratione Versionis Alexandrinae in Interpretando Libro Jobi (Marburg, 1862) revolves about the theory that the translator rendered freely because of anthropomorphisms, anthropopathisms, and other theo- logical prejudices; that P. Dhorme in his commentary on Le livre de Job (Paris, 1926) frequently resorted to this explanation to "explain" G's divergences from M; that, indeed, several scholars have blamed the translator's theological bias for his failure to reproduce a number of passages which constitute part of the one-sixth of the Hebrew Job which was lacking in the LXX text of Origen's time. The same sort of thesis as Gard's appeared in 1943 on The Anti-Anthropomorphisms of the Greek Pentateuch (Princeton Oriental Texts, 10), and the present reviewer wrote a review of it which was probably the most detailed that it received anywhere (Crozer Quarterly, XXI [1944], 156-160). On the basis of some factual data the reviewer wrote there, "... In fine, all that enters into our problem is the question of style, of literary effect; all talk of an antianthropomorphic tendency is quite without foundation... What is involved is not theology, but stylism and intelligibility. . ." (157, 159). HARRY M. ORLINSKY The Zadokite Fragments and the Dead Sea Scrolls, by H. H. Rowley.
