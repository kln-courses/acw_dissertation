Cloth, ?3'25- PROFFESSOR CONACHER is known to students of Euripides as the author of a number of articles on particular plays. The present volume, which in- corporates material from some of these, covers all the extant dramas except the Rhesus. With rare exceptions (the LA. exodos, for example) Conacher accepts the texts in full as we have them. His discussion, augmented with extensive footnotes, ranges widely over the mass of Euripidean commentary which the twentieth century has produced. The general thesis which binds the book together is expressed in its sub-title. Aeschylus and Sophocles, as Conacher sees them, 'dramatized the essential element of freedom and necessity in tragedy by expressing a certain tension between the world of myth, with its fixed patterns of events indicative of some divine plan or order in the universe, and the individual will of the tragic hero'.</page><page sequence="2">346 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW Euripides, who never fully accepted the world of myth, had a different and more complex view of reality; and under pressure of this he 'was constantly inventing new forms in which to cast his varied perceptions of the sources of human tragedy'. His virtuosity in treatment of the traditional material should not be mistaken for uncertainty or confusion. Conacher's object is to explore this virtuosity, to show that despite the different levels of reality at which Euripides works, each play has a unity of purpose-to be seen, in most cases, in the treatment of a central character. Conacher is a firm believer in the tragic hero, and finds him (or her) in plays where others have doubted his existence. He has little use for the view that characterization may depend (in Miss Dale's phrase) on 'the rhetoric of the situation'. This line of thought results in a new grouping of the plays-not chrono- logical (dates and order are treated as minor issues), but according to their remoteness from the approach to myth in Aeschylus and Sophocles. Hence the seven parts into which the book is divided: Mythological Tragedy (Hippolytus, Bacchae, Heracles); Political Tragedy (Suppliants, Heracleidae); War and its Aftermath (Trojan Women, Hecuba, Andromache); Realistic Tragedy (Medea, Electra, Orestes); Tragidie Manqude (Phoenissae, I.A.); Romantic Tragedy (Ion, Helena, L.T.); Satyric (and Pro-Satyric?) Drama (Cyclops, Alcestis). But Conacher admits that these categories 'are more useful as critical scaffolding than as material for final statements about a poet's work'. 'Euripides, of all dramatists, concentrates most on the dramatic effects suited to each new theme and resists the generalizations thrust upon him by the commentators.' The discussion of individual plays contains many good things: the long note, for example, on o0o'g~ and other words in the Bacchae; or the discussion of the relationship between the two parts of the Hecuba, which sees in the charac- terization of Polyxena a paradigm of tragic d&amp;perI whereby the essential nature of the fall of Hecuba is made clear. It is when Conacher seeks most strongly to exemplify his thesis that one becomes doubtful. In the Hippolytus, we are told, Euripides deliberately presents Aphrodite with 'neo-Homeric primitivism' in order to 'impugn, by a sort of reductio ad absurdum, the old anthropomorphism'. In the Phoenissae, the 'overfulness' of which is intentional, he has planned 'a series of paradoxical confrontations of the world of myth and the "real" world of Euripidean drama. Since the treatment is to be non-tragic, the more of these ironic sequences, or rather, non sequiturs, the greater the variety which a dramatic virtuoso can work into his paradoxes. We need not, for example, be restricted to the dualism of "myth versus reality"; reality itself, in one passage, is to dis- solve into the artifical world of rhetoric.' Conacher's numerous statements of this sort raise the whole question of how Euripides (or any other playwright) is likely to have worked-the question of priorities in the study of drama. The poet's intellectual approach to his subject-matter is clearly important, and one may grant that it involves con- ceptions of reality at different levels. But is it credible that virtuoso treatment of the subtle interrelations between these levels, never understood again until the late twentieth century, was the determining factor according to which he consciously planned his plays? In Conacher's eyes Euripides is too often a thinker contriving expression of philosophical attitudes rather than a dramatist writing for an audience. What one misses in his account, as in so many others, is the theatre. He makes hardly any reference to the dramatist's problems in staging the plays, in bringing them within the theatre conventions of the time,</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 347 although this must surely have influenced their structure. Where he does mention their theatrical aspect, it is 'merely theatrical', necessarily minor and unimportant. Thus 'the most outrageous structural feature' of the Heracles, the sudden madness of the hero, is attributed to 'Euripides' destruction of the mythological cosmos erected by the other tragedians': no mention is made of the powerful dramatic impact of the sudden appearance of Iris and Lyssa above the palace roof. The structure of the Troades is explained as a 'rhythm of hope and desolation' through which the play progresses toward 'gradual recognition, on the part of Hecuba and her women, of the truth about the gods which the prologue has already expressed, by satiric implication, to the audience'. 'A mere sequence of disaster does not make a drama,' says Conacher. Not according to Aristotelian rules; but the piling of calamity on calamity in this play, centred on the figure of Hecuba, is effective theatre even for a modern audience, though they may have misunderstood the prologue and missed its implications about the gods. This simple fact must at least be put alongside Conacher's more subtle explanation in discussing the structure of the play. The jacket claims that this book offers an intelligent guide to the plays 'for all students of dramatic literature'. It seems doubtful whether those who know little or nothing of Euripides will find Conacher's account a satisfactory introduction. Too much knowledge is assumed, both of the plays themselves and of modern comment. Greek words and phrases are sometimes trans- literated but often left in the Greek alphabet: the Greekless reader will not find it easy going. But scholars who already have some acquaintance with Euripidean controversy will find much of value here, both as a review of past discussion and as a contribution towards better understanding of the plays.
