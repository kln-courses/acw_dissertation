<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Corporeal Body in Virtual Reality CRAIG D. MURRAY JUDITH SIXSMITH ABSTRACT This paper considers the experience of embodiment in current and (possible) future virtual reality applications. A phenomenological perspective is adopted to explore user em- bodiment in those virtual reality applications that both do and do not include a visual body (re)presentation (virtual body). Embodiment is viewed from the perspective of sensorial immer- sion, where issues of gender, race, and culture are all impli- cated. Accounts of "disrupted" bodies (for example, phantom limb and dissociation of the selffrom the body, paralysis, and ob- jectified bodies) are advanced in order to provide a context for understanding the ways in which embodiment in virtual reality environments may be instantiated. The explicit claim that vir- tual reality is an embodied experience and can facilitate the radical transfiguration of the body and its sensorial architecture is explored and evaluated. t is the purpose of this paper to unravel the nature of embodied experi- ence in virtual reality (VR). In other words, how is it that while we are physically sitting in a room at a computer terminal we can also be phe- nomenally embodied in virtual representations? In order for VR to be an embodied experience, we need to understand both sensorial issues i.e., to what extent the broad sensorium needs to be encapsulated in virtual reality experiences; and morphological issues, i.e., in what ways the plastic- ity of body boundaries are implicated in embodied virtual encounters. Previous research has been dominated by examinations of the role of the senses in virtual encounters (Biocca and Delaney 1995). However, there may be more to an understanding of embodiment in VR than simply how our senses are engaged. It is argued in this paper that the sensorial body is located within a sociocultural, gendered, and technological con- text, and that such contexts need to be taken into account. Moreover, it is Ethos 27(3):315-343. Copyright ? 1999, American Anthropological Association.</page><page sequence="2">316 ? ETHOS becoming clear that embodiment in VR may also necessitate a transfigu- ration of the body boundaries, such that the person sitting at the computer terminal can map his or her sense of corporeality directly onto repre- sented virtual forms. Currently, represented virtual forms can exist on a number of different levels: a disembodied virtual hand, full body repre- sentations, a lobster, or other animal and alien figures. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how both sensorial and mor- phological issues are implicated in embodiment in VR. In order to achieve this, a reconceptualization of human experience is needed that provides an understanding of how embodiment in VR is constituted (and may be grounded in culture, race, and gender) as well as an exposition of the mal- leability of body boundaries. It is argued here that a phenomenological approach is well suited to these aims. Within this paper we present a brief historical development of VR. This includes a consideration of VR's predominant optical nature. The disembodied discourses of VR are presented and countered by a consid- eration of the sensorial, gendered, and cultural embodiment that grounds VR experience. Following this, an exposition of the sensorial phenomenol- ogy of the body in physical and virtual environments is presented. This includes a discussion of how sensory experience links into artificial repre- sentations of the body (anthropomorphic representations) or other artifi- cial forms (polymorphic representations) in VR. This implicates the importance of artificial representations in engendering a sense of virtual embodiment. What is at issue here is: how far is it possible to relinquish a sense of being in the physical environment and replace this with a sense of sensorial and corporeal embodiment in artificial environments? In terms of corporeal embodiment in VR, this paper draws on research regarding disrupted bodies (bodies whose sensations, functions, and mor- phology have been transformed through limb loss, prosthesis use, and pa- ralysis; see Murphy 1987; Trieschmann 1988), to inform the extent to which the corporeal boundaries of the body are malleable and can extend into virtual reality. These examples are also used to provide analogies for experiences of embodiment in current generic VR applications in terms of the phantom and objectified body. Understanding how people come to experience real reconfigurations of their bodies gives us indications of the ways in which our embodied experiences of VR are manifested. DEVELOPMENT OF VIRTUAL REALITY Virtual reality denotes the use of three-dimensional computer graph- ics technology to generate artificial environments that afford real-time in- teraction and exploration. These are intended to give the user an impression of being present or immersed in a computer-generated world.</page><page sequence="3">The Corporeal Body in Virtual Reality ? 317 While virtual environments can be presented on desktop computer dis- plays, a sense of immersion is often promoted through the use of head mounted displays (HMDs). These can present stereo images and (infre- quently) sound, combined with haptic and vestibular displays, to create a perceptually encompassing computer environment. The HMD has been in use for over 40 years, initially for telepresence to remote real environments (via cameras), later developed by Sutherland (1965) to view computer-generated imagery. For example, it is now possi- ble to navigate around a virtual environment such as a computer-gener- ated cityscape (see Shaw 1998), in which people can cycle on an exercise bike wearing HMDs depicting textually based images of Amsterdam. Tracking systems monitor the movement of a person's head, so that, as he or she physically turns, so does the point of view in the virtual environ- ment. Most VR applications are dominated by HMDs, which are, therefore, primarily visual mediums. Very few systems have progressed beyond this, although peripherals exist through which sound, touch via datagloves, mo- tion via treadmills, and vestibular information via motion platforms can be experienced (see Biocca and Delaney 1995). Alongside increasing technological sophistication, the ways in which a user's body is represented has also evolved from a lack of pictorial rep- resentation, to an arrow (as hand), to the hand, and finally to full-body representations, normally in the form of block figures. So, the history of VR has been to input first the eyes and then the hand, while the rest of the body's sensorium and motorium has been neglected or considered periph- eral to the immediate aims of VR. OF OPTICAL TECHNOLOGIES, VIRTUAL REALITY, AND EMBODIMENT The reliance on visual information in the presentation of virtual worlds is not surprising, given that vision has long been regarded as the finest of the senses (seeing is believing). Indeed, it has been argued that insights acquired by science have been built upon knowledge provided by optical technologies, such as the telescope and microscope (Ihde 1990), reinforcing the view that the acquisition of knowledge is primarily a visual enterprise. In this sense, VR can be seen as a continuation of the Western scientific tradition. It is these elements that contribute to the dominance of the visual sense in VR. It is a more recent recognition that vision by itself is incomplete. Jonas (1970) highlights hearing and touch as two senses that complement and help sight achieve its full potential. In terms of VR, the complementarity of various senses has prompted the development of peripherals to capture and project the body in all its complexity into terminal reality (Bukatman 1993). Therefore, VR does not need to remain characterized by a disembodied</page><page sequence="4">318 ? ETHOS gaze-that is, a projection of our selves into an optic panorama. Flexible sensors and exoskeletal devices (re)create the body (or its parts, such as the hand) in virtual environments. The fiber-optic flexion sensors of the familiar dataglove, adapted to a fully instrumented body suit, enable the animation of a virtual body viewable via a HMD (Ellis 1995). In this sense, the development of virtual reality (VR) continues to evolve to greater heights of psychological, sensorial, and bodily immer- sion. By virtue of the fiber-optic flexion sensors of the familiar dataglove and the fully instrumented body suit, it is possible to reach beyond the limitations of vision. A "compelling" VR experience is created by "block- ing" sensory impressions from physical reality (Biocca and Levy 1995). The eyes, possibly the ears, the hands, and even the body, are enveloped by VR peripherals. Reminiscent of procedures associated with sensory deprivation, it is, in fact, a substitution of sensory information. From the dataglove to the body suit, VR technologies are becoming all-embodying, perhaps even re-embodying. They are becoming what Balsamo (1995:215; see also Murray 1996) calls "new technologies of corporeality." DIS-EMBODIMENT OR EMBODIMENT? Dominant discourses around virtual reality treat it as a disembodying medium. Such discourses talk of leaving the body behind at the computer terminal, of projecting a wandering mind into cyberspace. The body, the story goes, remains docked, immobile at the interface, while the mind wanders the pixelled delights of the computer programmers' creation. Bogard (1996), for example, contends that, while recognizing the transpar- ency of the virtual system (a feature which will be elaborated on within this paper), the "operator too" disappears, giving way to the disembodied traveler, the astral projectionist, the "interface, data cowboy" in cyber- space (1996:37). Narratives of mind/body splits abound in VR discourse. Penny (1993) argues that "virtual reality reinforces the Cartesian duality, replacing the experiential body with a body image [the virtual body], a creation of mind ..." (1993:20). Stone (1992) cautions us to avoid the "Cartesian trick" because, she argues, physicality is as important in cyberspace as it is in everyday environments. "No refigured virtual body," she warns, "no mat- ter how beautiful, will slow the death of a cyberpunk with AIDS. Even in the age of the technosocial subject, life is lived through bodies" (1992:113, emphasis added). Indeed, the body deserves recognition for its primacy in the VR encounter (see Hayles 1996). Our argument in this paper is in line with Stone's, that the experience of using VR is an embodied experience. However, this is not unproblematic, and the nature of embodiment needs to be understood.</page><page sequence="5">The Corporeal Body in Virtual Reality ? 319 The new technologies that constitute VR create the possibility of bod- ily immersion. As suggested earlier, there are comparisons here with stud- ies of embodiment under sensory deprivation (Seymour Fisher 1973). Fisher gives the example of a sensory deprivation study carried out by the psychiatrist John C. Lilly, who submerged himself in a tank of water, the temperature of which matched his body. As he floated in the tank, isolated from all light and sound, Lilly began to feel "merged and indistinguishable from all that surrounded him," unable to "distinguish where his body left off and the water began . ." (1973:22). With no sensory detail (including diminished proprioceptive and kinaesthetic frames of reference), Lilly's body boundaries became ambiguous. Even the temperature of his body no longer "framed" his body against the surrounding environmental tempera- ture. While we are not arguing that immersion in VR constitutes sensory deprivation, we are arguing that the condition in VR is a (partial) substi- tution of sensory information, and that deprivation of physical reality, as articulated by Biocca and Levy (1995), is an integral part of a "compelling" VR experience. The procedures associated with sensory deprivation and virtual im- mersion may function to destabilize the experiential boundaries of a per- son's body (see Riva 1998), thus partially freeing the phenomenal body from the experiential constraints of a person's physical presence in the real world.1 For example, Michael Heim (1995) describes his own percep- tual nausea following his VR immersion as "an acute form of body amne- sia" (1995:67). Heim entreats us to observe someone emerging from a VR system: "Watch their first hand movements. Invariably, the user stands in place a few moments ..., takes in the surroundings, and then pats torso and buttocks with their hands-as if to secure a firm landing and return presence in the primary body" (1995:68).2 All this is not to say that the mind is freed from the body, but that the experience of VR brings its em- bodiment with it. It does this through sensations that are linked almost inescapably to the virtual environment. Not only are bodies bounded within the sensations they receive, but they are also located in time and space. Early human development in- cludes a process of becoming embodied. We have a corporeal history, an evolutionary and ontological development. Along with our evolutionary corporeal history, the "passage of bodily time" and its concomitant expe- riential activity molds our embodiment (Zaner 1981). Maus (1992) recog- nized this when he argued that the body is our first and most natural technical object. Our clothes (think of how high heels shape "the gestalt of a walking body" [Falk 1995:96]) and techniques of the body work not only upon the body-object, but also upon the body-lived, producing our embodied experience.</page><page sequence="6">320 ? ETHOS Moreover, our evolutionary history includes the development of an upright posture. We encounter the world from the height at which our eyes are located in our bodies. By drawing on our evolutionary history, VR has allowed our embodied reality to map onto our embodied experiences in cyberspace. As Dennis Proffitt explains, the "point of projection" in VR is at standing height. The perspective offered to viewers mimics their expe- rience in the world, and viewers measure objects in the virtual environ- ments as they do in reality-that is, against their own bodies. "You turn your head and see a stool in the corner, it appears below your line of vision, making it appear shorter than you are" (Azar 1996:1, 25). SENSORIAL, GENDERED, AND CULTURAL EMBODIMENT IN VIRTUAL REALITY It was suggested earlier that dominant discourses surrounding virtual reality are predicated on the notion of a disembodied person. For example, one VR guru writes of having "everything amputated" within VR (Barlow 1990). Indeed, this mirrors the concerns of the social sciences, which have traditionally sought to explain human experience as disembodied phe- nomena. Here the body rarely informs our understanding of cultural and social processes. However, a movement within cultural theory argues strongly that the corporeal body is an integral part of human experience (Lock 1993; Scheper-Hughes and Lock 1987). We cannot understand who or what we are, or explicate lived experience, without reference to embodi- ment (Csordas 1990, 1994). This perspective has important implications for how we understand the embodied experience of VR, because that ex- perience is founded on our bodily senses, which transport us into virtual reality. However, not just our bodies are transported, but also our history and our social and cultural context. In terms of VR, there is clear evidence that people bring their everyday, real-world understandings and social experi- ences to new virtual encounters. For instance, a recent study (Murray, Bowers et al., in press) of how people navigate through a virtual cityscape, in which a computer allowed them to progress anywhere, found that they remained ground- and road-centered, avoiding obstacles such as buildings and trees. This indicates that people's experiences of VR are not purely cognitively oriented, but embodied. In real life, of course, one cannot travel through buildings and other objects. It is possible in cyberspace, but study participants rarely took advantage of this possibility. Thus, to walk along roads in cyberspace is to remain within the same embodied sociocul- tural patterns that exist in the real world. It is clear that experiencing virtual reality is always an embodied and cultural event. For instance, Csordas (1990, 1994) argues that the body is</page><page sequence="7">The Corporeal Body in Virtual Reality ? 321 the existential ground of culture and explicates this in his studies of relig- ious experiences. We interpret our experiences through our culturally constituted body. The very fact that VR has developed in an occular-cen- tric way might well be grounded in the fact that Western culture tends to emphasize vision above the other senses. As Howes and Classen (1991) have argued, other cultures do not always divide the sensorium in the same ways as Western cultures do. They give the example of the different sensory properties of blood. In North America the visual aspect of blood is paramount, whereas in South India the tactile dimension is emphasized, and in Japan it is the odor of the blood that takes precedence. Indeed, whereas the Western world works around a conception of five senses, themselves culturally constituted (see, for instance, Classen et al. 1994), other cultures have the capacity to recognize as many as 17 senses (Rivlin and Gravelle 1984). The point we want to make here is that if VR had been developed within a different cultural context, different aspects of our sen- sorial world might have been a more prominent feature of VR experience. Certainly, the artifacts of a culture (such as VR) embody the different sensorial emphases of its people (Howes and Classen 1991). In this sense, experience of VR is culturally constituted. We can extend this argument further by considering the gendered and ethnocentric nature of VR applications. Feminist cultural critics have writ- ten about the ways in which the body of white, Western males are in- scribed upon and within the technological apparatus and narratives of virtual environments (Balsamo 1993, 1995; Franck 1995; Hayles 1994, 1996, 1997; Stone 1992). We argue here that VR is a cultural and gendered space, and because of this, the potential of the embodied sensory experi- ence within it is prescribed by the confines of the predominantly white, Western, male world. If VR worlds had developed outside of the white, Western male model, which is predominantly visually based, they might have been configured very differently. For instance, one VR development that reflects a feminist understanding of the body is that of Char Davies. Her Osmose system is a virtual reality organized around a breathing mechanism rather than hand-held peripherals. Moving within this envi- ronment (an oceanscape) involves using a variety of breathing techniques, and, as such, brings into play a different sensory experience (Davies 1995). Clearly, this VR application has very different implications for experiences of embodiment, which are instantiated through the tactile-kinesthetic body (see Sheets-Johnstone 1988), rather than the purely visual one. Similarly, Bailey (1996) has written about the way in which racial issues are also embodied issues. In his article "Virtual Skin: Articulating Race in Cyberspace" he suggests that race matters in virtual experiences: The discourse of race is, by history and by design, rooted in the body. Cyber-subjec- tivity promises the fantasy of disembodied communication, but it remains firmly</page><page sequence="8">322 ? ETHOS connected to bodies through the imaginative act required to project into cyberspace. [Bailey 1996:42] When we enter VR, we bring our race with us just as we bring our bodies. In order to encompass a wider corporeal body experience in VR, then, it is necessary to take into account the different sensorial worlds of women and of people from various cultural and ethnic backgrounds. The problems of not doing this have been discussed by Hayles (1992) in rela- tion to how Freudian psychoanalysis and early 20th-century literature (such as the writings of D. H. Lawrence) stressed the vaginal orgasm. This had an impact upon how women experienced their embodiment. While some women attempted to make their experiences conform to the con- cept, others believed their experiences to be somehow defective because they did not meet the criteria. Still others remained skeptical because their experiences did not match the concept. Therefore, if VR develop- ment fails to include a more holistic approach to sensorial engagement, then it may alienate the bodily experiences of women and peoples of dif- ferent ethnic origins and cultural backgrounds. Our argument here is not simply that the experience of VR is an em- bodied one, but that it is simultaneously and inescapably a social, racial, ethnic, gendered, and cultural one. Thus, when we talk throughout this paper of embodiment as manifested through our senses in VR, we are al- ways concerned with understanding the sensorial aspects of that embodi- ment as well as ethnicity, gender, and culture. A SENSORIAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE BODY Having rejected Cartesian notions of a mind-body split, it is necessary to explicate in its place a sensorial phenomenology of the body. Phenome- nology has proved to be a method well-suited to exploring the experience of embodiment because it is fundamentally concerned with perception and bodily activity (Ihde 1990), enabling the exploration of phenomena as they are lived and experienced (Valle and King 1978). Framing the body, quite literally, in terms of its "sensorial architec- ture" (Tomas 1989), or its structures of corporeality, has been a useful way to understand how individuals come to know the boundaries of their bod- ies. Therefore, discussions of how we experience the body focus on sensa- tion and function (control of our bodies) (see Harre 1991, for example). Our bodies are enveloped by skin, providing us with a sentient (tactile) bodyscape. Anzieu (1989) extols all the virtues of the skin with a fervor that most reserve for sight,3 noting that it comprises "several sense or- gans" (touch, pressure, pain, and heat) and is closely entwined with our other senses of hearing, sight, smell, and taste, as well as "awareness of body movement and balance" (1989:14). In addition, Anzieu comments</page><page sequence="9">The Corporeal Body in Virtual Reality ? 323 on how the skin also remains continually open to the world in a manner different from other sense organs. The eyes can be closed, the ears and nose stopped up, but the skin "cannot reject any vibro-tactile or electro- tactile sign" (1989:14-15). We are able to move our limbs and twist our torsos, providing our- selves with a stream of proprioceptive feedback of our bodies extended in space. In fact, the body occupies many phenomenal spaces. Anthony (1968) discusses the various body spaces which arise out of different ac- tivities: there is "a mouth space, a visual space, an auditory space, a tactile space, [and] postural and kinaesthetic spaces" (1968:1108). The interac- tions of body and world animate these different spaces effortlessly on our part. At times, these spaces shout out their existence: for example, Goin and Goin (1981) talk of how, at the dentist, we "suddenly become all mouth" (1981:62). Visual inspection of our bodies completes our experi- ence of a bounded body. However, these markers of corporeality are artificially divided here. In fact they all form a synthesis of bodily experience, mutually comple- mentary in our experience. Only when the body breaks down do these corporeal threads unravel: consider the person with paralysis who has vis- ual confirmation of their body, but no tactile or proprioceptive knowledge (Trieschmann 1988). Such a corporeal experience provides us with a body image, that is, a phenomenological understanding of our bodies extended in space and time. The term body image has been much used by different theorists to denote different things. In psychological interpretations it has been used to describe the "knowledge of one's own body, present at the borders of consciousness, or functioning unconsciously" (Tiemersma 1989:1). In employing the term in a phenomenological context we, much like Merleau-Ponty, use it to refer to an immediate knowledge (impression) of the body as it juts into the fabric of experiential space and time.4 For this reason, we cannot speak of body image as a stable entity; the term is a schematic way of talking about the behavioral bonds that are constituted within the body-world (see Moss 1978). The opposition of mind and body has an (incomplete) pheno- menological basis, in Leder's (1990) terms, a "proto-phenomenology." We neglect the body at the times when it recedes from our awareness (Grosz 1994; Leder 1990), which is most of the time. Only with various forms of corporeal breakdown do we pay attention to the body, and at these times the body appears to be "other." Cartesian dualism is built on this selected reflection of the body. A more disciplined phenomenology reveals that the body in the world is both foreground and background. It constitutes our locus, so that we are "here," rather than "there." Yet, at the same time, the body recedes from conscious reflection. At once a holistic sense organ, and yet an assemblage of sense apparatus, the body recedes from awareness in its</page><page sequence="10">324 ? ETHOS perceptual activity. It is the very disclosure of the world the sense organs provide that leads to their mindful demise. The body recedes in activity, but it is always implicitly present and known. For instance, "To see some- thing as reachable and thereby open to my use is to implicitly experience my body's capacity of reach" (Leder 1990:22). In Leder's (1990) words: "My body is always a field of immediately lived sensation. ... Its presence is fleshed out by a ceaseless stream of kinaesthesias, cutaneous, and vis- ceral sensations, defining my body's space and extension and yielding in- formation about position, [and] balance... ." Similarly, Harre (1991:20-21) suggests that the "rim of felt embodiment" is sketched out by how our bodies "feel," and that this is refined by engagement in prac- tical activities. Foster (1992) provides a vivid example of this in her discussion of the body of the dancer, where she argues that our corporeality can be manipu- lated through training. The dancer's body is perceived, argues Foster, via "visual, aural, haptic, olfactory, and, perhaps most important, kinesthetic" sensory patterns (1992:482). Foster does not see the dancer's training as just a finer tuning of corporeal awareness, but contends that "over months and years of study, the training process repeatedly reconfigures the body" (1992:484). Such phenomena suggest the possibility of a manipulable body, a plastic corporeality, a malleable body image. A PHENOMENOLOGY OF EMBODIMENT IN VIRTUAL REALITY A sense of presence, of being there in virtual environments is, per- haps, the ultimate aim of VR research. This calls for a dampening of aware- ness in reality and a heightened acceptance of the surrounding virtuality. The hardware of virtual reality must recede and become transparent for this sense of presence (or "telepresence") to occur. As Lajoie (1996) notes, "To the extent that the terminal, as an interface, acts as an object, it is a constant reminder to users of their inability to become fully subject in the virtual space. In effect, it marks their lack of presence as subject within the virtual reality" (1996:163). It is only with the transparency of visual, kinesthetic, aural, and other displays that a sense of virtual embodiment can be engendered.5 However, Penny (1994) argues that, even with smaller, less cumbersome peripher- als, the fact of one's attachment to the outside of the body creates a barrier between the virtual body and the corporeal body. The continuity of the- body-as-I in VR calls for an assimilation of both technological peripherals and the virtual (re)presentation. In the case of VR peripherals such as HMDs, gloves, and body suits, we can illuminate this process by way of recourse to Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty.</page><page sequence="11">The Corporeal Body in Virtual Reality ? 325 In Heidegger's (1962) analysis of tool use, he uses the example of a hammer to propose the idea that a tool can become the means rather than the object of experience. The tool itself is also surpassed as it withdraws into the architecture of the body, forming what Ihde (1990) terms "an embodiment relation." The tool is not separate, but part of body experi- ence. Similarly, Merleau-Ponty (1970) argues that the cane for the blind person is no longer an object, but an extension of the realm of the senses. Indeed, Merleau-Ponty speaks of it as "an instrument with which he per- ceives. It is a bodily auxiliary, an extension of the bodily synthesis" (1970:152). With the cane as a "familiar instrument," touch is experi- enced at its end point ("its point has become an area of sensitivity" [Mer- leau-Ponty 1970:143], rather than at the hand. This incorporation of the tool into the body gestalt is what Leder (1990:34; see also Grosz 1994) refers to as a "phenomenological osmosis," whereby "the body allows in- struments to melt into it" (Kujundzic and Buschert 1994:207-208). In so far as we take technologies into our experiencing by perceiving through them, the technology becomes embodied.6 The above phenomenal examples of how the body incorporates tools into its structure have implications for how we experience peripheral de- vices of VR technology. The separation between biological and cyber-bod- ies that Penny discusses appears invalid, providing that the virtual environments and virtual body incorporate these devices. If there is a pur- pose for having peripherals, such as the dataglove, within the narrative of the virtual environment itself, then it may be possible that the dataglove becomes transparent in the same way that Heidegger's hammer and Mer- leau-Ponty's cane do. Alongside an understanding of the phenomenology of the peripheral devices in VR, an understanding of the phenomenological experience of virtual embodiment requires the consideration of the perceptual effect that VR has on the experience of the body. It has been argued that for a sense of "presence" in virtual environments, the virtual body must closely resemble (both visually and sensorially) the body of the user (the anthro- pomorphic argument). Sheridan (1992) asks how the "geometric map- pings" of the body within the virtual and physical environments, relative to each other, contribute to a sense of presence. For identification, and therefore telepresence to take place, it would seem that a similarity in the visual appearance of the person and the virtual body is required (Held and Durlach 1992). However, other discourses have discussed the polymor- phous potentiality of VR (the polymorphic argument). This refers to the notion that the represented body in VR does not have to closely map the person's body in real life. In effect, it is envisaged that people could expe- rience a radically reconfigured body, say from their usual anthropoid</page><page sequence="12">326 ? ETHOS experience, to that of a lobster. It is not that you experience yourself through the lobster; rather, you experience the architecture of the body as that of a lobster. In order to fully understand how a user experiences the body in VR, and to identify the "phenomenological dimensions of the technologically mediated body" (Balsamo 1993), we need to build up a rich phenomenol- ogy of user embodiment. This can come through an analysis of user's ac- counts and observation of their immersions. In what follows, we will set out some pertinent detail to the anthropomorphic argument. This includes a consideration of studies that have attempted the close coupling of virtual and physical bodies discussed above. Later we will address the issues im- plicated within the polymorphic argument. Anthropomorphic Representations in VR Here we will examine previous studies of observations and personal accounts of immersion in VR, in which the person's real body is closely matched by a virtual representation. By providing visually approximate representations of the body (anthropomorphic), it has been suggested that people will be engaged in a more immersive VR experience. Therefore, as in real life, when someone looks down in a virtual environment they would see their body (legs, feet). Similarly, when they move their real arm in the physical environment, a virtual representation would also move, percep- tually, in the same bodily space. Here, it has been argued, immersion is partially predicated on being able to both see a virtual and feel a physical body that closely corresponds, and that, without this close correspon- dence, a sense of embodied immersion would be disrupted (Slater and Usoh 1994). As an example of how VR technology is progressing in its attempts to intentionally incorporate the user's body in a close coupling of virtual and actual reality we can consider the work of Slater and Usoh (1994). Slater and Usoh provided an experimental group with a (visually) entire virtual body representation (a crude polygonal representation of a real human body). The directly manipulable components of this body consisted of a representation of their right hand attached to an arm that could be bent and twisted in response to similar movements of the real arm and wrist. When participants turned their real head by more than 60 degrees, the virtual body turned appropriately. A control group was exposed to the same virtual environment, but without any virtual body representation. Slater and Usoh argue that a high correspondence between sensory data proprioception of the physical and virtual body make it more likely that a VR user will identify with the virtual body, hence leading to a sense of presence in the virtual environment.</page><page sequence="13">The Corporeal Body in Virtual Reality ? 327 During this experiment, some participants commented that they felt detached from their virtual represented body and experienced it as an encumbrance. It would seem that matching the physical and virtual body visually does not automatically lead to a sense of embodiment. More is required. Slater and Usoh suggest that a greater proprioceptive correspon- dence between the physical and virtual body is therefore necessary. Indeed, there is anecdotal evidence that indicates that a visual repre- sentation of the body in VR may not be a requisite for feelings of virtual embodiment. For instance, in her essay "The Virtual Body in Cyberspace," Anne Balsamo (1993), prompted by her own "trip," characterizes her vir- tual experience as a "disembodied gaze." Here VR applications mime the disembodied camera eye of film; that is, the point of view approximates the height of an embodied eye, and movement of perspective is simulated. Because of an eye-level perspective that changes with a turn of the head, there was a sense of the experienced body even though there was no visual reference to the body itself.7 Balsamo was not arguing here of a disembodied experience, or of a mind wandering separately from the body; rather, that the experience was very similar to everyday life, in which the body is "surpassed," but ever- present. This echoes earlier arguments that, in real life, for much of the time, the body recedes from awareness. The disappearance of the body in VR is manufactured in one mode of bodily awareness, i.e., visually. This is a poor method of eliminating the phenomenal body which, in its kines- thetic and proprioceptive modes of presence, continues to surface in per- ceptual experience. It is always there, but we do not always have to be conscious of it. It is in this sense that an anthropomorphic representation of the physical body may not always be an integral part of virtual embodi- ment. From this brief review, it can be seen that the evidence for anthropo- morphic embodiment in VR is not clear and decisive. Alongside this view, a speculative discourse has developed on the potential for a person to ex- perience new forms of embodiment in VR. This body of discourse will now be reviewed. Polymorphic Representations in Virtual Reality The facility of VR to allow users to be represented by "any chosen form" has been discussed (Fisher 1991). For example, Hayles (1994) de- scribes a VR system called Placeholder, where the user is able to choose from four animals in which to be embodied. Choosing a crow allows the user to fly, while choosing a snake allows movement by crawling and equips the user with infrared vision. Bukatman (1993) recognizes the "simulated, but powerful, polymorphism" which is at work in such appli- cations. "To be installed into such an apparatus would be to exist on two</page><page sequence="14">328 * ETHOS planes at once: while one's objective body would remain in the real world, one's phenomenal body would be projected into the terminal reality" (1993:187). In addition to allowing people to use any chosen form in VR, Jaron Lanier (see Biocca and Levy 1995) has taken this notion further. He pro- vides anecdotes about virtual reality experiments in which the relation- ship between bodily movement and sensory feedback are retransfigured. Here, body parts were presented in different proportions in the virtual world for perceptual effect such that new questions could be posed: "What if your eyes were on your fingers? . . . What if you took all the measure- ments and the movements of your physical body and somehow put them through a mathematical function that allowed you to control six arms at once with practice?" (Biocca and Lanier 1992:158). A literary example helps provides us with an idea of the phenomenology of a radically re-fig- ured body in VR: As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found hiniself trans- formed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was lying on his hard, as it were armor- plated, back and when he lifted his head a little could see his dome-like brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed-quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes. [Kafka 1967:12] If we can experience a sense of embodiment within such transfigured representations, then the potential real-life applications of these technolo- gies are enormous, particularly for people with disabilities. So, for in- stance, someone with paralysis might be able to employ "sip and puff" (sucking and blowing on a straw) control strategies for their virtual limbs. In this discourse, quadriplegics will walk or become "Olympic athletes" (Fodor 1994). In fact the input/output (i/o) devices so characteristic of VR become, in this speculative discourse, the means of abolishing/creating disability. The distinction between abled and disabled disappears. "In Vir- tual Reality everyone is disabled to the extent that we cannot participate without 'assistive devices,' and on the other hand, there need be no limit to what we can accomplish with them" (Lasko-Harvill 1993:61). The issue that statements such as these raise is whether such control strategies will allow a user to experience these virtual limbs as part of their phenomenal bodies. Penny (1994) talks of a designer reality, where we will be able to choose the morphology and style of our bodies. Here, the mor- phology of the body may be manipulated (Penny gives the example of a giant lobster), as additional sensors are employed to animate extra limbs. Penny, obviously more enamored of myoelectric technology than current VR peripheral devices, tells us: "The mind maps to this new body almost effortlessly" (1994:262). Lanier's report that "it only takes two to three minutes to remap arbitrarily placed sensors [i.e., chin and knee] as controllers for extra limbs" is seized upon by Penny to "suggest that the</page><page sequence="15">The Corporeal Body in Virtual Reality * 329 mind can quickly draw a new internal body representation to allow control of the new body" (Penny 1994:262). It is important not to confuse ease of control with habitation of a new body. What is required is evidence of the mapping of real onto virtual bodies/entities. In the absence of compelling evidence, we can turn to the notions of disrupted bodies to better understand the re-transfiguration of bodies in the real world into bodies in the virtual world. DISRUPTED BODIES In the following, the embodied experiences (both in a sensorial and morphological sense) of prostheses wearers and people with paralysis are explored. This informs us of how radical transfigurations of bodies in the real world can offer insights into implications for the (re)design of the body in VR. It must be kept in mind that transfigurations of the body through prosthesis use and paralysis cannot be understood fully without a consid- eration of the cultural mileau in which such experiences are embedded. Indeed, Lindsay French (1994) has indicated that the cultural milieu in which prostheses are embedded is an important aspect of prosthesis use, and how others perceive of the personal characteristics of prosthesis users are culturally constituted. In her study of a Cambodian population, French found that people who had lost limbs were considered bad luck and became outcasts. The wearing of a prosthesis in this cultural context may have very different consequences for feelings of embodiment. Alongside these cultural issues are inextricably implicated questions of gender and race. In the following exposition of embodiment and prosthetics, issues of culture, race, and gender are addressed. Using Prostheses: Body Image, the Prosthetic, and the Phantom Limb Phenomenon There is a body of literature on the experiences surrounding prosthe- sis use (Frank 1986, 1988; French 1994) which concerns both people who have lost a limb due to amputation and people with congenital limb ab- sence. For the purposes of this paper, we are interested in how people who have suffered amputation experience bodily disruption on two levels: first, with amputation; and second, with addition of the prosthesis. In the case of people with congenital limb absence, we are interested in the impact of prosthesis use on their experiences of embodiment. The literature suggests that with amputation, the person loses a "con- ceptual link to the world, an anchor of his very existence" (Murphy 1987: 85). In objective terms, amputees lose all modes of bodily knowledge about their lost limb. In the amputee's phenomenal experience, this is not the</page><page sequence="16">330 ? ETHOS case, as the phantom limb phenomenon often asserts its presence. Typi- cally, amputees report feeling as if their amputated limb is "still there." Merleau-Ponty (1970) understands the phantom limb phenomena as a result of "being-in-the-world." For an amputee to have phantom phe- nomena is to "remain open" to a customary world, and to "retain the prac- tical field which one enjoyed before mutilation" (1970:81-82). The customary world continues to elicit habitual intentions (lost capabilities). The amputee is torn between two bodies-the customary or habitual body, and the body-at-this-moment-that is, the disrupted body reality. For Merleau-Ponty, understanding how someone can have the sensation of still possessing an amputated limb involves finding out how the habitual body can act as guarantee for the body-at-this-moment. Recent research by Murray and Sixsmith (1996) has centered on the phenomenological boundaries of prosthesis users' bodies, and has started to address the cultural, gendered, and racial nature involved therein. This research included interviewing (face-to-face and via electronic mail) both people with amputations and those with congenital limb absence (n=35) about their embodied experiences of prosthesis use (Murray and Sixsmith 1998), as well as drawing on electronically stored archived material in which people talked about their everyday lived experiences as prostheses users (Sixsmith and Murray, in press). Murray and Sixsmith (1996) found that one way of describing how the amputee's habitual body continues to guarantee the "body-at-this moment" involved the use of a prosthetic. Here, the habitual body is buttressed by an effective combination of the artificial and phantastic: the prosthetically enhanced body-at-this-mo- ment acts as guarantee for the habitual body. Quotations drawn from this study help to illustrate these points. Thus, we can consider this phenomenon with regards to one amputee who said: "I have always worn a prosthetic for all my waking hours unless I was injured. I feel connected to the ground much like I do with my real foot, maybe this is because of phantom limb experience" (Murray and Sixsmith 1996). Here, the different properties of the prosthetic and phan- tom limb phenomena entwine (the "legness" of the phantom, the solidity and reality of the prosthetic), which anchors (a connectedness-to-the- ground) the amputee to his habitual world.8 In addition to a frequently expressed emotional attachment to an ar- tificial limb, prosthetic users often report that the limb feels "part of them." Consider the following excerpt from an interview with a woman with a lower-limb amputation: ... many amputees feel that their artificial limb is somehow part of them, a simple example of this is that I wouldn't like just anyone putting their hand on my knee, even though it is not actually part of my body's flesh, it is still mine even though it's a piece of plastic and metal. [Murray and Sixsmith 1996]</page><page sequence="17">The Corporeal Body in Virtual Reality ? 331 It is important to recognize that culture and gender may influence the experience of embodiment for prosthesis users. For instance, many women in Murray and Sixsmith's (1996) study indicated that their pros- theses were central to maintaining their feminine identity, such as being able to continue wearing high heels, to go dancing and so forth. However, other women remarked on the "ugliness" of their prostheses, and how they interfered with the establishment of sexual relationships. In contrast, males in this study appeared more concerned with purely utilitarian func- tions provided by their prostheses, such as being able to continue driving a car. Interestingly, prosthetic company advertisements often depict male prosthesis users in cars, emphasizing the culturally valued link between men and driving (Kurzman 1997). Thus, the cultural context of feminine attractiveness contrasts with masculine functionality, both of which play a part in a cultural and gendered embodiment of prostheses. Race may also be an integral issue in prosthetic embodiment. For example, prosthetic cosmetic covers, which surround the working mecha- nisms of a prosthesis, need to be visually redolent of the color of the user's skin. While issues surrounding race do not currently appear in existing research material, there are commercial companies that specialize in pro- viding these cosmetic covers, which therefore indicates that race is an important consideration. Until issues of race have been explored with re- spect to prosthesis use, it is problematic to attempt to explicate its role further here, aside from highlighting race as an important area of future research. When considering issues of embodiment involving people with con- genital limb absence, the phenomenon of phantom limb is less pertinent than the reconfiguration of the body through the wearing of a prosthesis. For people with congenital limb absence, prostheses are a redesign of the body. Previous research involving people with congenital limb absence has concentrated on the rejection of the artificial limbs, noting that many of these participants felt their bodies felt complete without prosthetics (Frank 1984, 1986, 1988). In Murray and Sixsmith's (1996) research however, the embodiment of people with congenital limb absence who had continued to use prosthet- ics was of interest. Here it was found that many of these participants re- ported similar phenomenological embodiments of prosthetics as amputees. For example, a female interviewee with congenital absence of her right forearm stated: " ... it's [the prosthesis] a part of me now, that's the only way I can describe it. To me it's as if, though I've not got my lower arm, it's as though I've got it and it's a part of me now. It's as though I've got two hands, two arms" (Murray and Sixsmith 1996). As well as this direct assertion, amputees and people with congenital limb absence provide rich descriptions of prosthesis use reminiscent of the</page><page sequence="18">332 ? ETHOS descriptions given of embodied technologies by Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Ihde discussed earlier in relation to VR peripheral devices (e.g. HMDs, three-dimensional mice, etc.). The body, in Sartre's (1970) terminology, "extends across" the prosthesis to incorporate it into the phenomenologi- cal body image. In the context of VR, this phenomena of prosthetic embodiment, of how prosthesis become part of the body even for people with congenital limb absence, is also informative about the possibility of providing VR us- ers with additional limbs. Prosthesis use is, for those with congenital limb absence, a redesign of the user. The incorporation into the body of the prosthesis, evident in the above research, is indicative of how VR users might adjust to altered bodies in VR applications. However, it must be noted that this statement has at least one caveat: the prosthesis user may reach this type of incorporation only after many years of use, if at all (see Frank 1984, 1986, 1988). Many amputees interviewed by Murray and Sixsmith (1996) and Murray, Sixsmith, and Grogan (in press) are adept users of their prosthetic technology, but still some of them insist on the otherness, or pure utility, of these limbs. Paralysis Paralysis involves the loss of many modes of knowledge about the body (e.g., tactile and proprioceptive). Robert Murphy wrote about his own experience of quadriplegia in The Body Silent: ... I no longer know where my feet are, and without the low-level pain I still feel, I would hardly know I had legs.... I have ... become emotionally detached from my body, often referring to one of my limbs as the leg or the arm.... As my condition has deteriorated, I have come increasingly to look upon my body as a faulty life-support system, the only function of which is to sustain my head.... My solution to this di- lemma is radical dissociation from the body, a kind of etherialization of identity. [Mur- phy 1987:851 It is clear that, for Murphy, paralysis constitutes an objectification of the physical body, whereby it becomes more an object than a means of expe- rience. Another mode of bodily experience surrounding paralysis is evident in the work of Trieschmann (1988). He reports on how some spinal cord injury patients (particularly those with quadriplegia) describe their em- bodiment as a sensation of "feeling like a balloon floating in space" (1988:61), that is, they have no "perceptible ties" to the ground. When one considers that these patients have sensation from the neck and head only, the metaphor speaks a phenomenological truth. Indeed, Murphy (1987) notes that "Many paralytics say that they no longer feel attached to their bodies, which is another way of expressing the shattering of Merleau- Ponty's mind-body system" (1987:87). Accounts such as these demonstrate</page><page sequence="19">The Corporeal Body in Virtual Reality ? 333 the importance of "authorship of action" (Harre 1991), to be able to con- trol the body, in contributing to an ownership or identification of the self with the body. Instances of disrupted embodiment, and the body images they pro- vide, inform us of the importance of sensation, function, and morphology upon the selfs corporeal moorings to the body. They tell us about a process of re-embodiment-a radical metamorphosis in the architecture of the body. Amputees and people with congenital limb absence who use pros- theses experience "the extended body," while paralytics experience "the receding body." In direct relation to VR, it can be argued that the changes in sensory information that come with amputation, the embodiment of prosthetics, and paralysis take time to crystallize into a concise body psyche, where- upon a sense of completeness allows a reliable body image once more. Similarly, it might be that the dizzying sensory changes that accompany VR experiences likewise disorient our sense of body before, with explora- tion and time, a coherent body is experienced. In the following section of this paper we will see how the key phenom- ena of phantom limb (as experienced by the amputee) and objectification of the body (as experienced by the paralytic) are manifested in current VR applications. In addition, we will also readdress arguments for polymor- phic experiences within VR. A RETURN TO PHENOMENOLOGICAL EMBODIMENTS IN VR: THE PHANTOM, OBJECTIFIED, AND POLYMORPHIC BODY In ancient Egypt, the word ka referred to an "ethereal and less dense" copy of the human body. This "invisible but still material analogue" of the soul "inhabited and animated" the physical body (Grosz 1994:62-63). Such a cultural myth echoes the state of the body in current VR systems. We might consider that the dense human body inhabits an ethereal virtual one. For instance, Romanyshyn (1994) argues that it is close to the phe- nomenology of cyberspace experience to see the virtual or cyberbody as "haunting" the virtual world. The cyberbody has a "ghostly presence . . . its interactions with its virtual environment leave no tangible marks upon its digital flesh" (1994:97). Similarly, Hayles (1992) describes the act of closing the hand in VR to grasp an object. While the person sees the virtual object, often there is no kinesthetic feedback of touch. "Proprioceptive sense flows out of the body to meet the artifact, but since there is no ma- terial object, it returns a feedback loop that acts to de-materialize the body" (Hayles 1992:168). Or, it might be that the physical body becomes more ethereal (less tangible) in the virtual experience while perceptually and experientially</page><page sequence="20">334 ? ETHOS the virtual body becomes more dense. Heim (1995) implies much the same thing when he says that "HMD immersion results from the primary body giving away priority to the cyberbody.... The user undergoes a high- powered interiorization of a virtual environment, but in the process loses self-awareness" (1995:72). A fictional example of this is provided by the British television science-fiction comedy Red Dwarf. In one episode, Cat, one of the main characters, attempts to leave an "artificial reality console" by taking off the peripheral devices. After taking off the left glove and boot, Cat's (virtual) body is rendered paralyzed along his left side, and this is his dominant bodily perception. This is a question of phenomenal embodiment in VR systems: our technological embodiment may vacillate between the two, but two there are. This is what Simon Penny calls the "split body condition" or the "dou- ble body" (1994:242). In VR, part of the sensorial architecture of the body remains in the physical world, while another is projected into the virtual one. The corporeal body in the physical environment remains ever present to mind, while an electronic body image weakly echoes and competes with it. When only parts of the body are absorbed by VR technology, phantom phenomena occur. The degree to which our visual corporeality dominates our embodied experience influences the tangibility of our remaining body outside the VR experience. As an example of the informative value of atypical embodiment when applied to VR, it is useful to return to the findings of Slater and Usoh (1994). The range of movement offered by the virtual body in the studies was limited. Following a pilot study (in which only one arm and gross torso movements were represented), some participants commented that their virtual body was "a dead weight," "a useless thing," and "nothing to do with me" (Slater and Usoh 1994:134). The authors provide their own anal- ogy of this phenomenon. They use an example of atypical embodiment, namely the loss of proprioception, to inform us about the participants' behavior. The example is drawn from a 1985 essay by Oliver Sacks, enti- tled "The Disembodied Lady." The subject of the essay is a woman named Christina, who has lost all sense of her muscle, tendon, and joint positions. By her own account, Christina couldn't "feel" her body. She felt "disem- bodied." Only by careful (visual) observation of her movements could Christina accomplish motor tasks. Without this close scrutiny her body was "blind" to itself. She would "lose" her arms, for instance, and com- ments, "I think they're one place, and I find they're another" (Sacks 1985:46). However, the responses from the participants in Slater's and Usoh's studies are remarkably similar to the comments made by people with paralysis of various parts of their bodies. In both cases an objectification of the body (or its parts) is articulated. The dissociation that Murphy</page><page sequence="21">The Corporeal Body in Virtual Reality ? 335 (discussed earlier) experienced with regards to his body is similar to that experienced by some participants in Slater and Usoh's studies. We can relate the objectification of these bodies to their lack of movement and direct sensation. Tasks in VR require a high degree of visual concentration when manipulation is required and force-feedback is absent. In a study by Draper (1995), participants' practices were indicative of an extreme ob- jectification of the virtual body: "one pilot subject attempted to separate the free-floating right arm from the body for use as a detached virtual ruler!" (Draper 1995:unpaginated). This is only part of the story. While Murphy demonstrated a lack of movement and sensation from his body, inhabitants of current virtual bod- ies do have their physicality to fall back on. For instance, Slater and Usoh comment that "one subject on noticing the fixed virtual left arm began to move her real left arm very rapidly, in a manner indicating panic," while another related that "I thought there was really something wrong with my [left] arm" (Slater and Usoh 1994:133). One reading of these comments is that participants experienced the contradiction between their virtual and bio-bodies as phantom phenomena (a feature of the amputee's experi- ence). While they experienced a kind of paralysis in the virtual environ- ments, they also experienced a moveable body in the "primary world" (Heim 1995). Such an interpretation would also appear to explain another comment made by a participant about "walking" in the virtual environ- ment: "Sometimes [I had] a desperate need to actually walk when virtually walking, there does seem to be a conflict between what the eyes see and the body feels-e.g., my feet appear to be floating, but I can feel my feet on the ground" (Slater and Usoh 1994:135). When familiar embodiment is disrupted through paralysis or amputa- tion, the person is forced to thematize their bodies. This thematization may lead to a dissociation from the body, which slowly subsides as a mas- tery and familiarity with the body is regained. These examples shed light on what current (re)designs of the body in VR entail. For a compelling transfiguration in the perception of the body using VR technology, the physical body itself must be manipulated. The visual confirmation of a reconfigured body is not sufficient. A good example of a manipulation of the body that may be amenable to polymorphic VR appli- cations is provided by Catherine Richards (discussed in Hayles 1996). Richards used a vibrator to stimulate the surface of the arms and hand of blindfolded participants. One participant felt her neck shrink and thicken, until finally it sunk into her chest; another women felt her arms grow longer, stretching more than six feet away from her body. Hayles (1996) notes how such a simple device is capable of destabilizing and reconfiguring our perceived body. How much more compelling, she asks, would this experi- ence be if it were accompanied by simulated visual information via a HMD.</page><page sequence="22">336 0 ETHOS CONCLUSION Throughout this paper, we have attempted to explore the notion of embodiment of the corporeal body in virtual reality. We have argued that a sense of embodiment in VR is predicated upon two phenomena: the sen- sorial architecture of the body, and the malleability of body boundaries. The more it is possible to enter the whole sensorium in VR, the more it is possible to feel embodied within it. But equally important is the extent to which people can blur their body boundaries and extend their bodily cor- poreality into the virtual environment. This has implications for the future configurations of virtual reality systems. It may be possible to design such systems to facilitate experiences of embodiment. This is particularly the case when considering peripheral devices. For example, immersive virtual environments can be created and perceived using specialized input/output devices, such as a HMD, or instrumented clothing, such as a dataglove. Such devices can be used to transform the phenomenal (e.g., visuo-tactile, kinesthetic) properties of the body. Proprioception and the phenomenal plasticity of body boundaries can thus be accommodated in synthetic me- dia when the body topology becomes accessible. However, the extent to which specialized devices and/or clothing (such as the body-suit) may al- ter the sensorium of the body to redefine experiential human morphology is still an open question. Another enigmatic aspect of embodiment in VR is whether a repre- sentation of the body is necessary in virtual environments, and if so, what form it should take. Judging from the limited amount of research we have reviewed herein, it appears that visual representation of the person's body is not always required to create a feeling of embodied presence. However, when visual representations are included, both anthropomorphic and po- lymorphic virtual bodies engender feelings of embodiment. This may be largely due to the malleability of experiential body boundaries. Indeed, within this paper we have proposed that instances of atypical embodiment (what we refer to as "disrupted bodies") provide us with rich examples of the malleable body image and indicate how reconfigured bodies are expe- rienced in VR systems. Embodiment in VR has been explored, in this paper, in a contextual matrix. The body has been understood as a cultural product, a gendered and ethnic entity. We argue that any understanding of embodiment must take into account this sociocultural context of embodiment. It is apparent that the historical development of VR emerged from a white, male, Western, and scientific context. If this ethnocentric developmental context contin- ues to be imposed, then women and people from other ethnic backgrounds may feel alienated because their culturally constituted bodily experiences are not recognized in VR environments.</page><page sequence="23">The Corporeal Body in Virtuat Reality ? 337 The phenomenological approach taken in this paper promotes a deeper understanding of these issues and enables a critical examination of the way in which the body may be instantiated within virtual reality. We are thus allowed to challenge disembodied Cartesian accounts of the body at the computer terminal while the mind is in cyberspace. We have con- ducted an exploration of embodiment in VR from this phenomenological perspective. This appears to be a promising route to understanding peo- ple's own experiences of embodiment in VR systems. Phenomenological analysis of experience is critical to an understanding of embodiment per se, and of embodiment in virtual reality in particular. It is through such a perspective that considerations of sensorium, morphology, repre- sentation, ethnicity, and gender have implications for future development of VR. Therefore, we advocate a phenomenological approach in future ex- aminations and elaboration of embodiment in virtual reality. CRAIG D.

A case can be made for envisaging a dissolution between social and bodily space, or at least for seeing that this distinction is ambiguous or problematic. Straus (1966) argues that social space is an expansion of the "body scheme." It belongs to the body, but not com- pletely: "it is not an indisputable property, but a variable possession." This "intervening space is a medium between me and the world," and that is its social significance (Straus 1967:153). Ihde (1990) notes that what we take as our "real" or "naked bodily space" is transformed through optical technologies such as the microscope and eyeglasses. VR as a predominantly optical technology has the same and additional properties as those of tradi- tional lens technologies. Along with the ability to move forever forward (magnify) and back- ward (miniaturize) in relation to an image, in VR our naked space is transformed, particularly when we do not have a virtual body (re)presentation. 2. The reassuring pats on the buttocks and torso that Heim observes in emerging VR users is reminiscent of behavior observed in some schizophrenics and psychotics who ex- press their reason for caressing, cutting, or banging various parts of the body as a wish to "regain a clear picture of the dimensionality of their bodies, which had become vague or 'deadened'" (Fisher 1973:23-24). 3. "Of all the sense organs," argues Anzieu, "[the skin] is the most vital: one can live without sight, hearing, taste or smell, but it is impossible to survive if the greater part of</page><page sequence="24">338 ? ETHOS one's skin is not intact. The skin ... occupies a greater surface (. .. 18,000 [square centime- ters] in the adult) than any other sense organ" (1989:14). 4. Merleau-Ponty tells us that "my body for me is not an assemblage of organs juxtaposed in space. I am in undivided possession of it and know where each of my limbs is through a body image in which all are included" (1970:98). To illustrate the immediacy of the body image extended in space ("a spatiality of situation"), he continues, "If I stand in front of my desk and lean on it with both hands, only my hands are stressed and the whole of my body trails behind them like the tail of a comet. It is not that I am unaware of my shoulders or back, but these are simply swallowed up in the position of my hands, and my whole posture can be read, so to speak, in the pressure they exert on the table" (Merleau-Ponty 1970:100). 5. However, there is also a sense whereby donning HMDs, gloves, and body suits becomes a ritual. In order to enter the virtual world, these devices must be worn, both literally and symbolically. For example, consider a study by Slater et al. (1994) where a more intense sense of presence was induced by having participants simulate the process of entering the virtual environment while already immersed in a virtual environment. This simulation in- cluded repetition of donning a virtual HMD to enter different virtual environments. 6. This is not to say that we can't become aware of them. Perception takes place through the peripherals, but as a fringe phenomenon we can become aware of. For instance, we feel the light pressure of eyeglasses on the bridge of the nose, but the focal phenomenon is achieved by the perceptual transparency of the peripherals. This is what Ihde (1990) refers to as a "ratio" between the objectness of the technology and its transparency in use. At the extreme height of embodiment, background presence of the technology may be detected. However, this does not imply that a "dislocation" will inevitably be experienced between the corporeal and the virtual body. 7. The supporting role of the whole body in any perceptual activity is elaborated on by Leder (1990): "When I gaze at a landscape I dwell most fully in the eyes. Yet this is only possible because my back muscles hold my spine erect, my neck muscles adjust my head into the proper position for viewing.... My whole body provides the background that sup- ports and enables the point of corporeal focus. As such, the body itself is not a point but an organized field in which certain organs and abilities come to prominence while others re- cede." 8. This can be compared with the experiences of prosthetic breast implants for some women. The contribution a phantom can make to the acceptance of prosthetic breast im- plants is evidenced by one women who, a year and a half after her mastectomy, was still experiencing phantom breast sensations and immediately experienced the implants as being her own breasts (Goin and Goin 1981:185).
