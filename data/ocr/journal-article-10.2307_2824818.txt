<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARUN. A Natural History of the World's Deepest Valley. By Edward W. Cronin, Jr. Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. $10.95. xiv + 236 p.; ill.; index. 1979. When the Eurasian and Indian plates collided, the Arun river began to drain the resulting land mass even before the Himalayas arose. As the river pene- trated the axis of the mountains, a series of parallel canyons formed, which today often exceed 20,000 feet from floor to summit. The consolidation of two previously independent land masses enabled two dis- tinct biotas to interact. As the rising mountains pro- duced a complex system of subtly varied environmen- tal patches, the variety of life was further enriched. Nevertheless, the diverse Himalayan wildlife is still poorly documented today. The author first journeyed through the principal watershed of eastern Nepal with the Arun Valley Wildlife Expedition, a multidisciplinary survey team sponsored by the Association for the Conservation of Wildlife. His book was intended to provide an over- view of the mountains, to enumerate "important as- pects'' of the natural environment, and to reveal acute misuse of the Himalayan landscape. The volume is directed at both scientists and laymen, but the former may dislike the anthropomorphic prose, frequent philosophical meanderings, and occasional scientific fallacy. For example, the author employs a thorough set of field observations to compile a chapter devoted to the sex life of an orange-rumped honeyguide, dubbed Chang Hua. In his version of elementary mating- systems theory, he claims, "Among wild animals, monogamous mating systems are by far the most common." He summarily categorizes all other types as "wayward" and "aberrations," "so rare that biologists actively seek them out to study." Does this hasty pro- nouncement reflect an ornithological slant- a sub- liminal assumption that all wild animals bear feath- ers? This is enough to raise my hackle. Clearly, polygamy does not fit in with Cronin's concept of zoological morality. The author successfully forewarns the reader of the precarious delicacy of the Himalayan environ- ment. The conflict between nature and culture is fast dooming the feral ambience and the remedies are just as elusive as in the Western world. This book, how- ever, would have been more useful had the author used his sincere empathic insight and impressive ob- servational skill to write a more cohesive exposition. The Himalayan wildlife have not yet received the attention they deserve.</page></plain_text>
