KEENE CONGDON: Caryatid Mirrors of Ancient Greece: Technical, Stylistic and Historical Considerations of an Archaic and Early Classical Bronze Series. Pp. xiv+288; 97 plates. Mainz: Philipp von Zabern, 1981. DM. 390. The Greeks used three kinds of metal mirrors: hand-mirrors (the earliest and most popular variety), standing-mirrors, and box-mirrors. This book deals with the second type, bronze mirrors with anthropomorphic handles which serve as stands - the so-called caryatid mirrors. The manuscript has been long in the making. It started as a Harvard dissertation submitted in 1963. Revised and expanded by 1968, it was finally seen through galley proof in 1976. The Preface is signed March 1977. Congdon has collected and lived with her material for many years. The resultant publication is a lavish and worthy document. One must be grateful for the numerous financial contributions (p. xiii) which permitted its publication. The author brings together more than one hundred caryatid mirrors 'definitely attributable to Mainland and Eastern Greece' (p. 2). Magna Graecian caryatid mirrors are not included, since they constitute a different group deserving a separate study. There is, however, a partial list of them in a supplementary catalogue on pp. 224-41 which will greatly facilitate the work of future researchers in this field. The non-specialist might have benefited from more comments on the differences between Western and Mainland Greek caryatid mirrors (see p. 207). This volume, a corpus in the true sense of the word, contains all the Mainland caryatid mirrors known to the author. They start towards the end of the seventh century B.C., and continue in an uninterrupted series until the third quarter of the fifth century B.C., when they abruptly disappear (or so it seems) and are superseded by box-mirrors. Only one Mainland caryatid mirror (Cat. no. 94) can be dated to the last quarter of the fifth century B.C. There are comparatively few examples before the middle of the sixth century B.C. About half of all the extant pieces fall between the years 480-50 B.C. The book is divided into text and catalogue. Two appendices (drawings, findspots, small fragments of mirrors, etc.) follow the text, and extensive indices follow the catalogue proper: past and present location of objects which appear in both the main and the supplementary catalogue; lists of former collectors and collections; pieces whose present whereabouts are unknown; general topics. There are two bibliographies, one a general list of relevant books, the other a select and annotated list of the literature on caryatid mirrors. To the latter one can now add the recent study by Fiona Cameron, Greek Bronze Hand-Mirrors in South Italy with Special Reference to Calabria (BAR International Series no. 58, 1979). The catalogue entries themselves are arranged chronologically, and contain full descriptions and quite complete bibliographies. Now and then one misses a relevant reference, as with Cat. no. 129, to which one should add: Kunstwerke der Antike [= Kunstmuseum Luzern, Sammlung Robert Kippeli, Sonderausstellung 11. August bis 27. October 1963] no. B 5. And why refer to Richter's 1926 work on Ancient Furniture, or her 1930 Sculpture and Sculptors, when a much more recent edition of both works is widely available? The vague reference to the mirror in Matera (Museo Ridola) on p. 231 should read: AA (1966), p. 307 figs. 64 f. = Tolle-Kastenbein, Peplosfiguren I 97</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW (see below), p. 129 no. 18e, pl. 85, there considered Peloponnesian, not Magna Graecian. The book opens with a brief general survey of Greek mirrors and a discussion of the origins of the caryatid type in particular. Most of the caryatids are female figures. Only four extant male mirror supports are known from Mainland and Eastern Greece. By contrast, male caryatid mirrors are quite popular in Magna Graecia. The female series from Greece proper can be divided into three major classes: (1) nude or semi-nude girls, ca. 600-480 B.c.; (2) the 'Standing Ionic' type wearing a chiton and usually a himation as well, ca. 550-475 B.C.; and (3) the 'Standing Doric' type, clad in a peplos, ca. 490-20 B.C. There is little information on the precise find-circumstances of most of the mirrors discussed. Six are known to come from sanctuaries, a few others from graves where they have been found together with household furnishings rather than religious objects (e.g. Cat. no. 16, interred with a strigil!). It seems, therefore, that caryatid mirrors were made both for private use and as votive offerings or ritual objects in sanctuaries. There has been much speculation about the identity of these female caryatids. C. is cautious in her discussion, and suggests that the figurines portray a variety of women: a number of the nude ones who carry musical instruments are probably connected with some religious ceremony (as cult participants, hetaerae and/or musicians); girls wearing loincloths may represent athletes; some fully clothed examples perhaps depict Aphrodite, priestesses or ordinary women. Chapter Two deals with technical matters. Materials, methods of casting (open and bivalve moulds, cire perdue), and joining techniques are discussed in detail. Early caryatid mirrors are cast in two parts, disk and figure-base. By contrast, some later ones (e.g. Cat. no. 89) consist of at least fifteen units joined together. In Chapter Three C. assigns the mirrors to nine geographical groups based on stylistic variations: Laconian, Aeginetan, Greek Island, Eastern Greek, Sikyonian, Attic, Corinthian, Argo-Corinthian, and Argive. She stresses that some of these attributions are tentative and that a few pieces do not fit into any category. It should be noted that neither the findspot nor the subsidiary decoration of the mirrors has proved of much help to the author in assigning them to particular centres of production. The most consistently useful criterion for attribution remains the caryatid figure itself, but stylistic analysis is often open to different interpretations. In her Fruhklassische Peplosfiguren. Originale (1980), Renate Tolle-Kastenbein has cata- logued the same caryatid peplophoroi as C., yet it is astonishing that they hardly ever agree in matters of attribution. C.'s Attic group, for instance, consists of four mirrors, two of which are only 'related' pieces, whereas Tolle-Kastenbein attributes thirty-one mirrors to her Athenian school. Ultimately, it does not matter greatly whether one agrees with C.'s (or anyone else's) attributions to regional schools: the issue is really not that important. Of greater value is the collection of all the material in one volume and its superb illustration. This book gives us both. Stylistic comparisons with other monuments, circumstances of discovery, and the development of the various components of the caryatid mirror are all studied in Chapter Four, in order to establish a relative chronology which, to this reviewer, seems entirely convincing. One interesting observation which emerges here is that, with the exception of Laconia and East Greece, where mirrors seem to have been produced for many decades, all the other regional schools postulated by C. appear to have lasted only thirty to fifty years each. C. also suggests that Argos and Corinth were responsible for most of the fifth century B.C. caryatid mirrors, but present evidence gives her no decisive support. Students of ancient art have good reason to be grateful to the author and to the 98</page><page sequence="3">staff of Philipp von Zabern for producing this beautiful volume. It is an important and thorough work which will not easily be superseded. Christ Church, Oxford CARLOS A. PICON CORPUS VASORUM ANTIQUORUM FILIPPO GIUDICE: Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum, Italy. Fasc. LVI. (Gela, Museo Archeologico, 4.) Pp. 31; 47 plates. Rome: Multi- graphica Editrice, 1979. This is Professor Giudice's second volume devoted to the Navarra Collection, and as with the first there is much in it to commend. Fifty-eight vases are black-figure; forty are non-figure; one uses applied red in a technique similar to Six's and another is in contour-line technique: a hundred vases in all. Almost all are previously unpublished, and all but fourteen are lekythoi. The artists for the most part comprise those of lesser talents who specialized in quick, clone-like production for export, or for the less affluent pocket at home. Not much to excite the art historian, but in terms of pure archaeological value these vases are just as important, if not more so, than the finest works by the most talented vase painters of the period. As a group these vases tell us more about late Archaic trade and commerce than any other type, and yet they are always the first to go into storage and the last to receive attention in CVA. Taken with his first volume, G. has given us the best published retrospective yet of the principal trends in late b. f. lekythoi. The photographs are good in view of the condition of the vases, and the text is precise and well considered. There has, however, been some creative plaster work which should have been removed where it was not needed for structural support. More serious is that many of the vases are unnumbered; one would have hoped that the museum would have numbered them, since this volume will undoubtedly remain the definitive photographic record of these vases for many years to come, and to have not done so can only serve to confuse future scholarship. The vase of pl. 35. 1-3, shows the lower half of a rape scene. The author feels the aggressor to be a satyr, and though there is strong primafacie evidence for this, I think it is better to regard the aggressor as an ordinary male, and that what appears to be a clumsy tail is, in fact, a clumsy shield slung over the shoulder. Also it is significant that the aggressor wears a short chiton (hardly satyr dress) and the flanking women are neither dressed nor comporting themselves as maenads. The interested reader should be aware of a scene such as I have described, of apparently identical composition, on a vase in Lyons which confirms to my satisfaction the interpretation offered here. The great majority of the attributions are made by the author and seem sound. Ant. inv. 137/B, left to the wider group of Athens 581. I, reminded the reviewer of the sub-group of P. of Munich 1874, but this balances on a very fine point. One attribution I might add is to cup Ant. inv. 43 with two runners on either side. This can go on record as 'Manner of Elbows Out'. (I am grateful to Dr D. C. Kurtz who persuaded me to ascribe it 'Manner of' rather than place it at the centre of the artist's oeuvre.) For a fragment with similar runners see Gjerstad et al., Greek Geometric and Archaic Pottery found in Cyprus, pl. 41. 6, assigned to Elbows Out (P. of Louvre E705; attrib. Bothmer).
