<plain_text><page sequence="1">Black and White Magic in Ovid's Metamorphoses: Passion, Love, and Art CHARLES SEGAL INTRODUCTION It is the most famous magician in classical lit erature who declares that she would rather stand in the bat tle line three times than give birth once.1 Later in her play, Medea carries further this challenge to the hierarchy of male values in the polis, claiming the children as entirely her own, not her husband's or the city's, to kill and mourn as she chooses. She thereby reverses the position of Apollo in Aeschylus' Eutnenides, who would make the father the "real" parent; and she makes good her claim, after the hor rendous use of her murderous poisons on Jason's bride and the ruler of Corinth, by escaping with the children's bodies on the magical chariot of her grandfather, Helios. This chal lenge that women who possess magical powers pose to mas culine authority runs throughout the literature of ancient Greece and Rome. Enchantresses can help heroes achieve their goals, notably the Medea of Pindar's Fourth Pythian and of Apollonius' Argonautica, but even here an aura of danger lurks in the background. Pindar neutralizes the dan ger by making Medea the victim of Aphrodite's love-magic, the iynx that she invents for this purpose, and Odysseus analogously gets Hermes' moly to neutralize Circe's power to turn men to beasts.2 But Odysseus also needs the prophy lactic of a great oath that she will not make him "unmanned and enfeebled" in their sexual union. Circe's magic, working as it does through the body's appetites, is also sexual magic, and it holds Odysseus in thrall for a whole year, until his companions suggest that it is time to leave. As Medea and Circe illustrate, magic is often associated</page><page sequence="2">2 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC with the male ambivalence towards female sexuality, its cap tivating power but also its risks. It is not surprising, then, that the Odyssey's Helen has magical drugs with which she soothes the Greek victors' painful memories of the past, but she also came close to betraying them by imitating the voices of their wives when they were hidden in the Trojan horse.3 The love magic that Sophocles' Deianeira uses to win back Heracles destroys this greatest of all heroes. Euripides' Phae dra, who succumbs to the Nurse's promise of magical love charms, destroys Hippolytus, the young stepson she has fallen in love with, and thereby bereaves his father and her husband, Theseus. Medea, in Euripides' lost Aegeus, nearly succeeds in the same goal, almost poisoning Theseus at the point of his reunion with his father. To leap ahead to Rome, Virgil's Dido, who comes closer than any female figure in the Aeneid to derailing the hero's mission, seeks the help of a Massylian priestess who pos sesses vast magical powers (Aen. 4.477-91), ostensibly ei ther to win back Aeneas or free her from her love. But even though she uses another's magic and swears that she is re luctantly "girding herself up with magical arts" (4.491-92), she later curses Aeneas with an invocation to Hecate (4.609). In Dido's complex makeup, one strand clearly de rives from the Homeric Circe and the enchantresses of Greek tragedy, in whom magic belongs to the sinister side of female erotic passion. All of these figures are threats to the heroic and imperial aims of their male lovers. In the second half of the Aeneid, Neptune carefully steers Aeneas past Circe's is land and its enchanted beasts (7.10-24). Yet Circe's heritage lives on, ominously, in the ancestry of Latinus, which in cludes the Italic Picus, a victim of the sexual desire of Circe and of the metamorphic magic that she uses in the service of that desire (Aen. 7.189-91). As many commentators have pointed out, these passing references to Circe's magical enchantments parallel and fore shadow other obstructions to the hero's mission that come from female passion, notably Allecto, called forth from Hades</page><page sequence="3">Charles Segal 3 by the angry and jealous Juno, and Amata, with her maenad like band that spirits off Lavinia and temporarily thwarts her union with Aeneas (7.3 85-405).4 Circe's magic belongs to a constellation of forces that challenge with irrationality, muta bility, and instability the founding of an eternal empire, im perium sine fine, commanded by Jupiter and the immota fata of Aeneas' line (1.257-96). In the Metamorphoses, the chal lenge takes less politically overt forms, but there too Circe's sexually motivated magic is one of the major retarding ele ments in Aeneas' journey toward the foundation of Rome. Like many of his contemporaries Ovid is intensely inter ested in magic. In the Ibis, a six-hundred line poem written late in his career, he practices an elaborate devotio against an enemy whom he calls "Ibis," after the poem of Callimachus that he is imitating. Here, as everywhere in his work, Ovid is fully aware of the long tradition of magic as a literary motif, stretching from Homer to his own time, and he elaborates and modifies this with the originality and wit characteristic of all his work. As the Ibis shows, Ovid also draws on pop ular views of magic. He curses his enemy with a long list of misfortunes that befell various mythical figures (219-21) and then adds bits of folk magic, like the threat of emerging from the grave to haunt his victim (151-60) and dreadful curses on his body (161-70). Ovid's oeuvre exhibits a wide range of attitudes to magic, from skeptical distance to playful participation; but for the most part he projects the persona of a cosmopolitan ratio nalist, knowledgeable about magic but detached, ironical, and critical of simple credulity about its powers. He depicts himself as a poet of art, humor, good sense, and reason. In the amatory works, for example, the conventional motifs of love-magic often serve as a foil to a sophisticated and urbane view of love as a part of human nature, which, like all hu man phenomena, lends itself to amused and sympathetic scrutiny. Love is not to be gained by magical arts but by an attractive personality. Medea and Circe, for all their magical</page><page sequence="4">4 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC enchantments, could not hold their man (Ars 2.99-107, Rem. Am. 260-90). In Heroides 6 Hypsipyle attacks her ri val Medea with a long, derogatory list of Medea's magical exploits?drawing the moon from the sky, stopping rivers, moving trees and stones, and using wax images for the de votio. Love, she concludes is to be won by character and beauty, not spells (moribus et forma conciliandus amor, 94; cf. 83M In Amores 3.7 a down-to-earth humor undercuts the sup posed power of magic. Finding himself impotent with his mistress, he goes on for some ten lines wondering whether he has been the victim of a devotio that includes magic spells and waxen images. At the end of the poem, however, the an gry and frustrated mistress gives a more realistic analysis of the situation: "Either some Circean enchantress puts you un der a spell by crossing threads of wool, or else you've come here tired out from another love" (aut te traiectis Aeaea ven?fica lanis I devovet, aut alio lassus amore venis, Am. 3.7.79-80), and she promptly gets dressed and runs off.6 Magic, nevertheless, remains something both practiced and feared by Ovid's contemporaries^ and he sometimes takes a more cautious and less flippant view as he evokes its ambiguous powers. In describing the old bawd Dipsas in Amores 1.8, for example, he voices his "suspicions" about the rumors of her magical arts (suspicor, et fama est, 1.8.15) as he reports the unusual detail of the double pupil of her eye (15-16).8 In the Fasti he shows his familiarity with pop ular beliefs and fears about magic, elaborating on the rites in honor of the Silent Goddess, Muta Tacita on the last day of the Feralia, when ghosts have to be propitiated (2.571-82). Yet even here he ends with a lighter touch in the old woman who performs the ceremonies and drinks up the last of the wine.9 Later in the book, he tells how the nurse Cranae uses good magic to heal the five-day old infant, Proca, who has been attacked by striges, "screech-owls," birdlike demons that tear the flesh of newborn children and drink their blood (6.129-68).IO This episode reflects the traditions of folk</page><page sequence="5">Charles Segal 5 magic that Ovid might have heard from his nurses growing up in Sulmo, where the Palaegnians were well known for their magic.11 THE METAMORPHOSES Like the amatory works, the Metamorphoses often treats magic in a spirit of skeptical rationalism. The most explicit skepticism occurs, predictably, in the mouth of the philoso pher Pythagoras. In his list of mirabilia, he states his disbelief about a swamp that enables men to cover their bodies with feathers (baud equidem credo, 15.359). With equal skepti cism he dismisses an account of Scythian women who are said (memorantur) to practice the same arts by sprinkling themselves with drugs (15.359-60). The Lucretian tag nonne vides in the following lines reinforces the mood of rational ism (15.362). Even though the philosophy of Ovid's Pythago ras is diametrically opposite to Lucretius', he adopts the latter's skeptical attitude of rationalistic science and the ne cessity of proof (cf. siqua fides rebus tarnen est addenda pro bath, "if any belief is to be added to proven events," 15.361). Skepticism about magic, however, is sometimes itself the point at issue. At the end of book 3 Pentheus accuses the worshipers of Bacchus of being taken in by magicae fraudes (3.534); and in book 5 one of Perseus' enemies leads a charge against that hero with an insult to the m?gica arma that he carries (5.197). But in both cases this scorn of super natural power turns against the speaker. In the Myrrha episode the old nurse, like her prototype in Euripides' Hip polytus, offers to heal her desperate young mistress with "spells and herbs" (quae carmine sanet et h er bis) and to "purify (her) by magical rites in case she has been harmed by spells from someone else" (sive aliquis nocuit, m?gico lus trabere ritu, 10.397-98). But her offer of purification leads in just the opposite direction, and she ends up more like the old bawd Dipsas in Amores 1.8, who uses magic arts to win lovers for her mistress.</page><page sequence="6">6 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC Despite occasional skeptical touches, then, magic has an important place in the repertory of narrative devices in the Metamorphoses. It helps create the poem's world of fantas tic events and supernatural beings. In particular, it helps de pict the irrational and the demonic force of the passions. A noteworthy instance occurs in book 4 when Juno summons the Fury Tisiphone from Hades to drive Athamas and Ino to filicidal madness. Tisiphone brings with her the poisonous effluvia of Cerberus and Echidna, followed by a number of quasi-allegorical chthonic forces: wanderings of the mind, lapses of memory, crimes, tears, madness, and murder (4.500-4). These are all ground together (trita simul), mixed with fresh blood and hemlock, and cooked in a bronze cal dron, the metal of choice for magical operations (4.504-5). This brew Tisiphone then decants into the inmost breast of the terrified couple (praecordia intima, 506-7). By this ac tion she effects a deadly violation of boundaries of the body and also takes over the personality of her victim. The process resembles the way in which Envy and Hunger infil trate the body and soul of Aglauros and Erysicthon in books 2 and 8 respectively.12 In all three cases the demonic posses sion of the body accompanies the subject's loss of normal, rational control of his or her mind. Yet Tisiphone's magical operation is remarkable because Ovid's gods generally act through their own supernatural power rather than by magic. As Tisiphone is herself a personification of madness, she should need no magical apparatus; her very presence enacts the visitation of a chthonic demon that invades the body. Eu ripides' personified demon of madness, Lyssa in the Hera cles, needs only enter Heracles' breast (863) and then proleptically describes the effect her madness will produce (864-67). Allecto in Aeneid 7 maddens Turnus by revealing her full, horrid monstrosity and then "fastening her smoking torches beneath his breast" (445-59). Ovid's Envy instills her poisons directly into Aglauros' breast (Met. 2.797-805); and Hunger embraces the sleeping Erysicthon and breathes her venomous self into him (8.816-20).r3 But Tisiphone's</page><page sequence="7">Charles Segal 7 magic displays her terrible powers in terms of concrete, physical human actions. She instills this madness by means of a magical potion that she herself concocts. She grinds up the herbs (trita, 504), much as Circe does to poison Scylla in book 14 (14.44). The details of grinding, mixing, and cook ing, along with the bronze caldron, make Tisiphone a witch as well as a chthonic monster. Ovid here draws on the affini ties between magic and irrationality but develops this con nection in a new way by depicting the supernatural agent of the homicidal madness as an evil enchantress. The story of Meleager and Althaea in book 8 similarly uses magic to express the release of violent human emotions. By keeping the magical motifs in the background, however, Ovid lets the psychological meaning predominate. The power of the magical brand over Meleager's life is estab lished by a spell (carmen) that the Fates sing at his birth (8.451-56). But Ovid shifts the emphasis away from the brand's magical power to the mother's emotional struggles, conveyed in the impassioned monologue in which Althaea sets forth her conflict between her maternal feelings and her desire to avenge her brothers, whom Meleager has killed (8.48i-5ii).I4 Althaea recalls the moment of Meleager's birth, when she gave him a second life, as it were, by remov ing the brand from the fire (bisque datam, primum partu, mox stipite rapto, I redde animam, 504-5). By adding this detail of her extraction of the brand from the fire at the time of his birth, which does not occur elsewhere in the mythical tradition,15 Ovid makes the magical talisman a symbolical extension of the maternal love with which Althaea is now in such deep conflict. Meleager dies when that love turns to ha tred. At this point the brand resumes something of its magi cal power: when Althaea threw it into the fire, "it gave, or seemed to give, a groan" (513-14). Just as Ovid has subor dinated magic to emotional conflict earlier in the episode, so here too his addition, "or seemed to give," aut visus est, keeps a certain skeptical distance from the magical event. This use of magic as a reflection of plausible emotional re</page><page sequence="8">8 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC actions is perhaps clearest in the golden apples with which Hippomenes wins Atalanta in book 10. The apples are an obvious instrument of love-magic. They come from a magi cal tree, like that of Virgil's golden bough, which grows in an ancient precinct of Venus on Cyprus (10.644-48). Venus herself is the narrator of the tale, and she is telling it to her beloved, Adonis, in a highly eroticized setting, in order to keep her lover by her side (10.554-59). Just before the race, Atalanta is stirred by strange new feelings (636-37). Hip pomenes, who has already fallen in love with her, prays to Venus for help and receives the apples as his answer (639-43). During the race, Atalanta is distracted by looking at the youth (661-62), which only increases her passion; and this distraction is parallel to her deflection from the course by her desire (cupido) for the shining gold (666-67). As Hip pomenes throws the last apple, he adds a prayer to Venus, who then "compels" the girl to take it up (coegi, 676)? compulsion of the beloved being a standard feature of love magic16?and makes the fruit heavier to increase Atalanta's delay (677-80). As in the case of Meleager's brand, Ovid al lows the magical object its due but at every point keeps in view its narrative role as the conduit of human emotions. These emotions, moreover, are both caused by and embod ied in the narrator herself, the goddess of love; and the nar rative encourages us to interpret the apples as the power of Venus working within Atalanta. The fantastic events and magical objects of this mythical world only set into relief the emotional behaviors in which Ovid grounds his poem. This is one of the few episodes in which the man rather than the woman uses magic, but his impulsiveness undoes the potentially happy ending and causes the newlyweds to spend their honeymoon, and the rest of their lives, as lions in the grove of Cybele. The ending reverses that of the Pyg malion episode earlier in the book, where Aphrodite's gift brings a lasting happiness in marriage. Emotional reality again proves more important than magic's overcoming of re ality.</page><page sequence="9">Charles Segal 9 MAGIC AS A NARRATIVE DEVICE Apart from the Medea and Circe episodes, which we shall discuss in detail later, magic plays a relatively small but not negligible role in the Metamorphoses. The metamorphoses that constitute the poem's subject rarely result from magic but rather from the power of the gods or from supernatural instruments, like Medusa's head in the Perseus episode or the bush into which the nymph Lotis has been transformed in the Dryope episode. Where divinities do employ magical devices, these seem to be extensions of their power, not magic per se. Thus Hermes uses his wand to put Argus to sleep in 1.716, and the disguised Ceres changes a rude boy into a lizard by throwing into his face the water that she has been drinking (5.445-61 ).1^ The shape-shifters who can change their form at will, such as Achelous, Proteus, Thetis, or Vertumnus, do so by an inherent divine power or, like Mestra at the end of book 8, through a special gift of the god. Two metamorphoses, however, do use magic, or the sug gestion of magic, for particular effects. In the Salmacis episode Ovid reverses the motif of the sexually endangered nymph of stream or forest and makes the nymph the aggres sor. In a gesture of sexual impatience that usually character izes the violent male rapist, like Jupiter or Tereus, she attacks her victim, the young Hermaphroditus, in her pool. As she entwines herself about the resisting youth, he be comes fused with her in a parody of sexual union. He prays that any man who enters this water may lose his virility (4.382-88). At once his two divine parents, Mercury and Venus, answer his cry and "infect the spring with an impure drug" (et incesto fontem medicamine tinxit, 4.388).l8 The language suggests magical drugs or poisons, and such dan gerous magic is appropriate to this tale of female lust, so of ten associated with magic in the poem. As in the case of Circe's magic, both in Homer and in Ovid, magic is a threat</page><page sequence="10">io BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC to masculine identity and sexual dominance. In contrast to Circe's poisoning of Scylla's cove, however, magic is only a trace element here.1? In Circe's full-blown magic against Scylla, an incantation, murmured twenty-seven times, ac companies the poisonous drug (14.57-58). Magic is more prominent in the metamorphosis of Arachne in book 6. Angry at Arachne's success in the weav ing contest, Minerva strikes the girl's forehead with her shut tle. Arachne then hangs herself, and Minerva, as she departs, "sprinkled her with the juices of an Hecatean herb; and at once her hair, touched by the grim drug, fell off, along with her nose and ears; her head becomes tiny, and she is small too in her entire body" (6.139-42): post ea discedens sucis Hecateidos herbae sparsit, et extemplo tristi medicamine tactae defluxere comae, cum quis et naris et aures, fitque caput minimum; toto quoque corpore parva est. Why does a powerful goddess like Minerva need this mag ical herb? The detail doubtless serves to enhance our amaze ment and horror at a woman's transformation into a spider, the only insect metamorphosis in the poem.20 The behavior of Minerva just before the metamorphosis suggests another possible answer. The shuttle with which she strikes Arachne's forehead resembles a magical wand. Circe trans forms Picus into a woodpecker by touching him three times with such a wand (ter iuvenem b?culo tetigit, 14.387; cf. Mercury in 1.716). Minerva's use of the shuttle may also re call the wand (rhabdos) of her Homeric counterpart, Athena in the Odyssey, who uses it to beautify and protect her fa vorite hero (16.172-76).2I Athena's wand makes the recipi ent of her power taller and more handsome; Minerva's turns out to be like Circe's: it diminishes and makes ugly. More important, Minerva's violent gesture, combined with the anger at losing the contest (doluit successu, 6.130), reduces her to the level of the wrathful female figure (like</page><page sequence="11">Charles Segal it Circe) who resorts to deadly magic. Minerva displays that anger in her gesture of tearing apart Arachne's work. One expects such wrath from Juno, perhaps, but not from the sage Minerva. In this respect her magical drug harks back to the otiose potions of Tisiphone in book 4 and anticipates Medea and Circe's vengeful use of magic later. In all these cases, magic is particularly associated with fe male passion. It comes at the point where disorder and irra tionality enter into the already fluid world order of the Metamorphoses. The hints of magic in the Hermaphroditus Salmacis story have a similar function, blurring the division between male and female. Similarly in the Arachne episode a goddess not only loses to a mortal competitor but also be haves with the childish anger.22 No divinity in the Metamor phoses fully escapes a demeaning anthropomorphism. Magic is a sign of power, generally irresistible power. Wherever it is applied in the Metamorphoses, its victim is helpless before it. Only Ulysses is an exception, thanks to the protection of the divine gift of moly. When Minerva uses magic against Arachne, the latter's helplessness shows both her victimization and the distance between the goddess and the mortal. When the mortal Medea uses her magic (and she is the only mortal magician who has an extended narrative in the poem), she gains virtually superhuman power. She transcends the limits of her mortal body and like a goddess soars over vast areas of the earth in her serpent-drawn char iot (7.218-35). MEDEA The Medea and Circe episodes contain Ovid's most sus tained accounts of magic. These are both brilliant, complex narratives that have received much critical attention.23 I can only touch on a few relevant details. In both cases magic and love are closely associated but in complementary ways. In Medea's case the change from helpful to destructive magic follows the evolution of a young girl from helpful en</page><page sequence="12">12 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC chantress to murderous witch.24 Circe is a formidable en chantress from the beginning. Her magic is an extension of her susceptibility to desire, her power over men, and her dangerous sexual jealousy and anger. In both cases magic is an instrument for exploring the intricacies and contradic tions of human emotions (especially female emotions) in a remote and fanciful mythical atmosphere. Innocence surrounds Medea's first use of magic: it is a young girl's gift to her first love after her long struggle against her passion (7*9-99). The "ancient altars of Hecate," "shaded grove," and "remote forest" are introduced not as the setting of her magical power but as the place where the flames of her passion are rekindled at the sight of Jason (7.74-88). Jason plights his troth by an oath to Hecate, the goddess of Medea's magic (7.95-97), so that once more Hecate is evoked in connection with love rather than magic per se. By hinting at Jason's exploitation of a young girl to profit from her magical powers, Ovid keeps Medea's inno cence and inexperience in the foreground.25 Such is perhaps the implication of the rapidity with which Jason accepts her herbs once his suit has been successful: creditus accepit can tatas protinus herbas ("Believed, he at once received the herbs over which the enchantments had been sung," 7.98). Medea initially uses her magic to protect her beloved, first from the fire-breathing bulls, then from the warriors who spring up from the dragon's teeth, and finally from the ser pent that guards the golden fleece (7.100-157). Although she is betraying her father, in her youth and innocence she fears for Jason and doubts her own magical powers. With a lover's anxiety she worries that her magic may not be strong enough; and so, despite the first proof of her magic's efficacy (tantum medicamina possunt, "So much power do drugs possess," 116), she adds additional spells (134-39).26 When Jason triumphs, her modesty and concern for her reputation prevent her from joining in the congratulatory embrace that she would like to give (144-47), but she is grateful to her magical spells and its divinities (agisque I carminibus grates</page><page sequence="13">Charles Segal 13 et dis auctoribus horum, "You give thanks to the magical spells and the gods who grant them," 147-48). Her inexpe rience as an enchantress reinforces her innocence. To the same end, when she elopes with Jason, Ovid suppresses her murder of Apsyrtus, which is prominent in both Euripides and Apollonius ( 156-58).2? This mood of innocence introduces Ovid's great show piece of magic in the poem, Medea's rejuvenation of Jason's father, Aeson. Ovid carefully frames this long account of ex otic enchantments with the modesty and innocence of the young practitioner. As in the first episode, the initiative comes from Jason. Speaking in direct discourse for the first time, he echoes Medea's first exhibition of her helpful magic in Colchis (cf. quid enim non carmina possunt, "For what can spells not achieve?" 7.167; tantum medicamina possunt, 116). Medea protests against the violation of the world-or der that such a request implies (171-74); but, as before, she cannot resist Jason and offers to do what she can (experiar). In amusing contrast to this modest disclaimer, however, stands the rhetorical tour de force in which Ovid describes her elaborate preparations and eventual success. Medea's efficacious aid to Jason and her oaths to Hecate (7.92-99, 194-98) suggest that she is already a powerful en chantress. Nevertheless, by reserving the fullest elaboration of her magical arts for this point, when she is using them for a benign purpose at the "pious" request of a husband (7.169), Ovid gives her story a dynamic narrative shape as the apparently inexperienced Colchian girl develops into the dangerous Greco-barbarian witch. This contrast between innocence and experience serves as the foil to the second part of the episode, which now shifts to Medea's darker side, made famous by Euripides' first play, the Peliades, and later by his celebrated Medea (Ovid too, we may recall, wrote a play on Medea). The hesitant, lovesick girl now becomes a full-blown magician, although even the benign magic of her treatment of Aeson contains ominous hints of her future career. She can turn rivers back</page><page sequence="14">14 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC ward, quiet the seas, control the winds, draw down the moon, move rocks and forests, and call the dead from their graves (198-209). Now the serpent-drawn chariot makes its first appearance, and it will have a more sinister role later. Here it merely transports her to far-off places to gather her magical plants. The light mood continues as the dragons get drowsy from the scent of the soporific herbs (236-37). Yet sinister details gradually accumulate: the sacrifice of a black ram and the pouring of its blood into pits; the offerings and prayers to the gods of the lower world; the bacchantic wild ness of Medea herself; the extinguishing of torches in pits filled with blood; the body parts of screech owl, wolf, and lizard, all boiled in a bronze caldron; and finally the cutting of old Aeson's throat (238-86). Ovid has borrowed some of these details from Apollonius: the nocturnal setting, the ram sacrifice, the pits, Hecate, and the atmosphere of awesome supernatural power (Arg. 3.1191-1224, especially 3.1207-18). But in Apollonius it is Jason who performs these sacrifices, instructed by a very hesitant Medea. Ovid's Medea at this point no longer has any scruples. In refocusing the episode on Medea's magical power, moreover, Ovid virtually eliminates Jason. Magic be comes increasingly an expression of the dangers of this pre dominantly female mode of exercising power over life and death. The fatal effect of Medea's last operation, cutting Aeson's throat, is counteracted, of course, by her transfusion of the magical brew to replace the aged blood (7.286-88). Yet Ovid reminds us of the ugly physical reality of these inci sions, and hence of the potentially sinister side of Medea's magic, by adding that Aeson imbibes the magic potion "ei ther by his mouth or his wound" (aut ore acceptos aut vul nere, 288), whereupon he becomes young again. We must remember, however, that up to this point Medea is exercising that magic for the life-preserving task of rejuve nating Aeson and has not yet committed a crime. The first part of the description of her actions is devoted to her wide</page><page sequence="15">Charles Segal 15 travel for gathering herbs (215-37). The sinister touches, like the blood and the screech-owl wings, with all their flesh, are relatively few; and there is no mention of human organs or corpses. When Medea calls the dead forth from their tombs, they are the generalized, decorporealized shades of the dead (manesque exire sepulcris, 206); and they are followed by a list of the benefits of her magic to Jason and her hope of restoring Aeson to the flower of his years (7.210-16).lS She is here a precursor of Lucan's Erictho, but she has little of the necromantic horror of that awesome figure. Comparison with Lucan's Erictho is instructive for the re straint (relatively speaking) with which Ovid uses the magi cal atmosphere that surrounds his Medea. Erictho's almost limitless powers of black magic is the prelude to the night mare world ushered in by Caesar's bloody victory at Phar salus, with its unrestrained lust for slaughter.2? Ovid's proto-witch has a far more limited scope and lacks Lucan's sustained concentration on mutilated corpses, graveyard rot and corruption, cannibalism, and other underworld mon strosities. The murderous side of Medea's magic, when it does emerge, operates for personal motives rather than as a sign of cosmic corruption. In contrast to the relentless hor ror of Erictho's magic, Medea's, for all the length of Ovid's account, has moments of comic relief, such as the sleepy dragons or the brief and amusing digression in which Bac chus wonders whether he might engage Medea's services to rejuvenate his nurses (7.294-96). This lighter scene forms the transition to its ugly sequel, the murder of Pelias. In the Aeson episode Medea initially rejected as criminal (scelus) Jason's plea to add years to his father's life (7.172). She behaves for the moment as if she were the guardian of the established world order and would not interfere with the normal course of nature (as magicians, of course, usually do). The Pelias episode at once strikes the opposite mood. Medea begins as if she were long-practiced in guile and treachery (neve doli cessent, "in order that plots might not come to an end," 7.297). The opening words de</page><page sequence="16">i6 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC scribing her trickery of Pelias' daughters and her feigned quarrel with her husband (odium cum coniuge falsum, 297) suggest that the initiative might have come once more from Jason, but he fades into the background. In the foreground stands Medea's deceit as she insinuates herself into friend ship with Pelias' daughters and tricks them into complicity by her preliminary success with the ram (307-23). This ruse introduces an initial touch of humor that builds suspense and varies the tone. The ram emerges from the cal dron bleating and looking for its mother's udders (7.320-21), as if Aeson might have become a baby again in stead of just losing forty years (292-93). The cutting of the ram's throat recalls the similar operation on Aeson (cf. 314-15 and 285-86); but the cutting of Pelias' throat is elaborated at far greater length and with a conscious sense of the criminality of the act. Pelias' daughters have to steel themselves for the operation on their father and are impelled to it only by Medea's urgings. Medea here combines her arts of persuasion with her arts of magic as she goes on to use her magic to put Pelias and his bodyguards to sleep (324-28). The details of blood and gore that were muted hitherto now have full play. In the case of Aeson, Medea's sword only "allowed the old blood to go out" (veterem exire cruorem passa, 386-87) and drew but "a little blood" from the de crepit ram (exiguo maculavit sanguine ferrum, 315). Pelias, rather like Macbeth's King Duncan, surprisingly for an old man "flows with gore" from his "mutilated body" as he stretches forth his "pale arms amid so many swords" (344-47): semilacerque toro temptat consurgere, et inter tot m?dius gladios pallentia bracchia tendens "quid facitis, gnatae? quis vos in fata parentis armat?" ait: cecidere Ulis animique manusque. Deeply wounded, he tries to rise on his couch and, stretching forth</page><page sequence="17">Charles Segal ij his pale arms in the midst of so many swords, says, "My daughters, what are you doing? Who arms you for the death of your father?" Their spirits and their hands fell. We are reminded again of the injured state of that body (la niatum) which Medea "plunged into the warm water" of her caldron, as if she were cooking him instead of her herbs (et calidis laniatum mer sit in undis, 3 49). 3? Aeson's rejuvena tion contained no mention of the caldron (285-94). In her deceptive experiment on the ram she placed both animal and potion together in the caldron (316-17), so that the detail of the hot water in the case of Pelias reminds us that this cal dron contains only hot water and no medicinal herbs. The many parallels between the renewing of Aeson's life and the bloody termination of Pelias' set off her abrupt shift from benign to evil enchantress. These parallels include the flashing stars on the fourth night (197, 187, and 325-26), the victim's sleep (253-54 and 325-26), the caldron (262-63 and 327), and the cutting of the throat (285-86 and 342-49). In Aeson's case the victim himself is put to sleep; in the case of Pelias the guards are immobilized (328-30), and the unfortunate king awakens and lifts himself on his elbow to find himself in the midst of being murdered (343-47). Medea herself slits Aeson's throat when she "sees" that her preparations are ready (285-86); Pelias' daughters avert their eyes (340-42)^ * Medea herself finishes off the tor mented victim by slashing his throat in the midst of his at tempt to speak (plura locuturo cum verbis guttura Colchis I abstulit, 348-49; cf. 285-86). The possibility of committing a crime (scelus, 7.172) aroused Medea's indignation when Jason asked her to reju venate Aeson, but the horrific scelus (7.340) of her murder of Pelias fully reveals her darker side. Her plunge into evil magic is also signaled by the perversion of pietas. A son's plea of pietas moved Medea to use her magic to restore Ae son's youth (169); now she manipulates the pietas of Pelias' reluctant daughters to impel them to the patricidal deed</page><page sequence="18">18 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC (335-40). Now too the dragon-borne chariot that initially served Medea only as a vehicle for gathering herbs is the necessary means of flight from punishment (350-51). This journey from Iolcus to Corinth marks a sharp break in narrative continuity. The journey is the occasion for a list of rather obscure metamorphoses (357-93). When Medea's tale resumes, she is the evil enchantress of Euripides' play who destroys her rival with poison, burns down the palace, and has a sword "flowing with the blood of her children" (394-96). She is now fully launched on her criminal career. Correspondingly, the beneficent magic of her first gathering of herbs becomes sinister. To poison Theseus in Athens, she mixes the deadly aconite that she brought from Scythia, whose virulence derives from its chthonic origins as the foam of the rabid Cerberus' jaws as he struggled against his captor, Hercules (408-18). This addition of chthonic monstrosity to magical spells resembles the dread Tisiphone's use of the snakes of the monstrous Erinys' hair for the "Furies' poison" in order to drive Athamas and Ino to madness (furiale ve nenum, 4.490-507). As Medea steadily degenerates from helpful enchantress to homicidal witch, her initially restora tive herbs become poisons, as she herself becomes an expert poisoner.3 2- Ven?fica, fabricator of poisons, was her epithet when she rejuvenated the old ram to trick Pelias' daughters (7.316), and it marks the shift in the kind of magic that she practices. The word veneficus, which carries serious implica tions of criminal behavior, occurs only here in the poem. 3 3 The story of Aegeus and Theseus is the reverse of that of Pelias and his daughters. Aegeus recognizes his son just in time to foil Medea's murderous plot; but Medea escapes with a final act of magic as she uses her spells to cover her self in mist (effugit ilia necem nebulis per carmina motis, 7.424). This magically induced mist anticipates Circe's magic against Picus (cf. 14.368-71). This is Medea's third escape from capital punishment (cf. 7.350-51, 397-99)^ and Ovid not only varies her technique but moves it further into the area of darker supernatural power. Her initially benign</page><page sequence="19">Charles Segal 19 use of magic to manipulate the boundaries between the hu man and natural worlds, to transcend the limits of the hu man body, and to defy nature's power over mortal life in the Aeson episode now degenerates into the familiar practices of the dangerous witch. CIRCE Augustan poets often associate Circe and Medea as the two major practitioners of magic, especially love-magic (e.g. Tibullus 2.4.55-60). The Metamorphoses follows this ten dency by allotting them the two longest descriptions of magic in the poem. Ovid connects the two enchantresses through the power of magical herbs and mists (cf. 7.116, 167, 424 and 13.942, 14.295, 368-71), but he establishes an even closer link by having Medea gather some of her herbs from the shore at Anthedon, which had "not yet been made widely known by the transformation of Glaucus' body" (7.233). This "not yet," nondum, anticipates the tale of Glaucus that will introduce Circe at the end of book 13.34 Like Jason in book 7, Glaucus asks an enchantress for help (cf. 7.164-66 and 14.12-14), and in both cases the results will prove disastrous. Glaucus' request specifically for love magic, however, reveals the aggressive and destructive mo tives that often lie behind such love-charms (14.20-24): at tu, sive aliquod regnum est in carmine, carmen ore move sacro, sive expugnacior herba est, utere temptatis operosae viribus herbae. nee medeare mihi sanesque haec vulnera mando, fineque nihil opus est: partem ferat ilia caloris. If there is any power in spells, set spells into motion with your sa cred mouth; or, if herbs are more powerful in fighting her, use the tested power of effective herbs. Nor do I ask you to cure me and heal these wounds, and I have no need of an end [to my love]: let her endure her share of the passion.</page><page sequence="20">20 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC Glaucus wants to inflict his own pain on Scylla.3 5 This brilliant transition to Circe, via the amorous Glaucus, maintains the continuity with the marine settings of book 13 and anticipates the role of magic in book 14. It also con trasts the upward direction of the magical transformation in Glaucus' own story in book 13 (human changed to god) with the predominantly downward metamorphoses of Circe's magic (human changed to monster or animal). As in the case of Medea, Glaucus' contact with magic is initially beneficent. A humble Euboean fisherman, he is astounded to see his fish revivified by their contact with the plants on which he has placed them (13.936-39). When he tests these herbs on himself, he bids farewell to the land and is soon af ter purged of his mortality. The purification and the change from mortality to divinity anticipate the upward direction of metamorphoses in the apotheoses of Aeneas, Romulus, and Julius and Augustus Caesar at the end of the poem. Glaucus' herbs renew rather than destroy life and increase rather than diminish his capacities.36 Sinister associations, however, are still present. The un touched meadow where Glaucus finds the herbs is often a prelude to the violation or the loss of innocence, as in fact soon proves the case for Scylla in the next book.37 His pu rification by the sea divinities in a magical ceremony in which Ocean and Tethys recite a charm over him nine times and then pour over his head the water of a hundred rivers (13.950-55) seems to imply that there may be something im pure about the power of these herbs. His strange fishy tail leaves Scylla wondering whether he is in fact "a god or a monster" (13.912-15)?an impression that Glaucus tries to forestall when he introduces himself to her (13.917-18): non ego prodigium nee sum fera belua, virgo, I sed deus, inquit, aquae ... ("I am not a monstrous prodigy nor a wild crea ture, O maiden, but a god of the water"). Scylla, however, is not convinced and promptly departs, whereupon Glaucus' monstrous and impure tendencies take over in the furor that ends the book and drives him to "seek the wondrous halls of Titan-descended Circe" (furit Ule inritatusque repulsa I</page><page sequence="21">Charles Segal 21 prodigiosa petit Titanidos atria Circes, 13.967-68). The ep ithet of Circe's palace, prodigiosa, harks back to Glaucus' denial of his monstrosity (non ego prodigium, 13.917) and suggests remnants of monstrosity in him that both lead him to Circe and suggest some affinities with her. Magic and furor, as in the case of Virgil's Dido, go together. Glaucus' journey to find Circe takes us to a realm of mon strous, primordial, pre-civilized powers that are associated with magic.38 Circe herself belongs to the race of Titans (13.968); and to find her Glaucus leaves "Aetna that has been hurled upon the jaws of Giants and the fields of the Cy clopes ignorant of the uses of hoe and plow" (14.1-2). The halls of this "daughter of the Sun" are not just vaguely prodigiosa (13.968) but "full of different wild beasts" (atria . . . Sole satae Circes variarum plena fer arum, 14.9-10). Ovid enhances these associations by playing two registers of myth against one another: a Greek and particularly Odyssean register of fantastic creatures, and a Roman and particularly Virgilian register of origins, foundations, and history.39 The shift from the Italian setting to a remote world of magic and monstrosity is all the more intense because the narrative has been following its Roman and historical strand and breaks off in an apparent digression at the entrance of Scylla at 13.730. Glaucus' journey at the beginning of book 14, furthermore, closely echoes that of Virgil's Aeneas as he travels from Sicily to Rome. But this "historical" journey from Troy to Italy is paradoxically also a reverse journey, backwards on the axis of literary history from the Aeneid to the Odyssey, and so from a historical foundation to a wholly mythical world. In accordance with this mood of myth and fantasy, Macareus' account of Circe's magic not only adds bears to the Odyssey's "mountain wolves and li ons" (Od. 11.213) but also hyperbolically increases the number of wolves to a thousand (Met. 14.25 5).4? As in the case of Medea in book 7, Circe's magic initially has a calmer and quieter tone in the first detailed description of her household, where her nymphs' domestic arts consist in sorting magical herbs rather than spinning or weaving</page><page sequence="22">22 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC (14.264-70). The replacement of domestic chores by magic is an amusing variation on scenes in which a nymph either abandons weaving (or analogous premarital pursuits) for hunting (like Daphne or Callisto, 1.474-87, 3.411-16) or else prefers coquettish adornments to hunting (like Salmacis, 4.302-15). In Circe's case, the preferred activity is, of course, magic. The retarding and regressive role of Circe stands out all the more clearly in the contrast with the Sibyl episode in 14.101-53. The Sibyl obviously belongs to the forward moving progression of Aeneas' journey as it appears in Aeneid 6, with its descent to the Underworld and its prophetic view of Aeneas' future descendants. Ovid adds a characteristically erotic motif to the Virgilian story; but, even so, the Sibyl's celibacy offers a model of female behav ior that is antithetical to Circe (14.133-42). After Glaucus' disastrous encounter with Circe the narra tive returns again to Aeneas and the Aeneid (14.75-153), only to plunge back into the Odyssean account of Circe's transformations of Odysseus' companions and then to an analogous metamorphosis on Roman soil in her transforma tion of Picus. Ovid, running together the Aeneid and the Odyssey in Macareus' narrative, follows Virgil in having Ae neas warned away from Circe (Aen. 7.21-24; cf. Met. 14.244-47), but then relates at length two close encounters with Circe's magic, the familiar Greek story of Odysseus and a much expanded version of the Virgilian story of Picus.41 In all of these tales in books 13-14 the edifying "historical" ac count of the founding of Rome pales beside the intensity of the passions, especially the erotic passions, a subject that many readers will feel is more congenial to Ovid and to the spirit of his poem. Both the Scylla and the Picus episodes combine the power of love and the power of magic. Ovid varies the two episodes by a change of setting, seashore for Glaucus, forest for Picus; but the plot is essentially the same. In both tales Circe is a highly eroticized figure, susceptible to love at first sight. Glaucus introduces himself to Circe by acknowledging her power over magical herbs (quanta sit herbarum, Titani,</page><page sequence="23">Charles Segal 23 potentia . . . , 14.14), which she will soon turn against his beloved, Scylla. Glaucus, bewailing his lost love, leaves the scene (and the narrative) in flight from an enchantress who "has too aggressively used her power over herbs" (flevit amans Glaucus nimiumque hostiliter usae I viribus herbarum fugit conubia Circes, 14.68-69). Circe's first re sponse to disappointment in love in fact is to grind herbs into a deadly potion and "mingle Hecatean spells with the herbs that she has ground up" (14.42-44). Later in book 14 Circe is so smitten at the sight of Picus that she drops the magical herbs that she has been gathering in the forest. When she recovers her senses ("knows her self"), her first thought is of the power of her magical herbs and spells (14.349-57, especially 356-57, si modo me novi, si non evanuit omnis I herbarum virtus nee me mea carmina fallunt, "if I recognize myself, if all the power of herbs has not disappeared and my spells do not fail me"). The re peated epithets Titanis and Titania in this context (14.376, 382) hark back to her dangerous ancestry at the beginning of her involvement with Glaucus (13.968). Magic in the Circe episode is again a transparent window on the emotions, enabling Circe instantly to translate into action her jealous wishes for the sexual degradation of her rival. She directs her jealous revenge against Scylla's erst while beauty and sexual appeal. Scylla's sexual parts become particularly ugly and fearful; and her transformation into a horrible monster is a grotesque version of sexual violation and birth: "Her loins are befouled by barking monsters," and "she holds down the backs of the beasts in her mutilated loins and protruding womb" (14.60, 66-67).42 When Picus rejects Circe, she responds with a dire warning about a woman scorned in love ( "laesaque quid faciat, quid amans, quid femina, disces I rebus" ait, used amans et laesa et fem ina Circe," "'You will learn by events what an injured woman, a woman in love, a woman can do,' she says, 'and Circe is in love and injured and a woman,'" 14.384-85)^3 When Circe falls in love with Glaucus, she retaliates against her rival (14.40-42); in the case of Picus she retali</page><page sequence="24">24 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC ates directly against the object of her passion. Nevertheless, both of Circe's failures bear out the point that we noted ear lier: for Ovid magic cannot compel genuine love. Hence there is a sharp contrast between the flames of desire that "seem to wander over (Circe's) marrows" when she sees Pi cus (14.351, per totas visa est errare medullas) and Canens' wasting away with ultimate grief when her "thin marrow turned to liquid" as she mourns over her lost husband (14.431-32, tenues liquefacta medullas I tabuit). Canens' metamorphosis too differs from that of Scylla and Picus: it results not from the jealous Circe's exercise of her magic but from her own loss and sorrow (14.416-34). As in a pyrotechnic display, Ovid accumulates the most spectacular magic for the end.44 In her revenge on Picus she draws on more elaborate parts of her magical repertory. She fashions an image of a boar and utters incantations that can darken the moon, draw down rain clouds, and cover the face of the sky (14.357-71). Her prayer "to unknown gods in an unknown spell" enhances the mystery of this magic (367)^5 To metamorphose Picus she turns twice to the west, twice to the east, and then touches him three times with her wand as she recites three spells (386-88). His followers can find her only because she permits the clouds and darkness to disperse (399-400). She then scatters about poisonous po tions, as she had in the case of Scylla (venenis, 14.403 and 55-56) and, with invocations to chthonic powers and Hecate, fills the forest with horrors and then changes them all into "the monstrous forms of wild beasts . . . and no one kept his own shape" (14.299-415). In contrast to this exuberance of magical devices, Circe's metamorphosis of Odysseus' companions is relatively re strained. A drugged drink and a touch of the wand suffice (14.270-78, 295-96). This episode comes between the tales of Glaucus and Picus, and here Ovid follows his famous Homeric model, perhaps to set off his originality in the other two adventures. Like Homer, Ovid emphasizes the corporeal changes in the men rather than the magic itself (14.279-86);</page><page sequence="25">Charles Segal 25 but Macareus' first-person narrative (in contrast to 289-98) gives these physical details a more bizarre and more humor ous tone. Macareus, not unreasonably, is embarrassed to tell about the bristles that grew over his skin and the "broad snout" of a pig with which he "felt (his) mouth grow hard" (et pudet et referam), saetis horrescere coepi . . . I osque meum sensi pando occallescere rostro, 14.279, 282). Ovid exploits first-person narrative for the same effects in the metamorphosis back into human shape (14.299-305). In contrast to the initial metamorphosis of Odysseus' compan ions, however, this undoing of the spell allows greater scope to magic. Macareus tells of the benign herbs with which they are now sprinkled, the opposite end of the wand with which they are struck, and the "words that are spoken to counter the words previously spoken" (14.299-301): spargimur ignotae sucis melioribus herbae percutimurque caput conversae verbere virgae, verbaque dicuntur dictis contraria verbis. The balanced repetitions of 301 convey the way in which the magical antidote now cancels out the initial enchant ment. Ovid enhances the humor by detailing the gradual un doing of the previous magic as Circe utters her incantations. The more she sings, the more her victims regain their human stature (14.302-5): quo magis ilia canit, magis hoc tellure levati erigimur, saetaeque cadunt, bifidosque relinquit rima pedes, redeunt umeri et subiecta lacertis bracchia sunt. The more she sings, the more we are lifted up and arise from the earth, and our bristles fall off and the cleft leaves our divided hooves, our shoulders return, and arms are once more placed be neath them.</page><page sequence="26">26 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC This detailed description of reverse metamorphosis is one of Ovid's favorite devices (Io's change back to her human form offers a close parallel 1.738-46); but in book 14 Ovid adapts this motif to the magical setting by having the rever sal obey the power of Circe's spells. By saving Circe's darkest and most sensational magic to the end of her story, Ovid outdoes the relatively low-keyed and familiar metamorphic magic of the Odyssey's narrative and creates a wealth of new and colorful details. In like manner, he sharpens the contrast between his poem and the Aeneid, whose story he resumes immediately after the Picus Canens episode with the burial of Aeneas' nurse, Caieta (14.441-43; cf. Aen. 7.189-91). By expanding the details of both magic and metamorphosis far beyond Virgil, Ovid re stamps the Virgilian material with the distinctive atmosphere of his own poem, and particularly with his recurrent theme of the crossing of boundaries between human and bestial through metamorphosis. WHITE MAGIC AND ORPHIC ART Ovid's most original recasting of the Homeric and Virgilian narratives lies in his contrast between Circe's destructive magic and the lighter, "Orphic" magic of the faithful wife of Picus, Canens. Canens also has magical power over nature, but she uses it with a far more benign sympathy, and so she finally melts away into the winds as she sings her songs of grief for her lost husband. Circe's magic reflects an aspect of Ovid's own power as poet to transfigure the existing forms of reality through the imaginative power of mythic metamorphoses. Nulli sua mansit imago ("No one keeps his own form," 14.415): the Circe episode ends with total metamorphosis; and Circe her self embodies one of the dynamic principles of the poem, the power to manipulate the instability and vulnerability of the human form in a world of passion, violence, and unpre dictable change.</page><page sequence="27">Charles Segal 27 Yet there is a more positive model for poetry's magic and transformative power in the figure of Canens. Circe's ag gressive control over nature, like Medea's (7.200-2), makes forests leap from their places, trees grow pale, and rocks ut ter harsh groans (14.407-9). Canens, by contrast, exercises her power over nature by her "art of singing" rather than by casting spells. Through this gentler art of song (from which she has her name) Canens stirs both animate and inanimate nature in sympathetic harmony (14.337-40): rara quidem facie, sed rarior arte canendi, unde Canens dicta est: silvas et saxa mover? et mulcere feras et flumina longa morari ore suo volucresque vagas reti?ere solebat. She is rare in her beauty, but rarer still in her art of singing, whence she is called Canens: she was wont to move forests and rocks and soothe wild beasts, stay long rivers by her voice, and hold the wan dering birds. As she holds Picus' affection by faithful devotion, not magic, so too her voice, as her name implies, has the beauty of fem inine song rather than the supernatural spells of a Titan born enchantress (cf. 341, dum fem?nea modulatur carmina voce-, also 337, arte canendv, 340, ore suo, above). Her story too unites love and magic, but in a way exactly complemen tary to their interrelation in Circe. As true love, for Ovid, is not won by magic (see Rem. Am. 249-50, above), so the highest art is attained by harmony with nature rather than aggressive mastery of it. Canens closely resembles Orpheus in her grief for her lost beloved (see 14.422-30), and she also resembles that arche typal poet in the mode of her artistry. Hers is an Orphic art that moves nature by a spontaneous, preexisting sympathy rather than by a willed and conscious attempt to assert con trol over natural forces for her own ends. Like Orpheus and other artist-figures, such as Daedalus and Pygmalion, Ca</page><page sequence="28">28 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC nens possesses the creative power to cross the boundaries be tween matter and spirit, and this is also the creative power of art.46 As Medea and Circe show, however, it is also a po tentially dangerous and transgressive power. Canens resembles Orpheus, and other suffering lovers of the poem, in the subordination of magic to devotion, of pas sion to mortal grief, and of transcendence of nature to the immersion in nature. Besides her obvious contrast with her rival, Circe, she also invites comparison with the two other devoted wives of Italian rulers who suffer the deaths of their husbands in these last books, namely Hersilia, wife of Ro mulus, and Egeria, wife of Numa. At the very end of book 14, Hersilia, wife of Romulus, laments over her "lost hus band" like Canens and Egeria; but now Juno, in a self-con scious reversal of the end of Aeneid 4, sends Iris to perform a catasterism and eventually to reunite her with the divinized Romulus (14.829-51). Numa's wife, Egeria, in book 15 is not divinized but re ceives something "eternal" in her metamorphosis into the "eternal waters" of a spring (aeternas . . . in undas). Yet Di ana grants even this metamorphosis (15.547-51) only after Virbius/Hippolytus' tale of his rather ambiguous immortal ization fails to console. To Egeria Diana gives transforma tion into part of the natural world; to Hippolytus she gave eternal life as one of the lesser gods (15.545), but did not permit his translation to the heavens. Canens resembles Ege ria in her wasting away with grief after Circe has changed Picus into a woodpecker in a heavily mythicized framework, the tale that Macareus tells in the house of Circe. Canens un dergoes what we could call a zero grade of metamorphosis as she sings her dying swan song (ut olim I carmina iam moriens canit exequalia cygnus, 14.429-30) and then wastes away into the light winds (luctibus extremum tenues lique facta medullas I tabuit inque leves paulatim evanuit auras, 14.431-32; cf. Egeria in 15.549-51). In these three closely related tales of female grief?Canens, Hersilia, and Egeria?Ovid not only sets out the varying</page><page sequence="29">Charles Segal 29 kinds and degrees in which the bereaved women of the poem may suffer or transcend their mortality, but also harks back to his Orpheus episode in interweaving the magic of art with the power of love and of death. This closing section of his poem frames Pythagoras' speech on endless change and metempsychosis with the apotheoses of Romulus, Hippoly tus/Virbius, and finally Julius and Augustus Caesar. Here mortality and apotheosis crisscross in a way that also fore shadows Ovid's own first-person acknowledgment of the death of his body in the midst of the triumphant eternity of his poem at the end. Numa simply dies and is lamented by his people (15.485-87). Pythagoras offers a philosophical scientific mode of escaping death in his theory of metempsy chosis. This, in turn, is juxtaposed to the two modes of evading mortality that belong to Ovid/narrator in this clos ing portion of the poem, the ideologically sanctioned apoth eoses of "historical" figures like Romulus and the Julian emperors, and the purely mythical and metamorphic stories of figures like Hippolytus and Egeria, even though these now take place close to Rome, on Italian soil. Although Ca nens is closer to myth than to history and to magic than to conjugal mortality, her end, nevertheless, distances her from Circean magic and brings her closer to the historical (or more historical) world of Numa's Egeria. That is to say, for Ovid magic, paradoxically, like metamorphosis, can also be a way of getting closer to reality, a way of exploring poetic creativity as a mode of getting at human truths parallel to the lessons and achievements of history. Shakespeare exploits the symbolic affinity between magi cal arts and the arts of poetry that goes back as far as the Homeric thelxis when he draws on Ovid's long account of Medea's magic spells for the magical power of Prospero at the end of The Tempest (Act 5, scene i).47 But just as Pros pero will abjure the "rough magic" of his "so potent art" and would drown his book "deeper than ever did plummet sound" only after so exuberantly evoking all its wondrous power, so too Ovid shows us the gentler side of magic in Ca</page><page sequence="30">30 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC nens only after fully exhibiting (and poetically reveling in) the dark powers of Circe. For all his skill and pleasure in evoking the fantastic power of these magical spells over wind and water, sky and underworld, Ovid knows that they constitute a language of symbols for both the transformative power of his own art and the darker reaches of the human soul?the world of art, emotions, and the passions that, in the last analysis, is the real subject of the Metamorphoses.^ NOTES i.

Tupet (note 6), 414-16, suggests that this episode is more "religious" than "magical," but that distinction is of dubious validity: see Christopher A. Faraone and Dirk Obink, eds., Magika Hiera: Ancient Greek Magic and Religion (New York and Oxford 1991), 20; Jan M. Bremmer, "The Birth of</page><page sequence="31">Charles Segal 31 the Term 'Magic,'" ZPE 126 (1999), 1-12, especially 9-12 with the refer ences there cited. n. See Tupet (note 6), 177 and 197-99. 12. Met. 2.793-811 and 819-32; 8.814-29. On the two scenes see Charles P. Segal, "Ovid's Metamorphic Bodies: Art, Gender, and Violence in the Metamorphoses," Arion 5.3 (1998), 15-16. 13. On the positive side of divine power too, Homer's Athena in the Odyssey both uses and does not use a wand to transform Odysseus: see below, n.21. 14. For this recasting of magic into maternal emotion see Charles P. Segal, "Ovid's Meleager and the Greeks: Trials of Gender and Genre," HSCP 99, (1999), 321-22, 325-29. 15. See Segal (note 14), 325-26. 16. See, e.g., John J. Winkler, The Constraints of Desire (New York and London 1990), 94-97; Christopher A. Faraone, Ancient Greek Love Magic (Cambridge, MA 1999), 53-55. 17. On Mercury's virga in 1.716 see Charles P. Segal, "Ovid's Arcadia and the Characterization of Jupiter in the Metamorphoses," in W. Schubert, ed., Ovid: Werk und Wirkung: Festgabe f?r Michael von Albrecht zum 65. Geburtstag, Studien zur klassische Philologie, vol. 100 (Frankfurt 1999), 410-11. 18. The text of Met. 4.388 is not fully certain: see W. S. Anderson, Ovid's Metamorphoses: Books 1-5, (Norman, ok 1997), ad loc, who (as in his Teubner edition) prefers the alternative reading incerto, referring to "the sexual ambiguity of the hermaphrodite." Richard Tarrant, however, reads incesto in his forthcoming Oxford Classical Text, which he has generously allowed me to see in advance of publication. 19. The Scylla episode, however, also uses similar language of corruption or pollution for Circe's magic: cf. praevitiat, inquinat, 14.55-56. 20. See A. M. Tupet, "La magie dans la m?tamorphose d'Arachn?," in J. M. Fr?caut, and Danielle Porte, eds., Journ?es ovidiennes de Parm?nie, Collection Latomus 189, (Brussels 1985), 224. She suggests that Ovid may be using a source now lost (225-27), but such a view does not account for why Ovid would so depart from his usual practice of metamorphoses by gods. 21. Athena needs no magical wand, however, to enhance Odysseus' stature in Od. 7.230-35 = 23.157-62, where she merely pours beauty over him. In 16.456-57 she uses her wand again to reverse the transformation and change Odysseus back into an old beggar. 22. For the implications of Minerva's violent destruction of mortal art work for Ovid's own poetry see Alessandro Barchiesi, II poeta e il principe (Bari 1994), 265-66. 23. For recent study and bibliography on Medea see Alain Moreau, Le mythe de Jason et M?d?e (Paris 1994), 208-12; for Circe see Judith Yarnall, Transformations of Circe (Urbana and Chicago 1994), 87-91.</page><page sequence="32">32 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC 24. Moreau (note 23), 210 observes that magic provides the constant ele ment in the disparate sequence of Medea's adventures in book 7. On the inconsistencies of subject and mood in the Medea narrative see also G. K. Galinsky, Ovid's Metamorphoses (Oxford 1975), 64-66. 25. In Met. 7.86-94 Ovid keeps Jason in the background and focuses on Medea and her love-smitten state. Thus he keeps Jason silent and has Medea ask him to swear his fidelity by Hecate (servabere mu?ere nostro: I servatus promissa dato, "You will be saved by our effort; after you have been saved fulfill your promise," 7.93-94). In Apollonius, however, whom Ovid is closely following but greatly condensing, it is Jason who makes the prom ises of marriage (in direct discourse) and of his own accord takes an oath by Hecate (Arg. 3.985-92, 1120-30). 26. Ovid here gives a very different tone to Apollonius' generalization on the power of magic in Arg. 3.1305, Koupri? ?? ? ^apiicnc' ?pwo ("and the magical drugs of the girl saved him"). In Apollonius this is merely a factual statement, whereas in Ovid it is imbued by her concern for her beloved. 27. See Met. 7.51 and 155-58; cf. Eur., Med. 166-67 and I334; Apollon., Arg. 4.445-81 (where, however, the actual killing is done by Jason). On Ovid's elimination of Apsyrtus' death see W. S. Anderson, Ovid's Metamorphoses: Books 6-10 (Norman, OK 1972), ad Met. 7.51. 28. Medea uses blood in her magic, but there are only two brief refer ences, 7.245 and 259, with no detail. Similarly the body parts that she employs are those of animals (screech owl, wolf, lizard, deer, and crow, 269-74). The only physical details are the "notorious wings of the screech owl with the very flesh," et strigis infames ipsis cum carnibus alas. With this brief list contrast, for example, Lucan's Erictho, 6.667-84. Similarly with Ovid's brief mention of the dead in Met. 7.206 contrast Lucan 6.529-58 and 637-71. On the other hand, Lucan's necromantic Erictho perhaps owes something to this poisonous chthonic atmosphere surrounding Ovid's Tisiphone in book 4 (see supra). 29. Compare Met. 7.206 and Lucan 6.529-68, 637-71; Met. 7. 269-74 and Lucan 6.667-84. Lucan's Erictho has often been discussed; for a recent discussion from the point of view of her necromantic magic see Graf (note 7), 190-94, 200-4. 30. See Anderson (note 27), ad loc. 31. Contrast Procne at the murder of her son, who refuses to turn her gaze away, Met. 6.642. 32. Cf. 7.394, sed postquam Colchis arsit nova nupta venenis, "but after Colchian Medea, a new bride, blazed forth with her poisons." The poisons, venena, associated with Medea earlier, in 7.123 and 209, also have more benign associations. 33. Cf. the lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis of 81 bce, on which see Graf (note 7), 46-48. In 14.365 the less authoritative MSS. read verba ven?fica to describe the spell of Circe in her attempted seduction of Picus (see infra), but most recent editors favor the reading of the better MSS., verba precantia (so Anderson, Borner, Tarrant). Possibly the Medea passage is</page><page sequence="33">Charles Segal 33 responsible for the alternative reading here in 14.365, given the connections that the poem makes between the two enchantresses. 34. Medea's reference to Scylla in 7.64-65 is perhaps another foreshad owing of the connection of her story with that of Circe. 35. See, e.g., Faraone (note 16), 13-14, 41-42, 49-69; Winkler (note 16), 78-79, 87-98. Such love magic was notoriously dangerous: see Faraone (note 16), 112-19. The most famous literary example is perhaps the love charm from Nessus that Deianeira uses, with fatal results, in Sophocles' Trachinian Women. 36. Dante perhaps recognized the upward implications of Glaucus' meta morphosis when he uses the myth to describe the transfiguration (tran sumanar) of Dante-Pilgrim as Beatrice leads him into Paradise (Paradiso 1.67-72). 37. On the landscape of violated innocence here see Charles P. Segal, Landscape in Ovid's Metamorphoses, Hermes Einzelschrift 23 (Wiesbaden 1969), 58-62. 38. Circe's associations with magic are commonplace: e.g., Amores 1.8.5-7, 3.7.79-80. 39. For the nationalistic and historical concerns of the Roman epic norm see Gian Biagio Conte, The Rhetoric of Imitiation, ed. C. Segal (Ithaca, NY 1986), 142-70. 40. Cf. h. Ven. 69-72, where panthers and bears follow upon the wolves and lions in Aphrodite's entourage as she goes to her rendezvous with Anchises. 41. Picus' story is also characteristically Ovidian in its use of a tale within-a-tale narration: one of Circe's maids told it to Macareus, who is telling it to Achaemenides (14.318-434). On Ovid's deliberate modification of the Virgilian account see Segal (note 4), 437-41 and Galinsky (note 24), 234. On the Virgilian Circe see Putnam (note 4), 103-6. 42. On this feature of Scylla's metamorphosis and its implications of sex ual violation see Segal (note 12), 31-32. 43. Cf. Deianira's similarly jealous appeal to femineus dolor, 9.150-51. 44. See Yarnall (note 23), 89-90 ("the most impressive magic show in the Metamorphoses," 89). Hermann Fr?nkel, Ovid: A Poet Between Two Worlds, Sather Classical Lectures 18 (Berkeley and Los Angeles 1956), 105 took a less favorable view: "cheap operatic profusion." See also Segal (note 4), 442 and Segal (note 37), 67-68. 45. Unknown words often occur on magical papyri: see Tupet (note 6), 396-97. Cf. Circe's transformation of Scylla in 14.57-58: obscurum verbo rum ambage novorum I ter noviens carmen m?gico demurmurat ore. Cf. also Lucan 6.686-87. Nevertheless, Ovid's presentation of Circe's magic is more literary than technical: see Franz B?mer, ed., P. Ovidius Naso, Metamorphosen (Heidelberg 1969-86, 7 vols.), ad Met. 14.266 and 14.386. 46. For metamorphosis and the transformative power of magic in its rela</page><page sequence="34">34 BLACK AND WHITE MAGIC tion to the creative processes of art see Viarre (note 5), 197, 206-8 (Orpheus as an "artiste magicien"); also Segal (note 12), 16-18; Valerie Wise, "Ovid's Medea and the Magic of Language," Ramus 11, (1982), 21, apropos of Medea; Yarnall (note 23), 88, apropos of Circe. 47. For Shakespeare's probable indebtedness to Ovid here see Charles Martindale, ed., Ovid Renewed (Cambridge 1988), 18-19. 48. This essay is a revised version of my paper, "Tantum medicamina pos sunt.
