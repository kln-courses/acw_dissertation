<plain_text><page sequence="1">Before The Human Rata Robert Antelme's Anthropomorphic Poetry SARA GUYER In the Spring of 1944, one month before the Gestapo arrested him, sending him first to the prison at Fresnes and then deporting him to Buchenwald and Dachau, Robert Antelme published four poems in Littérature, a newly inaugurated - and ultimately short-lived - literary journal. The journal, which appeared only in that year, aimed to present the work of young French writers.1 As the editor, René Julliard explains in a preface to the first issue, Littérature did not represent a particular 'school', and authors were not bound by restrictions of page numbers or genre. In each issue - which included poems, stories, plays, and essays - the contributions were organized alphabetically, according to the author's name.2 Antelme intended the poems that appeared in Littérature to be part of a collection, which he tentatively called Les mains aux grilles [Hands on the Bars]. Had he not been deported, it is possible that Antelme would have become a poet. Yet the collection that he imagined never appeared. In place of the book of poems, Antelme came to write L 'espèce humaine [The Human Race], an account of his experience as a prisoner in Buchenwald, Gandersheim (one of Buchenwald's subcamps) and Dachau. In France, L 'espèce humaine stands as the exemplary account of the experience of the camps. Maurice Nadeau has called it 'one of the great books written about the camps', comparable only with Primo Levi's Survival in Auschwitz and David Rousset's Les Jours de notre mort ? Edgar Morin singles out Antelme's testimony as 'the first - 1 would even say the only book - that stands firmly at the level of humanity, at the level of naked experience lived and expressed in the simplest, most adequate words there are.'4 Morin goes on to acknowledge that although Antelme's testimony is a work of 'antiliterature (since, very rightly the author didn't want to make literature out of the camps)', it is also 'a book of pure literature ... Critical Survey Volume 20, Number 2, 2008: 31-42 doi: 10.3 167/CS.2008.200204 ISSN 001 1-1570 (Print), ISSN 1752-2293 (Online)</page><page sequence="2">32 Critical Survey, Volume 20, Number 2 after it there was nothing more that one could write'.5 Nadeau's and Morin's assessments of L 'espèce humaine suggest that the difference between Antelme's poems and his testimony (first published in 1947, and reissued by Gallimard ten years later) is profound. That difference, far from unaccountable, can be explained as the difference between poetry and testimony more generally. In this case, the difference between work that emerged while Antelme participated in the French Resistance, specifically François Mitterrand's group, the Mouvement national des prisonniers de guerre (MNPDG), and work that accounts for the relatively short, yet brutal period during which he was in the camps. Yet this distinction, which assumes the non- representational character of poetry and the representational character of testimony also seems inadequate, not least because both of Antelme's works - pre- and post-deportation - rely upon an act of rhetorical staging: the positing of a non-speaking or non-human entity as one who lives and speaks as a man. Stylistically speaking, although both Antelme's poems and his testimony clearly thematise the violence of war and genocide, the poems - which include 'Le Train', 'Monologue du Sang', 'Les Deux,' and 'Fôret' - present this violence in enigmatic, surrealistic, and even prophetic ways, while L 'espèce humaine has been noted for the frankness of its description and its thoroughgoing refusal to obscure the world it recalls.6 To read Antelme's poems after L'espèce humaine is at once startling and instructive. In his testimony, Antelme insists upon the irremissibility of the human, the human as the limit of destruction (or aspiration), explaining that in the camps he discovered that 'the executioner's power cannot be other than one of the powers that men have, the power of murder. He can kill a man, but he can't change him into something else' (HR 220). Maurice Blanchot focuses on Antelme's insight that a man cannot become other than a man, whether he imagines himself a god (like the Nazis) or suffers from extraordinary affliction (like the deportees). Blanchot describes this insistence upon the human (rather than inhuman) character of violence and suffering as an act of ' anthropomorphism. ' 7 Anthropomorphism here refers to the attribution of the human in the absence of individual sovereignty or first-person existence. This philosophical and strategic anthropomorphism seems unlike the more conventional anthropomorphisms that occur in Antelme's poems. If the anthropomorphism of L 'espèce humaine is an act of human survival ('at the moment when he becomes the unknown and the foreign . . . then</page><page sequence="3">Before The Human Race: Robert Antelme 's Anthropomorphic Poetry 33 his last resort is to know that he has been struck not by the elements but by men, and to give the name man to everything that assails him'8), in the poems, anthropomorphism allows non-human, non-speaking, non- living entities - blood, earth, roads, trees - to take on a human form. In particular, the poem called 'Monologue du Sang' [The Blood's Monologue] links this formation to speech and relies upon a mode of ventriloquism, or fiction of voice, in order that blood can speak as a man, even if what it says is that the 'I' who speaks in the poem is not a man. Taken together, 'Monologue du Sang' and L 'espèce humaine raise questions about anthropomorphism as a poetic and testimonial strategy. While the poem suggests that the non-human can become human, the testimony argues that a human being never can become other than human (even as it appears and acts as other than human); and, more than this, the testimony insists that the discovery of this limit has its origin in Antelme's experience in the camps. In this sense the texts follow opposite trajectories of metamorphosis and imply different conceptions of the human. Anthropomorphism understood as the impossibility of arriving at a limit or becoming other than human despite every possible transformation is preceded by anthropomorphism as the possibility of a non-human entity becoming human by speaking and positing itself as a human subject, even in the very act of stating that it is not one. In 'Monologue du Sang', we also enter into a scene of constant metamorphosis, one that culminates in 'blood', and in an allegory of murder. Yet, the blood spilled at the poem's end points to man, not as the limit of limitless transformation, but as the source of violence. Blood says: 'Then one day there was a man/Who delved into my whole name.'9 If, in 'Monologue du Sang' a non-human entity (blood) reveals the human as a site of responsibility, this grisly mediation leaves in question the status of the speaking subject who is insistently not a man. The poem promises to tell a revelatory story of human violence; instead it shows how its account of violence - its testimony - is conditioned by anthropomorphism. The poem does not simply rely upon anthropomorphism, but allegorizes it. At several points upon his return from the camps, Antelme admits that it was only through a poetic act that he obtained the power to tell his story. In a letter to Dionys Mascolo written upon his first return from Dachau and published before his death in 1990 (but after he suffered the debilitating effects of a bungled operation that imprisoned him all over again), Antelme admits that when he first arrived back home in Paris, 'he was not a man of the earth.'10 The</page><page sequence="4">34 Critical Survey, Volume 20, Number 2 crisis that Antelme describes is due to a double incapacity: his inability not to tell his story and the inability to tell it; the inability to speak without choking and the inability of others to hear and comprehend him. This crisis, which Antelme also relates in the preface to L 'espèce humaine, turned bearing witness - or bridging the gap between words and experience - into an apparently impossible task. Antelme explains: Two years ago during the first days of our return, I think we were all prey to a genuine delirium. We wanted at least to speak, to be heard. We were told that all by itself our physical appearance was eloquent enough; but we had only just returned, with us we brought back our memory of our experience, an experience that was still very much alive, and we felt a frantic desire to describe it such as it had been. As of those first days, however, we saw that it was impossible to bridge the gap we discovered opening up between the words at our disposal and that experience which, in the case of most of us, was still going forward within our bodies. How were we to resign ourselves to not trying to explain how we had got to the state we were in? For we were yet in that state. And even so it was impossible. No sooner would we begin to tell our story than we would be choking over it. And then, even to us, what we had to tell would start to seem impossible. (HR 3) Antelme revisits this predicament of speaking in 'Poetry and the Testimony of the Camps', an essay that appeared only one year after L 'espèce humaine (and one year before Theodor Adorno's 'Cultural Criticism and Society', the essay in which Adorno has been understood to speak out against the possibility and morality of writing poetry after Auschwitz). Antelme' s essay opens with another version of the situation that he describes in the preface to L 'espèce humaine : Upon returning, each of us tried to say what the time spent in the camps in Germany was like, and the cover of silence over those years has been somewhat pushed back by books. Books, conversations, reunions. Everything everyone has said. All that is not simply the cry of life victorious, not simply the biological need to experience freedom, not simply the desire, from this ordeal, to make others aware of things that can be helpful in organizing human affairs . . . each of us wants to put his entire effort into recognizing himself in the time now past and ... to make it understood that the man speaking now and the man who was over there are one and the same.11 Here Antelme explains the meaning of the books ('books, conversations, reunions') that survivors wrote in the years following</page><page sequence="5">Before The Human Race: Robert Antelme s Anthropomorphic Poetry 35 their return. These books, far from motivated by an experience of freedom or overcoming, far from imagining a transformation of the deportee into a free man, instead have as their aim a desire to connect the experience of the deportee to the life of the survivor. The aim of these books, in other words, is to convey to others that I (the speaking survivor) am he (the mute deportee), to show that the man who lives and speaks is the same as the man who (in Antelme' s case) was left for dead among the typhoid quarantine, to show that the man of the camps was indeed a man. Far from narratives of overcoming, Antelme understands survivors' accounts to posit continuity and identity; they are accounts not of the triumph of man but of sheer, unglorious resilience, of surviving muteness without overcoming it. The struggle that inhabits Antelme' s testimony and preoccupies his essay stems from the capacity to speak, to be both a survivor and a witness, and to connect the witness (the deportee) with the survivor (the one who speaks and writes). Yet, there is also a third man whose place remains unaddressed here: this is the man who was deported, the man prior to his deportation, and in Antelme' s case the young poet who did not return from the camps. Testimony establishes the identity between the witness and the survivor, yet, what of the identity between the poet and the witnessl Antelme' s efforts at establishing the continuity between the deportee and the survivor implicitly raise questions of the continuity between poetry and testimony. As I have suggested, Antelme's 'Monologue du Sang' gives a textual explanation of this relation, one that links a conventional poetic anthropomorphism to the anthropomorphism that is the condition and argument of L 'espèce humaine. More than this, however, Antelme's poem offers an allegory of anthropomorphism as a testimonial strategy. In order to demonstrate this point, a closer reading of the poem, and in particular, its opening gesture, is required. Monologue du Sang Je suis une rivière Avec rien dedans. Je roule Comme un train dans la mine, On m'appelle le sang. Je suis né dans la mer Sans doute, Qui m'a confié de glisser puissamment;</page><page sequence="6">36 Critical Survey, Volume 20, Number 2 Je suis une fureur qui se déroule Placidement. Tous les mille ans je change d'âme, Peut-être je suis un fauve maintenant Dont on guette le tremblement. On me cache, Et, quand je me montre, J'éparpille tous les passants, Mais certains, dit-on, qui s'enfuient Se délectent en me voyant.12 Monologue of Blood I'm a river With nothing in it. I roll on Like a train in a mine, Blood, I'm called. Certainly I was born in the sea Which taught me how to flow forcefully; I'm a raging fury unfolding Placidly. I have a change of soul every thousand years, And maybe I'm a wildcat now, Whose tremblings are looked out for. I'm in hiding, And when I show myself I make all the passersby scatter, Though it's said that some who run off Really delight in seeing me.13 From the outset, 'Monologue du Sang' withholds the meaning of its organizing term: blood. As its title suggests, the poem is consciously staged and assumes the absence of an interlocutor. The poem revolves around an instance of self-positing (it opens with 'Je suis' [I am]); yet rather than establish identity or even consolidate it, the positing only inaugurates a chain of propositions, where each seems to elaborate upon and substitute for the preceding one. Indeed, the first of these statements - 'Je suis une rivière/Avec rien dedans' [I'm</page><page sequence="7">Before The Human Race: Robert Antelme s Anthropomorphic Poetry 3 7 a river/ With nothing in it] - can be construed as a statement of utter non-identity. Not only is a river permanent flux, but this river is evacuated of any substance or life. It is an ever-moving, empty vessel. Even the comparison of its permanent movement to a mine train that courses through the earth would seem to suspend, rather than sustain, the non-identity that characterizes it. The first stanza then moves from pure flux to contained movement (a traincar following on a track) to a name given by others: blood [le sang]. The arrival at a name - 'blood' [le sang] - mediated by a simile or comparison ('I roll on Hike a train in a mine') would seem to arrest the flow that the first positing describes. What occurs here is not another substitution, but rather a retroactive solidification of the first identity (which is also non-identity, the river) through a statement of likeness. Yet, as soon as this identity is set, we learn that it goes by still another name. It is called blood ('On m'appelle le sang'). The movement from river to train to blood (which the title suggests is the station where the substitutions stop) rather than flow like a river, flows like blood; it interrupts the permanent non-self-identity that it figures. If the poem is arrested by a name (blood), rather than unleashed by the flow of tropes, this arresting name is also a trope. Specifically, it is a paranomasia, a play on words, or what Peter Szondi has called a 'phonological near-identity.'14 For at the level of sound, sang [blood] is indistinguishable from sens [meaning or sensation], and sans [without]. The poem is preoccupied with the significance (or insignificance, sans sens) of blood as a sign both of violence and belonging, life and death, that which is hidden through euphemism, substitution, denial, or shame, and that which cannot but reappear. But as this description implies it also is obsessed with the flux and flow of meaning. Not only is the meaning of blood in question in this poem, but so is meaning and sensation: the capacity of the poem to mean, and the capacity of the voice that speaks in the poem to be a living voice. Yet, the possibility of 'meaning' or 'sensation' speaking is just as fictional as the possibility of 'blood' speaking. The paranomasia, far from settling the meaning of the poem, instead points to its rhetorical condition. It suggests that not only a 'Monologue du sang' or 'Monologue du sens', this might be a 'Monologue du sans.' Returning to the poem, the interruption of non-identity that occurs when pure substitution is replaced by comparison and naming is itself arrested by a narrative account of origins. The poem continues in the</page><page sequence="8">38 Critical Survey, Volume 20, Number 2 'voice' of a river: 'Je suis né dans la mer/ Sans doute, / Qui m'a confié de glisser puissament; / Je suis une fureur qui se déroule/ Placidement.' Yet when 'the river called blood' claims to account for its origins, it mistakes its end ('the sea' [la mer]) for its source. The certainty of origins that it claims ['Sans doute'] corresponds to an instant of mistakenness or falsehood. Yet, this substitution of origin and end, also introduces a second paranomasia - in the play on the identity of 'la mer' [the sea] and 'la mère' [mother] - that turns the improper origin into a proper one.15 This restoration of sense also assumes that the river is a living man or animal. Indeed, the poem continues with yet another statement of identity, albeit in a mode of tentativeness, rather than certainty: 'Peut-être je suis un fauve maintenant /Dont on guette le tremblement' [And maybe I'm a wildcat now, /Whose tremblings are looked out for]. While the account of metamorphoses seems to continue, and while until this point it has seemed to be that changes occur in the appearance or presentation of a meaning or sense that still remains obscure [river, train, blood ...], the poem's subject insists that it is not appearance that is in question, but rather the soul ['l'âme']. Unlike the rapid and relentless changes that already have occurred in the poem ('a raging fury unfolding/Placidly'), the change of soul is slow and tentative: it follows millennia rather than seconds. At the moment ('now'), it 'may be' that the soul of this river is a wild animal. If it would seem that once again there is confusion, in this case, a confusion of body and soul or appearance and meaning, so that the animal or beast, far from being a soul, instead would be a body or incarnation of the soul, this second inversion also makes sense of the inverted claim that precedes it. 'Je suis né dans la mer' is now the statement of a wild beast, the statement of a soul rather than a body. The substitution of end for origin and the straightening of this inversion through a pun that introduces yet another inversion correlates with the poem's conceit that it is a 'Monologue of Blood.' The rhetorical nexus that both conditions and is reflected in this strange speech act links blood (violence and murder) to signification (the possibility of establishing the poem's meaning and the meaning of a 'monologue of blood'). If this impossibility resonates with the impossibility of speaking and being heard to which Antelme's later testimony attests when it describes the contradictory situation that occurs when the deportee speaks, and if it suggests that the impossibility can be resolved through poetic anthropomorphism, an</page><page sequence="9">Before The Human Race: Robert A ntelme 's Anthropomorphic Poetry 3 9 anthropomorphism that occurs in statements of non-human identity (I am a river; I am like a train; I am called blood; I have the soul of a wild beast), the rhetorical structure upon which the poem relies may not be radically different from the one upon which L 'espèce humaine relies. The implication of this resonance could be described as the discovery of a continuity between poetry and testimony, a continuity that we might associate with the anthropomorphism that occurs in them both. In his essay 'Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric', Paul de Man points out the easy radicalism of the claim that all truth is tropological (an understanding attributed to post-structuralism in the late-twentieth century, but that has its roots, as de Man shows, in romantic literature and critical philosophy). De Man focuses in particular on Nietzsche's essay 'On Truth and Lies in a Non-Moral Sense', where Nietzsche defines truth as 'a mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms. ' De Man pauses to show that anthropomorphism is not a trope like metaphor and metonymy, for it assumes an entity that precedes substitution. De Man's understanding of metaphor and metonymy presumes that all tropes are catachreses, which is to say that there is no proper meaning (no sense, no truth) prior to the substitution. Anthropomorphism, de Man suggests, operates differently, for it takes for granted an a prior entity. Rather than introducing a series of substitutions that could continue infinitely, it ultimately comes to a proper, unique end, which de Man calls not 'man' (anthropos), but the proper name.16 In L 'espèce humaine this 'proper name' - the limit of substitution - turns out to be infinite substitution, that is, when man can be anything without becoming other than man. 'Monologue du Sang', seems to move in the opposite direction when it confuses the terms it animates; it stages a metamorphosis and seems to imply that a non-human entity (whose very nature is uncertain) can come to act like a human, and does so at least in part in order to reveal the culpability of man. Yet, despite the fact that they move in opposite directions, the conclusion to which these two texts arrive - that murder and destruction remain human rather than inhuman acts - is virtually the same. Yet this similarity implies more than the testimonial structure of poetry or the poetic structure of testimony, which is another version of de Man's (and Nietzsche's) 'truth is trope.' It suggests a continuity between poetry from before the camps and testimony of them. This continuity endures despite the fact that in the foreword to L 'espèce</page><page sequence="10">40 Critical Survey, Volume 20, Number 2 humaine Antelme explains that he arrived at his understanding of the irresmissibility of the human race only through his experience in the camps. In 'Poetry and the Testimony of the Camps', Antelme gives his own explanation of poetry's relation to testimony, one that does not take his pre-deportation (although not pre-war) poetry into account. There he admits that the risk run by poetry differs from that of testimony. If testimony risks being pure exposure, and if it thus risks becoming a mode of terrorism, poetry, and here Antelme is talking about 'poetry of the camps', risks obscuring the experience of the camps: it could 'risk fleeing the reality of the camps, letting that reality be glimpsed only through a melodic counterpoint, through themes of nostalgia (the sun, laughter, color, etc.) that surround but never penetrate this reality of fog and of words' (. PTC 33; TCP 47; translation modified).17 In other words, testimony risks showing too much (becoming a photograph) and poetry risks showing too little (becoming a song). Yet, just as Antelme describes the risk that poetry's means of communication is musical or allegorical (rather than mimetic or dialectical), he goes on to describe poetry's essential orientation towards testimony: 'It is the essence of poetry to express experience - reality as it is constantly lived, contested, and assumed; this description defines almost exactly what is called the "experience" of the camps' ( PTC 34è, TCP 48; translation modified). Thus, Antelme understands poetry as fundamentally - or essentially - a mode of testimony. And he goes on to insist upon the necessity of studying poetry about the camps: The poems that have been published about the camps need to be studied more profoundly. All of them express the prisoner's determination to present clearly the most oppressive reality, or at least to uphold the tireless life of consciousness within the camps, often while trying to flee it. Whether testimony or prophecy, the poetry of the camps has the greatest chance of being the poetry of truth. ( PTC 34; TCP 48; translation modified) What Antelme finds remarkable - and laudatory - in poetry about the camps is the double gesture through which the prisoner bears witness to the very destruction he desires to overcome, that is, he faces the reality that he can hardly bear and also, I would argue, reveals that poetry is not a restorative mode, but merely a testimonial one. While Antelme is particularly focused on Maurice Honel's poetry, his understanding is a general one: all poetry insofar as it is about the</page><page sequence="11">Befare The Human Race: Robert Antelme 's Anthropomorphic Poetry 4 1 camps shares this structural ambivalence. Antelme's statement finally can be read in another sense. It bears witness to an absence of poetry (there was no book called Les Mains aux Grilles ) and of the poet, and to an endurance of poetry in this other sense. While Antelme became a witness, rather than a poet, his poetry (poetry without poems) maintains in the survival that he describes and in the prosaic anthropomorphism that is the source of L 'espèce humaine.
