<plain_text><page sequence="1">Award-Winning Undergraduate Paper THE EFFECTS OF INFORMATION ON WILLINGNESS- To-PAY VALUES OF ENDANGERED SPECIES JENNIFER TKAC The contingent valuation method (CVM) has been employed in several research studies to measure the economic value of environmental commodities (Brookshire; Kramer and Mer- cer; Loehman, Park, and Boldt; Lohr, Battard, and Bath). The use of CVM allows for flex- ibility and for application to a wide range of environmental amenities, not only those that can be measured in conjunction with some marketable goods. However, because of its hypothetical character, the validity of CVM is often disputed. A structural element that might have an es- pecially strong influence on CVM valuation is the contingent market information structure (Bergstorm, Stoll, and Randall). Information content and presentation in contingent mar- kets are controlled by the researcher. The de- sign of an information structure can influence a participant's cognitive valuation process and, in turn, final revealed valuations. Infor- mation is thus conceptualized as an input into the cognitive decision process, of which stated valuations are the final result. The role of in- formation in a contingent valuation method- ology is extremely important because it con- veys the knowledge of an environmental issue with which the respondent will assimilate and base value judgment on. This research study proposes that infor- mation disclosure can influence an individu- als' reported willingness-to-pay (WTP) values for the preservation of an endangered species. The means by which information is disclosed by the researcher is critical in the valuation process. New information disclosed about an ecological good might affect the WTP behav- ior of the individuals (Kula). Literature Fairly extensive research has studied the ef- fects of information disclosure on WTP values of ecological goods. The WTP for the pres- ervation of unique and natural areas for wil- derness designation in Utah was examined by Pope and Jones. They noted that detailed wil- derness designation information had no strong implication on WTP values. The insignificant impact on the WTP value can be attributed to the fact that the survey was conducted during a period when the issue of wilderness des- ignation was being actively debated in Utah. Therefore, most people were well informed about the issue and were not influenced by further information. This result agrees with Kula that well-informed people tend not to be significantly influenced by additional infor- mation. A particular study of interest is that of Sam- ples, Dixon, and Gowen. They tested whether varying commodity descriptions affect re- spondents' statements of value. They utilized one-way analysis of variance to statistically compare mean reported bids for the groups. The respondents were given a fixed amount of money that they were to allocate among three species of wildlife. Four levels of in- formation were provided in regard to these species, and the respondents were allowed to redistribute the fixed sum among the species after each level of information was provided.

At the first stage, because of minimal information, the respon- dents gave nearly equal amounts. At the sec- ond stage, the respondents gave a larger sum of money to the monkey as opposed to the rabbit and rat. At the third stage, more funds were allocated to the animal that was said to be endangered but savable. At the fourth stage, the endangered but savable rat received the greatest allocation of funds. This study suggests that the amount of information dis- closure and WTP are correlated. The results of Samples, Dixon, and Gowen coincide with those of Mitchell and Carson, who determined that WTP values were much larger for re- spondents who received explicit information on wildlife conservation sites in Great Britain than those who received minimal information. Boyle similarly examined how the descrip- tion of an item being valued affects the re- sulting contingent valuation (CV) estimates. The issue of target specificity was empirically investigated in a CVM study of brown trout fishing in southern Wisconsin streams. The only difference in the treatment of individuals in each of these groups was the level of in- formation they were provided about the brown-trout fishery. All groups received the same basic commodity description, and two of the groups received additional information about the fishery. Three types of statistical tests were used to examine whether changing the specificity of the target description affected the results of the CV exercise. Boyle determined that there was no significant impact on WTP values with the disclosure of additional information. His results indicated that small refinements in a specific commodity description do not alter WTP values. Although varying the commod- ity description did not exert a statistically sig- nificant effect on the magnitude of the actual value estimates, it did have a significant effect on the precision of estimated values. A study by Althaus found that the infor- mation resources possessed by rival publics are critical determinants of how loudly their preferences are voiced in policy-oriented sur- vey questions. Ill-informed respondents tend to select "no opinion" more frequently, and, when they provide responses, they answer more randomly than the well informed. Be- cause of this, numerically small publics who have large proportions of well-informed con- stituents can significantly influence the fre- quency of information-dependent questions. In addition, several psychological studies have indicated that the amount of information available to an individual will influence their valuation process as well as their attitude to- ward a particular issue. They show that in- formation and personal experience increase attitude-behavior consistency (Fazio and Zan- na; Jones, Rambo, and Russell). It was also found that the amount of information mod- erated the consistency between attitude and behavior even after controlling for other fac- tors such as direct behavioral experience. Collectively, all these research studies sup- port the argument that information is an im- portant input into consumer valuation deci- sions. The respondents' resulting valuation will have an impact on WTP. Hypothesis This study will examine the effects of infor- mation disclosure on WTP values of non-mar- ket goods in a contingent market. Experiments will test whether information disclosure will have any impact on individuals' valuation of endangered species. Three hypotheses will be tested: 1. People who are well informed about an ecological good will place a higher value on that good than people who have limited information. 2. Different descriptions of the same endan- gered species can result in varied levels of valuation (Hoevenagel and van der Lin- den). 3. The effect of information disclosure will vary among different academic programs. The more relevant the topic of the study is to the academic program, the less effec- tive the disclosure of information will be on the respondents' WTP values. The con- verse would exist for the academic pro- gram that majors in a field different from that of the topic being investigated. Methodology The methodology is a replicative study based on Samples' (1986) research. Surveys de- scribing hypothetical situations were used to empirically test the three hypotheses. The ex- periments were conducted in two undergrad- uate-level courses at McGill University: Prin-</page><page sequence="3">1216 Number 5, 1998 Amer. J. Agr. Econ. ciples of Microeconomics from the Depart- ment of Agricultural Economics (sample size of forty-six students) and Wildlife Biology from the Department of Natural Resource Sci- ences (sample size of forty-three students). A model similar to that of Samples, Dixon, and Gowen was employed to examine the effect of information disclosure on WTP values. Copies of the questionnaires can be found in the appendix. The first survey in the experiment, the Har- lequin duck preservation experiment, required all the respondents to complete identical ques- tionnaires prior to the disclosure of additional information about the Harlequin duck and its endangered status. This survey was broken down into three parts. Part 1 involved four theoretical questions (questions 1-4) about the Harlequin duck, an endangered species in eastern North America. Part 2 (questions 5- 7) required all the respondents to state their attitudes toward wildlife preservation funds. Part 3 (question 8) required all the respon- dents to place their annual WTP values for the preservation of the Harlequin duck. The second survey involved a series of questions directed toward both groups. Both groups were asked to allocate a windfall gain of $30 among different preservation funds for three species. Four scenarios containing various amounts of information about each of the spe- cies were presented. Only survey 1 was repeated one month lat- er. During this session, extensive information was disclosed about the status of the Harle- quin duck and about wildlife preservation funds. Statistical analysis was used to deter- mine the effects of information disclosure on reported WTP values for both surveys. Results and Discussion The first part of the experiment determined that information disclosure on the Harlequin duck had a significant effect on the total num- ber of correct answers for questions 1 through 4. The Wildlife students answered an average of 2.35 questions correctly, whereas the Eco- nomic students answered 1.91 answers cor- rectly before the disclosure of information. After the disclosure of information, the to- tal number of correct answers answered by the Economics group increased significantly by 35% with a p-value of 0.0001. The impact of information on the Wildlife group was also significant at the 0.05 level with a p-value of 0.0361. However, when compared to the Eco- nomics group, the disclosure of information did not have as strong an impact, as the total number of correct answers increased by only 8%. These results might be explained by the exposure to prior knowledge in regard to the Harlequin duck. It was assumed that the Eco- nomics group had no prior detailed knowledge about the Harlequin duck and its endangered status. Therefore, the highly significant rela- tionship (p-value of 0.0001) that resulted be- tween information disclosure and the number of correct answers was due to the fact that they assimilated the additional information ef- fectively because the content was new to them. By having no prior knowledge about the Harlequin duck, the disclosure of addi- tional information was integrated very effec- tively. They applied this additional informa- tion to the questions, and the result was an increase in the number of correct answers. In contrast, the Wildlife group have been studying wildlife management and the char- acteristics of wildlife species for an average of three years. With the knowledge they have acquired through their program, they were able to effectively apply it to the questions in the absence of additional information. Having a strong background knowledge, the answers derived after the disclosure of information did not have a strong effect on the total number of correct answers. This explains why the Wildlife group did not assimilate the addi- tional information as effectively as the Eco- nomics group. The additional information was simply stating knowledge that they had al- ready acquired through their program, so it did not effectively increase their total number of correct answers. A correlation analysis indicated an overall strong correlation between the number of cor- rect answers and WTP values. The probability that the absolute value of the correlation be- tween the number of correct answers and WTP values were not equal to zero for both groups was significant: 0.0001 with a corre- lation value of 0.33827. Before the disclosure of information, there was a strong correlation between the number of correct answers and WTP values for the Economics group, as was indicated by the correlation value of 0.44853. This result was expected because the Eco- nomics group was not subjected to prior knowledge about the Harlequin duck. This al- lowed for great variation among the answers because not all the respondents possessed the same level of information in regard to the Har-</page><page sequence="4">Tkac Effect of Information on WTP Values 1217 50 I Economics &lt; 30 Wildlife 20 0 2 10 BA BA BA BA BA BA (0.813) (0.031) (0.001) (0.973) (0.001) (0.717) Q5 Q6 Q7 Note: For question 6, the number of yes answers increased by only 4% and remained uniform for question 7. These results did not reject the hypothesis that information disclosure will not have a significant effect on the answers of the Wildlife group. This was due to the fact that the Wildlife students had already acquired the necessary knowledge in terms of wildlife preservation funds. Therefore, the addition of already obtained information did not change their attitudes toward the preservation funds. Figure 1. Association between information disclosure and answers to questions 5, 6, and 7 lequin duck. However, the Wildlife group showed a strong correlation between the num- ber of correct answers and WTP values after information was disclosed on the Harlequin duck (a correlation value of 0.42343). Such a correlation was not expected. It was assumed that the number of correct answers would not influence WTP values after the disclosure of information because the Wildlife group al- ready possessed a high level of knowledge about the Harlequin duck in the absence of additional information disclosure. Although this result can be due entirely to chance, it directs attention toward the subtle ways in which respondents' attitudes are dynamic, perhaps in this case because of self-evalua- tion. Furthermore, it lends support to the view that preferences are learned during the ques- tioning process, even in the absence of new relevant information (Samples). The results from part 2 of survey 1 indi- cated that the impact of information disclosure was different for different academic pro- grams. When each of the study groups was examined independently, there was a signifi- cant relationship between information disclo- sure and the answers generated by the Eco- nomics group (figure 1). The significance of information disclosure for question 6 was de- termined by a p-value of 0.001. The frequency of yes answers increased by 30% after infor- mation was disclosed. Similar results were ob- tained for question 7, where twenty-seven Economics students answered yes prior to the disclosure of information, and forty answered yes after the disclosure of information. These results indicate that providing the Economic students with information that was new to them allows them to incorporate it into their decision-making process. This additional information provides the Economics students with comparable knowledge in subject matter with Wildlife students. As expected, information disclosure did not have a significant impact (p-value of 0.813) on the Economic students for question 5. This result was explained by the fact that this ques- tion dealt with past events. In contrast, the tests of association for the Wildlife group between information disclo- sure and answers to questions 6 and 7 showed no significant relationship (figure 1). For question 6, the number of yes answers in- creased by only 4% and remained uniform for question 7. These results did not reject the hypothesis that information disclosure will not have a significant effect on the answers of the Wildlife group because the Wildlife stu- dents had already acquired the necessary knowledge in terms of wildlife preservation funds. Therefore, the addition of already ob- tained information did not change their atti- tudes toward the preservation funds. It was determined that there was a signif- icant relationship between information disclo- sure and answers derived for question 5 by</page><page sequence="5">1218 Number 5, 1998 Amer. J. Agr. Econ.

The total number of yes answers increased by 23%. This result was unexpected because this question dealt with past events. It can be argued that the Wildlife students felt obliged to cheat or lie about their previous contributions to wildlife preserva- tion funds because their program emphasizes concern for wildlife and environmental ame- nities. The third part of the experiment (question 8) determined that there was a significant re- lationship between information disclosure about the Harlequin duck and reported annual WTP values by the Economics group, as was indicated by a low p-value of 0.0018. The Economic groups' annual WTP values dou- bled after the disclosure of additional infor- mation. Although there was an increase in the annual WTP values for the Wildlife group, the increase was statistically insignificant, as was indicated by a high p-value of 0.1059. These results can be attributed once again to background knowledge. The results from survey 2 indicated that both the Economic and the Wildlife groups' WTP values were highly influenced by vary- ing amounts of information that were selec- tively disclosed about the three species, as was hypothesized (table 1). These results were very similar to those of Samples in that clear patterns about the impact of information on mean allocations are evident both across spe- cies and across questions. In case 1, mean allocations were not sig- nificant, as all bids were equal. Case 2 re- flected a strong anthropomorphic tendency (Samples) whereby the respondents were will- ing to pay more for the preservation of the beluga whale than the birdlike or ratlike spe- cies. In case 3, the respondents allocated sig- nificantly more funds to the species that were endangered but savable. The fact that the spe- cies were savable might have made the allo- cation seem worthwhile to the respondents. However, in some respect, it seems peculiar that respondents were willing to allocate 15% of the budgeted funds to save species B even though they were informed that it was a lost cause. As reasoned by Samples, the respon- dents might have allocated a part of their bud- geted funds to such a cause because of their solidarity for the species in the face of its tremendous adversity or to invest in the re- mote possibility that the species' unsavable status might somehow improve. In case 4, the respondents were willing to allocate more funds to the species that was endangered and savable regardless of the physical description. These results might suggest that information about the endangered status of a species might be relatively more important to an individual than information about physical attributes when formulating their preservation alloca- tions. Conclusions Collectively, the empirical findings of this study emphasized the importance of infor-</page><page sequence="6">Tkac Effect of Information on WTP Values 1219 mation disclosure when applying CVMs to estimate the value that individuals place on species preservation. This study determined that WTP values are directly related to the various levels of information disclosure, con- firming the first hypothesis. It was also con- cluded that selective information disclosure significantly influenced preservation bids, agreeing with the second hypothesis. Fur- thermore, it was seen that the effects of in- formation disclosure varied among different academic programs, confirming the third hy- pothesis. With the results presented in this experi- ment, it can be suggested that CV methods can be biased toward premeditated views. This creates uncertainty in regard to the type and amount of information that should be dis- closed to individuals. Disclosing or constrain- ing the amount of information given to re- spondents can indeed bias individuals' re- sponses toward the researcher's expected con- clusions (Samples). From the results of this study, it is suggested that further research into standards for information disclosure in CVM be investigated. References Bergstorm, J., J. Stoll, and A. Randall.
