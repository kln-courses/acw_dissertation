<plain_text><page sequence="1">93 FEMALE FERTILITY FIGURES. [WITH PLATES VIII-XII.| By Miss M. A. MURRAY. FERTILITY figures of various kinds are common throughout the world, and it seems worth while to make some systematic study of them, especially as so many English examples have been published recently, in a rather haphazard manner. The male, or priapic, figures have been more carefully investigated than the female; the latter have usually been massed together indiscriminately under the generic term of " Mother-goddess." On a closer examination of the, female figures, however, it becomes clear that they can be divided into at least three groups 1. The Universal Mother or Isis type. 2. The Divinle Woman or Ishtar type. 3. The Personified Yoni or Baubo type. Each type was derived from a different religious, i.e. psychological, sentiment, and was consequently given a distinctive name as a goddess. The types were occasionally fused (Pls. VIII and XI, Figs. 3 and 27), and the name of a goddess is sometimes given to a type other than her own, but this is rare. The types are usually quite distinct from one another. 1. The Universal Mother.-This is the true " Mother "-goddess. She is represented in several ways: (a) With full breasts, often exaggerated in size or number (Pls. VIII and XI, Figs. 1 and 27); (b) with a child in her arms, either being suckled or held up to face the spectator (P1. VIII, Figs. 2-4) ; (c) as a woman enceinte (P1. VIII, Fig. 8). These forms are constant throughout the world, and are well-known in ancient times. The best examples of the first form are the palaeolithic figures at Laussel and the polymastic Diana of the Ephesians; of the second, Isis with the child Horus; of the third, the Egyptian goddess Ta-urt. These are the only forms which can represent the Mother, for they show her as the child-bearing woman. She is there the protectress and nourisher of the child, born and unborn, and is therefore equally the protectress and nourisher -of all mankind, present and future. As such she was worshipped under various names in the ancient world and survives into Christianity as Sainte Marie de Cree Lait (to whom Gilles de Rais' daughter set up, on the spot where her father was executed, a fountain which nursing mothers frequented), as the Virgin, Protectress of Milk (whose statue may be seen in many Christian churches, among them the Cathedral of Barcelona), as the Virgin of the Nativity, and as the Virgin suckling the infant Christ. Of the two last there are innumerable examples in Christian art. To the Mother-goddess class belong all figures in which the child is an essential part, actual or implied. The rudely fashioned figures which are only vaguely human in outline, but with</page><page sequence="2">94 M. A. MURRAY.-Female Fertility Figures. the breasts (P1. VIII, Figs, 5, 6) clearly indicated, the semi-anthropomorphic jars with two small parallel spouts at one side (P1. VIII, Fig. 7) also represent the divine Mother. At all times and in all religions the Mother-goddess was equally worshipped by men, women, and children, for the relation of mother and child is universal. It therefore seems advisable to restrict the term " Mother-goddess " to the one type. 2. The Divine Woman.-The Ishtar type is entirely different from the Mother, to which it has no likeness except as regards their common femininity. The figure is always that of a young woman, hardly more than a girl, and the rounded limbs are made as- beautiful as the skill of the sculptor permits. She is sometimes nude, sometimes lightly veiled, sometimes completely clothed. Even when nude no emphasis is laid on the sexual parts of the body, which are represented naturalistically and without exaggeration. Occasionally the figure has the arm bent across the body, the hand supporting one breast, but the breast itself is not emphasized as in the Mother type (P1. IX, Figs. 9, 10). This type begins as early as the Badari period (P1. IX, Fig. 9), and is always of the young girl whose figure has not yet been spoiled by child-bearing. It represents the Divine Woman whom Man desires-beautiful, exquisite, alluring, potential mother but still a virgin. In no sense can she be called a Mother-goddess for she has not yet borne a child. The Ishtar figures are limited in their appeal, for they appeal to men only and leave a woman unmoved, and are nothing to a child. The veiling of the figure suggests that the appeal is partly to the feeling of force and conquest often so strong in a man. The Ishtar type cannot then be classed with the Mother-goddesses, but must be regarded from a different standpoint; it belongs to the group of deities specially worshipped by men. 3. Thte Personified Yoni.-This type represents-as the name I have given it indicates- the figure in which the genitalia are the essential part. In this type beauty of form or features is disregarded, the secondary sexual characters, such as the breasts, are minimized; the whole emphasis is laid on the pudenda. In all sculpture, whether primitive or advanced, it is exceptionally difficult to represent the female genitalia. In relief sculpture the profile is useless, the figure mlnst be seen from the front. In this the female figuLres differ from the male or priapic, for which the profile view is so essential as to be invariably practised by primitive artists (compare the dancing god of the Caverne des Trois Freres, the phallic god Min of Egypt, and the Saxon carving at Bradford- on-Avon). In priapic figures in the round, the male organ is exaggerated to a colossal size, and in large statues the phallus was not only enormous, but was made of a material different from the rest of the statue and was detachable so that it could be carried in procession separately. The representation of the female genitalia required a totally different artistic treatment, whether the figure were in relief or in the round. The front view is essential, the genitalia must be exaggerated in size and somewhat distorted in position, and the attitude of the figure may be such as to show the pudenda in a specially marked manner. In the ancient world the most realistic of such figures belong to Egypt, where they represent the goddess Baubo.</page><page sequence="3">M. A. MURRAY.-Female Fertility Figures. 95 Though these figures are of the Roman period they are riot necessarily of Roman origin, they are merely an ancient goddess in a new form. The legend of Baubo is known only through the Greek accounts. This legend says that when Isis was mourning for Osiris, Baubo assumed the attitude represented in tlle figures, and thereby made Isis laugh and cease from lamenting. The legend is clearly late, for Baubo is called indifferently the hostess of Isis, the nurse of Isis, and is even one aspect of Isis herself. She had a definite role in the Eleusinian Mysteries, which were, according to Diodorus, the same as the Mysteries of Isis, while Herodotus (II, 59) says that in Greek Isis was called Demeter. The Egyptian origin of Baubo is accepted by classical scholars, who equate Baubo-Phryne (Frog-Baubo) with the frog-goddess of birth Heqt. This equation may be correct if it is based on the form of some of the Baubo figures, but the equation of Baubo-Hecate with Baubo- Heqt is philologically impossible. To account for the popularity of Baubo in Egypt the origin of both the figure and the name must be sought in the Egyptian pantheon. As the Greek form of the goddess's name is written indifferently as Baubo or Babo it is probably derived from the goddess Bebt, the female counterpart of the god Beb. Of these two deities little is known. Plutarch (De. Is. et Os. XLIX, 6) says, on Manetho's authority, that Typho and Bebo are the same, and he asserts further, that Typho and Seth are two names for buit one deity; therefore Bebo and Seth must be the same god also. Though in late times Seth was regarded as the Principle of Evil, there is abundant evidence that in the early periods down to the end of the New Kingdom he was one of the great gods and as much a giver of fertility as Osiris himself. The cult of Beb and Bebt is best known in the First Intermediate Period, particularly in the VJJth Dynasty, when personal names compounded with Beb are very frequent. Figures of Beb and Bebt are unknown in pharaonic times, or at least have not been recognized; and it seems significant that under the Ptolemies and the Romans, when the deities of the common people became important, the Baubo figures should occur in great numbers. The figures of Baubo are unmistakable. The headdress is often very elaborate and some- times has a strong resemblance to a nimbus; the body is usually nlde, but if draped the drapery is only over the upper part and conceals the breasts. The figure is commonly represented as seated on the ground, the legs spread out so as to display the pudenda, which are strongly marked and often exaggerated in size (P1. X, Figs. 17-18). The usual position is with the legs horizontal, the knees bent and the feet turned inwards. Sometimes the figure is squatting with the knees raised and turned outward (P1. X, Fig. 17); this is the Baubo-Phryne or " frog " attitude. In every case the outward spread of the thighs is essential. The pose of the arms varies; sometimes they are raised in the so-called "attitude of prayer," sometimes they are held forward as in invitation; sometimes the hands are laid on the thighs to stretch the legs apart and so emphasize the pudenda. This last position explains the arms apparently akimbo of the rudely fashioned figures which are not uncommon in late Roman times. In all forms of the Baubo figure the breasts are normal, or less than normal in size, sometimes they are hardly indicated, and as noted above, they are sometimes veiled. It is obvious, therefore, that the whole emphasis is laid on the genitalia and not on the breasts.</page><page sequence="4">96 M. A. MURRAY.-Female Fertility Figures. It is hardly possible that these figures should appear suddenly and in such numbers without any precursors. Nude figures, except of children, are very rare in ancient Egyptian art, yet in every period there are found a certain number of nude female figures which may very well represent the Personfied Yoni. These always follow the conventions of primitive art, the faces are expressionless, the figure erect on its feet, the arms hanging stiffly at the sides; there is no attempt at representing action of any kind; but the most lnoticeable features in all these nude figures is the strongly marked sexual triangle, which is represented as stretching across the body and reaching from the point of one hip to the other. Sometimes it is marked with incised dots or lines, sometimes it is painted in solid black; in every case it is so emphasized as to attract imr.mediate attention. The earliest example is the ivory figure from Badari, now in the British Museum (P1. IX, Fig. 11). Of the same period and from the same place is a pottery figure of the Ishtar type with the arm flexed across the body (P1. IX, Fig. 9). This, although nude, is as naturalistic a representation of a beautiful female form as the conventions of the time permitted; the sexual parts are in no way forced on the attention as in the ivory figure. The existence of these two statuettes side by side in place and period, is peculiarly interesting, as showing that in the earliest civilizations there was a differentiation of the two types-one belonging to the Baubo class, the other to the Ishtar class. In the Amratean and Gerzean (first and second prehistoric) periods figures of nude women occur in which the genitalia are not noticeable, but with them is a small percentage with the sexual triangle unduly emphasized (P1. IX, Figs. 12, 13). In the early Middle Kingdom, amnong the rudely fashioned figures of serving-women, there is sometimes one which conforms to the Baubo type. Later in the Middle Kingdom there are found figures of nude women made in wood or glazed ware, with the sexual triangle exaggerated in size and strongly marked in black. These, especially the blue-glazed figures, are often made with the legs cut off at the knees and the stumps rounded off (P1. IX, Fig. 14). The cutting off of the feet and legs is a peculiarity of the hieroglyphs of this period, the birds being repre- sented without legs. The usual explanation of this practice is that the mutilation prevents an evil creature from moving. The explanation, if accepted, disposes entirely of the theory that the mutilated female figures were the playthings of children. The mutilation of the hieroglyphs was undoubtedly for magical purposes; such purposes would be out of place in a child's toy; no plaything, to which the slightest suspicion of evil could be attached, would ever be permitted to be in a child's possession, even though that evil were minimized as far as human means could do it. Similar figures are found also in Babylonia (P1. IX, Figs. 15, 16), showing that the Baubo type was not unknown there also as early as the Egyptian XIIth Dynasty. From the point of view of the artist it is certain that in the early forms the stiff position of the arms and the frontality of the whole figure were due to the limitations of artistic conven- tion which prevented emphasis by attitude. The exaggeration in representing the pudenda had therefore to be effected by other means, such as colour. With the advent of the naturalistic art of Greece and Rome the artist had more freedom, and the attitude, not the colour, then became the method of indicating the nature of the figures.</page><page sequence="5">M. A. MURRAY.-Female Fertility Figures. 97 Few published records exist of the finding of such statuettes, but those few show that the figures were kept in houses or buried in graves; in other words, they were for the use of the living as well as the dead. When found in graves they are almost invariably in a female burial. The figures of the Roman period were in houses, usually in the inner, i.e. the women's apart- ments. It is clear then that the figures were for the use of women. All three classes of female figures were undoubtedly divine. The psychological reason underlying the divinity of the Mother is obvious; it is common to all humanity, and has therefore been carefully studied. The Divine Woman makes a direct appeal to men; she is therefore a deity of fertility whose psychological reason is as obvious as that of the Mother. The third class, the Personified Yoni, has been confused with the Mother, with which it has no real connection, and has not been studied separately. To realize its meaning it is necessary to turn to the more modern examples of this type which survive in the British Isles and are known as the Sheila-na-gig.' These are always nude and are represented in the frontal aspect, the legs usually wide apart, and the hands so posed as to call attention to the genitalia; the breasts are never more than normal, often barely indicated, and sometimes omitted altogether, the genitalia are exaggerated in size and position. The figures therefore conform to the Baubo type; in the Whittlesford example (P1. XII, Fig. 32) the type is that of Baubo- Phryne. It may be worth noting that the Sheila-na-gig appears to be peculiar to the British Isles, and is not found on the mainland of Europe. In France its place is perhaps taken by the two- tailed mermaid, who holds a tail in either hand, and whose attitude is therefore reminiscent of Baubo. That the Sheila-na-gig was regarded as divine, or at least as having divine attributes, is shown by the fact that the figures are almost invariably found on Christian churches; even the Irish examples, which are now sometimes found on other buildings, are traditionally said to come from churches. The number of Sheila-na-gig is greater than is usually supposed. In England and Scotland the subject has met with little attention hitherto, but in Ireland the Sheila-na-gig figures have always interested the archeologist and consequently a large number are known, of which some have been published. The most typical Sheila-na-gig is the figure on the corbel-table on the outside of Kilpeck Church in Herefordshire, one of the finest Norman churches in England. In this figure (P1. XII, Fig. 29) the whole emphasis is laid on the genitalia, which are exaggerated out of all proportion to the body. There are no breasts; the arms, unduly long, are passed under the legs, giving the akimbo effect seen in the Oxford figure (Man, 1929, p. 134). The same position of the arms and the same action of holding open the vulva are seen again in the Essex figure (P1. X, Fig. 19) and in the two Irish examples (P1. XI, Figs. 25, 26). In these also, though the breasts are totally omitted, the sex cannot be doubted; there is no possibility of even the most unobservant spectator 1 The translation of the name is generally given as " Woman of the Castle." It is the fashion to apologize for using the epithet as being unmeaning and due to a misconception. As well apologize for calling the New World " America," a name which is equally unmeaning and equally founded on a miscon- ception. VOL. LXIV. G</page><page sequence="6">98 M. A.

X, Fig. 24) is so roughly worked that without the other examples with which to compare it the attitude would be difficult to understand; the monkey appearance of the ears is enhanced by the roughness of the stone which gives the effect of fur. The same type of ear is seen in the Essex example (P1. X, Fig. 19) and in the Ballylarkin figure (P1. XI, Fig. 27). The attitude slightly modified is found also in Pls. X-XIJ, Figs. 21-23, 27, 31, which are less energetic in action and may therefore be later in date; and in Fig. 28 the breasts are shown. At Torksey, ill Lincolnshire, the figure (P1. X, Fig. 20) is so worn and battered, although it is inside the church, that it is impossible to say whether the breasts were originally represented; the pose of the arms, however, leaves no doubt that this also is a Sheila-na-gig, though possibly of a late type. The example from Ballylarkin church (P1. XI, Fig. 27) is remarkable for having four breasts and for the peculiar attitude; the position of the legs is reminiscent of the Romano-Egyptian figures (cf. P1. X, Fig. 17). The Sheila from Blackhall Castle (P1. X, Fig. 22) is represented with breasts and long hair, the arms are slightly akimbo, the legs widespread as usual. It belongs to a type which differs from the others in that the position of the vulva is distorted downwards instead of upwards, and that the outline of the labiea is well marked. This is the type of the Oaksey figure (Man, 1923, p. 141). The figure on the tower of St. Michael's Church at Oxford also belongs to this type, the labiea being clearly defined. Another example of the type is the Romsey Abbey figure (P1. XII, Fig. 29), which has also the spread legs and the arms akimbo of the usual Sheila-na-gig. The attitude, however, is modified by the staff in the right hand. The Romsey figure is worth special consideration. The Abbey, like the church at Kilpeck, is Norman in date, an important point for tracing the origin and date of these figures. The building was a nunnery, and was one of the most important religious houses of the Middle Ages in the South of England. Our present conception of a nunnery is founded on the modern convents which are not of the same type. Throughout the Middle Ages young girls of good position were brought up in nunneries, and at puberty left the convent to be married. It is a truism to say that in all countries women retain the old customs longer than men, and this is most marked where the women live in segregated communities, such as a convent. Our knowledge of the intimate customs of the women of that period is derived only from the vague hearsay evidence of male writers, who were invariably ecclesiastics. The Sheila-na-gig on the walls of the Abbey suggests that the bride may have been prepared for marriage within the convent. The staff is an unusual feature in such figures. As we know little or nothing of the women's customs among our semi-savage ancestors, I suggest that its use was for breaking the hymen as is done in modern Egypt by the bridegroom's fingers (see Man, 1932, p. 64). The Whittlesford relief is the most remarkable of the series. This is the only example I have seen where the male is represented with a Sheila-na-gig. The carved slab is on the church tower (P1. XII, Fig. 32), and the carving is so arranged that the man-animal's body stretches across the top of the window, the head and forequarters on one side, the hindquarters, with exaggerated male genitalia, on the other. The hind feet appear to be human, the head is clearly human, the chin is bearded and the lips are pursed out as in the act of kissing. Had</page><page sequence="7">M. A. MURRAY.-Female Fertility Figures. 99 the figure been represented as standing upright the resemblance to the Dancing Good of the Caverne des Trois Freres would have been very apparent. The Sheila figure is in the Baubo- Phryne or frog attitude, the breasts are represented, and like most of the Sheila figures, no hair is indicated on the head. In the following suggestions as to the psychological reasons for the use and consequent sanctity of the Sheila-na-gig I am greatly indebted to Dr. Sybille Yates for much kind help. I put my theory forward tentatively as a basis for discussion, for so much of the published work on female psychology is founded on the masculine ideas of what a woman should feel or be. Baubo was as essentially divine as Isis or Ishtar, as Kybele or Aphrodite, but she was a goddess of women only. She belonged to that group of goddesses, such as the Bona Dea, from whose rites men were rigorously excluded. What those rites were can only be inferred from the vague hearsay evidence of male writers. It is very evident that the appeal of the Baubo figures and of the Sheila-na-gig was to the sexual side of woman's nature, and in the legend of Baubo the attitude is definitely connected with pleasure and laughter. The religious connection is so strong, both among the heathen and the Christian, as to suggest that some form of homo-sexuality was practised by women as a religious rite. On the other hand, it is possible that the clue to the meaning of the whole of this class of female figures may be found in the Sheila-na-gig. A few years ago, when the Sheila was removed from the tower of St. Michael's Church at Oxford, one of the local newspapers stated (I quote from memory): " All brides were made to look at the figure on their way to church for the wedding." This statement, taken in conjunction with the fact that the ancient figures were found almost exclusively in the rooms and graves of women, seems to show that the use of such figures may have been to rouse and stimulate the sex desires of women. A few experi- ments have been made with these figures, which show that the sight of the photographs and statuettes have a stimulating effect on women; on many of these subjects the sight of priapic figures produced no effect except of disgust or curiosity. It is possible that in the Sheila-na-gig figures the presence of the male is implicit, though only in the Whittlesford example is the male explicit. The figures would then represent the woman prepared for her mate, ready to welcome his embrace. Whether to the bride entering on a new experience or to the woman already married, the appeal of the figures would be the same. The process by which the stimulation is effected appears to be that the woman identifies herself with the figure; she sees herself as in a mirror. Though a woman can conceive without or even against her will, the sexual act is rendered pleasurable to her, and therefore more pleasurable to the man, if she is sufficiently roused to desire it. Whatever may be the right explanation it appears certain that the figures made, and still make, an appeal to women's nature. This then is the reason for their origmal use and long survival; and their importance in the life of women is seen in the fact that the Christian Church was forced to allow them to be placed in conspicuous positions in and on the sacred edifices.
