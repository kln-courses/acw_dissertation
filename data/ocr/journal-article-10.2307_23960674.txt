<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND STUDIES ADDITIONAL NOTES ON THE ROOT ידע IN HEBREW The Hebrew root ידע = Arabic ودع with the meaning 'was still, quiet, at rest, calm, submissive' is now well established.1 Job ix. 5 provides a further example. The Hebrew text runs as follows: המעתיק הרים ולא;דעו ؟؛שר הפכם ؟אפו: which is translated in the R.V.: Which removeth the mountains, and they know it not, When he overturned، them in his anger. The phrase ולא ;דעו, translated 'and they know not', has been variously interpreted by commentators. Some see in it a reference to the speed with which God acts—'they (the mountains) know it not', so quickly is it done.2 Others read ולא ;דע (with Pesh.),3 with God as subject'He perceives it not', so easily and without effort does he dislodge masses of rock from a mountain.4 Others again emend the text more drastically. Suggestions are ולא ;רעו 'without their being broken',5 or, with omission of דנעו ,לא (or, ו;ךעדו) 'and they shake (quake)',6 or ולא ;ודע 'without letting Himself be seen',7 or (ולא ;וךעו (;ז;עו 'and they are no more perceived', i.e. they disappear.8 Even more drastic is the proposal to read המעתיק הרים באפו וערי שדים הפך 'who removeth mountains in his wrath and hath destroyed the cities of Siddim'.5 No emendation is called 1 seeJ.T.S.

God, through earthquake, or by lightning, or by some other means, dislodges great boulders from the mountains, which are thus dis turbed out of their usual static state.1 It is in this sense that Ibn Ezra interprets עד שנהפכו) ללא לדעו 'until they are overturned'). Reference may now be made to four passages in which, in the ancient versions, more particularly the LXX, and in some Hebrew manuscripts, ד has been read in place of ד in a way that suggests that in these passages further evidence of ودع = ידע may be seen.2 First, in Isa. XV. 4 ירע) לךעה 'quivered') is translated in the LXX yvwaerru (= 3.(לךן$ה The phrase נפשו לךעה לו 'his soul shall be quiet, subdued, unto him' would provide suitable sense in a contextofterror and distress. Secondly, in Jer. XV. 12, in the phrase ך؛(רע בך؟.ל בךז.ל 'can iron break (רעע) iron ?', הלרע is read הודע by Old Latin (cognoscet) and in some ten Hebrew manuscripts LXX הלודע—all with the meaning 'know' for ידע. The word הידע could, however, be vocalized הידע (Hiph. imperf.) and the translation would then be'can iron make submissive, subdue, iron?' The third passage is Prov. X. 21, where לרעו רבים is translated in the LXX evlararai V&lt;pr!\a, i.e. ךמות WT'know high (sublime) things'.4 The Vulg. (erudiunt١ and Arabic (5(تعرف also point to ידעו (so too a few Hebrew manuscripts), read as ידעו 'instruct, teach'. 'The lips of the righteous instruct many' would indeed give a suitable contrast to the death of fools through lack of understanding,6 and recalls X. 32, where it has been suggested that לךעון_ might be vocalized ידעון 'the lips of the righteous declare good will'.7 The reading יךעו could, however, be Hiph. imperf of ودع = ידע, with the meaning 'make calm, at ease, tranquil'8—'the lips of the righteous bring tranquillity to many'. And lastly, in Prov. xiii. 20 לרעה בפילים לרוע is usually translated 'and he 1 Duhm, op. cit., p. SI, deletes the word אשר and reads והפכם. This is as unnecessary as it is to read ואשר (with Pesh.), as some do (e.g. Driver and Gray, op. cit., p. 55 of philological notes). The word אשר, which refers to God, is emphatic, as in verses 15 and 17 (see Stevenson, op. cit., loc. cit.). 2 Other examples may be seen in Ecclus. vii. 20 (7 T.S. XXXV. 305), Isa. viii. 9, Jer. ii. 16, Job XX. 26 (on these three passages, see ك.ولإ. xxxvi. 410 f.). 3 So also the Arabic version (تعلم). 4 See P. de Lagarde, Anmerkungen zur griech. Cbersetzung der Proverbien, p. 35, and c. H. Toy, The Book of Proverbs, p. 215. 5 With object اسات 'high things', as LXX. ٠ Read ח؟ר for M.T.'s חסר, with LXX (&gt; לב), Aq., Pesh., Targ., Vulg. 7 Suppl. to Vetus Testamentum, iii, p. 285. 8 A meaning which ירעו perhaps has here; cf. Targ. רעין placant, and M. Jastrow, A Diet. 0ء؛اء م Targumim, &amp;C-, p. 1486. In Syr. نحر Pa. Aph. means 'appease, pacify' (Payne Smith, Thes. Syr. 3943 ff.).</page><page sequence="3">56 NOTES AND STUDIES who associates with fools shall suffer' (רעע). For ؛רוע the LXX reads yvcoodrjcreTai, i.e. 1לודע (cf. X. 9), which could be translated 'shall be made submissive, be subdued'. It is not claimed, of course, that these variant readings represent necessarily the original text. They are adduced only for the indirect support they provide for a root ودع = ידע in Hebrew. In Arabic ودع has also the sense 'laid down, deposited', and several examples of ידע in this sense have already been noted.2 It may be con venient to refer here to two further examples in Job to which F. Wutz has drawn attention. He is almost certainly right in seeing this meaning in הלדעי؟ (II השים) in xxxviii. 33—'Legst du (die Gesetze des Himmels) fest?'3 His emendation of תורישני (xiii. 26) to תודיעני '(und meine Jugendsiinden) als Depot anlegst'4 seems, however, unnecessary, for 'make me to inherit, bring home to me' (תורישני) makes perfectly good sense. Another meaning ودع has in Arabic is 'left alone, said nothing of, had nothing to do with, neglected, forgot'.5 Traces of this meaning may perhaps be seen in two O.T. passages. In Exod. iii. 7 כי לך؟תי את־מקאביו 'for I know his pains' reads somewhat strangely after the preceding words of this verse. May they mean something like 'for I have left his pains alone, have had nothing to do with them', that is, 'I have let them go on, continue' p And in Prov. xiv. 7 no emendation of ובל־לד؟؟ is necessary6 if we translate 'betake thyself from the presence of a foolish man, but leave not alone (do not neglect) lips of knowledge'. Two renderings in the Pesh. seem to point to the equation == ידע ودع == Syr. 7.ب In Ezra iv. 13 ןא؟תם מלכים תהנזק is translated ره ٠٠״ هتذحم لإ ارن 'moreover this will not quieten, subdue, kings'. In the text of Walton's Polyglot the vocalization is N،.؟r (agtioscet) but ؟،*־IT (Aph. ب) is to be preferred as a translation of the Aramaic Hiph. of נזק 'damage'. The second passage is Ps. cxix. 158. Professor G. R. Driver,8 following the lead of I. Eitan,9 has shown that קטט—f( this is the verb in question, not קוט, as is generally supposed—means 'cut', and that the meaning which קטט bears here and in Ps. cxxxix. 21 is 'was ُ So too the Arabic version (سيعرف بهم). 2 See J.T.S., N.S. iii. 55. 3 Das Buck Job, p. 138. * Ibid., p. 54. c. J. Ball, op. cit., p. 227, also suggests תוךיעני, but in the usual sense 'thou makest me know'. 5 Lane, Arab.-Engl.

The rendering of וא؟קו؟טה in Ps. cxix. 158 in the Pesh., namely ^؛,٠؛-؛ is indeed striking. It can hardly mean 'and I knew', but rather perhaps 'and I was still, quiet, submissive' (through vexation, grief). D. WiNTON Thomas D.
