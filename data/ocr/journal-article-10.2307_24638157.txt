Thorsteinsson Copenhagen Copenhagen University runar.thorsteinsson@gmail.com Abstract Due to his background as a Platonist, Justin Martyr's relation to Stoic philosophy has not gained as much attention from scholars as his relation to Platonism, and his relationship to contemporary Stoicism has been lar gely overlooked. The present essay provides an overview and analysis of Justin's references and allusions to Stoics and Stoic philosophy, with particular focus on his description and criticism of their cosmology and theology (cosmo-theology). The question of where Justin received his knowledge of Stoic cosmo-theology is also addressed, and in order to assess that question a survey of contemporary Stoic cosmo-theology is offered. The essay shows that Justin strongly rejected the Stoic doctrines on the nature of God as a corporeal and changeable being, on the world-cycles and conflagration, and on fate. Moreover, Justin does not seem to have had any thorough knowledge of Stoic philosophy, nor does his criticism of Stoic cosmo-theology appear to have issued directly from his encounter with contemporary Stoics. His arguments against it seem rather to have been more or less based on stock criticism. Introduction Justin of Flavia Neapolis (c. 100-65 ce) was one of the most influential figures of second-century Christianity. He was also one of the first Christians to enter into direct debates with the traditional philosophical schools. Most scholars agree that Justin's philosophical background is to be found mainly in Platonism, that is to say, the contemporary 'Middle Platonism'.1 This is well 1 See the overview in Charles Nahm, 'The Debate on the "Platonism" of Justin Martyr', SecCent 9 (1992), pp. 129-51.

Correspondingly, in terms of cosmology and theology (cosmo-theology), Justin's main philosophical opponents were the Stoics. While much has been done by scholars to clarify the question of Justin's relationship to Platonism, much less has been done with respect to Stoicism, and his relation to contemporary Stoics has not gained much attention. That Justin viewed the Stoics as his primary philosophical adversaries seems clear enough from his remarks in the Apologies, and it seems to be implied in the Dialogue as well. According to the second chapter of the Dialogue,Dialogue, Stoicism was actually the first philosophy to which he turned when he decided to consult the philosophical schools in his search for knowledge about God. However, judging from Justin's description of his Stoic teacher, Stoicism turned out to be the philosophical school which was least concerned with God (i.e. compared to Aristotelianism, Pythagoreanism, and Platonism; 2.2-6): Justin learned 'nothing new [in Stoicism] about God', for his teacher 'had no knowledge of God, nor did he consider such knowledge necessary' (2.3).2 This is practically the only thing Justin says explicitly about Stoicism in the Dialogue. Does this mean that Justin really believed that the Stoics were unconcerned with God and theology? No, it does not: already in the opening chapter of the Dialogue, Justin implicitly alludes to Stoic teaching about God (1.4-5), and, more importantly, in the Apologies he Philosophy', CH 56 (1987), pp. 303-19; M.

Justin's description of the Stoic teacher's total disinterest in God is rather part of a literary invention which serves a particular rhetorical purpose: the journey from one teacher to another portrays a cumulative process, by which Justin wished to express his theological stance vis-a-vis the philosophical schools, Stoicism being the least appropriate one in that respect (i.e. compared to the other three schools mentioned).3 But what exactly does Justin say about Stoicism and Stoics in his writings? What is it in their cosmo-theological system that he opposes, and why? Furthermore, from where does Justin's knowledge of Stoic philosophy come? Did he gain that knowledge by way of his Middle Platonic schooling or through direct engagement with contemporary Stoicism? In other words, how well, or badly, informed was he of the Stoicism of his day? The purpose of this essay is to address these questions by analysing Justin's criticism of Stoicism and comparing his sayings with several of our most important sources for contemporary Stoics.4 Stoic Cosmo-theology Before moving into the analysis of Justin's texts, it will be useful to get a general overview of Stoic cosmo-theology.5 According to 3 See further Runar M. Thorsteinsson, 'By Philosophy Alone: Reassessing Justin's Christianity and his Turn from Platonism', Early Christianity (forth coming). That Justin's account in Dialogue 2 describes a cumulative process was suggested to me by George Boys-Stones during his visit to Copenhagen University in Apr. 2009. 4 Translations of Epictetus follow the LCL (Oldfather); those of Marcus Aurelius either the LCL (Haines) or the OWC (Farquharson). Translations of Hierocles follow Ilaria Ramelli, Hierocles the Stoic: Elements of Ethics, Fragments,Fragments, and Excerpts, trans. D. Konstan (WGW 28; Atlanta, GA: Society of Biblical Literature, 2009). References to and translations of Musonius Rufus follow Cora E. Lutz, 'Musonius Rufus: "The Roman Socrates'", YCS 10 (1947), pp. 32-147 (referred to by number of discourse, page numberfs], and line[s] of the Greek text). Lutz follows the edition of O. Hense (C. Musonii RufiRufi reliquiae [Leipzig: Teubner, 1905]). Unless otherwise noted, translations of other ancient texts follow the LCL. It should be noted that Cleomedes is not included in this study, not only because the date of his texts is very uncertain (possible dates ranging from 50 bce to 250 ce), but also because his discussion is mostly restricted to astronomy (for discussion, see Alan C. Bowen and Robert B. Todd, Cleomedes' Lectures on Astronomy: A Translation of of The Heavens with an Introduction and Commentary [Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004]). 5 Helpful overviews of Stoic cosmo-theology are found in A.

THORSTEINSSON 536 Stoic theory, the world is constituted by two principles (άρχαί): the active principle (το ποιούν) and the passive principle (το πάσχον). The latter is a substance without quality, i.e. matter (ΰλη), which is acted upon by the active principle in it, which is reason (λόγος), i.e. God.6 The two principles are interdependent and always con joined, and both are corporeal. Against the Platonists and Aristotelians, the Stoics held that it was impossible for incorpor eals to have causal efficacy; only the corporeal, a body, can act or be acted upon.7 This doctrine is of fundamental consequence for Stoic theology, because it means that God must be corporeal through and through: 'God is mixed with matter, pervading all of it and so shaping it, structuring it, and making it into the world.'8 This also explains why theology in Stoicism is understood as part of physics (the study of the physical world and its changes),9 as well as why it is often more appropriate to speak of Stoic 'cosmo-theology' rather than separating the two into cosmology and theology. Whatever else God is in Stoic philosophy, God is a corporeal being who permeates the universe as a whole. The Stoic principles, the active and the passive, are not to be confused with elements (στοιχίΐa), which, unlike the former, are generated, endowed with form, and destructible. The elements are four: fire and air (active), and water and earth (passive),10 of which the first element, fire, enjoys a special status. For there are two kinds of fire, one destructive and uncreative, i.e. 'ordinary' fire (and an 'ordinary' element), and one special kind, namely, the creative and productive fire (πΰρ τεχνικόν), which is in fact identical with God.11 This is the very fire from which the world is created and into which it periodically returns, in perpetuum. As Aristocles reports, according to Stoic doctrine, At certain fated times the entire world is subject to conflagration (εκπυροΰσθαι),(εκπυροΰσθαι), and then is reconstituted afresh (err' αύθις πάλιν διακοσ μ(ΐσθαι).μ(ΐσθαι). But the primary fire (πρώτον πΰρ) is as it were a sperm (σπέρμα) which possesses the principles (τους λόγους) of all things London: Duckworth, 1989), pp. 69-94; Michael J.

The nexus and succession of these is fate, knowledge, truth, and an inevitable and inescapable law of what exists. In this way everything in the world is excellently organized as in a perfectly ordered society.12 Thus, the universe is subject to endless world-cycles, each of which ends with a cosmic conflagration (ίκττύρωσις) at which everything, including the four elements, is destroyed, except for the creative fire which is God. During the period of conflag ration there is only God and there is only goodness and pure rationality: 'no evil whatever remains, but the whole is at that time prudent (φρόνιμον) and sage (σοφον)'.13 Since the world is created and designed according to a divine plan, which can only be perfect, its constitution cannot be otherwise than perfect. Each new world is therefore identical with the previous one,14 securely determined by the 'seminal reason of the universe' (σ7(σ7τ(ρματίκόν λόγον τον κόσμου),15 that is to say, God and fate. According to Stoic belief, God is an immortal, all-encompassing, and perfectly rational being, who is the creator and sustainer of the cosmos. God is infinitely good, and takes providential care of the world, being 'as it were the father of all, both in general and in that particular part of him which is all-pervading, and which is called many names according to its various powers'.16 God is Zeus, Reason, Providence, Fate, and Nature.17 God is also the soul of the living cosmos and its governing principle (το ήγεμονικόν). At the same time, God is indeed the Cosmos itself—or so some Stoics believed.18 The Stoic deity is thus not only a being who sees to it that the wheels of the world start turning, but the deity 12 Cited in Eusebius, Praep. ev. 15.14.2 (trans. Long and Sedley). Cf.

THORSTEINSSON 538 is also an intimate part of the world itself, an immanent being who is at work everywhere in nature and as Nature. The vehicle through which this work is performed is 'breath' (πνεύμα), a mixture of air and fire (the active elements),19 which, on the one hand, completely permeates and makes the whole world a single coherent body, and, on the other, functions as a principle of internal coherence for individual bodies.20 This of course includes human beings, who hold a special position among creatures on earth as the only beings who partake of divine reason, Aoyo?. In fact, according to some Stoics, the world itself was created for the sake of human beings (and gods).21 As a rule, in Stoic philosophy the primary emphasis is put on the function and well-being of the whole rather than of the individual parts.22 As a human being, one must always consider oneself as part of a whole: 'Man himself has come to be in order to contemplate and imitate the world, being by no means perfect, but a tiny constituent of that which is perfect.'23 Thus, when the Stoics taught that the goal of human life is to 'live consistently with nature', they did not simply mean that human beings must live naturally as opposed to unnaturally.24 Rather, with the benefit and purpose of the whole in mind, that is to say, with Nature in mind rather than nature, their point was that one must constantly observe and follow the will of Nature, i.e. the will of Reason, of God.25 As one scholar well puts it, to 'follow nature' in Stoic terms was 'to understand the rationale of the divine administration of the world, visible in the whole world process, and thereby to imitate the divine principle. The identification of the world and of God in this argument shows that Stoic ethics is a fundamentally theological theory.'26 This survey shows how strictly physical and 'down-to-earth' Stoic theology was, and, again, how closely related it was to 19 Aetius 1-7-33; Alexander of Aphrodisias, Mixt. 224.14-17. 20 Long and Sedley, Hellenistic Philosophers, p. 289. 21 See Cicero, Nat. d. 2.133; Gellius 7.1.1-13; Lactantius, Ir. 13.9-10. 22 For discussion of this emphasis in relation to the question of divine providence in Stoicism, see Thomas Benatoui'l, 'How Industrious can Zeus Be?

As a theory, Stoic cosmo-theology was also highly successful in the ancient world: Stoic cosmology was one of the most imaginative and compelling intellectual constructs devised in antiquity to explain the structure and appearance of the universe: its conception of the divine and fiery mind penetrating all parts of the universe, of the resulting cosmic sympathy between all these parts, of the chain of fate in which every event is linked to every other, and of the fiery conflag ration into which the universe dissolves at certain times—these strik ing theories attracted many adherents to Stoicism during the two centuries following the founding of the school in c.300 B.C.27 Our sources suggest that later Stoics subscribed to the basic outline of 'orthodox' cosmo-theology, though with some vari ations, as we shall see below. However, the sources also suggest that at the turn of the Common Era the Stoic interest in the cosmological aspects of theology started to give way to an increasing interest in its ethical aspects.28 During this same period, intensive open attacks were issued against Stoicism by the Platonists in particular, mirroring an ongoing cosmo theological battle between the two schools of thought.29 As we shall see, Justin, the Christian philosopher and former Platonist, tried to, and perhaps did, contribute to the defeat of Stoicism in that battle. Justin's Criticism of Stoic Cosmo-theology No ancient reader of Justin's Dialogue who was fairly familiar with the teachings of the Stoics would have taken his implication seriously about the Stoics being ignorant of or unconcerned with God and theology (2.3). Those who took his account in chapter 2 literally as describing a historical event would have understood that Justin's Stoic teacher did not represent genuine Stoicism, and 27 Michael Lapidge, 'Stoic Cosmology and Roman Literature, First to Third Centuries A.D.' in H. Temporini and W. Haase (eds.), ANRW 2.36.3 (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1989), pp. 1379-80. 28 See Runar M. Thorsteinsson, Roman Christianity and Roman Stoicism: A Comparative Comparative Study of Ancient Morality (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 15. This is not to say that first- and second-century CE Stoics neg lected physics (or logic) altogether—clearly they did not. But the fact remains that, according to the extant sources, the primary Stoic interest in this period was devoted to ethics. 29 See Troels Engberg-Pedersen, 'Setting the Scene: Stoicism and Platonism in the Transitional Period in Ancient Philosophy', in T. Rasimus, T. Engberg-Pedersen, and I. Dunderberg (eds.), Stoicism in Early Christianity (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2010), pp. 1-14, esp. 10—12.</page><page sequence="8">RUNAR Μ. THORSTEINSSON 540 those who were more open to Justin's inventiveness as an author would have grasped the rhetorical character of his description, namely, its cumulative structure and sense. The latter under standing would probably have been quite clear to most readers who also had access to Justin's two Apologies, in which a completely different, if mostly negative, view of Stoic philosophy appears. As noted in the introduction, Dialogue 2.3 is the only explicit reference to the Stoics in the Dialogue, apart from the list of philosophical schools given in 2.1.30 Implicit references are found in chapter x, all related to theology and all with negative implications.31 The references are more frequent in the Apologies,Apologies, explicitly (1 Apol. 20.2, 4; 2 Apol. 7.3-4, 8-9; 8.1; 13.2) as well as implicitly (e.g. 1 Apol. 19.5; 25.2; 43.1; 44.11; 57.1; 60.8-10; 2 Apol. 6.3; 9.4). These betray a more complex view of Stoicism on Justin's part: while the unfavourable opinion of Stoic cosmo-theology remains prevalent, it is clear that he greatly admired their ethics. In Second Apology 8.1 Justin draws a parallel between Christians who are being oppressed and Stoics who 'were honourable (κόσμιοι) at least in their ethical teaching' and, because of that, were 'hated and put to death'.32 For, as Justin explains, the 'wicked demons'—the very demons who are responsible for the oppression of Christians (cf. 1.2-3; 1 Apol. 5)—'have always effected that all those who ever so little strived to live by Logos and to shun vice be hated' (8.2). In other words, while the Christians, according to Justin (8.3), are certainly hated more because the wicked demons are more eager to stir up hatred against those who base their lives on the 'whole of Logos' (= Christ) and not just a part of it (like the Stoics), the moral integrity of the Stoics is comparable to that of the Christians. 30 I.e. Platonists, Stoics, Peripatetics, 'Theoretics', and Pythagoreans. The identity of the 'Theoretics' (θεωρητικοί) is still unknown; but Robert Joly's suggestion that θεωρητικοί is a secondary, explanatory gloss for a Pythagorean strand (called μαθηματικοί, more theoretically interested than oi άκουσματικοί) seems reasonable; see Christianisme et Philosophic: Etudes sur Justin et les ApologistesApologistes grecs du deuxieme siecle (Brussels: Editions de l'Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 1973), pp. 30-1. On the words ούδί θεωρητικοί as a gloss, see Wolfgang Schmid, 'Friihe Apologetik und Platonismus: Ein Beitrag zur Interpretation des Prooms von Justins Dialogus', in ERMHNEIA: Festschrift Otto Otto Regenbogen (Heidelberg: Winter, 1952), pp. 166-9. 31 Needless to say, since implicit references are by definition only hinted at, it is quite possible that there are further implicit references to Stoicism in the Dialogue.Dialogue. In this essay I only deal with those that seem most clear to me. 32 2 Apol. 8.1: και τους από των Στωικών δε δογμάτων, επειδή καν τον ηθικόν λόγον κόσμιοι γεγόνασιν ... μεμισήσθαι και πεψονενσθαι.</page><page sequence="9">JUSTIN AND STOIC COSMO-THEOLOGY 541 Or at least this goes for the Stoics specifically mentioned in the passage, whose morality got them shunned and killed: Heraclitus and Musonius Rufus. These are actually the only individual 'Stoics' mentioned by Justin in his three extant writings, besides the anonymous 'Stoic teacher' in Dialogue 2. The fact that Heraclitus was not a Stoic at all—he lived long before Stoicism even came into being (d. c.480 bce)—does not devalue Justin's high regard for Stoic morality; he clearly believed that Heraclitus was a Stoic, perhaps because he was aware of the influence of Heraclitus on Stoicism.33 But it is nevertheless curious that Justin includes him here rather than a number of other possible examples of prominent Stoics who were killed,34 especially since there are no other sources available for Heraclitus having been 'put to death'.35 One might therefore be tempted to see here a textual corruption of some kind, that is, that the name Heraclitus has been confused with some other name, which is not farfetched per se considering the textual history and generally bad condition of Justin's text.36 But the fact that Justin says that Heraclitus has been 'mentioned before' in his text(s) makes this unlikely: Heraclitus was indeed mentioned in First Apology 46.3, where he was described, together with Socrates, as a 'Christian' before Christ, and associated with the concept of Aoyos, for which Heraclitus was most famous. No Stoic has been 'mentioned before' by name in the Apologies. Hence, we have to settle for the answer that Justin simply did not know better (we shall return briefly to Heraclitus further below). But the oddness continues: the claim that Musonius Rufus (c.(c.(c. 25-100 CE) was 'put to death' is also curious. There is no evidence that he was executed or anything of the sort. True, he was twice exiled from Rome, as were most philosophers during the troublesome period of Nero and the Flavian dynasty. But, as far as we know, Musonius was on good terms with the Roman authorities at the time of his death around 100 CE.37 Again, Justin 33 On the relationship between Heraclitus and Stoicism, see A. A. Long, 'Heraclitus and Stoicism', Philosophia (Athens) 5-6 (1975-6), pp. 133-56. 34 E.g. Rubellius Plautus, Barea Soranus, or Thrasea Paetus, all condemned to death by Nero in 62-6 CE. 35 Cf. Marcus Aurelius, Med. 3.3; Diogenes Laertius 9.3-5. 36 On the textual history of Justin's text, see Charles Munier, Justin: ApologieApologie pour les Chretiens. Introduction, texte critique, traduction et notes (SC 507; Paris: Cerf, 2006), pp. 83-9. On the poor condition of the text, see Marcovich, Dialogus, p. viii. 37 See the overview in Thorsteinsson, Roman Christianity, pp. 40-3. In fact, Musonius was on such good terms with the emperor Vespasian that he was the only philosopher we know of who was exempted when the emperor banished</page><page sequence="10">RUNAR Μ. THORSTEINSSON 542 appears to be misinformed about the Stoics. On the other hand, the fact that he mentions Musonius as a celebrated example of Stoic moral integrity is anything but curious: Musonius is widely praised in ancient sources precisely for this reason.38 We also know that he was one of the most distinguished Stoics of the first century CE, contrary to what one might believe on the basis of our lack of sources on him. When Origen made a short list of people from Greek and Roman history who above others should be considered 'a model of the highest form of life' (παράδειγμα τού αρίστου αρίστου βίου), he chose to mention Hercules and Odysseus from the 'heroic age', Socrates from 'later times', and Musonius 'among those who have lived very recently'.39 This illustrates why it would have been appropriate for Justin to include Musonius as the only (real) Stoic mentioned in his writings, especially in relation to ethics and morality. There are some indications that Justin may in fact have been influenced by the ethics of Musonius, whether directly or indirectly: according to Robert M. Grant, Justin is the first author to say that Christians should marry only for the begetting of children (1 Apol. 29. i).40 Such a view of marriage was characteristic of the teaching of Musonius (although Musonius also stressed that the purpose of marriage is 'perfect companion ship and mutual love of husband and wife').41 Unlike his view of Stoic ethics, however, Justin's opinion of Stoic cosmo-theology was decidedly negative. It is important to note that when Justin criticizes Stoic philosophy in this respect he is probably doing so primarily as a former Platonist, and not necessarily on the basis of some cosmo-theological views adopted at or subsequent to his turn to Christianity.42 In the description of the dialogue between Justin the Platonist and the 'old man' who managed to turn him to Christianity {Dial. 3-7), nowhere are Justin's main postulates in metaphysics questioned or invalidated, including Platonic tenets about God as unchangeable, incorporeal, all philosophers from Rome in 71 CE. We also know that Musonius did some diplomatic work on behalf of the emperor Vitellius in 69 CE (see Tacitus, Hist. 3■81)· 3 See Dio Chrysostom, Rhod. 122 (= Or. 31.122); Pliny, Ep. 3.11; Philostratus, Vit. Apoll. 4.46; Origen, Cels. 3.66. 39 Cels. 3.66. 40 Robert M. Grant, Greek Apologists of the Second Century (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1988), pp. 66—7.

In other words, the fundamentally negative view of Stoic cosmo-theology is in all likelihood something which Justin brought with him from Platonism, the anti-Stoic philoso phy par excellence in cosmo-theological matters. This conclusion is supported by the fact that much of his criticism of Stoicism corresponds closely with the polemic of contemporary Platonists, such as Plutarch (c.45-120 ce), Alcinous (second century ce), and Numenius (mid/late second century ce).47 The main topics criticized by Justin were frequently taken up by the Platonists in their controversy with the Stoics, namely, the nature of God as a corporeal being,48 the Stoic world-cycles and 43 Cf. also ι Apol. 9.3; 13.4; 61.11; 63.1; 2 Apol. 6.1, 3; 10.8; 12.4; 13.4; 20.2; Dial. 23.2; 127.2. 44 This is well argued in Tessa Rajak, 'Talking at Trypho: Christian Apologetic as Anti-Judaism in Justin's Dialogue with Trypho the Jew', in M. Edwards, M. Goodman, and S. Price (eds.), Apologetics in the Roman Empire: Pagans,Pagans, Jews, and Christians (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), pp. 59 80. 45 I.e. the 'old man' does not reject the notion that souls can be immortal, only that they unquestionably are so. It is important to the Christian teacher that this is entirely up to God: 'Those who are deemed worthy of God will never perish, but the others will be subjected to punishment as long as God allows them to exist and as long as he wants them to be punished' (5.3).

We shall first address Justin's treatment of the topic under discussion and then compare his treatment with contemporary Stoic sources. We shall also include in the discussion two other topics of Stoic theology which Justin criticizes more implicitly, namely, the question of divine providence and divine reward and punishment. The The The Nature of God Not everything in Stoic theology is criticized or rejected by Justin. Whether he himself would have acknowledged it or not, he does in fact agree with the Stoics on a number of issues re garding the nature and characteristics of God: much like the Stoics, Justin holds that God is 'unbegotten',51 i.e. underived, and 'needful of nothing'.52 God is also 'prescient'53 and 'surveys all things, knows all things'.54 In line with the Stoics, Justin believes that, as the 'Father' of human beings,55 God is 'sympa thetic towards all people', 'just and good',56 and 'a just observer of all'.57 As 'the Father of righteousness and temperance and the other virtues', God accepts only those who imitate him in that respect.58 Similarly to the Stoics, Justin also believes that God created the world for the sake of human beings59 (but not for the sake of [secondary] gods, too, as some Stoics claimed). Interestingly, Justin comes very close to Stoic claims when he writes that God is 'impassible' or 'passionless ' (απαθής).60 By that he does not mean that God 'remains unmoved like a stone',61 49 E.g. Plutarch, Stoic, rep. 1051F-1052B; 1053B-D; Comm. not. 1074F-1075E; 1077B-D; E. Delph. 388E-389C; Alcinous, Epit. 14.3, 6 (169.32-42, 170.22-42); 25.4 (178.12-22). 50 E.g.

Rather, as an argument against traditional polytheistic belief and anthropomorphic descriptions of God, against which the Stoics argued as well,62 it means that God is in no way affected by the passions, as, for instance, lust for women (one of Justin's examples). God has no passions—a char acteristic Stoic argument. Moreover, in 2 Apology 6.3 Justin ap pears to allude to a Stoic concept in relation to his theological epistemology when he speaks of the designation 'God' as 'the intuition implanted in human nature of an inexpressible reality' (πράγματος(πράγματος δυσΐζηγήτου έμφυτος rfj φύσει, των ανθρώπων δόξα). Το be sure, as suggested by the fact that he uses the word δόξα instead of the standard Stoic term πρόληψις ('preconception'),63 Justin's line of thought probably derives from Middle Platonic adoption of Stoic epistemology,6 of which he was not necessarily aware. But it is nonetheless in basic agreement with the Stoic notion.65 All this shows that there are in fact some common traits in Justin's theology and that of the Stoics, whether these traits are there because he drew directly on Stoicism, or because he adopted Stoic points of view through Middle Platonism, or simply because some of the features described above were shared by a number of theological traditions in antiquity. However, when we turn our attention to the question of God's ontology, i.e. the physical nature of God, a totally different pic ture emerges. At the end of 2 Apology 7, Justin states that the Stoics must be wrong in their teaching of principles and corpor eals (ev τω περί αρχών και σωμάτων Aoyo»),66 and about God as a 62 See Keimpe Algra, 'Stoic Philosophical Theology and Graeco-Roman Religion', in Salles (ed.), God and Cosmos in Stoicism, pp. 224—51. 63 Diogenes Laertius defines Stoic πράληψις as 'a general notion which comes by the gift of nature' (evvoia φυσική τών καθόλου) (7-54), including a notion of the deity. As Algra notes, the concept of πρόληψις stands at the very basis of Stoic theology in terms of epistemology ('Stoic Philosophical Theology', p. 228). For a general discussion of the preconception of God in Stoicism, see Algra, 'Stoic Theology', pp. 157-9. So Andresen, 'Justin', p. 177. Cf. e.g. Plutarch, Stoic, rep. 1041E; Seneca, Ep.Ep. 117.6: 'there is implanted in everyone an idea concerning deity' (omnibus insitainsita de dis opinio est). 65 Cf. also Dial. 93.1, where Justin uses the phrase φυσικαι ίννοιαι ('innate notions'), which corresponds to the Stoic φυσικαι or κοιναι ίννοιαι ('common notions'); and 2 Apol. 14.2: ,it is in the nature of man to know good and evil'. 66 The manuscript has ασωμάτων ('incorporeals'), followed by Marcovich (ed.), Apologiae, ad loc. (so also Munier, Apologie, ad loc.), but I agree with Denis Minns and Paul Parvis that the text must be corrupt (Justin, Philosopher</page><page sequence="14">RUNAR Μ. THORSTEINSSON 546 corporeal and changeable being (7.8-9). For when they maintain that 'God is nothing else than the things which are ever turning and altering and dissolving into the same things' (μηδέν είναι θεόν \ / &gt; 67 \/&lt;\י\י ׳ \ י י י \ \ י παραπαρα τρεπομζνα και αΛλοωνμβνα και αναλυομζνα 61 s־ τα αυτα aetj, they betray that their understanding (κατάληψιν) is limited to destructible things only. Moreover, when they claim that God is part of changeable and destructible things, this means that God is part not only of good things but of evil things as well, which, in turn, means that the Stoics must understand God as 'emerging both in part and in whole in every wickedness' (διά τε των των μερών καί δια. του ολου εν πάση κακία γινόμενον) (7-9)· This, however, is utterly false, says Justin. As he writes elsewhere, God is 'unmixed with evil' (άνεπιμίκτου κακίας, I Apol. 6.1) and 'su perior to changeable things' (κρείττόν τι τών μεταβαλλόμενων, 1 Apol.Apol. 20.2).68 Several things are worth noting from this description of Justin's. First of all, it shows that he was at least familiar with the Stoic teaching of principles and corporeals, the first two (out of five) subdivisions of Stoic physics,69 as well as of God's phys ical involvement in the cosmic cycles (discussed below). Also, the fact that he uses the word κατάληψίς in an ironic fashion when he describes Stoic epistemology, that is to say, their (limited) 'understanding' of God and the world, implies that he knew that the word was used in Stoic circles as a technical term for and and Martyr: Apologies [OECT; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009], p. 295, n. 6 [ad loc.]). In Stoic cosmo-theology everything that exists is corporeal, including God (the four incorporeals acknowledged in Stoic philosophy, void, place, time, and the 'sayables', do not 'exist'; they 'subsist'). As Minns and Parvis note, 'corporeals' (or 'bodies') (σώματα) and 'principles' (άρχαί) are the first two (out of five) subdivisions of Stoic physics, according to Diogenes Laertius 7.132. Minns and Parvis also point out that the same is probably true of the curious statement in Diogenes Laertius 7.134 (LCL) that 'the principles are incorporeal' (ασωμάτους «ναι τας άρχas): 'There is an analogous textual problem in Diog. Laert. VII.134, the only text which appears to assert that Stoics spoke of incorporeal first principles. There, however, "incorporeal" is a conjecture of Lipsius, following the Suida, whereas the MS of Diogenes Laertius read σώματα (ed. Long)' (ibid.). 67 Cf. also ι Apol. 19.5. 68 Cf. ι Apol. 13.4; Dial. 23.2. 69 Diogenes Laertius 7.132. According to him, the other three subdivisions are: '(3) about elements; (4) about the gods; (5) about bounding surfaces and space whether filled or empty'. Diogenes adds that while this is a division into species ((Ι&amp;ίκώς), 'the generic division (ytviKais) is into three parts, dealing with (i.) the universe; (ii.) the elements; (iii.) the subject of causation'.</page><page sequence="15">JUSTIN AND STOIC COSMO-ΤΗEOLOGY 547 cognition.70 Secondly, if compared with his other descriptions of God (as listed above), the account shows very clearly that Justin's theological disagreement with the Stoics is basically a matter of physics; it is a matter of strictly physical cosmo-theology rather than just theology. Thirdly, the account also shows that there is indeed a fundamental disagreement be tween Justin and the Stoics in that respect: against the latter, Justin sides with the Platonists in holding that God is incorpor eal and that the physical nature of God does not change. This is evidently a position which he brought with him from Platonism, judging from the definition of God found in the Dialogue which, according to that account, Justin uttered as a Platonist: God is 'the Being who always has the same nature in the same manner' (το κατά τά αυτά καΐ ο'ισαντως aei ίχον, Dial. 3·5)·71 The same writing informs us that, according to Justin the Platonist, God is 'beyond all essence' («7·έκλινα πάσης ουσίας, 4■ 1 )&gt; and that, ac cording to Justin the Christian, God 'cannot be contained in any place, not even in the whole universe, for he existed even before the universe was created' (τόπω τ6 αχώρητος και τω κόσμω ολω, ο ς ye ήν και πριν τον κόσμον γενέσθαι, 127-2).72 Fourthly, while 2 Apology Apology ך may seem to suggest that, in line with the Middle Platonists, Justin dissented from the thought that God could be connected with matter, other passages indicate that this was in fact not the case. In 1 Apology 59.1 Justin writes that Plato said that 'God made the Universe by changing formless matter (ϋλην(ϋλην άμορφον)', that is to say, that God made direct contact with matter when God created the world. As scholars have noted, here Justin's reading of Plato appears to be somewhat Stoicized: Plato himself does not connect God with matter in his cosmogony (in the Timaeus) and he does not use the word ΰληΰλη in that context.73 The fact that in 1 Apology 10.2 Justin presents it as the Christian view that God 'formed all things out of unformed matter'74 (according to Justin, Plato took this idea from Moses) also suggests that he does not oppose the 70 On κατάληψκ as a technical term in Stoicism, see Long and Sedley, Hellenistic Hellenistic Philosophers, pp. 256-7. 71 Note that the 'old man' is 'pleased' with these words of Justin's. Cf. also Plato, Phaed. 78c; Soph. 248A; Resp. 6.484B. 72 Cf. Dial. 127.2 (God 'comes to no place...but always remains in his place, wherever it may be'). 73 See Minns and Parvis, Justin, p. 233, n. 1. 74 Cf. also the interesting parallel in the (Hellenistic) Jewish writing of Wis. 11:17: God's 'all-powerful hand... created the world out of formless matter (ef άμορφου ύλης)'.</page><page sequence="16">RUNAR Μ. THORSTEINSSON 548 notion per se that God can be connected with matter. Rather, what he appears to be opposing in 2 Apology ך is the thought that the physical nature of God, as a corporeal being, can and does change, and that God is connected with everything in the world, including destructible and evil things. But Justin does not seem to connect the origin of evil with that of matter.75 Apart from Justin's somewhat more relaxed attitude towards matter, his critique of Stoic cosmo-theology basically agrees with contemporary Middle Platonic sources. Alcinous, for instance, finds it 'absurd' to hold that God is a corporeal being.76 Similarly, Plutarch ridicules the Stoic idea that God can be made of something destructible,77 and he criticizes the Stoics for making God the origin of evil.78 In his writing Against the Stoics Stoics on Common Conceptions Plutarch presents his attack against the Stoics as a counter-attack, claiming that certain Stoics were 'bitterly and spitefully vehement against the 79 Academy'. But what makes his claim somewhat suspect is the fact that he never indicates who these people were, and he does not mention any contemporary Stoics. Instead, in his critique, he refers almost exclusively to the Early Stoics, especially Chrysippus (c.280-206 bce). This goes for his work On Stoic Self-ContradictionsSelf-Contradictions as well. To be sure, in Plutarch's time the Early Stoics, Chrysippus in particular, represented the main au thority for Stoic doctrine. But the fact is that Plutarch sometimes treats his adversaries quite unjustly, at times applying stock criti cism and misrepresenting their philosophy,80 and he seems to take little or no account of potential philosophical developments or modifications occurring among later Stoics. Alcinous mentions no individual Stoic at all, not even Chrysippus and certainly no contemporary Stoic. 75 So also Erwin R.

However, as we saw above, he mentions two 'Stoics' by name in relation to the sub ject of ethics, one of whom he mistook for a Stoic (Heraclitus), whereas the other one—the only real Stoic—was a close contem porary of Justin's, namely, Musonius Rufus. Did Justin's know ledge and criticism of Stoic cosmo-theology spring directly from his engagement with contemporary Stoics? Or did he, too, rely on stock criticism based on old-time controversy? Elsewhere I have argued that parts of the 'disputations' described in 2 Apology Apology 3 between Justin and a philosopher called Crescens are echoed at intervals in the subsequent text, and that this Crescens, whom Justin calls a 'Cynic' (3.7), was in fact a Stoic.81 While it gives us only a handful of hints of the content of the debate as a whole, if this reading is correct, Crescens the Stoic had openly criticized and mocked the Christians for at least three things: (a) for not 'committing suicide', if they were so eager to be with God and so fearless of death as they claimed (4.1); (b) for believing that God was their 'helper', despite the fact that they were being oppressed (5.1); (c) and for holding that the wicked will be punished in eternal fire, thereby threatening people and wishing them 'to live virtuously through fear' (9.1). Also, in relation to (c) and to Justin's claim that lawgivers justly punish those who violate 'good commandments', Crescens ap pears to have pointed out that there are different opinions among lawgivers of what counts as good and what counts as bad (9.3). Again, these are only vague indications of what the debate was all about, most of which do not have any direct bearing on the subject under discussion in the present essay. But if my recon struction of Crescens' identity as a Stoic philosopher is valid, it shows that Justin did engage contemporary Stoics, or at least this one Stoic. That, in turn, suggests that Justin's description and criticism of their cosmo-theology may have issued directly from his encounter with contemporary Stoics. Do our sources for con temporary Stoic cosmo-theology give support for such an inference? The increasing interest in ethics in the Roman period is evi dent from the choice of subject in the extant writings and lec tures of the Stoics. Correspondingly, physics, including the physical aspect of cosmo-theology, is generally not as prominent in these sources. It is therefore not at all surprising that 81 Runar Μ. Thorsteinsson, *Justin's Debate with Crescens the Stoic', Ζ AC (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="18">RUNAR Μ. THORSTEINSSON 550 Musonius Rufus pays so little attention to cosmo-theology in his lectures. (As a first-century CE figure, Musonius is strictly speak ing not an exact contemporary of Justin's, but he is nonetheless relevant for the present study as the only [real] Stoic mentioned by the latter.) To be sure, there is no question that Musonius firmly anchors his ethics in theology: In general, of all creatures on earth man alone resembles God (μίμημα θεού θεού ίατίν) and has the same virtues that he has, since we can imagine nothing even in the gods better than prudence, justice, courage, and temperance. Therefore, as God, through the possession of these vir tues, is unconquered by pleasure or greed, is superior to desire, envy, and jealousy [i.e. the passions]; is high-minded, beneficent, and kindly (for such is our conception of God), so also man in the image of him, when living in accord with nature, should be thought of as being like him.82 Furthermore, 'the common father of all men and gods, Zeus, bids you and exhorts you to [study philosophy]. His command and law is that man be just and honest, beneficent, temperate, high-minded, superior to pain, superior to pleasure, free of all envy and all malice; to put it briefly, the law of Zeus bids man be good (αγαθόν eivai xeXevei τον ανθρωπον 6 νόμος ό τοΰ Διός). But being good is the same as being a philosopher.'83 Also, we do have a small fragment attributed to Musonius in which he ex plains the cosmological processes of change and transformation (τροπής(τροπής και μίταβολτ^ς), including of divine beings (τά dela) and the four elements.8 But, otherwise, in none of the extant lec tures does he address the question of the physical nature of God (or gods).85 There is no good reason to doubt that Musonius followed the basic outline of mainstream Stoic cosmo-theology, although his expressions about the divine are often clothed in the traditional polytheistic language of Greek and Roman religion.86 But neither is there any good reason to assume that Justin's critique of Stoic cosmo-theology was a direct response to Musonius. The lectures that we have by Musonius give little 82 Musonius 17.108.8-22. 83 Musonius 16.104.31-7.

Moreover, while it is possible that Justin had heard of the content of some of Musonius' lectures (e.g. on marriage; see above), his mentioning of him is probably due to the fact that, in Justin's lifetime, Musonius was so widely known for his moral teaching and moral integrity. Although he does not mention him in his writings, it is pos sible that Justin was familiar with the teachings of Epictetus (c.55-135(c.55-135 ce), who was not only a student of Musonius' but also an important figure of philosophical authority for Marcus Aurelius (121-80 ce),87 whose philosophical engagement was cer tainly known to Justin.88 Moreover, Justin's use of the concept of προαίρεσις, 'choice' (lit. 'pre-choice'),89 may have derived from his knowledge of Epictetus,90 who is the only Stoic we know of who made προαίρεση a key concept in his philosophy.91 Epictetus frequently discusses God and theology in his lectures. So much so that, apart from the name of Epictetus' ideal philosopher, Socrates, no proper name occurs more often in his texts than that of Zeus. Taken together with the designation 'God' (or 'gods') it surpasses even Socrates by far.92 Hence Anthony Long's description of Epictetus as 'a theologically centred 87 In Med. 1.7 Marcus Aurelius thanks his mentor Rusticus for having introduced the 'Notes' (τοις ύπομνήμασιν) of Epictetus to him, and in 7.19 he groups Epictetus with such prominent figures as Socrates and Chrysippus. 88 ι Apol. ι. ι; 2 Apol. 2.16. 89 ι Apol. 43.3-4, 8; 61.10; 67.6; 2 Apol. 7.3; Dial. 88.5. 90 See the discussion in Susanne Bobzien, Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy Philosophy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998), pp. 344-5.

THORSTEINSSON philosopher' is apt.93 What is striking about Epictetus' talk of God and the relationship between God and human beings is his personal language and theistic conceptions. Thus, Epictetus fre quently describes God as one who speaks directly to people,94 whether for the purpose of reproaching, advising, or encouraging them, and one who calls them to serve specific tasks.95 According to Epictetus, God is a god who dwells 'within' people, by which he is not (only) referring to the standard Stoic understanding of the physical nature and 'location' of God, but rather to the close and comforting presence of a divine figure that gives, or should give, people a sense of security and peace of mind: 'when you close your doors and make darkness within, remember never to say that you are alone, for you are not alone; nay, God is within (ό θίός evSov εστί), and your own genius (δαίμων) is within.'96 Epictetus' God is in fact continually observing the ways of human beings,97 not only their conduct but their purposes and thoughts as well, seeing and hearing everything.98 God is their guardian and guide,99 whose help is absolutely necessary if people are to prevail in their struggle against their passions and vices: 'These things you cannot cast out in any other way than by looking to God alone, being specially devoted to him only, and consecrated to his commands.'100 God is indeed help ful, Epictetus explains, if called upon: 'Remember God; call upon him to help you and stand by your side, just as voyagers, in a storm, call upon the Dioscuri.'101 For Epictetus, God is good through and through, not only watching over but also caring for individual human beings,102 though without attempt 93 Long, Epictetus, p. 193. 94 Diss. 1.1.10-13; 1-29-46-7; 1-3°-2_5; 2.8.23; 3.10.8; 3.24.98, 112; 4.4.30.

There are cer tainly some examples among earlier Stoics of theistic expressions and personal theological language, Cleanthes' Hymn to Zeus being the best-known example, but Epictetus applies such lan guage more richly than any Stoic we know of. This needs to be taken into account as a certain potential modification of or de velopment within Stoicism in the period under discussion. No less important for the present discussion is the fact that the physical aspect, so central to Justin's critique of Stoic cosmo-theology, is largely absent in the texts of Epictetus. In one of his lectures he explicitly addresses the question of the nature of God, but his answer shows that his interest lay else where: 'What, then, is the true nature of God (ουσία #£013)? Flesh (σαρξ)?(σαρξ)?(σαρξ)? Far from it! Land (αγρός)? Far from it! Fame (φήμη)? Far from it! It is intelligence, knowledge, right reason (νούς, Επιστήμη, λόγος λόγος ορθός).'106 He was evidently familiar with the Stoic theory of the universal bonding of πνίΰμα, but he never refers to God as the fiery cosmic πνεύμα.107 In a fragment preserved by Stobaeus, Epictetus speaks of 'the Cosmos' (ό κόσμος) and personifies it as if describing God—the Cosmos has a will of its own and takes counsel for human beings, but even then the interest is ethical rather than physical.108 The same is true of Epictetus' personi fication of Nature and its identification with God.109 In short, according to the texts we have, Epictetus seems not to have sought to define the substance of God as a corporeal being.

THORSTEINSSON 554 all existing things are composed of atoms, or of indivisibles, or of fire and earth?'110 While it should probably not be taken as an indication of a major disagreement with mainstream Stoic belief, there are some interesting cases in Epictetus' texts where he appears to be using a somewhat Platonized vocabulary in his theology. Thus, instead of describing God in a more traditional Stoic fashion, i.e. in pantheistic or panentheistic terms (e.g. God 'within'), on several occasions he speaks of God as a being who is, as it were, located 'above' (άνωθεν), 'in heaven',111 rather than on (or in) earth. Also, discussing 'cleanliness' as one characteristic of human beings as opposed to animals, Epictetus explains that the former receive this special characteristic from the gods who are by nature 'pure and undefiled'. But then he adds: 'But since it is impossible for the nature of human beings to be altogether pure, seeing that it is composed of such material as it is (Ικ τοιαύτη? ϋλης), the reason which they have received from the gods endeavours to render this material clean as far as is possible.'112 Here, it seems, the Stoic teacher takes a very negative stand against the human body and the nature of human beings as bodily beings. Such an atti tude was of course quite unusual for a Stoic and more typical for the Platonist camp. Unlike both Musonius and Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius often alludes to the physics of Stoic cosmology and in a way which indicates that he was well versed in it.113 Precisely as was the case with his fellow Roman Stoics, most of what Marcus writes is devoted to the field of ethics, but it is important to him to place and account for his ethics in a cosmic context. Such an approach well fits the pattern of classic Stoicism. The crucial question for Marcus is how the part is related to the whole, that is to say, how his individual nature as a human being is related to the nature of the universe.114 Marcus makes frequent 110 Epictetus, frg. 1 (= Stobaeus, Eel. 2.1.31): τι μοι /xeAci... πότ€ρον e£ ατόμων ατόμων η αμάρων η £κ πυρός καΐ γης συνέστηκ€ τα οντά] 1 1 Diss. 1.13-3; 1·ϊ4·1-3; 1·3°&gt; 2.17.29; 4·ΙΟ Ι4· 112 Diss. 4·11 •4 (Oldfather's translation slightly modified: 'human beings' instead of *men'): ivci δ' άμηχανον την ούαίαν αυτών τταντάττασιν etvai καθαράν €κ€κ τοιαύτης ϋλης κ€κραμ€νην, ό Aoyo? παραληφθ€Ϊς €1ς το evSc^o/xevov ταύτην καθάριονκαθάριον άποτελςΐν 7τ€1ράται. 113 See the overview in Robert Β.

One example is this expression of praise: 'All that is in tune with thee, Ο Universe, is in tune with me! Nothing that is in due time for thee is too early or too late for me! All that thy seasons bring, Ο Nature, is fruit for me! All things come from thee, subsist in thee, go back to thee.'116 Marcus stresses the mutual interdependence of all things in the world, and that 117 everything is in an intimate union or oneness, but in that context he prefers to use the designation Universe or World-Soul rather than God—except in the following passage: 'All things are mutually intertwined and the tie is sacred... For there is both one Universe, made up of all things, and one God immanent in all things (deos els δια πάντων), and one Substance, and one Law, one Reason common to all intelligent creatures, and one Truth.'118 Like Epictetus, Marcus speaks of the 'God 1 1 1Q · · .19Π within', or, more typically, of the 'spirit (δαίμων) within'. According to him, God is that perfect living being who is good, just, and beautiful, and who begets and sustains all things.121 The gods concern themselves with and take counsel about human affairs, including on an individual level.122 However, 115 References to God/gods are found in the following passages: Med. 1.3; 1.16.3; 1·17·1. 5&gt; 8; 2.1; 2.3; 2.4; 2.5; 2.11; 2.12; 2.13; 2.17; 3.3; 3.4.3; 3.5; 3.6.2; 3.7; 3.9; 3-11-3; 3-12; 3.13; 3.16; 4.16; 4.23; 4.31; 4.47; 5.5; 5.7; 5.8.2; 5.10.2; 5.27; 5.31; 5.33; 5.34; 6.7; 6.16.3; 6.23; 6.30.1; 6.35; 6.41; 6.42; 6.44; 7-9; 717; 7-31; 7-39; 7-41; 7-46; 7-51; 7-53; 7-54; 7-66; 7.67; 7.68; 7.70; 8.2; 8.17; 8.19; 8.23; 8.27; 8.34; 8.56; 9.1; 9.10; 9.11; 9.27; 9.28; 9.35; 9.37; 9.40; 10.1; 10.1; 10.8.2; 10.11; 11.8; 11.13; 11.19; 11.20.2; 12.2; 12.4; 12.5; 12.11; 12.12; 12.19; 12.23; 12.26; 12.27; 12.28; 12.31; 12.36. 116 Med. 4.23 (trans.

But it cannot be said that he develops or clarifies in strictly physical terms his understand ing of God as a corporeal being, beyond referring in simple terms to the 'immanent God' and identifying God somewhat vaguely with the Universe and Nature. Moreover, perhaps under the influence of such expressions in Epictetus as one of his model philosophers, Marcus Aurelius shows some Platonizing tendencies as well with respect to the human body. According to him, 'God sees the Ruling Parts (τά ήγΐμονικά) of all human beings stripped of material vessels and husks and sloughs (γυμνά των υλικών αγγείων και φλοιών και καθαρμάτων). For only with the Intellectual Part (νοερώ) of himself is he in touch (άπτεται) with those emanations only which have welled forth and been drawn off from himself into them.'126 Elsewhere he makes a contrast between the 'more divine part' (θειοτΐρου μίρους)μίρους) of the human being and the body, which he calls a 'baser' part (ατιμότερα).127 According to R. B. Rutherford, one of two things which set Marcus apart from mainstream Stoicism is precisely his negative attitude towards the material, physical world, which shows how strongly he inclined towards a 'more transcendent view of deity' as existing apart from that world, although Marcus never goes so far as to fully postulate the ex istence of such a deity.12 Whether Rutherford has overstated the case or not, there is evidently a certain tension in the cosmo-theology of Marcus Aurelius. On the one hand, he pre sents himself as a true spokesman of Stoic pan(en)theism, refer ring to God as immanent in all things, that is to say, as existing 'through everything' (δια πάντων). On the other hand, he shows some signs of a Platonizing tendency to view the material world 123 Med. 12.12. Cf. also 2.11. 124 Med. 9.11; 9.27. 125 Med. 2.3; 2.4; 6.16.3. 126 Med. 12.2 (Haines' LCL translation slightly modified: 'human beings' instead of 'men'). This seems to answer the (subsequent) question in 12.12 of 'how man is in touch (anrerai) with God and with what part of himself, and in what disposition of this portion of the man'. 127 Med. 11.19. 128 R. B. Rutherford, The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius: A Study (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989), pp. 219, 243-4. The other thing which set Marcus apart from mainstream Stoicism, according to Rutherford, is his 'recurrent reflections on change, transience, and death' (p. 219).</page><page sequence="25">JUSTIN AND STOIC COSMO-THEOLOGY 557 as something negative and bad, thus implying a necessary dis tance between that world and God.129 Hierocles (early second century Ce), too, applies similar ex pressions of a Platonizing sort, only considerably stronger in that respect. Discussing the origin of evil, Hierocles explains that God, who is filled with all the virtues and continually fur nishes good things to all who are willing to receive them, is never responsible for evil in the world (although God sometimes in flicts harmful things on some people as a form of chastise ment)—Hierocles refers to Plato as giving an argument for this.130 Rather, evil is caused by vice. However, according to the Stoic philosopher, there is a second cause of evil: After vice, however, the second cause of such things is matter (μΐτά ye μην μην την κακίαν δεύτερα των τοιούτων πρόφασις ή ΰλη). For things in the heavens and above us (τά μ(ν γαρ μετέωρα καί ΰττερ ημάς) proceed uniformly as though they were made of the purest substance (της ε'ιλικρινεστάτης ουσίας), since everything that is in them is accom plished in accord with nature's reasons, whereas terrestrial things (τά S' επίγεια), insofar as they have sediment and slime (ύττοστάθμην και και ίλύν) as the substance of their whole [selves]... (Unfortunately, the rest of the text is missing.) This kind of combination of evil with matter, as well as the clear, qualitative, dualistic differentiation between the celestial and the sublunary world, is certainly far from an orthodox Stoic doctrine of God and the Universe as corporeal beings, and much closer to Middle Platonic thought. Returning to Justin's treatment of Stoic cosmo-theology, it must be concluded that the sources discussed above do not seem to support the hypothesis that his critique of the Stoic teaching of 'principles and corporeals', including the notion of the nature of God as a corporeal and changeable being, issued directly from his engagement with contemporary Stoicism. For that, his description of and arguments against Stoic cosmo-theology are too remote from the cosmo-theological con cerns of these sources. To be sure, most of these Stoics would 129 On Marcus' Platonizing tendency, see also the revealing discussion in John M. Rist, 'Are You a Stoic? The Case of Marcus Aurelius', in B. F. Meyer and E. P.

THORSTEINSSON 558 probably have subscribed to the basics of Stoic orthodoxy, but none of them shows any real interest in discussing the physical aspects of cosmo-theology, except perhaps for Marcus Aurelius, whose main concern was nevertheless quite different. Although not incorrect in itself, Justin's strictly physical emphasis regard ing the Stoic view of God therefore corresponds rather badly with the cosmo-theological interests of these texts. Moreover, Justin's claim that the Stoic notion of the nature of God means that they must understand God as part of evil indicates two things: firstly, that Justin was unaware of (or simply disre garded) the Stoic belief that evil in the world is caused by vice, and that vice is altogether the consequence of human defi ciency;131 secondly, that he was unaware of (or simply disre garded) the somewhat negative view that some prominent contemporary Stoics were expressing towards the material world, thus establishing a certain tension, or even antithesis, be tween God and the physical world. The fact is that there are no indications whatsoever in Justin's texts of an awareness of this kind of Platonizing tendency occurring among contemporary Stoics. If Justin knew the teachings of Stoics like Epictetus and Hierocles (we know of no teachings of Marcus' with which Justin could have been familiar),13" he did not leave many signs of such knowledge in his texts. It seems reasonable to assume that had he been familiar with and taken account of the cosmo-theological teachings of these authors, his treatment of the Stoic understanding of the nature of God would have been rather different—less strictly concerned with the physical nature of God and more attentive to the theistic conceptions found in their teachings (especially in Epictetus), less concerned with the 'mixing' of the Stoic God with evil, and more attentive to the Platonizing tendency occurring among these authors. The The The Stoic World-Cycles and Cosmic Conflagration All of the main topics criticized by Justin are discussed at some length in 2 Apology 7, including the Stoic doctrine of world-cycles and cosmic conflagration. According to Justin, Christians do believe that God will eventually destroy the world, namely, through a 'fire of judgement' (to 7τΰρ το της 131 While some Stoics believed, like Justin, that evil could be caused by wicked demons (see Algra, 'Stoics on Souls and Demons', pp. 372-87), most of them saw human beings themselves as the cause of evil. 132 The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius were probably written in the 170s, and then only as private notes.</page><page sequence="27">JUSTIN AND STOIC COSMO-THEOLOGY 559 /cpiaeaij)133 by which all wicked angels, demons, and human beings will be 'dissolved' (81eVptvev), but since Christians have been so successful in their combat against the demons, the de struction has been postponed (7.1-2).134 However, Justin is also careful to point out that this does not correspond to the Stoic doctrine of έκπύρωσις, as one might have believed: 'For in the manner just described we say there will be the conflagration (την(την ίκπύρωσιν),ίκπΰρωσιν), but not as the Stoics [say], according to the doctrine of the permutation of all things into one another (κατά τον της els άλληλα άλληλα πάντων μεταβολής λόγον), which appears most degrading' (7.3). In ι Apology 20 Justin similarly says that there will indeed be a 'destruction by fire of corruptible things' (των φθαρτών άνάλωσινάνάλωσιν δια πυρός), and that this may sound like the Stoic doc trine of ίκπύρωσι,ς, but in fact it differs greatly from their doc trine in that they say that 'even God himself will be resolved into fire (els πΰρ άναλύΐσθαι), and [that] the world is to come into being again by this change (αΰ πάλιν κατά μΐταβολήν τον κόσμον γενέσθαι)', which is completely against Christian belief (20.2).135 In other words, Justin basically agrees with the Stoics that the world will eventually be destroyed by fire (he implies that the Stoics received this idea from the Judaeo-Christian tradition), but otherwise he strongly opposes the Stoic doctrine of cosmic conflagration and finds it 'most degrading' (αϊσχιστον, 2 Apol. 7.3). Why exactly does he find it so degrading? The main reason is not so much rooted in the idea itself of a world con flagration as it is rooted in theology: it is because of the doc trine's implication that God is part of destructible things. We have already discussed this aspect of Justin's criticism above. But he also finds fault with the accompanying idea of world-cycles, partly because it speaks against the theological claim that God is 'superior to changeable things' (1 Apol. 20.2), but also because, in Justin's opinion, it has some serious moral implications. In the first chapter of the Dialogue Justin implies—he does not mention the Stoics explicitly—that the doc trine of endless renewal of identical worlds can only result in moral decay, because it makes any fear of punishment and hope of reward from God meaningless: if everything in this world will be repeated exactly as it was, 'neither better nor 133 Cf. also ι Apol. 20.1-2, 4; 28.1; 57.1; 60.8. 134 In J Apol. 28.2 Justin states that the destruction of the world has been postponed because of God's 'regard for the human race; for He foreknows that some are to be saved by repentance, and perhaps some not yet born'. 135 Cf. also ι Apol. 19.5.</page><page sequence="28">RUNAR Μ. THORSTEINSSON 560 worse', there is no point in trying to avoid punishment and striving after reward (1.5). According to Justin, the same thing results from the notion of 'most philosophers' (presumably including the Stoics) that divine providence only takes care of the universe 'with its genera and species', but not on an individ ual basis (1.4). How do these descriptions of the theory of cosmic cycles and conflagration correspond to the Stoicism of the day? What was the significance of the theory for contemporary Stoics? In line with the general lack of interest in the physical part of cosmol ogy, the doctrine receives rather limited attention from the Stoics during this period. According to the sources we have, neither Musonius nor Hierocles mentioned the doctrine in their lectures and writings. Epictetus alludes to the theory on a few occa sions,136 but only once does he give it some thought, namely, when he compares the state of being alone with the situation during the phase of conflagration when nothing is left except God.137 According to Epictetus, some (unidentified) critics of the theory, possibly earlier Stoics,138 had twisted and ridiculed the idea of God being alone. Epictetus defends the idea, and thus the theory, by explaining that these critics betray a lack of under standing of the whole idea, and that people should in fact think of God in this very situation as a model for self-sufficiency, self-communion, and contemplation. Beyond these observations, there is no further discussion of the doctrine of cosmic cycles and conflagration in Epictetus. Marcus Aurelius, on the other hand, devotes greater space to the theory. His primary concern is not so much the conflagration itself, i.e. the destruction of the world by fire, which he explicitly mentions only twice.139 Rather, his main interest lies in that part of the theory that has to do with the cyclical process of the universe and the concept of change and renewing,140 especially relating to metaphysical questions about the relationship between 136 Diss. 2.1.18; 3.13.4-7, 13-15; 3·24·1°; 4·1·1°°· 137 Diss. 3·13·4-7· 138 Some earlier Stoics abandoned the doctrine of conflagration because they found it inexplicably at odds with the belief that God is always active in the world (and thus never completely alone, whether contemplating, self-communing, or resting). According to Philo, this was the case with Boethus of Sidon, Panaetius, and possibly also Diogenes of Babylon (Aet. 76-77).

By similar change both my parents and I came to exist, and so on to another infinity of regression.'142 Elsewhere he observes: 'In a moment earth will cover us all, then earth, too, will change and what ensues will change to eternity and that again to eternity. A man who thinks of the continuous waves of change and alteration, and the swift passage of all mortal things, will hold them in disdain.'143 As these examples suggest, it is primarily the physics of the theory of cosmic cycles and conflagration that receive Marcus' attention. Another example confirms this well, in which Marcus similarly discusses how the parts of the whole, including himself, must necessarily perish: 'either there is a scattering of the elem ents out of which I have been built up, or a transmutation of the solid into the earthy and of the spiritual into the aerial; so that these too are taken back into the Reason of the Universe, whether cycle by cycle it be consumed with fire or renew itself by everlasting permutations.'144 Despite his overall interest in ethics, he never refers to the theory in order to make a moral point. Interestingly, Marcus refers to Heraclitus in an allusion, if vague, to the Stoic doctrine of world-cycles and cosmic conflag ration, quoting some maxims derived from him.145 The Meditations Meditations show very clearly that Marcus considered Heraclitus to be one of his ideal sages, grouping him as he does with figures like Diogenes and Socrates.1 6 As noted above, Justin mentions Heraclitus and Socrates as examples of men who 'lived with the logos' and were 'Christians' even before the birth of Christ, the former of whom he calls a Stoic (1 Apol. 46.3; 2 Apol. 8.1). Heraclitus' influence on prominent 141 On this point, see also (in addition to the references in the previous note) Med.Med. 4.14; 4.23; 6.24. 142 Med. 5.13 (trans.

THORSTEINSSON 562 second-century Stoics like Marcus Aurelius may to some extent explain this confusion on Justin's part, that is to say, that Justin simply took it for granted that Heraclitus was a Stoic because of allusions like these among Stoics147 (although, it must be empha sized, it should have been clear to anyone who was fairly well acquainted with the history of Stoicism or of early Greek phil osophy in general that Heraclitus was not a Stoic). If concise, Justin's descriptions of the Stoic theory of cosmic cycles and conflagration indicate that he was familiar with its basic outline as a philosophical doctrine. But there is little to suggest that he was informed about its (lack of) weight and in fluence in contemporary Stoicism. Except for the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, the theory receives little attention in the Stoic sources of the day. Marcus' interest lies primarily in the physical aspect of the world-cycles and the concept of change in that respect, both aspects of which are briefly mentioned in Justin's critique, partly for the purpose of making a moral point. But unlike Marcus, Justin is mostly concerned with the conflagration itself, ή (κπύρωσις, probably because the basic idea of the world's destruction by fire was something which the Christians and the Stoics had in common, and Justin wished to explain exactly where the shared aspect ended and the disagreement began. That is to say, he wanted to tone down the common features and show that the point on which the two parties agreed actually originated within the Judaeo-Christian tradition, from where the Stoics had borrowed it.148 Justin's attempt to link the theory of cosmic cycles with the notion of divine punishment and reward so as to make a critical moral point would not have impressed the Stoics: even if every thing in the present world happens exactly as it had done in the previous world and exactly as it will in the next world, that does not mean that one should not fear divine punishment or hope for reward (in the present world). According to the Stoics, no one knows how things were in the previous world nor how they will be in the next, so that one must always strive for the best in the present life, especially morally. The only difference between 147 Incidentally, whereas Alcinous mentions not a single Stoic by name in his Handbook Handbook of Platonism, he does refer to Heraclitus (Epit. 14.2 [169.31]). Needless to say, unlike Justin, Alcinous was well informed about Heraclitus' identity as a philosopher. 148 See ι Apol. 20. Cf. 60.10: 'It is not that we [Christians] hold the same opinions as others, but that all speak in imitation of ours', and 2 Apol. 13.4: 'Whatever things were rightly said among all people are the property of us Christians.'</page><page sequence="31">JUSTIN AND STOIC CΟSMΟ-ΤΗEOLΟGY 563 Justin and the Stoics in this respect is that for the latter divine punishment and reward occurred during this life, whereas Justin was (primarily) referring to punishment and reward after death.149 It is true that the general idea of divine punishment and reward was not a prominent one in Stoicism, but we may nevertheless note some, if only weak, indications in that direction in Epictetus,150 and Hierocles is quite clear about the gods pun ishing people: Even if the gods are not responsible for evils, they nevertheless inflict some things of this kind on some people... as a form of chastisement (iv τρόπω κολάσΐως). For just as famines and droughts and also floods and earthquakes and every such thing mostly occur because of other, physical causes, but sometimes are also caused by the gods, when it is time for the faults of many people to be chastised publicly and col lectively, in the same way the gods sometimes make use of bodily and external defects against a single person too, for his chastisement, to be sure, but also for his conversion («τπιστροψψ) and a better choice (7(7rpoalpeaiv) than his other [choices].151 It should also be noted that if my reading of the Second Apology as echoing Justin's previous debate with Crescens the Stoic is correct (see above), the two disputants did indeed address the question of divine punishment, and Crescens appears to have criticized and ridiculed the Christians for their views about punishment after death (9.1).152 Justin's immediate reply in the Second Second Apology may therefore represent his response to such criticism from contemporary Stoics. However, his counter arguments, including the argument based on the theory of cosmic cycles (Dial. 1.5), show little awareness of Stoic views 149 On divine punishment and reward (mostly the former) in Justin, see 1 Apol.Apol. 8.4; 12.1; 28; 43; 44.5-9; 52.3-7; 54-2; 57-1; 2 Apol. 1.2; 2.2; 7.1-5; 8.3 4; 9-1-2; 141; Dial. 1.5; 4.6-7; 5.3-5; 117.3. 150 See Diss. 1.12.22; 2.8.14; 3.1.37; 3-7-36; 3.24.24, 40-3; 4.1.130; frg. 13. 151 Hierocles ap.

Plutarch, Stoic, rep. 1040B, according to which Chrysippus stated that 'Cephalus [in Plato's Resp. 330D-331B] was wrong in trying to make fear of the gods a deterrent from injustice and that the argument about divine chastise ments is easily discredited... being in fact no different from the Bogy and Hobgoblin with which women try to keep little children from mischief.' Plutarch believes that he has managed to prove Chrysippus inconsistent in this matter, since Chrysippus elsewhere states that the gods do chastise the wicked (1040c; 1050E). However, like Justin, Plutarch ignores the possibility (and probable fact) that, in these latter cases, Chrysippus was referring to divine punishment during this life, whereas in the former case he was ridicul ing the idea of punishment after death. Cf. also Seneca, Marc. 19.4.</page><page sequence="32">RUNAR Μ. THORSTEINSSON 564 on divine punishment during this life, like those of Epictetus and Hierocles. As for Justin's claim or assumption that the Stoics, among others, did not allow for the possibility of divine providence on an individual basis {Dial. 1.4), we have already seen enough evidence to infer that such a claim reveals no serious engagement with contemporary Stoic sources. The The The Doctrine of Fate Joining the Platonists and many others in antiquity, Justin also aims his critique at the Stoic doctrine of fate (ειμαρμένη). In 2 Apology Apology 7.3-7 he firmly rejects the idea, which he takes to be the Stoic position, that people necessarily do what they do because it is determined by fate. 53 Against this understanding he claims that 'each one acts rightly or sins according to choice (κατά τψ προαίρεση)'. Every race of rational beings, including angels, demons, and humans, has been made with free will (αύτεξούσιον), which means that in the end they will all be judged according to their deeds. No one is excused on account of not having been able to act out of free choice. Otherwise, Justin explains, people would not have made laws and philosophized according to right reason (κατά λόγον τον ορθόν) about the proper way of life, to which even the Stoics have devoted themselves. But what the Stoics did not realize, says the Christian philosopher, is that it is because of the wicked demons that people do evil things.154 Being ignorant of the origin of evil,155 the Stoics came up with the monstrous idea that everything human beings do, whether 153 Cf. also ι Apol. 43. ls4 As an example of such evil things (which is fully in line with the overall purpose of the Second Apology), Justin mentions the oppression of virtuous people (σπουδαίου?), such as Socrates and the like (presumably the Christians) (7.3). On the overall purpose of the Second Apology, see Runar M. Thorsteinsson, 'The Literary Genre and Purpose of Justin's Second Apology: A Critical Review with Insights from Ancient Epistolography', HTR 105 (2012), pp. 91-114. 155 In 2 Apol. 5.2-6 Justin explains that every evil in the world is caused by wicked demons, who are the offspring of disobedient angels and women, and who have enslaved human beings. Justin appears to be following an early Jewish tradition in which Gen. 6.1-4 was interpreted along these lines, sub stituting demons for the 'giants' in the Hebrew text. See further the discussion in Oskar Skarsaune, The Proof from Prophecy: A Study in Justin Martyr's Proof-Text Proof-Text Tradition. Text-Type, Provenance, Theological Profile (NovTSup 56; Leiden: Brill, 1987), pp. 368-9. According to Eric F. Osborn, Justin was here also inspired by Plato's world-view in the Timaeus (Justin Martyr [BHT 47; Tubingen: Mohr (Siebeck), 1973], p. 56).</page><page sequence="33">JUSTIN AND STOIC COSMO-THEOLOGY 565 good or bad things, they do because it has been determined by fate. The main problem, then, which Justin appears to see in the Stoic doctrine of fate—as he understands it—is the implication that no one is accountable for his or her actions, because no one has acted out of free will, and no one will therefore be rewarded or punished accordingly. The main issue for him is therefore primarily a question of ethics, rather than cosmo-theology. But the two aspects are not easily separated, even for Justin (they certainly never were separated by the Stoics): at the end of 2 Apology Apology 7, he combines his criticism of the Stoic notion of God, world-conflagration, and fate, by arguing against all these as pects on the basis of ethics. The argument is basically as fol lows (7.9): if everything happens by fate (i.e. according to divine plan), and God, as a corporeal and immanent being, is part of (even to the point of destruction) and responsible for everything, then God must be part of and responsible for evil as well as good, which is absurd, or else the Stoics will have to admit that there is no vice or virtue, which is no less absurd—it is 'contrary to every sound idea, reason, and sense' (παρά πάσαν σώφρονα σώφρονα evvoiav και λόγον και vow).156 To be sure, so Justin says elsewhere, Christians do believe that God foreknows everything that will happen, but that is not the same thing as believing that everything takes place by inevitable destiny (1 Apol. 44.11)·1" As As Carl Andresen has shown, Justin's arguments against the Stoic doctrine of fate are very similar to those put forth by Middle Platonists such as Plutarch and Alcinous.1 8 The Stoics did not make it easy for themselves by maintaining the doctrine of fate and, at the same time, emphasizing individual autonomy as well as accountability. The result is a rather complicated the oretical model, indeed paradoxical to many, for which the Stoics were constantly criticized and ridiculed in antiquity. Put briefly,159 the Stoic reply was that everything in the universe is more or less linked by an overall coherence, and so fate, as the 156 Cf. also the similar argument in 1 Apol. 28.3-4. 157 Cf. also ι Apol. 28.2; 45.1; Dial. 23.2. 158 Andresen, 'Justin', pp. 183-7.

THORSTEINSSON overall causal development in the universe or 'chain of causes',160 is best understood as a network of interacting causes rather than as a linear sequence. A particular network of interacting causes can only result in particular effects (which explains why the cosmic cycles are always identical). But there are two kinds of causes, the distinction between which it is necessary to consider in order to grasp how fate works with respect to human auton omy: an antecedent (external) cause and a primary (internal) cause. While the former applies to causes external to the human being and the influence of one cause on another, the latter pertains to human action: Ά man's moral character is the primary cause of his performing good or bad acts. Each act additionally requires a triggering [i.e. antecedent, external] cause, normally in the form of a sense-impression, since all acts are somehow responses to external circumstances.'161 As Dorothea Frede clarifies, '[t] hough the environment acts on us in a way that is not subject to our control, our reactions are "up to us" [i.e. ίψ ■ημίν] since they depend on our inner state.'162 In other words, the external world may give rise to certain reactions on the part of a human being, but the reaction of that human being depends on her or his character and 'inner' condition. Chrysippus' classic example of the cylinder may serve as an ana logy,16logy,16 despite its belonging to the realm of dead things: if someone gives a push to a cylinder at the top of a slope, the question if and how it rolls down depends not only on the person who set it in motion (the antecedent cause) but also, and more so, on the shape of the cylinder itself, which is the determining (primary, internal) cause of its rolling. The same push given to a cube would not set it in motion. Correspondingly, the question of how a person reacts in a certain situation (brought about by some series of antecedent causes) is determined by his or her moral character. According to Stoic theory, people never act in a way contrary to their moral character, which means that a morally good person reacts in a good manner (otherwise that person would not be morally good) and vice versa. Whether or not a particular person is a morally good person has been pre determined by fate, but that particular person can never know 160 On fate as a 'chain of causes' in the ancient sources, especially relating to antecedent causes, see Susan Sauve Meyer, 'Chain of Causes: What is Stoic Fate?' in Salles (ed.), God and Cosmos in Stoicism, pp. 71-90. 161 Long and Sedley, Hellenistic Philosophers, p. 393. 162 Frede, 'Stoic Determinism', p. 192.

There is no excuse for not doing one's best. A person who attains an understanding of the ways of the universe, and of her own role within the universe, will indeed realize that whatever has been predetermined in her case is the best possible scheme, and therefore she will 'freely choose' to act exactly as fate has predetermined. Epictetus puts this as follows: Man (άνθρωττΐ), your purpose was to make yourself competent to use conformably with nature the external impressions (φαντασίαις) that came to you, in desire not to fail in what you would attain, and in avoidance not to fall into what you would avoid, never suffering mis fortune, never ill fortune, free, unhindered, unconstrained, conforming to the governance of Zeus, obeying this, well satisfied with this, blam ing no one, charging no one, able to say with your whole heart the verses [from Cleanthes' Hymn to Zeus], beginning: 'Lead thou me on, Ο Zeus, and Destiny (Πεπρωμένη)'.164 By the time of Justin the main lines of the philosophical debate about fate and free will had long been laid down. Even the Middle Platonists who continued to argue against the Stoic theory made use of more or less standard arguments and stock expressions without adding much new to the debate.165 As for the Stoics themselves, we have no knowledge of any writings on fate by first- or second-century ce Stoics, 66 although most of them naturally make reference to it in one way or another. The same applies to the Stoics considered in the present study. Thus, in a fragment attributed to Musonius Rufus, he states that 'of such a character the nature of the universe was and is and will be, and it is not possible for things that come into existence to come into existence differently from the way they now do'.167 But otherwise, he pays no attention to the doctrine of fate. While his student, Epictetus, refers to fate on several occasions, most often with reference to the beginning of Cleanthes' Hymn to Zeus (cf. above),168 he appears to have been uninterested in the doc trine as such, as well as any philosophical controversy about it. 164 Diss. 2.23.42. 165 See Dillon, Middle Platonists, pp. 208-11.

THORSTEINSSON 568 His lectures give no reason to doubt that he shared the Stoic belief that, in the end, everything is predetermined. 'But his remarks are so vague that one cannot make out whether god's predetermination concerns general matters only, or particulars as well; and no connection is drawn to the causal interconnected ness of things.'169 As Susanne Bobzien observes, Epictetus' con cept of fate is basically that of 'personal fate', that is to say, the traditional Greek conception that from the outset the gods allot to human beings their individual destiny by laying down certain salient features of their lives.170 But the idea that everything is predetermined is largely overshadowed by the close and consist ent attention paid to the other side of the 'causal coin', namely, το ίψ ήμΐν ('that which depends on us'): God has not merely given us these faculties (δυνάμεις), to enable us to bear all that happens without being degraded or crushed thereby, but—as became a good king and in very truth a father—he has given them to us free from all restraint, compulsion, hindrance; he has put the whole matter under our control (εφ' ημίν) without reser ving even for himself any power to prevent or hinder.171 Insofar as Epictetus connects the question of free will with fate, he does so by presenting the truly autonomous person as some one who fully and willingly conforms to whatever has been pre determined by God and Fate.172 Hierocles similarly underlines human autonomy and responsi bility when he urges his readers to consider that 'a god is never the cause of any evil but that evils befall us as a result of vice alone, whereas the gods, in themselves, are responsible for good and useful things: but we do not welcome their benefactions but rather wrap ourselves in evils freely chosen (αυθαίρετοι?)'.173 But he makes no attempt to explain how the 'freely chosen' evils relate to the Stoic concept of fate; nor does he mention the con cept elsewhere in the extant sources. Marcus Aurelius refers to fate on a few occasions,174 and he sometimes discusses or alludes to the idea behind it without ex plicitly mentioning the concept itself.175 From these references it 169 Bobzien, Determinism, p. 337. 170 Ibid., p. 337.

According to Marcus, everything is destined from eternity by fate through which every part is connected to the whole as well as to other parts. He emphasizes that one must accept one's lot in life, which is something one not only accepts but gladly welcomes when one considers the big picture carefully enough: as I am a part [of the whole], I shall not be displeased with anything allotted me from the Whole. For what is advantageous to the whole can in no wise be injurious to the part. For the Whole contains nothing that is not advantageous to itself... As long then as I remem ber that I am a part of such a whole, I shall be well pleased with all that happens.176 In other words, the individual human being should never think of her own destiny as separated from (or more significant than) the overall destiny and ordering of the whole, which is established and, as it were, preserved in the 'seminal reason' (τον στπρματικον λόγον) of the universe.177 Marcus underlines that each and every individ ual must concentrate on those aspects of life that are under their control, rather than on something which is not up to them.178 However, all of these references and allusions to fate in Marcus' text are quite general in scope, and he never addresses the question of how fate relates to human autonomy. In this regard, his ethical interest appears to be outweighed by a metaphysical one. In fact, as in Epictetus and Hierocles, there is little in Marcus' text which indicates that he himself saw any theoretical tension or problem with the doctrine with respect to human autonomy, and there is no clear sign of any philosophical debate on the issue, let alone an attempt to engage in such a debate. All in all, then, judging from the Stoic sources discussed above, the doctrine of fate and the question of the relationship between fate and human autonomy were not on the list of topics specifically dealt with by the Stoics during the second century 176 Med. 10.6 (trans. Haines; LCL). Cf. esp. 5.24; 8.7; 12.23. 177 On the 'seminal reason' in Marcus' text, see Med. 4.141 4.21; 6.24. See also the general overview of Stoic cosmo-theology above. Justin applies the phrase in 2 Apol. 13.3-6; cf. 8.1; 1 Apol. 32.8; 46.2-4. But it is still hotly debated by scholars precisely what he means by the concept; see the brief but useful overview in George Boys-Stones, Post-Hellenistic Philosophy: A Study of its its Development from the Stoics to Origen (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 184, n. 10. 178 Med. 3.4.3; 4.39; 6.32; 8.56; 10.6.2; 11.13; 11.16.</page><page sequence="38">RUNAR Μ. THORSTEINSSON 570 CE, although the concept of fate turns up every now and then in their texts as part of the Stoic substratum. Probably due to its complexity and the apparent failure on the part of the Stoics to successfully clarify their position, much of the criticism aimed at the doctrine seems to have been based on misunderstanding. For these same reasons the doctrine was also an easy target for mis representation and stock mockery, as sometimes was the case with the Middle Platonists. Justin's description and criticism of the Stoic doctrine of fate seems in fact to have been governed by such tendencies. But unlike the Middle Platonists, he does not appear to have thoroughly acquainted himself with the Stoic ar gument in question before criticizing it. His arguments are too narrow and too disregardful of the Stoic understanding of human autonomy and accountability, as well as of the Stoic notion of good/virtue and evil/vice, in order for it to be likely that he did. Nor does he—any more than the Middle Platonists—appear to have been directly responding to contem porary Stoics, judging from the limited attention paid to the doctrine of fate as such in the Stoic sources, as well as their strong and lucid underlining of human autonomy and account ability. Whether he simply misunderstood the Stoic doctrine or consciously made a caricature of it (or both), it seems likely that Justin received the basic material of his criticism from his Middle Platonic schooling. Conclusion This study has provided an overview and analysis of what Justin says about Stoics and Stoic philosophy. Most importantly, we have seen exactly what it is in their cosmology and theology (cosmo-theology) that he criticizes, and why he appears to do so. At the same time, the study has also addressed the question of where Justin received his knowledge of Stoic doctrines, and in relation to that a survey of contemporary Stoic cosmo-theology was provided for the purpose of assessing Justin's relation to the Stoicism of his day. The study has shown that while Justin greatly admired the morality and moral integrity of (some of) the Stoics, he strongly rejected their doctrines on the nature of God as a corporeal being, on the world-cycles and conflagration, and on fate. In somewhat simplified terms, according to the Stoics, the nature of God is changeable, whereas God's judgement is unchangeable. According to Justin, on the other hand, the nature of God is unchangeable, whereas God's judgement is changeable (i.e. it can</page><page sequence="39">JUSTIN AND STOIC COSMO-THEOLOGY 571 be affected—everything is not predetermined). While Justin was clearly familiar with (some of) the basics of Stoic cosmo-theology, he does not appear to have had any—or at least he does not show much—thorough knowledge of Stoic philosophy: his description of it is rather one-sided and sometimes inaccurate, and his argumentation against it is not always to the point. There are some indications that Justin engaged in discussions with contemporary Stoics, but then primarily in relation to questions of ethics and social issues (possible allusions to Musonius' discourse on mar riage, to Epictetus' use of the concept of npoaipeais, and, on my reading of the Second Apology, to the debate with Crescens concerning the 'oppression' of Christians as well as ethics). His description of and arguments against Stoic cosmo-theology, on the other hand, do not seem to have derived directly from his encounter with contemporary Stoics. The survey of Stoic cosmo-theology in the second century ce suggests that, according to the sources we have, most Stoics of the period aimed their primary philosophical focus elsewhere, and that their cosmo-theological interests were other than those brought up by Justin. To be sure, some of Marcus Aurelius' remarks on the physical nature of God include aspects against which Justin might have been responding, but it is important to observe that there is no indication of any awareness on his part of the Platonizing tendencies occurring among the Stoics of the second century CE, exemplified even in Marcus. Moreover, the importance of the doctrines of world-cycles/conflagration and fate in Justin's treat ment appears to be in little proportion to the (relatively small) weight of these doctrines in contemporary Stoicism. In the light of this, and in the light of Justin's background in Middle Platonism, it seems reasonable to conclude that his description of and arguments against Stoic cosmo-theology were for the most part based on stock criticism and standard expressions which he probably picked up at the feet of his Platonic teacher.</page></plain_text>
