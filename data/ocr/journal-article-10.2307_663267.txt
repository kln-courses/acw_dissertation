<plain_text><page sequence="1">ACCULTURATION AND ADMINISTRATION IN INDONESIA By RAYMOND KENNEDY THE native peoples of the East Indies have passed through three succes- sive periods of alien domination. The first, starting some 2000 years ago, brought Hindu civilization to the islands. The second, which began about 600 years ago, spread Mohammedanism over most of the Indies. The third, start- ing 400 years ago, rapidly transformed Indonesia into a colonial possession of a European power, the Netherlands. And now, in 1942, an attempt is being made to bring the archipelago within a new dominion, that of the Japanese. In the Indies, therefore, we find three superimposed levels of acculturation, but different parts of the islands show quite varied patterns of cultural stratifi- cation. The Hindu influence spread in appreciable force only over Sumatra, Java, Bali, and certain coastal areas of Borneo and Celebes. Its effects can still be seen in miscellaneous aspects of the culture of these districts: religious concepts, artistic forms, linguistic elements, writing, and some subtle features of social organization. Mohammedanism, entering the islands about 1300 A.D., engulfed most of the Hinduized regions, substituting Islam for Brahmanism as the formal religion, extirpating the predominantly anthropomorphic Hindu art, replacing the Indian alphabet with Arabic script, and abolishing such social patterns as the caste system. Actually, the transformation was not nearly so complete as this statement might seem to imply, for underneath the formal Mohammedanism of western Indonesia, numerous Hindu-derived elements which I have mentioned still persist; and in one island, Bali, Islam has never gained entrance at all. Both Hinduism and Mohammedanism in the East Indies can be properly understood only as mere overlays on the fundamental culture of the islands: the ancient, truly Indonesian culture. They are like a double veneer, and not very thick either, laid on over the massive bulk of the ancestral culture, which had its beginnings far back in the dim prehistoric past of the Malayan peoples. Rather than changing the essential form of this culture, the later accretions have been bent and twisted to fit the form, so that the so-called Hinduism of the Balinese or the Mohammedanism of the Javanese would appear to the orthodox Brahman or Arabian Moslem as rather shocking burlesques of the pure faith. The ancient Indonesian culture, without alien veneer, can still be observed in parts of the archipelago where neither Hindu nor Mohammedan, nor yet European, influence has penetrated: namely, certain interior districts of Sumatra, the isolated islands off Sumatra's west coast, the central regions of Borneo and Celebes, and most of the islands of the eastern Indies. If the historic intrusions of Hinduism and Islam have left Indonesian culture fundamentally unchanged, the modern European phase of accultu- ration has also affected it very little. There are three main reasons for this. First, 185</page><page sequence="2">186 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 45, 1943 most of the interior regions have only recently been opened up to outside access, and many large districts still remain virtually untouched by European influence. Secondly, a strong bulwark against cultural disintegration has been the enormous native population; sheer force of numbers has helped immeasur- ably in resisting alien influences and maintaining traditional ways. Many of the tribes of the Indies have populations of millions, not thousands or hundreds as in most other colonial areas. A third reason for the low degree of European acculturation is of greatest interest to us here, for it concerns the Dutch policy of administration. The Dutch have maintained a beneficent, paternalistic atti- tude toward their subject peoples, and have sincerely tried to aid them in preserving their old ways. We can examine their motives for this procedure later, but now let us review the various aspects of Indonesian culture to see how the Dutch administration has dealt with them. In the sphere of native law, the Dutch have gone to almost unbelievable lengths in attempting to set up a legal system that will do a minimum of violence to the ancient customary laws, or adat, of the Indonesians. This is even more difficult than it sounds at first, because the adat differs in each district of the islands. Nothing daunted, the Dutch have allowed for all vari- ations, and every region has a special set of laws which preserves as many of the local customary rules as possible. Where the native law ran directly counter to European concepts, the two schemes have been adjusted to each other, and only the absolutely intolerable rules-from the European view- point-have been abolished. And so all of the strange intricacies of social organization, marriage regulation, and property disposal have been incorpo- rated into the written adat law of each of the tribal territories; and only such completely unacceptable ways as headhunting, blood vengeance, trial by ordeal, and death punishment for minor offenses have been forbidden. The work of legal research went on continuously, for as parts of the archipelago became more "westernized," the native legal concepts in many instances themselves changed, in varying ways in different regions. The literature on this subject runs to thousands of volumes, and I believe I can state unreservedly that the Dutch have been the foremost scholars of primitive law in the world. In the political sphere, the native forms of government have been kept intact wherever the interests of public welfare allowed. The village communi- ties, which are the essential political units in Indonesia, have been permitted, and even encouraged, to continue their traditional systems of chieftainship and council deliberation. Even the sultans and radjas have been drawn into the East Indian administrative scheme, by the well known plan of indirect rule. Thus, although the Dutch colonial officials have actually controlled the gov- ernment of the native states, the hereditary potentates have stayed in office, and, so to speak, the officials have ruled through them. Only rebellious or corrupt princes have been deposed.</page><page sequence="3">KENNEDY] ACCULTURATION AND ADMINISTRATION IN INDONESIA 187 In their treatment of native religion, the Dutch have displayed a tolerance probably unmatched in colonial history. Missionaries have been allowed in the Indies but their licenses have been revocable at any time their conduct seemed inappropriate. If the natives of any district objected to proselytizing, the region would be prohibited to missionaries. Certain areas, such as Atjeh in Sumatra and Bantam in Java, both fanatically Mohammedan, and Bali, the sole surviving Hinduist island, were entirely closed to missionary activity. Incidentally, Christianity has never enjoyed much success in the Indies, except in a few previously pagan regions, for the Moslem Indonesians, like most Mohammedans the world over, have been virtually impossible to convert. The extreme tolerance of the Dutch, who are among the most devoutly religious of all Europeans, may appear surprising until one remembers that Holland itself has always been a refuge from religious persecution. This absolute insistence on religious freedom has been carried over by the Dutch to their colonial possessions. In line with the policy of rigidly controlling missionary zeal, the Dutch have refrained from interfering in the private morality of the Indonesians. In many colonial areas, missionaries, abetted by prejudiced and prudish offi- cials, have plagued the natives about their supposed immorality, and have even passed laws against improper dress, polygamy, trial marriage, allegedly obscene rituals, and the like. The Dutch authorities have sternly insisted that such matters are the natives' own business, and have allowed no meddle- some puritans to impose their own repressions on the Indonesians. One other instance of Dutch policy on native culture appears in the regu- lations concerning property in land. This is extremely important, because the peoples of the Indies are nearly all small-scale agriculturists, securing their livelihood directly from the soil beneath their feet. In such a situation, when land is lost, everything is lost, for the economic base drops out from under the society. The Dutch have not allowed any alteration in the communalistic system of landholding which is so firmly grounded in the Indonesian adat. Native land may not be bought by outsiders. The great European and Amer- ican plantations, for instance, occupy land under leases that run for a maxi- mum of 75 years, subject to renewal. No one may attach native land, for debt or for any other reason. The consequence is that Indonesian native economy has remained basically healthy, for its foundation, the land, has been secured to the people in perpetuity. For contrast, we can think of the miserable policy of the United States government with respect to Indian land. Or, for a nearer contrast, we may consider the millions of landless peons of the Philippines, who live as oppressed tenants and sharecroppers on the vast estates of the Church and private landlords in Luzon and the Visayan islands. Every attempt by business interests to tamper with native land prop- erty laws in the Indies has been beaten off by the Dutch administration.</page><page sequence="4">188 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 45, 1943 The foregoing instances demonstrate the prevailing spirit of Dutch colo- nial policy in the Indies, namely, extreme tolerance of native culture combined with a striving to let all new features grow out of the old. The results of this policy have been: intact and flourishing native cultures, a just and compre- hensible legal system, a basically sound native agricultural economy-and an Indonesia so far behind the times that it is helpless unless protected by some strong, modern, outside power. In line with my criticism of this anthropologists' paradise, perhaps I had better state my opinion as to the motives that have impelled the Dutch to pursue the course they have in the Indies. On the credit side, their pa- ternalistic concern with the protection and preservation of native culture has been owing to the character and training of their colonial officials. The East Indian civil service has been staffed by men thoroughly instructed in native ethnology, languages, and law. Candidates were selected by compet- itive examination from among the graduates of high schools in the Nether- lands, and then sent to either Leiden or Utrecht University,where, supported by government scholarships, they studied these subjects intensively for five years. Then they went to the islands as cadets, or "aspirants," and got practical experience as assistants to older officials. By the time they were given posts of their own, they were experts in native affairs. This, I think, is the only case of a colonial civil service composed almost entirely of trained anthropologists. And they, like most anthropologists, were so interested in native culture, saw the native point of view so clearly, that they desired and fought for its preser- vation. To my mind, this is the one great danger in having anthropologists as administrators. They tend to cherish native cultures to such an extent that they are blind to the need for adjustive change in these cultures to suit changing world conditions. Perhaps certain aspects of the present policy of our Office of Indian Affairs offer an illustration in point. In other words, one may do more harm than good to native societies, in the long run, by insulating them from outside trends and forces, because these pressures are almost certain to push in upon the people sooner or later, and they will be caught unprepared, in all their pristine primitive serenity. On the debit side of motivation, the Dutch policy was undoubtedly fa- vored by another interest group, not anthropologically trained at all. These were the business concerns, the financial imperialists, who feared two things above all: first, nationalistic agitation for independence by Indonesians, and second, native demands for economic betterment, for higher wages, and for more expenditure on public welfare. An excellent way to circumvent any such alien and progressive ideas was to encourage "primitivism" in culture, and to main- tain the tribal heterogeneity of the native peoples so that they would not develop any tendencies toward pan-Indonesian nationalism. Thus, strange though it may seem, the sympathetic attitude of the anthropologically trained</page><page sequence="5">KENNEDY] ACCULTURATION AND ADMINISTRATION IN INDONESIA 189 civil officials toward native cultures and the self-seeking motivation of the financial interests worked in harmony with each other. An additional purpose served by the anti-acculturation policy of the Dutch was economy in administration, particularly with regard to education. The East Indian expenditure on schools never amounted to more than ten per cent of the total budget, and in the recent depression years was cut to five per cent. By contrast, the Philippine school system absorbed twenty-five per cent of the government funds every year. Moreover, and again under the guise of preserving and encouraging native culture, the education of natives was con- fined principally to technical subjects and Indonesian arts and crafts. Very few natives ever rose to the higher schools, and only a minute proportion to the university level. The Dutch were preparing the native students, not for independent, self-reliant citizenship in a dynamically changing world, but for a kind of permanent wardship under a benevolent, paternalistic colonial administration. Only a few thousand Indonesians ever acquired knowledge of what was going on in the world outside by study of such subjects as world politics and economics. If the Indies could have been kept isolated from the swift and complicated currents of international politics, the Dutch policy might well have pursued its gentle, antiquated course indefinitely. This wonderland of the anthropolo- gist and the entrepreneur might have lived on its tranquil existence in peace, with all parties satisfied. But the world is shrinking rapidly. There are no more "far corners" left. And in this narrowing world, there is a crying need for more sophistication, more consciousness of rude reality, on the part of the native population of the Indies. Otherwise, ignorant and defenseless, they will con- tinue to be what they are now, mere human booty of imperialistic war. In the last years before the present disaster, the Dutch colonial officials came suddenly to realize the faults of their sadly outmoded policy. They saw that the traditional administrative program, with its anti-acculturation orien- tation, could no longer stand up in the grand strategy of international relations. And they broke more and more drastically with the reactionary factions that opposed the extension of native education and ruthlessly suppressed all tend- encies toward the development of Indonesian nationalism. They now realize bitterly the truth of the contention that the Indies, and all other colonial regions, must be transformed into strongholds of self-reliant democracy; and that the only way to do this will be to make the native popu'lation know what freedom means: by educating them, training them to govern themselves, and giving them a fair share in the fruits of their own land and their own labor. This policy will not bring such great profits as the old one, but it will make of these peoples staunch allies on the side of democracy. After the war is over-and assuming that the United Nations are vic- torious-it is not to be expected that the Indies will be at once miraculously</page><page sequence="6">190 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 45, 1943 metamorphized into an independent, self-sufficient national state. My de- scription of their present condition makes this perfectly clear. But progress toward this goal must be speeded as rapidly as possible. In my opinion, the Dutch should be given the task of directing this program, with proper guar- antees that the liberal faction, represented by the colonial officials, shall not be impeded in their efforts by the reactionary elements. The Dutch should be entrusted with this endeavor because they know the Indies bet- ter than any other nation knows any of its colonies. They are experts in Indonesian affairs; and their administrative record has shown consider- able improvement over the last forty years. They are unusually tolerant of the native point of view, and uniquely tolerant in the troubled sphere of race prejudice. Their weak point has been overcaution in extending edu- cation and political participation to the natives. But I believe-and I have good evidence for this which time forbids me to offer here--that they have learned a bitter lesson from the present catastrophe. The liberal faction of Dutch opinion, concentrated in the East Indian colonial service, is ready to give up the idea of domination for that of partnership. Already a ten- tative plan has been prepared by the Minister of Colonies, Van Mook, for a post-war reunion of the Netherlands and the East Indies on the basis of equal partnership in a dual state, with implied provision for rapid education of the natives and representative local self-government in Indonesia. The details have yet to be worked out, but the preliminary sketch demonstrates convincingly the revolution in Dutch policy toward the Indies. The projected program, if it materializes, will mark an end to the old-style imperialism, and the beginning of a new era, that of planned and tolerant acculturation. The Dutch already have the tolerance, and now, it would appear, they are ready to add to it what they have previously lacked, progressive and realistic planning. Such a policy, with good faith and good fortune, should develop a strong, self-reliant Indonesia-no longer an antiquated, profit-making reser- vation, but an oriental bastion of democracy. YALE UNIVERSITY NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT DISCUSSION I am very lucky indeed to have the honor to discuss the paper of Professor Kennedy, who has lived for several years in my country, and has worked "in the field" of the subject of his lecture itself. His paper shows his very intimate knowledge of people there, his keen interest for the problems that we Indonesians are facing in this era of transition. In general I can agree with Professor Kennedy's clear and frank discourse. If I have something to say, it is only to clarify some points. 1. Mohammedanism-we call our faith Islam,-has not been replacing the Indian</page><page sequence="7">WIDJOJOATMODJo] ACCULTURATION AND ADMINISTRATION IN INDONESIA 191 alphabet with Arabic script. The 52 million people in Java, the Buginese, the Macas- sars, the South Sumatrans, the Bataks, who are Moslims, have still their own scripts, though Arabic is used by many of them. 2. Hinduism and Mohammedanism have been compared as "a... not very thick ... double veneer, laid on over the massive work of the ancestral culture." I get the impression that this is the same picture as made formerly by other European authors, who describe the Islam of the Indonesians as a cloth, full of holes, through which the pagan peeps out. We may compare our culture with a cocktail, the ingredients are then the old Indonesian culture, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity-a real mix- ture. The outcome of the "cocktail" depends on the quantity of each ingredient. The culture of the population of a certain region depends on what has been introduced there during the past ages and how it has been introduced. We have, for instance, such re- gions as Menado and Amboina, where the Christian culture is very intensive, and where people nowadays regard themselves as Europeans, as they call themselves "Blanda- Menado" and "Blanda-Ambon." 3. Professor Kennedy named as one of the main reasons why the modern European phase of acculturation had affected the old Indonesian culture very little the fact that most of the interior regions have only recently been opened up to outside influence. In Java, that has been opened up for more than three hundred years, this influence per- tained only to technical and scientific knowledge. The same we saw with Hinduism, which penetrated even to the very heart of Java. This is apparent from the monuments on the Dieng plateau. 4. Java was not a waste or savage country when the bringers of the new cultures came. It was already a country with a mature culture, important institutions, and a people capable of making critical judgments. They were, however, tolerant and they had a great sense for syncretism. They adopted the elements that could enrich their culture, but on the other hand they rejected those elements which they regarded as destructive for the well-being of society. And up till now this attitude is still in existence. For instance, the Indonesian regards the technical and scientific skills of the western people as useful and readily adopts them; he is reluctant to adopt the European way of life. The men are willing to wear European clothing, but the women resent wearing European frocks. The social structure is healthy and strong. For the adoption of foreign culture-elements, there must be a certain disposition, a preparedness of the soil. 5. The Dutch policy is not an anti-acculturation one. The history of the Dutch in the Indies shows us that in the very beginning they were ready to have the population follow the Dutch way of life and way of thinking. In their first settlements they intro- duced a piece of Holland, like other immigrants (British, Portuguese, Spaniards) did in other parts of the world. They brought their language, their religion, their customs, their architecture, their art, etc. For many years there existed a so called association- policy. Intermarriage between the Dutch and the Indonesians occurs frequently. But they understand, as the Indonesians understand it too, that a policy of synthesis which tends to develop, that which nature has given to mankind, gives a better oppor- tunity in building up a harmonious society. This policy is followed in the education. It must say that the general education has started too late. The planned goal is not to make as white as possible creatures of us, but to give the possibility to study science in its widest scope for the greatest number of</page><page sequence="8">192 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 45, 1943 children of the country. With the people's school as basis, where the native language is used, every gifted pupil can enter the university. The aim is not to take the children from the village to supply them with knowledge of Dutch, English, French, German, Latin and Greek to enable them to study sciences, but to bring science to the village, to make it possible for the average man with his knowledge of Malay to study science. I may end my comments by expressing my full agreement with the conclusions of Professor Kennedy's paper, which will not only open the way for a self-reliant In- donesia, but also for an Indonesia which will be able to cooperate with other regions in a world, which will understand the deep meaning of the words, written in the Coat of Arms of the U.S.A.: "E pluribus unum."
