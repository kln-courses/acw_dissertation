<plain_text><page sequence="1">CLAUDINE T. KAHAN Shelley's "Hymn to Mercury": Poetic Praxis and the Creation of Value Any poem about beginnings is bound to make the case for a partic ular kind of genealogy. The Homeric "Hymn of Hermes, " which Shelley translated in the summer of 1820 as the "Hymn to Mercury," is such a poem, and the object generated and transmitted is a specific form of poetic power, not unrelated to, but distinct from, poetic genius and poetic value. The purpose of this paper is to examine the significance, in terms of Shelley's own later descriptions of poetic power, of his choice of this poem for translation, and to argue that through a turn away from the text, his translation provides the formalization of a historic moment in Greek history when techne, as work primarily pro ductive of an object, becomes praxis, work primarily defining a subject, and when the demiurge, not yet strictly artisan, is still thaumaturge as well. I will also suggest that it is the exemplary moment required by the distinctions Shelley later establishes in A Defence of Poetry between the legislative and the prophetic aspect of poetic practice, and by his discriminations about what we think of as poetic value. The issue of poetic genius will be addressed in the course of discussing the transaction described in the Greek poem, which takes place between Apollo, who exercises a socially sanctioned power, and Hermes, who exercises "po etic" power in its root sense. Different authorities, indeed, sponsor the power that the two protagonists exercise, and the Greek poem concludes with the negotiation which transforms a relation of incompatibility into All references to Shelley's texts will be to Shelley's Poetry and Prose, selected and edited by Donald Reiman and Sharon Powers, in the Norton Critical edition (New York: Norton, 1977) from hereon designated as PP.

Shelley's own conception of "Poetry" bears a significant connection to the Greek text's narrative about transgression and legitimacy but, as we shall see, his critical argument requires an additional turn in order to provide its own narrative of transgression. It is in order to explain the nature and the significance of these various transgressions that I shall take some pains to look at Shelley's translation. On July 19, 1820, Shelley added a few words to a letter Mary was addressing to Maria Gisborne: I have been translating the hymns of Homer, for want of spirit to invent?I have only finished one, the Hymn to Mercury, in ottava rima, which is infinitely comical.1 The tone is tactful and understated but we know that this "want of spirit to invent" registers the inordinate amount of pain with which the Shelley household had been afflicted. Their first two children had recently died, Clara in September 1818 and William less than a year later, in June 1819. If the birth of their third child, Percy, in November 1819, lifted some of the despondency, whatever relief it provided was probably cancelled by the circumstances surrounding the death, in June 1820, of the mys terious child Shelley referred to as his "Neapolitan charge." In an earlier letter to the Gisbornes, Shelley had darkly remarked that "the destruc tion that is consuming [me] were as an atmosphere which wrapt and infected everything connected with [me]" (Letters 11: 211). To the grief the Shelleys experienced was added a strong measure of scandal. Shel ley's servant, Paolo Foggi, was then blackmailing him with threats to reveal that the child, whom Shelley had officially registered as his and Mary's daughter, was in fact illegitimate.2 It would seem reasonable, therefore, to subscribe to Shelley's own account and, by believing the translations to be, as he himself suggests, at once anodyne and witness to his inability to "invent," to assume that they afford little, if any significant insight into his sustained argument about "Poetry."3 i.

Whatever credit is given Holmes' hypoth esis, the fact remains that the circumstances of the Shelleys' stay at Pisa that summer were profoundly disruptive. 3. See Holmes, The Pursuit 599, and Letters 11: 575, 210. The fact that Shelley chooses the ottava rima, a form used for comic poems in the Italian could indeed serve this argument that the translation was meant to provide a temporary consolation.</page><page sequence="3">SHELLEY'S "HYMN TO MERCURY" 149 Shelley's translation of the Homeric hymns represents, however, far more than the mechanical exercise with which he meant to soothe his grief. As Marilyn Butler's excellent account makes clear, by the end of the 18th century but even more markedly during the second generation of romantic poets, the mythological topos had become the means by which received religion and established social systems could be criti cized.4 While Shelley, like his friend Peacock, made use of mythograph ical material for precisely that purpose, the Homeric text in his case fulfills yet another function: it offers a generic account of a poetic praxis of the sort that Shelley puts to his own use in one of his stranger poems, "To a Skylark," and then describes at greater length in The Defence. Let us very briefly summarize the plot of the hymn.5 The Homeric text describes the curious transaction by which the infant Hermes, born of the union of Zeus with Maia, a nymph, secures for himself the passage from a Chthonian to the Olympian legitimacy his transgressive identity would appear to foreclose ("a schemer subtle beyond belief; / A shepherd of thin dreams, a cow stealing / A night-watching and door way laying thief," 12-14).6 His theft of Apollo's cattle, remarkable primarily for his inventive jamming of traces and signs, and sanctioned by a ritual sacrifice performed in subtly non-traditional ways, enables Hermes to force Apollo into a bargain in which both Hermes and Maia would be granted the same honor and status as the rest of the Olympians. The poem describes at some length Hermes' capacity for manipulating the material world as well as the perceptions and emotions of its inhabitants. The Olympian rule itself is at some risk, since Zeus is charmed, though not duped, by Hermes' wiles. In exchange for the legitimacy he manages to exact from Apollo, who makes him shepherd and patron of barter, Hermes agrees to teach Apollo his art. He offers him the lyre he has 4- Marilyn Butler, "Myth and Mythmaking in the Shelley Circle," in Shelley Revalued: Essays from the Gregynog Conference, ed. Kelvin Everest (Totowa, NJ: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1983) 1-20. 5. For the sake of consistency, I will refer to the Homeric nomenclature instead of switching from the Greek to the Latin, as Shelley does. Though Shelley's translation refers to "Mercury," I shall refer to "Hermes" in order to avoid the anachronism. 6. In her remarkably thorough analysis of the myth, Laurence Kahn notes that Hermes is originally Chthonian and not Olympian (Hermes passe [Paris: Maspero, 1978] 12): "Primitivement un chthonien et non un olympien, Hermes est celui qui permet la com munication entre le monde des hommes et celui des morts." In my argument, I use the term "Chthonian" to signify the absence, or even the dismissal, of categorization which Hermes enacts but gives up as a consequence of the successful completion of his intercourse with Apollo. By becoming an Olympian figure, Hermes accepts categorization, even if he himself becomes categorized as "uncategorizable. "</page><page sequence="4">150 CLAUDINE T. KAHAN fashioned and from which he draws the spellbinding sounds that release him from his grip. Hermes also forsakes his powers of divination, which must remain Zeus's alone. Though it adheres remarkably close to the original text, Shelley's translation of the hymn in ottava rima required that he exercise some choices. To begin with, by using this Italian form in English, Shelley subjected the language to constraints of rhyme which were anything but natural.7 One consequence was that, as he had himself remarked, it produced a comical effect, quite in keeping, indeed, with the tone of the original poem itself. But the changes did not only affect the prosody: they also affected the way in which one thought of prosody because Shelley's version, besides modifying the form, also produced a signifi cant thematic shift. While the Greek text makes the mastery of social and orderly speech an attribute of Apollo, (kala kai eu kata kosmon epistamenos agoreuein, 479; translated by H. G. Evelyn-White as "for you are skilled in good well-ordered utterance"), Shelley makes it a predicate of the lyre instead. The words addressed by Hermes to Apollo become, in his translation: (. . . and with fleet fingers make Thy liquid-voiced comrade talk with thee,?) It can talk measured music eloquently. (my emphasis, 637-39) I do not believe that I overread this alteration which, in view of Shelley's otherwise remarkably faithful translation, is sure to be quite deliberate. In this move, the word which signifies "skilled" (epistamenos), is made to qualify, counter-grammatically, hetairen, the "liquid-voiced comrade." In Shelley's text, as we see, the "comrade" versed in the art of a music akin to poetry (of "measured music" talked "eloquently") refers indeed to the lyre. It, not Apollo, is the regulator of the right kind of (social) utterance. Agoreuein, which Shelley translates as "mea sured music," and rendered as "good, well-ordered utterance" by H. G. Evelyn-White, indeed refers to public speech.8 The difference between "measured" and "unmeasured" speech in Shelley's version, therefore, becomes a function no longer of Apollo's social skills, as it is in the 7- The best known instance of ottava rima is Byron's Donju?n, "meant," as he himself indicated, "to be a little quietly facetious upon everything." Paul Fussell describes the form as the "paradigm of inflation and deflation, or of the heroic which swells and swells until it bursts into the mock heroic" (146-47). 8. As the Liddell and Scott's Greek Lexicon indicates ("to speak in the assembly, to harangue . . .").</page><page sequence="5">SHELLEY'S "HYMN TO MERCURY" 151 original poem, but of the lyre's intrinsic power. It also suggests that poetry, as "measured music," is one of these skills.9 Curiously then, it is by shifting the mastery of social and orderly speech away from Apollo, making it instead a property of the lyre fashioned by Hermes, that Shelley's text best emphasizes the peculiar relevance of this poem about traditional legitimacy to his own critical argument about poetic legiti macy. My point, indeed, is that it gives us insight into the categories of poetic practice he explicitly addresses in A Defence, and which organize much of his writing from 1820 on. The myth's complex discourse has been brilliantly analyzed, by Lau rence Kahn, and could not be addressed adequately in these few pages. I will focus, however, on what I think are the moments most significant in terms of Shelley's own purposes at the time, which are those con cerned with the lyre, its making, its playing, and the part it takes in establishing a social order. As the musical instrument which puts Apollo under its spell and facilitates the bargain by which Hermes gains his social legitimacy within the Olympian system, the lyre to be sure plays a central role. And the degree of painstaking accuracy which is brought to the description of Hermes' fashioning of the instrument indeed un derscores this fact. Yet because the lyre has traditionally been associated with Apollo, master of lyric, the emphasis might seem somewhat re dundant, if not outright irrelevant. To anticipate my own argument, I suggest that this emphasis is required in order to differentiate two dis tinct practices, represented by Hermes' fashioning and mastery of the lyre on the one hand, and by the anticipation of Apollo's public and social performance with the lyre on the other. This differentiation serves to establish a new understanding of the role of the poet /singer as law 9- I will merely note here the significance of this term in a discussion of Shelley's poems. The question of "measure" is, I believe, intimately related to the question of "style," or even of decorum, which Shelley addresses in a letter to Charles Oilier on the subject of "Julian and Maddalo" (Letters n: 196: "It is an attempt in a different style, in which I am not yet sure of myself, a sermo pedestris way of treating human nature quite opposed to the idealism ofthat drama [Prometheus]"). In "Julian and Maddalo," "measured" speech is defined as the genteel intercourse which goes on among two educated men, concerned with making themselves intelligible to one another. The "maniac"'s barely coherent speech, however, represents that "dark estate" of language, burdened with meanings which exceed its capacity to bear them. In other words, the "maniac"'s discourse, as asocial as he himself is, locked away from the world, is an instance of "unmeasured" speech, of speech generated from an exclusively personal source. I would also remark, however, that unlike the matter of "high style, " which, for Shelley, escapes the political implications of a prior centralized order, the question of what is "measured" or "unmeasured" is inevitably colored by political implications.</page><page sequence="6">152 CLAUDINE T. KAHAN giver in the Greek text, and I hope to show that it also helps Shelley articulate his own conception of the poet as "unacknowledged legisla tor." I will return to a more detailed analysis of the hymn's significance for Shelley's purposes at a later point in this paper. For the moment, how ever, I want to provide a general outline of the argument. Shelley, I believe, makes use of this text to specify a new conception of poetic practice, deriving from a form of poetic vocation the Homeric hymn does not itself describe but which forms the subject of "To a Skylark," also written during that summer. What the Greek text contributes to Shelley's conception of poetic vocation is the notion that "Poetry," which is the sort of effective speech practiced by Hermes (poetic speech, in the root sense given by to poiein) is powerful because it derives from something both greater than "natural" capacities (Hermes') and other than mere technical, or learned, skill (Apollo's). The difference between the two ways in which "Poetry" can be performed is the difference that is found on the one hand between Hermes' playing (in the double sense of the word), which is a function of his own magical skills and also furthers his own private interests, and on the other, Apollo's archetypal social performance, which is meant to bring order and harmony to the community and must be taught. This difference partly corresponds to Shelley's own discrimination between two distinct practices, neither of which is entirely independent of the other, and which he calls Reason and Imagination (PP 480). Very roughly speaking, Hermes' artfulness is an instance?albeit a very particular instance?of what Shelley calls poetry in its "restricted sense" (483), which is Imagination without sympathy. It is an instru ment, like the lyre, at the service of him who plays it best. Indeed, only those who qualify ("those endowed / With art and wisdom who inter rogate"?) will benefit from playing it.10 In other words, this kind of poetic language is not primarily concerned with social value but with a io. The fact that in one of his late lyrics, Shelley returns to the very same topos is of course of some significance. In "With a Guitar, to Jane," Ariel becomes the spirit which inhabits the instrument: The artist wrought this loved Guitar, And taught it justly to reply, To all who question skilfully . . . It talks according to the wit Of its companions . . . (58-60, 82-83)</page><page sequence="7">SHELLEY'S "HYMN TO MERCURY" 153 particular form of knowledge, available only to specific persons. Unlike Hermes', Apollo's own skills, which indicate his concern with more conventional practices, and which might be called Reason, in the sense that Shelley gives this term in his Defence, also indicate his integration in a social system. But sociability alone is insufficient, for two reasons: first, it does not necessarily enforce the kind of justice to which Hermes appeals when he seeks recognition, and second, it doesn't keep Apollo safe from Hermes' spells. But while it is not enough to show concern for the maintenance of the community, knowing how to play the lyre, whether one possesses Hermes' innate genius or Apollo's discipline, by itself, does not make a poet in Shelley's sense either. The problem then is to find a model which combines a privileged relation to the power of song, by itself non-social (Hermes has it) with an abiding concern for social justice, which, I should here point out, is not the same as the kind of preoccupation with social orderliness dem onstrated by Apollo. Apollo's practice, indeed, maintains a social order, but its exclusionary character is a problem which the Greek poem itself is engaged in resolving. Consequently, the contract with which it con cludes combines the model of Hermes' magical but amoral virtuosity with that of a social practice which, by virtue of this combination, is no longer exclusionary. And because this virtuosity can be taught (as part of the contract), it is no more a function of social privilege alone than of an exclusive access to magical means. It is therefore not upon this particular issue of hierarchy, since privilege becomes horizontally dis tributable, that Shelley will distance himself from the original text but more specifically, in order to supply a transcendental term to a contract which, in the original poem, provides no internal safeguard against the inevitability of corruption. Shelley indeed sees as much danger in grounding the kind of poetic authority Hermes demonstrates in a conventional social system, how ever inclusive, as in the wilder zone in which Hermes is shown to practice his peculiar craft. The danger, as Shelley refers to it in A Defence, has to do with a tendency of language which, originally, is identical with intention and "has relation to thoughts alone" (483) to become clouded by the material with which it expresses these thoughts. The material medium, Shelley argues, continuously threatens to extinguish the truth of "Poetry" but is itself inescapable, since it provides the link between private perception and social expression (PP 485). It isn't sur prising, therefore, that a poem which deals with the material world in comic terms without dismissing it would afford support for Shelley's own empirical disposition as well as the relief that his own personal experience of it had not provided. By and large, Shelley's translation</page><page sequence="8">154 CLAUDINE T. KAHAN follows the text extremely closely and certainly goes along with the Greek poem's stress on materiality. It similarly includes the distinction the original text establishes between two notions of value: the strictly material value which obtains for Hermes and the social value, neverthe less founded upon material value, spoken for by Apollo. It is precisely for that reason that Shelley does not provide an aesthetic abbreviation of the lengthy, and to contemporary minds perhaps tedious, description of the craftmanship Hermes displays in fashioning the instrument. A faithfulness to this pre-Platonic stress on a concrete reality is indeed significant, since it corresponds to Shelley's own materialist position, with its insistence upon circumstances and the historicity of poetic pro ductions.11 Personal genius itself is a consequence of what Hazlitt has called the "spirit of the age," and which for Shelley, is the outcome of culture read as nature. Though it is not always easy to sort the one from the other, particularly at the moment when perception and expression meet in the single act of poetic creation, Shelley remains keenly aware of the composite nature of original genius. But while the lyre is a product of Hermes' privileged access to magical powers, his inventiveness con sists primarily in applying existing material toward new ends. The lyre manifests, therefore, some of the attributes of the world from which it comes: fashioned out of the shell of the tortoise Hermes encounters at the gate, it is endowed with the magical properties of the tortoise and the liminal features of the gate. It is therefore itself witness to a world which also determines its material value: both the use-value of the lyre, as instrument to be played, and its exchange-value, as Hermes barters it for other goods. Here, however, Shelley almost surreptitiously adds another dimen sion: the tortoise which merely "waddles along" in the original poem, moves "his feet in deliberate measure" in his translation (31) and this precision, however slight, prepares the ground for the later description of the lyre as ideal companion. As we have already seen, Shelley's translation, veering away from the text, transfers a predicate of the poet il. PP 134: "The mass of capabilities remain at every period materially the same; the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change . . . We owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the Christian religion. We owe Milton to the progress and development of the same spirit; the sacred Milton was, let it ever be remembered, a Republican and a bold enquirer into morals and religion. The great writers of our own age are, we have reason to suppose, the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it" ("Preface," Prometheus Unbound).</page><page sequence="9">SHELLEY'S "HYMN TO MERCURY" 155 to the lyre itself, thus making the lyre, rather than the poet, the one already skilled in "measured music." By doing this, Shelley not only alters the way in which the Homeric hymn represents the poet's relation to the instrument (it is the instrument, rather than the user, which is endowed with the normative knowledge) but, because he returns au thority to a source which is outside community, transforms the concept of authority as well as the mode of its diffusion. In this form, authority confers no social privilege whatever. At the same time, its transmission requires teaching of a new kind, which redefines the speaker's relation to his utterance. I will come back to this redefinition shortly, as well as to the conception of instrumentality it supposes. What is emphasized is the fact that the tortoise, as Hermes perceives it, is already something other than the animal which depends upon his art to turn from passive and negational object (a safeguard against magical spells, but not itself a spellbinder) to the instrument enhancing the user's powers. In Shelley's translation, the instrument does not merely enhance but enables these powers. The tortoise, who "moves his feet in deliberate measure" (there is something pleonastic about "deliberate measure," as if to insist that this measure is already the function of some deliberating agent), is proleptic of the instrument he will become. Skilled in that measure which provides the principle of an order not reducible to the natural and material one, nor reducible to Apollo's limited social version of it, the tortoise, in Shelley's translation, is of the same substance as the lyre which "can talk measured music eloquently" (638). Here then we begin to see how the speaker's relation to his utterance will get redefined: the instrument (the lyre/tortoise) without which the singer does not sing, which indeed links the singer to his song, also links the material to the constitutive principle that eloquence, as productive of meaning, represents, and this principle does not reside in the player's mind. Despite and beyond its basis in material value, the instrument, in Shel ley's version, is the ideal version of the special kind of sociability sig nified by the possibility of meaning: it is the hetairos, companion, who takes precedence over the singer, and whose essence is meant to facilitate the singer's work. This instrument therefore makes claims to an ethic of sociability which is transcendental because the language that the lyre makes possible becomes more than a material possession, and more than a currency which draws its worth from an immanent reality: it becomes the means by which a new kind of social structure, determined by something other than the mind, or even the agreement of many minds, is imagined and intended.12 12. I am here using the distinctions established by Kant in The Critique of Pure Reason</page><page sequence="10">156 CLAUDINE T. KAHAN While its destination is social, poetic speech always exceeds its social function. This is both its peculiar force and its danger. The powerful charm it exerts (we see it at work even upon Zeus, who is amused and not angered by Hermes' challenge) can seduce its practitioner into ex cesses of the kind Shelley later alludes to in The Triumph of Life. It is precisely against these excesses that Shelley's translation offers the means of distinguishing between a practice and a principle. Synecdochically represented by the lyre, this principle counterposes itself both to the unbridled exercise in possessive individualism that Hermes engages in, and to Apollo's mechanical compliance with social order and poetic "professionalism. " It is the principle which must inform practice without being confused with it. It is, as we shall see, what gives its "prophetic" nature to what would ordinarily be a merely "legislative" utterance. The lyre fulfills two different tasks: most immediately, it is the instru ment which helps Hermes carry out his scheme. Telling of the "bright gods" and the "dark earth," Hermes releases the "sweet sounds" which render Apollo his captive: "subdued ... by the might of winning music" (552), Apollo is moved to an "unutterable love" (574).13 This passage repeats an earlier one in which Hermes celebrates his own begetting. between the transcendent and the transcendental and admirably clarified by Norman Kemp Smith in his Commentary to Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" (New York: Humanities P, 1962) 72-76 in particular). The transcendent, as the absolute reality which always remains unknowable, is here rendered as that principle of meaning (the principle constitutive of sociability) of which the lyre, as the instrument skilled in measure and in "taste" (an essentially social quality), is a synecdoche. The transcendental, which Kant defines as the knowledge of the a priori, that is to say, the knowledge of the a priori conditions of knowledge, is also that which mediates between the empirical and the transcendent. Though it originates in the transcendent and makes knowledge possible, the transcendental is not itself transcendent. It is as transcendental object that I look at the lyre in the hymn. It is in the sense of the transcendental instrument, therefore, that the lyre can also be said to manifest what Shelley refers to as "the sense of an approximation to this order" [the order observed by men "in the motions of the dance, in the melody of the song, in the combinations of language, in the series of their imitations of natural objects"] which "has been called 'taste'" (PP 481). As transcendental instrument, the lyre mediates between "taste" which belongs to the empirical world and the principle of "Poetry," which is transcendent. 13. H. G. Evelyn-White translates this as a "longing not to be allayed" (Loeb Classical Library, Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns and Hom?rica [Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP; London: Heinemann, 1977] 395). The Greek reads: eros . . . am?chanos or desire without resources. It would be interesting (though constraints of space do not permit it) to spend more time on the conceptual denseness of this passage, and to speculate on the relation which might exist between utterability and resourcefulness (love "uttered" perhaps relieving the help lessness of desire am?chanos). Similarly, we could see a connection between this sort of</page><page sequence="11">SHELLEY'S "HYMN TO MERCURY" 157 He sung how Jove and May of the bright sandal Dallied in love not quite legitimate; And his own birth, still scoffing at the scandal, And naming his own name, did celebrate;14 (73-76) The poetic gesture, traditionally epidictic, is here represented as a "self " epidixis: Hermes indeed is said to be autotropesas, turned upon himself.15 While the gesture is quite striking already in the first instance of his singing, when he sings alone, it gains even greater significance in the second, when he sings in front of Apollo. The concrete consequence of setting the cosmic genealogy to the lyre's music, this time, is to produce an "aesthetic" object which generates affect in a listener. The lyre is thus used to achieve a certain effect, here a sensory response such that re sponse itself is rendered ineffectual. But the lyre also becomes the object of an exchange: bartered for a respectable social status (". . . I will lead thee to the Olympian Hall, / Honoured and mighty, with thy mother dear," 611-12), the magical instrument is given a value, measured in social terms. And as the "liquid-voiced companion" (liguphoron hetairen), it receives the paradoxically social dimension by which it also comes to represent value. It becomes, as we shall soon see, what Steven Knapp has called a "personified abstraction, " that is to say, the kind of self originating agency which distinguishes itself from other fictional agents "by the virtually total saturation of its 'personality' by the thematic idea it represents."16 Both abstract and pivotal, it becomes a mediating third element, intervening between the two contracting parties. Its circulation, resourcefulness (the resourcefulness provided by utterability) and the discursive resolution of antithetical (and possibly incompatible) terms: the apparent opposition between "dark earth" and "bright gods" already, and characteristically, subverted by the fact that in Hermes' song, both belong to the same world and to the same story. Hermes himself, of course, is already the product of such a "scandalous" intersection (the "love not quite legitimate" of "Jove and May of the bright sandal"). 14. In the Loeb translation: "He sang of Zeus the son of Cronos and neat-shod Maia, the converse which they had before in the comradeship of their love, telling all the glorious tale of his own begetting" (367). 15. On the poetic gesture as epidictic, see Gregory Nagy, Pindar's Homer: The Lyric Possession of an Epic Past (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1990). The term autotropesas occurs in line 86 of the text in Loeb's edition. The commentator remarks that though it is rendered here by "making shift," it could also mean "to be like oneself," and so "be original" (369, note 2). Laurence Kahn makes a note of the two meanings in her own text (45). 16.

KAHAN since it does not properly belong to any one god, guarantees the circu lation of value and hence, exchange itself. At this point, its status is that of currency, and no longer only that of an object whose value resides within itself, within its capacity to perform specific acts and to arouse specific responses. Hermes, who through his gift of the lyre to Apollo negotiates the passage of his own status from Chthonian to Olympian, has himself crafted this lyre from the shell of a tortoise (see note 6). He identifies himself, therefore, as demiourgos from the start. The demiourgos is the craftsman whose skill produces an object for use.17 But this object here is quite peculiar, for one because it is an object for use which is also an object of exchange. Moreover, it is an object which itself, as we shall see, enacts exchange. Meeting the tortoise at the gate, and greeting it with the glee which characterizes all his transactions (Chaire . . . hetaire), Hermes already exhibits all the features of his chiastic brand of ironic inventiveness: "... Welcome, you Excellent plaything! Where, sweet mountain-beast, Got you that speckled shell? Thus much I know, You must come home with me and be my guest; You will give joy to me, and I will do All that is in my power to honour you. Better to be at home than out of door, So come with me; and though it has been said That you alive defend from magic power, I know you will sing sweetly when you are dead." (33-44, Shelley's translation)18 First, we should note that Hermes' affinity for thresholds and cross roads is already manifest here, and that the tortoise is found at such a point of intersection (inside/outside). Then we realize that the narrative of Hermes' discourse is itself very precisely balanced upon a set of 17- Jean-Pierre Vernant, Mythe et pens?e chez les Grecs (Paris: Petite Collection Maspero, 1982) 11: 17. 18. H. G. Evelyn-White 30-38: "Hail, comrade of the feast, lovely in shape, sounding at the dance! With joy I meet you! Where got you that rich gaud for covering, that spangled shell?a tortoise living in the mountains? But I will take and carry you within: you shall help me and I will do you no disgrace, though first of all you must profit me. It is better to be at home: harm may come out of doors. Living, you shall be a spell against mischievous witchcraft; but if you die, then you shall make sweetest song." I wish to thank Lenny Muellner and Kevin McGrath for pointing out the significance of this passage to me.</page><page sequence="13">SHELLEY'S "HYMN TO MERCURY" 159 oppositions subtly shifting to exchanges: the "mountain-beast" that lives "out of doors" "must come home," "indoors," i.e. into the household, to give joy and receive honor. It becomes a "companion" once it comes home and is killed. Alive, it makes one invulnerable to magic spells; once dead, it will contribute to those spells. It is not only in his discourse, however, but in the very nature of his being that Hermes makes bound aries frangible: "the multiform son of Maia" (polutropos Maiados uios, 439), he is the infant who knocks down two oxen and defeats "grown" gods, who threatens the old peasant who has witnessed his theft: Attend, I pray, to this advice of mine, As you would 'scape what might appal a bolder: Seeing, see not?and hearing, hear not?and? If you have understanding?understand. (stanza xv: 117-20) Here we see how the nature of his agency displays itself in the herme neutic scrambling that his discourse operates. If understanding means not seeing when one sees, not hearing when one hears, then understand ing itself becomes a very curious object, which interferes with a direct account. In short, "understanding," in Hermes' sense, creates havoc with interpretation, though not necessarily with meaning. But more characteristically still, Hermes' "hermetic" injunction denies the peasant any witness status: man, this man in particular, cannot account for Hermes' praxis without severely modifying his own notion about the nature of interpretation.19 We could say, therefore, that Hermes' praxis requires a new hermeneutic: it is not that understanding is impossible, only that, by no longer resting upon a logic of contradiction, it must now follow very different descriptions of truth. In the first of his characteristic rotations, Hermes not only deprives the tortoise of its magical power to guard against magical power but by domesticating the "mountain-beast," he also appropriates its attributes for his own use. Characteristically, because nothing is truly destroyed, but is merely exchanged or reversed, one might say that the economy in which he operates is quite conservative. It is often a matter of enlarg ing experience by putting everything into new and unexpected relations (vide the apparently incongruous "Seeing, see not?and hearing, hear not"). It could even be described as an economy of abundance since the contradictions he presents are frequently inclusive and "profitable." One might say, therefore, that Hermes' capacity to straddle the two sides of 19- Laurence Kahn remarks on this denial of witness status in her analysis (46).</page><page sequence="14">160 CLAUDINE T. KAHAN a question, to blur all boundaries and to reverse meanings, enacts com patibility itself and becomes?literally, and indeed oxymoronically?his trade-mark: Hermes becomes recognizable when things are no longer recognizable. Two things matter for our argument. First is the fact that his discursive inversions and semantic rotations manifest, in their oxy moronic simultaneity, the utter ease with which meaning can be un moored from its objects. On the other hand, the ubiquity of semantic displacements in the myth does not weaken, but rather insists on, the necessity of signifying practices, a fact which has frequently been denied in deconstructive arguments. What follows, in the Greek text, is a meticulous description of the gestures by which Hermes puts to his own use the tortoise's magical power to guard against spell. The "sacrifice" once again, describes an exchange in which the tortoise, which Shelley described a little earlier as "moving his feet in a deliberate measure" (30), becomes the sweetly singing instrument, the poet's hetairos it is meant to be. The Greek text, I have already noted, does not convey the prosodie allusion: as the Loeb translation indicates, the tortoise merely "waddles along." Once more, Shelley's own emphasis is significant: once more indeed it prepares the ground for a new way of thinking about the poetic instrument which, as the tortoise leaves its "natural" state in order to become "domesti cated," also becomes, in Shelley's version, abstracted yet social: a "li quid-voiced companion" who is also principle of measure since it "can talk measured music eloquently" (638; see note 10). The taking of life, which marks the passage from nature to culture, is described as precisely as if it were the performance of a ritual, and as securely as if it were itself an instance of consummate craftsmanship. Something of the thau maturgie is at play: the object that Hermes fashions is indeed magical and will literally produce a-mazement, or disorientation. Its function is now no longer to resist magical spells (which is what the tortoise, in its natural state, was known to do) but to enable them. This first sacrifice, as it were, which is repeated in the more formal, though subtly altered, sacrifice in which Hermes makes his burnt meat offerings, is meant not so much as the first cultural sacrifice as such, but as the first sacrifice in which polarities are subverted. In both cases, something of the non domestic becomes domestic. But more importantly, in both cases as well, the stability of all identities, rather than that of any particular identity, is radically affected. Here again, we have an instance of Hermes' chiastic practice: an object turns from one function to its opposite within a single sphere of oper ation, which is to say, the realm of the magical. At the same time, however, an object for use becomes an object for exchange as well, as</page><page sequence="15">SHELLEY'S "HYMN TO MERCURY" 161 the concluding bargain with Apollo makes clear. Two types of barter indeed construct this particular transaction. The first is a "natural" or simple barter in which two objects of use are exchanged: Hermes gives Apollo the "shell" of the lyre and Apollo gives Hermes the "glittering lash" of the herdsman: . . . ?Having spoke, The shell he proffered, and Apollo took. And gave him in return the glittering lash, Installing him as herdsman. (661-64) The second is what Aristotle called "chrematistic": "chrematistic be gins," as Michael McKeon explains, "when exchange persists after nat ural needs and uses have been satisfied. "20 The shell which "teaches . . . All things which make the spirit most elate" (644-45) and the lash, with which the herdsman keeps the herds together, to make them feed and breed and bring profit (655-59), both specify the kinds of cultural pro ductions which keep on being produced, which do not end when their specific use comes to an end. And indeed, in this instance of Hermes' and Apollo's very first transaction lies the generic model of all transac tions, economic and cultural. But Shelley's insistence on the "internali zation" of rule-governed limits (the tortoise "moving his feet in a delib erate measure" and the lyre which talks "measured music eloquently") even further specifies the kinds of cultural productions in which contex tual realities are transformed by being abstracted and turned into the principle of their own functioning.21 In its classical (Platonic) acceptation, techne described the labor of craftsmen who merely fashioned an object without "conceiving" it, which is to say without manifesting powers other than the mere skill it took to craft it. The techne to which Homeric texts allude, on the other hand, is almost always combined with non-human forces, almost always enhanced by the energy (dunamis) of purely natural or religious and magical powers (like the fire for Hephaistos, for instance). In these early Greek texts, therefore, the demiourgos is more than a mere craftsman 20. Michael McKeon, "The Origins of Aesthetic Value," in Telos 57 (Fall 1983): 63-82. 21. This insistence on cultural rather than natural production is what distinguishes Shel ley's theory from that of Wordsworth and Coleridge. Not for him, indeed, the image of the Aeolian harp, receiving and transmitting the natural sound of the wind. If anything, as his "Ode to the West Wind" attests, Shelley writes against these earlier romantics.</page><page sequence="16">162 CLAUDINE T. KAHAN who produces an object for use: he is either priest or magician, god or king, with special access to occult powers. Here then, the passage of the tortoise from "natural" (but not usageless) object to that of a cultural and economic object (object of the oikos, of the household), first de scribed in what might be called Hermes' sacrificial (and hermetic) speech and then in the technical account of his labor on the shell, represents precisely this kind of techne. But when techne is no longer connected to magic or religion (from the fifth century on), the status of demiourgoi, or artisans, loses the social authority it previously enjoyed. The notion of work simultaneously undergoes transformation in the economy of the community: in its earlier form, work created use-value, which is to say that it defined itself through the object it produced: the techne involved was a poiesis, the making of an object. The end ofthat techne, therefore, was beyond itself, in the perfection of the object made. In the market economy which characterized the classical period, however, work produced exchange value, no longer use-value. That is to say, techne became a way of participating in the social body as a whole as all activities became con nected to one another. Work was no longer defined by the object it produced but by this more abstract notion of a practice, or praxis, which established the basis of social relations and which also redefined the person.22 It is with respect to these various categories of bivalent concepts (object for use-value/object for exchange-value, and the related notions of techne and praxis as poieisis) that I wish to examine the implications of Shelley's interest in this Homeric poem. Hermes, indeed, is repre sented as the founder not of cultural activity or of a cultural object, but of the exchangeability which obtains when the cultural object becomes the means for a cultural activity which itself determines the values by which a society wishes to operate, in other words when these values are immanently determined. Hermes indeed, by blurring boundaries be tween social categories?between gods and men as well as between gods themselves?also creates the first object which will truly serve as object of exchange, that is to say, as object itself signifying exchange. What we are offered here is the representation of a linguistic exchange, under scored by an economic exchange, which initiates all further practices of exchangeability. Moreover, we might say that by offering us a very descriptive account of what kind of techne is both effective and legiti 22. Jean-Pierre Vernant et Pierre Vidal-Naquet, Travail et esclavage en Gr?ce ancienne (Paris: Editions Complexe, 1988) 28 ff.</page><page sequence="17">SHELLEY'S "HYMN TO MERCURY" 163 mating, the poem also offers us an understanding about the nature of all relations: relations that bind the maker to his object as well as those that bind him to his legitimating source. Much like the teacher invoked in the final stanzas of "To a Skylark, " the ode Shelley wrote at the same time as he translated the hymn, this "source" or origin is called upon to instruct the speaker. The poem offers us, therefore, an insight into the fact that Shelley provides for cultural transmission the model of a ped agogical relation which does not end when a specific meaning comes to an end, nor when the human teacher disappears. Something like a "chrematistic" model indeed, this kind of relation keeps on teaching. The hymn also specifies the nature of Apollo's relationship to lan guage. While Hermes' language, autotropopesas, is to some extent self referential, "like oneself" or "original" as Evelyn-White notes in his commentaries, Apollo's is constrained by the social requirements for meaning and order that he is said to articulate (Loeb 369 n. 2). Both conceptions, however, become predicates of Shelley's definition of "Po etry. " And because the learning of his craft will help the poet produce his own social identity, we might say that techne, as Shelley "translates" it, also includes properties of praxis. Indeed, while techne represents the skill required to produce an object, praxis is an action which affects the status of the subject as much as that of the object. Techne refers to something like an ars po?tica, the end of which is the production of the poem as object, while praxis refers to an activity the end of which, beyond the object itself, is to work upon the social fabric. Shelley's conception of "Poetry" therefore is an ars po?tica which is also an ars vivendum, an ethical code. Moreover, because the lyre is both a technical instrument and the regulative principle of the right sort of speech, which is to say, the currency most adequate to the kinds of exchanges required by the social group, Shelley's particular application of techne produces the double conception of an activity which creates both use-value and exchange value, as I already suggested. Hermes' gift of the lyre to Apollo, which Shelley seizes as an opportunity to turn Apollo into the student taught by an extra-ordinary instrument, indeed also becomes the occasion for an exchange: it is bartered for recognition. Apollo ordains Hermes "keeper of herds" (see the "pastoral" stanza 84) and a little later, Hermes is given his office, which is "to establish deeds of barter" (epamoibia erga, which Shelley translates in the following way: "It is thy merit / To make all mortal business ebb and flow / By roguery"). The barter of art for recognition, therefore, establishes Hermes as the patron of barter and becomes the foundational gesture which enacts the meaning of the person. In other words, the exchange itself becomes the</page><page sequence="18">164 CLAUDINE T. KAHAN gesture which historically initiates exchangeability. In the Homeric frag ment, barter supplements the pastoral activity of the herdkeeper with that of the trader, the connoisseur of transactions. And as I have ob served, it produces a sort of initiating redundance which makes this gesture of exchange the model for, as well as the historical origin of, a particular kind of work: the "ebb and flow" of "mortal business," in this case, exchanges of meaning corresponding to exchanges of value.23 Besides being the moment in which the definition of the social person is granted both from a social source (the Olympian) and from what I will call a "transcendental" source, the "barter" becomes at once the historic and the paradigmatic first case of the poet's (or maker's) soci ality. In the Greek fragment, it was Apollo who knew how to address an assembly clearly and forcefully. In Shelley's translation, Apollo is no longer the poet's patronizing authority since he himself receives his powers from Hermes. No longer the source of the poet's power, Apollo is merely the proto-poet: he is neither the power who directly partici pates in the social making of the poet nor the power who contains within himself the principle of his own integrity as power, since he acknowledges his desire to be taught by Hermes. Shelley's Apollo is merely the orthodox speaker unable to contain or compete with Hermes' craftiness. Hermes' craftiness by itself is of course dangerous, and there fore insufficient as social praxis, because its incursions upon interpreta tion are essentially self-serving. Shelley's whole work is pitched against the kind of possessive individualism (albeit a peculiar kind of individu alism) manifested by Hermes. What he does use, however, is Hermes' ability to convert currencies of meaning, and the transformational power, abstract or concrete, that Shelley then assigns to language.24 Truth, therefore, does not get defined in the opposition of true and false but in the fact that meaning is subject to exchangeability (a principle which is properly speaking "extra"-social) while this exchangeability itself must be governed by socially determined rules. One of Shelley's most significant moves is to have loosened poetic expertise from its origin in a fixed social identity (Apollo), and to have made it flow instead from an instrument which can be passed on from one god to another. We might say that Shelley's story about diverted power is itself another instance of diverted power, or rather, of the 23. See Mark Shell, Money, Language, and Thought (Berkeley: U of California P, 1982) particularly chapter 1. 24. One might say that "The Witch of Atlas" is the benevolent version of Shelley's "Mercury. "</page><page sequence="19">SHELLEY'S "HYMN TO MERCURY" 165 divertability of power. Power, in other words, becomes an exercise, and not the attribute of a specific person or system. What is required, there fore, is a pragmatic analysis of models of legitimacy, since the mobility of power attaches it to variable contexts. But the nature of the instrument which here represents this mobility also grounds power in an origin not accessible to empirical approaches. The lyre, indeed, is a magical instru ment, endowed with the power to subdue even Apollo. Besides a prag matic analysis, therefore, what will be required is an analysis which approaches the problem from the perspective of this transcendental source. By giving an object as deliberately non-anthropomorphic as the lyre not only Hermes' own magical powers but the human character of a com panion (hetairos) gifted with the capacity for well ordered language, which is to say, with the mastery of conventional, and thus very social, rhetoric, Shelley radically challenges a tradition in which the socializing principle of order and "measure" derives from what might be called an anthropomorphic system, derives, in other words, from something which, by securing the continuity between an anthropomorphic divinity and man (since the only thing that distinguishes Greek gods from mere men is immortality), also secures the continuity between truth and representation. Shelley, like Hermes, refuses the traditional polarities upon which hermeneu tics founds itself. His alteration suggests, instead, that because it can be put to anyone's service, the lyre fashioned by Hermes, which helps him acquire a social status, and which makes "measured" speech (social or poetic speech) effective, does not concern itself with meaning. This is another way of saying that its power is an exercise and not a fixed attribute. And because it does not draw its force from a specifically social origin, be it human or divine, its truth is not as such a moral principle, since mortality is a human or social matter, and a creature of fixed categories. We are reminded here of the singular significance of one of Shelley's more striking formulations, that with which he concludes his essay "On Life": "It is infinitely improbable" he writes towards the end of 1819, "that the cause of mind, that is, of existence, is similar to mind" (PP 478). The move, therefore, also conforms to Shelley's moral critique of history: it corresponds to his refusal to make history (the socially con structed narrative of human events, and therefore one instance of the exercise of power) sufficient authority for establishing normative prin ciples. In Shelley's version and in his later poems, normative power must be tested not by history but by some other law, which unlike history, would not be vulnerable to contingent facts. And if we accept</page><page sequence="20">166 CLAUDINE T. KAHAN the notion that Apollo is the sanctioned representative of orderly speech or art, we see that by subjecting his power to that of a "companion" both non-human and non-divine, a "companion" who strangely is out side any social system, whose own nature is peculiarly non-social, Shel ley produces precisely this kind of critique. He also, however, troubles the boundary which orders the classical division between the magical and the civic, between the techne of the demiourgoi, whose access to powerful sources grant them a quasi thaumaturgie prestige, and that of the artisans, demiourgoi as well, who produce objects which, though well made, can be used by anyone and confer no special privilege. It blurs the boundary between, finally, the prophetic and the legislative functions of poetic practice.25 My point is that what marks out the prophetic from the legislative roughly corresponds to the difference between the Homeric notion of techne and its later acceptation, from the fifth century onward, a differ ence for which Shelley's treatment produces a new description. What we shall see is that Shelley's own conception of poetic practice, which is to say, its techne, as craft as well as principle, articulates discriminations very similar to those which arose from the transformation of the concept in ancient Greece. But then, by enlarging upon both the Homeric and the Platonic meanings of techne, Shelley requires that we rethink the relation that opposes the "legislative" to the "prophetic," the pure "craft," or ars po?tica, to the principle from which the power of poetry derives, what Shelley also refers to as "Poetry." As Vernant and Vidal Naquet note in their extensive work on the subject, Homeric techne did not distinguish between the skill of craftsmen and the magical feats of Hephaistos and Proteus.26 I have already observed that both classes of makers were called demiourgoi, and this social category included wood and metal workers as well as soothsayers, healers, and epic poets. It is closer to this Homeric notion that Shelley situates his own position: in Prometheus Unbound, indeed, which is not the object of this essay but which, if anything, addresses the question of the legitimacy of power even more strikingly, Demogorgon represents the non-human nature of the source of truth. Interestingly, the name "Demogorgon" is itself the result of a scribal error: the name originally intended was in fact De miourgos.27 25. See here Vernant and Vidal-Naquet, particularly 37-57. 26. "In Homer, techne refers to the skill of demiourgoi, metalworkers and carpenters, and to a few feminine tasks requiring experience and dexterity, such as weaving. But it also designates the witchcraft of Hephaistos or the magical spells of Proteus. A fast distinction between technique and magical feat is not yet made" (my translation). 27. Timothy Webb, in a remarkable essay, "Negatives in 'Prometheus Unbound'"</page><page sequence="21">SHELLEY'S "HYMN TO MERCURY" 167 The prestige enjoyed by this notion of techne derives from the impli cation of a mastery by the subject, but for Shelley, this mastery also implies subjection to a principle from which the craft derives, which is to say that it implies a mastery of the subject. We see the relevance, therefore, of the Homeric poem for Shelley: while it provided the generic account of socialized (non-autogenetic) poetic praxis which served Shel ley's purposes, it also produced a non-autotelic conception of aesthetic value, that is to say, a value whose end, like its governing principle, would lie beyond the historic enclosures of personal identity, as well as of genre and taste and of the dialectic responses these models elicit.28 Such indeed is the principle of "Poetry" that Shelley defines in the Defence. But "Poetry," in the Defence, also refers to the "art" of poetry, which is to say its making, its production. "Poetry," in that sense, is the product of the alliance between two attributes of the poet's mind, which Shelley begins with discriminating carefully in the first two sen tences of the text: According to one mode of regarding those two classes of mental action, which are called reason and imagination, the former may be considered as mind contemplating the relations borne by one thought to another, however produced; and the latter, as mind acting upon those thoughts so as to colour them with its own light, and composing from them, as from elements, other thoughts, each (published in Shelley Revalued), observes that "Originally, the name of Demogorgon was derived from a scribal error in copying the word Demiourgos" (52). In a note, he quotes R. Pfeiffer in History of Classical Scholarship from 1300 to 1850: "Introduced in the scholia on Statius, Demogorgon is a 'ghost-word which owes its existence to a slip of the pen'" (61, note 36). 28. The terms "autogenetic" and "autotelic" I derive from a reading of Aristotle's use of autos, in chapter one of the Poetics, brilliantly commented upon by Gerald Else (in Aristotle's Poetics: the Argument (Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1957). Else begins his meticulous analysis of the word, which appears in the first line of the chapter affixed to the term poetikes, by noting that it "means 'in itself,' i.e. 'generically,' as opposed to the species. But we are entirely within the particular sphere of the 'poetic'; these are its species, and there is no question of its relation to the whole art of'making.' Thus autos, referring to an art which itself, under any comprehensive view, is only a species, seems to indicate how untroubled Aristotle was by 'systematic' considerations when he began to write." (3) Comparing Aristotle's use of autos to Plato's, for whom the term connotes the privi leging of genus against species, or "Idea" against "particulars," Else notes that in itself, autos "had not originally signified a metaphysical transcendence ... of the Ideas, but simply the self-identity or definition of a class against the manifold differentiations of its species: in short, just the distinction Aristotle has in mind here" (7). "Autogenetic" and "autotelic," from this perspective, are meant in Aristotle's sense, of a self-generating origin and of a generically determined end.</page><page sequence="22">168 CLAUDINE T. KAHAN containing within itself the principle of its own integrity. The one is the to poieien, or the principle of synthesis, and has for its objects those forms which are common to universal nature and existence itself; the other is the to logizein, or principle of analysis, and its action regards the relation of things, simply as relations; considering thoughts, not in their integral unity, but as the algebraical repre sentations which conduct to certain results. (PP 480) Reason and imagination or, in the terminology he has chosen for them, analysis and synthesis, Shelley here tells us, respectively corre spond to the Aristotelian to logizein and to poiein. A poet must be endowed with this twofold capacity for "mental action" in order truly to be making poems, whether he is of the legislating or the prophesizing kind. Now, I want to suggest that Shelley's claim is even bolder than it would seem, because in the "Hymn to Hermes" and in "To a Skylark" which, as Timothy Webb notes, provides a number of lexical and se mantic echoes of the translation, he produces an image of the poet who is both prophet and legislator, not one or the other, as he appears to suggest here. To poiein and to logizein both convey an idea of "making," but the former, closer to the rhetorical category of invention, implies a kinship to creation that the Homeric tradition would appear to foreclose. Before the classical period in Greece, nothing is created, properly speak ing, which does not already exist. I have already suggested that the kind of to poiein Shelley has in mind bears affinities to Hermes' poieisis rather than to Apollo's, whose suitability for a kind of public speech which is socially facilitating, something like the civil conception of Logos, marks him out for Shelley's to logizein. Hermes, the Chthonian to Apollo's Olympian, has, as we shall see in the poem, privileged access to magical powers and his utterance is accordingly marked by its transgressive ability to subdue rational argument. And of course, the Olympian comes out of the Chthonian. But Hermes' kind of poieisis, which is akin to creating, is more concretely manifested in his fashioning of a magical instrument, an instrument fashioned out of existing material, to be sure, but made new by the reversal he produces. By combining the categories of analysis and synthesis (we remember that Shelley singles out the poets from the "mere reasoners" [PP 502], and that these poets include Rousseau who has not written much verse at all), and by then arguing that the true poet is he who creates, but who, in his "creation," acknowledges that it does not properly issue from himself (rather than he who, claiming to be the fons et origo, merely sorts out and arranges what he finds), Shelley radically modifies the nature of a poetic authority based upon a logic of opposition and non contradiction, much like that which, in the Homeric fragment, initially</page><page sequence="23">SHELLEY'S "HYMN TO MERCURY" 169 presides over Hermes' transaction with Apollo. Hermes the Chthonian, whose powers of persuasion are magical and whose actions are delib erately transgressive, is opposed by Apollo the Olympian, logical and orthodox speaker, respectful of the existing order and conferrer of le gitimacy. By making the lyre the source both of socialized utterance ("measured music") and of the practice of magical powers, Shelley erases the clear opposition which obtains in the hymn. To logizein indeed, the action by which differences are perceived and logical connections established, is ancillary to to poiein and a part of it, just as grammatical forms and "those arrangements of language, and especially metrical language" are restricted forms of the poetic principle from which they proceed (PP 483). Poetic authority now inscribes itself in a new system, based upon the logic of non-contradiction, a logic of contract issuing from the bargain struck by the two gods, and addition ally specified by Shelley's own "creative" translation. It is now the system of which Shelley speaks when he describes the accommodations performed by the true poets' "vitally metaphorical" language, the ac commodations between a creative Imagination and the social constraints that all language reflects (PP 482). What could sound like an internal oxymoron (the meta of metaphoricity clashing at one level with the organic cohesiveness of the true poets' "vital" language) becomes instead the continuously negotiable state of tension which exists between ex perience and perception, and perception and expression, as Shelley very carefully describes the process. This new logical?and contractual? system, of necessity, will require a new kind of praxis and it is this praxis that "To a Skylark" will articulate for us. We might say, then, that Shelley's translation (the narrative of the hymn along with the inflection he gives it) provides the hermeneutic paradigm which governs most of his poems. It contributes to his own thinking about poetic value by being the instrument which makes pos sible an understanding of the kind of knowledge deemed necessary for the poet. In other words, it bears to Shelley's own poetic practice a relation which repeats the relation it itself represents, between the orig inal maker of the lyre and the first poet who uses it for social purposes. Like the lyre which is all at once ideal companion, producer of value and producer of meaning, Shelley's translation mediates between a prin ciple of meaning which, no more than "Poetry, " can be made directly accessible, and a world "measured" by a poet whose prophetic capacity is primarily epidictic. The "prophet" can only point to this power, aided by skills that eloquence and taste, the "legislator's" social virtues, in form. Yale University</page></plain_text>
