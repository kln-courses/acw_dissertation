<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERSPECTIVES Critical Reflections on Globalisation James Petras Chronis Polychroniou The rise of globalism is intimately related to the growih of class conflict and the squeeze of profits during the limited globalisation period associated with the 'welfare state'. The crisis of declining profits associated with rising popular power is the source of the demise of 'national development'. The success of capital in undermining popular power, dismantling the welfare state and converting the state into an instrument of overseas expansion is the underlying condition for globalisaiion, not 'technological changes', 'world market impera2tives' or the 'logic of capital. DURING the lastquarterof the 2Oth century, international economic activity has been on an upturn. International production, world trade of goods and services, foreign direct investment and the transfer of money across national borders have all become central aspects of capitalist economic life arid, in consequence, are defining the dynamic of capitalist development in the current era. For example, foreign direct investmenit (FDI), by far the most significant econoinic activity in terms of furthering the expansion of transnational capitalism, was growing four times as fast as the gross national product in OECD countries in the 1980s [Howelis and Wood 1993:4] and increased three times faster than the growth of world trade and four times the growth of world output during the same period [Sassen 1993:62-63]. This trenid has continued well into the 1990s and by 1996 FDI had grown to an annual rate of over $228 billion.' Concomitantly, multinational corporations - the primary agents responsible for FDI - have spread to all corners of the globe and are growing in t'act larger and far more rapidly than the world economy as a whole [Carnoy 1993: 45-96]. It is estimated that there are about 37,000 large multinational corporations operating around the world today (witlh over 1,70,000 affiliates), with the top 300 industrial corporations accoun- ting for 70 per cent of total FDI [Dunning 1993:15] and controlling over 25 per cent of the world's stock of productive assets X 'Survey of Multinationals', The Economist, March 27, 1994; UN 1994]. This upsurge in international economic activity, which most people referto nowadays dS 'globalisation', has beeri interpreted by most academic experts, public officials and the mass media alike to herald the dawning of a new era in world affairs. It is claimed that the revolutionary transformations in communication technologies and tralns- portation coupled with the restructuring of global finance and the- organisation of producEion across national boLundaries are contributing to the formation of a world where nations are bridged by shared interests aind values and where the national economy fuw ctions as a mere unit at and of the world m.arket.2 Accordingtotheglobalisation thesis, there is an economic system in high gear now which is fundamentally different from what we have known and there is no alter- native to the global process of integration. and recomposition. The global society drives the domestic market and commands the direc- tion of national political-economic issues. there can be no 4enying that the trans- nationalisatiori of economic ifs is o;ne of the major developments in the late 20th centuiy. However, the 'giobalisation' thesis is based largely on misconceptions and outright myths that stem from the adoption of narrow political views, an ahistorical construction of social reality, and from plain misunder- standings about the processes and the social forces that are reshapingr the world economy.3 First of all, the movement toward the intemational integration of national eco- nomies is as old as the history of capitalism itself. Globalisationbeganin late 15th century with the rise of capitalism and its overseas expansion: the conquest and exploitation of Asia, Africa and Latin America and the white colony settlements in North Africa and Australia were all instances of ;globalisation'. In other words, globalisation was from the outset associated with iinperialism (the global linkage was based on European capitalist accurnulation through the exploitation of the third world) and its impetus was always centred around imperial state institutions, specific class configurations, extracting resources from the domestic economy to finance overseas conquest and private accumulation, exploitation of the third world, inter-imperial trade, trading companies integrating and appropriating resources and exploiting cheap labour and international exchange (of unequal terms) of commodities. Essentially then 'globalisation' is hardly a new phenomenon: it is merely a new name, a subcode for capitalism, that subsumes diverse sociopolitical and economic pro- cesses. The imperial historical origins have remained embedded in a matrix in which new states and actors compete for privileged access to networks and state support. The principal agencies today, the multinational corporations, fulfil the roles played earlier by the trading companies (integrating and appropriating resources and exploiting cheap labour) while the imperial states extract domestic resources to finance overseas expan- sion and to secure the conditions for the reproduction of global capital accumulation. Second, the globalisation process is neither a linear nor a homogeneous process of ever- increasing world integration. Domestic economies, north and south, have alternated between the global and national-regional markets over the past 500 years. Indeed, there have been many cycles of upswings and downswings in the movement of the international integration of national economies. In the modern era, globalisation was intense from 1870 until 1914, followed by a prolonged period of shift to national development from the late 1 920s to the mid- 1940s, and then followed again by an in- creasing and uneven effort from the 1950s to the nmid- 1970s to a return to globalisation [Hlirst and Thompson 1996:18-501. In many essential respects, as a matter of fact, there was much more economic integration going on in the world economy in the late 19th century than there is today [Kenwood and Lougheed 1992]. As at least one author has pointed out, neither Europe nor the US is more open today than it was under the gold standard and Japan exports less of its total actual p.oduction today thart it did during the interwar years [Rodrik 1997:22]. Equally important, globalisation, today as in the past, has always been confined to selected geographical areas and involves but a fairly small portion of the world's population. As some writers have correctly observed, "globa- lisation is not really global. Transnational activities are concentrated in the industrial world and in scattered enclaves throughout the underdeveloped world. Most people are outside the system and the ranks of the window-shoppers and the jobless are growing faster than the global army of the un- employed" [Barnet and Cavanagh 1997:22]. lndeed, the patterni in the evolution of foreign direct investment has been one away from the underdeveloped world and more toward the industrial core. For example, while in 1924 capital flows directed toward the third Economic and Political Weekly September 6, 1997 2249</page><page sequence="2">world were about 75 per cent, by 1938 they had fallen to 55 per cent, and by 1960 to 40 percent [Dunning 1988:80]. By 1993, flows of foreign direct investment to the 47 least- developed countries accounted for a mere 0.7 per cent [UNRISD 1995: 154]. Over 80 per cent of all FDI is invested in industrial countries [Hauchlerand Kennedy 1993:21 1]. So much for global integration and world development. The crux of the argument is this: it is a gross conceptual error to treat globalisation as a new phenomenon, an inevitable process, or as the 'ultimate' phase of capitalism (the culmination of history). Globalisation is a 'cyclical' phenomenon (a socio-political outcome) alternating with periods of national development, a product of state policies linked to international economic institutions. Cyclical patterns of globalisation are largely a function of the particular situation of the different internal class and state forces and other general political and economic con- ditions affecting the process of capitalist accumulation. The ascendancy of globalism is largely the product of capitalist forces defeating endogenous working class, peasant and small business political forces, capturing the state, enforcing anti-welfare policies and thus depressing living standards and creating state incentives promoting export strategies (of commoditised capital) described as 'globalisation'. Thedeclineof'globalisation' is the product of the worldwide crisis of capitalism (such as during the 1930s) and the rise of national and social revolutionary movements which subordinate external exchanges to domestic social needs and internal development (here we are clearly not describing 'autarchy'). The rise of globalism is intimately related to the growth of class conflict and the squeeze of profits during the limited globalisation period associated with the 'welfare state'. The crisis of declining profits associated with rising popular power is the source of the demise of 'national development'. The success of capital in undermining popular power, dis- mantling the welfare state and converting the state into an instrument of overseas expan- sion is the underlying condition for globali- sation, not 'technological changes', 'world market imperatives' or the 'logic of capital'. Let us explain. First, the argument that globalisation is the result of the technological or information revolution (the so-called third scientific revolution) has several basic but fundamental weaknesses. The new computer- driven technologies facilitate information flows, increase the velocity of transfers and movements of capital, and provide the communication networks that ease plant relocations. But 'technology' does not deter- mine the location of investment, research or design. Technology is not an autonomous social force. The rates of profit determine how information will be utilised. The type of economic activity (whether it is financial speculation or productive investments) and location is a function of sociopolitical deci- sions and the state's capacity to execute them. Politics is in command of technology. The new technologies facilitate and provide resources for sociol-political decisions made by whichever social class and/or economic institutions is in control of the state. Techno- logy and new information systems are just as compatible with national-statist models as with neo-liberal models, as the Asian capitalists demonstrated. The argument that 'world market imperatives' constitute the dynamic force behind globalisation overlooks the viability and dynamism inherent in local and regional markets. The competing demands between classes linked to different 'markets' means that the turn to the 'world market' is not the result of 'imperatives' but, rather, the result of the superior politico-military organisation of social classes linked to 'global markets'. The imperative does not emanate from an abstract 'world market' but from the boardroom of multinational corporations and in the government ministries linked to them. Furthermore, the whole issue of the influence of the market varies with its relation to other social considerations and other competing demands. The class struggle can shape the scope and depth of 'market' driven forces - as has been true throughout history. Under the hegemony of the popular classes, the 'market' (meaning the capitalists who produce and sell commodities for profit) can be subordinated to serve social interests, at least in the short run. The very language of the ideologues of globalisation is shot through with a kind of anthropomorphism that obscures its essential nature. For example, the very notion that "the market demands" is nonsense. The 'market' does nothing of the sort. Only specific people organised in classes (like corporate executives) and economic institutions (directors of the IMF and the World Bank) demand - in the name of the market - economic policies favourable to their interests. The 'market' is a symbol or code word for capitalists and the 'world market' forcapitalists linked to multinational corporations and banks. The basic questions related to the behaviour of markets are essentially political questions that are ultimately resolved by state policy. The relative importance of producing for social classes in the domestic market or the world market, the question of how open or closed an economy will be in relation to the market (how to insert in the market), when to enter markets, and which markets, are in great part influenced by political decision-makers. There is'no single set of commands emanating from a single source as the 'globalisation' advocates would have it. The globalisation of production and exchange in the world market is a particular command emanating from a specific set of classes (exporters, financiers, etc) dictating a particular type of insertion I 'free markets'). Finally, the notion that globalisation' is the result of the 'logic of capital' is both asocial and ahistorical. This particular theorisation of globalisation obscures the multiple actors (different capitals, role of workers, etc), and multiple states that inter- vene and shape the movements' (or logic) of capital. Secondly, the 'logic of capital' approach fails to explain the periods of 'involution' of capital, the crises that cause capital to go overseas or to return to the domestic economy. Thirdly, it fails to explain the different degrees of insertion of capital in the world economy at different times. The 'logic of capital' approach is a linear conception of capital moving upward and outward without any sense of its rise and decline. Nor does it locate 'the logic' in relation to the role of politics, ideology and state policy in setting the parameters and conditions for capital accumulation. To understand the real or historical process of globalisation requires an analysis of the state and its relation to capital, both in the imperial and the third world countries. The main protagonists of globalisation are ascending imperialist countries, i e, countries whose principal economic institutions are 'world competitive' and thus have nothing to lose and everything to gain from 'free trade' and 'open markets'. Ascending imperial countries favour unrestricted globalisation. They tend to open their economies as well as demand 'openness' of others (Germany, Japan). Second groups of countries favouring unrestricted globalisation are 'clients of the ascending imperial countries who 'specialise' in exports of agro-mineral, forestry and maritime (primary) goods that provide high profits and inputs for the growth of imperial centres (Chile, for example). Declining imperial countries combine restrictive and selective globalisation, pur- suing openness where they still retain a superiorcompetitive position while imposing state import constraints in sectors where they have lost competitiveness (the US). Ascen- ding developing countries with diversified industrial bases combine globalisation as a formula for export while retaining strong state regulation that controls inflows of foreign capital and imports that may hinder weak or newly emerging economic sectors. Thus while all countries pay lip service to the globalisation discourse, there are varying interpretations of its meaning and application, according to their location in the imperial cycle (ascending, descending) and their relation to imperial centres (clients/ascending developing country). 2250 Economic and Political Weekly September 6, 1997</page><page sequence="3">In this context, the state is by far the most critical sociopolitical agent in the process of globalisation. The central role of the state in promoting globalisation is illustrated by its essential activity in reconstructing the capitalist system at the end of the second world war. The starting point for the current phase of globalisation is the reconstruction of western Europe and Japan through the Marshall Plan and the subsequent military alliances (NATO, SEATO, etc). State to state economic policies and military alliances, largely at the initiative of the US imperial state, provided the 'shell' for overseas expansion of the multinational corporations. The US and European military and CIA intervention in the third world (Indo-China, Korea, Vietnam, Congo, Santo Domingo, Indonesia, Guatemala, Chile, Brazil, and so on) were extensions of state policy securing the various regions for multinational expansion. The imperial state also brokered 'transitions' from colonies to independence, guaranteed state access and widening opportunities for multinationals (Kenya, Nigeria, Jamaica, Malaysia, etc). The imperial state also played the principal role in opening the world economy through the creation of supposedly 'international' economic institutions such as the World Bank, IMF and GATT. These institutions were controlled by appointees of the respective imperial states and their function was to displace national markets and local producers and undermine popular social legislation in order to facilitate the entry of multinationals and the primacy of domestic export elites producing for the markets of the imperial countries. In a word, the imperial state played a fundamental role in the economic recon- struction of the major corporate dominated economies, provided amilitary-political shell for its expansion, intervened to preserve and deepen its presence while it financed at the same time "international" lending agencies that were established for the sole purpose of opening new markets and creating new investment sites. Far from being anti-statist, multinational capital demands an 'activist state', but one that dismantles the welfare state in favour of globalisation. Under the impetus of export/multinational capital, the imperial state subsidises and finances global expansion while facilitating internal exploi- tation to accumulate capital for export. A similar activist role is evident in the role of the state in the third world. There is a dialectical relation between the state role in the domestic economy and in the process of globalisation. By pursuing policies of lowering wages, implementing social cuts in the budget, transferring pensions to private capital, the third world states reconcentrate income upward for overseas expansion ('globalisation' or 'capital relocation'). This process is most clearly evident in the current neoliberal phase of capitalism with the so- called 'structural adjustment policies'. Designed by the IMF and the World Bank in collaboration with third world states, structural adjustment policies increase the 'upward' flows of income and the availability of national public property for privatisation to multinationals and the wealthy domestic elites. All told, the imperial and third world states are essential elements in establishing the initial conditions for the movement of capital and elaborating incentives and policies (privatisation, free trade) that facilitate its continued expansion while shifting at the same time the burden for the periodic crises of capitalism onto the shoulders of wage and salaries earners. In no case does multinational capital create its own universe or transcend the existing state structures. However, the question remains: how do we specifically analyse and understand the current phase of globalisation? Speaking in the most general terms, the current phase of globalisation represents the 'restructuring' of the world economy through liberalisation of capital flows and the rules governing the international operations of financial institutions. Between 1945 to 1973 the world economy functioned on the principles of the Bretton Woods system which entailed the following: liberalised inter- national trade, a controlled financial order in which exchange rates were pegged to the dollar and an adequate volume of monetary reserves that was ensured via subscriptions and quotas, and US hegemony. The Bretton Woods system was abandoned in 1971 and the international monetary system was restructured around floating exchange rates in 1973 when the US lost the political and economic capacity to maintain the system due to the rise of new imperial powers that challenged its hegemonic role in the world economy. The end of the Bretton Woods system signalled the beginning of a new age of inter-imperial competition and, in conse- quence, a new round of class war against labour as the capitalist classes sought to establish unilaterally the terms of production and the conditions of work in an effort to secure wholesale shifts in the labour/capital relationship and to reorient the domestic economy toward the 'world market'. It is within this context, forexample, that virtually all governments in the advanced capitalist nations begun by the late 1970s to remove the foreign exchange and foreign trade control laws that had been in place since the late 1940s and to advance specific political and economic strategies that sought to offset the downward trend of profit rates of 'multina- tional' capital [Bailey, Harteand Sugden 1994]. The current phase of globalisation is rooted in changes in the correlation of class forces within the state, society and the workplace. The eclipse of trade unions and left-wing parties, in part the result of repression in the 1970s (Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Indonesia, Uruguay, and so on), of co-option (trade unions in the US and western Europe) and the right turn of social democratic and many communist parties, allowing for high rates of accumulation by depressing labour costs and thus encouraging 'globalisation'. Indeed, once the globalisation process took hold, there was a feedback effect: overseas investments in cheap labour undermined labour's role as a countervailing force. With trade unions and labour movements fragmented, capital was further encouraged to intensify exploitation and export of capital in a continuing spiral. At the same time, state intervention was now freely directed at controlling and defining the social activities of civil society and establishing new parameters for political and economic debate. With social actors on the scene oriented toward the 'world market', neoliberal statism became the controlling ideology: state subsidies to exporters and the public subsidies of private bank losses were accompanied by massive state directed redistribution of income upward and outward and justified on the basis of 'international competitiveness'. To be sure, the globalisation process is a highly contradictory phenomenon. As multinational corporations grow overseas, they absorb a growing proportion of local resources while the fiscal bases to sustain the state that supports the multinationals decline. The result is an increase in taxes on wage/salaried workers relative to multina- tional corporations and deeper social cuts to finance the export economy. Hence, globali- sation is accompanied by domestic decay. What is happening to most capitalist economies and countries throughout the world is comparable to the processes that took place in the mid-19th century: large- scale growth of capital accompanied by a geometric rise in unemployment, poverty, crime and overall human suffering. Today, the official number of the unemployed in countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stands at over 35 million and is growing, with some 15 million having given up searching for a job [OECD 1994: 9]. Indicative of the nature as well as the severity of the effects of globalisation, the rate of unemployment in the youth labour force among several OECD countries is 30 per cent [Ibid: I 1]. By the early 1990s, 15 out of 18 of the so-called developing countries had steadily declined in income growth, with some of the 'economic miracle' cases - Nigeria, Argentina, and Venezuela - having their gross domestic product drop by double digits [Arnold 1993: 47]. World inequality *has also reached new dimensions: by the Economic and Political Weekly September 6, 1997 2251</page><page sequence="4">early 1 990s, the ratio differential in percapita income between the richest 20 per cent of countries and the poorest 20 per cent stood at 65 to I, and at 140 to I between the richest 20 per cent of people and the poorest 20 per cent [Arnold 1993: 45]. Global capitalism has ensured that more than a billion of the world's people live in absolute poverty [Elins 1992: 8]. More than 15 million children die each year as a result of poverty [Elins 1992: 8]. At the same time, the principle of profit maximisation, which nowadays goes com- pletely unchecked under the pretext of operating in a 'global market', threatens the world with an ecological disaster. The tropical forests, already elirninated by rrmore than 40 percent, are disappearing "at a rate of 30,)00 to 37,000 sq miles every year" [El.ns 1992: 11-12] as multinational timber companies are having a field day under free trade, free market legislation. Indeed, the ecological effects of globalisa- tion are strikingly catastrophic. Under the fiscal pressures imposed by capital move- ments, the third world state in particular sells off more and more of its public resources - forests, mining regions, natural reserves, maritime resources. In this context, the greater the external integration, the greater the exploitation of domestic resources to fuel overseas expansion. External linkages between third world capitalists and the multi- nationals requires vast amounts of capital and, in a dependent capitalist setting, cheap labour and pillage of the natural resources are the only means available forthe necessary accumulation of capital. For the economic elite, the price of 'integration' into the world economy is expensive and the quickest road is via unlimited exploitation of non-renewable resources. This is the lesson of Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Guyana. Nigeria, and so many other third world nations. The growing contradiction between globalisation and decay of the domestic economy and society in the north and the contradiction between growing elite integra- tion in the world market and the pillage of domestic resources and labour in the south is creating the bases for a new kind of inter- nationalism built around common opposition to the capitalist state and globalisation. Majority movements exist today in the US and Mexico against NAFTA. In Europe, the movement toward economic and monetary union is under severe attack. And throughout Latin America peasant movements are moving to the forefront of the struggle against globalisation. However, at the same time that defensive struggles emerge in favour of the welfare state, the deepening crises of globalisation are generating reactionary solutions - channeling middle classes and working class discontent on the most oppressed groups in society (immigrant workers, women and mi norities )- and several misguided forms of political organisation and action (single-issue politics, identity politics, and so on). Let us be blunt. In order to counter effec- tively the process of globalisation, bridges of internationai labour solidarity must be urgently built and the state must be viewed as a major resource and lever for change. This view must be accompanied by an approach that minimises bureaucracy and mnaximises the redistribution ot resources within civil society. Social movements working for radical change must reject the sharp distinctions between state and civil society as they no longer exist - capitalism thrives or, exploiting the state (and the mass of working taxpayers) - as well as the ideology of 'identity politics' and multi- cultural lifestyle politics - phenomena more akin to contemporary capitalism than to its subversion. The challenge to the com- petitiveness ideology must grow from the solidarity of competent and productive forms of social organisation, not from the escapist yuppie leisure culture nor from utopian intellectual nostalgia for countercultural styles. Within this context, the national economy must be seen as the starting point for any political confrontation with the globalisation of capital. The rhetoric of globalisation ('global competition', 'global market-place'), which serves to reduce wage levels toward the lowest international levels while encouraging the import of the products of iow-wage labour, must be countered by a strategy that blocks the diversion of local profits overseas. Measures ranging from capital controls to socialisation of the means of production and participatory democracy can become centre-pieces for the recon- struction of a labour force capable of fighting on a level playing field. In a world where Lhe forces of globalised capitalism are "running the film of history backwards by 'mclting down' the sustained trend of a centuiy," [Itoh 1990: 14] such responses on the part of all pro7ressive political forces everywhere seemn to us obligatory.
