What puts our minds at rest is the simple sequence, the overwhelming variegation of life now represented in, as a mathematician would say, a unidimensional order.... In their basic re- lation to themselves most people are narrators. They do not like the lyrical, or at best ... only for moments at a time.... What they like is the orderly sequence of facts, because it has the look of a necessity, and by means of the impression that their life has a "course" they manage to feel somehow sheltered in the midst of chaos. And now Ulrich observed that he seemed to have lost this elementary narrative element to which private life still holds fast, although in public life everything has now become non-narrative, no longer following a "thread," but spreading out as an infinitely interwoven surface.

CCC 0333-5372/94/$2.50.</page><page sequence="2">480 Poetics Today 15:3 Peregrinations was originally delivered as the Wellek Library Lectures at UC, Irvine, in 1986. On that occasion, Lyotard was invited, he says, "to define my 'position' in the field of criticism and the path which led me to this position" (Peregrinations, p. 4). Lyotard does in fact comply with this request, and Peregrinations is a witty and very acces- sible introduction to his oeuvre. But this is an ironic bildungsroman. For a thinker perhaps best known for his description of postmoder- nity as "incredulity toward metanarratives," autobiographical reflec- tion presents a special challenge (Lyotard 1984b: xxiv). Lyotard finds himself in a situation recalling that of Robert Musil's protagonist in The Man Without Qualities, for whom both public and private, individual and collective life no longer lend themselves to a certain traditional understanding of narrative form. Can an intellectual career be nar- rated as a coherent, continuous development toward some conclusive or culminating state? Apparently not, for in the "decay of epic ... the twilight of tragedy, time is no longer, as Holderlin wrote, the rhyming of end with beginning" (Peregrinations, p. 2). It is a "delusion" to be- lieve that the course of an individual life is oriented by "something like a destiny or destination" (p. 3). Far from following a specific itinerary in effect laid out in advance, Lyotard's career has unfolded, rather, as a suite of contingencies, a succession of episodes, as is suggested by the title of this book. That is, his "peregrinations" can be thought of as intellectual perambulations that have proceeded according to the lay of the land rather than according to a map. Lyotard might even be said to have wandered, without a clearly defined goal in view. Indeed, as he begins to review his career, Lyotard quickly distances himself from metaphors of "position" and "road," turning instead to the contemporary sciences of complexity, whose "search for instabili- ties" was so important in The Postmodern Condition to his elaboration of the notion of "paralogy," understood as referring to paradoxical, alea- tory moves that radically transform the rules of the game being played (Lyotard 1984b: 54ff.). He thus remarks that thoughts are "clouds"- turbulent, chaotic phenomena whose unpredictably emergent forms are infinitely various, in constant flux: "The periphery of thoughts is as immeasureable as the fractal lines of Benoit Mandelbrot .... Thoughts never stop changing their location one with another .... One cloud casts its shadow on another, the shape of clouds varies with the angle from which they are approached" (Peregrinations, p. 5). The history of one's thinking, then, is not a unified development that can be contemplated in its totality, but a shape-shifting myriad whose interpretation never really ends: "Time does not allow the full syn- thesis of the moments or positions the mind crossed through in ap- proaching a cloud of thoughts .... Time is what blows a cloud away after we believed it was correctly known and compels thinking to start</page><page sequence="3">White * Lyotard's Phrases 481 again on a new inquiry" (p. 7). And if time is not a neutral, homo- geneous medium, but is discontinuously episodic, then space must be conceived as an encompassing field in which the subject of knowledge is always locally positioned: "There is no space in general, and every- thing brings its space with it; a place takes place by itself" (p. 5); a remark that recalls the distinction Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari make in A Thousand Plateaus between the "striated space" of an orga- nized grid and the "smooth space" of nomadic intensities in which every point is equally central (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 474-500). This restriction of knowledge to local circumstances, with the conse- quent implication that Lyotard's account of his career in Peregrinations is itself a product of its occasion rather than the last word, is not, for Lyotard, disabling: "What is threatening in the work of thinking (or writing) is not that it remains episodic but that it pretends to be complete" (Peregrinations, p. 6). He therefore resolves not to rely on preconceptions that define in advance the meaning of phenomena, regardless of the comforting sense of security against "the calls or touches of 'the big X"' (p. 27) that such foreknowledge provides. One must renounce "the glamour of [the ego's] culture, its wealth, health, knowledge, and memory," for the ego, that "strange, hateful formation," seeks always an invulnerable self-enclosure, the ultimately delusory safety of total knowledge (pp. 18, 31). To counter such "para- noiac" pretensions, Lyotard suggests that what ought to be valued in thinking is not explanatory comprehensiveness but "probity," under- stood as a "sensitivity to singular cases," a readiness to go "face to face with nothingness," to "become open to the 'It happens that' rather than to the 'What happens,"' to the "unmistakable, uncanny 'fact' that 'there is' something here and now" (pp. 8, 18, 19). Seconding Gertrude Stein when she writes that "a sentence has wishes as an event" (quoted in The Differend, p. 68), Lyotard argues for a post-tragic conception of beginning again and again. One begins anew with every phrase uttered: "There is a necessity for a phrase to be linked with the event as a happening.... Each time there are many different possible ways of linking phrases, so that each moment is a beginning in the middle of time" (Peregrinations, p. 8). In this episodic conception of thought's itinerary, what gets said next is never an inevitability. Instead, the speaker or writer improvises in response to the always unforeseen con- tingencies of the particular occasion. The ideal style would therefore be a paratactic one, for paratax "stresses the surprise that something begins when what is said is said. And is the conjunction that most allows the constitutive discontinuity (or oblivion) of time to threaten, while defying it through its equally constitutive continuity (or retention)" (The Differend, p. 66). Lyotard thus imagines a history of thought whose order, founded upon the simple juxtaposition of elements ("and ...</page><page sequence="4">482 Poetics Today 15:3 and ... and .. ."), facilitates inventiveness by avoiding the attribution of necessity to its course. But if Lyotard's wanderings have not been oriented toward a par- ticular destination, wandering as such nevertheless confers a specific ethos, the ethos of the "pagan." A pagus, Lyotard says in The Differend, is a border zone, a liminal space inhabited by paralogical thinkers, such as Joyce, Schonberg, or Cezanne, who resist settled residence. Unlike the "Volk," who shut themselves "up in the Heim" (p. 151), pagans live nomadically, experimentally, conducting themselves in a manner that is not determined by preestablished rules. In Just Gaming, Lyotard equates "paganism" with postmodernity as a social universe "formed by a plurality of [language] games without any one of them being able to claim that it can say all the others," a situation in which no single dis- course can legitimately claim to be able to foresee every contingency (Lyotard and Thebaud 1985: 58). In such a situation, thinking must invent, improvisationally, in response to the now. This notion of paganism can be refined with reference to a second clue provided by the title Peregrinations. Lyotard is not only pagan, but "peregrine," understood to mean foreign, alien, coming from abroad. Lyotard thus presents his lectures as a foreigner, a vagrant intellec- tual in the United States, like a Greek scholar tutoring in Rome or a Sophist on a visit to Athens. Lyotard's reflections are, in fact, strongly reminiscent of sophistic thought, and it would not be misleading to identify him as a latter-day Sophist or rhetorician who advocates the "adaptable cunning" explored by Marcel Detienne and Jean-Pierre Vernant in their Cunning Intelligence in Greek Culture and Society, which Lyotard, in a title phrase, calls "the strength of the weak": a ca- pacity for improvisation in response to diverse circumstances that is not bound to a single logic or discursive form, but trusts instead to chance, to the fortune of the moment, to what Nietzsche called the "dice throw" (Detienne and Vernant 1978; Lyotard 1978). Lyotard's promotion of the "occurrence" recalls in particular the Sophist Gorgias's insistence on the importance of kairos, the occasion of thought, as the principle that orients rhetorical invention. Indeed, The Differend, arguably Lyotard's most important statement to date, can be understood as a renewal of the sophistic (and specifically Gor- gianic) view of invention. For Gorgias, what is crucial is the occasion of utterance, the chance conjunction of circumstances confronting the one who would invent. Gorgias calls for a rhetorical practice in which the subject of knowledge would remain open to an unforeseeable "out- side," or, in other words, invention as the fortuitous falling together of a multiplicity of factors the issue or outcome of which cannot be predicted. Lyotard alludes to Gorgias in an interview when he dis- tinguishes "theory" from "philosophy" precisely with reference to the</page><page sequence="5">White * Lyotard's Phrases 483 concept of kairos: "Theory is by its principle outside of time; phi- losophy is immersed in the kairos" (Lyotard 1984a: 16). And in The Differend (p. xv) he remarks that a "philosophic" approach to the world requires that "you watch out for occurrences, that you don't already know what's happening.... It tries to keep up with the now." Begin- ning in the middle, in response to contingent circumstances, without a method or criterion that would decide in advance what next should be said, beginning again and again in an activity of sustained improvi- sation: such a philosophy is not a "position" in the conventional sense because it prescribes no systematic doctrine, no routine procedure, but relies instead on the "event" or "occurrence" to keep it always in motion. The question to be answered then becomes: If Lyotard's ar- rival at this "place" were not destined, how did he happen to get here and what did he find when he did? Any occasion shows the best way. Gertrude Stein, Tender Buttons In Lyotard: Writing the Event, Geoff Bennington organizes his discus- sion of Lyotard's works according to a logical development that does not coincide with the chronological order of their composition. Libidi- nal Economy (1974), the major work written between Discourse, Figure (1971) and The Differend (1983), is discussed first because Bennington considers it the furthest removed from the thinking of The Differ- end. In Libidinal Economy, Lyotard presents a critique of what he calls the "theatrical-representational set-up," an apparatus for producing closed, definitive versions of the world that is roughly isomorphic with Heideggerean "ontotheology" and Derridean "metaphysics of pres- ence." As an alternative, Lyotard turns to a "certain Freud [as] the place where force and energy can be seen struggling with the theatre of representation" (Lyotard, p. 15). This is the Freud of the primary process, the Id as cauldron of turbulent desire. Much like Deleuze and Guattari (1977) in Anti-Oedipus, Lyotard articulates a metaphysics of Dionysian rapture, polymorphous perversity, mobile libidinal intensi- ties. Desire, Lyotard says, is "a force which knows nothing of the rules of negation, of implication, of alternative, of temporal succession, a force which works by means of a few elementary operations, in fact by means of the single operation of displacement" (quoted in Lyotard, p. 17), precisely a paratactic or metonymic movement among merely contiguous elements. Lyotard's affirmation of multiplicitous desire, which affiliates him with a "tradition" that would include, for instance, the surrealists, can be understood as the inspiration for his later philosophy of phrases, with its emphasis on circumstantial, continually renewed invention.</page><page sequence="6">484 Poetics Today 15:3 According to Bennington, however, this initial theorization of a prac- tice of interpretive mobility quickly reaches an impasse. In Libidinal Economy, Lyotard in effect situates the primary process as the object of his desire, "an absence to be re-presented on the stage of thought of the writing of Libidinal Economy" (Lyotard, p. 26), and consequently fails to provide a genuine alternative to the theatre of representation. What Lyotard calls the "libidinal band"-his term for the unconscious- "does nonetheless rebuild the theatre ... is no doubt still too ontologi- cal, still a subject despite all protestations to the contrary" (p. 46). As a metaphysics, the discourse of libidinal mobility, far from promoting an openness to the event, in fact covers over the circumstances and thereby annuls the possibility of invention. Bennington suggests that one way around this impasse can be in- ferred from Discourse, Figure, whose argument moves from a discus- sion of deictics ("this," "here," "now") as the "depth of reference [that] pierces the flat space of the linguistic system ... to an assertion that a [Mallarmean] form of artistic practice can in some sense reveal or bear witness to this through its manifestations of 'figures' which do a certain violence to the invariant spacings of the langue" (Lyotard, p. 68). The genuine artist, Lyotard says, "is someone who struggles to deliver in the phantasy, in the matrix of figures whose place and heir he is, what is properly primary process and not repetition, 'writing"' (quoted in Lyotard, p. 97). From Lyotard's metaphysics of heteroge- neous desire thus ensues a practice of writing, a development that facilitates what Bennington describes as Lyotard's subsequent "lin- guistic turn," when he realizes that "heterogeneous desire" is itself a "theatrical-representational set-up," or, in the language of The Differ- end, a genre of discourse. As Bennington puts it, "Once the libidinal language is recognized as essentially that (a language),... then a gen- eral field of 'fa:ons de parler' is opened up, which might be described in terms of a generalized rhetoric" (p. 117). What Lyotard elaborates in The Differend, then, is no longer a meta- physics of desire, but a philosophy of phrases. Forgoing "any repose in psychic or naturalistic notions of energy" (Lyotard, p. 7), he presents a rhetoric of discursive forms in which "libidinal heterogeneity" would comprise at most one way of speaking among others. This does not mean, however, that Lyotard entirely forsakes his earlier Dionysian discourse. In Paraesthetics, David Carroll suggests that Lyotard pur- sues a twofold project: On the one hand, "there is a decidedly cold, analytical-pragmatic side to his strategy ... his search for an impos- sible minimal element, or 'zero degree' of critical discourse, that would be without presuppositions" (Paraesthetics, p. 183), an impossible mini- mal element which, in The Differend, is not libido but the phrase or sentence, the one indubitable basis for analysis "because it is immedi-</page><page sequence="7">White * Lyotard's Phrases 485 ately presupposed. (To doubt that one phrases is still to phrase, one's silence makes a phrase)" (The Differend, p. xi). On the other hand, Car- roll continues, "one finds throughout his work an insistence on the role of libidinal drives, desire, sensation, and feeling as undeniable ele- ments, not only of the aesthetic, but of the historical-political as well" (Paraesthetics, p. 183). One might say that the discourse of multiplici- tous desire originally deployed in Libidinal Economy continues to serve a heuristic purpose as a particularly compelling, indeed intoxicating, way to imagine an ideal rhetorical practice even as Lyotard develops a rhetoric oriented toward the event and meant to facilitate improvi- sational ingenuity by heightening the inventor's awareness of the di- versity of "phrase regimens" and "genres of discourse." It remains im- portant, nevertheless, to point out that recourse to the "unconscious" comprises only one rhetorical option, an option, moreover, bringing with it, in Bennington's words, "a mass of sedimentations not easily re- moved" (Lyotard, p. 102). "Libidinal mobility" should therefore not be privileged, but instead be complemented by other formulations, such as the figures of meteorological turbulence that Lyotard introduces in Peregrinations. In this connection, an important task recurrently pursued in The Differend is the delegitimation of putatively preeminent metalanguages and their retranscription precisely as discursive genres. Near the be- ginning of The Differend, Lyotard finds an important precursor text for this task in Gorgias's Treatise on Not-Being, which, he argues, by fram- ing Parmenidean ontology as a genre of discourse, opened "the way for the philosophy of argumentation and for the analysis of phrases" (The Differend, p. 46). In the ontology of Parmenides, the referent of philosophic discourse, Being, occupies, in Lyotard's terms, the position of the "addressor": Being speaks to the thinker, who, as "addressee," acts as scribe or amanuensis. To the extent that error is possible in this divine dictation, the thinker has fallen into Not-Being, the realm of deception and illusion. Gorgias's response to Parmenides, Lyotard says, was to turn Being and Not-Being "into a thesis and an antithe- sis argued by partners in a dialectic from which [revelation] is absent. [This] duality of paths is intolerable to ontology, it implies contrari- ness and authorizes a negative dialectic" (p. 15). Instead of relying on the word of a speaker whose authority transcends contingency, Gor- gias shows that the real is not simply given but, rather, is "an occasion to require that establishment procedures be effectuated in regard to it" (p. 9). Reality, in other words, must be argued for, or presented as a case. Yet even as Gorgias thus inaugurates a philosophy of phrases, the attempt is made to reinstate what might be described, following Bakh- tin, as a monological discursive situation. From Plato to Hegel (and</page><page sequence="8">486 Poetics Today 15:3 beyond), successive thinkers have sought to render the space of argu- mentation "pious." In the case of Plato, piety is achieved by positing dialogue as an exchange in which the stakes at the outset are the same for both partners: each seeks agreement or consensus. According to Lyotard, such a community of interests, as Plato well knew, must first be established through persuasion, in the dissembling to the good prac- ticed by Plato himself in the fictions that he chose to call "dialogues," a fact that returns dialogue to rhetorical agonism as one genre compet- ing against others. Like Plato, Hegel too subsumes sophistic dialectics under a discourse whose goal is oneness, or the abolition of discur- sive heterogeneity. In this case, Lyotard situates Hegelian discourse as itself just another genre by arguing, in a Godelian move, that it rests on a presupposition it cannot account for, but must take for granted. Lyotard's term for the inevitable failure of any genre of discourse to preside securely over the entire field of discursive forms is "incom- mensurability," a term, he says in Peregrinations, that names a crucial concern for him throughout his career. Thus, in Discourse, Figure, he sought to save "beauty and sentiment" from "the imperial preference granted by the Lacanian system to the concept" (Peregrinations, p. 11). Similarly, and not surprisingly, given his early involvement with the existential phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, Lyotard rejected struc- turalism, which reduced "sensuous forms to conceptual structures, as if understanding were the unique faculty qualified to approach forms" (ibid.). "Incommensurability" entails that the achievement of lasting consensus, of a truth that is valid in every context, can be accom- plished only by sleight-of-hand or the arbitrary imposition of closure. There are multiple, irreducibly specific genres, each of which com- prises a merely local fixing of the possibilities of invention. None can (or should try to) organize the entire array into a unified functioning. "Reality" is always a provisional construction, vulnerable to disruptive interventions or disclosures from "outside," from events that sooner or later displace every discursive arrangement that was thought to be final. Every genre in its own fashion, however, nevertheless seeks to con- strain and even abolish the contingency of what will next be said. Genres of discourse are "modes of forgetting the nothingness or of forgetting the occurrence, they fill the void between phrases" (p. 138). And this charge applies not only to the various attempts to fix the meaning of reality that comprise the philosophic tradition, but above all perhaps, since this is the author of The Postmodern Condition, to the narrative genre, the genre of narrative history "within which the heterogeneity of phrase regimens, and even the heterogeneity of genres of discourse have the easiest time passing unnoticed" (p. 151). Every genre, in fact, is suspect. To employ a Serrean idiom, discur-</page><page sequence="9">White * Lyotard's Phrases 487 sive genres seek to maximize "redundant," routine communication by excluding "noise," the chance interference or static in a circuit whose integration might yield genuine "information," the production of novelty. As Bennington says, genres provide "an illusion that link- ings are necessary (that there are laws of history)" (Lyotard, p. 154). They seek, in other words, to preclude the possibility of genuinely making a difference in what is said. The attempt enshrined in every discursive genre to resolve once and for all the question of what to say about reality entails an im- portant corollary: not only the object, but the subject of knowledge must be immobilized or removed from contingency. Praising the Kant of heterogeneous faculties and the Wittgenstein of language games as twin "prologues to an honorable postmodernity" (The Differend, p. xiii), Lyotard must nevertheless modify both Kant and Wittgen- stein to the extent that they remain "anthropomorphic." The Wittgen- steinian notion of "language games," for instance, to which Lyotard appeals uncritically in Just Gaming and The Postmodern Condition, pre- supposes players whose identities are not themselves at stake in the games they play. Lyotard maintains, to the contrary, that an utterance is not a message transmitted from a sender to a receiver. Instead, it is a "universe" that positions both parties, thereby constituting them as subjects. Lyotard would thus undo two related strategies that have his- torically served as machinery for the suppression of time: the first fixes the referent of cognitive discourse-"Being"-as a knowable totality, while the second endows the subject to whom the meaning of Being is addressed-"Man"-with an unchanging nature. At this point, he would be inconsistent if he did not also question the possibility of achieving complete knowledge of the diverse rhetorical stratagems that in fact constitute such entities as "Being" and "Man." In other words, "Language," understood as a totalizable object of knowledge, must itself not exist. To make his point, Lyotard insists on the ineluctably situated char- acter of utterance. In a discussion of Protagoras and sophistic self- referential paradoxes (such as "I am a liar") by which the Sophists sought to confound formal logic, he observes that, while "Protagoras' argument is not acceptable within logic because it bars coming to a decision," it would be acceptable within a "physics" that conceives of phrases as a physical universe of "moving objects which form an infi- nite series" (p. 7). The self-referential phrase is not part of the series at the moment of its occurrence, but it will later become so when the series is synthesized by a succeeding phrase: "The phrase consid- ered as occurrence escapes the logical paradoxes that self-referential propositions give rise to" (p. 65). In effect, Lyotard solves the prob- lem of self-referential paradoxes by suggesting that self-referentiality</page><page sequence="10">488 Poetics Today 15:3 never really happens: "The 'present' presentation is not able to be phrased now; it is only able to be phrased ... in the universe presented by another phrase" (p. 74). As Merleau-Ponty (1967: 365) observes, since "our reflections are carried out in the temporal flux on which we are trying to seize, there is no thought which embraces all our thought." No philosophy or metalanguage, no utterance of any sort, can transcend the determinations of its own occasion. Lyotard cannot therefore claim a privileged position for his own philosophy of phrases. Already in Pagan Rudiments (1977), written a few years before The Differend, he was observing that the theoretico- critical genre, "which assigns itself the objective of speaking the truth and dissipating illusions, is a particular case of the so-called literary genres, or, to be more precise, the arts of speaking" (quoted in Lyotard, p. 51). Accordingly, The Differend is meant to be received not as a tra- ditional theoretical treatise, but as what he terms "a discontinuous form of the Essay." Touching on numerous rhetorical, political, aes- thetic, and ethical topics, with digressions on thinkers as diverse as Protagoras, Gorgias, Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Adorno, Stein, and Levinas, The Differend is a speculative work, a work of "philosophy," because "the phrases in it are concatenated in such a way as to show that that concatenation is not just a matter of course and that the rule for their concatenation remains to be found" (The Differend, p. 129). In an inevitable gesture, Lyotard ironizes his own discourse: "As for the metalanguage at play in 'my' phrases here, it has no logical status, its function is not to fix the sense of a term." Rather, it merely "calls upon the capacity of ordinary language to refer to itself" (p. 69). No general definition covering every case can be given for "the phrase." To the question "What is a phrase?" Lyotard replies: "A definition is a phrase that obeys logical and cognitive rules" (p. 68). As Carroll explains, "To define what a phrase is would be to situate it in terms of one of its regimes-to reason, know, describe, tell, question, show, command, etc.-at the expense of its place in others" (Paraesthetics, p. 164). Lyotard's motive in thus characterizing both subject and object of knowledge as constituted by a heterogeneous assortment of rhetorical stratagems that can never be synthesized into a knowable whole is not far to seek. At one point in Just Gaming, he succinctly describes the problem he hopes to ameliorate: "For many of us, probably for most of us, when we play ... these [language] games, we play them without in- ventiveness" (Lyotard and Thebaud 1985: 61). The putative ultimacy of this or that set of discursive conventions, this or that representation of the real, this or that definition of what is normally or essentially human inhibits improvisational ingenuity or blunts sensitivity to the situation at hand. The Differend is therefore offered as an attempt, nec- essarily essayistic and provisional, to promote an awareness of ineluct-</page><page sequence="11">White * Lyotard's Phrases 489 able contingency. By working through the manifold consequences of the "thought of dispersion" that "shapes our context" (The Differend, p. xiii), the thought of a decentered cultural universe for which the apparently inevitable name is "postmodernity," Lyotard would induce an openness to the singular character, as Gertrude Stein would say, of the present occasion. History is the subject of a structure whose site is not homogeneous, empty time, but time filled by the pres- ence of the now. Walter Benjamin, "Theses on the Philosophy of History" More is at stake in The Differend, however, than simply the promotion of a capacity for improvisation. Lyotard's rhetorical turn is meant in fact to address a problem emerging precisely from his unqualified af- firmation (in Libidinal Economy) of inventiveness as the telos of human Being. Lyotard now seeks to overcome a certain nihilistic temptation to which his earlier theory of libidinal mobility was vulnerable. As he remarks in Peregrinations (p. 15): "The polymorphic paganism of exploring and exploiting the whole range of intensive forms could easily be swept away into lawful permissiveness, including violence and terror." In other words, Lyotard's celebration of heterogeneity sidesteps any consideration of the ethical and political concerns that had preoccupied him early in his career when he was associated with the Socialism or Barbarism group. The problem, simply put, is that the unqualified affirmation of endless becoming annuls the possibility of making judgments concerning, in particular, justice and injustice be- cause it looks forward to identifying, albeit temporarily, with every point of view. Certainly, in The Differend Lyotard does not hesitate to pass judg- ment on diverse issues. But what warrant has he for his belief that a "deliberative" politics animated by the question "What ought we to be?" is better than founding society on a narrative that tells us who we already are? On what grounds does he condemn those narratives that confer identity on one group through the paranoiac exclusion and scapegoating of another? How can he claim that "the love of occur- rence ... is the antidote to the principle of exception that limits tradi- tional narratives" (The Differend, p. 158 [emphasis added])? How can he maintain that the two principal contemporary adversaries of "philoso- phy" are "the genre of economic discourse (exchange, capital)" and the "genre of academic discourse (mastery)" (p. xiii)? For that matter, what is the basis for his resistance to the techno-scientific hegemony, to which he had referred in The Postmodern Condition under the label of "performativity," or the establishment of efficiency or optimization as</page><page sequence="12">490 Poetics Today 15:3 the sole end? Again, when he remarks, in an essay appended to Pere- grinations (p. 72), that there are "incommensurable genres of discourse in play in society, none of which can transcribe all the others," what authorizes him to oppose the fact that "one of them at least-capital, bureaucracy-imposes its rule on the others"? Consider in this con- nection the meaning of the title The Differend. A "differend," Lyotard says, arises when there is a conflict between two parties whose posi- tions are incommensurable. Such a conflict leads to a wrong when one party compels the other to adopt the terms of its own argument, as occurs, for instance, in the differend between labor and capital, which is resolved from the outset in favor of the latter, since in negotiations with employers, workers must refer to their time as a commodity. How does Lyotardjustify such ajudgment? How does he arrive at his asser- tion that "what is at stake in a literature, in a philosophy, in a politics perhaps, is to bear witness to differends by finding idioms for them" (The Differend, p. 13)? Lyotard evidently does not believe that the ethical-political realm can be given a "scientific" foundation. The ethical-political, he says, is excepted from "the hegemony of the genre of discourse called cogni- tive" (Peregrinations, p. 21). For Lyotard, "blindness or transcendental illusion resides in the pretension to found the good or the just upon the true, or what ought to be upon what is" (The Differend, p. 108). The ethical phrase-"what ought to be"-cannot legitimately be derived from the phrase of knowledge-"what is." Lyotard would thus cau- tion against what he describes, inJust Gaming, as the "deep conviction that there is a true being of society, and that society will be just if it is brought into conformity with this true being" (Lyotard and Thebaud 1985: 23). And this is the case not only because Lyotard holds that "truth" is always contingent, but because the cognitive genre can be manipulated and disabled by those whose purposes are unjust. The example Lyotard provides, crucial to his thinking throughout The Dif- ferend, is of the so-called revisionist historians, who take advantage of the "silence" that surrounds the Holocaust-of, precisely, the Nazis' having destroyed as much evidence of their crimes as possible-to claim that the historical reality of the Holocaust remains unproven. As he puts it, if justice depended simply on observing the rules of the cognitive genre, then the revisionist historians "could not be accused of a denial of justice.... But that they are not worried by the scope of this very silence they use as an argument in their plea, by this does one recognize a wrong done to... this silence." Accordingly, Lyotard says, the historian "must break with the monopoly over history" granted to the cognitive genre, must "venture forth by lending his or her ear to what is not presentable under the rules of knowledge" (The Differend, p. 57), must find a way to phrase the silence that cannot be phrased</page><page sequence="13">White * Lyotard's Phrases 491 in the conventional historical idiom. Indeed, the name of Auschwitz, as Carroll puts it, "testifies once and for all to the limitations" not only of positivist history, but of any "rational history" (such as that of Hegel) which insists on discovering a providential design in the course of events (Paraesthetics, p. 170). Lyotard argues, paraphrasing Adorno, that Auschwitz "is the name for a kind of para-experience, where dia- lectics would encounter a non-negatable negative, and would abide in the impossibility of redoubling that negative into a 'result.' Where the mind's wound would not become scarred over" because it could not redeem such a catastrophe by interpreting it as a mere moment in some progressivist scheme (The Differend, p. 88). Instead of seeking a cognitive legitimation for ethics, then, Lyotard stresses the irreducible specificity of the "ethical phrase." In a remark recalling the Benjamin epigraph that begins this section, Lyotard ob- serves, "There is no moral diachrony. Pure ethical time is the now of the phrase" (p. 126). Following Emmanuel Levinas, whose books, Lyotard remarks in Peregrinations (p. 9), were his companions for twenty years, he asserts that a thinker must be ready to heed the "call to which thinking has to be sensitive and responsive," the call that "can only befall the ego, like a revelation, through a break-in" (The Differ- end, p. 110). In the universe of the ethical phrase, the ego is "stripped of the illusion of being the addressor of phrases, grabbed hold of upon the addressee instance, incomprehensibly." The subject, in other words, experiences the ethical call precisely as an event, an event of obligation that is "immediate, prior to any intellection" (p. 111). The implementation of the ethical phrase in the realm of politics, Lyotard argues, can follow two routes. In the first, the specificity of the ethical phrase is effectively annulled when the phrase of obliga- tion becomes the object of a normative phrase. As Bennington puts it, "The normative sentence removes the addressee from the solitude of the sentence of obligation by constituting a community of addressees all subject to the law" (Lyotard, p. 154). Such occurs, for instance, in Kant, who appeals to the notion of "humanity" or a "community of rational beings," thereby imposing on the ethical phrase "the rule of consensus and of exchangeability between partners, the rule of dia- logue" (The Differend, p. 125). The recipient of the ethical phrase is thus transformed into the sender of the normative phrase, a move that, according to Bennington, "determines a particular notion of legiti- macy, namely autonomy, which is the ground of a republican politics" (Lyotard, p. 149). Ethical prescriptions made over into norms become the basis, then, of legal codes. But if such normativization is inevi- table, it is also ultimately illegitimate since not even "humanity," the ostensibly universal subject of Enlightenment thought, can ever es- cape its rootedness in a particular time and place (such as in "'national'</page><page sequence="14">492 Poetics Today 15:3 names and traditions" [The Differend, p. 161]). Alluding perhaps to the Bakhtinian carnivalesque, Lyotard says that the law must therefore be regarded with a certain disrespect or "humor": "This humor aims at the heterogeneity which persists beneath and despite legitimation.... The 'people' is not the sovereign, it is the defender of the differend against the sovereign. It is full of laughter" (p. 144). In his treatment of the second way that the ethical phrase can be effectuated, Lyotard looks to Kant's Critique of Judgment, Carroll says, "in order to investigate the political outside its determination by the cognitive ... in terms of an analogy with the aesthetic" (Paraesthetics, p. 176). Lyotard is interested here, however, not in an aesthetics of the beautiful but in a "parasitical, transgressive critical aesthetics" (p. xiv), a "paraesthetics," to use Carroll's term, that privileges the sublime in art. The paraesthetic experience of sublimity, Carroll argues, "serves as a kind of model for Lyotard's investigation of the political" because the kind of artistic practice it gives rise to-precisely, experimentalist art-questions "continually its own foundations and stakes" and ex- plores "new strategies and forms without knowing in advance exactly where they will lead" (p. 167). Sublimity entails an irreducible gap between what can be "conceived" or aspired to and what "imagined" or presented as a case. It thus provides "a kind of critical safeguard against the dogmatism of the theoretical in general. The sublime serves to push philosophy and politics into a reflexive, critical mode, to defer indefinitely the imposition of an end on the historical-political process" (p. 182). It implies, that is, an activity of judgment which can only proceed on a "case by case" basis, as in Aristotle's characteriza- tion of "prudence," without the aid of a "conceptual system that could serve as a criterion for practice" (Lyotard and Thebaud 1985: 18). There are no rules of conduct that will decide, for every circumstance, what course of action should be pursued in order to bring about a state of justice. At most, the subject will be guided by a feeling, a feel- ing that testifies to the presence of an "Idea." The ethical phrase, the feeling of obligation, must be understood, that is, as the "sign of an Idea" (The Differend, p. 126). Following Kant, Lyotard understands an "Idea" to be a sort of heuristic: sublimely unpresentable itself, it regu- lates without constraining conduct in particular situations. "Ideas," as Carroll puts it, "have as their referent a future which they, in some sense, anticipate but in no way determine" (Paraesthetics, p. 178). They allow, in Bennington's words, "a certain resistance to the pretensions of the cognitive ... but also allow a certain exercise of judgment once those pretensions have been resisted" (Lyotard, p. 146). The question concerning the grounds of Lyotard's own judgments can in this sense be answered: the Idea of "paganism," the "thought of dispersion," the paradoxical prospect of community as multiplicity, orienting practice</page><page sequence="15">White * Lyotard's Phrases 493 without predetermining the result, would provide the basis, Lyotard hopes, for a politics, to borrow one of his better-known formulations, that "would respect both the desire for justice and the desire for the unknown" (Lyotard 1984b: 67).
