This article proposes that transfrontier diplomacy, based on what is termed a consociative model of peacemaking, can ameliorate relations not only between border communities but also between central governments and even entire societies-if several conditions are met. The first is that the nations in question must "face," or consciously confront, one another, and thus have one another's full diplomatic attention. The second is that their domestic political systems must be so structured as efficiently to transmit border-community perspectives to national decision- making centers, which in turn must keep in touch with peripheral commu- nities. The third is that international agreements, including "good neighborhood" or bon voisinage treaties, should be concluded to bind countries legally to a regime of border cooperation. Such bilateral border agreements can be elicited and also reinforced by multilateral "frame- work" cooperation pacts that cover larger regions. Key words: Boundaries * Consociation * Diplomacy * International relations * Negotiation Introduction The nature of border relationships is crucial to determining the quality of the overall relationship between member states in the international system. Without mutually acceptable relations across borderlands, satisfactory relationships between adjoining nations, including diplomatic relationships between central governments in national capitals, may be almost impossible to achieve. Transboundary stability and border-area comity may thus be necessary conditions of wider, even interna- tional-regional, stability and comity. Is peace along international borders, however, also a sufficient condition of world peace? Can the amelioration of conditions along borders produce-actually, by itself, generate-global reconciliation, cooperation, "good neighborhood"? In what circumstances might diplomatic strategies that are aimed at, across, and about borders begin to have such a transformative effect? 0192-5121 (2000/02) 21:2, 121-147; 011976 ( 2000 International Political Science Association SAGE Publications (London, Thousand Oaks, CA and New Delhi)</page><page sequence="2">International Political Science Review 21(2) The validity of the above-suggested stronger thesis-namely, that a diplomacy of bon voisinage might significantly contribute to peace between nations and in the world-would depend on the fulfillment of a number of major conditions. I shall seek in this article to identify what these are, and to explain their causal impor- tance. Let me briefly state them at the outset. The first is that the nations in question must "face," or consciously confront and also formally address, one another-the crucial issue here being whether the countries and their leaders are sufficiently oriented toward, and therefore attentive to, one another. Whether or not they can thus emphasize and highlight their mutual relations may depend on the historically conditioned geopolitical orientations of the countries involved, that is, where the general population of each of the countries conceives the "front" and the "back" of that country to be. A "front"-to-"front" relationship is more likely to have significance than a "back"-to-"back" one, or even a "front"-to-"back" one or a "back"-to-"front" one. The second requirement is that the two facing countries must be internally organized-constitutionally ordered and socially connected-in such a way as to allow the effects of positive transborder relations to flow throughout their respec- tive national "bodies." The issue here is not just whether the border itself is trans- parent and permeable, but also whether the remainder of each of the national societies involved can efficiently process, and beneficially absorb, what is transmit- ted at the border, not merely the goods and services that may pass through but also the ideas and the images that can be conveyed. The very "picture," or visual landscape, of a border zone, natural features as well as border installations, helps to give content to a nation's view of its transborder and other relationships with a neighboring country. The more positive (that is, physically and socially attractive) the borderscape, on both sides, the better. "Positive"-"positive" imagery here is obviously to be preferred to "negative"-"negative," or even "positive"-"negative" or "negative"-"positive." But the border-area picture, whatever its character, must be communicated. The third condition of successful bordering diplomacy, particularly to be empha- sized, is that the "skins" of countries-reflecting the geographer Friedrich Ratzel's notion of the boundary as the "peripheral organ" of a state and thus inseparable from it (Ratzel, 1969: 23)-should somehow be bonded, legally and even institu- tionally, to the political epidermises, that is, borders of the country or countries adjacent. The key issue here is whether the mutual chafing that can occur at borders, given the discrepancies that can exist between countries, can be avoided by joint management. The effectiveness of most bilateral transborder relationships around the world can usually be reinforced by bilateral, or even multilateral, systems of transfrontier cooperation. Such "internationalization" of border-area cooperation can create larger common-border systems, as is developing today most notably within the geographic area of the expanding European Union (EU). In most parts of the globe, however, a high degree of amalgamation, with supranational controls, is hardly possible. Therefore the international diplomacy, as opposed to the supranational administration, of border arrangements must be emphasized. Even in Europe, especially its eastern and southern regions, continued diplomatic atten- tion to borders is warranted. In most countries, and also regional groupings of countries, there is an interplay between capital communities and border areas: between "centers" and "periph- eries" (Gottmann, 1980a). In those cases, as in Europe, where there is wider inter- national involvement, particularly big-power interest and also supranational 122</page><page sequence="3">HENRIKSON: Facing Across Borders organizational involvement in the making of local boundary arrangements, there may be different levels of center vs. periphery forces at play. For the convenience of future reference, those forces operating at the national level, within nations or directly between them, will be noted as national-"central" (with a small c) or national-"peripheral" (with a small p), and those of a wider scope as international- "Central" (with a capital c) and international-"Peripheral" (with a capital P). Typically today, in negotiations concerning borderlands and cross-border issues, there is a complex involvement of national-level centers and peripheries, in the immediately juxtaposed or neighboring countries, and Centers and Peripheries, representing factors in the larger international community as well. An examination of what is here called "the diplomacy of bon voisinage" must take account of these multi-level dynamics. In general, border-focused diplomacy, to be successful, must coordinate the inter- ests of centers and peripheries within and across national lines, harmonizing them so to speak. That is, both of the central governments and also the peripheral communities that are involved must be able to find that an adjustment of a border- related dispute is in the common interest. There are, as indicated, two pairs of centers and peripheries implicated, and these can interact, directly and indirectly, regardless of national lines. As shown in the "Frontier Transactions Model" of the political geographer John W. House, there can be "inter-State" transactions between the neighboring countries, that is, between central government officials situated in their respective national capitals or perhaps meeting one another elsewhere. There can be "core-periphery" transactions between the central areas and border regions within each of the two countries. There can, furthermore, be "frontier zone," or immediate cross-border, transactions. Finally, there can be, more remarkably, "core-periphery-adjacent State" transactions, involving some, though probably limited, contact between the center of one country and the periphery of the other (House, 1980: 466). Whether the four actors actually do interact (i.e., engage in active exchanges) or not, they may co-vary in their responses, and their attitudes. In order for success- ful border-based diplomacy to occur, all four of the actors, the c's and p's of each country, will need to recognize that such interchange, possibly resulting in an inter- national agreement concerning a border matter, is advantageous to them, individ- ually as well as collectively. So, too, if the larger international community is involved, should the dominant powers or leading organizations therein, the C's, and also the weaker but nonetheless perhaps influential P's, appreciate the advantage that a border agreement may bring. All parties must concur, at least in a general way, for an international border accord to be perceived as fair and just, to be imple- mented effectively, and, as a consequence, to have a chance to endure. This outcome can be achieved more readily if there is a guiding concept to inspire and to direct the diplomacy of international bordermaking. The Concept of Good Neighborhood or Bon Voisinage "In the field of world policy," Franklin D. Roosevelt declared in his first inaugural address as us President on 4 March 1933, "I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor-the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others-the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors" (quoted in Guerrant, 1950: 1). 123</page><page sequence="4">International Political Science Review 21(2) In the preamble of the Charter of the United Nations, signed at San Francisco on 26June 1945, it is loftily stated: "We the Peoples of the United Nations" express determination "to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours" (United Nations, 1990: 1). The equally authentic French- language text, always a little different, replaces "good neighbor" with "esprit de bon voisinage" (spirit of good neighborliness) (Nations Unies, 1997: 3). Article 74 of Chapter XI, concerning Non-Self-Governing Territories, commits UN members holding such territories to respect there, on the colonial periphery no less than in their metropolitan areas, "the general principle of good-neighbourliness, due account being taken of the interests and wellbeing of the rest of the world, in social, economic, and commercial matters" (United Nations, 1990: 39). The French text, almost identical, affirms "le principe general du bon voisinage dans le domaine social, economique et commercial, compte tenu des interets et de la prosperite du reste du monde" (Nations Unies, 1997: 48). It is obvious from these historically celebrated and internationally primary expressions of the idea of good neighborhood that the "policy" or "principle" of good-neighborliness/bon voisinage is not a strictly defined legal concept. The words with which it is formulated do not completely capture it. In the French-language Charter text the "esprit" of good-neighborly relations is noted, and perhaps empha- sized. The Dictionnaire de la terminologie du droit international (1960: 94) recognizes that "bon voisinage" is not "un concept juridique precis" (a precise juridical concept) but, rather, the expression of "un esprit de mutuelle consideration, de reciprocite et d'entente confiant" (a spirit of mutual consideration, of reciprocity and of confi- dent understanding). Nonetheless, certain distinct elements in the spirit idea are clear, perhaps the most basic being the notion of mutuality or reciprocity-that is, equivalency of station and interchange. Neighbors are to be accepted as being equal and thus as deserving of considerate regard when an action that might adversely affect them is being contemplated, just as if the shoe were on the other foot. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"-the Golden Rule-obtains. Moreover, there is an implied acceptance of difference or, at least, a commitment to tolerance of differ- ence. Force must not be used to change things. There is a further, more specific implication of noninterference in the internal affairs of others. These were the meanings that the notion was given in the policy context of the Roosevelt administration's "Good Neighbor Policy," narrowed as it was later in 1933 to us relations with Latin American and Caribbean countries, within the Western Hemisphere. At the Seventh Pan-American Conference in Montevideo, Uruguay, in December of that year, the American republics approved a Convention on the Rights and Duties of States which prohibited intervention by any state "in the inter- nal or external affairs of another." This express and absolute commitment to non- intervention did have antecedents in the dialectic of us-Latin American relations during the preceding Republican administrations (Welles, 1944: 185-241; Wood, 1961). As far back as February 1848, with the signature of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo on "Peace, Friendship, Limits, and Settlement" that ended the war between the United States and Mexico, the "good neighborhood" (and probably also buen vecindad) phrase was used. Suggested by the Mexican delegation (Wood, 1961: 124), this mention is considered the locus classicus of the current concept (Dictionnaire, 1960: 94). In the preamble to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo it is stated that the United States and Mexico, as between themselves, would "establish upon a solid basis 124</page><page sequence="5">HENRIKSON: Facing Across Borders relations of peace and friendship, which shall confer reciprocal benefits upon the citizens of both, and assure the concord, harmony and mutual confidence, wherein the two Peoples should live, as Good Neighbors." Article 21 of the treaty provides specifically for what should be done (and not done) if "disagreements" arose. There must be no resort, by either country, to reprisals, aggression, or hostility of any kind "until the Government of that which deems itself aggrieved, shall have maturely considered, in the spirit of peace and good neighborship, whether it would not be better that such difference should be settled by arbitration of Commissioners appointed on each side, or by that of a friendly nation" (Bevans, 1972: 792, 803). The possibility, even then, of third-party-to that extent, international-involve- ment in the maintenance of bilateral us-Mexican relations is noteworthy. The broader meaning of Roosevelt's 1933 use of the Good Neighbor expression, in its conceptual scope (beyond merely the "nonintervention" commitment) and also in its span of geographical application (into the realm of "world" policy), "has been lost," as his closest collaborator in handling inter-American matters, Sumner Welles, later commented (Welles, 1944: 192-193). The present reexamination of the concept is an effort to recover some of that lost content and spread. In truth, bon voisinage is not a practice unknown in other parts of the world. The historical geography of Europe, which happens to have more kilometers of political boundary per unit of land than any other continent, is replete with examples of boundary cooperation. Most of these have been very localized. House (1980: 459) describes the designation in Europe of parallel frontier zones, of varying widths, on either side of a border which grant local residents special customs and other privi- leges. Such zones for small-scale frontier exchanges (Kleiner Grenzverker) usually have been negotiated bilaterally, in the limited interest of the border residents. Their larger political purpose has been minimal. An illustrative historical case is the boundary arrangement contained in a 1926 commercial treaty between Hungary and Yugoslavia (League of Nations, 1929-30: 117-129; Boggs, 1940: 237-245). Its stated purpose was "to afford reciprocal traffic between the frontier zones the facilities required for daily needs." Accordingly, the text defined two 10 to 15 kilometer border zones on either side of the line. It even enumerated the foodstuffs (e.g., fresh vegetables and milk) and other necessary items (e.g., firewood and building materials) that could be transported across the border without payment of duties. For the benefit of local area farmers, the treaty provided that fields could be tilled and livestock pastured on the other side of the boundary line. "Frontier permits" would be issued to other persons who also needed regularly to cross the border. Specific crossing places and times ("between sunrise and sunset") were designated. In urgent situations, "frontier passes" could be given out by a summary procedure. During emergencies such as floods, forest fires, or other widespread calamities, frontier residents were authorized "to cross the frontier by all routes by day or by night." For the general betterment of Hungarian-Yugoslav border-area relations, some bilateral cooperation of an institutional kind was provided for in the 1926 treaty. With a view to "ensuring mutual assistance" and to "creating between the frontier authorities on both sides the atmosphere of good neighborliness," the chief officers of the two nations' frontier authorities were to meet regularly. Those officers were to "endeavour to remove any difficulties arising from incidents of slight importance and redress any grievances of the inhabitants of the frontier zones." This suggests different levels at which border-related diplomacy can be conducted. 125</page><page sequence="6">International Political Science Review 21(2) Three Levels of Border Diplomacy A diplomacy of bon voisinage-as distinct from traditional capital-to-capital diplo- macy carried out at national centers, with little or no reference to national periph- eries-can occur at any or all of three levels. The first, and highest, is the level of "summit" meetings, or direct encounters between national political leaders. Not uncommonly, these take place at border locations. Such sites at or near the politi- cal boundaries between countries may be, symbolically if not geometrically, midway between the two centers, making it possible for the leaders "to meet each other halfway," for reasons of convenience as well as regard for dignity. These meetings remain, however, essentially center-to-center encounters. The "halfway" sites chosen may not be at formal boundary lines at all but, rather, at the common edges of their respective spheres of control-that is, geopolitical equilibrium points. Sometimes they may be at military fronts, where armies meet. One thinks, for example, of the meeting in 1807 of Napoleon and Alexander I on a raft in the Neman River near Tilsit (now Sovetsk, on Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast border with Lithuania), where they famously divided power in Europe between themselves. When leaders' meetings take place at settled borders of already recog- nized state domains, they gain additional resonance therefrom. The border location enhances their presence, just as the boundary, as a line between equal sovereign- ties, is reconfirmed by their being there. An example of a more or less regular series of border-situated leaders' meetings, occurring in the North American context, are the encounters that, traditionally, have taken place at the border between the United States and Mexico when a new us president is elected. The encuentro that occurred in January 1981 between the American president-elect, Ronald Reagan, shortly before he was inaugurated, and the president of Mexico of the time, Jose Lopez Portillo, illustrates the pattern. That border actually defines the us-Mexican relationship. "Our friends south of the border" was the way Reagan referred to leaders of Mexico (and even of other, more distant Latin American nations). It is worth noting, too, that President Reagan's "first trip out of the country" following his inauguration was "a get-acquainted meeting," as he termed it, with the prime minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau (Reagan, 1990: 240). This took place in the capital of Canada, Ottawa- a political center, but also a location very close to the northern border of the United States and thus perhaps, from a Washington-centric perspective, somewhat on the periphery. Reagan's first instinct, as a new president, evidently was to keep the fences of the United States mended with the nation's "friends" to the south and to the north. There happened to be a larger, longer-term policy purpose as well: to lay a basis of neighborly understanding, at the leadership level, for the negotiation of what he had termed, in announcing his candidacy for the presidency in November 1979, a "North American accord"-the germ of what became the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). As Reagan later recalled, it had long been his belief that "the largest countries" of North America-Canada, the United States, and Mexico-should "forge a closer alliance and become more of a power in the world." The grouping would be "to our mutual economic benefit" and the example and effects of the three North American countries working together "might be able to help the Latin American countries help themselves" (Reagan, 1990: 240). Reagan's notion of tripartite North American cooperation was rooted in the concept of neigh- borhood. His very term, "accord," suggests direct, heart-to-heart contact. Reveal- 126</page><page sequence="7">HENRIKSON: Facing Across Borders ingly, he had said when he proposed the North American accord idea in 1979: "It is time we stopped thinking of our nearest neighbors as foreigners" (quoted in Henrikson, 1993: 77). The second, or middle level, of a direct diplomacy of bon voisinage is that which occurs through ministerial or subministerial contacts. These, too, are often regularized, and sometimes even institutionalized. The ministeries typically involved, besides ministries of foreign affairs such as the us State Department, are those other departments or agencies of national government having an inter- est in border-related policy matters, particularly commerce and immigration but also issues related to the environment, public health, and crime. In order to coordinate the handling of us-Mexican relations in these many areas, President Jimmy Carter and President Lopez Portillo established in 1976 a Consultative Mechanism for that purpose. The following year a Border subgroup was set up to study and cooperate in the management of common economic and social problems under the general oversight of the Consultative Mechanism (House, 1982: 256). At this subsummit level or, generally, intermediate level there should also be included the continuing transactions of such treaty-based binational or interna- tional commissions as have been established, more permanently, for the manage- ment of physical problems that may develop on borders, including possible adjustment of the borderline itself. In the context of us-Mexican border relations, there is the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), dating from the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and a water boundary treaty of 1889. In the us-Canadian context, there is the International Joint Commission (IJC), created by the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty, which has a somewhat broader purview. The third, and lowest, level is the subnational level. "Diplomacy" at this level may be conceived to include consultations that take place across national lines between state (or provincial) and also municipal authorities as well as discussions that occur between nongovernmental or private-sector groups desirous of good- neighborly relations. In 1977, for example, there was set up a us sw Border Regional Commission and, on the Mexican side, a Coordinating Commission of the National Programme for the Borders and Free Zones (House, 1982: 256). To the extent that such entities are created not only for the purpose of advancing the interests of the resident communities in the border areas but also to engender a wider comity, between neighboring countries as wholes, they can be understood to have a "polit- ical" purpose. The broader political, even consciously international purpose may justify the non-strict use of the term, "diplomatic," to describe the relevant portion of such inter-local representation and discourse.1 "Citizen diplomacy" can exist, if it is structured and if it is strategic. The diagram of House's "Frontier Transactions Model" (Figure 1) captures many of these relationships, with a distinct emphasis on such "frontier zones" as might be defined along nations' peripheries. A modification of his model by J. R. V. Prescott (1987: 160) makes a further distinction between "capitals" and "provincial centres," both of which can deal with "border settlements," as they do also with each other (Figure 2). It is the capital cities of nations, of course, from which foreign policy proper emanates, but other, non-capital urban centers, especially those located in major regions nearer the border, also can play important roles in the overall diplomacy of bon voisinage, as can border-settlement communities and their leaders themselves. 127</page><page sequence="8">International Political Science Review 21(2) States A &amp; B frontier zones Az, Bz A ore periphery Az I Az I.

Frontier Transactions Model. (J. W. House, 1980) Local and National Mending Walls: Consociative Peacemaking Ideally, a political boundary between communities should be a "Mending Wall," to use the title of Robert Frost's widely known but commonly misunderstood poem about boundary-keeping in New England (Frost, 1946: 35-36). Frost essentially posited that, in "walking the line" between fields, physical neighbors could become, by virtue of their common effort of jointly maintaining a boundary line and its markers, neighbors in further senses too-together making a neighborhood. Bound- aries are, as a chief cartographer in the us State Department, Bradford Thomas, has written, the "mortar" that holds together, as well as simply delineates the pieces of, "the giant mosaic" that is the global map (Thomas, 1999: 69). To a degree, they are the "mortar" that binds the political world itself. On whatever geographical scale, conventionally there have been thought to be two basic strategies for making peace between communities: those of an associative kind and those of a dissociative kind. The former strategies are based on the premise that remov- ing barriers between hostile or suspicious parties will help to reconcile them. The latter cc I f - 128 re</page><page sequence="9">HENRIKSON: Facing Across Borders COUNTRY X COUNTRY Y O Capital *Provincial centre * Border settlement --*.- Trans-boundary relationships FIGURE 2. Border Relationships. (J. R. V. Prescott, 1987) are founded on the opposite assumption that keeping antagonistic parties apart will reduce their antagonism and maybe even, in time, placate them. Here a third strategy, which may be termed the consociative, is proposed.2 More than just a combination of the first two strategies, it is based on the idea that the interaction, and even linking, of societies at and across boundaries in space, with the semi-permeable boundary zone working to form as well as to define a relationship, is a key to peacemaking.3 There are schools of belief concerning this subject. Those of an idealistic turn of mind have tended to favor the associative approach, preferring boundaries that are "meeting places." A few writers, such as the British geographer Lionel William Lyde in his book Some Frontiers of Tomorrow: An Aspiration for Europe (1915), have argued that boundary lines should be drawn where they might have an "assimilative" effect. He went so far as to propose (remarkably, during the first world war) that bound- aries should be "anti-defensive." He meant more than that boundaries should not be highly fortified. They should be "identified with geographical features which are associated naturally with the meeting of peoples and persons in the ordinary routine of peaceful intercourse" (Lyde, 1915: 2). The dominant perspective on political boundaries, however, surely has been the more realistically minded one that they are, almost by definition, dissociative-or "dissimilative," in Lyde's lexicon. "Functions of boundaries are in general negative rather than positive," as a former geographer of the us Department of State, Samuel Whittemore Boggs, pointed out in International Boundaries (1940). "To at least some degree they restrict the movements of peoples and the exchange of goods, of money, even of ideas" (Boggs, 1940: 11). Much the same basic outlook 129</page><page sequence="10">International Political Science Review 21(2) upon boundaries is adopted by Stephen B. Jones in his handbook, Boundary-Making (1945). Directly taking issue with Lyde's assimilationist argument, Jones declared: "Almost inevitably an international boundary offers some impedance to the circu- lation of people and goods. Therefore there may be some advantage-other things being equal-in locating a boundary in a zone where circulation is relatively weak" (Jones, 1945: 8). Earlier, Lyde's "academic idealism" had been criticized also by the British boundary-maker, Colonel Sir Thomas H. Holdich, who asserted that "the first and greatest object of a national frontier is to ensure peace and goodwill between contiguous peoples by putting a definite edge to the national political horizon, so as to limit unauthorized expansion and trespass" (Holdich, 1916: x). The trouble with both of these contending "schools" is that they do not clearly enough recognize the essential relation between the associative aspects and the dissociative aspects of boundaries. A consociative border strategy integrally connects these. Its essence is structured cooperation, spatial and functional. Consociatively connected countries are confederated in contiguity, so to speak, through formal and informal transborder links. The human use of these joint structures, in day-to-day dealings, can, figuratively, stitch foreign and alienated countries together. This style of politically conscious border-based exchange and communication between countries may be called "consociative diplomacy." The Relevance of Boundary-making Today Generally, boundaries have been thought of as problems. As Gottmann has observed, "The record of history demonstrates that political limits in geographic space have been and remain a major source of tension and conflict" (Gottmann, 1980b: 433). The emphasis of the present article is, instead, placed on the potential role of polit- ical boundaries, including administrative regimes to control them, as solutions-as ameliorative factors in situations that might, otherwise, erupt in local or general recrimination and violence. "Border incidents," in other words, can lead to peace as well as to war. What is required is a new way of looking at boundaries, to accom- modate the actively pacific roles that boundary lines and boundary systems can play. In advancing this argument, asserting the present-day efficacy of boundary- making, one must acknowledge that there is a growing belief in some regions of the world, most especially in Western Europe, that the very idea of boundary divisions is losing significance. Economic interdependence, social mobility, techno- logical exchange, and communication flows-in a single word, "globalization"- have made the very notion of achieving such aims as security, prosperity, or liberty through better territorial partitioning seem quite unrealistic and unreasonable. Nonetheless, there has not been a complete revolution. A British diplomat, Robert Cooper, has argued that there simultaneously exist in today's world three different mentalities: the pre-modern, which is essentially a tribal outlook, focused on ethnic identity and survival; the modern, which is fixated on the notions of nation-state and sovereignty and emphasizes territorial integrity; and the post-modern, which transcends political-territorial foundations and walls, and allows, even requires, openness to the outside-and from the outside. Two-way transparency is seen as advantageous. For certain purposes, such as human rights advancement, even exter- nal intervention in a country's internal affairs may be welcomed (Cooper, 1996). The European Union has carried the notion of post-modernity the furthest. Within the EU, national sovereignties to some extent have been pooled. Among the allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), too, there has been a certain joining 130</page><page sequence="11">HENRIKSON: Facing Across Borders of vital national interests in a way that reduces the importance of boundaries. Article 5 of the NATO allies' Washington Treaty (1949) affirms, remarkably, that "an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all" (North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 1995: 232). The countries in the European and Euro-Atlantic sphere and to some degree their nearby neighbors, as The Economist observed in a comment on Cooper's scheme, now operate "in a system that encourages mutual interference in each other's domestic affairs and invites constraints and surveillance in military affairs," and increasingly in other areas of policy as well (The Economist, 1997: 41-43). Post-modernism does not mean, however, that boundaries are obliterated. They are, rather, becoming more differentiated. Their functions are now more various. Some borders themselves are becoming extended. Countries located along or amidst oceans now in most cases have much wider national maritime boundaries.4 The sea frontiers of the world are today much more inclusive and complex than they once were. For small island states, especially, the vast spatial aggrandizement that is implied is an enormous complication, for it entails increased national administra- tive responsibility and diplomatic involvement, with neighbors and others. So numerous, layered, and diversified have boundary arrangements become that, as Bradford Thomas suggests, they cannot even be graphically delineated, on the map, as before. "'Full international boundaries'-those boundaries agreed by the two states being separated-came to have relatively uniform functions and be repre- sented by a single symbol on the world political map," as he reflects. "Departures from that symbol represented not a change in function but such differences in legal status as disputed boundaries, cease-fire lines, and provisional administrative lines." Today, however, "changing concepts of territorial sovereignty and even of the state are bringing more variation in the functions of international boundaries and a tendency for decline in the number or level of functions a boundary may perform. A single 'international boundary' symbol no longer will suffice for the world politi- cal map" (Thomas, 1993: 1-2).5 Boundaries of "post-modern" economic and politi- cal communities-such as the European Union arguably is becoming-or even the common outer limits of merely "modern" bilateral or multilateral international free trade areas-such as Canada, the United States, and Mexico have together formed with their NAFTA-should perhaps be drawn on the political map. They are certainly now parts of most Europeans' and North Americans' "mental maps" (Henrikson, 1980, 1991, 1993, 1995). The EU members and the NAFTA countries thus would be presented as collectivities or groupings, as well as individual nations. Within some countries, certain lines of division, including "pre-modern" ones, also might need to be drawn in order better to indicate current and changing reali- ties. The continuing disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is an example of an ethno-national dialectic that has taken clearer and clearer linear form. To be sure, the administrative borders within Yugoslavia that have emerged as interstate boundaries have not, except in the case of the Croatia-Slove- nia interrepublican line, conformed well with the actual ethnographic map. As conveniences, however, they have been used as the basis of what have become in some cases major international frontiers (Ratner, 1996). There must be "a better way" to make boundaries between countries, so as to help resolve international tensions and engender peaceful and productive relations. As indicated earlier, there are three basic conditions that an effective peace- through-bordering, or "good neighbor," diplomacy may need to fulfill. These are discussed more fully below. 131</page><page sequence="12">International Political Science Review 21(2) Geographical Confrontation and Diplomatic Attention The first premise of effective transborder6 diplomacy, as suggested at the outset of this article, is that, in order for border relations to bring larger intercommunal or, if between sovereign parties, international peace, is that the two (or possibly more) actors, seated in their respective territories, must think of themselves as "facing," or geopolitically confronting and also directly addressing, one another. The very word "frontier," it may be noted, derives from the Latin word,frons, for "forehead." Thus an anthropomorphic factor is built into the very idea of international relations at and across frontiers. The orientation of a country is a very complex matter, involving not only geogra- phy itself but also history and culture-as well as, more specifically, a country's foreign policy traditions and habits of diplomacy. Nonetheless, certain fundamen- tal things can be said. Any geographic space is altered by the conscious outlook of the human intelligence, individual and collective, residing in the corporeal entity, or "body," of the people occupying it. As was written long ago by Immanuel Kant, "our geographical knowledge, and even our commonest knowledge of the position of places, would be of no aid to us if we could not, by reference to the sides of our bodies, assign to regions the things so ordered and the whole system of mutually relative positions" (Kant, 1929 [1768]: 22-23, quoted in Tuan, 1977: 36). The geographer Yi-Fu Tuan epitomizes this Kantian psycho-geographical perception this way: "The human being, by his mere presence, imposes a schema on space" (Tuan, 1977: 36). That is to say (generalizing from a single person to a part or the whole of a society), the way a community "faces" makes an area, whether a linear border zone or a broader territory ahead, a "front." The basic point, in the present context, is a deceptively simple one: in order to negotiate effectively with another country, a country must face that country. It is only thus that vistas of opportunity can be opened up, which an entire society as well as its leadership can "see." And, of course, the other country must face it too. That is, the diplomatic confrontation should be mutual. As suggested earlier, "front"-"front" negotiations, though not the only ones possible, are the most likely to result in breakthroughs for peace. Some contiguous or nearly contiguous countries "face" each other, and others do not. Some peripheral zones in Europe, particularly those marginal territories between the great state-building cores, have been what the political scientist Stein Rokkan termed "interface peripheries" (Rokkan, 1980: 175). The historical relation- ship between France and Germany, fraught with fear as well as familiarity, is an example of a genuine face-to-face dialectic, and it may be used to illustrate the above-mentioned point. Following the Second World War, hundreds of border- located and other communities within France and Germany joined in bilateral cooperative relationships, notablyjumelage, or twinning, pacts. At the highest level of national leadership too, direct transborder politics were emphasized, for symbolic as well as for substantive reasons. One can cite, at the personal level, the roles of the French Foreign Minister, Robert Schuman, and the German Chancellor, Dr. Konrad Adenauer, both Rhinelanders, in constructing the postwar French-German relationship, including the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), in part on the basis of their commonly experienced neighborhood. Indeed, their approach to reconciliation was more than neighborly: it was consociatively binational, aimed at joining their countries geo-functionally. When Schuman visited Bonn for the first time as foreign 132</page><page sequence="13">HENRIKSON: Facing Across Borders minister in January 1950, he said at a luncheon given for him by Adenauer that "when one day the history of our time and its problems is written, it will be recog- nized that we attempted an important piece of work here on the Rhine, our Rhine, the German and French Rhine, this river that is one entity despite all national frontiers" (quoted in Adenauer, 1965: 235). Countries that are larger and geopolitically more detached, such as the United States on its transcontinental base in North America, have somewhat more freedom of orientation. The United States can "face" Europe, toward which it was originally and traditionally oriented (Meinig, 1986); or, alternatively, it can swing toward the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on challenges there-in so doing, "turning its back," it seems, on the Old Country. To be sure, it is probably still the northeastern seaboard of the United States, for most of its history the main gateway for imports and immigration, that is considered by most Americans the nation's "front" (Tuan, 1977: 42; Gottmann, 1961). Nonetheless, the geopolitical constraints on Uncle Sam are not so great as to prevent a shifting of the national "geobody" toward other horizons. The smaller countries of North America, Mexico and Canada, are weaker and more vulnerable, and cannot so easily turn away from their immediate neighbor- hood-and neighbor. In President Porfirio Diaz's famous lament, "Pobre Mexico, tan lejos de Dios y tan cerca de los Estados Unidos" (poor Mexico, so far from God and so close to the United States). For Mexicans, the Colossus of the North simply cannot be ignored, given the pressure of power in their vicinity. Whether or not to "face" the United States is thus not really a choice. The northern frontier is the place where most of the exchanges with the United States occur. It is thus not surprising that Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario Green, in her first ministerial address, accepted responsibility for coordinating "los diversos aspectos de la relaci6n compleja e intensa con los Estados Unidos de America, vecino geografico, socio comercial y con quien compartimos la mayor de nuestras fronteras" (the diverse aspects of the complex and intense relationship with the United States of America, geographic neighbor, commercial partner and with whom we share the greatest of our frontiers) (Green Macias, 1998). Her Canadian counterpart, Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, also has described preserving the positive "world's longest border" relationship with the United States as a primary responsibility. "The Canada-us border is a potent symbol of the enduring partnership between our two countries," he writes. "It is symbolic of the many ties that link our citizens and our destinies. Much more than a simple dividing line, our common border is a model of trust, mutual respect and cooperation between our two nations" (Axworthy, 1999). It is unlikely that any us Secretary of State at any time in American history would have felt so obliged to place such an emphasis on managing relations with neigh- boring Mexico or Canada. Geopsychologically, those two next-door countries lie somewhat to the "left" or "right" of the main course of American concerns, depend- ing on which way the United States then is facing. "In our experience as mobile animals," as Yi-Fu Tuan emphasizes, "front and back are primary, right and left are secondary" (Tuan, 1977: 42). To the extent that American society is similar to individual persons in psychology of spatial orientation, it requires a "turn" for us authorities, at the national headquarters in Washington, to address relations with either Mexico or Canada head-on, "frontally," with full attention. Except on rare occasions, as during the Reagan administration which was exceptional in its initial North American continental policy interest, those countries tend to be dealt with "sideways," as a consequence of us officials' major foreign policy attention being 133</page><page sequence="14">International Political Science Review 21(2) "I'm Here To Stay, Too" FIGURE 3. Global Confrontation. ("Herblock," The Washington Post, 1947) directed across the Atlantic, toward Western Europe and Russia, or across the Pacific, toward Asian nations. America's main adversary, Russia, has scarcely been in direct contact with the United States at all. Historically, the two countries have seemed to be on opposite sides of the globe. This changed somewhat during the Cold War, when the geostrategic attention of Soviet and us planners came to be focused on the Arctic zone. When Uncle Joe (Stalin) and Uncle Sam as personifications of the two countries faced each other at the top of the globe, as in a 1947 cartoon by the Washington Post's Herbert Block ("Herblock"), the geographical context ("One World") of their political confrontation was not at all well defined or delimited (Bailey, 1950: 321; Henrikson, 1975: 46) (Figure 3). The high north strategic frontier, though vitally important in defense, had very little transformative poten- tial for the Russian and American nations in general, for it was "watched" over mainly by the military, a specialized sub-culture. Only large-scale economic devel- opment, including extension of shipping and air transport routes, of the whole 134</page><page sequence="15">HENRIKSON: Facing Across Borders resource-rich circumpolar zone-an "Arctic Mediterranean," as some fancied it- might have caused widespread Russian and American ties to form into a transarc- tic international "neighborhood" (Henrikson, 1990; Young, 1996). As it was, the only Russian-us boundary "interface" was between Big Diomede Island (Ostrov Ratmanova) and Little Diomede Island in the Bering Strait. National Organization and Internal Transmission Besides the requirement that countries must be thought of as "facing" each other in order for an improvement of transborder relations to have a pervasive effect throughout their societies, there is a second condition that, as has been suggested, needs to be met: that the physically juxtaposed societies be organized internally in such a way as to communicate relevant information and imagery from the border areas to the center, and around the country. The country must work cybernetically (Deutsch, 1966). Put in anatomical terms, the national "body" must be well artic- ulated. It must have a solid bone structure, that is, a strong constitutional-political framework. It must have an efficient digestive, or economic, system, so that inter- nal flows of goods and services occur smoothly. It must have a responsive nervous system as well, so that impulses from the periphery are transmitted throughout. The effectiveness of transfrontier diplomacy requires that border zones and their populations must be adequately represented at the center, or at least have suffi- cient communication with it. The capital or, more broadly, the national government must have some presence, or at least representation, in the border areas as well. The importance of the internal "structure" of a country in shaping its external geographical relationships, as Jean Gottmann noted (Gottmann, 1973: 143-154), has not been adequately recognized. An example of how things can go wrong, even in a democratic country where center and periphery may be presumed to be mutually responsive, is the furor that resulted from an exchange of notes, done "in secrecy" as it seemed to some suspi- cious critics of the action (Olson, Seidenberg, and Selle, 1998: 75), by the central governments of the United States and the Soviet Union in 1977 with regard to the American-Russian maritime boundary. Dating from the 1867 us purchase of Russian Alaska, this sea frontier remained vague in places. The two governments' understanding in 1977 was that, in establishing the 200-nautical-mile fisheries conservation zones which they both were setting up at that time, they would mutually respect, and be limited by, the 1867 Convention Line. There was consid- erable uncertainty regarding the exact location of that Line, however, owing to a technical difference in the way the two governments depicted it cartographically. The Soviet government showed it as a series of rhumb (compass) lines and the us government showed it as a series of great circle arcs. This produced a vast area of overlap in the Bering Sea of almost 21 000 square nautical miles. Already there were fisheries enforcement problems, which now became more difficult. A formal US-Soviet Maritime Boundary Agreement regarding the disputed matter, which essentially split the difference between the competing claims, was signed on 1 June 1990, at a Washington summit meeting (Charney and Alexander, 1993: 447-460). The treaty still has not gone into effect, however, because the Russian side, with the Duma refusing to give its consent, has not been able to ratify it. There is continued pressure for the cross-boundary sharing of resources-and also for the better conser- vation of them, for us-based fishermen suspect Russian (and Russian-licensed) fisher- men of taking too many juvenile pollock, thus depleting the stock of that species. 135</page><page sequence="16">International Political Science Review 21(2) The controversy has helped to draw attention not merely to the 1990 treaty text but also to an executive agreement that soon afterward accompanied it. The latter understanding was effected by an exchange of notes between us Secretary of State James A. Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. It committed the two sides to abide by the terms of the 1990 treaty until it came into force. Although State Department and other federal officials dutifully conferred with the Governor of Alaska and his colleagues inJuneau, it seemed to some Alaskans that the whole arrangement had been negotiated, at a distance, without sufficient input from them. Partly in response to this local feeling, Representative Don Young (R., Alaska), as well as some other members of the us Congress, protested against the executive agreement "giveaway"-of oil and gas resources as well as fish. They requested more information from the administration and insisted that any bound- ary-and-resources agreement with the Russians be validated in treaty form only (Olson, Seidenberg, and Selle, 1998: 84-85). Alaskans were not alone. Fishing and other interests in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington also were concerned. The legislature of California, apparently fearing that if the federal government could ignore one state in negotiating international maritime boundary agreements it could ignore California as well, passed a resolution in support of Alaska's right to be represented in us-Russian boundary talks (Olson, Seidenberg, and Selle, 1998: 85, 86-87). The us-Canada maritime frontier has also been the scene of controversy, most recently over salmon fishing. In both the United States and Canada, peripheral interests-including native Indian groups, with "premodern" rights-have been at odds not just with each other, as fishing competitors, but with their respective national centers, the federal governments in Washington and Ottawa, as well. At issue has been the setting of quotas for the two countries under the 1985 Pacific Salmon Treaty between the countries. Pacific salmon hatch in rivers in the United States and Canada, then go to sea, and eventually return to their native rivers to reproduce, migrating down the coast from Alaska to Oregon. In 1997 a flotilla of Canadian fishermen at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, forcibly blockaded an Alaska ferry in protest against Alaskan fishermen for intercepting too many of "their" fish. British Columbia's populistic premier, Glen Clark, threatened to deny the us Navy continued use of a torpedo test range in Nanoose Bay off the BC coast over the issue. His provocative expressions prompted the Canadian federal govern- ment to assert national jurisdiction. Accordingly, Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson negotiated with the us government a new quota regime, if not perfect "salmon peace." This us-Canadian salmon agreement, concluded inJune 1999, will set future quotas on the scientific basis of abundance, rather than equity. The us side, whose share of the total Pacific salmon harvest is expected to drop from 20.5 percent to 16.5 percent, has promised to contribute funds for salmon population restoration work. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy commented in a joint statement, implicitly acknowledging continued center-periphery and periphery-periphery tensions, that the new arrangement "represents a victory for all those on both sides of the border interested in salmon conservation and the long-term viability of our salmon industries" (Kenworthy and Pearlstein, 1999). With regard to the southwestern border of the United States, too, there have been serious disjunctions between federal diplomacy and local politics. At the center in Washington, there often are considerations of policy, regarding overall relations with the government of Mexico in an international relations context, that do not 136</page><page sequence="17">HENRIKSON: Facing Across Borders have much bearing on the lives of those, American citizens and Mexican citizens as well, who live at the border. The impact of these federal level initiatives toward the other, notably the conclusion of the massive NAFTA arrangement, is stressful for the local communities along the border. As John House, who closely studied the problem of inadequate coordination between center and periphery in managing border relations between the United States and Mexico, remarked, "It will be entirely within the verdict of history if all decision-making continues to be central- ized in Washington DC and Mexico DF, whether or not this may be to the detriment of the dwellers on both banks of the Rio Grande" (House, 1982: 256). In the southeastern corner of the United States as well, tensions arise from the different perspectives of federal capital and local community interests. Florida is but 90 miles from Cuba, from which many present-day Floridians have fled. An example of center-periphery misunderstanding in this setting is the strong opposi- tion of many anti-Castro "Miami Cubans" to President Clinton's decision, expressed in a joint communique with the government of Cuba on 9 September 1994, to revise the status of fleeing Cubans under the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act. Accordingly, all Cubans subsequently coming into the United States no longer are to be treated presumptively as political refugees but are, rather, to be considered as ordinary immigrants, without assurance of automatic admission to the United States. A general "key," if one such salient factor exists, to solving the problems of inter- nal coordination between center and periphery in dealing with neighboring countries may be found in consociative diplomacy. Ways need to be found somehow to bridge-actually to structure-the wide gap that usually exists between central government and peripheral areas on both sides of a dividing line. Local communities and even individual states, or provinces, usually lack the power, in themselves, to command attention as anything like "equal" partners in national decision-making regarding relationships with neighbors. At home, within their own country, they are just one periphery among many. They may need to concert their efforts, and join their weights, transnationally, with the border community opposite with which they have a direct interface and proximate interests. This can be done with interstate, interprovincial, and even somewhat broader interregional "alliances," including public-private partnerships, that extend across national lines. International Agreements and Transfrontier Cooperation The third condition for a successful "peace through neighborhood" strategy, as indicated, is the international one. There can be agreements across borders, includ- ing not only bilateral pacts but also, where relevant, multilateral ones affecting international regions, which advance and support transfrontier relationships. These agreements, because they join pairs or groups of countries formally, can enhance international stability and serve as a basis of confidence for transactions of economic and other kinds. They are legal commitments and are to be taken seriously. In particular, treaties which include good neighborhood, or bon voisinage, provisions which bind countries together via cooperative border arrangements are needed, not only to symbolize but also actually to secure "close" relations between contiguous nations. In the part of the world of the original Good Neighbor Policy, there have been many occasions for the practice of transfrontier diplomacy, resulting in some cases in formal accords. The New World, born in intercolonial rivalry with a plurality of "premodern" heritages as well, is notorious for its territorial and boundary 137</page><page sequence="18">International Political Science Review 21(2) FIGURE 4. Peru-Ecuador Border Conflict. (B. L. Thomas, 1999) disputes.7 Some notable ones have been those between Bolivia and Paraguay, Peru and Colombia, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and British Honduras, and Peru and Ecuador, a recurrent conflict that in 1995 again broke out in open warfare. In every one of these cases, the peace machinery of the Inter- American System, a moral-legal framework, was used to help contain and resolve the controversy. The Peru-Ecuador case is unusual in that a number of the hemisphere's great powers were directly involved, as guarantors of a settlement-functioning as a kind of "Western Hemispheric Center." The effective instrument was the Peruvian-Ecuadorian Protocol of Peace, Friendship, and Boundaries signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1942 both by the disputants and by Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States. Brazil has been the leader of the guarantors group. The controversy was not completely settled in 1942, however, in part because of specific alignment disagreements (termed impases) concerning several sectors of the Rio Protocol boundary line (Thomas, 1999: 79, 80) (Figure 4). After further fighting in 1981, 1984, and 1995, the matter was finally resolved in an agreement-the Brasilia Presi- dential Act-signed by the presidents of Peru and Ecuador under Brazil's auspices on 26 October 1998. This new treaty was sealed and put into effect not in Brazil but on the frontier itself on 13 May 1999, at the border town of Puesto Cahuide. Peru's President Alberto K. Fujimori and Ecuador's President Jamil Mahuad met there, shook hands, and together ceremoniously dedicated an orange-painted boundary stone. This was the last of the settings marking the border and it completed the boundary gestalt, so to speak, spatially and temporally. "Here is the 138</page><page sequence="19">HENRIKSON: Facing Across Borders final frontier [boundary] between two neighboring peoples that managed to come together and reach agreement," declared President Fujimori. "We are putting an end to disputes," said President Mahuad, "closing wounds to start a new, healthy life" (The New York Times, 1999). Photographs and other recordings publicized the event throughout Peru and Ecuador, Latin America, and the world. In its substance, the Peru-Ecuador border agreement might not have been possi- ble but for the two countries' acceptance of an arbitration decision rendered by the Brazil-chaired guarantors-the Center. The agreement was a "package deal." It collectively settled all of the issues assigned to binational commissions dealing with commerce and navigation, with border integration, with confidence-building measures, and with on-site border demarcation. A principal element of the package was Ecuador's final acceptance in principle of the 1942 Rio Protocol's line of division, which had precluded it from being an "Amazon" (and Atlantic) country as well as a Pacific coastal country. This favored Peru, though Ecuador did actually gain a square kilometer of private-not formally sovereign-territory on the Peruvian side of the border. This symbolic piece of real estate, at Tiwinza on top of the Cordillera del Condor, was the site of Ecuador's last military holdout against Peru in the 1995 war. The place was to be consecrated by a monument to the country's war dead. The other major element was Ecuador's gaining navigation rights-again, without sovereign access-to the Amazon River and its tributaries in Peru, along with two trading centers thereupon. The treaty plan further provided for establishment, by both countries, of a transborder ecological park across which transit would be guaranteed and within which no military forces (only police) would be allowed (Simmons, 1999: 15, 20). In separate understandings, the two countries planned also to link up their electrical grids; and Peru agreed that Ecuador, an oil producer, could have access to one of its underutilized pipelines (The New York Times, 1998). The "incentives" for this border accord were both national and international. Each country would save in terms of defense expenses and the cost of human lives. It was clearer to both Peru and Ecuador than ever before that mending fences between themselves was a de facto precondition of their being accepted, by other countries, in a broader neighborhood of international cooperation such as MERCO- SUR-not to mention the 1.5 billion in international loans for the future develop- ment of the two countries' poorer regions that was on offer from the center (The New York Times, 1999). The internal and external attractions of the agreement were such that it could be observed that "South America may, for the foreseeable future, in 1995 have seen its last last war over territorial claims" (The Economist, 1998b). The Old World, too, is progressing toward peace on and via boundaries. A major factor is the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), signed in Helsinki in August 1975. While not a "peace treaty" between the second world war adversaries or a formal legitimization of the Cold War geographic division of Europe, the Helsinki Final Act, with 35 initial signers, was a fundamental commitment to the principle of the "territorial integrity" of states-a precondition, though not itself the essence, of "good neighborhood." Recognizing that frontiers can be modified in accordance with international law, by peaceful agreement, the Act also solemnly declares: "The participating States regard as inviolable all one another's frontiers as well as the frontiers of all States in Europe and therefore they will refrain now and in the future from assaulting these frontiers." There was a positive, constructive aspect to their commitment as well. Under the rubric of "Co- operation Among States," the participants in Helsinki stated that they would 139</page><page sequence="20">International Political Science Review 21(2) "endeavour, in developing their co-operation as equals, to promote mutual under- standing and confidence, friendly and good-neighbourly relations among themselves, international peace, security and justice" (us Department of State, 1975: 324-326).8 There subsequently was concluded, originally with a focus on Western Europe, a "European Outline Convention on Transfrontier Cooperation Between Territorial Communities or Authorities." It was negotiated under the auspices of the Council of Europe at a meeting in Madrid on 21 May 1980 (Council of Europe, 1982). This master framework text authorizes agreements for cooperation between neighbor- ing noncentral authorities in such fields as urban and rural development, protection of the environment, improvement of public facilities and services, and mutual assis- tance in case of emergencies. It is aimed especially at improving conditions in the "frontier regions," with those of Eastern Europe-Europe's "periphery"-now being politically accessible as well. In so doing, it can contribute to "the spirit of fellow- ship which unites the peoples of Europe." Even more recently in Europe, just following the collapse of the USSR and the reunification of Germany, there seemed a need to intervene to "stabilize" relations among, especially, the smaller European states in the east which, formerly, had been held firmly together by the Warsaw Treaty Organization. The government of France proposed a treaty that would not be an assistance pact but would, rather, offer a kind of code of conduct for countries wishing to join the western institu- tions, centrally the European Union. In April 1993 the French Premier, Edouard Balladur, proposed an international conference, on the model of Europe's great international conferences of history, to realize the French aim. This-the Balladur Initiative-resulted in the Pact on Stability in Europe of March 1995. Taken up by the European Union, the Stability Pact idea, though watered down somewhat both in its organizational and in its funding implications, was an initial Joint Action of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), successor to the CSCE, was to administer the Pact. A major emphasis of the Stability Pact, an international-Centrally (capital c) driven project, was on a consolidation of frontiers. Balladur's original idea of suggesting possible minor frontier rectifications was dropped-as likely to open a Pandora's box. It was, perhaps, considered too merely "modern" a European approach to territorial problems. Nonetheless, international-Peripheral (capital P) states wishing benefits, including possible future organizational membership, were to reaffirm their commitment to the inviolability of frontiers and to make agree- ments between themselves pledging "good neighborliness." In addition, they were asked, in appropriate cases, explicitly to acknowledge the rights of national minori- ties in their midst-a controversial international recognition of the concept of collective rights. A notable example is the sizable Hungarian minority inside Romania, along the border area and in Transylvania within the interior. In consequence of the Balladur Initiative, there was negotiated a "Treaty on Understanding, Co-operation and Good Neighbourly Relations between Romania and the Republic of Hungary." It included minority protection as well as mutual boundary recognition. National minorities were recognized as "integral parts" of the societies in which they lived and "territorial claims" were forever disavowed. Signed on 16 September 1996, in Romania (near the Hungarian border) at Timisoara, which was considered the "cradle" of the 1989 Romanian democratic revolution (in which many ethnic 140</page><page sequence="21">HENRIKSON: Facing Across Borders Hungarians participated), this was a politically complicated but psychologically needed accord (Szekely, 1999). Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn went there himself to sign it. This was his first trip to Romania since he had taken office more than two years before. The Hungarian-Romanian basic treaty is one of the most important of the more than a hundred such bilateral agreements facilitated-in a sense, required-by the Balladur Initiative and the ensuing Stability Pact. In most of the cases, the existence of an international political-juridical frame- work worked together with the enticement of eventual membership in the EU, and also in NATO, to encourage countries in Eastern Europe, with historical grievances against their neighbors, to set these aside. Formal bilateral agreements, promising good neighborliness, by themselves would not have been sufficient to initiate processes of real reconciliation, if only because the countries of that region had historical recollections of the failure of such agreements in the interwar period and the "fraternal" Soviet era (Szekely, 1999). In this context, the CSCE and EU initia- tives especially, along with the more specifically frontier-oriented programs of the Council of Europe, have helped to give shape, if not the emotional content, to a new general movement of European fence-mending. Conclusion How significant are these peace-via-borders international arrangements? Are they likely to prove to be effective in engendering the bilateral processes of reconcilia- tion, where they are needed, and, more generally, the spirit of regional good neigh- borhood? Are they, in truth, relevant today, given that they emphasize action at the level of the nation-state, or "modernity," and may not take adequate account either of "pre-modern" ethnicity questions or the prospect of "post-modern," post-inter- national integration? Maybe the very idea is anachronistic. The upshot of the matter seems to be that borders, though their technical functions and policy contours are changing, are as important as they ever have been. To be sure, the processes of "globalization" seem to be indifferent to borders. "But it is almost as though international politics obeyed some strange principle of the conservation of finitude," The Economist observes: "as some borders fall, so others rise" (The Economist, 1998a). In Europe, in particular, one sees that, as internal restrictions on the flow of goods, capital, and persons, within the EU itself, are being removed, pressures increase for greater controls at the outer margins of the Union as it expands. Some new EU members, such as Austria, that in the past had quiet border towns on their own frontiers now find themselves on the administrative front lines, for Europe. This has increased the need for the European Union "to arrive at more coherent frontier region policies" (Anderson, 1996: 126). In this context, formal diplomacy of the kind that produced the Hungarian- Romanian Treaty on Understanding, Co-operation, and Good Neighbourly Relations can assume a new importance, not just as fulfillment of a conditio sine qua non for membership in the EU but also as a practical basis for closer community, based on reciprocity, in the region of cohabitation itself, regardless of when or whether EU membership comes. The Timisoara treaty and others like it must actually be used. Even though these treaty arrangements may be endowed, in insti- tutional terms, with little more than joint intergovernmental committees and thus may lack methods or means of implementation, they do constitute important inter- national guarantees of stability. If national minorities across borders, such as the Magyars in Transylvania, do remain in place owing in part to these basic treaties, 141</page><page sequence="22">International Political Science Review 21(2) these groups will be in a position, especially as borders become more open, to realize "their most progressive endeavor," which is to be "a bridge between two neighbor- ing nations" rather than a cause of division and conflict (Szekely, 1999). Transboundary diplomacy, whether based on treaties or not, may not produce enormous "spillover" effects (McCormick, 1996: 15-20). This is true even though some boundary-focused international agreements, such as, the Hungarian-Roman- ian treaty, reach well into the interiors of the countries involved, illustrating the "core-periphery adjacent State" type of transaction that is described in House's model (Figure 1). Some of these contacts and exchanges may seem legal and techni- cal. And "functional integration" across borders does not automatically lead to "political and social integration," as Michael Keating concludes from an extensive analysis of European regional cooperation policies (Keating, 1998: 182). Neverthe- less, international contacts across borders, which may be facilitated by programs such as those sponsored by the Council of Europe, or the European Commission's INTERREG program, do form networks that have a cohesive force (Anderson, 1996: 121; Keating, 1998: 180-181). Increasingly, there is developing, not only in Europe, what Keating describes as "an interpenetration of territorial policy spaces" (Keating, 1998: 183). This inter- penetration can blur the distinctions between places and it can confuse identities, in what might otherwise be a beneficial "post-modern" fashion. Colorful "pre- modern" patterns-that is, the relationship of ethnicity or nationality groups to their homelands-may fade badly. Even "modern," or nation-state ties of belong- ing-the psychological level at which diplomacy is traditionally conducted-may become lost to sight, obscured by a welter of competing juridisdictions, on differ- ent geographical scales and with different spatial and functional dividing lines between them, varying with the different policy purposes being advanced. "Tradi- tional diplomacy," as Keating rightly recognizes but does not positively enough stress, "covers the whole range of state interests and seeks to present a united front to the world" (Keating, 1998: 178). There is something to be said for keeping conventional political boundaries of nations at the fore. They are the sovereign "interface" between countries. The entities they define remain, still, the locus of loyalty, of patriotic feeling, for people in most parts of the world. The international system is yet, basically, an interstate system. Diplomacy, being the method by which states address each other, retains a fundamental importance. This may even be increasing. It is the only way countries can deal with each other as wholes. For diplomacy to work, nations must continue to have personalities. Persona, by definition, is unitary (Strawson, 1959: 87-116). In this situation, the personification of international relations through meetings between nations' political leaders at borders can have a pivotal, even transfor- mative role, for they interconnect the bodies politic of countries in ways that other kinds of communication, even summit meetings held elsewhere, may not. The national body "gestures" made at border locations have a directness, spontaneity, and force that those made in capital cities rarely have. They actually touch another country; and its people, and those of the country doing the touching, can feel it. Consider, as a final example of the diplomacy of bon voisinage, the trip, by bus, that India's Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee made across "Line Zero" at Wagah on the Punjab border between India and Pakistan on 20 February 1999, to meet his Pakistani counterpart, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. These two countries, suffering "cartographic anxiety" (Khrishna, 1997: 83) owing to their origin in parti- 142</page><page sequence="23">HENRIKSON: Facing Across Borders tion, were acutely sensitive to one another. What occurred at that normally closed border post was felt throughout the subcontinent. Nominally a journey to inaugu- rate a scheduled bus service between New Delhi and Lahore, Prime Minister Vajpayee's novel exercise in "bus diplomacy" was much more. "I bring the good will and hopes of my fellow Indians, who seek abiding peace and harmony with Pakistan," he said when he met, and embraced, Prime Minister Sharif at the border. "I am conscious that this is a defining moment in South Asian history, and I hope we will be able to rise to the challenge" (Bearak, 1999). This "challenge" included the difficult issues of sovereign control over and fight- ing in Kashmir and also lesser boundary matters including the western sea border between India and Pakistan. The basic survival issue posed by the two countries' strategic nuclear rivalry was also of existential concern. The fact that the modest Vajpayee-Sharif summit occurred, and occurred where it did at the very center of the fronts of both countries, provided an optimal geodiplomatic setting for begin- ning to resolve, or at least for restricting, these conflicts. Boundaries do make friends as well as foes. They function, at any level, to stabi- lize social relationships. As John BrinckerhoffJackson, philosopher of landscape, has written, "They make residents out of the homeless, neighbors out of strangers, strangers of enemies" (Jackson, 1972: 15). They can be transformative. It has been the fundamental purpose of this article to challenge the notion that international political boundaries are chiefly, as the geopolitician Karl Haushofer (1972) considered them, "fighting places." They are not, however, simply "meeting places," either. Borders and border control systems are more complex phenomena: they both divide and unify. When synthesized across national lines they can be, in addition, "joining places," capable of connecting wholly different countries, conso- ciatively, in certain kinds of organized cooperation while maintaining their distinc- tiveness and independence, in good neighborhood. Notes 1. The political scientist Ivo Duchacek has a more complex nomenclature for subnational transborder diplomacy. He distinguishes between "global microdiplomacy (or paradiplomacy)" and "transborder regionalism." The former refers to "processes and networks through which subnational governments search for and establish cooperative contacts and compacts on a global scale, usually with foreign central governments and private enterprises." The latter refers to "the sum of the various informal and formal networks of communications and problem-solving mechanisms which bring contiguous subnational territorial commu- nities into decisional dyads or triads-that is, bicommunal or tricommunal transfrontier regimes" (Duchacek, 1986: 14, 17). 2. There is, perhaps, no such thing as a completely novel word. Upon checking in Webster's, I find "consociation," a "voluntary council or union of neighboring Congregational churches" (Webster's Third New International Dictionary, 1961: 484). Interestingly, there is thus an inbuilt geographical component in this historical meaning. Spatiality is implicit, too, in Arend Lijphart's notion of "consociational democracy," which deals with the struc- turing of relations between proximate or even intermingled ethnic or religious groups within the same, plural society. Only if secession or partition occurs would "the model of international diplomacy," which is emphasized in this article, apply (Lijphart, 1977: 45). 3. Elements of all three theories-associative, dissociative, and consociative-may be found in Frost's poem, "Mending Wall." The associative view is implied by the line: "Something there is that doesn't love a wall." The forces of nature itself, during the upheavals of winter, have caused boundary stones to tumble down, thus seeming not to want the wall 143</page><page sequence="24">International Political Science Review 21(2) to exist. The dissociative view (surely not Frost's own) is expressed by the Yankee farmer who, moving along the stone barrier as in a dark age, keeps repeating his father's saying, "Good fences make good neighbours." The consociative view is captured in the poem's metaphorical description of the collaborative process, not a spontaneous occurrence but an anticipated and requisite event, of annually repairing the stone fence between farm plots by joint action: "And on a day we meet to walk the line/And set the wall between us once again" (Frost, 1946: 35-36). The reciprocating process of boundary maintenance pulls the divided parties together-like a zipper. A boundary, cooperatively restored, binds as it bounds. In being jointly mended, the wall itself mends. 4. This is a result of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and, partic- ularly, the articulation therein of a "contiguous zone" of up to 12 nautical miles (beyond a 12-mile maximum "territorial sea") within which infringements of customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations pertaining to the territorial sea can be prevented or punished and also of a novel "exclusive economic zone" (EEZ) of up to 200 nautical miles. The EEZ concept gives to a state claiming such an economic zone the right to control resources both on or under the seabed and in the water column above it. This prerogative encompasses the management of all resources, protection of the marine environment, conduct of scientific research, and erection and use of artificial structures. Moreover, for some countries with the right geography, a "continental shelf" of up to 350 nautical miles also can be claimed if the submarine physical topography so justifies this (Thomas, 1999: 82-87; Sohn and Gustafson, 1984: 94-95, 113-171). 5. In particular, as Thomas predicts, the "mounting pressure for marine resource develop- ment can be expected to lead to representation of offshore boundaries on political maps." Political maps might, for example, "extend the color applied to a state's land area into the seas over which it exercises economic jurisdiction in a screen of reduced values of the same color. Whatever the method of symbolization chosen, it seems clear that in order realistically to reflect human responses to political changes around the world, future political maps will need to display a number of different kinds of 'international' boundaries-on land and in the sea" (Thomas, 1993: 1-2). 6. The term, transborder diplomacy, may be used more or less interchangeably with trans- frontier diplomacy, ignoring for present purposes subtle differences between these, in different languages and geographical contexts. Frontiere, in French, and Grenze, in German, are relatively inclusive, single terms. "Frontier" and "boundary" are contradis- tinguished by Ladis Kristof (1969), who sees a frontier as outer-oriented, directed toward outlying areas that are both a source of danger and a prize, and a boundary as inner- oriented, created and maintained by the will of a central government. The former is a manifestation of centrifugal forces, and the latter is drawn by centripetal forces. A frontier, because it is a "zone of transition" from the sphere (ecumene) of one way of life to another, is an integrating factor; and a boundary, because it impedes transitional flows between such spheres, is a separating factor. Kristof accepts the assertion of the German geopoliti- cian Karl Haushofer (1927) that boundaries are "zones of friction." 7. Victor Prescott distinguishes between territorial boundary disputes, arising from the attractiveness of a neighboring territory to the initiator of a border conflict, and positional boundary disputes, concerning the actual location of a boundary and often, as well, the terms by which that line is to be defined (Prescott, 1987: 98). In the Latin American context, the two types are often difficult to tell apart. 8. Even before this Europe-wide commitment to general principles of coexistence, cooper- ation, and comity was made, the Federal Republic of Germany, following its policy of Ostpolitik, signed treaties with some of its eastern neighbors-notably, the German Democratic Republic (1969), the Soviet Union (1970), and the People's Republic of Poland (1970)-that prepared the way for the later CSCE border-related undertakings. For example, the Draft Treaty on the Establishment of Equal Relations Between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, 17 December 1969, in its preamble acknowledges a common "endeavour to make an effective contribution to ditente and securing of peace in Europe, to remove tension between the two German 144</page><page sequence="25">HENRIKSON: Facing Across Borders states step-by-step, to bring about good neighbourly relations as equal sovereign states, and to advance the creation of a European security system" (Whetten, 1971: 218).
