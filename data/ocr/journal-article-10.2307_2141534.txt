Menosha, Wisconsin, George Banta Publishing Company, 1918. -104 pp. Under a rather suggestive title the author has given in this booklet the theories of an array of thinkers and writers who from antiquity to modern times have made use of environment (milieu) to explain social organization and institutions in their varying forms and mani- festations. The enumeration of these authors, ranging from Hippo- crates to Huntington, is somewhat indiscriminate and quite uncritical. Mr. Koller, indeed, makes no pretense to a critical study of anthropo- geography. Nevertheless, the comparatively free use of quotations from the writers mentioned offers sufficient stimulus to those who are interested in environmental interpretation of history to pursue the matter further. That the scope and sphere of human endeavor is circumscribed and conditioned by the soil, climate and all that goes to make up man's physical environment is a commonplace, the truth of which can neither be impaired by denial nor enhanced by reiteration. But anthropo-geographers in their pious zeal to discover the causa causans in the character and structure of human institutions seem to have been carried away by the obsession that mankind is a passive agent fixed "'mid this dance of plastic circumstance." Accordingly, the rise and fall of ancient civilizations and world empires as well as the rise and fall in the rate of wages of workers in a modern cloth- ing factory, are frequently accounted for by the peculiarities of the soil, sunshine and superficies surrounding the communities in question. The doctrine of geographical determinism undervalues or over- looks the important factor of what may be characterized as man's economic environment, together with the more intangible phenomena of custom, usage and the like. Mai)'s economic environment is com- monly made up of the mechanical equipment at hand and a knowl- edge of how to make use of it. This is largely a matter of intelli- gence, training and accumulated inforrmation. In other words, it is. a question of the state of the industrial arts. The influence of man's physical environment may, therefore, be modified in proportion to his control and power over the forces of nature. Moreover, the state of the industrial arts may give rise to habits of thought and behavior which further modify the physical environment. So, for example, the agrarian explanation of the fall of Rome is nothing short of an</page><page sequence="2">No. I] REVIEWS I75 exercise in futility unless the concomitant inhibitory institutional in- fluences superinduced by the state of the industrial arts are taken into account as elements contributing to the virtual paralysis of habits of industry and workmanlike endeavor on the part of the Roman people. (Cf. Salvioli, Sulla distribuzioni della proprieta f ondaria in Italia al tempo dell' impero romano). Equally futile is the explanation on similar grounds of differences in wages in the different parts of a given country. Even the single fact of the presence or absence of a well-organized body of workmen in a given industrial center is of greater importance than the character of the flora and fauna of the given locality in accounting for differences in wage rates (cf. E. Huntington, Civilization and Climate, pages 53 et seq.). To enter here upon an extended discussion and criticism of the theory of environment would be an idle enterprise, and there seems to be no call for it in a review of a booklet which is scarcely more than a catalogue of names. But purely as a question of scientific method it may not be regarded as a gratuitous observation to point out that the postulates of the geographical or climatic theory of soci- ety rest on the alluringly naive preconceptions of anthropomorphic or conjectural science.
