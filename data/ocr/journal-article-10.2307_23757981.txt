<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Maya Gold Repoussé Disc from the Petén of Guatemala Donald M. Hales Since the first gold was dredged out of the Cenote of Sacrifice at Chichén Itzá by Edward H. Thompson in 1904 (Brunhouse 1973, 185) to their eventual publication (Lothrop 1952), very little goldwork, or metalwork, is presently known from con trolled or uncontrolled excavations. The goldwork, specifically the gold dises from the Cenote of Sacrifice at Chichén Itzá date most likely to the period just after the fall of the Maya Itzá to the Toltec Xiu, and prior to the rise of Mayapan - otherwise known as the Early Postclassic period. Stylistically these dises are not in the "Classic Maya tradition", but are an amalgamation of Maya and Central Mexican (i.e., Toltec) iconography. While Lothrop grouped ten of the Chichén Itzá dises together, "because they commemorate incidents in a war between Tula-Toltec and Mayas (1952, 59)". Recent advances in the decipherment of Maya hie roglyphic writing make it now evident that those defeated or cap tured as the resuit of military conflict did not commemorate their defeat as did their conquerors (i.e., Kan-Xul of Palenque was cap tured by the people of Tonina as recorded on Tonina Monument 107; Smoke Jaguar-Paw of El Perú was captured under the auspicious of Ruler A of Tikal as recorded on Lintel 3 of Temple I at Tikal). This would suggest that the gold dises found at Chichén Itzá were in an iconographie tradition that lent itself to those other then the Maya.

Scheie has identified this other deity as "a 'Jester god,' (In Robertson 1974, 41-61).

Blood symbolism within this water-lily Dz'acab (cf. Yaxchilan Lintel 58 scepter; Robicsek 1978, Plate deity complex (metaphorically raised field agriculture) shows 239, figure 190, page 173; figures 216-217, page 190) and the An- congruency, as blood was offered by kings in auto-sacrifical cestral Tree deity as identified by Scheie (1977; cf. also Robicsek bloodletting rites (often characterized by penis perforation), and Hales 1981, Tables 17 f—i, 18; and Vessel 115). But Cross- which insured the fertility of the earth and guaranteeing the Bands, are also known in association with Jester gods (cf. Agua- abundance of agricultural crops (Joralemon, In Robertson 1974, teca Stela 7; Machaquila Stelae 3, 4, 5, 7; Seibal Stelae 10, 11; Coe 59-67; Scheie 1979, 33).

In the latter context, Chan Bahlum and his dead father Pacal, face a water-lily monster with a T 281, Kan Cross infix, from whose head arises a tree with braches of corn ears - to which blood is offered insuring the fertility of the earth. The water-lily monster, as a metaphorical symbol of the earth, makes it not surprising that the Jester god is associated with it. Ail représentations of the Jester god that have been found under controlled or uncontrolled archaeological circumstances have been of jade, in the form found in the context of royal head dresses. It is from the water-lily, or metaphorically the earth, that jade, as well as gold originates. Therefore it is not surprising that one finds the Jester god as an off-shoot or by-product of the water-lily monster, metaphorically the earth (cf. Robicsek and Haies 1981, Vessel 186; Table 3 a). Contextually on a codex-style plate, now in a private collection, a pair of Jester gods, perso nified in T 528, Cauac or stone arise from a water-lily monster (with T 1016, God C infixed within its forehead) buried deep within the open jaws or mauw of the aquatic underworld (cf. Ro bicsek and Haies 1981, Vessel 120). Originating within the contexts of an aquatic underworld envi ronment, it is not at ail unusual to learn that when one traces the Jester gods iconographie origins back to the Early Classic Maya, or even further back to the Pre-Classic Olmec, we find that the jester god was initially a fish or shark monster/deity [cf. Chalca cingo Vase (Gay 1972, Plate 23, Figure 43; Joralemon 1980, No 16); Late Pre Classic Celt (Sotheby Parke Bernet, Inc., 1982, Sale 4986, Item 83); Olmec Plaque (Bernai 1969, No 65); Jester god with bifid tail (Dickey, Muse, and Wiencek 1982, 63 - upside down); Jester god with bifid tail (Tikal Stelae 29 and 31); and Jo ralemon p.c.]. 28 As off-shoots of the water-lily monster both the jester god and the water-lily are interchangable with each other within the icon ographie context of royal head gear. Within codex-style ceramics, there is a type-theme which involves a confrontation within an aquatic environment where this substitution pattern is especially evident. The lead lord may wear either a water-lily (cf. Robicsek and Haies 1981, Vessels 94-98, 106) or it Substitute, the Jester god (cf. Robicsek and Haies 1981, Vessels 92, 93,102-105). Fig. 2: Drawing by ]. T. Haies, 1983 In addition to this substitution pattern between the water-lily and the Jester god in royal head gear, they may also appear jointly in the same context, as they are iconically the same thing (cf.
