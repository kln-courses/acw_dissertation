Ardis, Ann Arbor, I988. 226 pp. Notes. $29.50. RYSZARD PRZYBYLSKI's book has grown in fact out of three essays dating back to I966, accruing four more chapters, and amounts to one of the most strongly felt and wide-ranging critiques yet written. Przybylski has many advantages - friendship with Nadezhda Mandel'shtam, Anna Akhmatova and many of their circle, an intimate knowledge of Mandel'shtam's land- scapes and culture, an impressive command of the classics, of theology, painting, psychology, and contemporary poetry combine to make him probably the only critic whom Mandel'shtam will shake by the hand on his entry into the Elysian fields. The book has the defects of its virtues: the emotion gets out of hand, the learned discourse loses its thread, but these lapses are momentary. No work on Mandel'shtam's poetry can be comprehensive and compact: this is not a chronological survey of the best-known poems, nor a biography; it assumes a basic knowledge of the poet's life, ambience and works. Pryzybylski begins with the role of Rome, especially in Kamen', then turns to Hellenism, taking in the logos and Potebnia's linguistics in a broad and powerful sweep. After a disappointing chapter on Musica humana, he deals with the cathedral poems and their implications (with his typically euphuis- tic title, 'Stone Tablets of Anthropology') and then with the role of the 'Dying Cities' in the poet's work. Where architectonics and landscapes are involved, Przybylski is a very convincing exegetist: where questions of fate or scientific thinking arise, as in his sixth and eighth chapter, he scores more haphazardly and is often vapid. The translator and the accidents of English are responsible for the strikingly ugly alliteration of the subtitle: there is nothing objectionable in the original Wdzi4czny gos'cBoga. Generally, the translation of the Polish seems both professional and well Englished (if we pass over Gumilev 'adding his two cents worth to the conversation'). But Madeline G. Levine has chosen to translate the copious verse translations from Mandel'shtam's Russian with little apparent assistance and some horrendous (and often amusing) results: strepetgnevnyi (sic) is rendered 'angry ruffed grouse' (in Dal' strepel", grouse, is dangerously close to strepet, rustling); nebo stalo nebom, 'sky became palate', is rendered 'sky became sky', losing the anthropomorphic point made by poet and critic; pashnia becomes 'pasture', though still black. Mandel'shtam's cranes flying to foreign parts are now 'against foreign borders'. There are literally a hundred more mistakes at a basic level of incompetence: pre- positions, expressions of quantity, none of them are safe. Professor Levine blunders through all Przybylski's languages (except English and Polish) with similar effect: she has terrible difficulties with Russian adjectival endings (yj and i are regularly transposed); the frequent (and important) Greek is rarely decoded intelligibly; place names do not always regain their nominative forms; even the Italian and German are misspelt. It is a great pity that author and publisher allowed such an original and powerful (if uneven) critique to be marred by a translator's inadequacy to her task.
