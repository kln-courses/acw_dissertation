Stella Cragie explains what happened when in the interwar period, German artists came to Vietri The southern few attractive miles entrance north small town of to Salerno of the Vietri famous at lies the a few miles north of Salerno at the southern entrance to the famous 'Amalfi Coast'. Although it has produced ceramics for centuries, it is best known for the colourful 'Vietri Style' wares that emerged in the 1920s and are still produced today. A BRIEF HISTORY Vietri was originally one of a number of settlements in the area begun by the Etruscans. Founded in 800 BC, it was called Marcina. Pottery was undoubtedly made here, by the mouth of the small River Bonea, which remained the focus of production for centuries to come. The name Vietri derives from the Latin veteri(s), meaning 'old'. Glazed earthenware was introduced into Italy from the Balearics (maiolica being a corruption of Majorca) during the Arab occupation of Spain and Sicily. The technique was improved locally at the Scuola Medica Salernitana, the great medical school in Salerno which flourished in the medieval period. The albarelli (pharmacy jars) used here were made in glazed earthenware rather than in the usual terracotta, which was not impervious to liquids. In addition, several faenzere (potteries) were recorded during the medieval period. Their main products were tiles commissioned by the local monasteries, a particularly important site being the Badia - the great Benedictine monastery of the Santissima Trinità at Cava dei Tirreni, a few miles inland from Vietri. Cava dei Tirreni was a flourishing commercial centre during the Renaissance period under the Aragonese monarchs.1 Tiles with religious scenes show how Vietri absorbed the influence of the Castelli potters from the late seventeenth century. By then, maiolica wares were produced in large quantities, such as the albarelli decorated with profiles and busts of local dignitaries or members of the governing royal families, in addition to wares with landscapes, and floral or geometric motifs. Previously thought to have originated in Sicily or elsewhere in Italy, many of these have more recently been attributed to Vietri. The production of tiles, plaques, holy water stoups or albarelli in the eighteenth century was typically religious in inspiration. Secular motifs reflected Vietri's location and consisted of marine subjects such as fish and sailing ships. Some of the plaques can still be found externally on houses in Vietri and nearby Raito, where the Museo della Ceramica has been housed in the Villa Guariglia since 1992. There were influences from other local centres of production, in Cerreto Sannita and Ariano 8.

The latter used Greek forms, such as rhytons and anthropomorphic figures. However, the greatest influence on ceramic production in Vietri came from the capital, Naples. This part of Italy was governed by Spanish viceroys until 1700 - hence the deeply rooted influence of Spanish art, architecture and design - and from 1740 to 1859 (apart from the Napoleonic 'interlude') by the Bourbons. Naples was a large city, a 'melting poť of styles which over time had assimilated the influences of Faenza, Tuscany, Sicily, Liguria, other southern Italian centres as well as Spain. This was reflected in a wide range of wares produced by many different workshops. One in particular, that of Donato Massa, produced albarelli similar to those from Vietri.2 During the nineteenth century, Vietri, operating in an artistic backwater, continued with a few exceptions to produce its typical ware, similar to other small centres in the region. Her maiolica had little to offer. The naïve and simple decoration - local folklore, religious themes and motifs on tiles, jugs and plates - was overshadowed by the refinement of the terraglia earthenwares produced by the Neapolitan manufactories of Giustiniani and Del Vecchio, which flourished under the patronage of the Bourbons. THE GERMAN COLONY Even as the twentieth century began, little seemed likely to change in Vietri. Ceramic production was in the doldrums and the number of potteries was falling. Then, from the late 1920s, there was a revolution, which brought its manufactories to prominence in Italy and resulted in a prosperous trade in ceramics which was destined to last. This change came about with the arrival and establishment of a German colony, which began to form from the early 1920s. Life in southern Italy was then inexpensive and uncomplicated. Inspired by the climate, colours and myths of the Mediterranean, the new- comers could give free rein to their talents. Many German intellectuals had visited southern Italy in the nineteenth century but in the early twentieth century a number of German artists and writers settled in Vietri and in Positano, further along the Amalfi Coast. Although many left Germany after 1933 due to their opposition to National Socialism, the artists and artisans who came to the Vietri area were largely inspired by the scenery, environment and way of life. Some were Jewish, but that tended to be ignored by the Fascist authorities until the Race Laws of 1938.3 As Anna Maria Samuelli has commented, 'the suppression of all avant-garde artistic expression [...] explains the emigration of over half a million German intellectuals after 1933'. 4 She points out that Italy was not exacdy a safe haven, however, since Jews and intellectuals could expect little more than 'precarious shelter'. The astute Jewish entrepreneur Max Melamerson who set up the important Industria Ceramica Salernitana (ICS), did enjoy good relations with the regime and received important commissions. Although Jews were 'listed' and invited to leave after 1938, Melamerson stayed on. However, when Italy entered World War II in June 1940, German Jews, along with other 'foreigners', were interned. Melamerson, then aged 59, was sent to a small town in the province of Chieti in the Abruzzo region. He survived the war and returned to Vietri where he found only fragments of his valuable collection of ceramics, which had included a complete dinner service by Cantagalli and several pieces by Richard Dölker and by Guido Gambone. The Jewish artist potter Irene Kowaliska, who had studied at the School of Applied Arts in Vienna, arrived in Vietri in 1931 to work at ICS, and managed to live in Positano from 1942. She designed batik and exhibited her ceramics at fairs in Milan. In 1945, she married an Armenian writer of German nationality, Armin T. Wegner, who had taken refuge in Positano following his classification by the Nazis as a 'Bolshevik intellectual'.5 82 THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2OO7</page><page sequence="4">THE CHANGE COMES- WITH THE DONKEY An early German enterprise was the Ceramica Fontana Limite, which was set up by Günther Stüdemann. It had a short life (1924-9) and showed little innovation. A significant change in direction took place when Max Melamerson recognized the potential of taking over a small local pottery, which became the ICS. In 1927 he offered the post of artistic director to the artist and potter Richard Dölker (Fig. 1). Dölker (1896-1955) was undoubtedly the most important of the German artist potters to work in Vietri. He arrived from Germany in 1921, fresh from studying at the School of Applied Arts in Stuttgart.6 After touring Sicily (apparently on foot) he setded in Capri, but on visiting Vietri he decided to devote himself to ceramics. During his active period of 1923-33 he produced many beautiful objects. By 1927 he was well known, and his work was sold in Germany and Austria. It was in Vietri that he started making his first donkeys - the diminutive figure that was destined to become the very symbol of Vietri in later years. They quickly became popular with tourists. Other potteries in Vietri followed suit, and started to make variations of the donkey figure in large quantities. So entrenched is the donkey as a 'mascoť of Vietri today, that few local people probably realise its origin. Dölker was a religious man, and the donkey is frequently represented in Christian iconography, as well as being long associated with the peasant culture of Mediter- ranean countries. It is probably no coincidence that the mark chosen for ICS was the simple fish of the early Christians. Dölker's works during his brief ICS period were also exhibited and sold widely, and were much admired by that luminary of twentieth century Italian design, Giò Ponti. However, Dölker and Melamerson soon fell out, owing to a dispute over money, and Melamerson let him go in 1930. He was eventually offered the post of director at 1.

Dölker ťeturned to Germany just before the outbreak of war in 1939. He became a soldier and was sent to the eastern front, where he was taken prisoner by the Soviets. He survived but never fully recovered from illness, and died in 1955.7 Dölker's work8 is characterised by naive sometimes almost childish forms in strong colours with clear outlines. His favourite subjects were animals and figures, and he was strongly influenced thematically by folklore, mythology and local history. Aesthetically his work is reminiscent of the colours and designs of batik, and indeed he and several other members of the German colonies based in Vietri and further along the coast at Positano, designed and produced batik. INFLUENCES In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the new trend in ceramics was for colourful wares in simple THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2OO7 83</page><page sequence="5">2. Photograph of samples of products by ICS-Cantagalli 1936-1938. Courtesy of Pino Viscusi (published in Lo Stile Vietri tra Dölker e Gambone^ 1996, Il Sapere, Salerno, p. 171) shapes, such as the small animals by Walter Bosse in Karlsruhe, or the modernist figures and groups by seminal artists of the Wiener Werkstätte such as Susi Singer, Wally Wieseltier and Gudrun Baudisch. As Giorgio Napolitano remarks, the German period artists working in Vietri were inspired by the simple, naïve expressions of folk art, expressed in vigorous and strong forms, rather than by the refinement of Goldscheider and Lend.9 The Vietri artists had much more in common with Expressionism, where form was liberated and colour predominated. It was particularly this type of art that Hider so hated, and which he labelled entärtete Kunst (degenerate art). The sheer talent and innovation in technique and style, the rejection of Art Nouveau and the search for free uninhibited forms of plastic expression were undoubtedly an inspiration to artists like Dölker and his compatriots, who would be familiar with it. The wares produced in Vietri in the 'First German Period' reflect the spirit of early twentieth century movements, such 84 THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2OO7 as the Blaue Reiter, Die Brücke and the Bauhaus. In particular, the simple green and blue horses by Franz Marc appear a strong influence.10 Dölkers most significant compatriots were Irene Kowaliska (1905-1991) and Barbara Margarete Thewalt Hannasch (1901-1962), known as 'Bab'. The ceramics produced by the three of them showed local influences but were also inspired by the more avant-garde con- temporary German and Viennese artists, such as Max Läuger and the Wiener Werkstätte. The innovations in terms of style and decoration are still visible in the pottery produced today. Those who worked at ICS came specifically to work in the faenzere. 'Bab' Thewalt moved to Vietri in 1927 after a spell working at Cantagalli. In 1936 Cantagalli and ICS formed a joint venture, and Melamerson assigned Guido Gambone, one of Cantagalli s best artists, to oversee it. This enabled ICS to reach a much wider market.11 (Fig. 2) shows examples of wares produced by ICS- Cantagalli, including donkeys and other figures. ICS MARKETING AND PUBLICITY Vietri wares were referred to in articles written for the magazine Domus in 1929-1930, possibly by Giò Ponti, the magazine's editor and (in 1928) founder. In an anonymous article in Domus dated 5th May 1929, the writer praises Vietri wares, stating that their apparent simplicity reveals uncommon features of authenticity and originality, these characteristics being more appreciated abroad than at home.12 He goes on to mention the wide variety of Vietri objects, ranging from vases to animal figures, while regretting that the black and white images do not do justice to the vibrant colours and glazes. Ponti was on good terms with Melamerson, as Viscusi points out.13 He admired the German entrepreneur for having revived an industry in Vietri which had been at risk of disappearing. In 1932, Domus published adverts for ICS, and in 1933 the magazine illustrated domestic wares by the company.</page><page sequence="6">ICS products were sold through major outlets in Paris, such as the Boutique Italienne in Rue de Miromesnil, and the department store Rinascente in Italy in the section 'Domus Nova'. Objects were displayed at a wide range of shows and exhibitions in the 1930s, and several pieces were acquired by the Museo Artistico Industriale in Naples in 193 114. Good relations with the Fascist authorities resulted in commissions for ICS, such as a large tiled floor in Mussolini's headquarters, the Palazzo Venezia in Rome, simulating a Persian carpet. The Triennale exhibitions in Milan in 1933 and 1936 also contributed significantly to the diffusion of Vietri ceramics.15 A SYNTHESIS OF STYLES Initially, the long-established potters at Vietri considered the work of the foreign newcomers to be alien to the local ceramic tradition.16 As they were uninterested in the new ideas, it was left to the younger ones to adapt to the influences coming from the Germans. From 1928 to 1935, Guido Gambone, who became famous for his innovations in terms of design and form, was artistic director at Avallone (Industria Ceramica Avallone), which, with D'Amico, was one of the significant potteries during the 'First German Period' of 1924-1935. Gambone embraced the style of artists such as Irene Kowaliska, as can be seen in the colourful tile (Fig. 3) from 1935-36 for ICS,17 particularly in the iconography of the naïve figures of fishermen and a woman and child in a boat, both archaic and modernist in conception. However, gradually, all the Vietri potters integrated the innovations into the wares they produced, resulting in a synthesis of styles and forms. In addition to the themes the Germans brought with them as part of their cultural heritage from Northern Europe, they were very interested in local history and mythology.

It is decorated with lampblack using a sgraffito technique. A similar technique is known to have been used in Etruscan pottery. This tile would probably have been used for wall decoration, given its size (19 X 19 cm). The subject is Taras, mythical hero and son of Poseidon, after whom the ancient town of Taranto in Apulia ( Tarentum in Latin) was named. The German artists rediscovered the myth of the siren, explored early civilizations such as those of the Etruscans, Greeks and Romans, and used forms which had been current for centuries: plates, bowls, jugs, vases, tiles and figures. In this simple but sophisticated design, Dölker brings together two themes close to his heart: mythology and fish. He was a friend of Dohrn, the Director of the Stazione Zoologica in Naples, which contained a large aquarium. Similar tiles are illustrated in Viscusi showing figures of St George and the Dragon, and Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, using the same decorative incised technique of black on a white ground. The beautiful plate with an odalisque and an Eastern palace in the background (Fig. 5) shows how varied the influences were in Dölkers work. He almost certainly designed this piece, while it was probably decorated by Margarete Thewalt around 1927-28. His figures, such as Christian or mythological heroes, share an imposing and stately form, expressing dignity and solemnity, while his animals are jocular and sometimes grotesque representations. ICONOGRAPHY The inspiration for many decorations was the locality and its industries - fishing and farming, since Vietri is a small town by the sea. Other forms used were birds, deer, donkeys and sea- monsters. The influence of baroque and eighteenth century iconography can also be seen in religious subjects and themes: angels, Biblical stories such as Jonah and the Whale, the Three Marys, St Christopher, the Flight into Egypt, and the Christmas Crib figures designed by Bab Thewalt. Like Dölker, Thewalt was also inspired by classical iconography: the large plate with the 86 THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2OO7</page><page sequence="8">initials MH (the "H" is for Hannasch, her married name) made around 1929-31 (Fig. 6) shows an archaic robed figure with amphorae and a scaly fish. The composition is simple yet highly decorative, and is complemented by the attractive border. The yellow circle round the figure's head suggests a saint, or possibly Christ, and may symbolise a miracle.18 Flowers were also a common motif in earlier pottery, as was the sun - a primeval symbol of fertility and prosperity. Figures of peasants working in the fields, shepherds, fishermen, sailors and subjects from mythology and history, such as Roman soldiers in a chariot, the hunting goddess Diana, and Pan underline how wide a range of themes was used, and the sheer inventiveness of the artists. THE SECOND GERMAN PERIOD The Second German Period, broadly speaking from the late 1930s to the 1950s, saw the establishment of a number of successful manu- factories, including Vincenzo Pinto (where Irene Kowaliska worked), La Faenzerella (Guido Gambone's pottery, 1945-1950), Solimene (founded in 1954, with an eccentric building designed by Paolo Soleri), and ICAV Giordano (also established in the 1950s). Modernism was the strong influence. After the difficult war and post-war periods, production increased owing to the benefits brought by mechanization. Work had been done manually before then (Fig. 7, an ICS potter). In addition to Gambone, other potters who produced innovative designs were Amerigo Tot (a Hungarian who directed Pinto from 1948 to 1952 and had connections with the Bauhaus), the Procida brothers and Giovannino Carrano. The artists tended to move from one pottery to another, thus spreading their ideas and styles. Ceramics production has continued apace since the 1950s. There are still many potteries in Vietri and along the Amalfi Coast, catering for a vast tourist market. 7. Photograph of an ICS potter at the wheel . Courtesy of Pino Viscusi (published in Lo Stile Vietri tra Dölker e Gambone, 1996, Il Sapere, Salerno, p.93) TECHNICAL DETAILS The clay used by the potters from Vietri usually came from nearby Ogliara. Until the Fifties, it was often brought to Vietri by donkey. In Vietri an ivory-grey semi-transparent glaze was obtained with a marble-like lustre, the constituents of the glaze being silica and oxides of tin and lead. These glazes continued to be used during the German period, until Guido Gambone introduced a crystalline and crackled glaze (widely copied in the 1950s and 1960s), possibly inspired by Théodore Deck and high-fired Islamic and Asian glazes. These new glazes were made possible by more sophis- ticated methods of firing and production. Gambone was particularly influenced by Max Läuger. In the early twentieth century Vietri potters were still using traditional firing techniques, unlike contemporaries such as Richard Ginori (which produced Giò Pond's designs) where more modern processes were on an industrial scale. The whole Vietri concept of 'back to basics' or 'back to Nature' in terms of themes, forms and design ran counter to the trend elsewhere, where Lend, Sandro Vacchetti (Essevi) and Goldscheider THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 200J Sj</page><page sequence="9">11.

(opposite below) Negro figure (ICAV Giordano ), private collection produced sophisticated designs of predominantly female figures in the latest fashions engaged in leisure activities such as skiing or in appealing and sexy poses. In Vietri, the simplification of style and the revival of traditional themes and techniques amount to an almost 'Morrisian' attitude to production, with simple age-old techniques in small family-run potteries. The colours typical of the German period were brown (manganese), green (copper), yellow and orange (iron oxide and antimony) and blue (cobalt). Some pigments were bought in, though most were prepared by hand. The final colour depended largely on the glaze composition. The light to brilliant green, typical of Vietri pottery produced by copper had been used traditionally on borders of plates and dishes.19 An interesting innovation was the intro- duction of the black ground by Dölker, seen on 8. Etruscan figure (Pinto Vietri ), private collection plaques and tiles produced by ICS, which sometimes symbolized night, as can be seen from the inclusion of the moon and stars. THE ETRUSCAN FEMALE The female figure (Fig. 8) made by an unknown artist working at the faenzera of Don Vincenzo Pinto is a classic example of the different influences converging in twentieth century pottery in Vietri. A Pinto pottery is recorded in Vietri as early as the seventeenth century. Both Irene Kowaliska and Bab Thewalt fired their wares using Pinto's kilns, and subsequently worked there for a short period. The female figure illustrated was acquired relatively recently and bore an old paper label with the handwritten inscription 'Eine Etruskerin'. It was probably made some time between 1935 and 1955. The label suggests a German period potter, but it could simply have been applied by a German tourist who had bought it. The shape is inspired by Greek icon- ography: a female figure holding a platter on her head, formed as a sconce to hold a candle. Viscusi shows catalogue sketches of anthro- pomorphic candle-holders of classical inspira- tion, including a man on horseback ( Reiterleuchter ), a fish ( Fischleuchter ) and a man ( Männchenleuchter ), all designed by Thewalt. In the Pinto figure the decoration of the skirt, the use of lilac, orange, geometric shapes and a crystalline glaze would suggest a date of around 1950, though the shape itself and function are age-old. A vase by Pinto20 made in 1936-38 shows a couple of peasants dancing a tarantella in colourful traditional costumes on a black ground. The woman's arms are raised in the same way as in Fig. 8, and the bell-shaped skirt is identical in form. In about 1940, Gaetano Ravechon designed a plate for V. Pinto which showed two female busts, the women carrying jars on their heads and the arm of the woman in the foreground raised to support the jar. It had a zig-zag border motif, similar to the skirt pattern in Fig. 8. 88 THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2OO7</page><page sequence="10">A NEGRO FIGURE The figure of the Negro (Fig. 9), naked except for a loincloth and jewellery, can be dated to about 1950, and is marked for ICAV (Industria Ceramica Artistica di Vietri) Giordano, another faenzera operating in Vietri. Heavily stylized- almost a caricature, with its exaggerated features and wild-eyed look, today it seems politically incorrect. However it shows the influence of African art, which was common- place in Italy in the early post-war period. This piece was exhibited in Naples at an exhibition of Art Deco and modernist ceramics in the 1980s. Made as an applique , to be hung on the wall, the colours are at least attractive: a warm chocolate brown, enlivened by the classic Vietri green, the bright blue and yellow of the bangles, and the turquoise loincloth. The modelling of the hair, loincloth, arms and hands is vigorous and very expressive. The tactile form and powerful iconography, typical of early post-war production in Vietri, show the development of modelling techniques since the German period. The pose of this particular figure is reminiscent of a Wiener Werkstätte female figure by Gudrun Baudisch21 (1926-27) of a kneeling woman virtually naked except for a cloth, wearing a wide round necklace and balancing two large bowls to the left and right. PEASANT FIGURES A black ground tile (Fig. 10) exhibits similar iconography to that used by Irene Kowaliska, and to the decorative style of Giovannino Carrano who worked for Ceramica Solimene from the mid Fifties to the Sixties. Carrano designed a plate which used the same black ground and scattered images evoking the peasant environment such as shepherds, animals, a traditional Moorish-style house, vegetation and pots. The black ground and stars are indicative of night. The tile is marked for D'ASS, an unknown pottery where, again, Dölker and several other Germans worked from 1930. THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2OO7 89</page><page sequence="11">A DONKEY A BREATH OF FRESH AIR The donkey has appeared in countless versions since the late 1920s and is still produced today. The figures produced by Dölker were usually small, while Fig. 1 1 shows a rare large animal. It was made by De Marinis, one of the more recently established potteries in Vietri, and exhibits the traditional green colour. This image is particularly pleasing, with a colourful harness and the almost laughing expression as the donkey bares his teeth to bray. Figures on this scale and of this quality are rare. This one was probably made in the 1960s. The other green donkey (Fig. 12) is smaller, more stylised in form, and is typical of 1950s or 1960s modernism. It may not have the same quality and depth of expression as its larger companion, but it is still a decorative and appealing object. 12. Small donkey (unmarked), private collection. The Museo della Ceramica di Vietri, which contains a number of objects from the German period, is run by the museum service of the Province of Salerno. It has an excellent collection of ceramics from Vietri covering centuries of production. The website22 of the Salerno museum service contains a Virtual collection' of exhibits, which provides an overview of production. Private collections of Vietri style ceramics are mostly to be found in the Salerno and Naples area, though there is interest in the USA, and objects are bought and sold regularly on the Internet. The ground-breaking contribution of the seminal German artists to the history of twentieth century ceramic production in an area distant from their homeland, both geographically and culturally, illustrates how a 'breath of fresh air' can open a whole new chapter in the decorative arts.
