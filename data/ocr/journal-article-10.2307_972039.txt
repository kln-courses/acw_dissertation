<plain_text><page sequence="1">320 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 10, No. 3, 1999] acknowledged as such and published in the spirit of pro- voking further examination and discourse on this cryptic material. The authors are to be commended for venturing forward and attempting to analyze this document in a holis- tic manner through the consideration of groups of the- matically related almanacs. Images, glyphically-recorded actions, and dates are considered together as part of the entire package of information presented in each almanac. In addition to offering possible interpretations of the patterns observed in the almanacs, the authors also have compiled many tables of empirical data, including series of dates and lists of actions represented in the hiero- glyphic record. Systematic, page-by-page descriptions of these almanacs provided in the chapters by Christopher von Nagy, Gabrielle Vail, Cassandra Bill, and Donald Graff are useful commentaries that can be used by the reader as a translation and guide through sections of the codex. Bill, Graff and Victoria Bricker also rally new information to support the widely held view that the codex dates to the latter half of the Postclassic period (A.D. 100W1500). This date range is derived from sea- sonality data reflected on deer images combined with astronomical references and the chronology of ceramic vessels used in the codices. Although most of the information in this volume is highly specialized and fully understandable only to schol- ars familiar with Maya epigraphy, calendrics, and astron- omy, the chapters also present observations about ritual practice that are of interest to other Maya scholars. Bricker's introductory chapter provides a solid framework of information on Maya calendrics and the codices that will help uninitiated readers make sense of this material. Von Nagy and Bill discuss rituals of deer hunting and deer trapping represented in the images of the codices, and relate these to practices documented inYucatec ethnogra- phy and ethnohistory. Graff's treatment of the manufac- ture of ceramic vessels within the codices is interesting, although it is primarily geared toward assessing the chronology of these vessels. He suggests that some of the anthropomorphic figures who stand in front of ceramic ves- sels may be analogous to the Chen Mul style Postclassic effigy censers that are commonly found archaeologically. Specific chapters of the volume cover a range of top- ics. Bricker's introduction describes aspects of the tzolkin and haab calendrical stations; burner ceremonies; astro- nomical markers for the tropical year; the layout, reading order, and structure of the almanacs; and includes a dis- cussion of gods and people in the images of the Madrid Codex. In chapter 2, Von Nagy describes almanacs that pertain to deer hunting and deer trapping, and attempts to organize these into calendrical, iconographic, or textually related groups. Vail elaborates on this theme in chapter 3, which specifically examines deer trapping almanacs in relation to astronomical events associated with Scorpio and Virgo. She suggests a possible identification of deer in celestial positions in the codex as the constellation Virgo. Astronomical data and seasonal data gleaned from deer imagery lead Vail to propose that deer-trapping almanacs refer to rituals occurring in the spring (February to May) and scorpion almanacs refer to rituals occurring in late May. In chapter 4, Bill explores almanacs that portray God M. She notes that the themes of hunting and warfare are associated with this deity in addition to its more tradi- tionally accepted role as a merchant deity, although these roles are not mutually exclusive. Graff (chapter 5) uses cal- endric and iconographic information to propose that one section of the codex was used in the fifteenth century. He also provides additional useful descriptions of almanacs within this section. The concluding chapter by Bricker proposes that a central calendar-round almanac in this codex was an index to the entire document. The diversity of the activities portrayed in the almanac and its encom- passing calendrical structure suggest to Bricker that it was intended to serve as a key to the codex's organization, and she describes specific links between this central section and other sections of the manuscript. Papers on the Madrid Codex is an important reference for understanding this difficult indigenous document. The authors extract fresh insights on Postclassic Maya cos- mology, calendrics, ritual practice, and subsistence cycles from the texts and images of the Madrid Codex. This vol- ume will be pivotal for future work on this codex and stud- ies of Postclassic Maya ritual. Arqueoictiofauna mexicana. OSCAR J. POLACO and ANA FABIOLA GUZMAN. Coleccion Cientdica, Vol. 352.

Zooarchaeology and environmental archaeology have reached an important stage in the process of archaeologi- cal globalization. Study of the complex relationship between ancient peoples and their environments requires a broad comparative database, yet the compilation of such information is hindered by the variable availability of lit- erature from different study areas. This is particularly true in the Americas, where the database for research carried out in North America far surpasses that available in Cen- tral and South America. Much of the archaeological research in Latin America has been done by foreign insti- tutions, whichfurtherhampers comparative analysis; pub- lications from within the region are not accessible to the wider audience, while foreign publications are often not available to local archaeologists.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES 321 Arqueoictiofauna mexicana addresses this important issue by providing a comprehensive Spanish-language review of the available literature on Mexican archaeoichthyofauna the archaeological remains of Mex- ican fishes. In this thorough analysis of the archaeologi- cal (and sometimes biological) literature, the authors present information on the distribution of archaeological Mexican ichthyofauna. They also describe the extent of the information recorded in the literature and the limita- tions imposed on the zooarchaeological analysis by spe- cific conditions of the Mexican environment and the history of Mexican archaeology. The authors tabulate information from the literature and discuss it with reference to biological data, archaeologi- cal context, and derived interpretations. Their observa- tions are not intended to add to the theoretical basis of the science of zooarchaeology, but rather to provide an inter- nal review of the current status of archaeoichthyological studies in Mexico. The discussions are descriptive, and evaluations of the available resources are based on numer- ical analyses derived from a dataset that is presented in a series of detailed tables and maps. The authors do not pro- vide an extensive compilation of the comparative infor- mation itself, presenting instead a list of its availability in the literature. Although this limits somewhat the useful- ness of the analysis, the authors have catalogued the diver- sity of types of information available, and by so doing, have increased the ease with which future researchers can access the data. Polaco and Guzman begin by discussing the distribu- tion of archaeological fish remains across Mexico and the types of archaeoichthyological research reported in the lit- erature. From this information, they analyze the possible ancient uses of Mexican fishes. However, it is the next sec- tion, a review of the limitations to Mexican archaeoichthy- ology, that is of most general utility to zooarchaeologists working both within and outside Mexico. Here the authors detail some of the difficulties specific to Central Ameri- can zooarchaeology, and especially to the analysis of fish remains in this area. These range from generalized prob- lems faced by all zooarchaeologists (including the still- widespread lack of recognition of archaeofaunal data as a source of cultural information) to the specific problems of the humid tropics. Although Polaco and Guzman do not directly discuss taphonomic variability, Mexico is char- acterized by great environmental heterogeneity, with the result that preservational conditions range from superb, in the dry highlands, to extremely poor, in the humid low- lands. Fish remains, so susceptible to deterioration, have therefore been variably preserved across the Mexican land- scape, as they are across Central America as a whole. Zooarchaeologists working in Mexico also face sig- nificant biases caused by variable excavation foci and methods. A traditional emphasis on elite and monumen- tal construction has been slow to change in Latin Ameri- can archaeology, and only recently have domestic contexts become the focus of archaeological attention. Polaco and Guzman also note that, until recently, Mexican archaeol- ogy was characterized by rapid and extensive excavation methods which prevented the recovery of large quantities of fish remains in clear archaeological contexts. Through- out Central America, the differing recovery and analysis methods used over almost two centuries of research have led to a lack of comparability among archaeological col- lections and the identifications and quantifications of zooarchaeological remains reported in the literature. This is particularly evident in the analysis of fish remains, char- acteristically difficult both to recover archaeologically and identify without specialized comparative collections. The authors note that only one-third of the recovered fish fauna are identified to species, and that few taxa are reportedly widespread in distribution across ancient Mexico. This distribution may be less a result of the ancient patterns of use suggested by the authors, than of the variable recog- nition of diagnostic elements. For example, shark teeth and ray spines are highly identifiable even by the nonspecial- ist, and their wide distribution may be more a character- istic of their recognizability than their greater ubiquity relative to other species. The body of the work is followed by four appendices, two of which are particularly valuable resources for any researcher interested in Mexican icthyofauna. One is a brief guide to the osteological comparative collections in Mexico, listing both the collection holdings (including such details as the existence of fish scales, otoliths, and stomach contents) and the personnel in charge of the col- lections. Polaco and Guzman correctly suggest that these collections are vital to the accurate analysis of zooar- chaeological assemblages, and that more detailed biolog- ical information must accompany the skeletal materials than often is currently available. Although many collec- tions do contain information on the date and location of capture, other details, such as specimen sex, live weight, and season of capture, are generally unavailable. It is just such information that provides the basis for our most sophisticated analyses. The other interesting addition is an annotated bibliography of literature on the osteology of the fishes of Mexico. This bibliography is not exhaustive, nor is it meant to be. But it will be an important resource for zooarchaeologists searching for information on spe- X CltlC SpeCleS. Polaco and Guzman suggest that periodic internal review and evaluation are vital to every discipline. This volume addresses that need in the field of zooarchaeology in Mexico by providing a detailed discussion of a broad and dispersed published record. As the world of archaeo- logical investigation grows smaller, it is vital that basic data like that presented here be available to researchers world-</page><page sequence="3">322 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 10, No 3, 1999] wide. For researchers specifically interested in ancient fish fauna of Mexico, this work is a welcome and needed ref- erence. Maya Stone Tools of Dzibilchaltun, Yucatan, and Becan and Chicanna, Campeche. IRWIN ROVNER and SUZANNE LEWENSTEIN. Middle American Research Institute Publications Vol.65. Middle American Research Institute, Tulane University, New Orleans,1997. xii + 188 pp., 37 illustrations, 57 tables, bibliography, index, with an appendix by Fred W. Nelson Jr. $42.00 (cloth). Reviewed by Thomas R. Hester, University of Texas- Austin. Rovner's 1975 doctoral dissertation (University of Wis- consin-Madison) was a landmark in the development of Maya lithic studies. At the time his research was done in the early 1970s, chipped stone tools had been largely ignored by Mayanists. Notable exceptions included A. V. Kidder and Gordon Willey, who had published excellent site- or region-specific descriptions and illustrations. Rovner's dissertation provided an examination of entire lithic assemblages (or at least, lithic assemblages that he was given, as he had no control over what had been col- lected in the field) and he then used the lithics, from Dzi- bilchaltun and the Rio Bec zone, to explore typological concepts and to place the lithic forms into a culture-his- torical framework. Next, Rovner published some papers derived, at least in part, from the dissertation, in Maya Lithic Studies (edited by Hester and Hammond, 1976), in the Revista Mexicana de Estudios Antropologicos (vol. 27, no. 2, 1981), and in Lithic Technology (vol. 9, no. 1, 1980). In 1989, a slightly revised version of the original dissertation was submitted to the Middle American Research Institute (MARI). This version was not signifi- cantly different from the dissertation and contained scant reference to the advances made in Maya lithic research (and a much expanded literature) since 1975. In spite of the dated nature of this work, the MARI was committed to the publication of the full manuscript, as it reported important aspects of its research programs in the Yucatan in the early 1970s. Rovner, while continuing an interest in obsidian studies, has focused more on phytolith analysis during his years at North Carolina State Univer- sity. It was fortunate, therefore, that MARI was able, in 1990, to engage the assistance of Suzanne Lewenstein to revise, reorganize, and update his manuscript. This has led to a publication that is not simply a sidebar in the history of Maya lithic research, but one that is important for con- temporary Mesoamerican lithicists. Lewenstein's intro- duction sets the Rovner dissertation into context and provides a brief history of Maya lithic studies. Her subse- quent discussion of the descriptive systems used in the study serves as apreface to the body of the volume in which Rovner's descriptive data from Dzibilchaltun and Rio Bec (incorporating Becan and Chicanna) are presented. Here too, Lewenstein has tned to make the descriptive materi- als current by citing and discussing the many studies of Maya lithics published in the last two decades. Lewenstein is burdened, however, by a now-antiquated descriptive-functional terminology that is, for the most part, difficult to use in terms of broad regional compar- isons. She makes a valiant effort to revise Rovner's biface typology and devise one that is more quantitatively-based. But, any such typologies are fraught with danger in Maya lithics, as celt or axe biface forms have to be evaluated on a regional basis, taking into consideration the available raw material, the function(s) of the tools, modes of resharpen- ing, and local recycling. Lewenstein also provides a use- ful overview of the typological sequence of Maya points and "knives" as a preface to Rovner's descriptions of such artifacts from the three sites. She prepared Figure 18 to provide an illustrated projectile point and "knife" chronol- ogy for the Maya lowlands. It borrows heavily from the Colha lithic sequence originally published in 1980. Unfor- tunately, that earlier sequence led Lewenstein to lump the Early and Middle Postclassic lithic diagnostics together. The Colha Project had initially recognized an "early facet" side-notched dart point form, followed by a "late facet" lenticular or lozenge-shaped form. Fred Valdez's refined chronological distinctions made for Colha Postclassic ceramics in his 1987 Harvard doctoral dissertation helped demonstrate that the side-notched forms are Early Post- classic in date and the lozenge/lenticular, Middle Post- classic. Lewenstein's efforts to put the lithic data into a more useful form is not aided by the poor quality of the photographs, some of which are too dark or much too light. This was beyond her control, as the illustrations had to be obtained from the original dissertation microfilm. It is a wonder that they turned out as well as they did! The next part of Rovner's study deals with the obsid- ian industIy. Again, it is usefully brought up to date by Lewenstein, especially in terms of his descriptions of core- blade technology, "trade intensity indexes," and trace ele- ment analyses. Regarding the latter, Rovner used proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) in the early 1970s (for the Rio Bec materials). In an appendix to the present volume, Fred Nelson uses X-ray fluorescence to analyze Dzibilchaltun obsidian (and specimens from two other sites) for source identification. Lewenstein summarizes the Rio Bec obsidian source databased on Rovner's analy- ses, and while El Chayal is dominant (especially in the Early Classic), the usual cast of Guatemalan and Mexico sources also are represented. A very admirable aspect of Rovner's original lithic analysis was his detailed treat- ment, and abundant illustrations, of ground-stone. A</page></plain_text>
