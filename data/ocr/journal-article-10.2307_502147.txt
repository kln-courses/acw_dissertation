<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cycladic Objects in the Fogg and Farland Collections PATRICIA G. PREZIOSI PLATES 27-32 The purpose of this paper is to provide a de- tailed description of the ten Early Cycladic ob- jects of stone in the collections of the Fogg Art Museum and of Mr. Leo Farland of New York City.' In doing so I wish to make these particular pieces more widely known and to offer a model for the descriptive publication of such works in general. The study of Early Cycladic sculpture is beset with many difficulties. Because comparatively few figurines and stone vessels have come to light as the result of systematic excavation, a chronological sequence of sculptural types cannot yet be de- termined. The provenience and context of dis- covery of a great many objects are unknown, with the result that the prospects of determining the stylistic development of the sculptures, the location of the centers of their manufacture, and their pre- cise function, seem at present rather dim.2 How- ever, a detailed comprehensive publication of all that is known about extant objects could do much to alleviate the situation.3 Such a publication should also help to provide a clearer picture of the commercial, social, and artistic relationships existing during the Early Bronze Age among the Cyclades, and between these islands and other parts of the Aegean area where Cycladic idols and idols of related types have been found.4 From a comprehensive study of the figurines the islands would probably emerge as distinctly individualistic in matters of sculptural types and styles (as they seem to have been in his- toric periods).' One would perhaps be able to 1I wish to thank the Fogg Art Museum and Mr. Leo Far- land for permission to publish the Cycladic objects in their collections. I am also grateful to Mr. C. Vermeule for pro- viding the photograph of the Boston idol, and to Mrs. E. T. Vermeule for helpful suggestions. 2 See, e.g., Early Art in Greece: the Cycladic, Minoan, My- cenaean, and Geometric Periods (catalogue of an exhibition at the Andre Emmerich Gallery; May 7-June 11, 1965) nos. 2-28, 140. Not a single provenience is given for the twenty- eight marble figurines in this exhibition. 3 To date very few pieces have been published adequately; a great many have not been published at all. C. Zervos' L'Art des Cyclades (Paris 1957), although a valuable addition to the bibliography, is neither comprehensive nor detailed, and in a few cases only illustrates rear and profile views.

There are also several unpub- lished pieces in the study collection of the Heraklion Museum. 5 It is possible, for instance, that the workshops of one island or a small group of islands in contact with each other produced a group of idols, many examples of which have been found on Syros. These are fairly flat figurines, rarely ex- ceeding 3ocm. in length, which belong to two very closely related types: one squat (e.g. Zervos op.cit. [supra n. 3] figs. 245, 248, 249), the other somewhat more elongated (e.g. Zervos, figs. 244, 247, 251). They have in common a head of triangular shape, often with a large rounded nose high on the face; broad, angular or squared shoulders; elbows which protrude from the sides of the body; a shallow vertical incision which separates the stiffly held legs and intersects the apex of the pubic V or triangle. In the squat variety the abdo- men is obscured by the folded arms which rest on top of the pubic area as defined by an incised V. In the more elongated type there is a space between the arms and the pubic area which is marked by a full triangle. The island (or islands) which produced these figures has not been identified. The marble of many of the Syriote examples is said to be Parian, and several idols of the squat type have been found on Paros (e.g. a figurine in the Fogg Museum, no. 1960.447: see no. 4 infra and AIA 59 [19551 19 and pl. 11, fig. Ib; another in Toronto [Bulletin of the Royal Ontario Museum of Archae- ology, Jan. 1930; 1-2] and a fragmentary figure in the Paros Museum). Idols of the squat and elongated types have, how- ever, also been found on Amorgos (e.g. Athens nos. 4722, 4723: Thimme op.cit. [supra n. 3] pl. 21: I,2; Florence, Museo Archeologico no. 4335; and an idol said to be from Amorgos in the collection of Alistair B. Martin: D. von Bothmer, Ancient Art from New York Private Collections</page><page sequence="2">106 PATRICIA G. PREZIOSI [AJA 70 speak with some authority of Naxian, Parian, or Amorgenetan idols rather than be compelled always to use the generic designation Cycladic idols. Skill in recognizing in particular works the peculiar manner of individual craftsmen or work- shops might result, as well as the ability to trace the development of such artists and island schools in their representations of the human form. It might also be found that there were relatively few artisans at work in the Early Bronze Age Cyclades; that each community or cluster of settlements had in each generation only one or two men whose spe- cialized work it was to manufacture marble ob- jects for cult and funeral use (just as today on the islands each village has its own marble worker who furnishes his fellows with gravestones and marble crosses, training his son or an apprentice to follow him in the profession.6 Through systematic study surmises such as these could conceivably be shown to be facts, and the problems of chronology, typology, provenience, and function brought nearer to solution. We turn now to the Fogg and Farland Collec- tions which, although small, contain an interesting variety of sculptural types. I have thought it best to study the two collections as one and to treat the individual objects in order of their increasing naturalism. I do not wish to imply that this se- quence is necessarily chronological as well. i. A schematic idol in the Farland Collection (pl. 27, figs. 1-2) Preservation: The figure is complete except for the right leg which is missing from about the knee. The break appears to be recent. A break (recent) at the neck has been mended. The front surface is well preserved; the back is somewhat encrusted. Material: Naxian marble? Provenience: Naxos. Dimensions: Length o.xom. Maximum width o.o038m. Maximum thickness ca. o.oo8m. This small idol is an example of the flat sche- matic type of female figure in which there is an almost total absence of modeling and a reduction of the body forms to a simple minimum. The neck and body are set back very slightly from the face which is flat. None of the facial features are indicated. The top of the head is straight and flat. The back and front of the figure are virtually identical when viewed head-on except for the slight indentation of the neck under the chin and the lightly incised pubic triangle on the front surface. When viewed in profile, however, there is a subtle differentiation of volumes. It is possible to distinguish such features as the frontal swell of the thighs, the backward bulge of the calves, and a very slight curvature of the back. The arms are indicated in schematic fashion by pointed protuberances at the sides of the figure. The legs are separated by a groove which extends to about the knees, at which point the legs become entirely separate. The one surviving leg ends ab- ruptly; the foot is not defined. This type of small idol with atrophied arms and feet is quite common among the Naxian finds7 (and derives perhaps from a more amorphous type also found on the island).s The Farland figurine resembles quite closely several examples of the type.' The type was, however, not confined to Naxos, for several examples (made of marble and shell) have been found on Paros, Antiparos, and Amor- gos.1? [New York 1961] no. 89, pl. 29), los (e.g. Athens no. 3916: Zervos op.cit. [supra n. 3] fig. 115), and Naxos (e.g. Naxos Museum no. 2oo; and an idol in the Louvre: Zervos op.cit. [supra n. 31 ] fig. 158). One cannot, nevertheless, rule out the possibility that these idols represent a phase-perhaps late--in the chronological development of Early Cycladic sculpture, rather than the individual approach of a few craftsmen. (See Kunstwerke der Antike, Auktion XXVI, Miinzen und Me- daillen A.G. [Basel 19631 90-91, no. 171.) 6 From the material assembled by Zervos we can begin to observe that this practice was followed. He reproduces, for example, photographs of five idols found in the necropolis of Spedos on the east coast of Naxos (op.cit. [supra n. 3] 23 and figs. 108, 113-115, 175). Four of these are so similar in basic design, proportions, and incised details as to make it seem very likely that they were produced by a single craftsman. Cf. G. A. Papathanasopoulos, "Kykladiki. Nixou," Deltion 17 (1961-62) 115. 7C. Stephanos, "Les tombeaux premyceniens de Naxos," Comptes Rendus du Congres International d'Archdologie (Athens 19o5) 222; fig. on p. 218. See also C. Stephanos in Praktika (1904) 58, 6o. He found a group of seven such figures standing in a seashell, and maintained that idols of this type were "destin&amp;es ' une station verticale." See also Papathanasopoulos op.cit. (supra n. 6) 136-137; pl. 70; and Zervos op.cit. (supra n. 3) fig. 42. For other idols of the same type from Naxos see, H. T. Bossert, Altkreta (Berlin 1923) fig. 12; K. G. Fiedler, Reise durch alle Theile des Kdnigreiches Griechenland (Leipzig 1841) II, pl. 5: 2. 8 Zervos op.cit.

A flat idol in the Fogg Museum, i960.455 (pl. 28, figs. 3-5) Preservation: The figure is complete except for part of the neck and the head." The break at the neck appears to be old. The surface is heavily en- crusted and the incised details are almost entirely obscured. Material: Limestone, or marble of poor quality. Provenience: Unknown (but presumably not one of the "marble" islands such as Naxos or Paros). Dimensions: Preserved length o.o99m. Maxi- mum width o.o042m. Maximum thickness ca. O.oI2m. This figure has been described as being of "vio- lin shape,"'" but it does not closely resemble idols commonly designated by this term.*3 The latter are normally distinguished by the absence of legs, be- ing rounded or squared at the lower extremity. The Fogg piece, although very flat like the fiddle idols, does have legs, albeit of a rudimentary sort. More- over, unlike the idols of violin shape, this figure may once have carried a head. From the drawing (pl. 28, fig. 4) one may observe that the arms of the Fogg idol are roughly indicated by a horizontal groove as being held across the front of the body. The back of this piece is without contour, and the only detail rendered is the incision which separates the legs as in front. 3. A flat head in the Fogg Museum, i96o.453 (pl. 28, figs. 6-8) Preservation: The body and part of the neck are missing. The surface is worn and lightly encrusted. Material: Limestone? Provenience: Unknown (but presumably not one of the "marble" islands). Dimensions: Preserved length o.o49m. Length of face o.o4om. Maximum width o.028m. This unusually rectangular head exhibits very flat contours both in front and in back. There is no accentuation or backward tilt of the crown, but (when viewed from the side) a gradual reduction in thickness toward the top may be observed. The head passes into the neck at the back without the usual curve. The neck also shows an absence of rounding. In front the neck is set back from the face, giving the piece a shallow chin. To judge from the shape of the head and the fact that the head and neck are in the same plane, it is possible that the body of this idol was of a flat schematic or amor- phous type."4 The closest parallels for this head form are to be found in two marble idols from Aghios Kosmas.5 The heads of these figurines exhibit the same lack of contour and a similar tapering at the top. The Aghios Kosmas heads terminate in abstract bodies and seem "to be a combination of the amorphous and the anthropomorphic Cycladic types."'" Idols of this general type are known from both the Greek mainland and the Cyclades."7 The facial markings of the Fogg head include: I) a nearly rectangular nose in low relief; 2) eyes indicated by two straight, narrow depressions (which are only barely visible on the photograph); and 3) a mouth in the form of a straight incision. Incised eyes and mouths, although not normal in Cycladic sculpture (on which it has been pre- sumed that facial details were rendered by means of pigment),'8 are nevertheless well attested. Sculp- turally indicated facial features are found both on the more developed type of figurine and on the schematic.'9 L. Budde and R.

[supra n. io] pl. 2: A26) and on an idol of a more schematic form from Siphnos in Athens (Zervos op.cit.

PREZIOSI [AJA 70 The particular form of the slit features may pro- vide a clue for an understanding of sepulchral figu- rines in general. These slits appear to be attempts on the part of artists to indicate that the eyes and mouths of their subjects were sealed in sleep or death.20 Whether one sees in the female idols representations of members of the deceased's fam- ily or household, or representations of the Great Goddess in her chthonic aspect as guardian and ruler of the dead, it seems fitting that the figures be depicted as passing through a symbolic and sympathetic sleep of death beside the corpse on its journey to the other world. The idols were perhaps thought of as coming to life in the realm beyond to perform their functions, whether domestic or divine.21 4. A squat idol in the Fogg Museum, i960.447 (pl. 29, fig. 9).22 Preservation: The figure is complete. A break at the base of the neck has been mended. The surface is very well preserved in front (except for slight encrustation on the right side of the face and neck), but the back is covered with a thick layer of lime deposit. Material: Parian marble? Provenience: Paros. Dimensions: Length o.i i7m. Maximum width 0o.o052m. The heavy encrustation indicates most probably that the figure was laid in a horizontal position in the grave, its back resting on the floor, where faulty drainage subsequently caused the disfigura- tion. This may be taken as further evidence in sup- port of the statement that the being represented in the idols was portrayed in a state of sleep or death beside the corpse.23 The Fogg piece has already been mentioned ir the introductory discussion of the squat type. It differs from the characteristic examples of this type in two respects: I) the very close-placed breasts, and 2) the slightly upraised left arm."4 The back of the Fogg idol and the incised details thereon are typical. One may compare them, for instance, to those of the figurine in Boston (6i.- Io89) although the details on the latter are some- what more roughly executed24a (pl. 29, fig. io). 5. An idol of developed type in the Farland Col- lection (ex Ribot Collection) (pl. 30, figs. 11-13) Preservation: The figure is complete except for the legs which are missing from about the knees. The break appears to be recent. A break (recent) at the neck has been mended. The surface is ex- cellently preserved. Material: Parian marble? Provenience: Un- known. Dimensions: Preserved length o.2om. Maximum width o.072m. This piece is an example of the familiar devel- oped type of female figure with arms folded across the abdomen, and with the knees slightly bent. The head is elongated and oval in shape. It is held back at an angle, but its volume is contained in the same narrow plane as the rest of the figure so that when it is placed with its back against a flat surface the entire back and buttocks as well as the ridge at the back of the head come into contact with that surface. Presumably the heels of veloped type from Paros in Athens (Zervos ibid., fig. 112); also a late Neolithic head from Topuslar (Zervos op.cit. [su- pra n. 17] II; figs. 445-446) and an idol from Hagia Triada (C. Zervos, L'Art de la Crete [Paris 1956] fig. 97). Other, fuller types of facial markings occur much less frequently: see e.g. Zervos op.cit. (supra n. 3) figs. 47, 178, and an idol in Toronto (Bulletin, loc.cit. [supra n. 51). 20 Cf. the gold funeral masks from Mycenae: S. Marinatos and M. Hirmer, Crete and Mycenae (London 1960) pls. 162- 165, 167 esp. 21For recent interpretations of Early Cycladic idols see K. Schefold, "Heroen und Nymphen in Kykladengribern," Antike Kunst 8 (1965) 87-90; Thimme op.cit. (supra n. 3) 72-86. 22 This piece was published by D. M. Robinson in AJA 59 (i955) 19; pl. ii, figs. Ia-b (front and profile views). I add here a drawing of the back. Dr. Robinson's comments and comparisons are in places misleading and inaccurate: e.g., contrary to his statements the head of the Fogg piece does not resemble the large head from Amorgos in the Louvre, nor does the idol have very much in common with the figurine in St. Louis, which he illustrates in pl. 2: Ic. The description of the Fogg idol and the comparison of it with the piece in Toronto are,, however, adequate; wherefore I give only the basic information here. 23 I examined 21 idols on display in the National Museum in Athens and found that of these 16 were heavily encrusted on the back only, and five on the front only. If the idols had been propped up in the grave at the funeral, one would ex- pect more of them to be encrusted on the front, for they would, at least in some cases, have fallen over on their faces. It is the impression of Mr. C. Doumas of the Greek Archaeological Service, and former epimelete of the Cyclades, that idols were sometimes laid directly on the corpse at burial. This practice may account for the lime deposits on the front of some of the pieces. For the objects placed on the corpse would have fallen, and perhaps overturned, as the body decomposed. 24 See n. 5 supra. Zervos op.cit. (supra n. 3) figs. 245, 249 are very similar to the Fogg idol. For the unusual arm posi- tion of this idol cf. Pryce op.cit. (supra n. io) 8, fig. 4, A14; and an unpublished fragment in the Paros Museum. 24a C. Vermeule in AJA 68 (1964) 323-324; pl. 97, fig. I.</page><page sequence="5">1966] CYCLADIC OBJECTS IN THE FOGG AND FARLAND COLLECTIONS 109 the figure would have once done so also. Of the idols on display in the Cycladic Room of the Na- tional Museum in Athens, numbers 3914, 3920 and 5107 touch the flat surfaces to which they are at- tached at the back of the head, buttocks, and heels.25 I am led by these and other examples to suspect that idols were often especially executed with a view to their being placed in a horizontal position in the grave. If indeed the idols were meant to be laid down rather than propped up-they cannot stand by themselves-the fact that the great majority of them appear to be on tiptoe when put in a stand- ing position would be explained.26 For the down- ward (and often outward) angle of the feet of these figures is the natural one for a person lying on his back.27 In addition, the bend at the knees of the Farland figure (and of so many others of this type) seems much more appropriate for a horizon- tal than for an upright posture.28 The face of the Farland idol has a relatively large triangular nose in low relief. As is normal, none of the other features are represented sculp- turally, nor is there any indication that the eyes, mouth, or ears were added to the stone with paint. The rounded volume of the neck (which is smaller in circumference at the top than at the base) passes into the chest and shoulders of the figure without the circular or V-shaped groove which often articu- lates the juncture of neck and torso on such fig- ures.29 The shoulders slope gently and unequally: the left is longer than the right."0 The breasts are in- dicated by slightly raised small rounded protuber- ances spaced rather far apart. The arms are narrow and flat, their substance raised in low relief and outlined by deep incisions which are followed through on the sides where they define the back of the upper arms. The fingers are not rendered: the right arm simply passes imperceptibly into the stone at the side of the torso. The abdomen is marked by a horizontal grooved depression which is found on many idols, as here, without any further delineation of the pubic area.3' A deep cleft separates the legs, continuing without perforation at least as far as the legs are preserved. The back of the figure is marked by a V-shaped incision originating at the sides of the neck at the point where the neck joins the shoulders. At the apex of the V the incision continues in a single line to represent the spine, and passes below the buttocks into the cleft which separates the legs. Of the few pieces for which Zervos provides photo- graphs of the rear view, two exhibit the same scheme of dorsal incision.32 The first (made of Parian marble and found on Amorgos) is in fact very much like the Farland idol, showing a similar rounding of the buttocks and slightly bent-knee posture. The two idols are also similar from the front. The idol which most nearly resembles the Far- land piece (from the front at least) is one which comes from Paros, although the latter has a more elongated middle section.33 Its arms are similarly narrow, but not as well defined as those of the Farland figure. The Parian example also differs from our idol in that a pubic triangle is incised on it. Otherwise the lines and general contours of the body are very similar. The Parian idol ex- hibits, moreover, the same pronounced asymmetry in the length and slope of the shoulders. 6. A head of developed type in the Farland Col- lection (pl. 29, figs. 14-16) Preservation: The body and part of the neck are missing. The break at the neck does not appear to be recent. The face is worn, the nose chipped. The surface is pitted, particularly on the back. Material: Naxian marble? Provenience: Naxos. Dimensions: Preserved length o.057m. Length of face o.o4m. Maximum width 0o.o032m. This small head probably belonged originally 25 See also the idol in Toronto (Bulletin loc.cit. [supra n. 5]) and an idol in Cambridge (Budde and Nicholls op.cit. [supra n.

The crown is tilted back to form a broad ridge behind. The back curves away from the straight neck at the base of the skull. There is no incision to define the juncture of head and neck. From front and rear the head appears pear- shaped in the manner of the large Amorgenetan head in the Louvre.34 The face is thus broader at the cheeks than at the top, and narrowest at the chin and at a point at the temples. This basic face shape is common in Early Cycladic sculpture.35 The nose, in low relief, is the only facial feature articulated. The snubbed appearance of the end of the nose and the soft chin, which is not strongly brought forward from the neck, are perhaps due to the imperfect state of preservation. 7. A head of developed type in the Fogg Museum, i960.454 (pls. 30-31, figs. 17-19) Preservation: The body and most of the neck are missing. The break at the neck appears to be old. The surface is well preserved, except for the nose which is worn. Material: Marble. Provenience: Unknown. Dimensions: Preserved length o.036m. Length of face o.033m. Maximum width o.0215m. This small head probably belonged originally to a female figure of the normal developed type. It shows the familiar curvature of the face which terminates in back in a flat ridge. The head is set on the neck at a marked angle so that the curve of the face is followed through in the cylinder of the neck. The head is of the pear-shaped variety discussed in no. 6 supra. A small nose of nearly rectangular shape stands out in low relief. No other anatomical details are rendered, and there are no traces of painted features. 8. A large head of developed type in the Farland Collection (pl. 31, figs. 20-22) Preservation: The body and part of the neck are missing. The break at the neck may be recent. The surface is well preserved except for many chips which are missing from the nose and the top and sides of the face. Material: Very coarse-grained unmicaceous mar- ble with red coloration at the right end of the ridge along the back and at the break of the neck on the right side. Provenience: Unknown. Dimensions: Preserved length o.15m. Estimated original length ca. o.7om. Length of face o.IIm. Maximum width (at top of head) originally ca. 0o.o075m. This head, of an unusual size, presumably be- longed originally to a female figure of developed type."6 Viewed in profile, the head forms a con- tinuous gentle curve with the neck and is not at- tached at a marked angle. The top of the head arches back in the usual fashion, forming a rough flat ridge in the rear. In front the neck is set back from the chin, and there is a barely discernible incision under the chin, which becomes more pronounced as it curves up- ward along the sides of the head and in back where it marks off the base of the skull from the neck. The contours of the neck and the back of the head are very flat, but the face, although flat also, shows a gentle vertical curve. The long pyramidal nose repeats this curve. None of the other features are indicated. Viewed frontally, the head is blocky and almost rectangular: the sides are straight; the jaw and chin squared. In this basic design the Farland head bears a striking resemblance to a head of slightly smaller dimensions and finer marble in the Fogg Museum (I96o.452)." The latter is flatter in con- tour at the crown, and the chin is slightly more rounded."8 The profile of the Farland head also resembles closely the profiles of the Amorgenetan head in the Louvre and of another large head, said to have been found on Herakleia, in the collection of Alis- tair B. Martin."9 9. A large head of developed type in the Fogg Mu- seum, 1960.452 (pl. 32, figs. 23-25) Preservation: The body and most of the neck are missing. The head is damaged on top on the left side; a horizontal break across the face has been mended. The end of the nose, part of the left 34Zervos op.cit.

" See no. 9 infra and pl. 32, figs. 23-25. 38s The Fogg piece is broken away at the juncture of head and neck, but enough is preserved to determine, that the angle of the neck in relation to the back of the head was similar to that of the Farland piece. Also it appears that a similar groove separated the cranium from the neck. 39 Zervos op.cit. (supra n. 3) fig. 159; von Bothmer op.cit.

Otherwise the surface is in good condition. Material: Parian marble? Provenience: Un- known. Dimensions: Preserved length o.i i8m. Esti- mated original length o.67m. Length of face 0o.o105 m. Maximum width (at top of head) originally ca. o.o65m. This head, of an unusual size, presumably be- longed originally to a female figure of the de- veloped type. It has been discussed in connection with no. 8 supra. io. A bowl in the Fogg Museum, 1960.461 (pl. 27, fig. 26) Preservation: The piece is nearly complete. Sev- eral breaks and chips have been repaired. The sur- face is well preserved. Material: Grayish marble. Provenience: Un- known. Dimensions: Diameter o.I5om. Height o.o045m. Maximum width of rim o.oo8m. This kind of simple footless bowl without han- dles or lugs is the shape by far most frequently executed in marble during the Early Cycladic pe- riod. On the majority of examples, as here, the rim is slightly rounded and set off on the interior by means of a shallow groove. There are examples in various sizes and proportions.40 An unpublished bowl in Boston (1962.180) closely resembles the Fogg piece in its dimensions. The Early Cycladic objects in the Fogg and Far- land Collections have provided material for a dis- cussion of a variety of sculptural types as well as several important clues relating to the function and manufacture of Cycladic sepulchral idols in gen- eral. Much further excavation and much addi- tional work on the large number of figurines in museums and private collections are needed in or- der to solve such problems as those mentioned in the introduction, and to make it possible for the clues to be used as positive aids to a more com- plete understanding of the material as a whole.
