The Representational Dialectic (With Illustrations from Obscenity, Forfeiture, and Accident Law) Anita Bernsteint Human understanding derives from a "representational dialectic," whereby abstractions make sensory experiences intelligible. The first element of this dialectic, a human tendency to focus on the concrete, may be called "depictionalism." The second element, an effort to sub- sume the concrete within an abstract organizing principle, may be called "rationalism." A struggle between these two modes, one focused on the tangible or images of the tangible, and the other privileging ab- stract schemas such as language, has been underway for millennia. Most realms of culture, including philosophy, religion, art, politics, and some of the sciences, provide evidence of this conflict. In attempting to overcome the appeal of depictionalism, advocates and proponents of rationalism frequently equate depictionalism with primitive or magical thinking-in short, error. In this Article, Anita Bernstein argues that lawmakers and law reformers have aligned themselves with rationalism, and that ignoring or slighting depictionalism has hindered both under- standing of the law and the creation of optimal legal rules.

INTRODUCTION My ten-syllable mouthful is simpler than it sounds: "representational dialectic" refers to a familiar dichotomy in human cognition and understanding.' Our intellect tries to make order of its environment by two opposing-and complementary - methods. Bertrand Russell called these two methods "knowledge by acquain- tance"2 and "knowledge by description."3 Knowledge by acquaintance occurs through sensory perception. In contrast, knowledge by descrip- tion refers to understanding conveyed through verbal formulations and mental abstractions. Western philosophers have produced numerous accounts of the operation of a dialectic between these two methods of acquiring under- standing.4 Representations understood through acquaintance--objects, things, depictions put literally before a perceiving individual--depend on abstractions in order to be understood." In turn, knowledge by 1. A dialectic, writes Elizabeth Schneider, "stands for the idea of the process, connection, and opposition of dualities, and for subsequent change and transcendence." Elizabeth M. Schneider, The Dialectic of Rights and Politics: Perspectives from the Women's Movement, 61 N.Y.U. L. REV. 589, 599 (1986). 2. Knowledge by acquaintance describes the human understanding of things: "we have acquaintance with anything of which we are directly aware, without the intermediary of any process of inference or any knowledge of truths." BERTRAND RUSSELL, THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY 46 (Oxford Univ. Press reprint 1969) (1912) (emphasis in original). Knowledge by acquaintance corresponds with the verb connaitre in French and kennen in German. See id. at 44. 3. In contrast to knowledge by acquaintance, knowledge by description refers to the understanding of truths, conveyed and understood through verbal formulation. See id. at 52. This type of knowledge corresponds to the verbs savoir and wissen. See id. at 44. As Russell elaborates, knowledge by description rests on prior knowledge by acquaintance: "In spite of the fact that we can only know truths which are wholly composed of terms which we have experienced in acquaintance, we can yet have knowledge by description of things we have never experienced." Id. at 59. 4. For a philosophical description of the dialectic, see JOHN LOCKE, AN ESSAY CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING, bk. II, ch. II, ?? 2-4 (Peter H. Nidditch ed., Oxford Univ. Press 1975) (1690) (drawing a dichotomy between "the objects of sensation" and "the operation of our minds" as the sources of ideas). The philosophers W.V. Quine and Gottlob Frege similarly contrast knowledge de re, or "through the thing," with knowledge de dicto, or "said." See Roger F. Gibson, In Conversation: W.V. Quine, 104 MIND 637, 644 (1995) (book review). Psychologists use the term "object relations" to describe the dialectic. See PAUL R. MILLER, SENSE AND SYMBOL 31 (1967) (describing object relations as the developing individual's experience of tangible objects). See also Ernst von Glasersfeld, Sensory Experience, Abstraction, and Teaching, in CONSTRUCTIVISM IN EDUCATION 369, 374-75 (Leslie P. Steffe &amp; Jerry Gale eds., 1995) (describing acquisition of abstractions through interaction with particulars, as understood in learning theory). 5. Descartes, for instance, wrote that images and sensory experiences are intelligible only in a context of reason and intellectual conception. See RENE DESCARTES, Meditations on First Philosophy,</page><page sequence="3">1999] THE REPRESENTATIONAL DIALECTIC 307 description--verbal and mental representations - often relies on illustra- tions drawn from the physical world to explain or convince.6 Consider the sky, for example. Astronomers have helped to order the night sky into concepts: lay persons know the meaning of "planet," "galaxy," and "solar system" because of scientific taxon- omy oriented toward unification, rather than through their sensory per- ception of a personal and visual "night sky." At the same time, "astronomy" urges skygazers to "see" big hurtling orbs instead of, say, light shining through a pinpricked cloth-and perhaps instead of the "heavens" described in the book of Genesis, created divinely on a fourth day as a background above the earth.7 With the example of astronomy-and-religion I mean to advert to political (and, inevitably, legal) conflict. Galileo's famous collision with the dominant scientific and religious systems of his culture demonstrates what happens when perceptions are reordered according to new abstrac- tions.8 The study of legal change in the United States reveals a similar strife: knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description work together but also separately, and stand at opposite ends of a political struggle. The battle has riven numerous areas of American law, of which I have chosen three--obscenity, forfeiture, and accident law-for par- ticular attention.9 Not only legal doctrines but academic reconceptions Fifth Meditation, in 2 PHILOSOPHICAL WRITINGS OF DESCARTES 1, 44-49 (John Cottingham et al. trans., Cambridge Univ. Press 1984). 6.

See JACOB BRONOWSKI, THE ASCENT OF MAN 216 (1973); Owen Gingerich, The Galileo Affair, ScI. AM., Aug. 1982, at 132. 9. Tangible physical objects play a prominent role elsewhere in American law, which frequently asserts that their presence in a dispute or transaction calls for separate doctrinal treatment. One can scarcely count all the ways. For statutory recognition of physical objects, see, for example, the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ? 14 (1994) (making it illegal to form tying arrangements where both the tying and tied goods are tangible): 19 U.S.C. ? 482 (1994) (authorizing customs inspectors to examine "any vehicle, beast, or person, on which or whom . .. they shall suspect there is merchandise subject to duty"); U.C.C. art. 2 (1995) (pertaining to sales of goods). See also United States v. Diaz, 499 F.2d 113, 114 n.9 (9th Cir. 1974) (relying on expert testimony by an anthropologist to decide statutory claim regarding cultural property). Expressions of concern with physical objects in the common law of torts and property include "bailments," see Kitchen v. K-Mart Corp., 697 So. 2d 1200, 1208 (Fla. 1997); "conversion," see Wallander v. Barnes, 671 A.2d 962, 971 (Md. 1996); and "personalty," see General Motors Corp. v. City of Linden, 696 A.2d 683, 690 (N.J. 1997). The common law of crimes</page><page sequence="4">308 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 87:305 of doctrine have been caught in the ancient dialectic. An understanding of this struggle, I will argue, illuminates fundamental debates about the nature and objectives of law. Though well delineated, the two sides of the dialectic are not quite so well labeled, and thus one is forced to coin phrases. Hence I will use the word "depictionalism" for the stance associated with knowledge by acquaintance, which focuses on the presence or representation of a physical object.1' The contrary stance, which emphasizes abstract con- cepts and verbal description, will be "rationalism."" As I elaborate in Parts I and II, the dialectical conflict has not pro- ceeded evenhandedly. It is in the main a history of the perseverance of depictionalism under attack by rationalism, which seeks to bury once identifies object-related concepts: "forgery," "smuggling," "theft," and the like. See BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 650, 1389, 1477 (6th ed. 1990). Civil procedure recognizes in rem (thing-related) jurisdiction, see infra text accompanying note 172 (relating in rem jurisdiction to civil forfeiture); evidence law considers physical objects in its rules on authentication, spoliation, and "writings, recordings and photographs," see, e.g., FED. R. EVID. 1006. Moving beyond the United States, legal anthropologists have built a literature of the "law of things" situated within culture. See, e.g., Rosemary J. Coombe, The Cultural Life of Things: Anthropological Approaches to Law and Society in Conditions of Globalization, 10 AM. U. J. INT'L L. &amp; POL 'Y 791, 792-94 (1995) (citing sources); id. at 823-25 (relating legal anthropology to trademarks); Andrew Huxley, Golden Yoke, Silken Tent, 106 YALE L.J. 1885 (1997) (book review) (providing examples of the law of things in Tibet and ancient China). The three subjects that receive close attention in this Article are representative of this vast expanse. They cover criminal and civil law; the example of forfeiture covers terrain in between. See Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 634 n.9 (1886) (calling civil forfeiture "quasi-criminal"). They are expressed in both statutory and common law rules, and they reveal connections to the larger representational dialectic. When appropriate, the Article refers to illustrations outside of obscenity, forfeiture, and accident law. 10. Slightly more graceful terms such as "objectivism" and "representationalism" are already occupied by different philosophical concepts, and are sometimes used to describe knowledge by description, rather than the knowledge by acquaintance that I need a word to connote. See, e.g., LEONARD PEIKOFF, OBJECTIVISM: THE PHILOSOPHY OF AYN RAND (1991) (describing Rand's philosophy of objectivism, based on rationality and principles of "enlightened selfishness"); William G. Weaver, Note, Richard Rorty and the Radical Left, 78 VA. L. REV. 729, 730 (1992) (calling Plato's philosophy of highly abstract, rationalist ideals "representationalism"); Anthony J. Sebok, Book Review, 93 CAN. J. L. &amp; JURIS. 457, 459-60 (1998) (reviewing Law and Truth by Dennis Patterson) (invoking Patterson's use of "representationalism" to refer to philosophy of language). My colleague Richard Warner, a philosopher, has suggested "antipropositionalism," but inasmuch as I believe that knowledge by acquaintance is prior to knowledge by description, see supra notes 2-3 and infra notes 334-335 and accompanying text, this negative locution, to my mind, does not quite describe what is termed depictionalism here. Russell's "knowledge by acquaintance," see supra note 2, describes almost precisely what I mean by depictionalism, but in the interest of brevity I prefer a single word to a prepositional phrase. 11. Like "representationalism," this word has an extensive set of meanings in philosophy and elsewhere. Bernard Williams, after noting the existence of "several different outlooks and movements of ideas" that fall under this rubric, supplies a working definition: "the philosophical outlook or program which stresses the power of a priori reason to grasp substantial truths about the world." Bernard Williams, Rationalism, in 7 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY 69, 69 (Paul Edwards ed., 1967). I use rationalism as an umbrella term, covering morality, efficiency, deterrence, corrective justice, incentives, and other such ambitions associated with the law.</page><page sequence="5">1999] THE REPRESENTATIONAL DIALECTIC 309 and for all the "superstition,"'2 the "fetishism,"'3 the "idolatry,"'4 the "silly animism,"'" the "primitive" thinking,'6 and the "bizarre havoc"'7 caused by depictionalism's focus on the tangible." Although seldom defended as such, depictionalism holds its ground against charges that it obstructs philosophical, theological, economic, political, and social coherence and clarity. Perhaps it endures, I argue, because knowledge by acquaintance is fundamental to any kind of understand- ing. Depictionalism perseveres also because rationalists say it does: most rationalists share a habit of identifying depictionalism with the backward past, and call abstraction part of current and future en- lightenment. In Part I of this Article, I provide a short historical survey of the never-successful rationalist endeavor in Western culture to super- sede depictionalism in religion, politics, psychology, and the visual arts. American law, particularly as it has been shaped by reformers and academic critics, reveals a similar pattern of depictionalist perseverance in the face of rationalist attack. Despite the extraordinary influence of law and economics (the quintessential rationalist ideology) and its tenet that markets can price and exchange almost anything,'9 including legal 12. Mary M.

Professor Nussbaum gives as an example of this commitment the practice of measuring a nation's "quality of life" simply by its GNP per capita. Id. at 1202. An illustration of how law and economics disdains the physical object comes from a talk that Judge Frank Easterbrook, a noted devotee of this approach, once presented. Easterbrook mockingly coined the phrase "the law of the horse." Case law, Easterbrook explained, is full of horse licenses, horses that kick, sales of horses, and the veterinary standard of care for medical treatment of horses. But the law rightly lacks an equine category: its task is to focus on general rules and principles, including "contract, intellectual property, privacy, free speech and the like."

Part II of this Article conveys some of this power with reference to the law of obscenity, forfeiture, and acci- dents. Each of these areas of law has absorbed rationalist criticism, but only to partial avail; law reform proposals that followed or accompanied such criticism failed to eliminate dependence on the tangible, or images of the tangible, from these areas of the law. Obscenity doctrine still criminalizes the essence of a work, such as a videotape or a novel, rather than the behavioral hazards to public order that normally concern the criminal law.23 Civil asset forfeiture personifies inanimate objects, con- demning them for the taint of moral guilt, even where such a determi- nation means that innocent people have to suffer--and at the hands of the state-in consequence.24 Accident law finds tangible things crucial in two of its important doctrines, pure economic loss and products liabil- ity.25 Thus, within the world of torts, an area professedly concerned with public policy, corrective justice, deterrence, economic efficiency, and the like,26 the image of a corporeal thing can stand, lumplike, in the path of these goals. Depictionalism thus challenges the very center of civil and criminal law.27 20. See Ronald A. Coase, The Problem of Social Cost, 3 J.L. &amp; EcoN. 1, 2-8 (1960) (identifying legal remedies as an element of the costs and benefits associated with certain kinds of activity, and arguing that individuals can price and exchange them). 21.

Joel Feinberg's four-volume The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law consists of an extended argument that harm or offense is necessary to justify a criminal prohibition: harm must be the principal reason for criminalization, whereas offense has a narrower province and does not simply emanate from objects. Offense, according to Feinberg, requires that someone be offended. Actions "are immoral (better indecent) because they offend; they do not offend because they are judged to be, in their essential nature, immoral." 4 JOEL FEINBERG, THE MORAL LIMITS OF THE CRIMINAL LAW 15-16 (1988).

The legal concept of property, however, is an unusual bastion of depictionalism. Property indeed may amount to the greatest triumph of knowledge by acquaintance in American law. Despite scholarly arguments that the subject lacks inherent content and is instead a description of rights among persons, see, e.g., Emily Sherwin, Two- and Three-Dimensional Property Rights, 29 ARIZ. ST. L.J. 1075, 1079 (1997) (citing Joseph L. Sax, Takings and the Police Power, 74 YALE L.J. 36, 61 (1964)), property law recognizes that its first task "is not to resolve disputes between people over resources, but to establish a relation between a person and an identifiable thing," Sherwin, supra at 1086.

At the conceptual level, reformist aca- demics rely on rationalist social science findings to buttress their pro- posals for legal change, without scrutinizing these sources for descriptive accuracy. Consider, for example, the well-known experi- mental study that set up a market where cash, tokens, and coffee mugs were to be traded among the undergraduate subjects. The study found that students traded tokens for cash in happy equilibrium, following a smooth pattern of supply and demand curves, but refused to "sell" their coffee mugs for the price in tokens that economic theory would dictate.28 The designers of the study refer to this anomalous outcome as "the endowment effect," which they define as loss aversion, the idea that people deem losses weightier than gains.29 They never directly con- front the possibility that a coffee mug with the Cornell logo might sig- nify something different from its "equivalent" in tokens and money, even though their experiment proved exactly that. The researchers pre- fer to interpret their subjects' behavior in terms of gains versus losses-- a vocabulary with which professional economists feel comfortable-- even though the idea of a market, if it says anything, denies that buyers "gain" at the expense of sellers who "lose." Academic lawyers con- sume misperceptions like these and build policy on them: a clearer sense of what constitute losses and gains might yield a better conclu- sion.30 Such a determination demands that the policymaker abandon the comfortable familiarity of money-language, and look at the object. At the level of pragmatic strategy, frustrated activists who fail to effect legal change tend to misplace blame; they look for familiar vil- lains. Conservative temperaments, entrenched financial interests, public cowardice, institutional resistance (coming from ideological antagonists on the bench, legislators who cannot defy the predictions of public choice theory, and nonacquiescent administrators), and the problem of significance" in property law. Id. at 1091. Describing this stance of property law in conversation with me, Bailey Kuklin has suggested the helpful metaphor of a telescope: contract, tort, and criminal law regard things as instruments, with people at the end; property law, following depictionalism, will often reverse the telescope to make endpoints of physical objects. 28. See Daniel Kahneman et al., Experimental Tests of the Endowment Effect and the Coase Theorem, 98 J. POL. EcON. 1325 (1990). 29. Id. at 1327. 30. For instance, one law review article argues that the endowment effect, among other insights of behavioral law and economics, should be used to inform policy. The authors propose that to encourage women to perform breast self-examination, the state should not bother to create regulations or taxes that punish the failure to examine one's breasts. Instead it should exploit the human tendency to weigh losses more heavily than gains, and print "pamphlets that stress the negative consequences of a refusal to undertake self-examination."

As explanations for outcomes, they may well be right. I am arguing, however, that they are often incom- plete. If depictionalism also stands in the way of law reform, then both advocates of change and their resisters need to reassess law reform as it is now practiced and studied. Accordingly, Parts III and IV analyze depictionalism as a cultural force that intersects with legal doctrine. Part III explores the congruence of depictionalism with theories of human behavior derived from phi- losophy, psychology, and political theory. In arguing that depictional- ism lines up with philosophical traditions, learning theory, and indeed liberal politics, I hope to show that the dumber, less articulate half of the representational dialectic not only is here to stay, but occasionally yields benevolent effects. The last Section of Part III concludes by praising depictionalism as a brake on law reform. Notwithstanding the infamous history of "all deliberate speed,"33 some reforms do move too fast. Shifting to favor the other side of the dialectic, Part IV assesses depictionalism from the vantage point of one rationalist objection. It is idle, I think, for rationalist law reformers to thunder against superstition and irrationality in the law. Rationalism has available a more serious avenue of both thought and action, pertaining to freedom. "State inter- ference is an evil, where it cannot be shown to be a good," as Oliver Wendell Holmes famously wrote;34 here I argue that depictionalism tends paradoxically to bolster state interference of a centralized kind, despite its eclecticism and pluralism. If the danger of rationalism is its tendency to reduce physical objects and images of physical objects to abstractions or verbal expressions--the better to centralize control-- then the danger of depictionalism is that its focus on physical objects conceals an equivalent control, a statist encroachment into human liberty. The example of forfeiture provides the clearest illustration, 31.

When it finally gives depictionalism its due, rationalism will gain power to im- prove the law. I THE DIALECTIC BETWEEN DEPICTIONALISM AND RATIONALISM The struggle of rationalism to supersede depictionalism is as old as any other Western intellectual or religious tradition. At the beginning of the common era Greek and Judeo-Christian thinkers became the first major participants in the representational dialectic. Other religions be- gan to assert their "aniconism," or aversion to the veneration of 35. See PETER W. HUBER, LIABILITY 161 (1988); Richard A. Epstein, The Risks of Risk/Utility, 48 OHIO ST. L.J. 469, 475-77 (1987). See generally Richard Overton, An Arrow Against All Tyrants, in THE LIBERTARIAN READER 121-22 (David Boaz ed., Free Press 1997) (1646) (arguing that the sovereign has the power only to act for the common good; because every man is "a king, priest and prophet," he is entitled to a government of limited powers). 36. Philosophers warn that a dialectic is not a tug-of-war but rather an ongoing, restless relationship among negating, affirming, and transcending moments. See RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN, PRAXIS AND ACTION 20-21 (1971); cf. ALLEN W. WOOD, HEGEL'S ETHICAL THOUGHT 3 (1990) (attacking vulgarization of Hegelian dialectical method, especially through "grotesque jargon" and "ridiculous expository devices"). In this spirit, I have not taken sides, nor put money on one of two horses, but rather tried to inform a continuing relation that will remain dynamic. Neither side can vanquish the other. 37. On rationalist themes in American law, see, for example, EDWIN W. PATTERSON, JURISPRUDENCE 189-94 (1953) (noting social importance of making law intelligible to lay persons); Linda Ross Meyer, Is Practical Reason Mindless?, 86 GEO.

TIMES, Mar. 8, 1996, at A30 ("When the nation's highest court displays indifference to unfair actions by government against people who have done nothing wrong, it invites cynicism about the institution and the justice system generally."). 39.

Over the next two thousand years, rationalists moved the dialectic into new domains. A. Icons, Aniconism, and Iconoclasm Condemnation of idolatry-that is to say, hostility toward a type of depictionalism that endowed tangible objects with religious signifi- cance-has remained constant in Western theologies, while agreement about what constitutes idolatry has shifted. Judaism and Christianity have for many centuries asserted the truth of monotheistic abstraction. In antiquity, leaders of these faiths condemned pagan religion for its emphasis on earthly particulars like the wind and the rain, equating this taste for natural images with idolatry.40 Debates between the two camps on the subject of depictionalism were recorded in the second and third centuries.4' These debates revealed that neither monotheism nor pagan- ism could be equated with either depictionalism or rationalism. Moreo- ver the Greeks, who simultaneously were "idolators" and framers of philosophical abstractions including the idea of divinity, claimed some of the ideological territory of monotheism while defending their pagan religion.42 For his contributions to the rationalist cause, one Greek phi- losopher, Xenophanes, has been credited with membership in a "religious Enlightenment" whose modern members include Kant and Feuerbach.43 Later Christian history displayed the representational dialectic in its more famous struggles. In the eighth century, about four hundred years after church buildings began to display paintings of Christ and the saints, iconoclasts-"idol-smashers" opposed to the use of images- prevailed on the Byzantine monarchy to ban the veneration of images.44 Christian defenders of icons retorted that since Christ was willing to be- come a man, images that showed the Logos as a physical, incarnated being were appropriate to the religion; neo-Platonist philosophers joined the fray, defending images as didactically necessary.45 40.

Sixteenth-century Protestant leaders, notably Ulrich Zwingli and Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt, declared that the Church had fallen "ankle-deep in the 'filth' of im- ages, relics, altars, holy places, and miraculous hosts."46 Karlstadt's 1522 pamphlet, "On the Abolition of Images," also known as the Abthung, launched what has been called the Protestant theology of idolatry.47 Iconoclastic violence followed these iconoclastic pronounce- ments. Image-smashing riots spread through France in the years 1560 to 1562,48 and virtually every hamlet and city in the Netherlands shook with similar attacks in late 1566.49 In England the sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries witnessed great destruction in consequence of icono- clastic theology, beginning with the Reformation and continuing with Puritan hatred of Catholic aesthetics.50 Idols did not remain smashed: following the tendency of depictionalism to withstand ration- alist attacks, images survived the Reformation.51 Other religions have made a theological issue of depictionalism. Scholars have attempted to plot a continuum of beliefs about images among religious creeds, putting religions such as Islam that are hostile to images, or "aniconically inclined," at one end and religions that fa- vor images, such as Hinduism, at the other.52 But the task has proved dif- ficult. Muslim hostility toward idolatry, for example, has not wiped out images but confined them to such places as architectural settings (such as bath tiles) and secular books; moreover, the Qur'an is equivocal on the subject, expressing hostility for "idolators" rather than idols.53 Yahweh, the god that would not be seen, is nevertheless observed in his effects and manifestations.54 Moreover, religions associated with statues 46.

Neither depicted imagery nor pure ab- straction conquers the other; religions waver on their doctrine of icons and aniconism. As studied by the Israeli philosophers Moshe Halbertal and Avishai Margalit, the history of Western religion reveals a debate over the nature of "idolatry," and this debate mirrors the representational dialectic. Halbertal and Margalit identify a conceptual "chain of criticism of re- ligion."'57 First monotheistic religions attack idolatry; next philosophi- cally oriented authorities on monotheistic religions criticize "folk practitioners" for their "idolatrous assumptions and errors with respect to the divinity, especially on issues such as God's corporeality;"58 the secular Enlightenment then criticizes religion generally for its depend- ence on rites and symbols; and finally the criticism of ideology attacks the secular Enlightenment for its dependence on a fiction of objectivity that yields idols in the form of imaginary reifications, such as nation, race, and class.59 Each link in the chain of Western religious criticism perceives itself as more rational--because less depictionalist--than the earlier link that it attacks.' Yet depictionalism in religion and political thought endures.61 B.

In this ide- ology, any competing claim about the uniqueness of an object was at best primitive sentimentalism--if not a direct impediment to profit, as Henry Ford taught when he insisted in 1913 that his Model T plant use interchangeable parts.65 Nineteenth-century developments in business history such as the large-scale separation of corporate ownership from control,66 the prolif- eration of new contractual relationships,67 the spread of stock and fu- tures exchanges,68 and the growth of an urban working class drawn from foreign countries and rural America69 all testified to the power of ab- straction over visible objects and traditions,70 such as bartering71 and the family farm.72 Never defeated, depictionalism asserted itself alongside THE PROTESTANT ETHIC AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM 169 (Talcott Parsons trans., Charles Scribner's Sons 1930) (1920).

Ornate architecture, elaborate fashions in clothes and hairstyles, and conspicuous consumption marked the last two dec- ades of the nineteenth century, making the abstraction of money visible and palpable. From his vantage point in the middle of the nineteenth century, Karl Marx observed and attacked the tendency of capitalism to turn tangible entities into abstraction73--a concept embedded in the Marxist term "alienation"- while sharing with capitalism a taste for abstract ideas powerful enough to defeat depictionalism. Building on the work of earlier philosophers including Locke and Adam Smith, who had characterized property as expressions of human personality, Marx ar- gued that things were never completely external to man. Capital, for in- stance, is accumulated human labor rather than an object with independent meaning,74 and a house is small or large only with respect to its surroundings and the perspective of its owner and onlookers.75 Sensory perception deceives: objects to Marx were functions of politi- cal order, dependent on abstraction for their meaning. And because "any particular concept of property is relative, historically determined and ephemeral,""76 a political and economic revolution has the power to effect not only distributive justice but reconceptions of physical subsis- tence. This power of the abstract to become tangible, and the tangible ab- stract, was to Marx both lamentable and redemptive. What Marx called "the fetishism of commodities," for instance, referred to a transforma- tion whereby things become subjects and masters with human attributes, while persons, workers and capitalists alike, are divested of their person- ality.77 Yet Marx could simultaneously attack the bourgeoisie for strip- ping human relationships of their "heavenly ecstasies," oriented around religion and chivalry and sentiment, and substituting cold cash, 73.

Continuing the theme of rationalism superseding depictionalism, Marx contended that although capitalism had destroyed the concrete particulars of the past, the cure for this destruction was not a return to depictionalism but a more enlightened-and more thor- oughly abstract- redemptive ideology.79 Marxism and capitalism thus displayed common characteristics in their expressions of the representational dialectic. Like the iconoclasts who preceded them in theological realms, both shared a belief in a ra- tionalist present and future that would supersede the depictionalist past.80 Like aniconical religions, furthermore, Marxism and capitalism retained depictionalist sentiments and left unresolved their contradictory attitudes toward images."8 But these nineteenth-century versions of the dialectic were novel as well as familiar. The ambient ideal of progress gave new power to these conflicting rationalist faiths in the power of abstraction,82 while political and economic change expanded the representational dialectic beyond religion into the modem nation-state. At the turn of the new century, rationalism--always the aggressor--pressed on, finding new sites for the dialectic. C. Early Twentieth-Century Rationalism: The Modernist Project Rationalism found a power base in the work of Sigmund Freud, who extended the applications of rationalism to psychology, philoso- phy, sociology, and political theory. Freud found meaning in the ob- jects found in fantasy and dreams, insisting that such images embody ideas and emotions too harsh for an individual to accept undisguised.83 78.

One example among many: Freud recounted treating a married woman for agoraphobia. The woman reported a dream in which she walked out of her home wearing a hat, which made her feel safe as she strolled past a group of men. Through discussion, Freud learned that the hat was shaped like a more splendid version of her husband's scrotum, and concluded that it stood for her unfulfilled wish for sexual fulfillment from her husband, which would have made her feel safe from</page><page sequence="16">320 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 87:305 Thus, a cigar might on rare occasions be just a cigar, but dream images stand for something else;84 prayer to God is projection, or prayer to one- self."5 Psychosexual anxiety, as Freud explained it, must be understood as yet another error of depictionalism. The child acquires misinforma- tion from the sight of human genitals--most famously that his father, having a larger penis, will castrate him,86 or that girls are children who have been maimed as punishment.87 The false, or at least questionable, teachings of depictionalism contribute to neurosis, a condition that can be remedied only by rationalist treatments.88 As feminist psychoanalysts and critics have pointed out, Freud's rationalist approach paradoxically privileged physical signifiers.89 This paradox is ever-present within rationalism: the center of rationalism is neither its cogency nor the purity of its abstraction, but its attitude to- ward the physical object. Just as all religions, however aniconically in- clined, depend on images, so too will rationalist ideology be caught in its depictionalist contradictions. Freud advanced the cause of rationalism not through his own rationality but by enlarging the territory that ra- tionalism claimed for its own. Following Freud, the rationalist quest moved to the visual arts.90 Modern art in the twentieth century provided another venue in which the danger of extramarital temptation.

As the philosopher Arthur Danto argues, modernism began in artists' ef- forts to replace "cultural boundaries as artistically expressed" with "an aesthetic universal."91 One prominent figure in this movement was the impresario Hilla Rebay, founder of what became the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum of Art, who asserted passionately that "art was progressive" and that in the twentieth century "contemporary artists had rid themselves of the need to reproduce the visual world. Non- objective painting, in which recognizable objects were completely elimi- nated, represented the summit of art.'"92 The art genre of which Rebay spoke became known as "abstract," over the protests of many practi- tioners who believed they were not abstracting from another source but instead creating anew.93 Rebay herself preferred the German adjective gegenstandlos--free of objects--to describe her ideal.94 More overtly than predecessor genres, modernist art also moved into the rationalist realms of psychology and politics. The spirit of modernism, Danto writes, urged museumgoers to see paintings not sim- ply as surfaces "but as instruments for changing one's life."95 Depic- tionalism, as always, fought back. Soviet authorities used Socialist Realism, a depictionalist posture, in resistance to the achievement of great Russian modernists like Kandinsky and Malevich;96 Nazis called abstract art degenerate;97 audiences and collectors continue to prefer figurative work.98 AND POETRY (Edward Allen McCormick trans., Bobbs-Merrill 1962) (1766) (arguing that the visual and the verbal arts occupy separate and opposite domains).

Political theorist Harry Redner argues that modernism "killed itself' by its inevitable alliance with totalitarianism: the attack on representation in art accompanied an attack on representation in politics--that is, on "representative democracy and tolerant liberal- ism; ""99 the tenet of e(pater le bourgeoisie sneered equally at parliaments and depiction. Redner goes so far as to assert that modernism must take some responsibility for the fashionable revolutionary violence he asso- ciates with Wagner, Bakunin, Brecht, Genet, and Foucault.'00 This stance may go too far--as I argue below, adherence to depictionalism too can oppress citizens and arm the statel0o--but Redner's view of the struggle helpfully illuminates the political conflict between the two modes. Over the centuries, the representational dialectic has taken many forms--some of them bloody. From the Egyptian rulers Akenaten and Tutankhamen, who ordered selected images destroyed,102 through the almost infinite number and variety of iconoclastic conflicts barely skimmed over in this Part, the struggle persists. Depictionalism contin- ues to withstand the ambition of rationalism to achieve a preemptive, overarching knowledge by description--in law as well as in art, politics, social science, and religion. "What is representation?" Redner queries. "This question has preoccupied philosophers, theologians, epistemolo- gists, logicians, aestheticians, psychologists, anthropologists, and more recently semioticians, and many other types of savant .

II THE DIALECTIC IN AMERICAN LAW As expressed in the law of obscenity, forfeiture, and accidents, the representational dialectic reveals patterns similar to those identified in Part I.

A. Obscenity The American law of obscenity originates with a decision reported as Sir Charles Sydlyes Case."06 During the Stuart restoration, in 1663, a crony of the King named Charles Sedley mounted the balcony of a London tavern and took off his clothes, while "haranguing his audience with antireligious epithets as he showered them with bottles of urine."'07 Having employed force to cause unruliness, Sedley committed a crime at common law, writes constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe; but the new common law of obscenity identified Sedley's nakedness, rather than his actions, as a breach of the peace.'08 Following this precedent, English common law created a new crime of obscenity."09 The tradition took hold in the United States, where both statutes and common law went on to proscribe obscenity."0 A study of American judicial decisions, state and federal statutes, and academic commentary in the two centuries following the importa- tion of English law shows a focus on material itself, literal and physical like the body of Sedley, with relative neglect of the harms and incentives that such material may occasion.

I note another valuable insight from the Brooklyn Law School faculty: Bailey Kuklin has commented that rationalism might really be ascendant here, exploiting images of things for their power to shape assent, or as shorthand for an array of harms that would otherwise be difficult to catalogue and repair. Accord HARRY M. CLOR, OBSCENITY AND PUBLIC MORALITY (1969) (arguing that too much concern about the harm of obscenity would hobble legal measures against it). In this view, images are tools rather than ends in themselves, and rationalism only pretends to cede power to depictionalism. While this assessment of the dialectic holds some appeal, I believe that depictionalism has more strength than Professor Kuklin has claimed. In obscenity, for instance, activists disagree profoundly about the harms of certain works, yet are united by their desire to suppress. If the image were merely a rhetorical and tactical device-the means to an end-then the end in question would be clearer. See infra notes 155-161 and accompanying text. 106. 1 Keble 620, 83 Eng.

Insofar as most of the law of obscenity pertains to crimes,12 this indifference to social harm seems peculiar.113 The domain of crimi- nal law-or any law-does not readily invite such a metaphysical quest for the essence of things. Depictionalist preoccupation with the thing--a book, magazine, film, videotape, rather than risks, harms, norms, principles, or causal re- lationships-has provoked rationalist dissent. Judges have questioned the utility of a law of obscenity that does not much care about direct danger.'4 Scholars have attempted to demonstrate the harmful nature of obscene works, thereby defending a depictionalist doctrine in rationalist terms."' Despite these writings, obscenity law has kept faith with depic- tionalism.

Mainstream obscenity doctrine, in sum, has generated but not heeded rationalist queries. Whence depictionalism? For centuries the common law (and also European civil law)"8 lived without any obscenity doctrine-and then Jacobean England inaugurated a law of obscenity, whose core remains unchanged. Explanations of origin are obscure. Morris Ernst and Alan Schwartz have speculated that laws against obscenity arose during the growth of education and literacy, when powerful 61ites who controlled society feared that somehow the masses "were less resistant to the cor- rupting influence of books than the well-to-do."199 Obscenity law, ac- cording to Ernst and Schwartz, began with a declaration that an entity like a book has separate properties depending on who consumes it: You're too common to protect yourself from corruption; my sister is too pure to protect herself from corruption; I'd just shrug it off. A rational- ist, by contrast, expects the state to explain how and why obscene entities harm a "public" that has not been proved to divide along lines of tem- perament or circumstance. Seen in terms of the representational dialectic, the chronological development of obscenity law is notable for its steady rejection of ra- tionalism. A short history may aid this discussion. The strongest illus- tration of Ernst and Schwartz's fear-of-common-folk hypothesis is an English case decided in 1868, The Queen v. Hicklin.'20 Hicklin held that once the essence of challenged material is identified, the court need not concern itself with "the traditional questions of cause and effect, of speech and resultant end."''12 This essence of a suppressible work, ac- cording to Hicklin, is a "tendency . . to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences."22 Following the 117. See CLOR, supra note 105, at 196-97 (arguing that if the law waits until bad acts "have been done or are about to be done," the level of force necessary to deter these acts will have to be too draconian). 118. See generally J.G.M. van Dijk, The Function of Fables in Graeco-Roman Romance, 49 MNEMOSYNE 513, 515 (1996) (noting prevalence of "obscenity" in Greek and Roman literature).

See Norman St. John-Stevas, The Church and Censorship, in 'To DEPRAVE AND CORRUPT...' 89, 91-105 (John Chandos ed., 1962). But legal doctrines against obscenity-rules of law that bind the sovereign and offer guidance to the citizenry-have been slow to form, and many governments have a history of toleration coexisting with their history of censorship.

One Book Called "Ulysses,"30 a decision published twenty years later, Judge John Woolsey repudiated Hicklin on three points: first, Woolsey wrote, an obscene work must "tend" to provoke not depravity but rather sexual impulses or thoughts; second, the work must be examined in its entirety, not read selectively for lubri- cious passages; and third, the relevant consumer is not a corruptible child or priapic brute but rather "what the French would call l'homme moyen sensuel"-the average or reasonable man.'13 In 1956, Jerome Frank scoffed at Hicklin's prudishness, finding censorship an offense to the memory of such robust Founders as Jefferson and Franklin.132 The noted repudiations of Hand, Woolsey, and Frank have received fair credit for moving obscenity law away from its Victorian mix of authoritarianism, sexual repression, and condescension toward the lower orders toward a more sophisticated view of the world.133 Judges and policymakers generally agree that most readers are not children; that 123.

When the Supreme Court crushed Hicklin with the declaration in Roth v. United States that the new constitutional test for obscenity was "whether to the average person, applying contempo- rary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest,"134 it owed a debt to Hand, Woolsey, and Frank that the Brennan opinion for the Court did not fully ac- knowledge. Yet of the progress-minded jurists from New York, only Frank had expressed any skepticism about the search for essence."35 Hand wanted merely to liberalize the search; Woolsey had no interest in constitutional tests. Surely, though, if the First Amendment limits the regulation of obscenity-as the Supreme Court insisted in Roth and its sequelae'36- then obscene works must be "speech," albeit speech of a dubious kind, and free speech law generally asserts that only danger can justify sup- pression. Rejecting this precept, the search for essence follows an "exclusion" approach: courts consider whether a work by its inherent nature contains a property that alone justifies excluding it from First Amendment protection. When courts find this essence, they must permit the state to suppress.'37 This outlook retains the curious and unarticu- lated premise that a thing has a nature. Ernst and Schwartz paraphrase this point as a constitutional law lament. In determining whether a work is obscene, they complain, we need not give it the benefit of the tests and standards that are required to be applied to the other kinds of speech-Holmes's "clear and present danger" or the Brandeis variant-all of 134.

See also id. at 811 (noting that one obvious effect of erotic material is the arousal of desire, which is necessary for the continuation of the human race and therefore valuable to the state). 136. The Roth test was reformulated in later decisions. See Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973) (referring to lack of "serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value"); A Book Named "John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure" v.

Georgia, 418 U.S. 153, 157 (1974) (limiting the range of permissible local variation within "contemporary community standards"). 137. As a student commentator elaborates, the "exclusion" approach-the insistence that certain verbal expressions are not speech for purposes of First Amendment protection-may be traced to Zechariah Chafee's Free Speech in the United States. See Note, supra note 121, at 1366-69. "The only sound explanation of the punishment of obscenity and profanity," wrote Chafee, "is that the words are criminal, not because of the ideas they communicate, but like acts because of their immediate consequences to the five senses."

In other words, we first decide whether some writing is ob- scene and then we say that because it is obscene it is not entitled to any of the tests used to judge whether other kinds of writings are entitled to the protection of the Constitution.'38 A rationalist contrast, sketched out by Harry Kalven, Jr. to inaugu- rate the new Supreme Court Review,139 likely reached several Justices of the Supreme Court in the years following Roth. Having no particular investment in rationalism, Kalven appeared more baffled by depiction- alism than hostile to it. "Toward what dangers was obscenity legislation directed?"'40 he queried in 1960, soon after the Supreme Court got into the business of constitutionalizing obscenity disputes. Had Kalven stopped short of asserting that if there are no dangers, there ought to be no crime. "Analysis," continued Kalven in response to his rhetorical ques- tion, "reveals four possible evils: (1) the incitement to antisocial sexual conduct; (2) psychological excitement resulting from sexual imagery; (3) the arousing of feelings of disgust and revulsion; and (4) the advo- cacy of improper sexual values. All present difficulties."'4' They do indeed. Evil 1 on the Kalven list, as I mentioned, lay virtually unex- amined. Evil 2 seems to mean tumescence-a physical expression that a reader enjoys while consuming sexually explicit materials. 42 Putting aside the question of whether "psychological excitement" is one of the "evils" that warrant application of the criminal law, Evil 2 is inconsis- tent with Evil 3, which declares that obscenity turns a man off rather than on: Kalven refers to causation of harm with the word "arousing" but what obscenity causes, according to Evil 3, is "disgust and revul- sion" rather than an erection. The words "advocacy" and "improper" in Evil 4 beg all the questions on the table. In what sense do films and pictorials advocate?'43 What results from such advocacy? Whose sexual values are proper? Following Roth and the Kalven article, Supreme Court case law cleared up some of this doubt by explaining "value" in terms of social 138. ERNST &amp; SCHWARTZ, supra note 119, at 205. 139.

Religious leaders have attacked pornography with claims that it causes harm to the spirit (to them pornography "arrests personal devel- opment," "distorts the beauty and goodness of human love," and "erodes the general moral fiber")'5' reminiscent of all that John Stuart Mill thought was none of the business of a liberal state.152 Worried about the radical-right power to silence and oppress women, anti-pornography feminists struggle to look at pornography in a way that affirms the 144.

A rationalist pornography law--absent in the United States and everywhere else--would focus first on a harm, and then identify those objects that conduce to it. The depictionalist version that prevails instead agrees that a thing is pornographic; activists use this essence only later to establish the harm of their choice. One can observe the dialectic at work by reviewing endorsements of suppressing obscenity and pornography. Roman Catholic canon law has denounced obscenity as part of a wider condemnation of "heretical and schismatical books, books supporting divorce, dueling, suicide, or which evoke spirits, advocate magic, etc."'55 Harry Clor and Ernest van den Haag maintain that censorship is necessary to respect continuity, tradition, and stabilizing forces in society.'56 Andrea Dworkin condemns pornography because, she says, pornography begets murder, torture, racist violence, harassment of women and children, and forced prostitu- tion.r57 The psychiatrist Park Dietz claims that pornography ought to be suppressed because it teaches its consumers "sexual disinformation."'58 Henry Hudson, chairman of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, has suggested that laws against pornography would aid the right side of the battle between federal law enforcement and organ- ized crime.'59 A German commentator professes his concern that 153. Although a distinction between the two cannot be drawn with precision, "erotica" seems to connote nonviolence, egalitarian participation, female agency, and a cheerful atmosphere: sexual encounters seen as playful or joyous or tender, without overt aggression or dominance by one participant over another.

These divergent assertions about harm all purport to address the same kind of material. Of course, everybody could be right: obscene materials might threaten both traditional gender boundaries and the liberation of women; they might repulse and arouse; they might foster mechanical and imitative sexual practices and teach deviance; they might advocate "improper sexual values"'61 and thereby raise a threat that the state could regulate consistent with the First Amendment and not be words at all, out of the range of First Amendment protection. Or, alternatively, some assertions about the causation of harm could be right and others wrong. The merits of various rationalist arguments do not concern us here. For purposes of identifying a representational dialectic in obscen- ity law, we need note only the proliferation of conflicting causal propo- sitions that swirl around one point: obscenity within a thing per se defines and justifies an area of criminal-law regulation. Criminal law contains no exception to the harm requirement as vast as this triumph of depictionalism. B. Forfeiture At an oral argument in November 1995, Justice Stephen Breyer flew the rationalist flag. "What policy does it serve? What purpose does it serve? What's the theory... ?" he demanded of Larry Roberts,'62 an assistant state's attorney arguing for the respondent in Bennis v. Michigan.'63 At issue in Bennis was civil asset forfeiture. Tina Bennis had challenged a Michigan forfeiture statute as unconstitutional on the ground that it lacked an innocent owner defense, and Justice Breyer wanted Michigan to justify its power to punish an "innocent" with the forfeiture of her asset, in this case a clunky Pontiac worth less than $600.164 The record shows that, consistent with the history of the dialectic, Roberts responded passively. He did not defend depictionalism or 160. See Reimann, supra note 118, at 226. 161. See Kalven, supra note 139, at 4. 162. See Transcript of Oral Argument, Nov. 29, 1995, at 51, Bennis v.

Pursuant to an abatement statute, Michigan authorities seized the Pontiac. See Michigan ex rel. Wayne County Prosecutor v. Bennis, 527 N.W.2d 483, 485-86 (Mich. 1994).

First, the seizure provides the government with in rem jurisdiction, useful in cases where the wrong- doer is not subject to in personam jurisdiction.'72 Of more value to the government are rules about the burden of proof. Property may be seized on "probable cause" that it is "guilty;"'73 the owner who wants his property back later has the burden to prove that it is "innocent," under a more stringent preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.'74 The civil nature of forfeiture also means that double-jeopardy, due-process, and excessive-fines constitutional protections for property owners apply shakily, if at all,"' and collateral estoppel doctrine does not preclude forfeiture even after the owner is acquitted of the crime in question.176 Moreover, as Tina Bennis learned and as Congressman Hyde has docu- mented, innocent owners often lose their property to civil asset forfei- ture.1'77 Some commentators divide property subject to civil forfeiture into three categories--"contraband," "proceeds," and "instrumentali- ties"--with the implication that these three descriptions each convey a "taint" that distinguishes things as forfeitable.'78 The labels indicate 172.

Critics contend that forfeiture, a vestige of magical thinking and pre-scientific blame of the inanimate, cannot be reconciled with American traditions of pun- ishing only wrongful conduct and enforcing procedural guarantees for individuals. Amid this uniformity, a small number of commentators at- tempt to deal "rationally" with forfeiture law, rather than merely label it irrational. As we will see, commentators who address civil asset forfei- ture in rationalist terms ultimately emphasize its depictionalist essence. One may dispense quickly with most published defenses of the civil forfeiture status quo, as they amount to little more than a brief for law enforcement prerogatives."'87 Testifying in 1997 before the House Judiciary Committee, Stefan Cassella of the U.S. Justice Department re- counted that forfeiture has effected desirable ends:'88 if not for forfei- ture, one criminal might have thwarted a restitution order by depleting his savings; another miscreant impacted by Justice Department forfei- ture had been hiding, unextraditable, in Colombia; a third man, if given the long leash of due process, would have been able to move his money into a foreign bank account.'89 But seizure is not the same as forfei- ture; 90 and the Cassella examples can serve to defend only seizure. The remainder of Cassella's case for civil forfeiture, even more anecdotal, describes a happy alchemy: By the magic of forfeiture, marijuana farms turn into bucolic retreats for troubled city children; crack houses become residences for poor women undergoing drug treatment; and vacant lots held by crooked banks bloom into parkland.19' Cassella stops short of suggesting that, in the utilitarian paradise of current forfeiture law, my house might make a nice little outbuilding for the Internal Revenue Service, although nothing in his argument would preclude such 186.

Pritchard propound a dark, cynical ration- alism.'95 To Boudreaux and Pritchard, the law of civil forfeiture is such thoroughgoing nonsense that only an extreme form of public choice analysis-a rationalist device-can explain it. Boudreaux and Pritchard see forfeiture as a project that law enforcement authorities advance to promote their self-interest. In the American political arena, the ill- organized population at risk of having goods forfeited can never prevail against powerful government officials.'96 Officialdom wants to amass forfeited goods and cash because it can use their value to augment law enforcement budgets.'97 This revenue escapes attention in the political process, and citizens end up with the big-government bureaucracy they might well despise if they understood it.'98 The consequences, as Boudreaux and Pritchard explain, are unfor- tunate. For example, law-abiding residential tenants pay for forfeiture in higher rent because rational landlords who know that their properties are vulnerable to forfeiture will pass on these expected costs to lessees."'99 As for law enforcement, officials invest too much effort in crimes where the chance of significant forfeiture is high, and too little where it is low.

Why deal in marijuana when you can lose your automobile, no more and no less, for the more lucrative crack cocaine?202 Add another fact- the tendency of high-priced drugs to increase violent behavior among those who buy and sell them--and it becomes likely that forfeiture also increases the problem of violent crimes committed without calcula- tion.203 Boudreaux and Pritchard extend their rationalism into their study of the history of forfeiture. Many writers have been taken with such ar- cana as the biblical commandment to kill a goring ox as a wrongdoer,204 the ancient Greek practice of putting inanimate objects on trial,205 and especially deodand, the oldest method of forfeiture and the only one under English law that did not require conviction of the owner.206 Under deodand, an instrument that caused the death of a person was forfeited to the Crown.207 Boudreaux and Pritchard say deodand is silly: "the superstition that inanimate objects can be culpable for harming humans has been discarded with the advance of science. "208 Consistent with this brisk rationalism, the authors go on to say that deodand historically amounted to a minor share of the English law of in rem forfeiture; the basic, functional justification for in rem forfeiture was the admiralty 200.

In the best rationalist tradition, Boudreaux and Pritchard expose the perversity of civil asset forfeiture. Equally consistent with the dialectical tradition, however, they cannot defeat depictionalism, because they cannot account for the appeal of "superstition" within doctrine. Collective action problems help explain why the forfeited-upon do not unite to advance their interests, but do not explain why courts, legislators, and the public all accept this bureau- cratic rent-seeking. Notwithstanding the cries about senselessness, for- feiture must somehow make sense. Understanding forfeiture depends on the depictionalist belief that things are not exactly commensurable with rationalist devices like money and punishment. Another rationalist engagement with forfeiture law--an attempt at economic analysis of civil asset forfeiture - unintentionally illustrates the incompatibility of forfeiture and rationalism.210 The student com- mentator Catherine Cerna argues that because forfeiture takes valued property away from an owner, it should be considered a punishment, even though it falls under civil law211 and even though the Supreme Court has stopped short of endorsing this proposition.212 When seen as a punishment, forfeiture must be proportionate to the harm it seeks to ad- dress. Using an "external cost index," therefore, Cerna proposes a for- mula to calculate the maximum dollar amount that can be forfeited for a particular crime. The formula includes the magnitude of the crime, the probability of conviction, and the per capita cost of enforcement, as well as a multiple for the sake of deterrence.213 Ignoring as it does the entire set of existing criminal sanctions while insisting that forfeiture is a criminal sanction, this proposal ap- pears peculiar. Cerna concedes that her version of forfeiture adds an extra measure of penalty to those wrongdoers who happen to have 209. See id. at 119. 210. See Catherine Cerna, Note, Economic Theory Applied to Civil Forfeiture: Efficiency and Deterrence Through Reallocation of External Costs, 46 HASTINGs L.J. 1939 (1995). 211. See id. at 1939-43, 1950-54. 212. See Austin v. United States, 509 U.S. 602 (1993) (holding, by a divided Court, that a rule of proportionality limited the quantity of forfeiture that could be imposed, thus suggesting, but not holding, that in rem forfeiture implicates constitutional guarantees of due process and safeguards against double jeopardy and excessive fines); see also supra notes 174-175 and accompanying text. 213. Cerna gives two hard-numbers examples. A Chicago tavern worth $126,000 was once forfeited for the sake of a crime involving three kilograms of cocaine. See 4114 West North Avenue, 1990 WL 207377. Crunching her numbers, Cerna arrives at a maximum forfeitable amount of $62,386.38. See Cerna, supra note 210, at 1962. In another case, one married couple lost their house because of 7.5 grams of marijuana growing in the garden. See United States v. Cleveland Avenue, 799 F. Supp. 824 (S.D. Ohio 1992). Cerna calculates that the maximum forfeitable amount should have been $4,469.47.

But the more basic deficiency of the proposal is found in two of its premises. Cerna believes that things equal money and money equals things, a claim that even economists have dis- proved.215 She maintains that fines and forfeiture are the same;216 inex- plicably, however, criminal procedure safeguards apply to the former and not the latter. One cannot imagine any court, legislature, law en- forcement agency, or group of citizens that would accept Cerna's pro- posal. This rejection originates not only in political biases of the debate that Boudreaux and Pritchard discuss,217 but in the unintelligibility of forfeiture when policymakers deem tangible property exactly equivalent to money. By way of conclusion, some concessions to the rationalist literature on forfeiture are in order. Forfeiture has yielded utilitarian advantages, as Cassella argues. Public choice theory, well detailed by Boudreaux and Pritchard, explains the powerful incentives that help to keep current doctrine in place. Cerna's formulations inform the question of what is at stake when assets are forfeited: her claim that things equal money and money equals things may be misguided, as I have argued; but it is in partial measure quite true, as is demonstrated by endowment-effects ex- periments in the laboratory218 and auctions, markets, real property tax assessments, "book values" for used automobiles, and the like in life. Again, I stress dialectic rather than defeat. Much of forfeiture is amena- ble to rationalist explanation. The doctrine is depictionalist only in part and, consistent with the structure of a dialectic, rationalism exerts an on- going and shifting influence on forfeiture law. Rationalist treatments of forfeiture law, in sum, shed light on a baffling corner of doctrine with- out fully explaining its refusal to conform to rationalism. 214. See Cerna, supra note 210, at 1955. 215. See, e.g., Kahneman et al., supra note 28, at 1327 (naming this lack of equivalence "the endowment effect"). 216. See Cerna, supra note 210, at 1940.

United States Coin &amp; Currency, 401 U.S. 715, 718 (1971) (lending some support to Cerna's views: "[T]here is no difference between a man who 'forfeits' $8,674 because he has used the money in illegal gambling activities and a man who pays a 'criminal fine' of $8,674 as a result of the same course of conduct"). When the forfeited thing is not money but a thing accessible to sensory depiction, however, cases come out differently. See United States v. Bajakajian, 118 S.

Accident Law A final illustration of the representational dialectic emerges from accident law, which makes distinctions based on the entity harmed.219 This focus on the image of a body or a thing--as a recipient or inflicter of injury--is a curious exception within tort law, whose rationalist com- mitments have been noted.220 Tort law is dominated by negligence,221 and negligence illustrates rationalism more clearly, perhaps, than any other legal doctrine. Whereas depictionalism focuses on separate images, rationalism embraces unifying concepts;222 and as a rationalist device, negligence brings together an almost infinite array of images and behaviors. Courts redress the harms caused by wrongful adoption, deficient driving, edu- cational malpractice, accountants' liability, slip-and-fall accidents, mixed-up pharmaceutical prescriptions, crossed telegraph messages, in- adequate maintenance of residential buildings, careless entrustment of automobiles or weapons to third parties, mental health professionals' failure to warn third parties that their patients intend to do them harm, and other types of injuries under this unifying rubric. With its steady recourse to "prudence" and "due care," embodied in the reasonable man or person, negligence insists that accidents are conceptually (albeit only partially) alike.223 If mathematics can stand in for rationalism, then it is worth noting that the most famous bit of algebra in American law- a rule expressed in terms of three arithmetic variables--comes from the law of negligence.224 219. I have chosen the phrase "accident law" even though most writings about the problem of pure economic loss favor "tort law" or "negligence." "Tort law" includes intentional harm, whereas I wish to focus on unintended consequences. "Negligence" is underinclusive, giving short shrift to strict liability and the contracts theme present in many economic loss and products liability cases. See generally Harvey S. Perlman, Interference with Contract and Other Economic Expectancies: A Clash of Tort and Contract Theory, 49 U. CHI. L. REV. 61, 128 (1982) (describing the boundary between tort and contract). 220. See supra note 26 and accompanying text. 221. See ABRAHAM, supra note 26, at 47 ("most tort claims are for negligence"); JOSEPH W. GLANNON, THE LAW OF TORTS 61 (1995) ("Surely the most common basis for tort liability is negligent conduct."). 222. See supra note 19 (contrasting "the law of the horse" with doctrinal concepts such as contract and privacy). 223. Contrast the other two types of "tortious conduct," intentional torts and strict liability, which pay specific doctrinal attention to discrete categories of activity and injury. See RESTATEMENT OF TORTS, DIVISION ONE (1965) (enumerating "interests" protected by the law of intentional torts, such as the interest in freedom from harmful bodily contact and the interest in freedom from confinement); id. chs. 20 &amp; 21 (1977) (outlining strict liability for certain acts of animals and for abnormally dangerous activities). By contrast Chapter 12, the negligence chapter, and Chapter 16, addressing causation as part of negligence, speak generally about concepts such as risk and foreseeability. 224. See United States v. Carroll Towing Co., 159 F.2d 169, 173 (2d Cir. 1947) (Hand, J.) (declaring that "if the probability be called P; the injury, L; and the burden, B; liability depends on whether B is less than L multiplied by P; i.e., whether B &lt; PL").

Nevertheless, accident law em- braces exactly that fortuity. Accident law is replete with depictionalist interest in physical im- ages. For instance, invasions of land are covered by "trespass" when the invading entities, or the things damaged, are big and tangible, but by the less-favorable-to-plaintiffs law of "nuisance" when the invaders amount to small, intangible "particulate matter" that does not create tangible damage.226 The "impact" and "physical manifestation" rules for negligent infliction of emotional distress, still followed, bar plaintiffs whose emotional distress was not accompanied by contemporaneous physical contact or manifested in physical effects.227 Pure economic loss and products liability warrant particular attention, however, because of their relative importance within the law of torts. 1. Pure Economic Loss. Courts compensate plaintiffs generously for accidental harm to their persons or their tangible property: the cymbal-like crash against a thing can herald the beginning of liability.228 Economic loss caused by wrongful conduct that is unaccompanied by damage to persons or property, however, generally lies uncompensated where it falls.229 The depictionalism--whether it forced a choice between "incommensurables."

Flint, 275 U.S. 303, 308-09 (1927) (declining to award damages in tort because plaintiff suffered no damage to his personal property). The first case to state the rule of no liability for economic injury unaccompanied by physical damage was decided in Britain. See Cattle v. Stockton Waterworks Co., 10 L.R.-Q.B. 453, 457 (1875). A Connecticut case had reached a similar result in 1856. See Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. New York &amp; New Haven R.R.

Why then the denial?231 Well, to start, there are always our friends the floodgates.232 Merito- rious theory, one might say, but too many potential claims.233 This re- sponse is flimsy. Litigants can abuse or overuse any legal category, yet tort law retains categorization. Established tort categories such as prod- ucts liability and negligent infliction of emotional distress once pro- voked courts and commentators to raise a false alarm about floodgates.234 But the dockets have proved moderate.235 The rule limiting recovery for economic loss in tort prevails today in the United States, although this ascendancy has been shaken.

The first "answer" comes from the English scholar William Bishop, who claims that rejecting economic loss claims is proper because in such cases there are usually no net social costs, merely "transfers" from one set of firms to another.238 Economist Mario Rizzo has refuted this argument,239 and in any event one does not need training in economics to spot the costs of finding alternative sources to meet one's needs after a breach, as well as the costs of precautions (in anticipation of an unremediable breach) that potential plaintiffs must take.240 The second law-and-economics "answer," almost equally uncon- vincing, comes from an argument by Professor Rizzo that the rule of no recovery is designed to encourage "channeling contracts."241 Channel- ing contracts are indemnity agreements between those who suffer physi- cal impact and those who suffer only economic loss from that impact.242 According to Rizzo, courts want parties to enter into channeling con- tracts presumably because these contracts reduce the costs of litigation and therefore help to maximize wealth. The courts express this encour- agement by siding with defendants where the plaintiff could have "channeled" but did not, Rizzo contends, and siding with plaintiffs when channeling would have been impossible.243 A couple of basic flaws mar this argument. First, neither tort nor contract law shares such heavyhanded enthusiasm for efficiency in gen- eral or indemnification and other "channeling" in particular; the common law frequently indulges in wasteful and expensive proce- dures.244 Courts have not cooperated reliably in the enforcement of even 236.

Posner, Law, Economics, and</page><page sequence="40">344 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 87:305 simple indemnity contracts.245 Second, as Robert Rabin has pointed out, case law does not comport with the Rizzo "channeling" theory: courts have denied recovery to plaintiffs even where channeling would have been impossible.246 Yet this defense of a no-recovery rule has value, even though I would contend that Rizzo has exaggerated the strength of his argument. No empirical evidence supports Rizzo's claim that encouraging chan- neling is an efficient legal rule, nor that channeling is desirable for any other reason. Courts, accordingly, have no reason to endorse the Rizzo analysis when they decide pure economic loss cases. Despite this nor- mative vacuum, however, and despite Professor Rabin's point about de- scriptive inaccuracy with respect to case law,247 the channeling theory does contribute to a richer description of the economic loss problem. The Rizzo metaphor evokes physical convergence, a flowing-together of disparate materials. The ephemera of pure economic loss can, through "channeling," merge into the solid thud of physical impact. Impact, being the weightier of the two, dominates and consumes pure economic loss.248 Some writers have stated this point in normative terms, arguing that this physical wallop should matter. One commentator contends that even though economic loss claims can resemble harms to persons or prop- erty, "laws of physics" support the current rule. In this view, an impact against person or property serves as a blunt instrument to keep down the number of plaintiffs who could otherwise, given the complexity of fi- nancial interrelation, bring an infinite number of tort claims.249 Also borrowing physics jargon, Fleming James contends that financial loss is part of a "chain reaction" best addressed by business planning and in- surance.250 Economic loss, in both reported decisions and scholarship, thus wafts away from the tangibility of accident law.25' With the coolness that Inefficient Norms, 144 U.

Breached contracts, financial reversals, erratic supplies, and lapses of professional judgment in business plans fit calmly into the design of one's life. But a physical blow, even if "foreseeable," lands with im- pact. Its force is unexpected. A thing--the body or tangible property-- gets hit. Following this predilection, courts not only favor personal and property injury claims at the expense of economic loss (where the plaintiff "could have known better"),252 but also frown on contractual disclaimers of personal injury liability.253 By way of summary: Were accident law rationalist rather than depictionalist, it would choose one of two alternatives to the current rules that honor personal and property interests and disfavor "pure economic" interests. A rationalist accident law could accept the implicit Epstein invitation and merge personal, property, and economic interests into the same rule, looking in all cases for rationalist landmarks such as breach of duty, proximate cause, and plaintiff's-conduct defenses.254 Alternatively, a rationalist could distinguish, as Richard Abel does, be- tween injury to the human body and injury to "property."255 Under this approach, accidentally hurting someone's finances would be treated the same as accidentally hurting her airplane or warehouse: no recovery for either injury.256 In other words, one could choose either to expand or constrict liability for economic loss while remaining within the confines of rationalism. Current doctrine, classifying interests based on their tan- gibility, has rejected both of these rationalist courses.257 compensable harm is the floating element that carries harm to the product itself into the scope of recovery"). 252.

Products Liability. Unless objects matter qua things, it is hard to explain the emer- gence and persistence of products liability as a separate legal category with unique rules.258 Nor can one understand why the doctrinal label is not "producer's liability" or "seller's liability," given that the defin- ing trait of a products liability case is a defendant who regularly sells the type of thing in question.259 Rationalist rules from torts and contracts could have handled things-related injury without building a separate doctrine relating to injurious products. Yet depictionalism in this area has to date withstood rationalist incursions. By now some recurring elements of the representational dialectic will look familiar to readers. From rationalist scholars we hear the cries about perversity and senselessness. They argue that products liability ought to be abolished because it adds nothing to negligence law, while adding plenty to confusion and error.260 Why, then, did the concept evolve? Politics, say some rationalists; "products liability" made a con- venient banner first for social engineers like Judge Roger Traynor of the California Supreme Court,261 and later for tort reformers who needed a handy scapegoat for the benefit of their liability-dodging corporate sponsors.262 Reminiscent of the forfeiture rationales,263 this realpolitik answer cannot explain the appeal of "products liability," especially its resonance among constituencies with no agenda to advance. The dialec- tic goes on. Rationalists argue. Depictionalism survives. Unlike obscenity, forfeiture, and pure economic loss, however, products liability has been a locus of well-coordinated, intellectually serious reform efforts that seek to replace depictionalism with rational- ism. Many products liability reform measures emphasize rationalist goals like consistency and predictability,26 and despite the claims of considerations such as the use of the product (e.g. commercial v. residential), characteristics of plaintiff (e.g. manufacturer v. private consumer) and policies implicated in the case (e.g. contract law v. tort law)."

The products liability Restatement, which American Law Institute director Geoffrey Hazard has described as standing stalwart against "tendentious but unreasoned argumentation,"269 maintains a commit- ment to rationalism. Its boldest stance--a requirement that a plaintiff in design defect cases prove that "a reasonable alternative design" could have reduced or avoided foreseeable risks of harm270--emphasizes rationalist themes of negligence and risk-utility balancing.271 The rea- sonable alternative design rule stands in opposition to its depictionalist counterpart, a "consumer expectations test" that finds an essence within every product, independent of alternatives, tradeoffs, or other expres- sions of ratiocination.272 Continuing down the rationalist path, the Restatement conceives of three types of "product defect" --manufacturing defect, design defect, and defect based on inadequate instructions or warnings--of which all but one, manufacturing defect, can be expressed in terms of negligence, a rationalist tenet.273 In a comment, the Reporters of the Restatement de- fend the anomalous treatment of manufacturing flaws by explaining that liability without fault for manufacturing defects will "foster several Reg. 62,714, 62,716 (1979) (asserting that unpredictability stemming from inconsistencies among states in products liability law harms the availability of insurance). 265.

The second endeavor in reform, the effort to enact national prod- ucts liability reform, has hewed more closely to a rationalist line. In its iteration as the Common Sense Product Liability Legal Reform Act of 1996, which Congress passed in March 1996 and President Clinton ve- toed the following May,279 federal products liability reform proclaimed various "findings" about the current liability regime. These findings included arbitrariness, inconsistency, adverse effects on consumers, harms to international competitiveness, and burdens on interstate com- merce.280 By refusing to isolate "products liability" as a bounded cate- gory,28' and insisting that the United States needs a products liability law tailored to address the legal and economic policies of the nation, this reform act continued rationalist incursions into a depictionalist law that had been underway for two decades.282 274.

Tort reformers Victor Schwartz and Mark Behrens identify the Association of Trial Lawyers of America and "its allied professional consumer groups" as the cul- prits.285 Jerry Phillips suggests that federal products liability reform may be unconstitutional as of 1995.286 In his 1996 veto message, President Clinton averted to the argument that some reform provisions, particu- larly a cap on pain and suffering damages, unfairly burden female plaintiffs.287 These statements indicate that defenders of the unreformed status quo, as well as critics, find products liability law intelligible through rationalism. Contrary to both rationalist attack and rationalist explanations of the status quo, however, products liability remains at its heart still unre- formed and depictionalist, writing separate rules for detriment caused by tangible physical entities. As commentators have detailed, courts take pains to distinguish products from conduct,288 sales from services,289 "foreign" contaminants in food from "natural" ones,290 and workplace products liability from workers' compensation.291 The fortuity of a physical object in a case can divert punitive damages to a state 283.

Despite its many successes in the states and near-successes at the federal level, however, products liability reform has not abandoned the depictionalism on which it rests. III THE BASES OF DEPICTIONALISM The previous two Parts of this Article showed the triumphs--or at least the stamina--of depictionalism within the representational dialec- tic. We may now consider the sources of this strength. Depictionalism endures in legal doctrine because it corresponds to the way human be- ings think, learn, and coexist. These cognitive and political implications not only illuminate the successes of depictionalism, but also point up some of its worrisome characteristics, a point to be explored in Part IV. A. Philosophy and Politics Distinguishing between phenomena and noumena, Kant noted the limits of abstraction and the great power of images: "[W]e cannot cogitate relations of things in abstracto, if we commence with concep- tions alone."295 This assertion from Critique of Pure Reason suggests that the dialectic between depictionalism and rationalism in American law follows a more fundamental division in philosophy. Knowledge, as philosophers put the point, arises from both direct observation of phe- nomena and the application of intellect to that experience. While the phrases vary-Locke contrasted "sensation" with "the operation of our minds;"296 Kant paired "phenomena" with "noumena" and mun- dus sensibilis with mundus intelligibilis297 -the dichotomy endures.

Human cognition depends on knowledge by acquaintance. Sometimes misinforming and sometimes catalysts of insights, images of objects are necessary constituents of understanding. A person may build on knowledge by acquaintance to achieve a more complex knowledge by description of a related phenomenon; but as a method, knowledge by acquaintance is fundamental, and cannot be superseded by abstrac- tion. Three lessons follow. First, devotees of positivist versions of law and economics that pur- sue efficiency,299 framers of restatements and comprehensive codes who attempt to clean up disarray,300 partisans of free expression who want to limit censorship,301 and their colleagues in other areas of rationalist law reform must recognize that they cannot overcome a depictionalist legal rule simply by asserting--or even proving--its lack of rationality. As we have seen, the experiences of law reform pertaining to obscenity, for- feiture, and accidents bear out what philosophers might have predicted. Depictionalism sticks because it resonates with human understanding, even after rationalists demonstrate its pernicious effects in a particular legal context. A second warning from philosophy reminds reformers that the de- sire to supersede depictionalism with rationalism can lead to error, in a philosophical sense. Philosophers generally accept the dichotomy in perception described above, between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. More contested, but also widely held, is the philosophical outlook called "naturalism," which demands fidelity to empirical, observed reality rather than to a prior "first philosophy."302 Describing naturalist philosophy, Ernest Nagel explains that "the mani- fest plurality and variety of things, of their qualities and their functions, are an irreducible feature of the cosmos, not a deceptive appearance 298. See id. (maintaining that "real things" may not exist outside the world); Mark Siderits, Buddhist Reductionism, 47 PHIL.

Naturalism has its critics, and their rejection of this philosophical outlook- some of which has been aired in the law reviews305 -will not be adjudged in this Article. I want to say only that naturalist philosophy, despite once having been labeled "a species of philosophical mo- nism,"306 lends support, perhaps in a normative as well as a descriptive sense, to depictionalism in the law. If reality is indeed varied, eclectic, and empirically derived, rather than an unchanging absolute truth, then "senseless" depictionalist legal rules necessarily might make sense. This reference to the dichotomy between pluralism and monism307 brings us to a third philosophical basis --pluralism--for the depiction- alist status quo in American law. In its rejection of the unification that rationalism delivers within law reform, depictionalist doctrine takes a stand in favor of pluralistic philosophy. This tradition has enjoyed a strong philosophical pedigree for a century. Whereas monism insists on unity, wrote William James in 1909, plu- ralism allows things to exist "in a distributive form of reality, the each- form."308 Like depictionalism, James's pluralism denied the existence of finality, absolute truths, and "single-word answers."309 Affirmations of this philosophy of pluralism appear in literary works as well as philo- sophical writings.310 Of James's heirs in pluralist philosophy, Isaiah Berlin achieved particular distinction. Berlin's famous revival of an aphorism by the Greek poet Archillechus, "The fox knows many things, but the hedge- hog knows one big thing," restates the dichotomy between pluralism and monism. One might say that depictionalism knows many things and 303. Ernest Nagel, Naturalism Reconsidered, in ENCOUNTER: AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY 101, 104 (Ramona Cormier et al. eds., 1970). 304.

Berlin favored the fox, associating the hedgehog with totalitarianism.311 Berlin's dichotomy helps to extract a normative aspect of depictionalism. When Berlin emphasized the rela- tion between pluralist philosophy and pluralist politics--if the universe is multiple and unfinished, then society must be multiple too312--he showed that links therefore exist between (pluralist) depictionalism and a variety of social and political developments of the late-twentieth- century United States. As Leon Wieseltier argues, this eclecticism and rejection of totality can support a renascent liberalism.313 A similar link connects pluralism and libertarianism.314 Libertarian political theory depends on the premise, which its patriarch Friedrich von Hayek rightly called "non-rational," that the chaos resulting from individual freedom is better than centralized order. The eclectic players of depictionalism can scatter power among many, while rationalism centralizes.315 In preferring "democratization" to "democracy" as a nominal form, one political theorist argues that the task of democratic societies is to grow more inclusive, recognizing ever more groups, cate- gories, and individuals.316 These participants, varied and eclectic (like images, in this respect), are the constituents of liberal democracy.317 Complementing this endorsement of liberalism, some critics of lib- eralism make a similar point about power-scattering. Ethicists Willard Gaylin and Bruce Jennings attack the monolithic use of rationalism as a 311.

Commenting on the American decision to subsidize charities indirectly (through favorable tax treatment) rather than directly (through transfer payments), economist Estelle James mentioned pluralism as part of the reason for the choice: "I think one of the reasons why we use the indirect tax subsidy approach is that we are a very heterogeneous society.

Social liberalism twists this fear into a vague, generalized distrust "of all forms of social or interpersonal control."321 Applauding the former and condemning the latter, Gaylin and Jennings make a point that is relevant to the representational dialec- tic. Images--like the forms of social and interpersonal control that in- terest Gaylin and Jennings-evoke emotion, link up cognitively with other images and ideas, and imply controls on behavior of a more plural origin than mere state fiat. Although depictionalism is closely bound up with legal control,322 it cannot be reduced simply to authoritarianism. Sociological perspectives on the control of citizens' behavior under- score a similar variety of controls, which correspond to the eclectic in- puts of depictionalism.323 Writers and activists who prefer to focus on government find plu- ralism integral to their law reform endeavors. All decisions to make a change, including those to change legal doctrine, carry with them some peril. A pluralist ideology defends this risk with its premise that legal change usually occurs at different stages in different environments, so that its effects can be observed, and often remedied, before all of the relevant population suffers.324 Louis Brandeis invoked this strategy when he described the states as laboratories in the federal system.325 In 318.

Law reform must be pluralist, but ra- tionalist reforms are monist. Experiment and observation occur in the absence of certainty,329 whereas rationalist crusaders express their confi- dence that a legal tradition is senseless and that anti-depictionalist re- form can defeat that which is irrational and perverse.330 The experience of successful law reform shows the tenacity of depictionalism. The life of law reform, to recall Holmes, has not been logic but rather experi- ence.331 One reason that depictionalism in obscenity, forfeiture, and ac- cident law withstands assaults may relate to an inherent requirement that law reform be pluralist rather than monist.

Second, the philosophical tradition labeled naturalism finds congenial the depiction- alist insistence on particulars and empirics. Third, pluralism-a center- piece of political philosophy linked closely to representative government--illuminates the importance of depictionalism to law re- form efforts, even though law reformers often like to identify with the universalist abstractions associated with rationalism. Regardless of whether the endurance of depictionalism is a good thing, then, lawmak- ers and law reformers must take this continued existence into account. B. Learning Theory Psychologists identify numerous ways for human beings to acquire information. They deem verbal means, which law tends to favor, to be just one of several routes to cognition.332 Rationalist efforts at persuasion depend on words, a flow of speech-and-writing varied by an occasional foray into mathematics or symbolic notation.333 Depictionalism, by con- trast, embraces the tangible, the visible, and the concrete nonverbal im- age. Relatively indifferent to arguments, policies, incentives, causal relationships, consistency with that-which-is-similar, and the presence of commensurability that characterizes legal thinking, depictionalism aligns itself with the eclecticism of learning theory. Just as philosophers have maintained that knowledge by acquain- tance precedes knowledge by description, developmental psychologists have contended that the image is necessary to the commencement of learning. The grandfather of developmental psychology, Jean Piaget, argued that learning proceeds in sequence, with abstraction impossible until the child masters the concrete.334 Psychologists following Piaget built on this premise by recommending a pedagogy of "discovery," or cognition through interaction with objects.335 Feminist interpretations of 332.

Trial lawyers cite learning theory to praise demonstrative exhibits.339 In the law reviews, writers have bol- stered the depictionalist cause by arguing that current pedagogical practices in law schools neglect the power of visual imagery.340 Some law professors have castigated their colleagues by pointing out the disregard of visual imagery in law teaching.341 William Patton, a staunch exponent expand learning); see also Anne Field, Parents Not Admitted Without Child Guardians, Bus.

Interpretations of venerable teachings stress the value of the visual and the concrete in cognition,343 at the same time that information tech- nology-graphic, multimedia, interactive--moves society in a depic- tionalist direction. But regardless of which side of the dialectic is "winning,"344 learning theory has maintained continually that abstrac- tion and argument cannot vanquish the other methods of understanding, and they face an especially formidable competitor in the visual image. C. Legitimation As Bernard Hibbitts has noted, depictionalism is a source of legiti- mation in a visually oriented society that likes to see its law at work.345 Additional legitimation derives from the function of the image was a brake on rapid legal change. The three areas of law used as illustrations in this Article demonstrate some beneficial effects of this retardation. In obscenity and accident law, this delaying function has proved advanta- geous, and in forfeiture, delays have rendered benefits as well as detri- ments to doctrine. Once obscenity entered the realm of the First Amendment, for in- stance, concepts such as "clear and present danger" could have opened a wide avenue for rationalist reform.346 Constitutional obscenity law might have developed differently if rationalism controlled: government would have to show the harm of a work before suppressing it.347 Instead, as we know, an "exclusion" approach stayed in place, whereby the clas- sification of a particular thing as obscene determines its fate. Depiction- alism has hampered freedom, then, if suppression is presumptively contrary to freedom and if government does in fact take advantage of its power to suppress, or if it chills expression merely by having such power. Yet in practice this retardation of the freedom to consume puta- tively obscene materials has respected liberal values, and coexisted with 342.

For instance, although innocent property owners have been made to suffer by forfeiture, another class of victims--those from whom criminals have stolen money or property--have received compensation that would have otherwise been unavailable.352 I do not mean to echo the notorious argument, familiar from the law and economics literature on predatory pricing and insider trading, that it is all right to let Peter steal from Paul so long as overall social losses are zero or close to zero.353 Victims of forfeiture have suffered unjustly, but not in vain: American law underutilizes restitution, and forfeiture keeps restitution alive in both 348. The novelist John Updike wrote in 1986 to the chairman of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography to defend the effects of these freedoms as they developed over the prior twenty-five years: I think that the relative sexual openness of recent times, including the public sale of magazines and books which many consider reprehensible, has made my fellow-Americans more tolerant and genial, less condemnatory and ignorant than they were before, in these long-shrouded areas of human intimacy. It would be a great step backwards to rescind this openness, and to strengthen the dark forces of censorship. Quoted in PHILIP NOBILE &amp; ERIC NADLER, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA VS.

At the doctrinal level, forfeiture has engendered a rich line of Supreme Court cases that help to explain the boundary between civil and criminal law.354 Finally--and cynically, I admit--one may note that forfeiture creates middle-class victims of the "war on drugs," a constituency that may need to develop before this disastrous enterprise can be put to an end.355 The delaying of rationalist reform in accident law has yielded a clearer set of benefits. Depictionalism behind the rule of no recovery for pure economic loss has not only served to limit the number of claims (in a way that tends to burden enterprises more than individuals, and thereby to permit loss spreading) but also helped to shape gradually such problematic tort concepts as duty and proximate cause.356 Accident law was thus spared some of the instability experienced in California, where in the late 1970s foreseeability abruptly overtook narrow duty rules--only to be jolted out of its ascendancy after a conservative state supreme court judiciary took office.357 The economic loss rule has also kept contract principles relatively intact against the hegemonic tenden- cies of tort, an outcome with considerable support among practitioners and scholars.358 Products liability also keeps contract doctrine vigorous, whereas rationalist critics would subsume virtually all products liability into negligence.359 Depictionalism in products liability preserves a 354. The effect of double-jeopardy rights on the combination of civil and criminal penalties has received attention recently from the Court. See, e.g., Hudson v. United States, 118 S.

Kurth Ranch, 511 U.S. 767 (1994) (holding that "marijuana tax" violates Double Jeopardy Clause). A former Assistant to the Solicitor General who wrote an amicus brief in Bennis v. Michigan defends Bennis by arguing that a contrary outcome would have disturbed the delicately evolving doctrinal treatment of the civil-criminal distinction. See Richard H.

The history of court-sanctioned segregation warns against such complacency.36' Aware of this awkwardness, I offer my defense of depictionalist delay as distinctly subordinate to a de- scription of the phenomenon. Depictionalism is ineradicable, but also (and here it differs from de jure segregation in schools) not entirely pernicious. Even the best-laid plans of rationalist law reform have had unfortu- nate consequences. Whereas rationalism thinks of itself as a force for healthy simplicity - improvement through streamlining--it also adds to an existing clutter. Observers of efforts to improve the Internal Revenue Code have testified to the rarity of true simplification.362 One need not join the chorus of alarm about "hyperlexis" or a "litigation explo- sion" to worry about the problem of making more law.363 Depictional- ism, a far-from-ideal source of delay, curbs some of the tendency to haste and excess that is inherent in law reform agendas. IV FREEDOM AND THE REPRESENTATIONAL DIALECTIC Even though they stand at opposite sides in the dialectic, both depictionalism and rationalism threaten freedom. The Nobel laureate Friedrich von Hayek, famous for his writings on freedom,364 recognized this paradox. His student, Shirley Robin Letwin, has written that, ac- cording to Hayek, "freedom" cannot be counterposed to "power;" the choice for human beings is "only between different kinds of con- straint."365 Depictionalism and rationalism each offer a different kind of 360.

Below I elaborate on my view that the constraint of depic- tionalism, because of its opacity, is the more worrisome of the two. Having evoked the controversial figure of Hayek, I should clarify my use of the word "freedom." Of the many writers who have ex- pressed their interest in this concept, some (myself excluded) call them- selves "libertarian," a divisive and misunderstood term366 whose fraught meanings I hope to sidestep with the help of parsimonious ground rules. One working definition of libertarianism mentions three credos of the faith: "laissez-faire in economic policy, isolationism in foreign policy, and liberalism on the question of criminal prohibitions."367 The first two tenets being irrelevant to this Article, I focus here on the third, the one that I espouse. A liberal approach to criminal prohibitions--or to legal regulation in general--suggests a need to influence the representational dialectic in the direction of greater public justification. Such a move requires us to recognize that depictionalism does not reliably cooperate in this goal. A. The Peril of Depictionalism Left unexamined, depictionalism erodes liberty. Depictionalism purports to locate power, agency, or meaning within objects. These im- ages block the view of the manipulators who can stand behind them. Such an obstruction might take place by design. When former Attorney General Richard Thornburgh proclaimed, for instance, that "it's now possible for a drug dealer to serve time in a forfeiture-financed prison after being arrested by agents driving a forfeiture-provided automobile while working in a forfeiture-funded sting operation,"368 he set up physical things-persons, automobiles, operations-in a tableau, dis- tracting public attention from forfeiture in its rationalist sense. To the rationalist, forfeiture is a function of money, incentives, and violence.369 Officials have found it advantageous to hide behind things.370 More often, the statism of depictionalist legal doctrines does not line up with an official agenda. Government officials do not profit di- rectly from products liability or the rule of no recovery for pure eco- nomic loss. But even in these gentler doctrinal incarnations, depictionalism gives unseen power to the state. For example, with prod- ucts liability, government power expanded in the form of wider reme- dies and a larger writ for judicial involvement. Products liability shares this power with injured persons; when the term "products liability" 366.

The rule of no recovery for pure economic loss appears on the surface to be a con- trary development. Product liability lets plaintiffs into court; pure eco- nomic loss keeps them out. But this rule too augments judicial power, particularly to create tort jurisdiction beyond the planning of parties bound by contract and to make outcomes, as well as taxonomies, de- pend on fortuitous consequences rather than on events that the parties control. Similarly, obscenity law seems moderate in its effects--I have said so myself371--especially given the absence of a neo-Comstock figure carrying out an agenda of censorship at the national level. Yet obscen- ity, like other depictionalist legal rules, has augmented state power with- out providing for appropriate accountability in rationalist terms. As we have seen, obscenity law has declined to emphasize causal propositions about harm, looking instead for essence.372 This lack of analytic precision about harm has hidden the consoli- dation of government power. Agents of the government have sup- pressed works of great merit, imprisoned and persecuted and fined their distributors, and discouraged publishers from making available other material, forever unknown because unpublished, to an audience of read- ers.373 The lack of precision has helped to delineate artistic boundaries to exclude erotic material, thereby promoting an impoverished under- standing of what can be art and literature.374 And some writers have contended- against opposition-that the suppression of material deemed obscene has oppressed women, with the assistance and acquies- cence of the state.375 371. See supra text accompanying note 348. 372. See supra Section II.A. 373. "Not a week passes," wrote H.L. Mencken in 1917, "that I do not decline to publish some sound and honest piece of work," for fear that "some roving Methodist preacher, self-commissioned to keep watch on letters, will read indecency into it."

Images distract public attention from the state's tendency to augment its power by available means. For example, law enforcers do not request or demand bluntly that their budgets be hidden from public or legislative scrutiny; such a posture would provoke complaints about separation of powers. These officials can, however, hide behind forfeited property to effect a comparable result.376 In a similar strategy of ex- ploiting visible objects, partisans in the products liability debate thrust an image-or in Gary Schwartz's term, a myth377--against their antago- nists: the flaming Pinto and the creepy, spidery Dalkon Shield do battle against hot spilled coffee and noble, valiant drugs martyred to corporate fears about liability.378 In the next Section, I argue that rationalism can put these images in a more suitable context, and thereby help restore lawfulness to law. B. Rationalism and Public Justification The United States Constitution holds government accountable to citizens. Due process rights protect individuals in their dealings with the state.379 The constitutional law principle called "substantive due proc- ess" establishes an analogous requirement for law generally: law ought to be intelligible through reason.38" As legal scholars, notably Lon Fuller, have explained, reason would be integral to American law even if constitutional law had said nothing about it: without reasoning one cannot argue, interpret texts, create or follow precedent, link cases together to form doctrine, or predict judicial outcomes.381 Moreover, Sin, and Women's Liberation: Against Porn-Suppression, 72 TEX.

Candor forces examiners of the dialectic to acknowledge the com- forts of depictionalism within a divided political culture. Agreement that obscenity or pornography is bad, for instance, unites a fragmented population that might otherwise expend its energies on hopeless quar- rels; a demand for public justification of obscenity law would uncover conflicts, or at least a multiplicity of justifications, that might upset an unspoken compromise among factions.386 Even Professor Macedo, the public-justification partisan, admits that on occasion he would favor "papering over divisive questions."387 As Macedo elaborates, down- playing public justification offers other benefits, including "domestic peace" and the need to make liberalism an attractive "export- commodity" whose price in certain regions of the world might seem too high.388 Yet the demands of rationalism suggest that unexamined depiction- alism in legal doctrines threatens such fundamentals as citizenship, de- mocracy, liberal politics, and justice through law.

Much of this accounting has begun. For example, the Supreme Court has shown a longstanding interest in the interrelation of civil asset for- feiture and the constitutional rights of individuals. Its 1996 forfeiture decisions, Bennis v. Michigan390 and United States v. Ursery,391 recognize a need to make sense of this depictionalist category and suggest that more detail will be forthcoming from the Justices.392 In Congress, Henry Hyde continues to make a case for rationalism that has won praise for its pragmatic compromises and its inclusion of a wide range of views across the liberal-to-conservative spectrum.393 Other political actors could aug- ment these rationalist efforts. Instead of denouncing irrationality in her next forfeiture brief, for example, a litigator might acknowledge the ap- peal and resonance of depictionalism and argue for some attainable, moderate quantity of public justification. Trial judges who decide acci- dent law cases have opportunities to consider the burden of depictional- ist rules.394 To balance the blandness of these suggestions-try a little public justification, concede some of the appeal of depictionalism rather than declaim the irrationality and senselessness of one's opponents, horse- trade with the Justice Department as does Congressman Hyde-I men- tion a more disquieting idea: readers should reflect on what is probably the most potent phrase in all of depictionalist law, "child pornogra- phy." As I must hasten to say, this invitation is not to change the abso- lutist posture of current law, nor to condone or even tolerate material that falls under this label, but to open a line of thought about rational- ism and public justification. In New York v. Ferber,395 the Supreme Court held unanimously that "child pornography" warrants no constitutional protection.396 "For the first time in four decades," writes Professor Tribe, "all nine Justices 389.

This neglect is unfor- tunate, because Ferber illustrates how public justification can improve depictionalist doctrines like obscenity. The New York statute upheld in Ferber criminalized the distribu- tion of material depicting sexual performances by children younger than sixteen.398 For many members of the public, I believe, a simple af- firmation of Paul Ferber's conviction would have sufficed. Yet four Justices wrote opinions. These opinions are replete with rationalist ef- fort. As many antagonists of pornography have observed, the mere framing of criminal, abusive, or exploitative behavior into a "work" does not negate the prior fact of crime or abuse or exploitation.399 Here it is reasonable to presuppose the presence of harm. The New York leg- islature made a finding that children were in danger, and supported that finding with evidence.400 Tribe commends Ferber for having taken "careful note" of the problem of harm to underage performers in por- nographic displays.40' As Frederick Schauer has added, Ferber contains not one word about the harm to viewers that child pornography might occasion.402 Lacking better data that effects on viewers threaten third- party victims, the Court rightly adhered to the liberal and rationalist pre- cept that the ambition to uplift human souls does not justify the use of government power.403 A focus on harm unites the Ferber opinions and justifies putting Paul Ferber in prison. The Court also expressed an admirable rationalist concern for con- sequences and possible excesses. For instance, Justice White's opinion for the Court demands scienter, and so a defendant cannot be convicted unless he knows the nature of the material.404 The Court also expressed legitimate worries about overbreadth and vagueness, deciding in the end 397. TRIBE, supra note 107, at 914. Moreover, the topics from 1942 to which Tribe alludes- commercial speech and fighting words--are no longer considered utterly out of the reach of First Amendment protection, rendering child pornography almost unique. 398. See 458 U.S. at 749. Strictly speaking, Ferber is not an obscenity decision, because its holding applies to material that cannot be classified as obscene. See id. at 764 (noting that "[t]he test for child pornography is separate from the obscenity standard..."). 399. See MACKINNON, supra note 137, passim. 400. See Ferber, 458 U.S. at 757-58. 401.

Professor Schauer has praised Ferber for its subtle and careful handling of the question of harm. Settled-though perhaps erratically applied-First Amendment precedent allows the government to suppress speech that raises a danger of imminent harm.406 Ferber does not rely on this tradition, Schauer argues, preferring a more eclectic array of state interests in the regulation of pornography: "Not every enormous state interest can fit neatly into Brandenburg's incitement-immediacy- inevitability formula," Schauer continues, and Ferber thus contributes to a dynamic and evolving conception of harm."7 Absolutists might worry about public justification offered so imprecisely. But even for readers who want incitement and immediacy and inevitability, Ferber is a rationalist triumph. If a category like child pornography can withstand the rigors of public justification, then citizens should not flinch from rationalism.408 CONCLUSION It is perilous for a law review writer to express, however guardedly, her esteem for images. Despite the occasional claim that reason is in dis- repute within jurisprudence,409 divergent approaches to law unite around their common enthusiasm about rationality. Naturalist lawyers have written that human reason tells individuals what the law is.410 Formalists think that legal categories grounded in logic explain the past, and pre- dict the outcome of future disputes.411 Legal realists applaud rational attention to the functions of law.412 Critical theorists explain law in terms 405.

I have used the word "depictionalism" to describe this entrenchment. This Article has examined three areas of law where depictionalism flourishes, noting several others along the way.417 By clinging to objects and images, crucial elements of obscenity, for- feiture, and accident law defy or ignore fundamentals of rationalism. Obscenity criminalizes things without identifying their harm. Forfeiture ascribes guilt and evil to inanimate objects. Accident law has separate rules for harm to things and harms by things, putting plaintiffs in a stronger position when a defendant hits something tangible (the eco- nomic loss rule) and when a tangible entity hits them (products liability) even if the presence of a thing is entirely incidental to tortious conduct. Rationalist critics decry these postures, but have not succeeded in changing them. In an effort to explain both the development of non-rational legal rules and the patterns of argument against them, I have described a rep- resentational dialectic. Throughout Western history, rationalists have denounced images for their power: this same strength protects images from attack. Rationalists also denounce persons who yield to this power, using pejoratives like "superstition" and "idolatry." In the realms of art, religion, political theory, philosophy and elsewhere, these condem- nations have all achieved very little enduring success. I have attributed this failure to the enduring appeal--the necessity--of images in human understanding. Philosophers, political theorists, and experts in learning theory agree that the physical image is indispensable to knowledge. This strength of the image, however, should never be deemed pre- emptive: abstractions and verbalization are needed to make order of images. Moreover, the rationalist quest to make law amenable to rea- soned understanding is often admirable. I have tried to lend support to 413. See BAILEY KUKLIN &amp; JEFFREY W.

Law must challenge citizens to accept their human burden of reason, as well as defend the monopoly that law holds on sanctioned coercion.418 By referring to depictionalism and rationalism as paired within a dialectic, I have contended implicitly that the two inform, ne- gate, and support each other in a perpetually dynamic relation.419 The representational dialectic, connecting American law with cultural change by way of eclectic sources, helps to situate legal doctrine and law reform within their larger history. 418.
