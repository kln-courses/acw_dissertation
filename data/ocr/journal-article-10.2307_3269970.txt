<plain_text><page sequence="1">Numen, Vol. XXXV, Fasc. 2 THE DISGUISES OF THE GODS IN THE ILIAD WARREN SMITH This paper explores the passages in the Iliad in which the gods transform themselves into the likenesses of men and other creatures. I consider to what extent Homer distinguishes between a "likeness" which a divinity assumes, and that divinity's "true" appearance and nature.' In general I take issue with those scholars who lay great emphasis on the Homeric anthropomorphism of the gods. I argue rather that many passages point to the utter alienation of divine from mortal in appearance and nature; because of this alienation, the gods need to take on human form to soften the dif- ferences when they pass into the mortal realm. Though my paper makes analogies with the Odyssey at several points, I believe that the religious concepts of the Iliad vary sufficiently from the Odyssey (in particular, there is much less emphasis in the Iliad on disguises used to deceive) to merit consideration in a separate study. It must be confessed at the outset that the distinction between simile (he was like night, they were like bees) and transformation into another shape (she likened herself to an old woman) is often not as clear in Homer as his translators might seem to imply.2 The identical verb, i'otx, can be used by Homer with either meaning in mind; and there is a similar vagueness about related words such as &lt;c, i'xeXoq, olr. Aware of the ambiguity of his own language, the poet will sometimes (though not with any consistency) attempt to clarify his meaning by specifying the point of comparison. In one of the best-known Homeric similes, for example, the Myrmidons are like (d6Ltx6tq) wasps, 16.259. Since this verb can refer to physical resemblance (cf. 3.158, 11.613), for all that we can tell at first, the Myrimidons may actually in this passage resemble wasps, may have taken on their appearance. To avoid this impression, the poet enlightens us: he meant the comparison to refer to their "anger and spirit," 266-267. Consider a much shorter example where Idomeneus is likened to a boar-not in appearance but in &amp;xtl, his prowess in battle (4.253, expanded at 17.281-282).</page><page sequence="2">162 Warren Smith Clearly "likeness" can touch on any quality which strikes the poet's fancy, and, where the qualifier is not added, a passage which refers to likeness can be open to a wide range of possible interpreta- tions by the reader.3 In the many passages where gods are said to be like mortals, it seems most natural to understand the reference to be to some sort of physical transformation;4 but even here the god's behavior may be more the point at issue, as at 5.604, "and now Ares stands beside him like (iotLWc) a mortal man" (cf. 13.357). Does Homer merely suggest that in some general way, for a god to come down from Olympos and stands beside mortals is to behave like, "be like" a man? Or has Ares actually changed, in some undefined way, from an immortal appearance to a mortal one? When natural phenomena are involved, the concept may be even more imprecise. In 1.47 Apollo moves "like night" (cf. Heracles in Od. 11.606). What, then, is the point of reference; is it the invisibility of Apollo, or the slow, steady pace at which he moves, or his hostility and threatening mood, or all of these? Then again, the gods often resemble birds. In 7.59-61 Apollo and Athene sit in a tree like (otLx60eS) vultures. Have they really taken on vulture form, or are they merely like predators, insofar as one or the other will profit, depending on which champion falls? In another varia- tion, a non-human creature is momentarily humanized. The river Scamander "resembles a man" (d&amp;vepLt elaoa voq) when he protests to Achilles from beneath his waves, 21.213; yet he still behaves much like a river when he subsequently wells up and floods his banks. Perhaps the resemblance is rather in the human speech which he needs to use if he is to register his protest, in the manner of the horse Xanthos in 19.404. In 4.73 is a striking example of divine transformation which tugs us in several directions at once over the issue of its literalness. Athena darts from Olympos to earth "such as (o'ov) a shooting star" thrown by Zeus; and analogy, apparently, but it begins to sound more like a transformation a few lines later when Homer introduces the participle lxulta: Athena was "in the likeness" of such a star. When she lands (in the form of a star?) the Greeks and Trojans are filled with wonder. Such a scene, like Achilles' encounter with Scamander, passes back and forth between simile</page><page sequence="3">Disguises of the Gods in the Iliad 163 and transformation: Athena picks up speed, moves as fast as a shooting star: she is viewed by the army in the form of a star; yet after she has landed, with no word of any change, she is still Athena.5 To a reader who insists on strict logic, equally disturbing is a passage like 3.386 where Aprhodite, though supposedly resembling an old woman, yet (upon close inspection by Helen) still has her own lovely breast and neck (396-7); how, then has she "changed" from her natural self? Yet despite many ambiguities about the literalness of transforma- tion, or whether resemblance is really meant in a "physical" sense, clearly there are many passages in the Iliad where a god, on arriving on earth, does have, or takes on, a physical resemblance to a man; some sort of literal transformation has taken place, though as we can already see from the example of Aphrodite just above, the "resemblance" may be very superficial, the god is not "transformed into" the person in the complete sense, and the disguise can be very easily seen through.6 Sometimes the disguise might be called "generic," so that the god is simply said to look like an (unspecified) mortal (Ares in 5.604, 13.357); or, though still not looking like a specific known individual, the god may resemble someone from a particular age group: Poseidon in 14.135-136 looks like "an old man;" Hermes puts on the form of a "young man," 24.347; or finally, the god may choose to look like a particular individual, known to the person whom he addresses: Apollo looks like Periphas at 17.323-325; Poseidon looks like Calchas at 13.45. Conversely, at the very moment of departure when the god seems to start to fade back into his natural realm, the disguise is no longer operative: Ares looks like a dark cloud as he darts back to Olympos at 5.867. Or the superhuman speed of the god singles him out: this seems to be the meaning when Poseidon turns away at 13.62. When there is no reference to such change, the departure may at least follow close on a verbal admission by the god of his identity, so that he is no longer protected by the cover of anonymity (Hermes at 24.468 sq.) Clearly it is not a strictly consistent or logical theological concept at stake here; rather the poet explores a variety of ways to use the god's departure as a rite of passage to indicate the gulf between divine and mortal.</page><page sequence="4">164 Warren Smith The gods come down out of a vaguely defined void into the world in which we can see them, and when their divinity is recognised by a mortal, it is usually a kind of spark or essence-an unearthly beauty, a gleam in the eye, a way of moving, a divine "glow"- rather than a more concrete feature, peculiar to any individual god, which is singled out. We rarely get the sense that there is a "natural" way for each individual god to look so that one could distinguish, say, Hermes from Ares, in the sense that Priam calls attention to distinguishing features among the Greek warriors in 3.162 sq., with an emphasis on the variety of their heights. Yet there are some apparent, at least partial exceptions. In 1.528-530 Zeus has dark brows and ambrosial locks in his meeting with Thetis. Such an allusion is unusual, but one might expect a certain distinctiveness about descriptions of Zeus' appearance. He is more aloof and "Olympian" than the other gods; there can be no reference to his disguised appearance since he never uses a disguise, or comes down to mingle with morals, and when we see him he is always as he "really is" in his secret realm. Another passage which might seem to imply distinctions among the appearances of the various gods is 2.477, an overblown descrip- tion in which the poet delights in building up analogies to Agamem- non.7 The Greek commander resembles Zeus in his eyes and head, Ares in his girth, Poseidon in his breast, and is like a bull in his prominence over all. Surely one cannot press too far the features associated with each god here. Does the poet really envision some- thing distinctive about Ares' girth or Poseidon's breast, to single them out from the girths and breasts of other gods, in the specific sense that Ajax, for example, is taller then the other Argives by a head and shoulders (3.227)? The point is rather that Agamemnon exudes a divinity, a majesty, which makes him larger than life; this the poet chooses to convey by making an inventory of his features.8 The emphasis is on the cumulative impression made by Agamem- non as a whole, rather than on the size and shape of the individual parts. While there are a number of passages in Homer in which an individual mortal is recognized by distinctive characteristics such as his height or his back (and in the Odyssey, even the hands and feet of an individual may be singled out for recognition)9 the gods are</page><page sequence="5">Disguises of the Gods in the Iliad 165 all beautiful, tall, and without blemish. Consider the references to Hera's beauty as she dresses herself in 14.169; all the adjectives describing her are laudatory such as "desirable, fair, gleaming, ambrosial; " none of this helps us tell her apart from the other god- desses: the epithets of Aphrodite in 3.396 are very similar. When it comes to goddesses, one is as beautiful as another. In the case of mortals, however, it is their imperfections and blemishes which distinguish them. Odysseus' unimposing, stocky appearance is con- sidered a defect at first until he begins to speak (3.220 sq.) The most striking and distinctive individual in the Iliad is the ugly Thersites, who is so grotesque that his appearance suggests his deformed char- acter and contributes to the hatred others feel for him (2.220). Reasons for Disguise When a god in the Iliad addresses a mortal in the form of a man, what is his apparent purpose or intention in taking on this "likeness"? One might suppose that, for one reason or another, the god wishes to shield his identity from the mortal whom he is addressing; in other words, that the mortal appearance is a disguise.'0 This explanation would fit many passages in the Odyssey very well, particularly in reference to the many ruses by which Athena, appearing in the guise of a variety of mortals, intervenes in the affairs of Telemachus and Odysseus. And indeed in the Iliad as well, deception is, beyond doubt, the intention behind some of these false appearances. A few examples: in 17.555 Athena appears like Phoenix, in body and weariless voice, to warn Menelaos to guard Patroclus; and Menelaos is in fact deceived by the appearance, for he addresses her as Phoenix. Likewise in the passage immediately following, Hector is tricked by Apollo in the guise of Phainops (583). In the whole Iliad, perhaps the most obviously intended and sustained deception by disguise is Athena's malicious impersonation of Deiphobus in 22.227 in order to ensure that Hector will trust her, relax his guard, and be killed by Achilles. Deception here is not just an incidental byproduct of the disguise, but achieves a clear result which, unfortunately for Hector, is pivotal to the plot." Finally, it must be mentioned that a disguise may be assumed by a god with the intention of tricking another</page><page sequence="6">166 Warren Smith god. Thus in Book 13, Poseidon takes on several shapes, first that of Calchas (45), then Thoad (216); and we are told that it was Zeus whom he mainly intended to fool by these disguises (355-357) for fear of offending his elder brother by taking sides against him. However, neither Hera (14.153) or Zeus (15.8) has any trouble picking out Poseidon when they gaze toward the battlefield; distance is no barrier to them, but as we will see, mortals seem to need a hard look at close range in order to recognize a divinity. Yet despite all this evidence, it remains important to note that costumes and shapes may serve purposes distinct from that of disguise and deception. Some ulterior motive is especially obvious in the case of creatures neither human nor Olympian: when they intend to pass into the human realm, either come to earth or com- municate with men, they need to find a form which will enable them either to blend into their surroundings, or speak with human beings at their own level. In 21.213 Scamander "resembles a man" for no other reason, it appears, than because the need arises for him to burst into human speech to warn Achilles away. Earlier the horse Xanthos was granted a human voice to address Achilles.'2 Boreas, being a wind, has no natural body; he has to assume a horse-like shape if he is to mate with a mare. Hypnos puts on a bird-like form in order to look natural, and adds to the effect by sitting in a tree nestled among the branches, when he wishes to sneak up unawares on Zeus.13 Moreover, this same need for disguise applies to the spirits of the dead. The psyche of Patroclus, in its visit to Achilles when it urges him to get on with the funeral for his body, is like (xut~o, 23.66) the real Patroclus in every way, including his size and features; yet Achilles is horrified when he tries to embrace it and the psyche dissolves into a puff of smoke.'4 The gibbering wraith behind the false front is horrifying, like the witch Duessa in Spenser's Fairie Quenne, who in her true form is so ugly that her lover, on seeing her, laments "That ever to have toucht her, I did deadly rew."15 The psyche is not the "real" Patroclus, but only an eidolon which resembles him. The inside which ought to have been there, the liv- ing Patroclus, has been sucked out of the shade. Homer sometimes introduces a dichotomy between an outer appearance and an inner nature, as with the robots of Hephaestus who resemble maidens in</page><page sequence="7">Disguises of the Gods in the Iliad 167 every way but have phrenes inside; Hesiod's Pandora is similar, with a beautiful outside and a shameless inner nature.16 With a shade of Patroclus we get only half the dichotomy, since the only "inner nature" left to it is smoke and a squeaky voice. The situation is similar with the Dream which appears to Agamemnon in 2.20. This Dream is "like" (6Ltx&lt;Sc 20) Nestor in appearance; and yet there is no indication that the resemblance is meant to trick Agamemnon; the Dream itself drops any pretense of trickery early in his speech when he announces that he is a "messenger of Zeus" and reports the concerns of the king of the gods; it makes no attempt to speak from the viewpoint of Nestor."7 Nor does Agamemnon give any sign that he has been so tricked. In recounting the dream to his council, he dwells only on the uncanny resemblance to Nestor which it bore, as though admiring the skill of the craftsman who could make such an accurate copy. Agamemnon's amazement has a parallel in the confrontation between Achilles and the shade of Patroclus; Achilles remarks on the surprising "likeness" of the shade to the real Patroclus. In sum: there is no indication that "deception" lies behind Agememnon's dream's choice of disguise, except in the sense that the dream wants to appear trustworthy and talk Agamemnon into believing a rather incredible message. But being a dream it evidently has no natural form of its own, and thus is forced to make a choice of some form to assume before it can appear to a mortal. If such creatures as Dreams, Winds, Rivers, and Souls have an apparent need to put on "mortal" garb, or assume mortal shape, or speak in mortal voices, the same kind of need seems to extend to the gods as well in certain instances; at least the assumption that they use disguises to deceive does not explain every such passage.'8 There is often a kind of holiday atmosphere to a god's earthly visit. Their attempts to look human have a sportive quality which does not always seem consistent with deliberate deception. Aphrodite's flimsy getup as an "old woman" fails to cover up adequately her divine neck, breast, and eyes (396-7), and Helen knows quickly that she is addressing her old confidante and adversary (In the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, 81 sq., the goddess is likewise completely unconvincing when she tries to disguise herself as a "virgin.") Poseidon when appearing as an "old man" in 14.136 hints at his</page><page sequence="8">168 Warren Smith divinity by informing Agamemnon about the will of the gods (143) and departs with a terrible shout like 10,000 men, inspiring the Achaeans with courage; the appearance as an "old man" seem whimsical, serves no obvious purpose; the gigantic shout precludes the idea that the divine visit is meant to be known by Agamemnon alone. Even more striking is 21.284-298 where Poseidon and Athene descend to the battlefield. Here the poet uses the full form of the expression, 6tpqa 8'0v~pwatv zlnxtyv they were like men in body, apparently leaving no doubt that some sort of physical resemblance is meant. Yet Poseidon announces at once that they are gods, introducing Athene by name but referring to himself only as yw' (190), implying that a close look will make his identity obvious. Divine Epiphany and Divine Nature An attractive alternative to the idea that disguises are invariably intended to deceive, is the possibility that the human garb and appearance are meant to soothe the mortal's fright, somehow make the visit more bearable. Helen fears Aphrodite after she has seen through her disguise and the goddess speaks in her own person. The sudden arrival of Iris in 24.170 causes Priam's knees to trem- ble. Fear can be generated in these private visits; perhaps an epiphany to a larger group would create too great a panic, as sug- gested by the commotion resulting from Athene's "crash landing" in 4.80. In the famous scene (1.194 sq.) where Athene intervenes in the crisis between Agamemnon and Achilles, she appears to Achilles alone; none of the others sees her. It is a commonplace, among those who discuss this scene, to conclude that Athena's intervention at this point symbolizes the "victory of reason" trium- phing over anger in Achilles' heart.'9 To read Homer this way, it seems to me, fails to give full credit to the richness of his religious concept. We need to consider the scene as though from the goddess' point of view. Though it is unusual for a goddess to be visible only to one person in a group, the scene is actually only a variation on the more common motif that only those standing closest to the gods are aware of their identity. Since Athene must intervene in the midst of a heated argument, and Achilles is about to draw his</page><page sequence="9">Disguises of the Gods in the Iliad 169 sword, she has no time to prepare herself properly for the visit, and has to resort to the drastic expedient of distracting the attention of everyone else (compare Athene's trick of distracting Penelope in Odyssey 19.478-479) so as to be visible to Achilles in her undisguised, "real" self. Still another variation on this idea, that a god may be recognized by individuals but cannot appear before a group except in a momentary flash of departure, is the privilege accorded Diomedes in Book 5. He has the "mist" taken from his eyes so that he will be able to distinguish gods from mortals when he encounters them on the battlefield. It must be noted that gods in the Iliad never stand and make speeches to the enture army under their own personae; a scene like Aeschylus' Eumenides 397 sq., where Athene enters and addresses the company at large, would not be so handeled by Homer: he would have her appear in disguise, or else speak only to one or two individuals.20 It is also significant that when Achilles recognises the (undisguished) Athene it is not her dress, not her aegis, or yet any strictly "physical" feature of the goddess which triggers the recognition (eyvo 1.199): it is the terrible gleam in her eye, like that of Thor in Norse mythology, so bright as to give him away even when he is in disguise."2 A shrewd observor, or one as close to the gods as Achilles is, can see through what is external. Here, though, is no false front: he confronts the undisguished Athena. To see a god up close is to confront strength, beauty, and power on a scale larger than life. Exactly what the divine quality is, what one sees that is different in a god, may be only vaguely defined, but regardless of their general apparent lack of distinguishing individual features, they all share a common essence. Hector in 15.247 is well aware that it is a god who is addressing him "face to face" (avzr7v) i.e. apparently without disguise, but he evidently does not know Apollo by sight despite Apollo's repeated presence and efforts on the Trojans' behalf. It is the divine essence, a look, a way of moving, which is emphasized. When Oelian Ajax witnesses the departure of "Calchas" in 13.455, Poseidon's (gigan- tic) footsteps as he departs give him away; understandably, con- sidering how fast Poseidon walks in 13.20.22 In a comical variation on this, Hera and Athene, anxious to lower themselves to human scale, overcompensate by taking jerky little steps like shivering</page><page sequence="10">170 Warren Smith doves when they walk on the battlefield, not that this makes their disguise any more effective than usual. As often, the god only goes through the motions of a disguise, and recognition seems to follow almost inevitably, the recognition seeming to reflect a kind of tacit understanding between gods and men; by it the poet lets the reader know that the divine message has been fully received, has had its desired effect. Thus in 2.791 Iris liken herself to Polites but Hector "does not fail to know" the word of the goddess (807), i.e. it registers on him that he must do as she orders, and make sure that proper battle stations are assigned to each of the allies. Moreover the effect of a god's words can be a feeling rather than obedience to a specific message: in 3.139-140 Iris, in disguise again, "leaves sweet longing" in Helen's heart for her husband. We rarely encounter a distinction in the Iliad between the way a god "really" looks when not intending to be viewed by a mortal, and the supposed "false appearance" which they assume on earth. Homer refuses to accomodate our demand for strict logic. When describing the visit of a god, he fails time and again to make the distinction we are looking for: he changedfrom A into B. Instead Homer gives us only the second half: he put on the form of B. But even in instances where no disguise is mentioned, and a direct epiphany seems to be described, we are disappointed when we seek details about how an "undisguised" god would look to a human being. Evidently Homer holds back in such instances because he does not conceive that the true essence of a god is summed up by a set of physical features; something more profound is at stake. One acknowledges the presence of a god by sensing it, "knowing" it. This is a different kind of recognition from one in which the features of a portrait trigger our recognition of an old acquaintance. Even in the case of mortals, how one looks is often regarded as a kind of accretion on the body, not part of one's essence. Thus old Phoenix can desire to "scrape off" old age from his face. Similarly in the epiphany of Demeter in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, the goddess "thrusts away old age, and beauty flows all about her." But also "grace" is an actual substance which can be poured on the head of Pandora, the artifact shaped by the gods in Hesiod.23 Old age and beauty are "layers" which can be scraped off, revealing, not a "secondary layer" of appearance, but rather a "true nature"</page><page sequence="11">Disguises of the Gods in the Iliad 171 underneath. Similarly in the case of the gods, a disguise is put on, not to hide a set of features or a stature which lies lurking beneath; rather it is the divine "nature" which lies underneath. Concep- tually, if not logical, the scheme is at least extremely simple. We see it in the robots of Hephaestus (mentioned above, p. 166) who are so cleverly constructed as not only to have the "appearance" of young women on the outside, but the qualities of human beings on the inside. Likewise on the Odyssey Homer is careful to point out that Circe's pigs are not pork through and through; they merely have shaggy bristles on the outside and the "minds" of men inside.24 Much more in the case of the gods, then, can we see the principle operative: they have a kind of inner essence which transcends, shines through, whatever layer they choose to drape over themselves. Hermes in the last book of the Iliad, when travelling down to escort Priam, puts on the likeness of a young man who is beginning to grow a beard. This seems inconsistent with representations of Hermes in archaic art, as he is consistently depicted as bearded down to the mid-fifth century when, presumably, the more youthful literary god of Homer and the Hymn to Hermes begins to influence the artists' conceptions.25 Not surprisingly however, Homer fails to say anything like "he took off his beard and put on a more youthful appearance;" that is not his way. The resulting discrepancy between Homer's description of Hermes, and the older Hermes of archaic art, arouses the puzzlement of Leaf and Bayfield in the commentary ad loc., whereas Prof. Macleod in his edition of Iliad 24 rejects the idea that a beardless- Hermes could be intended as a true portrait of the god: "Hermes' youthfulness is a disguise, not a manifestation of his nature."26 Yet what is that "nature," and how might it be manifested? There are no other data in Homer about Hermes' "natural" appearance; in the god's other principal appearance to a mortal in Homer (Od. 10.272 sq) he puts on the same form again, as though it were the only one in his repertoire. Why does Homer leave us with such a gap in our information? It is surely implausible that Homer might conceive of Hermes, or any god, as either "invisible" or bodiless until he appears to a human; such concepts, as has been amply demonstrated by Prof. Renehan, are in any case foreign to archaic thought.27 Rather, the poet finds</page><page sequence="12">172 Warren Smith it either impossible or profitless to speculate on a god's appearance in detail when he is not visible to the human eye. There are cer- tainly minor exceptions to this ban, as when we hear about Zeus' ambrosial locks or Hera's lovely hair. But the essential point is, that Homer wants to imply the separation of human and divine by a gulf-one which the god needs to bridge before communicating with mortals. The poet makes this implication by causing the god to put on a mortal appearance before fighting alongside, or speak- ing with, human beings. By the assumption of mortal features the god puts a curb on himself: he subjects himself temporarily to the limitations of mortality which include youth, old age, identifiable facial features, and the ability to be wounded in battle. Thus up to the time when Hermes appears to a mortal, in a sense he has no "normal" way to look, but has to pull some sort of appearance, bearded or unbearded, out of his wardrobe for his trip to earth. The real essence of Hermes is his divine nature-not that part of him conveyed by tw'xqc "in the likeness of," but that part of him which one "knows." Homer often uses the verbs ytyv'aox or voe to indicate the moment when the penetrating gaze of a shrewd mortal senses the divine nature: Achilles knows Athene; Helen "recognizes" the neck of Aphrodite; Hector "knows" the voice of Iris; the mist is removed from Diomedes' eyes so that he may "know" the gods.28 Homer, acutely self-conscious about the distinction between outer semblance and inner reality, gropes at the concept of the gods' "otherness" from mortals by artificially creating a false front which the mortal must penetrate to know who the god really is. The concept can be vividly illustrated by a contrast with Vergil's method in two passages of divine visitation in the Aeneid. When Allecto goes to visit Turnus she "becomes" (fit) the old priestess Calybe; this would go too far for Homer who sees a disguise as relating only to appearance. Again, when Aeneas is preparing to depart from Dido, there is a rather bizarre variation on Homer: the image which appears to the hero on shipboard "looks like" the god Mercury "in every way," though whether that is its real identity is left in doubt.79 Whatever Vergil may have in mind here, Homer would not speak of the appearance of a god in such a way, leaving open the possibility that it might be only an image which would be</page><page sequence="13">Disguises of the Gods in the Iliad 173 found false when probed, in the manner of Patroclus' psyche. Homer's categories are more fixed. He can speak of a mortal, such as Achilles or Helen, looking or acting like a god, or Patroclus com- ing on "like something more than a man," indicating that either their beauty or military prowess goes beyond normal human powers. But an inhuman creature, whether it be god, dream, wind, or river, does not select a "divine" disguise for an earthly visita- tion; in such cases the change is rather in the direction away from the divine, toward the mundane, whether the new shape be human, birdlike, or equine. The gods, then, often need to select an "outer semblance" for their visits, and for this purpose one semblance might seem as func- tional as any other. Yet the poet is after all an artist, not a theologian; his understanding of the gods need not reflect perfect consistency, and divine transformation is a motif which may serve more than one purpose. The "likeness" of a god to one person or another may have as many points of reference as a developed simile. An analogy from the medieval period will be helpful. C.S. Lewis discusses the incredible license in which the medieval Hereford mapmaker indulges:30 he shows Scotland as an island distinct from England, in almost certain disregard of his own knowledge of geography. Apparently the mapmaker creates a geographical schism between the two countries in order to demon- strate their political separation. Homer's purposes, too, are far- ranging. The dream in Book 2 looks like Nestor probably because a Nestor-like appearance is a proclamation of his function, to pro- pose strategy to the commander-in-chief. Again, it is cunning of Athene to disguise herself as Deiphobus, dearest to Hector of all his brothers, when she wants to persuade him to stand and fight Achilles; and the poet calls attention to his special trust for this brother. Still a different function is served by the decision to show Hermes as "beardless" in Book 24. Homer contrasts his youth and vigor with the decrepit and wearied Priam, and even introduces a kind of father-son familiarity between the two; the dramatic irony thus created looks ahead to the naivetee of the infant Hermes of the Homeric Hymn. Homer's young Hermes turns out to know all about Priam, Achilles, and Hector; yet he speaks as though flustered at Priam's questioning.3</page><page sequence="14">174 Warren Smith The Monstrousness of the Gods The Odyssey gives us many glimpses of the gods, particularly Athene, conducting themselves among men on a basis more familiar than that in the Iliad. Hermes' claim in II. 24, that it is shameful for a god to be entertained by men, would seem rather out of place in the Odyssey where Athene often sits down, albeit in disguise, at table with Telemachus and his associates. Athene's leisurely conversations with Odysseus do not have any real parallel in the Iliad, where the gods scamper out of the way after delivering their messages.32 In general, the gods of the Iliad are at great pains to disassociate themselves from mortal problem; their otherness from men is a major issue. In recognition of this, we will conclude by acknowledging those passages in the Iliad where the gods appear least anthropomorphic. Homer occasionally reminds us that the gods need to make some changes to fit into the mortal world, due to their greatness in size. The size of the gods is rarely at issue in the Odyssey, though a passage like Od. 6.107, about the conspicuousness of Artemis among her followers, seems to imply that Artemis is unusually tall. But in the Iliad, there are suggestions that the gods are not only tall, but freakishly gigantic, monstrous: Ares' body covers seven acres when he falls; Hera taking an oath lays her hand on land and sea; Poseidon covers ground in gigantic strides; Hera and Hypnos cause the tops of the trees to shake when they walk; the personified Eris is a grotesque giant who strides between the lines of men; the giant hand of Zeus pushes Hector into battle.33 Everything they do is big- ger. When Ares shouts as loud as 10,000 men, Fraenkel takes this as a movement away from personification, "a transition from the person Ares to the thing war;" but this conclusion is unconvincing: Ares as the god of war is not the only deity with a high decibel count. Hera can also shout very loud (50 men), and stirs up the spirits of men; also the army is frightened by the combined lung- power of Achilles joined by Athene when he stands at the ditch and yells; Poseidon at one point is also as loud as 10,000 men.34 Ares, it seem, has a huge cry but not distinctively loud in comparison with other gods, and once again, Homer contents himself with qualities which the gods share in common, as opposed to singling</page><page sequence="15">Disguises of the Gods in the Iliad 175 out distinctive features of a particular god. If we may assume, then, that the gods in general have an enormously loud tone of voice, we may better understand their motive for confiscating the voices of mortals; when not intended as a trick, the assumption of a mortal voice may have the main purpose of lowering a gigantic roar to a level which others may understand. At the end of the Oedipus at Col- onus (1623) the mysterious voice of the anonymous god summoning Oedipus is enough to cause everyone's hair to stand on end. In Homer, at 24.170 Iris appears to Priam, apparently without any disguise, and though she tries to compensate for her loudness by speaking in low tones (tut06v), even this is enough to strike terror into Priam's heart. This compensation by Iris is comparable to the scene where Athene and Apollo reduce their stride to the steps of shivering doves. Though W. F. Otto speaks for many scholars in his insistence that such instances of divine monstrosity are "rare and never con- sistently maintained,'"35 the almost whimsical way in which they are scattered through the Iliad is a reminder that there is an air of mystery about the gods' true size, appearance, and voice; they can never be neatly categorized as looking and sounding just like ordinary people. Due to these aberrations, I believe it is misleading to say that the gods are fully "anthropomorphic," in the usual sense that word is intended; their mysterious otherness lies behind their need to adjust to human scale, and limit appearances to one or two individuals. One important passage remains to be considered. When Ares and Athene appear together in the shield of Achilles 18.516 sq.,36 we have a unique opportunity to see the gods as "fixed" in Homer's mind by their representation in art, with no tricks or inap- propriate costume. They are "huge" ([tLey&amp;ac) and "conspicuous" (&amp;ptl41X); but the people next to them are smaller (6;oX(oveo io~v). Not surprisingly, no distinction is made here between Ares and Athene; their common divinity is paramount. The emphasis is rather on the distinction between gods and men. The images of the gods have been worked in gold, and they are conspicuous in size, towering over humans. The two deities in the picture have not made the requisite adjustment to human scale, as though posing for the artist with their masks off and their radiance turned up at nor-</page><page sequence="16">176 Warren Smith mal level. The term translated "conspicuous" can also mean gleaming, bright; it is used of the thunderbolt, a a^ xa of Zeus, in 13.244 and 22.27. The poet has given us almost none of the infor- mation we might have wanted about personal appearance of the gods in detail: he merely impresses on us the efforts of the artist to show them as different, brighter, bigger, more conspicuous than men. The "undefinable" difference between gods and men, enigmatic but ubiquitous in the Iliad, is the impression with which we shall close.

Scott, The Oral Nature of the Homeric Simile, Leiden 1974, p. 7. 4 Dietrich (above, note 1) 56: "It follows that the various verbal forms and expressions for 'like' in Homer could signify either true identification or be intended as comparison only. In many cases the distinction between fact and simile is quite clear." I take issue with Dietrich's terms "true identification" and "fact" (Bannert, above n. 2, is similarly misleading); the gods, at least, never actually become mortals but only resemble them. 5 On the forms the gods assume when they travel, see esp. T. Krischer, Formale Konvention der Homerischen Epik, Munich 1971, esp. 20-23. Passages of divine "travel from place to place" in apparently altered from are all typed as similes by Scott (above, n, 3) 12; though he considers the possibility that bird-similes are a "remembrance of the bird as an epiphany of the god" (77). So. F. Dirlmeier in his helpful study, Die Vogelgestalt homerischer Gitter, Heildelberg 1967. Typical of many studies is the caution of M. Coffey's "The Function of the Homeric Simile", AJP 78 (1957) 120: "It is perhaps unwise to press either interpretation too hard." 6 Clay (above n.1) 130: "Possibly... Homer does not used eidos (of divine disguise) because it might suggest that divine transformations are mere illusions." But eidos is in fact used of the appearance of Hermes as young man in 24.376. Moreover many passages do suggest that divine transformation are mere illusions, i.e. disguises,; e.g. 13.357, 21.600, 22.10.</page><page sequence="17">Disguises of the Gods in the Iliad 177 7 On this passage see H.

The Odyssey scene presents the same difficulty as the scene in II. 2, namely that the dream, despite its appearance as a mortal, drops broad hints about its divinity (Od. 4.805-807, 825-829) though Penelope is not as quick as Agamemnon to catch on to its true identity. 18 The gods have qualities in common with other extra-terrestrial beings; see Griffin, above n.1, p. 62 on the gods and spirits of the dead as opposite poles, with humans balanced in the middle. 19 W.
