Snyder Highway Safety Research Institute Univ. of Michigan HUMAN TOLERANCE TO IMPACT has not been reliably established for large portions of the popu- lation. These categories of individuals - children, the elderly, and females of any age - all ride in vehicles and are often exposed to injurious impacts during automobile crashes (1)*. Hence, knowledge of some impact tolerance characteristics for these segments of the vehicle-using population would be of value in the design of injury protection features of automobiles. The research described in this paper was undertaken to obtain detailed information from the study of selected free-fall accidents to estimate impact tolerance values for these seg- ments of the population. ** The free-falls of * Numbers in parentheses designate References at the end of paper. **This study was conducted under standards established by the University of Michigan Medical Center Committee to Review Grants for Clinical Research and Investigation Involving Human Beings, and conformed to guidelines of the Institutional Guide to Department of Health, Education and Welfare Policy on Protection of Human Subjects. ABSTRACT - A study of free-fall accidents and resulting injuries was conducted to determine how useful these types of data could be in establishing human injury tolerance limits. "Tolerance" was examined primarily for children at two levels - reversible injury and threat to survival. The specific objectives were to investigate specific free-falls in sufficient depth to permit biomedical or mathemati- cal reconstruction of the fall, simulate selected free-falls to estimate impact response, and compare predicted responses with observed injuries as a means of estimating human tolerance levels. From more than 2100 reported free-falls, 110 were investigated on-site. Seven head-first and three feet-first falls were then simulated using the MVMA 2-D Crash Victim Simulator. News- paper reports of free-falls showed that males fell six times as often as females and most often while at work. Children fell from windows and balconies more often than from any other hazard. Case investigations showed that children were generally injured less severely than adults under similar fall circumstances, and tended to land on their heads a greater proportion of the time. The investigations also indicated that for impacts onto rigid surfaces: Both children and adults may be expected to suffer skull fractures in head-first falls of greater than 10 ft; adults are likely to incur lumbar spine fracture if they land in a sitting position after falling 10 ft; and adults will probably sustain pelvic fracture in feet-first falls of more than 30 ft. The head- first fall simulations predicted skull acceleration responses that were higher than previously considered survivable, although five of the six child subjects whose falls were simulated did sur- vive. Analysis of simulation results indicated that, for some children under eight years old, peak accelerations of as high as 350 G, with a rate of onset of up to 200 000 G/s and a duration of up to 3 ms (approximate HIC = 1700-2800), would produce only moderate, reversible injury (as de- fined by AIS 2) . For this same age group, the survival limit for head impacts - the level at which most people would sustain AIS 5 or greater injuries - was estimated to be as high as 600 G peak acceleration and 300 000 G/s for a duration of up to 3 ms (approximate HIC = up to 11 000). In feet- first simulations, the model predicted forces in the leg bones that correlated with observed injuries. The combination of in-depth on-site investigation and computer simulation of representative cases was found to be an effective method of studying impact injury tolerance.

The study methods included in-depth on-site investigation and biomedical and mathematical reconstruction. A free-fall was defined for purposes of this study as any unimpeded fall, jump, or dive. This definition excluded falls to the same level, falls down stairs, or tumbling falls down hillsides. In this study, two limits of human impact tolerance were considered. The first was tolerance limits for moderate reversible injuries as described by Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) rating of 2 or 3 (2). These are limits at which some people will sustain only such moderate injuries. The second was survival limits which are levels at which many individuals sustain critical injuries in which survival is uncertain. Such injuries are described by AIS ratings of 5. This latter group includes injuries which may result in long-term or permanent disability, but which do not always result in death. Results related to both of these definitions of tolerance limits will be presented. They apply to fairly severe impact environments for selected portions of the popu- lation, like children. Because of the variability among and within individuals in their susceptibility to injury, large and representative samples are necessary to establish the upper and lower extremes of human tolerance. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that tolerance limits obtained in this and other studies involving relatively limited samples should not be misinterpreted as minimum values that can be experienced by most of the population without serious consequences. This is particularly the case when considering tolerance limits for reversible injuries. Impact tolerance information has traditionally been obtained from experimental tests of human volunteers, cadavers, and animals and from investigation of auto crashes, which permits assessment of injuries in relation to crash dynamics. Each of these sources provide data which are subject to distinct limitations. Human volunteer testing has involved young male military personnel almost exclusively, and testing protocol requires impacts to be restricted to less than injury-producing levels. Cadaver testing can be used for impacts that would produce injury in a living human, but cadaver subjects are usually elderly. Also, uses of cadaver test data are restricted since cadavers are non- functioning sys- tems. Impact testing with anesthetized animals has the advantage of producing injury within a living system, but presents problems in scaling animal response to human response. Automotive crash investigation provides injury description but presents problems in estimating the forces to which the injured occupants have been subjected. The present study has used the investigation of free-falls for collection of injury data related to specific impacts with known surfaces. Except for pioneering work by DeHaven (3), extensive studies by Snyder of extreme falls, water impacts, and snow impacts (4-8) , and some clinical reviews (9-12), free-fall investigations have received comparatively little attention as a source of impact tolerance data. Free-falls are among the few impact situations which can at the same time be well-described in terms of conditions at impact, be effectively investigated post-impact, and be structured to include different segments of the population for which little tolerance data exist. This method was especially suitable for studying impacts of children, since free-falls occur to children of all ages and sexes over a wide range of impact directions and forces. Snyder's analysis of the falls of 34 children aged 8 months to 12 years (13) and a clinical study by Smith (14) constituted virtually the only available data concerning tolerance of children to direct impact. Computerized modeling of the human under impact conditions has become much more sophisticated since the data from DeHaven' s and Snyder's initial studies were published. Because some free-falls could be described in enough detail to provide input data for a gross-motion computer model, we believed that simulations of free-falls could provide quantitative information related to human tolerance. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify specific types -of free-falls, investigate them in sufficient detail to permit reconstruction of the fall, simulate a selected number of free- falls to estimate impact responses, and compare the predicted responses with observed injuries as a means of estimating human tolerance levels. METHODOLOGY Detailed on-site investigation was used to gather impact-related injury information. News- paper articles received from a news clipping service provided the main source of potential cases. From the average of 60 free-fall clippings received each week, the few falls which satisfied the criteria established for on-site investigation were selected. In order to be considered for detailed study, the fall had to be a free-fall according to the definition noted above and the fall location, fall distance, and impacted surface all had to be determinable. In addition, preference was given to falls of females, children, and the elderly in which the victim survived the fall. Thus, a "typical" case selected for investigation would 3113</page><page sequence="3">3114 D. R. FOUST, ET AL. be the fall of a child from a second- story window to a concrete sidewalk. On-site investigations typically consisted of three elements: Interviews, measurements, and medical data. The subject (in the case of a child, the subject's parents) was contacted in person and interviewed for details of fall location, contact sequences, injuries, and degree of recovery. Any available witnesses, rescue personnel, investigating police officers or others with knowledge of the fall or its consequences were also interviewed. Measurements were taken at the scene of the fall, after establishing the exact locations of the beginning and end of the fall. Medical information was obtained from the subject during the interview and from hospital medical records after the subject authorized release of the records. Simulation of certain free-falls using a computerized model of the human body was the method chosen to estimate dynamic response parameters for fall victims. The model used was the MVMA Two-Dimensional Crash Victim Simulator, Version 3, a whole-body model which features nine masses and ten segments in the body linkage, energy- absorbing joints, and con- tact- sensing ellipses which both define the body profile and incorporate non-linear material properties. This model has been described in detail in a previous Stapp Conference and in othe r publications (15-17). At the time that the simulations were being planned, the MVMA model had never been used to simulate a free-fall event. Therefore, a two-phase simulation program was adopted. First, a series of fully-instrumented drop tests was performed using the HSRI "Repeatable Pete" anthropomorphic dummy (18). Four of these tests were then simulated with the model, using known dummy design and response data. Prone drops from 5 ft (1.5 m) and 8 ft (2.4 m) and feet-first drops from 5 ft were all successfully simulated. Predicted responses matched measured responses, normally to within 5%, and so the model's ability to accurately predict dummy free-fall impact dynamics was established. In the second phase, human anthropometric data and response characteristics were substituted and the model was used to reconstruct several free-falls from investigated cases. Detailed discussions of the dummy drop test simulations and the me- thods used to develop the human simulation data are included in the final report for the project (19). RESULTS AND DATA ANALYSIS Useful data were obtained from three primary sources during the course of the study. News- paper reports were received for 2134 falls which occurred in the one-year period from August 1975 through July 1976. They provided general information about fall frequency, general characteristics of reported falls, and limited information about fall victims. On-site investigations were conducted for 110 cases, and they provided very detailed information about the fall environment and the subjects involved for a selected subset of reported falls. Finally, ten of the investigated falls were simulated with the computer model. These provided detailed estimates of impact response characteristics. It is not possible to include in this paper all of the results of the study. The first part of this section will provide general background on the scope of the free-fall problem as reported in newspapers and some general results from the case investigations. The remainder will be devoted to detailed results and data analysis concerning head impacts and feet- first impacts, from both case investigations and computer simu- lations. GENERAL RESULTS There were 2134 newspaper reports of individual free-falls which occurred in a 12-month period. Of course, this sample was not a random sample in the statistical sense, since only falls that were reported and were noticed by the clipping service were included. This tended to bias the sample toward falls from greater height and more spectacular circumstances of survival. Also, by definition, the large numbers of falls on the same level, such as slipping on a sidewalk, were eliminated from consideration. Despite the limitations imposed by the sampling procedure, it is still possible to make several interesting observations. The sex and the age (at least to general level of maturity - child, teen, or adult) of fall victims was reported in 99% of the news clippings. Free- fall frequency, categorized by age and sex, is shown in Fig. 1. In every age category, more males are represented than females. During the "working years" from ages 20-69, in every age category, males experienced 90% of falls. Thirty- nine percent of all reported falls occurred to youths and young adults (13-29 years). The fall descriptions in the clippings indicate that these are the ages at which both males and females undertake the most hazardous recreational and occupational activities. This age group consti- tutes the segment of the population that is most at risk of being involved in a free-fall. Similar sex and age distribution data are shown in Fig. 2 for the 110 investigated cases. The falls of 86 males and 24 females were studied.

Falls by children and the elderly received the greatest attention in the investi- gations: 75% of the subjects were persons either under 19 or over 50 years of age. Forty percent of all subjects were children under age six, and females were a large percentage of this group. Most of the falls of adult males aged 20-49 were included because of close similarities between their falls and the falls of children. Falls reported in newspapers were related to three general types of hazards - falls while at work, falls related to recreational activities, and falls from buildings and other structures. A summary of hazard findings is shown in Table 1. Free-falls that occurred to persons engaged in their normal occupations constitute the largest group, 757 reported falls or 36% of the total. The pre- dominance of males in hazardous occupations is noted: 99% of those who fell at work were males. Falls related to recreational activities numbered</page><page sequence="5">3116 D. R.

Non-occupational falls from buildings and other structures, such as bridges, constitute another large group: 658 reported falls, 31% of the total. This last group is further sub- divided by age to illustrate that many children are involved in these falls. The above results show that there is a need to provide better fall protection for young people in and around buildings and for workers at their jobs. Most of the falls that were selected for on-site investigation were those from existing structures, since many falls of children were of this type. Although few occupational falls were studied, they were the source of many of the adult cases. Few recreational falls were investigated, since they often involved locations far from the subjects home or had indefinable impact surfaces. The selection process tended to screen out falls of less than 10 ft (3 m) and greater than 30 ft (9 m). Table 2, Part 1, shows that 75% of the on-site investigations were for falls of less than 30 ft, and 52% of the cases were for falls of from 10 - 20 ft (3-6 m). Nine falls of greater than 50 ft (15 m) involved survival under unusual circum- stances and were therefore of special interest. Part 2 of Table 2 indicates that 76 of the investi- gated falls (69.1%) involved initial contact with a rigid surface. Only 18% of the investigations involved impacts of other than hard surfaces. For the purposes of the summary of Table 2, the following arbitrary definitions were adopted: "rigid" surfaces were unyielding ones such as concrete, asphalt, steel, roofs, and thick ice; "hard" surfaces were hard-packed and frozen soil or wood platforms; "moderate" surfaces were damp soils, bushes, and sand; and the "crushable" surfaces were automobile roofs and hoods.

In each case, the victim neither lost consciousness nor suffered bone fractures. General information about fall victims for the investigated falls is contained in Table 3, which shows the investigators' assessments of initial or primary body contact. Despite an effort to include contacts of all parts of the body for both children and adults, most of the children whose falls were investigated landed on their heads and most of the adults landed on their feet or sides. The investigation data also showed that children</page><page sequence="6">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 3117 Table 3 - Impact Patterns for Subjects in Investigated Cases Estimated Initial or Primary Body Contact Upr.

Many subjects suffered multiple major injuries. tended to land head-first regardless of fall distance, but especially in falls of less than 20 ft. Examination of fall circumstances also showed that many of these children started falling from a standing position and rotated during the fall to land on their heads. The relatively larger head mass and head dimensions of children compared to adults probably contributed to the greater liklihood of children head-first. Adults, perhaps because of better coordination, tended to land on their feet, or at least on their sides while attempting to achieve a feet-first attitude. Major injuries sustained by subjects in the investigated cases are shown in Table 4. All of the injuries included in the table were rated at least AIS=2 (moderate). Nearly half of the subjects sustained significant head injuries - skull fracture and/or concussion. A majority of such head injuries occurred to children, but teenagers and adults incurred serious head injuries far out of proportion to their percentage of head-first falls. In several cases, subjects received head injuries because of secondary impact of the head after they initially landed on their feet or side. The 27 injuries classified as internal injuries or spinal fractures are primarily pneumo/ hemothorax or fractures of the lumbar vertebrae or ribs. Three adult subjects suffered fractures of the cervical spine. No children in the investi- gated cases had any neck injuries other than minor pain; children apparently injure their heads but not their necks in free-fall accidents. Among the investigated cases, only three diagnoses of internal injuries involved other than the lungs and/or ribs. Pelvic fractures accounted for only 10% of major injuries, and they occurred almost</page><page sequence="7">3118 D. R. FOUST, ET AL. exclusively to adults. The single pelvic fracture to a child occurred when a 12 1/2 year female fell nearly 34 ft and landed feet-first, fracturing both pubic rami. Most pelvic fractures were caused by the subject impacting the hip in a side-first fall. Fractures of the upper extremities occurred when subjects extended their arms to break their falls. The wrist or radius and ulna of one arm were often fractured in side-first falls, and a few bilateral lower arm or wrist fractures occurred when the subject attempted to break a head-first fall. Very few falls produced fractures of the humerus or clavicle. A majority of lower extremity fractures occurred to adults and teenagers, since they tended to land on their feet and sides. Five of the six lower extremity fractures noted in children were broken femurs resulting from knee impacts while falling sideways. There were no femur fractures noted in teenagers and only four in adults. Eight adults sustained fractures of one or both lower legs or ankles. Most lower extremity fractures to teenagers and adults occurred as a result of direct impacts to the feet or knees. USE OF GENERAL RESULTS TO PREDICT INJURY SEVERITY It is of interest to know if parameters which may be easily determined from field investigation of the fall could be used to predict what injuries might occur from the impact. Impact velocity, momentum transfer, and absorbed impact ener- gy may all be easily determined from fall distance and the weight of the victim, provided the victim lands on a rigid surface (thereby causing virtually all of the energy to be absorbed by his body rather than by the impacted surface) . These three quantities were therefore selected as potential predictors of injury. Two numerical indicators of injury severity which are currently in wide- spread application in auto crash investigations were used to determine whether or not there was any correlation with the three physical quantities. The first of these was the Overall Abbreviated In- jury Scale (OAIS), which is an assessment of the total state of injury of a crash victim and which is either equal to or greater than the maximum AIS attributed to a single body region (2). The other was the Injury Severity Score, or ISS, which has been developed and tested by Baker, et al (20). The ISS is calculated from the highest AIS values of the three most severely injured body regions of an individual, has been developed as a descriptor of overall injury severity and has been shown by several investigators to be a good predictor of mortality (21). An analysis was performed to determine if the three potential indicators of injury correlated with OAIS or ISS values. The analysis was performed using injury, fall distance and body weight values for 81 subjects who landed on either rigid or hard surfaces as defined for Table 2. The subjects were classified into two age groups, either age nine and younger or age ten and older. Age nine was chosen because of estimates that skull strength approaches adult- hood strength after age nine. Falls were divided into two classes of body orientations at impact, head-first and other than head-first. This analysis resulted in graphs of predictor (velocity, momentum, or energy) versus descriptor (OAIS or ISS), each for two categories of age and two categories of body impact position. This analysis resulted in 24 graphs. If the potential indicators selected were good predictors, one would expect to see a positive relationship between the independent and dependent variables - for example, an increase in impact velocity resulting in an increased indication of injury. However, only 9 of the 24 graphs showed any positive relationship. Impact velocity tended to correlate with both OAIS and ISS for head impacts of persons age ten and older (Fig. 3), but no other correlations were found. Momentum transfer (mass x velocity) did not correlate with injury, the only suggestion of a positive relation- ship being for OAIS in head-first falls (age 10 and older). 2 Kinetic energy (1/2 mass x vel ) showed some positive relationship to both OAIS and ISS for subjects age 10 and older. Graphs for head impacts are shown in Fig. 4 and for impacts other than to the head in Fig. 5. The only other positive relationship was between kinetic energy and ISS - a weak trend for head-first impacts, age nine and younger. Although it was difficult to generalize about possible injury prediction from these easily- determined whole-body dynamic response characteristics, several observations can be made: (1) There were large amounts of scatter in all of the plots. This suggests that there are wide biological variations among individuals in their susceptibility to injury. Consequently, in similar falls the injuries sustained may be very different. (2) Positive relationships between OAIS or ISS and the physical quantities were observed for only those quantities in which velocity was the dominant factor. Body mass apparently had less of a determining influence on injury in a fall than did impact velocity. (3) Of the nine trends observed in the 24 graphs, only one involved children age nine or younger.

R. FOUST, ET AL. which are probably related to growth and development, these simplified prediction methods apparently are not adequate for predicting injury to younger children. (4) Six of the nine observed trends were for head-first impacts. This result is not surprising, since in these impacts the most severe injuries are usually to the head. In these cases, OAIS and ISS are primarily determined by just one injury, and overall injury severity should be easier to predict. (5) Fig. 4A shows that, in this sample of head-first falls onto rigid surfaces by persons age 10-59, most people sustained an OAIS 5 or greater injury when the absorbed energy was 1500 ft-lb or greater. There are two instances where less energy was absorbed and these individuals sustained less severe injury. Because there were only two cases in this lower range, it is not possible to predict how frequently the more severe injuries might occur below 1500 ft-lb of absorbed energy. The two subjects who sustained energy levels higher than 2500 ft-lb were fatally injured. It should be noted that 1000 ft-lb of energy were exceeded by adults in all but the lowest- velocity falls. For example, an average- sized adult male (160 lb) who falls 6 ft onto a rigid surface will absorb 1000 ft-lb of energy. From the foregoing discussion it is evident that relatively simple methods of predicting injury are usually not adequate; the problem of injury prediction is apparently more complicated than can be successfully investigated using mea- sures for impact severity that are easily defined in terms of impact velocity. Head injury prediction based on mathematical simulation was also attempted and is described below. HEAD IMPACT RESULTS AND ANALYSIS Major emphasis in the study was placed on gathering data about the effects of head-first impact onto rigid surfaces. Forty of the investigated cases and 7 of the 10 simulated cases involved head-first impacts. INVESTIGATED CASES - For each of the 31 cases in which a subject fell head-first onto a rigid surface, the resulting injuries included skull fracture or concussion or both. Fall distances ranged from 6 ft (1. 8 m) to more than 30 ft (9 m) and a wide range of injury severity was observed at all levels. Generally, the most serious injuries resulted from the longest falls. It was also gener- ally true that, in falls from similar heights, younger children were less severely injured than older children and children were less severely injured than adults. At lower fall distances, children often received simple skull fractures or mild concussion and were outwardly normal within a few weeks of the fall. However, it should be noted that such injuries can produce long- term effects that are not immediately apparent. Adults in the same types of falls generally had more serious injuries including cerebral contusion, cerebral hemorrhage, and coma. Similar injuries were also seen in children, but usually only after a fall from a greater height. RESULTS FROM MATHEMATICAL SIMU- LATIONS - Head-first falls of seven subjects were simulated with the MVMA 2-D model. These included falls of subjects ranging in age from 13 months to 21 years, in body position from nearly prone through vertical to almost supine, and for center-of-gravity to center-of-gravity fall heights from 10 ft 8 in (3. 3 m) through 33 ft 1 in (10. 1 m). The principal characteristics of the subjects whose head-first falls were simulated are shown in Table 5. Each of these falls is described in more detail in the Appendix. Much effort was devoted to reviewing available data sources and developing reasonable values for material and inertial properties to be used in the simulations. However, it should be kept in mind when interpreting predicted res- ponses that much of the human data needed for model input does not exist and that the simu- lations consequently have some limitations. Chief among the simulation limitations is the fact that fracture is not accounted for. Since fracture causes a reduction in load-bearing capacity, this means that predicted peak forces and accelerations are the maximum that could occur and peak deflections are the minimum possible values. However, the following points should be noted: 1. The fall heights for four of the head-first impact simulations were not greatly above mini- mum heights for which fracture is expected. In fact, skull fracture did not occur for Subject 87, a six-year old that had an impact velocity very similar to three other simulation subjects. 2. Predicted peak deflections will have greater percentage error than predicted peak accelerations because a fracture -compensated load -deflect ion curve might result in large predicted deflections beyond the fracture deflection in order to produce the necessary momentum transfer. Even so, the predicted values were thought to be reasonably accurate since observa- tions from the investigated cases did not indicate skull deflections grossly greater than those pre- dicted. 3. Peak head accelerations are not particu- larly sensitive to peak head forces. For most of the cases, simulations for three body impact angles varying through a 20 -deg range did not produce either greatly different accelerations or forces. For Case 59, however, peak forces</page><page sequence="12">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 3 1 23 Table 5 - Principle Characteristics of Subjects Whose Headfirst Falls were Simulated Body Orientation , ,,,, ... t . , Surl.uts Simulated Case Measured , ,,,, C(»-C(. ...

It was established by the investigator based on field observations and implications from injuries. varied by 33% while the peak accelerations varied by only 11%. This indicates that relative errors in predicted accelerations can be expected to be considerably less than errors in predicted forces. The principal results of the simulated head- first impacts are shown in Table 6. They show that, for a given case, the angle at impact between the body and the surface has little effect on response of the head. For the five simulations of children, variations of 20 deg in body impact angle resulted in differences in the peak and 3-ms average accelerations of no more than 17%. and deflection and forces differences of no more than 8%. In all the child simulations, the head loads increased to maximum and completely unloaded in a few milliseconds. This happened before forces could be fully transferred through the neck structures from the body to the head. Therefore, the position of the body relative to the head had little influence on the initial head response. However, field investigation data suggest that position at impact is more important than the simulations indicate. In the model, the same force-deflection characteristics were assigned to all aspects of the skull, but the human skull does not respond identically to impacts from various directions. Thus, while the modeled skull will have the same stiffness for both frontal and occipital impacts, for example, the real skull may not. Also, brain motions in one direction may be more injurious than in another direction, and the model does not account for brain tissue dynamics. These factors may in part account for the large differences in injuries seen under otherwise similar fall circumstances. ANALYSIS OF SIMULATION RESULTS - In two reports on the state-of-the-art in human impact tolerance, Snyder (22, 23) presented a graph adapted from Roth (24) which summarized impact experience to date as a function of deceleration distance and impact velocity, with impact acceleration and "stopping time" as determined parameters. This graph, with our simulation results plotted onto it, is included as Fig. 6. The basis for the Roth graph is the assumption of constant deceleration over the stopping time. Therefore, accelerations shown in the graph should be considered "average", not peak. All of the simulation values fall beyond the survival limit estimated by Roth. Yet all but one of the subjects, including a young adult, survived the impacts, and three of the survivors had injuries rated at AIS = 2 or 3. Acceleration and stopping time values were calculated from the same formulas used to create the graph and are compared with the values predicted by the model (Fig. 6, tabular material). The peak and 3-ms average accelerations for the graph are simple lumped-mass estimates for assumed linear systems.* Stopping times compare very favorably between the two methods - there is less than 0. 7 ms difference for all but one case, the adult. Maximum head deflection for the adult occurred at 10.4 ms, about 8 ms later than for the children and 6 ms *The peak and 3-ms average accelerations for the graph are values derived from the previously- mentioned constant (or "average") deceleration by assuming that there is a fundamental natural frequency ('/k/m ) of the impacting body which does not vary with deflection for deflections less than the stopping distance.</page><page sequence="13">3124 D.

Although the adult simulation exhibits an initial peak in head deflection at 2.7 ms, a higher peak value occurs later, coincident with delayed inertial loading by the relatively large body mass of the adult, which acts through the neck. The degree of agreement between graphical and simulation results for accelerations and stopping times reflects the degree of similarity between lumped- mass and distributed-mass representations of the fall subject. It is clear that the adult behaved much less like a lumped mass than did the children. On the whole, acceleration values from the graph and the simulations are similar although simu- lation values are somewhat larger. The 3-ms average accelerations from the graph are probably unrealistically large since their cal- culation assumed no absorbed energy loss during rebound unloading.

These three cases were specifically investigated because it seemed unusual that death had occurred in falls from such low heights. A detailed comparison of fall heights, impact velocities, and body masses between these five cases and very similar simulation cases indicated that these cases would also have been above the survival limit designated by Roth. The results shown in Fig. 6 and discussed above lend support to a possible generalization concerning head impacts. Considering that the survival limit indicated by Roth is the level above which survival is rare, Roth's value of 175-200 G is probably below the actual survival limit for many children under 7-8 years of age. With Roth's definition of survival limit, the graphical data suggest that a constant acceleration of 350 G for 2. 5 - 3 ms stopping time might be more appropriate for this age group. A corresponding survival limit for peak acceleration can be esti- mated by multiplying the constant acceleration by a factor of tt/2. This factor is conservative com- pared to the model predictions and gives a value of 550 G peak acceleration. The above conclusion, of course, depends on a reasonably accurate estimate of deceleration distance, and this question was addressed indirectly in several simulations. Errors of 30% were assumed in the technique used to make age adjustments for skull force-deflection characteristics. The resulting simulation data showed differences in deceleration distance of less than 10% (+0.02 to -0. 04 in), which produced virtually no change in the graphical results. Therefore, errors of at least 10% in predicting head deformation do not affect the results enough to change the basic conclusions noted above. No conclusions could be drawn from the results in Fig. 6 concerning tolerance limits for reversible injury. The availability of simulation results afforded another opportunity to determine if a reliable injury indicator could be developed. Eleven potential indicators were calculated and were examined for their ability to predict the maximum AIS value for the head. The three described below were thought to show a consistent relation- ship between value of potential indicator and AIS. These were peak and 3-ms average accelerations and rate of onset of acceleration. The Abbreviated Injury Scale system (2) uses an ordinal scale ranging from 0-6, zero being no injury at all and 6 being maximum and currently untreatable (invariably fatal). Therefore, any predictor of AIS may be expected to produce results which fit a sigmoid curve of the type shown in Fig. 7. The curve passes through the origin and remains at AIS=0 until the magnitude of the predictor is such that injury starts to occur. The curve must later become asymptotic to AIS = 6, since the AIS value cannot exceed 6 regardless of the magnitude of the predictor. The slope in the central portion of the curve and the shape of the curve near AIS = 0 and AIS = 6 will change with various indicators. Peak head acceleration and 3-ms average acceleration were two parameters that showed a good fit to the required curve.

In each case, peak accelera- tion was reached within 3 msec after initial impact the relationship between head acceleration (the plotted point for each subject is the average for two or three simulations at different body angles) and the maximum AIS value for the head. The fit for six of the cases was excellent through the AIS = 2-5 range. The exception (Case 61) was a 13-month old child who fell 34 ft (9. 9 m) but suffered little or no known permanent brain damage. Unlike the other falls, this child was also ex- tensively injured in other parts of the body and some of the impact energy may have been thus dissipated. The curves included in Fig. 8 were constructed using a subjective judgment of best fit based both on the simulation data points and on case investigation experience. The slope of the curve for 3-ms average acceleration is steeper, as expected, since the consequences of sustained acceleration are more severe. The curve for 3-ms average acceleration, though approximate, suggests a 350-400 G survival limit for young children, since survival is uncertain at ratings of AIS = 5. This curve also indicates that a reversible injury tolerance limit (AIS = 2 or 3) could be as high as 275-325 G for 3-ms average accelerations. The curve for peak acceleration indicates that the survival and reversible injury tolerance limits for young children may be as high as 600 G peak and 350-400 G peak, respectively. Snyder (23) stressed that rate of onset of acceleration was a determining factor in whole- body tolerance to impact. This parameter was calculated as the average slope (rate of change) of the acceleration curve from time t = 0 to the time at peak acceleration (generally 2 ms) (Fig. 9). Again, an approximate curve has been constructed to fit the data in Fig. 9. The simulation results suggest a reversible- injury tolerance (AIS = 2) for rate of onset (as defined above) of up to 200 000 G/s for as much as 2 ms of onset and predicted tolerance levels pertain primarily to young children. Seven other potential indicators were evaluated for positive relationship to maximum head AIS. Most of these were force, mass, or energy- related parameters. Only one - energy absorbed by the head per unit volume of the head - showed any relationship to the required curve shape, and that was not an especially good fit. It should be made clear that the potential indicators of head injury just discussed do not identify a mechanism for head injury. The underlying mechanism may or may not be directly related to either acceleration or absorbed energy. Whatever the mechanism, the three acceleration- related indicators do provide a good fit to the limited data and are of value in estimating the expected severity of injury for individuals with the characteristics of those simulated. The simulations in this study produced some interesting results related to the Head Injury Criterion (HIC). A HIC value of 1000 is intended to reflect the combination of impact acceleration and pulse duration which will cause most people to sustain concussion injury (25).

These rates were sustained for a maximum of 3 msec concussion would normally be rated AIS = 2. The MVMA 2-D model calculates HIC during simulations and has been shown to accurately predict HIC values for tests of unrestrained dummies impacting the windshield in a severe auto crash environment. Since all of the cases simulated had at least a concussion and/or a skull fracture, it is not possible to determine the validity of a threshold value of 1000, but it is interesting to note the computed HIC values in these cases. One fall was simulated in which the child received a concussion and skull fracture with a head AIS rating of 2. The model calculated a HIC value of 3200 in this 100-ms simulation. For more severe injuries in survived impacts, HIC values of up to 19 600 were calculated for children. The child who did not survive had a HIC value of 15 500, and the survived fall in which no skull fracture was diagnosed had a HIC = 7500. Fayon et al. (26) have recently published results of rigid surface impact testing with cadavers that are in general agreement with the simulation results. In free-fall tests of lateral impact to the skull in which accelerometers were positioned to calculate HIC at approximatelv the head center of gravity, Fayon reported HIC of "&gt;7000" for a 6 ft (1.8 m) drop and "&gt;5000" for an 8. 3 ft (2.5 m) drop. Fayon found that skull fractures and brain vasculature lesions had occurred in each of these lateral impacts (the brain vascular system was pressurized during the tests) . They judged that the "injuries" would have been minor in the 6-ftdrop but probably fatal in the 8.3 ft drop. HIC values may be estimated by specifying a waveform shape for the acceleration response pulse, a peak acceleration, and a pulse duration. The simulations predicted pulse durations of about 3 ms and waveforms that were basically either triangular or half-sine in shape. Calcu- lations using idealized triangular and half-sine waveforms and the predicted peak acceleration values from Fig* 8 indicate that HIC values of as much as 6500-11 000 may be survivable by some children, and HIC values of 1700-2800 may reflect only moderate injury. While these results do not reflect on the validity of HIC = 1000 as a minimum tolerance level, they show that some individuals can survive impacts which would produce HIC values ten times greater than the minimum tolerance value. The simulation results reported thus far for head-first impacts relate to impacts with rigid surfaces. However, the field investigations showed that impacts with non-rigid surfaces, even hard-packed ground, usually resulted in much less severe injury. To investigate the extent to which soil might mitigate impact effects, five sets of simulations were run to contrast head responses</page><page sequence="17">3128 D. R. FOUST, ET AL. from impacts with rigid surfaces, sand, and hard-packed soil. NASA data and soil penetro- meter readings were used to specify the force- deflection characteristics of the sand and soil. The effects of impacting different surfaces under otherwise-identical conditions are shown in Table 7. For impacts with soil, peak accelerations and normal forces were reduced to only about 1/3 to 1/2 of the rigid-impact values. Impact with soft sand reduced these responses to 15-22% of rigid surface values (25-50% for the adult). Head deflections from soil impacts were only about 28% of those from rigid-surface impacts, and head deflections from sand impact were only 12% of rigid-surface values. The time necessary to reach peak acceleration also increased considerably with impacts to softer surfaces, implying a lower rate of onset of acceleration. Finally, inertial ftspikingM was reduced so that the 3-ms average acceleration was nearly the same magnitude as peak acceler- ation for all non-rigid impacts. RESULTS FROM FEET -FIRST IMPACTS Teenagers and adults who fell often landed on their feet causing fractures of the lower extremities, lumbar spine, and pelvis. Results presented in this section are summarized from the on-site investigations and the three feet-first falls that were simulated. INVESTIGATED CASES - Data from the investigated cases showed that older subjects tended to have more serious lower extremity and spinal injuries than younger subjects in falls from the same height. Compression fractures of the lumbar spine were the most common injury to persons over 40 who fell to a sitting position after landing on their feet. Both teenagers and adults öfter landed on their feet, causing lower leg or angle fractures, then fell to all fours or to the side. In these circumstances, fractures of the lumbar spine and pelvis were common among older adults but were not seen in teenagers. For feet-first impacts to rigid surfaces, increasing fall distances resulted in increasingly severe injuries. None of the feet-first falls that were investigated resulted in fatalities, and for fall distances of less than 30 ft (9. 1 m), the injuries tended to be similar - usually fractures of one or both feet or ankles. In four cases of falls from heights greater than 30 ft, fractures of the spine and pelvis were seen in addition to fractures of the ankles and feet. The severest injuries resulted from the most extreme falls - two teenagers who survived falls of more than 70 ft (21 m). Each suffered multiple fractures of both lower extremities and the pelvis. Although both fell forward to a prone position after impact, neither suffered significant head injuries. The benefits of decelerating the body through longer time and greater distance are apparent in foot- first impacts. The body has more deceleration distance when it impacts feet-first, and the long bones absorb a large amount of the impact energy before fracturing.

The five falls of greater than 10 ft (3 m) involved fracture of the first lumbar vertebra, and wrist or elbow fractures were also common as the subject tried to support himself while coming to rest. There were no fatalities and no diagnosed neurological injuries as a result of these falls (all spinal fractures were compression fractures of the anterior portion of the vertebral body). However, each subject had long periods of hospitalization and convalescence, much loss of work, and some permanent disability. SIMULATIONS OF FEET-FIRST IMPACTS - Falls were simulated for three teenagers who fell from heights of 12 ft 9 in (3. 9 m), 22 ft (6. 7 m), and 69 ft 7 in (21. 2 m), landing on their feet on rigid surfaces. Characteristics of these falls are summarized in Table 8 and described in more detail in the Appendix. All three subjects were teenagers, since neither of the children in investi- gated cases who landed feet-first satisfy the criteria for simulation. Simulation of foot-first impact is difficult with the MVMA 2-D model, since it has only one leg and no joint at the ankle. Also, the complex reactions of a flexed human knee under impact are difficult to simplify for modeling. It is again important to note that body part force - deflection curves used in the simulations do not account for fracture. Therefore, predicted peak forces and accelerations are the maximum that could have occurred for the subject. The results of the feet-first impact simulations are shown in Table 9. Forces in the foot and the leg hip accelerations are included in the table. It is apparent that the body position at impact substantially affects the forces in the legs. In all simulations, axial forces in the foot, tibia and femur increased as the subject landed with greater leg extension. Increased leg extension also usually resulted in increased hip acceleration. The simulations demonstrate that compressive forces vary along the length of the long bones: In each simulation, the greater the distance from the foot contact point, the lower the forces. Subject 50 landed on only one foot. A compari- son of his simulation results at 29 ft/ s with those Subject 74 at 38 ft/s shows the advantage of landing on both feet. Although Subject 74 absorbed 50% more kinetic energy (3000 ft-lb versus 2000 ft-lb), his predicted tibial forces were only 50-60% of Subject 50Ts. Actual injuries to both of these subjects were confined to fractures of the lower leg bones just above the ankle or to bones in the ankle. Therefore, the simulations indicate that, for these teenage subjects, the forces were great enough to cause fracture of the tibia at the ankle, but not great enough to fracture the femur. Also, the predicted accelerations in the hip were not sufficient to cause injury to the pelvic regions in these two cases. Subject 28 told the investigator that he attempted to throw himself forward and roll as he landed. This type of movement cannot be simulated by the model, but the impact velocity was so great that the initial few milliseconds of simulation probably produced realistic results. The results for this subject appear consistent with the other two sub- jects in terms of injuries. Subject 50 had no femur fracture and Subject 28 did, but their predicted femur axial forces are nearly identical. However, the loading direction was different for the subjects (Subject 50 remained upright while Subject 28 went to his knees). Predicted femur shear forces for Subject 28 are roughly twice those for Subject 50, so those forces were probably the determining factor causing the femur fracture. Subject 28 sustained a pelvic fracture at the hip joint (predicted hip acceleration = 300 G) but the Table 8 - Principle Characteristics of Subjects whose Feetfirst Falls were Simulated Kigid Case Wt Ht Body Orientation Measured CG-CG Body Impact Sur- No. Aue Sex ( 1h) ( in) At Start At Impact Fal 1 Ht Fall Ht Rotation Major Injuries Recovery Angles face 74 13yr3mo M 120 68 Standing Standing 22'0" 22'0" 0° Fx left lower leg, Complete 65° X Crouched right ankle 75° (N)* X 85° X 50 17yr6mo M 158 73 Standing Standing 16' 3" 12'9" 0° Fx left lower leg Complete 75°(N) X One Leg 85° X 28 19yr4mo M 125 63 Standing Standing 75'4" 69'7" 0° Fx both legs &amp; feet, Partial 70° X Crouched fx pelvis &amp; ribs 80° (N) X hemothorax 90° X Conversions 1 lb = .4536 kg; L in » 2.54 cm; 1 ft = .3048 m *(N) denotes nominal impact angle.

Case 50 was a fall to only one leg - all impact forces were absorbed by one leg. Conversions: 1 lb = .4536 kg; 1 ft/sec = .3048 m/sec; 1 lbf = 4.45 N other subjects did not (predicted hip acceleration = 100 G). The results also demonstrate that locking the knees would cause significantly higher forces and accelerations to be transmitted through the body. These could be expected to cause much greater injury than the subject actually received, so it is likely that he fell with bent knees and threw himself forward, as he claimed. Comparison of the predicted femur forces with experimental results is possible using data published recently by Melvin and Stalnaker (27). Fresh cadavers in a sitting position were impacted on the patella with an unpadded rigid striker so that the force was transmitted axially through the femur. The lower torso was not restrained. The seven tests were conducted with cadavers that were 57 - 74 years old. Fractures of the patella or the distal shaft of the femur occurred in four tests with axial forces of 4050 - 5330 lb (18 015 - 23 720 N), at striker impact velocities of 34-38 ft/s. No fractures occurred in three tests with forces of 3640 - 5100 lb (16 190 - 22 685 N), at striker impact velocities of 27-31 ft/s. Predicted peak axial forces at the knee for Subjects 50 and 28 were in the range of 6600-7600 lb (29 400-33 800 N) for impact velocities of 29 and 67 ft/s. No fractures typical of axial loading were seen in these subjects, so either the simulation predictions are somewhat high, or the teenagers have stronger femurs than the elderly test subjects, or both. DISCUSSION The analysis of case investigation data indi- cates that injury severity is affected by age for all types of falls, with the least injury variation occurring in head-first impacts. How much these differences depend on body maturity and how much on body mass remains largely unanswered from these data. Since the skull bones of children mature rather early in life, child responses to head impact would be expected to be more adult-like if bone strength were the only important factor. The fact that adults still tend to receive somewhat greater injuries than children in similar head-first falls suggests that the increased body mass of adults is responsible for what age effect is seen in head-first falls. By contrast, teenagers are often significantly less injured than adults in similar feet-first impacts, yet there is not a great difference in body mass between the two groups. In these instances, it is probable that bone maturation or brittleness is responsible for the observed age effects on injury. A review of the attempts to predict whole- body injury on the basis of fall height shows that impact velocity can be correlated with injury severity. These analyses support some general statements concerning expected injuries. The results indicate that virtually any head-first fall of greater than 10 ft (3 m) onto a rigid surface may be expected to cause skull fracture or concussion for adult or child. Neurological damage and AIS 3 or 4 injuries are also probable if fall heights exceed about 15 ft (4. 6 m) for children and about 10 ft for adults. For fall distances of 10 ft or greater, landing in a sitting position on a rigid surface will probably</page><page sequence="20">HUMAN IMPACT TOLERANCE 3131 cause fracture of the lumbar spine of adults. Landing on the feet after falling more than 30 ft (9. 1 m) will probably cause pelvic fractures in adults if a rigid surface is impacted. Data from the present study indicate an upper bound for child tolerance for head-first impacts to rigid surfaces in that fracture and/or concussion are almost always to be expected from falls of 10 ft or greater. For very young children (up to 18 months) a lower bound in which skull fracture rarely occurs may be estimated from recent data published in Accident Facts (1), The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) found that falls from high chairs resulted in fractures of all types for only about 7% of 7000 children who were seen in hospital emergency rooms. (Half of these were between 7 and 18 months of age.) About 5200 of these children suffered head injuries (not necessarily fractures). The most severe fall situation cited by CPSC was of children standing up on the seat and toppling over the side (a fall distance of approximately 4 ft). Since it may be assumed that only the more severe cases of high chair falls will result in a hospital visit, these data suggest that only a very small percentage of head-first falls from 4 ft or less are likely to cause skull fracture in very young children. Thus, for young children, the threshold for skull fracture resulting from free-falls is estimated to be in the range of 4-10 ft. The simulations were intended to provide predictions of the force, acceleration, and deflection quantities which might be produced in a rigid surface impact, but the model cannot predict fracture levels or expected injuries. For this reason, an important part of the simulation analysis was devoted to examining possible correlation between the predicted response values and the observed injuries. The results suggest that for head impacts children may have higher limits of survival tolerance than adults. The simulation results compare favorably with the impact experience presented by Roth (24), but indicate the survival limit for impulsive loading of the child skull could be above that specified by Roth for adults. The results suggest that children may also have a slightly higher level of tolerance for reversible injury (if one assumes that AIS = 2-3 defines reversible injury), since under similar fall circumstances, children were usually injured less severely than adults. The greatest limitation in interpretation of simulation results was the absence of fracture prediction. Appropriate force -de fleet ion data for fractures of the skull and extremities do not- exist, so the simulation model could not be accurate in an absolute sense. However, the model did predict response values that were in logical agree- ment with observed injuries. These simulations demonstrated that, with careful attention to establishing initial parameters and conditions, whole -body-mot ion models can be used success- fully to simulate actual individual events and predict the responses expected in those events. For simulations of both head-first and feet-first falls, several of the predicted responses correlated well with injury severities to the degree that greater response magnitudes were associated with more severe observed injuries. Additional research is needed to establish better values for parameters to which the model is especially sensitive (such as fracture- compensated load -deflection curves and material properties of the head, lower leg complex, and hip). This would increase the value of the model as a tool in predicting response of humans. Other research is also needed to develop in more detail model response parameters which are reliable predictors of injury, such as those which were explored in this study. Especially valuable would be the establishment of loading curves which incorporate fracture characteristics. Success in those two areas of research would permit the attainment of a long-sought goal - the use of a model to predict specific injuries under prescribed impact circumstances. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of data from the reported falls, the case investigations, and the simulations have led to the following conclusions: 1. During a one-year period, males were reported to fall under free-fall conditions six times as frequently as females (1830 versus 304 falls). From birth to age 6, males were involved in 65% of all reported free-falls. During the "working years" from ages 20-69, males accounted for 90% of falls and males were the victims in 99% of occupational free-faUs. Falls relating to occupational hazards were 36% of all reported free-falls, indicating a need for safer workplace design. Youths and young adults (ages 20-39) were involved in 39% of reported free-falls. Youths in the 13-19 age range fell 1.4 times as often as children in the 0-12 age range. Young adults (20-29) fell twice as often as children. Data from news reports indicate that persons in the 13-29 age range take on mòre hazardous recreational and occupational activities and therefore constitute the population segment most at risk of being involved in a free-fall accident. 2. The most frequently mentioned fall hazards for young children were open windows and open-railing balconies. These findings demonstrate the need to design new buildings and</page><page sequence="21">3132 D. R. FOUST, ET AL. modify older ones to prevent falls if possible and minimize the consequences of falls if they do occur, 3. This study provided evidence that children are injured less severely than adults under simi- lar impact conditions. Children and adults also showed different injury patterns under similar fall circumstances. Children suffered a greater proportion of head injuries because they tended to land head-first regardless of fall distance or position at the start of the fall. Increased injury severities among adults are thought to be caused by a combination of increased body mass and less flexible bony structures. 4. The field investigations indicate that body position at the moment of impact has a very great effect on resulting injuries. For several nearly identical falls, impacts to slightly different areas of the head resulted in a range of injuries from moderate to fatal. However, the model used for the simulations predicted very little change in im- pact response over a range of 20 deg difference in body position. This type of model is not yet capable of accounting for the subtle differences in position or internal response that may affect overall injury patterns. 5. Several analyses of the case investigation data for rigid-surface impacts revealed virtually no correlation between standard injury scales (ISS and AIS) and potential injury predictors such as impact velocity and kinetic energy at impact. The only tolerance values suggested by this prediction analysis was that survival is uncertain if more than 2500 ft-lb of energy are absorbed in a free-fall. As a basis for further analysis, response parameters from the simulations were used. For head impacts with rigid surfaces, peak head acceleration, 3-ms average head acceleration, and rate of onset of acceleration all were found to correlate reasonably well with maximum AIS of the head. Analysis of curves fitted to these data suggests that the survival limit for children age 8 and younger, as indicated by AIS level 5 injury, may be as high as 600 G peak acceleration with an onset rate of up to 300 000 G/s and a pulse duration of up to 3 ms. This is approximately equivalent to HIC values of up to 11 000. For some children, the curves suggest that the tolerance limit for moderate to severe (but reversible) injury, as indicated by AIS 2 or 3, could be as high as 350-400 G peak acceleration with a rate of onset of up to 200 000 G/s for up to 3 ms pulse duration (approximate HIC of 1700-2800). 6. Comparison of simulation data with other reported impact experience showed that children often survived impact accelerations at levels beyond the estimated survival limits for adults. For children under age 8, this comparison supports a conclusion that a constant acceleration of up to 350 G for 2.5-3 ms approaches the survival limit for head impacts. No conclusion about survival limits could be reached for adults, since only one adult head impact was simulated. Impact experience data were too limited to allow a conclusion about minimum tolerance levels or tolerance levels for reversible injury. The observation may be made, however, on the basis of CPSC data, that for children younger than 18 months, the minimum tolerance level for reversible head injury may be reached when fall distance is somewhat greater than 4 ft. 7. Finally, the MVMA 2-D model appears to be a useful tool for simulating human dynamic responses in free-fall impacts. The results were in conceptual agreement with published data and could logically be extended to include age groups for which there were no published data. The simu- lations also predicted higher forces and accelerations than were previously considered to be survivable and thus tentatively support new conclusions regarding human tolerance to impact.

APPENDIX The following paragraphs are brief descriptions of the cases of head-first and feet- first impact which were simulated by the MVMA 2-D model. Case 21: A 3 year, 6 month male of height 41 in (104 cm) and weight 40 lb (18. 1 kg). He was sitting on a windowsill inside his home and fell backwards from a sitting position. He rotated approximately 210 deg while falling 11 ft (3.4m) and struck the upper frontal part of his head on a slate floor. His injuries included multiple skull fractures, a concussion, and head contusions (head AIS = 2)0 He recovered completely after a few weeks. This case was simulated with the subject landing face down and with the torso at 50, 60, and 70 deg above horizontal. Additional simulations were conducted with + 30% changes to the maturation curve which was used to determine skull force-deflection properties for children. This case was also simulated for sand and soil impacts at both 50 and 60 deg torso angles. Case 59: A 21 year male of height 70 in (178 cm) and weight 160 lb (72. 6 kg). He stepped through a hole in the roof of a building under construction and rotated approximately 120 deg while falling to a concrete floor. His injuries included skull fractures and a severe concussion, with a partial hemiparesis and aphasia (head AIS = 4). He was hospitalized many weeks, but</page><page sequence="23">3134 d. r. foust, et al. responded to therapy for the hemiparesis and aphasia. This case was simulated with the subject landing face down and with the torso at 50, 60, and 70 deg above horizontal. Additional simulations included sand and soil impacts at 60 deg torso angle. Case 87: A3 year, 6 month male of height 48 in (122 cm) and weight 55 lb (24.9 kg). He fell backward from a standing position. He rotated approximately 145 deg while falling 10 ft 2 in (3.1 m) and struck the upper rear part of his head on a concrete floor. His injuries included a severe cerebral contusion with a hemiparesis, (head AIS = 5). He has partially recovered, but probably will have permanent loss of the use of one arm. This case was simulated with the subject landing face up and with the torso at 25, 35, and 45 deg above horizontal. Additional simulations included sand and soil impacts at 35 deg torso angle. Case 110: a 3 year, 4 month male of height 38 in (97 cm) and weight 32 lb (14. 5 kg). He fell forward when a garbage can "elevator" he was playing in tipped and threw him out. Witnesses indicated he turned one complete rotation in the air while falling 17 ft 2 in (5. 2 m) and struck the upper frontal area of his head on a concrete sidewalk. His injuries included a severe skull fracture and immediate coma (head AIS = 5). He did not recover and expired 6 1/2 h after the fall. This case was simulated with the subject landing face down and with the torso at 15, 25, and 35 deg above horizontal. Case 61: A 13 month male of height 30 in (76 cm) and weight 21 lb (9. 7 kg). He rolled sideways through a small window opening and rolled several times in the air while falling 34 ft 2 in (9. 9 m). He struck the upper frontal area of his head and his left knee on a sidewalk. He suffered multiple skull fractures, a fracture of the left femur, a ruptured spleen, and other less severe injuries (head AIS = 3). He was hospitalized 13 days and was expected to recover fully. This case was simulated with the subject landing face down and at torso angles of 25 and 35 deg above horizontal. Additional simulations included sand and soil impacts at 35 deg torso angle. Case 9: A 2 year male of height 35 in (90 cm) and weight 25 lb (11. 3 kg). He fell forward from a standing position and rotated approximately 165 deg while falling 10 ft 6 in (3. 2 m) and struck the top of his head on concrete. He received multiple skull fractures and a small subgaleal hematoma (head AIS = 3), but recovered almost completely. This case was simulated with the subject landing face down and with the torso at 65, 75, and 85 deg above horizontal. Case 62; A 2 year, 1 month female of height 32 in (81 cm) and weight 23 lb (10. 4 kg). She stepped or slipped forward under a railing and rotated backward about 100 deg while falling 13 ft 3 in (4.0 m), striking her head and back on a terrazo floor. She was severely injured, suffering skull fractures, a severe concussion and a dural tear (head AIS = 5). She was hospitalized many weeks and is recovering slowly, with the probability of some permanent impairment. This case was simulated with the subject landing face up, with the torso horizontal and 10 deg above horizontal. Case 74: A 13 year, 3 month male of height 68 in (173 cm) and weight 120 lb (54.4 kg). He fell backward from a standing, slightly crouched position and maintained this position while falling 22 ft (6. 7 m), landing balanced on both feet on thick, rigid ice. He fell forward to his hands and knees on impact. He suffered fractures of the left lower leg and the right ankle (AIS = 3), no other injuries. He was expected to recover completely. This case was simulated as a semi- crouched feet-first fall onto two feet, with the lower leg at 65, 75, and 85 deg above horizontal. Case 50: A 17 year, 6 month male of height 73 in (185 cm) and weight 158 lb (71. 7 kg). He fell from the edge of a roof after dangling his legs over the side and supporting his weight on his hands. He fell straight down in this standing position a distance of 16 ft 3 in (5. 0 m), landing on one foot on concrete. He remained in a standing position after the fall, supporting himself on his other leg and leaning against the building. He suffered fractures of the lower leg bones (AIS = 3) but has recovered completely. This case was simulated as a semi-crouched feet-first fall onto one foot, with the lower leg at 75 and 85 deg above horizontal. Case 28: A 19 year 4 month male of height 63 in (160 cm) and weight 125 lb (56.7 kg). He fell from the edge of a roof after tripping over the side and catching himself momentarily with his fingers on the roof edge. He dropped away from the building and fell in a standing position 75 ft 4 in (23. 0 m) landing on both feet on asphalt. He threw himself forward as he landed. He suffered multiple fractures of both legs and feet, a fractured pelvis and rib, displaced sternum and a hemothorax (max AIS = 4). He was hospitalized 34 days and was expected to have permanent impairment of the ankles. This case was simulated as a semi-crouched feet-first fall onto both feet, with the lower leg at 70, 80, and 90 deg (knees locked) above horizontal.</page></plain_text>
