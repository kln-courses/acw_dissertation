<plain_text><page sequence="1">MODERN FICTION NEWSLETTER BRITISH FICTION (1) This Newsletter might properly begin with our Editor's Note following Dr. C. Knight Aldrich's lead-article on The Turn of the Screw. With that example before us of a professional psychiatrist offering "scientific" cor roboration of a thesis so startling that a skilled literary critic had to present it in the form of a spoof, we approached JOSEPH CONRAD: A PSYCHO ANALYTIC BIOGRAPHY (Princeton University Press, $8.50), by Bernard C. Meyer, M.D., with some trepidation, for we remembered fondly Bruce Harkness' mock-serious essay on The Secret Sharer in the October 1965 issue of College English. Harkness, it will be recalled, saw the "secret" of that story as homosexuality, and though his main purpose was to satirize a certain kind of criticism, he managed to gather a good amount of evidence from within the story to support his tongue-in-cheek view of the bond between Leggatt and the captain. We were amused later to discover that he had overlooked Conrad's own comment on the story in a letter to Edward Garnett: "the Secret Sharer, between you and me, is it. Eh? No damned tricks with girls there." We had hoped that criticism of Conrad since Albert Guerard's still basic study of Conrad the Novelist in 1958 (which, incidentally, was recently made available in an Atheneum paperback at $2.65) would put to rest permanently the old "one of us" view of Conrad as a supporter of all the traditional values cherished by the middle class. But the response to Harkness' essay proved otherwise. Many people took his argument seriously and wrote letters to the editor in protest against what they considered a grossly unfair interpretation that could hardly enhance the reputation of their Conrad. With that as background, it is no wonder that we took Dr. Meyer's book in hand with some apprehension. To a large extent, our fears proved ground less. Dr. Meyer, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, makes much of Conrad's misogyny—an aspect of his fiction long recognized by literary critics—and speculates interestingly on his close, almost paternal relation with younger men like Ford Madox Ford and Richard Curie. But there is no evidence in Dr. Meyer's intensely, densely researched book that would suggest anything but the most latent and submerged kind of homosexuality. Conrad, it is a relief to report, was a normal man. Normal, that is, in the sense that, like most of us, he had his weaknesses and neuroses—and that is why we find Dr. Meyer's book as infuriating as it is brilliant. The Conrad that emerges is hardly an attractive figure—a poor, suffering neurotic troubled by a whole catalog of real and imaginary ailments that culminated in a nervous breakdown and the sharp decline evident in 267</page><page sequence="2">his later writings. Conrad, we learn, was a vain and cranky husband who resented strongly the birth of his sons, worried about his digestive processes, and took a rather wary view o£ Woman in general, his wife in particular. However, the reason why we find Dr. Meyer's book somewhat infuriating is that it is not really a psychoanalytic biography of "Joseph Conrad" at all, but an attempt to psychoanalyze that Captain Korzeniowski whom Joseph Conrad did his best to kill off. What matters to us is that the artist in Conrad managed to transcend somehow the limitations of his own nature, his physical ailments, and domestic discord in order to produce enduring fiction that, ar tistically at least, does not have much to do with his personal psychosis. If poor Korzeniowski had had the benefit of a few analytical sessions with Dr. Meyer, Joseph Conrad might never have existed and there then would be no justification for Dr. Meyer's book. But if this well written, amply documented study, filled with exciting insights into the fiction, does nothing else, it ought to lay to rest forever those "one of us" interpreters who recognize no distinction between what Conrad was as a public citizen and what he was as a creative artist. To a great extent Dr. Meyer falls into this trap himself, but the indignant readers who protested Harkness' article would find it very difficult to reconcile their Conrad with Dr. Meyer's. Conrad wrote to a Polish friend, "Homo duplex has in my case more than one meaning." Two recent critical studies attempt to come to grips with the relationship between the seafarer and the writer, the Pole and the English man of letters. In JOSEPH CONRAD AND THE FICTION OF AUTO BIOGRAPHY (Harvard University Press, 1966, $4.95), Edward W. Said first seeks clues in Conrad's voluminous correspondence and finds in his letters "a curious phenomenon ... the creation of a public personality that was to camouflage his deeper and more problematic difficulties with himself and his work." Since Conrad believed that "his life was like a series of short episodes . . . because he was himself so many different people, each one living a life unconnected with the others," he expressed these many selves most effectively in his shorter fiction, the thirty or so tales written, like his letters, in what Said calls "a retrospective mode." Said's thesis appears to be a workable one, and his readings of the short stories are thoughtful and provocative. ... In THE DUAL HERITAGE OF JOSEPH CONRAD (Mouton and Company, 27 Dutch Guilders), Robert R. Hodges sees the split in Conrad in terms of the differences between his father and his guardian-uncle, his mentors during the crucial, growing-up years. Whereas Apollo Korzenioswki was a romantic and a patriot, Conrad's uncle, Thaddeus Bobrowski, was a practical and conservative man who did his best to make his nephew distrust all that his father had stood for. Hodges applies the conflict to the relevant works of fiction and finds a reconciliation of Conrad's two selves in "Prince Roman" of 1911. With that reconciliation, however, began the process of decline noted in different terms by Guerard, Thomas Moser, and Dr. Meyer. . . . Conradians who cannot read Polish should wel come a scholarly monograph by Andrzej Busza, CONRAD'S POLISH LITER ARY BACKGROUND AND SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE INFLU 268 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">ENCE OF POLISH LITERATURE ON HIS WORK (Rome: Institutum Historicum Polonicum, 1966, no price given). Busza finds an abundance of probable influences and direct sources as he discusses Conrad's father and guardian, his early cultural environment, his contacts with Polish literature after his voluntary exile of 1874, and the Polish view of Conrad. The closest debts apply to Victory and three of the shorter works—"Karain," "Amy Foster," and "Prince Roman"—each of which is the subject of a separate chapter. The celebrated death scene of Lena in Victory, for instance, is so similar to one in a forgotten sensation-novel, The History of a Sin, by Stefan Zeromski, that Conrad could almost be accused of plagiarism. (2) Bernard J. Poli's FORD MADOX FORD AND THE TRANSATLAN TIC REVIEW (Syracuse University Press, $5.50) supplements the recent publication of Frank MacShane's biography and Richard M. Ludwig's edi tion of the letters. Poli's book provides not only the fullest picture yet of the wheezing gadfly editor who sought in Transatlantic Review "a place for publication for such sincere commencing authors as the world might hold," but also some priceless peeks, usually askance, at the parasitical literary life of spiritual expatriates in Paris when Ford, Pound, Gertrude Stein, Heming way, and a host of others took turns playing starfish and oyster. The book indirectly rebuts the unflattering portrait of Ford in Hemingway's A Move able Feast by showing, usually through documentary evidence, that Ford's young co-editor was "an admirable writer [but] such an unreliable friend." The tragedy of Ford's last major editorial venture, Poli shows, was in promising young writers high rates for stories and articles—rates the always insolvent periodical could never pay. As Ford sadly wrote to Gertrude Stein, "I really exist as a sort of half-way house between non-publishable youth and real money—a sort of green baize swing door that everyone kicks both on entering and on leaving." Nonetheless, Poli's contribution to the literary history of the twentieth century makes it clear that Ford, a relic from the Edwardians as he was, still cared, as few of his contemporaries did, for what others were writing. Transatlantic Review published parts of such epoch-making and truly experimental books as Finnegans Wake, In Our Time, and The Making of Americans. We are all in his debt. (3) Many critics and biographers have written about Robert Louis Stevenson, but only a few have attempted to see his fiction in genuinely critical terms. Edwin M. Eigner's ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON AND ROMANTIC TRADITION (Princeton University Press, —) belongs with David Daiches' study of 1947 and Robert Kiely's book of 1964 as the best of such attempts. Eigner first traces intelligibily two opposing traditions of the romance—a "bad" tradition represented by Sir Walter Scott and the writers of escape literature as opposed to a more psychologically oriented type of romance that focuses on the duality of man—and then shows how Stevenson's narra tives are related to the latter tradition. Demonstrating Stevenson's knowledge and conscious borrowings from his predecessors, Eigner concedes weaknesses where they appear, but his emphasis on the thematic level in Stevenson's tales of adventure makes them seem more profoundly meaningful than is NEWSLETTER 269</page><page sequence="4">generally supposed. This is a well researched, clearly written work of critical scholarship which will interest not only readers of Stevenson, but anyone concerned with theories of fiction. (4) T. S. Eliot called Rudyard Kipling "a writer impossible wholly to under stand." Two new books make an effort. Of the more interests to students of fiction is Bonamy Dobrée's RUDYARD KIPLING: REALIST AND FABULIST (Oxford University Press, $5.75). Dobree resists the impulse so common in current criticism to make over his man in terms of the mid century Zeitgeist. While showing conclusively that Kipling was bitterly aware of "the accepted hells beneath," Dobrée presents a writer with "an extraordinary, even extravagant delight in nature, in life, in the doings of mankind." Kipling wrote little realistic fiction in the ordinary sense of that word but had, Dobrée asserts, a capacity for assessing the "reality" of human characters "reacting not always too prettily to the events in which they are caught up." If, as Dobree acknowledges, Kipling saw life wrong, he was always faithful to his vision. Dobrée concludes that to understand what Kipling was saying the reader must recognize that fabular element which pervades his fiction. . . . K. Bhaskara Rao's RUDYARD KIPLING'S INDIA (University of Oklahoma Press, $5.95) is a polemic that attempts to ex plain Kipling as emblematic of the earlier phase of British imperialism in India during which time the Indian became a stranger in his own land. For Rao, three main conclusions emerge from his study: (1) Kipling was a local colorist; his knowledge of Hindu life was limited, and until Kim, his under standing of the contemplative life finds no expression in his stories; (2) Kipling had the qualities of the journalist who sacrifices depth for super ficialities and the normal for the sensational; and (3) it is only in his presentation of the social and official departmental life of the Anglo-Indian that Kipling shows true understanding. (5) M. K. Naik sees his W. SOMERSET MAUGHAM (University of Okla homa Press, $4.95) as going far "towards satisfying the need for a compre hensive study of one of the most popular writers of the modern period." In terms of a dogged citing of every Maugham title down to the littlest known short story or essay, Naik has indeed given us a "comprehensive" book. In terms of a selective assessment of those works which have made Maugham's a household name throughout the world despite almost complete critical dis regard, Naik's book fails. Looking—but obviously not hard enough—for a workable lens through which to examine Maugham, Naik locates it in what he calls the deep-seated conflict between cynicism and humanitarianism. However, the study is necessarily concerned largely with Maugham's well known cynicism, and it is this quality of which Naik despairs in an almost priggish way. To take cynicism from Maugham would be like taking the Code from Hemingway. Still, Naik sees Maugham as "the only major casualty" among his contemporaries, dating from Butler and Shaw down to Eliot, Huxley, and Hemingway, who "fought cynicism on its own ground and . . . ultimately won over it." One might question the company Naik makes Maugham keep as well as his conclusion, especially about Eliot and 270 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">Hemingway. Elsewhere Naik quotes Maugham on Arnold Bennett who, despite a severe stammer, "was able to maintain a balance and regard the normal life of man from a normal point of view" and then wishes "one could say the same about Maugham." Naik, however, never defines "normal." Naik's sensibility is so clearly anti-Maugham that one wonders why he wrote the book. He rightly observes that in dealing with matters spiritual, Maugham always stuck to the letter and missed the spirit. This is precisely the trouble with Naik's own book. (6) In George Woodcock's THE CRYSTAL SPIRIT: A STUDY OF GEORGE ORWELL (Little, Brown and Company, $6.95) we are fortunate to get the first book-length study of Orwell by a man who knew him well. Although offering little that is new in a literary assessment of Orwell, Woodcock supports in a series of personal memoirs the contention first made by Richard Rees that Orwell belongs in the tradition of British Angry Young Men that began with H. G. Wells more than a half-century before Osborne's Look Back in Anger officially added that phrase to the language. Woodcock was a friend of Orwell during the last decade of his life; they were co-workers and writers for various causes of the literary left in Britain during and immediately after World War II. The opening chapter, "The Man I Knew," provides an intimate perspective on the last decade of Orwell's life, one that reinforces the feeling one gets in reading Orwell's books that the words "human decency" best describe his world view. Wood cock places Orwell in the spirit of the eighteenth century, when narrative literature reached a peak, and notes that "not since Swift . . . has there been a prose more lucid, flexible, exact and eloquent than Orwell's." (7) Other new books on individual British writers include Horace Gregory's DOROTHY RICHARDSON: AN ADVENTURE IN SELF-DISCOVERY (Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, $4.95). Timed to appear simultaneously with Knopf's recent edition of her multi-volumed Pilgrimage—published complete for the first time—Gregory's essay provides a sensitive and sympathetic introduction to both the woman and her much respected but seldom read novel. That the new edition includes for the first time March Moonlight, which, though unpolished, was apparently meant to round off the cycle of her personal pilgrimage as well as the novel, may well signal an awakening of popular and critical interest in the most Proustian of modern English novelists. Until now her sequence novel has been what Remembrance of Things Past would be without The Past Recaptured. . . . The main distinct ion of Peter Wolfe's THE DISCIPLINED HEART: IRIS MURDOCH AND HER NOVELS (University of Missouri Press, $5.95) is his demonstration of the close correlation between her philosophical ideas and her social comedies. After summarizing and clarifying that philosophy, Wolfe discusses individ ually each of the eight novels published to date. . . . Maurice Harmon's SEAN O'FAOLAIN: A CRITICAL INTRODUCTION (University of Notre Dame Press, $6.95) is the first book-length study of the Irish writer. Con ventional in approach and expository in tone, this book sees O'Faolain as a representative writer of his generation. . . . Recent additions to Twayne's NEWSLETTER 271</page><page sequence="6">English Authors Series include two books by members of the MFS staff at Purdue. In H. G. WELLS (53.95), Richard Hauer Costa distinguishes the "public" Wells from Wells-in-spite-of-himself, that visionary and intelli gent novelist whose science-fiction romances and social comedies deserve to endure. Comprehensive in scope and editorial apparatus, this is a rare at tempt to see the whole Wells. Richard J. Voorhees' P. G. WODEHOUSE ($3.95) covers the career to date of one of England's most prolific writers and relates his fiction to comic tradition. Less ambitious in scope is R. B. D. French's P. G. WODEHOUSE (Barnes and Noble, $2.50), a recent addition to the Writers and Critics series of short critical monographs. Whereas Voorhees' book is a serious critical study that reflects the light humor of its subject, French's is little more than a Wodehouse sampler. (8) If recent books dealing in part with modern British novelists have some thing in common, it is their concern with meaning and moral purpose rather than artistic form. Laurence Lerner's THE TRUTHTELLERS: JANE AUSTEN, GEORGE ELIOT, AND D. H. LAWRENCE (Schocken Books, $7.50) is dedicated to Wayne Booth, whose conviction in The Rhetoric of Fiction that ideas and values do matter in the novel is clearly shared by Lerner. Writing with admirable informality, he discusses the fiction of Austen, Eliot, and Lawrence individually and comparatively against the ideological background of nineteenth-century Romanticism. Arguing that these seemingly different writers were deeply committed to a non-theistic, but positive humanism and that it is precisely this commitment which makes their fiction great, Lerner has himself written a committed, forceful work of criticism. ... In THE REACTIONARIES: A STUDY OF THE ANTI DEMOCRATIC INTELLIGENTSIA (Shocken Books, $6), John Harrison includes Wyndham Lewis and D. H. Lawrence, along with Yeats, Pound, and T. S. Eliot, in his gallery of influential modern writers who at one time or another in their careers were sympathetic to Fascism. Coolly summoning the evidence, Harrison fills in a gap in recent literary history. . . . Robert A. Colby's FICTION WITH A PURPOSE: MAJOR AND MINOR NINE TEENTH-CENTURY NOVELS (Indiana University Press, $9.50) is a librarian's study of seven representative novels: Waverly, Mansfield Park, Oliver Twist, Pendennis, Villetle, The Mill on the Floss, and Middlemarch. In each instance Colby is concerned with the socio-cultural purpose of the writer. He compares the novels with minor works published contemporane ously with them and suggests the probable reactions of the nineteenth century audience. The result is a significant contribution to the social history of literature. . . . MINOR BRITISH NOVELISTS (Southern Illinois Uni versity Press, $4.95), edited by Charles Alva Hoyt, is a collection of nine previously unpublished essays by various hands. Included are three papers on modern novelists: Berta Nash on Arthur Machen, Frederick S. Wandall on Charles Williams, and William J. Lockwood on Rose Macaulay. 272 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN FICTION (9) The 1960's will probably be remembered as the most important period in Mark Twain scholarship since the early studies done by Albert Bigelow Paine and Bernard DeVoto. Harper &amp; Row will soon be launching their new "Manuscript Edition" of Mark Twain's works, which will be the first that has been edited by scholars. The University of California Press has already begun supplementing this edition with the first three of a projected twelve volumes culled mainly from the Mark Twain Papers. This trio, handsomely bound and selling for $10 each, consists of MARK TWAIN'S WHICH WAS THE DREAM? AND OTHER SYMBOLIC WRITINGS OF THE LATER YEARS, edited by John S. Tuckey; MARK TWAIN'S SATIRES 8c BURLESQUES, edited by Franklin R. Rogers; and MARK TWAIN'S LETTERS TO HIS PUBLISHERS, 1867-1894, edited by Hamlin Hill. Professor Tuckey's major discoveries about the circumstances and the writing of The Mysterious Stranger were published in 1963 (Mark Twain and Little Satan: The Writing of "The Mysterious Stranger," Purdue Uni versity Studies). All but two of the later writings in the Tuckey volume are published for the first time. In theme and style they are closely related to The Mysterious Stranger. Known to scholars as the "Great Dark" manu scripts, this group of unfinished narratives offers substantial evidence of Mark Twain's final efforts to create serious stories based on themes which had emerged from years of observation and thought. Professor Tuckey pro vides the basis for a needed reassessment by showing that the present manu scripts, rather than preceding The Mysterious Stranger, were written during the same years. Thus Mark Twain's literary powers may have been more nearly constant than has customarily been assumed. Professor Rogers has gathered twelve previously unpublished pieces in the satires-burlesques volume. Taken together, they illustrate the author's gradual development from a writer of burlesques into an accomplished satirist. Equally im portant, two sequences of related manuscripts illustrate Mark Twain's usual method of constructing fiction—the-step-by-step process by which a short and lighthearted burlesque was transformed into an extended work of serious fiction. As Hamlin Hill notes in the Introduction to his volume on the publishers' correspondence, "it was a dangerously dehumanizing experience to be Mark Twain's publisher; Charles L. Webster became 'not a man, but a hog,' . . . and Webster's successor, Fred J. Hall was transformed into a tadpole." These 290 letters chart in detail all matters concerning the publication of the works from The Jumping Frog in 1867 through Pudd'nheacL Wilson in 1894. They depict both Mark Twain, the author tinkering with his manuscript and marking proof, and Samuel L. Clemens, the businessman ever promoting his own products. As Hill writes, the "often self-contradictory advice and commands became even more confused when Mark Twain's literary interests had to compete with other authors' business interests in addition to his own". . . . Two new critical studies, the third edition of an old warhorse, a Thurber-esque illustrated selection of Mark Twain's animal writings, and a volume of Mark Twain NEWSLETTER 273</page><page sequence="8">William Dean Howells letters add to this quarter's full account. In MARK TWAIN: THE FATE OF HUMOR (Princeton University Press, 1966, $7.50), James M. Cox reverses the usual practice and concentrates upon Mark Twain's humor as the transfiguring power which converted all the tragic issues and serious emotions of his life into narratives of pure pleasure. Cox argues that the greatness of Mark Twain's humor resides in its complete and relentless invasion or subversion of all forms of seriousness and reverence. . . . Robert Regan's UNPROMISING HEROES: MARK TWAIN AND HIS CHARACTERS (University of California Press, 1966, $5) goes to the roots of folklore for the prototypical Mark Twain hero-figure. In these ancient tales the weak and apparently unlovely youngster surprises everyone by slaying dragons, winning a princess, and finally putting his not-very fraternal competitors to shame. Tom Sawyer, the little Prince and his Pauper double, the Connecticut Yankee, and Pudd'nhead Wilson follow this paradigm. And Regan shows the remarkable resemblance of such characters to Sam Clemens himself, who from boyhood played the role of the Un promising Hero. . . . THE BIRDS AND BEASTS OF MARK TWAIN (University of Oklahoma Press, 1966, $4.95), edited by Robert M. Rodney and the late Minnie M. Brashear with attractive illustrations by Robert Roché, reveals a Mark Twain who in his day was as well known for his animal sketches as Thurber was later. Over and over, he goes beyond mere humor to turn his portraits into truthful, though sometimes unflattering insights into the world and human nature. . . . The special attraction of the third edition of Edward Wagenknecht's MARK TWAIN: THE MAN AND HIS WORK (University of Oklahoma Press, $4.95) is a 30-page commentary on Mark Twain criticism and scholarship since 1960. . . . SELECTED MARK TWAIN-HOWELLS LETTERS (Harvard University Press, $9.95) is a wel come condensation of the correspondence, published in two volumes in 1960. Critical apparatus has been reduced, repetitious material omitted, unimportant passages deleted. The co-editors are Frederick Anderson, Henry Nash Smith, and William M. Gibson. (10) Howard Mumford Jones in JEFFERSONIANISM AND THE AMERI CAN NOVEL (Columbia Teachers College, $3.25) puts forth the thesis that the Jeffersonian ideal of social responsibility prevailed in American fiction before 1900 and has been almost totally eclisped in this century. For Pro fessor Jones, William Dean Howells is the prime example of a novelist whose fiction professed the ideas of Jefferson. This view of Howells is traditional—almost sacrosanct. Therefore, a study like George C. Carrington Jr.'s THE IMMENSE COMPLEX DRAMA: THE WORLD AND ART OF THE HOWELLS NOVEL (Ohio State University Press, 1966, $6.25) comes as something of a shocker to anyone who thought he had a neat pigeon-hole for Howells. Some of Professor Carrington's chapter headings are instructive: "Howells and Alienation"; "The Howells Demon"; "The Limits of Negativity." Carrington sets modest limits for his book but emerges with a thoroughly stimulating new view. For him, no novelist knew so well "the central modern American situation: the endlessly re 274 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">newed attempt to plug along, with honor, in a chaotic world." If, occasional ly, Carrington wrenches his man too rudely into a contemporary context, he suggests convincingly that, where for Faulkner it is only the folk who must and do endure, for Howells "all of the mankind that he knows is brought down to . . . troubled day-to-day existence on the thin surface that hides violence and pain." ... In THE LITERARY REALISM OF WIL LIAM DEAN HOWELLS (Southern Illinois University Press, $4.95), William McMurray also ventures in new territory. Professor McMurray compares Howells' realism to the pragmatism of William James. The worlds of both men, he finds, are places where full freedom is impossible because man him self is unable and unwilling to reconcile his intentions and actions. Mc Murray explains that the conflict is reconciled only when the characters accept the imperfection of the human situation. (11) In STEPHEN CRANE: FROM PARODY TO REALISM (Harvard University Press, $5.95), Eric Solomon locates his man "along the lines of the current tradition of black humor as exemplified in the work of John Barth, Joseph Heller, or Vladimir Nabokov." Professor Solomon avoids a flaw of some recent Crane criticism by resisting any impulse to overly ingenious interpretation. He considers the traditions Crane inverted and recreated—the mythos of war, of slum life and the Western—and examines the manner in which he employed parody. The best chapters are those devoted to the lesser-known Crane works which show perhaps better than The Red Badge of Courage or Maggie how far ahead of his time Crane's anatomization of the absurd really was. Solomon finds "The Blue Hotel" as the culminating work in Crane's parodie approach, "for the Swede is a living parody, a badly scared Don Quixote nurtured on dime-novel fiction, whose death, in the finest irony of all, is both a parody and the sole reality of his life." . . . For Crane enthusiasts, there is also the omnibus 800-page COMPLETE NOVELS OF STEPHEN CRANE (Doubleday, $5.95), which contains, for the first time in one volume, the complete first-edition texts of Crane's six novels. Editor Thomas A. Gullason has rendered a major service to scholars on many counts. His volume is die first to contain the final 1896 version of Maggie along with variant readings from the pri vately printed 1893 manuscript and the first to provide the newspaper version of The Red Badge, which appeared in 1894 in the Philadelphia Press. Professor Gullason has written a 100-page Introduction that is painstaking in its scholarship. . . . Crane students are also the beneficiaries of two collec tions of criticism, both edited by Maurice Bassan: STEPHEN CRANE'S MAGGIE: TEXT AND CONTEXT (Wadsworth, $2.25) in the Wadsworth Guides to Literary Study and STEPHEN CRANE: A COLLECTION OF CRITICAL ESSAYS (Prentice-Hall, cloth, $4.95, pb $1.95), a new volume in the Twentieth Century Views series. (12) Willa Cather once wrote of Sarah Orne Jewett, who deeply influenced her: "To note an artist's limitations is but to define his talent." Lacking any self-assertive mystique that might have attracted an influential audience in the last two decades, Willa Cather's novels have attracted fewer and fewer NEWSLETTER 275</page><page sequence="10">champions in recent years. However, in WILLA CATHER AND HER CRITICS (Cornell University Press, $10), Editor James Schroeter has assembled an impressive book of essays. They accomplish a dual purpose: the shedding of light on Willa Cather and the revealing of the swells and ebbs of American critical thinking about a representative novelist. Thus Professor Schroeter holds Miss Cather's aesthetic up to "America's coming-of age" criticism at the time of the publication of My Antonia (1918), the social criticism of the 1930's, and the more recent mythic criticism since her death. The essayists comprise a distinguished list. Leon Edel's assessment reveals how perfectly Miss Cather's feeling about Sarah Orne Jewett applies to her own work: "Willa Cather clung to her rock no matter what tide swept in and swept by. . . . That which diminished her work also proved its strength; the very collapse of her world gave her that radiance of spirit by which Archbishop Latour and Father Vaillant traveled on in the strange land . . . and [to] have wrought this with distinction and feeling is achievement enough." The strength of this book is in its organization which permits the reader to follow the general trends of American criticism over the last century and provides a variety of perspectives on a writer who was in her lifetime acclaimed as a major talent. (13) What distinguishes Robert Sklar's F. SCOTT FITZGERALD: THE LAST LAOCOON (Oxford University Press, $8.50) from other impressive recent books on Fitzgerald is Sklar's attempt to place his subject in historical perspective. According to this account, Fitzgerald was the last important American writer reared in terms of the romantic ideals of the genteel tradi tion, and it was the overcoming of that tradition which explains the power of his fiction—work peculiarly personal, yet so socially oriented that it reflects major movements in twentieth-century philosophy and culture. Whereas the conventional view of Fitzgerald sees him as a man of natural talent but little learning, Sklar demonstrates that he was deeply involved with the intellec tual milieu of his time and that he had great critical as well as creative intelligence. . . . That Sklar is right is demonstrated in a unique way by Sheilah Graham's COLLEGE OF ONE (Viking Press, $5.95). Fitzgerald served as her instructor in a private cram-course of what he considered the Great Books. His reading lists, his comments on the books read by this modern Pygmalion, his meticulous revisions of her compositions, and a 11,000 word lecture published here for the first time add up to convincing proof that Fitzgerald was indeed a well-read man of diverse tastes. We English professors may look down our noses at some of his selections and comments, and we may well wince at the frequent misspellings, but to the extent that we too are students of Fitzgerald, we must be grateful for this valuable and unusual textbook. (14) Fern Marja Eckman's THE FURIOUS PASSAGE OF JAMES BALD WIN (M. Evans 8c Co. and J. B. Lippincott, $4.50) is a difficult book to put down. Written by a prize-winning reporter for the New York Post, it appears to have been assembled on the run. The pace reflects the life rhythm of its subject—breakneck—and yet die author provides a perhaps unparalleled view 276 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="11">of a young novelist "fated to live his novels before he can write them. . . . No face, no incident, no passion is wasted; sooner or later, everything is salvaged and shuttled into the fabric of a novel, a play, a short story, an essay. . . ." So far James Baldwin's passionate involvement with civil rights has made him one of the U.S.'s most controversial writers, but critical opinion has stamped him as a major essayist and a merely promising novelist. Mrs. Eckman's book gives us the best documentation we have for the feeling that Baldwin's main limitation thus far is not that he writes about, but that he writes in, a chaos of violent and transitory passions. He is perpetually excited and therefore perpetually cut off from the deeper and more permanent springs of his own excitement. After her maelstrom account of Baldwin's intense participation in civil rights work, Mrs. Eckman concludes on a hope ful note: "Baldwin's next book . . . could mark his breakthrough into creative maturity, [but] whatever happens, Baldwin will be remembered as the writer who forced upon the consciousness of white-America the terror and wrath of being Negro in the United States." (15) Other new books on individual American novelists include THE RECOGNITION OF HERMAN MELVILLE: SELECTED CRITICISM SINCE 1846 (University of Michigan Press, |7.50), edited by Hershel Parker. This is a generous collection, especially noteworthy for the representation it gives to reviews and other notices of Melville published before the widely heralded "Melville Revival" of the 1920's. That almost half this volume is devoted to pre-1917 appraisals of Melville may well suggest that he was less neglected than is generally supposed. ... Of interest to the Melville specialist will be MELVILLE'S READING: A CHECK-LIST OF BOOKS OWNED AND BORROWED (University of Wisconsin Press, $6), by Merton M. Sealts, Jr. This is a revised and expanded version of the standard reference tool that appeared serially in the Harvard Library Bulletin from 1948 to 1950. It is good to have it available in book-form for the first time. . . . Franklin Walker's JACK LONDON AND THE KLONDIKE: THE GENESIS OF AN AMERICAN WRITER (Huntington Library, $5) supple ments Richard O'Connor's recent biography by focussing on London's ex periences in the gold-rush period of the late 1890's. Walker's scholarly study is of more than biographical interest, however, in that it compares London's own adventures with his fictional treatment of them, thus illuminating his writing methods and creative talent. . . . Having already written biographies of Jack London and Bret Harte, Richard O'Connor now provides AMBROSE BIERCE: A BIOGRAPHY (Little, Brown, $6.95). Like his earlier works, this falls in the popular rather than scholarly category; but O'Connor has done extensive research and come up with new information and conjectures. . . . THE ADDED DIMENSION: THE ART AND MIND OF FLANNERY O'CONNOR (Fordham University Press, $6.95), edited by Melvin J. Fried man and Lewis A. Lawson, is a fitting memorial to the late novelist. It con tains fifteen critical essays, most of them previously unpublished, and a full bibliography. ... For SAUL BELLOW AND THE CRITICS (New York University Press, clotli $6, pb $1.95), Editor Irving Malin has assembled NEWSLETTER 277</page><page sequence="12">twelve critical essays and Bellow's own remarks on "The Future of Fiction." . . . Now that Holt, Rinehart, and Winston has acquired the paperback rights to Barnes and Noble's American Authors and Critics Series, that dormant series is springing to life once again. Sheridan Baker's long-awaited ERNEST HEMINGWAY: AN INTRODUCTION AND INTERPRETATION (11.95) lives up to expectations as a balanced and perceptive general study of Hemingway, and David D. Anderson's SHERWOOD ANDERSON: AN INTRODUCTION AND INTERPRETATION ($1.95) not only provides more evidence of a resurgence of interest in Anderson, but justification for such a revival. (16) Two books, bearing almost the same title, explore what has been, especially for the last two decades, a rich vein in American fiction. Joseph Blotner's THE MODERN AMERICAN POLITICAL NOVEL (University of Texas Press, 1966, $6.75) is perhaps the more scholarly and ambitious of the two. His principal purpose is to discover the image of American politics presented in American novels from 1900 through 1960. Blotner finds that 138 novels meet the terms of the definition used in his study: namely, a work dealing with "the overt institutionalized politics of the officeholder, the candidate, the party official, or the individual who performs political acts as they are conventionally understood." Blotner is interested in the Ameri can archetypes mustered from these novels—the Young Knight, the Boss, the Southern Politico, the Lincoln-figure, the McCarthy-figure, the Long figure. Inferentially, Blotner wishes to stack up these emergent archetypes against Walt Whitman's dream of a "liberatus," a great national poet, and a cluster of "national expressers," who would give expression to the true nature and promise of this country. The conclusion of this major study is that the Lincoln-figure has disappeared from U.S. fiction and that newer archetypes—the McCarthy-Long figures—show signs of posing threats to fundamental parts of the American political system. The trend in recent years, Blotner finds, has been away from light toward darkness: a failure, then, of Whitman's dream. . . . Like Walter French's The Social Novel at the End of an Era, which tried to rescue two admirable novels of the thirties from limbo—Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun and Pietro Di Donato's Christ in Concrete, a major service of Gordon Milne's THE AMERICAN POLITICAL NOVEL (University of Oklahoma Press, 1966, $4.95) may be similarly to rescue certain worthy fictions from the obscurity brought on by the changing face of American political life. While Robert Penn Warren's All the Kings Men (1946) continues to earn royalties, a fine novel like Lionel Trilling's The Middle of the Journey, published one year after War ren's book, may get deserved benefit from Milne's readable study. The book fell victim to antipathy in the wake of the Cold War but deserves, as Milne shows, a better fate for artistry that is rare in the political novel. Milne is largely descriptive rather than critical about such recent best-sellers as O'Connor's The Last Hurrah (1956) and Drury's Advise and Consent (1959), but he can say of the latter, that the style veers from "rhapsodic overwriting to limping journalese and seldom if ever achieves a supple, 278 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="13">natural flow." One concludes from both the Blotner and Milne volumes that art and analysis are rarely blended successfully in a political novel. There is, Blotner sums up, a "vast amount of dross appearing in a genre which produced Nostromo and All the King's Men." (17) Easily combined here are two new books on the 1930's. THINK BACK ON US: A CONTEMPORARY CHRONICLE OF THE 1930's (Southern Illinois University Press, $10) is Henry Dan Piper's selection of the reviews and essays written by Malcolm Cowley during that decade. This substantial volume is divided into two sections—"The Social Record" and "The Literary Record." Among the pieces in the latter are commentaries on Pearl Buck, Dos Passos, Farrell, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Wolfe, and Richard Wright— as well as non-Americans Louis Aragon, André Malraux, Thomas Mann, Roger Martin du Gard, W. Somerset Maugham, Sean O'Faolain, Mikhael Sholokhov, Ignazio Silone, and Virginia Woolf. ... Edited by Warren French, THE THIRTIES: FICTION, POETRY, DRAMA (Deland, Florida: Everett Edwards, $7.50) is an impressive collection of 28 previously un published papers by various critics. Included are essays on James M. Cain, Dos Passos, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Henry Miller, Henry Roth, Steinbeck, Nathanael West, Wolfe, and Wright. (18) Teachers of courses in modern American fiction may well welcome for use as a supplementary text THE MODERN AMERICAN NOVEL: ESSAYS IN CRITICISM (Random House, pb $1.95), edited by Max Westbrook. This handy volume contains essays on a representative selec tion of widely taught works: Irving Howe on Winesburg, Ohio, Ihab Hassan on Henderson the Rain King, Richard Lehan on An American Tragedy, William J. Handy on As I Lay Dying, Lawrance Thompson on The Sound and the Fury, Douglas Taylor on The Great Gatsby, Clinton S. Burhans, Jr. on The Old Man and the Sea, Norman Friedman on A Farewell to Arms, Robert W. Lewis, Jr., on The Sun Also Rises, Maxwell Geismar*on Sinclair Lewis, J. C. O'Hara on The Catcher in the Rye, Peter Lisca on The Grapes of Wrath, James Ruoff on All the King's Men, and J. Russell Reaver and Robert I. Strozier on Thomas Wolfe. (19) Of recent books that deal only in part with modern American fiction perhaps the most provocative is Richard Poirier's A WORLD ELSEWHERE: THE PLACE OF STYLE IN AMERICAN LITERATURE (Oxford Uni versity Press, 1966, $5.75). Poirier is not so much concerned with style in its technical aspects as with style as a form of expression that is both psychological and social. Seeking to identify a peculiarly "American" style of writing, he analyses certain key passages from our literature and con cludes that our best writers have constantly sought to break free from the artificial barriers of language in their attempt to create a stylistic "environ ment" in which they can express publicly their most deeply private selves, thus " 'building' a world out of the self in a style that is that self." There may be a certain patness about this thesis (if America is "the land of the free," we might expect to find that our writers seek freedom even in their NEWSLETTER 279</page><page sequence="14">writing), but Poirier often overcomes this weakness in his discussions of such writers as Hawthorne, Mark Twain, the Jameses, Edith Wharton, Dreiser, and others To the extent that Jay Martin's HARVESTS OF CHANGE: AMERICAN LITERATURE, 1865-1914 (Prentice-Hall, $7.50) sees the writers of the period in terms of the ideas and expectations of the age, his com pendious history may be considered—in purpose if not entirely in achievement —a sequel to Matthiessen's American Renaissance. In considering most of the representative writers of the period, Martin does a good job of grouping the minor figures in terms of clearly defined movements and intellectual tendencies. The two greatest novelists of the period—Twain and James are given extended treatment, with the long chapter on James serving as a sort of climax to the whole book and the period it covers. James' achieve ment, it is suggested, is in large part the achievement of the period which he alone transcended. . . . FLESH OF STEEL: LITERATURE AND THE MACHINE IN AMERICAN CULTURE (Vanderbilt University Press, $4.50), by Thomas Reed West, is a study of eight twentieth-century writers who demonstrate with particular clarity the impact of the machine on our modern literary consciousness. West finds that though "the dominant attitude towards the machine and its disciplines ... is one of repudiation," many of the authors he studies were conscious that potentially, if not in fact, the machine civilization of our time could enrich the citizen's awareness of energy and discipline, and in the formation of a polarity between these two concepts, fairly rejuvenate his sense of social involvement. Sherwood Anderson, Waldo Frank, John Dos Passos, and Sinclair Lewis are the novelists represented. CONTINENTALS (20) John Bayley, whose The Characters of Love (1961) remains in our memory as one of the half-dozen or so most important books reviewed in these pages during the past twelve years, has turned out an almost equally im pressive successor in his TOLSTOY AND THE NOVEL (Viking Press, $6.95). We say almost equally impressive, for if what mainly distinguished that earlier book was the successful application of a strikingly original thesis that has much influenced later writers on character in fiction, Tolstoy and the Novel is a more discursive, less tightly controlled work. No single idea seems to dominate Bayley's consideration of Tolstoy, but the book is filled with brilliant insights that flash in many directions. Part of the appeal of the book is its frequent comparisons with other writers, for this is as much a study of the novel in general as it is a study of Tolstoy. Appropriately, there fore, Bayley's final chapter focuses on Dr. Zliivago as the most prominent example of the legacy left by Tolstoy. . . . TOLSTOY: A COLLECTION OF CRITICAL ESSAYS (Prentice-Hall, cloth $4.95, pb $1.95), edited by Ralph Matlaw, is a representative addition to the Twentieth Century Views series. . . . THE NOTEBOOKS FOR CRIME AND PUNISHMENT (University of Chicago Press, $6.95), edited and translated by Edward Wasiolek, is the first of a series of such volumes that will make available in English Dostoev sky's preliminary notes towards the writing of his major novels. Professor 280 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="15">Wasiolek, whose editing of the notebooks seems to be impeccable, is also responsible for a recent addition to the Wadsworth Guides to Literary Study: THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV AND THE CRITICS (pb $2.25). Like his previous volume on Crime and Punishment in the same series, this one incorporates some material not previously available in English. (21) In THE NOVELS OF FLAUBERT: A STUDY OF THEMES AND TECHNIQUES (Princeton University Press, 1966, $7.50), Victor Brombert devotes a chapter to each of the novels and novelles, but emphasizes through out the essential unity behind these seemingly disparate works. Brombert sees Flaubert as a haunted writer, whose novels from Madame Bovary to Bouvard and Pécuchet are subconscious, symbolic autobiography that reflect his private obsessions in their larger motifs. By thus exploring more deeply and thoroughly than has been done before the "Madame Bovary—c'est moi" aspect of Flaubert, Brombert goes a long way towards amending the standard view of him as a founder of the Realistic school of writing. In Brombert's view Flaubert was in fact the paradigm Romantic, a writer closer in tem perament and aspiration to Baudelaire than to Balzac. Like the former, Flaubert sought in art "a dizzying dilation, an aspiration vers l'infini." It is easy enough to reverse the conventional view of any great, complex writer, but the test of the reversal lies in its application to the individual writings. Brombert, we think, succeeds admirably in giving us fresh readings of Flaubert's fiction. (22) Three other new books on individual French novelists fall in the no cheers-but-polite-applause-category. Erika Ostrovsky's CELINE AND HIS VISION (New York University Press, cloth $7.95, pb $2.25) sees Céline as more poet than novelist. Montaigne's mot that "philosopher c'est apprendre à mourir" is endorsed in the novels of Céline. But the apocalyptic tone, the juxtaposition of deformity to laughter, and the meaninglessness of the néant across which Céline's scapegoats must caper indicate that for Céline it was a difficult lesson. Miss Ostrovsky, however, maintains that the horror and the chaos are transposed into poetry, because reality for Céline was clearly unbearable and only the poetic effort of seeing life through a mirror could alleviate his refusal to countenance it à l'état pur. . . . Whereas Miss Ostrovsky concentrates on Céline's art and devotes only a small portion of her book to biographical detail, Maxwell A. Smith's JEAN GIONO (Twayne's World Authors Series, $3.95) alternates biographical chapters with chapters de voted to the novels. Nonetheless, this is a work of descriptive rather than interpretative criticism, and its value lies largely in its being the only com prehensive treatment of Giono in English. . . . Also published in Twayne's newest rapidly growing series is Elliott M. Grant's EMILE ZOLA ($3.95). Although its approach is similar to that of Professor Smith's Jean Giono, it attempts more in the way of critical interpretation and provides just, if unspectacular assessments of the various works of Zola and the literary issues they still raise. It does not, however, threaten the eminence of Professor F. W. J. Hemmings' work. NEWSLETTER 281</page><page sequence="16">(23) Although STYLE AND TEMPER: STUDIES IN FRENCH FICTION, 1925-1960 (Harvard University Press, $3.95), by W. M. Frohock, consists of papers originally not intended for book form, the author's treatment of them here makes for a unified work. Novelists under review are André Gide, Henry de Montherlant, Antoine de Saint Exupery, Georges Bernanos, Céline, Jean Giono, Sartre, and Camus. They do not form a group or school politically or philosophically, but they have in common the fact that their writings focus on the individual as hero. The particular interest of their fiction is the perception of their heroes, and the climax of their novels tends to fall on the accession of truth, the epiphany, the illumination which those solitaries attain in their moments of crisis. . . . Henri Peyre's FRENCH NOVELISTS OF TODAY (Oxford University Press, $10) is a third-stage revision of a book most recently known as The Contemporary French Novel (1955). Professor Peyre adds a new chapter on Bernanos, Céline, and Julien Green; gives Simone de Beauvoir and Albert Camus expanded attention; and perhaps most significantly adds a long chapter on the "new" novel with principal emphasis on Nathalie Sarraute, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Claude Simon, Michael Butor, Violette Leduc, and J. M. G. Le Clézio. Also discussed at length are Roger Martin du Gard, Georges Duhamel, Jules Romains, Raymond Radiguet, Gide, Proust, Mauriac, Giono, Saint-Exupéry, Malraux, and Sartre. More than adequate bibliographies and appendices on other contemporary writers give this book increased reference value as perhaps the standard survey of the modern French novel. MISCELLANY (24) The Editor of MFS still stubbornly believes that the widely heralded marriage of religion and literature recorded begrudgingly in these pages for at least a decade is doomed to divorce once both parties realize that they are basically incompatible (Morse Peckham's Beyond the Tragic Vision remains our authority on the subject), but for all that, we admire Nathan A. Scott's equally stubborn willingness to officiate at the wedding again and again. The reason for our admiration is that among contemporary theologians Scott has proved himself the most visibly knowledgeable about literature. Whereas his Modern Literature and the Religious Frontier (1958) was, he admitted, a tentative effort to explore the areas of communion between the literary and the religious imagination, whether in a state of accord or conflict, his recent THE BROKEN CENTER: STUDIES IN THE THEOLOGICAL HORIZON OF MODERN LITERATURE (Yale University Press, 1966, $5) sets off more confidently—perhaps because he has found an abundance of critical support for his hypothesis. "Not only does the literature of our time," he proclaims, "most emphatically initiate theological inquiry, but my conviction also grows that the major poetry and fiction and drama of the time do indeed form a great literature and that Christian theology as a result of its dialogue with the literary imagination will find itself more richly repaid . . . than by any similar transaction into which it may enter." To that statement we would emphatically subscribe, but when Professor Scott 282 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="17">attempts to demonstrate the alliance he looks so slantingly at such writers as Kafka, Faulkner, Camus, Warren, Lowry, Malraux, Gide, and Joyce that it is no wonder that we find no single chapter of his book as informative and challenging as the individual essays he earlier collected for his pamphlet sized FORMS OF EXTREMITY IN THE MODERN NOVEL (John Knox Press, 1965, pb $1). In less than a hundred pages, Scott and three other the ologically inclined critics—John Killinger, William Hamilton, and Raymond Chapman—appraise the fiction of Kafka, Hemingway, Camus, and Graham Greene in terms that seem to us admirably balanced and only wishfully mis sionary. ... It is hardly an accident that Scott is one of the first contributors to a new series of phamphlets entitled Contemporary Writers in Christian Perspective ($0.85 each) published by William B. Eerdmans of Grand Rapids, Michigan. In addition to Scott's ERNEST HEMINGWAY, available titles are CHARLES WILLIAMS, by Mary McDermott Shideler; FLANNERY O'CONNOR, by Robert Drake; PETER DE VRIES, by Roderick Jellema; and JOHN UPDIKE by Wesley Kort. (25) Harold Kaplan, in THE PASSIVE VOICE: AN APPROACH TO MODERN FICTION (Ohio University Press, 1966, $5), sets up a strong theoretical base to support and frame his considerations of six major modern novelists. In the opening chapter, "The Solipsism of Modern Fiction," Kaplan argues that "the characteristic extremes in modern fiction have moved between the two sharply opposed perspectives of objective naturalism and subjective impressionism. What they have in common is a fear of the solipsistic impasse and a compulsive drive to establish the sense of reality." No longer accepting the old anthropomorphic view of a protecting world designed for man's benefit, modern writers have had to replace the emphasis on action which pervades early fiction with a championing of the individual human consciousness: "We can live in any dream," Kaplan concludes, "so long as we are convinced of the reality of the dreamer." Although this approach to modern literature is less unique and original than Kaplan some times strains to imply, it is certainly a viable, workable approach, as demon strated by Kaplan's intelligent discussions of Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Joyce, Hemingway, Faulkner's Light in August, Conrad, and Lawrence. (26) The subjective, introspective quality of much modern fiction is also the concern of Peter M. Axthelm in THE MODERN CONFESSIONAL NOVEL (Yale University Press, $5.75). The latest release in the Yale College Series of outstanding honors theses written by Yale seniors, this is a solid work of re search and interpretation that finds the origins of the modern confessional novel in Dostoevsky; discusses Gide, Sartre, and Camus under the heading, "A Disintegrated World"; follows "The Search for a Reconstructed Order" in Arthur Koestler and William Golding; and ultimately finds "The Full Perception" in Saul Bellow's Herzog. Carefully conceived in theme and range, this well written book testifies to both the merit of Yale's Honors Program and the abilities of Mr. Axthelm. A 1965 graduate of Yale College, he is already a frequently by-lined staff writer for Sports Illustrated. Some NEWSLETTER 283</page><page sequence="18">how that bit of information on the jacket of Axthelm's promising work of scholarship makes us feel a little sad, somewhat envious, and very old. (27) Unlike Peter Axthelm, who moved from literary criticism to a different kind of sportswriting, James Guetti has gone on from an undergraduate honors thesis on Conrad published by Amherst in I960 to a Cornell Ph.D. and the publication of his THE LIMITS OF METAPHOR: A STUDY OF MELVILLE, CONRAD, AND FAULKNER (Cornell University Press, $6.50). Although the range of this book is narrow—Guetti concentrates his attention on Moby-Dick, Heart of Darkness, and Absalom, Absalom\—his approach is complex and his purpose unusually ambitious. He argues that the disintegra tion of traditional structures in modern fiction is the result not so much of social, religious, or cultural changes as the contemporary writer's awareness of a fundamental instability in the nature of language. Melville, Conrad, and Faulkner attempt to move by metaphor towards meanings which at heart they know are inexpressible. This brief description may make Guetti's approach seem extremely negative, even nihilistic, but by rejecting the con ventional critical assumption that fiction strives towards some kind of "ulti mate resolution," Guetti argues that the most significant modern fiction is precisely that which attempts to express an "ineffable reality" which its authors know can never be expressed fully. What Walter Slatoff, for example, saw as a Quest for Failure in Faulkner's writings is seen by Guetti as a measure of his importance as a reflector of the modern literary consciousness. (28) Printed versions of the memorable Invitation to Learning radio broad casts are still checklisted in these and other pages, but they have become increasingly difficult to come by. Most of the better discussions of fiction are now conveniently gathered in INVITATION TO LEARNING: ENGLISH AND AMERICAN NOVELS (Basic Books, 1966, $7.50), edited by George Crothers, producer of the program from 1948 to 1964 and moderator after Lyman Bryson's death in 1959. The roll call of participants includes many of the most distinguished critics of our time, and the extemporaneous nature of the discussions results in both striking insights and occasional unsights, but it is good to have the transcriptions available in a more per manent form. English novels within the MFS baliwick included among the 33 discussions in this ample volume are The Mill on the Floss, The Way of All Flesh, Tess of The D'Urbervilles, The Mayor of Casterbridge, The Forsyte Saga, Sons and Lovers, and Ulysses. Modern American novels are Moby-Dick, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Rise of Silas Lapham, The Ambas sadors, The Red Badge of Courage, The Professor's House, Sister Carrie, An American Tragedy, Main Street, The Great Gatsby, A Farewell to Arms, The Sound and the Fury, and Look Homeward, Angel. (29) Among other current books that deal only in part with modern fiction Frank Kermode's THE SENSE OF AN ENDING: STUDIES IN THE THEORY OF FICTION (Oxford University Press, $5.75) is perhaps the most generalized of all. In fact, we wonder why he used "fiction" rather than "literature" in his sub-title, for Kermode's principal concern in these six 284 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="19">Mary Flexner lectures delivered at Bryn Mawr College in 1965 is with the peculiarly forceful awareness of time and the necessity to transcend it that seems to be shared by all kinds of writers. Ranging from Shakespeare and Spenser to such contemporary novelists as Robbe-Grillet, but giving extended attention to no single writer, Kermode shows how an "apocalyptic vision" goes a long way towards not only explaining the existence of literature, but justifying it. . . . Also very theoretical is René Girard's DECEIT, DESIRE, AND THE NOVEL: SELF AND OTHER IN LITERARY STRUCTURE (Johns Hopkins Press, 1966, $6.95). In the works of five major European writers—Cervantes, Stendhal, Flaubert, Proust, and Dostoevsky, Girard finds a significantly similar psychological pattern which enables him to isolate and define a particular kind of novel. The hero of this archetypal novel is never motivated by his own values; he never chooses objects of desire by himself, but lets a model choose for him; and the "novels which reveal mediated desire are the fruit of a painful experience which is usually expressed sym bolically by the final enlightenment and death of the hero". . . . John Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, and George Orwell are among many writers discussed in John M. Muste's SAY THAT WE SAW SPAIN DIE: LITER ARY CONSEQUENCES OF THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR (University of Washington Press, 1966, $5.95). Readers interested in the social and historical background of modern literature will find this a valuable, smoothly written book that demonstrates clearly the impact of the Spanish Civil War on writers of the period. . . . Andrew Lytle has collected his non-fictional writ ings in THE HERO WITH THE PRIVATE PARTS (Louisiana State University Press, $6). Included are papers on Madame Bovary and Stephen Crane's "The Open Boat" as well as an essay on Caroline Gordon and reviews of Hemingway's A Moveable Feast and three novels by Faulkner. . . . Considering the way this Newsletter began, it is perhaps appropriate that the book notices should conclude with THE TROUBLESOME HELPMATE: A HISTORY OF MISOGYNY IN LITERATURE. In this learned and readable survey of the cautious and hostile attitude towards Woman held by male writers from the Greeks to the moderns, Katherine M. Rogers has provided a welcome balance to Robert Graves' White Goddess. Sinclair Lewis, Hemingway, Lawrence, and Faulkner are considered at some length. Only a courageous woman could have written this book (no man would have dared), for The Troublesome Helpmate is a literary history that ought to be especially appreciated by married men. Joseph Conrad would have liked it. (30) Two imposing new journals devoted to fiction in general have been announced in recent months. Novel: A Forum on Fiction will appear thrice yearly beginning in the fall of 1967. Edited by Edward A. Bloom, Park Honan, and Mark Spilka, all of Brown University, it will feature essays of a comparative and theoretical nature rather than explications. Contributions and subscriptions (at $3.50 a year) may be sent to Box 1984, Brown Univer sity, Providence, Rhode Island, 02912. . . . James W. Lee of the English De partment at North Texas State University in Denton will edit Studies in the NEWSLETTER 285</page><page sequence="20">Novel, a quarterly scheduled to begin in early 1969. He informs us that his journal will be rather similar to MFS in appearance and plan, but, of course, much wider in scope. Two issues a year will be general numbers; the other two will be devoted to individual writers or special topics. The first six special numbers will deal with Dickens, Melville, Fielding, American Negro novelists, Thomas Mann, and twentieth-century British comedy and irony. ... In addition to these welcome new journals, we should call attention to three new publications devoted to individual writers: The Frederic Herald is the name of a newsletter about Harold Frederic edited by Thomas F. O'Don nell from Utica College of Syracuse University in Utica, New York; P. A. Doyle of Nassau Community College in Garden City, New York, has started an Evelyn Waugh Newsletter; and James C.
