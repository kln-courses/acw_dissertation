   <page sequence="1"> Leonor Antunes, Perturbing Vision:  the state of being possible, A Leonor Antunes Portfolio 2007, leather, — Nuria Enguita Mayo dimensions variable.  Courtesy the artist Nuria Enguita Mayo addresses the problems of duplication, faktura and restriction  as they appear in Leonor Antunes’s work.  Leonor Antunes’s sculpture is configured in space by means of an extremely precise  staging, which in turn generates and transforms the space it occupies. Her sculptures  strike up a dialogue which constantly renews itself; a dialogue into which the spectator  can furtively enter through its intervals — the spaces defined by the presence of the  sculptures, between their shapes and their surroundings. Once inside, apprehension  of her work necessarily entails abandoning the hope of any symbolic interpretation.  Her sculptures are not rooted in any primordial origin, nor do they represent or  document a reality that is outside of them. As a result, viewers are always perturbed  by her work: in the first place by its density, its texture and its composition — the means  by which it constructs its meaning. In this sense, the work could be said to be typically  ‘modern’, as it vindicates its formal nature, its ‘construction’. But the sculptures also  recognise their historical and anthropological context. For Antunes, sculpture must  be related to the way it appears and the way bodies gain access to it. All her work partakes  of the silent anthropomorphism that Georges Didi-Huberman discusses in relation to Tony Smith and Robert Morris’s sculptures (in opposition to Rosalind Krauss’s  understanding of Minimalism as lacking inner signification). Size, scale and proportion  are key to her work; her sculptures focus on this connection, on the interval between  us and the presence of the works. Disproportion, miniature and monumentalisation  are lines of investigation for Antunes, but in her work the human scale, that ‘silent  anthropomorphism’, is perturbed in many other ways. • Modos de usar #1, #2 and #3 (how to use, 2003—ongoing) are three measurement  instruments made of rubber and copper, designed by Antunes for the space where  they were to be used — the MARCO museum in Vigo, Spain, a former prison with a  panopticon structure. Antunes called attention to the scale of the building by constructing  on the floor a platform of the same measurement as one of the skylights in the exhibition  room. Placed just below its model, the platform supported the tools that were made  to measure it, the three modos de usar. Through this transformation of the vacuum of  space into the solid of the platform, Antunes disrupts the objectivity of measurements  and of its conventional instruments, proposing instead a new means of experiencing  and observing that allows for a more intense relationship of bodies moving in space.  Modo de usar #4 (2003) further explores this will to actively intervene in the space and  unsettle the spectator, by giving him or her an eye-bolt screw, two golden nails and an  elastic band with which to measure the exhibition space. Through this arrangement,  space is marked and narrated, and each visitor’s life is made manifest as an element  the moment the action is executed — an act of archiving that also enables us to think  of the present as an archive. When the visitor is finished measuring, the instruments  are returned to their box — its sculpture — which is also a container. As in children’s  games, which create their own spatial reality, the sculpture lives exclusively in its use.   With this work, Antunes refers to Marcel Duchamp’s Sculpture de voyage  (Sculpture for Travelling, 1918), in its always temporary appearances, its transportability  and its capacity to transform the spaces where it is installed.  98 | Afterall Leonor Antunes | 99 </page>
   <page sequence="2"> Antunes belongs to a genealogy of artists (Duchamp, Hamish Fulton, Isidoro Valcárcel Leonor Antunes,  Medina, John Cage, Rodney Graham...) who, starting from a fixed structure, method the surface of a room  and form, suggest that memory and imagination don’t obey precise instructions or given on which one stands,  concepts, and that measurement — despite or specifically because of its strict regulations 2007, brass, wenge  — cannot avoid the immaterial. For Antunes, contingency is an integral part of any wood, Scandinavian  effort to measure or symbolically codify time and space, because, as Didi-Huberman wooden lamp,  says, ‘space is not given when measured, when it's objectified. Space is distant, deep, dimensions variable.  inaccessible. It is always there, around and in front of us.’1 Courtesy the artist  Duchamp’s concept of the inframince, the potency of meaning derived from his  readymades, and the writing of Oulipo members Raymond Queneau and Georges Perec  in works such as Exercises in Style (1947) and Life, A User’s Manual (1978) have already  been mentioned elsewhere as possible antecedents for the modos de usar.2 These are  apparent in the artist’s interest in measurement as an area of possibility (in relation  to body and space) and in the material potency of pure gesture — as opposed to ‘making’  or ‘playing’. Further, she takes a dialectical approach to shapes and forms from the past,  both by duplicating the static (in reference to the object) and the temporal (in reference  to the event). Like Duchamp or the members of the group Oulipo, for whom literary  and artistic creation was not only practice and game but also labour, Antunes thinks  of sculpture as work and, furthermore, as a tool, in its material and contingent nature.3   The literary experiments of Oulipo push to the limit the notion of ‘restriction’  applied to the literary work, while following the teachings of Stéphane Mallarmé,  for whom language can (must) be treated as an object in itself — as matter. Starting  from the belief that all literary work must follow a series of pre-established rules,  these authors propose new restrictions, based on the importing of mathematical  concepts or the use of combinatory principles. Surprisingly, in this strictly arbitrary  following of the rule, where there is no trace of ‘authenticity’ and ‘sincerity’,  a stimulus, freedom or subjectivity might emerge. Other masters in the use of chance,  such as John Cage, also proved that the arbitrary and the aleatory, its mutations  and combinations, allowed for a discipline without intentionality. (Here chance  is not related to Surrealist automatism, which is always attached to memory and  personal taste.)   This notion of restriction is fundamental to Antunes’s work, and is apparent in  her obsession for both measurement and duplication. Her focus is on the investigation  or measuring of what is given, what already exists, and the examination of what  happens when it is duplicated, when it is disturbed in the present. As Doris von  Drathen has pointed out, each of her objects constitutes ‘a reservoir of levels of  appearance’ — an appearance that is not related to the transcendent or to belief  systems.4    Modos de usar #7, #8, #9, #10 and #11, all from 2005, are construction kits for  geometrical structures that must be assembled by the audience, to reproduce, with the  same materials and at the same scale, a fragment (part of the floor, a column) of some  specific buildings ‘duplicated’ after the partition of Berlin — modernist icons built  between 1961 and 1989, such as Hans Scharoun’s Staatsbibliothek, Rolf Gutbrod’s  Kunstgewerbemuseum, the Fernsehturm, Werner Düttmann’s Akademie der Künste or Mies van der Rohe’s Neue Nationalgalerie. With these works, Antunes offers  anachronisms, fragments that she has taken out of context and which therefore acquire  a new reality. The sculptures, made of brass, copper, aluminium and stainless steel,  do not suggest interiority, but are made accessible in the space in a way that subjectivises  them, allowing for a productive access to the past and its memory.  • 1 See Georges Didi-Huberman, Lo que vemos, lo que nos mira (trans.

   <page sequence="3"> Leonor Antunes, Recently, Antunes has focused her attention on the work of several modern architects  ‘duplicate', 2005, from whom she has taken forms for her sculptural objects: Eileen Gray, Carlo Mollino,  installation view, Robert Mallet-Stevens and Flávio de Carvalho, among others.

Courtesy she presented paving stones across the entire garden, spine wall suppressed all  the artist thoughts, avoiding mistral wind and the lacquer screen of E.G. (all 2008). On this  occasion, drawing closer to Russian formalism, modern architecture and Eva Hesse’s  post-Minimalism, Antunes defends the autonomy of their forms, both in terms of their  material and their meaning — as the Russian Constructivist would say, their faktura,  their texture and materiality, as well as the use of the inherent characteristics of their  materials, chosen precisely because of their expressive abilities: their form, weight,  texture and colour. Antunes also defends the organic nature of their form, understood  as process and development. Lastly, and as mentioned earlier, these sculptures make  apparent their means of construction (through repetition, seriality or geometry) and  the gestures that lead to their assemblage (oftentimes elementary gestures, such as tying,  folding, hanging, aligning or bending). Hanging from the ceiling or the wall, lying on  the floor and illuminated in a way that creates perspectives and contrasts of light and  shadows, the sculptures are inscribed within a bodily and temporal present. They refuse  to be read through a symbolic content, but rather through the tension that is integral  to their form and the extraordinary material density they display. Antunes’s work,  like that of Eva Hesse, but also Mira Schendel or Gego, turns sculpture into a space  of possibility, a place of habit, the locus for constructing an experience.  • Continuing her interest in reproduction and doubling, and the exchange between  different systems, in 2008 Antunes (who is Portuguese) travelled to Brazil, a country  into which the Portuguese language and architecture were transplanted, and specifically  Rio de Janeiro, a city that lived through some of the most intense cultural and political  developments of modernity — which has resulted in a rich and complex cultural heritage  in architecture, visual arts, cinema, literature and music, thanks to authors such as  Mário de Andrade, Flávio de Carvalho, Lucio Costa, Lina Bo Bardi, Lygia Clark, Hélio  Oiticica, Tom Zé, Caetano Veloso and Glauber Rocha.   Architectura, which she made during her stay in Brazil, focuses on the idea of  an architectural nature, a designed nature, constructed as part of the utopic dream  of modernity. The Tijuca Forest is a man-made, urban forest that was declared a nature  reserve in 1861; it was planted in the second half of the nineteenth century under  the rule of Pedro II as an attempt to bring back some of the natural resources that had  been destroyed to make room for coffee farms. With the help of a group of architects  and topographers, Antunes set herself the task of measuring a liana, a vine that for  her ‘represents a structure within the forest — an architectural space defined by a system  of trees’.5 To treat an organic structure (apparently chaotic, but in fact with a complex  and precise internal order) as architecture — in an impulse opposed to architecture’s  naturalist tendencies — suggests a mental displacement in both the artist and the viewer  that sparks off a heightened internal formal expressiveness of the object. The liana  creates a habitat where movement can take place, much like architecture, which Antunes  5 Statement from the Beca de Artes Plásticas Award, Fundación Marcelino Botín, Santander, 2008.

Also made while 107 in Brazil, 1763—2008 reflects Antunes’s interest in history, the duration of the past Events, Works, Exhibitions and its possible reconstructions in the present in a manner close to Walter Benjamin’s  consideration of remembrance when he discusses the sparkles of history that,  in the form of an image (here a sculpture), present us with new knowledge.7   In Rio de Janeiro Antunes bought a gold coin made in 1763, during the rule of  King José I.8 In an iconoclastic gesture, Antunes recast the coin in gold as if to restore it  to its original state, and placed it on a wooden block made of Pau-Brasil (or Brazilwood),  a type of wood that owes its name to the Portuguese ‘fathers’ (Pau), and which has  almost become extinct. The work was completed by a certificate of purchase of the  coin. Through the transformation of the coin into simple gold, the effigy as a trace  that gave value to the coin and gave form to the economic transactions in the old  colonies was erased. This erasure, this absolute denial, constitutes the work and  overcomes the connotations of the initial object, placing the object in an expanded  time and space. 109  Didi-Huberman has written: ‘Benjamin understood memory not as the possession Flávio de Carvalho: From an  of what is remembered — a having, a collection of things past — but as an always Anthropophagic Master Plan dialectical approximation to the relation things past have to their place, that is, to a Tropical Modern Design  as the approximation itself to its taking place.’ 9 Leonor Antunes’s sculptures share  — Inti Guerrero these anachronisms, that transference of objects in time, these returns.

The liana  creates a habitat where movement can take place, much like architecture, which Antunes  5 Statement from the Beca de Artes Plásticas Award, Fundación Marcelino Botín, Santander, 2008.

The work was completed by a certificate of purchase of the  coin. Through the transformation of the coin into simple gold, the effigy as a trace  that gave value to the coin and gave form to the economic transactions in the old  colonies was erased. This erasure, this absolute denial, constitutes the work and  overcomes the connotations of the initial object, placing the object in an expanded  time and space. 109  Didi-Huberman has written: ‘Benjamin understood memory not as the possession Flávio de Carvalho: From an  of what is remembered — a having, a collection of things past — but as an always Anthropophagic Master Plan dialectical approximation to the relation things past have to their place, that is, to a Tropical Modern Design  as the approximation itself to its taking place.’ 9 Leonor Antunes’s sculptures share  — Inti Guerrero these anachronisms, that transference of objects in time, these returns.
