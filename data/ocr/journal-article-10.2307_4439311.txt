<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Biology Teacher, Animal Health and Disease in the Space Age* D. H. FERRIS, University of Illinois, Urbana To delimit this subject to manageable pro- portions this paper is concerned only with major aspects of animal health and disease in the next ten to twenty years, particularly as they may affect the biology teacher. How important does the public consider biology in the space age? A particular Ameri- can answer was given to this question when the first Sputnik was orbited. Salaries of all government employees directly concerned with the physical sciences were immediately raised. Those concerned with the biological sciences (including medical and veterinary medical doctors) were not raised until strong protests were made. There can be no denying that during the past decade or so the biological sciences have been eclipsed by the physical sciences. Although major developments have taken place in biology during the recent years which may someday be judged as epochal, the twin satellites of nuclear fission and space explora- tion have cast a deep shadow on biological ad- vances at least in public recognition and un- derstanding. Unfortunately, even though an eclipse is temporary, and in few ways changes the basic structure of the thing shadowved, there may be unfortunate side effects. One of these side effects is the comparative loss of public support. Another is the loss of capable young minds. This is stated, not in envy, but in admiration of and gratitude to the physical sciences. It is well recognized that biology itself, although a more complex por- tion of the scientific spectrum, is a part of physical sciences. The physical sciences have started the space age with tremendous public support and in- terest. By their achievements and good public relations they have wrought a miraculous change in attitude toward all sciences. Con- sider, for example, mathematics, physics, -and astronomy in 1900. These were considered dull subjects to most youthful scholars and highly abstract or theoretical subjects by busi- nessmen. Biology, on the other hand, was fighting a valiant crusade for new concepts in evolution, genetics, and microbiology. Microbiology, at first stoutly resisted by nmany of the profession, had begun to trans- form medicine. Nothing in the history of man can compare with the gift of health and lon- gevity which this profession has made to the human race. But the true source of this bless- ing has eluded all but our keenest minds. The scientific status of medicine, a part of the bio- logical complex of sciences, has always been related to the milieu of concept, theory, and knowledge which forms the basic biology of any given period. What is the relationship of basic research in biology today? First, we need to consider science generally. Nearly everyone is in a position of practical leadership, "yes, but's" any basic research. It is for someone else. Certainly it is not for prac- tical men with immediate problems. Few of our political, business, or industrial leaders have an inkling of the necessity for fundamental research in solving our burgeon- ing problems (12). Confidential questionnaires initiated and summarized by the National Sci- ence Foundation show that less than 2 ?2 % of the research dollar of industry is spent for any form of basic research (11). Even the federal government which actively publicizes its in- terest in basic research spends less than 3.75 % of its research funds this way. Actually, as Fisher (6) has shown by a study of research publications from industry, the 212 %r is too high. Much of the so-calied "basic research" is directly related to the immediate concerns of the company; this is particularly true of the pharmaceutical industry, in which both small and large companies are forced to do "basic" research to remain in competition. Truesdall and Dunn (1 3) point out that the universities, traditionally the seat of basic research, are all *Dr. Ferris is Associate Professor, Department of Veterinary Pathology and Hygiene, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois.

An amazing change has taken place in a few of our larger industries-all of these, it should be noted, with roots deep in the physical sciences. These companies are spending, ac- cording to Berland (1) and Fisher (6), 15%. or more of their research budget upon "blue sky" and "green grass" investigations. The investment has paid off. Berland states that careful study has shown that the returns on this money invested have been 100% to 200-%. Major differences are revealed from a study of the advertising of 30 to 40 of these major companies as compared with that of industries resting on bases connected with bi- ology. Figures 1, 2, and 3 are composites of a few of these ads. Letters from these com- panies revealed that they are planning a still greater emphasis upon basic research in the future. Over and over again the theme is sounded: "Creativity," "Fundamental Research," "Im- agination," "Scientist wanted to wvork on problems of their own choice," "Freedom to explore," "Thought," "Abstract Thinking," "Basic research is the reservoir for all ad- vances." That these are not mere slogans is evidenced by the "cash on the barrel-head" philosophy back of these ads. These leaders are convinced that basic research pays. NOTHING OF THIS MAGNITUDE HAS YET OCCURRED IN THE BIO- LOGICAL SCIENCES. One will search in vain for this kind and amount of support by companies forming the biological counterparts of these industries. Osmosis has not yet taken place. One need only go to the great pharma- ceutical houses, stock breeder's associations, gigantic food producing and processing indus- tries, and agricultural complexes and ask for similar support for basic research. Instead, quite understandably, one finds advertising and attitudes which deal with the narrow and specific cures or ecomonic gains from the use of a certain product. Fundamental research is for someone else! One must talk to many representatives of both types of industries to realize how completely different are the attitudes of these two sets of leaders in our western economy. References from many sources could be cited in support of this thesis. Wright (16) has pointed out that our nearly complete dependence upon Europe for advances in basic medical science. The original theoretical work on the anti- biotics, all of the major pesticides, and the chemotherapeutic agents for control of para- sites came from Europe. Dr. T. Keith Glen- nan's (8) remarks concerning Space Age sci- ence in general is even more pertinent to medicine and biology: "We in America are prone to boast about our technical knowledge. I have long felt that we may have achieved this excellence at the expense of basic research. But I think the Space Age-young as it is-has already gone far toward correcting this situation. If we are to survive technologically and spiritually, we must constantly refill the reservoir of knowl- edge by respecting and supporting basic re- search." Both in the east (where Lysenkoism is not yet dead) and in the west we start the space age attack on problems of disease and health in a piece-meal fashion. Which of the major sciences are dealing with these problems? Both human and veterinary medicine are concerned with problems of space medicine. Since animals have led the way into space and in all aspects of future research will play a big part, it is only natural that veterinary medicine is rapidly becoming an indispensable part of the space program. Just as human medicine interprets findings in relation to man, so veterinary medicine is required to inter- pret adequately the physical reactions of ani- mals. These problems directly connected with our space probes are listed by Campbell and Roos (3) under seven headings: 1. General ("Man in Space," "Space Medi- cine," "Men, Rockets, Space Rats") 2. Sealed Cabin Problems 3. Acceleration/Deceleration 4. Fractional and Zero Gravitation 5. Cosmic Radiation 6. Survival Problems 7. Psychological and Social Problems Even though the physical sciences have taken the lead, the biology teachers should not let problems of space remain in the physics class. These problems are meaningful only in relation to living things. All of our science and technology is brought to bear upon the possibility of putting man and his living allies out into space.</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 22, No. 4 THE BIOLOGY TEACHER 215 &gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~X- list I i - ofdi4vihtlon and rultarc ia rhpnhta ofen grs - otW" oo; 'ot t tt o 3 statoity. ekirises, fromt throodo 4 "o-1-" 'tess o es.'s rtro. o the mbatamk wwm to the emnsim. totor tootooto Wttrs cr4 in soltasy tistiti 's am cttootty.

The public mind, already convinced that basic research is for the crackpot, has relegated biology to th-e study of such trivia as worms and butterflies. Most biology teachers will admit that many students find the subject not only trivial but boring as well. The biology teacher who enlarges his vision to include natural relationships of health and disease in the space age will find a tremendous source of vitality and strength. These are obviously not trivia. They cannot be boring to the sensitive and responsible citizen. Too often biology has been taught in a way which is unrelated to the challenges, hopes and fears of mankind. As an example of the relationship of classroom biology to space medicine we will explore only one problem of this new field. Perhaps the major phenomenon which will affect all men in the space age ahead is that of "crowding." Whether in the cockpit of a high altitude plane, a space ship, a colony on the moon, or a nation with a high reproductive rate the lack of suitable space will be a com- mon problem. Even in the absence of parasites and infectious microbes, crowding can cause disease. We are somewhat aware of problems of pollution and starvation following over- population. We may also be aware that all species must have peculiar specific environ- mental requirements, such as that of the giant condor for trees struck by lightning upon a cliff (to enable an unimpeded soaring take- off) and a safe place to digest his prey (so that he can become light enough to become airborne after eating). Recently, it has been shown that unlimited crowding can cause disease, even in animals which are used to close quarters. Christian (4) found that in mice and Norway rats adaptive endocrine changes took place where crowding alone was the causative factor. Even though excess food, water, nesting sites, and all other known requirements were furnished, birth rates and infant survival declined with an in- crease in population. Enlargement of the adrenal cortex and a decrease in the size and function of the gonads took place. There was failure of lactation with decreasing size of offspring. Natural population explosions continue to take place, such as the enormous increase in voles which took place in California and Oregon in 1957. As many as 8000 to the acre were counted. Pasture, crops, and bales of hay in the field were eaten by the rodents. We are all aware of the fire ant. In the Middle West we are now learning about the soybean cyst nematode. Birds, machinery, and man can serve as carriers. Cost of decontamination is around $100.00 an acre-prohibitive to the private individual. It can be terminated only by going out of bean or legume farming for several years. The steady progress of oak wilt disease and the Dutch elm disease reveals our basic inability to cope with biological forces. Our vaunted chemical controls often leave us worse off than when we started. But there are more forces of disease than the serious ones associated with crowding together of one or more species. The voles of Oregon spread tularemia; wells were contam- inated, and the disease spread to predators. Crowding has always been associated with parasitism and infection. We are used to think- ing only of the crowding of a single species. But man wvill continue to share his environ- ment with animals, friends and foes. Eaclh 25,000 increase in population requires a vet- erinarian to care for the pets with whom we associate. And there are with us still the pi- geons, starlings, mice, rats, and mosquitoes. No matter how man changes the face of the earth the forces of evolution will continue. He must take cognizance of them or face some unpleasant surprises. It is not impossible to have a pleasant environment with abundant wildlife. The amazing comeback of the deer (5) in much of America has shown that natural selection is a powerful force. Man is also anthropomorphic in his ideas about disease. Infectious disease is a parasitic phenomenon, whether the parasite is a tick, a worm, a bacterium, or a virus (2). These agents have no respect for man's superior social status. The zoonoses, as the diseases transmissible between man and animals are known, are many and caused by varied or- ganisms. More than 100 are known with over 40 being found in Illinois. These agents move by many and devious routes from one species to another. Rabies is carried by bats, foxes, skunks, and opossum as well as our familiar cat and dog. Trichinae may be found in nearly all</page><page sequence="5">.1 to'dtIdani 'iat4i o ie --. ti&lt; pt t X- 0 1 4italenftngfiie kOf .- .

Human tu- berculosis and brucellosis of bovine origin, by a great veterinary medical campaign, have nearly been eliminated. With a let-up on the part of the veterinary medical profession there could be an upsurge of these diseases. The zoonoses do not have a one way pattern. The great influenza pandemic of 1917 intro- duced the virus to our swine, and there it has remained in the form of one or more mutants where it yearly causes great losses. Even our well-scrubbed city neighborhoods cannot es- cape the zoonoses. Roueche (10) records in humorous veini the true story of the rickettsial pox epidemic which frightened an upper mid- dle class section of New York City in 1946. An alert amateur biologist suggested that mice and their mites carried the disease and helped public health authorities carry out the investi- gation which cleared up the mystery. The biology teacher needs to become a more active member of the team safeguarding health in the space age. Too often animals are studied as specimens in the biology class, pre- served, lifeless, with hardly a thought of dis- ease entering the discussion through many observations and dissections. Yet the condition of health is a dynamic balance with potential or active disease always present. The teacher needs to become better ac- quainted with the specialists of his profession, the plant pathologist, the physiologist, the bacteriologist, the medical, and veterinary medical doctor. Since the biologist works so much with animals, he will find that the latter is a natural ally and companion. The biologist conducting experiments or doing graduate re- search will find that the counsel of the veter- inarian is invaluable regarding the status of his controls and experimental animals. The care of laboratory animals has become a specialty of the profession; most large hospitals and research institutions now employ full time veterinarians to supervise the laboratory stock. Another specialty of the veterinary profession is gnotobiotics (9), or the science of "germ- free" animals. Institutions are springing up all over the country where animals are derived by Caesarean birth and hand-fed in a pa- thogen-free environment. The biologist will find it necessary to keep abreast of this work and may like to try his own hand at it. Many biologists are finding adventure as members of epidemiological teams. Research on equine viral encephalitis, vesicular stoma- titis, and other diseases has been done by bi- ology teachers,- sometimes during the summer months. Members of such a team with skills in entomology, herpetology, and mammalogy have aided in isolating zoonotic viruses from insects and other wild animals. While the biology instructor will un- doubtedly gain much from his association with the specialists of his field, this is a two wav street, and he has also much to give. The bi- ological point of view is much needed in medicine today and will be ever more so to- morrow. He has the opportunity to be the statesman of science. In spite of our gadgetry and love of chromium, Americans are not a scientifically minded people. Historians con- sider that we are much more like the practical minded Romans than the ancient Greeks. We have misread much of our history. Although Edison did far more basic research than we realize, he represents the- American ideal of the practical inventor more than the truth-seeker and scientist. Few have realized how near America, like France, came to failure at the Panama Canal because, from President Roose- velt down, our leaders, political, business, and medical did not believe that mosquitoes car- ried yellow fever and malaria! The previous success of Gorgas in Cuba was looked upon by the intelligentsia of the period as an ex- ample of the success of American cleanliness over filth. Without military authority in Panama, Gorgas had a difficult time over- coming prejudices and concepts of his business supervisors which did not fit the new era. The biologist stands between the physical and social sciences. More high school and college students take biology than any other science, and even with the newly aroused interest in mathematics and physics, this is likely to continue. If we are to face up to the needs of the space age in competition with the scientifically oriented peoples of other nations (7), biologists must do a more dv- namic job of teaching than they have done in the past. Surveys made during the past ten years show that even such a fundamental concept as evolution is satisfactorily taught in less than a third of our schools, while the biology classes of over a third hardly mention it.

The first event might well be the synthesis of self-replicating proteins in the test tube (creation of life). If evolution has been a stumbling block to our theology, think what the creation of life will do! The picture of Faust, the scientist in league with the devil, the mad scientist of space fiction, is very firmly planted in the minds of millions. lVhen I suggested to a class that I had never known a scientist like this, a student came back with a note from his mother suggesting that I read a book called "Frankenstein" for the facts! That this was fiction did not enter the minds of this class, nor could they easily be dis- suaded. We have a big job of educating ahead of us. A second big event will be the exploration of our outer space itself. Here a tremendous question awaits the biologist: life in outer space! Whether there is life or not, the biolo- gist will be in the spotlight. If life exists in outer space there will be decades ahead of classification and comparative biology with attendant light being undoubtedly thrown upon our own origin and upon philosophical and theological matters. If there is no life found there will be repercussions, too. Perhaps men will look again at Schweitzer's principle of "Reverence for Life." Another byproduct of space research, which will make even the most abstract research of day-to-day impor- tance is the solution of our "lebensraum" prob- lem. As Vogt (14) stated, even the biologist becomes concerned with the potential of life to out-grow its environment. Scientists have become cynical over the prospect of medical advances causing even greater disasters. Space research gives us the rationale for unlimited advances, even as the discovery of the New World revitalized Europe. It is hard to be- lieve that there will not be more real estate in the vast universe. Even if power becomes available which will make interplanetary travel possible, it is hard to conceive that many of us will be making use of it. "Adscriptus glebae" (bound to the soil) may well describe most of us. But for those left on earth there will be tremendous hope. If science can make colonizing of the moon or Mars possible, how easy it will be to make any portion of this old pear shaped earth-be it desert, or tropic, or polar region-"blossom as the rose." What a great time to be a biologist. References 1. Berland, Theodore. "Blue-Sky Profits." li- dustrial Research, Summer, (1959):44-51. 2. Burnet, Sir Macfarlane.
