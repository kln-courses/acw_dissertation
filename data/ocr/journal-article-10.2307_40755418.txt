<plain_text><page sequence="1">"I wou'd be a Man-Woman": Roxana's Amazonian Threat to the Ideology of Marriage Shawn Lisa Maurer Emerging in recent decades from under the shadow of its more popular siblings, Daniel Defoe's final novel, Roxana (1724), has enjoyed a notice- able rise in critical fortune, despite the tragic misfortune of its eponymous heroine. Finding in the story of a woman's meteoric ascent from destitu- tion to prosperity both the psychological depth and narrative complexity missing from Defoe's earlier masterpieces, Robinson Crusoe (1719) and Moll Flanders (1722), scholars have brought to bear on the novel a wide range of theoretical paradigms and historical contexts, deeply enriching our sense of Defoe's artistry by illuminating his multifaceted understand- ing of, and engagement with, the economic, social, political, and religious concerns of the early eighteenth century. Yet, in many studies of the novel, a heightened appreciation of the novel's complexity has often rendered an accompanying sense of uneasiness or confusion about its meaning, particularly with regard to the unhappy, and extremely abrupt, ending - a conclusion readers have interpreted in diverse and often mutually exclusive ways. Yet, whether viewing the novel's denouement as, among other possibilities, incomplete, retributive, or simply a return to an earlier misogynist tradition,1 critics agree that Roxana's downfall has everything to do with her engagement in relations of commerce, broadly defined as accumulation, investment, and the social relations that surround these economic transactions.2 To unravel those relations in their myriad of social and economic in- tricacies is to uncover at the novel's core Defoe's profound ambivalence towards his heroine, an ambivalence which derives, at least in part, from the tensions between, on the one hand, his sense of the need for women's subordinate and devalued economic role in the emerging middle-class enterprise and, on the other hand, his reluctant, perhaps even repressed awareness of the severe constraints and injustices of that role.

Box 7819, Austin, TX 78713-7819</page><page sequence="2">364 Shawn Lisa Maurer successful female protagonist, Moll Flanders, engages in a wide range of financial activity, both criminal and legitimate, and Defoe's Complete English Tradesman, published two years after his final novel, expressly ad- vocates the involvement of women in their husbands7 businesses.3 What distinguishes Roxana from these other women is not, then, economic ac- tivity as such, but the ability to detach such activity from a domestic or marital context. Moll, by contrast, can combine economic prosperity with moral tranquility because her material stability functions in the context of the family unit comprised of husband and son.4 Roxana^ however, purchases and sustains her affluence at the cost of a categorical denial of wife- and motherhood. Unlike Michael Boardman, who sees Roxana's sin as "clearly a feminine transgression" stemming exclusively from sexual passion (52), I contend that her greatest (yet also related) transgression is her desire for an economic existence independent of men, whether they be fools, such as her brewer husband, or exemplars like the Dutch mer- chant. By attacking marriage as a form of servitude and failing to marry in order to make an "honest woman" of herself, Roxana both challenges and ominously threatens a developing order based on women's supposedly inherent difference from men, a difference embodied "naturally" in both their sexual vulnerability and financial dependence. 5 By shunning the male control of her money mandated within marriage, Roxana calls into question not only the broad contours of patriarchal control over women embodied in what Carole Pateman has termed the "sexual contract,"6 but also the more specific model of middle-class marriage, in which men's position as exclusive breadwinner increasingly limited women's productive economic role. Roxana, like its feisty and eponymous protago- nist, is vexed by the failure of a system, namely marriage, which is ostensibly designed to safeguard, rather than destroy, the interests of women and children. Yet, the investment of both Defoe and the emerging novel genre in a gender division of labor that militated women's placement into a domes- tic sphere increasingly separated from the workplace means that such insolvency of the system itself cannot be acknowledged. Instead, the failure must be extirpated through the destruction of the very woman who attempts to function outside its boundaries. Operating as both a symptom of, and a solution for, the economic tensions at the heart of Defoe's novel stands the figure of the Amazon.7 As Laura Brown has noted, "women are not always or even often seen as Amazons, but Amazons haunt the frontiers of the representation of women at various levels and in various modes of discourse" {Ends of Empire, 144). 8 By naming Roxana an Amazon, Defoe projects onto his heroine both his own and the culture's fears about female independence from men. Like the mythic Amazons, whose martial prowess, economic self-sufficiency, and non-monagamous, matrilineal sexuality (they kept</page><page sequence="3">Roxana's Threat to the Ideology of Marriage 365 only the girl children and killed, maimed, or rejected the boy babies) threatened Athenian patriarchy, Roxana's refusal to remain within the sphere of "proper" - which is to say chaste and dependent - sexual and economic behavior poses a similar threat to emerging eighteenth-century beliefs about women's proscribed domestic role. It is crucial to recognize, however, that Roxana's Amazonian status emerges neither from her role as mistress nor from her position as "She- Merchant"; it arises, instead, out of her refusal to marry. After having several times rejected a marriage proposal from the "honest" Dutch mer- chant by whom she is pregnant, Roxana subsequently rebuffs the offer of her financial advisor, the historical figure Sir Robert Clayton, to find her "some eminent Merchant" who, already possessing a "flourishing Busi- ness, and a flowing Cash," would not need her money, but would settle it all on herself and her children, while enabling her to live "like a Queen" (211). Bent upon adding to her assets by becoming a "kept Mistress" (210), Roxana then restates her earlier points with even greater vehemence: "that I knew no Reason the Men had to engross the whole Liberty of the Race, and make the Women, notwithstanding any desparity of Fortune, be subject to the Laws of Marriage, of their own making; that it was my Misfortune to be a Woman, but I was resolv'd it shou'd not be made worse by the Sex; and seeing Liberty seem'd to be the Men's Property, I wou'd be a Man-Woman; for as I was born free, I wou'd die so" (211-12).9 Roxana's radical terminology does not fluster the phlegmatic Sir Robert who, unlike the Dutch merchant, has no real investment in her capitulation to the conjugal norm: Sir Robert "smil'd, and told me, I talked a kind of Amazonian Language; that he found few Women of my Mind, or that if they were, they wanted Resolution to go on with it" (212; original italics). While the Penguin editor, David Blewett, interprets Sir Robert's phrase as meaning "aggressively feminist (from the legendary race of female warriors),"10 1 contend that Roxana's association with the mythic Amazons can take us even further in understanding the complex gender negotiations at work in Defoe's novel. Indeed the term itself pro- vides a gloss on one of the Dutch merchant's earlier comments to Roxana, after he finds out that she has become pregnant from their affair. Repeat- ing and adding to his earlier statement - "But I have been surpriz'd with such a Denial, that no Woman in such Circumstances ever gave to a Man; for certainly it was never known, that any Woman refus'd to marry a Man that had first lain with her, much less a Man that had gotten her with- Child" - he adds his harshest remark: "yet I must own, there is something in it shocking to Nature, and something very unkind to yourself; but above all, it is unkind to the Child that is yet unborn; who, if we marry, will come into the World with Advantage enough, but if not, is ruin'd before it is born" (196).</page><page sequence="4">366 Shawn Lisa Maurer As a "Man- Woman" Roxana is neither male nor female, but is herself "something . . . shocking to Nature" - monstrous, indeed inhuman. Like the ancient Amazons, who are often represented as geographically elu- sive, living at the margins of the known world, Roxana too exists on the edge, yet at a sociological, rather than geographical, extreme. Moreover, just as the Amazons use men solely for reproductive purposes, Roxana controls and exploits her own sexual attractiveness. Employing her body to gain wealth while eschewing marriage, Roxana threatens not only be- cause she desires to accumulate capital, but also, and more dangerously, because of the independence such accumulation allows. By obviating the need for marriage, she challenges the foundation of male control and ownership of women's property - understood as both her body and her money; in addition, she breaks the chain of patrilineal succession by fail- ing to legitimize the offspring of her sexual encounters. In her refusal to join the "civilized" state that would both restrict her sexuality to one man and grant that man control of her considerable economic assets, as well as of her children, Roxana perfectly fits William Blake Tyrrell's description of the ancient Greek Amazons as "beautiful women who arouse men sexually," yet whose "erotic appeal cannot be civilized in marriage, its proper sphere, and so is loose, socially unproductive, and dangerous" (66). Thus Tyrrell reads the Amazon myth as providing an ideological resolution to the conflicts inherent within Athenian marriage: "The Amazon myth explains why it is necessary for the daughter to marry by creating a scenario of the dangers inherent in her not marrying" (xiv). Defoe's creation of the mythic Man- Woman Roxana performs, I wish to suggest, a similar ideological function. By aligning his protagonist with those powerful and independent Amazons who encroach - physically, sexually, politically - upon realms designated male, Defoe establishes the very parameters of those realms; moreover, by depicting Roxana as an example of monstrous, unnatural, and at times dangerous womanhood, he also establishes the need for, and the seeming justice of, male control. Unlike Moll Flanders, Roxana never succeeds in recreating a secure do- mestic economy, one in which financial and familial interests can harmoniously coexist. Serving instead as "a Memorial to all that shall read my Story" (201), Roxana represents the dissolution of familial, and hence - given the times - patriarchal stability, her narrative a black hole which sucks into itself the possibility for any happy ending. "Not Bred to Work": Domestic Economy, Economic Passivity To understand the ways in which Roxana construes an empowered femi- ninity as inimical to an emerging capitalist enterprise entails not only taking account of the financial dealings so exactingly detailed by Defoe,</page><page sequence="5">Roxana's Threat to the Ideology of Marriage 367 but also attending to the very circumstances that make those dealings possible in the first place - the vertiginous fall that precipitates Roxana's equally precipitous rise. The dual life that Roxana herself divides neatly into the categories of "Wife" and "Whore" (171) operates, I contend, less as a series of discrete sequential tales11 than as two sides of the same, often debased, coin. While Roxana is certainly, as Laura Brown contends, "perhaps the period's most famous whore" ("Feminization of Ideology," 230),12 she is also - as we shall see - a dutiful daughter and wife. Thus, although critical attention to Roxana's economic activity usually begins only after she has been deserted by her husband and has herself aban- doned, in turn, her own children, we need to push against the separation of the domestic and economic to integrate Roxana's life as a mistress and "She-Merchant" with her previous existence as wife and mother.13 For despite her powerful arguments for female liberty, Roxana does not begin the novel as a fierce and independent woman. Like the women in several seventeenth-century dramas, who inhabit all-female communities through storm and accident,14 Roxana is an Amazon made rather than born. Not an inherent or inherited disposition but rather the harrowing events of her early life - a bad marriage, with subsequent bankruptcy and desertion - have propelled her, as John Richetti has aptly noted, "into a narrative opportunity as unencumbered as Crusoe's island" (33). Yet Roxana's own shipwreck, unlike that of her predecessors in the drama, cannot be recuper- ated by the reappearance of men and the resuscitation of conjugal ties. For Roxana, those bonds constitute the problem rather than the solution. In laying the foundation for Roxana's later turn to Amazonian inde- pendence, Defoe's depiction of his protagonist's early life - her family background, education, and youthful marriage - performs a twofold, and at times contradictory, function: it describes a gender division of labor while simultaneously revealing its severe shortcomings. As a woman "not bred to Work" (48), Roxana, I propose, begins the novel as a female model of "middle-class gentility": daughter of a successful Huguenot business- man, sister to a merchant, she spends her youth "in very good Circumstances," preparing herself "for the sociable Part of the World" through accomplishments in dancing and singing (38); indeed she is drawn to her husband, "an Eminent Brewer in the City" with whom she lives "eight Years in good Fashion" (39), not for his business acumen but for his fine figure and excellent dancing. Roxana's status as a woman of leisure, both before and during her marriage, exemplifies a broader economic trend that had powerful repercussions for the newly affluent middle classes: In the sixteenth century, when women had been involved in produc- tion for the subsistence of their households and for market, they had participated in a range of economically significant functions. The next</page><page sequence="6">368 Shawn Lisa Maurer hundred and fifty years saw the breakdown of domestic economy, as lands were enclosed, estates consolidated, and work that had tradi- tionally been performed at home was removed from domestic space and professionalized within a public sphere to which women were barred entry. The family ceased then to be the primary unit of pro- duction, and the interdependency of its members was replaced by a division of labor structured along gender lines. (Moglen, 2) This radical shift had particularly striking implications for middle-class women. As opposed to their male counterparts, who "moved into an ex- panding public world - as political citizens, legal subjects, and aspiring economic individuals," women "were restricted to a diminished private sphere in which they performed their duties as mothers and as wives" (Moglen, 2). Although couched in an increasingly elaborate rhetoric of complementarity and mutual support, a rhetoric I will explore in greater detail below, this gender division of labor functioned to institutionalize and, in the process, to eroticize feminine dependence, leaving women, and par- ticularly married women, potentially more vulnerable than ever before.15 Roxana's optimistic portrayal of herself as wanting, at the age of fourteen, "neither Wit, Beauty, or Money" anticipates by almost a hun- dred years Jane Austen's famous description of the "handsome, clever, and rich" Emma Woodhouse. And yet, while Roxana possesses, like Emma after her, "all the Advantages that any Young Woman cou'd de- sire, to recommend me to others, and form a Prospect of happy Living to myself" (39), an unfortunate choice of husband quickly dashes her auspicious entrance into the world. As I will argue, Roxana's bad mar- riage testifies not only to the personal shortcomings - and financial failure - of her "fool Husband," but also to the defects within the insti- tution of marriage itself, particularly in its middle-class instantiation of gender ideologies.16 By replacing a notion of partnership, in which men and women did different, but equally necessary productive tasks, with one of complementarity, in which women's role in the home was viewed as quali- tatively different from what men did in the workplace, eighteenth-century ideologies of domestic femininity effectively removed economics from the home. At the same time, women's financial dependence served to intensify, rather than negate, traditional ideas about female subservience. According to the historian Amy Louise Erickson, a "pre-existing hierarchical concep- tion of women's and men's work was undoubtedly exacerbated when men's work was separated from the home by long-term development of a cash economy. In the context of a wage economy, the early modern conception of male headship of the family easily slips into the idea that a man supports his wife and children economically" (xx-xxi).</page><page sequence="7">Roxana's Threat to the Ideology of Marriage 369 Despite her obvious intelligence, Roxana is patently unable to affect the course of her husband's financial ruin; her pathetic powerlessness tes- tifies to the failures of patriarchal marriage on a number of related levels that include her father and brother as well as her irresponsible husband. Initially a dutiful daughter, Roxana acquiesces, at the age of "about Fifteen/' to marriage: "my Father gave me, as he called it in French, 25000 Livres, that is to say, two Thousand Pounds Portion, and married me to an Eminent Brewer in the City" (39). The sentence's passive language - "gave me," "married me" - which seems initially to contradict Roxana's assessment of her own vivacity and boldness, also obscures what we are soon to find is Roxana's sexual attraction to him: "He was a jolly, hand- some Fellow, as any Woman need wish for a Companion; tall and well-made; ... he danc'd well, which, I think, was the first thing that brought us together" (39). This, one of Roxana's few expressions of sexual desire, leads, of course, to misery, when both Roxana and her father dis- cover that she has married a "Fool." Roxana's somewhat disjointed narrative, which takes significant lib- erties with chronology, blurs the lines of responsibility between the heroine herself and her father, leaving us once again unsure as to the father's part in Roxana's marriage choice. Roxana subsequently tells us that her father "lik'd my Match so ill, and saw so little Room to be satis- fied with the Conduct of my Husband" that he leaves money not to Roxana herself, since that money would then become the possession of her profligate husband, but to her "Elder Brother" (41). Again we cannot be certain whether the father disapproved of the relationship from its in- ception, which the term "Match" would seem to imply, or if he has only become critical of the husband since marriage. Whichever way we read the circumstances, however, the ambiguity itself testifies to a weakness in the patriarchal order: Roxana's father must bear at least some responsibil- ity for her subsequent misery in that he either chose, or allowed his fifteen-year-old daughter to choose, a man lacking the requisite business sense adequately to support a wife and children. Similarly, Roxana's mer- chant brother, who is appointed by her father to manage the assets that cannot be entrusted to her husband, himself "fail'd, and lost not only what he had, but what he had for me too" (42). "[RJunning on too rashly in his Adventures" (41-42), this brother is the comparably problematic counterpart of Roxana's indolent husband, who spends his time in idle- ness and leisured pursuits rather than in minding the family business.17 Although Roxana makes several significant attempts to intervene in what she rightly foresees to be her husband's impending economic col- lapse, her concerns are angrily rebuffed or peremptorily denied. Critics have noted the way Defoe's Complete English Tradesman chastises those wives who, emulating the upper classes, disdain any knowledge of, or</page><page sequence="8">370 Shawn Lisa Maurer active participation in, their husband's business;18 yet none, to my knowl- edge, has noted the ways in which the brewer himself exemplifies the husband who rejects the involvement of his wife. In addition to main- taining Roxana in leisured refinement, a station clearly supported by Roxana's own genteel education, the brewer illustrates two additional negative types: "Those who are unkind, haughty, and imperious, who will not trust their wives, because they will not make them useful, that they may not value themselves upon it, and make themselves, as it were, equal to their husbands" and "those who are afraid their wives should be let into the grand secret of all - namely, to know that they are bankrupt, and undone, and worth nothing" (Defoe, Complete English Tradesman, 205). While clearly exacerbated by stupidity and indolence, the brewer's misguided sense of superiority - and concomitant bankruptcy - is none- theless sanctioned by conjugal law. Accurate as they may be, Roxana's remonstrances can do no good. As the family's nominal head and ulti- mate arbiter, the husband possesses a formal authority that repels the wife's use of both reason and emotion. Neither "Perswasions and Entreat- ies" nor "Tears and Lamentations" can affect his behavior, for "like one stupid," he continues to spend the money he has realized upon selling the failing business, until "he had not a Hundred Pound left in the whole World" (43).19 Although left paralyzed by her husband's desertion and the ensuing destitution, Roxana's behavior up to that point has been anything but passive. While the brewer himself, as Michael Shinagel has noted, might provide readers with a useful model for how not to conduct a business (179-80), Roxana, in turn, exemplifies the care, concern, and forethought that Defoe perceives as essential to commercial success. Not only do Roxana's astute assessments confirm Defoe's belief that women "are not so helpless and shiftless creatures as some would make them appear," capable, as widows or wives of broken and ruined tradesmen, of "recover[ing] themselves and their shattered families" (Defoe, Complete English Tradesman, 211), but we are also led to believe that had she, rather than her husband, held the financial reins, the family business would have prospered rather than foundered. For the first years of their marriage, that enterprise is effectively run by the brewer's "old Father, who manag'd the Business carefully" so that the son "had little of that Part lay on him" (39). Rather than learning the trade, her husband indulges in social and leisure pursuits: "went Abroad, kept Company, hunted much, and lov'd it exceedingly" (40). As Helen Burke has shown, this competent elder generation is then succeeded by a more rash and less proficient one: Roxana's father, as we have seen, leaves her inherit- ance to the merchant brother who goes bankrupt and lands in prison; Roxana's husband, upon inheriting "the whole Trade of the Brewhouse,</page><page sequence="9">Roxana's Threat to the Ideology of Marriage 371 which was a very good one/' can only "put on a Face of Business" (42), living from day to day and leaving the management to others. In contrast to her husband, who remains "perfectly easie and indo- lent" as long as the cash flow continues, Roxana "foresaw the Consequence of this, and attempted several times to perswade him to apply himself to his Business" (42), but to no avail. While the brewer lives solely in the present, only growing sufficiently "allarm'd" once he lacks sufficient money to "carry on his Business," Roxana thinks continually about the future, "foreseeing" not only the brewery's imminent failure, but the greater devastation that will befall them should it fall into bankruptcy: "I was willing he should draw out while he had something left, lest I should come to be stript at Home, and be turn'd out of Doors with my Children" (42^3). Yet even the profit they are able to realize - "between Two and Three Thousand Pound" - cannot sustain them. Rather than listening to Roxana, who "propos'd to him either to buy some Place with the Money, or with Part of it, ... so we might have liv'd tollerably, at least, during his Life," he continues to live lavishly on the remaining capital, leaving Roxana once again helplessly concerned about the future: "I thought I saw my Ruin hastening on, without any possible Way to prevent it" (43). While her prophecy comes all too true, her situation testifies as much to the failings within the gender division of labor, and the institution of marriage that supports it, as it does to those of her "fool Husband," extreme as they may be. That is, had Roxana been empowered, culturally as well as legally and economically, to take full part in her husband's en- terprise, had she been a partner rather than a wife, she could have countered the excesses and flaws of her husband. Once freed from the bad management of a bad husband, Roxana displays a wide range of abili- ties - among them the capacity to work hard, to plan ahead, to take risks, to admit counsel, and to be frugal - that would have enabled her substan- tially to assist, or even to run, her husband's brewery. Defoe's latent, but nonetheless clearly articulated point about the devastating consequences - for men, as well as for women and children - of women's exclusion from productive labor is underscored by the very business Defoe has chosen - consciously or unconsciously - for Roxana's unfortunate husband.20 As Alice Clark has shown, brewing was one of the trades previously dominated by women that had been turned over to men in the course of the later seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. In the early seventeenth century, Clark notes, "the position which women occupied among butchers and bakers did not differ materially from their position in other trades; that is to say, the wife generally helped her hus- band in his business, and carried it on after his death; but the history of brewing possesses a peculiar interest, for apparently the art of brewing was at one time chiefly, if not entirely, in the hands of women" (221).</page><page sequence="10">372 Shawn Lisa Maurer In the 1620s and 1630s, however, the trade became monopolized in large- scale production by men, a process encouraged by a government desirous of taxing the ale and beer central to daily consumption. For Clark, a chief exponent of the view that "capitalist industry seriously eroded women's status, which had been higher in the pre-capitalist and pre-industrial past/' brewing provides the "best example of a trade in which capitaliza- tion specifically displaced women" (Erickson vii-viii, xxxi). Like the seventeenth-century "brewsters," Roxana too has been dis- placed. Shut out, through a gender division of labor, from any effective participation in the so-called family business, she is left, upon her husband's desertion, to shift for herself in the very realm - that of home and family - mandated as her proper place. Yet in describing what she terms her "inexpressible Distress" (49), Roxana presents a domestic sphere almost parodically emptied of its household goods: furniture, plate, clothing, food, and eventually, even her own children: "they saw me in Rags and Dirt, who was but a little before riding in my Coach; thin, and looking almost like one Starv'd, who was before fat and beautiful: The House, that was before handsomely furnish'd with Pictures and Ornaments, Cabinets, Peir-Glasses, and every thing suitable, was now stripp'd, and naked, most of the goods having been seiz'd by the Land- lord for Rent, or sold to buy Necessaries" (50). 21 This tableau of domestic devastation, which haunts Roxana for the remainder of the novel,22 sym- bolizes more than just her husband's inadequacy as provider. Although the house itself is eventually restored to its former flourishing state - and not only does the landlord return the goods he had seized, but he also offers himself as replacement for Roxana's absent husband - Roxana's ability to experience, indeed even to desire, domestic security is forever lost. In her transformation from obedient wife to independent "Man- Woman," a sexual and economic "Amazonian," Roxana bursts the membrane of illusion and oppression that covered and protected the ide- ology of marriage in the early eighteenth century. "The Laws of Matrimony": Sexual Subversions of the Marriage Contract Given a father who hands her over to an incompetent husband, a hus- band who runs his business into the ground and then deserts her, and a brother who loses her inheritance, Roxana has been failed mightily - on at least three levels - by a patriarchal system supposedly designed to safeguard both herself and her children. Thus she experiences first hand the structural instability and the ideological power (a power that func- tions, at least in part, to veil such instability) of the institution of marriage. As she later tells the Dutch merchant, "It is not you ... I suspect, but the Laws of Matrimony [that] puts the Power into your Hands; bids you do it,</page><page sequence="11">Roxana's Threat to the Ideology of Marriage 373 commands you to command; and binds me, forsooth, to obey" (190). These laws, which grant men control over women's behavior as well as their pocketbooks, effectively negate any possibility of equality: "you that are now upon even Terms with me, and I with you, says I, are the next Hour set up upon the Throne, and the humble Wife plac'd at your Foot- stool" (190). By codifying men's power over women - on religious, social, political, as well as economic levels - marriage renders men's decent treatment of women nothing more than a form of noblesse oblige, a conde- scension which, by easing rather than actually removing the yoke of patriarchy, only solidifies the imbalance at its core: "all the rest, that you call Oneness of Interest, Mutual Affection, and the like, is Curtesie and Kindness then, and a Woman is indeed, infinitely oblig'd where she meets with it; but can't help herself where it fails" (190-91). While Defoe's sympathetic presentation of Roxana's early history, which forcefully reveals the unequivocal failure of the traditional patriar- chal and conjugal order, would seem clearly to explain and even to justify Roxana's subsequent desire for independence and control, the novel in- stead works powerfully and unremittingly against such acceptance. That is, the system, while clearly flawed, must at the same time be maintained - even at the cost of the heroine herself. Thus the danger posed by Roxana's desire for and - even more threatening - ability to sustain economic inde- pendence is so great that it must be thoroughly eradicated, a process facilitated in large part through Roxana's direct sexual association with the "unnatural" Amazon. Having discovered all too painfully the costs, both monetary and psychological, of the failure of the marriage contract, Roxana, encouraged by her faithful maidservant Amy, develops a new strategy for survival. (Here she is again distinguished from Moll Flanders who, after three problematic marriages and at the height of luxurious "Prosperity" with her "Gentleman," claims that she "wanted nothing but to be a Wife" [170]). In Roxana's liaison with the married landlord and her subsequent affairs, she, like the mythical Amazons, escapes from a domestic economy determined by men's control of women's wealth (the dowry or other assets she will bring to the marriage) and childbearing potential (the heirs she will produce). As a mistress, Roxana will receive money rather than dispense it; her children, because illegitimate, will not be part of the patri- lineal succession. Rather than making her own fortunes dependent on those of a (potentially) incompetent man, Roxana will herself become the "Fortu- nate Mistress," the securer of her own economic and emotional stability. To accomplish this transformation, she must first disencumber herself of her five children - products of her previous existence within a conjugal system. Freed of her offspring, Roxana can present herself, as she will</page><page sequence="12">374 Shawn Lisa Maurer later present her signature Turkish dress and dance, as "perfectly new" (216, 217). In this guise, Roxana functions not as an object of exchange between men, a link in the chain of patriarchy, but as an end in her own right. To do so, of course, Roxana must give up the chastity we are led to believe she had preserved both before and during her early marriage. As the necessary condition for such exchange, female chastity functioned as the sine qua non of the marriage contract, the supposed guarantee of the legitimacy of heirs. Roxana's extramarital sexuality, which many critics have rightly remarked seems to have little to do with sex, becomes prob- lematic then, not because of its financial component per se - after all, the exchange of women was often a financial transaction, whether money went to the father (bride price) or the husband (dowry) - but, crucially, because Roxana employs her sexuality for her own gain apart from, or outside of, the patriarchal system. As with the Amazon, who must be either tamed or destroyed, Roxana's prodigious ability to incite, sustain, and exploit male desire comes at a cost. Exchanging herself for money (rather than for marriage) in the name of ever-increasing capital accumulation, Roxana is more than simply the canny merchant that some critics have made her out to be, as if the trade in flesh were no different from that in other "luxury" goods. While to the reader, Roxana positions her arguments for "liberty" as nothing more than the desire to amass more money and preserve that which she already pos- sesses, such liberty - whatever its rationale - necessarily places her in a problematic relation to the period's social and cultural codes, in which women's dependence upon men functioned as a critical aspect of an emerg- ing ideology of bourgeois femininity. As a sexually active woman who seeks to control her own "fortune," in both senses of the word, and who refuses to be financially and emotionally dependent on men, Roxana radi- cally transgresses the boundaries of accepted, and acceptable, female behavior, and by extension, perilously threatens both economic and do- mestic order. Even as Roxana's successful adulteries subvert and parody her disastrous marriage, her ability to live and indeed prosper outside of patriarchal norms creates a powerful alternative narrative. Yet her very existence, like that of her mythic foremothers, incites male fear and con- comitant retribution, thereby reconfirming the strict code of gender and labor seemingly broken by her independent, and Amazonian, status. Roxana's affair with the landlord /jeweler transposes the reversal of fortune she had earlier experienced with her husband, as she moves from utter destitution to being "possess'd of almost ten Thousand Pounds Sterling" (90) soon after his traumatic death. If Roxana's legitimate, albeit luckless marriage foundered, as I have shown, upon the patriarchal myth of inherent male superiority, this relationship is shored up by two radically different fictions, both of which further call into question the very nature of</page><page sequence="13">Roxana's Threat to the Ideology of Marriage 375 the marriage contract itself. The first story, one which both the landlord and Amy seem able wholeheartedly to embrace, entails the belief that due to the absence or non-performance of their respective spouses, Roxana and the landlord have engaged in a legitimate marriage. Although Roxana, echoing Defoe's own position, takes a more conventional stance, recognizing that in both legal and religious terms she can be nothing more than a "Whore," once the jeweler is dead she herself authors the second tale by willingly assuming the role of his bereaved French widow. Tellingly, both fictions in- volve financial agreements: the landlord provides Roxana with a "Contract in Writing" wherein he stipulates both "an Obligation in the Penalty of 7000 1. never to abandon me" and "a Bond for 500 Z. to be paid to me, or to my Assigns, within three Months after his Death" (76); as his widow, Roxana claims a number of bills of exchange, "not above 12000 Livres," as Amende or compensation for the "30000 Livres" she alleges to have brought him as her marriage portion (91). In both these cases, a "pretended Marriage, &amp;c." (83) functions to ensure financial security for the pretended wife, Roxana. This inversion of Roxana's legitimate nuptial contract in which, as we recall, she brought her husband "25000 Livres [or] two Thousand Pounds Portion" (39) and was left, after his desertion, with only "about seventy Pound in Money" on which to sustain herself and five young children (45), exposes not only the failure of the marriage contract itself, but also its dark underside: the passivity and dependence which, while making women attractive to men, also makes them vulnerable to men's deficiencies. By knowingly prosti- tuting herself for economic security in a relationship conceived, at least by the landlord himself, as a legitimate marriage, Roxana highlights the precarious, as well as mercenary nature of an institution that seemingly exists for the security and protection, no less than for the "Mutual Affec- tion," of its participants. In fact, she readily acknowledges that she is prompted not by sexual desire itself - "I had nothing of the Vice in my Constitution" - but instead by obligation and fear: "the Kindness and good Humour of the Man, and the Dread of my own Circumstances concurr'd to bring me to the Point, and I even resolv'd, before he ask'd, to give up my Virtue to him, whenever he should put it to the Question" (75). Although the Dutch merchant, like the landlord/jeweler before him, rescues Roxana from desperate circumstances - indeed he too tells "fictions" in his endeavor to protect Roxana from the hateful and avari- cious Jew - his status as widower sets him significantly apart both from her first lover and from her second, even wealthier paramour, the foreign Prince. Despite their location at the periphery of Roxana's narrative, the conjugal histories of these latter two men supplement Roxana's own un- happy tale by providing further ironic comment on the fragility of the marriage bond. Initially, we know little of the landlord other than that he</page><page sequence="14">376 Shawn Lisa Maurer is married; refusing the temptations of interpolated narrative, Defoe has Roxana literally bracket his story, stating "that tho' he was under such Engagements that he cou'd not Marry me, [his Wife and he had been parted, for some Reasons, which make too long a Story to intermix with mine] yet that he wou'd be everything else that a Woman cou'd ask in a Husband" (67). It is left, then, to Amy to tell his tale, in the name of con- vincing Roxana that despite the fact that tl'ey "cannot bring the Laws of the Land to join" them together, Roxana and the landlord "may certainly take one another fairly" (71). In Amy's thinking as well as his own, what constitutes the landlord "a single Man again, as much as ever" is the fact that his legal spouse, "being gone from him, and refusing] to lye with him," has thereby "refus[ed] to do the Office of a Wife" (71). In this odd triangle (or possibly even rectangle, given Amy's own sexual involvement with the landlord), Roxana plays not the wicked mis- tress who expends money the husband should instead save for wife and offspring but, ironically, the good wife. Grateful, obliging, considerate, and of course sexually available, Roxana agrees to accompany the land- lord to Paris on a business trip, sets up residency there, and even bears him two children: a daughter, who dies in infancy, and a son, "a charming child, [who] did very well" (84). As the "marriage" contract between Roxana and the landlord burlesques a legitimate covenant, so too does the relationship itself, in all its mutual affection and obligation, mock the absence of such emotion within each partner's legitimate marriages, as both have been deserted - albeit in different ways - by their spouses.23 By contrast, Roxana's relationship with the Prince reverses this sce- nario. As she overtly acknowledges, their affair, while forestalling his attention to numerous (and possibly less scrupulous) other mistresses, also keeps him from the wife Roxana feelingly describes as "not only the best of Princesses, but even the best of Women" (145). Thus, while inverting the predicament of the landlord - here, and more conventionally, it is the husband who defaults on his conjugal duty - the situation nevertheless exposes a different chink in the eighteenth-century matrimonial armor. If the Princess, a paragon of virtue who possesses, along with high birth and significant fortune, "Beauty, Wit, and a thousand good Qualities, superiour not to most Women, but even to all her Sex" (145), cannot re- form her husband except through an early death, then what are less endowed women to hope for? Indeed the Princess functions here as a cari- cature of the patient and passive wife, whose good behavior, rather than criticism, supposedly turns a profligate rake into an "ideal husband."24 In her refusal to marry the "honest" Dutch merchant, Roxana makes explicit the critique of matrimony implicit within her own failed marriage as well as within those of the landlord and Prince. Stated baldly, Roxana refuses marriage because she does not want to give up control of her</page><page sequence="15">Roxana's Threat to the Ideology of Marriage 377 extensive economic resources/Although the merchant seeks to allay her objection by generously offering not to " touch one Pistole of your Estate" except with her consent, allowing her instead to settle her money in any way she chooses, Roxana cannot accept his proposal, calling her financial desires "too gross for me to acknowledge" (186). As a related, albeit sec- ondary concern, she worries that her holding on to her money would place the marriage on a "Foundation of Unkindness," rendering both her- self and the merchant "suspected one to another" (187). Here Roxana recognizes that despite the merchant's express consent, retaining all of her property would render her emotionally untrustworthy. Her realization finds a useful gloss in Spectator No. 295 (1712), written by Joseph Addison. In that number, Mr. Spectator responds to a letter from "Josiah Fribble, Esq." bemoaning his wife's inflexible demand for her four hundred pounds of "Pin-money" in spite of the fact that he wants to apply that money toward the education of their many children. Pin money, which I am here using metonymically to represent women's financial independence, provides a significant threat to marital stability by eliminating the complai- sance that Addison, like Defoe after him, perceived as necessary to a successful marriage: as Mr. Spectator puts it, "Separate Purses, between Man and Wife, are, in my Opinion, as unnatural as separate Beds" (3: 53). (Recall that Roxana, in her refusal to marry the Dutch merchant, wants separate purses without separate beds, a state that Mr. Spectator would no doubt have found even more unnatural, as does the merchant himself.) Accord- ingly, men find the female dependence that Roxana eschews to be emotionally and erotically stimulating: according to the Spectator, "There is no greater incitement to Love in the Mind of Man, than the Sense of a Person's depend- ing on him for her Ease and Happiness" (3:53). For women, the subordination inherent in such dependence reinforces their cultivation of the traits that will make them desirable, and thereby protected: "a Woman uses all her Endeavours to please the Person whom she looks on as her Honour, her Comfort, and her Support" (3:53). This passage from the Spectator expresses, in microcosmic form, the conflict at the heart of Roxana, a conflict that neither Defoe nor his pro- tagonist can resolve. Whereas Moll's desire to be a "Gentlewoman," which she childishly conceives as being able to "work for myself, and get enough to keep me without that terrible Bug-bear, going to Service" (50), finds early realization in marriage, Roxana's desire for, and attainment of, financial security outside the bounds of daughter- or wifehood cuts to the heart of an eighteenth-century domestic economy predicated, as I have argued, upon women's financial dependence and concomitant emotional and sexual compliance. Indeed, this ideology is precisely what the Dutch merchant articulates in his debate with Roxana, an exchange to which I shall return.</page><page sequence="16">378 Shawn Lisa Maurer The novel's repeated entwinement of financial and emotional con- cerns repeats, in a different form, the economic language that permeates earlier discussions of the relationship between Roxana and the Dutch merchant. Like a good businesswoman concerned with her credit rating, Roxana earnestly wants to repay her obligation to him: using the word "debt" four times in the course of two paragraphs, she offers monetary compensation for the expenses he incurred in dealing with the Jew. The merchant, in turn, employs similar terminology in his interchange with her: "He kept me for a deeper Reckoning, and that, as he had told me, he would put me into a Posture to Even all that Favour, as I call'd it, at once, so we shou'd talk it over another time, and ballance all together" (179). Ironically, his commercial vocabulary and self-control throw Roxana off track; believing it is not usual to delay a "Matter of Love" she thinks it must be a "Matter of Money," and subsequently offers him a considerable loan. He of course turns her down, since what he wants is no more - or less - than marriage, the one "Favour" (185) Roxana refuses to grant. The favor that she does grant - the sexual favor she views as ample recompense for her "debt" - testifies to Roxana's Amazonian status: not only does she desire to erase the sexual double standard and "entertain a Man, as a Man does a Mistress" (188), but she can also - and easily - separate sexuality from marriage. In conventional terms, marriage entails the exchange of female virtue, here conceived as chastity, for financial se- curity; the potential of female sexuality will, it is hoped, result in legitimate heirs to carry on the family fortune. Because Roxana already possesses financial security, she has no need for marriage; with no practi- cal need to maintain her chastity, she can therefore turn her sexual potential into exchange value, whether to repay a debt, as with the mer- chant, or to gain wealth, as with her lovers. While couched as nothing more than rhetoric, a "new Turn" in the discussion that will function to cover up her real, financial reasons for spurning marriage, the "elevated Strain" (187) of Roxana's protofeminist argument bears direct connections both to her primary monetary consid- erations and to her own devastating experience as an abandoned wife. Arguing against "receiv'd Custom" (187), Roxana claims a freedom that is, essentially, the freedom to manage herself and her property indepen- dent of male control. What is under contention, as Roxana - and by extension, Defoe - clearly recognizes, is not a woman's inherent ability to "manage herself suitably": drawing on Lockeian terminology, Roxana declares her belief that "a Woman was a free Agent, as well as a Man, and was born free, and cou'd she manage herself suitably, might enjoy that Liberty to as much Purpose as the Men do" (187). Rather, it is the fact that under the "Laws of Matrimony," a woman moves from being considered a. feme sole, an independent entity capable, under common law, of owning</page><page sequence="17">Roxana's Threat to the Ideology of Marriage 379 property and making legal contracts, to di feme couvert, from whom all such rights were then arrogated to the husband.25 As Roxana clearly articulates it, "the very Nature of the Marriage-Contract was, in short, nothing but giving up Liberty, Estate, Authority, and every-thing, to the Man, and the Woman was indeed, a meer Woman ever after, that is to say, a Slave" (187). In response, the merchant offers three counterarguments: first, a theory of gender complementarity, in which women's supposed subjec- tion becomes no more than managing the assets men accrue through their "Toil" and "Anxiety," for "where the Man did his Duty, the Woman's Life was all Ease and Tranquility" (187-88); second, custom, so that Roxana "shou'd be content with that which all the World was contented with" (189); and third, an ideology of "mutual Love," which eliminates women's "Bondage" by creating "one Interest; one Aim; one Design" be- tween husband and wife (189). Roxana's devastating response, which she later acknowledges derives not from theoretical principles but from her own experience, for "He did not know how feelingly I spoke this" (190), uncovers the way in which such mutuality is impossible under a system that sanctions not affection, but the "Pretence of Affection" (189). Since, as she asserts, the institution of marriage effectively "takes from a Woman every thing that can be call'd herself," a woman thus stripped of legal, economic, even psychic identity can "have no Interest; no Aim; no View; but all is the Interest, Aim, and View, of the Husband" (189). Ultimately, the merchant's strongest contention is the one Roxana finds easiest to refute. Arguing, as it were, ad hominem, the merchant presents himself as the conjugal ideal. The exemplary husband whose efforts will turn Roxana's married life into haven of "Ease and Tranquillity" (188), he even offers to give up any further business dealings should the risk of trade appear to her to be too great. Roxana's realization - that the fault lies not in him but rather within the institution as a whole - testifies, once more, to Defoe's profound ambivalence about women's ordained and sub- ordinate place within marriage. That is, the merchant here seems to serve as Defoe's mouthpiece, ventriloquizing the position Defoe would later flesh out in his marital conduct book, Conjugal Lewdness.26 Yet Roxana's own arguments, which appear, at least by today's standards, significantly more compelling, represent what Defoe - and by extension, the period as a whole - must repress: the figure of the independent Amazon, this Man- Woman's unsettling challenge to the myth of marriage. In a brief exchange that falls at the end of their prolonged discussion, the merchant employs nautical imagery to support his contention that his aim is not to control Roxana or her money, but rather to live on equal terms with her. In fact, he goes so far as to offer Roxana the ability to manage his estate as well as her own: "that we wou'd be upon one Bottom, and [she] shou'd steer" (190). Yet Roxana turns the metaphor</page><page sequence="18">380 Shawn Lisa Maurer back on him when she claims that despite the seeming generosity of his proposal, as her husband the merchant will nevertheless possess the in- dubitable right "to take the Helm out of my Hand when you please, and bid me go spin" (190). Under the laws of marriage, the wife cannot control either her own or her husband's ship, but is instead infantilized: "Ay, says I, you'll allow me to steer, that is, hold the Helm, but you'll conn the Ship, as they call it) that is, as at Sea, a Boy serves to stand at the Helm, but he that gives him the Orders, is a Pilot" (190). In overturning the merchant's argument, Roxana proleptically rewrites an image that Defoe will later employ in Conjugal Lewdness, where he describes the ideal marriage as an anchored ship: "But the Pleasure of a married State consists wholly in the Beauty of the Union, the sharing Comfort, the doubling of all Enjoyments; 'tis the Settlement of Life; the Ship is always in a Storm till it finds this safe Road, and here it comes to an Anchor" (97). Reaching safe harbor, as Roxana knows all too well, depends not on the wife but the husband. Understandably fearful of trusting even the best of men, Roxana instead asserts that women can, indeed should, manage their own estates: "I thought it was far safer for the Sex not to be afraid of the Trouble, but to be really afraid of their Money; that if no-body was trusted, no-body wou'd be deceiv'd; and the Staff in their own Hands, was the best Security in the World" (193).27 And yet, despite the justice of all that she has argued, Roxana at- tributes her refusal of the merchant neither to past experience nor to legitimate principle but, surprisingly, to vanity, pride, and ambition, as she desires to become, once again, a mistress, possibly to the king himself: "Thus blinded by my own Vanity, I threw away the only Opportunity I then had, to have effectually settl'd my Fortunes, and secur'd them for this World; and I am a Memorial to all that shall read my Story; a standing Monument of the Madness and Distraction which Pride and Infatuations from Hell runs us into; how ill our Passions guide us; and how danger- ously we act, when we follow the dictates of an ambitious Mind" (201). The narrative's attempt to take the conventionally accepted moral high ground appears on the surface to efface, or at least to weaken, the power of the previously adumbrated polemic against marriage, a position that I have argued is fundamental to the novel thus far. It is as if the novel's case for female liberty, persuasive as it might be, cannot be allowed a legitimate claim on Roxana's behavior, just as her successful pursuit of wealth cannot be permitted a happy ending. Both Roxana's unconvincing and sudden narrative transformation - from a live woman to a dead symbol, a "Monument" and "Memorial" - and the novel's comparably implausible deus ex machina ending testify to the radi- cal ambivalence at the novel's core. This ambivalence cannot, ultimately, be repressed; instead it must be both articulated and expunged in the</page><page sequence="19">Roxana's Threat to the Ideology of Marriage 381 form of the illegitimate and unnatural Amazon. Indeed the response of both men with whom Roxana discusses her determination to remain a single and thus independent woman - the Dutch merchant and Sir Robert Clayton - highlights the extreme anomaly of her desire. Sir Robert, as we have seen, dubs Roxana's discourse "Amazonian" (212); the merchant re- marks that she must be the "first Woman in the World that ever lay with a Man, and then refus'd to marry him" (185). Later in the same conversa- tion, he announces that Roxana "had started a new thing in the World" and that "however [she] might support it by subtle reasoning, yet it was a way of arguing that was contrary to the general Practice" (193). Roxana, he exclaims, "go[es] upon different Notions from all the World" (196) - indeed she shakes the very foundations of religious and social order. Initially described as "surpriz'd," "confounded," and "astonish'd" by Roxana's refusal to marry him (182-83), the merchant is ultimately rendered "mute" when she simultaneously affirms both her love and her powerful "Aversion" to marriage (185). At this moment in the novel, the merchant's initial confusion and subsequent muteness, his literal inability to respond, serve, I maintain, to mirror Defoe's own reaction to the validity of Roxana's position. For Defoe as well as for his age, there is no legitimate answer to the objections Roxana raises; her vital pursuit of liberty and equality thus falls victim to, is neutralized by, the norms of a morality made all the more pow- erful by virtue of its reassuring conventionality. Although I have stressed Roxana's position as an economic rather than military Amazon, the violence at the center of the Amazon myth finds overt expression in the novel's abrupt and puzzling conclusion. As women who live without and indeed even besiege men, Amazons present a threat which, as Simon Shepherd has noted, "is itself an exhortation to men to be properly manly" (37). Masculine subjectivity, in this novel and through- out the period, is thereby constituted through the need to control, overpower, and ultimately, to destroy, the independent woman. Follow- ing Amy's murder of Roxana's daughter, the two women suffer "a dreadful Course of Calamities," by which they experience "the very Reverse of our former Good Days" (379). Yet those "Calamities" are never described; and the narrative ambiguously ascribes this final reversal of fortune to a num- ber of sources: an outside force, the murder itself, and Roxana's unspecified "Crime": "the Blast of Heaven seem'd to follow the Injury done the poor Girl, by us both; and I was brought so low again, that my Repentance seem'd to be only the Consequence of my Misery, as my Misery was of my Crime" (379). Indeed the mother-daughter bond, as Tyrrell has noted, is the weak- est link under patriarchy: citing the stories of Demeter and Persephone, Clytemnestra and Iphigenia, he notes that the relationship between mother and daughter can be only temporary, as it necessarily yields to marriage</page><page sequence="20">382 Shawn Lisa Maurer and separation (35). At the novel's commencement, the first time Roxana has been "brought so low/' she "gives away" her daughter not in mar- riage but to charity and possible death. While she can recuperate her sons, both legitimate and illegitimate, turning them into successful merchants, her ability to restore her eldest daughter to the gentility in which she her- self had been raised meets with significantly different results. A cook maid raised to the status of a lady, a child without parents, Susan, like the mother whose name she carries, is a daughter "in limbo" (Tyrrell, 66), unable to find her own proper place within a familial or economic structure. The abrupt yet curiously muted violence of this ending serves in many ways to reinforce and recapitulate the disorder at the heart of the novel itself - namely, the risks at stake in transgressing, or inverting, the gender norms that hold patriarchy in place. An Amazon can only be perceived as "unnatural" under the rubric of a sex-gender system that sees masculin- ity and femininity as incommensurable opposites.28 Thus, while I may share with many critics the sense of Defoe's clear admiration for Roxana's fi- nancial prowess, I cannot agree, for example, with Bram Dijkstra's reading of the novel as an allegory of economic progress in which the protagonist's gender is either neutral or irrelevant, or with Mona Scheuermann's asser- tion that "Defoe draws his female characters, as if they were men - that is, simply as human beings, rather than as specifically female human beings" (13). Rather, I see Roxana's economic success as part of the "multiple con- tradictions implicit in ... the narrative itself" (Wiegman, 39), contradictions that serve initially to empower, but ultimately, given the force of the patri- archal system, to limit the heroine. Roxana's attempts to style herself a "Man- Woman," to enjoy Amazonian independence from male economic and sexual control, necessarily situate her outside the bounds of prescribed femininity, into a category of otherness that, under patriarchy, leads both to her own destruction and to that of the daughter who bears her name.

See in particular Chapter XXI, "Of the Tradesman Letting His Wife Be Acquainted with His Business." 4. As James Thompson notes, even the revelation of her incest does not "decenter" Moll Flanders: "familial crime is a local obstacle or crisis to be over- come, and it does not extend its force through to the end of the narrative" (121).</page><page sequence="21">Roxana's Threat to the Ideology of Marriage 383 5. In her compelling analysis of the relationship between the English novel and the emerging sex-gender system of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, The Trauma of Gender: A Feminist Theory of the English Novel, Helene Moglen comes closest to the approach I am advocating here. While I fully share her contention that the "ultimate tragedy of Roxana suggests the intransigence of gender ideol- ogy" (21), my reading of the novel diverges from Moglen's in its greater emphasis on the economic underpinnings of gender difference. Moglen, by contrast, stresses the psychic costs of gender as embodied in the fantastic, as well as realis- tic, elements of Defoe's narrative. 6. See Pateman's influential study, which argues that by obscuring that part of the social contract that depends upon men's subordination of women, contract theory, far from being opposed to patriarchal right, reinscribes that right in a new configuration. 7. Although I am primarily concerned with Roxana's status as an economic Ama- zon, a recent essay by Nina Prytula, "Great-Breasted and Fierce: Fielding's Amazonian Heroines," traces the representations of two other forms of "unnatural" women - the warrior and the intellectual - in Fielding's novels. For a reading of the political woman as Amazon, see Shawn Lisa Maurer, Proposing Men, 126-30. 8. In this earlier analysis of Defoe's novel, Brown reads the Amazon trope in Roxana as exemplifying less gender relations per se than relations of imperialist expansion. See Chapter 5: "Daniel Defoe: Amazons and Africans." 9. In her study of Narrative Transvestism: Rhetoric and Gender in the Eighteenth- Century English Novel, Madeline Kahn reads the figure of the "Man- Woman" not as a disruptive, Amazonian force, but as a trope for the authorial play of the novel itself: "By moving the narrative self from the Lady to the Relator through the Writer to T and back again, [Defoe] creates an ephemeral but effective 'Man- Woman' who can both contain experience and articulate it" (81). In a sense, Kahn argues that while Roxana herself cannot successfully sustain the status of a "Man- Woman," Defoe as author achieves that position through the novel's "transvestite" structure. By contrast, I read Defoe's position as one of fundamental ambivalence. 10. Roxana, Note 183 (p. 393). 11. See William Warner: "A sequential inventory of the several parts of Roxana reveals, first, a (failed) novel of courtship, followed by the five novels of amorous intrigue, and, finally, a novel of pursuit" (153). 12. For a more detailed explication of Roxana as whore, see the recent essay by Alison Conway, "Defoe's Protestant Whore." 13. This separation is itself a product of eighteenth-century ideologies of public and private. See the critique of the public /private dichotomy offered in Maurer, Proposing Men, especially pp. 18-26. 14. See, for example, John Fletcher's The Sea Voyage (1622) and Thomas D'Urfey's 1685 reworking, The Commonwealth of Women, in which women are shipwrecked on islands previously or currently inhabited by Amazons. 15. In her chapter on "The Economics of Courtship and Marriage," Bridget Hill observes that "Wives were frequently deserted and left totally unprovided for" (211). 16. In "The Matrimonial Theme of Defoe's Roxana/' Spiro Peterson usefully elucidates Defoe's awareness of the economic and social contexts for eighteenth- century marriage. Yet, while clearly recognizing the critical import of Roxana's</page><page sequence="22">384 Shawn Lisa Maurer attack on marriage - Peterson writes, for example, that "She has struck directly at a contemporary evil in recognizing, as few social thinkers of the period did, the relationship between the indolence and the economic dependence of upper- middle-class women" (186) - his analysis, to my mind, fails adequately to account for the tragic implications of Roxana's Amazonian choices. 17. Shinagel's study helpfully addresses the problematically aristocratic as- pects of the brewer's behavior (179-80); in "Roxana, Corruption, and the Progressive Myth," Helen Burke offers a comparably compelling analysis of both husband and brother as images "of the new effeminate economic man who, it was feared, had lost the rational and ethical foundation of his personality by en- tering a new fluid and unstable economy" (111-12). 18. See, for example, Hill, Women, Work and Sexual Politics, 51. 19. In contrast to Roxana' s later frugality, which will enable her to increase her wealth by every year adding interest to principal, Roxana's husband here ap- proximates the gentry and nobility in Sir Robert Clayton's example: those who spend all they have (and more) rather than abating their expenses to add to the principal, a method by which "the Gentlemen of England wou'd . . . encrease their Fortunes to a great Degree, just as Merchants do by Trade" (208). 20. Although I have found no specific evidence of this fact, it seems likely that as a keen student of trade Defoe would have known this history. 21. Critical analyses of this passage have focused primarily on the representa- tion of Roxana's increasingly withered body in order to highlight the choice she must make between her own survival and that of her children: "But the Misery of my own Circumstances hardned my Heart against my own Flesh and Blood; and when I consider 'd they must inevitably be Starv'd, and I too, if I continued to keep them about me, I began to be reconcil'd to parting with them all" (52). (See, for example, the readings by Carol Houlihan Flynn, The Body in Swift and Defoe, 76-87, and Helene Moglen, 44-52.) Yet I contend that in its anthropomorphic de- lineation, this "stripp'd" and "naked" domestic sphere itself parallels, indeed provides an objective correlative for, the wasting away of Roxana's own maternal body, a body made "fat and beautiful" not only by prosperity, but by the five children who once occupied it. 22. See Flynn, 76-82. Flynn, however, does not tie Roxana's experience explic- itly to the economic constraints of marriage itself. 23. Roxana herself narrates a final example, that of the "good (tho' unhappy) Quaker" who "had the Misfortune to have had a bad Husband, and he was gone beyond-Sea" (255). Unlike Roxana's own husband, this man has at least left her "a good House, and well furnish'd, and . . . some Jointure of her own Estate, which supported her and her Children, so that she did not want" (255). Power- fully identifying with the Quaker's plight, "tho' she was not left so helpless and friendless as I had been" (297), Roxana both lavishes household goods, including linen and plate, upon her, and grants her a lifetime annuity secured from her husband's control. Indeed, Roxana goes so far as to counsel the Quaker to engage in the same "Frugal Scheme" Sir Robert Clayton had earlier proposed to Roxana herself (297; see note 19 above). In effect, Roxana relives her own misery through the Quaker, albeit with the tables turned.</page><page sequence="23">Roxana's Threat to the Ideology of Marriage 385 24. See, for example, the patient wife in Colly Cibber's popular play, The Care- less Husband (1704), who, upon discovering her husband's intrigue with her maid, does not accuse him but instead wins him with love and forbearance. 25.

See Chapter 1, especially pp. 25-27. 27. After the merchant's reluctant departure from Rotterdam, Roxana begins briefly but vehemently to regret her decision. Using an extended maritime meta- phor, she revisits the image of the safe harbor, this time presenting it as something she desires, but lacks the "Heart" to pursue: "my Notions of things chang'd in an Instant, and I call'd myself a thousand Fools for casting myself upon a Life of Scandal and Hazard; when after the Shipwreck of Virtue, Honour, and Principle, and failing at the utmost Risque in the stormy Seas of Crime, and abominable Levity, I had a safe Harbour presented, and no Heart to cast- Anchor in it" (202). 28. In her early twentieth-century feminist utopia, Herland (1915; New York: Pan- theon, 1979), Charlotte Perkins Gilman rewrites the Amazon myth by eradicating gender difference altogether. In Gilman's all-female society (women reproduce parthenogenically), women's possession of such attributes as strength and skill is completely compatible with their reproductive and nurturing capacities.
