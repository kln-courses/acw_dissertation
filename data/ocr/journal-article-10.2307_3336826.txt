<plain_text><page sequence="1">IN MEMORIAM MARGARET PLASS 1896-1990 It was on a Saturday afternoon in 1946 when I first met Margaret Plass. I was working in the basement of the British Museum when a warder telephoned to say that a lady was in the Ethnographic Galleries and wished to show me something. She was a slender woman in early middle age, with very fair hair, blue eyes, and a remarkable directness of manner, as she ques- tioned me about the sculptures in the galleries, and about two of them in particular which were showing signs of cracking. Margaret had been traveling in East Africa with her hus- band, Webster Plass, who was on a fact-finding mission for his firm, the Sharpless Company, and their interest in Africa had led them to buy a Baule figure on their way through Paris; the figure was showing signs of cracking. This preoccupation with the conservation of objects, as well as their origins, I was to discover was typical of Margaret's universal attitude toward life in general, revealing an unexpected thoughtfulness beneath her gaiety and exuberance. She, together with her husband, was a considerate and generous patron of the Museum, who bought a number of sculptures destined for the Museum's collections and also financed many of my field expeditions to Africa. It was at my suggestion that Margaret attended the Felix Feneon sale in Paris in 1947, where she made five or six important purchases, includ- ing the fine Guro mask now in the Museum's collections. Margaret was a frequent visitor to the Museum during the next two decades, both while Webster was traveling in Africa and after his death in 1953. She helped me sort out the accu- mulation of papers on my desk-not always with my fullest approval, but no doubt she earned the gratitude of many of my correspondents. Sir Frank Francis (Director of the British Museum) created for her the unique position of Honorary Assistant Keeper at the Museum, and he remained a good friend of hers for life. She was awarded the O.B.E. in 1967. The Royal Anthropological Institute also benefitted from her enthusiasm, and it was at her instigation that the late Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, became the patroness of that Institute for a number of years. Frank McEwen was grateful to Margaret for her enthu- siasm and assistance with exhibitions of Shona sculpture in Salisbury (I.C.A.C., 1962) and London (I.C.A., 1972). The first field expedition we undertook together was when Margaret joined me for a fort- night in Cameroon in 1966. She bore the rigors of a demanding and tiring journey with cheerfulness and resourcefulness, and on her return painted a vast mural for the Field Muse- um in Chicago, at their request. There followed, in 1969, a trip to Upper Volta and Mali, when we formed a very merry party which included Kat White, David Crownover, and Theodore Roosevelt IV (who was attached to the Embassy at Ouagadougou and who was known as TR4). The third voyage was to the Kabail in the hills of Algeria in 1971, with John Picton, where we survived driv- ing about the tortuous bends of those mountain roads. Our relationship miraculously survived the collaboration on a paperback entitled African Sculpture, published by Studio Vista/Dutton in 1964. During the 1970s Margaret's visits to London were infrequent and finally stopped entirely, but I was able to visit her in Philadelphia once or twice a year. It was only during the past five or six years that she did not have the busy social life she so enjoyed, and to the last her friends were always welcome in her apartment. Many of her best friends called her Margot, but to me she was always Margaret. ritual expertise to a biochemist, you have a talented African herbal doctor. Schildkrout is also inclined to define, in a simplistic manner, concepts and issues that scholarship is already notorious for miscon- struing. Her idea of "traditional," expressed at various points in the introduction, is a good example, as are her interpretations of the con- cepts of "alien" and "other." Amongst other things, she contrasts Islam with "indigenous belief systems," with no apparent understand- ing of the many things Islam has become over the hundreds of years that it has in fact been an indigenous African belief system. Schildkrout's introduction also empha- sizes a much more negative twist on the beliefs this text presents than do the authors themselves. I think it establishes an unfortu- nate tone for the book, and furthermore I think it unjustifiably undermines much of the authors' work. I'm sorry to seem so harsh, but I see no reason for its inclusion, and I would rather have seen the space it occupies given over to Anderson and Kreamer. Given all this, we are justified if we wonder just what Schildkrout might have changed in Anderson's and Kreamer's text, for which she served as editor. None of this, not even my complaints about the text, should detract from Ander- son's and Kreamer's accomplishment. This book brings a very important subject before us again, and goes much further in surveying and synthesizing materials that have been begging for our attention than any other pub- lication to date. I think it is an important con- tribution to our field, and I hope it stimulates other scholars. D SOUNDING FORMS African Musical Instruments Edited by Marie-Therese Brincard American Federation of Arts, New York, 1989. 207 pp., 231 b/w &amp; 29 color photographs, map, glossary, bibliographies. $35 softcover. Reviewed by Monica Blackmun Visona William Fagg London, England are partly based on these societies' emphasis on agriculture. The insidious twist comes, in my opinion, when she then tumbles into proclamations that come very close to saying that if these societies were given the technolo- gy to help them overcome the challenges of nature, their "somewhat paranoid view of the wilderness" would die, along with much of their art. She seems to liken their beliefs about spirits to our "half-credited tales of little folk, Bigfoot, and UFOs," and asserts that "there are probably few, if any, African agronomists, veterinarians, or biochemists who subscribe to the beliefs described in this work." Does she mean to say that with the import of West- ern technology and "real" science, educated Africans will see the superstition in their ways? This strikes me as a fundamental mis- understanding of African religions and philosophies, which she roughly grounds in fear of the unknown. I would bet that there are plenty of sensible African agronomists and veterinarians who subscribe to the beliefs explored in this book, and if you add some Over the last five years, much exciting and provocative discussion has taken place regarding the nature of Western responses to African art. This discussion has been due in part to the controversy generated by the exhi- bition "'Primitivism' in 20th Century Art," organized by William Rubin for the Museum of Modern Art in 1984. Particularly interesting analyses of specific approaches to the study of African artistic achievements have been set forth in several catalogues accompanying exhibitions of the Center for African Art in New York (Baldwin et al., Perspectives: Angles on African Art, 1987; Danto et al., Art/Artifact: African Art in Anthropology Collections, 1988).

She also tells him that if he wants to receive, he must learn to give. The meaning of her spiritual message becomes clear to him when he observes the Comrades in jail. He sees them guide and support each other in maintaining discipline and focus, and cement their collective activi- ty through group song and dance, thus embodying the essential African value of solidarity. This value is sometimes expound- ed non-verbally, such as when the prisoners simply move in rhythm and hum, transmit- ting their deep solidarity through a collec- tive memory of ancient ways and translating that solidarity to a mass audience through the iconography of cinema. The film thus suggests that true Africanness can be con- sciously rediscovered in the spirit of older values-a spirit it locates directly in the structures of birthing a modern nation- rather than in the sentimental manipulation of superficial symbols of African ethnicity. By the end of the film no one has gained materially, but Panic (and, one hopes, the books Continued from page 32 ethnocentricity and aesthetics, her catalogue Sounding Forms: African Musical Instruments immediately brings such issues to mind. Sounding Forms contains essays and cata- logue entries by fifteen different scholars, but its underlying themes and organization are described in the opening essay by Brincard, its editor. Her approach is rigorously formal- istic; the objects in the publication are catego- rized as chordophones, membranophones, idiophones, and aerophones rather than by cultural role, region, or ethnic origin. The instruments are then further divided accord- ing to whether they are adorned with human or animal forms and whether full figures, partial figures, hands, or heads are represent- ed. As a result, Mangbetu harps are inter- spersed with those of the Fang, Senufo, and Mende, and similarly constructed instru- ments may be separated by more distantly related ones because the former display dif- ferent parts of the body. In her opening remarks, Brincard explains that only musical instruments incorporating anthropomorphic or zoomorphic images have been selected, ostensibly to provide a unifying theme for the exhibition and its cata- logue. The only object with no discernible fig- urative details, a wonderfully grooved mbira from Zaire (cat. no. 82), seems to have slipped in by accident. The reader is thus left with the impression that the sculptural form of the musical instrument, its workmanship, and the harmony of its parts are less worthy of aesthetic study than attached or incorporated representational images. In fact, Brincard evi- dently regards human or animal figures as "ornamentation" rather than as striking visu- South African viewer) gains a more sustain- ing identity. For ordinary South Africans, just seeing themselves and their problems authenticated in the myth-making dimensions of the big screen purveys a vision of the new reality taking shape. To Schmitz and his collabora- tors, this film-made inside South Africa by a mixed-race crew-represents that new reality. Making a film like Mapantsula is a process, as Schmitz says, "of breaking denial, of ceasing to live only a half-life," and of recognizing that one cannot stop doing things solely because one is told not to do them. This process reflects the spirit of mass resistance by which South African audiences will recognize themselves even in a character like Panic. Mapantsula engages viewers by dramatiz- ing the problems and events of their every- day lives, and in so doing challenges them to position themselves in the context it estab- lishes-that is, to choose who they would (or must) be. Although a black South African audience is not homogeneous, Mapantsula creates a deeper awareness of the circum- stances all blacks must face by depicting the al elements in a larger sculptural composition (p. 17). Her categorization of figures as isolat- ed decoration can be noted in some of the photographs, which do not allow us to see the entire instrument but display only the anthropomorphic image. The human figures forming part of an instrument are always illustrated in an upright position, even when (as is the case with the flutes from Burkina Faso) their orientation on the objects may have varied from piece to piece. Such exam- ples as these could have been photographed from better angles to remind us that African instruments were not meant to be viewed from a fixed perpendicular viewpoint. Brincard refers to the short section at the end of this publication that features sculp- tural representations of musical instruments as well as statues, reliefs, and goldweights of musicians. In her words, these are "related objects on which musical instruments them- selves, figured together with their players, have become ornamental elements or sculp- tures in their own right" (p. 17). Some minia- ture instruments are included in this category because they are primarily used as insignia marking social status and religious affiliation. However, since several of these pendants may have also been used to produce sound, they do not necessarily belong in this portion of the catalogue. Brincard is justifiably proud of having assembled an "extensive corpus" of musical instruments for this exhibition, all of whose 181 objects are illustrated in the catalogue. When an interesting work was unavailable for the show, its photograph and a full caption were placed in an appropriate section of the publication. Thus, two Baga drums with cary- atids, neither of which were on display, may moral conflicts and clashes within black South African communities. Even for whites, the message is clear; they will continue to become objects of individual acts of rage and repossession such as Panic's, because these are engendered by the same system that forces others, like Duma, into more organized acts of resistance. But in the end, the film sug- gests, even the unavoidable pain caused by apartheid can still be used consciously, for the common good. Moving with high drama from one town- ship scenario to the next, often with fine edit- ing and brilliant acting, Mapantsula entertains while addressing some of the most pressing urban realities of crisis-torn South Africa. Ironically, in the history of South African film, Mapantsula is far more impor- tant than the sequel to The Gods Must Be Crazy, produced by Jamie Uys, which has received better commercial distribution abroad. Despite its formal difficulties and insufficient attention to township humor, Mapantsula, which suggests that anyone can change, remains a refreshing work of opti- mism and confidence. D be studied in the catalogue and compared to Luba, Bembe, Loango, and Senufo works. The thirty-seven additional pieces are distinguish- able from the works originally exhibited only because they are assigned figure numbers rather than catalogue numbers; the length of these entries and the size of their photographs are consistent with those of the other 181 works. These additional catalogue entries allow Brincard to provide the reader with a more comprehensive group of images, includ- ing a broad range of object types. However, at least one piece in the exhibition (cat. no. 97, a Luba calabash probably used by the Buhabo society) may not have been made to produce music, and another example (cat. no. 122, an ivory horn with a highly unusual head) may not even be African. As an art historian, I found Brincard's opening essay troubling. I was particularly displeased by her misuse of the term "art-his- torical" to denote an exercise in formal analy- sis, as when she describes "the captions, which treat these objects in art-historical fash- ion as sculpture tout court" (p. 16). Several decades ago it might indeed have been acceptable for art historians to examine art objects in purely formal terms. However, self- respecting scholars in the field have not been discussing sculpture tout court for quite some time now. In all areas of art history, contextual and iconographic data are regarded as central, rather than peripheral, to discussions of form. Brincard's remarks also suggest that the aesthetic value of African musical instru- ments may be adequately perceived in their stripped, isolated museum existence, an assumption carried through the catalogue. Although the essays by J.H. Kwabena Nketia and Christraud Geary include photographs 89</page><page sequence="3">of musical instruments being played, no other contextual photographs or diagrams may be found in the rest of the catalogue, and none of the captions describe how the instru- ments were held. Surely someone else would also like to know whether a carved face was turned toward the performer or toward the audience, toward the sky or toward the earth. In addition, information on which instru- ments made music, which sang, which spoke, and which made noise is sometimes provided in individual essays, but is rarely mentioned in the captions. Evidently the catalogue is organized around a rather limited definition of both aesthetics and formal analysis. These scholarly essays are described as follows: "Six authors, each following his [sic] methodological lights, draw attention to sculptural aspects of African musical instru- ments." These lights illuminate the subject in very different ways, however, and reflect dif- ferences of perspective as well as methodolo- gy. Several contributions, for instance, challenge the assumptions of the editor, and a dialogue between Brincard and the contribu- tors, or even an acknowledgment of their philosophical differences, would have made for a more stimulating book. The first two essays, "The Aesthetic Dimensions of African Musical Instruments," by J.H. Nketia, and "African Musical Instru- ments and Their Decoration," by Bertil Soderberg, introduce the variety of musical instruments used in Africa. The inclusion of both introlductory essays provides a very interesting contrast between the contempo- rary interest in African aesthetic systems and more traditional forms of connoisseurship. At first glance, Brincard's decision to present the two consecutively may imply that she is inviting the reader to weigh their differing perspectives. Unfortunately, her lack of com- mentary on Nketia's essay in her opening essay suggests that she has not given it very careful consideration. Bertil S6derberg's contribution, however, is cited by Brincard as being an important source of inspiration for the exhibition. Origi- nally published ten years ago in Arts d'Afrique Noire, it was translated into English for this catalogue. Soderberg states that the "relation between musical instruments and art can be divided into (1) decorated musical instruments and (2) instruments serving as decorative motifs on other objects." He thus implies that musical instruments with no ornamentation are not works of art, although he does mention unadorned objects such as bamboo tubes when running through a list of African musical devices. When he asserts that the stretching cords of African drums are not "considered as decoration, though they sometimes give that impression" (p. 34), we may assume that he is using the word "deco- ration" to refer only to any formal elements given aesthetic consideration. While Soder- berg's definition of art may be circumscribed, his definition of musical instruments is refreshingly broad; he discusses both the human body and Senufo "rhythm pounders" as idiophones. S6derberg's essay is a fine example of tra- ditional Western scholarship. He briefly describes the visual attributes of a bewilder- ing variety of instruments from all areas of Africa, organizing them into the same cate- gories chosen for the entries in this catalogue. Occasionally he pauses to describe the usage or symbolic importance of a particular object, sometimes citing other sources, sometimes drawing upon his own extensive knowledge of the music and art of Central Africa. Unfor- tunately, Soderberg often forgets to indicate when he is generalizing about African art and when his remarks describe only the art of Zaire. In a discussion of African rattles, for example, he suggests, "Perhaps they were used by the banganga or chiefs during magi- cal rainmaking ceremonies" (p. 33). Those not familiar with African art may not realize that the term banganga is not pan-African. Nketia's excellent contribution, written specifically for the catalogue, describes the visual appreciation of musical instruments in Africa as part of a larger response to complex multisensory and multivalent experiences. As he so lucidly states in his essay, the instruments' original placement before an audience and as part of an ensemble, their ornamentation with non-durable materials, and their relationship to the body, costume, and movement of the musician all have an impact upon the visual, let alone aural, impression that they make in their African context. His interest in the aesthetics of the "design, construction, and ornamentation" of musical instruments contrasts strongly with Soderberg's assumption that only part of an instrument may be evaluated in aes- thetic terms. The examples chosen by Nketia to illustrate the many roles played by musi- cal instruments in Africa are particularly interesting. The following essay, Jean-Sebastien Lau- renty's cursory survey of "Anthropomor- phism, Zoomorphism, and Abstraction in the Musical Instruments of Central Africa," is mostly limited to physical description of the works. He does close his essay, however, with a suggestion that the relationships between divination and music be explored, and he supports further study of musical instruments as sacred symbols. His proposed classification of instruments with representa- tional forms seems to have been adopted by Brincard for the catalogue. Divergences between the perspective of the editor and those of the individual contrib- utors to Sounding Forms are usually implicit rather than explicit. For example, at the beginning of her cogent essay "African Mbira as Musical Icons," Cynthia E. Schmidt cau- tions that "an awareness of the way Africans view their art-generally with a more unified creative concept-demands that one avoid a distorted perspective based on a Western aes- thetic response." In her closing comments she argues the need for "a perspective informed by insights of makers and musicians that give further clarification to such issues as the nexus between musical expression and sym- bolic art forms." The other thematic essay, which describes the structure of one category of stringed instruments, is by Sue Carole DeVale. "African Harps: Construction, Decoration, and Sound," while providing a wealth of straightforward technical information on harps, also includes a case study of the ngom- bi, a Bwiti harp of the Fang of Gabon, as an example of their iconographical possibilities. The other scholars contributing to the cat- alogue discuss limited geographical areas and are thus able to analyze the interrelation- ship between form and meaning with a fair degree of surety. Their information, based upon their own fieldwork experiences, would have been challenging to evaluate in terms of the questions posed elsewhere in the catalogue. The concise, informative essays by Doran Ross ("Master Drums from Akan Pop- ular Bands") and Christopher Roy ("A Nuna Flute: Attribution and Meaning") differ only in length from the short, authoritative cap- tions written by researchers such as Arthur Bourgeois, Byrna Freyer, and Frederick Lamp. Ross's contribution contains a mis- print, since he mentions a Ghanaian Akan drum (probably listed as cat. no. 31) but refers to catalogue number 48, a Baule work. Christraud Geary's readable and well-illus- trated article ("Slit Gongs in the Cameroon Grassfields: Sights and Sounds of Beauty and Power") provides rich contextual material for two works in the exhibit. Though Robert Far- ris Thompson's essay, "Body and Voice: Kongo Figurative Musical Instruments" elu- cidates only five Kongo works (cat. no. 127 in his essay actually refers to cat. no. 128), it has relevance to many more. Regrettably, neither his essay nor the catalogue entries set forth the cultural and historical links between the Kongo, Vili, Sundi, Yombe, and so on. Although specialists may be able to identify art forms from these peoples of the lower Congo River region as belonging to the same milieu, non-specialists should not be forced to deduce this after perusing several sections of the catalogue. All of the essays would have been more useful if they were linked to specific cata- logue entries. Although Jean-Sebastien Lau- renty's generalized piece on Central African instruments could not have been placed near a uniform group of works, it makes no sense at all to separate Sue Carole DeVale's essay on harps and Cynthia E. Schmidt's essay on mbira from corresponding sections of the cat- alogue entries. Relating information from the essays to the individual works in the exhibi- tion is difficult because so few of the essays are noted in the captions. The iconography set forth by Thompson is especially hard to use because the motifs he translates for the reader are found in several works whose cap- tions contain no references to his essay. Strangely enough, of all of the writers, only Cynthia Schmidt provided captions for the works discussed in her essay (although Roy and Geary wrote catalogue entries for objects not mentioned in their articles). This is unfortunate, for the catalogue entries writ- ten by the editor, or by Christine Mullen 90</page><page sequence="4">Kreamer in conjunction with the editor, often ignore the information given in the essays. Perhaps the authors of the captions were not able to read the essays before preparing their own contributions. All too often the cata- logue entries begin with a description of the forms and end with a parting comment con- cerning usage. Much of the writing in the middle centers upon ethnic origin. As a result, general readers with little background in African art may well be frustrated by some of the catalogue entries, particularly if they do not read the essays before turning to an analysis of the objects. Will they really be enlightened by the catalogue's association of a Pere horn with an Idoma dance headdress (p. 158), or a Kongo whistle with a Dogon shrine figure (p. 166)? It is entirely normal for a reader to want to acquire at least one inter- esting tidbit of information regarding Central African phallic whistles (p. 172). Without any prior knowledge of the nkisi of the Kongo, a general reader would be perplexed when told only that "radiographs reveal that metal has been inserted into cavities in the...chest" of a figure on a Vili horn. Catalogue entries are extremely difficult to research and even worse to write, but full explanations (and/or admis- sions of ignorance) are necessary if they are to be intelligible to anyone other than specialists. The contributions of Wendy Schonfield, who produced the bulk of the entries for the final section on depictions of musical instru- ments in art, tend to be quite informative. The best captions were written by authorities invited to comment upon musical instru- ments they have studied in other contexts. Arthur Bourgeois, Byrna Freyer, and Freder- ick Lamp integrate discussions of the history and symbolism of a work in order to give readers an appreciation for its form. Some of the entries written by Brincard and Kreamer are also quite good; Kreamer's discussion of a Bamana slit gong-rasp, Brin- card's analysis of a Yoruba drum, and their joint work on Afro-Portuguese horns are all well written and informative. The inevitable factual errors arising in a work covering such a broad range of cultures are not partic- ularly glaring. A slit gong (cat. no. 64) is list- ed as being from the Lemba ethnic group rather than as part of the insignia for the Lemba society of the Kongo people. A drum (fig. 9) published in the catalogue is attribut- ed to the Maravi, incorrectly located in Swaziland and southern Mozambique rather than in Malawi. Strange statements such as "Jean-Sebastien Laurenty suggests that such gongs manifest primarily the artists' talents" (p. 127) invariably slip by editors. I was much more bothered by Cynthia Schmidt's assertion that "Teke religion is characterized by a variety of magico-religious cults, some of which use wooden figures" (p. 135). While such a characterization would also apply to Catholicism, the terms "magico- religious" and "cults" have unpleasant asso- ciations in contemporary American culture. Scholars must coin new phrases when those found in the literature enforce negative stereotypes. Despite the aesthetic quality and variety of the objects illustrated in the catalogue, the presentation of the publication itself may not attract those outside the field. While the essays are well designed, the catalogue entries are visually disorganized. Photographs were provided by the lenders and therefore vary in size, background, and quality. Almost all reproduce the object clearly enough, although some examples, such as two photographs of zithers, show only the figures rather than the entire instrument. Among the color pho- tographs are some sumptuous images, but they have been printed on a very small scale next to several black-and-white reproduc- tions. It must have been possible to utilize these visual resources more effectively and to provide the publication with a more appeal- ing cover. The strength of this publication lies in the quality of the scholarship found in the indi- vidual contributions and in the variety of objects illustrated. It therefore provides valu- able material for future cross-cultural and interdisciplinary studies of plastic, kinetic, and acoustic arts. The philosophical approach taken by the editor would have gone unchal- lenged until recently, but our increasing appreciation of African aesthetic systems makes her approach to form seem unneces- sarily restrictive. Since art historians through- out the discipline are acknowledging the importance of contextual analysis, catalogues focusing upon formal analysis are progres- sively less interesting and less stimulating to those outside the field. In fact, more discus- sion about the roles of art and music in soci- ety might have rendered Sounding Forms more exciting for specialists as well. E DREAMINGS The Art of Aboriginal Australia Edited by Peter Sutton George Braziller Publishers in association with the Asia Society Galleries, New York, 1988. 266 pp., 92 b/w &amp; 153 color photos, 47 drawings, 7 maps, chart, catalogue, biographies, index, notes, bibliography. $65 hardcover. Reviewed by Tony Fry Dreamings received a good deal of popular exposure in Australia well before the arrival of the exhibition of the same name. Although it serves as a catalogue for that exhibition, which opened its tour of the U.S. and Aus- tralia with the installation at the Asia Society Gallery in New York, it also asserts itself as one of the most significant books on the Abo- riginal art of Australia published so far. It is also quite clear that one of its primary func- tions is to position itself as an authoritative mediator between the art and audiences. What it wishes to do, then, is to provide information that enables the viewer to under- stand the art. The implications of some of its positions, and the way these positions are articulated, will concern us here. First, some basic information to clear the ground. The book is clearly written, well designed in a large format, and printed to a high standard. The bulk of the text is made up of six essays, presented as chapters, by anthropologists Peter Sutton, Christopher Anderson, and Franqoise Dussart, as well as by curators Philip Jones and Steven Hem- ming. Following the essays is the catalogue of objects. As the catalogue is reached by means of information that can be passed through or over, the act of mediation here figures as a desired reading practice. After introducing the history of the proj- ect, Sutton and Anderson raise issues under a number of headings, starting with "The Poli- tics of Representation," a notion that sits in contradiction with a good deal of the politics of their individual practices. Then they briefly identify some of the problems of defining art in Aboriginal culture and present information about the artists and their cultural back- ground. In the first chapter Sutton puts forth his interpretation of how dreaming, as a basis for the conceptualization of the Aboriginal life world, can be understood by non-Aboriginal peoples. Next he addresses questions of image reader response to the genres of the art, particularly bark painting. Sutton's subse- quent essay, in the third chapter ("The Mor- phology of Feeling"), clarifies his approach to reading the art: he favors a reductive and for- malist iconographic analysis of works. The Eurocentric bias exposed by this preference is nowhere more evident than in his account of the "visual logic and the way forms come together to create the look of the art" (p. 59). In chapter four, Anderson and Dussart pre- sent their account of how Western Desert acrylic dot painting developed into a contem- porary Aboriginal art form. Jones, in the next chapter, sketches the changes in Western per- ceptions of Aboriginal art. Sutton, Jones, and Hemming conclude by taking stock of the surviving traditions and new visual cultures of Aboriginal people. Dreamings claims implicitly that contextual information provided by experts will enhance one's comprehension, and especially one's appreciation, of Aboriginal culture. The text's functional subordination to enrichment is manifest in a variety of ways. The provision of what are claimed as facts, the decoding of symbolic forms and belief systems, and the information about historical context are all used to feed appreciation. Thus the anthropol- ogist or historian places himself as mediator between the art and its Western audience, that is, between the culture of (an)other people and the culture in power. He or she is empowered to translate or transfer myth, sign, and code from the observed culture to the observing one. This position is, of course, inherent in the ethnographic methods of anthropology. It also marks the crisis in the discipline. Critiquing the ethnocentric grounds of anthropology involves questioning the norma- tive framework of Western rationalism. The recent focus on work between the two world 91</page></plain_text>
