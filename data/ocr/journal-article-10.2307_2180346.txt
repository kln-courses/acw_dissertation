<plain_text><page sequence="1">DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES A Study in ?Esthetics. By Louis ARNAUD REID. New York, The Mac- millan Company, I93I. Pp. 4i6. A good deal of this book is more or less conventional, though always in- formed and competent, discussion of those elementary distinctions without which it is still unwise, if not impossible, to proceed with esthetic subject- matter proper. The body of the Study is devoted to problems rather as they have happened to be defined by writers of varying interests-philosophers like Croce and Santayana, critics like Fry, literary 2estheticians like Aber- crombie, scholars like Carritt, psychological value-theorists like Richards- than as they might come up in an independently systematic treatment. The discussions err, perhaps, in the direction of too meticulously elaborate con- sideration of other men's views, not at all in the direction of dogmatic brevity. There is a treatment of "kinds " of beauty; but it is, as the author suggests, rather too brief to be significant. Mr. Reid's own epistemological studies furnish the basis for his account of the relations of art to truth and reality, and he reveals his own direct critical attention to the nature of actual appreciation in the distinction he enforces between psychological and aesthetic fusion, and between direct and indirect aesthetic expression. His rather elaborate account of subject-matter as on various levels will not, I think, bear critical scrutiny. To say the least, the number of levels appears to be quite arbitrary. The particular form of expressionist theory that Mr. Reid holds to, combined with a definitely realistic philosophical view, results in discussing natural beauty as an enigma. It is hard to take natural beauty as peculiarly enigmatic in the first place; it is still harder to take seriously a more or less super- natural solution of the alleged enigma. The divine revealed in the sensuous fits very well, perhaps, into a Hegelian or a medieval scheme, but one is inclined to take the suggestion that nature might be the active expression of God's aesthetic imagination as pretty frivolous anthropomorphism, not as rational theory, though British philosophers, even more commonly than Americans, still think it appropriate to take theism as a genuine philosophical issue amenable to rational treatment. If Mr. Reid's Study requires some patience on the part of a reader, that is not a fault; and since the reading can hardly be done without real profit, one would be a grudging critic indeed not to record its lucid honesty of statement, its very exceptionally adequate and at the same time critical treat- ment of other men's theories, and its genuine contribution to the clarification of many of the vital issues in current aesthetic theory.

By CHARLES HowARD McILwAIN. The Mac- millan Company, I932. PP. X, 4i8. This book offers an excellent account of political philosophy from its beginnings in Greece to about the middle of the fifteenth century. The chap- ters on Plato and Aristotle are developed, as they should be, in close relation to the institutions and the modes of thought proper to the city-state. That dealing with Rome presents not only the philosophy of natural law, which descended from the Stoics through Cicero and Seneca, but also the pro- foundly important contributions to thought about government made through Roman law and administration. In his account of the early Middle Ages Professor McIlwain devotes relatively a large amount of space to St. Augustine, and represents him more correctly, I believe, both in respect to his meaning and his influence, than either Carlyle or Figgis. In the later Middle Ages Marsilio of Padua is the last thinker described at length, since it is Professor McIlwain's judgment that Marsilio brought the opposing ideas of ecclesiasticism and secularism to a sharp logical issue. The ar- rangement of material in this part of the subject presents difficulties which the author has handled as well as can probably be expected. The funda- mental question is the relation of church and state, but it is impossible to exclude other issues which were of great moment in later political thought. The problem of making a smoothly developing story, without doing violence to fact, is perhaps insoluble. The concluding chapter is an illuminating dis- cussion of sovereign power as it existed, or did not exist, in the minds of men at the close of the Middle Ages. The distinction upon which Professor McIlwain insists, and without which the theory of sovereignty cannot be discussed intelligibly, is between a clear conception of the sovereign's obli- gations, both to the well-being of his subjects and to the dictates of a higher law, and the conception of his freedom of discretion in his own sphere, coupled with the absence of constitutional agencies to implement the sub- ject's rights. GEORGE H. SABINE CORNELL UNIVERSITY Berkeley's American Sojourn. By BENJAMIN RAND. Cambridge, Harvard University Press, I932. Dr. Rand's account of Berkeley's visit to America is written with his usual accuracy and mastery of the source-material. The letters of Henry Newman shed some additional light upon Berkeley's activities in America, and Dr. Rand for the first time describes his visit to Boston in i73i. The author further emphasizes the fact that Berkeley returned to England in 17i6, so that part of the evidence, at least, ordinarily used to discredit the statement of George Monck Berkeley concerning Swift's marriage col- lapses. Dr. Rand also brings up once more the question of the possible in- fluence of Berkeley upon Edwards' Notes on the Mind and regards the</page><page sequence="3">234 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLII. matter as still unsettled, in spite of the " results " of recent American scholar- ship. Does he not, however, create an erroneous impression by his statement that Brown, the Provost of Trinity, and King, the Archbishop of Dublin, were Berkeley's " teachers " while he was a student (p. 4) ? JOHN WILD HARVARD UNIVERSITY Das Buld des Menschen. in Schopenhauers Philosophie. Von K ONRAD PFEIFFER. Berlin und Leipzig, Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., I932. Pp. 224. This volume is an anthology of passages from Schopenhauer's works, about one hundred and seventy extracts grouped in forty-four chapters, selected and arranged with the aim of disclosing Schopenhauer's view of human character and human life. The editor has introduced each of his chapters with an explanatory note and also with a motto from the works of Goethe, between whose philosophy of life and Schopenhauer's he per- ceives close kinship. The titles of the four main divisions of the book may serve to suggest its scope: " Des Menschen Erdenlos ", " Die ewige Idee des Menschen ", "Grade des Menschentums", "Moralische Bedeutung des Menschenlebens ". RADOSLAV A. TSANOFF THE RICE INSTITUTE Studies in Philosophical Naturalism. Edited by H. G. TOWNSEND. Eugene, University of Oregon Publications, Humanities Series, Vol. I, No. I, i93i. Pp. 6o. This slim sheaf of essays, written by members of a philosophical seminar at the University of Oregon, grew out of a study of current philosophical naturalism as exemplified particularly by Alexander's Space, Time, and Deity. The contributors are (or were) teachers from the departments of philoso- phy, education, English, and history. The papers reveal a kind of enthusiasm and dogmatism which is perhaps inevitable in what appears to be for the most part the work of amateurs. But for all that they are worth an evening's reading. Mr. Townsend writes on " The Nature of Knowledge and the Knowledge of Nature ", Mr. Denny on " The Romance of Emergence ", Mr. Leighton on " Alexander's Doctrine of Value as Emergent in Nature ", Miss Smith on " The Emergence of Individuality in the Philosophy of Alexander ", Mr. Jessup on " Naturalism in Space-Time and Essence ", Mr. Rebec on "The Logical Root of Modern Life ". One suspects that the authors derived considerably more fun and profit among themselves in writ- ing these papers than the papers will afford their readers. ALBUREY CASTELL UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA</page><page sequence="4">No. 2.] DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 235 Sinn und Sein im Gegenstande der Erkenntnis. Von GUENTER RALFS. Tfibingen, J. C. B. Mohr, I93I. Pp. i46. This work belongs to the Kantian school of Rickert and Cassirer; al- though influenced by the realistic movement of Bolzano and phenomeno- logy, it still adheres piously to the approach of the first Critique, presenting in an able and careful way an extension of Kant's doctrine of intuition. To Kant's synthesis of concept and sensation in the synthetic proposition the author brings an intuitive synopsis symbolized by the copula but itself prior to the universal logical expression. The universal proposition derives its objectivity, its transcendence of the subjective logical form, from this synop- sis, which is a particular, concrete, and inexhaustible complex, irrational yet significant, determined in part from without the subject and then determin- ing in its turn the logical expression. (The synopsis is presented as a de- velopment of Kant's Schema.) It becomes the business of the "critical" philosopher to inquire into the objective conditions of such a synopsis, and these conditions are discovered in a more liberal conception of the spatial and temporal forms of intuition. Kant is defended from the interpretation identifying these forms with the logical concepts of a Euclidian geometry. Intuitive space and time are not invariable; they mediate a plurality of quantitative or geometrical conceptualizations and provide the basis also of a qualitative variety of aesthetic, religious, historical, and other perspec- tives. This discussion includes some of the happiest pages of the book. It is doubtful, in spite of the judicious quotations from Kant and the orthodox terminology, whether this emphasis upon intuition does not destroy the Kantian system. After all, it is Kant's assumption that the forms of intuition determine one and only one system of explicit geometry that bridges the gulf for him between thought and sensation, and between the particular and the universal. Intuitions, this writer tells us, are unique and concrete; each then may require its peculiar spatial description, which would be neces- sarily predicative only of it. Yet we must somehow discover in the pre- logical stage of knowledge a ground of universality; we must recognize in the intuition an element of generality, for otherwise, as happens in this book, sensation (das blosse Sinnliche) and concept hang in air, their con- nection a mystery. Bare sensation may well be dismissed as fiction, making room for an articulate sensory intuition not necessarily limited to space- time structure; and in this case the manifold unities of intuition, clearly dis- tinguished from the larger unities of thought, while remaining the objective ground of the latter, may determine a plurality of conceptual systems. What is living and essential in idealistic thought will be guaranteed by the compre- hensiveness of the conceptual system, and by its involvement of a cognitive interest in the subject radically distinct from the animal interests determin- ing the sensory intuitions. HUGH MILLER UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT Los ANGELES 17</page><page sequence="5">236 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLII. The Emergence of Life. By JOHN BUTLER BURKE. Oxford, The Univer- sity Press, I93I. PP. Viii, 398. This lengthy contribution to " speculative " philosophy is intended primar- ily as an inquiry into the nature of life. Scattered autobiographical remarks indicate that years ago the author made an ill-starred excursion into " ex- perimental" biology, seeking to demonstrate that matter, both living and non-living, arises from "biogen" or ether-stuff. Now after a long period of silence and study, he returns to the fray a theorist, armed with Plato's Ideas, Leibniz's Monads, Kant's Transcendental Ego, Hegel's Absolute, Boole's Algebra, Einstein's Theory of Relativity, Dirac's Quantum Physics, and Mendel's Laws of Heredity. The volume bears the impressive sub-title: "A treatise on mathematical philosophy and symbolic logic by which a new theory of space and time is evolved." Mr. Burke believes that Boole's calculus, with Hegelian modifica- tions, offers a method of great efficacy in the solving of all manner of philosophic and scientific problems. The sub-title is thus explained by the extensive use of this algebraic symbolism and by the frequent mention of Fourier series, Taylor's Theorem, and the Lorentz transformations. That the mere substitution of algebraic symbols for ambiguous verbal symbols removes without analysis all ambiguity seems to be the major article of Mr. Burke's naive methodological faith. The positive findings yielded may best be summed up in the author's own words: " In the first place they show the inadequacy of the received or accepted molecular theory in its present form, of the atomic and electron hypothesis without extrapolation, to explain the mechanism of germ-plasm, nay, that it is not only insufficient but that it cannot do so. In the second place we are led to put in its place the hypothesis of monads, such as Leib- niz supposed, without, however, making use of the principle of pre-estab- lished harmony. Room is thus made for evolution as a necessary outcome of the new Idealism. And in the third we have recourse to the principle of 'time change-waves-' as applied to the monadology and epistemology, in relation to the theory of emergence of both life and mind in the so-called material Universe. We are in touch with Reality itself as an Idea, and know the world and each other as Ideas in the presence of this great Reality" (pp. 388 f.). The argument upon which these conclusions are based is disjointed and repetitious, and for sheer sustained ambiguity the work has few rivals in Anglo-American philosophy. Errors abound, both minor misunderstandings and major confusions concerning fundamental issues. It is unfortunate that the author's zeal and energy should have been so hopelessly misdirected. One can but voice the faint hope that his example will impress upon others the futility of constructing grandiose syntheses that do not rest upon careful and rigorous analyses. ALBERT E. BLUMBERG THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY</page><page sequence="6">No. 2.] DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 237 The Scientific Outlook. By BERTRAND RUSSELL. New York, W. W. Norton and Company, i93i. Pp. 278. To measure the human significance of science we must consider the nature and scope of scientific knowledge, the increasing power of manipulation de- rived from scientific technique, and the resultant changes in social life and institutions. Hope for the future depends upon the formation of a new moral outlook characterized by "respect for what is best in man". H. R. SMART CORNELL UNIVERSITY The Use of the Self. By F. MATTHIAs ALEXANDER. With an Introduction by JOHN DEWEY. New York, E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., i932. Pp. xix, i43. This is an account of the investigations leading to the formulation of the author's technique for the control of human behavior and is illustrated by definite case-studies. Operating on the basic principle that the human organ- ism is an indivisible unity, he has gradually perfected a plan which appeals to the constant exercise of intelligence to provide the means for satisfac- torily regulating conduct. While the merit of insisting on the importance of continuous self-criticism is not solely Mr. Alexander's, a method of procedure is not usually so definitely outlined and at the same time related to an acceptable principle. The technique has great importance for educa- tional and medical practice, so long as the primary aim of conscious con- trol is not subordinated to a highly formalized procedure, but extension of the plan to large groups is likely to result in another form of lock-step education. WILLIAM H. REITHER THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY The Political Philosophy of Confucianism. By LEONARD SHIHLIEN HsfU. New York, E. P. Dutton and Company, i932. Pp. xxii, 258. The author, who is professor of social theory at Yenching University, has attempted two things: to present systematically the political ideas con- tained in Confucianism and to show that these ideas have a present-day im- portance for a political philosophy. The two purposes continually get in each other's way. An effort is certainly made to use sources critically-for example, to discriminate documents of different dates-with what success the reviewer is not competent to say. Interpretation of the source-material consists largely of paraphrasing aphorisms with modern terminology. If words like nationalism, sovereignty, democracy, representation, and evo- lution, are used in any usual current sense, they must, it seems, mean something which Confucius could not have intended; if they are used to translate Confucius, their modern meanings must be hopelessly vague. In Confucius one catches a glimpse of a long-vanished social organization- an almost static agricultural society, with a village economy and handicraft</page><page sequence="7">238 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLII. industry, with a well-marked order of social and political precedence, and governed by a highly developed code of customary morality. With this goes an appropriate moral philosophy: the badness of breaking status, the duty of nobresse oblige, the right of every man to the privileges of his station, the beauties of harmony, and the perfections of an ideal ruler. This is all quite intelligible; indeed, it is very similar to some phases of medieval political philosophy in Europe when European society was not so very dif- ferent. No doubt the study of Confucius is as profitable as the study of the Christian sages, but do we learn anything by tricking either of them out in modern sociological jargon? GEORGE H. SABINE CORNELL UNIVERSITY Der philosophische Gehaclt der religlisen Dogmatik. Von C. A. EMGE. Mfinchen, E. Reinhardt, i929. PP. I53. The subtitle of this work, "-;' Prolegomena zu einer wahren Theologie", does not inspire confidence. Though by a professor of philosophy and law at the University at Jena, it appears to me of little interest to the technical philosopher. Dr. Emge takes the dogmas of orthodox Christianity and endeavors to express their significance in terms analogous to those of Hegelianism. The volume is one of logical abstractions, paying no attention to modern investigations into the historical development of Christian dogmas or to their psychological interpretation. In consequence it is of doubtful relevance to modern thought on the subject with which it deals. ALBAN G. Winx;RY DUKE UNIVERSITY Le genie des religions. Par BARON DESCAMPS. Paris, F. Alcan, ig30. Pp. xxii, 539. This is an augmented and revised edition of a book first published in I928 the vigor and clarity of which fully justified the favorable reception it received. Dr. Descamps writes from a standpoint which he describes as rational realism. His attitude resembles that of Roman Catholic Neo- Scholasticism, as may be seen in his criticisms of idealism and of the philosophy of Kant. After an exposition of the main outlines of his epis- temology, dependent on the ideas of reason related with the data of ex- perience, he surveys the development of religion in the progressive integra- tion of these two factors in knowledge. As contrasted with Chateaubriand's account of " le genie du Christianisme" based on its aesthetic content, the author professes to investigate " le genie des religions " from the standpoint of empirical science. He makes especial use of the comparative method, surveying the contributions of anthropology, prehistoric archeology, linguistic paleontology, and ethnology. Nevertheless a large part of the volume con- sists of discussions of the existence of God and of human freedom suggest-</page><page sequence="8">No.2.] DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 239 ive of the treatment of such subjects in the traditional Catholic manuals on natural theology. For its literary style and its attempt at a synthesis of ideas from different sciences the volume deserves attention, but it makes no significant contribution to the study of religion. ALBAN G. WiDGERY DUKE UNIVERSITY The Song of God. Translation of the Bhagavad Gita. By DHAN GoPAL MuTji. New York, E. P. Dutton and Co., i93i. Pp. xxi, i66. A new translation attempting to present the Gita, not word for word, nor in any particular poetic rhythm, but in such a way as to convey the spiritual moods it invokes in Hindus. Each verse or closely united pair of verses is printed apart from the preceding and following, in order that it may be more readily meditated upon and that the spiritual symbolism it is held to carry may come more easily to mind without being interfered with by the meaning of the story. Its function is devotional, not narrative. A. E. AvEy THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY The Thirteen Principal Upanishads. Translated from the Sanskrit, with an Outline of the Philosophy of the Upanishads and an Annotated Bib- liography, by R. E. HUME. Second edition, revised. Oxford University Press, i93i. Pp. xvi, 588. A new edition of Professor Hume's well-known work, with minor correc- tions, addition of recent publications to the bibliography, and an appendix by Dr. G. C. 0. Haas containing a list of recurrent and parallel passages. The page-numbers remain identical with those of the first edition, a wel- come feature to those who have notes and references based upon the first. It is the most readable of English translations of the Upanishads. The eleven introductory chapters on the fundamental conceptions of Hindu mysticism and the place of these writings in philosophy are the best summary available in English. A. E.
