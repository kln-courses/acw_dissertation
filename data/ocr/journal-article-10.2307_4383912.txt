<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Return of Robinson Jeffers He shuddered briefly and stared down the long valley where the headland rose And the lean gum trees rattled in the wind above Point Sur; Alive, he had littered the mind's coast With ghosts of Indians and granite and the dead fleshed Bodies of desire. That work was done And, whether done well or not, it had occupied him As the hawks and the sea were occupied. Now he could not say what brought him back. He had imagined resurrection once: the lover of a woman Who lived lonely in a little ranch house up the ridge Came back, dragged from the grave by her body's need To feel under ashen cloud-skies and in the astonishments Of sunrise some truth beyond the daily lie Of feeding absolute hunger the way a young girl might trap meadow mice To feed a red-tailed hawk she kept engaged. She wanted to die once As the sun dies in pure fire on the farthest sea-swells. She had had enough and more of nights when the brain Flickered and dissolved its little constellations and the nerves Performed their dumb show in the dark among the used human smells of bedsheets. So she burned and he came, a ghost in khaki and stunned skin, And she fled with him. He had imagined, though he had not written, The later moment in the pasture, in moonlight like pale stone, When she lay beside him with an after-tenderness in all her bones, Having become entirely what she was, though aware that the thing Beside her was, again, just so much cheese-soft flesh And jellied eye rotting in the pools of bone. Anguish afterwards perhaps, but he had not thought afterwards. Human anguish made him cold. He told himself the cries of men in war were no more conscious No less savage than the shrill repetitions of the Steller's jay Flashing through live oaks up Mal Paso Canyon And that the oaks, rooted and growing toward their grace, Were-as species go- More beautiful. 2 He had given himself to stone gods. I imagine him thinking of that woman While a live cloud of gulls Plumes the wind behind a trawler Throbbing toward the last cannery at Monterey. The pelicans are gone which had, wheeling, Written Chinese poems on the sea. The grebes are gone That feasted on the endless hunger of the flashing runs Of salmon. And I imagine that he saw, finally, That though rock stands, it does not breed. He feels specific rage. Feels, obscurely, that his sex Is his, not god-force only, but is his own soft flesh grown thick With inconsolable desire. The grebes are gone. He feels a plain man's elegiac tenderness, An awkward brotherhood with the world's numb poor His poems had despised. Rage and tenderness are pain. He feels pain as rounding at the hips, as breasts. Pain blossoms in his belly like the first dark Stirrings of a child, a surfeit of the love that he had bled to rock And twisted into cypress haunts above the cliffs. He knows he has come back to mourn, To grieve, womanish, a hundred patient years Along this fragile coast. I imagine the sky's arch, Cloud-swift, lifts him then, all ache in sex and breasts, Beyond the leached ashes of dead fire, The small jeweled hunger in the seabird's eye. -Robert Hass (Reprinted, by kind permission of the publisher, from Field Guide by Robert Hass, ? copyright 1973, Yale University Press.)

R OBINSON JEFFERS appears to be a poet other poets chastize elo- quently. That is: the inducement to lit- erary reprimand is in proportion to the stakes: the grander, the more funda- mental the objection, the more inviting the project. The remarkable poems of this little genre, Milosz's and Hass's, are devoid of flamboyant condescension, at least insofar as the living can avoid flaunting their ongoing development at the immobile dead. "So brave in a void/ you offered sacrifices to demons": so Milosz addresses Jeffers. If not exactly tribute, this is nevertheless a particular species of reproach: giant to giant. The reprimand is moral: at issue is humanity, the definition thereof. And Jeffers' crime, in Milosz's poem, "to proclaim...an inhuman thing." Hass concurs, pretty much, though his for- mulation changes the emphasis, focus- ing on causes: "human anguish made him cold." What's odd to me is that Jeffers in all his hardness and obstinate fixity and dogmatic revulsions is, of the three, the most poignantly, albeit cheerlessly, human. I read Milosz in translation, which makes discussion of tone problematic. And yet, at issue in his poem to Jeffers is the placement of the speaker relative to his subjects and, in fact, Milosz speaks as a diplomat, an envoy, his mis- sion being to explain, or represent, one form of paganism to another. The paganism he defends is maternal. Earth centered. Moon centered. Fruitful. Predictable. Cyclical. This is the same fecund earth Hass reveres. Both approve it as the wise man approves woman, radiant in otherness. Homage to the source, the root, but homage paid, in Milosz, by someone well beyond primi- tive gesturing. The mathematical equivalent of fem- inine earth is multiplication: increase, whatever its metaphoric manifestation, seems inherently life-affirming. Whereas the corresponding, the declared meta- phor for Jeffers' earth, the "massive mysticism of stone," is elimination: a dead end, presumably. Hass puts all this more eloquently: "though rock stands it does not breed." He sees the lure of rock but names its spiritual danger: sterility. To stand, to not breed, is to be finally inhuman, and, pragmatically, not lasting: the future of the species is more profitably assured through reproduction than through en- durance. In Hass's mind, mutability, not fixity, sponsors ongoing existence. And yet the manner in which Jeffers espouses rock is immensely human: exposed, rash, extreme, vulnerable. Rigid, where Hass and Milosz are lithe-minded, evolved. Jeffers writes out of enraged, disap- pointed romanticism: civilized in his expectations, he cannot forgive civiliza- tion in that it wasn't worth his faith. This can seem, to a reader, cumulatively trying: repetition deprives a last stand of its dramatic force. Whereas Hass characteristically re- sists resolution: a mark of intellect, but also a temperamental inclination which can create its own form of stasis, in that it lacks not motion but momentum. Hass hates disappointment, hates being imprisoned in its continuing and limited range of attitudes, of tones: rue, regret, plangent lament. When Hass sighs in Praise he does so with a kind of savage fury, constrained by perspective, by habitual poise; in these moments, he comes closest to being what Milosz has always been, since to write as an ancient soul is to write as an ironist (the alter- native, I suppose, being to sing the purest and briefest of lyrics-). Hass's method of poetic development has always been exposure: he uses his empathetic capacity to extend his range. Though he is not, I think, at home in irony (unless there is irony in the Buddha's composure), he has most certainly, as Milosz's translator, been exposed to its most subtle and resource- ful practitioner. Hass and Milosz have in common astounding intellectual gifts and the vir- tuoso's mastery of tone which contrives to endow natural speech with a some- times unbelievable iubtext of reso"' nances. But the sources of flexibility dif- fer: Milosz's detachment differs from Hass's empathy, as irony is distinct from ambivalence. It will be interesting to see whether EHass ripens into the sort of poet Milosz is: ironic, but with an irony by turns delicate, malicious, passionate, judg- mental, tender. He already has Milosz's 360-degree gaze, as opposed to Jeffers' fixity. Jeffers' ferocity is alien to Hass; his landscapes less so. Like Jeffers, Hass is attracted to the absence of the human. There have been, from the first, counter- parts in Hass to Jeffers' harsh, unpopu- lated world. And this is an aspect of the work even in Field Guide, even before human presence or human agency come to be characterized as that contaminat- ing "steady thoughtlessness." But where Jeffers' imagination settles on rock and hawk, Hass gives us frog and pond, a bowl of oranges. Into these worlds, human beings, men and women, come as intrusions. Most poets are, in Frost's phrase, acquainted with the night. Hass is unique in having inhabited, as an adult, a sunlit world. Exiled from Eden, he's like the man who's always been healthy and gets sick: when the amazement passes, he simply can't stand feeling this way. And the tonal problem of Praise, the collection that registers this change, is to avoid petulant irritability. The earlier work, "The Return of Robinson Jeffers," is built around a move typical of Hass's work, early and late, an extended enactment of empathy. Hass imagines Jeffers' return from death: "I imagine him thinking...": so 12THE THREEPENNY REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">the meditation starts. Hass's projected epiphany curiously duplicates Milosz's bias (or, rather, this is not curious, since they address the same figure, the same perceived limitation). Jeffers, in Hass's imagination, "...feels pain as rounding at the hips, as breasts." And the form re-education takes is the birth of femi- nine empathy and suffering to replace male arrogance. It is either very touching, very femi- nine (on this grid) or extremely arrogant that Hass prefers to imagine these reve- lations as occurring to Jeffers himself, while at the same time refusing to aban- don his position as narrating, as spon- soring intelligence: the epiphany occurs in Hass's imagination. The fact is, Hass has learned much from Jeffers. Or, there are tastes in common: the long, rhyth- mic, complicated sentences, with subse- quent sentences beginning on a repeated phrase, like a thread picked up in a complex tapestry, so that one is always aware of, always hearing the human voice (the danger of complex syntax being that voice will be lost and, with it, intimacy, directness). The similarities are, in any case, easy to hear, for all the difference in ambiance: ".... what a fes- tival for the seafowl./What a witches' sabbath of wings/Hides the water." That's Jeffers, but Hass has moments very like. What Hass does, what no one else now writing does with such skill, is a kind of spiritual ventriloquism: he is able to project not voice merely but a whole sensibility. On the surface, this resembles Keats's ideas of negative capa- bility; in fact, it differs profoundly from Keats, in motive and effect. Always Keats's excursions conclude, and the act of conclusion marks a restoration of self. This is the romantic journey: it might be, it can be imagined, it is not. Hass may assert the fact of limitation, but limitation does not seem to be an attribute of the voice. And the romantic sound is not one Hass seems especially eager to make. His poems are, regularly, a flight from self; what they lack, when they lack anything, is a sense of the restrictions of self, of singleness, which perception necessitates acts of judg- ment, decision, assertion of priorities. His poems repudiate self in its romantic role: bedrock, shaping principle. It is appropriate that Jeffers attracts moral criticism: he is himself, in the manner of the darker prophets, obsessed with morality. At stake is the salvation of the race. Always he hungers after large simplicities: "Why does insanity always twist the great answers?/ Because only/tormented persons want the truth." As for mankind in general: "Truly men hate the truth; they'd liefer/Meet a tiger in the road." He built into his poems the romance of not being lis- tened to. He wanted not to be coddled; often, he seems to try to see humankind without human bias, aspiring not to the communal "cordiality and affection" but to the isolated falcon's "(r)ealistic eyes and act." The "act," for the artist, was not sim- ply to see, but also to judge. The aes- thetic that refuses judgment forfeits, for Jeffers, moral density. Thus the Chinese anthology: "These men were better/ Artists than any of ours, and far better observers. They loved landscape/And put man in his place. But why/Do their rocks have no weight? They loved rice- wine and peace and friendship,/Above all they loved landscape and solitude,/ -like Wordsworth. But Wordsworth's mountains have weight and mass, dull though the song be." The Chinese poets share certain of Jeffers' biases, but they refuse to substi- tute speculations on the eternal for fas- tidious notation of the temporal. If, for Jeffers, they do not satisfy, at least they do not commit the more dangerous er- rors of self-delusion which occur pri- marily in the moral or spiritual spheres. As both reader and writer, Jeffers wants what "only tormented persons want"; he is correspondingly suspicious of com- fort, of the distractions of pleasure. He despises those spiritual or ethical sys- tems which encourage self-forgiveness; it may be this adamant horror of mercy to which Milosz particularly objects. The anthropomorphic impulse which, in his address to Jeffers, Milosz com- mends produces life-enhancing miracles which seem the substance, or confirma- tion, of "grace and hope"; it is this im- pulse that makes domestic realities potentially the site of the divine: "Then, under the apple trees/Angels in homespun linen will come parting the boughs..." So ravishingly tender is the image as to make one forget that human culture is not, in fact, so wholly benign. But Jef- fers' struggle has been to see the sun without an intervening image, not as a "farmer's ruddy face"; his vanity is to believe in the possibility. Jeffers' poems do not "implore protection"-to be pro- tected is to not see, and Jeffers makes a cult of exposure-even as they regularly confess helplessness, despair. Jeffers wants to see the world with a gaze ap- proximating the falcon's "realistic" one; what Jeffers calls "realistic" Milosz sees as "inhuman." "No one with impunity/gives himself the eyes of a god," Milosz says. Clarity is not within human capability. And yet the preference for clarity over solace and the clumsy striving toward it is, in Jeffers, both moving and honorable. If Jeffers was brave "in a void" it was in part because he rejected the conditions of the "white kolkhoz tablecloth": his vanity was his vision of himself in rela- tion to a single truth, but there are other and dangerous vanities, intolerances: the tribe's automatic allegiance to itself, for example. "Cordiality and affection" exclude those who do not participate in the social contract. Jeffers lived in a terrifying time; it was not his nature to seek tolerable arrangements despite the world's state. Nor could he pray to the available pro- jections; he did not find the world bet- ter for its religions. For Jeffers, the cen- tral fact of the founders of these reli- gions is their inflamed humanity: Here was a man who was born a bastard, and among the people That more than any in the world valued race-purity, chastity, the prophetic splendors of the race of David. Oh intolerable wound, dimly perceived. Too loving to curse his mother, desert driven, devil haunted, The beautiful young poet found truth in the desert, but found also Fantastic solution of hopeless anguish. The carpenter was not his father? Because God was his father, Not a man sinning, but the pure holiness and power of God. His personal anguish and insane solution Have stained an age; nearly two thousand years are one vast poem drunk with the wine of his blood. In his stubborn, desperate way, Jeffers sought a plausible and sustaining vision, sought it explicitly outside the human circle, but sought it with an unremittingly human yearning. He wanted to find something in the world which was not corrupt, not the product of corruption: I think, here is your emblem To hang in the future sky; Not the cross, not the hive, But this; bright power, dark peace; Fierce consciousness joined with final Disinterestedness; Life with calm death; the falcon's Realistic eyes and act Married to the massive Mysticism of stone, Which failure cannot cast down Nor success make proud. O To Robinson Jeffers If you have not read the Slavic poets so much the better. There's nothing there for a Scotch-Irish wanderer to seek. They lived in a childhood prolonged from age to age. For them, the sun was a farmer's ruddy face, the moon peeped through a cloud and the Milky Way gladdened them like a birch-lined road. They longed for the Kingdom which is always near, always right at hand. Then, under apple trees angels in homespun linen will come parting the boughs and at the white kolkhoz tablecloth cordiality and affection will feast (falling to the ground at times). And you are from surf-rattled skerries. From the heaths where burying a warrior they broke his bones so he could not haunt the living. From the sea night which your forefathers pulled over themselves, without a word. Above your head no face, neither the sun's nor the moon's, only the throbbing of galaxies, the immutable violence of new beginnings, of new destruction. All your life listening to the ocean. Black dinosaurs wade where a purple zone of phosphorescent weeds rises and falls on the waves as in a dream. And Agamemnon sails the boiling deep to the steps of the palace to have his blood gush onto marble. Till mankind passes and the pure and stony earth is pounded by the ocean. Thin-lipped, blue-eyed, without grace or hope, before God the Terrible, body of the world. Prayers are not heard. Basalt and granite. Above them, a bird of prey. The only beauty. What have I to do with you? From footpaths in the orchards, from an untaught choir and shimmers of a moonstrance, from flower beds of rue, hills by the rivers, books in which a zealous Lithuanian announced brotherhood, I come. Oh, consolations of mortals, futile creeds. And yet you did not know what I know. The earth teaches More than does the nakedness of elements. No one with impunity gives to himself the eyes of a god. So brave, in a void, you offered sacrifices to demons: there were Wotan and Thor, the screech of Erinyes in the air, the terror of dogs when Hekate with her retinue of the dead draws near. Better to carve suns and moons on the joints of crosses as was done in my district. To birches and firs give feminine names. To implore protection against the mute and treacherous might than to proclaim, as you did, an inhuman thing. -Czeslaw Milosz (translated by the author and Richard Lourie) (Reprinted, by kind permission of the Ecco Press, from The Collected Poems, 1931-1987 by Czeslaw Milosz, ? copyright 1988 by Czeslaw Milosz Royalties, Inc.)
