In this chapter I discuss each of these sources in an effort to identify  the elements that may be traced to Congolese spiritual traditions and those  pertaining to Christian theology as appropriated by the Kimbanguist Church. The conflicts that historically pitted Protestants and Catholics against  one another in Europe were also present in the process of the Christian- ization of Africans. Among the theological principles elaborated by Martin  Luther, the Bible was redefined as the sole authority in matters of faith,  so that its propagation entailed the free interpretation of the scriptures by  believers. This principle, which antagonized Catholics in Europe, irritated  them even more when applied to Africans, as is shown by the reaction  of Father Alexandre Brou, who was scandalized to witness in Protestant  congregations in the late nineteenth century an emerging African prophe- tism resulting from an exaltation of individual judgment, which he found  unrestrained. Since the converts could access the Bible freely to interpret  it under the Holy Spirit’s guidance, “the books of the Prophets, the Revela- tions, and even the Gospels become guides for anarchy. Worse, the corrupt  form of Christianity which has been preached to them, devoid of any sacra- mental life, is finally powerless to destroy the seeds of paganism which all  blacks carry, as it were, in their blood.”1 </page> <page sequence="4"> 84   kimbanguism and the bible Biased as it is, this analysis nevertheless raises the question of the level  of understanding of the Bible by the Congolese people to whom it was  preached. Father Brou saw the Protestant dogma of the free interpretation  of the scriptures as a source of heresy. Kimbanguism is entirely in keeping  with this Protestant tradition, all the more so because the Bible was placed  quite early in the hands of Congolese converts. Father Van Wing stated that  the Kongo people were Christianized from 1881 to 1921 exclusively by Prot- estant missions belonging to the “evangelical” category, which recognizes  no final magisterium in matters of doctrine, for the Bible is the ultimate  authority, which every believer interprets by the light received directly from  the Holy Spirit.2 Such was the basis for the training of the pastors and  catechists, who were sent by these missions into the villages to spread the  gospel and preside over the worship services there. In keeping with this Protestant tradition, in which Kimbangu was edu- cated, the Bible is freely interpreted by believers and studied more or less  in depth. Van Wing, noting that Kimbangu “constantly had a copy [of the  Bible] in his hand,” asked rhetorical questions about Protestant mission- aries’ reactions to Kimbangu’s preaching: “From what moral standpoint  could they have blamed him for explaining the Word of God in his own  way, since for them, personal interpretation is the only rule and basis of a  person’s faith?”3 Likewise, Father Brou pointed out that Kimbangu distrib- uted Bibles.4 Significantly, Kimbangu recommended the daily reading of the Bible  shortly before he was arrested: “The Spirit has revealed to me that the time  has come now for me to surrender myself to the authorities. I will leave  you nothing but the Bible. Read it at all times and in all places, and put  God’s Commandments into practice unfailingly.”5 A legend about Kim- bangu’s childhood mentions an undefined being, neither Black nor White,  who appeared to him with a Bible in his hand and said, “This is a good  book. You must read it and proclaim its contents.”6 This episode suggests  that Kimbangu received the Bible not from White missionaries, but directly  from a supernatural being removed from any situation of racial oppression.  Consequently, in the Kimbanguist Church, the Bible is the essential holy  book. Kimbanguists refer to it as mokanda ya bomoyi, a Lingala phrase that  means “the book of life.” They recognize it as the product of divine revela- tion and as the definitive source of fundamental truths from the beginning  to the end of time. The Bible is also the inspiration behind the church’s  liturgy—for the blessing of infants, baptisms, weddings, and the Holy Sup- per. It is perceived as a sacred text, the expression of God’s word, and as the  </page> <page sequence="5"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   85 history of God’s relation with the children of Israel, on the one hand, and  with Black people, on the other. Yet it may be observed that in the Kimbanguist religion, the Bible has  been voided of its Middle Eastern and Western content and adjusted to the  believers’ identity reconstruction process. As Balandier explained, “resort- ing to the Bible allows utopian constructions and the belief in the salvation  of the Black race under the guidance of prophets who are also the founders  of the churches.”7 Educated pastors and church members, however, see it  as an imported text; in an exhortation, the spiritual leader Diangienda said:  “We  aren’t the ones who wrote the Bible. It was in response to Jesus’ rec- ommendation ‘Go and turn all the pagan nations into Christian ones’ that  Westerners came and brought us the Bible. But now, let us no longer per- ceive it as something imported, but embrace it as something which belongs  to us.”8 It is clear that while he was aware of the significance of the Bible,  that is not necessarily the case for a majority of his followers. Kimbanguists do not simply consider the Bible to be a source of ser- mons. It involves them in a critical process of ethnic self-i dentification by  redeeming them from the never- ending present in which Africans have  been trapped by those who believe them to be outside of history. Instead,  Kimbanguists carve a place for themselves in all the time periods and spaces  of the Bible, from the garden of Eden to the desert of Sodom and Gomorrah  to Mount Sinai. The Kimbanguist psyche is thus shaped within the spatial-  temporal framework of the Bible insofar as biblical stories are perceived as  actual rather than mythical. Kimbanguists are metaphorically immersed  in the Bible, which ensures the continuity of their present and affects the  interpretation of their future. This also leads Kimbanguist believers to con- sciously or unconsciously distort the history of Israel. Since the Bible is the book where a single origin is given to humankind  and since readers are encouraged to decipher signs and symbols, Kimban- guists feel called to give meaning to the words of the text and, in so doing,  justify their social or religious activities and buttress their sense of ethnic- ity. Maurice Dorès pointed out that “Africans reading the Bible recognize  in it a familiar world where each past generation is entitled to being named  at length,”9 and Kimbanguists find in the Bible a space for dialogue, con- ducive to an exchange or a discussion whose subject is within reach of  all believers, encouraging them to individually examine and interpret the  word. This opens up a space for participation,10 which shapes the relation  between preacher and audience as well as conferences and moral lectures.  MacGaffey noted that the basic tenets of Kimbanguism are often taken for  </page> <page sequence="6"> 86   kimbanguism and the bible granted: “Kimbanguists appear to have no idea that any other interpreta- tion of the Bible is possible than the one they put upon it.”11 For Kimbanguists, the Bible offers a comparative opportunity, linking  past events with present-d ay facts and informing their faith. It is used as  a reference book or dictionary, which gives the interpretation and justifi- cation of particular beliefs or practices of the Kimbanguist Church. For  instance, Exodus is read as a harbinger of Simon Kimbangu’s liberating  the Congolese from the Belgian colonial yoke, while the episode of David  and Goliath is noted by several authors as having been Kimbangu’s favor- ite biblical passage, for his community saw him as David and the colonial  authorities as Goliath. In this way, the Bible as perceived by the Kimban- guists provides Black people with a history and a collective memory, and  gives believers the ideological wherewithal for the reconstruction of their  identity. Their individual and collective existences take place in the space  and time of the Bible, as if Kimbanguism were part and parcel of biblical  episodes as they happened in the past and—in believers’ eyes—as they con- tinue happening. Contrary to the colonizers’ opinion that Africans are inherently heathen,  Kimbanguist believers do not acknowledge their background as pagan.  They do not identify the God of the Bible as being solely the God of Israel,  but their own as well—the one they have always called Nzambi a Mpungu  (God Almighty). He is not simply the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob but  is the God of Simon Kimbangu’s three sons. Hence, the mission of the cho- sen people becomes Kimbanguists’ own, and reading the Bible helps them  connect biblical passages to the events informing Kimbanguist religious  life and activities; believers use the scriptures while situating the teachings  in their own cultural context and history. The way Kimbanguists read the biblical message helps them construct  their own racial identity, in keeping with the doctrine of Blackness as an  affirmation of the self against White domination. They do not understand  the Bible as a text from the past, but see it also from the present and the  future. The historical and geographical landmarks of the Bible are sym- bolically erased, removing it from its Middle Eastern locales and tempo- ralities and injecting its message into Kimbanguists’ history and daily life.  It is assumed that the Bible always has something to tell them, or it has  something that they should tell others. For instance, 1992 was a year of  grief for all Kimbanguists: in the span of four months, they lost two of  the sons of Simon Kimbangu. First, Kisolokele, the eldest, who had acted  as the first deputy of the spiritual leader, passed away on March 17, and  </page> <page sequence="7"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   87 then Diangienda, the youngest and the main spiritual leader, died on July  8. These deaths were interpreted through the lens of the passages from the  book of Revelation (11:3–4 and 7–10) that mention two “witnesses” whose  corpses lay exposed for three days and a half while the crowds rejoiced. In 1990, before these actual deaths, a rumor had spread around Kin- shasa announcing the death of Diangienda; the news had caused much  rejoicing among the inhabitants of the capital. It is difficult to document  the social climate of the times, since the civil war and pillaging destroyed  many archives. Yet a press conference given by Diangienda in 1990 gives  insight into the context. A Zairian journalist asked, “Eminence—for us Afri- cans, death is synonymous with sadness and mourning. Why have people  celebrated and danced on hearing you had passed away?”12 This question  reveals the atmosphere of the times. When Diangienda actually died two  years later, the people of Kinshasa celebrated again. One of Diangienda’s  nephews later described it in the following terms: “I met a crowd of excited  people, dancing, drinking, and yelling, ‘We did it!’ I asked a young man  what was going on, and he told me, ‘Elder brother, rejoice! We are relieved,  this man has died.’ . . . He was talking about Papa Diangienda. This is how  I learned of my father’s death.”13 The church’s press service covered the two spiritual leaders’ funerals;  the film indeed shows the inhabitants of Kinshasa rejoicing, verbally abus- ing Diangienda’s memory, and throwing stones at his funeral procession.  For some Kimbanguists, this was the fulfillment of the biblical prophecy.  I heard sermons that stressed the passage from Revelation mentioned  above. Indeed, the dead bodies of Kisolokele and Diangienda were actually  exposed to the public in Kinshasa for three and a half days each before their  burials in Nkamba. Were the funerals shaped by the biblical passage so that  they would coincide with the prophecy? Undeniably, Revelation is often  read through the prism of Kimbanguist reality. For example, one informant  said that Dialungana, the last surviving son of Kimbangu and the successor  of his dead brothers, had verse 14 of the same passage read aloud shortly  after he took over leadership of the church: “The second woe is past; and,  behold, the third woe cometh quickly.” This “third woe” occurred nine  years after the first two, in August 2001, when Dialungana’s death ended  the era of the three sons of Kimbangu and ushered in that of the twenty- six  grandchildren. Because two of the grandchildren were absent on the day of Dialungana’s  funeral, there were twenty- four of them gathered to designate the next spir- itual leader of the church. Simon Kimbangu Kiangani, Dialungana’s eldest  </page> <page sequence="8"> 88   kimbanguism and the bible son, was chosen while the other grandchildren proclaimed themselves dep- uty spiritual leaders. In the believers’ theological analysis, this event was  blended with that of Revelation 4:4: “And round about the throne were four  and twenty seats; and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting.”  Below, I show how, through the Bible, the Kimbanguist Church searches its  own memory—mythical though it may be—and finds the elements needed  for its identity reconstruction. The Kimbanguist method of interpretation  of the Bible was defined by Diangienda, whose preaching constitutes one of  the sources—if not the essential source—of Kimbanguist theology. In the Kimbanguist faith, scriptures must be supplemented by the spiri- tual messages delivered by Kimbangu’s three sons, particularly Diang ienda,  who was the supreme authority while he was alive. As Marie-L ouise Martin  explained, “Kimbangu’s sons have the highest rank in the hierarchy of the  church, and all important decisions must be approved by them. The three  are united and have been called princes héritiers (hereditary princes), or in  Kikongo zimvwala, i.e., bearers of the prophetic and royal staff or scepter.  The term can mean that prophetic and royal functions are theirs within the  church. The highest position is accorded to Joseph Diangienda.”14 Likewise,  the French Africanist Jean-C laude Froelich observed: “Joseph Dian gienda  alone is responsible for the movement’s shift from an initially highly revo- lutionary and anti- white organization to a clearly and deeply religious one.  He kept the basis of Baptist teachings and mingled them with his father’s  revelations: it is thus a highly Africanized Protestant church, but with a  modernist and even Western streak.”15  Born on March 22, 1918, Diangienda was relegated after his father’s  arrest in 1921 to the Catholic colony of Boma with his elder brother, Kis- olokele (then seven years old), to be reeducated in the Catholic faith. There,  he was baptized in the Catholic Church and became an altar boy. In 1937,  he was hired as a civil servant in the office of the governor of the province of  Kasai. Diangienda resigned in 1957 to help his mother, Marie Muilu, con- tinue Kimbangu’s work. He succeeded her as the leader of the movement  upon her death on April 27, 1959. It is considered blasphemous in the Kimbanguist Church to speak of  Kimbangu’s three sons as separate entities, for they are believed to repre- sent the Holy Trinity. Yet Diangienda was undeniably the most charismatic  and the dearest to the hearts of the church members. The three are col- lectively designated as “the papas,” though each has a specific title—Papa  Kulutu (“elder father”) for Kisolokele; Papa Mfumu a Mbanza (“the father at  the head of the city of Nkamba”) for Dialungana; and Papa Mfumu a Longo  </page> <page sequence="9"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   89 (“the father who is the spiritual leader”) for Diangienda. People also use  just “Papa” to refer to Diangienda,16 who called Simon Kimbangu “Papa.” Since Diangienda was the custodian of the Kimbanguist faith and commu- nity order, his words delineate the symbolic boundaries whose maintenance  and reproduction imply the power to forbid and curse, but also elucidate the  master- disciple, teacher- student, and deity- believer relations. His preaching  is not only listened to but also interpreted and analyzed through the prism  of the congregants’ expectations and beliefs. This exchange may, depending  on the circumstances, take place as a unilateral or dialogical transmission  of knowledge within the space of a participative ritual or in a face-t o- face  meeting, but nonverbal communication is also taken into account because  charisma is everywhere present in this movement of total interaction.  Fully aware of his own image in the eyes of the community, Diangienda  tried to include himself in the Kimbanguist “we” in spite of his special sta- tus as Kimbangu’s son and his own spiritual power, including the miracles  he worked. Indeed, it is not uncommon to hear people say, “Papa told me,”  “I saw Papa making this miracle,” “I heard people say that Papa had done  or said this in this place,” “I dreamed that Papa told me,” “I had a vision in  which Papa showed me,” and so on. While the relation between scripture  and tradition is considered to be one of the major points separating Catho- lics and Protestants—the former ranking scripture second to the tradition  of the fathers of the church, while the latter consider scripture second to  none—the Kimbanguist Church, although seen as a branch of Protestant- ism, subordinates scripture to the tradition embodied by the preaching of  Diangienda. One often sees biblical passages attributed to him in the fol- lowing way: “in chapter x, line y, Papa says.” Although Kimbanguists hold the Bible to be sacred, it may be criticized;  inspired hymns—the third source of Kimbanguist theology—may be  doubted or even rejected; but Papa is deemed infallible by everyone in the  Kimbanguist Church. Anyone who dares criticize him or doubt his words,  or his brothers’, runs the risk of being labeled an anti-K imbanguist sor- cerer. Even the notion of a “third testament” is not ruled out. When asked  whether the Kimbanguist Church was in the process of writing another  testament, the pastor Lulendo Lua Nzambi, the national secretary of the  church in Congo-B razzaville, answered: “That’s exactly it. It is the third  testament, that of the Holy Spirit, which doesn’t exist yet, whose entire  story is still unknown to us and which is still being written, just as the  testament of the Son was long combated and was only accepted after Jesus  had to die for it.”17 </page> <page sequence="10"> 90   kimbanguism and the bible Diangienda’s prophetic preaching still is the most important source of  Kimbanguist theology. This vast body of oral sermons is considered to be  a sacred legacy and is integrated with the interpretation of both the Bible  and the inspired hymns, so that it has become the recognizable voice and  collective memory of the community. These sermons, delivered in French,  Kikongo, Kituba, or, most frequently, Lingala and taped during services help  to reveal the past, interpret the present, and announce the future. Diangienda  never relied on any written text, except when quoting from the Bible, and he  spoke as a prophet. He would often stare at the sky as if deciphering mes- sages, which led the audience to listen in awe and rapt silence. His joy would  trigger the audience’s exultation, his laughter their own, his weeping theirs,  and his anger the atonement of congregants, who often threw themselves  at his feet, flat on their bellies. His preaching, which addressed both visible  and invisible dimensions, reflected an identity that was itself a mystery to his  community. His main source of inspiration was the Bible, but jointly, with an  invisible person—his own father, Kimbangu—mirroring the way Jesus spoke  of the Holy Spirit in John 16:13–14: “when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he  will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever  he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He  shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.” Hence, when Diangienda said, “Papa told me,” “I’ll ask permission from  my father,” or “Papa showed me,” people inevitably inferred he was still  in contact with his father, even after Kimbangu had been dead for several  decades. In one prayer addressed to his father, Diangienda spoke the fol- lowing words: “Concerning our country, you showed me something tonight  which puzzled me. I don’t know what its meaning can be. Regarding the  sovereign national conference [which was held in the DRC], you showed  me the numbers 3, 5, and 15, and I was puzzled. I can’t see what they mean.  So I beg you to reveal it to us—not just to me, but to all of your children  here, you need to show them what lies behind these numbers 3, 5, and 15,  for we are nothing but blind people.”18 As in this example, Diangienda’s  preaching often tended to emphasize his mystical relation to his father.  He proved capable of revealing the hidden meanings of facts, so that his  words brought to light the essence of things and persons while deliberately  concealing what did not need disclosure. In such cases, he usually resorted  to enigmatic language: “These are secret things,” “It is not time yet for me  to reveal these things to you,” “The son of man is instructed by means of  parables,” or “Today I won’t speak, just follow my gestures.” Several narratives also allude to extraterrestrial interventions by super- natural beings—identified as the soldiers of apocalypse, mentioned in the  </page> <page sequence="11"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   91 book of Revelation, chapters 9 and 19. Kimbanguists believe them to have  black faces and a small size, and they serve as Diangienda’s army. When  the Kimbanguist theologian and DRC army colonel Rev. Adama Iyefa asked  Diangienda about the “myth” of “little soldiers,” the spiritual leader gave  him a late-n ight appointment at his house in the church’s welcome cen- ter in Kinshasa, at an hour when he was certain everyone else was asleep.  Diangienda instructed Iyefa to kneel in prayer, and when they were fin- ished a “little soldier” appeared. Iyefa testified, “While I was on my knees,  the soldat ya mokusse was not as high as my shoulder, and his eyes were  throwing flames and his body radiated cold like a cold room. When I shook  hands with him after His Eminence, at the moment our hands came in  contact, I felt something like the mass of electric power.”19  Another eyewitness to such an encounter was one of Diangienda’s sons,  Martorel, who spoke to me about it in an interview. In his teenage years,  he often napped alongside his father. One day, he opened his eyes and  saw a little man in a soldier’s uniform, who was barely taller than the bed.  “I grabbed my father, saying, ‘Papa, wake up, I saw a little man,’ but he  simply laughed it off and told me, ‘No worries, he’s on a mission.’”20 Both  of these testimonies tend to corroborate the beliefs of most Kimbanguists,  some of whom contend that these soldiers of Armageddon are serving  Kimbangu and Diangienda. This further enhances the supernatural aura  of Diangienda, who also claimed to have the power to perceive and disrupt  occult gatherings that simple mortals cannot see with the eyes of the flesh.  Diangienda described in a sermon what happened in such “markets” and  “restaurants”:21 Papa told me, “Look at the big ‘restaurants’ they have opened; they  have no way to do that . . . where you are, so they came here to hide  their restaurant.” . . . Well, one of our pastors was participating in this  market. I didn’t want to denounce him, but it made me ashamed, for  these men said, “But this man is with you!” I saw people morphing  into lions, tigers, panthers, leopards, and all sorts of dangerous ani- mals. . . . I was moved to pity, so I went and rescued the pastor and  asked him, “Why are you here?” He answered, “Because I have a debt  to pay off. . . . I know you don’t like people doing this kind of thing.”  . . . I don’t know what happened after I left, for Papa threw gas on  them and burned them to the ground, and the place became a pond.  On the following morning, I saw the same pastor, who had become  sick. I called him and he was terrified, for he thought I was going to  denounce him. . . . But no, God is merciful.22 </page> <page sequence="12"> 92   kimbanguism and the bible Figure 3. One of the “small soldiers” of Armageddon (aka  “soldats ya mokusse”).  The representations of witchcraft are discussed in depth below, but this  acknowledgment of the sorcerers’ power to metamorphose is not restricted  to the Kimbanguist worldview. It is commonly found in Congolese culture  as a whole and in Kongo culture in particular. Father Van Wing observed:  “Just as the ndoki [witches] metamorphose into tiny animals, so one can  find, according to Kongo beliefs, people who can morph into big animals,  preferably leopards and crocodiles. These two beasts play a part in all the  authentic tragedies that each village has witnessed and still witnesses.”23 The obsession with witchcraft clearly has been superseded by the believ- ers’ veneration for their spiritual leader. Diangienda’s words and acts, as  </page> <page sequence="13"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   93 well as those of his two brothers and all of their children, are constantly  commented on by church members and preachers. They are recorded  and copied on audiotapes, videotapes, DVDs, and photographs, and they  constitute the foundation for the identity reconstruction proclaimed and  accomplished by the church. Well aware of the importance of his messages,  Diangienda exhorted his congregants shortly before he passed away: “In  the days to come, if we are no longer with you—for we are only sojourn- ers—you will sometimes wonder, ‘What did Papa say before he passed  away?’ Why don’t you just take what I tell you one day at a time? Yesterday I  spoke, the day before I spoke too, on Sunday also I spoke; every day I speak  to you. What I tell you is our common basis.”24 Diangienda delivered his sermons on a variety of occasions, address- ing religious, political, or economic themes, but above all the meaning of  Blackness. While not university-e ducated, he used scholarly language in  his analyses. He had an extraordinary gift for commanding the attention  of his audience through parables or storytelling or proverbs. Even after his  death, he still manifests through the dreams and visions of believers and  through the hymns, so that he ultimately appears more like a deity than a  man, promising his followers a bright future. Hence, Diangienda’s words are extremely significant for the Kimban- guist community, especially since his successors (his brother and his  nephew) said on taking the leadership of the church that they had nothing  else to tell the church members, for Diangienda had already told them all  they needed to hear. His insistence on the bolingo, mibeko, misala triad (love,  commandments, and good works), as well as on Blackness, has given his  preaching an importance that reaches beyond the Christian message. He  was the embodiment of moral authority and spiritual power, which also  sustained his healing power.  Some healing sessions were observed by the American sociologist Susan  Asch in Kinshasa in the early 1980s: “Sick people are first given a blessing,  and then a sip of the sacred water of Nkamba, which is renowned for its  healing power. I have taken pictures of such a healing session in Matete,  where a woman who was visibly in the throes of death got up after drinking  some of the sacred water offered by the spiritual leader.”25 I can second her  testimony. I have witnessed several similar instances of people who seemed  dead who then rose to their feet after his intervention.  All these elements have contributed to the aura of a leader whom  Kimbanguist believers expect to fulfill his promises concerning the  improvement of Black people’s living conditions. These promises are  </page> <page sequence="14"> 94   kimbanguism and the bible Figure 4. The Rise to Jerusalem shows the spiritual leader  Diangienda identified with God. This painting is the work  of a Kimbanguist artist called Muze, who presented it to  Diangienda on July 2, 1989. continuously repeated in the inspired hymns, which their church defines as  a mystery. In the Kimbanguist Church, sacred songs hold considerable impor- tance, on a par with the Bible and the prophetic messages of the spiri- tual leader, which illuminate the meaning of the lyrics. As a body of oral  tradition, these hymns are not just sung—they participate in a divine  plan. Indeed, Kimbanguist hymns have a unique history, which began in  1921 when Simon Kimbangu was challenged by the Protestant reverend  Jennings, who had observed that all his preaching, speeches, and healing  </page> <page sequence="15"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   95 sessions were accompanied by Protestant hymns. Kimbangu withdrew  for a moment to pray, and then returned with a new song in Kikongo.  Subsequently, Kimbangu’s disciples began receiving songs by means  of dreams or visions. One of the first Kimbanguist hymns includes this  stanza in Kikongo: Nuisa tambula makanda ma nza You shall welcome all nations: O Yesu kunu wonza kesa This is Jesus’s ultimate promise, E nkunga mia mbasi mubonga Sing the songs of the angels! Kenu vila kana ko Never forget this. This hymn, which sounds like a commandment, began a seemingly end- less series of sacred songs owned by the church; there are several thousand  of them today. In African traditions, songs are usually rhythmic poems  informed by conventional wisdom. They may be composed by griots or  popular singers, and they always reflect society’s values and tensions. In  both Congolese republics, songs meet various needs—for entertainment,  comforting, education, dance—and address a variety of themes, such as  self- development, love, women’s issues, beauty, money, or even political  awareness. Following the aesthetic rules of rumba or soukous, the compos- ers of the lyrics are typically the singers themselves; otherwise, they remain  anonymous. It is also important to point out that in both republics of Congo, songs  lie at the juncture between the profane and sacred worlds—the “profane”  world being defined in the national psyche as the realm of mundane enter- tainment and sexual impurity, while the “sacred” world is the realm of  piety, spirituality, and truth. Sacred singers and profane music singers are  in competition for an audience of both believers and unbelievers, but it  remains difficult to establish a clear separation between the two, since  both are rooted in the same musical and rhythmic genre—usually, the  rumba. Within this context, though, Kimbanguist songs are unique. While  rejected by other Christian churches that are also members of the World  Council of Churches, though parodied by some people, and though occa- sionally plagiarized by bands from the Christian business sector, these  hymns are defined by Kimbanguists as “inspired hymns” or “songs of the  angels.” Due to their mystical character, they are distinguished from “pro- fane” songs and even from the Christian music made by other Congolese  churches. Because they are not the work of any composer, being attributed  </page> <page sequence="16"> 96   kimbanguism and the bible to God, these songs are seen as revealing what escapes the awareness of  social actors. Unlike profane songs, they develop the three tenets of the  Kimbanguist Church in keeping with Diangienda’s preaching (the love of  God and one’s neighbor, obedience to God’s commandments, and encour- agement to work) and also insist on the theme of Blackness. Martin gave  the following analysis of their role: “Kimbanguist songs became one of the  main characteristics of the movement, and it is still the case today: people  express their faith through art and music rather than theological formula- tions. . . . We [Westerners] must try to define the trends of their doctrine,  which is impossible unless we spend a certain amount of time with them,  talk with them at length after earning their trust, worship and go on retreats  with them, and above all get to know their songs and images.”26 Balandier, writing about the Kimbanguist “songs of heaven,” observed  that these hymns, “despite their ‘Christian’ approach, constitute a literature  of ‘resistance.’ The political authorities were quite right when they pointed  out that the Christmas hymns to Gounza in 1923 were mainly allusions  to the struggle against white domination, and are concerned with little  else than the trials and suffering endured, and the struggles against the  enemy.”27 Yet, however accurate the above analyses may be, these early observ- ers of Kimbanguism seem to have failed to grasp the mechanism at work  behind this phenomenon, which is essential to the life of the church. Sing- ing, here, is another way of understanding life, the world, the dominant  Other, Blackness, and Kimbanguist identity, since hymns are not only sung  but interpreted. The themes broached in the lyrics address notions in the  Bible—atonement and God’s forgiveness, social or inner peace, the glory of  God, the hereafter—and the identities of the spiritual leaders. Kimbanguist hymns may be categorized on the basis of their inscription  in one of the three time dimensions—past, present, and future. Hymns  set in the past are especially focused on Genesis, the identity of Adam and  Eve, the garden of Eden, and the origins of Black people. The present is  sung in the mode of a commentary or interpretation of topical issues and  stakes. Finally, the future is expressed along two lines—a renewed human- kind exalts the triumph of Blacks and their inventions or, a more pessi- mistic message, wars and conflicts are prophesied. Hymns seem to have  three objectives: informing the people, glorifying and praising God, and  lamenting and praying. Here is a song of prayer, originally in the Ngangulu  language, as sung by the GTKI (Groupe théâtral kimbanguiste) Talangai  church choir: </page> <page sequence="17"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   97 Oh, my God, My suffering is such! Have mercy! I violated the taboo imposed upon me From my childhood; where shall I go? Who will save me? Whose is this world? I don’t know where to go; come and save me! Soprano: I have grown tired of running; Where shall I end up? I have grown tired Of weeping every day.  Chorus: I had hoped to be saved Thanks to my doings; I was filled with love, I would pray on my knees. Soprano: My sins are tied To my own body; I have tainted the faith Of no other soul. Chorus: Oh, my God (repeated several times) My God, come and save me! (4 times) Bass: “But you had rejected My advice, And you had rejected Me!” This hymn of prayer, received by Julienne Bialonga, a female pastor and  member of the church, stages a dialogue between the believer and an anon- ymous character identified by believers as God. The former complains of  suffering from trangressing divine commandments, but repents by con- fessing the individual nature of his or her sins. The God character, who  intervenes in the final solo part, stresses that the believer rejected his rec- ommendations and disowned God. As I develop further below, in the Kim- banguist understanding, faith is essentially a question of love or rejection. Hymns also serve the goal of preaching a new worldview. Contrary to the  religious repertoire of other churches’ songs, which remains restricted to  </page> <page sequence="18"> 98   kimbanguism and the bible biblical history and ends where the scriptures end, the source of Kimban- guist hymns is defined as endless. These songs are not authored by anyone,  but transmitted to the inspired people by beings acting as intermediaries  between God and humans. These intermediaries may be angels, people  who have passed away, an anthropomorphic Nature, or the enigmatic fore- fathers of the church—Simon Kimbangu and his three sons (the Holy Trin- ity). Kimbanguist hymns seem to convey the biblical message with the aim  of putting within intellectual reach what seems inaccessible, and shedding  light on what was said in a symbolic way in the scriptures. For instance, the  following stanza reformulates Genesis: You have created everything Without touching any of them; You created man another day But You really shaped him, You gave him the power to rule Over everything in this world.  He is the really precious thing Above anything else. Why, Lord, Did you let Satan ruin Your precious thing? You let Satan ruin it! Listening to this hymn allows church members to learn biblical history  without having to read the scriptures. Certain hymns transport the listeners  back into biblical times and even fill in some of the ellipses left in the Bible  by its authors, as the following shows: Believers, obey the Law  That I gave you So as not to weep As in the days of Noah!  Believers, keep the Love  That I recommend you to have, So as not to weep  As in the days of Noah! </page> <page sequence="19"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   99 Believers, accomplish the Works That I prescribe you to do, So as not to weep As in the days of Noah! At the time when Noah  Was building the ark, People were laughing at him: They thought that The rain could not fall All over the world. When the tempest was raging all over the world, People begged him,  “Noah, open the ark, Our children are drowning!” Chorus: Noah, Noah, Noah, Noah, Father Noah, Noah, open the ark, The children are drowning! Alto: “Impossible, impossible My children, that’s impossible.  Impossible, impossible Children, that’s impossible.  Look for another refuge.” Mezzo: “In the world we used to live in, I was the one who prophesied. When I was building the ark, You refused to listen to me!”  Tenor: Look at these herds, Noah! Look at these works, Noah! Open the ark, Our children are drowning! </page> <page sequence="20"> 100   kimbanguism and the bible Tenor: Your wife, Noah, Calls me “Father.” What has gone so wrong today, Noah, That you won’t listen to me anymore? Tenor: You and I, Noah, Would go on a walk together. What has gone so wrong today, That you won’t listen to me anymore? Tenor: You and I, Noah, Used to drink some wine together. What has gone so wrong today, That you won’t listen to me anymore? This hymn is typical in its depiction of the characters of the episode of  the flood, casting Noah as a real person in dialogue with his friends and  the members of his community. Regardless of whether science validates  or invalidates such episodes from the Bible, for the church members these  songs, which come straight from heaven, work as confirmations of the holy  scriptures, although in a different literary style.  Not all hymns repeat biblical episodes. The songs function in many dif- ferent ways. For example, the purpose of certain hymns is to convey spir- itual messages from the birds and other living beings (which are seen as  part of creation and as messengers of God), or even messages from what is,  presumably, the unspoken disarray of the “pagans,” or unbelievers: We, pagans, are watching you; We, pagans, will eventually follow you. We have seen all the places prepared by God: His Word and His Victory are in you, You are our leaders, You will show us the way. Convert us! You will enjoy heavenly bliss. We, pagans— Our souls are crying for you. Where are you? We are waiting for you To fight this battle, </page> <page sequence="21"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   101 Waiting for the bell to toll. Who shall claim ownership of sin? Who shall claim ownership of death? Who shall claim ownership of tears? All of this belongs to us— To us, pagans. This hymn gives a clear indication of the Kimbanguist definition of pagans.  On the basis of the self-d escription offered here, pagans are people living  in sin, who find themselves doomed to eternal mourning, helplessness,  and death. Pagans seem to be aware of their fate and ask for help from the  people who are supposed to be God’s elect. Given the diversity of the entities speaking through these songs, it is  of interest to ask whether the phenomenon of receiving inspired hymns  should be defined as sacred inspiration or spirit possession. The notion  of possession is quite difficult to define, due to the confusion it generates.  The French ethnomusicologist Gilbert Rouget’s work is helpful in explain- ing the perspective of Kimbanguists on inspiration and possession. Rouget  focused first on three examples: Mother Superior Jeanne des Anges (one  of the famous demonic nuns of Loudun), who identified herself and was  considered by all as possessed by demons; Jean Cavalier (the most famous  military and prophetic leader of the seventeenth- century French Calvin- ists known as camisards), who said he was inspired by the Holy Spirit and  was recognized as such due to his military genius; and an ecstatic Sufi,  for whom it can only be said that he is in the state of “having found (wajd)  God,” since the term “possessed” would “mean he is possessed either by  God or by the devil, which would be absurd,” while the word “inspired”  would “mean that his state is due to the presence of the Holy Spirit—a  religious concept foreign to Islam.”28 Hence the question revolves around  the exact relation between the ecstatic person and the supernatural entity  responsible for the person’s state. Within the category he called “mystical trance,” Rouget distinguished  three subcategories. In the first, the person appears “to have undergone  a change of personality during the trance, as a result of a god, genius, or  ancestor—for which the term ‘deity’ may be used—having taken posses- sion of his or her body, substituted itself for him or her, and acted in his  or her place.”29 The second subcategory depicts the entranced person as  hosting the deity or a force emanating from it, which coexists with him or  her but dominates the person’s will while letting him or her speak in the  </page> <page sequence="22"> 102   kimbanguism and the bible deity’s name. The most frequent example of this relation is observed in  trances attributed to the Holy Spirit. In this case, Rouget concluded, it is  a case of inspiration, not possession. In the third subcategory, the relation  between the deity and the entranced person is understood as an encounter,  which may be experienced by the person as a communion, a revelation, or  an epiphany. Contrary to the other two, this kind of trance does not involve  any form of embodiment. The explanations given by the inspired people I interviewed help deter- mine which of the two concepts—inspiration or possession—is the more  appropriate in order to grasp how Kimbanguist hymns are defined in their  church. The term “inspired person,” which designates someone moved to  act by divine or creative inspiration, is used here to refer, as Kimbanguists  do, to people receiving hymns or supernatural messages. These people  may be men or women, young or elderly, educated or illiterate, or children,  and they seem to have been chosen regardless of their ethnic, national,  or denominational identity. They have received hymns in a wide variety  of African languages—Lingala, Kikongo, Swahili, Ngangulu, Mboshi, and  others—and in other languages, such as French, English, Italian, Chinese,  Korean, and Hebrew. Hymns have also been received in languages so far  unknown, much like the phenomenon of glossolalia. The translations of  the lyrics have depended either on foreign guests, who recognize their  mother tongue at the moment when the hymn is sung, or on the degree of  inspiration of the person receiving the song, who may also simultaneously  receive its translation or its overall meaning. While the inspired are assumed to be used by God as instruments to  convey his message to the Kimbanguist Church and to humanity, there are  several types of inspired people. Some have received this ministry as a sort  of spiritual crutch, for they consider themselves too sinful to have deserved  it. The mission is imposed on them so that they may on their own renounce  their vices, convert, and get back on the right track, as is explained by an  interviewee: “I used to be quite a sinner and a very skeptical man until I  began receiving the hymns. I believe God has chosen me on purpose, to  force me to calm down. Since then, as a result of the things I see, those  who have known me before I began receiving the hymns can say that I have  really changed” (D. N. P., 36, male, GTKI Nkamba). These people have been forced by God to grow up, while others have  been chosen in spite of their unbelief. Being given by God, the songs can- not be refused, and another interviewee complained: “I am sick and tired  of receiving these hymns. I have done everything I could for this thing to  </page> <page sequence="23"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   103 go, but it doesn’t! I did lots of stuff on purpose—fornication, taking my  showers naked—but it’s just sticking to me. And sometimes, during the  night, Papa comes and tells me, ‘See what you have done, my son? Don’t do  that again in the future,’ and gives me yet another song” (B., 28, male, choir  member, Chorale des enfants kimbanguistes Brazzaville). Some inspired people began receiving songs before they became Kim- banguist. Unsurprisingly, they point to this gift as the reason for their con- version: “I used to be a Protestant. I kept receiving songs and giving them  to the choir I was a member of, but people often told me that these weren’t  Protestant hymns, so I couldn’t figure out what was going on. It’s only  when I told my uncle about it—he’s a Kimbanguist—and he asked to see  these texts, and he told me, ‘you have a suitcase full of clothes here, why go  elsewhere to borrow something to wear?’ meaning these were Kimbanguist  hymns. So I went and showed them to the church, and they were accepted  as Kimbanguist hymns by decision of the spiritual leader” (J., 27, female,  choir member, Brazzaville). The anthropologist Mircea Eliade, when analyzing the case of the sha- man, wrote that “one may become a medicine man or a shaman as a result  of a personal decision to appropriate religious powers (a process called  ‘quest’) but also as a result of a vocation (or ‘calling’) because one is forced  to do so by supernatural beings.”30 From the Kimbanguist perspective, an  inspired person is not just someone who thinks or declares they are, but  someone who has been called by God to become the receptor of messages  or songs. In this sense, Kimbanguist hymns may be said to result from  divine inspiration. Still, some of the hymns sung with the authorization  of the spiritual leaders suggest the possibility of possession. The following  hymn is sung by the GTKI choir: I, Satan, thought myself so powerful That I had dominated this world But the world belongs to God. Ooh, my time has come! I’m asking you, Mfumu a Longo,31 To gather all your followers— And if there is one who doesn’t accept you, Leave that one to me—(s)he’s mine (S)he’ll go with me To hell over there. Among themselves, they dance, </page> <page sequence="24"> 104   kimbanguism and the bible Among themselves, they love fetishes, Among themselves, they commit adultery And do all the things that you, God, do not like. Ooh, my time has come! To understand this hymn, one needs to know that besides obeying the  Mosaic Ten Commandments, members of the Kimbanguist Church are  expected to abide by the moral prescriptions bequeathed by Kimbangu,  which include abstaining from sleeping naked or in a state of anger; bath- ing or showering naked; using tobacco, drugs, or alcohol; eating pork;  dancing or attending dance sessions; interfering with conflicts, lawsuits,  or feuds; and resorting to witchcraft, fetishes, talismans, magic, or divina- tion. Additionally, all Kimbanguists must take off their shoes in any holy  place, and women must keep their heads covered and wear clothes that are  not close fitting.  In the hymn above, Satan calls out the spiritual leader about the trans- gressive behavior of church members. In my investigation of this particular  hymn, I spoke to Pastor Philippe Assumbe, who was in charge of the mis- sions of the spiritual leader. He asserted, “It’s Satan’s angel who took the  mission of confirming the existence of Satan. The Kimbanguist Church’s  mission being one of revelation, it reveals all that is hidden. Through this  type of hymn—for there are several others, similar to this one—Satan con- firms his existence, for there are people who deny it. . . . The same inspired  person may have two voices—that of God and that of the devil. When receiv- ing a message from the devil, the inspired person may be said to have indeed  been filled with the devil.”32 Thus, according to Rev. Assumbe, this type of  hymn is authorized by the spiritual leader. But the inspired person runs the  risk of being Satan’s spokesperson, so it is necessary to arrange an appoint- ment with the spiritual leader, who is the only one with the power to discern  what comes from the devil or from God, so that he may silence the devil.  Can one therefore consider this type of hymn to be a case of posses- sion? Rouget pointed out that possessed people are “afterward in a state of  more or less complete amnesia, so that in general, most possessed people  are absolutely unable to depict their condition.”33 Yet the receptor of the  song above, as well as others of the same type, kept the memory of what  was experienced during the trance, since this person was able to explain  how the hymn was transmitted. It is also important to stress, as Froelich  did, that possession in African cultures “is neither play-a cting nor a fit of  </page> <page sequence="25"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   105 hysterics, but a mystical experience which is both sought for and triggered,  and shows itself in a ritualized context.”34 Hence, it is worth asking how  inspiration takes place in the lived experience of the people concerned.  Does it come as the result of a ritualized context or an initiation? While Kimbanguist hymns seem to have originated with Simon Kim- bangu, they retain certain aspects reminiscent of initiation processes: “Ini- tiation is self- reflexive, it is an action of the self on the self—there is no  possibility of proxy, for one is the only one taking on something new, and  transforming, or converting, oneself. But it is an action which is imposed  by others—it is impossible to initiate oneself. Initiation is not given, but  acquired.”35 Yet, among the Kimbanguists, inspiration is not acquired but  given, since inspired people are allegedly chosen by God himself. All of my  interviewees clearly asserted that they never chose to become inspired but,  on the contrary, have been obliged to receive these songs and messages.  Kimbanguist collective memory is crystallized around Christian spiri- tual retreat—a practice whose inner mechanisms distinguish it from the  pattern of initiation. The spiritual retreats began on Diangienda’s recom- mendation and took place on a seasonal basis from 1972 to 1989. Retreat  usually occurred in the bush or on the hills, at a distance from people’s  houses. During a retreat, which typically lasted for five or six days, women  and men, from infancy to old age, were isolated in gendered groups and  guided by pastors selected by the spiritual leader. The retreats usually  would begin on a Tuesday evening after a sermon by the pastor, and the  participants would set the number of days they would fast to atone for their  sins—one to three days without eating or drinking (or even, in certain cases,  swallowing their own saliva), spent in prayer and singing, and sleeping on  the bare ground. These aspects of retreat may be compared with the three  fundamental elements of kimpassi initiation mentioned above: the break  from the circle of relatives, the ordeals, and the rebirth. The break is sup- posed to be accomplished between the “old man” and the “new man,” in  the scriptural meaning of these phrases. Renouncing comfort was usually  the main topic of several sermons; it was preached as a means of spiritual  rebirth and a reminder of the aim the participants had set for themselves.  After washing early on Saturday morning, the participants attended a  closing service and shared a meal together to end the retreat. These ordeals  were meant to give birth to new men and women, with new daily habits  as codified by Kimbanguist Christian morals. However, contrary to initia- tion rituals, at retreat all age categories were represented, and even moth- ers with babes in arms were allowed to participate; the genders, however,  </page> <page sequence="26"> 106   kimbanguism and the bible remained strictly segregated. There was no secrecy, either, while secrecy  is an essential component of initiation rituals. As a matter of fact, non-  Kimbanguists and observers were welcomed at these retreats, and no doors  were closed. In this way, these gatherings may not have been analogous to  initiation processes. However, as in the kimpassi initiation, during the spiritual retreats the  participants were expected to have exceptional spiritual experiences, such  as having visions or dreams and, especially, receiving songs. In a way, this  was the period par excellence when inspired people discovered their gifts,  as the two following testimonies show. One interviewee was skeptical about  his friends’ and relatives’ excitement around the retreat of 1972: “I doubted  all this. Since Papa Simon doesn’t exist anymore, how could people see  him? So I’d tease them.” He decided to attend the next retreat, held in 1974  in Gamboma, Congo- Brazzaville, to see for himself, but he experienced  nothing save a lack of hunger after the fast. However, three days later, I had a dream. . . . In my sleep, I found myself back in Gamboma,  the place was filled with sunshine. I heard a lot of cheering. . . . So I  looked up towards the bush where we had spent the retreat, and I saw  angels coming from there. From there, too, Adam came out, and the  angels surrounded him; Eve came out, and the angels surrounded  her; and Abraham came out, and the angels surrounded him. It was  as if they were showing a genealogical tree: from Adam, who was  black, to Abraham, to Isaac, to Jesus, whose features were like a Pal- estinian’s or an Arab’s. And here also stood the person I had mocked  when I had said, “You have been on a retreat, and you  haven’t seen a  thing.” And that person was introducing them, “This is Adam, this is  Eve, and over there is Isaac,” appearing and disappearing after each  introduction, as in a movie. I woke up in the middle of the night,  sweating all over. [Three days later] I received my first song, in a dream. I was  standing on a sandy place, and I saw an angel coming up to me—a  beautiful woman, light- skinned like an Arab. She . . . spoke to me in  Munukutuba,36 telling me, “I will teach you a hymn. Can you memo- rize it?” I said I could. . . . Then she said, “Sing the soprano part, and  I’ll sing the alto.” . . . Then she sang the tenor part, and so on. She  told me to review, so we did, and I woke up right afterwards. I had  been at a summer camp with other kids who spoke Munukutuba, so  I was able to understand the song, but normally I don’t speak that  </page> <page sequence="27"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   107 language. It meant, “The path to Heaven is good, Mama, / The path  to Heaven is good, Papa, / The path to Heaven is good. / Look for  the path to Heaven and you shall find.” (M. A., 48, high school head  supervisor, GTKI Talangai) This testimony displays the mystique behind the receiving of the gift. This  interviewee participated in the retreat because it had caused unusual excite- ment and speculation around Kimbanguist mystical experiences, particu- larly about the people receiving hymns. He attended with both a critical  mind and open-m indedness: he expected to witness something, but noth- ing happened until after he returned home. A second interviewee described  how she received her first hymn in 1972: When I arrived at the venue of the retreat, on the first [two] day[s]  nothing happened. . . . But on the third day . . . in the afternoon, our  group of nine was praying, and we began hearing the grass rustling  as if someone were walking up to us. We were scared, especially when  we heard a noise right in the middle of our circle. We were wondering  if we should stop the prayers, but we went on all the same. . . . At the  end of our prayers, we looked up, and we saw a sheet of paper on the  ground. One lady, who was the eldest of our group, tried to pick it up  three times, but she couldn’t because she had cramps; her fingers  had become stuck on top of one another. So we asked ourselves who  was going to take it. We were all scared. Since I was the youngest of  the group and the only one who was literate, the adults suggested  that maybe that sheet had been given for someone who could write; it  was a blank sheet of paper. So in spite of my very elementary level, I  picked up the sheet and I gave it to the pastor, who gave it back to me,  so that our group could report what we had experienced.  Now when the night came, I dreamed that I saw Arabs with cloths  all around their heads, and they were singing a hymn in Kikongo. I  thought it was just a dream, for I had no idea what it meant to receive  a hymn. I woke up having memorized two hymns, and I described  my dream to the pastor. . . . I don’t belong to the Kongo ethnic group,  but I knew that the literal meaning of the song was “The Lord our  Savior is coming into the world, coming to rescue us in all things  down below. You are the one we are sending our tearful prayers to, for  forgiveness of all the evil ingrained in our hearts.” (B. J., 44, female,  pastor, GTKI Talangai) </page> <page sequence="28"> 108   kimbanguism and the bible These two examples illustrate how, in the Kimbanguist Church, spiritual  retreats worked as a litmus test, which allowed inspired people to become  aware of their chosenness. Out of eight such people I was able to interview,  five emphasized that the catalyst for their inspiration had been a spiritual  retreat. They all gave equally detailed accounts of the circumstances in which  they began receiving songs—in their sleep by having a dream, or in a state  of wakefulness by experiencing a vision or hearing voices singing. The spir- itual retreats were reminiscent of ritualized events, which makes them com- parable to possession rituals practiced in traditional Congolese religions.  The Belgian priest Paul Raymaekers observed in the 1950s that the doctrinal  and liturgical frameworks that could be traced back to former, purely Afri- can customs—such as the nighttime dances and the “shaking” at the sound  of the ngoma (the drum used for dances)—had all but disappeared.37 Today, spontaneous individual trances may still be observed among  Kimbanguist believers, but they are discouraged and repressed. Is it thus  acceptable to speak of spirit possession? In spirit possession, Rouget noted  certain variables. First, possession cults are forms of religion characterized  by a certain type of relation between the deity and devotees, whereby the  latter are possessed by the former. Second, possession itself is a social- ized individual behavior, whereby under certain circumstances the person  undergoes a change resulting in his or her usual personality (which rules  everyday behavior) being replaced by that of the deity, which dictates dif- ferent behaviors; this substitution is accompanied by an alteration of the  psyche, commonly designated as a trance. Finally, the identification thus  accomplished constitutes an alliance (sometimes reduced to what may be  described as a pact of coexistence) whose major function is to bring the  deity either to use its power in favor of the person possessed or his or her  group—for example, by increasing their strength, keeping them out of  harm’s way, healing them from illnesses, or revealing the future—or to  renounce the use of its power against them.38 Unlike those aspects of spirit possession, when an inspired person from  the Kimbanguist Church describes his or her experiences, the line is always  clearly drawn between the supernatural entity inspiring the person and the  latter’s own personality. There is a dialogue between the two, rather than  an invasion of one by the other. Besides, very specific memories of the  encounter are retained, as opposed to the state of amnesia that typically  follows trances, as described by Rouget. While the Kimbanguist spiritual  retreats triggered the song- receiving ability of many, for others the receiv- ing of hymns was initiated by a dream or a vision entirely disconnected  </page> <page sequence="29"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   109 from the retreats. When I asked in what context they had become inspired,  I received the following testimonies: I was playing football with three young boys around 3:00 p.m. . . . I  was running after the ball when I saw something like an image. I  didn’t understand. Suddenly I saw a pigeon flying toward me. When  it was in front of me, it landed and turned into an actual person,  dressed like the Catholic nuns, wearing gloves and a white head- scarf covering all her hair, and wings in the back. She was stand- ing about a meter above the ground. I knelt down, and then I saw  Papa Simon Kimbangu looking at me with a smile on his face. But I  just kept kneeling; I was scared. . . . He spoke to me, singing these  words, “Don’t be afraid, for you have your God! Even if Satan is  persecuting you, he is not strong enough to defeat you.” Then he  showed me the temple. I hadn’t been to Nkamba yet. . . . He sang  a song saying that Papa Simon has triumphed and is going to rule  over the whole world. Then he blessed me three times, laying his  hand on my head, and a few days later, I began to receive songs.  For five months, I couldn’t find any sleep. I lost weight. I could not  bear to hear any noise and didn’t leave home. Everything I tried to  set up failed. So I decided to go to Nkamba. I walked all the way  from Mbanza Ngungu [forty-s ix miles], and there I met Papa [Dian- gienda] and explained it all to him. After receiving permission from  him, I began teaching songs to the GTKI choir members. (D. N. P.,  36, male, GTKI Nkamba) When I was seven, Papa [Diangienda] showed me how he had made  the world, how the Black man is, how things are happening in the  world, whether good or evil. In just one second, he showed me how  the five continents took shape, one for each ethnic group. After he  had shown me all this, Papa asked me to come with him to show me  what will happen in the future. . . . The songs started at that time.  (O. R., 26, male, GTKI Talangai) When I started high school is when I began receiving songs. The  first song I received came during my sleep. I heard angels sing- ing—it was as if I were inside the temple and people were singing.  When I woke up in the morning, I was imitating a fragment of this  song. Constantly, even in school while the rest were focused on their  </page> <page sequence="30"> 110   kimbanguism and the bible lessons, that fragment of song kept recurring in my mind, so that I  could no longer pay attention to what the teacher was saying. I told  the deacon of my congregation about it, so they decided to take me  to Papa Mfumu a Longo. That was back in 1991, so there was the  rampage going on in Kinshasa, and I wasn’t able to get there. So  they had to take my picture and my hymns to the spiritual leader,  and then Papa gave his permission. (N. B. C., 29, teacher, GTKI  Talangai) By now I have received my 1,452nd hymn. I received my first song  on November 8, 1979, during a beko [prayer vigil] that had been orga- nized at the temple of the Plateaux des quinze ans in the presence  of Papa Simon the grandson [now the spiritual leader of the church].  Around 1:00 a.m., I had a dream. I saw an old woman who caught  my arm. There were nine of us in the group, and in my dream also  there were nine of us. The old lady drew me aside, and she put me  into a room where there was a white board, on which [the lyrics of ] a  song had been written. She taught me that song, but while singing,  I was still dreaming my dream. The others told me when I woke up  that I had been singing. During the same day, I was overwhelmed  with hymns—thirty- five in that one day. (B., 38, male, choir member,  GTKI Brazzaville) Diangienda’s role is clearly dominant in these testimonies. As explained  above, no important decision can be made unless the spiritual leader has  given his approval; only he can, just by looking at a picture of someone,  identify the person as well as their past, their mission, or their evolution  in the church and the world. One cannot be recognized as an inspired per- son unless identified and confirmed as such by the spiritual leader after  describing one’s dreams, visions, and hymns to him. The messengers behind the hundreds of hymns I have analyzed have  many different identities. They may be the God of the Old Testament,  Jesus of Nazareth, or God the Holy Spirit. They may be the founders of  the Kimbanguist Church—Simon Kimbangu; his wife, Marie Muilu; and  their three sons, Kisolokele, Dialungana, and Diangienda—or Kimbangu’s  grandson, the current spiritual leader, Simon Kimbangu Kiangani. They  may also be angels, human beings who passed away, living beings belong- ing to the vegetable or animal kingdoms—trees, birds, water—or concepts,  </page> <page sequence="31"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   111 such as death. Here is a hymn (received in Lingala) that presents death as  a metaphysical character: Death, Death, Death: Nobody can know me You, worldly people, None of you can Have a clear idea of me. I am present all over the world, Even in the water. I walk with a whip, I destroy men one by one, Then I send them away Where the Judgment takes place. There, You will experience the dread I cause! Chorus: Death, Death, Death: You, rich men, You cannot bribe me; You, intelligent men, You cannot know me, For I do the work As it has to be done. Death, Death, Death: God the Father, our Lord Jesus, And our father the Holy Spirit Sent me down below To send people Every now and then Every day to their world. God left Heaven And came to you down below; You are not rejoicing, But I am rejoicing, For I do the work As it has to be done. Death, Death, Death! </page> <page sequence="32"> 112   kimbanguism and the bible Tenor: Be aware that if you have not obeyed The commandments that were given, In the place where you shall go You shall see me, Death, Death, Death. Tenor: Be aware that if you have disobeyed The three principles that were given you, In the place where you’ll go I will eat you. Tenor: Whether you were endowed with beauty Or a tall size, Where you shall go, you are nothing. Death, Death, Death! Whether you have money Or you are intelligent, When your time has come, I will stop you in your tracks. Death, Death, Death! Solo: To those who obey, I cannot hide the fact That where they go, I am not present, Death, Death, Death. This hymn was received by Julienne Bialonga (known as B. J.). Its con- tents cast a complex, ambiguous light on the identity of the sender of the  message, placing any observer on the boundary between natural and super- natural phenomena. In this hymn, death appears to be a good servant, or  a tool, of God. The song clearly shows how Kimbanguist believers imag- ine death through the image the latter gives of itself—a phenomenon that  nobody can grasp or comprehend, an incorruptible agent of God’s will,  which reaps every living soul in due time without concern for their wealth,  intelligence, beauty, or social status. Death may be found everywhere, stand- ing in the way of sinners even beyond their physical passing away, except for  those who, being faithful servants of God, will not see death but will reap  </page> <page sequence="33"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   113 eternal life instead. When I asked whether a vision had accompanied her  receiving this hymn, Bialonga answered: “It was a big storm, through which  I could make out a shape that looked irate. Arms were sticking out from that  shape, and it was singing” (B. J., 44, female, pastor, GTKI Talangai). Once a hymn has been made public, the knowledge of the context of its  receiving gives an advantage to inspired people over the rest of the commu- nity, as the following testimonies show: At times, I see people singing. At other times, we are the ones sing- ing. For instance, one day in the beko [prayer vigil] I had just knelt  down to pray when I saw Papa Dialungana in a vision, sitting in an  armchair. Next to him was a kneeling woman who was giving him  this message, and behind the woman people were singing in Kikongo  a hymn that literally means, “Listen to us, God of Mercy, / You are our  savior, and our salvation is in You; / You are our savior, You are Lord  Jesus, / Don’t turn Your back on us, / For peace in the world will come  from You / And the races of the world shall be saved through You.”  Then, when we said “Amen,” the hymn also came to an end.  Sometimes, I see angels. They [songs] come in different forms— sometimes men, snippets, or images. The day before yesterday, I  heard a bird singing about the war; it was saying that human beings  have become like the beasts in the bush. Those who know me well  are aware that, when they see me in a certain position, they mustn’t  come close to me or touch me. For sometimes, when people touch  me as I am receiving a hymn, the Spirit vanishes. Sometimes, I hear  the voice [of the sender]; sometimes it happens through a vision.  (D. K. P., male, 36, mechanic, GTKI Nkamba) The angel is the one sending the hymns; but at times, it’s Papa himself  who comes and gives it. Sometimes, it has to do with evil: Papa comes  and shows me how evil things occur and then gives me the hymn.  When an event is going to happen, he comes and shows in the hymn  how he wants Africa to be or become. He shows the future first and  then accompanies that with hymns. Sometimes, it’s the angel who  sends the hymn; at other times, it’s Papa himself who speaks through  the angels’ voices. (O. R., 26, male, GTKI Talangai Brazzaville) I receive songs in visions, dreams, or while I’m awake. They come  unexpectedly. Whatever the length of the song, I receive it in a couple  </page> <page sequence="34"> 114   kimbanguism and the bible of seconds. (P. Ma., 47, male deputy intern at Brazzaville hospital,  GTKI Plateaux des quinze ans) Although my respondents did not seem particularly attracted to poetry,  the hymns they convey have a distinctly poetic character, or they sometimes  sound like scenes from a play, with a call- and- response structure involv- ing both the sender(s) of the message and the Kimbanguist believers, or  the Black person as embodied by the Kimbanguists, who then act as the  receptors, singers, and interpreters of the messages. Because hymns hold a  unique place in Kimbanguist thought, inspired people are considered to be  uncommon personalities within the church. My interviews showed, how- ever, that they share a number of characteristics. Many of them first went  through a phase of what their relatives and friends saw as mental illness:  “When it began, people thought it was a case of madness. They even took  me to the cabano [a derisive term for the Brazzaville mental hospital], but I  wasn’t crazy. At some point, it began to have more importance, so they took  me to Papa Diangienda. Then he held my face close to his belly and spoke  out, saying, ‘We want to hear these songs, go ahead and sing them’” (O. R.,  26, male, GTKI Talangai Brazzaville). In addition, all of them share the same discreet attitude. Although their  existence is known to the community because each of them belongs to a  choir, they prefer to go unnoticed; they are difficult to identify at first. It  was challenging to find them and then to convince them to give interviews.  Hence, I always contacted first the choirmasters to ask for the contact infor- mation of the people concerned; every choir includes at least one inspired  member. A third characteristic is their secretiveness. When asked certain ques- tions, many refused to answer, saying they had an obligation to keep that  information secret or were forbidden to speak. Others tried to respond cau- tiously, as the following examples indicate: If we call someone “inspired,” then that person has necessarily met  angels. These things really are secrets, but since this is about showing  Kimbanguism to people who know nothing about it, I’ll try to speak.  (O. R., 26, male, GTKI Talangai) This point is a great secret for me, but I will speak to you about it  because this secret is a heavy load to bear. This way, there will be two  of us bearing it. (B. J., 44, female, pastor, GTKI Talangai) </page> <page sequence="35"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   115 A fourth criterion distinguishing these people appears in the words of  Diangienda, who called them mbinkundi, which means “seers” or “vision- aries.” As the interviews show, prophecy is part of the messages or hymns  received.  I’ll give you an example. In May 1992, two months before the death  of Papa Mfumu a Longo [Diangienda], I received a hymn which  announced Papa’s death. But I was blamed by the community. People  told me, “How can you wish for Papa’s death?” they said reproach- fully. I was ashamed and miserable. I felt frustrated. This is the hymn  I had received: Papa, we are asking you To bring your peace down on us, For we, your children, Are left as orphans now In the world where we are, Satan has gotten ready! Papa we are beseeching you To give us solace. Chorus: Papa, we are beseeching you To give us solace! Now you have gone to Heaven, You have left us behind, We are left to cry, With our eyes brimming with tears! Look, how scattered we have become, See how scattered we have become! This hymn, received by N. B. (male), clearly shows to what extent inspired  people may be said to be privileged over the rest of the community in know- ing about the context of each song. They seem to all experience premoni- tory dreams, which sometimes translate into prophetic songs—messages  about the future sung in the present tense. This makes their task a tricky  one, possibly putting them at odds with the rest of the community. Indeed,  while premonitory songs tend to encourage believers to have a mystical  wait- and- see attitude, these songs may also run counter to community  </page> <page sequence="36"> 116   kimbanguism and the bible expectations. In this case, the division announced in the hymn was not  evident when it was received; the rift only occurred ten years later. When Diangienda did pass away, this hymn—which is now very popular  with all the choirs of the church and has been recorded on several CDs— earned a positive reputation and the right to be performed. This was ironic  because the choir members knew nothing of the circumstances under  which it was received, and believed instead that it had only recently been  received, because it so accurately pictures the critical condition the church  is currently in.  I have been amazed to see the fulfillment of some of the prophecies  entrusted to me concerning the succession crisis. For example, Julienne  Bialonga told me in confidence in November 2000, “Darkness will fall  among the descendants of Simon Kimbangu concerning his succession.”  Such a pronouncement, at that time, was unsettling enough to shake the  faith of a number of believers in the lineage of Simon Kimbangu. But,  thankfully for the believers, sacred hymns keep being received: even after  passing away, Diangienda continues to make his voice heard. The follow- ing hymn, received in the Kikongo language at the time of Diangienda’s  funeral, depicts his departure and his ongoing influence: Listen, listen, listen! I have left, But you’ll stay in peace. I am going unto the Father  I am going to muster New forces, For the time Of my labor is accomplished (bis) Chorus: All of you are The flock that belongs to me I am leaving you in my sacred fold Stay in peace and keep My recommendations I have left no one in perdition Listen, listen listen: Love, commandments, labor,  Without tiring, Listen, listen, listen! </page> <page sequence="37"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   117 Whoever won’t win can only blame his own stupidity. This hymn fits perfectly with the timing of its reception: it conveys Dian- gienda’s last wishes in keeping with the contents of his preaching. Visions are a fifth feature of the experiences of the inspired respondents,  since every single one of them declared they had seen angels. Statements  were extraordinarily consistent among the people I interviewed, whether  they lived in Kinshasa, Brazzaville, or France. Here are some examples: Each time angels come to me, they seem reluctant to touch me and  often stay about one meter above the ground. (D. N. P., 36, male,  GTKI Nkamba) These beings can’t really taint themselves with the filth of our world;  they can come and meet you without having to touch the ground.  They stand in space. They appear as persons who avoid any stain or  impurity. (O. R., 26, male, GTKI Talangai) A sixth characteristic of inspired people leads to a questioning of the  role of intellectuals in the Kimbanguist Church. Strikingly, the inspired  respondents all insisted that their mission had proved incompatible with  the pursuit of an education: I attended school up to seventh grade. I had to go to a boarding school  from 1973 onward. But each time I had to go back, I had fits of madness  and had to stay at the cabano [mental institution] until the exam period  was over. . . . I kept insisting, because I loved school so much. . . . This  went on for three years, until I was delivered a certificate of suspension  of studies. Back then—it was 1975—Papa Mfumu a Longo [Diangienda]  was staying in Brazzaville. So my parents and I made an appointment  with him to show him my certificate, but he answered, “A person can- not follow two paths at a time. I am the one who decided things would  happen in this way. You have already reached a certain level, so just stop  where you are.” (B. J., 44, female, pastor, GTKI Talangai) Each time I turned in my paper at the end of a written exam, I got  yelled at by the teacher. . . . I was amazed to see that on my paper there  were lyrics, instead of the lessons I had learned! . . . I reached grade  </page> <page sequence="38"> 118   kimbanguism and the bible eleven. Several times, I saw Papa Simon Kimbangu [in a vision] tell- ing me that school wasn’t for me. But I kept insisting. . . . Once, when  I was in school, I was walking in a corridor when I saw a man storm- ing toward me. He threw me down on the ground, saying, “When will  you understand that school is not for you?” Yet, when falling down,  I wasn’t hurt. . . . Ever since, I  haven’t set foot in a school. (O. R., 26,  male, GTKI Talangai) I was kept at the temple of the Plateaux des quinze ans, and I had no  time to go to school and review for my [math] exam. On the day of the  exam, I went to school. We had an hour and a half, . . . and the good  Lord took up one hour of that. I was sitting in the back, copying my  songs. After an hour, I was aware again of what was going on in the  room. I told myself, “Oh my God, I still have my math to do!” I auto- matically looked at the blackboard, but there seemed to be a second  one right next to it, . . . where the math was solved. . . . It was the first  term in eighth grade, and my average grade was A+. In the second  term, I had an average grade of A+. Can you believe it, just these  two terms gave me enough points to reach the next stage and enter  ninth grade. But when the third term came, the good Lord—well, my  sender [the supernatural being that sent the hymns]—didn’t even let  me go to school! I just kept working for him and dropped out. (B., 38,  male, GTKI Plateaux des quinze ans) The status of an inspired person seems to preclude the acquisition of  knowledge in the conventional framework of school, even though Simon  Kimbangu never preached against school. This metaphysical parameter  seems to conceal spiritual secrets that the spiritual leaders are the only ones  able to reveal. Even when the inspired people escape the calling and do get  a higher education, their mission hounds them and often resurfaces in  the form of a challenge that must be met. For instance, Pastor Iyefa, who  earned two doctoral degrees—in divinity and in history of religions—at the  Sorbonne in Paris and who is now the Kimbanguist chaplain in Kinshasa,  discovered his calling as an inspired person during a spiritual retreat in  France in 1989. He passed away in 2009, but in 1994 he had described his  experience as a spiritual comeuppance: As a result of the academic level I had attained, I had become  Cartesian- minded with regard to Kimbanguism [his religion from  </page> <page sequence="39"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   119 birth] and particularly vis-à -v is Mama Kaku [the pastor supervising  the retreat]. . . . On the third day, while I lay on the ground, I saw two  of my friends from Zaire who had already passed away. They were  beckoning me to follow them. Because I did not remember immedi- ately that these were dead people, I followed them. They showed me  a picture of myself where I found myself really handsome. I couldn’t  even remember when that picture had been taken, but they pointed  to it, saying, “See how handsome you were back in those days? Now  you are too tainted. Go and confess your sins in order to recover your  handsomeness.” At some point, I recovered my spirits and remem- bered they were actually dead, and I got so scared that I went ahead  and confessed my sins. When I came out of confession, I was on my  way to joining my group of nine people when I heard a choir singing.  Their voices were very beautiful, so I asked myself if it was my group  that sang so well! But no—when I had joined them, the singing was  still going on, but it wasn’t my group. I asked them, “Can’t you hear  these beautiful voices singing?” But apparently I was the only one  who could hear them. So [my group] told me to imitate what I heard.  It was a song in Kikongo . . . [Listen to us, listen to us, listen to us, our  God]. So they told me it was a hymn that I was receiving. Ever since  that time, I have been receiving hymns. (Dr. Iyefa, public testimony  delivered at the temple of the Plateaux des quinze ans, Brazzaville) The last feature of inspired people pertains to moral codes. It seems  that the church’s moral precepts apply to them with particular insistence,  whether they are married or single. These are the same commandments, except that if an inspired person  wants to commit a sin, God or Papa Mfumu a Longo will appear to tell  them, “What you want to do is not right” or to thwart what might have  happened. That’s the privilege of an inspired person. The purpose of all  this is to safeguard God’s word. . . . Conversely, a non- inspired person  has no means of being warned by Papa. I, personally, often feel like  playing soccer, but there’s an impediment. Other young people dance,  but there’s no way for me to dance, because for me that’s a ban which  is, so to speak, written in red letters. (O. R., 26, male, GTKI Talangai) While their status as inspired people compels the elect to abide by stringent  moral precepts, it seems that noncompliance with certain rules of the game  </page> <page sequence="40"> 120   kimbanguism and the bible leads to a breakup or a loss of the gift of receiving hymns. Among the inspired  respondents, one had already lost his gift, and another had nearly done so: One day I committed fornication, and I felt threads coming undone  within me. Then, for a month, I did not receive any hymns. It cost  me three days of sacrifice—fasting and praying—for it to come back.  (A. N., 24, male, Chorale des dirigeants, Kinshasa) In the span of two years, I received twenty- four hymns. At a cer- tain point, I fell madly in love with a beautiful young woman, and it  cost me a spiritual breakup. Since then, I  haven’t received any more  hymns. But right now it seems to be coming back. (M., 48, male,  GTKI Talangai)39 Kimbanguist hymns shape the beliefs of church members, while con- forming with the criteria of Christian faith. The songs are the backbone  of the Kimbanguist faith, containing the church’s entire theology and  moral code; the hymns work as the production of knowledge that offers  believers another worldview than the one provided by the scriptures. Con- sidered by the faithful as a mystery, the hymns reflect inspiration rather  than possession, even if there may exist some cases of possession among  Kimbanguists. Finally, the mystical phenomenon of hymn receiving in the Kimbanguist  Church seems to depend on adherence to a moral code; believers who are  determined to be, act, and reflect as Kimbanguists find their justification  in a spirituality and a way of life that make them unique. Situated between  the other two sources of Kimbanguist theology—the scriptures and Dian- gienda’s sermons—inspired hymns remain a dynamic source of doctrine,  evolving with time and continuously offering believers new perspectives,  reasons to keep faith, and the means to strengthen it within the framework  of the church’s moral code. This phenomenon of God- given inspired songs, which seems specific to  the Kimbanguist faith, is worthy of comparison with the Shembe hymns  in South Africa, analyzed by Gerhardus Cornelis Oosthuizen.40 The hymns  of the Nazareth Baptist Church were composed by the founder himself  (Isaiah Shembe) and by his son and successor, Johannes Galilee Shembe,  between 1910 and 1940. These hymns address oppression, the suffering  of Blacks, and Isaiah Shembe’s identity, and they include Zulu nationalis- tic elements and dance songs. But, unlike Kimbanguist hymns, Shembe  </page> <page sequence="41"> three sources of kimbanguist theology   121 hymns seem to be devoid of any paranormal or mystical experiences, even  if the composers sometimes mentioned dreams. Rather, they were written  or composed by the founder and his son—and nobody else—a difference  from the Kimbanguist case. Other hymns that may be compared with Kimbanguist hymns are  those of the Harrist Church. Analyzed in the work of James Krabill, these  resulted from the prophet Harris’s recommendation to transform dógblóo  music and avikam yeje music, two genres traditionally composed and per- formed primarily by women. Thus, in the Harrist Church, hymns were first  an activity for women, who were called compositrices; then, men gave the  hymns a new style altogether. Even though some of the composers inter- viewed by Krabill sometimes received songs in dreams, “hymn composi- tion for Dida Harrists has always contained a strong element of conscious  reflection, of drawing on personal experience, on events from ‘Holy His- tory,’ on the crises and circumstances of everyday life, and then discovering  a way of putting it all into a form which could be shared in song by the  church community as a whole.”41 This type of conscious reflection would  entirely discredit inspired hymns in the context of Kimbanguist theology. The unique combination of metaphysical inspiration, biblical exegesis,  and prophetic tradition in the Kimbanguist Church results in an ever-  growing body of hymns. In this church, hymns operate as a “mode of  expression of Blackness” par excellence, which helps believers to under- stand the identity and mission of Simon Kimbangu.42 </page> </plain_text>
