One of the most significant of these "myths" is that of the meta- morphosed Theseus, whose classical, medieval, and Renaissance image as an unnatural, perfidious, and unfaithful lover and father far outweighed either his accomplishment in organizing the demes of Athens into a single political unit or his reputation as an icon of the virtue of friendship. For ex- ample, Paul A. Olson, in one of the most serious studies made of MND in the twentieth century, claims, "Long before Shakespeare wrote, Theseus had come to embody the reasonable man and the ideal ruler of both his lower nature and his subjects."1 This is similar to the view D. W. Robert- son advanced of the "noble due Theseus" of Chaucer's Knight's Tale . Robertson has suggested that "Theseus belongs, like most of the other materials in the tale, to the tradition of classical iconography. His reputa- tion as the conquering hero of the Thebiad and the wise leader of a city whose 'patron saint' was Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, was firmly established in the Middle Ages. . . .

It would not have been easy for Chaucer to make any abrupt de- parture from the traditional associations of wisdom and virtue which sur- rounded this 'character'; and indeed, he shows no inclination to do so."2 This idealized image of Theseus even in the fourteenth century has, however, been called into question. Henry J. Webb, measuring Theseus by medieval ethical and political theories, saw in Chaucer's "due" "a hint of ignobility" under his "veneer of nobility," and claims, At the time Chaucer portrayed Theseus in the Knight's Tale, the "noble due" was at the height of his glory. . . . But his character soon suffered a change, and by the time he met his death, his name and scutcheon had become tarnished. In the Legend of Good Women , Chaucer termed the once-glorious-conqueror "a traytor" (. L.G.W. , 11. 2171 ff.), and in the Hons of Fame, upon reviewing his whole career, he remarked: "The de vel be hys soules bane!" ( H.F. , 1. 408). It is not surprising, therefore, to find Chaucer retaining or emphasizing or adding to those traits of character in Theseus which were ignoble and cruel. In doing so, he manages to suggest that Theseus, even at the time he was performing his most knightly deeds, was possessed of those frailties which, in later life, caused him to be damned.3 Webb suggests that even during Chaucer's lifetime the image Robertson assigns to the medieval Theseus and Olson accepts as carrying over to the Renaissance Theseus was eroding. Certainly by the 1590's, when Shake- speare wrote his play, that image had faded as more classical texts became familiar to the Elizabethan reader. In Latin texts, in translations, and in allusions, both Shakespeare and his audience would have been aware of the history of Theseus: his birth to ^thra and the question of whether his father was Neptune or .¿Egeus, the ruler of Athens; his youthful hero- worship of Hercules and his determination to become like him; his grow- ing strength which allowed him to lift the rock under which ^Egeus had placed sandals and a sword which would identify the heir who would bring them to Athens. They could have traced his progress toward Athens; his destruction of the ferocious robber Sennis and the subsequent seduction of Sennis' daughter "Perigouna." His desertion of Ariadne, daughter of Minos of Crete, after she had aided him in escaping the labyrinth, was well known enough to have given rise to at least two interpretations of the labyrinth as an emblem of sensuality and luxurious living. His "marriage" to Hippolyta (or Antiope - for there is a confusion as to the name of the Amazonian queen he wed) was found in a variety of sources available to the Renaissance, as were his 2.

Whether in translation, in the original, or through allusion, then, the image of Theseus available to the Renaissance was hardly one of total reason and honor. His exploits during his early youth may have been admirable, but the composite portrait which can be derived of him in his maturity is hardly one which will sup- port Olson's contention that he is an icon of reason which has triumphed over sensuality.4 Shakespeare and many in his audience probably knew the Heroides5 and would have had access to the translations of the Metamor- phoses, to Seneca's Hippolytus (1581), to North's Plutarch's Lives, Gower's Confessio Amantis, Elyot's evaluation of Theseus in The Boke Named the Gouernour, and, depending upon the date of the play, to Spenser's allusion to his role in the death of Hippolytus in The Faerie Queene and John Trussel's depiction of him in his poem, The first Rape of faire Hellen . And the overwhelming stress such sources place on his unnatural, "unkinde" behavior more nearly fits the character Shakespeare portrayed in MND than does Olson's conception of the medieval image of an ideal knightly Theseus that had not changed appreciably over a period of about two hundred years. Madeleine Doran, who claims that the Theseus of MND "does not at once suggest the Theseus of classical legend," contends that "Shakespeare has converted Theseus into a Renaissance prince," and that "To this con- ception of a prince keeping court, Shakespeare has subordinated other important aspects of the legend - Theseus as hero, a second Hercules, and Theseus as false lover, the abandoner of women. These traditional aspects of Theseus are not neglected in the play, but they are included only to 4. Olson interprets MND in terms of "iconological referents" and sees the question of male sovereignty in marriage established by the initial scene between Theseus and Hippolyta. Theseus, he contends, represents the reasonable soul; Hippolyta, the concupiscent soul. Only when the two are in harmony can marriage succeed - that is, when reason controls sensual- ity; see pp. 98-103. 5. Robert K. Root, Classical Mythology in Shakespeare , Yale Studies in English, 19 (1903; rpt. New York, 1965), pp. 6-8, assumes that Shakespeare learned his mythology from Ovid. H. R. D. Anders, Shakespeare's Books , Schriften der Deutschen Shakespeare-Gesellschaft, Band 1 (Berlin, 1904), p. 21, contends that he knew both the translations and the originals of Ovid's works. In addition to the Golding translation of the Metamorphoses , there was a 1567 translation of the Heroides - the Heroycall Epistles.</page><page sequence="4">D'Orsay W. Pearson 279 enrich the background and supply verisimilitude."6 An analysis of The- seus' actions in MND will negate Professor Doran's claim that Theseus is a metamorphosed, ideal Renaissance prince. But she does bring into her analysis two factors worth noting. The first is her contention that the "very richness of the allusive texture [of MND], with its echoes of the classics too extensive and too adroitly managed to be merely casual recol- lections of schoolboy reading, strongly suggests that Shakespeare meant to give his play a classical flavor in keeping with its setting at the court of Theseus, and so to fulfill the artistic requirements of verisimilitude and decorum" (p. 113). The second is her admission that the traditional aspect of Theseus as the false lover is not neglected by Shakespeare in his play. Professor Doran conjectures that in the original production of MND, Theseus and the members of his court may have been dressed in "ancient costume" (p. 130), since Puck was to identify Demetrius by the Athenian garments he was wearing. Still further evidence that this was quite prob- ably true is Titania's reference to Hippolyta as Oberon' s "buskin' d mistress and . . . warrior love,"7 an allusion to dress unnoticed by Miss Doran as a part of the verisimilitude prevailing in numerous depictions of classical figures. As she observes, there was a genuine sense of historical perspective in the sixteenth century (p. 130). In fact, such a sense existed even prior to the sixteenth century. A Florentine Picture Chronicle , which Sir Sidney Colvin attributed to a mid-fifteenth-century engraver, includes a two- page engraving of Theseus and Hippolyta (or Antiope), who stand facing each other before the walls of Athens. Theseus is garbed in thigh-length metal armor of a decidedly Oriental opulence; Hippolyta, in this instance, wears the full-length draped gown of classical Greece.8 Shakespeare's 6.

Colvin s comment on Plates xxxvm and xxxix is that "the artist has forgotten her name and even boggles over her general description as an Amazon [AMAXOHE]. Theseus and his enemy, afterwards his bride, stand apart facing the spectator, each in an attitude - and Theseus with a scowl - of heroic defiance." Plates xlvi and XLvn (again, a two-page engraving) depict Theseus, this time with Ariadne. The com- posite drawing encompasses the entire Ariadne-Theseus episode. Theseus stands on the left, holding a ball of thread representing Ariadne's aid in freeing him; in the background Ariadne stands on a cliff waving her scarf tied to a stick as she watches Theseus sail away from her; and in the background on the left Theseus sails his black-sailed ship into the port at Athens and one can see his father, ¿Egeus, for whom the black sail meant Theseus had failed</page><page sequence="5">28o English Literary Renaissance reference to the "buskin'd" warrior love is perhaps even more in keeping with her classical character; the queen of a race of warrior women, she, like Atalanta, would have preferred the freedom of movement shorter garments and high-laced sandals would have given her. That Shakespeare makes direct and specific references to classical costume would indicate that he intended his Athenians to be costumed as Athenians. Miss Doran's second point - that Theseus' character as a false lover is not ignored in the play - is equally important. When Oberon and Titania meet in Act n, Oberon accuses Titania of being responsible for Theseus' infidelities, Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigenia, whom he ravished? And make him with fair yEgle break his faith, With Ariadne, and Antiopa? (ii.i.77-80) And though Titania replies that "These are the forgeries of jealousy . . ." (n.i.81), are they? Why should Shakespeare, deliberately, it would appear, strive for classical verisimilitude in setting and mention four of Theseus' former loves if there were no valid reason for doing so? If Theseus is the meta- morphosed prince Miss Doran envisions, or the icon of reason which Olson would make him, both this pre-Christian atmosphere and the al- lusion to Theseus' traditional behavior pattern would be superfluous, de- tracting from the image we are told the dramatist was attempting to create. Even Dante could allow the most reasonable of pagan philosophers no more consolation than the outer ring of Hades; and Theseus is hardly the counterpart of Socrates or Aristotle. Yet what if Shakespeare de- liberately created for his play a pagan world ruled by the anthropomorphic deities Oberon and Titania and included in his drama a deliberate reminder of Theseus' traditional infidelity? If, as I contend, he did, MND then be- comes an even more serious and ironic comedy than has heretofore been suggested, since for many critics it has been merely an airy, fairy offering - an occasional play - designed for performance at a noble wedding. As Robertson observes, it is difficult to present artistically a dramatic character whose image is at variance with the image a culture holds of him. in his mission, throwing himself into the sea in despair. This drawing is interesting in that, unlike any of the others in the collection, the central personage (Theseus) is drawn with slightly slanted, almond-shaped eyes. It could be that the artist was attempting to convey some element of the "luxurious" in Theseus' personality by resorting to stereotyped features associated with Near Eastern potentates like Sardanapalus.</page><page sequence="6">D'Orsay W . Pearson 281 The critic's obligation, then, becomes that of discovering as accurately as possible the whole, composite portrait an age held of a figure. And the Renaissance image of Theseus as the unfaithful lover and husband, the abandoner of women, and the unnatural father was relatively widespread even in vernacular literature. A play-goer did not have to be a classical scholar to know that the Theseus of classical legend was not an icon of reason triumphing over sensuality but was instead very poor husband material. Thus, if Shakespeare's play is to be regarded as a 4 'marriage play," a full examination of Theseus' reputation and his characterization within the drama is essential to an examination of the play as a whole. Shakespeare appears to have anticipated an audience's awareness of Theseus' classical reputation as a part of the reaction to his drama. First there is his protagonist's insistence that he cannot break Athenian law, followed by his reversal of that law at the end of the play as he overrides Egeus' opposition to the marriage of Hermia and Lysander. In MND, the dramatist has merely "frozen" Theseus for the three-day span of time preceding his marriage to his Amazonian bride. He has sketched briefly Theseus' past reputation in Oberon's speech to Titania in ii.i, and at the end of his drama leaves his fairy supernaturais blessing the bride-bed of the Athenian ruler and his Amazonian consort. But for an audience aware of the remainder of Theseus' history, the play has not ended. Unlike the non- legendary characters in a comedy like Much Ado About Nothing, char- acters who have no existence outside the play world of which they are a part, Theseus possessed that legendary-historical existence which made it impossible for an audience to walk away from MND with the euphoric notion that "they lived happily ever after." That audience, at least in part, knew better. An examination of Theseus' reputation is essential to understanding such a reaction. In both classical sources and vernacular translations and treatises available to the Renaissance Englishman, Theseus is often praised for the youthful prowess he exhibited; but he is then criticized for his lust, his perfidy, and his tyranny as he grew older. That Shakespeare and his contemporaries were familiar with Chaucer's Knighťs Tale , one of the sources often cited for MND , does not neces- sarily argue that they might have known the "Legend of Ariadne"; she, according to the rubric, is identified simply and ironically as " Ariadne de Athenes ." This lament, a part of the Legend of Good Women , treats of one of the episodes in Theseus' life which apparently had an unusual appeal to various poets - Theseus' desertion of the Cretan princess Ariadne after she</page><page sequence="7">Theseus, as depicted in A Florentine Picture Chronicle</page><page sequence="8">Hippolyta, as depicted in A Florentine Picture Chronicle</page><page sequence="9">284 English Literary Renaissance had aided him in overcoming the Minotaur and escaping from the laby- rinth. The lament contains some of Chaucer's very effective ironic touches. For example, Theseus recounts to Ariadne how he had loved her even before he met her, and concludes, "Now have I yow, and also have ye me, / My dere herte, of Athenes duchesse!"9 Ariadne, the poet tells us, . . smyleth at his stedefastnesse, / And at his hertely wordes, and his chere . . (11. 2223-24). Her belief in his vows and his "stedefastnesse" are re- paid, however, when Theseus deserts her for her sister Phaedra; the poet's commentary upon that desertion is, Whil that this Adryane aslepe lay, And to his contre-ward he sayleth blyve - A twenty devel-way the wynd him dry ve! - And fond his fader drenched in the se. (11. 2175-78) If they were unfamiliar with this evaluation, however, it is certain that they had access to the tale in a very similar form in John Gower's Confessio Amantis. Shakespeare, if one can accept Pericles as a part of the authentic canon, drew upon the Confessio , Book iv, for the story of Apollonius of Tyre; and Gower functions as the Chorus of the play. Book v of the Confessio includes the tale of Theseus and Ariadne. In this book, Gower treats the vice of love avarice in its various forms- jealousy, covetousness (which includes marrying for wealth), perjury (making false vows which betray the beloved), parsimony, and ingratitude. This latter, according to Genius, is a major lapse of natural law; the lover guilty of ingratitude is "unkinde" since even animals respond to generosity. One of the two tales Genius employs to illustrate this unnatural vice in love is that of Theseus and his escape from the labyrinth with Ariadne's help. According to Gower, when Theseus arrived on Crete, his appearance gladdened Ariadne. After being entertained for a day or two by Minos, Theseus "in prive stede" spoke with Ariadne, with the result that "Al prively between hem tweie / The ferste flour he tok aweye," having sworn that "while he live mighte / He shoulde hire take for his wif. . . ."10 However, once Theseus has enjoyed Ariadne's love and accepted her aid, he abandons her for her 9. LI. 2121-22. The "Legend of Ariadne," despite some effective ironic touches, illustrates some careless handling of the Theseus legend. At one point, he is called a "semely knyght" who is "twenty yer and thre" (11. 2074-75), yet in another instance, Phaedra is to be wedded to his "sone" (1. 2099) as soon as they reach Athens. References are to The Complete Poetical Works of Geoffrey Chaucer , ed. F. N. Robinson (Boston, 1933). 10. Confessio Amantis , ed. Russell A.

Gower's judgment of such behavior suggests that the action offends divine law: And al was this on him along, Which was to love unkinde so, Whereof the wrong shal everemo Stonde in Cronique of remembrance. And ek it asketh a vengance To ben unkinde in loves cas, So as Theseiis thanne was, Al thogh he were a noble kniht; For he the lawe of loves riht, Forfeted hath in alle weie, That Adriagne he putte aweie, Which was so gret unkinde dede. ... (11. 5468-79) Theseus is delineated three times within eleven lines as being "unkinde" or unnatural - inhuman. And Gower, like Chaucer, suggests some super- natural vengeance for such unkindly behavior. Chaucer, with all the power of understatement, had said Theseus "fond his fader drenched in the se." Gower's judgment is more vague, and depends upon an awareness of the entire Theseus legend for effect. He writes, ... as I rede, Fedra, the which hir Soster is, He tok in stede of hire, and this Fel afterward to mochel teene. (11. 5480-83) This image of the "unkind" and inconstant and ungrateful Theseus must be recognized as existing simultaneously with the more idealized portraits of Theseus as the chivalric knight of Boccaccio's Teseide or Lydgate's Siege of Thebes. His inability to remain faithful in love must be taken into account to balance the praise he received in the fourteenth- century Ovide moralisé as a Christ figure and an emblem of the virtue of friendship. As Webb has suggested, even Chaucer appears to employ in the Knighťs Tale a criticism of his friendship with Peirithous as a source of injustice, since it is "a spontaneous reaction to the ťpreyere' of a boyhood friend"11 which leaves Palamon still imprisoned. And though Chaucer incorporates several references to the friendship of Theseus and Peirithous into the Knighťs Tale, it is difficult to accept Richard L. Hoffman's claim that Theseus' attempt to rescue his friend from Hell "must have seemed to Chaucer the most powerful and engaging means of emphasizing the 11. Webb, p. 294.</page><page sequence="11">286 English Literary Renaissance virtuous or 'manly' love which characterized his hero."12 Viewed in Renaissance perspective, the descent into hell to rescue Peirithous from the torments of his own folly exhibits a doting friendship - a vice by excess - which is carried out at the expense of justice and natural law; he left both kingdom and wife and returned to find Phaedra accusing Hippolytus of ravishing her. While the orientation of the Theseus legend as treated by Chaucer in The Legend of Good Women and by Go wer in the Confessio Amantis can be observed in all the Renaissance treatments of Theseus, the idealized The- seus often receives short shrift; or, to repeat Webb's phrase, the Renais- sance writers appear to lay heavy stress on the "frailties which, in later life, caused him to be damned." On the one hand, Theseus is praised for the promise of his youth - in short, for his activities up to the time he arrives in Athens and identifies himself as ^geus' son - but a proportionately larger space is given to his "unkinde" behavior, beginning with his jour- ney to Crete and ending with his willing the death of his blameless son Hippolytus. Golding's translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses is an excellent illustration of this claim. In his moralized introduction, Golding stressed the youthful reputation of Theseus: "The deeds of Theseus are a spurre to prowesse, and a glasse / How princes sonnes and noblemen their youthful years should passe."13 Again, in Book vn, in conjunction with Medea's attempt to rid herself of the son of her protector iEgeus, the text refers to Theseus' "Knightly force" (1. 514); and in the account of his clearing the land of robbers from the Ionian to the Aegean seas he is referred to as a "worthie knight" (1. 517). These deeds, however, are the deeds of his youth. In Book viii, in which the account of Theseus' escape from the labyrinth with the aid of Ariadne is found, the translation runs: "... unkinde / And cruel creature that he was he left her post alone / Upon the shore" (11. 335-37). This "unkinde" finds full fruition in Book xv, where Hippolytus gives an account of his death and "rebirth" as Virbie (twice man). Hip- 12. "Ovid and Chaucer's Myth of Theseus and Pirithous," ELN , 2 (June, 1965), 257. The Ovide moralise appears to have had little effect upon the literary treatments of Theseus during the Renaissance. The relationship between the two friends is ignored at the expense of his amours and especially of his desertion of Ariadne, which continued to be a subject which appealed to poets even in the seventeenth century. See, for example, William Cartwright's "Ariadne deserted by Theseus," The Plays and Poems of William Cartwright , ed. G. Blakemore Evans (Madison, Wise., 1951), pp. 488-91. 13. Shakespeare's Ovid , ed. W. D. Rouse (1961; rpt. New York, 1966), p. 4, 11. 155-56. Olson cites this passage in support of his view of Theseus, but ignores the passages which are quoted later.</page><page sequence="12">D'Orsay W . Pearson 287 polytus says, "If thou / In talk by hap haste heard of one Hippolytus ere now, / That through his fathers lyght beleefe, and stepdames craft was slayne, / . . . My father by and by, / Condemning mee, did banish mee his Realme without cause whye, / And on my going like a fo did ban me bitterly" (11. 554-66). Hippolytus goes on to recount how Neptune's monsters frightened his horses and brought about his death. Even when he was brought back to life, he was made to look old, and his face was left in "such a plyght" that none might know him. Ovid's Heroides contain a number of references to Theseus' lechery and treachery - his tendency to seduce and then desert woman after woman. The "Second Complaint," that of Phyllis to Demophoön (Hippolytus), the son of Theseus by his Amazonian bride, finds Phyllis bewailing her desertion by Hippolytus: "Of all the great deeds in the long career of your sire, nothing has made impress upon your nature but the leaving of his Cretan bride. The only deed that draws forth his excuse, that only you admire you in him; you act the heir to your father's guile, perfidious one."14 Ariadne, in the "Tenth Complaint," stands on the shores of Naxos watching Theseus' ship sail into the distance without her: . . . you said to me: "By these very perils of mine, I swear that, so long as both of us live, thou shalt be mine!" We both live, Theseus, and I am not yours ! - if indeed a woman lives who is buried by the treason of a perjured mate. (p. 127) Again, when Oenone cries out to Paris, in the "Fifth Complaint," because he has deserted her for Helen, she ironically stresses Theseus' reputation for lust and treachery: "Theseus - unless I mistake the name - one Theseus, even before, had stolen her away from her father's land. Is it to be thought she was rendered back a maid, by a man young and eager?" (p. 67). Still again, in Phaedra's lament to Hippolytus, Phaedra appeals for the love of her stepson by referring to the fate of his Amazonian mother. Theseus, she says, was not even wed to the Amazon, so that Hippolytus, a bastard, cannot inherit his father's throne (p. 53). Seneca, following the same legend, makes Hippolytus an illegitimate child in his tragedy, translated in 1581 as The Fourth and Most Ruthful Tragedy ofL. Annaeus Seneca, entituled Hippolytus. In this play Hippolytus is the son of Antiopa and Theseus and is characterized as a votary of Diana, 14. Ovid, Heroides and Amores , trans.

His stepmother Phaedra has conceived an incestuous love for him during the absence of Theseus, who, according to Seneca, is at the opening of the play still imprisoned in Hades for his part in the rape of Helen and the intended rape of Persephone. Theseus is re- leased and arrives home, where Phaedra accuses her stepson of ravishing her. Theseus in anger calls upon his father Neptune to send sea monsters to frighten Hippolytus' horses; Hippolytus is thrown from his chariot and dismembered. Phaedra immediately relents, confesses, and then stabs her- self, leaving Theseus to bemoan his loss. It is to this episode that Spenser refers in The Faerie Queene (i.v.35-39), in connection with the damnation of Aesculapius, who, because he had "resurrected" Hippolytus, had been thrust into Hades for his presumption. Virgil, in the Aeneid , confined Theseus to the pit of the damned in Hades - the bottomless pit - along with those who "were killed for adultery, took part in militant treason" or "made bold to break faith with their masters": Some have to roll huge rocks; some whirl round, spreadeagled On spokes of wheels: the tragic Theseus sits, condemned to Spend eternity in that chair: the poor wretch, Phlegyas, Admonishes all, crying out through the mirk in solemn avowal, "Be warned by me! Learn justice, and not to belittle the gods!"15 Virgil claims that those Rhadamanthus has under his harsh rule are those who escaped serious punishment in life. Theseus shares his torment in Hades with those who are described as immane nefas, individuals who com- mitted monstrous actions against divine law - monstrous criminals. It was quite possibly this passage from Virgil which Elyot had in mind when, in The Boke Named the Gouernour (1531), he cited Theseus as one of the figures in classical literature who would serve as object lessons for noble youth: What shal be more drede, than the terrible visages of Cerberous, Gorgon, Megera, and the other furies and monsters? Howe shall he abhorre tyranny, fraude, auarice, when he doth se the paynes of duke Theseus, Prometheus, Sisiphus, and suche other tourmented for their dissolute and vicious lyuyng?16 Elyot later gave brief praise to Theseus' youthful prowess as a hunter in the Caledonian boar hunt (p. 189). 15. Bk. vi, 11. $66-69, 608-20. The translation is that of C. Day Lewis (Oxford, 1952); Lewis' "tragic Theseus" fits the Senecan pattern, for Virgil's infelix Theseus could more appropriately be rendered "ill-omened Theseus" or "Theseus, bringer of misfortune." 16.

Pearson 289 Again, Elyoťs dual treatment of Theseus is typical of even the com- prehensive "lives" of him which were available in the sixteenth century. Montlyard, for example, in his translation of Conti's Mythologiae , praises Theseus' youthful exploits as he seeks to imitate his hero Hercules. But Theseus' more mature actions are subject to serious criticism, not only in Montlyard's treatment of the life of Theseus, but in his portrait of Nep- tune, whose son Theseus was sometimes said to be. Referring to the episode in which Theseus requested the aid of Neptune in destroying his own son Hippolytus, Montlyard wrote, Car comment peut estre homme de bien celuy qui iuge ven cause dont il n'a connoissance? ou qui à la appétit de ses amis faict morir ou condamné vn innocent, vn homme de bien, chaste &amp; tempere: comment ne sera - il pas meschant &amp; detestable? Ce ne fut donc pas vn Dieu sage que Neptun, non-pas mesme bon ni iuste, s'il accorda une si desraisonable &amp; inique requeste à son fils Thesee. . . .17 Montlyard interprets the Cretan labyrinth as an emblem of the life of man which "est plaine de purplexité, &amp; empestreé d'vne infinité d' bourrasques" (x, 755).

But there is also strong comment upon his infidelity: And yet we finde many other reportes touching the mariages of Theseus, whose begin- nings had no great good honest ground, neither fell out their endes very fortunate. . . . For we reade that he tooke away Anaxo the Troezenian, and that after he killed Sinnis and Cercyon, he tooke their daughters perforce: and that he dyd also marye Peribaea, the mother of Ajax, and afterwards Pherebaea, and loppa the daughter of Iphicles. And they blame him much also, for that he so lightly he forsooke his wife Ariadne, for the love of iEgles the daughter of Panopaeus. . . . Lastly, he tooke awaye Hellen: which ravishement filled all the Realme of Attica with warres, and finally was the very occasion that forced him to forsake his countrye, and brought him at the length to his ende, as we will tell you hereafter.19 Plutarch, faced with a variety of legends about Theseus and the Amazons, cites first the claim that Antiopa was an Amazonian whom Hercules had granted to Theseus for his bravery in war against them. He then continues: But the more parte of the other Historiographers, namely Hellanicus, Pherecides, and Herodotus, doe write, that Theseus went thither [to the island of the Amazons] alone, after Hercules voyage, and that he tooke this Amazone prisoner, which is likeliest to be true. For we doe not finde that any other who went this jorney with him, had taken any Amazone prisoner besides him selfe. (p. 55) He then considers the Amazonian war which was said to have taken place in the environs of Athens itself, and cites the historian Clidemus as his authority that after four months of battle, "peace was taken betwene them by meanes of one of the women called Hyppolita. For this Historiographer calleth the Amazone which Theseus maried, Hyppolita, and not Antiopa. Nevertheless, some saye that she was slayne (fighting on Theseus side) with a darte, by another called Molpadia" (p. 57). Plutarch also cites a theory that the Amazons made war on Theseus "to revenge the injurie he dyd to their Queene Antiopa, refusing her, to marye with Phaedra," and that "It is very true, that after the death of Antiopa, Theseus married Phaedra, having had before of Antiopa a sonne called Hippolytus, or as the Poet Pindarus writeth, Demophon" (p. 58). According to North's translation, Plutarch's final evaluation of Theseus, in his comparison between the Athenian and Romulus, is not totally flattering. He gives him credit for his deeds of bravery in his youth and his political success in Athens. But he finds Theseus negligent in the death of his father iEgeus, because Theseus forgot to hoist the white sail which was 19.

Also against the Athenian statesman was this: "Furthermore, Theseus faults touching women and ravishments, of the twaine [Theseus and Romulus], had the lesse shadowe and culler of honestie. . . . [His ravishments] dyd geve men occasion to suspect that his wommanisheness was rather to satisfie lust, then of any great love" (p. 116). The nadir of Theseus' reputation in the Renaissance probably was reached in 1595, with the publication of John Trussell's The first Rape of faire Hellen. Theseus' "rape" of Helen, in most classical and Renaissance treatments of the incident, was actually a kidnapping. She was too young for marriage, and he took her to stay with his mother until she was of age to wed. The seizure was part of an enterprise conducted jointly by Theseus and his friend Peirithous, both of whom wished to marry Helen. They drew lots for her, and Theseus won; years later, when Helen was of marriageable age, Peirithous reminded Theseus of another part of their enterprise - that whoever won Helen was to aid the other in obtaining a wife. Persephone, Hades' wife, was decided upon, and Peirithous de- scended to Hades to abduct her. Here, Theseus and his friend were bound to a "chair of forgetfulness," where they remained for four years until Hercules entered the underworld and rescued them. It was during this absence, in Seneca's tragedy, that Phaedra developed her unholy love for Hippolytus. Trussell's account, however, treats Theseus' abduction of Helen as actual ravishment; she never leaves the environs of her father's kingdom. The account is an obvious imitation of the various laments in the Mirrour for Magistrates; in it, the ghost of Helen tells her sad story. Theseus, she says, had come as a visitor to her father's kingdom when she was almost "eight score moneths" old (about thirteen).20 When Theseus saw her, he "no sooner had obtainde a view, / of my surpassing common comlinesse: / But he ex tempore began to sue / to gaine through me loues fained hap- pinesse" (11. 85-88). She calls him "disloyal, false and treacherous, / vnkind, vnconstant and vncurteous: / Luxurious, lustfull, and most lecherous, / vntrue, vngratefull, vile and vicious" (11. 97-100). Finding her alone, she says 20. See SQ, 8 (1957), 407-48, for the full text of the poem and M. A. Shaaber's intro- ductory commentary. Trussell's treatment may have been influenced by Oenone's hint in the Heroides , or by the words of Hippolytus (Virbie) in Book xv of the Metamorphoses : "That by twoo noble princes sonnes shee twyce had ravisht beene" (1. 257).</page><page sequence="17">292 English Literary Renaissance He suckt the sweet &amp; let me keep the sowre, He pluckt the blossome and left me the braunch, I had the stalke, he stole away the floure, wherewith his marrow-fretting lust to staunch.

(11. 169-76) Theseus, at this point, has out-Tar quined the villain of Shakespeare's Lucrece' his rape of the nubile beauty is followed by a swift - and safe - departure. Throughout these various treatments of the episodes in Theseus' mature years, writers are prone to stress his unkindness - that is, his unnatural behavior - and his ingratitude as errors either against what one would expect from man as man or as errors against some code other than his own. This might be Gower's code of amour courtois ; Virgil's unwritten law of the gods; or Elyot's code of princely ethical conduct, derived from a syn- thesis of Christian and classical ethics. In each instance, some ultimate explicit or implicit moral judgment is present; and that judgment is negative. Shakespeare's Theseus is no different. His opening speech, which so many critics have viewed as establishing a frame of order against which the disorder of young love can be projected, thrusts him immediately into the Renaissance stereotype. Speaking to Hippolyta of their approaching marriage, Theseus says, Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in Another moon; but O, methinks, how slow This old moon wanes. She lingers my desires, Like to a stepdame or a dowager Long withering out a young man's revenue, (i.i.1-6) Desires , as has been shown, is a significant word in Theseus' history; desires and lust were more likely to be equated in the Renaissance mind than were desires and love. Unless they were controlled, desires were the mark of the man given over completely to concupiscence; and de Monti- yard's luxurieux is a fitting epithet for the legendary Athenian ruler. Even more significant than the term desires, however, are the images Theseus employs in this initial speech to describe those desires. The moon, which delays them, is likened to "a step-dame or a dowager / Long withering out</page><page sequence="18">D'Orsay W. Pearson 293 a young man's revenue." These images immediately project Theseus into the ethical frame Gower had assigned him - love avarice and in particular that form of love avarice known as ingratitude, a definite breach of natural law for which some punishment must be forthcoming. The young heir who would resent the normal and customary settlement made on the widow of his father - whether she be "step-dame" or his mother - would be "unnatural" in several ways. First, and especially if the tie were one of blood, he would reveal resentment toward an individual to whom he owed a definite natural obligation. Second, the claim that the widow's jointure would "long wither out" the heir's revenues suggests both avarice and prodigality in him - a vicious prodigality since a widow's jointure, held only for her life, was customarily much less than the capital estate which the heir had inherited. Such images, when employed by Theseus, underscore his own reputation for ingratitude in love - the profligacy and unfaithfulness which are scarcely appropriate for an ideal lover, much less a constant husband. And if his first words suggest his reputation for unfaithfulness and un- natural patterns of affection, his later behavior in the opening scene is designed to add to that image of viciousness. First of all, his love for Hip- poly ta breeds no corresponding charity toward other lovers; and his re- action to the demands that Egeus makes - that Hermia be forced to marry Demetrius or face the penalty of death - is tyranically unmerciful. Hermia is presented with a choice. She can accept a relationship which violates her natural preference for Lysander, or she can enter a convent where, Theseus tells her, she will "live a barren sister" (i.i.72) all her life. Added to love avarice and lack of charity is injustice: Theseus' "de- sires" for Hippolyta have caused him to neglect his duties as ruler of Athens. When Lysander accuses Demetrius of having wooed and then spurned Helena, Theseus admits: I must confess that I have heard so much, And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof; But, being over-full of self-affairs, My mind did lose it. (i.i. 111-14) Yet not even Lysander's reminder brings him to act as a ruler should and demand that justice be performed in the fulfilling of Demetrius' vows. Instead, he departs with a second reminder to Hermia that she faces either an unwanted marriage or barren sisterhood, and takes both Egeus and Demetrius away with him, for "I must employ you in some business / Against our nuptial, and confer with you / Of something nearly that</page><page sequence="19">294 English Literary Renaissance concerns yourselves" (i.i.124-26). In his initial frame appearance, then, Shakespeare's Theseus is portrayed as neither a good prince nor a poten- tially faithful husband. His love avarice, apparent in his impatience and suggested by his imagery, reveals an inversion of ideal lordship; he has allowed private vice to destroy public virtue.21 If Shakespeare's initial portrayal of Theseus fits the Renaissance stereo- type rather than the critics' myths, his final evaluation of his Duke of Athens is equally conventional. To the human element in the play world, there is no apparent reason for his impulsive shift from tyranny to charity in agreeing that the four young lovers may marry whomever they choose. On one level, this impulsiveness reflects his unreasoned response to Phaedra's accusation that Hippolytus has ravished her, even though the apparently impulsive decision within MND does not have the fatal con- sequences that it had in Seneca's tragedy or in that of Euripides (with which the Renaissance was unfamiliar). However, any individual ac- quainted with mythological tradition was aware of how often the pagan deities were blamed for mortal behavior. The Renaissance sonneteer blamed Cupid and not himself for the pangs of unrequited love he suf- fered; the favorites of various gods and goddesses more often than not exhibited the same character traits for which their protectors were known. Medieval and Renaissance astrology took into account the potential char- acter traits which resulted from being born under signs associated with various planets; and those signs were often in conflict, resulting ostensibly in influencing the pleasures or pains of those they "ruled." Thus, the idea that two pagan deities and their contention could affect the individuals whose guardians they were would not have struck Shakespeare's audience as being particularly unique. But such deities were not infallible; pos- sessing passions just as mankind did, they could wrangle and show jealousy and infidelity and hatred just as easily as they could show love and con- cord. When gods fall out, mortals can do no less; the harmony of the gods is a prerequisite to the harmony of man. Theseus and Hippolyta were married in a play world where concord depended upon the harmony which existed between the supernaturais 21. Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics , trans. Martin Ostwald (New York, 1962), asserts that "even if the good is the same for the individual and the state, the good of the state clearly is the greater and more perfect thing to attain and safeguard" (1.2). See also Alexander Barclay, The Mirr our of Good Manners (1570) Spenser Society Publications, No. 38 (London 1885), p. 9, where justice is clearly associated with the "lawe . . . of kinde" which, among other things, includes the idea that men owe "loue moste speciali / To such as of their bloud they knowe nerest of all. . .</page><page sequence="20">D'Orsay W. Pearson 295 who ruled it, Titania and Oberon. In that play world, the fairy king and queen have, like the mortals whose geniuses they are, affections and pas- sions which have caused them to quarrel. The result of that quarrel dis- rupts the entire heirarchy of natural order, from the seasons to man and the ruler of man. The "amity" results in concord; but because they do possess the affections and passions of man and are capable of being willful and argumentative and guileful and affectionate, contention can arise again. And if the critics who see Oberon as the representative of reason and Titania as his opposite, sensuality,22 are correct, Shakespeare was working far more carefully than has hitherto been realized. For in assigning The- seus a guardian genius, Titania, who is responsible for his past infidelities, the dramatist is deliberately pointing up the perfidy and fraud in his pro- tagonist's legendary amours and at the same time pointing toward the next quarrel of his anthropomorphic deities and Theseus' next infidelity. Nowhere is this more evident than in the final action of the play, the fairy blessing of the marriage beds. C. L. Barber, who sees in the quarrel between Titania and Oberon "the usual weakness of pageant personages - a compelling love for royal per- sonages . . . ,"23 views the fairies' blessing as a "lustration," in which the "associations inevitably attaching to the word ['consecrate'] suggest also 22.

The "triple goddess" is Diana- Luna-Hecate, the "triple Hecate's team" of Puck's speech in MND (v.i.391). Robert K. Root, Classical Mythology in Shakespeare , p. 52, observes that Titania is employed twice as a synonym for Diana in Ovid's Metamorphoses , although her name does not appear in Gold- ing's translation (p. 52). Minor White Latham, however, would deny Shakespeare's Titania any dark or sensual qualities; see The Elizabethan Fairies (New York, 1930), p. 181. Peter Mortenson, " Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay : Festive Comedy and 'Three-Form'd Luna'," ELR , 2 (Spring, 1972), 203, n. 14, cites "the playfully ominous disorders of love as well as the contention of Oberon and Titania" which take place under the moon; see the reproduc- tion of "three-form'd Luna" (Diana-Luna-Hecate) from Vincenzo Cartari, Le Imagini de i Dei de gli Antichi (1571), facing p. 200. As Mortenson notes, these three aspects are "celestial Luna; earthly Diana, chaste goddess of love and beauty; and underworld Hecate, witch goddess of death, destruction, and necromancy" (pp. 202-03). However, during the Renais- sance, Hecate as goddess of witchcraft had also come to embody a strong connotation of excess sensuality, illustrated in the growing myths of the Sabbat, incubi, and succubi. See, for example, Henri Bouget, An Examen of Witches (1590), trans. E. Allen Ashwin (London, 1929), pp. 53-61, or Nicholas Remy, Demonolatry (1595), trans. E. Allen Ashwin (London, 1930), pp. 42-66. Merritt Y. Hughes, "Spenser's Acrasia and the Circe of the Renaissance," JHI, 4 (1943), 381-99, also explores the connection between the sensual life and witchcraft. 23.

Yet to those in Shake- speare's audience who knew the subsequent history of Theseus, this scene would have been potentially the most ironic one within the drama. Titania and Oberon go to bless the bride bed of Theseus and Hippolyta: To the best bride bed will we, Which by us shall blessed be; And the issue there create Ever shall be fortunate. So shall all the couples three Ever true in loving be. (v.i.410-15) Yet the "issue" ofthat "blessed" bride bed was Hippolytus, the son whom, as has been noted, Theseus' later wife Phaedra unjustly accused of ravishing her, so that Theseus unjustly brought about his own son's death. The fate of Hippolyta, who with Theseus was to be "ever true in loving," is more obscure. Plutarch clearly states that Hippolytus was the son of the Amazon Theseus married, but after noting that Clidemus' 'calleth the AmazoneWhich Theseus maried, Hyppolita and not Antiopa," he reverts to calling The- seus' Amazonian bride Antiopa. Seneca, too, calls Theseus' Amazonian mate Antiopa, but suggests for her a very violent end: "Now, now, to thee supernal Jove most hearty thankes I yeeld, / That with my first Antiope to dreary death I quelde. . . ."24 Shakespeare in ii.i.80 makes Antiopa a predecessor of Hippolyta, although in the majority of sources available to him Antiopa, Hippolytus' mother, is either called Hippolyta or is confused with Antiopa, as in Plutarch. The "due Theseus" of Chau- cer's Knighťs Tale is wed to "Ypolita," and in Boccaccio's De Casibus Illustrium Virum Hippolyta is clearly identified as the mother of Hippoly- tus. Boccaccio groups Theseus among those whom concursus infoelicum brings to defeat; others include Jason and Medea, and Jocasta, Laius, and Oedipus. In the De Casibus it is Phaedra's incestuous love for Hippolytus which brings about Theseus' exile from Athens. This confusion about the name of Theseus' Amazonian bride, with its attendant emphasis in most sources that Phaedra was her immediate suc- cessor, may itself throw some light on the play. The sources most fre- quently cited for Shakespeare's treatment of the mature lovers in his play - Plutarch and Chaucer - attribute different names to Theseus' Ama- zonian bride. An examination of the sources available to the dramatist, 24. The Fourth , and Most Ruthful Tragedy of L. Annaeus Seneca , Entituled Hippolytus , trans.

Pearson 297 however, indicates that Antiopa was more frequently cited as the Athenian ruler's "wife" and mother of his son Hippolytus, and there is a general insistence that the Amazon who was Theseus' wife was immediately suc- ceeded by Phaedra. Shakespeare, in choosing Hippolyta as the name of his character's bride and naming Antiopa as an earlier love he had deserted, could have been working carelessly, ignoring this chronology. Or he could have chosen his Amazon's name deliberately, working to stress Hippolyta as the feminine form of Hippolytus, thus deliberately recalling the story of the son of the marriage the play celebrates. Such an association, arising from an awareness of Theseus' later action, would make Oberon's "And the issue there create / Ever shall be fortunate" a ghastly reminder of the fate of the issue of a bride bed blessed by the supernaturais Titania and Oberon. (Seneca portrays Theseus gathering together the remains of the son born of his marriage to the Amazonian queen, after his dismem- berment - an unfortunate and "unkind" end for that "issue" that should ever be "fortunate," in Oberon's words.) The history of Theseus as the "unkinde" monster of nature, the individual who continually breaks the bonds which convention and his own human condition impose upon all rational, voluntary creatures, was too widely known in the Renaissance for Shakespeare to have ignored it. As I have suggested, the dramatist's play has a beginning and a middle, in Aristotle's terms. But its ending is inconclusive, even though the marriage and the blessing of the bride bed can, in one sense, be considered the completion of an action - Theseus' courtship of Hippolyta. But like Sophocles' Oedipus Rex , the "complete action" is not totally complete; it remains for the Oedipus at Colonus to reconcile an audience with Oedipus' apotheosis. The history of Shake- speare's protagonist has no such ending.25 As Chaucer's Ariadne said in her "Lament," Theseus' actions violated divine rule: "For which the goddes of the heven above / Ben wrothe, and wreche han take for thy synne" (11. 1891-92). The full significance of Shakespeare's conventional portrayal of the Renaissance stereotype of Theseus in MND remains to be explored. In MND, the dramatist created a complex character, but he did not violate the image of him held by his age. The fact that he did not "metamorphose" Theseus and turn him into an icon of reason or an ideal Renaissance prince adds an ironic dimension to the play, making it more than a conventional 25. See Robert Graves's statement, "No efforts were spared to connect Theseus with Heracles . . . but the Athenians never grew powerful enough to make him into an Olympian god"; The Greek Myths , 2 vols.
