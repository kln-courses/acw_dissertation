Of the novel, Bakhtin observes: "Among genres long since completed and in part already dead, the novel is the only developing genre. It is the only genre that was born and nourished in a new era of world history and therefore it is deeply akin to that era, whereas the other major genres entered that era as already fixed forms, as an inheritance, and only now are they adapt- ing themselves-some better, some worse-to the new condi- tions of their existence."'

From such a perspective Michael McKeon has suggested that changes in genre and in the generic categories of the literary historian register "an epistemological crisis, a major cultural transition in attitudes toward how to tell the truth in narrative."2 Bakh- tin and McKeon imply that both generic classes and truth become relative, products of a particular historical situation. New genres not only posit new truths; they provide narrative models for arriving at the truth of the moment. It is possible, then, to argue that the detective story, not unlike the novel, appeared at a moment of social and intellectual crisis that it both recognized and defined, even as it promoted the transi- tion from one worldview, generally Christian and ahistorical, to another, profoundly historical worldview that remains to this day unsettling.3 A case in point is Edgar Allan Poe's "The Murders in the Rue Morgue," arguably the first detective story, the first mani- festation of a new genre "born and nourished in a new era of world history." The story has many dimensions to it and, in the violence directed against Madame and Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, it reveals the misogyny pervading other Poe sto- ries. But for someone like myself who is interested in the way in which the history and philosophy of science may help to contextualize literary works, "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" can be seen to appear in 1841 at a time in which both a resurgent evangelicalism and a conservative Natural Theology were confronted by a positivist science that was to have its nineteenth-century culmination in Charles Darwin's 2 The Origins of the English Novel, i6oo-I 740 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ.

The mysterious universe of The Pilgrim's Progress, in which divine intervention and the supernatural abound, was never to be totally displaced by a Natural Reli- gion for which natural law as instituted by God reigns. The transition from the Natural Theology of a William Paley or the authors of the Bridgewater Treatises to a Darwinian uni- verse of natural law and chance has never been consolidated within Western consciousness, as the rise of scientific creation- ism reveals.5 As a representative of detective fiction, "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" participated in an endless conversation, perhaps a cacophony of dispute, that has never ended.6 The story itself depicts a culture in which disagreement and dis- cord are everywhere. Men and women of different nationali- ties and languages are gathered in Paris, a world-city that becomes a nineteenth-century Babel. The witnesses to the carnage in the house in the Rue Morgue are unable to agree about the language spoken in the shrill-or was it harsh?- voice they had heard, about the gender of the speaker, or perhaps about anything else. They speak, literally and figura- tively, in foreign languages to each other. The situation points to the debates of the 183os and 1840s about the ori- gins and meaning of the universe. When C. Auguste Dupin dismisses the acumen of the Paris police as mere cunning, he observes that "there is no method in their proceedings, be- yond the method of the moments"7 I want to suggest that 4 See Charles Coulston Gillispie, Genesis and Geology: A Study in the Relations of Scientific Thought, Natural Theology, and Social Opinion in Great Britain, i790-1850 (195 1; rpt.

All</page><page sequence="4">"THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE" 171 with these words Dupin is not simply endorsing a generalized scientific and empiricist method to be demonstrated through his solution to the murders that occurred within the locked apartment of the L'Espanayes. Rather, he alludes to a specific worldview and especially to the controversies surrounding Pierre Simon Laplace's nebular hypothesis and to one ver- sion of it set forth by John Pringle Nichol, regius professor of astronomy at the University of Glasgow. In his scorn for the method of the moment, Dupin will ally himself with a vision of the universe that, as its critics understood, could lead to religious skepticism.8 All of this is clarified in the episode in which Dupin en- gages in what will prove to be his first tour de force of detec- tion for our benefit. Dupin and the narrator have been walk- ing at night through the streets of Paris without having spoken for some fifteen minutes. Suddenly, Dupin remarks to his companion: "He is a very little fellow, that's true, and would do better for the Thetatre des Varie'tets" (p. 402). The astounded narrator feels that Dupin has fathomed his soul; he demands to know the method-"if method there is"-that according to Dupin has led to the links in a chain that run "Chantilly [the cobbler turned tragedian], Orion, Dr. Nichol, Epicurus, Ste- reotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer" (p. 403). In his expla- nation of his inferences Dupin will demonstrate a method and, in discussing the topics the narrator dwells upon, allude to an embryonic worldview. Poe's narrator may emphasize the almost preternatural nature of Dupin's gifts; but Dupin him- self scorns recourse to the supernatural: he pursues explana- tions always grounded in empiricist assumptions about causa- tion and human consciousness. In retracing his companion's thoughts Dupin uses the reconstructive models of nineteenth- century historical disciplines associated with geology and ar- chaeology and later with evolutionary biology.

From this accidental event Dupin creates a chrono- logical, an associative, and, implicitly, a causal sequence of ideas based on the assumption that law governs not only all natural phenomena but also the workings of the human mind.9 From the start, the episode touches upon debates central to a time when nineteenth-century geology, particularly that of Charles Lyell and his Principles of Geology (1830-33), chal- lenged the literal status of Genesis and a chronology claiming the universe had been created in 4,004 B.C. The narrator's meditations have begun after the brush with the fruiterer. Dupin observes: "You stepped upon one of the loose frag- ments [of paving-stone], slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then proceeded in silence" (p. 403). The loss of his footing initiates the narrator's musings upon ori- gins. With challenges to Genesis and to traditional concep- tions of time, the ground beneath his feet has shifted; he undergoes a version of what Darwin experienced on the voy- age of the Beagle during the Chilean earthquake: "A bad earthquake at once destroys the oldest associations: the world, the very emblem of all that is solid, has moved beneath our feet like a crust over a fluid;-one second of time has conveyed to the mind a strange idea of insecurity, which hours of reflection would never have created."1o When he comes upon what seems to be firmer footing in the inter- locked paving stones, the narrator only finds that the term ''stereotomy" reminds him of the chaos of atoms from which 9 For discussions of this episode, see Burton R.

It is at this point that the narrator thinks of Dr. Nichol, the author of Views of the Architecture of the Heavens. Except for a reference to the "late nebular cosmogony," Dupin neglects to explain how thoughts of Nichol might lead the narrator to look up to Orion. But anyone turning to Nichol's book would find that it offers an exposition of the nebular hypothesis that Laplace first sketched out in 1796 in his System of the World."' In place of Isaac Newton's world-machine, created and periodically regulated by God, Laplace posited the exis- tence of an original matter existing in a heated, gaseous form that, through the laws of physics, cooled over vast periods of time. As the matter cooled it began to rotate around emerg- ing centers due to the force of gravity; in this way stars and solar systems would be formed. One such center of cooling gas was to become our sun, orbited by planets that were the condensed remnants of rings of vapor thrown off by centrifu- gal force from the cooling, rotating sun. Laplace's hypothesis had been influenced by the astronomer William Herschel, who had claimed to have found within the constellation Orion a luminous nebula of heated gases. Those gases were the precursors of yet other stars and solar systems, a revela- tion from the depths of space and time of their origins. It was Herschel who wrote in 1789 of the histories of different celes- tial systems as akin to "the germination, blooming, foliage, fecundity, fading, withering, and corruption of a plant." 12 Both Herschel and Laplace were to contribute to a worldview that, if Herschel's account is to be trusted, would lead La- place in his confident theism to observe to Napoleon that he had no need to turn, as Newton had, to a First Cause to explain the origins of the universe.'3 With its materialist implications, the nebular hypothesis could be associated, as indeed it was, with a Lucretian athe- II See P.

Early in the nineteenth century William Paley attacked the nebular hypothesis, citing it as one among several hypotheses about the origins of the universe offered by "those who reject an intelligent Creator."'14 Later in the century, in the first of the Bridgewater Treatises written to promote Natural Theol- ogy, Thomas Chalmers specifically mentioned Laplace, hold- ing him responsible for "the tendency of atheistical writ- ers... to reason exclusively on the laws of matter, and to overlook its dispositions": "Could all the beauties and bene- fits of the astronomical system be referred to the single law of gravitation, it would greatly reduce the strength of the argu- ment for a designing cause.. .. as if to fortify still more the atheism of such a speculation[J. .. La Place would have ac- credited the law, the unconscious and unintelligent law, that thing according to him of blind necessity, with the whole of this noble and beautiful result" that is the solar system and the uni- verse.'5 Writing in i833, Chalmers sensed to what specula- tions the nebular hypothesis might lead: "Insomuch, that though we conceded to the atheist, the eternity of matter, and the essentially inherent character of all of its laws-we could still point out to him, in the manifold adjustments of mat- ter. . . the most impressive signatures of a Deity" (pp. 19- 20); "That blind and unconscious matter cannot, by any of her combinations, evolve the phenomena of mind, is a proposi- tion seen in its own immediate light, and felt to be true with all the speed and certainty of an axiom" (p. 27; emphasis added). Of course, not all proponents of the nebular hypothe- sis perceived themselves either as skeptics or as potential transmutationists. In other Bridgewater Treatises religious men of science like William Whewell of Cambridge and Wil- liam Buckland of Oxford could provide thorough exposi- tions of Laplace's ideas: it was, in fact, Whewell who coined 14 Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, Collected from the Appearances of Nature, 3d ed.

Dupin's com- panion is preoccupied with one version of the nebular hy- pothesis that can be seen as a challenge to orthodoxies of all sorts-religious, scientific, and social. Nichol was an advocate of political economy and, in its name, social change, one of a group of reformers including John Stuart Mill and George Combe, the phrenologist. They invoked the rule of natural law and the notion of a changing universe to attack en- trenched social and religious institutions. Inevitably, they found themselves in conflict with defenders of the existing social order-with those like Whewell and Adam Sedgwick, first professor of geology at Cambridge and a patron of Dar- win, who tried to dominate the emerging sciences in the name of Anglicanism. In their defense of society as it existed, the dons of Cambridge and Oxford could be expected to respond to Nichol and to others with charges of political radicalism and religious impiety.'8 In his Views of the Architecture of the Heavens, first published in 1837, John Pringle Nichol writts with a keen awareness of potential critics. Throughout his book Nichol celebrates that "BEING, who amid change alone is unchangeable-whose glance reaches from the beginning to the end-and whose presence occupies all things" to quell "uneasy feelings" aroused "by the idea of a process which may appear to substi- 6 See Simon Schaffer, "The Nebular Hypothesis and the Science of Progress," in History, Humanity, and Evolution: Essays for John C.

(pp. 187-88). Yet such emotions must encom- pass the possibility that matter itself may bear "within it, laid up in its dark bosom-the germs, the producing powers of that LIFE, which in coming ages will bud and blossom, and effloresce, into manifold and growing forms" (p. 138). Within a universe so conceived, "the existence of the human race is an invisible speck, [that] will have resulted during a stage of condensation in a secondary nebula": "In relation to the nebulae, Man is only an Ephemeron" (pp. 151-52). Nichol's vision of Man as "a transient organization, with whose progress the education of a Spiritual Being has been for a moment connected' (p. 188) may arouse anxiety, as Nichol substitutes for a single act of creation an evolving pro- cess governed only by natural law. Yet he argues that such anxiety arises from a misunderstanding, for law cannot be separated from Mind: Law is a mere name for a long order-an order unoriginated, unupheld, unsubstantial, whose floor sounds hollow beneath the tread, and whose spaces are all void; an order hanging trem- blingly over nothingness, and of which every constituent-every thing and creature fails not to beseech incessantly for a substance and substratum in the idea of ONE-WHO LIVETH FOR EVER!

He can only further stir uneasiness as he observes that "absolute permanence is visi- ble nowhere around us, and the fact of change merely inti- mates, that in the exhaustless womb of the future, unevolved wonders are in store." But such wonders require "the close of one mighty cycle in the history of the solar orb-the passing away of arrangements which have fulfilled their objects that they might be transformed into new. Thus is the periodic death of a plant perhaps the essential to its prolonged life, and when the individual dies and disappears, fresh and vigor- ous forms spring from the elements which composed it" (pp. 194-95). It is not surprising that the narrator may not find solace in Nichol's claim that "a time may come, when the veil can be drawn aside-when spirit shall converse directly with spirit, and the creature gaze without hinderance on the effulgent face of its Creator" (p. 196). Only as he finds surer footing in the pavement of the alley, Lamartine, does the narrator re- gain what Nichol has called "the solid ground of fact and observation" (Views, p. 122): at that moment he casts his "eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion" ("Murders," p. 404). It was, after all, William Herschel's speculations on the lumi- nous clouds he claimed to have discovered in the constella- tion Orion that had influenced Laplace's formulation of the nebular hypothesis.20 The narrator gazes upward to glimpse the birth of other stars-perhaps of other solar systems- that could eventually give rise to life itself. Yet, in contemplat- ing Orion, the narrator inevitably is reminded of a recent attack upon the would-be tragedian, Chantilly, in which the critic in the Musee mocked the actor's change of name by citing a Latin line about which he and Dupin have often talked: "Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum" (p. 404). The line is from the Fasti, Ovid's uncompleted calendar, which 20 See Brush, "The Nebular Hypothesis and the Evolutionary Worldview," pp. 245-78, and Numbers, Creation by Natural Law, for discussions of how Lord Rosse's resolution of the nebula in Orion into already formed stars were later used by proponents of Natural Theology to refute the nebular hypothesis.</page><page sequence="11">178 NINETEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE includes an account of the birth of Orion. In the Fasti Ovid tells the story of Jupiter, Neptune, and Mercury, who urinate upon a bull's hide from which, after being covered by earth, a boy is born some ten months later. The child is originally called Urion, from the Greek "ouron," for urine; the name is altered to obscure his true origins and the curious fact that he is not born of woman.2' The "pungencies connected with this explanation," so Dupin claims, has led the narrator "to com- bine the two ideas of Orion and Chantilly" (p. 404). In think- ing of the cobbler who has changed his name, the narrator thinks of an act of self-transformation from some ignomini- ous condition. Yet the creation of Orion out of urine, earth, and the bull's hide-out of matter in its least pleasant forms-suggests not only the diminutive, perhaps comic, Chantilly; it stands as a curious parody of any evolutionary account of human origins that might suggest, as the Architec- ture of the Heavens has, that matter itself bears within it germs that may produce life without an act of special creation. In drawing himself to his full height, Dupin's companion not only thinks of the cobbler's stature; he asserts his own dignity and humanity within the context of certain accounts of hu- man origins. In his erect posture the narrator, who to that point has "been stooping in [his] gait" (p. 404), would seem to shrug off any hypothesis that would suggest that he is related to creatures of some lower order. Although Dupin's reconstruction of his friend's thoughts would seem to bring to an end the preoccupations that bother him, "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" becomes an extension of the narrator's reverie, even a confirmation of his fears. Dupin's revelation that an Ourang-Outang had been the killer of Madame and Mademoiselle L'Espanaye only further develops the very possibilities that have proven to be so disconcerting to the narrator. In his efforts to per- suade his friend that the marks on the throat of Mademoi- selle L'Espanaye have not been left by a human hand, Dupin turns to a passage from Georges Cuvier: "It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large 21 See Ovid's Fasti, trans.

Putnam's Sons, 1931), pp. 296-301, v. 493-544.</page><page sequence="12">"THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE" 179 fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands. The gi- gantic stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all. I understood the full hor- rors of the murder at once" (p. 424). Burton R. Pollin has already recognized that Dupin has referred his friend to Cuvier's Animal Kingdom, and Pollin has further noted that the entry on the Ourang-Outang does not, in fact, mention the ferocity of the animal.22 More suggestive is the fact that Cuvier is careful to qualify the claims of those who would argue that the Ourang-Outang approaches "most nearly to Man in the form of his head, height of forehead, and volume of brain."23 Yet, in a passage omitted from "The Murders in the Rue Morgue"-paralleling the omission of the signifi- cance of Dr. Nichol-Cuvier goes on to discuss not only the Ourang-Outang's imitative talents but its hoarseness of voice. He turns to deal with the Pongo, which resembles the Ourang-Outang and is "in size. . . nearly equal to Man." The full implications of the entry are revealed in a footnote ex- plaining the etymology of the animal's name: "Orang is a Malay word signifying reasonable being, which is applied to man, the ourang-outang, and the elephant. Outang means wild, or of the woods; hence Wild Man of the Woods" (p. 44n). Cuvier's etymology may well be a pure fiction, a repetition in the story of Ovid's account of the derivation of the name Orion from Urion. Butjust as the Fasti suggests Orion's hum- ble origins, Cuvier's discussion of the name Ourang-Outang connects the animal with the human species, perhaps as its ancestor. 22 See Pollin, "The Ingenious Web Unravelled," pp. 253-54. However, Pollin does not deal with Cuvier's explanation of the etymology of the name Ourang- Outang. For a nineteenth-century discussion of cosmogony and Cuvier, see "Cuvier's Theory of the qlobe," rev. of A Discourse on the Revolutions of the Surface of the Globe, and the Changes thereby Produced in the Animal Kingdom, by Baron G. Cuvier, Southern Review, 8 (1831-32), 68-88: the essay attacks "the doctrine of atoms, with all its train of atheistical notions," even as it rejects explanations invoking "the immediate agency of the Creator when events can be accounted for by secondary causes"; it concludes by quoting Cuvier's English editor, who refers to the "fertile womb" of nature. 23 Baron Cuvier, Animal Kingdom: Arranged According to its Organization, trans.

For Monboddo, the Ourang-Outang is a neces- sary stage in the progression of the human species; indeed, he is a man as suggested by the name, "Man of the Woods,. . . by which he is called by the people of Africa, where he is to be seen, and who do not appear to have the least doubt that he is a man; which, as they live in the country with him, they should know better than we can do."25 For Monboddo, accounts of the Ourang-Outang provide a description of "man, in his first state": "for man is said first to creep, that is, to go upon all four.... After that, he is erected, and gets the use of an artifi- cial weapon, such as the Ourang Outang uses. Next, he invents rude and barbarous cries ... by which men communicated their sensations, appetites, and desires to one another. And, last of all, they formed ideas, and invented words to express them.... But this is a step in the progress towards the civilized life, which the Ourang Outang has not yet made" (IV, 31-32). In fact, Monboddo argues that the Ourang-Outang has a fully developed larynx-"the upper part of the larynx, which is called in English the knot of the throat, and in French la glotte" (IV, 1 io)-exactly like that of man. As the self-proclaimed promoter of the theism of Plato and Aristotle, Monboddo can argue, however improbably, that "it was of absolute necessity that, in the progress of the human species, man should at some time or another be such an animal: For, if he was originally a 24 See Hans Aarsleff, The Study of Language in England, I780-i860 (1967; rpt.

As further proof of his claims Monboddo states that the Ourang-Outang can copulate with human females and produce offspring. Out of a hodge- podge of philosophy, anecdotal reporting, and flights of fancy, Monboddo writes of the Ourang-Outang as man in his natural state before the invention of the art of language that was neces- sary for his progression toward full humanity. It is perhaps with such discussions of the Ourang-Outang in mind that Dupin seizes upon the confusing testimony about the language and even the gender of one of the voices heard behind the locked door to the L'Espanaye apartment. He com- ments: "Now, how strangely unusual must that voice have really been . . . in whose tones, even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing familiar!" (p. 416). With a characteristic racism, Dupin and his friend de- scend a hierarchy from the apex constituted by speakers of Indo-European languages to Asiatics and Africans, with their barbarous tongues, to those excluded from the human com- munity through their seeming unintelligibility. In response to Dupin's observation that the voice was "devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification," the narrator at last exclaims that "a madman ... has done this deed-some raving maniac, es- caped from a neighboring Maison de Sante" (p. 423). Asians, Africans, lunatics-and perhaps, by implication, women- become associated with the Ourang-Outang. Without lan- guage, whoever had uttered such sounds and brutally killed the two women is exiled from the human species and ceases, in its apparent motivelessness, to be a responsible agent.26 In emphasizing that "madmen are of some nation" and dismissing the "idea of motive" (pp. 423, 421), Dupin intro- duces the Ourang-Outang as the culprit, reducing the mur- ders to purely contingent events without purpose and mean- ing. He denies that any significance is to be found in the acci- 26 See Michel Foucault, Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason, trans.

Yet the fate of the two women demands some re- sponse: they had been so violated that the daughter's tongue had been bitten through, the mother's throat cut-I would suggest at the larynx, Monboddo's knot of the throat-so that her head had been severed from her body.27 A psychological reading of the story would emphasize the misogyny of the murders: the imitative behavior of the Ourang-Outang and the name "Wild Man of the Woods"-suppressed in the story itself-would transform the creature into the Double of its master, the sailor, acting out his fantasies upon the two women. In destroying the women's organs of speech the Ourang-Outang blindly denies their status as human beings, confirming the darkest implications of male attitudes toward women. 28 But such a reading complements the one I am suggest- ing. In the figure of the Ourang-Outang and its attack upon the organs of speech, "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" points to Lord Monboddo's speculations on the progress of the human species in its development from lower animals. As he thrusts the corpse of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye up the chimney, feet first, the Ourang-Outang enacts male terror of the female body and captures, in another sense, the terror and confusion of those who suddenly find themselves in a contingent universe. In his Bridgewater Treatise Chalmers had said that "blind and unconscious matter cannot, by any of her combinations, evolve the phenomena of mind." In his discussion of the nebular hypothesis Nichol had written of the "womb of the future." Both, as men are wont to do, associate matter and nature with the female, implicitly deny- ing women consciousness and the power of speech.

In the midst of debates about the implications of the nebular hypothesis, "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" of- fered all that the critics of Laplace most feared, a harrowing vision of a Lucretian universe. It was a vision recorded by Charles Darwin in his personal notebooks in the spring and summer of 1838.

Nichol would accuse Mr. Vestiges of plagiarism in his uniting of the nebular hypothesis with Lamarckean prem- ises to argue that a First Cause, "a primitive almighty will," has produced the two laws that govern the universe: "The inorganic has one final comprehensive law, GRAVITATION. The organic, the other great department of mundane things, rests in like manner on one law, and that is,- DEVELOPMENT."31 In the nebula of Orion we have glimpsed "the process through which a sun goes between its original condition, as a mass of diffused nebulous matter, and its full-formed state as a compact body" (p. 8). With the laws of gravitation and development there is no need to invoke miracle or the doctrine of special creation. Over the course of time the solar system has been formed; even "the first step in the creation of life upon this planet was a chemico- electric operation, by which simple germinal vesicles were produced" (pp. 204-5), initiating a process that led from simple organ- isms to complex ones that include human beings. God willed into existence a process that permits Mr. Vestiges to deny the dualism of Mind and Matter and to suggest that "the difference between mind in the lower animals and in man is a difference in degree only" (pp. 335-36). There are even echoes of Lord Monboddo as Mr. Vestiges discusses the lar- 30 In "The Nebular Hypothesis and the Science of Progress" Schaffer argues that Darwin, Robert Chambers, and John Stuart Mill, as well as Poe, were all per- suaded by Nichol's version of the nebular hypothesis (see pp. 144-45). 31 Robert Chambers, Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation and Other Evolution- ary Writings, ed.

For those who might be taken aback by his attacks on divine intervention in human affairs or visions of an anthropomorphic God, Mr. Vestiges offers a vista of unending progress in civilization and the further develop- ment of human reason in an unimaginable future. Those who heard Poe's lecture on the Universe and read his "Eureka" in 1848 recognized the unacknowledged influ- ence of the Vestiges.32 With explicit references to Epicurus, William Herschel, and Nichol's Architecture of the Heavens and a footnote referring to "The Murders in the Rue Morgue"-Poe proceeds to offer his own interpretation of "the Material and Spiritual Universe: -of its Essence, its Origin, its Creation, its Present Condition and its Destiny" ("Eureka," p. 1,261). Like Mr. Vestiges, Poe writes of a divine Unity that, through an act of pure volition, "now exists solely in the dif- fused Matter and Spirit of the Universe; and that the regath- ering of this diffused Matter and Spirit will be but the re- constitution of the purely Spiritual and Individual God" (p. 1,357). In place of Mr. Vestiges's laws of Gravitation and Development, Poe writes of the rule of Repulsion and Attrac- tion that governs the inanimate and the animate realms. He offers an idiosyncratic pantheism that some associated with Spinoza to explain the origins of the universe and conscious- ness and to reveal, through the power of Attraction, an inevi- table return to the primal unity from which all has come. Unlike Mr. Vestiges, Poe rejects the possibility that "the Uni- verse has no conceivable end": without an end "Creation would have affected us as an imperfect plot in a romance, where the denoument is awkwardly brought about by inter- posed incidents external and foreign to the main subject; instead of springing out of the bosom of the thesis" (p. 1,352). Human beings demand plots with teleological implica- 32 See Dwight Thomas and David K. Jackson, The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809-1849 (Boston: G. K. Hall, 1987), pp. 723-24.

The Universe is a plot of God" (p. 1,342). God's plot demands that the universe of matter and spirit through which divinity has diffused itself will finally, and satisfyingly, be rejoined with the unity from which they have proceeded. But those who were skeptical of the unorthodox implica- tions of the nebular hypothesis would have nothing to do with "the sublime chronology" (p. 22) of a Mr. Vestiges or with Poe's version of the universe as a "plot of God." In his anonymous review of the Vestiges in the Edinburgh Review, Adam Sedgwick could write of the book as "the raving madness of hypothetical extravagance," mention Lucretius and his De rerum natura, and yoke Mr. Vestiges with Lord Monboddo, each of whom "brooded over the fantasies of his mind till his dreams became to him as substantial realities."33 The responses to Poe's lecture and "Eureka" were mixed, but the unsigned review of "Eu- reka" in the Literary World attacked Poe's speculations as "extra- ordinary nonsense, if not blasphemy; and it may very possibly be both" (Poe Log, p. 746). The unorthodox speculations in the Vestiges and "Eureka" were properly seen as threats to tradi- tional Christianity and to an existing social order in Great Britain and the United States. Those who would have known of the feverish dreams of Mr. Vestiges or Poe feared that the act of divine volition that created an evolving universe, with or without an end, might well be but a step away from a purely contingent originating event from which the solar system and life itself were to arise. In the place of a divine chronology or a plot of God we may be left perhaps with a romance, a plot in the mind of C. Auguste Dupin, reconstructed only after a series of coincidences that led, with a seeming inevitability, to the murders in the Rue Morgue. In 1 841 "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" explored the implications of the nebular hypothesis at a moment when the contest between differing worldviews had not been decided and when the future could not be predicted. Poe's story did not simply reinforce a prevailing orthodoxy: at the time, Natural Theology and evangelicalism remained powerful 33 [Adam Sedgwick], rev. of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, Edinburgh Review, 82 (1845), 25-26, 39.</page><page sequence="20">"THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE" 187 voices in the ongoing conversation about the origin and na- ture of the universe. The story may, in fact, have been in the service of an emerging perspective whose full implications were to be clarified in 1859 with the publication of the Origin of Species. Poe himself, as "Eureka" suggests, remained unde- cided, perhaps divided, about the speculations of a John Pringle Nichol or a Mr. Vestiges. Instead, "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" can be seen to suggest the situation of the individual within a Parisian Babel of controversy, anticipating in its own outre way the possible ascendancy of one evolution- ary vision of the universe. In the figure of C. Auguste Dupin, Poe depicted the individual as a creature of history who must reconstruct the past even as he comes upon the fact of the contingency of certain events, without any reassuring knowl- edge of the future. It becomes a harrowing vision, centered upon the presence of the Ourang-Outang with its seemingly motiveless frenzy, introducing the terror of a history secular- ized and devoid of design.34 In such a world there is no longer the solace provided by claims that "the plots of God are perfect: The Universe is a plot of God." Rather, we are left with the reconstructions of a Dupin and, later, of a Wil- liam Legrand in "The Gold-Bug," for whom "perfection of plot is really, or practically, unattainable. .. because it is a finite intelligence that constructs" ("Eureka," p. 1,342). Such plots, like "an imperfect plot in a romance" (p. 1 ,352), become a mark of the detective story as it responds to a new era of world history. Through the creation of plot, both Dupin and Legrand struggle against that "temporary paralysis" that coin- cidence induces: each establishes "a connexion-a sequence of cause and effect" ("The Gold-Bug," p. 58i)-in the face of 34 See Mircea Eliade, Cosmos and History: The Myth of the Eternal Return, trans. Willard R. Trask (New York: Harper and Row, 1959); and Stephen Toulmin and June Goodfield, The Discovery of Time (London: Hutchinson, 1965).
