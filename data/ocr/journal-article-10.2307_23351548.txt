<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shigaku Zasshi Summary of Japanese Scholarship Asahara Tatsuro Ota Yukio Translated by Leon N. Hurvitz (Translator's Note: Each year Shigaku Zasshi devotes its entire May issue to a discussion of historical studies in Japan during the pre ceding year. Early China attempts to publish annually an adapted translation of the section on Ancient China. This year's account consists of a resume of scholarship on "Yin, Zhou, and Chunqui" by Asahara Tatsuro j ^ ^ and on "Zhanguo, Qin, and Han" by Ota Yukio 33 ^ from Shigaku Zasshi 91.5 [1982]:184-194. Translating this material is never easy and we have greatly benefitted this year from the editorial assistance of Don C. Price and Nancy T. Price.) YIN, ZHOU, AND CHUNQIU Last year three works were published by writers whose contributions to the learned world were already well-established. These are: 1) Ikeda Suetoshi &lt;3 , A Study of Ancient Chinese Reli gious History—Institutions and Ideas (Chugoku kodai shuky5 shl kenkyu—sedio to shisS ^ |gj £ ^ ^ t ), Tokai daigaku shuppan kai |3 5^.

Leon N. Hurvitz That the work of these three scholars has been published in a convenient format is something for which we are all grateful. We can only hope that these achievements are but a harbinger of more intense future activity. Our countrymen are working not only on their own research, but also translating recent Chinese studies, for example: 1) Xia Nai &gt; Studies in Chinese Archaeology (Zhongguo kaoguxue yanjiu ^ ), translated by Higuchi Takayasu cz et al., Gakuseisha ^ ; 2) Thirty Years of Chinese Archaeology (Chugoku koko gaku sanju nen \ Heibon sha ^ ; translation supervised by Sekino Takeshi Mj , of Thirty Years of Work with Cultural Artifacts (Wenwu kaogu gong zuo sanshi nian 5^ ^ "ir i 'f'jl 3- \ jf- )&gt; Wen wu cllu ban she ^ ifc, ^ ± » 3) Zhao Jibin , New Researchers into the Analects of Confucius (Lun.yu xintan )&gt; translated by Takahashi Hitoshi ^4^^ ; Taishukan In this case, too, it is hoped that in the future more books will be translated from the Chinese. During the past year, research, investigating and speculating on Yin and Zhou history from a variety of view points, was published. There may be few other areas that have become the focus of such wide-ranging interest. A comprehensive survey of these works is, quite understandably, no easy task; nevertheless, with more courage than good sense, I mean to attempt just that, albeit roughly. To adopt the handiest approach, that of chronological order of subject matter, the first work to mention is To So (Deng Cong) , "On Such Matters as An Zhimin's Theory of the Disappearance of Microliths" ("An ^ Shimin no saisekki no shometsu ron sono ta ni tsuite" &lt;^&gt; . &lt;T) H. ^ X , Bunka 'Xit 45.1,2). The author focuses on certain questions raised in An Zhimin's article "Mesolithic Period Remains in Hailaer: A Discussion of the Origin and Tradition of Microliths" ("Hailaer di zhongshiqi yicun—jian lun xishihqi di qiyuan he chuantong" 3&amp;dt- # 3% ** ^ ^ &amp; Kaogu xuebao ^ £ '3? 1978.3); for example, that the Microlithic culture originated in North China (Huabei ), where it began to disap pear as agriculture developed, while remaining a tradition in the outlying</page><page sequence="3">Shigaku Zasshi 95 regions. An's theory contains some rather bold agruments and To presents them persuasively. For the Neolithic period, there is the article by Hayashi Minao E ^ , "Concerning Some Features of the Jade Vessels of the Liangzhu Culture" ("Ry5sho bunka no gyokki jakkan o megutte" fL 5^" t &lt;T&gt; JL "f Co ~C , Museum 1981-2). Based on jade vessels in the Freer Gallery of Art, Hayashi demonstrates that they belong to the Liangzhu culture, at the same time considering their relationship to the Dawenkou and Longshan cultures in Shandong, as well as to the earlier Hemudu culture. Having determined that one of the designs among the Freer jades, in particular, is modeled on the bird and sun patterns seen in the Hemudu culture, he deduces that they reflect a belief that intense heat would bring a plentiful harvest. Iijima Taketsugu (Takeji?) ^Jk. % &gt; also in parts 12-14 of his "Pre-Yin Proposals" ("In zenki no teigen" 4^ #0 , Kodai bunka X. 4 tl ), discusses large jade gui , jade ge X -dagger-axes, and jade yue^ft^ -battle-axes (bi ^ -shaped and fu -axe shaped). Throughout, he classifies the remains of the Erlitou .x % period, and analyzes their relationship with the Neolithic culture and with the Erligang f? j3s] and Xiaotun ,) * *tL periods. The local cultures parallel with the dominant cultures of the Yin and Zhou have attracted notice in recent years. Machida Akira i9T tS ^ , "Yin and Zhou and the 'State of the Guzhu'" ("Inshu to Kochiku koku" f^] 0~&gt; , in Studies in Chinese Literature and History in Honour of Dr. Shirakawa Shizuka's Seventieth Birthday [Shirakawa Shizuka hakushi koki kinen Chugoku bunshi ronshu 1SJ )'| 5"^ X ] Ritsumeikan bungaku jX ^430-2), examines the connection between the Yin-Zhou culture and the so-called Lower Xia jiadian ^ culture to the north. Clearly this culture, which is now better documented by recent archaeological work, has become the subject of much attention in China itself, as well as having long attracted the keen interest of Japanese scholars. As Mr. Machida has pointed out, this culture, while flourishing in Hebei and Liaoning, maintained close relations with that of the Central Plain during the transition from Yin to Zhou. Still, since there is insufficient evidence to relate this culture to the famous state of Guzhou in the well-known tale of Bo Yi ^ and Shu Qi &gt; a certain caution is essential. It is, no doubt, equally true, as the author himself points out, that a study of the Upper Xiajiadian Culture is equally necessary. The local cultures contemporary with the Yin and Zhou are discussed by Hayashi Minao, "Bronze Vessels of Local Style from the Yin and the Western Zhou" ("In Seishujidai no chiho-gata seidoki" 'ft Hl ) Kokogaku memowaru ^ ^ ^ -t *7—)V [1980]). In this article the following views are presented: (1) The small-scale zheng bell of the Yin was, for a time, succeeded by the larger zhong^J" bell dating</page><page sequence="4">96 trans. Leon N. Hurvitz to the middle period of the Western Zhou and later, after which the southern zhong bell was to disappear; (2) There is seen on the periphery of the Central Plain during the Yin and early Zhou a group of bronze vessels which, while clearly influenced by such cultural artifacts of the Central Plain as the jietou zun ^ (a shouldered wine vessel, but without wide-flaring mouth), nevertheless has some unusual elements all its own; (3) The so-called bo bell ornament, while exhibiting some stylistic features of the outlying regions of the Zhou, suddenly makes its appearance in the midst of the bronze vessels of the Western Zhou. The study deals with problems of great interest to historians, including that of musical performances of non-Chinese at the court of the Western Zhou. The study of local cultures contemporary with the dominant Yin and the Zhou cultures will aid not only in understanding those cultures themselves, but also will aid in considering the nature of the Yin and Zhou cultures as well. Where bone inscriptions are concerned, there is Ito Michiharu , "Concerning the Use of the Particle ^ " ("Goshi ^ noyohonikan shite" #§■ ^ I ~C , Ritsumeikan bungaku nos. 430-432). Hitherto, this character has, for the most part, been dismissed as just another auxiliary word, namely, as a homonym and homophone of wei . The author points out that the matter is not so simple. To begin with "auxiliary words" require a more cautious treatment; a contextual considera tion of the language of divination is one of the tasks of oracle-bone studies. This is the point of departure for the present article. The conclusion is that this particle ^ in the third and fourth periods was used sometimes to refer to some element included in an antecedent action and sometimes in place of an antecedent. To explain anything in words is no easy matter, all the less easy, presumably, when, auxiliary words, being by nature what they are, oc cur in places in which they cannot be fully accounted for as mere auxiliaries. As regards Yin and Zhou bronze vessels, there is another study by Hayashi Minao, "The Classification and Use of Ceremonial Vessels under the Yin and the Western Zhou" ("In seishu jidai reiki no ruibetsu to yoho" ^ \\ %'j t y£\ , Toho gakuho , [Kyoto] ,?i %[J 53). Based principally on wine vessels this study is concerned with their classificaiton (which has a great deal to do with the questions of nomen clature), use, and in particular, the changes in form of the vessels; the author points out that the form is related to changes in the rituals themselves. The study is exceptional both as regards the new interpretation it offers to views that previously have been widely accepted and the entire approach which is different from that of preceding investigations of this type. For, whereas the latter focused exclusively on individual vessels, Hayashi groups several ves sels together and within this unified context considers both the use and the nomenclature of those in each group. In Kimura Hidemi ^ yifr , "The Term xiaozi &lt;)x in the Bronze Inscriptions of the Weste_rn Zhou: One Aspect of the Ruling Structure of the Western Zhou" (Sei Shu kimbun ni</page><page sequence="5">Shigaku Zasshi 97 mieru shashi ni tsuite - sei Shu no shihai kiko no iohimen" |?j ^ JC. t=. % % % $ l,Z \ * X &amp;J &lt;n £&amp;£ — 2q , Shir in ^ /fcfi 64-6), the author proposes two meanings for xiaozi based on the study of bronze inscriptions: (1) a designation of a youngster or a self deprecating designation, or (2) a household that has separated itself from the clan proper. As a means of interpreting Western Zhou bronze inscriptions, this explanation surely makes the most sense. Moreover, in treating the word xiaozi, this approach appears to be the most fruitful. One can only hope for future studies devoted to the word xiaozi in both the oracle-bone inscriptions and the classics. As regards legend and myth, there is the study by Mitarai Masaru , "The Original Character of the Yihe: the Ancient Chinese Tra dition of the 'Sun's Charioteer'" ("Giwa no shigen-teki sheikaku—kodai Chugoku ni okeru 'taiyo no gyosha' no densetsu" |» &lt;r&gt; Jff, ^ l%J I &lt;r&gt; Hiroshima daigaku bungakubu, Kiyo % A ^ X. Mitaria holds that Yihe, originally another name for the sun god himself (zhurongshen ), a god who drove a dragon through the heavens, thus eventually became the source of another tradition, one that characterized him as the Sun's char ioteer. Tamura Kazuchika (S , "On the Origin and Development of the Legend Concerning King Zhou of the Yin and his 'Ponds of Wind and Forests of Flesh'" ("In no Chu O no shuchi nikurin setsuwa no seisei" 1=0 frf i- , Nisho gakusha daigaku ronshu [1980]), studies the process by which the tradi tion of King Zhou's "wicked deeds" took shape. This is a new and interesting theory. As for the tale of the "deer pavilion" (lutai ^ ) and of the "pond of wine" (jiuchi &gt;j3j ), he focusses on the features it shares with the tale of King Wen's "spirit pavilion" (lingtai ez ), and concludes that some researchers arrived at quite independent interpretations, giving rise to a new interpretative tradition. He is also probably correct in pointing out that the conduct of the sexes around the "pond of wine" had points in common with the practices associated with the "music of Zheng and Wei" ( Iff ). Also, Kawakami Yoshizo )'l -fc H. , "The Fangfeng Clan and Mount Fengyu" ("Bofu-shi to Hogu no yama" ~$j) ^ (A, &gt; &lt;D ^ , Nippon Chugoku gakkai ho ^ ^ )5^) 33), considers the traditions concerning two persons and three mountains, the persons being a "member of the Fangfeng clan" and one of his alleged descendants, Changdi -f, the mountains being Tushan Ja and Guiji , in addition to the above-mentioned Fengyu. As for the history of the Chunqiu period one is struck by those works of solid scholarship which are based on the careful collection and analysis of</page><page sequence="6">98 trans. Leon N. Hurvitz source materials. Hirase Takao , "The Kings of Chu and the Local Potentates" ("So O to kenkun" M. , Shigaku zasshi x. discusses whether or not the post of local governor (xian yin -{ft f* ) was hereditary, and concludes that this was not necessarily the case. His meticulous examinations of the documents and consideration of all possible explanations leave no room to doubt his conclusions. Clearly similar studies of states other than Chu are desirable. Matsumoto Tamio ^ itfH, "Concrete Examples of the Duties of the shi in the Zuozhuan: One As pect of the Division of Functions among the Four Classes" ("Saden shigi shakurei -shim in bungyo no ittan to shite" — 0O fa I ~C , Bunka X.'i L 44.3.4), classifies and then analyzes the use of shi in the Zuozhuan, and concludes that the term most frequently refers to soldiers or, more generally, to members of the governing class. Hanabusa Takuji, "The Flight of Fugitives during the Spring-and Autumn Period: The Influence of Relations by Marriage and by Blood" ("Shunju jidai no bomei - bomei ni oyobosu tsukon inseki kankei no eikyo" fa #: ^ *&gt; — ^ » Hiroshima daigaku bungakubu, Kiyo 41), divides the Zuozhuan's sto ries oT fugitives into two types, those based on blood relationship and those that are not, and arranges them by feudal state. He professes to demonstrate the process by which the weakening social dynamics of blood relationship was replaced by that of political connection. Tagami Yasuaki , "The Conclusion of the Zuo Commentary to the Chunqiu and the 'Accounts of Yue': The Response to Non-Chinese Hegemons" ("ShurijQ Sa-shi den no ket sumatsu to Etsu kiji - iban no hasha e no taio" ^ ^ ^ £ ^ ^ ^ jf| ^ 'V i7) /fa , in Sinological Studies in Honour of Dr. Takeuchi Teruo's 70th Birthday [Taekeuchi Teruo hakushi koki kinen Chugokugaku ronbun ship rVf 1*0 ^ ^ ^ HO yC. z;), points out that the notices of Yue in the Zuo Commentary are extremely few and fragmentary. Last year there were numerous studies of sacrifice and ceremony as well. In addition to the completion of Mr. Ikeda Suetoshi's magnum opus, a truly wide variety of issues concerning sacrifice and ceremony was taken up and different points of view developed. In no study is an attempt made to make clear the differences between it and others (for which, however, the authors are not responsible); therefore, it is difficult to pinpoint the tend encies in the field as a whole. All the same, one is safe in saying that one aspect of the study of ancient China in Japan results from the interest, over the years, that scholars have shown independently in ancient Chinese sacri fice and ceremony. One thing, however, that I felt in reading last year's studies is that there were cases in which the reader might have difficulty determining what, as regards ancient China, the writer was specifically inter ested in discussing, for they were all united in their focus on ancient Chinese</page><page sequence="7">Shigaku Zasshi 99 sacrifice and ceremony. It stands to reason that, from the Yin to the Qin Han period, notions of sacrifice and ceremony cannot have failed to undergo some change. These studies do not claim to be history, but they are so un clear about the historical background of the eras in question, that they seem vague and abstract. Taniguchi Yoshisuke (Yoshinosuke? Gisuke? Ginosuke?) CZ , "The Jitian Ceremony Under the Western Zhou" ("Sei Shu jidai no sekiden girei" }S] &lt;*0 &amp;) , Ritsumeikan bungaku 430-432), divides the jitian rituals (performed on the fields that fur nished the rice for sacrifice to the imperial ancestors into four levels), as evidenced in the Zhou portion of the Guoyu. He then traces the process whereby the first two levels, peasant rituals indigenous to the Zhou were combined with the jitian ritual of the Yin to create a new artifical ceremony sponsored by the Zhou kings, but later abolished by King Xuan'lfi. The study is interesting because of its graphic portrayal of the changes in the jitian ritual from before the conquest of the Yin to the end of the Western Zhou. The forthcoming separate publication in which the third and fourth levels of ritual are discussed is eagerly awaited. Also Shimura Ryoji (Yoshiji? Yoshiharu?) y{? , "The Liao Sacrifice and Ancient Song: The Origins of the Literature of 'Scent' " C' 'Ryo' sai to ko kayo - 'nioi' no bungaku no kigen" t — £) * "yj O ^ ^ 5$. , in Comparative-Culture Studies on the Notion of God [Kami kannen no hikaku bunka ron teki kenkyu ^ cn edited by the Seminar in Japanese Civilization of the Faculty of Letters in the University of the ^Northeast. Tohoku daigaku bungaku bu, Nippon bunka kenkyu sho hen -Jt &gt;C %9 ^ ), discusses scent as one way of approaching god, and traces the manner in which it originated in pre-Qin times. He concludes that the liao sacrifice of the Yin was not regarded as a mere fire-sacrifice, but was taken as a cere mony in which the spiritual force of the odor of the burning victim invited the presence of the god. By the time of the Western Zhou, says the author, intense scent such as that of the yuchang ^ came to be held in high regard, while on the other hand, one sees in sucfi works as the Shi jing evi dence of the existence of sacrifices in which fire was used in the tradition of the liao sacrifice. From this, he proceeds to say, one knows that this tradi tional use of odors continued and appears in the Chu ci in the form of fragrant grasses and herbs. During this long period, the author em phasizes that the manner in which the sense of smell was conceived in sacri fices reveals common features of great continuity. It is, on the other hand, undeniable that other elements are not necessarily continuous and need to be carefully examined as well. Kanaya Osamu , "On Tian as Exempli fying the Notion of God in Ancient China" ("Chugoku kodai ni okeru kami kannen to shite no ten" ^j2 (&amp;j -fK (- L , ibid.), traces the process whereby tian, having appeared in the bone and bronze inscriptions, proceeds through Confucius, Lao Zi ^ , Zhuang</page><page sequence="8">100 trans. Leon N. Hurvitz Zi -j" and the school of Mo Di ^ ijg/ to fit into Dong Zhongshu's "Jf theory of the mutual relationship of Divinity and man (tian ren xiang guan lun ^ ). Tanida (Tanita? Yada? Yatsuda?) Takayuki ^ 2L , "The Origin of the Zhao-Mu Institutions in Ancient China" ("Chugoku kodai Sho-Boku seido hassei ni kan-suru ichi kosatsu" &amp;] $2 %%■ &amp;\j?l J£. I - ^ ^ ^ , Nih5n Chugoku gakkaiho Q ^ ^ ^ t 33), examines the phenomena of opposi tion in succeeding generations and identity across intervening generations in the Zhao-Mu institutions under the Zhao or the Mu line, respectively, and says that this can not be explained in terms of group institutions. Kurihara Keisuke ^ , "On Ancient Chinese Belief in Ritual and Notions of Time" ("Kodai Chugoku ni okeru girei no shinnen to sono jijitsu no kannen" is. ^ ^ if! i - ^ t % n a /^r , Daito bunka daigaku, Kiyo: Jimbun kagaku At A, ^ 19), explains that belief in ritual, whether auspicious or in auspicious, was basically dependent on the divine function possessed by heav en and earth, sun and moon, stars and planets, the four seasons, yin and yang j^. The same author, in "The Han People's Primitive Psychology of Wailing at Funerals" ("Kan minzoku no sorei ni okeru kokuyo no genshi-teki shinsei" ^ ^ f - 3V 5 ^ ^ &lt;n !$fs -j&amp; &lt;r&gt; l)'4 , Daito bunka daigaku, Kangaku kaishi j^ 20), seeks the origi nal forms and notions of such wailing (kuyong ^ ) evidenced in the Yi li and Li ji S2.. In addition, Kasagawa Naoki ^ ''I , "On Children and Religious Ceremonial in Yin Times" ("Indai ni okeru kodomo to shukyo girei"^ ^ -K I - ^ i f ^ ^ » Toho shukyo 58), examines Yin oracle-bone inscriptions for notions of childhood, from conception and birth to adulthood. Tetsui Yoshinori •tf'» "A Proposal Concerning she" ("Sha ni tsuite no ichi shiron" 17-?-±0 I - * 1 ~Z cT) — Tohogaku ^ 61), draws up a list of all existing theories regarding she itself, concludes that, whatever the ma terial—wood, earth or stone—that the she functioned as a universal axis join ing heaven to earth. Kumagai Osamu , "Concerning Vermillion in Ancient China" ("Kodai Chugoku no shu ni tsuite" [-O i ^ "C , Tokogaku), emphasizes that of all the shades of red in an cient China vermilion, in particular, was felt to have the power to ward off evil spirts and to preserve sanctity. The author deduces that vermilion, by comparison with cinnabar and other shades, was a deeper red. Nakabachi Masakazu (?) "ff , "The Worship of Animal-gods in Ancient Chi na" ("Chugoku kodai no dobutsu-gami suhai ni tsuite" ^ A\ "f?b '$7 X Tohogaku 62), points out that, among ancient Chinese sacrifices, there were cases where the victim (?) was</page><page sequence="9">Shigaku Zasshi 101 a human being who, possessed by a beast, then turned into the beast himself. Araki Hiroko 0 S- &gt; "The Religious Character of the Shuoren and the Interpretation of the Poem of that Title in the Weifeng " ("Sekijin no shuky5-teki seikaku to Eifu sekijin hen no kaishaku" &lt;0 A;, ^ %f\ , Tohogaku), holds that the shuo^ji of shuoren is another way of writing "stone" (shi^Ez ), a symbol of river-spirits. Fukino (?) Yasushi , "Means used in Ancient China to Halt Rain" ("Chugoku kodai shiu ko" ^ )Mj -it- ^ , Koku gakuin zasshi ]^| ^ 82.10), focusses on zhiyu \?f\ , the process of bringing an end to rain, which has generally been overlooked be cause it was not as prominent as prayers to bring on rain. Fukatsu Tanefusa /!?&gt; &gt; "Thought and Life in Ancient China: Concerning Exorcism by Mirrors" ("Kodai Chugoku no shiso to seikatsu - kagami ni yoru harai ni tsuite" "V &lt;71 t iZ irj' l/Z. —5 v * ~X , Nisho gakusha daigaku Toyo gaku kenkyujo shukan X -fe; /iz" 'K 11), explains, by quotations combined from both old and new material, the various mystical powers at tributed to the mirror by the ancient Chinese, in part no doubt, because an cient mirrors did not reflect things very clearly. Lastly, though it is not devoted exclusively to sacrifice and ceremony, there is Egashira Hiroshi \,~% II , "Anthropological Study of the Zuo zhuan, Part 2" ("Saden minzoku kc£ , Tokyo gakuei daigaku, Dainibumon ~32 ^ 'j^L. 'K if ^ f*\ ), which collates evidence from other sources with that of the Zuo zhuan to illuminate 10 topics including altars of earth and grain (sheji is? ), solar eclipses, mountains and rivers, etc. The following articles deal with pre-Han literary evidence. Where the Shi jing is concerned, in addition to the above-mentioned works by Shimura and Araki, there is also one by Kubuki Shigehiro tK. 'Jb A , "Rhet oric and Form in Ancient Chinese Poetry" ("Chugoku kodai shi no shuji to keishjki - Shikyo no kyo to joei ni tsuite" 3s AK *~&gt; Y. A" — S^f- &lt;T) t ^ ~C , Chugoku shiso shi kenkya f g] &amp; # % 4), in which xingi^ and dieyong &lt;J|&gt; "3^ in the Shi jing are studied. Focusing on the points in common between xing and dieyong in the Shi jing he seeks their original form in ancient nature beliefs. Xing he holds to be an interpretation and illustration of nature by resort to mythological anthropomorphism; while dieyong is, in his view, the process whereby the notion of veneration of the gods is emphasized. Kano Yoshimitsu ~t&amp; , "The Function of Stereotypical Expressions in the Shi jing" ("Shikyo ni okeru ruikei hyogen no kino" "Srf I - &lt; t % ^5! ^ ' N'hon Chugoku gakkaiho 33), explains the varied</page><page sequence="10">102 trans. Leon N. Hurvitz stereotypical expressions (including other fixed expressions and repetitive phrases as well), and, on this basis offers a more precise interpretation of the Shi jing. Two studies of the Lun yu should be mentioned: Sat5 Ichir5 i/£ — , "The Analects of Confucius and the Meaning of the Word ren" ("Kongo to jin no jigi" , Chugoku gaku ronbun shu ^ )S] ) and Onozawa Seiichi ^Intel lectual Historical Study of the Monarchy of Lu and the Three Sons of Duke Huan based on the Lun yu" ("Rongo ga toriageru Ro no kunshu to san Kan no taifu ni tsuite no shisoshi-taki k5satsu" ^ J'j Jt- | -f' -3 0~&gt; Jf £ I 3- ^ , Nisho Gakusha daigaku, Toyogaku kenkujo shukan ^ -f1)). In the former the variety of words in the Lun yu that indicate human relationships are considered, while in the latter the position of Confucius with regard to the Marquis of Lu and the three sons of Duke Huan is studied. Hitoiro Hideki — » "Mozi's Citations from the Zhou shu in the Shangshu" ("Bokushi ni okeru Shosho Shujo no in'yo ni tsuite" p ^ ( : #y ^ \ ^ $1 ^ &gt; Kokugakuin zasshi 1^1 J&amp;82.1), argues that the peculiar nature of Mozi's citation of the Zhou shu, for instance, his ascription to the Shu of texts now found only in the Shi, was probably a device to supplement the Zhou shu, the transmis sion of which was tightly controlled, by attributing to the Shu extraneous material. However, on the other hand, the suggestion that, since the trans mission of the Shu was also, in all likelihood, an oral one, its style probably had much in common with that of the Shi is a fruitful proposition. Two stud ies on the Zhou li worthy of noting are: Ochi Shigeaki "if , "The Financial Agrarian and Corvee Institutions as Recorded in the Zhou li" ("Shurai no zaisei seido, densi, ekisei o megutte" &lt;^&gt; $C ^ ' ^7 m\ ■ i'l t &gt;5 c -o , Kyushu daigaku Toyo shi ronshu ■K ^ 9) and Ueyama (Kamiyama?) Shunpei ^ , "The Fangming and the Institution of the Six Officers in the Zhou li" ("Shurai no rikkan sei to homei" p )^J ^Lj\ gakuho [Kyoto] 53). Ikeda Yuichi &gt;t£ ® ~ , "The Development of Human Settlements in Ancient China" ("Chugoku kodai no juraku no tenkai" y£r &lt;ry ^ , Rekishi gaku kenkyu [separate issue] pg. ^ ^ ^ff $L), is the text of a report delivered last year at the Society for Historical Research meeting. It has a theme that seems more appropriate to the War ring States period, but I should like to draw attention to his statements indi cating that the break up of the juluo Iff settlements into separate vil lages, beginning in the Longshan period, extended through the Warring States and the Qin into the Han.</page><page sequence="11">Shigaku Zasshi 103 To conclude, let me cite three studies which, while not directly related to the study of history, nevertheless provide specialized knowledge in their respective fields. They are; Hashimoto Keizo , "Constellations and Astronomical Calculations in pre-Qin times" ("Sen Shin jidai no seiza to tenmon kansoku" 'K ^ ^ , Toho_gakuho [Kyot3 53); Ishida Hidemi X-z ^ ^ ^ , "The Ancient Chinese View of Mental Disorders: the Problem of 'Irrationality' in Ancient China" (Chugoku kodai ni okeru seishin shippei kan - Chu~goku kodai ni okeru hi 'risei' no mondai" I- 't* * ^ P &lt;n , Nihon Chugoku gakkaiho ^ ^ d2 g] $]§L 33); Shindo Hideyuki ^ ^ , "Concerning Ancient China's Musical Instruments" ("Chugoku kodai no gakki ni tsuite" ^ ^ 4V ^ 4^ U (IT , Kangaku kaishi £|t ^ 20)» ZHANGUO, QIN, AND HAN Shiba Ryotaro , possibly due to the influence of his Xiang Yu and Liu Bang (Ko U to Ryu Ho ^ *^ij , Shincho sha m ), a best seller the year before last, seems to have inspired the prolif eration of publications by men of letters on the history of ancient China. In particular, there is Chin Shunshin (Chen Shunchen fipjp @L , History of China [Chugoku no rekishi H-] cr&gt; ], Heibonsha; the second vol ume deals with the Chunqiu and Zhanquo periods and the third volume with the Qin and Han; a Biographical History of China (Jimbutsu Chugoku no rekishi tffi] ej2 ^jS| &lt;n ^ ). It appears that the question of how the relationship between literature and history and the question of how history is to be popularized have again become the subject of debate among historians of ancient China as well. Since, however, this is not the place to recount this debate, we will only deal with historical studies. As a university textbook, or as a general work aimed at a broad public, there is Nishijima Sadao imi vK. 3- , The Society and Economy of An cient China (Chugoku kodai no shakai to keizai ^ i &lt;r&gt; t , Todai Shuppankai it )&gt; a work based on the author's previous publications, but including additional research as well. He takes a broad view of China's government, society and economy from the Yin and Zhou down to the Six Dynasties, while focusing mainly on the Han period. In an effort to combat the modern, European-inspired view of a stagnant Chi</page><page sequence="12">104 trans. Leon N. Hurvitz nese society, he devotes many pages to accounts of ancient China's agricul tural techniques and management, a feature not usually found in this type of work. The usefulness of this work would be enhanced by the addition of an index of proper names and historical terms. The following articles cover the whole field of Zhanguo, Qin and Han. Toshima (Toyoshima?) Shizuhide $ ^ , "Class and Class Struggle under China's Ancient Autocracy" ("Chugoku kodai sensei shugi ni okeru kaikyu to kaikyu toso" HO ^ i"\ j|- #&gt;'J 3; 1 ffilf tyk. m\ , Rekishi gaku kenkyu /§: 5^ ^ No. 489). The author, following Marx's typology, considers the form of political rule under Qin and Han to be one of "Oriental despotism"; its economic structure relying on the definition of classes in Lenin's "great original idea," replaces the previous concept of general slavery with that of "Asian serfdom." Ac cording to the author, the primitive community which was based on kinship changed in the second stage into a community revolving directly around the individual's relation to the land, a community which was controlled through a bureaucracy by the State embodied in the person of the emperor and this was the nature of the Qin and Han empires. He stresses occupation of the land by the peasants as members of a community, State ownership of the land, and the myth of the State as the means of exploitation. Basically, I, too, support his interpretation. If, however, his quotes from texts constitute his primary evidence - e.g., the apportionment of official functions in the Guan zi chap ter, "On the Establishment of Government" () in the Xun Zi "Royal Institutions" ( ;£ ) and the "Agricultural Codes" ((S ) of the Qin -then the evidence is far from adequate. If we are to go beyond the peculiarity of the formation of class society (in China) to obtain a more concrete picture of the process by which this imperial structure was formed, it will be necessary to elucidate the real conditions of the community in the Qin-Han period in connection with this stage of the development of its productive forces. Furthermore, a concrete picture of the class struggles of this period does not emerge from this article. Ikeda Yuichi , The Development of Human Settlements in Ancient China (Chugoku kodai juraku no tenkai ^ |sj] ^ /Pc , Rekishigaku kenkyu ^ [separate issue]), examines the nature of settlements from the Neolithic to the end of the Han and their relationship to State power. This is a good study that brings together and systematizes the author's earlier monographs on this subject. The main points might be summarized as follows: 1. Not only in the pre-Qin, but under the Qin and Han as well, the form of settlement was predominatly the "natural village"; walled cities, whether the capital or other sites, were formed by combin ing these "natural villages." 2. From the Western Zhou on, settlements became less a matter of kinship, than of place, and there was constant division and seg mentation.</page><page sequence="13">Shigaku Zasshi 105 3. Even in the Zhanguo there was neither formation nor change of collective settlements by the State; only with the accession of Han Gaozu (r. 206-194 B.C.), when the village elders, known as san lap JL and fu lao 6C. ^ were incorporated into local administration, did state control over the "natural village" occur, and only with the accession of Wudi (r. 140-86 B.C.) was the con nection Emperor - fu lao - "natural village" institutionalized. 4. The longstanding theory, that the revitalization of agriculture was guaranteed by State-sponsored waterworks operating from the Zhanquo period, cannot be verified; it is only from the reign of Wudi on that this took place. One of the strengths of this work is that Ikeda has succeeded in reconstruct ing a concrete picture of settlements themselves, rather than simply consid ering them from the standpoint of the powerful state. Goi Naohiro .2. 7^ , "A Proposal Concerning the History of Class Struggle in Ancient China: Construction of City Walls during the Chunqiu and Zhanquo" ("Chugoku kodai kaikyu toso shiron - Shunju Sengoku ki no jokaku zoei o megutte" ^ §•] ^4K Ml ^ ^ in History and Theory of the Class Struggle, Part Two: The Class Struggle in Pre-Modern Society [Zen Kindai shakai ni okeru kaikyu toso: Kaikyu toso no rekishi to riron iI - I f % par Si *8 f= ],AokiShoten ~%fik )&gt; concludes on the basis of research on fortifications and on the or ganization of the labor force for construction, that, generally speaking, be cause of the construction of fortifications (rural) people outside were relo cated inside the cities and organized into small groups (lit., "five-man units," wu fa ), resulting in the break-up of clan concentrations. This generated popular resistance; the fact that the State then had to assume communal and corporate functions is seen as a manifestation of class struggle. Since Goi's and Ikeda's interpretations clash, one looks forward to further discussion. Yoshinami Ryuji -&amp;J- Fir®] , in his "Shang Yang's 'Law of Separation' (fenyi zhi fa V&amp; ) and the Power of the Qin Government" ("Sho O 'bun'i no ho' to Shincho kenryoku" ^ V&amp;-s /7, Rekishigaku kenkyu 494), considers approaches to the problem of state power and society in ancient China. The core of the article, however, seems to be an attack on several of my own articles. 1. The first question is whether, from a discussion of the relationship between King Xuan of Qi ^ iJl and the Jixia ~f Academy, when the Tian clan was governing the state, the relationship between the Qin and Han monarch and servitor may be characterized as a continuation of the host-guest relationship.</page><page sequence="14">106 trans. Leon N. Hurvitz 2. The second is whether Shang Yang's first revision of the laws was, as a policy, sufficient to meet the military requirements. 3. The third involves the form of the family as seen by one's treat ment of the "Law of Separation." Since this is not the place to undertake a debate on our differences and since I still have questions about interpretation of material that he himself cites (for example, the Qin bamboo strips from Yunmeng), I will publish a rebuttal at a later date. The same author's "Reexamination of the Ancient Chinese Theory of Hills and Marshes" ("Chugoku kodai santaku ron no sai kento" , in Studies on Chinese Waterworks in Honour of the Sixtieth Birthday of Dr. Sato [Sat5 hakushi kanreki kinen Chugoku suiri shiron shu fg. ^ ~j^ %?_ WM % ], Kokusho Kanko kai jgj "J" ^ /^- ), is a critique of Masu buchi Tatsuo's "theory of mountains, forests, thickets and marshes" • The mountains, forests, thickets and marshes were, at least until the Qin, under community control, not regarded by the ruler as his own household property, but used by merchants and artisans for their profit. They were taxed under the first Qin emperor, but one cannot conclude on this evidence that they provided an economic basis for state power. A response from Masubuchi is expected. If I may anticipate a bit, it seems unlikely, contrary to the author's view, that Masubuchi is proceeding in a way similar to that of Engels in The Origin of the Family and the State. That will surely be understood by considering the theory of mountains, for ests, thickets and marshes in the context of Masubuchi's writings. Watanabe Shin'ichiro \ &amp; , "Extrapolating from the 'Shang nong' chapter of the Lfl shih chun giu: Social Organization under Qin and Han" ("Ryo shi shunju 'Jono hen' reisoku—Shin Kan jidai no shakai hensei") in Kyoto furitsu daigaku, Gakuei h5ko: Jimbun g ft||i#'|dflX &lt;*&gt; 33), first provides a detailed textual critique and a modern translation of the Lti shih chun qiu 'Shang nong' chapter and concludes that the author/com piler was either Li Si ^ , or one of his disciples, who belonged to the tradition of Xun Zi. Next, investigating the social structure of the late Zhanguo and Qin that lay behind this chapter, he concludes that it was based on physical differences and the social division of labor. Lists of individuals and assignment to corvee labor or military service were based on height, while historical sources reveal that exemption from assigned work was based on age. Regarding the social division of labor, this issue was agricultural management within the framework of social relations, in particular, work and division of labor, an approach that is evident in the whole chapter. This study points out that corvee labor and military services must be viewed as compo nents of labor necessary for the maintenance of society. Watanabe criticizes the view that the peasants were simply exploited by the State. It is a note worthy study, one that presents many points worthy of discussion, both philo logical and theoretical.</page><page sequence="15">Shigaku Zasshi 107 Turning to articles based on archaeological material and excavated cultural artifacts, first there is Ikeda Atsushi ffl ysa- , "Phases in the Study of Inscribed Chinese Wood and Bamboo" ("Chugoku ni okeru kandoku kenkyu no iso" ^ t- %&gt;' It % )r$[ cn , Mokkan kenkyu L 3), who lucidly explains the state of recent Chinese scholar ship. His study is divided into four sections: (1) General Survey and Research Trends, (2) Bamboo Inscriptions from a Qin Tomb at Shuihudi, (3) Han Bamboo Strips from Juyan, and (4) Miscellaneous, plus a list of Chinese and Japanese research articles, all of which is extremely useful. Emura Haruki &gt;1 /fcj"&gt;&lt;2. ^jN", "Changes in Graphics in the Wood and Bamboo Inscriptions in the Zhan quo, Qin, and Han" ("Sengoku Shin Kan kandoku manji no hensen" ^ ]fT| • &amp; f" n &gt; Toho gakuho [Kyoto] 53), meticulously ex amines the styles of writing and the forms of graphs in these inscriptions, proving that between the period of the Warring States and the Qin there were striking changes. A list of the forms of graphs for the period studied is in cluded. This study should prove to be a basic text for researchers who make use of historical materials inscribed on wood and on bamboo. The same au thor's article, "Fengni Belonging to Chen Jieqi and Housed in the Tokyo National Museum with Particular Reference to Their Shapes and Uses" ("Tokyo kokuritsu hakubutsu kan hokan Chin Kaiki kyuzo no fudei - toku ni sono keishiki to shiyo ho ni tsuite" ^ 52 ^ t — t &lt; [Z --&gt;&lt;,&gt; x. j Museum 364), divides fengni (seals impressed on clay) into six types with explanations accompanied by photographs, all useful for study ing fengni. Study of Qin bamboo inscriptions unearthed from Shuihudi, Yunmeng (hereafter: Qin bamboo inscriptions) is now at its peak, even in Japan, and is frequently mentioned in studies cited above. Four articles prin cipally concerned with these finds are: A. Ikeda Yuichi, "A Personal View of the Qin Tomb in Yunmeng, Shuihudi in Hubei" ("Kohoku Unbo Suikochi Shinbo kanken" it ^ , Chuo daigaku bungakubu, Kiyo ^ ^ ~K % 26). The author first studies in detail the tomb's form and the objects excavated. Second is a historical and geographical study of the marsh and the old walled city of Yunmeng. Third are some conclusions about the official position and the professional duties of Xi -g- , the de ceased. Fourth is an examination of the character of the various codes (the agricultural one in particular). He concludes that: 1. Xi was probably among the second generation of people from Qin who had moved there after the conquest of Chu ^ . 2. His titles, lingshi ^ and chiyu , do not represent the functions of an employee or low rank working for a pittance.</page><page sequence="16">108 trans. Leon N. Hurvitz 3. It is very possible that the Qin codes were drawn up in the region "Within the Passes" before the conquest of Chu. 4. The agricultural codes (tianltt •£? ) presumably applied only to governing Chu parks and public fields and did not include all land. This is a noteworthy study, a careful examination constituting the basis of the same author's study cited above. Point No. 4, in particular, will probably elicit much controversy. B. Emura Haruki, "The Nature of the Qin Code Unearthed at Shuihudi, Yunmeng" ("Unb5 Suiko chi shutsudo Shinritsu no seikaku o megutte" fit^ 0 ^ ^ , Toyo shi kenkyu %. VL 40-1), considers, among the Qin bamboo inscriptions, the Qin codes as a whole and attempts to classify and characterize them on the basis of content. He makes the following points: 1. The state of Qin, from ancient times, had a variety of codes for the purpose of maintaining control over the state's material prop erty. At a certain time following Shang Yang's legal reform, a more comprehensive code was drawn up aimed at all government offices. It was a well-ordered code entitled xiaoltl . Even so, the old unrevised codes remained. Thus, in the Qin codes, there are clauses of different dates jumbled together. 2. The eighteen Qin codes are a summary of the provisions governing officials in the city and country. 3. By "city officials" (duguan ) are meant those posted to offices in the Capital as well as those detached for service in outlying areas. 4. The title neishi ^ in the Qin codes refers to an official as signed to the Capital. The Qin codes are basically codes for the neishi, men who served on what had always been Qin territory. This study together with that by Ikeda is a comprehensive examination of the subject to which students of the Qin codes will constantly refer. Further detailed study of each clause may yield conclusions different from the above. For instance, such views as the one that the code governing the granaries (canglu ) existed prior to Shang Yang are too conjectural. C. Kudo Motoo -J- 7C. % , "The Neishi under the Qin - Partic ularly in Light of the Bamboo Inscriptions from the Qin Tomb at Shuihudi" ("Shin no naishi - shu to shite Suiko chi Shinbo chikkan ni yoru" ^ co i I fk. ^ Vf jjifj ^ , Shigaku zasshi 90-3), has a different understanding of neishi and duguan from that of Emura.</page><page sequence="17">Shigaku Zasshi 109 1. According to him, the neishi, in Qin during the Zhanguo period, was in control, through the Grand Storehouse (taicang ), of all district granaries throughout Qin, which gave him authority over all grains and fodder. Through the imperial storehouse, he supervised the manufacture, the control, and the discarding of publicly owned implements. 2. After the Qin unification, control of the two granaries, the taicang and tainei ("grand storehouse" and "imperial storehouse") was taken away from the neishi and given to an "internal officer for the governance of grain" (zhisu nei shi ^ {*) )&gt; while the neishi became an officer whose function was to control popu lation increase in the Capital. The author's synthesis on the basis of the Qin bamboo inscriptions is quite impressive, but as regards the second part of point No. 2, which is lacking in supporting evidence, he appears to have pushed his conclusions a bit too far. D. The same author, in "The Tainei and Shaonei as Seen in the Bam boo Inscriptions from the Qin Tomb at Shuihudi: "The Origin of the Shaofu Under the Qin" ("Suiko chi Shinbo chikkan ni mieru tainai to shonai - Shin no shSfu no seiritsu o megutte" f^ ^ J§: Vf (- &lt;&amp;- x. 7a. £ '|&lt; -ft _ Co X &gt; Shikan &lt;£^70LlO5), says that the shaonei of Qin, during the Zhanguo period, was a treasury official under the authority of the tainei, a local functionary in charge of the collection and disbursement of public funds. Later the same official, now subordinate to the shaofu 'Y, the office of the emperor's household finances, became a treasurer charged with the collection and dis bursement of the jinqian (the emperor's household money) under the auspices of the yiting^. (the office of the imperial harem). This change, together with that of the zhisu neishi after the Qin victory was, he states, due to the formation of the shaofu. He also attempts to prove, in opposition to Yan Gengwang /0^ jiff ^ , that there was no shaofu in the commanderies and districts of the Han.

This view is based on the attribution to Central China of the commercial activities described in the "Huo zhi lie zhuan" ^ in the Shi ji .

Having analyzed its nature, style and form, and translated into plain language, this work by Oba became a model for further study of Han documents. Murakami Yoshimi ^ , "The Baopuzi and Medical Texts Recently Unearthed from Han Tombs" ("Kanbo shin hatsugen no isho to Hobokushi" &lt;^&gt; S*t , Toho gakuho [Kyoto] ^ 53), a study of the Han medical bamboo inscriptions from Wuwei ^ and of the "Fifty-two Medi cal Prescriptions" (Wu_shi_^r_bing_^ang ) unearthed from Tomb No. 3 at Mawangdui ~i ■sf^_ , considers the significance of both medical texts in light of material of a medical nature found in the "Neipian" T*\] ^ of the Baopuzi. This will probably form the basis for further study of the history of medicine and pharmacology. Katayama Tomohito's ^ , "Study of the Written Materials Unearthed from Han Tomb No. 1 at Mawangdui" ("Ba Otai ichigo Kanbo shutsudo no monji shiryo no kenkyu" J -* 0~&gt; X ^ V &gt; Fukuoka kyoiku daigaku, Kiyo ^ |£] X , &amp;-&gt; ^ 30&gt; Monograph No. 5), is an epigraphic study of these materials.

Next, he com pares the First Emperor's mausoleum with the Zhanguo royal tombs, the lat ter intended to display the earthly power of their occupants, while the for mer, set upon a high hill erected for that very purpose, was meant to symbol ize absolute authority.

The fruits of this work should be of value to the study not only of art history but of Han social history as well. We shall examine chronologically research in political, social, and eco nomic history. Okada Isao's ■£? "The Kingdom of Chu and the Legal Reforms of Wu Qi"_("Sokoku to Go Ki henpo" 1%] ^ ^ ^ , Rekishigaku kenkyu 490), takes an overall view of the growth of royal power in Chu from the time of Kings Ling|f£and Ping^i. down to the end of the fifth century and of the resultant changes in the structure of the State, and concludes with an analysis of the legal reforms of Wu Qi. The author's view is that Wu Qi, a member of a prominent clan that had always supported the state of Chu, enhanced royal power by severing his ties with those princely clans that had grown distant from the royal house and rallying the newly prosperous clans, linked ever more closely to the king. There seem, however, to be some missing links between this view and the author's conclusion that, "While bringing various public institutions together under the aegis of the Chu king through the intermediary of the newly powerful hereditary clans, (Wu Qi) achieved a stabilization of tryannical power unique to Chu." Saito Saneo (Jitsuro?) in "The Pronouncements oj Li Kui" ("Ri Kai no shosetsu ni kan-suru ichi kosatsu" (0 1 - ' Shiteki 1) reexamines Li Kui's theory of "fully exploiting local re sources (jin di li shuo Wl )&gt; mentioned in the "Shi huo zhi" of the Han shu and deduces that the military rations of Wei^% as one of the War ring States were derived from eleven taxes. Nakamura Juichi (Mitsukazu?) *— &gt; in "The Enthronement of the King of Qin and the Position of the Bureaucracy" ("Shinno no sokui to kanryo no tachiba" ^ , in Studies in Honour of Mr. Nakashima Satoshi Part Two: [Nakashima Satoshi sensei koki kinen ronshu tp^ ^ ^5 IH J»fi3 4fr ^' Ky"ko Shoin &amp; ) contends that during the</page><page sequence="20">112 trans. Leon N. Hurvitz Zhanguo period from the time of King Hui-wen on, the Qin policy of "rating meritorious officials as was the practice of former kings," i.e., evalu ation of an official's performance according to codified standards as a basis for reassigning him, referred to the institutionalization of the assignment system which arose from Shang Yang's reforms. Hori Tsuyoshi (Takeshi? Takeru?) ^ |c5£ , "The Sefu Under the Qin and Han: a Study Based on the 'Boguan biao' ^ in the Hanshu and the Qin Bamboo Inscriptions from Yunmeng" ("Shin Kan jidai no shokufu ni tsuite—Kanjo 'Hyakkan hy5' to Unb5 Sfiinkan ni yoru ichi k5satsu" ^ ^ j, - -o v &gt; ~C ^ I ^ t Z £ % — % &gt; Shiteki 2), makes the following points: 1. The sefu as a village functionary originated under the Han and did not exist in Qin times. 2. The first character in the title -|§" is a homonym and homophone of , a word signifying "grain harvest." The "harvest man" came to be a collector of taxes in kind, hence the title. 3. Under the Qin, the sefu was a district officer whose function was to enforce administrative regulations. Once the "Nine-chapter code" (jiu zhang 1(1 ^ ) was promulgated, however, he was elevated to join the liecao ^i] ^ in rank. 4. Throughout the Qin and Han, the sefu is found among the official overseers of artisans (gong guan n. l~|f ). It is unclear, however, why the same title referred to both district officers and overseers of artisans; the origin of the change is puzzling. Yamada Kat suyoshi &lt;J-* *0 , "Sang-gong Yang and the Standardization of Tax Delivery: Finance and Commerce in Ancient China" ("Kin 'yu heijun to So ko Yo—Chugoku kodai ni okeru zaisei to shogyo" '^jp 'a ^ — ^ IS] % I- ^&gt;' If #1" f&gt;C t 1^) ^ , Toyo shi kenkyu ^ ^ 40-3), after surveying the connection in the first half of Harr Wudi's reign between the finances of the imperial house and the financial distress of the State, describes how with the rise of Sang-gong Yang, tax in money gave way to tax in goods. Thus, two posts were established, one, the "official in charge of the remittance of the taxes" (jun shu guan ), who also had sole control of the transport of salt and iron, which by then had become a monopoly; and, the other, the "fair standards officer" (ping zhun guan ip *3^ ^ ), who had sole control over the purchase of all goods for official use, in the attempt to standardize the market price of those goods and offically produced implements as well as receipt of the profits from their purchase and</page><page sequence="21">Shigaku Zasshi 113 sale. Finally, he recounts the adverse impact that this had on the big foreign merchants. This study is a critique of the theory of Kageyama Tsuyoshi iU |5)&gt;) . However, in the next issue there is a rebuttal; I should like to deter to next year an examination of the ensuing dispute. Tomita Takeyuki's (Kenji?) ^ , "Examination of the Political Structure Under the Former Han from the Regin of Wudi onwards: Understanding the So-called 'Inner Court'" ("Zen Kan Butei ki iko ni okeru seiji k5zo no ichi kosatsu— iwayuru 'Naich5' no rikai o megutte" t- I1~ ~C 9), Kyushu daigaku, Toyo shi ronshu fsj* wcflln , is a survey of the central government in the late Former Han, focus sing on the inner court. The author argues that the inner court after Wu di did not control the country, but always fulfilled a supplementary function on the basis of collective personal ties with the emperor. It ceased even to be an inner court in the reign of Cheng di, when the Shang shu became an auton omous organization with definite function, enabling Wang Mang, who con trolled it, to seize power. This is a noteworthy challenge to the hitherto accepted view. Osaki Yuji in, "The Red Eyebrow's Rebel lion— On the 'Commoners' Longing for the Han" ( -f^T/g &lt;F&gt; — "gj ~b!$- l - 1 N ) Chugoku nomin senso shi kenkyu ^ )^] {% ^ ft- ®)» takes up the question of whether peasants who joined rebellious groups such as that of the Red Eyebrows at the time of transition from the Former to the Latter Han, longed for a restoration of the Liu clan and the Han dynasty, as is commonly supposed. Based on a careful study of the historical sources and on analysis of the character of these various groups, he comes to the opposite conclusion. Since these rebellions had their own independent ideals and tendencies, I share the author's point of view, that these uprisings were essentially popular struggles. One study on agricultural technique is by Yoneda Kenjiro ^ S3 , "Rice Cultivation Between the Han and the Six Dynasties" ("Kan rikucho kan no tosaku gijutsu ni tsuite kako suino no sai kento o awasete" V V£ - &lt;0 # ^ "tt *C , Keiryo shigaku ^ )• Combined with a reexamination of a method of killing weeds in the field by burning and flood ing them (huogeng_shuijiou ), this study continues the author's long-standing debate with Nishijima on ancient Chinese techniques of rice cultivation. The following points are made: 1. The texts dealing with rice cultivators (daoren -fcg A_ ) for exam ple, in the Zhouli and in Zheng Xuan's commentary as well as Ying Shao's /^|, commentary to the "Annals of Wudi" in the Han shu, are based on the assumption of continuous cultivation of rice.</page><page sequence="22">114 trans. Leon N. Hurvitz 2. One can deduce from the Simin yueling *3E7 ^ , under the third month, the methods of rice cultivation, while from Zhang Heng's £iMtf "Nandu fu" not only can one deduce such methods, but also that there were two annual harvests of rice and wheat. 3. According to the Qimin yaoshu , rice production on the northern plateau was continuous, while along the Yangtze and the Huai rivers, dry and wet farming alternated every year. The method of cultivation, however, is not described for either. On the basis of recent archaeological research south of the Yangtze, it ap pears now that the method of killing weeds in the field by burning and flood ing them is no longer regarded as a primitive technique. One looks forward to continued research and discussion. In conclusion, there are several studies on the history of culture and ideas, as well as studies on individuals. Ito Tokuo (Norio?) % , in "The 'Ji zhe' and 'Guice' [Diviners] Annals in the Shiji" ("Shiki nissha, kisaku ryo retsuden ni tsuite" ^ ^ -?'] I - ^ X , in Collected Essays: History and Geography [Ronshu: Rekishi gaku, chiri gaku ^ ^ tf ] 11, Tohoku gakuin daigaku ^ ^1 t TO?), sees the inclusion of these two accounts in the Shi ji as reveal ing Sima Qian's profound concern with the world of the spirit as well as his own critical temper, and concludes his intention was to compare superior worthies in rustic retirement with scroundrels for whom divination was mere ly a means to make a living. Tanaka Masami ffl tL , "Ji An, A_ Member of the Huang-Lao Sect During the Reign of Wudi" ("Kan Bu ki no Ko Ro ha kyu An o megutte" *~&gt; ^ .'fit' % bb 4" , in Collected Essays in the Humanities [Jinbun ronshu A. ], 29, Joshi daigaku ^ ), attempts to describe the philos ophy of Ji An, a subject of Han Wudi who, while having as his ideal, "govern ment without effort" (wu wei zhi zhi ■$?, 21 ), lived his life by his skill in manipulating practical affairs as an administrative official. This is done by comparing him to the Confucian and Legalist bureaucrats who dealt with him through their common membership in the bureaucratic world. Ito Seiji's "Ancient Chinese Methods of Exorcising Wounds and the Misfortunes of War: A Study of the Shanhai jing" ("Kodai Chugoku no senka, kennan kaihi no juho—Sengai kyo no kenkyu" ^ Us] *0 ^ ^ ilt *■%. — rd* , Shigaku ^ ^ 50) is a very interesting, if brief, bit of research that makes the following points: When the Shanhai jing speaks of "avoiding blades" (bi bing ), or of "resisting blades" (yu bing ^ ), it is referring to what was later to be known as avoiding "trouble with swords," or "looking after wounds," all of</page><page sequence="23">Shigaku Zasshi 115 which demonstrates that the Shanhai jing was a work of divination and exor cism. Kageyama Terukuni , in "Natural Calamities and Gov ernment under the Han—With a Focus on the Chancellor's (zaixiang ) Responsibility for Natural Calamities" ("Kandai ni okeru saii to seiji saisho no saii sekinin o chushin ni" t~ ■£&gt; IT ^ ^K. ^ &lt;7~&gt; ^ t- , Shigaku zasshi 90 8), states that the ruler's power was not restrained by the "theory of portents and natural diasters" according to which, "If the ruler of men governs con trary to the Way, then Heaven will admonish him by inflicting natural calami ties. The ruler must therefore amend his personal conduct and his policies." Far from restraining him, the theory provided a means of preserving power and of shifting responsibility to others. It was also used by bureaucrats as a tool in their power struggles. This, the author makes clear, was true through out the Han, and he provides convincing evidence for each period, depicting the process until the political use of the notion of natural calamity itself comes to an end. Finally, The Collected Works of Yamada Osamu (Yamada Osamu cho saku shu &lt;_U \37 &gt; 4 volumes in all, published by Meiji Shoten Tft* ) has appeared. I wish to express my pleasure at the publica tion of the complete works of this now deceased giant in the field of the history of ancient Chinese thought, a collection including some works not published during his own lifetime.</page></plain_text>
