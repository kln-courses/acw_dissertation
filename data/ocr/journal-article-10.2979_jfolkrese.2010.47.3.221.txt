<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical  Folklore Studies Abstract: This article addresses the scholarly lacunae surrounding An- tonio Gramsci’s contributions to folklore studies in the English-speaking  world. It contends that Gramsci’s critique of folklore has often been mis- understood because it has not been read in tandem with his comments  on language, common sense, and religion, nor has it been contextual- ized by his discussions of distinctions among folklore, philosophy, and  science. This article provides a close reading of Gramsci’s commentaries  and draws a brief comparison with the work of Hans-Georg Gadamer in  order to adapt these ideas for contemporary research, reclaim folklore’s  political legitimacy, and promote a critical folklore studies that would  overtly address political dilemmas and human suffering.  In 1982, more than a quarter-century ago, Moyra Byrne called upon  English-speaking folklorists to engage the work of Italian Marxist  intellectual Antonio Gramsci (1891–1937). Remarkably few have ac- cepted that challenge to date, and those who have done so generally  emphasize Gramsci’s direct comments on folklore (e.g., Dundes 1999;  Limón 1983).1 This limited engagement is understandable, however,  as Gramsci did not present a favorable opinion of folklore—which he  generally took to mean parochial cultural expressions such as super- stitions—and often called for its eradication. While insisting that  folklore “must not be considered an eccentricity, an oddity or a pic- turesque element, but something which is very serious and must be  Journal of Folklore Research, Vol. 47, No. 3, 2010 Copyright © 2010 Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology, Indiana University 221 </page> <page sequence="2"> 222 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 taken seriously,” he nevertheless recommended that educators exam- ine traditional customs in order “to know what other conceptions of  the world and of life are actually active in the intellectual and moral  formation of young people, in order to uproot them and replace them  with conceptions which are deemed to be superior” (1985:191). As  Byrne discerns, this paradox demonstrates that Gramsci approached  folklore as an influential aspect of social life replete with political  ramifications. Recently, I presented a case for developing an overtly critical  folklore studies—a mode of scholarly activity akin to critical cultural  studies—whose production and application of critique and criticism  would aim to enact more equitable social formations, redress human  suffering, and interrupt oppressive political domination (Gencarella  2009, forthcoming). In this article, I intend to uphold Gramsci as a  vital interlocutor for contemporary folklorists and demonstrate how  his work contributes to a critical agenda. I make this claim saluting his  already far-reaching influence in other critical research (such as the  identity studies of Stuart Hall, the postcolonial studies of Gayatri Spi- vak, and the radical democratic project of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal  Mouffe) and his indefatigable conviction regarding the possibility of  establishing a new hegemony and new political orientations.2  While at least one folklorist has lamented the “endless use of the  terms ‘hegemony’ and ‘subaltern’ by [Gramsci’s] followers” (Davies  2001:115), both ideas have proven useful for others in folklore studies  and related fields (e.g., Gates and Weller 1987; Gilman 2004; Limón  1994; Naithani 2006; Ó Giolláin 2000; Peña 1985, 1999, 2008; Porter  1993; Santino 1996; cf. Crehan 2002; Landy 1986; Woolard 1985).  Because Gramsci’s ideas about hegemony so closely inform his views  about folklore, it is worth reviewing this fundamental concept before  proceeding to an analysis and adaptation of those views. As Raymond  Williams details in his 1977 work Marxism and Literature, Gramsci’s con- ceptualization of hegemony incorporates and extends notions about  ideology and culture. In searching for a way to explain how a small  ruling class establishes and maintains dominance over large popula- tions, Gramsci contends that those in power do not govern strictly by  force; they must also obtain the consent of the dominated. Hegemony  accordingly attends to consciousness, to ways of thinking. A regime  achieves domination in part because others take its ways of thinking  as the norm and come to accept their own status at the periphery.  </page> <page sequence="3"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 223 For Williams, a twofold advantage recommends this concept over  less refined Marxist ideas. First, it sutures domination and subordi- nation to the processes of social organization and socialization—as  Gramsci himself asserts, “[e]very relationship of ‘hegemony’ is neces- sarily an educational relationship” (1971:350). Second, it emphasizes  cultural activity as basic rather than superstructural. As a lived process,  hegemony is educative, radiating from cultural centers and deriv- ing from a desire for prestige (cf. Ives 2009). As a relation of power  between the ruling class and the dominated, hegemony forefronts  identity construction as a fundamental political activity. Additionally,  hegemony is never complete or exhaustive. There is never a single,  eternal hegemony; hegemonic orders are in always in competition— rising, falling, incorporating, and being incorporated into others.  Dominant hegemonies do arise, however, relative to other ways of  organizing consciousness. And the struggle for hegemonic control  unfolds at scales both local and global.  As this essay details, folklore is implicated in hegemony through  several means. As a body of performances and localized knowledge,  folklore records previous ways of thinking in hegemonies come to  pass. More importantly for Gramsci, folklore bears a constitutive po- tential, insofar as a people are the ideas they believe and practice—the  worldviews they embody and around which they construct identities.  As he envisioned, a people limited to traditional, parochial worldviews  and their inherent inconsistencies would remain unable to organize  politically. Gramsci’s belief that folklore helped undergird the domi- nant regime of his time partly explains why he accused “the admirers  of folklore, who advocate its preservation,” of intellectual teratology  (1971:197): he regarded such a position as tantamount to preventing  educational and political mobility. Any serious exploration of Gramsci’s  perspective must respond to this vantage point. A brief historical explanation of historical circumstances is war- ranted in order to understand Gramsci’s objection to folklore as it  concerns his views on education. After unification in 1861, Italy re- mained divided culturally, economically, and politically between the  industrialized North and the impoverished South (Gramsci 2006).  In 1921 Gramsci helped found the PCI, the Italian Communist Party.  Benito Mussolini led the National Fascist Party to power in 1922. The  following year Giovanni Gentile, Mussolini’s Minister of Education,  launched a major reform that maintained rather than ameliorated  </page> <page sequence="4"> 224 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 regional differences. In 1924 Gramsci became Secretary General of  the PCI and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house  of the Italian Parliament. Two years later, he was arrested in Mus- solini’s purge of oppositional parties and sentenced to twenty years  imprisonment; Gramsci died a prisoner in 1937. In 1929, the year  Gramsci began keeping his prison notebooks, the fascist government  enacted the Lateran Treaty with the Roman Catholic Church, which  among other actions, made catechism mandatory in public education.  Gramsci felt that this mandate privileged religious inculcation over  rigorous study. In response to what he regarded as a overt attempt to  deny a majority of people access to education in science, philosophy,  and institutional languages, Gramsci advocated for common schools  guided by Marxist principles.  Akin to all Marxists, Gramsci championed the proletariat (the peas- ants and working classes) and the creation of a new hegemony that  would represent their interests and impugn bourgeois ideology, fas- cism, and capitalism. As a key figure in Western Marxism—understood  as “the revolt against the orthodox [Marxist] tendency to interpret the  historical development of society solely in terms of the production of  material objects”—Gramsci also attended to subjectivity, conscious- ness, “cultural objects[,] and spiritual factors in social development”  (Femia 1987:2). He upheld the Communist Party as the vehicle for  such transformation. Unlike orthodox Marxists, Gramsci did not envi- sion the party as an entity charged with leading the proletariat; rather,  he emphasized its duty to reeducate the subaltern about Marxism— what he called the “philosophy of praxis,” partially to mollify prison  censors—and to strip the current ruling classes of prestige.  It is impossible in one article to review all the Gramscian concepts  that have entered academic or everyday parlance, but in the first  half of what follows I attempt to present a thorough examination of  Antonio Gramsci’s comments on folklore. I do this by setting those  ideas within the wider context of his work, especially with respect to  his notions of hegemony and education. Generally, Byrne and other  English-speaking folklorists have concentrated on Gramsci’s overt  commentary in “Observations on Folklore,” a brief essay he wrote dur- ing his incarceration. These folklorists mention but do not explicate  correlates to folklore such as language, common sense, and religion,  nor do they discuss in detail his comparison of folklore with philoso- phy and science. This article seeks to rectify these lacunae and offer a  </page> <page sequence="5"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 225 more nuanced appreciation of Gramsci’s critique of folklore. I hope  to demonstrate that such a revisioning is crucial for promoting critical  folklore studies and advancing folklore’s political viability.  Drawing upon Gramsci for the promotion of folklore and criti- cal folklore studies is not a simple task, but upholding a Gramscian  perspective does not equate to pious importation of his ideas. As  Stuart Hall once rallied the Left under Thatcherism (1987, 1988),  the point is not to treat Gramsci as a prophet nor his writings as tools,  but rather to adapt his perspectives on politics to the contingencies  of a particular historical moment. In contemporary American society,  for example, many on the Right advocate religious instruction rather  than science education; opposition to this agenda by the Left would  remain consistent with Gramsci’s critique of folklore. On the other  hand, for obvious reasons Gramsci could not see the potential benefit  of folkloric expressions for the labor and feminist movements, nor did  he envision the role religion could play in advancing civil rights. For- tuitously, however, Gramsci himself laid the ground for such flexible  mobilizations of folklore when he advocated “good sense,” a phenom- enon I will explore herein as a guide for navigating among folklore,  philosophy, and science and as an entry point for promoting a more  equitable political order through critical folklore studies. Gramsci’s Conceptualization and Critique of Folklore Gramsci’s “Observations” demonstrates familiarity with folklorists such  as Giuseppe Pitrè, whose collections of Sicilian folklore he praises.  Throughout his own writings, Gramsci designates several practices as  “folklore”: superstitions, magic, alchemy, witchcraft, beliefs in spirits,  popular moralities, proverbs, fables, and certain motifs (including  foresight of the blind or the restored noble hero) or conceptions as- sociated with particular worldviews (including lex naturalis). In addition  to these conventional forms, Gramsci contends that certain ideas, such  as literary appearances of a Nietzschean Übermensch-type, may possess  a “folk sense”; by this, he means depictions similar in motive to their  philosophical counterparts, but not formal philosophical expressions  (1985:355). Popular songs and regional or popular literature are re- lated to folklore in the same manner. Indeed, Gramsci directs sharp  censure at the (then still widely enjoyed) romance Guerino il Meschino,  </page> <page sequence="6"> 226 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 composed in the fifteenth century by Andrea da Barberino. Guerino,  writes Gramsci: represents a specific kind of popular literature, the most elementary and  primitive, which circulates among the most backward and “isolated” strata  of the people: especially those in the South, in the mountains, etc. Those  who read Guerino do not read Dumas or Les Misérables, let alone Sherlock  Holmes. There is a determinate folklore and a determinate “common  sense” which corresponds to these strata. . . . Observe how low the culture  must be of those strata who read Guerino and how little interest they take,  for example, in “geography” for them to be content with Guerino and to  take it seriously. One could analyze Guerino as an “encyclopedia” to obtain  information about the mental primitiveness and cultural indifference of  the vast stratum of people who still feed on it. (1985:351) Despite criticizing such works and the people who embraced them,  Gramsci also rejected Italian literature that envisioned peasants as  little more than “picturesque representatives of curious and bizarre  customs and feelings” (1985:213). This seeming contradiction serves  to presage Gramsci’s general stance: he stands in solidarity with the  working class and peasants, but calls them to aspirations beyond their  immediate intellectual, social, and political environments.  This admonitory but invested perspective guides Gramsci’s concep- tualization of folklore. Folklore is a serious matter for him precisely  because he considers it the “lowest level of popular culture” (1985:141),  a traditional conception of the world potentially so recalcitrant as to  become a veritable prison for those who understand the world only  through its veil. In the “Observations,” folklore is  a “conception of the world and life” implicit to a large extent in determi- nate (in time and space) strata of society and in opposition (also for the  most part implicit, mechanical, and objective) to “official” conceptions  of the world (or in a broader sense, the conceptions of the cultured parts  of historically determinate societies) that have succeeded one another in  the historical process. (1985:189) In addition to his claim that folklore takes an antagonistic position  toward official culture, Gramsci further submits that folklore is frag- mentary—that is, not coherent, systematic, or consistent—precisely  because it is stratified.3  The notion of fragmentation via stratification is essential to Grams- ci’s opinion of folklore and to his conceptualizations of language, com- </page> <page sequence="7"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 227 mon sense, religion, and even human personality. By stratification, he  means that a particular body of knowledge serves as a repository for  ideas once held by a dominant class and now dismissed.4 As an example  of this process, Gramsci points to the Ptolemaic model of the cosmos,  held as factual until the Copernican revolution. When scientists aban- doned the Ptolemaic model, that ordering of the universe nevertheless  continued as a widespread folk belief. In this manner, philosophy and  science continually contribute “new elements to ‘modern folklore’  in that certain opinions and scientific notions, removed from their  context and more or less distorted, constantly fall within the popular  domain and are ‘inserted’ into the mosaic of tradition” (1985:189).  Elsewhere, Gramsci wonders if Chinese and Indian belief systems will  become treated as folklore (in the sense of erroneous or antiquated  worldviews) as Western civilization and ideas infiltrate Asia, and he  credits the prevalence of folklore in the Muslim world to a sizeable  political distance between Islamic intellectuals and the people.  If folklore stands in opposition to the official part of society, it  is helpful to examine the phenomena Gramsci assigns to dominant  modes of thought and practice. Not surprisingly, modern science  and philosophy lead the list. Gramsci also distinguishes the creative  expressions of artists from folklore, identifying in folk art an attention  to more localized aesthetics. Furthermore, the State—for Gramsci, the  fascist government of Italy—stands ready to oppose folklore in order  to replace it with allegiance to the regime: Gramsci recognizes that a  government may be invested in eradicating folklore that challenges  the legitimacy and worldview of the ruling party.5 Finally, Gramsci  maintains that formal education in itself serves to correct the errors  of folklore. In his discussion of the educational system prior to Mus- solini’s government, for example, Gramsci asserts that children were  taught science and “civic rights and duties” that “conflicted with the  magical conception of the world and nature they absorbed from an  environment steeped in folklore”—or as he states bluntly, “The school  combated folklore” (1971:34). Contemporary folklorists might find Gramsci’s commentaries  troubling. On the surface, they appear to denigrate the subject and  practices to which we have dedicated our careers. They also seem- ingly bear the hallmarks of a turn-of-the-century elitism that decreed  folk thought primitive or antithetical to rational understanding.  But Gramsci’s position is more complex than a cursory reading sug- </page> <page sequence="8"> 228 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 gests. To contextualize his stance, it is helpful to consider his radical  reconceptualization of philosophy. Against a prejudice that upholds  philosophy as a “strange and difficult thing” or the “specific intellec- tual activity of a particular category of specialists or professional and  systematic philosophers” (1971:323), Gramsci argues that all humans  are philosophers. He implies much by this claim, but unquestionably  holds that education can permit everyone to achieve critical thought,  self reflection, and a better comprehension of science, politics, and  human society. He also believes that people may come to embrace the  philosophy of praxis (that is, a realized Marxism) and improve the  material conditions of their lives.  As evidence of the human capacity for critical thinking, Gramsci  introduces the notion of spontaneous philosophy—perhaps a more ap- propriate term would be vernacular philosophy—as the ground from  which more formal practices arise. The practice of spontaneous  philosophy demonstrates the human penchant and desire for critical  thought, even if that thought might be erroneous. Gramsci identifies  three distinct but kindred forms of social expression that together  constitute spontaneous philosophy: language, common and good  sense, and popular religion and folklore. To appreciate and adapt  Gramsci’s comments on folklore, it is imperative to understand these  related expressions. Taken together, they temper his dismissal of folk- lore, setting his concerns in dialogue with a critical philosophy that  promotes emancipation from oppression and fosters the creation of  new political subjectivities.  Gramsci’s views on language are the most developed, and they  provide a suitable barometer for his approach to the other forms of  spontaneous philosophy.6 Although he attests that all humans possess  an individual language in their style of speaking, he more regularly  emphasizes language’s collective nature, noting that all social groups  possess their own language. Several notions relevant to folklore in- form Gramsci’s analysis of language. The first are, as aforementioned,  stratification and fragmentation. As Peter Ives aptly summarizes, Gramsci  offers “a theory of language as a historical institution that changes  continuously” (2004:23). When discussing his ideas, for instance,  Gramsci employs an archaeological trope: The whole of language is a continuous process of metaphor, and the his- tory of semantics is an aspect of the history of culture; language is at the  </page> <page sequence="9"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 229 same time a living thing and a museum of fossils of life and civilizations.  When I use the word “disaster” no one can accuse me of believing in astrol- ogy, and when I say, “by Jove!” no one can assume that I am a worshipper  of pagan divinities. These expressions are however a proof that modern  civilization is also a development of paganism and astrology. (1971:450) Just as he regards folklore as a repository for dismissed ideas, Gramsci  regards language as a repository for terms and practices whose original  meanings transform over time. Language, like folklore, sustains both  fossils and innovations; understood with a positive valence, this take on  both modes of expression implies recognition of a potential—albeit  not necessarily realized—nexus of tradition and creativity.  A second concept important to Gramsci’s notion of language is  dialect. In his discussion of language and the arts, Gramsci identifies  several grades or ranges of expression that span increasing geographic  boundaries and influences: the provincial-dialect, the national-popular,  the religious-civilization, and the politico-cultural (1985:123). Folklore  exists at the provincial-dialect grade. On one level, the comparison  simply indicates localized expression: as the dialect of Canton differs  from those of Ballymenone and Sardinia, so too the folklore. For  Gramsci, however, folklore’s status in the provincial remains more  pressing, relevant to consciousness itself:  Someone who speaks only dialect, or understands the national language  incompletely, necessarily has an intuition of the world which is more  or less limited and provincial, which is fossilized and anachronistic in  relation to the major currents of thought which dominate world history.  His interests will be limited, more or less corporate or economistic, not  universal. (1971:325) As one learns new languages, one learns new conceptions of the world.  In Gramsci’s view, singular dialects, like folklore, may limit access to  other conceptions and thereby curtail opportunities to participate in  political and cultural movements. A third concept connecting folklore and language is irradiation, an  idea borrowed from Matteo Bartoli, the professor at the University of  Turin who directed Gramsci’s (unfinished) thesis in linguistics. Bartoli  was a pioneer in linguistic geography. Against the then-prominent neo- grammarians, he emphasized several aspects of language use that are  congruent with more contemporary performance-centered approach- es, such as the role of culture in linguistic change, the emergence of  </page> <page sequence="10"> 230 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 meanings within social contexts, and the nature of language as social  activity. As David Forgacs and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith explain in their  introductory remarks to one of Gramsci’s essays, Bartoli’s particular  innovation lay in designing a method for examining “a set of ‘areal  norms,’ according to which the earlier of two linguistic forms would be  found in a peripheral rather than central area, an isolated rather than  an accessible area, a larger rather than a smaller area” (1985:164). This  kind of analysis could track the diffusion of languages and linguistic  norms outward from centers of influence and mark historical changes  wrought by conquest.  A fourth concept important to Gramsci’s work (and again drawn  from Bartoli) is the idea of competition among languages. Bartoli  argued that as humans come into contact with one another, they must  choose (or are compelled to choose) which language to speak and  which linguistic expressions to privilege. Consequently, all languages  compete constantly (though unevenly and incompletely), reflecting a  history of political engagements. Bartoli’s work in this area emphasized  tensions between practices pushed to the literal periphery (such as the  countryside or more remote geographical areas) and those current  in economically and culturally powerful (and often urban) centers— and used to mark “peripheral” expressions as inferior. This dynamic  of a radiating linguistic influence helped explain “how one people  could conquer another not so much through the use of weapons, but  rather by imposing customs and modes of thought” (Ives 2004:28). It  is precisely this linguistic phenomenon that inspired Gramsci’s notion  of hegemony.  Through analysis of common sense—a second expression of spon- taneous philosophy— Gramsci evaluates the politics of the vernacular.  By common sense, Gramsci means the everyday philosophy of those  who are not professional philosophers or intellectuals; the phrase  refers to a “conception of the world which is uncritically absorbed  by the various social and cultural environments in which the moral  individuality of the average man is developed” (1971:419). As with all  forms of spontaneous philosophy, in Gramsci’s view common sense is  closely linked to the fragmentation and stratification of philosophical,  scientific, and political ideas throughout history, and it contributes  to the maintenance of hegemonic orders; specific examples include  theistic, Ptolemaic, anthropomorphic, and anthropocentric beliefs.  Gramsci utilizes a spatial metaphor to explain common sense, locat- </page> <page sequence="11"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 231 ing it midway between folklore and science, but he also refers to it  variously as philosophical folklore, the folklore of philosophy, a tra- ditional conception of the world, and the philosophy of the “man in  the street” (1995:301).  However, Gramsci does comment on noticeable differences be- tween folklore and common sense. With respect to dynamism, for  instance, Gramsci proposes that folklore tends to be more conserva- tive than common sense both politically (that is, folklore is less pro- gressive) and temporally (in his estimation, folklore is more reticent  to change). And while folklore (like dialect) is often localized to a  particular provincial region, common sense (like language) possesses  a broader reach because it also negotiates class distinctions. Every  social class bears its own common sense in competition with other  classes and in relation to the hegemonic system that determines class  hierarchy. The merit of common sense lies in its application of the  principle of causality in judgment, which Gramsci regards as generally  lacking in folklore, given the latter’s stress on tradition. The practical  implication is that common sense encourages one to reflect upon  class hierarchies, even when those rankings seem natural. According  to Gramsci, folklore rarely promotes conditions that would foster this  kind of reflexivity because it is the most conservative and traditional  form of knowledge.  Gramsci’s novel distinction between common sense (il senso com- mune) and good sense (il buon senso) revolves around the relative degree  of reflection. For Gramsci good sense is the “healthy nucleus” of com- mon sense, a fundamental component that can and should be made  “more unitary and coherent” through education (1971:328). Good  sense is not, therefore, merely competent use of the most reasonable  tactics permitted under a particular hegemonic order (such as keeping  silent under fascism); rather, it is the empirical and social knowledge  that promotes class consciousness, an understanding of the practices  of a given hegemony, and an awareness of the philosophy of praxis.  In its discriminating and coherent capacity, then, philosophy proper  relates more closely to good sense than it does to common sense.  Gramsci thus postulates progressively liberating forms of processing  experience, from folklore, to common sense, to good sense, and then  on to philosophy and science.7  To summarize thus far: folklore, common sense, and even language  itself are constituents of spontaneous philosophy. Although not critical  </page> <page sequence="12"> 232 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 in any formal way, each provides a conception of the world that dem- onstrates human proclivities for critical thought, and all are significant  and ubiquitous aspects of human identity construction. Each mode is  stratified and fragmented, preserving elements of previous historical  periods, yet each is also dynamic to varying degrees, with folklore the  most conservative among them. These formations are localized, in that  different groups possess different folklores, languages, and common  senses, and they compete politically with other cultural formations to  become the official, the hegemonic, the center of irradiating influ- ence—all part of what Gramsci calls a war of position. The third form of spontaneous philosophy, religion, presents a  special problem for Gramsci in both its institutional and vernacular  manifestations. Gramsci regards religion as both a collective phenom- enon and an individual practice. On the one hand, religion suffers  from the same inadequacies as its spontaneous counterparts. On the  other hand, the success and longevity of religious traditions demon- strate religion’s hegemonic viability. For Gramsci, religion is more  closely related to folklore than is common sense; he associates religious  belief with superstition and deems both antithetical to modern science  and philosophy. He does not claim folklore and religion are identical,  however, as religion (like common sense) remains a more dynamic  force. As with folklore and language, Gramsci contends that religion  too is fragmented and stratified—he claims, for example, that Italians  often practice paganism with a “Catholic husk” (1985:140)—and one  of religion’s liabilities is inconsistency between thought and action.  Although Gramsci considered institutional and popular religions  ranging from Shinto to American Calvinism, his abiding preoccupa- tion was Catholicism and its command upon the (Italian) masses.  While he identified the philosophy of praxis as the explicit antithesis  to Catholicism, he also perceived in the early Church a model upon  which historical materialism might take root at all levels of society,  since it could secure unity among disparate groups: The strength of religions, and of the Catholic Church in particular, has  lain, and still lies, in the fact that they feel very strongly the need for the  doctrinal unity of the whole mass of the faithful and strive to ensure that  the higher intellectual stratum does not get separated from the lower.  The Roman church has always been the most vigorous in the struggle to  prevent the “official” formation of two religions, one for the “intellectu- als” and the other for the “simple souls.” (1971:328) </page> <page sequence="13"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 233 Throughout his notebooks Gramsci charts the labyrinthine alli- ances of the (Italian) Catholic Church, held variously with aristocrats,  bourgeoisie, and peasants, and eventually precipitating “disciplinary  arms of the papacy” (Fulton 1987:211) through the Counter-Reforma- tion, condemnation of socialism, and treaties with Mussolini. In this  account, Gramsci suggests that the predominant strategy of Catholic  hegemony preceding the Reformation was re-absorption of popular  movements, “the creation of new religious orders centered on strong  personalities” such as Saint Dominic or Saint Francis, a practice that  “stitched over” divisions between intellectuals and the people through  vibrant solidarity (1971:331).  According to Gramsci, the Catholic Church imposed a more severe  order on popular religious movements during the Counter-Revolution  and frequently coerced its followers. This new approach assured unity,  but in a manner quite different from the Church’s earlier embrace of  popular movements. The new order aimed to divide intellectuals and  commoners. On the one hand, intellectuals were disciplined “so that  they need not exceed certain limits of differentiation and so render  the split catastrophic and irreparable” (1971:331). On the other, the  people were permitted celebrations, cults of saints, and their “crassly  materialistic” expressions of popular religion as long as they professed  to be Catholic. Furthermore, intellectuals were instructed not to ne- glect public rituals of baptism, marriage, and burial. Proclamation  of faith, not harmonization, cemented this militarism. As a result,  Gramsci wrote, religion in Italy had become “a pure narcotic for the  popular masses” (1971:338), allowing the very few to retain control.  This narcotic manifests in folklore: See, in Pitre’s Fiabe e leggende populari (p. 207), a popular Sicilian tale to  which. . . . there corresponds a woodcut of old Venetian prints in which  one sees God impart from heaven these orders: to the Pope: “Pray”; to  the Emperor: “Protect”; to the peasant: “Toil.” The spirit of these popular  tales depicts the conception of himself and of his position in the world  that the peasant has resignedly absorbed from religion. (1985:334–35) Gramsci sees the abandonment of the peasants and working classes  as the failure of modern Catholicism, a failure made more sinister after  the signing of the concordat with Mussolini’s government. He further- more avers that the concepts of individual sin and individual spirit  misrepresent humanity in that they neglect the role of other agents  </page> <page sequence="14"> 234 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 and the natural world in identity and personality construction and  thereby dismiss the necessity to address social problems. Despite this  critique, Gramsci draws lessons from Catholicism for the philosophy  of praxis. He notes, for example, that Church history demonstrates  two necessities: first, to utilize repetition—“the best didactic means for  working on the popular mentality”—since the masses are slow to alter  their beliefs (1971:340); second, to avoid the Church’s missteps by  maintaining a close relationship between intellectuals and the people  and promoting faith in one’s social group and in the philosophy of  praxis (1971:339).  These counterpoints help explain Gramsci’s depiction of folklore as  a force to be taken seriously, for he draws upon that mode of percep- tion and expression in order to devise a plan for escalating Marxism in  the face of fascistic and capitalistic hegemonic orders. The philosophy  of praxis must be experienced as faith—but as an organic faith that  promotes cross-class solidarity, evolves to define common sense, and  transforms common sense into good sense warranted by a new politi- cal hegemony. Accomplishment of this process fulfills the promise of  equality inherent in early Christianity, without the dire consequences  that stemmed from the Church’s alliances with power centers that  upheld rigid class and social hierarchies. In drawing this conclusion,  Gramsci comes to the question of education, as he considers the  Church and the school the preeminent organizers of culture. As mentioned earlier, Gramsci advocated the establishment of a  common school in vehement objection to Mussolini’s educational  policies. The Gentile Reform mandated compulsory religious instruc- tion, de-emphasized grammar and national language instruction,  and effected a dramatic increase in vocational schools.8 In each case,  Gramsci observed that the ruling class retained control by interrupting  opportunities for creating solidarity among the subaltern. Religious  instruction would essentially promote traditional, folkloric conceptions  of the world. Lack of instruction in a national language would imprison  people in dialects, thwarting participation in centers of power. Multi- plication of vocational schools would maintain vast distance between  ruling and working classes, reverting “to a division into juridically fixed  and crystallized estates rather than moving towards the transcendence  of class divisions” (1971:41). The philosophy of praxis would counter such educational trends.  As early as 1920, in his contributions to Avanti!, Gramsci portrayed the  </page> <page sequence="15"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 235 school as a “crucible where the new spirits will be forged” (1985:42).  His proposed common school would challenge provincialism by em- phasizing national language, science, and civics education. Informal  educational venues, such as newspapers and other public media, would  likewise contribute to the effort. Gramsci endorses a public media in- tended to “satisfy the needs of a certain mass of readers, a mass which  is intellectually most active, but only in the potential state, and which  it matters most to develop, to make it think concretely, to transform it  and homogenize it through a process of organic development that can  lead it from simple common sense to coherent and systemic thought”  (1985:413). In short, Gramsci sought a comprehensive education  policy that would replace folklore with science and civics, common  sense with good sense en route to philosophy, and a singular dialect  with a standardized language and multilingualism. This type of education would also promote the notion of self aware- ness as a historical construction. Following Marx, Gramsci professes  that a “basic innovation” of the philosophy of praxis is “demonstra- tion that there is no abstract ‘human nature,’ fixed and immutable (a  concept which certainly derives from religious and transcendentalist  thought), but that human nature is the totality of historically deter- mined social relations” (1971:133). He asserts that human differences  lie not in race or skin color, nor unity in the capacity for reason; unity  and difference arise from the social conditions through which one  fosters identity. Human personality is thus intertwined with folklore, language, and  common sense, especially in its initial formation. One’s personality  could be “strangely composite,” containing “Stone Age elements and  principles of a more advanced science” (1971:324), depending on  the group conditioning its constitution and establishing parameters  for ratified performances of self. Gramsci writes that active or passive  identity pertains to acceptance or rejection of  a conception of the world mechanically imposed by the external en- vironment, i.e. by one of the many social groups in which everyone is  automatically involved from the moment of his entry into the conscious  world (and this can be one’s village or province; it can have its origins  in the parish and the “intellectual activity” of the local priest or the ag- ing patriarch whose wisdom is law, or in the little old woman who has  inherited the lore of the witches or the minor intellectual soured by his  own stupidity and inability to act). (1971:323) </page> <page sequence="16"> 236 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 Critical thought is requisite to break from passivity. “The starting-point  of critical elaboration,” Gramsci declares, “is the consciousness of what  one really is, and is ‘knowing thyself’ as a product of the historical  process to date which has deposited in you an infinity of traces, with- out leaving an inventory” (1971:324). Self awareness, then, becomes  understanding of self as a site of confrontation between hegemonies.  Education, properly accomplished, promotes recognition of the his- torical and social construction of identity, encourages consistency of  thought and action, and nourishes discerning analysis of spontaneous  philosophies.  Gramsci ultimately rejects folklore and common sense (or at least  their reactionary elements) as parochialisms that impede maximum  critical praxis and solidarity, but he does not call for their immediate  eradication. Here he differs from orthodox Marxism’s conviction that  class consciousness would emerge rapidly following the unveiling of  false consciousness. Instead, Gramsci approaches education of the  masses as a slower process, one not bound to “theoretical enuncia- tion of ‘clear’ methodological principles,” but rather “articulated and  graduated,” built upon actual experience (1985:418). The implications  are far reaching. As José E. Limón explains this concern, “teachers are  primarily responsible for sensitively bringing a larger consciousness to  the masses” (1983:42). Abrupt revelations accomplish little; changes  in thought require adaptive repetitions and combinations.  What would happen, ponders Gramsci, if elementary schools taught  science only on the basis of relativity rather than basing instruction  on more traditional notions of nature? Students would learn nothing  and a rift would open between education and family life. Pedagogy  must therefore begin with what people already know, with the spon- taneous philosophies they acquire in primary social environments.  Education must function as a making of coherence over time, not an  immediate imposition. On several occasions Gramsci recognizes that  the philosophy of praxis, as a philosophy for the masses, must accept  common sense as its starting point. Accordingly, Gramsci grants that  the “spontaneous” masses should be educated, not despised. Gramsci therewith establishes a difference between merely “book- ish” scholarship and an education that matches theory with practice.  The task of intellectuals is to organize and diffuse moral and educa- tional reform, and to deliver people from common sense, to good  sense, to the philosophy of praxis. The creation of a new culture must  </page> <page sequence="17"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 237 articulate truth historically so that it is expressed in appropriate ways  and through appropriate language. To accomplish this, instructors  must “study and develop the elements of popular psychology, histori- cally and sociologically, actively (i.e. in order to transform them, by  educating them, into a modern mentality)” (1971:197). Not surpris- ingly, Gramsci encouraged teachers to study folklore.  This pedagogical agenda is important for locating Gramsci’s con- tribution to folklore studies. Gramsci did not designate certain people  as “folk” in an essentialist or permanent cast. Instead, he understood  folklore to be discursive practices that constitute folk identity. Even  though he intimated that most humans—or, minimally, most Italians  of his time—are born into provincial and subaltern strata, he held  that everyone may transcend initial enculturation. And quite unlike  many of his contemporaries, who justified rigid distinctions between  folk and intellectual, Gramsci sought a radical shared identification  between the two and promoted the emergence of new intellectuals  from the working class.9 For Gramsci, overcoming reliance upon folk- loric knowledge constitutes an early stage in the demolition of class  inequality; this is why he indicts his fellow folklorists’ admiration for  the object of their study as misplaced desire, complicit in a system of  oppression and hegemony that benefits the few.  On the Natural Inclination of Human Beings toward Folklore In the remainder of this essay, I would like to consider how a Grams- cian-inspired understanding of spontaneous philosophy and good  sense may assist a critical folklore studies. To do so will dissolve rather  arbitrary boundaries still remaining between folklore studies and  cultural studies, at least with respect to data and subject matter. In  analyzing the sway of the dominant class, Gramsci depicts the press  as the “most prominent and dynamic” way to garner and disseminate  consent, but not the only means to hegemonic control; to the contrary,  he believes that anything able to influence public opinion, from schools  to “the layout and names of streets” (1985:389), can help to create and  bolster a status quo. Folklore ranks among these influences, certainly,  and as such should be understood together with rather than distinct  from popular media.  Gramscian-inspired folklore studies would move beyond descrip- tion to more overtly political analyses, and then to interventions. They  </page> <page sequence="18"> 238 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 might focus, for example, on folkloric phenomena in competition with  other expressive forms; examine folklore’s negotiation between the  local and the State; analyze its educative or formative roles in identity  construction; determine its “location” at the center or periphery of  hegemonic struggle; follow its influences, both geographic and in- tellectual; engage its challenge to particular ideologies; or examine  counter-hegemonic and “subterranean tactics of resistance” (Abrahams  2005:139). Such research might also attempt a historical analysis of  fragmentation, although Gramsci warns there is “nothing vainer than  to try to find the different stratifications in a single area of folklore”  (1985:195).  Unique to a Gramscian approach—and to a critical folklore studies  based upon it—is the urgency of acclimating folklore and its correlates  for political action and social change. The longstanding division be- tween academic and public-sector folklorists becomes unimaginable  in this perspective, and the distinction between professional and  amateur becomes unthinkable; both become unified in promoting  progressive activism and fostering a new hegemony. As Gramsci’s own  political involvement demonstrates, activists of this sort might seek  employment not only in universities, art councils, state folklife pro- grams, and archives, but also at every level of government (especially  in departments and boards of education) and in grassroots and public  organizations such as unions and agencies that influence educational  policy and reform.  A Gramscian perspective begins with the recognition that one’s  conception of the world—the way one envisions and enacts mass  solidarity—is always contested: progressive or conservative, socialist  or neoliberal, anti-racist or racist, democratic or fascistic orientations  will always compete with each other as they strive to become centers  of irradiation. Furthermore, social change does not occur naturally  or by the goodwill of policymakers; a serious rhetorical investment is  required to create the conditions for change. Primary among these  is the forging of new collective identities, which for Gramsci necessi- tates an intimate proximity between intellectuals and the people they  represent, as well as incorporation of popular movements, attentive- ness to language as it influences consciousness, careful repetition and  articulation of novel ideas, and promotion of an international rather  than a parochial perspective.  </page> <page sequence="19"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 239 A critical folklore studies has much to contribute to such a program.  First, this kind of disciplinary orientation would stand with those who  argue that folklore scholarship is never neutral—and that when it  seems to be so, it is probably adhering to the status quo and upholding  current structures of domination. Second, it would demand, as Roger  Abrahams recently suggested, “insight into our role as commentators  on the process and the ways in which our discipline should expand  its subject” (2005:216). This could require the conceptualization of  certain social formations, such as racism or homophobia, as folkloric  in nature. Such critical scholarship might also need to venture into  exploring subjectivities much “larger” than the “small” groups to which  American folkloristics has become accustomed. Third, it would adopt  a model of scholarship that, in accepting its political nature and task,  openly seeks to promote certain conceptions of life and intervene  against others through the production of critique. A critical folklore  studies may readily complicate hegemonic paradigms, for example, by  demonstrating their injustice and advising contrarian perspectives or  categories. It might also name names, as it were, and advocate for or  against specific policies. It would certainly seek alliances to influence  public opinion.  Such political investment inspires the more speculative idea I  wish to entertain. From a Gramscian perspective, folklore never faces  extinction. It is fundamental to human experience, especially in the  primary constitution of subjectivity and communities. Arguments  that folklore is increasingly being replaced by popular—especially  mediated—culture mistake form for proclivity and misunderstand that  nascent philosophies, sciences (including media technologies), and  ideologies will inevitably produce new folklore. For Gramsci, we all  begin our lives in the context of spontaneous philosophy, and while  we may “sharpen” our human capacity for critical thought, we are also  driven by a desire to replicate those formative expressions. Hence this  section’s title, a play on Hans-Georg Gadamer’s essay “On the Natural  Inclination of Human Beings toward Philosophy” (1981).  Thorough examination of Gadamer’s contribution to folklore  studies must await future research. Here, I offer an invocation around  ideas resonant with Gramsci’s, such as common sense and the science/ philosophy distinction. Gadamer and Gramsci are rarely considered  together, and they differ on numerous matters, not the least of which  is Gadamer’s general praise for bourgeois culture and his avoidance  </page> <page sequence="20"> 240 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 of political pronouncements. These two scholars share, however, a  commitment to philosophy, to the conditions that lead to critical  practice and self knowledge. In addition, Gadamer (1900–2002) lived  to experience the horrors of the Second World War, the Cold War,  and the arms race. His comments on the relation between philosophy  and science complement Gramsci’s, and through their work I intend  to demonstrate folklore’s continued political importance in human  affairs.  Not surprisingly, Gramsci’s comments on science are complexly  woven. Although he acknowledges certain criteria necessary for criti- cal scientific consciousness, he repudiates positivism and reliance on  the natural sciences. Instead, Gramsci proposes that each field of re- search entails an appropriate method. In general, he defines science  as reproducible experimentation established on laws of regularity,  coordination, and causality, or the “most economic description of  reality” (1995:290). Science is predicated on demonstrable proof that  is contestable in ways common sense is not, as the latter maintains a  certainty granted by its association with religion or metaphysics. For  Gramsci, science has two aims: to correct ways of knowing, and to  elevate “objectivity” by classifying phenomena as either arbitrary/ individualistic or essential/common. That said, science as practiced by humans is free from neither sub- jectivity nor ideology; rather, it is “the union of objective fact with a  hypothesis or system of hypotheses that go beyond the mere objective  fact” (1995:293) and so competes with other authoritative formations,  including religion. This is so because science (like spontaneous phi- losophy) is also historical human action. It is “bound to needs, to life,  to the activity of humanity” and its ultimate interest is not neutral laws  of the universe but cultural influence (1995:292). Given this human  component, science itself may become superstitious when popularized  or come to substitute for the very “witchcraft” it defies, as when humans  treat technology as a new messiah. The only antidote for such misuse,  Gramsci proffers, is the sober explanation of science—that is, educa- tion that restores coherence and prevents science from collapsing into  folklore or becoming known and practiced by a select few.  Gadamer likewise conceptualizes philosophy and science as activi- ties distinct from folklore, although he refers to legend or myth rather  than directly employing the term folklore. His (brazenly Western-cen- tered) claim that the first enlightenment occurred in ancient Greece,  </page> <page sequence="21"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 241 for instance, suggests that this advance took place “when the view of life  enshrined in the epics and myths of Homer and Hesiod was dissolved  by the new passion for discovery” (1998:71). But although Gadamer  alleges a dialectical relationship between philosophy and science, he  demonstrates acute distress that in his day interest in science has fallen  prey to an obsession with technology, resulting in philosophy’s exile.  In Gadamer’s historical reconstruction, science and philosophy  were unified in ancient Greece. The advent of modernity in the sev- enteenth century, wrought by the new science of Galilean mechanics,  subordinated philosophy to science. This bifurcation continued, he  suggests, throughout the eighteenth century. Increased association of  science with technology led to the encroachment of automatism and  the eventual misuse of scientific mastery over nature. In the twentieth  century, the exponential increase of information combined with vast  opportunities for technological control of public opinion resulted in  a crisis of alienation as people became incapable of establishing stable  identities. The irony is that although applied science was expected  to banish “all unpredictability from life,” such “radicalized faith”  both discouraged human responsibility and demoted philosophical  enterprise around convention, tradition, and practical judgment  (1981:147–48).  Science, in its modern sense, is “no longer the quintessence of  knowledge and of what is worth knowing, but a way,” a body of knowl- edge regulated through experimentation and culminating in techno- logical application (1981:69). In Gadamer’s view, the empirical sciences  have come to emphasize method, induction, and what he calls “me- thodical knowability,” all of which are means to determine certitude;  in consequence, the sciences renounced comprehensive knowledge.  Gadamer thus identified the corruption of science that Gramsci had  only implied when he cautioned against its improper popularization. At  issue is whether human solidarity and practical reason can be restored  and revived in a technological civilization so distant from philosophy  and its fundamental questions about humanity.  For Gadamer, philosophy—that which possesses no positive datum  and cannot be investigated empirically—solicits the whole and searches  for unity, distinguishing it from the technical aims of science. “The un- derstanding of our life world as deposited in our language,” he claims,  “cannot be fully resolved by means of the possibilities of knowledge  available to science” (1981:12). “Understanding” is, of course, a term  </page> <page sequence="22"> 242 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 central for Gadamer. It does not denote Marxist class consciousness,  but points to a broader sense of interpretation—hermeneutics—and  self understanding, including one’s relation to others. Understanding  begins not in the search for certainty, but in queries such as “Why is  there anything at all and not nothing?” and “How should we under- stand that this self-illuminating luminosity that we call consciousness  will eventually come to an end?” (1981:145).   Gadamer regards the restoration of equilibrium, a reintegration  of science and philosophy, as the central challenge facing humanity.  To be clear, Gadamer’s treatment of fragmentation differs substan- tially from Gramsci’s; he intends for human solidarity to be realized,  not for subaltern class solidarity to overthrow fascism and bourgeois  ideology. For Gadamer, the “intense urgency” of “bringing a people  to self-understanding of themselves” is not directed toward political  revolution, and he dismisses outright the possibility that self estrange- ment is caused “by the peculiarities of the capitalist economic order  alone” (1981:149).  Yet despite this intractable political difference, there is reason  to bring Gadamer and Gramsci into conversation on the subject of  philosophy. For Gadamer, philosophy is in exile but it is not dead.  The desire to know—that which Plato nominated as the origins of  philosophy—is a natural inclination. In a style roughly comparable  to Gramsci, Gadamer affirms: [T]here are no people who do not “think” sometime and somewhere.  That means there is no one who does not form general views about life  and death, about freedom and human living together, about the good  and about happiness. (1981:58) All humans possess the potential for philosophical thought because  all humans desire knowledge. Gadamer cites Aristotle on this point,  but additionally mentions as evidence the curiosity of children, as  well as “man’s slow progress of settling into this organized world that  surrounds him, his participation in the linguistic communication  of all with all” that leads “down the path of Bildung (cultivation)”  (1998:67–68). Bildung is one of the four guiding concepts of human- ism identified by Gadamer in Truth and Method (1989). Common sense,  judgment, and taste are its correlates.  Length prohibits detailed analysis of Gadamer’s history of com- mon sense (cf. Schaeffer 1990). However, the necessary conditions he  </page> <page sequence="23"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 243 admits are responsive to Gramsci. According to Gadamer, common  sense turns on the probable and is crucial for founding communities  and rendering judgments about right and wrong vis-à-vis the common  good. It relates, Gadamer continues, to the ancient concept of phrone- sis—practical and moral knowledge that governs action. Phronesis itself  is directed toward concrete situations, focused on means and ends,  tied to self understanding, and inclined to guide practice by means  of reason instead of animalistic instinct. “Not mere indoctrination or  accession to custom” (1998:58), phronesis is nevertheless communal  and rhetorical, as one demonstrating it “is aware of the normative  viewpoints he follows and knows how to make them effective in the  concrete decision demanded by the practical situation” (1981:48).10  Gadamerian phronesis corresponds, I contend, to Gramscian good  sense. Furthermore, the two perspectives adjudicate an equilibrium.  Gramsci’s good sense is decidedly political, correcting Gadamer’s more  neutral representation of phronesis, which in antiquity was conceptual- ized as a robustly political rather than strictly philosophical resource.  For his part, Gadamer’s phronesis demonstrates beneficial employment  of common sense (as well as religion) and tempers Gramsci’s negativ- ism. Together they suggest that folklore, philosophy, and science are  natural to the human condition. If this is so, the answer to Gadamer’s  following inquiry is certainly “no”:  Should the questions to which science does not know the answer be  shunted aside even though they still concern the human mind and have  called forth the grand answers of the religions, the mythologies, the ar- tistic creation like the tragedies, and intellectual works like the Platonic  dialogues? (1981:149) To ignore questions unanswerable by science contradicts the human  condition. Thus folklore’s significance, whether as a model for political  action or as a resource for answering grand questions about humanity. How, then, to conceptualize this relationship intellectually and  politically? Lurking in the writing of both Gramsci and Gadamer is an  arborescent rather than rhizomatic metaphor (to borrow from Deleuze  and Guattari 1987) for describing the relationship between folklore,  philosophy, and science. In Gramsci, for example, one climbs from  folklore to the summit of philosophy (despite his critique of Catholi- cism, Gramsci employs remarkably Catholic imagery in his depiction  of knowledge as ascension—perhaps this is telling of how deep in the  </page> <page sequence="24"> 244 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 bone hegemonies breed). Yet there are other ways to configure the  relations among modes of perceiving and acting in the world. The  following offers a rhizomatic model:  Folklore Magic Religion Common Sense Science Philosophy Logic I must offer some preliminary remarks upon the utility of this  model. First and foremost, it intends no replication of the magic- religion-science paradigm that occupied early anthropologists and  social theorists. Classificatory schema can be dishonest and colonialist,  and I wish to avoid that sordid legacy. Here, the aim is more modest:  to do justice to the Gramscian arboreal conception (which is also de- cidedly Western in its orientation) while at the same time reframing  it for contemporary critical action. This model attempts to preserve  the distinctions Gramsci and Gadamer draw between different bodies  of knowledge while also advocating their interdependence. It submits  that these categories of knowing bear closer intellectual and political  relation than Gramsci’s work presumes, and that we might profitably  imagine them a trias politica, each indispensable for balancing the  other in non-fascist society.  </page> <page sequence="25"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 245 Accordingly, this model seeks to demonstrate the possibility of si- multaneous tensions and alliances among these bodies of knowledge  that may push against the anti-democratic tribalism characteristic of  a contemporary world dominated by technocrats and religious fanat- ics. This model is not meant to confirm unconditional or universal  categorical distinctions that have been established a priori. It instead  recognizes that such definitions are themselves acts of power. If any  recommendation harbors here, it is that impositions of distinction  among practices in a given locality are worth attending to. Such dis- tinctions—which signal a community’s ratified forms of thought and  action—are important political issues, especially in the context of  Gramscian-inspired research.  Critical awareness requires more than accepting that particular  groups may recognize no difference between science and magic, while  others may strive over their boundaries, while still others may privilege  one mode and outlaw the other. Critical awareness is also more than  the appreciation that one group’s religion may be another group’s  magic. At issue is who determines the boundaries and hierarchies of  science, philosophy, and folklore, and how those parties police and  discipline the distinctions. Moreover, this model of critical awareness  recognizes that politics, in the simplest terms, is a struggle to define and  control common sense as the intermediary between all other modes of  practice. Such a perspective certainly honors Gramsci’s contribution  while moving it into contemporary political arenas. Finally, this model attempts to recalibrate Gramsci’s notion of good  sense. Instead of conceptualizing it as an improved common sense, I  propose that good sense be understood more holistically as phronesis:  a management of these bodies of knowledge in situated performance,  attentive to particular social circumstances and political judgments.  This is why “good sense” does not appear in the figure above; I con- ceptualize it instead as a navigational guide among the categories (cf.  Gadamer 1981:91 on prohairesis). In this way, the exercise of good sense  is always historically situated and forefronts ethics and politics as the  address—or redress—of others. Such judgment is rendered in context;  it is not a method or technique. As such, it is an inventive practice,  bound to the conditions that the ancient Greeks called kairos (timeli- ness), dunamis (possibility), and to prepon (appropriateness) as defined  by the local community and its relation to a cultural hegemony, even  as one seeks to alter that hegemony.  </page> <page sequence="26"> 246 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 Practically speaking, good sense necessitates judgment about which  body of knowledge to employ in a given situation. Sometimes folklore  would be a paramount factor, and sometimes philosophy or science.  Scientific description of decomposition might not be comforting at a  funeral, just as a belief narrative might be inappropriate when one is  in desperate need of comprehending gravity. Prayer might constitute  good sense under certain conditions, and chemotherapy under oth- ers. (And sometimes neither would be useful, and sometimes both.)  The point is that folklore remains a viable resource for judgment and  action rather than something to be discarded altogether. By advocat- ing this position, a critical folklore studies enters ongoing debates  about political judgment, the status of prudence in the postmodern  world, and the “recovery and appropriation of the type of practical  reasoning, knowledge, and wisdom that is characteristic of phronesis”  (McGee 1998:19).  In the proposed schemata, consistent identification with one  category against all others violates good sense personally—for to be  human is to experience the range of human activities—and politically,  as human relations must be worked out in specific cases, even when  shared commitment to the meaning of certain values exists. Against  ideologies that permit little interaction between categories or that as- sign human bodies to one alone, this model calls attention to the bal- ance of power and practical judgment as core principles of democratic  culture. Perhaps a vibrantly radicalized democracy would advance  an educative matrix that maximizes opportunities for all humans to  engage folklore, philosophy, and science together, debating which  reflects good sense in situated performance and which combination  of perspectives should be employed in order to instantiate new col- lective political identities.  From this vantage point, a critical folklore studies would take sides,  sometimes for and sometimes against folklore, depending on context  and relation to equitable social formations. Intelligent design, for ex- ample, offers several opportunities as a topic for conventional studies  of folk belief. Yet its recent infiltration into public school systems—the  decision of Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District heralding folklore over  science—demonstrates the urgent need for a critical folklore studies,  one observant of Gramsci’s admonition against parochialisms that  would disprivilege certain citizens. In a similar vein, cognitive science  often demonstrates the limitations of folk psychology, medicinal bio- </page> <page sequence="27"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 247 chemistry tests the efficacy of homeopathy, and evolutionary biology  questions the strength of creationism. But it does not follow that all  religious expressions or superstitions are undemocratic or socially  dangerous, as has been argued recently by a range of cultural com- mentators, including Christopher Hitchens in God Is Not Great (2007),  Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion (2008), and Bill Maher in his  comedic documentary Religulous (2008).  In opposition to these public demands for a world cleansed of  religion, a critical folklore studies could raise the question of whether  the scientized, rationalized world they envision is one that respects  democratic alterity—or even one worth living in at all. This question  would be an adaptation of Gramsci’s critique of elite intellectualism— and one that would reject his own Marxist atheism in favor of solidarity  with religious people who share a commitment to radical democratic  values. Similarly, as Gramsci understood, capitalist ideology does not  dismiss all religion. In the contemporary world, its cultural hegemony  readily promotes prosperity theology or traditionalist defenses of  the free market (Woods 2005), even as it demotes progressive social  gospel movements and liberation theology. Its radical corrective may  lie, then, in alliances between critical atheists and the latter religious  traditions, through which new subjectivities may arise to shape public  opinion and policy.  Again, the aim is not to extol folklore unconditionally. Specific  cases may require its replacement to achieve equality or other com- mitments to social change. But by promoting education attentive to  good sense and focused on the political uses of folklore, folklorists and  the communities they work with may develop avenues for action rel- evant to the propagation of a more democratic and equitable cultural  hegemony. This schemata—as something to think with, not conform  to—accommodates Gramsci’s stance while maintaining a consequential  political role for folklore; further, it responds to his own suggestion that  “the spirit of folklore studies should be changed, as well as deepened  and extended” (1985:191). As he himself concludes: Only in this way will the teaching of folklore be more efficient and really  bring about the birth of a new culture among the broad popular masses,  so that the separation between modern culture and popular culture and  folklore will disappear. An activity of this kind, thoroughly carried out,  would correspond on the intellectual plane to what the Reformation was  in Protestant countries. (1985:191) </page> <page sequence="28"> 248 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 47, No. 3 Folklore studies, especially when promoted as critical and political  activity, are integral to birthing a new culture. To follow this pursuit,  folklorists should wrestle with instead of neglecting the insights  Gramsci offered so many decades ago. University of Massachusetts Amherst Notes 1. A notable earlier exception is a collection of essays dedicated to Folklore Studies  in Italy in this journal, 11/1–2 (1974).  2. When I refer to a Gramscian-inspired “new hegemony,” I specifically mean a  progressive, radical, social democratic order in opposition to an ascendant neolib- eral, neoconservative, late capitalist hegemony (cf. Laclau and Mouffe 1985). Such a  position is predicated on economic justice and resistance to racism, sexism, classism,  homophobia, xenophobia, and other pernicious social formations of inequity. 3. See Alberto Cirese’s effort to resolve the “tension and conflicts that border on  the edge of ambiguity” in Gramsci’s definition (1982:224). 4. Gramsci contends that even with radical changes, some strata “are still immersed  in the culture of preceding historical situations, including sometimes the one that  has most recently been superseded” (1971:453); cf. folklore as the “reflection of  the conditions of cultural life of the people, although certain conceptions specific  to folklore remain even after these conditions have been (or seem to be) modified  or have given way to bizarre combinations” (1985:190). This is akin to notions of  “survivals” introduced by earlier anthropologists such as Edward Tylor. 5. It should be noted, however, that Gramsci did not think the fascist regime  so opposed to folklore; to the contrary, he thought that Mussolini’s government  promoted folklore in order to forge a fascist nationalist identity and to keep large  segments of the population ill-informed. For further information, see Cavazza 1987,  Gunzberg 1983, and Simeone 1978.  6. Scholars have been reticent to attend to Gramsci’s views on language. Franco  Lo Piparo (1979) published the first major study; cf. Peter Ives (2004), who coins  the term “vernacular materialism” to describe Gramsci’s approach.  7. Cf. Diana Coben (2002), to whom I am indebted for inspiration to represent  Gramsci’s ideas visually. For other discussions of Gramscian good sense, see Coben’s  bibliography.  8. See Livia Giacardi (2006) on the Gentile Reform’s reorganization of the system  of student progress originating in the Casati Act of 1859.  9. Due to space limitations, I cannot fully explain here Gramsci’s distinction  between traditional and organic intellectuals. Briefly, traditional intellectuals are  those set apart as an elite profession, usually through overt alliance with the domi- nant political class. Organic intellectuals are those who emerge from working class  and everyday circumstances, whose intellectual labor benefits their class, and who  are positioned to help organize peripheral groups in solidarity to advance a new  hegemonic order.  </page> <page sequence="29"> Stephen Olbrys Gencarella Gramsci, Good Sense, and Critical Folklore Studies 249 10. For Gadamer, such “concrete practical discernment” maintains a “reciprocal”  relationship with the “universal desire to know” (1981:112). Gadamer specifically  means practical philosophy here, and he cautions against confusing practical philoso- phy with one of its virtues, such as phronesis (117). Yet the linkage is a salient point  of comparison with Gramsci, as elsewhere Gadamer insists: “Practical philosophy  presupposes that we are already shaped by the normative images or ideas in the light  of which we have been brought up and that lie at the basis of the order of our entire  social life. That does not at all suggest that these normative perspectives remain fixed  immutably and would be beyond criticism. Social life consists of a constant process  of transformation of what previously has been held valid” (135). References Cited Abrahams, Roger 2005 Everyday Life: A Poetics of Vernacular Practices.
