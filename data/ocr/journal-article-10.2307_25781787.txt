<plain_text><page sequence="1">BECKETT AND ROMANTICISM IN THE 1930s Mark Nixon This essay surveys Beckett's response to Romantic literature and painting in the 1930s. It examines the way he dismissed its sentimentality and elaborate style but was attracted to a particular strand of Romanticism that portrayed a melancholic sensibility. In a letter of 29 January 1935 to Thomas MacGreevy, Beckett announced that he had written a "new short story," and had sent it to the publisher Lovat Dickinson (letter to MacGreevy [hereafter TM], 29 January 1935). The story, "Lightning Calculation," which ultimately became a part of Murphy, was the first piece of creative writing Beckett had done since A Case in a Thousand, completed in May 1934. Indeed, 1934 was a year in which his thinking revolved around the aesthetic implications of writing rather than the practical process of composition. Beckett published several critical pieces and reviews during this year, and also read extensively, as several notebooks (especially those on philosophy, psychology and the history of German Literature) now at Trinity College show. Beckett's theoretical preoccupations of the time are reflected in "Lightning Calculation," which in many ways reads like an aesthetic statement. It is for example the first text to draw on the visual arts in more than just a referential way. Indeed, the story must have been begun shortly after what was undoubtedly Beckett's most profound engagement with the visual arts in general, and the painter Cezanne in particular, up until that time. Beckett had already alluded to Cezanne in Dream of Fair to Middling Women as being "very strong on architectonics," although his knowledge of Cezanne's work at this time appears to have been rather negligible (178). Two remarkable letters written to MacGreevy in September 1934, however, reveal a far more searching encounter with Cezanne's work, which had a critical impact on Beckett's developing poetics. Discussing the painting Montagne Sainte-Victoire (1905-06) in London's Tate Gallery, Beckett argued that whereas the "anthropomorphized" reality as portrayed by Dutch</page><page sequence="2">Mark Nixon painting had become insufficient, "Cezanne seems to have been the first to see landscape &amp; state it as material of a strictly peculiar order, incommensurable with all human expressions whatsoever" (TM, 8 September 1934). Beckett's criticism of anthropomorphism in the Cezanne letters is rooted in its "itch to animise," the investment of landscape with human qualities: "What I feel in Cezanne is precisely the absence of a rapport that was all right for Rosa and Ruysdael for whom the animising mode was valid" (TM, 8 September 1934). Beckett's terms of reference here invoke the trajectory from a romantic, or rather pre-romantic to a 'modern' view of the world. Both Salvator Rosa (1615-73) and Jacob van Ruysdael (c. 1628-82) are considered proto-Romantics in that their late paintings reveal a romantic sensibility in the use of mood, motifs and perspective, and Ruysdael in particular inspired many Romantic landscapists. That Beckett viewed Cezanne as the painter who overcame Romantic painting is evident from a letter written in 1937, in which he stated that Constable's "nature is really infected with 'spirit,' ultimately as humanised + romantic as Turner's was + Claude's was not + Cezanne's was not" (TM, 14 August 1937). The debate between a romantic and a modern approach to landscape (and the problematic object-subject relationship) lies at the heart of various critical pronouncements made by Beckett during 1934. It thus appears in his attack in "Recent Irish Poetry" on the "Victorian Gael," where Sir Samuel Ferguson and Standish O'Grady are dismissed as an "Irish Romantic Arnim-Brentano combination," with a reference to Des Knaben Wunderhorn (1806-08) compounding the "Ossianic" mixture (Beckett 1983, 70 and 77). The condemnation of the "cut-and dried sanctity and loveliness" of the Irish "antiquarians" is located in their refusal to admit 'self-perception' as a theme, in that their writing merely strives to "land the practitioner into the correct scenery, where the self is either most happily obliterated or else so improved and enlarged that it can be mistaken for part of the decor" (71).1 This essentially rephrases Beckett's belief that in Romantic writing, as well as painting, "the landscape shelters or threatens or serves or destroys" (TM, 14 August 1937). Beckett's concern with the relationship between self and other, the individual and landscape, forms a central focus of "Lightning Calculation" (RUL MS 2902). The short typescript describes the movements of one Quigley, who is writing a book entitled The Pathetic Fallacy from Avercamp to Campendonck. Quigley's undertaking is not 62</page><page sequence="3">Beckett and Romanticism in the 1930s without its problems, as he is both troubled by the fact that he cannot remember the "name of Hobbema's celebrated avenue" and because the "golden Cuyp sky which he now evoked, in order to make sure that it contained the flight of birds so important to his thesis, did not present itself with sufficient detail to set his mind at ease."2 Quigley only manages to find some kind of resolution to these problems when he stops off at the Lyons teahouse on the way to the National Gallery. In a scene that reappears in Murphy, Quigley devotes considerable energy to calculating the various ways in which he can eat his five assorted biscuits. As a consequence, "Quigley began to be engrossed by the biscuits, and therefore no longer troubled by Hobbema and his avenue and Cuyp and his birds." The entire episode can be seen as a fictional manifestation of Beckett's aesthetic concerns as imparted to MacGreevy in the September 1934 letters. Ultimately, in the eating of the biscuits, Quigley is favouring mathematics, or Cezanne's "architectonics," over Dutch "landscapability," which reflects Beckett's own dismissal of "Cuyp's cows as irrelevant" in a letter to MacGreevy (TM, 8 September 1934). Nevertheless, as John Pilling rightly argues, Murphy is not a book "strong on architectonics" (1997, 133). In part this is because, in "Lightning Calculation," Quigley finds it difficult to write his book "without reneging on his infatuation with the work of Hercules Seg[h]ers." Although not a formalistic artist either, the Dutch artist Seghers is equally not an "animising" painter. Indeed, as Beckett noted in February 1937 when he inspected two coloured engravings in the Print Room of the Zwinger Gallery in Dresden, Seghers was a "[v]ery modern talent" ("German Diaries" [hereafter GD], 9 February 1937).3 Hercules Seghers (1580/907-1633/8?) was an innovative and experimental artist, few of whose paintings survive today. Seghers, by all accounts a drunken, destitute and unappreciated artist, represents the very kind of unhappy creative spirit to whom Beckett tended to be attracted. Influenced by one of Beckett's favourite painters, Adam Elsheimer, Seghers's work often depicts wild and fantastic mountainous scenes, with jagged cliffs and desolate valleys invoking at once an emotional intensity as well as a haunting, melancholy quiet. Seghers's etchings, which Beckett admired in Dresden, are particularly ahead of their time, as he experimented with different coloured inks and often printed on dyed or coloured paper. A further diary entry on Seghers clarifies Beckett's perception of Seghers's modernity: "Two Hercules Seghers [...] both flat landscapes with view of Rhenen, one 63</page><page sequence="4">Mark Nixon formerly given to Van Goyen, but the tone is already much more piercing, + less stylised than V.G.'s" (GD, 2 January 1937). Importantly, in September 1934 Beckett had defined Van Goyen as one of the painters who "anthropomorphized landscape" (TM, 8 September 1934). Dismissive of the sentimental expression of anthropomorphism, yet unable to achieve the cold "architectonics" of Cezanne, Beckett ultimately sought a middle ground that the innovative yet emotionally intense Seghers could supply. The key to Seghers's modern approach, according to Beckett, lies in the fact that he is both less 'stylised' and less 'sentimental' than his contemporaries. The two terms act as yardsticks in Beckett's evaluation of literature and painting in the 1930s, and fundamentally determine his like or dislike of artists. Already in his lecture on Gide at Trinity College he had condemned the Naturalists and Romantics as being "artificial" and lacking "authentic complexity" (Rachel Burrows lecture notes, TCD MIC 60, 3 and 5). Beckett thus favoured the "integrity of incoherence" in both Gide and Stendhal over the "patient fabricated order or Rom[antics] and Natsts. [Naturalists]" (37 and 9). Following Gide, Beckett thought that the Romantics evaded the complexity of reality by adopting the "demon d'analogie" (39), a notion he rephrased in his 1934 review "Schwabenstreich" as "the theory of Correspondences, that trusty standby of all the Romantics from Hoffmann to Proust" (1983, 62). The point is also made in "Fingal," where Belacqua feels he "must be getting old and tired [...] when I find the nature outside me compensating for the nature inside me, like Jean Jacques [Rousseau] sprawling in a bed of saxifrages" (1973, 31). Beckett's attitude towards Romanticism in the 1930s was not one of simple dismissal. To be sure, a sweeping glance through Beckett's writing of the 1930s would appear to confirm that he did not think much of Romantic writers and artists. In accordance with what Dream calls the "tag and the ready-made" (47), the names of poets and fragments of their work are liberally scattered throughout the early prose and poetry, and more often than not take the form of humorous misquotation. One among numerous examples of this is Beckett's use of Wordsworth's "Immortality Ode" in both Dream and Murphy, the latter text including the revision of the Romantic poet's line "Heaven lies about us in our infancy" to "Since Heaven lay around you as a bedwetter" (1993, 122).4 On the whole the Romantic poets are condemned for their stylised, affected writing and, in particular, their sentimentality. In all of Beckett's early work the word 'sentimental' is 64</page><page sequence="5">Beckett and Romanticism in the 1930s used as an index of something to be negated, as in the passage in Dream where the Smerry leaves for Hamburg, and Belacqua is left mourning her departure: "certain aspects of her abode in his heart [...] made themselves felt from time to time in the form of a sentimental eructation that was far from being agreeable" (109). The subsequent reference to Belacqua's "infrequent jolt of sentimental heartburn" (109) highlights Beckett's general distaste for the word 'heart,' which resurfaces again and again in connection with exaggerated sentimentality, usually in connection with Romantic writers. Thus in a May 1931 letter to MacGreevy he draws attention to "a few shocking lines here and there" (TM, 29 May 1931) in Goethe, quoting from Die Leiden des Jungen Werther. "Was ich weiss kann jeder wissen, / mein Herz hab' ich allein. !! (What I know everybody can know, / my heart is mine alone.)" (Beckett's emphasis; my translation). Dismissing this excessively sentimental strand of German Romanticism, Beckett would again mock the "blabby word" Herz by incorporating a line from Gretchen's song at the spinning-wheel from Goethe's Faust in Dream: "Mein Ruh ist hin mein Herz ist schwer ich finde Sie nimmer und nimmer mehr" (My peace is fled, / My heart is sore; / I shall find it never, / Ah! nevermore) (59).5 The wealth of allusions to and fragments from Romantic writers in the early work is taken, as so often with Beckett, from secondary rather than primary sources. Thus Beckett for example read Theophile Gautier's Histoire du romantisme, from which he took three notes in his Dream Notebook (items 1000-02). He also took extensive notes on German Romantic thinkers from Wilhelm Windelband's A History of Philosophy (TCD MS 10967), on German Romantic writers and their texts from J.G. Robertson's History of German Literature in Spring 1934 (TCD MS 10971/1), and, to a lesser degree, on their English counterparts from the revised 1933 edition of Emile Legouis and Louis Cazamian's A History of English Literature (TCD MS 10970). From these books Beckett largely copied out biographical and bibliographical details, but he did at times take more extended notes, such as the excerpt from a footnote in Cazamian's discussion of the Romantic Period: All that Romantic writers imagine and feel is accompanied by a shade of wonder, because they see those emotions and those images rise within themselves with a surprising spontaneousness, and because all such imaginings, in spite of their novelty, bring 65</page><page sequence="6">Mark Nixon with them a disturbing impression of an intimacy of old date. Romanticism is as a whole, in this respect, a phenomenon of collective 'paramnesia', the reviviscence of a subconscious personality. (TCD MS 10970, 38r; Legouis and Cazamian, 1030, n.l) The two strands of Cazamian's discussion noted here - spontaneous imagination and the importance of memory - are drawn from Wordsworth's Lyrical Ballads, and are restated (as Philip Laubach Kiani has pointed out) by Beckett in his essay Proust. Beckett thus locates Proust's "romantic strain" in his "substitution of affectivity for intelligence" and "the importance of memory in inspiration" (80 and 82). Moreover, Wordsworth's statement that "[p]oetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" in the Preface to the Lyrical Ballads is echoed by Beckett's belief that - in terms of his own poetic output - only those poems stemming from a "spontaneous combustion of the spirit" were worth anything (TM, 18 October [1932]). Curiously, Beckett re-enacted a Romantic compositional experience during his visit to Germany in 1936/37. Whilst visiting the Ohlsdorf graveyard on the outskirts of Hamburg, Beckett appears to have been simultaneously receptive to spontaneous inspiration as well as to the specific creative stimulus injected by memory. Walking through the cemetery, "alive with graves," Beckett "thought a poem would be there": "the noise of my steps in the leaves reminds me of something, but can't find what" (GD, 25 October 1936). Yet the Romantic "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" was not forthcoming: "I feel nothing." Beckett's diary entry, however, captures the mood of the cemetery: Strange banners on the newly earthed. One bedraggled crape fillet all on its own. Yellow leaves + red berries. Young poplars of incredible delicacy, almost bare of leaves, sheathed in their branches. Dull golden larches + glaucus pines. Heather on graves (but in bunches), roses [...] One Liebespaar [loving couple]. Fish in pond being fed. Swans. A [erasure] small old man sidles determinedly into a nook, [erasure] behind a yew hedge, facing a piece d'eau, [erasure] with the air of a regular weekend mourner, a Leidtragender Trostsuchend [erasure] und findender [sufferer/bereaved seeking and finding consolation]. 66</page><page sequence="7">Beckett and Romanticism in the 1930s The large number of erasures show Beckett's earnest attempt to describe the cemetery, perhaps hoping that he would be able to write a poem at a later point, drawing as it were on Wordsworth's "emotions recollected in tranquility." Yet if Beckett admitted a romantic sensibility into his private diary ("How I ADORE solitude"; GD, 31 December 1936), in his texts such descriptive material is usually filtered through a rather mocking attitude. Thus for example Beckett extensively parodies a Romantic style of writing in the unpublished short story "Echo's Bones," in which the narrative frequently traces an embellished, adorned discourse. On being asked what he sees from Lord Gall's tree-house, Belacqua says "Timberlike trees in great profusion [...] brushwood in abundance and diadems of lakes" (15). Despite being told to "Cut out the style" by Gall, Romantic passages continue to appear in the story, as in the description of "a cataclasm of boughs and a moonlit pandemonium of autumn tints" (18). This exuberant style reaches its apotheosis when towards the end of the story, Belacqua is sitting (like a Graveyard Poet?) on his tomb stone: What with the moon shining, the sea tossing in her sleep and sighing, and the mountains observing their Attic vigil in the background, he found it difficult to decide offhand whether the scene was of the kind that is called romantic or whether it should not with more justice be termed classical. Both elements were present, of that there could be no question. Perhaps classico romantic would be the fairest diagnosis. A classico-romantic scene. Personally, he felt calm and wistful. A classico-romantic corpse. (19) Leaving aside the use of stereotypical Romantic (and Greek) metaphors and analogies, the terms of this passage are taken from Mario Praz's La Came, La Morte e II Diabolo (The Romantic Agony), notes from which Beckett took in the Dream Notebook. As the title of the book indicates, The Romantic Agony is essentially a study of decadence, and thus concentrates on the darker strands of Romanticism - the satanic hero, deathly beauty, the beauty of death, decadent sexuality - all the while hovering between the ecstatic (Blake) and the depraved (de Sade). As he did with Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, Beckett mainly used the 67</page><page sequence="8">Mark Nixon book to furnish Dream and texts written shortly thereafter with literary and biographical curiosities. Yet Beckett was also aware of the larger movement behind Praz's study, and used terms and ideas from the introductory chapter to flesh out his parody of Romantic writing. Thus Belacqua's indecision over the precise nature of the evening mood - classical or romantic - draws on Praz's statement (not copied into the Dream notebook) on the opening page of his study that "L'epiteto romantico e l'antitesi classico-romantico sono approssimazioni da lungo tempo entrate nell'uso" (The epithet 'romantic' and the antithetical terms 'classic' and 'romantic' are approximate labels which have long been in use (Praz 1930, 1; Praz 1951, 1)). And the word "wistful" is used by Praz as an example - together with the German "Sehnsucht" - as an expression of a Romantic "state of mind which cannot be described" (Praz 1951, 14). Perhaps more importantly, Praz's book illuminated what Beckett in his essay on Proust called the "gangrene of Romanticism" (80).6 Somewhat misleadingly, Beckett implies that the phrase derives from J.-K. Huysmans's A rebours, but whereas this book does talk about the "decomposition of the French language," and the way it goes "a little greener every century" (200), it is in En menage that Huysmans refers to the fact that "nous n'etions pas gangrenes par le romantisme." The degeneration of the lofty ideals and aspirations of the Romantics clearly appealed to Beckett, whose early landscapes are literally infused with 'gangrene.' Thus the colours yellow and green are frequently employed to signpost a process of decomposition, as in the poem "Enueg I" with its image of the "blotches of doomed yellow in the pit of the Liffey" and the "slush of vigilant gulls in the grey spew of sewer" (1977, 12). In Murphy romanticised moments are undercut with that same sense of the organic, the "wild evening" is "green and yellow seen in a puddle" (128). Similarly, as Murphy awakens in the park after night had fallen, surrounded by "less Wordsworthy" sheep, he "bared his eyes to the moon, he forced back the lids with his fingers, the yellow oozed under them into his skull, a belch came wet and foul from the green old days" (62). Yet if Beckett turned away from the Romantics' use of landscape and nature - as Malone says, "but to hell with all this fucking scenery" (1994, 279) - he was not against the Romantic sensibility. Throughout the 1930s, Beckett's cultural awareness was shaped by his attraction to the melancholy strain inherent in Romanticism, or those qualities encapsulated by the German word Schwermut. Thus it was clearly not 68</page><page sequence="9">Beckett and Romanticism in the 1930s the Romantic hero that interested Beckett, but the solitary turning his back on the world, or being shorn by the world. As I have shown elsewhere, Beckett was in particular attracted to a melancholy strand of German Romanticism, the co-ordinates of which he traced from Schopenhauer, Schubert, Goethe (tellingly, as a poet, not as a playwright), Grillparzer, Heine to Holderlin and Georg Trakl.7 Beckett had of course already expressed sentiments that set him alongside this tradition in Proust here "art is the apotheosis of solitude" (64), and suffering "the main condition of the artistic experience" (28). Indeed, the entire essay is founded upon a matrix of pessimism filtered through Schopenhauer. Beckett was highly conscious of where he was taking his reading of Proust. Even before he had started writing the essay (late August 1930), an entry dated 15 July 1930 in George Reavey's diary, presumably made after the two friends had met, illustrates this: "Sam. Beckett - Proust + Pessimism."8 It was at around this time that Beckett first read Schopenhauer: An intellectual justification of unhappiness - the greatest that has ever been attempted - is worth the examination of one who is interested in Leopardi and Proust rather than in Carducci and Barres. (TM, undated [25? July 1930]) Attentive to "the darkest passages in Schopenhauer" (Beckett 1992, 62), Beckett introduced this aesthetic of unhappiness into Proust. And having defined his interest in Leopardi by way of Schopenhauer's "unhappiness," the Italian artisan de ses malheurs was engaged to further enrich the essay's pessimistic flavour.9 The importance of Leopardi to early Beckett is exemplified by his attachment to the poem "A se stesso" (To Himself).10 A single unlined sheet of paper survives on which Beckett had copied out the poem, which includes lines which expressed feelings apparently close to Beckett's temperament: Omai disprezza Te, la natura, il brutto Poter che, nascoso, a commun danno impera, E Pinfinita vanita del tutto. (Now despise Yourself, nature, the sinister 69</page><page sequence="10">Mark Nixon Power that, secretly, commands our common ruin, And the infinite vanity of everything.) (TCDMS 10971/9) If we turn to French Romantic writers, it is again those whose writing is tinged with a melancholy air that Beckett read, admired and "borrowed" material from, rather than the more grandiose, elaborate writers. Thus it is not Hugo but de Musset who appears throughout the early works. Although familiar with de Musset's poems ("La Nuit de mai" and "Souvenirs" seemingly favourites, despite being caricatured in Dream), it was probably his reading of Praz's The Romantic Agony that alerted him to The Confessions of a Child of a Century. Beckett read the book in 1931, when he jotted down some entries from the book in his Dream notebook (items 255-57 and 263-67). The references to de Musset in the Dream notebook interrupt the notes taken from Praz at precisely the point at which they are discussed in The Romantic Agony, where the influence of de Sade on de Musset is explored. And, as in the case of Goethe, Beckett was interested in the personal rather than the public writings of another (proto-)Romantic writer, the "celebrated poet Rousseau" (1992, 97), declaring - on the basis of his reading of the "the madness + the distortion" in the Reveries of a Solitary Walker (TM, 5 December 1932) - Rousseau to be an "authentically tragic figure" (TM, undated [16 September 1934]). Another such tragic figure is of course John Keats, apart from the German poets of the period the most important Romantic figure in Beckett's creative development. It is surely no exaggeration to say that Beckett was fascinated by writers and artists who died young, as Keats did, at 25. In his notes on English literary history, for example, Beckett transcribed the title of a poem by Henry Kirke White - "Oft in sorrow, oft in woe" - before noting that White's early death at 21 made him a "[s]ymbol for Romantics of the poet" (TCD MS 10970, 39r)u Having read him as a schoolboy, Keats remained a point of reference throughout Beckett's life, and his admiration for the "Ode to a Nightingale" is evident from the fact that quotations from and references to the poem appear in a large number of texts. In particular, Beckett used and adapted the line "To take into the air my quiet breath" as well as Keats's play on the rhyme between 'death' and 'breath' (lines 52-54 of the poem) in every major publication of the 1930s.12 Tellingly, despite its similar reference to "quiet breathing," Beckett used Keats's more positive poem "Endymion" in Molloy, as Molloy, 70</page><page sequence="11">Beckett and Romanticism in the 1930s substituting 'life' for 'thing,' quotes the line "A thing of beauty is a joy for ever" (1995, 198) For Beckett, Keats and his writing embodied precisely those elements of Romanticism that he most admired. As he explained in a letter to MacGreevy: I like that crouching brooding quality in Keats - squatting on the moss, crushing a petal, licking his lips + rubbing his hands, 'counting the last oozings, hours by hours.' I like him the best of them all, because he doesn't beat his fists on the table. I like that awful sweetness and thick soft damp green sickness. And weariness: 'Take into the air my quiet breath.' (TM, undated [6 April 1930]) Beckett's statement ties together several main aesthetic concerns that would preoccupy him throughout the decade. First of all, Beckett finds in the Keats of 'To Autumn' an analogue to the 'gangrenous' element' of Romanticism, the "oozing" and the "thick soft damp green sickness." But more importantly, Beckett is here locating a quietist attitude in Keats, one which he would seek out and find in numerous other writers in the following years, from Thomas a Kempis via Grillparzer to Geulincx. He is thus favouring the languid, reticent, resigned poet over the exuberant visionary, the figure who - like Dante's Belacqua crouching or Walther von der Vogelweide sitting on his stone - abandons the trope of onwardness, of going up.13 It is a kind of recognition that the Romantic Sehnsucht - Beckett had already used the word in Dream (80) - the longing for love or immortality or spiritual transcendence will always remain unfulfilled. The result is a kind of melancholy anguish, as Goethe expressed in a line from "Mignon's Song" (in Wilhelm Meister) which Beckett copied into his "Sottisier" notebook (RUL MS 2901): "Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt, weiss was ich leide" (Only he who has experienced yearning knows how I suffer; RUL MS 2901, 15r). Furthermore, Beckett's own aesthetic concerns with the threshold between expression and silence, knowledge and incompetence found a parallel with a similar Romantic concern. Thus Mario Praz in the Romantic Agony points to the fact that in scorning "concrete expression," Romantic writers celebrate the "magic of the ineffable," and goes on to quote Keats's poem "Ode on a Grecian Urn": "Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard / Are sweeter" (Praz 1951, 15). 71</page><page sequence="12">Mark Nixon As Anne Atik tells us, Beckett was also familiar with Keats's idea of "negative capability," designating (as he expressed in a letter to his brothers dated 21 December 1817) "a man [...] capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason"; a line that sums up Beckett aesthetic movement over the course of the 1930s (Atik, 71; Keats 1974, 55). Beckett's specific evaluation of Romanticism in general and Keats in particular can also be traced through his comments on Dutch and Romantic painting during his trip to Germany in 1936/37. The quietist attitude he detected in Keats, as expressed in his letter to MacGreevy, finds expression in his comments on Philips Wouwermann, whose "lyrical" landscapes he admired, the "solitary riders + resting scenes" (GD, 5 February 1937). As in his response to Romantic literature, Beckett was aware of the "frontier of sentiment + sentimentality' (GD, 6 December 1936). Even in Munch's more contemporary painting he discerned "feeling inclined to be overstated into the sentimental" (GD, 20 January 1937). On the whole he thought that German Romantic painters were hopelessly mired in sentimentality, and in his diary notes how he regarded their work "with loathing" (GD, 21 October 1936). The one German painter exempted from this dismissal was Kaspar David Friedrich. His comments on Zwei Manner den Mond betrachtend (Two Men Observing the Moon, 1819), an acknowledged visual influence on Waiting for Godot, are strikingly similar to his reading of Keats: "Pleasant predilection for 2 tiny languid men in his landscapes, as in the little moon landscape, that is the only kind of romantic still tolerable, the bemolise [the minor key]" (GD, 14 February 1937).14 Beckett's sympathy with this quiet melancholy was closely connected with his growing emphasis on the unsaid, the implied, rather than exultant, overemphasised expression. Almost amounting to an aesthetic credo, Beckett repeatedly and in various guises made the distinction, as in his comments on modern German painters, preferring the "stillness + the unsaid of [Willem] Grimm + [Karl] Ballmer" (GD, 26 November 1936) as opposed to Bargheer's "enormous competence" (GD, 26 November 1936) and Schmidt-Rottluff s "programmatic monumentalism" (GD, 19 December 1936).15 Beckett's attraction to melancholy Romanticism stayed with him all his life - he was fond of quoting Keats in the last months of his life. In Malone Dies, fragments of Romanticism resurface in the description of "such a night as Kaspar David Friedrich loved, tempestuous and bright" when "[t]hat name comes back to me, those names" (1994, 72</page><page sequence="13">Beckett and Romanticism in the 1930s 198). There follows a passage in which Beckett in quick succession references many of the poems he had already drawn upon in his work of the 1930s: The clouds scud, tattered by the wind, across a limpid ground. If I had the patience to wait I would see the moon [Shelley, "To the Moon"]. But I have not. Now that I have looked I hear the wind. [Shelley. "Ode to the West Wind"] I close my eyes and it mingles with my breath [Keats, "Ode to a Nightingale"]. Words and images run riot in my head, pursuing, flying, clashing, merging, endlessly. But beyond the tumult there is a great calm [Wordsworth, Lyrical Ballads], and a great indifference, never really to be troubled by anything again. (1994, 198) Whether he wanted to or not, Beckett's own temperament opened his work up to Romantic influences. As he stated after a walk on the outskirts of Hamburg: "Feel most happily melancholy" (GD, 7 November 1936). Notes 1. Such an enlargement of the self Beckett detected in Rilke's "Ichgott," the "prime article of the Rilkean faith, which provides for the interchangeability of Rilke and God" (1983, 66). Cf. also Beckett's note on Schelling's statement that "Nature is the ego in process of becoming," taken from Windelband's A History of Philosophy; TCD MS 10967, 247r. 2. Beckett is alluding to Hobbema's The Avenue at Middelharnis (1689) in London's National Gallery. The Cuyp mentioned here could be any one from a number held in London, as many of Cuyp's landscapes have both a golden sky and the flight of birds. 3. Cf. also Beckett's comment following a visit to the National Gallery in London, where he "saw a lot in the Segers that I had not seen before" (TM, 8 October 1935). 4. Throughout his life Beckett made jokes based on Wordsworth's daffodils, as when he talks to Arland Ussher about the "bull let loose among the cows in Eisenstein's General Line, a reference which I confess only occurs to me this moment, in the calm light of March winds caught up like sleeping daffodils"; letter to Arland Ussher, 25 March 1936 (HRHRC). Cf. also his note 73</page><page sequence="14">Mark Nixon to Judith Douw (Schmidt) that it was the "most wretched Spring within memory of daffodils"; letter of 27 April 1965 (Syracuse). 5. The Faust line is from Part 1,11.3374-77; English translation taken from: Faust, trans, by Albert G. Latham, 116. 6. Cf. also Beckett's letter of 12 May 1938 to Arland Ussher, in which he quotes Herriot's "obsolete vitamins of romanticism." 7. See my "'Scraps of German.'" 8. George Reavey, diary entry for 15 July 1930 (HRHRC). Beckett told MacGreevy that he was struggling to start writing in a letter dated 25 August 1930, but completed the essay on 17 September 1930. 9. The Watt notebooks contain a further reference to the "unhappy writer" Leopardi, in Notebook 1, 31r (HRHRC). In a 1958 letter to A.J. Leventhal, Beckett confirmed that "Leopardi was a strong influence when I was young (his pessimism, not his patriotism!)"; letter to A.J. Leventhal, 21 April 1958 (HRHRC). The epigraph to the first edition of Proust was taken from Leopardi, but removed from subsequent editions. 10. The poem is cited in Dream (62). 11. When taking biographical details and dates on writers and painters in his notebooks, Beckett tended to append an exclamation mark beside artists who died young. 12. Cf. Dream (107), "Dante and the Lobster" (1973, 22), Murphy (86, 128), Watt (31). Note also how Beckett admired Goethe's "Wandrers Nachtlied," in which the song of the birds is ended. 13. Presumably alluding to Keats's sickness, Beckett refers in Proust to "the terrible panic-stricken stasis of Keats" (90). 14. Cf. Knowlson (2002, 78) for a discussion of the 'bemolise' Beckett detected in Friedrich. Note that Friedrich's paintings did not always fulfil the criteria of the 'minor key.' Beckett described the painting Kreuz im Gebirge (1807-08) as appealing to the "very dregs of aesthesia" (GD, 14 February 1937). 15. In his 1938 review "Intercessions" Beckett similarly detected in Devlin's poems "the extraordinary evocation of the unsaid by the said" (1983, 94). 74</page><page sequence="15">Beckett and Romanticism in the 1930s Works Cited Atik, Anne, How It Was: A Memoir of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber, 2001).
