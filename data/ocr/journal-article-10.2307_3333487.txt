<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Metaphysics of Poetry: Subverting the "Ancient Quarrel" and Recasting the Problem DAVID SWANGER Famously, Plato, speaking for Socrates, claims in The Republic that there is an "ancient quarrel" between poetry and philosophy. Many of us have wor- ried this quarrel at considerable length, usually approaching it in terms of content-the content of philosophy, as Plato would have it, is reason, while that of poetry is emotion. In Book X of The Republic Plato establishes, in rapid order, first a dualism, then a dualism of antagonists; then, only a little less rapidly, a legion of interpreters who try to explain the antithesis upon which he insists. It need hardly be added that Plato's view of poetry and other of the arts has had consequences for education. I'd like to see us make a break from the parameters Plato established and assess the relationship between poetry and philosophy in an entirely other way. As context for a re-examination of the relationship between poetry and philosophy, consider this conversation between Alice and the White King when the King is concerned about two messengers he awaits and says to Alice: "Just look along the road, and tell me if you can see either of them." "I see nobody on the road," said Alice. "I only wish I had such eyes," the King remarked in a fretful tone. "To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance too! Why it's as much as I can do to see real people, by this light."1 The point I take is that language is flexible, and not just beyond the Looking Glass. You or I, as easily as Alice, might look down the road and say, "I see nobody." Or to refine the concept further, language is a verb; contrary to set rules, it is what we make it do. Language conceived as a verb is immensely important to poetry. It is also immensely important to certain modern philosophers, Wittgenstein David Swanger is Professor of Education and Creative Writing, University of Califor- nia at Santa Cruz.

I shall speak more of both poetry and these philosophers subsequently. First, although the outlines of Plato's formulation are, I assume, well known, we should remember that he finds in poetry so extreme a menace to the individual and the Republic that he proposes to banish from it even so eminent (or, precisely so eminent) a poet as Homer. This kind of thinking and, beyond abstract thought, policymaking, emanating from Western culture's avatar of reason is what has fueled generations of scholarship on the topic of poetry's relationship to philosophy. That such scholarly delib- eration continues to the moment is attested by Thomas Gould's recent book The Ancient Quarrel between Poetry and Philosophy.2 While Plato does not, by any means, speak of language as a verb, he is concerned that the poet misuses language to deceive the unwary. It is ex- actly the fluid and active quality of language in poetry that, for Plato, be- speaks danger. If language can be manipulated, reality can as well, contrary to the immobile and ideal reality on which everything, for Plato, depends. Thus when I take up the "ancient quarrel" here, I suggest that two different notions of language itself may be central to it. In addition, I suggest that there is another dimension to the relationship between philosophy and poetry which requires that we recast the problem. We may be able to agree that there is one Poetry with which we are con- cerned-that is, we might agree that all poetry, ancient to modern, is essen- tially one in its use of imaginative, metaphoric, and symbolic language. But there is not one philosophy; rather, there are many philosophies, some of which are not at war with poetry. Homer may be as welcome in Plato's Re- public as pork at a Bar Mitzvah, but not all republics are Plato's.3 For example, what do we make of Wittgenstein's distinctly un-Platonic remark that "philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity"?4 This occurs in his seminal work on metaphysics, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. And, further, what of Wittgenstein's comment that "the whole sense [of the Tractatus] might be summed up in the following words: what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence"?5 And, finally, what of his assertion that all philosophy is "a critique of language"?6 There is little doubt that Wittgenstein is a figure with whom to reckon in modern philosophy.7 There is little doubt, either, that among his achieve- ments is recognition of the limits of language and, therefore, philosophy. There is little doubt also that Wittgenstein, in the potent, elliptical Tractatus, sets us difficult questions. My attempt at answers to Wittgenstein's questions will be managed through a discussion of poetry, since I am drawn inexorably to the issues of "the ancient quarrel" because I am both a poet and an educational philoso- pher and because I consider poetry to share much of philosophy's method</page><page sequence="3">Metaphysics of Poetry 57 as posited by Wittgenstein. Poetry, rather than countermanding philoso- phy, may fill the "silence" of which philosophy cannot speak. Using my own work as examples, here is what I have in mind: This Waking Unafraid Walking in the shadow of the hawk's torment, a swarm of starlings, morbid thoughts do not unsettle me, nor does a sudden mystery, the squirrel's perfect corpse lying in the path. Lately my death comes to me like a warm season, causing calm to bloom, causing me to open the fist in which I've held my life. Not that all your elegance and the surging we make have become less; if anything, our equipoise, hard earned and honed, is beyond account. I don't understand it, this ability to sleep through the night, this waking unafraid as if everything important doesn't matter and what's unfinished can be left whole.8 The activity here is the sensate awareness of being alive, an activity that requires recognition and release from the thrall of mortality, an activity which philosophy might well "pass over in silence" since it cannot be "said clearly." Instead, it must be said using language as a verb, and as nonsense. In the poem we have not a battle with philosophy; instead, we have poetry that extends language into the metaphysical realm philosophy would, but cannot, enter. How then does poetry, itself an activity like philosophy, "work"? In this poem, we have, first of all, anthropomorphism, one kind of nonsense. How else could a hawk be tormented? All we know of the world is that we have seen hawks pursued by smaller birds; the imputation of emotion is wholly mine in writing the poem, ours if we believe the image. A "perfect corpse" is also nonsense, a bizarre and illogical image since death is the result of damage, externally or internally inflicted. Perfection of a corpse is also liter- ally impossible because the corpse, from the instant it becomes a corpse, decays. Further on in the poem, bloom, a feature of flowers, is colorful, even riot- ous; yet in the poem's nonsense "calm" blooms. My life is held in my fist, which then opens. The image in its entirety is literally impossible; but if it were not, we still might expect "life" to flee once released from a closed</page><page sequence="4">58 David Swanger hand. And so forth. Possibly the most nonsensical act of language in the poem occurs in the closing images, where we find the oxymoronic structure of importance as unimportant and the unfinished as whole. The poem utters the unspeakable. It chafes against philosophy's limit as posited by Wittgenstein, even as it accepts the method he proposes, and functions, in its use of language, as "a critique of language," dismantling linguistic conventions in order to depict at once a sense of mortality and escape from it. While Plato's philosophy would find "This Waking Un- afraid" a hoax dangerous to individuals and the state, Wittgenstein's would applaud at least its attempt, perhaps its execution. The poem is neither infe- rior nor insubordinate to philosophy as conceived by Wittgenstein; instead it extends the metaphysics philosophy undertakes. Let me turn now to the other modern philosopher I mentioned, Henri Bergson. His is an explicit and unabashedly enthusiastic endorsement of poetry's collaboration with modern philosophy, and metaphysics in par- ticular.9 Not that Bergson, any more than Wittgenstein, discusses poetry per se; still, Bergson's metaphysics celebrates a feature of the mind essential to poetry-intuition, or what he calls "intellectual sympathy.10 We might also observe that Bergson disparages "Platonizing" as "pouring all possible experience into pre-existing moulds."ll For Bergson, there are two essential ways of knowing things-by mov- ing round the object and by entering into it.12 The first comprises analysis; the second, intuition. Intuition, or intellectual sympathy, enables one to place her- or himself "within an object in order to coincide with what is unique and consequentially inexpressible." Analysis, on the contrary, is "the oper- ation which reduces the object to elements already known, that is, to elements common both to it and other objects."13 The problem or limitation of analysis is that reality does not stand still to be observed; thus "fixed concepts extracted by our thought from mobile re- ality" will give us, at best, partial knowledge.14 Bergson offers this inge- nious analogy: Consider the mind to be the sun. And the mind is to observe some teeming muck brought up from the sea. Yet no sooner is the sea muck exposed to the drying rays of the sun, than it is transformed into sand.15 Thus Bergson advocates that "our intelligence... follow the opposite method. It can place itself within the mobile reality, and adopt its cease- lessly changing direction; in short, can grasp it by means of that intellectual sympathy which we call intuition."16 Formidable, the task Bergson sets us-that the mind itself should be ever mobile, even as it attempts to get a fix on an object or experience. The mind has no fixed place to stand, as it were, to make its observation. And the col- loquialism to "get a fix" on something offers the essential contradiction. Our inclination, as we would know and understand the world, is precisely to make it stand still, or at least to stand still ourselves, to find purchase</page><page sequence="5">Metaphysics of Poetry 59 amid "the blooming, buzzing confusion"17 that composes reality, in order to observe and come to know it. Plato, of course, provides us with an un- shakable observation platform; Bergson sets us adrift in an unceasing wash of current and countercurrent. As noted, neither Wittgenstein nor Bergson mentions poetry specifically in his metaphysics. Even so, I suggest that Wittgenstein's Tractatus de- scribes the mobility of language poetry requires; and that Bergson's Meta- physics describes exactly the mobility of perception poetry creates. Consider this next example: Scar The truth is never enough but I'll tell it anyway: this scar was once a blue bird with a forked tail, applied by the staccato prick of a tattooist's electric needle behind the dusty glass off Broad Street in Newark N.J. on a day when peace marchers and pickpockets shuffled toward police barriers. This blue bird with its forked tail was the reason you left me and my biceps, my upper arm flexor which made the bird fly or hover and stoop from the flesh- colored sky my arms supported above your body before you enrolled in Language Studies at Princeton where your maiden name could speak after its pronounced silence. This reason was the abrasive wheel in the doctor's office among the aquariums full of dying fish where my skin was flayed (having found an ad, "Tattoos Removed," in the Yellow Pages), flying off me like soft sparks, blood, ink and flesh into the air; I left with a clumsy bandage and the old man's promise there would be no evidence of all these fallen feathers.</page><page sequence="6">60 David Swanger The scar is because I'm black the doctor said to my white face while his fish watched. "Black people form more keloid tissue; it's not my fault." OK, I don't mind being black, but this is a big scar something like a blue bird with a forked tail, and my biceps makes the scar fly toward an apparition of a pale bird just visible inside the shape of itself. Which is why I probably am too hard on both of us, creating these collisions now, like the bird who comes down the chimney into our lives and bangs its life out against the window even though we try to save it, and tells us something as we pick up the weightless body, the irrational broken neck and the single bead of blood losing its luster.8 What have we here? The poem is titled "Scar" and ostensibly describes a bird-shaped scar left by the inept removal of a tattoo which was the image of a bird. At least that is what we know if we cling to a fixed perception of inert language. But the language of the poem doesn't allow us such stable vantage. The opening phrase, "The truth is never enough," is sufficient to throw us off balance. Surely I, as poet, want you to read my work; yet I tell you at the outset it will be insufficient-I lay claim to the truth, even if it is not "enough." In this poem I am saying something quite similar to the Tractatus where Wittgenstein observes there is essential knowing beyond the ability of language to speak it. But the poem attempts to use language to extend the boundaries of knowing, a metaphysical act, and an act of bravado or foolishness, depending on what you think of the poem. Immediately thereafter, the poem appears to be literal, almost as if to provide us with a fixed place for our observation: we hear, simply, how the tattoo was acquired. But no sooner is this accomplished, than the tattoo is spoken of as "the reason" for a failed love. The tattoo becomes a bird flying on flesh, flesh becomes insufficient to sustain love, and "the reason" is transformed into an act of masochism as I have myself flayed, according to the poem, in order to remove the tattoo, and more. The center of the poem would appear to return us to the literal, a world of the analytically known. The doctor tries to reason with me about the scar;</page><page sequence="7">Metaphysics of Poetry 61 the doctor offers what he considers logical explanations. Yet the scar quickly reassumes its evasive status in the world. It is the ghost of a scar; but what kind of scar? Not simply a scar inflicted on flesh, nor a scar that suggests not only the wound but the healing. The bird-shaped scar of a now gone tattoo of a bird becomes allied with the doomed bird that blunders into a house, then crashes to its death against an illusion of escape, the window. Finally, it seems I have reached my limit. The rest may be truly unsayable. Thus the phrase "and tells us something" with reference to the meaning of "the bird who comes down/the chimney into our lives/and bangs its life out against/the window even though we try/to save it." Per- haps even poetry cannot say what the poem's accretion of events and sym- bols means. Or perhaps I know I have already accomplished my mission, that the poem has entered the realm where other discourse could only be silent and has spoken meaningfully about love defeated, recollected and reverberatory, memorialized in, first, a tattoo, then, the scar of the tattoo. One thing is clear: in order to enter the realm the poem enters, we must do as Bergson advises. We must be willing to go beyond an "operation of the mind" that depends on what we already know and into the domain Bergson identifies as intuition or "intellectual sympathy." "Scar," no less than "This Waking Unafraid" is, from its opening assertion, a kind of non- sense or linguistic discombobulation-its given also is that language is a verb. If the poem succeeds, nonsense makes eminent sense: of course there is a connection between a tattoo of a bird and lovemaking; and between love and abrasion, both physical and emotional; and between a tattoo, love's af- termath, and the collisions that continue in our lives, however experienced and ardent we may become in avoiding them. But these connections are in- tuitive, not formally logical; and they therefore depend on our intellectual sympathy with the world created by the poem, thereby connecting the poem within itself and to the emotional constellation we bring to it. The two examples I've given so far are poems born directly of my own personal experience. They are examples in which I, as poet, seek to know my life and in the process to share what I have come to know, through my art, with others. What happens when the poet does not work directly from his or her own experience?19 Very much the same thing-as the following poem may demonstrate: Photograph All the Jews are in the photograph, a curled and jaundiced leaf blown into the dry gutter by the windstorm which blows rain back into the clouds, cities back into their alleys, desire into the open mouth of long, mysterious histories. All the Jews in the photograph are old; all the Jews in the photograph are not so old.</page><page sequence="8">62 David Swanger The children stand next to the worn coats of their fathers, the wide skirts of their mothers: they entrust their smallness to the world where their parents walk. In the photograph everyone is breathing, but there is no intimate, aromatic breath to be seen. The breath of the Jews in the photograph is like snow which comes from darkness and disappears into light, changing everything, as when dark changes into a voice. The breath of the Jews in the photograph is a silence which is not silence, an unscrolling of commandments we can not easily obey. And not in the photograph at all, rounding a distant corner in the iron heaviness of its breath comes a train, right on schedule, turning the air into ashes.20 Language again is being used against the constraints of language. Most specifically, I employ contradiction to develop tension via a pattern of nega- tion within the poem, notwithstanding that each negation is an assertion. The pattern builds through "All the Jews in the photograph are old/All the Jews in the photograph are not so old," "In the photograph everyone is breathing,/ but there is no intimate, aromatic breath to be seen," and "The breath of the Jews in the photograph is a silence/which is not a silence" to the culminating image, "And not in the photograph at all,/rounding a dis- tant corner in the iron heaviness of its breath/comes a train." For reasons instrinsic to the method of the poem and our intellectual sympathy with it, we do not ask how a train not in the photograph can appear in our field of vision when we are forced by the poem to scrutinize and enter the photo- graph. I will suggest also that if the poem succeeds, one reason we accept and are moved by the patterns of negation in it lies in the nonsense that serves to create the poem's universe, a place where cities are blown into alleys, dark changes into a voice, a mysterious nonsilence unscrolls into commandments, and so forth-language pushed hard. I hope the relationship between poetry generally and certain philosophy in particular has been elucidated by the discussion thus far. Remember, I am not speaking of Plato's philosophy, nor Heidegger's, nor Hegel's, nor even John Dewey's. But with regard to the philosophy of Wittgenstein and Bergson, may we say this: the poems offered here demonstrate how poetry can extend into the realm of silence the metaphysics of which Wittgenstein speaks, while also elucidating the metaphysics of intellectual sympathy that Bergson posits as essential to knowing anything truly? If we can answer the question in the positive, it follows that instead of categorically pitting poetry against philosophy, we would be better served by examining the relationship between poetry and specific philosophies. Further, if what has been said here holds true, we find poetry need not be considered the antithesis of philosophy, contrary to The Republic and Plato's</page><page sequence="9">Metaphysics of Poetry 63 durable legacy. Further, it may be that poetry can indeed be a collaborator with philosophy. I will even propose poetry as metaphysics, enabling us to know in important ways not otherwise afforded us. And lest I am liable to misinterpretation on this point, I reiterate that I am not talking about any specific content or subject matter in poetry-for example, the explicitly philo- sophical meditations that occur in the poetry of Emerson, Wordsworth, or Frost. To the contrary, I am speaking of poetry's method, the various kinds of linguistic nonsense that I know I employ as a poet and that we have ob- served taking place in poems. This method is not the province of any par- ticular kind of poetry; and I have tried to substantiate that the metaphysics of poetry is linguistic method rather than content by choosing the poems I did and by discussing them, as both an intelligent reader and their author, in terms of their linguistic strategies.

In this conception, Bergson participates in a feature of Western philosophy which may have begun with Plato: the propensity to see the world in dualisms and categorize accordingly.

Boundaries between phenomena, I believe, are more accurately conceived as permeable; and complex phenomena typically are made up of more than dualities. 13. Bergson, An Introduction, p. 6.

It may be said that this, like the preceding two poems, also derives from my experience, since contemplating the photograph is an experience, certainly in the Deweyan sense. So the distinction is not absolute, though in this instance the poem is bor of perception and imagination alone, rather than those in concert with actual lived events. 20.
