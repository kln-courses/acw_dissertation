<plain_text><page sequence="1">Earth of Flesh, Flesh of Earth: Mother Earth in the Faerie Queene by WALTER M. KENDRICK UTABILITIE'S claim to sovereignty over gods and men alike, as she lays it before Jove in Book vii of the Faerie Queene, is supported first of all by a genealogical argument: I am a daughter, by the mothers side, Of her that is Grand-mother magnifide Of all the Gods, great Earth, great Chaos child.... (vn.vi.26)1 As a 'Titanesse,' Mutabilitie is older by one generation than any inhab- itant of Olympus. Her first assault on Jove's dominion is based on the simple equation of priority in time with priority to power: because she came first, she deserves first place. Of all her arguments, however, this turns out to be the weakest, and Jove disposes of it handily. Mutabilitie may not pick and choose among the items of her heritage; to claim the antiquity of a Titan means to claim as well the damnation which befell the old order, and the subjection to Jove enforced upon that order by 'etemall doome of Fates decree' (vn.vi. 31). Temporarily blocked, Muta- bilitie makes no effort to dispute this verdict, but shifts to an attack on Jove's supposed partiality of judgment. She appeals her case to the highest him, that is behight Father of Gods and men by equall might; To weet, the God of Nature.... (vn.vi.35) Jove, though understandably furious, has no recourse. Evidently, Muta- bilitie had never expected that her claim to bluer blood than Jove's would have much effect on him. The past is dead even among immor- tals, and it is only her subsequent proof of present influence upon the entire universe which poses any real challenge to the order she seeks to overthrow. That Spenser should choose to make Mutabilitie a Titanesse, and hence the immediate offspring of Earth, is indicative of the equivocal position which the most ancient of mother-figures occupies within the 1 The text of the Faerie Queene used throughout is that edited byJ.

Although traditional epithets of fruitful- ness are repeatedly assigned to Earth-there are references to her 'fruit- full woomb' (ii.vii.51) and to her 'fruitfull lap' (IV.x.45)-the role of universal fertility-symbol is taken over in the poem almost wholly by Venus, through whose multiple aspects the complex interrelationships of love, sex, and reproduction are explored with great subtlety. And, although evil things in plenty are born from the earth, it is Night who gets Duessa's dubious homage as the 'Grandmother of all' (I.v.22). Earth, indeed, assumes no explicit role at all in the mythology of the Faerie Queene. It is as if Spenser, much like Jove in the face of Muta- bilitie, prefers to relegate Earth to the dead and distant past, which the reign of enlightened Olympus has buried forever. But the past is not quite dead, and Earth makes herself felt throughout the poem as a stub- born reminder of its survival. Until Mutabilitie rises to trouble Jove, the only character in the poem who has aligned himself with Earth's fruitfulness, or suggested that one ought to rely on it, has been Archimago. Disguised as the Redcrosse Knight, he pledges eternal faithfulness to Una: The earth shall sooner leaue her kindly skill To bring forth fruit, and make eternall derth, Then I leaue you, my liefe, yborne of heauenly berth. (I.iii.28) And later, as he tries to persuade Guyon to attack Redcrosse, he glorifies Una's beauty: As on the earth, great mother of vs all, With liuing eye more faire was neuer seene, Of chastitie and honour virginall: Witness ye heauens, whom she in vaine to helpe did call. (n.i.io) In bestowing praise on Mother Earth, while at the same time working hard to trap Guyon, Archimago here anticipates both the language and the motivation of Mutabilitie, who will honor 'Earth (great mother of vs all)' in the process of demonstrating her own absolute power (vn.vii.17). In both cases, Archimago inadvertently exempts Una from earthly ancestry or thraldom. Perhaps even he cannot bring himself to class her among the creatures in the poem which are the explicit prod- ucts of Earth's bounty. In addition to Mutabilitie, Earth is the imme- diate parent of Orgoglio (i.vii.9), Maleger (n.xi.42), and the twins Argante and Ollyphant (m.vii.47-48). She is also the putative mother of 534</page><page sequence="3">MOTHER EARTH IN THE FAERIE QUEEN Sans Foy (i.ii.19), Gerioneo (v.x.3 5), Grantorto (v.xii.23), and Disdaine (vI.vii.41), all of whom fall upon, and sometimes bite, their 'mother earth' as they die. The earth's fertility does include the innocent capacity for bringing forth fruits and flowers, and it is this aspect which Archi- mago means to invoke; yet the same mildly fecund earth pours out, from one end of the Faerie Queene to the other, a grim succession of monsters, and it is of this sinister propensity that one is reminded by the wily magician's praise. There is no systematic family-tree of evil in the Faerie Queene, and it would be too much to claim that Spenser regards Earth as a malevolent matriarch in the manner of Mother Night.2 In only two of the above cases is the conception of Earth's evil progeny described in any detail, and both of them are rapes. Orgoglio was sired upon the unwilling Earth by 'blustring Aeolus' (I.vii.9), and Argante and Ollyphant are the products of Typhoeus' blood-drunken assault upon his own mother (III.vii.47). In the other cases, Earth's maternity is mentioned only in- cidentally, at the moment when the monster at last is slain and falls again to the motherly clay from which it first arose. Earth plays no active role in the engendering of the evil creatures which owe their lives to her: she remains totally passive, as much the victim of those who would impregnate her as of the hostile beings which spring from such violent unions. Her fecundity, potent as it is, has no power of choice: guided by Genius, she can provide the stuff from which all living forms are shaped in the Garden of Adonis (III.vi.31-32), and Nature's radiance can inspire her to bring forth 'dainty trees' upon Arlo hill (vII.vii.6); but Earth herself cannot discriminate among the seeds which would make her pregnant. Mother Earth exists in the Faerie Queene as a kind of vast amoral potential, a barely sentient but powerfully living source of flesh. She can supply that flesh to benevolent purposes and will submit 2 Night herself is an ambiguous figure, who is not without her beneficial aspect. She appears in two forms before Nature's tribunal, both as the fearsome hag riding 'with equall pase' beside bright Day (vu.vii.44), and, in the following stanza, as 'timely Night,' virgin daughter ofJove, whom he has stationed with her sister Hours as porters at heav- en's gate. However terrible Night may be, she is bound, as she complains to Duessa, by the 'chayne of strong necessitee' which makes her give way before Jove's favored 'sonnes of Day' (I.v.25). Night is made beneficial by the same intelligent ordering which refutes the claims of Mutabilitie: evil beings, like those sired on the helpless earth, are wanton, while in the process of ordered change even Night becomes the servant of Nature's be- nevolent will. 535</page><page sequence="4">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY to the rule of good government, but she is equally docile to evil, and her unjudging womb teems as well with monsters. All the monsters to whom the earth gives life are unrelievedly cruel to their mother. Orgoglio terrifies all opponents with A snaggy Oke, which he had tome Out of his mothers bowelles, and it made His mortall mace, wherewith his foemen he dismayde. (I.vii.1o) When Arthur at last vanquishes him, Earth's response is hardly ma- ternal: Such was this Gyaunts fall, that seemd to shake The stedfast globe of earth, as if for feare did quake. (I.viii.23) Indeed, the range of response which Spenser anywhere attributes to Earth is extremely limited. When the dragon which had besieged Una's parents falls to the ground, 'th'earth him vnderneath / Did grone, as feeble so great load to lift' (I.xi.54); she groans again each time Maleger rebounds from her bosom (II.Xi.42), and trembles when the trumpet sounds at the start of Busirane's dumb show (III.xii.2). Throughout the Faerie Queene, Earth is subject to a relentless series of vicious and violent assaults. She is raped, disemboweled, bitten and pounded upon, forever abused but only seldom complaining. Though she will give herself to wise ordinance as readily as to wanton evil, evil exists in a multitude of lustful forms, and Earth's very inability to foster good or defend against evil dooms her to a woeful preponderance of wicked children. Perhaps the most striking emblem of the mindless fecundity which characterizes Earth in the Faerie Queene is the traditional vision of the mud deposited each year by the flooding Nile, which generates hordes of horrible creatures in the warmth of the sun. Errour's crawling prog- eny are likened to these creatures: As when old father Nilus gins to swell With timely pride aboue the Aegyptian vale, His fattie waues do fertile slime outwell, And ouerflow each plaine and lowly dale: But when his later spring gins to auale, Huge heapes of mudd he leaues, wherein there breed Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male And partly female of his fruitfull seed; Such vgly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed. (I.i.21) 536</page><page sequence="5">MOTHER EARTH IN THE FAERIE QUEEN The husbandless impregnation of Chrysogone takes place in a manner which, on the face of it, is similar: So after Nilus invidation, Infinite shapes of creatures men do fynd Informed in the mud, on which the Sunne hath shynd. (m.vi.8) But in Chrysogone, the same sun's rays generate Belphoebe and Amoret, which in the womb of Earth breed only monsters. Things bred in the earth must be half-formed and vicious, because their mother, unani- mated by mind or spirit, can contribute only ungoverned flesh to her offspring. Because Mother Earth occupies only a marginal place in the pantheon of the Faerie Queene, because she is subject to no personification and pos- sesses little of what one could call character, she cannot be spoken of in terms such as one would use to describe the more clearly allegorical and symbolic beings which inhabit the poem. Except for an occasional ref- erence to Jove's war with the Titans, and Mutabilitie's presumptuous argument at the very end of the poem, the Faerie Queene devotes no attention at all to the question of how the universe came to be in the first place. The Faerie Queene is almost exclusively concerned with the present, with the problem of how man is to live in this world, here and now. Its universe is anthropomorphic and anthropocentric; its land- scape is that of the human mind, and the issues with which it concerns itself are the definition of the mind's most perfect internal composition, and the formulation of the ways in which the individual mind may best come to terms with the other human minds which inhabit its world. The prehuman age, when Earth was an active divinity, is even more remote from this world, and considerably less pertinent to it, than the Golden Age of peace to which that evil time gave way. The Earth of the Faerie Queene trembles only now and then with echoes of ancient vigor, and only the vilest malignity of the human minds which dwell upon her can awaken outrage in her near-dead soul. The enormous passivity of the earth, as noted earlier, leaves it open to violation by any wanton force, and it is characteristic that the most horrendous rape of earth in the Faerie Queene is perpetrated not by divine lust but by human greed. Mining, as Guyon summarizes its history for the skeptical Mammon, is at once the clearest sign that the Golden Age is lost and the most malignant source of the discord and 537</page><page sequence="6">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY hatred which wrack the present age. Before he learned mining, man was content to follow Nature's temperate way; Then gan a cursed hand the quiet wombe Of his great Grandmother with steele to wound, And the hid treasures in her sacred tombe With Sacriledge to dig. Therein he found Fountaines of gold and siluer to abound, Of which the matter of his huge desire And pompous pride eftsoones he did compound; Then auarice gan through his veines inspire His greedy flames, and kindled life-deuouring fire. (nI.vii.17) These fruits of Earth's womb are not evil in themselves; evil lies only in the human avarice which seeks them out, and the human pride which sees itself magnified in their glitter. Gold and precious gems are of no more intrinsic worth, or malignant power, than the 'mucky filth' which can pollute even the 'purest streames' (ii.vii.15); both are merely mud, and it is an unforgivable defilement of the purity of the human spirit that the mind should occupy itself with what is in fact no better than flashy dust. Throughout the Faerie Queene, the lowly origin of earthly wealth is repeatedly invoked. Malbecco's mind is irredeemably set on 'mucky pelfe.' To hoord vp heapes of euill gotten masse, For which he others wrongs, and wreckes himselfe. (III.ix.4) Eventually, he returns his treasure to its source, burying it in a 'hollow greaue' from which he never retrieves it (III.x.42). Munera is so en- thralled by her own 'mucky pelfe' that her hands have turned to gold and her feet to silver; in his customarily to-the-point fashion, Talus burns her treasure, appendages and all, and pours the ashes into a brook, thereby presumably polluting it (v.ii.27). Spenser is at all times grimly conscious of the sheer unwieldy bulk of worldly wealth, the blind earth-seeking weight which serves as a constant reminder of the source from which it came. Gold and silver have their own kind of fecundity which, like Earth's own, serves with absolute submission any force that takes it up. Wealth can be both the emblem and the tool of true glory: Spenser points to the Amazonian 'land of gold' as an incitement to re- luctant British valor (Iv.xi.22); and though there are many 'wretches' 538</page><page sequence="7">MOTHER EARTH IN THE FAERIE QUEEN who bewail the loss of the treasures heaped on Marinell's Rich Strond, that same wealth, voluntarily cast up by the waves, serves to make Marinell 'a great Lord... / As was in all the lond of Faery, or elsewheare' (III.iv.22-23). One cannot attribute to gold and silver, any more than one can to their great mother, even a trace of conscious malignity; nevertheless, their overwhelming effect above ground is to pervert and pollute the minds of men, minds which should be fixed on higher mat- ters than earthly slime. The argument against mining, which Spenser gives to Guyon, is thoroughly traditional, and every article of it had been considered, and neatly countered, just a generation before Spenser's poem appeared. In the first book of his treatise De Re Metallica (1556), Georguis Agricola cites, among other traditional arguments, the passage from Ovid on which Spenser may have modeled Guyon's speech: nec tantum segetes alimentaque debita dives poscebatur humus, sed itum est in viscera terrae, quasque recondiderat Stygiisque admoverat umbris, effodiuntur opes, inritamenta malorum. iamque nocens ferrum ferroque nocentius aurum prodierat, prodit bellum, quod pugnat utroque, sanguineaque manu crepitantia concutit arma. (Metamorphoses I, 137-143) Not onely corne and other fruites, for sustnance and for store, Were now exacted of the Earth: but eft they gan to digge, And in the bowels of the ground unsaciably to rigge, For Riches coucht and hidden deepe, in places nere to Hell, The spurres and stirrers unto vice, and foes to doing well. Then hurtfull yron came abrode, then came forth yellow golde, More hurtfull than the yron farre, then came forth battle bolde, That feightes with bothe, and shakes his sword in cruell bloudy hand. (Golding translation) Basing their arguments on precedents like this, according to Agricola, poetically minded opponents of mining have attacked the science as un- natural. Terra non occultat [they say], et ab oculis removet ea quae hominum generi utilia sunt et necessaria, sed ut beneficia benignaque mater maxima largitate fundit ex sese, et in aspectum lucemque profert herbas, legumina, fruges, fructa arborum: at fossilia in pro- fundo peritus abstrudit, ervenda igitur non sunt. The earth does not conceal and remove from our eyes those things which are useful and necessary to mankind, but on the contrary, like a beneficent and kindly mother she 539</page><page sequence="8">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY yields in large abundance from her bounty and brings into the light of day the herbs, vegetables, grains, and fruits, and the trees. The minerals on the other hand she buries far beneath in the depth of the ground; therefore, they should not be sought.3 To this argument, Agricola first objects on quasi-religious grounds: Primum qui metalla accusant et ea usu abdicant, non vident se Deum ipsum accu- sare, et scelerum damnare, ut quem res quasdam frustra et sine causa condidisse autu- ment, et malorum autorum esse putent, quae sane sententia piis hominibus et peritis viris digna non est. In the first place then, those who speak ill of the metals and refuse to make use of them, do not see that they accuse and condemn as wicked the Creator Himself, when they assert that He fashioned some things vainly and without good cause, and thus they regard Him as the Author of evils, which opinion is certainly not worthy of pious and sensible men.4 Spenser might well have bowed to this objection (to avoid the sting in its tail, if nothing else); but Agricola's second rebuttal has provocative implications. Deinde metalla certe terra non recondit in profundo, propterea quod ea ab hominibus fodi non velit, sed quia provida solersque natura suum cuique rei locum dedit, ea gignit in venis et fibris commissurisque saxorum, tanquam in vasis properiis, et materia receptaculis. In the next place, the earth does not conceal metals in her depths because she does not wish that men should dig them out, but because provident and sagacious Nature has appointed for each thing its place. She generates them in the veins, stringers, and seams in the rocks, as though in special vessels and receptacles for such material. There is, furthermore, no basis for the argument that metals, once in their proper place, should not be removed by men. Stranger things than this are done over no one's objection. Ego autem istis reprehensoribus nimium molestis pro metallis pisces regeram, quos oc- cultos et latentes in aquis, marinis etiam, capimus, quum multo magis alienum sit ab hominibus terreni animalis vita maris interna que terrae viscera scrutari. But, in refutation of these attacks, which are so annoying, I will on behalf of the metals instance the fish, which we catch, hidden and concealed though they be in the water, even in the sea. Indeed, it is far stranger that man, a terrestrialanimal, should search the interior of the sea than the bowels of the earth.5 3 Georgius Agricola, De Re Metallica (Basel, 1561; facsimile rpt.

That mining is unnatural, that hidden things should not be unveiled, that nature did not intend man to dig the earth-none of these ancient accusations can account for the horror which permeates Mammon's cave, a horror which reappears again and again throughout the Faerie Queene. The boring out of Mother Earth has more sinister implications for Spenser than even the greed which motivates it. I have noted that Earth is the explicit mother of only a handful of the evil creatures which swarm through the poem. Most of its evil creatures, however, do reside within her. From the dragon Errour in Book I, who dwells in a 'darksome hole' inside a deep wood (Ii.14), to the Brigants in Book vi, who inhabit 'hollow caues, that no man mote discouer' (vI.x.41), it is the custom and habit of evil beings to make their abode in some cavity of earth. Indeed, to dwell inside the earth is almost the primary badge of evil: the next-to-last step in Malbecco's degeneration from manhood (before he forgets he ever was a man) is the discovery of a 'caue with entrance small' in which to hide himself (mI.x.57). Most of these evil beings have not violated the earth to make a home inside it; the majority of them are discovered dwelling in caves which seem to belong to them by immemorial right, to be part of their essence as evil. There are sinister implications in Belge's hopeful comment to Arthur, 'The earth to all her creatures lodging lends' (v.x.24)-indeed, the monster with which Gerioneo has terrorized Belge's own lands was born 'of the brooding of Echidna base' deep within the earth (v.xi.23). Man, by opening Earth's womb to seek gold, not only rapes her in the process, but also joins thereby the multitude of malignant creatures which live inside her passive bulk. Mining the earth implies the delib- erate turning of man toward that which is foul and contrary to man- kind, a deed only made blacker still by the violence with which it is done and the bloodshed to which it gives rise-implications which Agricola, no doubt, never thought of, and which his reasonable pro- testations cannot argue away. Despite his possibly retrograde objection to mining, Spenser's por- trayal of the earth's interior structure is consistent in many respects with 541</page><page sequence="10">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY the tenets of sixteenth-century science. Though perhaps no geologist of Spenser's time would have maintained the existence of the classical Hades deep within the bowels of the earth, it was generally held that the earth is not a solid globe but is 'full of channels and fire chambers.'6 The porous or veined nature of the earth was called upon to explain phe- nomena as diverse as earthquakes and the flow of rivers. In his Pleasant and Pitthy Familiar Discourse of the Earthquake in Aprill last, dedicated to Spenser, Gabriel Harvey explains the sensational event on the basis of the earth's cavitied interior: The Materiall Cause of Earthquakes... is no doubt great aboundance of wynde, or stoare of grosse and drye vapors, and spirites, fast shut vp, and as a man would saye, emprysoned in the Caues, and Dungeons of the Earth: which winde, or vapors, seek- ing to be set at libertie, and to get them home to their Naturall lodgings, in a great fume, violently rush out, and as it were, breake prison, which forcible Eruption, and strong breath, causeth an Earthquake. This theory, couched in the jocular terms of a sixteenth-century Mr. Wizard, represents a fashionably up-to-date picture of the earth's in- ternal makeup. Spenser demonstrates his own familiarity with such ideas in the curious simile which figures Paridell's impetuous rush from the tent before Malbecco's castle: Tho hastily remounting to his steed, He forth issew'd; like as a boistrous wind, Which in th'earthes hollow caues hath long bin hid, And shut vp fast within her prisons blind, Makes the huge element against her kind To moue, and tremble as it were agast, Vntill that it an issew forth may find; Then forth it breakes, and with his furious blast Confounds both land and seas, and skyes doth ouercast. (iL.ix.15) A similar figure is used, with trapped fire substituted for air, to describe Arthur's revival from the swoon into which the attacks of Maleger's attendants has thrown him (III.xi.32). That the earth should be subject to gastric disturbances, and even break wind on occasion, is indicative of the organic terminology which was commonly employed, sometimes with great elaborateness, to de- 6 Athanasius Kircher, Mundus Subterraneus (1678), excerpted and translated in Kirtley F.

Even the determinedly unpoetical Agricola is compelled to speak of the earth's venae and fibrae, and many such originally meta- phoric terms have become standard geological vocabulary. In the six- teenth century, the analogy between the earth and a living body was extended to the last detail, even by writers who would never look for actual life in Mother Earth. The concept that the earth is honeycombed with passages, through which water may flow from one hemisphere to the other, is at least as old as Plato's Phaedo, but Leonardo da Vinci uses a demythologized and extremely anthropomorphic version of the same idea to explain the appearance of underground water at altitudes far above sea level. The water runs from the rivers to the sea and from the sea to the rivers, always making the same circuit. The water is thrust from the utmost depth of the sea to the high sum- mits of the mountains, where, finding the veins cut, it precipitates itself and returns to the sea below, mounts once more by the branching veins and then falls back, thus go- ing and coming between high and low, sometimes inside, sometimes outside. It acts like the blood of animals which is always moving, starting from the sea of the heart and mounting to the summit of the head; there, if the veins are burst, as one may see a vein burst in the nose, all the blood in the lower parts mounts to the height of the burst vein.7 SirJohn Davies adapts a similar vision of the earth's nature to the theme of his Orchestra (1596): For those blew vaines that through her body spred, Those saphire streams which from great hils do spring, (The Earths great duggs: for euery wight is fed With sweet fresh moisture from them issuing) Obserue a daunce in their wild wandering. ... (52) This kind of pseudo-life is very different from the intelligent craftiness of the Earth who egged her sons on against the Sky, but Spenser's vision of the earth seems to combine elements of both mythic and sci- entific traditions. Structured much like a human or at least an animal body, the earth still shows flickers of the life which, in the dim and ter- rible past, may once have animated it; but now that life is without sentience, and reveals itself only in indiscriminate fruitfulness and the capacity now and then to groan in pain or shake in terror. Man's wilful burrowing in the earth takes on in this light still more horrible conno- 7 Translated and quoted in Francis MacDonald Cornford, Plato's Cosmology: The Ti- maeus of Plato (1937; rpt. New York, n.d.), p. 330. 543</page><page sequence="12">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY tations: by seeking treasure within the bosom of Earth, or finding ref- uge there, men not only imitate the evil beings who dwell underground, and not only perform thereby a grisly mutilation of a body yet alive, they also make themselves more like the creature they violate, more like that vast body which has no mind. The potent fleshiness of the earth represents in the Faerie Queene the terrible prospect of life without spirit, a formless existence devoid of thought or reason. Man, by seeking to become more like Earth and her offspring, denies the essence of his humanity, that spark of mind in which his whole dignity resides. Yet it is not only by digging mines or dwelling in caves that man allies himself with earth. If Earth's body is in some ways like man's, man's body has something of the earth in it; and by surrendering himself to the reasonless pull of his flesh, man turns away from humanity and toward the ungoverned animality of the dust beneath his feet. Human sexuality threatens at all times to overpower the mind, and the unregulated indulgence of sexual lust is repeatedly figured in the Faerie Queene as a return to fluid formlessness, an imita- tion of the earth's fecund slime. Redcrosse, led astray by Duessa, pays court to her Pourd out in loosnesse on the grassy grownd, Both carelesse of his health, and of his fame. (I.vii.7) And the wicked Malecasta's habits are described in similar terms: For she was giuen all to fleshly lust, And poured forth in sensuall delight, That all regard of shame she had discust, And meet respect of honour put to flight. (m.i.48) When sexual desire lies under the control of mind, it becomes the life- blood of the individual man and the wellspring of society. Merlin's prophecy of the sequence of kings which will follow from Britomart's 'immortall wombe' (iii.iv.ll) is a vision of fecundity employed in hu- man purpose, the opposite extreme from the wanton shapelessness to which the flesh is inclined by its earthly nature. Britomart will initiate an ordered succession of generations, while uninspired earth produces life at random and without control. No sin is more abhorrent to Spenser than the unbridled indulgence of sexual desire: not only does it demean the individual sinner, but it strikes as well at the very root of society, threatening to dissolve all order in chaotic slime. 544</page><page sequence="13">MOTHER EARTH IN THE FAERIE QUEEN Lust is, quite literally, the dirtiest sin in the Faerie Queene; it is always linked with the mire and muck of the earth. Braggadocchio, overcom- ing his initial terror of Belphoebe, 'gan burne in filthy lust' (II.iii.42); Glauce's first fear is that Britomart might have fallen prey to 'filthy lust, contrarie vnto kind' (In.ii.4o); and Arthur's encounter with Flori- mell is prefaced by the explicit distinction between love as it activates a 'brave sprite' and lust as it moves The baser wit, whose idle thoughts alway Are wont to cleaue vnto the lowly clay. (m.v.i) Not only in lust, however, does man taint himself with the dirty fluidity of the earth. Strikingly similar language is used to describe the spectacle of human blood, spilled upon the dust and mingling with it. The Faerie Queene is an extraordinarily bloody poem, and blood is spat- tered over every page of it, sometimes in alarming quantities. Blood flows in streams, ponds, lakes, rivers, seas, and floods; men are stained by it and wallow in it; monsters like Errour's offspring (I.i.25) and the frightful Ate (Iv.i.26) are wont to drink it. The earth sometimes ex- hibits a certain appetite for human blood, as in the case of Kirkrapine, whose life 'the thirstie land / Drunk vp' (I.iii.2o); but in most cases, loss of blood is represented as a nasty defilement very much akin to the mucky filthiness of sensual lust. Guyon finds Phedon lying on the ground 'all soild with bloud and mire' (ii.iv.16); later, Pyrochles comes running toward Guyon, And all his armour sprinckled was with bloud, And soyld with durtie gore, that no man can Discerne the hew thereof. (II.vi.41) Belphoebe comes upon Timias 'with blood / Defowled' (rn.v.38), and Pollente's body falls into the Lee, 'whose waters with his filthy bloud it stayned' (v.ii.19). Good and evil men alike are subject to befoulment by blood, whether their own or an opponent's. The very sight of blood flowing unchecked from the body, and spilling upon the ground, is a horrible reminder of the earth-bound disorder to which human flesh may degenerate at any moment. Blood in itself is powerfully fruitful, and it can be well used-Bel- phoebe and Amoret sucked 'vitall blood' in Chrysogone's womb (in. vi.5)-but the unchecked spilling of blood represents the same wanton fecundity which characterizes Earth herself and the lustful men who 545</page><page sequence="14">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY pour themselves upon her. Blood is the source of life and the promise of it: to spill blood wantonly is to scatter what should be contained, to waste upon the earth what should be wisely governed. Phaedria sepa- rates Guyon and Cymochles with the plea, Ah well away, most noble Lords, how can Your cruell eyes endure so pitteous sight, To shed your liues on ground? (II.Vi.32) But Phaedria, of course, has another kind of life-shedding in mind. The most horrifying spectacle of all is presented by Britomart's fierce battle with Radigund: So long they fought, that all the grassie flore Was fild with bloud, which from their sides did flow, And gushed through their armes, that all in gore They trode, and on the ground their liues did strow, Like fruitles seede, of which vntimely death should grow. (v.vii.31) However just the cause may be in which blood is spilled, the sight of its waste upon the ground is always more than merely gruesome. There is a kind of wantonness in any loss of blood, an abandonment of control analogous to that of the mind's surrender to the ungoverned fluidity of lust. Monsters, when they die, often gush forth a flood of inner filth and corruption-Errour lets loose 'a floud of poyson horrible and blacke' (I.i.2o), and Gerioneo's monster pours out a torrent of'most vgly filth' (v.xi.3i)-thereby revealing the fluid interior of their evil. A similar fluidity is revealed when the human body loses blood; the liquid interior of the human body suggests the capability, if not always the fact, of such corruption, and the constant potential of that earth-bound body for returning to the formless clay from which it came. Man, for Spenser, is a perilous compound of mind and mud, always in danger of reversion to his baser component. Flesh, a thing of earth, gravitates toward formlessness, and is unable to order its own impulses. Man's flesh is as amoral as the pliant clay from which it came, and if he once surrenders himself to its wanton will, he turns from nature's no- blest creation to her most despicable creature: Of all Gods workes, which do this world adorne, There is no one more faire and excellent, Then is mans body both for powre and forme, Whiles it is kept in sober gouemment; But none then it, more fowle and indecent, 546</page><page sequence="15">MOTHER EARTH IN THE FAERIE QUEEN Distempred through misrule and passions bace: It growes a Monster, and incontinent Doth loose his dignitie and natiue grace. Behold, who list, both one and other in this place. (n.ix.i) The vision of Alma's castle, to which this warning is prefaced, offers an elaborate model of the human body in its finest well-governed state. The castle wall is constructed of that same 'Aegyptian slime' which else- where is so treacherously fertile (II.ix.21); here, however, it is molded into a complex mathematical structure, every detail of which is ruled by the same 'goodly gouernaunce' which supervises the kitchen fire and prevents it from spreading (II.ix.30). Alma's castle contains records of the genealogies of both Britain and Faery Land; within its walls, every physical function from digestion to reproduction is brought into co- herent, reasonable form. Before they can enter, however, Arthur and Guyon must drive away a horde of'vile caytiue wretches' which swarm forth from the rocks and caves about the castle. These brutes seem to have bodies, but they are in truth without substance (In.ix.13-15), and their leader is the horrific Maleger, who derives his strength from the earth but has no blood at all (II.xi.38). The fortress of man's well-gov- erned body is under continual assault by beings which are of the flesh but at the same time would negate it. Maleger is in many ways the most frightening of the monsters in the Faerie Queene, because he repre- sents the death-in-life which is the consequence of man's surrender to his earthly part. However well constructed the walls of Alma's castle may be, they must finally crumble: But 0 great pitty, that no lenger time So goodly workmanship should not endure: Soone it must turne to earth; no earthly thing is sure. (II.ix.21) If man is no more than flesh, he will turn to earth when his body does; only the spirit, governing the flesh and transcending it, offers hope for survival beyond the hole in the earth where man's flesh must end. Alma's House of Temperance applies, on the scale of the individual man, the same principle of salvation by ordered control which, in the Garden of Adonis, is envisioned as a cosmic law. In both cases, whether it be Egyptian slime or the matter of the 'huge eternall Chaos' at Earth's core (m.vi.36), the flesh is doomed to dissolution and decay. Flesh, like the earth of which it is made, knows no distinction between good and 547</page><page sequence="16">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY bad, higher and lower destinies. In the later books of the Faerie Queene, when evil beings fall, they are described more and more in terms of the senseless earth to which they revert: the body of Gerioneo's Seneschall blocks the castle gate like a 'lumpe of clay' (v.x. 37); Maleffort's corpse collapses before Crudor's castle-door and chokes the entrance with 'a lumpe of sin' (vI.i.23); and mighty Disdaine falls to the ground 'like to a lumpe of durt' (vi.viii.16). It is the earth in man's flesh which chiefly blocks his way to salvation, yet it is only through the flesh that man's spirit can realize itself. Man's condition hangs in paradox between Spen- ser's often-repeated lament, 'Nothing is sure, that growes on earthly ground' (i.ix.ll), and the admonition, which he makes with equal vehemence, that 'all things not rooted well, will soon be rotten' (iv.i.5i). Man must strike roots in the earth from which he was made, but that earth is treacherously unsure within, honeycombed with evil and liquid with incontinence at the center. No governance of mind, finally, can halt the heavy gravitation of man's flesh toward the slime which shares its substance. Yet, during the brief term of its residence in flesh, man's spirit can reach redemption: it is man's ultimate task, and the problem with which the Faerie Queene is most deeply concerned, to rule and vanquish the earth in his flesh before the earth reclaims it.
