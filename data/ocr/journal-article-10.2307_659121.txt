<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERIODICAL LITERATURE CONDUCTED BY DR ALEXANDER F. CHAMBERLAIN [NOTE.-Authors, especially those whose articles appear in journals and other periodicals not entirely devoted to anthropology, will greatly aid this department of the American Anthropologist by sending direct to Dr A. F. Chamberlain, Worcester, Massa- chusetts, U. S. A., reprints or copies of such studies as they may desire to have noticed in these pages. - EDITOR. Adachi (B.) Hautpigment beim Menschen und bei den Affen. (Z. f. Morph. u. Anthr., Stuttgart, I903, VI, 1-131.) This valuable monograph, with 3 tables and a good bibliography (pp. 124-129), treats of pigmentation of the skin in men and anthropoids, their relations and the interrelations of pigmentation among the anthropoids, the "'blue spot" in children, etc. A r~sumt has already been noticed in Amer. Anthr., 1902, N. S., V, 762. The section on the "blue spot" (pages 102-123) r6sum6s the data on the subject. Dr Adachi con- cludes that the "blue spot" is not an atavism, but rather a rudimentary or re- gressive characteristic; it is something normal, not an abnormality. - u. Fujisawa (K.) Mongolen-Kin- derfleck bei Europ ern. (Ibid., 132- 133.) Brief description, with figure, of a " Mongolian spot " in a Moravian in- fant girl seven weeks old, resembling those found in Japanese children. Anthony (R.) L' volution du pied hu- main. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1902, VeS., III, 818-835.) In this arti- cle, with 14 figures, based chiefly upon the recent studies of M.Volkov, the author reaches the conclusion that in the evolu- tion of the human foot ontogeny repeats phylogeny. The foot of new-born chil- dren of our race reproduces that of men of lower races, approaching, sometimes, even more than the latter, the foot of the arboreal simian, and particularly that of the gorilla, decidedly nearest to the hu- man foot. Azoulay (L.) Un progres important pour les musbes phonographiques. Re- productions galvanoplastiques des phon- ogrammes. Moules m6talliques inalt6r- ables. (Ibid., 787-793.) Describes, with some detail, the galvanoplastic re- production of phonograms and casting the wax disks on a metal matrix (the " phon- otype " of the Vienna Committee). - Moules "galvanoplastiques et mou- lages en cire des phonogrammes sur cylindres.

Meder, Leipzig, ange- fertigten Schideldiagraphen nach Pro- fessor Dr. Klaatsch. (Cbl. d. d. Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen, 1902, XXXIII, 152.) Brief description, with figure, of a skull- drawing apparatus devised by Dr Klaatsch. The writing point is of gold, pierced for ink. Bolton (H. C.) Early instance of tangible lip reading. (Science, N. Y., 1903, N. S., XVII, 631-632.) Notes a case of a girl reported by Bishop Burnet in I685. Brabrook (E. W. ) Presidential address. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1903, xIv, 13-27.) Treats of "the light thrown by the study of folklore on the origin and de- velopment of the faculty of imagination in mankind." Among the topics con- sidered are: Prehistoric man and his works (imagination was much exercised in neolithic age),-the treatment of the dead in the bronze and iron age shows further growth of the imagination,-fes- tivals of the dead and spirit-lore among primitive peoples (Australians, Eskimo, Nicobarese), totemism and heraldry, etc. There is much still to be learned from " the products of that more untutored imagination from which the primitive peoples have derived their incantations and their customs." 555</page><page sequence="2">556 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 5, 1903 Collineau (M.) Gigantisme unilat6ral avec hypertrophie de l'h6misphere c6r&amp; brale du cot6 oppos6. (Rev. de l'tc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, XIII, 99-1oo.) R6sum6s account of Dr Reissmann in The Australasian Medical Gazette for Sept. 20, 1902, of an infant presenting exaggerated development of the right side of the body accompanied by greater development of the opposite side of the skull. Cunningham (D. J.) Right-handedness and left-brainedness. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1902, xxII, 273-295.) In this article (the Huxley lecture for 1902), with 2 plates and 7 figures, after r6- sum6ing the data as to the right-handed- ness of paleolithic and neolithic man, Dr Cunningham discusses, with ref- erences to recent literature, the topic indicated, from the anatomical and physi- ological standpoint. Fetuses, children, apes, microcephalic idiots (18 were ob- served), etc., are considered. The bulging of the arm-area in the human cerebrum (right brain) about the middle or end of the sixth fetal month precedes the shaping of the speech-area, which does not strongly develop before the end of the first infantile years. This argues for the view that the high functioning of the arm was achieved before articulate speech. Right-handedness is "1due to a transmitted functional preeminence of the left brain." The highest degree of right-handedness occurs in civilized races engaged in the highest skilled labor-the introduction of machinery (type-writer, printing machine, looms, etc.) may in time reduce this preeminence somewhat. Dixon (R. B.) The American Associa- tion for the Advancement of Science. Section H. Anthropology. (Science, N. Y., 1903, N. s., xvII, 286-290.) Gives abstracts of papers read Dec. 30, 1902, to Jan. 2, 1903, at Washington, D.C. Du Chaillu, Paul Belloni. (Rec. of Past, Washington, I903, II, 158--160.) Bio- graphical sketch with list of works and portrait of Du Chaillu, who died at St Petersburg, April 29, 1903. Ellis (H.) Variation in man and woman. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N.Y., 1903, 237-257.) Reply to criticism by Professor Pearson, who denies that the variational tendency is more marked in man than in woman. Professor Pearson's .ejection of all ab- normalities as pathological is thought un- scientific. The essential unity of physi- ology and pathology was made clear by Virchow. Fischer (E.) Beeinflusst der M. genio- glossus durch seine Funktion beim Sprechen den Bau des Unterkiefers ? (Anat. Anz., Jena, 1903, xxIII, 33-37.) In this article, with one plate (3 figs.) the author concludes that the genioglossic muscle in its speech-function does not exert a great formative influence upon the lower jaw. -- Zur Vergleichung des Menschen - und Affenschidels in friihen Entwick- elungsstadien. (Cbl. d. d. Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen, 1902, xxxIII, 153- 156.) Discusses by means of models of the skulls of a macaque, a lutung, and a human embryo, the cranial resemblances and differences. The embryonic skulls of these apes have a typical interorbital septum. The observation of the nasal region indicates that the narrow-nosed forms have been developed from the broad-nosed. Gaudry (A.) - Contribution a. l'histoire des hommes fossiles. (C. R. Ac. d. Sci., Paris, 1903, cxxxvI, 266-268.) Com- pares the "man of Mentone " with the modern Australian aborigine, and sug- gests similar ancestors for our race. Godin (P.) Recherches anthropom6- triques sur la croissance des diverses par- ties du corps. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1902, ve s., III, 717-719.) R&amp;- sum6s the author's work Recherches anthropomdtriques sur la croissance des diverses parties du corps (Paris, 1903), based on 36,oo000 measurements of 10oo subjects during their thirteenth to eigh- teenth years. Dr Godin had not noted any case of so-called " abdominal brown line" said to occur at the period of puberty. Hartland (E. S.) The voice of the stone of destiny: an inquiry into the choice of kings by augury. (Folk-lore, Lond., 1903, XIV, 28-6o.) Treats of the "cor- onation stone" (Zia fEil), or I"stone of Tara," election by dream-divination in Irish legend, Transylvanian divination by the crown, Buddhist divination tales, "first man met" tales, animal agent tales (elephant, e. g., in East), "Pope Innocent" (outcast child tales), elec- tions of bishops, birth-portents (Dalai</page><page sequence="3">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 557 Lama), royal auguries, snakes as augurers of royalty, etc. The literary and folk- lore aspects of the subject are considered. Holmes (W. H.) Classification and ar- rangement of the exhibits of an anthro- pological museum. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1902, XXXII, 353-372.) Treats, with 8 figures, of the scheme now being adopted in the U. S. National Museum, Washington, embracing the biological, ethnological, and cultural aspects of man and the races of man, with special ex- hibits for individual purposes. The geo- ethnic, culture-history and special culture arrangements are discussed with some detail (Eskimo as example). A small map of geo-ethnic areas in North Amer- ica is given on page 365. Hommel (F.) Ueber den Ursprung un- seres Alphabetes und seiner Anordnung. (Cbl. d. d. Ges. f. Anthr., Mtinchen, 1903,xxxIV, 44-45.) Argument for East Arabian (Chaldean) origin, not later than 20oo B. C. The original order was based on astrological ideas. Kikuchi (J.) Das Gewicht der mensch- lichen Geharkn6chelchen. (Z. f. Ohren- hlk., Berlin, 19o2, XLI, 1-3.) Gives results of the examination of 741 human ear-bones. The average weight is greater in man than in woman. Greatest with the Chinese, least with the negroes of Africa. See also the author's Unter- suchungyen iiber den menschlichen Steig- b6igel (Weisbaden, 1902). BeitrAge zur Anatomie des mensch- lichen Amboss. ( Ibid., 1902, XLII, 122-125.) This, bone is longest, broad- est, and thickest in Chinese and Rus- sians. It is proportionately greater in new-born than in adult Germans. Klaatsch (H.) Ueber die Variationen am Skelete der jetztigen Menschheit in ihrer Bedeutung fiir die Probleme der Abstammung und Rassengliederung. (Cbl. d. d. Ges. f. Anthr., 1902, xxxIII, 133-151.) Treats, with 22 figures, of the osseous variations (cranial, hands and feet, humerus, tibia, femur, vertebrae, ribs, etc.) in the races of men now ex- isting and their evolutional significance. There are in the skeleton no specifically Mongoloid, Negroid, or European char- acteristics, but only combinations of such in certain limits of variation. A "norm" will hold neither for the European nor for other races. Adaptation to the erect posture has occurred differently with diverse races. The epithet " pithecoid " is rather to be avoided, since the "lower" characteristics are no approach to any now living simian. The so-called "higher" characteristics have been ac- quired in manifold fashion and indepen- dently of one another during the spread of the human race. The present forma- tion of the skull, etc., in Europeans, Mongoloids, and Negroids represents separate developments from a common root. Koch (W.) Some corrosions found on ancient bronzes. (Science, N. Y., 1903, N. S., XVII, 152-153.) Discusses the "pale blue" and "pale green" ex- crescences found on Grecian and Egyptian bronzes in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, due to exposure to a moist atmos- phere. Kollmann (J.) Die Rassenanatomie der Hand und die Persistenz der Rassen- merkmale. (Arch. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1903, xxvIII, 91-141.) Treats, with I table, Io figures and bibliography, the race-anatomy of the hand, the Corcelettes finger-prints, the persistence of race- characteristics. Two forms of the hand are recognized, a broad and a narrow, correlated in the white race with broad and narrow faces. The Corcelettes finger-prints prove the existence of the Europeans for more than 5ooo years. Since the neolithic period, or since ca. io,ooo years, no new race of man has ap- peared - the human races have been per- sistent since at least that time. Man is variable but not mutable. The crossing of human races produces no new varieties and no new types. The variability of man extends to the organs phylogeneti- cally oldest. The old blood of the origi- nal stock adheres through all anomalies, effects of environment, mitissages, etc. Laborde, Jean-Vincent. (Rev. d. 1'Ec. de Anthr. de Paris, 1903, xIII, I37- 142.)

General discussion and re-state- ment of the author's position, called forth by remarks of Mr T. F. Hender- son in the prefatory note to his new edi- tion of The BorderA Minstrelsy (Edin- burgh, 1902.) Lang's view is that</page><page sequence="4">558 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 5, 1903 many ballads are not mere "degraded versions of literary mediaeval romances," but "the work of popular rhymers, often dealing with themes also current in mdrchen of great antiquity, and not bor- rowing from literary sources." Mantegazza (P.) Prime linee di psico- logia positiva. (Arch. p. l'Antr., Fi- renze, 19o3, xxxIII, 65-79.) Ninth and tenth sections treating of sexual love, jealousy, family-sense (paternal affection, fraternal affection), etc. The love of man differs from the love of the animal in that it is not confined to the fecund age alone. The ideal form of the human family is monogamous. Paternal affec- tion is less necessary, less common and less intense than maternal. The Pata- gonian Tehuelches evince an extraordi- nary affection for their children. The Italian people in the matter of psychol- ogy are still in the period of alchemy. There is a proverb, "love of a brother, love of a knife." Maurel (E.) 'Etude des conditions pou- vant modifier la masculinit6. (Rev. Sci., Paris, 1903, 4e s., xIx, 424-431.) Dis- cusses primogeniture, age of mother, marriage-birth interval, menstruation-fe- cundation, condition of parents, social status, masculinity, and natality (statis- tics), etc. Primogeniture, youth of par- ents, father especially), small marriage- birth interval, ovum-maturity, vigor of parents, all increase masculinity. The well-to-do classes have less masculinity, due to pathological influences. Meyer (R. M.) Die Welte. (Arch. f. Kulturgesch., Berlin, 1903, I, 1-17.) Ethnological discussion of the wager, its origin and development. The wager is a sort of "mind or soul challenge." In an age when begging and giving were little in vogue, wagering was an impor- tant means of adding to one's property. It is one of the intellectual sides of play as well as of contest or battle. Nutt (A.) Charles Godfrey Leland. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1903, xIv, 162- I64.) Brief appreciation of a many- sided and much-experienced man, folk- lorist among other things-- died March 30, 1903.

Papillault (G.) Premieres observations necrologiques sur le Dr Laborde. (Rev. de l'Fc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, xIII, 142-143.) Brief notes on the brain of Dr Laborde, the anthropologist. The weight (1234 gr.) is small, the convolu- tions generally little complicated. Peet (S. D.) The earliest home of the human race. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1903, xxv, 191-206.) General argu- ment, with illustrations, to show that "the earliest home of the human race was in the very place where tradition and the scriptures have shown it to have been. " Rapport sur le concours du Prix Fauvelle. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1902, e s., III, 798-799.) Prize awarded to M.

Sacrifices of animals, long con- tinued in the eastern churches, still sur- vive in the Iberian (Georgian) church of the Caucasus, the American church, and among the Nestorians, etc., of eastern Syria. The vegetarian tendencies of Greek philosophy are in part responsible for the gradual disappearance of animal sacrifices in the Christian church. - Alexandre Bertrand. (Ibid., Ioo- 103.)

Hermann Klaatsch's Theorie iiber die Stammesgeschichte der Menschen. (Globus, Brnschwg., 19o3, LXXXIII, 285-286.) Critical discussion of Klaatsch's monograph on Entstehung und Entwickelung der Menschheit in the second volume of H. Krtmer's Weltall und Menschheit (Heidelberg, 1903). Klaatsch holds that the teeth and hand of man go far back in the mam- mal series, making him a truer represen- tative in some respects of pre-human types than the other primates. He is no nearer related to the anthropoids than to the other primates. Schmidt welcomes Klaatsch's work as bound to start a healthy discussion. Schrader (F.) L'atmosphjre. Les vents aliz6s.

A study of the brain- weights of men notable in the professions, arts and sciences. (Phila. Med. J., 1903, repr., 1-I4.) In this article, with tables, curves, and bibliography, the author discusses the brain-weights of 96 notable men. Hypertrophy, atrophy, hydrocephalus, errors of autopsy, etc., are considered. The average of the 96 distinguished individuals is 1473 gr.- the average age of 92 was 63 years. In- cluded in the list are the following anthropologists: Mallery (1503), Ch. Letourneau (1490), Powell (1488), Broca (1484), G. de Mortillet (1480), A. Bertillon (I398), A. A. Hovelacque (1373),-7 individuals averaging 63 years of age, with average brain weight of 1459-3. The 21 cases from the United States and Canada average Ii8 gr., heading the ethnic list. - The post-orbital limbus; a forma- tion occasionally met with at the base of the human brain.

Brief r6sum6 of Retzius' account in the Biolo- gische Untersuchungen for 1902 of the brain of Professor Saljestram, the eminent Swedish physicist and pedagogue (died 1892 aged 76). His splendidly devel- oped brain, with normal asymmetry, weighed 1422 gr. - Brain-weights of brothers and sisters. (Ibid., 516.) Cites after Kockel and Marchaud the brain-weights of a brother and two sisters (4Y2, 3Y, 2 years) drowned together, and of three brothers (I2 , 8, 4Y years) suffocated by gas. Notes also the fact that the brains of the brothers Leidy (eminent man of science, physician) both weighed 1415 gr. Starr (F.) Mary Louise Putnam. (Ibid., 632-633.)

Dis- cusses the question whether religion is sus- ceptible of progress and whether history proves a progress of this sort. The author inclines more and more to a nega- tive answer. There are no marks of a fecund transformation,- no appreciable difference between the animistic, fetish- istic or naturalistic type, the polytheistic and the montheistic types. These are forms, not stages of religion. Modem Christianity, is hardly pure monotheism, not even as purely so as Islam. Windt (C.) Ueber das Erkennen der Menschen an den Fingerspitzen. (Stzgb. d.

An elaborate discussion, with 13 plates (figuring 95 beakers and 98 varieties of ornament) of "Ibeakers'" in ancient Britain of the oldest bronze age, the con- ditions under which they were found, etc., their distribution, ornament, etc., as compared with similar objects from the Rhine region. The "British beaker," the author thinks, arose in central Europe. The "beaker type" is almost unknown in Ireland. Anutschin (D. N.) Russland in arch~io- logischer Beziehung. (Int. Cbl. f.

Neolithic remains are much richer than paleolithic in Russia, and man was widespread in Russia during the former period. In the metal age, the Siberian influence is strong, the western rather weak. In some parts of the country the iron age followed immediately the stone age. In southern Russia the " Scyths " domi- nated from the sixth to the second cen- tury, B. C. The Goths appear on the north coast of the Black sea in the sec- ond century, A. D. The "Sarmatians" who followed the Scyths are succeeded by the Slavs in the fifth or sixth century, A. D.

Per la Sardegna preis- torica. Nota 3a. Le nuove contribuzioni. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antr., 1903, IX, 15-93.) R6sum6s the most important recent publications on Sardinian archeol- ogy and prehistory and discusses the questions and problems involved, par- ticularly Pinza's I monumenti primitivz della Sardegna. The author suggests a pre-dolmen Ligurian population in Sar- dinia. There has been more than one "Pelasgian" invasion. Indeed, as Dr Ardu-Onnis remarks, " both from the number and variety of its monuments, the island of Sardinia does not yield in pre- historic times to Sicily as the crucible of the principal ethnic elements of the Medi- terranean." The "culture of Oristano '' is a new and unknown period in the pre- history of Sardinia. Bardon (L.) et Bouyssonie (J. et A.) Un nouveau type de burin.

Anthr., Miinchen, 1902, XXXIII, 157- 162.) After a general discussion of the various prehistoric and modern races of dogs (a table of skull-measurement em- bodying the chief differences is given on page 162), Dr Birkner r6sumbs the re- searches of Jeittles, Schloss, Kramer, etc., and concludes (from study of 14 skulls) that the dogs known to the Ro- mans in Germany (6 figures) represent the following types: A small and a larger form of Canis familiarispalustris, the latter passing over to a third form resembling Canisfamiliaris intermedius,; forms resembling the mastiff and shep- herd dog types; also a sort of greyhound type.

Anthr., Stutt- gart, 1902, v, 135-18o.) This article with II figures, based on the study of 302 Dutch skulls, treats of the skull form (the distribution of the different types shows rapprochement with the Reihen- griber skulls), the relations between the cephalic index and absolute length and breadth, of length and height indices, content, etc. The height-index is of un- certain craniological value and its use causes many errors. The brachycephalic skulls exceed by a little the mesocephalic in capacity. According to cephalic in- dices the capacity-series shows two max- ima, perhaps due to race-mixture. Bourgeois (G.)

(A. p. l' Antr., Firenze, 1903, xxxIII, 17-64.) In this article, with 9 tables and 2 curves, references to literature and general arguments, Di De' Rossi shows that the data of the levy of recruits born in the years 1854-1878 indicate a continuous and positive in- crease in stature, as evidenced by the diminution in the groups of low statures, the increase in the groups of medium and high statures, the increase of the normal, medium and median stature, and the reg- ularizing of the serial curve. This in- crease in stature is probably " an effect of more precocious physical develop- ment," rather than a real augmentation of thefinal stature of the Italians. The normal, medium and median statures for recruits born in 1854-1858 are 1.625, 1.623, 1.620 meters, and for those of 1874-1878, 1.640, 1.632 and 1.629 meters. Doigneau (A.)

Under the rubrics: the elements of social life, the family and the state, property and eco- nomic questions, the author points out the importance of the data in the come- dies of Aristophanes for our knowledge of the political and social life of Athens in the fifth century B. C., and their dis- cussion by men of learning. Fischer (E.) Ein steinzeitliches H6cker- grabfeld in der NMhe von Freiburg i. Br. (Cbl. d. d. Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen, 1903, xxxIV, 20.)

(Rev. de l'Hist. d. Relig., Paris, 1903, repr. 1-16.). Treats, with references to L6ger, Zvonkof, Afanasief, Kolcin, etc., the domovbi, beings of Russian folklore more complex and diverse in origin than the Latin penates, with whom they have been compared -tthey are more than "household gods" or "ancestral spirits." They have certain relations to snakes, horses, cattle, poultry, etc., and have various human and animal forms; they are not confined to the hearth or even to the house. Some of them are doubtless of animal origin, perhaps totem- istic. Giuffrida-Ruggeri (V.) Nuovo materiale scheletrico della caverna di Isnello. (Atti d. Soc. Rom. di Antr., 1903, Ix, 5-14.) Brief account, with 2 figures, of the new osseous material of the Isnello cavern (see Amer. Anthr., 1902, N. s., IV, 77I), particularly 13 tibias and 36 femora in a fit state for measurement. The frequency of the pilaster is note- worthy ; also platymery and platycnemia. Some of these morphological phenomena may represent differences between paleo- lithic and neolithic man. - Animali totem e animali medicinali. Contributo allo studio delle superstizioni popolari in Italia. (Ibid., 161-173.) Treats of "Itotem animals" (wolf, hen, serpent, etc.) and " medicinal animals " (hen, cock, wolf, snake, viper, dog, lizard, toad) in the folklore of ancient and modern Italy. The author holds, with Reinach, that "theriolatry is intelli- gible only as the survival from a primi- tive totemism," and the same explanation suits for its last remains-- "popular superstitions" (folklore). Hoernes (M.) Das Campignien. Eine angebliche Stammform der 'neolithi- schen Kultur Westeuropas. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIII, 139-144.) R6sum6s evidence and arguments (with 24 figures) for the consideration of the so-called Campignian " culture," rep- resented especially in the prehistory of northern France, as the original form whence proceeded the neolithic culture of western Europe. The " transition- phenomena '" of Upper Italy and southern and northern France represent the rela- tions between the old native culture and the intruding real neolithic. Hofer (P.)

Manouvrier (L.) ttude sur les rapports anthropom6triques en gtn6rale et sur les principales proportions du corps. (M~m. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, I902, 3e s, II, 1-203.) Among the numerous conclu- sions (based on the study of 50 male and 50 female bodies of Parisian French), with 12 figures and 27 tables of measure- ments, are: Increase of stature generally carries with it increase of all parts of the body; the limbs and their parts increase relatively more than the bust; the arms increase relatively less than the legs and become relatively shorter-so all distal as compared with proximal parts; in tall men the hand decreases a little relatively as compared with the foot, in tall women it increases a little; generally those who have long legs have also long arms; in women, even more than in small-statured men, the limbs and their parts relative to the trunk are shorter than in men; women in general have the trunk long relative to the leg, but, with equal stature, have the bust shorter than men, but the trunk about equal. An accentuation of evolutional traits is seen in the feminine proportions of the arm and extremities (tending to become more accentuated in cities, and to appear also in man, as a result of diminution of muscular work). Martin (A.) Un vase nbolithique dans les couches alluviales de la Seine. (Rev. de l'tc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, xIII, I135-136.)

The form (a stooping woman) of the idol and its polish lead the author to look toward Egypt (through trade) as the source of this curious object, while the axes of jadeite are referred to central Asia. de Mortillet (A.) Les silex taill6s trouv6s dans les cimetiires m6rovingiens. (Rev. de l'tc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, xIII, 81-87.) Treats, with 4 figures and list of places of occurrence, of the finds of chipped flints in Merovingian graves-at this period flints seem still to have been cut for fire-flints. Of the other flints found many are accidentally present (due to former occupancy of the burial places), while others have been placed there for superstitious reasons. Much (M.) In eigener Sache.

Papillault (G.) L'homme moyen A Paris, variations suivant le sexe et suivant la taille. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1902, ve S., III, 393-526.) This valu- able monograph, with 6 figures and 36 tables of measurements, treats in detail of Ioo male and Ioo female bodies studied at the Academy of Medicine. After a general introduction on anthro- pometrical technique, etc., the author considers, from the points of view of sex and stature-differences, absolute measure- ments and proportions of trunk, pelvis, clavicle; general morphology of trunk; proportions, etc., of arms, legs, hands, feet; cranial and facial measurements, indices, etc. The average stature for males was 1674 mm., females 1564 mm.,-stature and sex exercise no in- fluence on the dorsal and lumbar curves. Stature modifies the pelvis much less than sex. The legs are relatively shorter in women (due to reduction of length of thigh by influence of pelvis,-the pro- portions of thigh and leg are little modi- fied by stature. When the arm is more developed the increase appears in the fore-arm. Breadth, height and length of head are about equally independent of stature. Cranial height is weak in woman, but considerable in children. Pech (T.) Die epische Volkspoesie an der Petschora. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIII, 156.) R6sumbs an ad- dress by N. E. Ontshukof, who traveled on the lower Petchora in 1902. From the Russian people of that region he ob- tained 89 epic songs or bylins, 15 religious songs, 44 other songs, and 50 mdrchen, and brought back with him also some 50 Mss. The bylins probably came to the Petchora with the exiles of the sixteenth to seventeenth centuries. The Syrjanians, who have lost most of their own poetry, sing bylins in broken Russian, but the Samoyeds sing them on native subjects in their own tongue. Piette (t.) Gravuredu Mas d' Azil et statu- ettesde Menton. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1902, ve s., III, 771-779.) Treats, with 4 figures, of an engraving of a simi- oid or anthropomorphic creature discov- ered in the cavern of Mas d' Azil, the pos- ture of which is such as to indicate erect carriage and use of bipedal locomotion-- the other side of the bone contains a sketch of a man and some animals (in part). Also of the ivory statuettes dis- covered at Brassempouy and Mentone. One of these,the author thinks, represents a Neanderthaloid type, with a Pharaonic head-dress. Another from Mentone fig- ures an hermaphrodite, a third a steato- pygous woman. Negroid races probably lived in Europe at the time of these statuettes. P-i Sur une gravure du Mas d'Azil. (C. R.

Detailed description, with a wealth of anthropometric data and 5 figures, of the gigantic skeleton in the Anatomical Institute of Turen, doubtless that of Giacomo Borghello of Carrega, who is noted in 1837 by Bertinatti as a Piedmontese giant, known also as the " Ligurian giant "-his body was meas- ured by Demichelis (stature 2. 16 m. as compared with Trascio 2. Io on skeleton). The cranial capacity is I9Io ccm., cephalic index 8o (head rather small considering stature). Pages 127-147 are taken up with comparisons of the measurements of other giants. The author concludes that Borghello was a real giant--" gigante, assoluto, gracile ed appartenente alla categoria dei neanio- macrosomi,"-whose extraordinary de- velopment dates from his fourteenth year. The cranial capacity shows that that ele- ment does not always vary inversely as the stature. Vram (U. G.) Crani della Carniola. (Ibid., 151-159.)

Of these 12 are doli- chocephalic, 25 mesocephalic, and 34 brachycephalic ; 5 are microcephalic in regard to cranial capacity and 13 megalo- cephalic. In the palafitta of Ig illipsoid, ovoid, and pentagonoid varieties were all found, with no traces of cremation. Weber (F.) Vorgeschichtliche Ueberreste aus Baiern in ausserbairischen Samm- lungen.

Antiq., Chicago, 1903, xxV, 178-18o.) Translated from the French by C. A. Brassler. Gold leaves of the sixth dy- nasty contain 92.3 percent gold, those those of the twelfth 90.5 percent, and those of the Persian epoch 99.8 percent. Boussac (P. H.) Les diverses esp&amp;ces de serpents dans 'Egypte antique. (Rev. Sci., Paris, 1903, 4e s., xIx, 336-340.) Treats of the kaje (naja) or asp, the pyramid scytalus, the viper and the py- thon, their representation on the ancient monuments, etc. Brunhes (M.) Les oasis du Souf et du M'zab comme types d'etablissements humains. (La Gfographie, Paris, 1902, v, 5-20, 115-195.) A good study of the desert environment which leads to a higher culture by the best use being made of unfavorable surroundings. Hu- man intelligence, industry and art are all advantaged by these adverse conditions. Cole (H.) Notes on the Wagogo of Ger- man East Africa. (J. Anth. Inst., Lond., 190o2, XXXII, 305-338.) Brief answers to the 213 questions - tribes, birth, descent, adoption, puberty (pages 3o8-3Io), marriage (pages 3IO-3I2), disease and death, murder, property and inheritance, fire (legend of fire-getting), food, hunting and fishing, agriculture, war, government, oaths and ordeals, sal- utations, arithmetic, records, measure- ment of time, games and dances, magic and divination (pages 324-327), doctrine of souls, scape-goats, demons, spirits, astronomy, traditions (frogs and rain; hyena and hare; death; hare and cha- meleon; man, lion and frog; lion and badger), sacrifice, superstitions, etc.,- of Dr J.

(Bol. Soc. de Geogr. de Lisboa, 1903, 535-761.) A general account of civil administration in the Portuguese colonies in Africa. Desplagnes (L.) Etude sur les tumuli de Killi dans la region de Goundam. (L' Anthropologie, Paris, 19o3, xIv, 151- 172.) Describes, with 37 figures, the tumuli of Killi in the Gundam region of the Niger, their contents, etc., explored 1896-190o. Among the finds were stone implements, terra-cotta pottery and figurines, iron objects, ornaments and figures of copper and bronze, beads, etc. The author concludes that the people who built these tumuli were probably those spoken of by El Bekri, an Arab writer who visited this country in 10o50 A. D. They knew the art of glazed pottery and were very artistic manufac- turers of bronze. M. Desplagnes sug- gests a Libyan or Garamantic origin. Ferraz (I.) As perolas e a sua pesca em Mogambique. (Bol. Soc. de Geogr. de Lisboa, 1903, 1-2o.) General account of pearl-fishing on the Mozambique coast. The divers always plunge head-first, naked. Garner (R. L.) Native institutions of the Ogowe tribes of west central Africa. (J. Afric. Soc., Lond., 1902, 369-380.) Treats sympathetically of the native be- lief in charms and amulets (leopard's claw, crocodile's tooth, carvings on canoes and paddles, snake venom, plant medicine, etc.), witchcraft and related ideas. The Ogowe relies on the material, not the spiritual, element of these things. An interesting account is given of the Yassi image or "primitive detective," taken by the missionaries for a mere idol, whose r6le suggests some of the procedures of the famous Lorenzo Dow. Yassi, the author thinks, is "a very use- ful and valuable institution - an active and efficient ally of law and order," for which the whites may furnish ill sub- stitutes. Gentz (Leut.) Einige BeitrAge zur Kenntnis der siidwestafrikanischen V61- kerschaften. (Globus, Brnschwg., 190o3, LXXXIIb 297-301.) Gives, with 14 figures, results of observation among the Bushmen of the Kalahari during a seven months' stay on the extreme eastern frontier of German southwestern Africa. Only such things as are not to be found in Fritsch, v. Hellwald, and Schinz, or differ from the objects noted by them are discussed. The bows are carefully made, and no arrows with steel points were found. Quiver and hunting outfit are described; also pits and traps, fire-mak- ing, domestic utensils, etc., are described and figured. The use of the bow as a musical instrument is recorded. Graf (T.) Antike Portrits. (Stzgsb. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 1903, 65.) Notes further resemblances between the author's collection of ancient portraits and the numismatic heads of the Ptolemies. Guyot (Y.) Les coutumes indig~nes de la C6te d'Ivoire. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1902, Ve S., III, 8IO-817.) R~sum6 of F. J. Clozel and R. Villa- mur's recent work on Les coutumes in- dzignes de la C0te d' Ivoire, giving the primitive pandects of the natives of the Ivory Coast of western Africa. This valuable monograph treats of civil and criminal law, judiciary organization, pro- cedure, etc. The collision between Islam and fetishism is a most interesting phenomenon. Hetherwick (A.) Fetish worship in Cen- tral Africa. (Folk-lore, Lond., 1903, xIv, 61-63.) Brief notes on Bantu fetishism, with description (plate) of an Achewa fetish-doll. Huguet (J.) Les soffs. (Rev. de l'Pc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, xIII, 94-99.) General account of soffs or "unions," "parties" among the Arabs and Berbers of Algeria, Tunis, etc. Some of the large soffs break up into secondary soffs. The r61e of the soffs in the history of Arabs and Berbers is very important. Junod (H. A.) Some remarks on the folk-lore of the Ba-thonga. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1903, xIv, 16-124.) Treats of native copper money (lirale), popular tales (English text of tale of "Men and Women of the Old Times'), amulets, superstition, divination (use of bones, shells, etc. ). The author, a missionary for seven years among the Ba-ronga, a Zulu tribe of Delagoa bay, has treated these matters more in detail in his works- Les Chants et les Contes des Ba-Ronga (Lausanne, 1897), Les Ba-Ronga (Neuchatel, 1897), etc. Klose (H.) Das Bassarivolk. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903,LXXXIII,309-314, 341- 345.) General account, with 6 figures</page><page sequence="15">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 569 of the Bassari, a primitive people of Ger- man Togoland. Physical characteristics (tall, strong, well-built), tattooing (as children), diseases, clothing (very scanty), ornament, weapons, houses, domestic life, marriage, birth, twins (if of same sex, weaker killed), illegitimate children (brought up like others), slaves (an important social factor), etc., are treated. The Bassari number some 35- 45,ooo, and by slavery and intermarriage with the Kabre, Shausho, etc., include a foreign element. Kollmann (J.) Die Graber von Abydos. (Cbl. d. d. Ges. f Anthr., Miinchen, 1902, XXXIII, II19-126.) R6sum6s, with 5 figures and bibliography, the results of recent researches in ancient Egypt, with respect to human races. The author estimates the proportionate numbers of the various types as follows: Punts IOo, Nubians 20fo, Libyans I8fo, Ethiopians (Negroes) 12 o, Pigmies 20o mtis 22 %0. We know now that the develop- ment of Egyptian civilization is not the product of a single type or of one race only, but as the result of the cooperation of several types. Variety of types within a people seems fertile for higher culture. Moggridge (L. T. ) The Nyassaland tribes, their customs and their poison ordeal. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1903, XXXII, 467- 472.) Treats of the Manganja or Amyassa, Achikunda, Ajawa, Angoni, Atonga, Angura, their religious ideas and practices. The Ajawa have puberty cer- emonies. The muavi-bark poison ordeal (drink) is believed in by all the Nyassa tribes known to the author. The old- fashioned trial is uncommon now. Muavi was much used in witchcraft trials. Moraes e Castro (J.) De Noqui ao Cu- ango, notas de viagem. (Bol. Soc. de Geogr. de Lisboa, 1903, 81-94.) Con- tains some notes on the Muchicongos, Zombos, Quicongos and Iacas, religion, medicine, dress and ornament, social functions, marriage, etc. The Muchi- congos have few idols. Their circum- cision-ceremonies are described. The habit of filing the teeth is said to affect their speech. v. Schkopp (E.) Zwergv6lker in Kam- erun. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIII, 284-285.) Brief account of the Bako, a small-statured (1.50 cm.), black, primitive tribe of the forests in the Bakoko territory of the Cameroons, probably the autocthones of the country. They are creatures of the primeval woods, and are feared by their neighbors who believe them possessed of magic powers. da Silveira Magalhies (F.) Sobre al- guns costumes de S. Thom6. (Bol. Soc. de Geogr. de Lisboa, 1903, 13-II6.) Notes from unprinted documents prior to 185O on superstitions and fetishism on the island of St. Thomas. Thorn6 (P.) Die G6tzen am Kilimand- scharo. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIII, 231-234.) Describes, with seven figures, some twelve idols of the Wajagga from Mt Kilimanjaro and the offerings made to them. Characteristic is the action of the native, who gave his nungu (idol) to the missionary with his remarks in a vain effort to get it back. All these idols are of clay, and they are in human and animal form. ASIA Adachi (B.) Ueber den Penis der Jap- aner. (Z. f. Morph. u. Anthr., Stutt- gart, 1902, v, 351-356.) Treats of dif- ferences between the penis of the Europeans and Japanese. The latter mostly have the glans perfectly uncov- ered, rarely kawakamuri (" skin cov- ered") as is the European. But the baring of the glans by secret means is almost general among Japanese. Cir- cumcision, though it may have prevailed in ancient times, is not now know in Japan. A sort of infibulation prevails among Japanese wrestlers, and a case of tattoo- ing the glans in a gambler is reported. Annandale (N.) and Robinson (H. C.) Some preliminary results of an expedi- tion to the Malay peninsula. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1902, XXXII, 407-417.) Ethnographic notes (obtained in 1901), with sketch map and plate of types. The civilized tribes considered are the Ma- layo-Siamese of the east coast states, the Malays of South Perak, Selangor, Kedah, Upper Perak, Ulu Rhaman, the Sam- sams of Trang, etc. Of uncivilized the Orang Laut Kappir of Trang, the Se- mongs, Sakais, etc. A table gives ce- phalic index, nasal index and stature of the various groups studied - in all some 400 individuals (90o from the wild tribes), nearly all males, twenty to fifty years old, were measured. The Orang Laut Kappir are to some extent forsaking their</page><page sequence="16">570 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 5, 1903 sea-faring life and settling on the islands. The Semangs are a fairly pure race, but the Sakais are of mixed Semang and Mongoloid (?) blood. The Sakais, through the opening up of the country, have recently come into contact with the Malays. The Sakais are taller than the Semangs and more dolichocephalic. Bloch (A.) Quelques remarques sur l'anthropologie des Indous exhibes au Jardin d'Acclimatation. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1902, ve s., III, 780-787.)

R6- sumbs, with 12 illustrations and portrait of Professor Hilprecht, the results of ex- plorations in 1899-1900 recorded in de- tail in Professor Hilprecht's Explorations in Bible Lands. Clement (E. W.) The new woman in Japan. (Amer. J. Soc., Chicago, 1903, viii, 693-698.) Treats of the "legal new woman," created by the new Jap- anese civil code, according to Gubbins' translation. The author considers that the improvements in her legal position will not immediately change in any great degree woman's social status in Japan. Cumont (F.) The mysteries of Mithra. (Open Court, Chicago, 1902, xvI, 65-68, 167-174, 200-208, 340-355, 449-458, 522-535.) An interesting general ac- count of the origin and spread of Mithra- ism and its invasion of Europe. Dames (M. L.) Note on Major Sykes's Gypsy vocabulary. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lend., 1902, xxxII, 350-352.) Shows that this Gypsy "language" is "rather an artificial secret dialect or jargon, such as prevails among similar tribes in India, the Changars, Doms, etc." The Indian element is less than ten percent. The grammar is based on Persian. De Morgan (J.) Note sur les ages de la pierre dans l'Asie ant&amp;rieure. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, I902, ve s., III, 708-716.) Resumes discoveries of the paleolithic and neolithic ages in Asia Minor, with particular reference to the excavations at Susa (a table of strata, cuts, etc., is given). The Susan obsidian comes from the Caucasus. The oldest Susan pottery is the finest. The Chaldean cities are built upon spots inhabited from time immemorial - every tell is historic and prehistoric. Discussion sur le crime rituel. (Ibid., 731-738.) Continued from previous number. Letters by MM. Danjou, Garnault and Girard de Rialle. See American Anthropologist, 1902, N. S., IV, 551. d'Enjoy (P.)

Most of the tribes (men, women, and children) smoke tobacco, except the Angamis, who drink rice-beer. Ghosu-El Howie (Mrs) Rock sculpture "in the West-land." (Rec. of Past, Washington, 1903, II, I40-I44.) Brief descriptions, with 3 figures, of two rock sculptures on the border of Coele-Syria, -a bull and a female warrior are the subjects, representing perhaps " Canaan- itish deities." Goldziher (I.) Der Seelenvogel im islamischen Volksglauben. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIII, 301-304.) Well-documented study of the "soul- bird " in the folklore of Islam. Among the items are: Green birds (souls of those slain in battle), little sparrows of Paradise (infants), doves (martyrs), flight of "soul-bird," plurality of soul- birds, birds as incarnation of super- mundane powers, birds as messengers of fate and of God, birds as guardians of family-honor, heralds of victory, etc. Hogarth (D. G.) Note on Major Sykes's "1Anthropological notes on southern Persia." (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1902, XXXII, 349.) Disagrees with Major Sykes's view that Bahrein taught Chaldea the arts of life.

Brief account, with 16 figures and illustrations, of the ruins of Hilar (between Harput and Diarbekir), a city situated " close to the angle where three great empires (As- syrian, Hittite, Khaldic) of antiquity met," and from which led off three chief roads. The ruins include burial caves and chambers in the rocks, cisterns, panels, carvings, etc. Laws (The) of Hammurabi, King of Babylonia. (Ibid., 67-96.) Gives, with 6 plates and editorial introduction, the English translation (introduction, text of 282 items, conclusion) of the laws of Hammurabi (2250 B. C.), King of Babylonia, who claims to have received them from the sun-god of Sippara. There are striking resem- blances between the Code of Hammurabi and the Code of Moses, and the editor observes, concerning the former, "the jurist of to-day will recognize in it most of the fundamental principles on which our social legislation is based." Martin (W. A. P.) Ancient Hankow. (Ibid., 151-152.) Brief notes, with 2 illustrations, on ancient features of Han- kow-the gate tower at Wuchang and another pagoda on the way to the Budd- hist monastery. Hankow dates back 4,300 years. Oppert (G.) Ueber Einen der Begrrbnis- pl2tze der Asche Buddhas. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIII, 225-226.) R6sum6s with 5 figures, recent literature concerning the discovery in 1898 by Pepp6 of a sarcophagus, urns and other objects,-one of the urns has an in- scription,-in the Sakya Stipa, south of Birdpurgut, which Rhys Davids has rec- ognized as genuine relics of Buddha. Peters (J. P.) Exploration of Nippur. (Ibid., 35-46.) R'sum6s, with Io illustrations and a portrait of Dr Peters, the University of Pennsylvania's explora- tions of ancient Nippur, 1889-I900oo, the chief results of which are set forth in de- tail in the author's Nippur (N. Y., 1897). Praihistorisches aus Persien. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIII, 304-305.) Brief r6sum6 of De Morgan's investiga- tions. Regnault (J.) Magie et occultisme &amp; 1' Extreme-Orient. (Rev. Sci., Paris, 1903, 4e s., XIX, 560-562.) Treats of the ma-qui or " phantoms " of Annamite belief, the kodi of the Chinese. These spirits are inimical to children, and cause many diseases. "Witch dolls" and philtres are also described. Ruge (S.) Kleinasien als Wiege der wis- senschaftlichen Erdkunde. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIII, 165-I69, 186-191.) Historico-critical argument (with appreciations of ancient geog-</page><page sequence="18">572 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S , 5, I903 raphers) that the primitive men of science of Asia Minor began the science of geography and their successors carried it on through all its phases. Its cradle was in Asia Minor, which really "lies between Europe and Asia." From the tablets of the ancient royal library of Nippur, the author concludes that in the time of Hammurabi, 2,3oo B. C., the spherical form of the earth was known to the Babylonians. Riitimeyer (L.) Die Nilgalaweddas von Ceylon. (Ibid., 201-207, 220-223, 261-267.)

The differences between the " clans" (e. g., the position of the woman during childbirth notably different with the Danigala from what it is with the Hen- nebedda) are recorded. The Veddas are recognized as high caste by the Sing- halese, although both the latter and the Tamils affect to despise them. Dr Riiti- meyer rejects the "degeneration" theory of the origin of Veddas, who for more than 2000 years have been practically as they now are. Stenz (G. M.) General Tschan-t'chien, ein chinesischer Forschungsreisender des zweiten Jahrhunderts. (Ibid., 293-294.) Brief account of Shan-shien, a Chinese general, who, on an embassy from the Emperor Wu-ti ( 141-86 B. C.), traveled to the Yio-chi on the Oxus. He returned with a wonderful story of the civilization of the Bactrian-Greek cities, and the commercial intercourse thus stimulated was of much benefit to China. Sykes (P. M.) Anthropological notes on southern Persia. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1902, XXXII, 339-349.) Treats, with one figure, of bronze objects from Khina- man, near Kerman, the Brahui and Baluchi and the Persian Gypsies (known by various names). On pages 345-349 is given a Gypsy vocabulary- Persian text, transliteration, and English words. These Gypsies, whose language is called Gurbati, number some Ioo,ooo in all Persia. Major Sykes thinks that the Bahrein region was the seat of an an- cient Phoenician civilization. Thurston (E. T.) Some marriage cus- toms in southern India. (Madras Gov. Mus., Bull., 1903, Iv, 129-179. ) Val- uable detailed r6sum6 of information concerning marriage forms and cere- monies in southern India. Treats, with two plates, of Brihman marriages, mar- riages among the Khonds, Sauras, Bad- agas, tribes of Vizagapatam, Ganjam, Malabar, Arcot, Coorg, Nairs, Telugu, Canarese, Kallans, Goundans, Lam- bidis, Kotas, Kurumbas, Todas, Malas, Komatis, Urilis, Rajputs, Kuravans, Tottiyans, etc. All stages of the de- velopment of marriage seem represented here, including mock-marriages, substi- tutional child-marriages, etc. The es- sential and binding parts of the cere- mony differ much. - Deformity and mutilation. (Ibid., 180-201.) Treats, with one plate, of nostril and ear piercing and dilatation, tattooing, teeth chipping and filing, cir- cumcision, cutting off fingers, castration, branding, etc., among the various peo- ples of southern India. - Urlis, Sh6lagasandIrulas. (Ibid., 202-213.) Gives, with three plates (types), ethnographic notes, with some anthropometric data (height, form of nose), on the Ufralis of the jungles of Dimbhum in the Coimbatore district; the more primitive Shn1agas of the Mi- pore frontier; and the Irulas of Chingle- put, fifty miles from Madras. All these tribes are of uniformly short stature (1.59 in.) but differ in nasal index. Emergence from the jungle and "civili- zation " seem to reduce platyrrhiny. - Fire-walking in Ganjam. (Ibid., 214-216.) Records an account by Magistrate Partridge of a fire-walk on the night of October 6, I902, at Nuva- g6de, by a priest of the village goddess in connection with the Dassera festival. Native feet are not very ticklish. - Some forms of corporal punishment in vernacular schools. (Ibid., 217- 222.) Brief description of forty-two varieties of punishment, from notes sup- plied by native correspondents in southern India. Many of these evince human in- genuity in the way of torture. Never- theless there is a Tamil proverb that</page><page sequence="19">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 573 " the schoolmaster will attain the abode of Vishnu (bliss), and the doctor will go to hell." Wake (C. S.) The Kauravas of the Hindu Puranas. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1903, xxv, 175-177.) Discusses the claim of the modern Kaurs or Kauravas of Chota Nagpur to be the Kauravas mentioned in the Puranas. INDONESIA, AUSTRALASIA, POLYNESIA Alsberg (M.) Ueber die iSltesten Spuren des Menschen in Australien. (Cbl. d. d. Ges. f. Anthr., Mtinchen, 1902, xxxIII, 162-163.) Brief description of a sandstone block found in 1898 at a depth of 54 feet in a quarry near Warmambool, Victoria, containing the impress of the buttocks of two persons sitting together, the footsteps, also tracks of the emu, the dingo, etc. These could have been made only when the stone was in the form of soft sea-sand. If genuine these remains are the oldest human relics in Australia and go back perhaps to pliocene times. Born (Hr.) Einige Bemerkungen Uiber Musik, Dichtkunst und Tanz der Yapleute. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1903, xxxv, 134-142.) Treats, with 2 figures, of music, song, dance, etc., among the natives of Yap in the Caroline archi- pelago. Their instrument is a bamboo flute. In the dance-song everything in life finds expression. Poetry has a material value and is bought and sold. There are also beautiful prose tales (that of the dolphin is given in translation on page 137). The poetic language differs much from ordinary speech. The sexes dance apart. Dance rehearsals la st months, the inventor and poet leading. The medicine-man brings his art to aid. Dances are of two sorts-obscene and not obscene,-of the former, the kuthiol of the women is more obscene than any of the men's dances. v. Bilow (W.) Der vulkanische Aus- bruch auf der Insel Savaii, Deutsch- Samoa. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIII, IO8-I09.) Contains a few notes on the action of the natives towards earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Doherty (D. J.) The Tagalog language. (Educ. Rev., N. Y., 1902, xxIv, 497- 502.) General sketch (apparently after Miles) with brief bibliography. The author considers the Filipinos as a race superior to the Chinese. Dores (R.)

Duckworth (W. L. H. ) and Taylor (A. E.) The craniology of the natives of Rotuma. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1902, XXXII, 432-444.) Treats, with 2 plates, 4 figures, 4 tables of measure- ments and detailed descriptions, of 9 crania from the island of Rotuma, ob- tained by Mr J. S. Gardiner in 1897,- all male except two. Of these skulls 6 are assigned to the typical western Polynesian type, one is typically Mel- anesian and two mixed, these facts re- flecting the situation of the island. One skull is thought to show "Mongoloid" features. Giglioli (E. H.) Testa monumentale singolarissima da Rononga, Isole Salo- mone. (A. p. 1'Antr., Firenze, 19o3, xxxIII, 81-84.) Describes, with 2 fig- ures, a batu, or memorially preserved and "built up" head from Ronongo in the central Solomon group, now in the author's collection. These batu are rare -Giglio knew only four (one at Sydney, two at Oxford, one in an English private collection) beside his own. Haggard (A. H.) The Fijian fire-walk. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1902, xIv, 87-89.) Brief account of fire-walk as witnessed August 23, 1902, at Suva, Vita Levu. Hey (N.) and Roth (W. E.) An ele- mentary grammar of the Nggerikudi language. (N. Queensl. Ethnogr. Bull. No. 6, Brisbane, April, 1903, 1-23.) A valuable section of this useful sketch of the Nggerikudi tongue of the Queensland coast is the lists of nouns, with their various meanings, etymologies, etc., which are psychologically important, things in general, parts of body, body as a whole, objective and subjective sensa- tions, family relationships, animals and plants, inanimate nature, manufactured articles, etc. On page 23 are given texts of three aboriginal songs. Some of the transferred meanings are very interesting, e. g., ade, " labor pains," originally "a young plant lifting the ground before its</page><page sequence="20">574 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 5, 1903 appearance." On page 8 is a list of 43 species of mollusca " all put to economic uses," and on page 9 another of 49 eco- nomically used plants. Lightning is called "'semen-emission. ' Holmes (J.) Initiation ceremonies of na- tives of the Papuan gulf. (J. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1902, xxxII, 418-425.) Rather detailed account, with one plate (bullroarer, rain-gods, dance-belts, Oro- kolo men) of customs and ceremonies as- sociated with initiation among the tribes of the Elema district of New Guinea. The boy, who from birth to ten years is siare, becomes at ten siare sora till he enters the eraro (men's house) for seclu- sion and initiation; he is then a heava (the boys altogether being malai-asu) and undergoes many taboos. The next stage is heapu, which has certain severe tests with less seclusion (a curious use of urine is noted). The last stage is semese, in which the mysteries of the "bull- roarer" are divulged, which are to be kept from the women. Sorcery also fig- ures in these ceremonies. Feasts accom- pany each stage. Notes on the religious ideas of the Elema tribe of the Papuan gulf. (Ibid., 426-431.) Treats of reverence for cer- tain objects (any animal of this sort is called ualare for the individual), feasts, spirit-lore and future life, dreams, gods as distinguished from spirits, the "su- preme god," Harisu, the creator, Ualare, evil deities, etc. Loria (L.) I1 matrimonia nei villaggi del basso San Giuseppe, Nuova Guinea Britannica. (A. p. l'Antr., Firenze, 1903, xxxIII, 85-96.) Describes in detail, with 2 plates, the forms of mar- riage in vogue in Innawi, a village of British New Guinea,-the chief are "marriage "by purchase" (the most honorable and ambitious) and by flight; the second is called amange pa inaoga, "stolen wedding," the first, pa an- giawa. For a double marriage of brothers and sisters from two families a special term, ngami onge avaya, is em- ployed. Marriage by flight is not marriage by rapt, for the consent of the bride is given. Marriage by rapt of widows, is, however, practised. Chil- dren are sometimes promised in marriage by their parents. Adultery and divorce are also noticed. Myers (C. S.) The visual acuity of the natives of Sarawak. (J. of Physiol., Lond., 1902, xxvIII.) The measure- ments of 32 individuals give about I Y/ times "normal" acuity. Taking all things into consideration, it is probable that the black race (Rivers' Torres Straits natives gave 3 times normal) exceeds the yellow and white in visual acuity. Raap (H.) Reisen auf der Insel Nias bei Sumatra. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIII, 149-154, 171-178.) Describes, with 27 figures, visits to North and South Nias in 1897. Ancestral and other idols, musical instruments, weapons and armor, ornaments, villages, government, slave- trade, burial, commerce, etc., are treated. Head-hunting, a custom dying out in North Nias, flourishes in South Nias. The fresh head of a South Nias native was obtained by the author and is now in the Museum in Braunschweig. The art- sense of the Niasians is expressed in the ornamentation, etc., of their weapons. Sarasin (P. u. F.) Ueber die Toila von Siid-Celebes. (Ibid., 277-281.) De- scribes, with 3 figures, the Toala of the mountainous region of South Celebes, a small statured, primitive race of men (av. height 1575 mm., Veddas I576), with wavy hair, darker-skinned than the Buginese, from whom they differ entirely. Their religious and cosmogonical ideas are cited. The Tola, who were formerly cave-dwellers, are the true autocthones of Celebes, and the discoveries of the brothers Sarasin are of great anthropo- logical importance. They tend to confirm Kollmann's theory of the former wide- extension of small-statured races of man. Some of the stone arrowheads of the Toala are very small and fine. Seligmann (C. G.) A note on albinism, with special reference to its racial char- acteristics among Melanesians and Poly- nesians. (Lancet, Lond., 1902, CLXIII, 803-805.) Treats, with illustrations, the occurrence of partial albinism (rare among Melanesians) and leucoderma (common in New Guinea, Torres Sts, etc.) Albinism seems to occur in certain families or family-groups; in Yam was found a family in which it occurred in 3 generations. The physical and physio- logical accompaniments of albinism are noted. - The medicine, surgery and midwifery of the Sinangolo. (J. Anthr. Inst.,</page><page sequence="21">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 575 Lond., 1902, XXXII, 297-304.) Treats, with one plate (tattooing and childbirth) and one figure (tattooing) of medical ideas concerning malaria, dysentery, leuco- derma, ringworm (recently introduced), arthritis, rheumatism, yaws, urethritis and their treatment; surgery in connection with burns, fractures, hemorrhage, snake- bite; conception and pregnancy, child- birth, abortion, menstruation (the legend attributing menses to the moon is given), etc. Taboos during pregnancy are noted. Many things are attributed to sorcery. Tattooing is much used in medicine. Invalids are never isolated. There are no midwives. Difficult labors are uncom- mon and abnormal presentations rare. The Sinangolo are an inland tribe of the Rigo district of British New Guinea. Siedel (H.) Die deutschen Salamo-Inseln sonst undjetzt. (Ibid., 181-186.) Geo- graphical-historical sketch with map of the German islands of the Solomon group, with some notes (pages 185-186) on the natives and their contact with Europeans.

Indian society of false-faces. (The Papoose, N. Y., 1903, I, No. 7, I-Io.) Reprinted, with illustrations, from the Ontario Archaological Report. Chervin (A.) Cranes, pointes de fl&amp;che en silex et instruments de peche proven- ant de la baie d' Antofagasta. Momies des hauts plateaux de la Bolivie. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1902, ve S., III, 700-708.) Describes four skulls (three male, one female, one child) found by M. Senechal de la Grange on the shores of Antofagasta bay, Bolivia, and presented to the society by him, also another skull said to be that of the famous Atahualpa, last of the great Incas; some fine arrowpoints from the graves, a number of wooden harpoons with flint points on bone hooks, a few mirror frames, etc. More important than the last are two mummies (male, female), with which were found several flint tools,- the woman was a miner. The five skulls are reproduced on page 706. All are brachycephalic. It is interesting to learn that in the mines of Huanchaca labor 7,000 Indians, whom M. S6nechal de la Grange is about to study. Dixon (R. B.) System and sequence in Maidu mythology. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1903, xvI, 32-36.) Notes the existence in the mythic history of the northeastern Maidu of California "1so clear and definite a sequence of events that one is tempted to regard the whole as a unit and to see in it an epic of no little power." The cycle of the northwestern Maidu has also a notable system and sequence. Each cycle possesses a certain literary charm and power, but the cycles themselves would seem, at least in their latter portions, to follow one another." Dr Dixon's brief study is a desirable ad- dition to the literary criticism of Ameri- can Indian mythology. DuBois (C. G.) Manzanita basketry, a revival. (The Papoose, N. Y., 1903, I, No. 7, 21-27.) Brief account, with two full-page illustrations and 6 figures, of the revival of the art of basketry among the Dieguefio Indians of Manza- nita, California, stimulated by the eastern demand for its products. Eels (M.) The decrease of the Indians. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1903, xxv, 145-149.) Author concludes that "the Indians on or near Puget Sound have de- creased immensely within 40 or 50 years." Reasons for this are : The vices of civili- zation (drink, licentiousness, diseases), half-civilization (clothing, housekeeping changed). Eskimomusik. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIII, 138-139.) Reproduces, with author's account, text and music of 4 songs from the section on " Eskimo Music " of Dr Robert Stein's The White World (N.

Treats of the ideas of the heavens (male, female powers), "father Tirawa" ; star-craziness, morning-star and its ceremonies, and sacrifices; the seven winds and their names, Ursa Major and other star-figures. The religious lore of the Pawnees is among the most interesting matter hitherto obtained from the American aborigines. Forstemann (E.) Zwei Mayahieroglyphen. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIII, 95- 98.) Discusses, with 8 figures, two Maya hieroglyphs, one of which has been considered hitherto to represent the " death bird," the other the mythic bird, moan (it resembles the day sign cib). The author argues for the identity of the two glyphs, as they occur in the Dresden codex. - Zusammenhang zweier Inschriften von Palenque. (Ibid., 281-284.) Dis- cusses the relation between the inscrip- tions of the two temples of the cross (I and II) at Palenque. Both, F"rste- mann thinks, date from the year 1498 A.

Die Guaikuri-Gruppe. (Mitt. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 1903, XXXIII, I- 128. ) This valuable and elaborate mon- ograph treats, with 2 maps, of the no- menclature of the Indian tribes, Guay- curi, Mbayh, Cadiueo, Kinikinao, Toba, Pilag~i, Aguilot, Mocobi, Abipone, Pay- agui, Lengua, Guachi, their past and present condition, etc. Pages 41-85 contain Abipone, Guachi, Cadiu6o, Kin- ikinao, Lengua, Mbayi, Mocobi, Pay- aguA and Toba vocabularies.

Lawson (P. V.) Summary of the arch- eology of Winnebago county, Wisconsin. (Wisc. Archeol., Milwaukee, 1903, II, 4o-85.) Valuable summary (in all sixty-two locations ) of information con- cerning the Indian mounds, village sites, cemeteries, shell-heaps, fortifications, embankments, "corn-hills," "kitchen- holes," in the various towns of the county, with map and seven figures. The author estimates the number of aborig- inal artifacts (clay, stone, copper, iron, shell, bone) obtained from the Indian village sites, mounds, cemeteries, etc., of Winnebago county, at 6o,ooo. In historic times this region has been occu- pied by the Winnebago, Fox and Meno- mini Indians. Here the Iroquois of New York, as allies of the French, fought the Foxes. Lumholtz (C.)

The old drum still survives in many parts of the country. Spondylus shells were used as " cymbals." Flutes are discussed with some detail. The shell and the terra-cotta trumpet were known. The tinya (a sort of guitar) is post-Columbian; there is no evidence of aboriginal stringed instruments in an- cient Peru. The Peruvian scale is rather uncertain. Merriam (C. H.) Some little-known basket materials. (Science, N. Y., 1903, N. S., xvII, 826.) Identifies two materials extensively used by certain Indian tribes of California - Cladium mariscus, and the unpeeled root of the tree yucca (Yucca arborescens). The materials used in combination with these are briefly noted. By selection of the varying yucca root "Isome of the Indian women produce beautiful shaded effects and definite pattern contrasts." The Panamint Shoshones vary the color of the Scirpus root by burying it in wet ashes. Reprinted in The Papoose (N. Y.), 19o3, I, 14-16. Mochi (A.) I popoli dell' Uaup6 e la famiglia etnica Miranha. (A. p. I'Antr., Firenze, 1903, xxxIII, 97-13o.) This second section, with two figures, treats of social organization (the ethnic unit is the "people "), the " clan" does not exist; if any, the vague name of " group" must be used; chiefs (local) and their insig- nia; primitive aristocracy; government (oligarchical rather than monarchical); crime and punishment (secret poisoning for private ends is not rare; marriage (largely monogamous and more often exogamous, but with no formal prescrip- tion; marriage by rapt also survives; a "test-period " of about a year precedes real marriage, which is indissoluble); the couvade (here present in marked form) ; " invocation" of demons at bap- tizing of children; infanticide; puberty and its treatment, etc. Monumentos (Los) arqueologicos de Can- tona.

Discusses, with 5 figures, the ancient Mexican ideas of sin and punish- ment, their symbolical representation, etc. Sacrilege and offenses against the state were punished by the gods-leprosy, sex- ual diseases, gout, skin diseases, dropsy, were sent by Tezcatlipoca. Fornication was reckoned a sin. Slaves were re- garded as sinners-all misfortunes were attributed to sin or to the sinful nature of man. The realms of the dead and the S"sinning gods" are also treated, to- gether with the symbolism of pulque in connection with the sin of drunkenness.

Die Korrecturen der Jahres- lnge und der Lange der Venusperiode in den mexikanischen Bilderschriften. (Ibid., 27-49.) Treats, with 15 fig- ures, of the correction of the year's length and of the length of the Venus- period in the old Mexican MSS., the Codex Nuttall in particular. Seler con- cludes that the MSS. show that "*82 Mexican years of 365 days are really 20 days less 3 hours, 18 minutes, 59.1698 seconds shorter than 82 real years" - hence an intercalation of twenty days after 82 years would about set matters right. This period of 82 years has no relation to the Venus-period. The cor- rection of the Venus-period was made by subtracting a Mexican year minus four days every 88 years. Seler considers that the astronomical data in the Codex Nutall/ bring the creators of the culture represented by it up to the Maya peoples and point to a community of culture. -- Las excavaciones en Mexico.

G.) Mohegan traditions of muhkeahwzeesug, "the little men." (The Papoose, N. Y., 1903, I, No. 7, I I-4.) R6sum6s the traditions of the Mohegans of Connecticut, as related by one of their number at the present time, concerning the "little men," who pre- ceded them in this part of the country. The author inclines to believe with these Indians that "the east central part of Connecticut has seen, within the last three hundred years, the passing away of a race that may have been somewhat akin to the Mound-builders."

The author concludes that "' the date of burial is to be determined by the length of time elapsed since the spreading of the Iowan loess, which, compared with the age of the Kansan drift seen scantily spread on the high- lands, was an event much nearer the end than the commencement of the glacial period."
