Everhart University of Texas at Dallas Patricia Rucker Dempsey Central North Carolina School for the Deaf Recent studies have shown that deaf children are as competent as hearing peers in manual, versus oral, production of nonliteral language, although not in the produc tion or comprehension of nonliteral (written) English. But, apparently, hearing moth ers and teachers use less nonliteral English in their signing to deaf children than in their speaking to hearing children. In this study, the nonliteral content of stories told by signing deaf mothers, speaking hearing mothers, and signing or speaking native bilingual/bimodal hearing mothers was examined. The two hearing groups produced similar amounts of nonliteral content, whereas the deaf mothers produced more in their sign language productions than hearing mothers did in spoken productions or bilingual mothers did in either signed or spoken productions. These findings suggest that nonliteral sign language production plays as central a role in the sign language of deaf adults as it does in the sign language of deaf children and in spoken and written language. The development of nonliteral language skills by deaf and hearing children and the language of deaf and hearing mothers directed to deaf and hearing children have been of considerable interest in recent years to linguists, psycholinguists, and developmental psychologists (see MacKay This project was supported in part by NINCDS grants R01-NS20064 and K04-NS01267 to M.

In the research described here, a topic at the intersection of these two domains is examined: the use of nonliteral or nonconventionalized language in child-directed language productions of deaf and hearing mothers. Nonliteral is operationally defined here in a general sense, incorpo rating both figurative language ("frozen" or novel) and other creative devices that go beyond conventional, literal language production. De vices sometimes considered nonverbal, such as pantomime and gesture, also are included under this rubric because of their potentially important role as an alternative or supplementary means of communication outside of literal statement (Marschark &amp; McNeill, submitted; McNeill, 1985; McNeill, Levy, &amp; Pedelty, 1990). One question addressed in this study is whether the relatively high frequency of nonliteral sign language previously observed in deaf chil dren, relative to both their own written productions (Everhart &amp; Mar schark, 1988) and their hearing peers' oral productions (Marschark &amp; West, 1985; Marschark, West, Nail, &amp; Everhart, 1986), is a function solely of deaf children's lack of literal sign language fluency (e.g., Sallop, 1980), or is an aspect of linguistic competence as important to sign lan guage as it is to spoken language (e.g., Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980; Ortony, 1975; cf. Blackwell, Engen, Fischgrund, &amp; Zarcadoolas, 1978; Conley, 1976). Although nonliteral constructions have been shown to be an inte gral part of "art sign" in deaf adults (e.g., Klima &amp; Bellugi, 1979) and are frequently used by teachers of hearing children (Petrie, 1979), the extent to which nonliteral language is used in less formal language interactions is still unclear. Another related goal of this research concerns the nature of linguistic interactions between deaf or hearing adults and deaf children. In particu lar, this study provides the first formal evaluation of the extent to which mothers use nonliteral sign language in communicating with deaf chil dren (but see informal observations of Maestas y Moores, 1980). Adult language to children generally is adapted to the presumed linguistic capa bilities of the listener (e.g., Furrow, Nelson, &amp; Benedict, 1979; Newport, 1977), thereby facilitating communication. The use of figurative language and other nonliteral devices has been shown to be an essential compo nent in such interactions (Marschark &amp; Nail, 1985; Ortony, 1975; Petrie, 1979). A lack of flexibility in adults' literal or nonliteral sign language directed to deaf children thus would likely impede their linguistic, social, and educational interactions.</page><page sequence="3">Language Productions A tendency toward oversimplification and informational inadequacy in bimodal communication between hearing and deaf adults and deaf children indeed has been well-documented in tasks designed to tap the effectiveness of adult-child referential communication (e.g., MacKay Soroka et al., 1987, 1988). Such deficiencies also have been observed in studies of the classroom interactions of hearing teachers of the deaf and their students (Marmor &amp; Petitto, 1979; Newton, 1985) and the informal interactions of hearing mothers with their young deaf children (Swisher, 1984). Moreover, with regard to the present study, Swisher (1984) found use of colloquial language to be "notably absent" in the bimodal produc tions of the mothers that she observed. This literalness might not be surprising from a sample that for the most part had only beginning compe tence in sign language as a second language. In fact, the use of literal and concrete language in the home as well as in school likely contributes significantly to deaf children's apparent concreteness and cognitive in flexibility in a variety of tasks (e.g., Marschark, 1988; Ottem, 1980). Newton (1985) explictly studied some of the nonliteral language used by teachers of the deaf. She examined the use of indirect requests (e.g., "You could bring me the scissors") and English idioms (e.g., "He flew the coop") in the classroom language of teachers of deaf children using either spoken language only or using Simultaneous Communication (SC). Both groups were compared to teachers of hearing children. Al though the frequency of nonliteral language was about the same for teach ers of oral deaf and hearing students, its use was markedly reduced, in both speech and sign, in teachers using SC. This finding suggests that teachers of manual deaf children are not adequate nonliteral language models for their students, and thus provides a partial explanation for the marked lack of nonliteral English by those children in academic settings (Blackwell et al., 1978; Everhart &amp; Marschark, 1988; see also, Pol I io &amp; Pollio, 1974). Newton's (1985) study, however, has three relevant limitations. First, she reported only the use of English idiomatic language produced in sign or speech. While using fewer English idioms, her teachers nonethe less may have used nonliteral sign language devices as frequently as teachers of hearing children used idiomatic speech. This possibility may be somewhat diminished in that the SC teachers were rated only as good or above average signers (Newton, 1985; p. 339) rather than fluent, an unfortunate but common situation in schools for the deaf. Second, Newton's (1985) criteria for idiomatic language apparently included only frozen constructions, those that have become part of the language by their frequent use. These comprised a broad variety of con structions ranging from nonprimary word meanings (e.g., It got stuck;</page><page sequence="4">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY That's kind of funny; He made up the answer), that are learned as accept able English units, to nonliteral phrases (e.g., sink or swim, How are you?) of varying degrees of figurativeness (Newton, 1985, p. 344). Still unclear, therefore, is whether the language directed at deaf children contains the diversity of novel nonliteral constructions typically observed in the lan guage of deaf and hearing children (Marschark et al., 1986; Vosniadou, 1987). Third, Newton compared the language directed at deaf school-aged children (ages 5 years 11 months to 9 years 3 months) with that directed at hearing preschoolers (ages 2 years 4 months to 3 years). To the extent that primary school teachers and teachers of the deaf, in particular, might intentionally or unintentionally focus on concrete, literal language (Mar schark, 1988; Watts, 1979), the apparent SC versus speech difference observed by Newton may be, in fact, an artifact of the age groups involved. In contrast to Newton's (1985) findings with hearing adults, there have been several recent demonstrations that, when they are evaluated in terms of their nonliteral sign language production, deaf children of both deaf and hearing parents have a far greater nonliteral competence than is revealed by tests of nonliteral English comprehension (e.g., Everhart &amp; Marschark, 1988; Marschark &amp; West, 1985; Marschark et al., 1986; cf. Blackwell et al., 1978; Conley, 1976; King &amp; Quigley, 1985). Such results indicate that the oft-noted concreteness of deaf children in school related tasks may not be indicative of a more general cognitive inflexibil ity (cf. Furth, 1973) but is, at least in part, a function of the English-based evaluation of a group that does not have English as a native language. (Note that English is used here generically to refer to any spoken or written language of the hearing community. Nonliteral sign language refers both to constructions with familiar English translations and those specific to sign language.) In the present study, the previous work concerning the content of deaf child-directed language by deaf and hearing adults and that concerning the nonliteral content of sign language was extended. Here, a group of deaf women signed stories and a group of hearing women told stories in English. A group of hearing women who had been exposed to sign language from birth by their deaf parents told stories in each mode. If previous work with children (e.g., Marschark &amp; West, 1985; Marschark et al., 1986) general izes to adults, the deaf women would be expected to produce more nonliteral language in sign than their hearing counterparts would produce orally. If Newton's (1985) results generalize to nonliteral productions other than English idioms, it would be expected that the "bilingual" women (corresponding to her SC teachers), would produce fewer nonliteral con structions in sign than the hearing, monolingual women would in speech.</page><page sequence="5">Language Productions In a broad sense, comparison of the bilingual women's signed and spoken stories with those of deaf and hearing women, respectively, also provides some insight into the locus of the previous findings with chil dren. That is, one possible explanation of the previous results is that sign language simply provides more opportunity for nonliteral production than does spoken English, regardless of the language user (but see Ortony's 1975 discussion of the central role of nonliteral devices in language). If true, the bilingual women would be expected to produce more nonliteral constructions in their signed stories than in their oral stories, just as the stories of the deaf women would contain more nonliteral constructions than those of the nonsigning, hearing women. One other feature of this study was the requirement that the women produce stories for children of two different ages. The social editing of maternal speech for hearing children has been examined in a variety of studies (e.g., Newport, 1977), although social editing of nonliteral or figurative content has not been examined. It appears possible that women use more nonliteral language either to younger children to make more likely the successful communication of complex ideas (Petrie, 1979), or to older children because of their perceived greater abilities to compre hend language. METHOD Subjects The participants were 11 deaf women; 11 nonsigning, hearing (henceforth hearing) women; and 9 native-signing, hearing (henceforth bilingual) women. All were paid, middle-class volunteers from central North Carolina who were unaware of the purposes of the study. The one deaf woman who did not have children worked with children in a residen tial school for the deaf. Her data were entirely consistent with those of the deaf mothers and were included in all analyses. All of the other women were mothers, and the majority of those in each group worked outside the home, primarily in educational settings. In particular, all but one each of the deaf mothers and bilingual mothers worked in occupations that re quired sign language use on a daily basis (e.g., as interpreters, teachers or teachers' aides in schools for the deaf). Although precise information concerning the degree or etiology of deafness was not obtained from the deaf mothers, they all had hearing mothers, were deaf at least from early childhood, and had hearing losses severe enough that sign language was their primary means of communica</page><page sequence="6">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY tion. All had attended residential schools for the deaf. The bilingual moth ers were all children of deaf parents who were raised from birth using sign language as the primary means of communication with their parents. None of the other hearing mothers had any knowledge of sign language. Design and Procedure The participants were tested individually, either at home, at a school for the deaf, or in a comfortable laboratory room. They initially were told that the study was an investigation of the age differences in children's story comprehension for which hearing-status appropriate, videotaped stories were needed. The hearing and deaf mothers provided stories orally and in sign, respectively, whereas the bilingual mothers provided two stories in each mode. In all cases, one story in each pair was to be for a 4-year-old audience and one for a 10-year-old audience. "Live" child audiences were not used for practical purposes, but previous research on maternal social editing has shown that language productions are comparable with and without children actually present in such situations (e.g., Snow, 1972). In all cases, story theme and age of the intended audience were counterbalanced with order, and for the bilinguals, mode of production was also counterbalanced to control for possible practice or fatigue ef fects. For one story, the subjects were asked to make up a story about awakening one morning to find that all of the people and animals had exchanged social roles. For the other, they were asked to devise a story about discovering an underground civilization, never before seen by hu mans (i.e., the themes from Marschark &amp; West, 1985). In both cases, they were asked to describe what would happen and what the people and places would be like. The women were told that their stories could be of any length, and the bilingual mothers were told that no similarity between their signed and oral stories was necessary. Most of the mothers, including all of the deaf mothers, were tested by advanced but nonnative signers who used sign in communicating with the deaf mothers. Selection of nonnatively signing experimenters was intended to make this study comparable to previous ones involving children in a similar task. Looking ahead, however, it is clear that experimenters fluent in American Sign Language (ASL) likely would have only increased the nonliteral content of deaf mothers' stories, if anything (see Marschark &amp; West, 1985), and so this aspect of the method does not qualify any of the present findings.</page><page sequence="7">Language Productions The particular sign language system used by the deaf and bilingual women was not prescribed by the experimenters. In fact, all used the type of pidgin sign common when deaf adults are signing to anyone other than their own children or other native-signing adults. Both deaf and bilingual women were observed to mouth words during their stories, but rarely vocalized aloud. Scoring The categories of nonliteral constructions used to score the language productions of both deaf and hearing participants were: (a) novel figura tive language (or trope), (b) frozen trope, (c) frozen gesture, (d) supplemen tal gesture, (e) pantomime, (f) linguistic modification, (g) linguistic inven tion, and (h) lexical substitutions. Note that idiom in the sense used by Newton (1985) is a broad term that can include novel and frozen trope, linguistic inventions, and linguistic modifications as well as other con structions that are so frozen that they no longer would be classified as nonliteral in most contexts (e.g., How are you?; It's called a poodle, Newton, 1985; p. 344). A brief description of each category is provided in the Appendix. More detailed descriptions of the classification system, the bases for the categories, and scoring procedures can be found in Barlow, Kerlin, and Pol I io (1970) and Marschark, Everhart, Martin, and West (1987). (See Marschark and McNeill, submitted, for additional discussion of Catego ries 3 through 5.) A nationally certified, professional interpreter, unaware of the pur poses of the study, transcribed the videotaped stories of the deaf mothers and the signed stories of the bilingual mothers. Translations were done literally, except that signed tropes were "glossed" as their intended mean ing (e.g., BORED signed with index fingers simultaneously waving toward the mouth and one ear). In preparing transcripts, English gloss (indicated here by capital letters) was applied to the productions, sign-for-sign, omit ting functors and auxiliaries unless explicitly signed. Directional (implied pronoun) signs (e.g., PAST l-GIVE-YOU) and other sign morphemes were glossed and included in the "word" counts as they would be spoken (e.g., I GAVE YOU = 3 words). The decision to score transcribed "words" rather than morphemes or other units was made, in part, to be consistent with previous studies of hearing and deaf children's nonliteral language. However, the choice also was determined by several other considerations that would create difficulties for comparing English and sign. First, several morphemes in sign are frequently implied, so that, for</page><page sequence="8">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY example, when signing about a past event, the PAST morpheme need not be appended to each verb as it is in English, but the past is still under stood. Second, whereas morphemes in speech are essentially transparent (e.g., dancing = dance + &lt;present progressive&gt;), the same sign fre quently will be understood in alternative ways (e.g., DANCE versus DANCING) only in terms of its context. Third, and perhaps most cen trally, fundamental differences between sign language and speech gener ally create difficulty (and complaints) in any attempt to compare them, regardless of the unit of measure. Using words as simple, scoreable idea units seemed to us and our informants the least biased approach, and there is no reason a priori to believe that such scoring would create an artifact in any particular direction. Nonetheless, scoring in some other unit, such as morphemes, might be more useful for other purposes. Audiotapes of the hearing mothers' stories and the bilingual mothers' oral stories were made from their videotapes and were used to transcribe their stories word-for-word. All videotapes (with transcripts) then were examined by the first two authors for nonliteral constructions, according to the categories noted earlier. Any ambiguous or unfamiliar sign se quences were discussed with local native signers to determine whether they were regular occurrences in the language or novel constructions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Reliability To verify scoring reliability among the (highly experienced) scorers, one author scored all of the tapes, and randomly delineated a paragraph like passage from each story for independent scoring by another author. The reliability analysis was then based on all of the sentence-like units in those passages containing nonliteral constructions, scored by either rater, and the sentence-like unit immediately following each. For all Modality x Group conditions, this procedure yielded over 90% agreement on classifi cations of literal versus nonliteral and over 95% agreement on scoring the nonliteral sequences according to the categories listed earlier. Scoring disagreements then were resolved in conference, and the tapes were reex amined to correct any related scoring errors. In our previous research, scoring also has been done by deaf and hearing native signers. However, those informants tended to be more liberal in their scoring of nonliteral constructions than the investigators, and we have retained our more conser vative methods.</page><page sequence="9">Language Productions Analyses Because of the relatively small number of subjects, the statistical analyses of all results were performed using nonparametric statistics: Mann-Whitney U tests for (nonzero) between-subjects comparisons and Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks tests (corrected for ties) for within-subjects com parisons (Daniel, 1978). Given the difficulty in obtaining significance for differences observed in small samples, this method ensured that any reli able differences obtained could be considered real. Unless otherwise noted, the alpha level was set at .05; all and only those differences cited were reliable at or beyond that level. Analyses of the lengths of the stories produced in the several condi tions revealed that although the deaf mothers produced significantly longer stories for 10-year-olds than 4-year-olds (173 vs. 126 transcribed words, respectively), the 4- versus 10-year-old comparison was not reli able for either the hearing mothers (618 vs. 639, respectively) or among the bilingual mothers in sign (168 vs. 132, respectively) or orally (131 vs. 285, respectively). The failure of these latter comparisons to reach signifi cance reflects the considerable variability within each group. Hearing mothers produced significantly longer stories than did deaf mothers for both 4-year-olds and 10-year-olds as well as overall. Bilingual mothers produced reliably longer oral (285) than signed (132) stories for 4-year-olds but not for 10-year-olds (131 vs. 168, respec tively) or overall (208 vs. 150). Within their oral and signed stories, no differences in length appeared as a function of the age-of-audience. Bilin gual mothers' oral stories were significantly shorter than those produced by hearing mothers, both overall and in their stories for 10-year-olds, but the lengths of their signed stories did not differ from those produced by deaf mothers. The most surprising of these findings was that the stories produced by hearing mothers were so much longer (612) than those produced by either the deaf mothers (150) or the bilingual mothers (160 for sign, 264 orally). In fact, the hearing mothers showed the greatest variability in the overall lengths of their productions, with a standard deviation (492 tran scribed words) far larger than that of the deaf mothers (109) or the bilin gual mothers (91 and 157 for signed and spoken stories, respectively). Two of the hearing mothers exceeded the grand mean (309) by more than two standard deviations (SD = 338), but even if those two were elimi nated, the mean story length for the hearing mothers would still be 453, considerably larger than those for the deaf and bilingual mothers. In fact, parallel findings of large individual differences have been obtained in</page><page sequence="10">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY earlier studies with deaf and hearing children (e.g., Marschark et al., 1986), and it had been tacitly assumed that such differences were the result of general differences in language fluency. In the present context, three possible reasons may account for the longer story productions *by the hearing mothers. One is that the differ ence might reflect a stylistic difference between women raised in a purely oral environment (hearing mothers) and those raised in a sign language environment (bilingual and deaf mothers), although there seems no appar ent reason for such a phenomenon. A second possibility is that hearing mothers might have been the least intimidated by the videotaping procedure and thus were comfort able enough to talk longer. This alternative also seems unlikely, because the deaf and bilingual mothers generally would have had more contact with videotape through the schools for the deaf in which they worked and/or had attended. A third and related possibility is that the hearing mothers simply might have been more obliging to the alleged purposes of the study (providing stories for education evaluation and enhancement) than were the other two groups. Usually such a difference between the hearing mothers and the bilingual mothers, based on socialization, would not be expected. However, all of the hearing mothers were drawn from the university community (students or staff) and might have been more re sponsive to the scientific and educational task demands than the other women. In any case, it is essential to note that the bilingual mothers' stories were of approximately the same length as deaf mothers' stories (see Table 1). This finding is important because it indicates that the large differences in mean story length between deaf and hearing mothers was not one of hearing status per se. Regardless of the locus of the observed differences in story length, the fact that they occurred necessitated that analyses of the frequencies of nonliteral constructions be based on a measure that would take story length into account. Consistent with previous studies of nonliteral lan guage production, the measure employed here was the number of con structions per 100 transcribed words. This metric avoids bias against production of shorter stories by measuring the "density" of nonliteral productions rather than their absolute numbers (see Marschark et al., 1987; PolIio &amp; Pollio, 1974, for discussion). It also prevents the bias against slower producers that would be introduced if a time-based mea sure were employed. Finally, use of this measure allows comparison of the present results with those of previous studies (e.g., Everhart &amp; Marschark, 1988; Marschark et al., 1986; Pollio &amp; Pollio, 1974).

However, the proportional measure provided the results of primary inter est, for reasons that will become evident. The proportional analyses indicated that deaf mothers produced sig nificantly more nonliteral constructions than hearing mothers did in sto ries for 4-year-olds and when collapsed across the age of audience. These results replicate previous findings (Everhart &amp; Marschark, 1988; Mar schark &amp; West, 1985; Marschark et al., 1986) that show deaf children produce more nonliteral constructions than hearing children. It is note worthy, however, that one of the deaf mothers included in this analysis produced no nonliteral constructions in her short (64 and 50 words) stories. Considering the bilingual mothers, their total frequencies of using nonliteral constructions did not differ either with age of audience or production mode. Contrary to Newton's (1985) findings on the produc tion of English idioms, they also did not differ from hearing mothers in their frequencies of orally producing nonliteral constructions, either over all or in their stories for either age group. However, the bilingual mothers produced significantly fewer signed nonliteral constructions than deaf mothers did, both overall and in their stories for the separate age groups (see Table 1 ). Taken altogether with the differences observed between deaf and hearing mothers, these results strongly suggest that the findings of greater total nonliteral language use by deaf than hearing individuals, both here and in the previous studies with children, are not solely the consequence of a greater likelihood of nonliteral production in sign language relative to spoken language. Instead, such findings appear to reflect either a real difference in the language content of deaf and hearing individuals and/or an interaction of hearing status and styles of sign language use. The frequencies of using different types of nonliteral constructions also were examined separately for each of the eight categories noted earlier (and separately for rhetorical questions; see Appendix). Because of the large number of comparisons involved, however, Type I errors are possible, and these comparisons should be interpreted with caution. The number of subjects in each significant comparison thus is noted later, insofar as some mothers failed to produce some types of nonliteral con structions in some conditions. Note, however, that the latter situation has the effect of making it more difficult to obtain statistical reliability for observed differences and thus the smaller the η in reliable differences, the more consistent was the observed effect within that sample. Considering, first, differences between deaf and hearing mothers,</page><page sequence="13">Language Productions hearing mothers used only frozen trope more frequently than did deaf mothers, both in stories for 4-year-olds (n = 7) and 10-year-olds (n = 8), as well as overall (n = 11) (see also, Everhart &amp; Marschark, 1988). Deaf mothers, in contrast, used more pantomime than did hearing mothers in their stories for 4-year-olds (n = 10), 10-year-olds (n = 11), and overall (n = 13). They also used more novel linguistic modification than did hearing mothers in stories for both age groups (n = 13 and η = 11) as well as overall (n = 16). The only other reliable differences between deaf and hearing mothers were in the overall use of frozen gesture (n = 14), and lexical substitutions (n = 6), which were greater for deaf than hearing mothers. Considering the bilingual mothers, the only reliable differences be tween their oral stories and those of the hearing mothers were in the bilinguals' significantly greater use of novel trope in stories for 4-year-olds and overall. Comparisons of the bilinguals' signed stories and those of the deaf mothers showed that the deaf mothers used pantomime significantly more frequently in stories to 4-year-olds (n = 12) and overall (n = 15), and also used linguistic modifications more frequently in stories to 10 year-olds (n = 15) and overall (n = 17). There was no reliable difference in the use of frozen tropes (cf. Newton, 1985). When the bilingual mothers' oral and signed stories are compared, they show two of the three differences observed in the comparison of deaf and hearing mothers, all favoring their signed over their oral stories: They used significantly more pantomime in stories to 4-year-olds (n = 5) and overall (n = 6), and novel linguistic modification in stories to 10-year olds (n = 7) and overall (n = 7). However, in neither category did these production rates reach those of the deaf mothers (see Table 1 ). One further set of analyses was performed using the total number of nonIiterai constructions per story, regardless of story length. As can be seen in Table 1, the women were quite consistent in their productions for the two age groups, and the bilingual mothers were consistent in their use of nonliteral devices in sign and speech. Even though the deaf and hear ing mothers produced more nonliteral constructions, on average, than did the bilingual mothers, those differences were not reliable. In fact, none of the paired comparisons of the total scores were reliable according to (parametric) t tests or to (nonparametric) Mann-Whitney U and Wil coxon Signed-Ranks tests. Clearly, what is missing here is that although deaf and hearing mothers used the same number of nonliteral devices in their stories, the deaf mothers did so in stories only one quarter the length of those of the hearing mothers. Such an analysis ignores that nonliteral constructions serve a much more central role in the story-telling of deaf mothers than of hearing mothers. At issue is not whether the difference occurs, but its origins and implications.</page><page sequence="14">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The present research was intended to address two issues. One is the nature of the language used by deaf and hearing adults in communicating with deaf and hearing children. Although several researchers have begun to examine parent-child sign language as it compares to parent-child speech (e.g., MacKay-Soroka et al., 1987, 1988; Meadow et al., 1981; Swisher, 1984), this present study is apparently the first in which the nonliteral content of such communication has been explicitly examined (see also Maestas y Moores, 1980; Swisher, 1984). In this regard, the present results are clear, the relatively small sam ple size notwithstanding. Not only do deaf mothers include a variety of nonliteral language constructions in their language to children, but they do so even with very young children. Although they do not appear to produce nonliteral language as frequently as do deaf children (cf. Marschark &amp; West, 1985; Marschark et al., 1986), deaf mothers produce more nonliteral language to children than do hearing mothers, even if those hearing mothers are fluent, native signers. In short, nonliteral lan guage is clearly a central component of linguistic competence (Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980; Ortony, 1975) that appears in both young language learn ers and mature adult users of signed as well as spoken languages. In the present attempt to evaluate possible differences in social editing of nonliteral content in stories intended for 4- and 10-year-old children, no consistent, reliable differences appeared. However, nonliteral construc tions were more frequent in stories for 4-than 10-year olds in all conditions except oral production by bilingual mothers (see Table 1). Whether this result reflects a greater utility of nonliteral devices in language directed to younger children (see Ortony, 1975) or is a consequence of the relatively small samples involved here, remains unclear. In either case, given the important role of nonliteral language in linguistic and cognitive develop ment, this issue clearly warrants further consideration. The present results suggest that sign language use alone is insufficient as the hypothesized locus of previous findings that deaf children appear to have nonliteral sign language competence comparable to the oral compe tence of their hearing peers (Marschark et al., 1986; cf. Conley, 1976). Bilingual mothers, who had learned sign language in childhood from their deaf parents, produced significantly less nonliteral sign than their deaf counterparts and were similar in oral production to their hearing counter parts. At the same time, however, several of the reliable differences ob served between bilingual mothers' signed and oral productions (as well as the direction of the overall difference) were consistent with the differences between deaf and hearing mothers' productions, respectively.</page><page sequence="15">Language Productions These latter findings have two possible interpretations. One is that spoken and sign languages truly differ in their amenability to novel, nonliteral productions, at least as tapped by the present scoring system. This difference may be particularly salient in comparisons of spoken lan guage and ASL, as opposed to the various pidgin sign languages that include English constructions, although it appears difficult to achieve any consensus about how such comparisons should be made. Alternatively, deaf signers might use pantomime, linguistic modifica tion, and perhaps other nonliteral devices more frequently than hearing, native-signing individuals as well as nonnative teachers of deaf children (see Marschark &amp; McNeill, submitted, for discussion). For that very rea son, the line between literal and nonliteral sign may be less clear for some signers than for others (cf. Marschark &amp; West, 1985). Thus, the possibility is suggested, consistent with the present data, that hearing status and sign language have some subtle interactions available to inspection by empiri cal study. Clearly, a more complete understanding is needed of the psy cholinguists similarities and differences between hearing and deaf sign ers in both oral and manual modes of communication.

APPENDIX Categories of Nonliteral Constructions Novel trope. Frequently observed and investigated in written prose, this category includes metaphors, similes, anthropomorphism, and other figurative constructions. Examples include I jerked up my courage (hear ing metaphor), LORD STAR (deaf metaphor), interchangeable heads "like a headset you just put on" (hearing simile), SIT AROUND LIKE INDIANS (deaf simile). In contrast to our previous studies with children, we observed the mothers here using rhetorical questions relatively fre quently. Insofar as these did not seem particularly creative, these were not scored as trope (cf. Barlow et al., 1970), but were considered a separate category. Frozen trope. This category includes formerly novel figures that have become part of their respective vernaculars through repeated use. Exam ples include spoken figures like way above my head and I stumbled upon it and signed figures like MESSED AROUND (signed as DO-DO-DO-DO) and VERY STUPID (signed as O-hand struck against forehead). Because of</page><page sequence="18">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY its frozen nature, most onomatopoeia is generally scored in this category rather than in the previous category (cf. Barlow et al., 1970). Frozen gesture. This category includes ritualized movements that convey explicit information beyond that conveyed by accompanying spoken or signed language. Excluded are gestures of emphasis (cf. Mc Neill, 1985) and conventional sign inflections and deictic (indexical) pointing by deaf subjects indicating change of speaker, location, or per sonal pronouns (Klima &amp; Bellugi, 1979). Scored examples include stand ing with arms akimbo to denote impatience and making a Shh! gesture with the forefinger in front of the lips. Scored examples from sign lan guage include WOW (waving one loose 5-hand, palm down) and YEAH/ AGREE (Y-hand, palm forward, small forward-backward movement). Supplemental gesture. This category includes gestures that accom pany spoken or signed language, typically adding to it iconically. Exam ples include showing the shape of a bridge following the sign BRIDGE and showing the outline location of an eye right in the middle of his forehead. Pantomime. This category involves "acting out" portions of a story as a means of conveying information beyond that conveyed in accompany ing linguistic description. Conventional mimetic signs (e.g., FISHING, TENNIS) were not scored. Examples include a hearing child showing how creatures felt his face and a deaf child frantically paddling a boat. Gestural and pantomimic sequences were scored as single constructions unless separated by pauses, changes in signer orientation (indicating change of actor), or explicit separators (e.g., FINISH). Linguistic modification. For hearing subjects, this category includes a variety of vocal changes and lexical modifications. For deaf subjects, it includes changes in formational characteristics of signs through alter ations of the signing space, hand position, handshape, movement, or number of hands used; the implications of which are comparable to the vocal and lexical changes observed in spoken production. In both cases, linguistic units are modified in ways that convey additional information or highlight some aspect of an ongoing description in a particularly apt way. Regular noun and verb inflections in sign language and aspectual modula tion on signs, as discussed by Klima and Bellugi (1979), are not scored. Scored examples include extraordinary sign and vocal shortening or ex tension (usually indicating duration or extent), changing the part of speech of a word or sign (in a novel way) by adding an inflection, and iconic modifications of signs and vocal productions (e.g., switching to a creaky voice to indicate an elderly actor or to a small signing space to indicate an infant actor). Linguistic inventions. These are novel linguistic constructions (i.e.,</page><page sequence="19">Language Productions not gesture or pantomine) that although not currently part of the language are understandable representations for old or new ideas. Three different kinds of inventions have been observed. Lexical inventions involve single words or signs that novelly represent familiar items. For hearing subjects, this includes words like grabber substituted for tongs, and wipe-ups for rag. For deaf subjects, examples include similar, created signs for LOCO MOTIVE and WHIRLPOOL. (In most cases, the latter are either fin gerspelled or signed literally as well, indicating intentional figurative use; Mendelsohn et al., 1984). Conceptual inventions involve the creation or combination of linguistic units to denote a conceptually novel item. Exam ples include The Washing Machine (similar to the "Wash &amp; Brush-up Co." in the Wizard of Oz); alusinium ("the most valuable mineral in the universe"); LITTLE-EYED-PEOPLE, a race that populated the center of the earth; and DEEP-DIRT, an underground world. Proper inventions are either new proper names or existing names meaningfully applied to non traditional individuals or groups (e.g., Flip would be scored when applied to someone on a world full of gymnastic creatures, but not when applied to a human). Lexical substitutions. These are novel constructions, not regular signs or words, that meaningfully take the place of one of more standard linguis tic units. These are rare, thus far having been observed only in the substitu tions of gestures or drawings (e.g., "I saw a [drawing of a turtle] crawling toward me") for words within stories. They are different from lexical inventions in that, by definition, they replace rather than accompany literal statement.</page></plain_text>
