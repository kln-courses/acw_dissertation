<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HEGELIAN CONCEPT OF POLITICAL FREEDOM IRVING Louis HOROWITZ Washington University I TRADITIONAL SOCIOLOGY tends to assume that the State is part of the Social System, and that a system of power operates only at some levels within the System. This is not the only possible or plausible vision of human interaction. If the dialectical tradition culminating with Hegel did nothing else, it established the unique place of political theory in the study of culture. Hegel's analysis of freedom is distinguished by a firm separation of civil society from polity. His approach is theoretical in that throughout he is con- cerned with basic properties of social and political structures. Social phenomena are not viewed empirically as going entities, but selec- tively, through logical, i.e., dialectical distinctions. The Hegelian approach assumes completeness in that all relevant concepts and relations which would be required in empirical undertakings are -worked out. This special sense of methodology as ideal typification should be kept in mind when examining Hegel. What we are pro- vided with is a systems approach rather than empirical analysis. Few commentators have viewed the directly political and social writings of Hegel as an extension of his more abstract works. A British analytic philosopher has even suggested that Hegel's Philoso- phy of Right, in which the social and legal basis of political freedom *In its original form, this article was intended for publication in the Sammelband iiber das Verhaltnis des Marxismus zur Philosophie Hegels (Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, Berlin-Leipzig) under the title "Der Begriff der Freiheit: Von Hegel zu Marx." This symposium was to be an extension of discussions taking place in the Deutsche Zeitschrift fur Philosophie between 1954-56. However, the arrest and conviction on treason charges of the editor of both the Zeitschrift and of the Sammelband, Wolfgang Harich, and severe icriticisms of the political attitudes of other contributors to the Hegel volume (particularly Ernst Bloch and Georg Lukacs), led to the aban- donment of this project. For an account of this situation, and the present status of social philosophy in Germany, see, Irving L. Horowitz, "German Marxism: Renaissance and Repression," in Dissent, Vol. IV, No. 3, 1957. This paper, ten years in seeing the light of print, is dedicated to Harich on the tenth "anniversary" of his imprisonment. [3]</page><page sequence="2">4 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [Vol. 28 is central, represents an aberration, "a deep loss of integrity both in his character and in his thinking."1L My purpose in this study is to show that such a view represents a mis-reading of Hegel. If taken literally it would result in, a view of him as a thinker lacking the skills of even a keen social ethnographer. I shall try to demonstrate the reverse: that the social and political issue of freedom represents for Hegel die Weisheit, the sociological expression of philosophic wisdom. Hegel shared with the Sturm und Drang movement and its Romantic aftermath a dissatisfaction with the utilitarian impulse to define freedom in terms of a calculus of individual interests. Yet he was not willing to consider the notion of a Volksgruppe to be a re- placement for a practical theory of individual freedom and respon- sibility. Hegel's contempt for abstract notions of freedom, and for freedom as a defense of property rights, places him in contrast to Novalis, Mfuller, Schleiermacher, and other representatives of Ger- man romanticism during the Napoleonic era. In attempting to lo- cate the specific ethical coordinates of freedom, Hegel laid the basis for a new view of political man. Prussianism as a nineteenth century ideology was quite different from what it was to become during the age of national socialism. In the years in which Hegel wrote, Prussia appeared as the least com- promised part of Germany. Although defeated by the Napoleonic armies at Jena, Prussia retained a distinct moral advantage in the eyes of nationalists for having defended German interests. Other German states became French satellites in the Rhine Confederation. Austria capitulated to Napoleon through court maneuvers. Prussia alone remained an unwilling partner to the Continental System. The Prussianization of Germany was viewed by many of the intellec- tuals as the exclusive means for achieving the feeling if not the fact of sovereignty. The ultimate defeat of the Napoleonic forces served to enhance Prussian separatism. What should be appreciated is that the options for men like Fichte and Hegel were narrowed to Prussianism or Bonapartism. And whether Hegel was "pro-Bona- parte" or "pro-Prussian" represents an ideological irrelevance. The breakthrough of a democratic option did not take place in Germany 'J. N.

If it is proper to consider Hegel's ontology in terms of system and method, a posi- tion Engels maintained,3 it is no less the case that his social theory can be interpreted along similar lines. Hegel's concept of freedom was not simply an afterthought to his disaffection with Bonapartism. In its theoretical side it was an effort to overcome the antinomies created first by Hobbes' mechanical rendering of the question of political power in an egocentric world, and second by Kant's ab- stract, rationalist approach to politics in a cosmopolitan, universalist world. History became Hegel's way out of the dilemmas created by both mechanism and transcendentalism. The problem of the scope and nature of political freedom occu- pies an analogous technical status in Hegel's thought to the issue of causality in natural philosophy. Hegel was faced with the task of re-establishing the grounrds of causality in order to make history scientific and overcome the indeterminism of Locke's Essay Concern- ing Human Understanding. He confronted a similar problem of "demonstrating that (contrary to theories based on custom and voli- tion) freedom is inextricably tied to social necessity. To demonstrate this, Hegel drew heavily upon the work of Aristotle, Spinoza, and to a lesser extent, Bacon. From Aristotle, Hegel learned that freedom is essentially social and political rather than individual; freedom in the absence of organized social systems being a logical as well as an empirical contradiction for Aristotle. From Spinoza, he derived the determinist view of freedom as the comprehension of necessity; freedom being impossible in isolation from knowledge of the real and rational relations of human societies. From Bacon, Hegel derived the idea that there is a clear identifica- tion of positive freedom with the power to transform knowledge into social goods through the beneficent agent of science and experiment. 2For Hegel's place in the nationalist movement, see Leonard Krieger, The German Idea of Freedom: History of a Political Tradition (Boston: Beacon Press, 1957), pp. 125-38. 3Friedrich Engels, Ludwig Feuerbach iund der Ausgang der Klassischen Deutschen Philosophie, in Marx-Engels Ausgewahlte Schrif ten (Berlin: Dietz Verlag, 1951-52), Vol. 2, ch. 1.</page><page sequence="4">6 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [Vol. 2 8 These men clearly do not exhaust the philosophic influences which generated Hegel's desire to bring about an explicit context for dis- cussing freedom. One would also have to reckon with the line of the German Aufklarung moving from Lessing to Kant. Nevertheless, the writings of Aristotle and Spinoza serve to indicate the intellec- tual network within which Hegel operated. More so than with most philosophers, the intellectual lineage of Hegel is of decisive impor- tance, since, as his lectures in philosophic history make plain, he set himself the task of reconciling as well as comprehending the totality of the history of ideas.4 The romantic view of Hegel's doctrine of freedom was a carica- ture. In Germany there were the well known efforts by the mon- archy to appropriate Hegel's theory of freedom by making it part of a system of paying homage to the State. The writings of semi- official ideologists, such as F. J. Stahl, are characteristic. They de- nounce Hegel only at those points when his writings serve no statist ends. There were the equally abstract efforts to make the Hegelian theory of freedom serve as a touchstone for a wholesale critique of German society. The work of the left-Hegelians, Bruno Bauer and Arnold Ruge, purged Hegel of his particular philosophical message by reducing "human emancipation" to "political emancipation."5 Outside Germany, Hegel's work underwent similar transforma- tions. There were the feeble attempts of Anglo-American high culture to establish a simplistic formula: the free man is one who compre- hends the necessary limits of history, nature, and mind. Left as a formula, it is little wonder that Royce saw human freedom as cir- cumscribed and defined in terms of the need for loyalty to the estab- 4See in particular Hegel's Inaugural Address given at the University of Heidelberg in 1816, prefixed to Vol. 1 of Lectures on the History of Philosophy, translated by E.

The individual became the only reality, the only free entity.8 While the fragmentation of Hegelian social theory makes it plain that even the firmest edifice will crack with time, and become obsolete under changing conditions, there remains the need to ex- plore the rubble to see if there are any usable parts, and to under- stand what went wrong in the construction of the Hegelian social- philosophic system.9 II The category of freedom pervades all areas of Hegel's philoso- phy. Every phase of life and logic is said to reveal the impulse to- ward freedom. In logic, which for Hegel encompasses the structure of the universe of mind and matter, the Doctrine of Notion, the core of his non-syllogistic logic, is equated with the necessity of develop- ment and self-development in the processes of life. Freedom is knowledge, a symbol of "pure self-consciousness"; the absolute and unfettered awareness of the logical relations underlying the gener- ation and regeneration of life.'0 Logic is considered as an ontology, a description of a rational universe in motion. Further, this objec- tive rationality is determinate because it is real.

The assumption that the expansion of freedom can happen outside or in opposition to real- ity is, in Hegel's imagination, a violation of the purpose of philos- ophy, the cognitive search for concrete truth. Hegel was compelled to satisfy the requirements of his idealism by ultimately conceiving of freedom metaphysically, as "absolute self-security and self-re- pose."11- However, this does not alter the fact that he considered logic as a product of the free conscience, since only such a conscience is in a position to establish scientific truths.l2 In the Logic we re- ceive our first indication that Hegel's view of freedom is not reducible to political totalitarianism or to personal idiosyncrasy. An uncon- trolled system of power, like pure individualism, is irrational; and by definition, what is irrational cannot be transformed into a mode for realizing freedom. In the Phenomnenology of Mind the knot of freedom is un- tangled in carefully evolved stages that demonstrate the logical bases of consciousness. For Hegel the evolution of human thought is no less an evolution in the positive freedom of civilization. Freedom comes through precision and exactitude. The social role of science, no less than its essential content, is the expansion of freedom through knowledge. This identification of philosophy with science provides mankind not only with a love of wisdom but with wisdom as such. In the act of transforming potentiality into actuality, abstraction into specificity, man changes from a plaything of causal- ity into its master. Real freedom then, for Hegel, is emancipation through the "scientific" control of events-science not yet seen as differing from the ontological. The Phenomenology offers an intensive description of the devel- opment of consciousness. The unfolding of ideas, true as well as false, has its autonomous history. In Hegel rational thought moves from the logical to the phenomenological, that is, from form to content. He is concerned with carrying the conclusions of the Logic to a high- "Ibid., Section 3, Part 3. "2The best explanation offered of the tri-partite relation of science, idealism and freedom in Hegel is that of Edmund Husserl. He noticed that Hegel, in his effort to consecrate philosophy in the name of science, in the name of rigor, precision, and truth, falsified the character of science. He thus falsified existence through his idealism in order to preserve the virtues he held supreme, rigor, precision, and truth. See, La philosophie comme science rigoureuse, trans.

Consciousness is more than a quality of intellect, it is a category of society and its institutions. Freedom of spirit comes not by simple recognition of external objects as a mys- terious event alien to thought; nor does freedom of spirit offer proclamations about personality development. Absolute knowledge is that which binds objectivity to subjectivity; it unfolds as law, ethics, and religion, that is, knowledge as a social function. Hegel had an unyielding respect for this object-subject formula, considering such a relation more capable of yielding truth than either the individual or the group taken separately. He made the subordination of the knower to universal reason a guiding principle of his work. As in his Logic, so too in his theory of science, what is important in the evolution of mankind is the concrete condi- tions of social life (especially its institutionalized forms) which give substance to the quest for freedom. No sooner had the Phenomenology been completed than a para- dox revealed itself which relentlessly pursued Hegel. If the essence of freedom is the identification of individual reason with universal reason, the true realm of freedom is pure thought. Far from yielding freedom as concrete activity, freedom once more assumed the classic contemplative pose. Marx had to examine the core of this dilemma to arrive at an independent standpoint: "It is precisely abstract thinking from which these objects (Wealth, State, Power) are alien- ated and to which they stand opposed with their pretension of reality. The philosopher, who is himself an abstract form of alienated man, establishes himself as the yardstick of the alienated world. The whole history of estrangement, the whole re-appropriation of this Entausserung is therefore nothing more than; the history of the production of abstract thinking, that is, absolute, logical, speculative thinking."113 Hegel grasped the idea of freedom. But since only the idea had reality, he effectively sealed himself off from a natural- ist appraisal. As a result, as Feuerbach expressed it, Hegel was led "3Karl Marx, Oekonomisch-philosophische Manuscripte aus dem Jahre 1844, MEGA, Abt. 1, Band 3.

This same point has been made in greater detail by Alexandre Kojeve in examining the Phenomenology as a movement in Hegel's thought from the philosopher to the sage. Cf.

First, Hegel saw man as separated from reality as the personal conscience is isolated from objective consciousness, or better, as ideas are separated from truths. Next, Feuerbach considered the alienation problem in so- called anthropological terms i.e., as man separated from his own bio-social nature, and in consequence, having no direct experi- ence of Nature qua Nature. To overcome this alienated condition, man invents a religion in order to artificially conquer Nature, and evolves a theology to justify this anthropomorphism. Finally, Marx examined alienation as an economic condition rather than a philosophical condition. Alienation became a consequence of in- iquitous, exploitive productive relations; man the inventor of machines and of labor-saving instruments, becomes captive to the machine. The problem becomes radically altered in modern psy- choanalytic doctrine. To save labor time becomes a special case of the large-scale task of emancipating man. The intellectual move- men,t from Hegel to Feuerbach to Marx can be described as a movement from a sociology of knowledge, iinto a sociology of religion, and finally into general sociology, or the criticism of social institu- tions as such.'5 Our main concern is how Hegel worked out his sociology of knowledge, or for those who stoutly insist that sociology begins with Comte, Hegel's phenomenology of freedom in society. Hegel was not unaware of the impasse into which his Logic and Phenom- enology placed him. It was not just that he pictured freedom as the unity of thought and reality, for Kant before him and Kierke- gaard afterwards, shared this belief. Hegel's real problem was to assume that concrete reality is revealed through philosophic con- templation. This view left little room for social activity as a "4Ludwig Feuerbach, Gedanken uber Tod und Ensterblichkeit, in Sammt- liche Werke, ed. by Bolin and Jodl, (Stuttgart: Bad Cannstatt Fromann Verlag, 1903-11), Vol. 3.

Hegel himself under- stood that metaphysical emancipation was not the same as eman- cipation from metaphysics. He attempted to overcome this paradox by retaining the belief that although the foundations of freedom are delineated by logical and phenomenological /orms, the manifestations of freedom are social, economic, and legal, and hence practical. The actual expression of Hegel's dilemma is that his attempt to develop a meaningful political philosophy came twenty years after his direct attention to political practice.'6 III Hegel's Philosophy of Right and Law considers the problem of freedom in terms of social structure and historical process. In it, the individual is not only conceived of as consciousness, but also as economic, political, and legal activity. The repository of human knowledge is the social institution, from kinship units to international relations. The resolution of the dilemma between thought and action was bridged by making the thinking part of freedom philosophical, and the practical part of freedom social. The trouble with this bridge lies in its faulty construction. Social phenomena were seen to supersede one another, rather than to coexist. Personal morality is "resolved" into the family, which in turn is "resolved" into civil society, which in turn is "resolved" into the State. The structure of society ultimately became its proc- ess. Once again freedom became linked to the notion of metaphys- ical perfection. Most evidence adduced to prove Hegel's attraction for statism is derived from the Philosophy of Right. In its uncritically high estimate of the German Reformation, its desperate efforts to give a philosophic basis to militarism with which to counter the effects of Kant's pacifism, and in its attempt to derive historically the neces- sity of nationalism with which to counter Rousseau's conventionalist idea of society, this work represents a classic defense of conservative 1It is significant that Hegel's Philosophy of Right and Law (1821), trans. by T.

Nevertheless, such a judgment, even granting its correct- ness, mistakes the political posture of Hegel with the quality and goals of his analysis. In this work are to be found such cardinal concepts as the functional role of the family in framing personality, the formative role of economy in the development of social systems, the conflict between economic and political interests in periods of crisis, and a precise description of the psychology of alienation;. Furthermore, in the Preface to the work which is said to stand as a monumept to Hegel's unyielding reaction, he candidly declares that while the State is something rational in itself, such rationality is gained most readily by giving the person a chance to become a personality. Hegel rejects the Platonic critique of Greek democracy (and by extension all democracy) by declaring that his view led him to "violate most deeply . . . the free and limitless personality."''7 Such a free per- sonality is considered to be the basic direction and aim of social action. That this idea of the free personality is at variance with the ideal of the historical State should not prevent an acknowledgment that Hegel was concerned with how to gain concrete emancipation and to stipulate the conditions in society which would make this possible. The Philosophy of Right and Law is divided into three parts. The first two deal with the nature of abstract right and morality, property and welfare "considered intrinsically." The third part, which has as its chief divisions the family, civil society and the State, is the core of the book. It traces the meaning of freedom in its "social forms." Freedom is initially considered in its most cellular form as personal, undifferentiated caprice. Next the individual is examined in terms of the forms governing his relationship to other individuals, possession, property, contract and moral obligation. From this, Hegel develops the idea of freedom in terms of law and ethics. The ethical life makes possible socialization of the person in that it elevates the notion of freedom to the forefront of self-consciousness. "Ethical life is the idea of freedom in that on the one hand it is the good become alive, the good endowed in self-consciousness with "Hegel's Philosophy of Right and Law (Oxford University: The Clarendon Press, 1953), Preface.</page><page sequence="11">1966] HEGELIAN CONCEPT OF POLITICAL FREEDOM 13 knowing and willing and actualized by self-conscious action-while on the other hand self-consciousness has in the ethical realm its absolute foundation and the end which actuates its effort. Thus ethical life is the concept of freedom developed into the existing world and the nature of self-consciousness."l8 Hegel desires to move beyond personal freedom to universal freedom. He proceeds, via the dissolution of the family and com- munity associations, to a consideration of freedom in terms of civil society and the political State which represents the social realization of freedom. The State has this role by virtue of its unique capacity to rise above private interests and mediate conflicting private claims in terms of a larger national purpose. The idea of the rule of law, rather than men, did not of course originate with Hegel; it is a fundamental juridical principle of Western societies. What Hegel did do was convert this juridical principle into an ethical absolute. Law was provided with a mystique. Ethics was thereby to be codi- fied like law. The sameness of law and ethics is not just a peculiarity of Hegel, but of the language as well. The word Recht, the German equivalent to jus in Latin, droit in French, or derecho in Spanish, can be translated as either "Right" or "law." Hegel himself declares that by Recht he means not only civil law, but also morality, ethics, and at times, world history, i.e., in the sense of the dialec- tical pattern of human growth.19 Throughout Hegel's Philosophy of Right there is a deceptively commercial imagery used in describing freedom. Individual freedom becomes the right to private ownership, use and exchange of prop- erty. Civil society has as its essential core "the protection of prop- erty by law."20 Even the heralded State, which genetically dis- places society, is said to have a middle class basis. Indeed, "that this middle class be formed is a main interest of the State."2' The structure of society is economy considered historically. This fact is central in understanding Hegel's social thought. He makes plain that whatever his reservations about the moneyed classes, he was never willing to adopt a nostalgic view of the German landed aristocracy. While Hegel mistrusted the biirgeriiche Geselischaft, he "Ibid., paragraph 142. "9Ibid., paragraph 33. 20Ibid., paragraph 188; cf. also, paragraphs 45, 56. "'Ibid., paragraph 297.</page><page sequence="12">14 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [Vol. 28 preferred it to restorationist politics, or for that matter, feudal economic policies.22 The intention of Hegel is clear: to unite a fragmented Germany to the need for action. By logical extension, other aspects of Hegel's world view became equally evident: that the touchstone for measur- ing human emancipation is history, and that social function, there- fore, cannot be considered apart from historical design. Because of this double aspect Lefebvre wrote: "Pour poser correctement notre probleme, des rapports entre nlecessite et liberte, remontons a Hegel."23 Hegel presents a "positive" concept of freedom in relation to law and social order that stands apart from and yet embraces a pronounced conservation. The Philosophy of Right is an attempt to critically evaluate all past estimates of the nature of the free society and the free conscience; but it is also an effort to settle the issue for all future ages. The most challenging social question taken up in the Philosophy of Right is the relation of egoism to sociality. He rejects the utilitarian theory that decisions are best resolved by the pleasure- pain principle. The challenge is made in terms of the French Revolution. Before he had formulated the polarity of egoism and altruism, Hegel was convinced that the Revolution was a vision of an age of true justice. However, it was no less a desire for freedom that moved men everywhere to become critics of existing Establish- ments. For Hegel, the French Revolution, like the Protestant Ref- ormation, was a world revolution, and not simply a national up- heaval. Its specific content ended in death and despair, while its radical aims nurtured a generation of rebellion. But the ultimate betrayal of the purposes of the Revolution, by one class after an- other, one political faction after another, caused him to evaluate the 22Hegel took note of the fact (with obvious approval) that the system of representative government was common to all of the newer European States, irrespective of outward forms of monarchism or republicanism.

As a doctrine about society, the principle of utility reduced itself to the assertion that rulers should act with Olympian detachment to offset the foollies of selfish ambition. To Hegel, this confusion between the "ought to be" and the "is" of politics was made because the Revolution, following Rousseau, saw in the State a General Will, popular consensus, and not what it actually is, the historical unfolding of Rational Will.25 This resulted in an irrational insistence that the State reflects a system of strati- fication, e.g., Montesquieu's system of checks and balances. The utilitarian notion that laissez-faire should be the leading political principle because it is economically viable represented the first step in the demise of the Revolution. For Hegel, it demonstrated that French social theory could not distinguish politics from economy.26 In its utilitarian usage freedom is only the egoistic right of the person over and against the collective will of humanity. Real free- dom, freedom as rational, negates egoism because its point of de- parture is the spirit of the avant-garde (the State) and not the general spirit of the people (the society). The vogue of hedonism represents, to Hegel's way of thinking, not the achievement of free- dom, but the alienation of man from freedom. This is a necessary outcome to a perspective which regards the products of history as both subjective and capricious, responsible more to an irrational general will than to law. Here we have the first indication that Hegel is dissatisfied with a pure theory of society; and that instead he will seek to create a "synthetic" political sociology.

The opposition to Rous- seau is expressed first in his condemnation of rule by men rather than rule of law, second in his criticism of the principle of social equality, and third, in his opposition to establishing the popular will as a basis for political life. Beneath Hegel's disenchantment with the course of the French revolution was his larger theoretical concern over the relationship of social contract to natural right. In Rousseau, Hegel saw the essential forerunner to his own view of freedom and its relation to political authority. In the betrayal of the revolutionary impulse, he saw a need to reassert reason in the State in order to replace reason in society. Hegel's extended polemic is worth quoting to appreciate the character and extent of his revolt against political nominalism. "If the state is confused with civil society, and if its specific end is laid down as the security and protection of property and personal freedom, then the interest of the individuals as such becomes the ultimate end of their association, and it follows that membership of the state is something optional. But the state's relatior3 to the in- dividual is quite different from this. Since the state is mind objecti- fied, it is only as one of its members that the individual himself has objectivity, genuine individuality, and an ethical life. Unfortunately, however, as Fichte did later, Rousseau takes the will only in a determinate form as the individual will, and he regards the universal will not as the absolutely rational element in the will, but only as a (general' will which proceeds out of this individual will as out of a conscious will.

In terms of problems of the State Hegel becomes most demanding. We cannot will our connection to the State any more than we can will our alienation from it in periods of decay. Rousseau's advice to simulate the moral qualities of primitive man, if not the social conditions of antiquity (pre- history), is to Hegel tantamount to the illusion that man can escape his historical commitments. Hegel's organicism rejected the pos- sibility of a complete dissolution of ties and relatioins between men and nations. When this takes place you are no longer dealing with social forces as such,, but with random persons. The freedom of the social contract is therefore an illusion of those who cannot rise above civil society. The social contract to Hegel is vicarious freedom ending "in the maximum of frightfulness ar.d terror."28 The alienation of the honnete homme from rotting feudal society made of Rousseau a critic. But his voluntarism gave to his thinking a nostalgic glow and an irrational substance, which cast doubt on the possibilities of ever reaching the good society. Hegel, starting from a strictly formalistic desire to place man in a total system of historical infallibilism, frowning upon the waste and horror of rev- olution, nonetheless (if inadvertently) became a crucial link in modern theories of social revolution. He paid strict attention to the real sources of historical generation: the economically sanctioned civil society and the politically sanctioned State. Once the Hegelian social system was complete, with its hierarchical chain moving and grinding its way from the individual to the State, it was but a step away to frame an historical hypothesis that moved from nationalism to internationalism and from the middle-class State to the classless society, or anti-State. And this bold step Marx took. The connection of law to freedom is two-fold for Hegel. In one capacity law has as its actual content the processes which form the evolution of society independent of human will. In this way freedom is related to necessity in that it presupposes an elemental conformity with objective, historical ideals. But the relation of law to freedom in civil society seemingly has for its chief content the customs, rules, and traditions through which freedom becomes linked to coercion rather than to nature's way. If the spirit of law embodies the spirit of freedom, and if freqdom cannot exist without duties and "nIbid., paragraph 258a.</page><page sequence="16">18 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [Vol. 28 obligations in the juridical sense, we are once more left with the polarization of individual autonomy and political responsibility. In one sense, the existing law of the State becomes the arche- type for the conduct of individual wills. The theory of freedom thus becomes an elaborate scheme for maintaining the status quo, of keeping political power in the possession of those in a position to maintain and interpret the meaning of law. Reason becomes nothing but the reality embodied in the State structure; freedom the knowledge that the State is the foundation of consciousness and self-consciousness (bewusstsein und Selbst-bewusstsein). These were indeed the conclusions of the Philosophy of Right emphasized by the neo-Hegelians, Dilthey, Glockner, and Treitschke, in their quest to prove the ideal origins of the political state.29 There is a different meaning which emerges from a more balanced appraisal of Hegel's analysis of freedom and the legal superstructure. If there is, in fact, a correspondence between a social system and a moral-legal order, then, to move contrary to the spirit or content of law is to move against freedom itself; for it would destroy that unity of the people under the State upon which law is based.30 There is strong evidence that Hegel himself preferred to place a liberal construction on legal matters, as in the case of his analysis of civil rights for religious groups.3' Hegel assumes a condition of society under law which would overcome the alienation that stems from a world without justice, a universe of collective authority. Under the impulse of creating an ethical social order, men can achieve a form of freedom having greater durability than the spurious demand for the direct abolition of social order. It was this aspect of Hegel's theory of law that accounts for post-Hegelian efforts to locate more precisely the connection of law and social emancipation. Hegelianism was sundered at just this point: if the emphasis was put on law and social institutions a conservative result was guaranteed, if the emphasis was placed on the changing contents of law and society and the steady need for human eman- cipation then a radical result was assured.

In this he is perhaps closer to the Judaic than to the Greek tradition, since there is no functional difference in his thought between law and morality. Implicit in Hegel's position is the prop- osition that the good is defined by the free conscience, whether such a conscience resides in the self, the State, or the universe. Since the ethical world of concrete soicial life is the idea of Freedom, morality no less than logic has for its objective content the doctrine of necessity.32 If we accept the premise that moral obligation is the human response to objective necessity, the absence of respon- sibility (even in the juridical sense) implies the absence of moral choice. The presence of necessity in human events limits our options to what is possible, but it does not destroy options as such. If every act is a free act there can be no question of sorting right from wrong. The right becomes amoral, something settled by arbitrary coercive power. Hegel was thus led to reject Hobbes' power thesis, since it rested on the same sort of psychological hedonism which disregards the norms and values of society and the State. The right to make decisions is the characteristic of an ethical man, i.e., a free man. This right, operating within a vortex of historical necessity, is considered by Hegel as the hallmark of the free man vis a vis the slave. Nietzsche, to challenge this system of ethics, was compelled to challenge the entire history of ration,alist philosophy.33 As in the theory of law, much depends on whether we define the Hegelian ethical system to mean that freedom exists because an objective telos directs man to his goals (almost in the Calvillist sense of pre-destiny), or whether freedom is an expanding category the contents of which change in direct proportion to human evolu- tion. To satisfy the demands of his system Hegel concludes with an absolutist prescription: freedom as consciousness of moral-legal obligations. To satisfy his sense of social process, he employs an historical ethos: freedom as consciousness of rational and real possibilities. Hegel endowed freedom with a metaphysical content because he desired to carry his historicism to its ultimate conclusion: the indentification of historical evolution and moral purpose. Because of 32Ibid., paragraph 142. 33Friedrich Nietzsche, The Use and Abuse of History (Vom Nutzen und Nachteil der Historie fur das Leben), translated by A.

Within this system are to be found the root premises of political realism and political idealism. The ethical can have a con- tent only in relation to human action. But action is itself dissolved into spirit, the idea, universal history. Whether man definles his ethical system, or is defined by it, is something Hegel does not re- solve; since he would then also have had to declare that history is not the only framework within which to consider the problem of freedom. In terms of personal morality, freedom remains an insecure abstraction. Freedom requires a "concrete ground", i. e., the union of the individual and the universal. Hegel's concrete ground was the State. While law and morality offer freedom within an objective frame of reference, and in this fashion overcome the capricious freedom which is "the will free only in itself," such objectivity remains formal- istic and indeterminate.3 4 The social locus of human activity is represented by the growth of the State, the true representative of the collective will. Hegel grants the reality of personal, inner free- dom, Luther's freedom of the soul. But freedom to be organic must be objectified, the impersonal responsibility of a non-sectarian in- stitution. Without such an impersonal force, freedom would be re- duced to a psychologically naive peace of soul, or an equally unheroic pecuniary freedom of the economic marketplace. What is needed is a cancellation of such egoism, its transformation into a set of higher truths. Hegel's emphasis on these higher truths of the reasoning mind clearly demarcates him from a shallow romanticism, from efforts to subsume reality within a feeling Geist. The identification Hegel makes between personal will and the will of the State was considered a necessary curative to the flaws in civil society. Civil society represents the superficial world of money relations, the area in which the individual strives for the private accumulation of wealth. Civil society represents the core of deg- radation, the "spectacle of excess, misery, and physical and social corruption."35 In civil society the full horrors of the exchange market are unfolded, the basis of which is the accumulationi of private wealth proceeding through the impoverishment of the laboring classes.336 3Philosophy of Right and Law, paragraphs 29, 30. 3"Ibid., paragraph 185. "Ibid., paragraphs 243, 244.</page><page sequence="19">1966] HEGELIAN CONCEPT OF POLITICAL FREEDOM 21 Civil society embodies values contrary to those of the State; its own inadequacies generate the Leviathan. Civil society, which is clearly identified with the German bourgeoisie, has as its main human denominator the entrepreneurial personality. The State has for its proper concern those universal laws and principles guiding all citizens. The latter is therefore freedom as such.37 The State therefore replaces either the atomized individual or bourgeois civil society as the chief organizing force of men; polity replaces society as the form for realizing freedom.3 8 To support this position, Hegel presents a damaging empirical characterization of the bourgeoisie as an economic and social force. At the same time, he also offers an idealization of the landed nobility and court aristocracy in charge of the State machinery. In this way Hegel mirrors the cleavage in German life at the start of the nine- teenth century between commercial and inherited aristocratic in- terests. In his work one gets a keen sense of how threatened the Prussian Emperor must have felt by the machinations of the bour- geoisie, its pressuring for a greater share of political power as com- pensation for its "economic burden." Hegel participated in the Prussian celebration by convincing himself that the political State could somehow stand apart from and above the social-economic cleavages in its historic role as the carrier of freedom. Like equi- librium and consensus doctrines of the present era, Hegel was more interested in the immediate conditions for maintaining political stability than in the long-range linkages between the State and the dominant economic sectors. Hegel represented the idea of freedom as organically related to the political State, and to the inevitable unfolding of a Weltges- chichte which makes certain the attainment of absolute truth. In his analysis of civil society Hegel adopts the arguments of English classical political economy to ensure the State a metaphysical posi- tion at the expense of the divisive influences of commercial bour- geois interests. This was a return to freedom in its abstract form; a retreat from a scientific concept of social structure to ideological deliberations on how best to preserve conservative political values. History became historicism, a tool for proving this or that emperor to be the bearer of the historical essence. History ceased to serve 37Ibid., paragraph 258. 38Ibid., paragraph 260.</page><page sequence="20">22 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [Vol. 28 as a majestic framework for locating outstanding problems of man, and served instead to enshrine the State as the vehicle for realizing equilibrium. However emphatically Hegel turned the concept of freedom to the sacred interests of the State, there remains the kernel of "self- consciousness" and "self-creation" which enabled him to consider freedom as residing in the social process. Man in his continuing self-creation, the steady growth of civilization through conscious- ness, provides a firm basis for total emancipation. Only formal freedom reduces everything to the General Will. The General Will reveals itself as an assortment of conflicting individual wills, each insisting, on holding itself up as the model for all men. If this process continues indefinitely, tyranny prevails. Inevitably, a shal- low liberalism allows for the Will of the One to displace the General Will. Such a tyranny would offer the shadow of freedom in place of a substantive freedom, e. g., the right of judgment and criticism.39 V A great deal of attention has been given to the way Hegel subsumed society into universal history, and in so doing, drowned the individual in a cosmic vocation. Hegel realized, nonetheless, that there remains an impulse toward individuality. In his directly political essays, w'ritten two decades before The Philosophy of Right, Hegel attempted to retrieve for the area of social personality the "smaller" liberties of dissent, difference, and even disaffection from the general commonweal. Hegel was critical of efforts to needlessly curb individual liberties since this entailed the risk of destroying free- dom in general. Reason and knowledge mediate freedom. The rational constitution does not seek to impose the abstract will on every member of society at every level of social intercourse for the obvious reason that such unanimity of opinion is impossible, and for the less obvious reason that personal liberty is the precondition for the formation of general emancipation. It is not that Hegel conceived of personal freedom in contradistinction to necessity, but that true freedom must always allow a measure of freedom from authority, that is, liberty.

Sibree (New York: Dover Publications, 1956, 2nd ed.), Section III, chap- ter 3.</page><page sequence="21">1966] HEGELIAN CONCEPT OF POLITICAL FREEDOM 23 In Hegel's early view, liberty is denied in two ways: the hedonist negates it, making it a matter of caprice and private will, thereby depriving it of a meaningful historical setting; while the abstract rationalist negates liberty by ruling out the variables in humanly formed ideals and standards, and placing a premium on abstract duties and obligations. Hegel offered his theory of negative free- dom (liberty) to overcome especially the one-sided conclusions of Kant, Rousseau, and Fichte. Positive freedom corresponded to Hegel's theory of history and philosophy as scientific disciplines, while negative freedom corresponded to the practical judgments men must daily make about economics and politics. The transition from Selbstbewusstsein to the Staat as the perfect embodiment of consciousness in Hegelian terms is the transforma- tion from freedom as contemplative to freedom as active. In the realm of praxis, if a people desire negative freedom alone, freedom from institutional responsibilitity, they can never achieve moral or political heights. The built-in egoism of the Burgerliche Gesell- schaft would cut the ground out from under freedom, reducing society to freedom of rather than Jrom market competition. This was the condition of German society at the start of the 19th cen- tury. As Hegel says: "The obstinacy of the German character has not yielded to the point where the separate parts would sacrifice their particular interests for the whole society, where all would be united in one general body and where freedom might be achieved in common with free subjection to the supreme political authority."40 Germany, trapped by the small middle class faith in political particu- larism (Kleinstaaterei), achieved freedom only in the realm of ab- straction rather than in history. This charge became a battle-cry for the remainder of the century, socialism declaring that this vic- tory in the realm of ideas prevented the growth of democracy, and restorationism declaring that this same condition made Germany effete and lacking in national purpose. Hegel himself saw the prob- lem in stricter terms of universal freedom and personal liberty. If egoism were the only expression of freedom, Germany should have been the freest of nations. It was not indicated to Hegel that "self- 4"Die verfassung Deutschlands, in Hegel heute; Eine Auswahl aus Hegels politicher Gedankenwelt, pp. 11-12.

Once positive freedom is anchored to the State, negative freedom, "the self-centered activity," should be allowed to develop unim- peded. The function of liberty is to heighten the prospects of knowledge. This being so, the suppression of liberty carries with it the threat of positive freedom, itself being corroded and its historic mission derailed. Hegel insisted upon the free activity of the citi- zens "in the field of administration and adjudication." Autonomy within a larger national policy is a guarantor of social organization. Hegel was a constitutional monarchist and not just a crude advocate of the discredited divine rights doctrine. And this bias in favor of legality was a constant in his writings. Although he could present no solution other than a conservative solution, he never retreated to the specious comforts of feudality. We owe to Hegel the complete separation of the conservative conscience from the feudal mind. "Society should leave to the people their maintenance according to law, and each class, city, village, community, etc., the freedom of doing and executing what lies within its sphere."41 The young Hegel emerged as an unequivocal inheritor of the Aufkldrung. "Nothing should be more sacred (to government) than to leave to the free action of the citizens all these matters and to protect it without regard to utility. For this freedom is sacred in itself." Hegel goes on to explain the virtues of individual liberty. "We consider that people happy to which the State leaves much freedom in the subordinated, general activities, and that political au- thority infinitely strong which will be supported by the free and untrammeled spirit of its people."42 Hegel's theory of freedom and liberty amounts to a safety-valve principle of government, since un- limited expression of criticism, far from weakening the State, gives it its unlimited strength. Hegel did not show the way in which the negative and positive poles of freedom can be joined without lapsing into the authoritarianism of the God-State. What prevents the lead- er of State from placing a cap on the valve of criticism when, he so pleases? The sectioning off of residual political power into the hands of various elites made it difficult for any "subordinate" activ- ities to be registered. But the problem of the dysfunction of reason "Ibid., pp. 24-25. 42Ibid., p. 25.</page><page sequence="23">1966] HEGELIAN CONCEPT OF POLITICAL FREEDOM 25 was not considered by Hegel, any more than it was by Rousseau. With the passage of years, Hegel was unable to resist the blan- dishments of linking his theory of freedom to the authoritarian State' He indicates that negative freedom is "periled" by its inherent tendency to excess. In this way, Hegel blames the existence of eco- nomic inequality and political repression, not on the messianic State, but on the "excesses" of the popular elements. The vox populi, ex- pressing itself through dirty monetary advantage and revolutionary unrest, makes necessary a powerful State.43 His position reflected a political situation in which Germany was divided in fact between a political power ruled by Junkers and landed nobility, and economic power rooted in urban commerce and industry. In this context, the State did indeed "mediate" the claims of each. But with the sub- sequent expansion of the business classes, and its amalgam with the major "old families," the facade of State neutrality was quickly dis- pelled. History became synonymous with the manifest destiny of the mythic German Empire, and the State became the vehicle through which history would be realized and through which criticism would be distilled. The leit-motif in Hegel's social thought is the distinction be- tween anarchy and freedom. The movement from society to polity is an obvious effort to get from one to the other. But no such dis- tinction is made between liberty and the State beyond a rather tepid remin,der (in the twilight of his career) that "people must partici- pate in legislation and in the most important affairs of state." In the fluid conditions of German life, an effective statement would have at least implied, not simply participation but opposition to the nation-State. This transition from the freedom to participate in the Prussian celebration to opposition to any of its pronouncements was one Hegel could not make once he had staked out the territory of society as the struggle between anarchy and authority. By the close of his career, when he was more concerned with wrappinig up his system than in opening up new issues, Hegel fell victim to his own admonition: "When philosophy paints its grey in grey, then has the shape of life grown old." Thus it is that the close of his Philos- opky o/ Rigkt and Law is neither summation rnor conclusion, but an introduction to the Introduction to the Philosophy of History.44 '8Ueber die englische Reformbill, Hegel heute, pp. 39-40. "Philosophy of Right and Law, paragraphs 341-360.</page><page sequence="24">26 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [ Vol. 28 Neither political science nor political economy can contain the Hegelian "world mind." History alone is the anchor point and proving grounds of freedom. Social life is a "mundane interest," and the "absolute mind" discontent with the mundane, "prepares and works out its transition to its next higher stage."45 While one is left with the disquieting knowledge that the "absolute mind" is nothing more than Hegel's own mind, there is nonetheless a nobility of spirit motivating his decision to locate the springs of freedom in historical process rather than in philosophical speculation. Freedom is essentially a changing phenomenon. The more man- kind develops spiritually, i. e., in the sense of the world mind, the more it becomes aware of its generic self and genetic unfolding. The historical growth of consciousness is thus itself the source of freedom. "World history is the progress of the coinscious-ness of freedom." The role of the philosophy o/ history is to explore the progress of the idea of freedom, while the function of the history of philosophy is the "actualization of freedom." World history in Hegel's sense is the progress of freedom because it is the process of the self-realization of the spiritual content of social existence. And conversely, "freedom is itself its own object of attainment and the sole purpose of Spirit. It is the ultimate end toward which all world history has continually aimed."46 At this point, Hegel's kinship with Platonism is most clearly revealed, since just as spirit and freedom are linked, so too, slavery and dead matter are fused. Every slackening of Spirit involves a retreat to material inertia. Only through history are gaps in the fortress of freedom overcome, nowhere else. Once freedom becomes manifest in spirit, it becomes practical, something taken up by the Volksgeist. Freedom can thus be viewed as the propelling force of hitherto existing societies. When freedom is fully realized through the identification of con- sciousness and history, society in its profane sense ceases to exist. What we are left with is a sacral collectivity of human spirit. Before the tide of freedom everything gives way. Irl his early years, Hegel interpreted this in a radical fashion. Those institutions and constitutions which did not correspond to the Volksgeist were doomed because they provided an unreal, irrational bond. "The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk."17 "5Ibid., paragraph 344. "6Philosophy of History, Introduction, chap. III, sect. 2.

The task of displacing the old involves the ability "to rise above one's little interest." Egoism conflicts with social change. "Too often a reservation is hidden behind the eager concern for the general welfare as long as it coincides with our own interest. Such eagerness to consent to proposed reforms gets discarded as soon as a demand is made upon it."48 Contrary to the common view, Hegel did not view either social or political freedom as abstractly inevitable. Freedom is real, but conditional in its forms. It is thus an active process rather than a passive series of events. In this way, Hegel provided his sociological followers from Marx to Mannheim with a methodological basis for posing the conditions of man's material freedom, just as Hegel himself had traced the evolution of the idea of freedom as Spirit. To the degree Hegel was concerned with human emancipation, he tried to hold with one rein chariots moving in opposite directions. He hedged on an expansive view of freedom by first identifying freedom with the established political order, and then assuming that such an order is spiritually sanctioned by the gods of reason. In this system, spontaneous social change becomes "the spirit of negation, i. e., the negation of freedom."49 But Hegel, the devoted servant of the concrete, issues into a more sociological concept of freedom than had previously been known in the history of ideas. He filled the issue of freedom with historical detail, while at the same time showing that the context of freedom is social, human, and hence realizable. In so doing he revolutionized the study of freedom by going beyond the psychological frame of reference which had bottled up political theory from Hobbes to Rousseau. Xhat Hegel sought had nothing in common with political quietism. He held that the proper end of men, freedom, can be 48Ueber die neuesten innern Verhaltnisse Wurttemsbergs, Hegel heute, pp. 9-10. 49Philosophy of Right and Law, paragraph 151. It must, however, be recorded that Hegel's opposition to civil conflict and revolution held only where there exists an organic tie between ruler and ruled. Where there "is no constitutional identity between a conquered people and its prince," the situa- tion may warrant uprising. "A rebellion in a conquered province in war is a different thing from a rising in a well-organized state. In such a case, there is only a contract, no political tie. "Je ne suis pas votre prince, je suis votre ma'tre, Napoleon retorted to the envoys at Erfurt."

If the further growth of mankind is our self- declared purpose, freedom is not simply what is desirable but what is necessary. Indeed, Hegel's theory of freedom in its panpsychic immensity easily allows for a chiliastic interpretation. He himself limited such a view by limiting its practical implication to the growth of Germany from absolutism to constitutionalism. But the uses of Hegel's social theories outweigh these pragmatic abuses. It was Hegel who finally separated the issue of political freedom from personal liberty: the moral absolutists on one side and the amoral atomists on the other. In so doing, Hegel, no less than John Stuart Mill, set the terms of discourse for the nineteenth century struggle between liberal and conservative ideologies.</page></plain_text>
