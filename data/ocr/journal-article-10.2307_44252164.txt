<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ü Science, observation and ENTERTAINMENT: COMPETING VISIONS OF POSTWAR BRITISH NATURAL HISTORY TELEVISION, 1946-1967 Gail Davies Popular culture is not the endpoint for the communication of fully developed scientific dis- courses; rather it constitutes a set of narratives, values and practices with which scientists have to engage in the heterogeneous processes of scientific work. In this paper I explore how one group of actors, involved in the development of both postwar natural history tele- vision and the professionalization of animal behaviour studies, manage this process. I draw inspiration from sociologists and historians of science, examining the boundary work involved in the definition and legitimation of scientific fields. Specifically, I chart the insti- tution of animal ethology and natural history film-making in Britain through developing a relational account of the co-construction of this new science and its public form within the media. Substantively, the paper discusses the relationship between three genres of early natural history television, tracing their different associations with forms of public science, the spaces of the scientific field and the role of the camera as a tool of scientific observa- tion. Through this analysis I account for the patterns of cooperation and divergence in the broadcasting and scientific visions of nature embedded in the first formations of the Natural History Unit of the British Broadcasting Corporation. In broadcasters spring 1957 and the scientists previously directed informal at taking collaborations and broadcasting between film naturalists, of ani- broadcasters and scientists directed at taking and broadcasting film of ani- mals for British television were recognized in the establishment of the Natural History Unit (NHU) of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Based in Bristol and self-sufficient, with its own producers, library, film-editing facilities and eight permanent staff, the NHU was charged with supplying the majority of natural history output on the BBC.1 In a paper to the BBC board of man- agement, unit pioneer Desmond Hawkins identified the vision of natural his- Ecumene 2000 7 (4) 0967^4608(00) EU201 OA © 2000 Arnold</page><page sequence="2">Science, observation and entertainment 433 tory television framing their early development. In what has been called 'the most important and influential document in the uniťs history',2 he asserted: The spirit of scientific enquiry must have pride of place. In handling this subject we expose ourselves to the critical scrutiny of scientists, and their approval is an impor- tant endorsement. Moreover, it is their work that throws up the ideas and instances and controversies from which programmes are made. We look to them as contribu- tors, as source material, as consultants, and as elite opinions on our efforts. In short we need their goodwill.3 The choice for head of unit, the ornithologist Bruce Campbell, reinforced an ethos in which scientific skills were valued above broadcasting experience. As Chris Parsons writes in his history of the unit: 'Although he had no experience as a producer, Bruce [Campbell] had shown himself to be truly interested in broadcasting and his impeccable ornithological background, together with his involvement with various naturalist's organisations provided just the right cre- dentials for the leader of the NHU at the time.'4 Certainly, there was competi- tion from other styles of natural history television. Wildlife adventure programmes, previously successful in the cinema; broadcasts of the popular spec- tacles of the zoo; and a scientific vision of nature that emulated the naturalist's lecture all featured in early natural history broadcasts. However, only one genre was widely supported by film-makers and institutionalized within the first for- mations of the NHU: an expert vision of nature that stressed the importance of field observation and scientific interpretations of animal form and function. Through the lens of the NHU, this paper explores how negotiations over the meaning of natural history films were implicated in the co-constitution of post- war broadcasting and natural history sciences. I argue that early natural history television was not the endpoint for the communication of fully developed sci- entific discourses on animal behaviour, but constituted a set of narratives, val- ues and practices with which both scientists and broadcasters engaged. The paper traces relationships between broadcasters, film-makers and scientists simul- taneously involved in the formalization of a unit for the production of natural history films and the establishment of animal behaviour studies as a biological science. From a loose association of individuals interested in the development and communication of natural history, patterns of cooperation and divergence emerge, which can be traced through discussions of the appropriate vehicle for the presentation of natural history on television. This paper examines these com- peting visions of nature as individuals are brought together by a belief in the restorative power of the natural, in the moral value of field observation and in the camera as a tool of science as well as of entertainment. Shared values in the public science of natural history and ethology, an emerging field science for the study of animal behaviour, establish natural history films as boundary objects, ensuring that cooperation is achieved, even though the films have different meanings to participants. The research deals symmetrically with the natural science and cultural pro- duction of natural history film-making, positioning the development of natural history television within accounts of boundary-making practices between nature and culture, expert and lay, subject and object.5 The work speaks theoretically Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="3">434 Gail Davies to a growing dialogue between cultural geography and science studies through its treatment of science as a set of material and social practices located in par- ticular places,6 extending this to argue for the importance of the spaces of pop- ular culture in the constitution of science. I have also drawn productively from recent work on animal geographies which explores the material and symbolic spaces occupied by animals in human culture.7 Woven through accounts of early natural history film-making are reflections on the establishment of a proper loca- tion for understanding animal behaviour, whether that be the zoo, the safari or the field; the moral value attributed to interactions with animals in certain envi- ronments; and the formulation of an appropriate aesthetic regime to represent this in both scientific and public communications. Through its particular focus on the institutional formation of the NHU, a third literature to which this research alludes is that on the development of organizations.8 This reminds us that processes of organization are necessarily heterogeneous, and thus, whilst suggestive of a common myth in the development of early British natural his- tory film-making, this paper does not preclude the importance of other formats for the presentation of animals on television in the later history of the Unit.9 The research draws on a range of interviews and documentary evidence within the NHU, including films, scripts and papers, as well as published accounts of the development of the Unit and biographies of key individuals involved in the multiple contexts of postwar British natural history. The paper is presented as follows. First, I consider research on the role of popular culture in the construction of science, drawing on three modes of boundary work between science and non-science that have proved productive in historical accounts of natural history. Secondly, I discuss the context for the emergence of natural history film-making, and describe conceptions of natural history films from several different but related worlds, including those of the broadcaster, the ethologist and the natural history film-maker. Thirdly, I intro- duce three programme formats illustrating experiments in early natural history programming. I explore how wildlife adventure programmes, outside broadcasts based in the zoo, and the television format of the naturalist lecture are all responses to the challenges and contexts of early natural history film-making. Through their different technologies for filming animals and the narratives used to frame animals and environments, each type of programme suggests a partic- ular model of human and animal interaction and presents a divergent view of nature. The patterns of cen trali ty and marginali ty that emerge within these gen- res of natural history film-making are explored through their intersection with the changing practices of natural history sciences, broadcasting and natural his- tory film-making. Concluding, I reflect empirically on the subsequent develop- ment of the unit and theoretically on the importance of considering the role of the media in the spatialization of differently situated scientific knowledges. Bounding nature: institutional science and popular culture Historians of science have persuasively argued against conceptions of the pop- ularization of science that assume the existence of two independent and mono- Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="4">Science, observation and entertainment 435 lithic cultures - expert and lay - and construct science as a body of pre-estab- lished facts which are communicated to a passive public.10 Shapin, for one, asserts that the professionalization and popularization of scientific knowledges are coterminous.11 Publics are not involved only as audiences for non-contro- versial science constructed in the laboratory, museum or field, but are a con- stitutive part of the processes of producing and negotiating scientific methods and knowledges. On this basis popular culture is not simply the endpoint for a fully developed scientific discourse. Rather, it offers a set of identities, spaces and technologies which scientists have to negotiate in the establishment of sci- entific boundaries, the public legitimation of science and the differentiation of scientific and lay visions of nature. Thomas Gieryn's concept of boundary work captures this process.12 Gieryn explores the processes through which scientists assert the autonomy of scientific practices vis-à-vis applied science or technology, in order to lay claim to fund- ing, whilst simultaneously claiming science as the foundation of technological progress. The notion of boundary work draws attention to the processes through which scientists, science journalists and the other allies define, delimit and defend certain fields; maintaining boundaries between science and non-science, science and technology and different paradigms of science. Scientific work is both heterogeneous and co-operative, and boundary work simultaneously con- nects and differentiates diverse interests within the locations of science, as well as linking core scientific debates to public science metaphors.13 The task of demarcating science from non-science is a social process involving the attribu- tion of selected characteristics to the practitioners, methods, knowledges, values and institutions of science.14 It involves multiple actors engaged in negotiations between different worlds and, as Gieryn indicates, boundary work is complex, contested and contingent.15 Three key modes of boundary work are valuable for understanding relations within the contexts of British postwar natural history: the public presentation of science, the spaces of field observation and the tech- nical objects of scientific practice. An important facet of boundary work is distinguishing science from other activities through advocacy in a cultural space, located a significant distance from the spaces of science.16 Turner identifies public science as 'the body of rhetoric, argument and polemic produced ... to persuade the public or influential sec- tors thereof, that science ... is worthy of receiving public attention, encourage- ment and financing'.17 The process of forging space for new forms of scientific understanding simultaneously involves creating a public form, or public science. This has historically been a literary form.18 The nineteenth century saw an explo- sion in new journals and books about natural history, providing the means of communication between specialities and between men of science and the pub- lic.19 Such communication contexts advocated public support for science and, through the religious, intellectual and utilitarian values claimed for it, distin- guish the identity of amateur and professional. A similar role is played by the boundary work of public demonstration or experiment, which effectively legit- imizes science through a smooth public presentation concealing the untidy craft of the scientist: 'caging Nature's caprices in thick walls of faultless display'.20 Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="5">436 Gail Davies Public science functions as the front stage of scientific professionalisation. As Livingstone suggests, 'the Goffmanesque distinction between front and back regions, between public and private spaces snakes its way through the experi- mental programme more generally'.21 The rhetorical strategies through which public science is presented are impor- tant.22 Following Myers, it is possible to identity the use of both 'narratives of nature' and 'narratives of science' in negotiating scientific value and identity.23 The former are important in legitimating the relative positions of competing scientific paradigms through reference to wider discourses of nature that rein- force the social values of science.24 Boundary work is also achieved through attributing unique characteristics to a scientific identity through narratives of science. In creating the role of natural history professional, the counter-cate- gory of amateur is simultaneously forged through a narrative of science that inscribes intellectual and social boundaries of class and gender.25 This is often pursued in public presentations seeking to fashion a credible scientific identity through using rhetorical devices that displace other actors.26 Secondly, boundary work between science and other activities depends cru- cially on where practices are positioned, and on the spaces privileged for sci- ence. This builds explicitly on geographical interests in the location of science. As Thrift et al. observe, 'the study of science as a social construction has been pursued through a peculiarly spatial imaginary, which always attaches insight to the site. The locales in which scientific knowledge is produced are not seen as passive backdrops, but as vital links in the chain of production, validation and dissemination.'27 Laboratories, field sites, scientific institutes and museums are socially and materially constructed as locations privileged for the practical activ- ities that make and sustain scientific knowledge. Boundary work between sci- entists and publics are embedded in social and spatial relations, both in constructing legitimate locations for scientific observations and in the means of authoritative communication that transcend these sites.28 From an initial focus on the laboratory, sociologists and historians of science are increasingly exploring other sites important in the construction of scientific knowledge including the natural history museum, botanical garden and the varied sites of fieldwork.29 The contested status of the field as a legitimate site for the generation of knowledge about nature is particularly important in the development of the nat- ural history sciences. Field studies have generally had low status within the bio- logical sciences.30 Unlike the laboratory, zoo or museum, the spaces of the field cannot easily be restricted to sanctioned scientists or controlled for experimen- tal conditions. Field studies suffer from accusations of subjectivity, and scientists struggle to enable an authoritative travel of knowledge between the undisci- plined spaces of observation and the point of data analysis. Tensions between field naturalists and cabinet or museum naturalists can be traced from the eigh- teenth century onwards.31 Burkhardt explores the diverse strategies pursued by naturalists from Cuvier, through Yerkes and Tinbergen, to establish the credi- bility of observation in the field for animal behaviour study. He introduces diverse boundary strategies for constructing the scientific field, including estab- Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="6">Science, observation and entertainment 437 lishing the identity of a trustworthy observer, excluding other actors and using scientific instrumentation to assert the credentials of the field as a proper set- ting for the generation of scientific knowledge.32 As indicated above, boundary work also takes places through the negotiation of objects. In their study of the reorganization of ecological research at the Berkeley Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, Star and Griesemer discuss how coop- eration is achieved through practices and objects that have varied meanings to diverse actors of science operating within different worlds. They define bound- ary objects as those 'both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and the con- straints of the several parties employing them, yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites. . . . They have different meanings in different social worlds but their structure is common enough to make them recognizable, a means of translation.'33 Boundary objects account for cooperation between heterogeneous viewpoints. In their study, such objects support the definition and maturing of the different worlds of museum administration, amateur col- lection and research science by standardizing the interfaces between them. The management of diversity proceeds with the use of objects which originate and continue to inhabit different worlds and which incorporate different meanings to make them coherent.'34 Shared goals enable actors investing in the collabo- ration to work together despite their positions in different worlds. In natural history work, boundary objects are produced when sponsors, the- orists and amateurs collaborate to produce representations of nature.35 Their boundary nature is indicated by their existence as concrete and abstract, par- ticular and general, conventionalized and customized. In the representations of twentieth-century natural history, negotiations between actors on the status of visual observation, instrumentation and data recording are frequently articu- lated around the role of the camera. The camera as a boundary object is intro- duced in the work of Latour36 and Winston,37 and illustrated as an important point of negotiation within the complex matrix of science, art, hunting, educa- tion and entertainment in American natural history in the work of both Gregg Mitman and Donna Haraway.38 The primate behaviour films of Clarence Ray Carpenter feature in Haraway's account of the discipline, as film becomes a key component in the development of field primatology. Similarly, Mitman suggests that the camera supports the credibility of field science through enabling obser- vations in the field to transcend the point of observation.39 The power granted to the camera as a scientific tool, able to move between the field site of natural history and the demands of scientific biology, was significant in the development of field animal behaviour studies. 'No longer dependent upon notebook and pencil, the biologist or anthropologist could record movement and behaviours on a medium that could then be transported to the laboratory, where move- ments could be slowed down and behaviour analysed, spliced, and edited.'40 Film offered the opportunity to make the study of animal behaviour in the field more scientific. However, film is also a technology of entertainment, and the use of hoaxing and set-ups to increase the spectacle of early wildlife photography in the United States was rife. Scientific film pioneers such as Carl Akeley at the American Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="7">438 Gail Davies Museum of Natural History set themselves against faking by encouraging asso- ciations with wildlife photographers Martin and Osa Johnson in attempts to secure and standardize film's scientific credentials.41 A reading of the camera's ability to witness animal behaviour had to be sought and could not be assumed. As Haraway concludes, 4 the camera, an eminently democratic machine has been crucial to crafting stories in biology. [However,] its control has eluded the pro- fessional and the moralist, the professional scientists.'42 The apparent accessi- bility of this visual media challenges scientists' need to discipline access to means of representation and secure authority. In the interlinked worlds of field obser- vation and natural history film-making, cameras and film are boundary objects whose stabilization is sought to enable the necessary collaboration between diver- gent worlds. I would assert that these negotiations around public science, the places of science and film as a boundary object could also be traced in the com- plex worlds of postwar British natural history. Television, natural history and natural history television Renewed transmissions of BBC television in 1946 introduced a new opportunity for the communication of ideas and images of animals within an already com- plexly configured space.43 The worlds of broadcasting, biology and natural his- tory in Britain underwent a number of transitions during this period. These contexts were shaped by an influential set of individuals involved in planning, ecology, ethology and broadcasting, moving across disciplinary boundaries more fluid than today. The worlds of professional biology and natural history were relatively close-knit, with amateurs and professionals mixing within clubs and societies, and working together on expeditions, at conferences, editing books and making television programmes.44 These associations, centred on organiza- tions like the British Trust for Ornithology, The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the British Ecological Society and the Royal Zoological Society, were highly influential: for example, in formulating shifts from preservation to con- servation in planning for nature reserves,45 and in rejuvenating field studies for the understanding of whole organisms within the biological sciences. The con- texts for television were equally complex but less well established. Television was relatively experimental in the 1950s, with limited resources and few proven for- mats or experienced staff. Natural history film-makers operated across these worlds, building links within British regional contexts like London, Oxford and Bristol, through shared interests in developing and communicating a particular vision of nature. I now turn to chart these intersections between the visions of broadcasters, ethologists and natural history film-makers: three simultaneously moving targets, each changing shape to effect the position of the others. The broadcaster's vision The 1940s saw wide support for popular natural history, embracing conserva- tion groups, nature photography and film, radio broadcasts and publishing ven- Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="8">Science, observation and entertainment 439 tures.46 The resumption of television broadcasts after the war appeared to offer scope for furthering this. A small group of radio producers, broadcasters and scientists centred around the BBC in Bristol, including Desmond Hawkins, Peter Scott and James Fisher, had already established their reputation for natural his- tory radio through home service broadcasts such as The naturalist (1946), Bird song of the month (1947) and Birds in Bńtain (1951). New ideas on nature and nature conservation were also popularised through publishing innovations like the Collins New Naturalist series.47 The editors of this series, Dudley Stamp, James Fisher, Julian Huxley and John Gilmour, pioneered the publication of books combining the latest scientific research with a popular but unsentimen- tal approach to natural history, based on field study. These books synthesized a British naturalist tradition with new developments in wildlife photography over- seen by Eric Hosking; the artistic modernism of Clifford and Rosemary Ellis's dust jackets; and the developing fields of ecology and ethology. Nature was diverting and healing for a nation recovering from war, reasserting links with the past but also looking to the future. As James Fisher reputedly said to pub- lisher William Collins in 1942, 'What this country needs is a good series of books on natural history to take its mind off the carnage.'48 Natural history combined traditional values of empirical observation and the search for order with an emphasis upon scientific problem-solving, planning and educated citizenship held in high esteem in postwar British culture. Television presented both opportunities and constraints for this public sci- ence of natural history. Broadcasting at the BBC was strongly shaped by the vision of the first director-general after the war, William Haley, who developed radio broadcasts in line with Reith's original intentions to 'inform, educate and entertain'.49 He channelled resources into educational programming, introduc- ing the Third Programme in 1946 and the Reith Lectures in 1948.50 He did offer a supportive slot for natural history radio broadcasts from Bristol, sched- uling them on Sundays after the one o'clock news.51 However, he was less inter- ested in developing the medium of television.52 Television was still unproven in the late 1940s and early 1950s, with restricted signal transmission audiences and limited funding.53 Compared to the large audiences and symbolic national pres- ence achieved by radio during the war, television was a minority concern, with few specialist staff or programming strands. Television focused on emulating radio formats, with live outside broadcasts of national events such as the Olympics, the Proms and the Coronation; competing with cinema for immedi- acy, rather than attempting to emulate the quality of celluloid projections.54 Live television, with its well-lit studios and large unwieldy electronic cameras, was a difficult environment for filming animals. Outside the studio, where develop- ments in lightweight Bolex and Arriflex film cameras had made cine film more portable, there were still technological restrictions. Film stock required large quantities of light, limiting filming to animals active in daylight. Lens magnifi- cations were constrained by technologies in glass lens manufacture, so film-mak- ers had to approach close to the subjects being filmed. Both features in London and regional programming in Bristol endeavoured to overcome these problems, contributing a number of experimental strands and one off programmes. The Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="9">440 Gail Davies BBC also bought in existing film from film-makers previously popular in the cin- ema. However, in the early 1950s the BBC had no formalized policy for the pro- duction of natural history programming. The BBC was, however, motivated by competition as this period progressed. The arrival of commercial Independent Television (ITV) in 1955 meant that British broadcasters sought to exert more direct control over film content and ownership, and to monitor and react to audiences. This was particularly impor- tant following the arrival of the ITV wildlife strand Survival in 1961. ITV broad- casts did not necessitate direct competition over scheduling, but did require the BBC to generate greater flexibility to audiences and better allocation of televi- sion resources. The ITV need to monitor and respond to commercially mean- ingful audience figures put pressure on the BBC to compete for respectable audience share. The BBC's audience research department was introduced in 1955, challenging the autonomy of its educational vision.55 The development and maintenance of programme strands, balancing education and popular influ- ences on programme content, were increasingly organized under the adminis- tration of a 'uniť within the BBC. Units were allotted a certain amount of broadcasting time, whilst producers within the unit were confined to proposals that conformed to the unit's general brief.56 BBC broadcasters recognized the potential for natural history programming, but required a demonstrable track record before committing resources to a unit for this genre. The ethologist's vision The period before and after the Second World War saw development of the two most prominent approaches to the study of animal behaviour developed in the twentieth century - ethology and comparative psychology. Ethologists, such as Konrad Lorenz, Nikolaas Tinbergen and their associates, tended to study birds, fish and insects under field conditions. Their methods involved detailed obser- vations and experiments in nature to reveal innate behavioural patterns related to evolutionary processes. Lorenz laid down many of the theoretical foundations of the new field of ethology through work on captive wild animals, reared in near-naturalistic conditions in a special experimentation station at his home in Austria where he could observe their behaviour closely.57 The Dutch naturalist Tinbergen focused on field observation and experimentation, devising simple problems he could put to animals in the wild without disturbing them un- duly.58 The British naturalist Julian Huxley, himself a pioneer of the meticu- lous observation of birds in their environment, shared their ideals and was influ- ential in bringing this research to the UK.59 Ethologists channelled their work onto the visual sense, and made extensive use of film in research and public presentations of their work.60 Competition for their interpretation of animal behaviour came from comparative psychologists, mainly based in the United States, who largely studied mammals under laboratory conditions and focused on learnt behaviour patterns.61 Both communities of researchers responded to challenges facing animal stud- ies following decline in support for morphological and taxonomie studies and Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="10">Science, observation and entertainment 441 the rise of molecular biological experimental science.62 However, they differed in their practices. Located in the field, classical ethologists worried about the distorting effects on natural patterns of behaviour created by moving animals from nature to the laboratory. Conversely, comparative psychologists were con- cerned about the lack of experimental control in the field, the absence of data analysis and ethologists' failure to consider environmental factors in develop- ment.63 Ethologists had to fight to establish the idea that animal behaviour could best be understood by examining it in its 'natural' surroundings.64 The field as a place of science, the status of the naturalist's vision and the moral value of empirical observation were central to boundaries between the concepts and practices of ethology and comparative ethology. Early ethologists also differed from comparative psychologists in setting great store by their ability to communicate their vision of nature to the public, writ- ing popular books and magazine articles for publications like Country life .65 Tinbergen was 'keen to disseminate his ideas and discoveries about animal behaviour as widely as possible',66 appearing in many films and television pro- grammes. He emphasized this in his teaching: T try to impress on my students that half their work is communication. Science is a social effort, and scientists must adjust to the public.'67 Ethologists recognized the importance of public sci- ence. However, it was not a predetermined scientific vision that was communi- cated. Dominant throughout their public presentations was an emphasis on the wonders of nature, the pleasures to be derived from its study and the impor- tance of fieldwork as the proper location for the study of animal behaviour. Studying nature was also an exercise in accomplishing an ideal society, and field observation was a moral value before it became the hallmark of scientific ethology.68 In most accounts of this period of animal behaviour studies, the vision of ethologists dominates that of comparative psychologists. Dewsbury, for instance, identifies five dimensions in which ethologists could be said to have triumphed: through an evaluation of rhetoric used to describe their achievements; their presence in scientific histories of the period; their relative influence in cognate fields such as psychology; their role in training future biologists; and the 1973 Nobel prize for physiology or medicine awarded to Lorenz, Tinbergen and Karl Von Fisch.69 However, there is often a contradiction within accounts of the dom- inance of the ethologist's vision of nature. Roell, for one, attributes the etholo- gists' success to their adoption of scientific method and experiment.70 In comparison with the laboratory rigour of comparative psychologists, this seems difficult to substantiate. The power of ethology as a new set of practices and interpretative tools for understanding animal behaviour was not simply estab- lished by allying itself to the values of objective science. Ethology is a complex, contingent, historically situated and evolving set of practices and concepts forged by a disparate community of researchers and other allies. In forging this new vision for animal behaviour studies, a key role is played by scientific interactions with the media. Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="11">442 Gail Davies The natural history film-maker's vision In the early 1950s a diverse set of individuals, including many mentioned above, began to experiment with natural history television broadcasts from Bristol. Desmond Hawkins, previously a writer, editor of literary criticism and radio pro- ducer in London, moved to Bristol after the war to take a course in television production and pursue interests in natural history.71 His interests in nature and broadcasting inevitably brought him into contact with the naturalist, painter and broadcaster Peter Scott. Scott had radio and television experience, skills in film- ing and painting wildfowl, and was in the process of setting up the Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge in 1946, just up the Severn estuary from Bristol. They were joined by the studio engineer Tony Soper, one production assistant paid for by television and the assistant film editor belonging to the West Region Film Unit, Chris Parsons.72 These few individuals established links to the worlds of postwar natural history via other naturalists in publishing, conservation and scientific activities. An article on the New Naturalist photographic editor Eric Hosking illus- trates the nature of these informal associations: A chance meeting with the well known ornithologist Guy Mountfort in a BBC studio led to an expedition to Spain in 1956, and every summer since then Hosking has been abroad adding to his already enormous library of bird photographs. The 1956 expedition was Las Marismas of the Coto Donana in Southern Spain, and was led by Guy Mountfort; party members included Lord Alanbrooke, Sir Julian Huxley, Max Nicholson, James Ferguson Lees and James Fisher.73 Early natural history film-makers were later to recruit within these networks; 'the people that were taken on here were great bird-watchers or members of the RSPB or the Entomological Society or Zoological Society.'74 Many of these naturalist film-makers looked to natural history television to Figure 1 ~ Desmond Hawkins interviewing Peter Scott for the Naturalist, 1947 (copyright, BBC Natural History Unit) Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="12">Science, observation and entertainment 443 provide something they had been unable to find within London broadcasting contexts or biological sciences. Hawkins's interests in literature embraced the study of landscape and nature in Hardy, Lawrence and Eliot, but he was frus- trated with the London publishing world. Further, few British universities out- side of Oxford, where Tinbergen established a new programme for animal ethology in 1949, then offered the opportunity to study animal behaviour in the field. As David Attenborough reflects, 'when I emerged from my degree the kind of research I saw going on in zoology in Cambridge was not the kind of behav- ioural ethological research I was interested in ... I didn't want to go back to looking at dogfish in formalin. So I didn't go back to university at all.'75 A shared desire to engage in and communicate a specific form of nature contemplation, stressing the primacy of experience and a moral value for fieldwork, motivated these individuals. However, they struggled with limited staff, experience and resources to commission new material and realise this vision on television. 'Because West Regions' bids were made from premises which were essentially radio-orientated, the means by which it approached the new medium were nec- essarily basic, [and] invariably inventive.'76 Further resources and control could most easily be obtained through the establishment of a centre for the produc- tion of natural history television. A unit status would ensure that commission- ing editors in London were committed to a quota of natural history, allowing scope to define their vision for natural history. However, unable to shoot spe- cially new celluloid footage of animals, they were initially reliant on the use of mobile outside broadcast units and studios at Bristol, or existing sources of film from which to build their reputation. Drawing upon disparate modes of com- munication including the zoo, wildlife safari cinema and naturalist lecture, they nevertheless sought to establish a new unit for the production of natural history programmes which met broadcasting requirements and supported an appro- priate aesthetic, moral and scientific vision for presenting and interpreting ani- mal behaviour. Competing visions of natural history television The first natural history television broadcast after the war was an outside broadcast from Slimbridge in May 1953 presented by Scott and produced by Hawkins.77 This marked the start of a rich period of natural history program- ming dominated by three genres of television. The wildlife series of Armand and Michaela Denis were transmitted from 1954; a variety of programmes fea- turing animals associated with zoos developed from 1954; and the programme strand Look was initiated from Bristol in 1955. This section introduces these three film genres and their relationships within the diverse social, spatial and techni- cal worlds of postwar natural history. Adventures in natural history Nature films, travelogues, scenics and expedition films had been an important Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="13">444 Gail Davies part of non-fiction cinema entertainment since the 1920s. From the incipient days of cinema when Cherry Keaton accompanied Roosevelt on hunting trips to East Africa, wildlife safari films, featuring explorers rather than naturalists, had become popular forms of animal entertainment. These early films marked a shift from big-game safaris to 'hunting with a camera',78 emulating and com- municating the experience of the hunt, but replacing the gun with the camera as the means through which trophies are captured and nature mastered.79 The film-maker is still manly adventurer and hero of empire; indeed, as Carl Akeley put it, 'camera hunting takes twice the man that gun hunting takes.'80 In these films nature is constructed as a primitive wilderness, 'implicated in broader movements to create and preserve a vision of nature as timeless domain for white Euro-American men'.81 The Belgians Armand and Michaela Denis, who started making films for cinema with the Renault-sponsored Wheels across Africa in 1930, brought this for- Figure 2 ~ Armand and Michaela Denis on the front cover of the Radio Times , advertis- ing their series Safari to Asia , 3 December 1960 (copyright, BBC Natural History Unit) Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="14">Science, observation and entertainment 445 mat to BBC television in 1954 with the series Filming wild animals . This husband and wife team focused on the pursuit of animals, composing their films as a quest in which Michaela pursued animals with a still camera and Armand shot their progress using a 16mm portable film camera. The films were located in the national parks and game reserves of East Africa, places forged out of the African landscapes through the preservationist impulses and images of empty wildernesses held by European colonial administration.82 Their carefully scripted narratives revisited these symbolic geographies, traversing bush and hunting- track, culminating in visits to the game warden's garden. The films are con- structed using codes of fiction cinema, allowing the audience to experience the hunt through camera techniques such as point-of-view shots, and with edited sequences of pursuit adding drama to their adventures. They engage viewers through amusing dialogue, reflecting on the excitement and danger of their expeditions and including the non-expert, as the older Armand introduces the younger Michaela to the wildlife of East Africa. Their interpretations of animals are unashamedly anthropomorphic and include the search for such named indi- viduals as the idiosyncratically long-horned rhinoceros, star of the 1958 film Search for Gertie, 83 The following extract, spoken by Armand, accompanied by visuals cutting between the couple filming and close-ups of the rhino, captures something of their style: I never feel at ease on foot approaching a rhino in open country with no protection whatever in case of a charge. A lot of people have got killed that way. I signal to Michaela, This is not the long-horn Gertie. Let us go.' Oh yes, Michaela wants at least one more picture. At last, to my relief, we're on our way back and when we least expect it a long pointed incredibly sharp forward-pointing horn emerges from behind a bush. We've no time to hide, we are at work taking pictures. This is Gertie all right - at last, the legendary Gertie, the most abnormal and freakish rhino horn we have ever seen. She sighs. She is aware of us, but she continues undisturbed. The Denises' films were bought in by the BBC and edited for transmission by producers at Bristol. Over 89 programmes were transmitted, with series like Filming wild animals and On safari running until 1968. Records suggest they were popular with the public: audience shares ranged from 5 to 13%, and audience indices spaned from 65 to 80, attaining levels still considered good for natural history films.84 Their broadcast hours were included in total programme output advancing the productivity of producers in Bristol with controllers in London.85 For the BBC producers, buying in safari films provided access to an established genre of programme-making able to overcome the technological restrictions for filming animals. Animals were relatively easy to film in the open spaces of the Serengeti; many African mammals are active during the day, so filming could take place in good light and game wardens provided access to known haunts of key charismatic animals. These were clearly important films within the broad- casting context of the 1950s. However, they were also criticized. Chris Parsons suggests that the series were 'embarrassingly expensive' and required 'a lot of post-production support' to edit into appropriate length and style for broadcast on the BBC.86 He also Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="15">446 Gail Davies records concern about their content. Some of us were uneasy about the Unit being responsible for the Denis series ... It was undeniable that Armand and Michaela Denis were very popular with viewers and their films frequently contained excellent animal behaviour footage from Africa; but their personality double act - with alternating commentary - together with their 'pets' in the warden's garden routine made some of us uneasy.87 Despite their 'undeniable' popularity and their financial value, they were never central to the way members of the NHU defined their identity. Their programme output and audience ratings supported the productivity required for a unit, but unease with their vision of nature means that they are marginalized in histories of the unit's formation. Explanation can be drawn from the narratives, locations and style of filming in these programmes. The Denises' films were located in environments closely associated with the Victorian pursuit of zoological specimens through hunting88 and the interwar focus on reserving nature for the preservation of game animals.89 The flamboyant and ritualistic hunting with a camera they present was difficult to reconcile with capturing animals on film for the purposes of supporting a modern science of animal behaviour. In their films the camera was positioned within a technological matrix that includes other accoutrements of the safari such as jeep and gun; and the conduct of Armand and Michaela Denis asserts the association of filming with the invasive practices of hunting. The camera's location within a particular hunting nature-culture devalued its status as a scientific instrument, and destabilized the associations with a scientific vision programme-makers were attempting to forge. The view from the zoo The 1950s also saw a proliferation of television programmes showing animals in zoos and studios. The zoo was an obvious site for early wildlife programmes through which captive animals could be incorporated into television pro- grammes through outside broadcast technology. Access to all manner of animals could be guaranteed within the zoo, and 'you could get a signal either into a Post Office or telephone wires or by the radio dish'90 to transmit the images live. This opportunity was widely exploited. The BBC unit for the production of television features in London produced Looking at animals and All about animals with George Cansdale. David Attenborough presented a series of Zoo quests (1954-61) from London studios, interspersing film footage of zoo collecting trips with studio footage, which introduced the animals close up. In Bristol News from the zoos (1959) was presented by James Fisher from a series of European zoos, with World zoos (1961) later extending this format. When ITV transmissions began in 1955, Granada built a studio within London Zoo where they presented Zoo time with Desmond Morris. Perhaps the best-known programme of this type was Animal magic , presented by Johnny Morris from Bristol Zoo in Clifton. This was to be one of the longest-running series for the NHU, transmitted for 21 Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="16">Science, observation and entertainment 447 Figure 3 ~ James Fisher with Bob Veeraswamy and a South American porcupine at Paignton Zoo, filming with an outside broadcast electronic camera for News from the zoos, 22 July 1959 (copyright, BBC Natural History Unit) years, from 1962 to 1983. The format of these programmes varied, but all featured zoo staff and broad- casters presenting animals within zoo enclosures and studios, and most did make 'good' television. As David Attenborough reflects, each week the curator of London Zoo brought a different animal into the studio and put it on a mat. It wasn't much fun for the animals who were plonked under the arc lights, but it was fairly apparent it was good television. The creatures would bite the curator, or relieve themselves down his jacket or escape and need to be chased around the studio.91 Broadcasting from the zoo or studio meant that programme-makers were able to share the visual appeal of exotic animals at the zoo.92 Television programmes also innovated on the spectacle offered by zoos by showing presenters actually interacting with the animals. This tactile encounter with animals is promised at the zoo, where the real event is the physical presence of the animals themselves,93 and zoos do offer opportunities for direct human animal interaction, through animal rides, demonstrations, children's zoos and public feeding. However, presenters, such as Johnny Morris, a radio comedian rather than a naturalist, were able to narrow further the gap between audience and animals. In his performance as zookeeper, Morris touched and interacted Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="17">448 Gail Davies with all manner of animals, shifting back and forth between his own commen- tary and comic voiceovers for the animal's thoughts and conversations, giving voice, character and identity to the animals themselves. Zoo programmes did become popular staples of wildlife television through- out the 1950s and 1960s, but their use became increasingly restricted to the lower budget and production values of children's television.94 The presence of the studio, cameras and people at the zoo, and the light and heat of filming, meant 'natural' animal behaviour could not be captured. The interpretations of animal behaviour chosen by presenters like Johnny Morris again created unease at the NHU; at worst they were seen as sentimental and unscientific anthropo- morphism, at best populist. As Chris Parsons recalls, 4 His anthropomorphism offended some people, but I considered this a fair price to pay if we were able to reach viewers who did not normally watch Look .'95 There was also increasing reluctance from zoos to be involved with this form of television. George Cansdale, presenter of Looking at animais and All about animals and superinten- dent of London Zoo from 1948 to 1953, was one of the first casualties of this shift. In 1953 he was sacked by the council of the London Zoological Society and his job divided between separate departments, reputedly because academic experts and officials at the zoological society disapproved of his tele- vision appearances in which he was seen playing with and cuddling all sorts of animals.96 Natural history programmes from the zoo were located within a complex and ideologically ordered space associated with Victorian developments in tax- onomy.97 Television had innovated on this view of nature through taking out- side broadcast cameras backstage in these places of science, featuring footage of animals out of zoo opening hours, exhibiting unfamiliar behaviour in the stu- dio, or interacting with people and celebrating a tactile experience of animals. The tactile interaction and subjective interpretation of animals presented by Johnny Morris and George Cansdale clashed with the scientific ambitions of men at the Royal Zoological Society and caused discomfort to film-makers in Bristol. As Birke suggests, 'Objective detachment is . . . stereotypically masculine in our culture ... to identify with animals (a more feminine' position) is to cease to be objective.'98 This presentation of animals and people contradicted the mod- ernization of animal studies sought by zoo administrators and broadcasters, posi- tioning the camera as a means of extending the spectacle of the least scientific parts of the zoo experience. This was acceptable for informing children about nature - with its long history of anthropomorphism - but inappropriate for a mature vision of modern natural history television. Emphasis was placed instead on the third strand of wildlife broadcasting, involving a different form of inter- action with animals and drawing upon associations between naturalists and film- makers. A programme of science and observation The third strand of natural history film-making incorporated film footage of ani- mal behaviour into the conventions of the naturalist's lecture. Starting with a Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="18">Science, observation and entertainment 449 number of experimental broadcasts from May 1953, Look was shaped into a series in August 1955 and ran for 15 years until 1969. Look was distinctively subtitled 'a programme of science and observation',99 which differentiated it from enter- taining antics at the zoo or romantic wildlife adventures. This was an approach pioneered by the Bristol producer Desmond Hawkins, as he describes: I suppose the aims I had were to break away from the old sort of anthropomorphic 'Dear Mr and Mrs Blackbird' kind of journalism, you know, that we had before. What I flew at my masthead were the words 'science and observation'. A programme of sci- ence and observation was what we tried to do. If you recall how much of television had been zoo animals, animals in studios, there was no doubt that you were being taken into the wild, that nothing was rigged or cheated and this was a tremendous advantage of course.100 Look aimed to take viewers out of the studio, shunning the showmanship of 'hunting with a camera', to show people a vision of nature untouched by humans emerging from the work of amateur naturalist film-makers and animal behav- iour studies. Look was broadcast live from the studios in Bristol and presented by Peter Scott. At the start of each programme Scott appeared seated behind his desk in a mock-up of the naturalist's study, surrounded by maps, charts, microscopes, field glasses and drawing-boards - props through which he would guide the viewer into new scientific perspectives on animal worlds. In the early pro- grammes he would then move over to the sofa to meet his guest and maker of the film they were to introduce, watch and discuss. He would remove the film from the can, placing it in the projector and cranking the handle; the screen would flicker into life, introducing the latest footage of previously unseen ani- mal behaviour. This programme format drew upon existing film footage, com- bining it with the demands of a live broadcast in the studio, where Scott held the programme together through his discussions with invited experts and draw- ings in the manner of a television lecture. Scott explains the evolution of this format in his memoirs: The pattern of the lecture was a short preliminary talk with drawings and a map fol- lowed by the first reel of film. There was then a short pause while the film reels were changed, during which I progressed the story with more drawings; finally at the end of the second reel of the film there was a brief conclusion. This technique was obvi- ously capable of extension; so that instead of two reels one might have three or four sections of film with spaces for discussion in between them. This would then become more like a lantern slide lecture, but with film inserts instead of slides. Thus was the framework of the television lecture with film established.101 There were few resources to commission these short films. Producers at Bristol worked around these constraints by relying on the skills of amateur naturalist film-makers and scientists already filming animal behaviour. They used personal and professional networks to find people, often of private means, who had the time, skill and enthusiasm to extend the medium of wildlife photography from still to moving pictures.102 As Tony Soper explains, 4 we had to find film for these programmes. And we used to telephone round to Peter Scott's friends, to peo- ple like Eric Hosking, Lord Alanbrooke, people like that. Anyone who'd got an Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="19">450 Gail Davies amateur film camera and did bird films in their holidays mostly.'103 Pioneering film-makers like Heinz Sielmann followed the work of Lorenz, rearing wild ani- mals in near-naturalistic conditions to observe and film their behaviour. Ernest Neal and Eric Ashby specialized in habituating mammal populations to obtain images of badgers and other British mammals. Other film-makers used field skills developed in the pursuit of animals and birds in the practices of European wild- fowling to approach animals unseen. Further film was taken directly from etio- logical studies: Huxley's material of gannets, Fisher's of fulmars and Tinbergen's of herring gulls. Their aim was to inscribe a view of animal behaviour in the Figure 4 ~ Peter Scott on location with the Kodak camera he used to shoot his lecture films, which featured in many of the early editions of Look (copyright, BBC Natural History Unit) Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="20">Science, observation and entertainment 451 field apparently undisturbed by human intervention.104 These early films were rarely made with the primary purpose of transmission on television, and many of them made no concessions to the demands of their new medium of broad- cast. Sequences would be shot from one perspective, often featuring birds on the nest where their appearance could be assured, and transmitted with little editing. The emphasis of the film-makers was 'taking* images of animals rather than 'making' complete films. However, it was these films featuring natural ani- mal behaviour captured in the field, their narratives, locations and film-making practices on the boundaries between television and science, which were most actively supported by pioneering natural history film-makers at the BBC. The public science of Look supported the construction of the field as a site for the study of animal behaviour and the camera as a scientific method of recording animal movement. The presentation of film footage within the natu- ralist study affirms the authority of the camera as a scientific device with a sta- tus similar to the charts, maps and field glasses which surrounded Scott. The presentations of Scott differ from the anthropomorphic humour of Armand and Michaela Denis or the close identification with animals of Johnny Morris. His presentation of the trustworthy, gentlemanly identity of the naturalist reinforced his position as a credible spokesperson for science.105 His introductions to the films structured the programme in the manner of a scientific text, 4 a visual set of inscriptions produced by the instrument and a verbal commentary uttered by the scientist.'106 Television programmes were able to make links between field, film and the practices of science that were difficult to achieve within the textual form of scientific articles. Their techniques of film montage cut between the empirical and abstract; 'the world of visible organisms and the unseen structures of information proposed in the theoretical model are seamlessly linked, literally in one line.'107 The legitimacy of these recordings of animal behaviour is further underlined by the processes and locations of filming. The animal's image is captured, but since the presenter stands outside the film no power is seen exercised over the animal. The naturalist film-maker looks but, unlike the hunter or the zookeeper, does not touch, and the images produced are thus able to transcend the moment of recording, universalized as natural behaviour. The camera constructs a land- scape in which animal behaviour can be witnessed, but which is empty of human disruption. Without visible evidence of the complex connections between humans and animals in the urban zoo or the construction of exotic wilderness of east Africa, such sites could be coded as places for the professionalization of a modern biological science and as appropriate spaces for forging a new, for- ward-looking language for natural history television. Scientists and film-makers were brought together by the shared practices of detached observation, rein- forcing the scientific status of ethology and realizing film-makers' vision for pub- lic natural history. However, this was not a popular science, for this public vision of nature divides expert and lay access to knowledge. The public presentations of etiological science in Look reinforced 'the critical boundary between watch- ing and witnessing, between who is a scientist and who is not, and between pop- ular culture and scientific fact'.108 The move away from images of animals at the Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="21">452 Gail Davies zoo, where animals could be seen interacting with presenters, meant that the spaces where viewers could see themselves within natural history programmes were devalued. With the subsequent disappearance of Armand and Michaela Denis from the screen, it would be many years before women were again fronting natural history programmes as credible spokespersons for animal behaviour. The stunning sequences of natural history behaviour in Look presented a view of nature only available to the specialist naturalist, ornithologist or film-maker. While natural history audiences could enjoy these, they were not experiences that many could empathize with or would seek for themselves. The filming techniques and format pioneered by Look provided many suc- cessful films in the 1950s and 1960s for the NHU. Natural history footage from further afield was shown in Look and Faraway look , often featuring specially com- missioned material from increasingly professional wildlife cameramen like Sielmann, Ron Eastman and Roger Jackmann. The academic format of natural history was developed in the series Life , presented by Desmond Morris, a for- mer student of Tinbergen. There were collaborations with organizations like Oxford Scientific Films, linked to Tinbergen's Oxford programme of ethology, who were influential in developing high-magnification wildlife films for the study of insect behaviour. During the late 1950s producers at Bristol decided they could no longer use material filmed by naturalists or scientists with no conces- sions to television, concluding: 4 We should tailor our films to suit the medium.'109 As Chris Parsons observed, T was saddened by the realisation that this was prob- ably the last time we would be able to use this great man's work [Viscount Alanbrooke], for his interest was in taking film of birds rather than making films about birds.'110 However, the ethos of detached observation, field studies and scientific vision in programmes like Look and the associations between film-mak- ing and science forged were taken forward into core definitions of the NHU for natural history film-making at the BBC. They still endure in discussions at the unit today, supporting the lingering public service broadcasting remit of the BBC, and upholding a commitment to naturalism, the key to authority of this natural history form. As one of the longest-serving members of the Unit sug- gested: We've always had a good relationship with the scientific world. . . . And therefore, there was a sense of integrity, about our films which hopefully, you know, is not too badly strained even today. We haven't been making fairy stories. We haven't been making Disney films.111 Conclusion These three programme formats, transmitted concurrently, represent different points of intersection between the worlds of postwar television and natural his- tory, entertainment and science. All are innovative responses to the challenge of finding places for filming animals in early television, and all play an impor- tant role in establishing multiple resources for the institution of a designated unit for natural history presentations. Yet not all are privileged as places for con- structing new knowledge about animals in postwar natural history. Their narra- Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="22">Science, observation and entertainment 453 tives of nature, science and adventure bisect attempts publicly to warrant the science of ethology and the moral values of field observation. Their location within the national parks of East Africa, the zoo and field are sites shared in the search for appropriate ways of filming animals for television programmes and studying animal behaviour. Each film location has a distinct geography involv- ing different configurations of film-maker, broadcaster, scientist and animal, and constitutes a particular 'culture of nature'.112 Different techniques of filming are used to incorporate images of animals into the worlds of television, only one of which constructs a credible spokesperson for nature in the practices of early ethology. The camera and film act as boundary objects between these practices, tying together diverse interests within these sites. Both the representational prac- tices of television and science are important in understanding how certain films became both research tool and structuring metaphor in the production of ani- mal behaviour research and the formations of early natural history television. Only the practices and presentations of public science in programmes like Look are capable of bringing together the diverse desires of film-makers and etholo- gists. Through appeal to new forms of communication in the mass media, a vision of nature could be simultaneously professionalised and popularized. Early ethol- ogists look to the media to legitimate and support their science of animal behav- iour study. By positioning animal films as a way of moving between detached observation in the field and the public realms of science, a scientific view of ani- mal behaviour could be universalized: the media 'publicly warranting that the knowledge produced in such places was reliable and authentic'.113 The status of the field as scientific site and the use of film to move from field to study are mutually constituted - to establish a scientific identity for the field and the cam- era as an instrument of field science requires publicly attributing objective ideals to both at the same time.114 The need to legitimate the scientific credentials of these concurrently is a driving motivation for the ethologist's appeal to the pub- lic, outside the normal channels of science. The BBC had established a reputa- tion for educational programming, and with prior experience of natural history radio offered institutional veracity to its presentations of animal life: 'institutions play a crucial role in formulating boundary objects which allow for stable trans- lations.'115 At Bristol they found a group of film-makers who shared their ethic of close detachment and observation for nature, their view of the moral value of field experience, and a scientific and educational vision for the television cam- era. Producers at Bristol had come into natural history film-making, marginal- ized from the cultures of London broadcasting or seeking refuge from the increasingly mechanical objectivity demanded by molecular biology. In their desires to institute a unit for natural history film-making they were prepared to draw upon a range of television genres to fill schedules and support audience ratings, but consistently sought to formalize an ethos around etiological metaphors for understanding animal behaviour. The collaboration was mutually beneficial to the personal and professional satisfaction of individuals inhabiting both worlds. The meanings attributed to these films and the purposes intended in their Ecumene 2000 7 (4)</page><page sequence="23">454 Gail Davies transmission differed, and were progressively to diverge from the late 1950s onwards. However, their narratives of nature form the basis of the productive collaboration between scientists and film-makers that has permeated the devel- opment of natural history film-making in Britain. The analysis offered here sug- gests this association supported the nature of the field as a scientific research site. It furthers recognition that the field is best understood as a heterogeneous and porous domain of scientific activity, involving multiple negotiations of many kinds between professionals and amateurs, by extending this analysis to include role of television natural history films. Analysis of these programmes as bound- ary objects deepens our understanding of how film simultaneously manages to advocate the primacy of experience whilst successfully excluding popular expe- riences and other knowledges of nature. Through exploring these relations from the perspective of the media, this paper has suggested that visualizations of nature are not simply pioneered in an expert realm to be picked up and pop- ularized in the public sphere. The technologies, locations, rhetorics and insti- tutional associations of competing visions of nature both define and re-create boundaries between expert and popular understandings of the natural world. Non-scientific institutions play an important role in the practices of knowledge- making, shaping the geographies of both scientific and popular knowledge pro- duction. Geographers have much to contribute to exploring the plural and contested sites involved in the making of science, tracing how diverse contexts and situations traditionally located 'outside' scientific work are articulated within it. Whilst historians and sociologists of science are increasingly attending to the articulation of science with its public dimension, less well observed are the strug- gles over these forms of expertise within the contested spaces of popular cul- ture. This paper has been concerned to chart the dynamics between scientific and popular forms of knowledge within early natural history film-making, but many of the cultural spaces of postwar television and science remain to be explored.

In 1950 the television signal only covered 33-50% of the British population, focused on London, the south-east and six other major cities, and broadcasting was limited to 30 hours a week. By 1953 only around 1 million television licences had been sold at a cost of £1 each: Cain, The BBC, p. 63. 54 Parsons, True to nature , p. 27. For example, television news began simply as a read- ing of the news with no presenter in vision; pictures did not accompany news bul- letins until July 1954: Cain, The BBC , p. 64. 55 For further information on the role of audience measures in shaping broadcasting output, see I.

The BBC's audience research department was introduced after 1955 to monitor the number of people who had seen a programme, counting in total those who had watched more than half of a given programme. They also established a numerical code or percentage indices for measuring audience appre- ciation, using structured questionnaires to gauge how educational and interesting the audience found each programme. 85 Parsons, True to nature , p. 70. 86 Ibid. y p. 72. 87 Ibid. 88 Ryan, Pictuńng empire, p. 99. 89 Neumann, 'Dukes, earls and ersatz Edens'. 90 John Sparks, series producer, Natural History Unit, interviewed 13 June 1995. 91 Quoted in an interview with David Attenborough in the Independent Magazine (29 Sept. 1990), p. 48. 92 J.

This advance was no sudden change in my outlook. I was still too much captivated by the ritual aspects of wildfowling to give it up altogether. So many things went with the actual shooting - the beauty, the natural history, the exercise, the memories, and particularly the technical skills which in the course of years I had acquired': Scott, Eye of the wind , p. 173. 105 Shapin, 'Placing the view from nowhere', p. 8. 106 Latour, Science in action , p. 71. 107 G.

The Collins New Naturalist series had pioneered the extensive use of modern photo- graphic techniques in the production of these popular field guides to natural his- tory. However, other natural history field guides were very slow to adopt such new techniques, suggesting that the camera took a long time to be accepted as the main form of scientific form of animal representation. The first Audubon field guide to use photographs of birds rather than paintings and drawings was not issued until 1977. B. Winston, 'The documentary film', p. 39. 115 F. Harvey and N.
