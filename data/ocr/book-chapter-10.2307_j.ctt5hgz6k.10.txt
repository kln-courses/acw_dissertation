Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and  Loritja of Central Australia On the 23 December 1871 in a little village called Fredersdorf in Northern  Germany, Carl Friedrich Theodore Strehlow was born as the seventh child of  the village school teacher (Liebermeister 1998: 16). Carl grew up in modest  circumstances that offered few opportunities. In the Germany of the late  nineteenth century, clerical institutions were the only source of education for  the talented poor. The Lutheran Seminary at Neuendettelsau where Carl trained  offered a rich and intense intellectual grounding for the bright and gifted  student. As Carl Strehlow was finding a calling that would take him to the  remotest place on earth – as Europeans imagined it – the world in which he  would spend 30 years was being uprooted.  At the time, the Overland Telegraph Line was making its way north traversing  traditional Aboriginal countries in central Australia. In just a very few years,  this initiative was followed by the Lutheran missionaries, A.H. Kempe and  W.F. Schwarz. In 1877, they built a small mission settlement at Ntaria, a sacred  site associated with the ratapa dreaming.1 The missionaries called this mission  ‘Hermannsburg’ in recognition of the seminary that had trained them. Their  journey from Bethany in South Australia to the centre of Australia had lasted  nearly 18 months because they had been travelling with an entourage consisting  of 37 horses, 20 cattle and nearly 2000 sheep (Leske 1977, 1996; Scherer 1963;  Harms 2003). Not long after their arrival Kempe and Schwarz were joined by  Louis and Charlotte Schulze (nee Gutmann), and their future wives Dorethea  (nee Queckenstedt) and Dorethea (nee Schulz), who were the first European  women to settle in central Australia.  One year after the missionaries’ arrival in 1878 a group of Western Aranda  men led by Nameia2 returned from a long revenge expedition into the southern  territories of the Matuntara and must have observed with great surprise and  indignation ‘the first structures erected at Hermannsburg’ that ‘greeted their  eye’ (Strehlow 1970: 125). These were not the only wary or hostile eyes trained  on the missionaries. By 1879 the mission lease was surrounded by squatters who  were backed by local police (Hartwig 1965; Donovan 1988: 60, 87). Both groups  tended to disparage the missionaries.  1 See Carl Strehlow (1907: 80–81; 1908: 72 f.3; 1911: 122–124) and T.G.H. Strehlow (1971: 758). 2 Nameia was murdered in 1889 at constable William Willshire’s police camp on the Finke River. It seems the  murderers were never identified with certainty (Nettelbeck and Foster 2007: 71–73). See also T.G.H. Strehlow’s  Journey to Horseshoe Bend (1969). 15 </page> <page sequence="4"> The Aranda’s Pepa 2. Map of route of the Lutheran missionaries to Hermannsburg.

They also  began their crusade to evangelise the indigenous people who chose to stay  temporarily at the new settlement. This proximity allowed the Lutherans to  begin their study of language and culture. The missionaries called these people  Aldolinga meaning ‘from the west’. However, the progress in spreading the  gospel among the ‘Aldolinga’ was slow and life on the frontier incredibly harsh  due to droughts, isolation, disease and the aggression of other white settlers. By  1891 the little mission was abandoned, the missionaries had been defeated by  the challenges and the loss of their families (Austin-Broos 1994: 132).  16 </page> <page sequence="5"> I . Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and Loritja of Central Australia The Aranda and Kukatja-Loritja peoples Carl Strehlow’s ethnographic data relates mainly to two distinct groups whom he  broadly labelled Aranda and Loritja in the title of his publication, although these  names can also be used for other neighbouring groups. One was an Arandic group  and the other was a Western Desert group that did not display all the typical features  of a Western Desert culture due to social and environmental circumstances.  Carl Strehlow refers often to the Western, North-Western, Eastern and Southern  Aranda in his writings, but he does not define exactly where their territories  lie; and on his map (1910) he shows language and dialect distribution rather  than territories belonging to particular groups. He placed the western Arandic  language, Aranda Ulbma, on the upper Finke River, roughly between the  MacDonnell and James Ranges (including Hermannsburg Mission), the Aranda  Roara between the eastern part of the MacDonnell Ranges and James Ranges  including Alice Springs, the Aranda Lada from approximately Henbury along  the Finke River and the Aranda Tanka between Charlotte Waters and Oodnadatta  along the lower Finke River. His son, T.G.H. Strehlow (1971: xx), wrote that Carl  Strehlow’s information came mainly from the north-western and Hermannsburg  sectors of the Western Aranda area. The Arandic group whose culture Carl Strehlow documented in great detail  identify themselves today as Western Aranda or Arrarnta. They call themselves  sometimes ‘Tyurretyerenye’, meaning ‘belonging to Tyurretye’, and refer  to their Arandic dialect as Western or ‘Tyurretye Arrernte’ (Kenny 2010: 6).  Their ancestors lived in an area bounded roughly in the north by the Western  MacDonnell Ranges (Strehlow 1907: 32, 42; T.G.H. Strehlow 1971: 670, note  19)3 that separates them from the Anmatyerr and Northern Aranda peoples. In  the south, their country stretches along the Finke River past the James Range,  to the countries of Southern Aranda and Matuntara peoples. To the west, it  extends to the Derwent River and to the east it abuts the territory of today’s  Central Arrernte people (see also T.G.H. Strehlow 1947: 59).  3 Tjoritja (Tyurretye) was not only the name for the MacDonnell Ranges, but also for Alice Springs which  lies in the MacDonnell Ranges. Carl Strehlow also wrote that ‘Lately, Alice Springs has been called Kapmanta;  kap is an abbreviation of kaputa = head, and manta = dense. Kapmanta literally means: dense head. What it  refers to are the roofs close together (roof = head of the house) because here the natives had first seen roofs of  corrugated iron’ (Strehlow 1907: 42). 17 </page> <page sequence="6"> The Aranda’s Pepa 3.

Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and Loritja of Central Australia For the Aranda, first contact with the newcomers occurred in the early 1860s  when John McDouall Stuart was trying to find his way to the northern coast  of the continent via the inland (Strehlow 1967: 7–8). Owen Springs was central  Australia’s first pastoral station, and the indigenous people who resided between  that station and Ntaria would certainly have encountered the cattlemen and  other explorers who passed that way in the early 1870s (Austin-Broos 1994:  131). Ernest Giles, for example, seems to have recorded the first Western Aranda  word, ‘Larapinta’, the name of the Finke River, on the 28 August 1872:  Soon after we had unpacked and let go our horses, we were accosted by  a native on the opposite side of the creek. Our little dog became furious:  then two natives appeared. We made an attempt at a long conversation,  but signally failed, for neither of us knew many of the words the other  was saying. The only bit of information I obtained was their name for  the river – as they kept continually pointing to it and repeating the  word Larapinta. (Giles [1889] 1995: 8)  The country of the Western Aranda is of a rare beauty, painted by Albert Namatjira  (1902–1959), and other artists of the watercolour school of Hermannsburg, who  still capture in their art the river systems, magnificent gum trees, gorges, rocky  valleys and the creeks that emanate from the aged ranges. The area is one of the  best-watered parts of central Australia. This automatically resulted in conflict  between the indigenous people and the new settlers. 4. Image of central Australia.

Naturally the local people reacted, as their waterholes were being destroyed  and contaminated by these new animals. A kind of partisan war broke out. The  cattle killings were answered by shootings. As the scarce desert resources were  fouled by stock, droughts set in and the aggression towards the indigenous  population increased, Aranda people drifted to the Hermannsburg Mission that  offered easy rations and some safety (see also Morton 1992: 52). Life on the  mission was fraught with difficulties for the Aranda. They were crowded into a  small area that many of them once would have visited only occasionally, if at all.  By the time Carl Strehlow arrived at the mission the Aranda had been largely  pacified, although there remained pockets of resistance that annoyed the local  police as well as Strehlow. The cattle spearing affected the mission by dragging  Strehlow into court to address ‘partisans’ who lived on the mission lease, or  mission cattle speared by these or other groups.4  The people living to the immediate west of the Western Aranda called themselves  Kukatja or Loritja at the turn of the twentieth century. Today they call themselves  Luritja or Kukatja-Luritja when referring to their ancestry and history.5 The  Kukatja may have heard of the newcomers from their eastern and southern  neighbours. We cannot know, but at the very latest they would have encountered  Europeans when the exploring parties of Ernest Giles in 1872, and William Christie  Gosse in 1873, pushed into the Centre and traversed parts of their territory.   The country of the Kukatja-Loritja lies to the west of the Derwent River  which marks broadly the language border between them and the Aranda. This  language boundary sometimes determines how people perceive their country  and often describe the border area as ‘mix-up’ country, referring to the fact that  a number of places have both Loritja and Aranda names and that there is no  clear cut border between them. Róheim (1974: 126) called these people ‘Lurittya  Merino’, and noted that they were seen as ‘half Aranda’. People who belong to  this border area are still today fluent speakers of both Aranda and Loritja and  share ancestors as well as traditional laws and customs (Kenny 2010).   Carl Strehlow remarked that the people whom the Aranda called ‘Loritja’,  referred to themselves as ‘Kukatja’ (Strehlow 1907: 57, Anmerkung 9). According  to T.G.H. Strehlow ‘Loritja’ was the Aranda name applied to all Western speech  groups (Strehlow 1947: 177–178). The people themselves refused this designation  and used instead ‘Kukatja, Pintubi, Ngalia, Ilpara, Andekerinja, etc’. According  to Tindale, the name ‘Luritja’ had a negative connotation with the result that  4 Carl Strehlow’s letters to his superior Kaibel held at the Lutheran Archives, Adelaide often describe the  court dealings and cattle killings which he grudgingly had to tend to. See Vallee (2006) and Nettelbeck and  Foster (2007) on frontier conflict in this region. 5 There is a distinct group of people living at Balgo in Western Australia who are also called Kukatja. 20 </page> <page sequence="9"> I . Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and Loritja of Central Australia Kukatja people asked him to call them ‘Kukatja’ rather than ‘Luritja’ (1974:  229). In his monumental Aboriginal Tribes of Australia he used Kukatja and  placed them ‘west of the Gosses Range and Palm Valley on the south of the  MacDonnell Ranges; south west to Lake Amadeus, George Gill Range, Cleland  Hills (Merandji), Inindi near Mount Forbes, and Thomas Reservoir (Alala): on  upper Palmer, Walker, and Rundall creeks’ (Tindale 1974: 229).  Over the course of time Luritja has become a linguistic and cultural self-label  despite its foreign origin for a number of peoples. By the 1960s people preferred  to refer to themselves as ‘Luritja’ and today ‘Luritja’ remains a broad term that  can be used interchangeably with other Western Desert labels (Smith 2005: 73).  ‘Kukatja’ and ‘Mayutjarra’, for example, are recognised by middle aged and elderly  speakers as being equivalent to the new label, ‘Luritja’ (Holcombe 1998: 217).   Additional confusion surrounding the language and group label ‘Luritja’ is  a result of migration towards the south by Ngaliya Warlpiri, Pintupi, Jumu  or Mayutjarra and Kukatja peoples (see Holcombe 1998: 217). Some of these  groups refer to themselves as ‘Luritja’. The movements of ‘Luritja’ groups have  been mainly caused by the disruptions of the past 100 years which included  epidemics and environmental stress such as drought and starvation. According  to Tindale, for example, a group called ‘Jumu’ or ‘Mayutjarra’ was decimated by  an epidemic in the 1930s. Following their extinction Pintupi and Ngalia Warlpiri  people moved into their vacated country (Tindale 1974: 138, 227–228). Smith  writes that the Kukatja were on the move to the east and south by the late 1880s  (Smith 2005: 1). This chain migration of desert people into the settled districts  took several generations to run its course.   During Carl Strehlow’s time, Kukatja-Loritja people belonging to the area  immediately to the west of Aranda territory moved south-eastwards towards  the Hermannsburg Mission (see Leske 1977: 26–27; Smith 2005). When the  explorer Winnecke passed through the general area in 1894, he still encountered  ‘sandhill tribes’ living west of Hermannsburg (Winnecke 1897: 37), who were  presumably Kukatja. Their eastward migration intensified with the onset of  a major decade-long drought in 1895 (Smith 2005: 29) and throughout the  1920s, the Kukatja people moved through the frontier to resume contact with  relatives at the mission and on the outlying pastoral properties (Smith 2005:  51; Holcombe 1998: 26). The missionaries were aware of ‘a vigorous tribe just  west of Hermannsburg’ with a large population,6 and in the late 1920s, plans for  Aranda evangelists were made to take their message to these groups.  6 Lutheran Herald, 26.10.1921: 114. 21 </page> <page sequence="10"> The Aranda’s Pepa 22 5.

Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and Loritja of Central Australia The location of the ‘Kukatja’ area today is understood as being along the western  edge of Western Aranda territory.7 T.G.H. Strehlow has maintained that Kukatja  land stretched from the western border of Western Aranda westwards to Mt  Liebig and Putati spring (1970: 110). Heffernan describes a current perception  of the territory that was owned by Kukatja:   The Kukatja (as distinct from the people of the same title living at Balgo  in Western Australia) lived in the country west of Glen Helen Station  (Ungkungka) along the tail of the Western MacDonnell ranges through  to Mt Liebig, south to Gosses Bluff, the Gardiner Range and then out  to Mt Peculiar and Mt Udor. The country includes such prominent  communities as Papunya, Haasts Bluff, Umpangara and Mt Liebig.  (Heffernan and Heffernan 2005: 4) Pre-contact, Kukatja-Loritja culture was strongly influenced by Western Aranda  traditional laws and customs and vice versa (Strehlow 1947). When white  settlement destabilised desert life, they moved into the Hermannsburg Mission  and the Aranda influence on Kukatja ways would have become more intense.  Heffernan and Heffernan write about the Kukatja:  Because these people lived on the fringe of Arrernte country, they  moved into Hermannsburg very early on (for reasons that were  important to them at the time – easy food is one most frequently given).  A good number of their descendants today live in outstations west of  Hermannsburg, and in the Papunya region. They instinctively refer to  themselves today as Arrernte or Luritja and only as Kukatja on the basis  of ancestry. (Heffernan and Heffernan 2005: 4–5)  Today the cultures of Western Aranda and Kukatja-Luritja people have many  features in common. This is not surprising, given their close relationships that  involve joint ceremonies, intermarriage and an overlapping land tenure system  (Strehlow 1908, 1913; T.G.H. Strehlow 1947, 1965, 1970; Kenny 2010) as well as  a shared environmental space – the well-watered range system. In more recent  times, commonalities have been re-enforced not only at Ntaria but also at other  settlements including Haasts Bluff, Mt Liebig and Papunya.  Carl Strehlow’s life and work in Australia Carl Strehlow arrived in Australia in 1892, not long after graduating from the  Neuendettelsauer seminary in southern Germany. His first posting was the  7 Stirling had noted in 1894 that ‘the territory of the Luritchas marches on the western boundary of Aruntas, and  comprises the country about Erldunda, Tempe Downs, Gill’s Range, Mereenie Bluff and Glen Helen’ (Stirling 1896: 11). 23 </page> <page sequence="12"> The Aranda’s Pepa Bethesda Mission at Lake Eyre in South Australia. The moment he arrived at  the mission, he showed interest in the language of the local people. Within  six months he spoke Diyari (Schild 2004a: 55) and by the end of 1894, with  J.G. Reuther, he had translated the New Testament into Diyari. It was called  Testamenta marra, published in 1897. In October 1894 at the age of 22 he was transferred from Bethesda to Hermannsburg  in remote central Australia. He arrived at the abandoned mission station with two  fellow missionaries, Reuther and Linke. His first impressions of the Hermannsburg  Mission were not favourable because the small congregation had dispersed:   I was disappointed ... It was very hurtful to see the jewels of a mission  station, the little church and school, fallen into disrepair ... There was  not one Christian to welcome us like at Bethesda. Only a few naked  heathens looked at us in amusement when we arrived.8  6. Carl Strehlow’s ‘Aussendungsphoto’, 1892.

Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and Loritja of Central Australia He stayed for nearly three decades at this place. He ran it as a mission and a cattle  and sheep station, providing pastoral care for more than 100 Aboriginal people  who became Christians, as well as a large number of their relatives who lived on  the fringes of the mission. At the same time he was keeping aggressive pastoralists  at bay and dealing with a range of social issues that had been caused by the forcing  together of different Aboriginal groups. Some Western Aranda and Kukatja at  Hermannsburg, for example, had been enemies for a long time (Strehlow 1947: 62).   These local arrangements were extraordinary. Hermannsburg was the largest  settlement in central Australia, bigger than Alice Springs. The people living at  the mission were not a group that traditionally would have lived there together  for extended periods. The mission created a completely new setting for the  indigenous population who were hunters and gatherers. They must have tried  to accommodate this situation by activating, reconciling and adapting every  imaginable tie to country and kin. It is likely that tensions emerged between the  actual local group of Ntaria and other mission inhabitants from neighbouring or  far-flung countries. The situation therefore would not have favoured traditional  territorial organisation.   Administrative work for both church and state were also a part of Carl Strehlow’s  duties. He became the postmaster, Justice of the Peace and contributed to the  school by developing curricula, translating hymns to the music of Bach, and  preparing lessons in Aranda. His work at Hermannsburg would bring him into  conflict with pastoralists, the police, governments, the British anthropological  establishment and even his own church.  The young man was soon left to his own devices by Reuther and Linke who  returned south. Despite the desolate conditions of the mission, Strehlow started  rebuilding it with great enthusiasm, not least motivated by the prospect that his  young fiancée Friedericke Johanna Henriette Keysser would be arriving within  the year. Their courtship is documented in endearing epistles that travelled  between central Australia and Germany. The complete correspondence9 has  survived and gives a unique insight into their relationship (Brandauer and Veber  2009: 113–127). From Hermannsburg, Carl wrote to Frieda about every detail  that she would encounter. Her future home, the surrounding landscape and the  palm garden behind the house – which he considered the ‘most beautiful place  in the whole of the Northern Territory’10 – were familiar to her when she arrived  at the mission. He wrote:   My dearest loved Frieda! ... Now you may want to know more about  Hermannsburg, where, so God will, we shall find our home. The area  around the station is prettier than around Bethesda.

Not far to the north you see a long, high range,  with some mountains in its foreground, that is the MacDonnell Range.  When you move to the next window with me, looking to the south,  you can overlook our gardens that are quite big. You can see the date  palms, the peppertrees and some pomegranate trees in bloom now, the  red blooms are wonderful. ... There is also a gazebo in which we will be  sitting comfortably and chatting intimately in the cool evenings. Beyond  the garden lies the Finke River, but no water is flowing in it, only  some gumtrees are growing in it. Behind the Finke rise steep and high  mountains, which are only sparsely vegetated with grass and flowers.11  The young couple had only met once in a three-day encounter during Easter  1892 (Brandauer and Veber 2009: 114), just before Carl had left for his Australian  calling. It was love at first sight. Three years would pass until they met again  after a long and protracted battle with her guardians. Her letters to him shared  his passion and enthusiasm. About their first meeting she writes:   When you looked at me with those blue eyes, I knew, that you loved  me. When you had left that day, I just wanted to cry and cry, but I was  not permitted to let anyone know... But now you are mine after a long  battle. If it were only my decision, I would come sooner to you.12   Frieda was looking forward to her new life and adventure in Australia, which  her imagination clothed in a romantic haze. In her letters she discussed with  her future husband her dowry which included measured curtains for their  home. Travelling from Germany, Frieda, 19 years of age, joined Carl in 1895.  The voyage to the Centre in the early summer was an ordeal. The heat, the flies  and discomfort of the travel were unbearable. In addition she suffered from  excruciating toothaches. Her luggage with the curtains for the house arrived  months later leaving her without the essentials for her new life.  Despite the inconveniences, Frieda embraced her role as a missionary’s wife. She  started to learn Aranda, teach the women household skills intended to improve  health and elevate living standards, and had six children at the Hermannsburg  Mission. Her first child Friedrich was born in 1897, her only daughter Martha  in 1899, Rudolf in 1900, Karl in 1902, Hermann in 1905 and her youngest son  Theodore, who would later become one of the most controversial figures in  Australian anthropology, in 1908. Together Carl and Frieda made Hermannsburg  a refuge for the local people and fought for their physical and mental survival.  By 1912 the efforts of the Strehlows were obvious. Carl was able to report:  11 Carl Strehlow to Frieda Keysser, 12 .11.1894.  12 Frieda Keysser to Carl Strehlow, 22.7.1894.  26 </page> <page sequence="15"> I .

Source: Strehlow Research Centre, Alice Springs (SRC 5835). Carl Strehlow started work on language and translation immediately. His  fluency in Diyari and the bible translation facilitated his acquisition of the local  languages, Aranda and Loritja. His previous experience is likely to have helped  him grasp the intellectual concepts of the Aranda and Loritja at Hermannsburg.  He was also able to draw on language materials compiled by his predecessor  missionaries, Kempe and Schulze. He became fluent in Aranda within months  and preached in the vernacular. In 1896 only two years after his arrival on  Aranda territory, Strehlow’s Aranda was so good that Gillen, who had been  living among Arandic peoples since 1875, used his services as a translator for  his anthropological research in Hermannsburg (Mulvaney, Morphy and Petch  [1997] 2001: 118–119). In 1899 Strehlow supplied some information on Aranda  kinship terms and subsection systems to Otto Siebert and Howitt.13  In 1904 Carl Strehlow published an Aranda Service Book, Galtjindintjamea- Pepa Aranda Wolambarinjaka which included 100 German hymns translated  into Aranda and some of them set to Bach’s church music. This work was  partially based on that of his predecessor Kempe and the assistance of Aranda  13 Otto Siebert to A.W.

On the other hand, Tjalkabota was one of the main  informants for Strehlow’s ethnographic oeuvre and had been initiated. At the  end of 1904, Strehlow’s future editor, von Leonhardi, who had some queries on  religion, offered to publish anything that Carl might write. Although Strehlow  had already collected some material on mythology14 and collated an extensive  wordlist of Aranda, Loritja, Diyari and German, his ethnographic research  only started seriously in 1905 after von Leonhardi expressed his interest in a  publication (Kenny 2005).   9.

Carl Strehlow spent the following five years collecting ethnographic data from  senior men at Hermannsburg and sending plant, animal and insect specimens  as well as material culture15 to Germany. The specimens were widely distributed  by his editor to museums and reputable scientists in Germany for research,  classification and display.   Carl Strehlow collected his material mainly from senior men who were not  Christians or still immersed in their traditions. From what we know about  ownership of dreaming stories and country, he could only have gained his  information from the appropriate owners of a certain age group. Four of his  main informants, Loatjira, Pmala (Tmala), Moses (Tjalkabota) and Talku, are  mentioned by him and his son (Strehlow 1971: xx–xxii).  Loatjira (c.1846–1924)16 was Carl Strehlow’s main informant on Western Aranda  culture. He was the most important contributor to Die Aranda- und Loritja- Stämme in Zentral-Australien. He was the inkata (ceremonial chief)17 of Ntaria,  ‘the grand old man of Hermannsburg’, and an important ngankara (healer,  doctor), who ‘had possessed full knowledge of the dreaded death charms’ and  had taken part as a young man in avenging parties (Strehlow 1970: 116). He  was not resident at the mission and resisted conversion. According to T.G.H.  Strehlow, Loatjira was the main upholder of Aranda religion who ‘remained  strongly opposed to Christianity throughout the lifetime of my father, and in  fact came to Hermannsburg very rarely after the completion of my father’s  book’.18 Loatjira chose to live outside Hermannsburg near Ellery Creek, which  was on the eastern boundary of the mission-lease, and only came permanently  into Hermannsburg after Strehlow’s death. Carl wrote that ‘the old heathen  Loatjira’ had learnt the commandments despite of his old age and blindness,  but left the station with his wife due to a death.19 That day in 1913, 20 people  left the mission in accordance with mourning customs. There must have been  lots of coming and going due to the deaths that occurred at Hermannsburg. It is  not known if Loatjira returned to the mission before Carl’s death.   H.A. Heinrich noted that Loatjira was among a number of persons who had  received pre-baptismal instruction from Reverend Strehlow. He was baptised in  1923 and christened Abraham. T.G.H. Strehlow reports that he died a broken  15 Von Leonhardi to Carl Strehlow, 2.6.1906. Strehlow sent von Leonhardi a letter on the 8.4.1906, in which  he seems to have offered for the first time to send ethnographic objects to Germany. 16 According to T.G.H.

In White Flour, White Power, Rowse (1998: 82) cites  Lohe (1977: 37) who does not quote his sources:  Quite significantly was the baptism of the old blind Aranda chief and  sorcerer, Loatgira (Loatjira), who only three years before has called  Christianity ‘rubbish’. Already in 1913 as reported above, he had joined  Strehlow’s class of instruction, but this was disrupted when he left  Hermannsburg in 1914, returning only in the early 1920s. With longing  joy he announced his desire to be baptised. In answer to the question  ‘why’, he said: I believe that Jesus is my Saviour. Tjurunga (the sacred  objects of the Aranda and the ceremonies connected therewith) is of the  devil and a lie. I desire with all my heart to become a Christian. I believe  that Jesus is able to save even me... (Lohe 1977: 37 cited in Rowse 1998: 82)  I doubt that Loatjira really converted. He wanted to die on his own country.  One of the main features of Aranda belief is ‘becoming country’, going into the  country and becoming part of it – all songs end with the ancestors growing  tired and longing for their home and returning to their place of origin. Loatjira  wanted to die at Ntaria. It was on his father’s and father’s father’s country as well  as in the vicinity of his conception site where his spirit-child (called ‘ratapa’  in Carl Strehlow’s work) had come from and where his ‘iningukua’, his spirit- double, usually dwelt.20  Not much is known about Pmala (Tmala), the second person on the photograph  of Strehlow’s main informants. Pmala (c.1860–1923) was a Western Aranda man  with his conception site at Ndata belonging to the euro dreaming, north-west  of Glen Helen Gorge (Strehlow 1971: xxi, 599, 760). Pmala married Annie Toa in  1890. He was baptised ‘Silas’ on the 16 April 1900 by Carl Strehlow. According  to T.G.H. Strehlow Silas often chopped firewood for the Strehlow home, and  normally brought down on his head the large bread-setting dish with the fat  and innards from the killing pen. He died on the 24 June 1923 suddenly of heart  failure. He had been blind from youth.21 He appears on one of Carl Strehlow’s  genealogies as Ulakararinja (Carl Strehlow 1913). He is known to his descendants  as Silas Mpetyane.   Moses Tjalkabota (c.1873–1950) is the best-known contributor to Strehlow’s  oeuvre. He became a famous evangelist in central Australia, despite his  blindness, and thus was well documented by the Finke River Mission. He had  been baptised on the 26 December 1890 by A.H. Kempe when he was about 12  or 13, but had been nevertheless initiated. He was married on the 25 January  20 Loatjira’s conception site was Mbultjigata near Ntarea (Ntaria), belonging to rameia (yellow goanna) dreaming  (T.G.H. Strehlow 1971: 753). According to Carl Strehlow loatjira is a synonym for rameia (1907: 80 fn. 3). 21 T.G.H.

Interestingly,  Moses also had his sons initiated, despite being a staunch Christian. According  to his autobiography, he was among the first to shake Carl’s hand at his arrival  in 1894 and taught Carl Aranda (Tjalkabota 2002: 272).   The fourth man in the picture is Talku (c.1867–1941), Carl Strehlow’s main  Loritja informant on myth and song (1908, 1911). While he was able to collect a  substantial amount of kinship terminology (1913) from him, he was not able to  complete Talku’s family tree. He remarked:  Unfortunately, I could not gather sufficient data to complete [the family  tree], for my informant, Talku, who also supplied most of the Loritja  myths and cult songs, has once more left our station, and his other tribal  companions residing here have married local women and have therefore  already been included in the family trees of the Aranda. The man sitting at the end of the row on the right is Talku. He used to  make it his task in life to spear the cattle belonging to the whites. An  attempted escape during his arrest resulted in him being shot through  the abdomen. He was then brought to the Mission station and remained  there until he ran away one day to enjoy his golden freedom. (Strehlow  1913: 85, and note 2)  Talku was also an important informant for his son, T.G.H. Strehlow (1970: 137;  1971: xxi, 768), who knew him as Wapiti, Talku’s name in old age. ‘Wapiti’  means yam. T.G.H. Strehlow made some biographical notes on Talku, aka  Wapiti, as well:  Talku, like Loatjira, was not a resident of Hermannsburg. He was the  ceremonial chief of the Kukatja yam centre of Merini. Born about 1867,  he organised raids upon cattle belonging to Tempe Downs Station at the  beginning of the century. A police party surprised these raiders one day  south of Ltalatuma, and fired upon them when they sought to evade  capture. Talku was hit by a bullet from a police tracker’s rifle which  passed through his body and emerged again without apparently injuring  any vital organs. His upper thigh bone was, however, shattered. He was  carried on the backs of his friends across the ranges to Hermannsburg,  a distance of some twenty-five miles. His tough constitution and  unconquerable courage carried him through this ordeal. After being  nursed back to health at Hermannsburg, he showed his gratitude to my  father by providing him with detailed information on Loritja totemic  rites, sacred songs, and social organization. And then he disappeared again  one day into the free wild life of his own country. (Strehlow 1971: xxi)  32 </page> <page sequence="21"> I . Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and Loritja of Central Australia Talku must have left the station at the very latest in 1909. By 1929 he was back  at the mission. On his research trip to Hermannsburg, Norman Tindale made a  data sheet of Wapiti which also confirms his identity. He died at about the age  of 70 on the 14 January 1941.  Other informants of Carl Strehlow seem to have included Hezekiel’s father, a  western quoll man, and Nathaniel Rauwiraka, a main man of Ellery Creek.   Carl Strehlow’s methodology was rigorous. He sat with his informants who sang  and dictated word by word their songs and myths and described ceremonies and  performances. Their dictation allowed verbatim recording of songs along with  their accounts of the choreography and meaning of the sacred ceremonies and  artefacts used in them. Strehlow’s records were not an eyewitness description  of performances. His language proficiency allowed detailed, accurate recording  of the descriptions, explanations and interpretations that Aranda and Loritja  people themselves provided for their ceremonies and cultures.   He seems to have spent as much if not more time between 1905 and 1909 on his  ethnographic project than on his missionary duties. The Lutheran hierarchy  criticised Strehlow for the amount of time and energy he devoted to his research  and writing. As far as his superiors in the Barossa Valley were concerned, he  was wasting his time. We can only imagine what kind of impression he made on  the Aranda. Certainly it seemed to elicit respect. Strehlow’s Aranda informants  may have read in their engagements with him a form of exchange they were  not unfamiliar with. Here perhaps was a man bent on building a portfolio of  knowledge concerning both his own law and the Aranda’s (see also Austin- Broos 2004: 61). Of course, the emplacement of Christian knowledge would  have been an issue, especially for Loatjira and other custodians for Ntaria. Carl  Strehlow had become a form of inkata (ceremonial chief) regarding Christian  law and ceremony. In the course of his stay, Carl became the inkata of Altjira  (Aranda word used for Christian God; this word was also used around the turn  of the century for beings significant in indigenous religion). For the Aranda it  appears not to have been difficult to extend these meanings. Strehlow junior  also suggests that his father was seen as a form of inkata.22  In the last few months of 1909, before leaving central Australia for Germany, Carl  Strehlow was working on the conclusion of Die Aranda- und Loritja-Stämme in  Zentral-Australien, which was concerned with material culture and language  including sign language. By the time he left Hermannsburg in mid-1910 also his  dictionary was completed.  22 The meaning of inkata [ingkarte] has changed significantly over the past century. Today it is used for  Lutheran pastor. It is likely that the shift started to occur during Carl Strehlow’s period, because he seems to  have been their first white inkata. 33 </page> <page sequence="22"> The Aranda’s Pepa The trip was intended as a well-deserved break for Carl and Frieda, and to  secure an education for the eldest five of their children who had, by all accounts,  adopted the ways of the bush. During his stay in Germany his editor von  Leonhardi died. After von Leonhardi’s death, staff members of the Frankfurt  museum, B. Hagen and F.C.H. Sarg, took on the arduous and time-consuming  work to complete the publication of Die Aranda- und Loritja-Stämme in Zentral- Australien. Von Leonhardi’s anthropological library and Strehlow’s unpublished  material had been bequeathed to the museum. Sarg prepared five family trees  out of 20 that Carl Strehlow had sent von Leonhardi for publication and  completed the editing of the fifth volume on social life, which had been proof- read by Marcel Mauss (Strehlow 1913: Preface). Mauss was also going to help  with the publication of the sixth volume, but he dropped out at the beginning  of World War I, keeping some of Strehlow’s material in Paris. Mauss had been on  friendly terms with von Leonhardi, whom he had visited in Gross Karben, and  had taken great interest in Strehlow’s work. After von Leonhardi’s death, Mauss  travelled to Frankfurt specifically to find out what was going to happen with  the remaining manuscripts and offered to correspond with Strehlow in place of  von Leonhardi.23  It is not quite clear who finalised the editing of the sixth volume (Strehlow  1915) as Sarg and the museum had fallen out with each other24 and further  communication with Carl Strehlow or Marcel Mauss was not possible due to  World War I. Hagen was involved and possibly Dr Ernst Vatter, a young and  talented geographer.25  After Hagen’s death, the seventh and final volume on material culture was  published by Ernst Vatter in 1920, just after World War I. He added an index  and wrote in his preface that further research may follow by Carl Strehlow, as  his work had raised new questions and aspects, which were of great scientific  interest. He expressed the optimistic and enthusiastic hope that Carl would  continue his ethnographic investigations, because:  This comprehensive, indeed in many ways singular, observation and  report concerning the Aranda and Loritja constitutes a challenge to  further study and scientific preoccupation. The publication of the  concluding part from Strehlow’s pen will finally open the door to further  debate. The Ethnological Museum of Frankfurt intends to devote one  of its forthcoming publications to a continuing scientific study of  23 F.C.H. Sarg to Carl Strehlow, 20.9.1912 and 18.11.1912. 24 B. Hagen to Carl Strehlow, 10.9.1913. 25 Vatter wrote a book on Australian totemism (1925) and a classic German monograph called Ata Kiwan  (1932) which pre-empted post-modern ethnography (Kohl 2001: 498). He had to leave Germany in the late  1930s as his wife was Jewish and became a poultry farmer in Chile. 34 </page> <page sequence="23"> I . Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and Loritja of Central Australia Strehlow’s vast material, enriched and enlarged by further inquiries  from him, and to make up for lost opportunities due to the war. (Vatter  in Strehlow 1920: Preface)  However, Carl Strehlow did not pursue any further ethnographic research. After  an extended stay in Germany and placing his five eldest children with relatives  and friends, he returned in 1912 to central Australia, with his wife Frieda and  only with their youngest son Theodor. Instead, he started the first translation of  the New Testament into Aranda with Moses Tjalkabota, Nathaniel Rauwirarka  and Jacobus in 1913.26  Carl Strehlow’s magnum opus Carl Strehlow’s magnum opus Die Aranda- und Loritja-Stämme in Zentral- Australien was published in Germany between 1907–1920 in seven instalments  by the Ethnological Museum of Frankfurt. It is a very dense and difficult text  that presupposes knowledge of the existing literature on indigenous Australians  and some ideological standpoints common at the turn of the century. Although  the exact transcriptions of indigenous myths and songs in Aranda and Loritja  are accompanied by German interlinear and free translations, his unpublished  Aranda-German-Loritja dictionary is required to study his work in its full  richness.  First and foremost, Strehlow’s ethnography documents the mythology and  cosmology of the Aranda and Loritja, which occupies volumes one to four. In  his letters he employs various terms including religiösen Anschauungen (religious  views), Religionen (religions),27 religiösen Ideen und Traditionen (religious ideas  and traditions) and Religion der Schwarzen (religion of the blacks) to refer  to this corpus.28 He uses these terms in the style of his time with a range of  interconnected references. There is little evidence that he saw religion as a  functionally integrated phenomenon of cosmology and ritual practice geared to  particular ends. Nonetheless, he and his editor were asking the right questions,  such as:  The Aljeringa half animal, half human [like the Mura-mura of the  Dieri] lived before the present human beings and left a large number  of ceremonies behind which are still performed. Spencer and Gillen’s  accounts give no indication of the purpose of these ceremonies; is it a  kind of cult?29  26 Lutheran Herald, 16.2.1925: 54; Carl Strehlow’s letter to the Mission Friends, 9.1.1920 (Albrecht Collection  Acc.

For  Frazer, magic was a ‘false science’. In this he followed E.B. Tylor who argued  that magic belongs ‘to the lowest known stages of civilization, and the lower  races’, practice based on a false ‘Association of Ideas’ and the ‘antithesis of  religion’ (see Lawrence 1987: 22–24).   Carl Strehlow’s myth collection focuses on the ancestral beings, called in  Aranda ‘altjirangamitjina’ and in Loritja ‘tukutita’, who created the central  Australian landscape and its laws, and play a crucial role in ceremonial life.  The stories concerning these mythological ancestral beings are referred to in  today’s literature as ‘dreamings’. It has often been claimed that Carl Strehlow’s  view of Aranda and Loritja cosmology was flawed, because he was a missionary  and ascribed indigenous high gods to them. Despite his data on the supreme or  high beings, Altjira and Tukura, he maintained that ancestral beings were the  main protagonists in the sacred life of the Aranda and Loritja. As subsequent  discussion will reveal, the positioning of high gods in different cosmologies can  vary considerably. The subtlety of this ethnographic issue was not grasped by  Spencer, or by later anthropologists in Australia (but see Hiatt 1996).  His remaining three volumes (1913, 1915, 1920) describe aspects of social life  and material culture. Initially, Strehlow had written a piece called ‘Land und  Leute’ (land and people) that had been intended as an introduction to his work  on myth and song.30 However, in the course of his correspondence with von  Leonhardi, aspects of ‘social life’, i.e. social classification and organisation,  became an additional area of interest, especially as they studied relevant English  and Australian anthropological works and engaged with contemporary debates  and hypotheses. Marriage classes and kinship terminology31 were topics raised  regularly in their correspondence. Von Leonhardi believed that the views of  Australian researchers on kindhip topics were still hypothetical.32  All volumes of Die Aranda- und Loritja-Stämme in Zentral-Australien also  contain data relating to language and material culture. The word lists and  comments that Strehlow included in his published work were a supplement to  the major dictionary and an Aranda grammar that he had compiled. Additionally  he collected data on the natural environment, often seen from an Aranda and  30 Carl Strehlow to von Leonhardi, 13.12.1906 (SH-SP-7-1). 31 Strehlow’s collection of kinship terms, for example, is still current and a take-off point for modern kin- studies. Further detail in his unpublished dictionary (1909) exceeds the supplements of what was published  in Die Aranda- und Loritja-Stämme in Zentral-Australien.  32 Von Leonhardi to Carl Strehlow, 2.6.1906. 36 </page> <page sequence="25"> I .

Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and Loritja of Central Australia Aranda myths Carl Strehlow’s first publication of 1907 is a collection of Aranda myths labelled  Mythen, Sagen und Märchen (myths, legends and fairy-tales) and arranged into  seven sections. A preface by von Leonhardi contextualises them and their main  protagonists, the ancestors: In primordial times the “totem gods” (altjirangamitjina) walked this  earth and eventually entered the earth, where they are still thought to  be living. Their bodies changed into rocks, trees, shrubs or tjurunga  made of stone or wood. (Strehlow 1907: Preface) Following von Leonhardi’s short preface, Carl Strehlow’s brief account of Altjira,  a high god, follows in Section I. Altjira is thought to be ‘ngambakala’ (eternal)  having emu feet, many wives, sons and daughters. They live in the sky which is  imagined as an eternal land with permanent water, trees, flora and fauna. Altjira  and his family live much like the Aranda, they hunt and gather (1907: 1–2).  Here Carl Strehlow makes an important remark on the meaning of the word  ‘altjira’, which pre-empts Róheim and T.G.H. Strehlow:  The etymology of the word Altjira has not yet been found. The natives  associate the word now with the concept of the non-created. Asked  about the meaning of the word, the natives repeatedly assured me that  Altjira refers to someone who has no beginning, who did not issue from  another (erina itha arbmamakala = no one created him). Spencer and  Gillen’s claim (Northern Tribes of Central Australia p. 745) that “the  word alcheri means dream” is incorrect. Altjirerama means “to dream”,  and it is derived from altjira (god) and rama (to see), in other words,  “to see god”. The same holds true for the Loritja language. Tukura  nangani = “to dream”, from turkura (god) and nangani (to see). It will  be demonstrated later that altjira and tukura in this context do not refer  to the highest God in the sky but merely to a totem god which the native  believes to have seen in a dream.34 (Strehlow 1907: 2)  After introducing Altjira, Section II, ‘Die Urzeit (Primordial Time)’, delivers a  general account of the conditions on earth, or more precisely of the territory of  the Aranda, in primordial times (Strehlow 1907: 2–8). The earth is described as an  eternal presence in which undeveloped humans, who were already divided into  moieties, called ‘alarinja’ and ‘kwatjarinja’ (of the earth and water respectively),  and an eight-class (subsection) system. Here the anthropomorphic ancestors  called ‘altjirangamitjina’ are introduced, emerging in their primeval state from  34 My emphasis. 39 </page> <page sequence="28"> The Aranda’s Pepa their underground dwellings (Strehlow 1907: 3). The ancestors wandered over  the as yet formless land, shaping the landscape as it is still seen today, performing  and transforming themselves, establishing the world’s structure.   Section III deals with Putiaputia und andere Lehrer der Aranda (Putiaputia and  other teachers of the Aranda) who came from the north and taught the Aranda  about certain institutions such as initiation (Strehlow 1907: 9–11). The ‘erintja’  (evil beings), and ‘rubaruba’ and ‘wurinja’ (bad winds) are mentioned in Section  IV (1907: 11–15) and Die Toteninsel (The Island of the Dead) (Strehlow 1907:  15–16) is the subject of Section V.   Section VI, the largest, is called Sagen über die Totem-Vorfahren (Myths about  the Totem Ancestors) (Strehlow 1907: 16–101). It contains 64 narratives of the  individual mythical beings, the altjirangamitjina, who populated and created  the Aranda landscape and its particular places. They are associated with celestial  bodies (sun, moon, evening star, Pleiades), animals, plants and other natural  phenomena (including fire and rain). These narratives are roughly arranged in  three groups: ‘dead objects’, animals and plants, and female ancestors.  The myths on the celestial bodies tell about the mythical beings associated with  the sun, the moon, Tmálbambaralénana (The Evening Star),35 Kuralja (Pleiades),  and are followed by a water dreaming story linked with the site Kaporilja. The  second group concerns the majority of ancestors who are associated with the  plant and animal world of the central Australian landscape. He wrote that ‘most  of their myths are local myths, that belong to particular places’36 and specific  ancestors or ‘totem gods are associated with certain places where they have lived  and generated their totem animals’ (Strehlow 1907: 4). The Aranda myths are  concerned with the actions, travels, places, petrifying, going into the landscape,  place names, the proper way to do things, interaction with other beings from  other places and even from other language backgrounds, as there are place  names, words and even songs in languages other than Aranda. Nearly all of  these stories end with the ancestors turning into tjurunga or metamorphosing  into natural features.  The third group of stories in Section VI are about female ancestors who are  usually called alknarintja meaning ‘eyes look away’. These narratives tell of  women who reject advances of men. They too are connected to particular places  on Aranda country and ceremonies. The last Section VII contains four narratives  classified as fairy-tales. 35 Tmálbambaralénana means Evening Star. A contemporary spelling can not be found, because the  etymology is not certain, although Carl Strehlow indicated that tmalba means ‘flame’. 36 Carl Strehlow to von Leonhardi, probably 8.4.1906 (SH-SP-1-1). 40 </page> <page sequence="29"> I . Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and Loritja of Central Australia Loritja myths Strehlow’s collection of Loritja myths is not as extensive as his Aranda collection.  While it is organised in a similar fashion, only one myth is reproduced in Loritja,  called ‘Papa tua, Knulja ntjara (the dogs)’ (Strehlow 1908: 12–16), as well as  in Aranda. In the fourth volume we are informed that its ceremony is part of  Loritja as well as Aranda initiation (Strehlow 1911: 15). Von Leonhardi appended  six additional Loritja prose texts (Strehlow 1911: 59–75) to this volume, which  Strehlow had recorded during research on Loritja song.   Section I of this volume is called Tukura, after the highest being of the Loritja.  Like the account of Altjira, it is rather short. Here I quote the entire passage on  Tukura to illustrate how the so called ‘high gods’ feature only in passing in this  work:  The Loritja call the supreme being Tukura. Linked with Tukura is the  concept of the Non-created One, the eternal. I am unable to provide  an etymological derivation of the word. One envisages Tukura as  a man with a beautiful red skin, long flowing hair and a long beard.  The Western Loritja believe that he has emu feet – like the Altjira of  the Aranda – but the Southern Loritja accredit him with human feet.  Tukura has only one wife, by the name of Inéari (A: tnéera meaning  the beautiful), and one child which always remains a child. The latter  is called Arátapi (A: ratapa; i.e. offspring). The Western and Southern  Loritja agree that Inéari has human feet. Tukura’s residence is the sky  ilkari (A: alkira). The Milky Way, called merawari, i.e. wide creek, or  tukalba, i.e. winding creek, by the Loritja, is lined with gum trees  (itára), mulga trees (kurku) and other trees and shrubs. In their branches  live parrots and pigeons, while kangaroos (mallu), emus (kalaia) and  wild cats (kuninka) roam through Tukura’s realm. While Tukura amuses  himself in his hunting ground, his wife and son are out gathering edible  roots called wapiti (A: latjia) and tasty bulbs (neri), as well as grass seeds  which grow there in abundance. Tukura sleeps at night, but during the  day he conducts ceremonies to which he calls the young men (nitaii)  living nearby. The stars (tjiltjana) are the campfires of Tukura. As is the  case with the Aranda, the women and children also know of Tukura’s  existence. The Loritja imagine the sky, which has existed from eternity  (kututu), to be a vault-like firmament, resting on “legs of stone”. One  fears that some day the vaulted sky could collapse and kill everybody.  (Strehlow 1908: 1–2)  The following pages on Loritja myths relate to the scene at the beginning of time  when the tukutita, the eternal-uncreated ones, emerged out of the earth that,  like the sky, had always been in existence (Strehlow 1908: 2–5).   41 </page> <page sequence="30"> The Aranda’s Pepa Section III concerns Die bösen Wesen (The evil Beings) and Section IV, Die Toten- Insel (The Island of the Dead) (1908: 5–7). Again the largest Section V, Sagen  über die Totem-Vorfahren, is ‘about the Totem Ancestors’ (Strehlow 1908: 8–48).  It includes 42 narratives about the earth-dwelling ancestors, the tukutita, who  are associated with celestial bodies (moon, sun, morning star, Pleiades), and  the animal and plant world. The stories of how the travels of the tukutita and  the events surrounding them create the landscape and constitute society are  prominent in this volume as well.   In his discussion of Loritja myth, Strehlow began to note differences between  the Aranda and Loritja (Kukatja) mythologies. The Loritja concept of what it  was like at the beginning, that in primordial times the earth ‘was not covered by  the sea’ but was always dry, contrasts with ‘the views of the Aranda’ (Strehlow  1908: 2). This account of ‘primordial times’ outline a number of differences  between the Aranda and Loritja:  There is a marked difference between the Aranda and Loritja legends.  According to the tradition of the Aranda, most of the meandering  altjirangamitjina were changed into tjurunga-woods or stones and only  a few became trees or rocks. According to the tradition of the Loritja,  however, the reverse is true. The bodies of the tukutita were mostly  changed into rocks and trees. Naturally, this results in the lessening of  the religious meaning and importance of the tjurunga. Among the Dieri  living in the South-East, all the bodies of the Murra-murra are changed  into rocks, trees, etc. and the tjurunga do not occur at all. (Strehlow  1908: 3–4)  He also began cross-referencing Loritja myths with each other and with Aranda  myths published in volume one, because story lines connected or intersected  with each other at particular places and identical songs and terms appeared in  two different myths indicating borrowing. Sometimes the Loritja ancestors, the  tukutita, interacted with the Aranda ancestor, the altjirangamitjina. The myth  of a Loritja wallaby man (Strehlow 1908: 28), for example, is cross-referenced  with the Aranda possum myth (Strehlow 1907: 62, Anmerkung 15), because  at a place called Tunguma the wallaby ancestor joins some possum ancestors  for a ceremony and go together into the ground there creating a water-source.  Or a Loritja myth on emus (Strehlow 1908: 18–20) is cross-referenced to the  Aranda one on emus (Strehlow 1907: 42–45), because at the end of both myths  the emus coming from Aranda and Loritja country end their travels at a place  called Kalaia-tarbana, meaning in Loritja ‘the emu go in’.  Another emu myth of the Loritja (Strehlow 1908: 32) is also connected to an  Aranda myth (Strehlow 1907: 44, Anmerkung 6), because the site Apauuru,  north-west of Hermannsburg, features in both narratives. This Loritja dreaming  42 </page> <page sequence="31"> I . Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and Loritja of Central Australia story has a number of interesting ‘foreign features’ incorporated into its  narrative. It begins in Loritja country and travels east. At Iloara, a salt lake on the  southern edge of Anmatyerr country, the emu’s wife hurts her foot and cannot  follow her husband. He sings a threat song which inserts Loritja words into an  Ilpara (believed to be today’s Warlpiri) song, additionally mentioning Kulurlba,  a famous Aranda native cat ancestor, who had thrown a boomerang at his  disobedient wife. This treatment of myths went as much towards particularism  as refined diffusionism.  In sum, Loritja myths like Aranda myths tell about the ancestors’ epic journeys  over country visiting places and metamorphosing or going into the landscape.  These narratives end with the mythic beings turning into natural features,  tjurunga or kuntanka stones and rocks.37 The last two narratives in Carl  Strehlow’s Loritja myth collection are designated as fairy-tales.   The second part of volume two deals with the totemic concepts of the Aranda  and Loritja (Strehlow 1908: 51–70) and tjurunga (Strehlow 1908: 71–83).  Strehlow explains that the belief systems of the Aranda and Loritja were very  similar, but that the difference lay in the fact that the myths were ‘local myths’  and each connected to particular places in the landscape. Cultus: Songs and ceremonies The manuscript Cultus was published in two instalments in 1910 and 1911,  called Die Totemischen Kulte der Aranda und Loritja Stämme. It contains songs  connected to myths he had recorded in prose as well as sacred ceremonies. Carl  Strehlow documented 59 Aranda ceremonies and their associated songs and 21  Loritja ceremonies which included some relating to female ancestors acted out  by men. He found that two types of ceremony were performed:   The Aranda and Loritja today still regularly hold the cult rituals  according to the instruction of their altjirangamitjina. However, there  is one significant difference. In primordial times one ceremony was  intended to serve two purposes, now two distinct performances are  held, each with its own name, and each serving a specific purpose.  When the young men undergo the various initiation rites, a series of  ceremonies are performed for them which are identical to the real cult  rituals, except for certain very special and characteristic details, but  do not serve the purpose of increasing and enhancing the growth of  the respective totem. Their only aim is to show those who are about  to become men or have become men how these ceremonies should be  37 Like tjurunga, kuntanka is polisemic. Kuntanka describes to a lesser degree a sacred object, but rather  particular features of a landscape that represent dreaming beings or parts of them. 43 </page> <page sequence="32"> The Aranda’s Pepa performed. In view of their purpose these ceremonies are therefore known  as intitjiuma (L. tintinpungañi) i.e. to initiate into something, to show how  something is done. However, when the same ceremonies are performed  at the particular totem place which an altjirangamitjina called home in  primordial times, or where he had spent some time, and if their purpose is  to care for the increase and growth of the totem, then this performance is  called mbatjalkatiuma (L. kutintjingañi), i.e. to bring about, make fertile,  improve the conditions of. (Strehlow 1910: 1–2)  Carl Strehlow also wrote ‘that in primordial times the altjirangamitjina travelled  about with their novices and that they performed certain ceremonies at their  “eternal camps” as well as at other locations during their journeys’ (Strehlow  1910: 1). These accounts of songs and ceremonies are accompanied by drawings,  descriptions of who performs what, at which places in the Aranda landscape it  is performed, how it is performed, what ceremonial artefacts are used and their  purposes. The letters between Strehlow and von Leonhardi discuss and analyse  these ‘cults’ in detail whereas the publication is a descriptive and empirical  account. Leben: Social life The remaining volumes, based on Strehlow’s manuscript called Leben, are not  as well structured and presented as his previous publications, because they  were not edited by von Leonhardi. After von Leonhardi’s death, staff members  of the Frankfurt museum, B. Hagen, F.C.H. Sarg and E. Vatter, completed the  publication of Die Aranda- und Loritja-Stämme in Zentral-Australien. Volumes  five and six describe a number of important facets of Aranda and Loritja life  around 1900, some of which are still practised. These volumes cover subjects  such as birth, name giving, games, initiation ceremonies, the marriage system,  kinship terminology, marriage customs (Strehlow 1913), the political and legal  system, death, burial, blood revenge, illnesses, magic, terms for numbers  and time, secret language registers of men (Strehlow 1915) and sign language  (Strehlow 1915: 54–78).   These instalments include Carl Strehlow’s kinship data. It appeared in the  fifth volume in 1913, called The Social Life of the Aranda and Loritja Tribes.  Compared to his four volumes on myth, his kinship material appears deceptively  slim. However, he managed to condense into 26 pages an incredible amount of  empirical data. He published substantial accounts on the section and subsection  systems of people living at Hermannsburg at the time, extensive lists of kinship  terms (Strehlow 1913: 62–89), five extensive family trees and a list of all names  occurring in the family trees with their linguistic and technical explanations  (Strehlow 1920: 15-39).  44 </page> <page sequence="33"> I . Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and Loritja of Central Australia The chapter ‘Birth, Smoking and Name-Giving’ in Carl Strehlow’s fifth volume  is almost certainly based on information collected by his wife, Frieda Strehlow  (Strehlow 1913: 1–5). The relevant part in the handwritten manuscripts is  in Frieda’s hand; it is the only passage in these manuscripts written by her.  She may only have copied her husband’s notes. However, the topic relates to  birth and women’s ritual. It is unlikely to be mere chance that this part of the  manuscript is in her hand. Only with great difficulty and coercion would Carl  Strehlow have been able to obtain this kind of data from women. It could of  course be second hand information from Aranda and Loritja men, but this  seems unlikely. Another indication of Frieda’s involvement in the production of  Die Aranda- und Loritja-Stämme in Zentral-Australien is a remark by Sarg, one  of Strehlow’s later editors. He asked Carl to indicate which data his wife had  collected, because in his view it was very important to be able to say that ‘this  I observed’ or ‘the observation was made by my wife’.38 However, World War I  intervened and communication with Australia broke down.   Both Frieda and Carl had an excellent understanding of indigenous kinship  systems. Carl Strehlow had been classified as a Purula (Aranda subsection  associated with Ntaria, Hermannsburg and surrounding area) and his children  therefore as Kamara.39 He used his knowledge of indigenous kinship, which  determines conduct and obligations towards particular kin, when engaged  with his congregation.40 It is likely that some of the genealogical material was  obtained by Frieda, if the current situation can be taken as indicative. During  field research in the past 20 years, I have generally found that the majority of  central Australian Aboriginal men have a hard time reproducing a significant  list of lateral relatives in their own and proximate generations. Aboriginal  women tend to be more able to provide a kin universe.41 A reference to Frank  Gillen’s method of data collection also provides some insight. Ernest Cowle,  a policeman in the 1890s in central Australia, remarked once to Spencer on  Gillen’s genealogical work with one of Cowle’s Aboriginal prisoners:   Gillen got at him in his den and unfolded a papyrus as long as himself  and started to trace his descent through endless aunts, and great  great grandfather’s mothers he fainted away completely! ... even a  Sub-Protector has no right to invent tortures, surpassing those of the  Inquisition in general fiendishness... (Mulvaney, Petch and Morphy  2000: 91)   38 Sarg to Carl Strehlow, 18.11.1912. 39 According to T.G.H. Strehlow ([1950] 1997: 47), he was classified as a Kamara (Kemarre) by reason of his  conception site Ntarea (Ntaria). It is just as likely that T.G.H. Strehlow simply received the right subsection  through his father’s classification which was probably Purula (Perrurle). (Garry Stoll thought that Ted was a  Kemarre (pers. comm.).) 40 Strehlow’s letters to Kaibel (1899–1909) held at the Lutheran Archives, Adelaide (LAA). 41 Gillen was probably also asking about people with tabooed names which is likely to have caused some distress. 45 </page> <page sequence="34"> The Aranda’s Pepa Frieda may also have contributed to Carl’s myth collection. The whirlwind which  brings bad spirit-children, or the myths relating to female ancestors, may have  been inserted by her. Her letters are often about her work with Aranda women,  her close engagement with them in everyday life and indigenous beliefs. She  mentions in her letters to family and friends, for example, the infanticide of  twins and beliefs about spirit children.42 Material culture Images, descriptions and interpretations of material culture are interspersed  throughout Strehlow’s work to illustrate and enhance the text. Only the last  volume (Strehlow 1920: 8–14) contains a few pages on material culture although  the data on his collection could have filled an entire volume.43 He had sent  artefacts and objects of varying quality to his editor in Germany. Interestingly  many of these items were commissioned, not originals. Strehlow remarked, for  instance, about stone knives: ‘I regret, that I cannot send you better stone- knives. These ones are not at all well worked; only steel knives are in use now.’44  On his own initiative, Carl Strehlow had started in 1906 to send indigenous  artefacts and tjurunga to von Leonhardi as well as samples of flora and fauna.  He initially sent material culture to his editor to illustrate his written data and  that ‘maybe better drawings could be made’ because ‘I am a bad drawer’,45 but  it soon became a separate project. Strehlow may have been inspired by Spencer  and Gillen’s plates in their publications and by Siebert and Reuther,46 who had  been collecting material culture for their own research on the peoples of the  Lake Eyre basin, as well as by Eylemann (1908) who had been in Hermannsburg  collecting artefacts and ethnographic data.   Carl Strehlow’s collection included well over 1000 sacred objects and mundane  artefacts. He sent hundreds of tjurunga,47 a large number of ceremonial objects,48  carrying dishes, boomerangs,49 spears, spear throwers, clubs, shields, hair  42 Other letters by women from Hermannsburg make interesting remarks on the life of Aranda women.  Maria Bogner for example talks about a women’s ceremony one night in the creek in 1896. 43 F.C.H. Sarg (1911) and Vatter (1915) used his collection for their publications. 44 Carl Strehlow to von Leonhardi, probably on 3.12.1906 (SH-SP-8-1). 45 Carl Strehlow to von Leonhardi, probably 8.4.1906 (SH-SP-1-1). 46 Siebert had collected objects by 1904, which the new Völkermuseum of Frankfurt (called Museum  der Weltkulturen today) exhibited in the same year at its opening (Nobbs 2006: 12). Reuther collected  approximately 1300 artefacts including ceremonial objects, nearly 400 toas and a large collection of ethno- botanical specimens (Nobbs 2005) between 1903 and 1906. Reuther’s collection was purchased by the South  Australian Museum in 1907 for £400 (Nobbs 2005: 42). 47 Carl Strehlow wrote to von Leonhardi that ‘there are nearly no Tj. left in most stonecaves in the vicinity’,  probably 10.12.1907 (SH-SP-15-1). 48 Carl Strehlow to von Leonhardi, probably 10.12.1907 (SH-SP-15-1). 49 F.C.H. Sarg (1911) described in ‘Die Australischen Bumerangs im Städtischen Völkermuseum’ some of  Strehlow’s boomerangs. 46 </page> <page sequence="35"> I . Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and Loritja of Central Australia strings, stone knives and axes, digging sticks, chains made of native beans,  and many other items that he documented in his unpublished dictionary. His  collection also included some hybrids: ‘As a curiosity without scientific value  I include tied up rabbit tails that the blacks have started to make since the  rabbit plague has reached the interior of Australia’.50 His editor in Germany  greeted Strehlow’s collection with great enthusiasm and became his agent for  the distribution of these objects.51 In fact, von Leonhardi seems to have become  nearly addicted to these consignments. Much of Strehlow’s collection did not  survive the bombing of Frankfurt in World War II.   Strehlow used his collection to illustrate and explain aspects of traditional  Aboriginal daily life and sacred ceremonies. He described each artefact’s form  and function, but does not seem to have recorded the names of the indigenous  artisans or suppliers. Information on how the artefacts were made and where  they were used and traded among the different groups, make interesting reading:  Because the natives have no concept of money, they engage in lively  trade. Important living places along the borders of befriended tribes are  also important trading places, unbunba. At Ingodna on the lower Finke,  for example, the Aranda-Tanka barter with the Aranda-Lada and the  Aranda-Ulbma; and at Utnádata on the southern border of the Aranda  Tanka, they conduct their trade with the Arábana.  The Southern Loritja, as well as the Southern Aranda, bartered with the  Aranda-Ulbma here at Hermannsburg. On the other hand, the trading  place for the Aranda Ulbma and the Western Loritja is at Apanuru,  situated on Loritja territory. The Aranda-Ulbma also trade with the  Aranda-Roara at Alice Springs, with the Ilpara at Ilóara in the north,  and with the Katitja and Imatjera at Tnimakwatja in the north.  The Aranda trade the following items with other tribes: shields, spears,  spearthrowers, small boomerangs ulbarinja lubara, strings ulera,  nose-bones lalkara, pitch nobma, stone knives karitja, trays made of  para wood, etc. With the northern tribes, however, they trade trays  made from ininta, headstrings kanta, necklaces gulatja, breaststrings  tmakurka, neck decorations matara, shells takula and sticks wolta;  while from the south-eastern tribes they receive the large boomerangs  and pubic coverings. (Strehlow 1920: 13)  50 Carl Strehlow to von Leonhardi, probably 10.12.1907 (SH-SP-15-1). 51 Bastian’s salvage anthropology had trigged an international run on the world’s existing indigenous  material culture. The German and international collecting frenzy before everything was lost forever seems  to have reached every corner of the globe. Strehlow also saw it as a source for some extra income for his ever  financially suffering congregation. 47 </page> <page sequence="36"> The Aranda’s Pepa After the death of his editor, Strehlow continued to collect for the Cologne52  and Frankfurt museums,53 and to distribute artefacts, when he returned from  Germany on the 5 April 1912 with his wife and youngest son Ted to central  Australia. However, once the Great War (1914–1918) overshadowed international  relations, it became impossible to export Aboriginal material culture.  12.

He had left them in Germany, so they would be properly educated.  He was not to see them again. This guilt and loss may have driven him to  increase his efforts for the people at Hermannsburg and the bible translation  into Aranda; completed in 1919. Although an Australian citizen, he was  hounded by the South Australian Government to register as an alien. With the  support of Sergeant Robert Stott who was known as the ‘Uncrowned King of  Central Australia’ Carl Strehlow was able to continue his and Frieda’s work.  However, the mission was permanently threatened by financial ruin. In 1917  Hermannsburg lost its 300 pounds per year government subsidies, largely due to  anti-German prejudice, which flourished during the Great War (Rowse 1998: 84).  52 Letters between Carl Strehlow and Fritz Graebner between 1912 and 1913, held at the city archives in Cologne. 53 Correspondence between Strehlow and his second editor Sarg.

Carl Strehlow and the Aranda and Loritja of Central Australia With war’s end and word that his children had survived, Strehlow attempted  to get a replacement so he could leave for Germany to see his children. As he  waited at Hermannsburg for his superiors in the Barossa Valley to organise  his replacement, he made a last effort on his still unpublished dictionary of  over 6000 Aranda and Loritja words that included thousands of derivations.54  Finalising his linguistic work appears to have been the ultimate proof that  indigenous languages can express the gamut of human cognition, including the  bible’s revelations. However, 30 years of effort had taken their toll on Strehlow.  The desert, the battles with state and church bureaucracy and pastoralists as  well as his limited success with conversion, had weakened his body and spirit.  Mid 1922 Strehlow was struck down by a mysterious illness which he himself  diagnosed from his medical books as dropsy, and for the first time he did not  take the service on Sunday. His youngest son wrote in his childhood diary about  this service:  I played the organ because Mum and Dad stayed at home. ... The  congregation remained completely silent during the first liturgy, so Herr  Heinrich started singing the responses himself fairly in the wrong tune,  until some men took over and ended the verse in a strangely off melody.55  All attempts to treat him locally proved fruitless and his ‘Journey to Horseshoe  Bend’ began. As he was taken away his Aranda friends sang Kaarrerrai  worlamparinyai, a hymn he had translated for them to the music of Bach. The  journey down the bend was agonising and his youngest son, who accompanied  him on this last journey, was to write that ‘Horseshoe Bend is a place whose  shadows I can never escape’.56 Carl Strehlow died on the 20 October 1922. Some  years after his death the Lutheran Herald reported:  Not long after the death of the late Rev. Strehlow, it was indeed  perceptible how a spiritual awakening stirred not only our natives at  Hermannsburg, but all Aranda people. All seemed to feel and realise,  that by devoting his whole life to it, even laying down his life in the  service, there must be something great and true in what Rev. Strehlow  taught, to thus enable him to unselfishly work for them, in contrast to  most other white folks they knew.57  On the 4 November 1923, one year after Strehlow’s death, something like a  mass-baptism seems to have occurred at Hermannsburg (Strehlow 1969–70:  178–180).

There are no reliable records of Carl  Strehlow and Loatjira’s state of minds towards the end of their lives. Both men  had been devoted to their faiths, but were troubled.
