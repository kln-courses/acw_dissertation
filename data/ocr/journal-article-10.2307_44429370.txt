<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pedagogical Agents as a Social Interface Amy L. Baylor Florida State University The addition of a pedagogical agent at the front-end of a computer-based learning environment immediately adds a social component. Controlled research of peda- gogical agent media features (e.g., appearance, nonverbal communication, voice, and functional role) indicates that the presence of a well-designed pedagogical agent can significantly impact learning and, in particular, motivational outcomes. Through consideration of agent media features, both separately and holistically, an instructional designer can figuratively "build" a pedagogical agent to effectively serve as a virtual instructor or peer. For pedagogical agents to serve as effective facilitators of learning, it is clear that the underlying back-end intelligent tutoring system plays a key role (see Cole et al., this issue; Graesser et al., this issue; van Vuuren, this issue). However, what I have found intriguing, and sometimes surprising, in my own research over the last ten years is the impact of pedagogical agents as a front- end social interface. As the figurative inter- "face" of a learning system, an anthropomorphic pedagogical agent can impact learning and particularly motivation, regardless of the back-end computer system (e.g., that may be adaptive or intelligent). Along this line, my research group, PALS (Pedagogical Agent Learning Systems; see http://ritl.fsu.edu), supported in part by the National Science Foundation (HS-0218692 &amp; HRD- 0429647), has investigated the impact of pedagogical agent appearance, non-verbal communication (emo- tional expressions, deictic gestures), functional role, and to a more limited extent, voice, on learning and motivation. Given its human-like appearance and interaction style, a pedagogical agent naturally engenders a social Amy L.

Along this line, we have investigated the role of several media features of peda- gogical agents as a social interface: appearance, non- verbal communication, and functional role/persona. Appearance of Pedagogical Agents Several appearance-related factors that are important for a pedagogical agent include realism, gender, ethnicity, attractiveness, age, and human-likeness. While researchers have speculated that an agent that is too realistic may lead to unrealistic learner expectations, how realistic is too realistic? We have found that males in particular actually learn significantly more when an agent is realistic as compared to cartoon-like (see Figure 1). On the other hand, there are no differences in learning for females, and given a choice, female undergraduates actually are more likely than males to choose to learn from a cartoon-like agent (Baylor et al., 2003b). Figure 1. Realistic vs. cartoon-like agents. With respect to agent gender, holding everything else constant, we have found that a female agent is more effective than a male agent at promoting motiva- tional outcomes, particularly self-efficacy (Baylor, 2005), and particularly with younger students (age 13- 16 years) (Plant et al., 2006). Students also tend to rate female agents as significantly less competent than male agents, even when everything else is held constant, thus suggesting a "if she can do it, I can do it" effect. On the other hand, male agents appear to be more effective than female agents in facilitating student perception of agent effectiveness and overall satisfac- tion (Baylor &amp; Kim, 2003). With respect to agent ethnicity, we found that Black students were significantly more likely than White students to choose to learn from an agent of the same ethnicity, and also subsequently rated the agent as significantly more facilitative of learning, credible, EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/January-February 2007 1 1</page><page sequence="2">human-like, and engaging than White students rated the agent they chose. However, in a randomized design, we found that if student ethnicity matched the agent (e.g., White student-White agent; Black student- Black agent), students rated the agent as significantly more engaging and affable, and in a recent study, more influential on attitudinal outcomes. Results with respect to attractiveness indicate that learners tend to rate attractive agents as deserving more respect, as being more similar to themselves, as who they would like to be like, and as their preferred agent from which to learn (Baylor &amp; Plant, 2005). Pedagogi- cal agent age also plays a factor, with younger peer-like agents serving more effectively as a peer model, motivator, or learning companion, whereas older agents serve better in a more authoritative instructor role, such as an expert (Baylor &amp; Kim, 2005; Baylor et al., 2006). Interesting, preliminary work with non-human but anthropomorphic agents (including 3D shapes and animals) indicates that even non-human agents are perceived as emotional, believable, and human-like. This is important because a special advantage of non- human pedagogical agents is the potential to exaggerate facial features so as to emphasize emotional expressiveness, a key aspect of non-verbal communication, as described in the next section. Non-Verbal Communication Animated pedagogical agents can employ human- like nonverbal communication to facilitate students' interpretation of the meaning of the message. Research results reveal design implications for the presence of deictic gestures (e.g., pointing, head-nodding, gaze) and emotional expression. With respect to deictic gestures, Atkinson (2002) found that the presence of such gestures facilitated "learning from example" for mathematical problems. We similarly have found that deictic gestures are particularly valuable for learning procedures (e.g., how to learn a new software program), and their presence neither positively nor negatively impacts students' attitude (e.g., to choose to adopt copyright laws) (Baylor et al., 2005). In contrast, we found that the presence of emotional expressiveness can actually be detrimental to procedural learning in that it diverts student attention from the task, creating unnecessary cognitive load. The presence of emotional expressions did, however, positively facilitate persuasiveness of the message and student attitude toward the content. In a different study with community college remedial math students, we manipulated the agent's overall affective state (positive versus evasive) together with the presence or absence of motivational messages. We found that student self-efficacy was significantly nega- tively impacted when the agent was evasive and without motivational messages; however, if the agent had a positive affective state, even without motivational messages, student self-efficacy improved (Baylor et al., 2004). Further, students working with evasive agents reported significantly more anxiety toward the task (Warren et al., 2005). Voice Another key factor of pedagogical agent communi- cation is its voice. Voice can carry a great amount of information beyond the instructional message, particularly if it is accompanied by information regarding the speaker's suitability as a conversational partner (Mayer et al., 2003). According to the research on the effects of voice of animated pedagogical agents, voice provides a powerful indicator of meaning (Atkinson et al., 2005; Moreno et al., 2001). Nass and colleagues (2005) have extensively investigated the powerful role of voice in technology-mediated environments. Our research indicates that an agent with a human voice is more preferable to learners than an agent with a computer-generated voice; however, we found no differences in learning between a human and computer-generated voice (Baylor et al., 2003a). This is significant because technologically it is much more convenient to use a computer-generated voice, particularly for natural language systems, such as AutoTutor (Graesser et al., this issue) or Marni (Cole et al., this issue). Agent Functionality/Role When considering these agent media features as a holistic package, animated pedagogical agents can be designed to represent a particular persona and thus play different "roles" or functions within a computer- based learning environment. Some of the roles we have implemented and validated (see Baylor &amp; Kim, 2005) include agent as a Motivator, Expert (see Graesser et al., this issue), Mentor, Social Model (see Kim &amp; Baylor, this issue) or Learning Companion (see Cassell et al., this issue; Goldman et al., this issue; Nass, this issue). Different agent roles are designed by manipulating media and content-related attributes (e.g., appearance, nonverbal communication, message, and voice) to create a unique agent persona and functionality. Psychometrically, we determined that there are two latent variables (and associated factors) underlying pedagogical agent persona: Informational Usefulness (constituted of students' perception of agent Credibility and Facilitating of Learning) and Emotive Interaction (constituted of students' perception of agent as Engag- ing and Human-like) (Ryu &amp; Baylor, 2005). A unique affordance of pedagogical agents for both research and instruction is their capacity to inter- actively present instructional or motivational messages in a human-like manner. This can be advantageous for 1 2 EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/January-February 2007</page><page sequence="3">training evaluation (e.g., to test effectiveness of two different approaches) or research (e.g., to evaluate different instructional strategies). For example, by manipulating agents7 epistemologica! message (instruc- tivist versus constructivist), while holding everything else constant, pre-service teachers7 metacognitive awareness of instructional planning was significantly enhanced by the presence of a constructivist agent, and correspondingly learning about the constructivist approach to instructional design (Baylor, 2002b). Of particular interest with respect to human-com- puter interaction design is the split-persona effect , a unique affordance when multiple pedagogical agents are employed (Baylor &amp; Ebbers, 2003). The split- persona effect is our finding that two agents (representing both Motivator and Expert roles) that together present the information through two personas led to significantly more learning than one agent providing all of the information (through a Mentor role; see Figure 2). This can be explained by the fact that it was easier for the student to figuratively "compartmen- talize77 the information by its presentation and interaction with two functionally different sources. This is noteworthy with respect to its implications for interface design, as it is unique to pedagogical agents given that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to replicate with real human instructors. Figure 2. Split-persona effect: Two agents better than one. Design Implications What is particularly exciting about the potential for pedagogical agents as a social interface? Perhaps the main appeal is that while we cannot figuratively /7build77 human instructors to look and act exactly as we like, we can build virtual instructors, peers, mentors, or motivators according to a particular specification. By planning in advance the optimal appearance, non- verbal communication, voice, and functionality for a given instructional goal and learning population, pedagogical agents can be effective in a number of instructional ly-related roles. Given their propensity to serve as simulated human instructors, pedagogical agents also can serve as controlled research vehicles for testing instructional or motivational strategies (Baylor, 2002a). In this way, pedagogical agents not only can enhance the otherwise poor communicative capabilities of computer-based learning environments, but also allow for more social and human-like systems. □ References Atkinson, R.
