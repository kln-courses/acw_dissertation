<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hydrozoology in the Microcosm Jean L. Campbell Department of English John F. Kennedy Junior High School Cupertino, California Greetings all you hydromaniacs. It's time for another trip through the tele- ocular. Into the microhydrocosm! There is some kilo-ped-hy dromorphic- bio now. Shall we take a phono-photo of it uttering auto-bio sound? Look at that anthropomorphic bio oscillate! The peds oscillate with great techne. Oh, multicellular anthrops, would you graph its photo, please? Kim Bermudez (student) ONE teaching day during recess, some of my students began to enjoy the art of writing on the board. I watched them as they spontaneously tried to outdo each other in writing the longest words and non-words they could remember or im- agine. Included, of course, were super- califragilisticexpialidocious and antidises- tablishmentarianism, plus an even longer creation that they informed me was a miners' disease. I left the words on the board. During the week, other students contributed examples and filled the entire board. Everyone seemed to enjoy trying to de- cipher what was written and trying to add to the growing list. The first activity of each incoming class was to check the latest additions and to add more. I decided to capitalize on their interest by adding to their supply of possible combinations. The procedures were the following: 1. Using words with which they were familiar, I broke down the parts into meanings. Examples: micro-small phono-sound tele-far scope-sight bio-life ology-study photo-light After these were combined to form words, students were given an opportun- ity to recombine roots and make new meanings. Some of the new words created by students follow. philienauto-to be in love with yourself megaspyre-big fire oculusaqua-tear geobios-earth life hypnophono-snore megasanthrope-big man pyrcorpus-fireman megamaniac-big nut 2. After they had worked with the familiar roots, I gave them additional ones. I also gave them prefixes and suf- fixes in words with which they were familiar. Examples: ex-out of, as in exit port-to carry, as in transport dict-to say, as in dictation un-indicating negative or opposite, as in unsatisfactory anti-opposite or against, as in antislavery ante-before, as in antecedent trans-across, as in transportation est-forms superlative, as in greatest er-one who does, as in renter er-indicates degree, as in w'armer They were invited to submit roots, pre- fixes, and suffixes for the others to use. The lists grew long. 3. They were given an opportunity to deduce meanings. I listed words that have 861</page><page sequence="2">862 ENGLISH JOURNAL similar roots, prefixes, or suffixes and let them see whether they could decide what unfamiliar words meant by seeing similar familiar words. Examples: geography speedometer geometry micrometer geology telemeter geode meter pedestal divide pedestrian dividend pedal division pedometer divider divisive complete universe completion university completely universal complement universality This was handled by volunteer discussion. No tests were ever given. They were not required to turn in papers. The emphasis throughout was on their getting more in- formation, on their manipulating parts of words to make new words, and on their figuring out meanings of previously un- familiar vocabulary. We kept the list growing but retained roots, prefixes, and suffixes that they already knew. Repeti- tion, as well as interest, seemed to be the key to their learning. 4. I made definitions to be puzzled out and encouraged the students to make def- initions for me and others to puzzle out. If more than one answer was suggested, it was accepted if we agreed that it was reasonable. Examples: If hydra means water, how would we make a word to mean sounds in water? If we have a machine that takes photo- graphs at a great distance, how could we make a word to mean photo from a dis- tance? If picto means picture, what word could we create that would name the picture writing done by ancient man? If someone plays, what word could we create that would show that he is the one who plays? If aqua means water, what word might we create to name an instrument that picks up sounds in water? 5. I encouraged them to create sen- tences, paragraphs, and/or stories making up codes with roots, prefixes, and suf- fixes. We accepted everything, and they were eager to share and to decipher each other's "messages." I mimeographed their first efforts and gave all a copy which inspired even more "works." Examples: Sentences: A cow is a quadragastro. The unipod fell off its custombuilt uni- cycle. This guy was a hexafingered freak. A nonasicle is a nine-sided popsicle. Paragraphs: I overheard a triologue among M., S., and P. They were discussing their quin- taped friend. He, they said, was so multilateral that he dazzled multioculos. For days he made everyone go in pseudo- circles and even semi-squares. Anonyanthrops One day as a decigenarian was auto- porting himself to school, he was stopped by multimicroorganisms. After phono- telosing them for a while, the decigenar- ian found that they biosed on the planet of multihydros in the solar system of nonacosm. Having nothing else to phono- telos to the multimicroorganisms, he said goodbye and facered his way in his hydroport. One night I was watching the idiot box when a news broadcast came on. It was about some anthrops from a tele aster. They had pseudoears, microeyes, and tetra arms. The arch's corpus was purple in chrome, and the others' derms were green. They were afraid of pyre but philed hydro. When they wanted to hypno, a megamachine helped them to</page><page sequence="3">HYDROZOOLOGY IN THE MICROCOSM 863 get to hypno. When they wanted to logue, they would beam a thought from psyche to psyche. The name of their cosmos was Facilflect and was shaped like a glob of chewing gum. Short Compositions: A Rare Occurrence in Maniology Yesterday, I had what I considered the most discombooberated anthrops in this cosmos come to me. He complained of being biopsycho and having frequent spells of multi-autos. He said other an- throps circumexited when he approached because of his split personality. He felt unphilled. I rapidly oscillated my manugraph. I then put this anthrops into my dyna- mated megamaniamicroscopictelesubma- chine. This is my own invention but is something like a psychomenter. How- ever, this machine seemed to be in a mania of its own. I saw that my patient had fallen into hypnoness. I cryptically diagnosed the ticker tape that ran out of my machine. Was this possible? Yes. A diacephaloed anthrops! It My name is Ul-ner. On my cosmos I am a scientist who ologies marine cor- puses sub hydro. Just the other day I was dia and circum the aqua marine, and I came across a pseudo pyr morph of epiderm in an aster morph with a chrome of red. This zoo was hypno, so it was facil to catch it by its non dynam pod. The other pod was mega and could flect very dynamo-like. I became famous. My macro mal zoo became transpan known, and demos from all the cosmos came to see it. It became the arch interest of all scientists and was put in all new biblis. One day as I was logy for a debate, it turned against me. Ante I could do anything, it went off. It took the bios of many anthrops and was very danger- ous. Then, by my own manu, I killed it. When it was dying, I made some photo- graphs and phonographs. Then, when it was dead, I looked through my infra-red telescope and saw its psyche going away. After its psyche had departed, we took the soma and put it in a deep crypt. Don't Give a Dynamic Pyr Hello, funseekers. While eating lunch in the Adirondack Mountains, I came across a megadynamaniac. He would scream as loud as he could and pound rocks together. He was anthropomor- phic, but his derm was green. I sensed his psyche was a little sub in relation to normal anthrops. From his arm-like appendage he brought out a teleocular and looked at me. At once he came over to me and uttered a simple unilogue. He asked me if I had some instant pyr. I handed him a bibli of matches. At once he faced the North Aster and uttered a crypt mono- logue. He quickly sped away and struck a match. With great happiness he joined some pyr to some queer powder. At once there was a megaboom. With childish glee that sub-psyche-anthrops threw in- stant pyr (lighted matches) across the meadow creating a very mal mega pyr. If it's one thing I can't stand, it's an auto-propelled mal mega pyr dyna- maniac. Some outgrowths (which teachers, alas, are not always privileged to learn about) were immediate and apparent. Students of other teachers came in to ask for our mimeographed material. Teachers noticed their students using new vocabulary and commented to the students and to me. Students became intensely interested in their own vocabularies. More subtle accomplishments were that students approached unfamiliar words with a new interest and developed a keen ability to reason out their mean- ings. Thus, accidentally, with my stu- dents showing me the way, I hit upon the most effective method I have ever used for teaching vocabulary.</page></plain_text>
