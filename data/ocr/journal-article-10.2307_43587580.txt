Tell Qiri, the first site to be studied in this project, was excavated during 1975-1977 in three seasons of six weeks each. The excavation of the site, which was destined to be completely destroyed due to its loca- tion within Kibbutz Hazorea, was initiated and partly financed by the Israel Department of Antiqui- ties as a rescue operation. The excavation of the site was a joint project of the Department of Antiquities, the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew Univer- sity and the Israel Exploration Society. It was directed by A. Ben-Tor and Y. Portugali, and A. Schwarzfeld and B. Brandl were the senior staff members. The work was carried out by local workers and students of archaeology of the Hebrew Univer- sity. Among the many who also took part are G. Hurvitz and O. Misch of the Institute of Archaeol- ogy, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, D. Esse of the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, and M. Hunt and J. Koss, both of the University of Califor- nia, Berkeley. We wish to extend our warmest thanks to them all. During the three seasons of excavation, Kibbutz Hazorea hosted the expedition. The kibbutz placed its various facilities at our disposal and helped us with many of the technical and logistical problems - always a major burden of an archaeological excava- tion. We wholeheartedly thank the kibbutz for all its help, and especially E. Meyerhof and S. Kocha vi who also participated in the excavation itself, as well as A. Ben-Zvi and D. Erez who were in constant contact with us and were always ready to offer assistance. Among those who took part in the technical prepa- ration of this volume were M. Sarig and R. Bonfil who drew the finds and Z. Radovan who served as photographer. The restoration and treatment of the finds were carried out in the laboratories of the Israel Museum. To them, and especially to R. Bonfil, with- out whose devoted work the preparation of this report would have been even more delayed, we extend our gratitude. Thanks are also due to all those who prepared reports for this volume and who endeavored to meet our deadline despite their own tight schedules. We wish to thank all those who took part in the technical preparation of this volume: to E. Cindorf who edited the manuscript, to S.B. Schwarcz who typed it, to H. Davis who proofread the manuscript and saw it through final publication, to the staff of Hamakor Press for their cooperation, and especially to Y. Fleitman who designed the extremely complicated layout of this volume. Finally, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to J. Aviram, former director of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University, who provided assistance during the excavations, and to M. Bar-On, current director of the Institute of Archaeology, for his assistance in the publication of this volume. All of the drawings of the artifacts are on a scale of 1:5, unless otherwise stated; the Plans are 1:100, unless otherwise stated.

XIX</page><page sequence="15">INTRODUCTION A. Ben-Tor The western Jezreel Valley, the focus of the Yoq- ne'am Regional Project,1 is triangular shaped and extends over an area of approximately 120 sq. km.2 The three points of the triangle are the ancient sites of Megiddo, Shimron and Tell 'Amr. This is one of the most favorable regions of the country, enjoying an almost perfect combination of fertile soil, abundant water and temperate climate. In this region are three sites whose dimensions exceed 50 dunams - Shimron, Megiddo and Yoq- ne'am; these were undoubtedly the major cities of the region. The last two sites guarded the northern exits of the important passes through the Carmel Ridge, the 'Ara Pass (Megiddo) and the Milh Pass (Yoq- ne'am) connecting the Via Maris and the Jezreel Valley. From here extend two major international routes: one from Megiddo leading north-northeast via Hazor to Damascus and beyond, and the other running from Yoqne'am to the north-northwest via Acco to Phoenicia and beyond. Shimron dominates the important route junction linking the eastern and western Jezreel Valley on the one hand, and the valley and Lower Galilee to the north, on the other. The combination of fertile soil, abundant water, excellent climate and important local and interna- tional routes resulted in the establishment of a large number of settlements of a variety of sizes which dotted the valley throughout history. It should be noted, however, that the settlement map as it is now known, as the result of modern archaeological surveys, is not an exact reflection of the situation in ancient times. Damage is caused to sites by nature as well as by man. A good example is Tel Shem near Kefar Yehoshua (see Plan 1), which has gradually been destroyed over the past few decades by the farmers of the region, who used its soil to fertilize their land. The mound of Tel Shem, which is still clearly visible in photographs taken some fifty years ago, has by now disappeared completely; ancient artifacts removed from the site can be found in houses of the local inhabitants. Almost 50 percent of Tell Qiri's original size was still visible in 1975, but today it is completely covered with houses of Kibbutz Hazorea. Other sites in the vicinity, such as Tel Yitzhaki and Tel Alonim, have been completely destroyed over the past few years as a result of agricultural and construction activities. The numerous fish ponds in the valley conceal more than one site, as is evidenced by chance finds made in their immediate vicinity. This is not said in order to place the blame on anyone: the authorities are well aware of the situation, and attempts are constantly being made to protect, save and preserve the ancient sites. The excavation of Tell Qiri is only one example. However, saving the sites is not always possible, and the desire to salvage all the sites - just because they are ancient - cannot always be fulfilled, nor does it seem to be always justified. A rescue excavation prior to destruction - when inevitable - to obtain an idea of the nature of the site and to ascertain whether there 1 .

Meyerhof, member of the kibbutz and local trustee of the Israel Department of Antiquities, was present during the laying of the foundations of every building. The extent of the site, as presented in Plan 3, is based mainly on information supplied by him. 1</page><page sequence="16">is sufficient justification to halt the building activities is an option made necessary by the realities of mod- ern life. Damage to, or even the complete disappearance of sites is the fate of the smaller sites as a rule, though even the larger sites are not immune, as can be seen, for example, in the intensive building activity which took place some 35 years ago on the western slope of Tel Shimron. However, the small sites are naturally much more affected, and as a result the number of small sites in proportion to the larger ones, as observed in the region today, does not necessarily reflect the situation in ancient times, a fact that must be taken into consideration in any discussion or attempted reconstruction of the pattern of settlement in the region in those days. It was the above-mentioned combination of a large number of sites of different sizes, located in a fertile region and situated along major routes of interna- tional as well as local importance, which attracted us to the region. Such a situation called for a study of sites, not only as individual sites located in a region of great potential but, above all, it required a regional approach, namely, a study of the interrelationship of the sites. A variety of questions can be posed here, such as the relation between the size of a site and its location, the expansion of sites and the relative importance of a site in its region, the relation between the city and its satellites (is Qiri in the territory of Megiddo or Yoqne'am? What is the relationship between Qiri and Qashish, and between each of these and Yoqne'am?). The results of the excavation of a single site, such as Qiri, can at best provide a partial answer to one or more of these questions. It is essen- tial, furthermore, that the archaeological data be supported and augmented by information derived from other fields of research. It seems to us, however, that in working in a region such as the Jezreel Valley, such questions must be considered and should serve as a guide in evaluating the archaeological data obtained from the sites. Another important aspect to be considered is the contribution a site such as Qiri, in its own right, can make to our knowledge. The almost exclusive targets of the archaeological investigation in this as well as in the neighboring countries have until recently been the major urban centers. There archaeologists searched for, and invariably found, the large fortification sys- tems, the temples and palaces, the luxury imported and local artifacts, and at times even the greatest Plan 1.

For this reason the archaeological pic- ture of the various periods in this country is based on the results of the excavations of sites such as Hazor, Megiddo, Dan, Samaria, Jerusalem and others, the major cities of the country. As a result, the picture obtained is deficient and incomplete: we know almost nothing about the majority of the country's inhabitants, those who lived in the scores of smaller villages, whose very names are unknown. The voice of the villager - who had little need for written records and left none behind to tell his story - is silent. It is only in recent years that we have witnessed a change in the orientation of archaeological investiga- tion, which has now begun to include also the smaller villages. We hope that the excavation at Tell Qiri will contribute some share towards the reconstruction of village life in this country in ancient times. It should be pointed out, however, that the state of the archaeological remains at Tell Qiri allows for the above questions to be considered only for one of the wide range of periods during which the site was occu- pied, the Iron Age. Only from this period have the excavations revealed somewhat substantial amounts of data, while the archaeological remains dating to the later as well as to the earlier periods are considera- bly less impressive. Tell Qiri is located on the slopes of Mount Carmel near the junction of the mountain and the valley. As a result, Qiri does not have the typical shape of a mound, like the other mounds in the valley, even though it is one. It does not rise above its surround- ings, and appears to be a continuation of the natural slope of the mountain. When we arrived at the site in 1975, the destruction of the mound was already in a very advanced stage: the kibbutz houses covered close to half its area. The western part of the site is cut by a road connecting the kibbutz with the town of Yoqne'am and the Megiddo-Haifa road. The western edge of the site is covered with a forest that was planted a few years ago. In the east, where the site slopes steeply towards the Shofet River, damage was caused by the digging of military positions during the War of Indepen- dence. And lastly, the southern part of the mound was severely damaged by bulldozers which levelled the area for the construction of new houses. The location and size of each of the nine areas of excava- tion were determined by such factors as limitations of time, the extent of previous damage, the location and ground plan of the houses to be constructed, and not necessarily by purely archaeological considerations. Our project was the first archaeological excavation to be carried out at the site. Previous knowledge of the site was derived solely from chance finds and surveys.3 These surveys revealed pottery of "all peri- ods," mainly Neolithic, Chalocolithic, Early Bronze I, Middle Bronze I, Late Bronze and Iron Age.4 It should be noted that during the thorough survey which we conducted at the site prior to the excava- tions, we collected pottery of only the Early Bronze I, Middle Bronze II, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods, none of which is mentioned in the Official Gazette of the Government of Israel. There was no doubt, however, that we were surveying the same site. It is also interesting that our survey uncov- ered absolutely no Iron Age sherds, the period, as was later attested, that constitutes the most intensive occupation of the site, with an accumulation more than 4 meters thick! This discrepancy between the results of our survey and of the earlier ones, as well as the discrepancy between the survey results and the situation as revealed by the excavation of the site, convinced us that it was essential to improve the traditional survey methods and develop a new strategy. While surveying the sites in the area, we therefore attempted to evolve and test new approaches.5 The small, damaged and unimpressive site of Tell Qiri yielded an astonishingly rich and varied quantity of remains of different periods. In this volume we have attempted to summarize and present the major results, fully aware of the fact that many questions raised by the excavation are still unresolved and the study of some aspects has only just begun. Of these, the following should be mentioned: Smallest Space Analysis (= SSA) of the various pottery assemblages, by strata, loci, etc.; locational analyses (which types come from which areas?); provenance studies (by NAA, thin sectioning, etc.) of pottery and other arti- facts found at Qiri, and suspected of having been 3. Information about Tell Qiri prior to the excavations is derived mainly from the following three sources: Israel Department of Antiquities List of Ancient Sites , Official Gazette of the Government of Israel, No. 1091 (18.5.1964), p. 1386 (Hebrew); E. Anati et al., Hazo- rea , I, Archivi 5 (Brescia 1973), p. 25; E. Meyerhof, "Ten Years of Survey of Beth Wilfrid, Hazorea," Mitekufat Haeven 4-5 (1963), pp. 25-35. 4.

We hope that these subjects will be dealt with and incorporated in the overall framework of the YRP publications. For the sake of convenience in presenting the Tell Qiri material, we have divided this volume into three parts: the late periods (Arab to Persian); the Iron Age; the early periods (Late Bronze to Neolithic). This is, of course, an artificial division made neces- sary by the present state of the site, in which the Iron Age constitutes the majority of the finds. Architectural evidence was not found from all the periods, from which objects were recovered. Some periods yielded only stray finds out of stratigraphie context, which provided evidence only of some human activity or presence at the site. Since Tell Qiri is now entirely covered with houses and no future excavations are likely, it will not be possible to fill in the gaps in the stratigraphie sequence of the site by future excavations. We have therefore termed "strata" and assigned stratum numbers only to those periods represented at Qiri by architecture as well as by artifacts. Periods represented by artifacts alone were not assigned numbers and are referred to as "periods." The stratigraphie and "period" sequence of Tell Qiri is as follows: "Periods": Represented Finds only, at Qiri Strata no architecture Ottoman + Crusader + Umayyad + Late Roman/Byzantine I Early Roman II Hellenistic III Persian IV Iron III V-VI Iron II VII Iron I VIII-IX (Late Bronze II?) + Late Bronze I + Middle Bronze II X Middle Bronze I + Early Bronze I (II?) + Chalcolithic + Neolithic XI Plan 3.

Avissar Hebrew University, Jerusalem REMAINS LATER THAN STRATUM I In 1975, at the beginning of the first season of excava- tions, a number of trial squares were opened which yielded remains of the Late Roman-Early Byzantine, Early Roman, Hellenistic and Persian periods - Strata I-IV. These include squares D-E/3-4 in Area Al (see Plan 4), L/4 in Area A2 (see Plan 6) and L-M/9-10 in Area B (see Plan 5). In all these squares the upper stratum was disturbed by a number of late Muslim burials of various types. In Area Al (Plan 4) three burials (T. 1-3) were discovered, which pene- trated deep into the remains of Strata I-II and par- tially destroyed the walls (W. 103 and W. 114) of these strata. These three burials were all orientated southwest to northeast. In all cases in which the skeletal remains were intact (as in T. 2), the body faced south, the usual orientation for bodies in Mus- lim graves. T. 1 and T. 3 consisted of stone-lined cists covered with stone slabs.1 In T. 2 only four large stone slabs, about 35x90 cm., were placed upright behind and partly on the body. The graves contained only the bones of the deceased and yielded no finds which could provide a more exact date for these burials. Burial T. 4 in Area A2 (Plan 6) was laid directly on the stone slabs of the floor of the Persian period and penetrated through the Hellenistic stratum. The out- line of the burial could not be traced, and only the upper part of the body was covered with stone slabs. The direction of the body indicates that this was a Muslim burial. Because of the absence of any asso- ciated finds, it was impossible to date it more precisely. In Area B ten Muslim burials (T. 5-14, see Plan 5 and Photo 3) penetrated into the Hellenistic stratum. These burials were simple shallow pits, their outline marked by a line of stones, and they were covered with flat stone slabs. The size of these tombs was approximately 60x180 cm. All the bodies were interred with their heads to the west and facing south. T. 6 and T. 7 contained child burials. Only T. 5 and T. 6-7 yielded some finds. In T. 5 several beads and a stone pendant were found (Fig. 6:14-20, Photo 1:1). Good parallels for these beads come from the Muslim 1 . For a similiar type of cist grave, see the Muslim ceme- tery at Tell el-Hesi; Tell el-Hesi , pp. 38-39 and Pis. 5:6; 20. At Tel Mevorakh this type of grave, Type B, is assigned to the Crusader period as well as to 19th- century Muslim burials; Mevorakh, p. 8. The same type of stone-lined cist grave, covered with stone slabs, has been found at Tel Yoqne'am, one of which (not yet published) yielded beads, pendants, bronze bracelets and perforated silver coins in secondary use from the reign of Mahmud I, H. 1143-1168 = 1730-1754 AD, minted in Constantinople. The Yoqne'am graves could therefore not be earlier than the middle of the 18th century AD and they are most probably of a later date. Exact parallels for the jewellery from the Tel Yoqne'am grave come from the Muslim cemetery at Tell el-Hesi, which probably dates to the same period; see Tell el-Hesi , pp. 114-116. 7</page><page sequence="21">cemetery at Tell el-Hesi2 and exact parallels for some of the beads occur in a grave at Yoqne'am.3 The bead shown in Fig 6:14 is made of red glass threaded with turquoise in a fern pattern. Glass ves- sels made in this technique, "thread-glass," flour- ished in Egypt and Syria up to the 13th century AD and were gradually replaced by about the middle of the century by imitations in painted enamel, but beads in thread glass apparently continued to be produced at the same time.4 The bead in Fig 6:18, Photo 1:1 seems to be of Venetian origin.5 Thirty-three of the beads from T. 6-7 were of light turquoise-blue opaque glass, rounded and somewhat irregular in shape and size (Fig. 6:21-22, Photo 1:2). Exactly the same kind of beads are reported from Muslim burials on the Golan Heights.6 In addition to these turquoise beads, there were a large number of tiny beads, some of dark red glass, like those common in the Yoqne'am grave. Accordingly, these burials, T. 5-14, should proba- bly be dated to the late eighteenth or nineteenth century AD, as at Yoqne'am and Tell el-Hesi. In Area C two additional graves came to light, one in square I, L. 587 and the other in square J/ 13. These graves correspond in type and size to graves T. 5-14 in Area B and probably belong to the same burial ground. 2. Tell el-Hesi , pp. 93-101, Pis. 57-67. 3. See above, n. 1. 4. C.J.

Walls W. 103 (partly destroyed by T. 2), W. 107 and W. 113, as well as patches of a beaten-earth floor, are assigned to Stratum I, which should be dated to the Late Roman-Early Byzantine period on the basis of the associated ceramic evidence. The few potsherds7 assigned to Stratum I on strati- graphic or typological grounds are illustrated in Fig. 1:1-6, 12, 19-20, 29. Several types of "Galilean" bowls were uncovered (Fig. 1:1-6), most of them in Area Al. Fig. 1:1 represents Loffreda's Type 2, which is dated from 250-450 AD.8 The floruit of this type is 300-450 AD (Late Roman period).9 Two variants of Loffreda's Type 3 are illustrated in Fig. 1:2, 3. This type is dated c. 135-350 AD.10 Fig. 1:4, 5 represents Loffreda's Type 6, which is dated 300-450 AD and corresponds to Types 3.1 and 3.2 at Khirbet Shema, where they are dated from the mid-third to the beginning of the fifth century AD." "Galilean" bowls of this type were also found at the Zeid Farm at Beth-She'arim. They are assigned to the third and first half of the fourth centuries AD.12 Fig. 1:6 represents a small base fragment of Afri- can Red-Slip ware. This ware first appears in this area in the third century AD, mainly Hayes' Forms 48-50. Our piece is of a fine fabric, thin-walled, with a thin, glossy slip and fine turning marks on the exterior; it accordingly seems to correspond to Hayes' Form 50 A which is dated 230/40-360 AD.13 African Red- Slip ware of Hayes' Form 50 is also found at the Zeid Farm at Beth She'arim.14 Fig. 1:12 represents an open cooking bowl with horizontal handles. This type of shallow open cook- ing vessel appears at Shikmona in pit 319, which is dated to the second century AD. 15 At Beth She'arim it is dated to the third and the first half of the fourth centuries AD.16 At Caesarea it is also dated to the fourth century AD, and from then onwards this type of vessel appears, in slightly different shape, at most sites from the Byzantine period and continues in use throughout the eighth century and even later.17 A fairly close parallel for the jug shown in Fig. 1:29 was found at the Zeid Farm at Beth She'arim.18 Conclusion In comparing the chronological ranges of the above pottery types with parallels from other sites, it appears that all these types overlap within the time span 300-350 AD, which is apparently also the approximate date for Stratum I at Tell Qiri. REMAINS OF THE EARLY ROMAN PERIOD STRATUM II IN AREA Al The architectural remains of Stratum II, like those of Stratum I, are scanty and no plan of a complete building could be obtained (Plan 4:2-3). Two phases were discerned in Stratum II. The lower, main phase, lib (Plan 4:3), consists of walls W. 109, W. 112, W. 1 14, and W. 115. Walls W. 109 and W. 1 14 were badly damaged when tomb T. 1 was dug. Associated with these walls are sections of a beaten-earth floor. In phase IIa (Plan 4:2) Walls W. 109, W. 1 12 and W. 1 15 continued in use, and W. 104 and W. 106 were added. W. 104 partly overlay W. 114, which went out of use. Remains of a beaten-earth floor could be distin- guished 20-30 cm. above the floor of phase lib. According to the pottery, which consists mainly of fragments of cooking vessels and storage jars, the architectural remains of Stratum II were apparently part of a domestic building. The Roman pottery from Area Al assigned to Stratum II is presented in Fig. 1:7-9, 11, 13-18,21-25, 7. The description of the late period pottery is given in figures according to the Munsell Chart. 8.

Due to the greatly disturbed nature of Area Al, it was impossible to separate the material of the two phases and they are therefore treated here together. The bowl (Fig. 1:10), cooking pot (Fig. 1:26 and Photo 2) and jug (Fig. 1:30) were found on other parts of the mound, and not in a stratigraphie context, but they are discussed together with the material of Area Al since they seem to belong to the same period. Photo 2. Cooking pot from Early Roman period (see Fig. 1:26). Two fragments of plain bowls (Fig. 1:7, 8) display a slightly inward sloping, incurved rim. One has rib- bing on the inside (Fig. 1 :8). The form corresponds to PCC Type 51.1, dated from 200 BC to 68 AD. The best parallels for this bowl can be found at Khirbet Qumran, Niv. Ib, dated by Lapp to 50-31 BC.19 The small carinated bowl with vertical handles and ledge rim (Fig. 1:9) corresponds to PCC Type 51.6 dated to 50-68 AD, and is paralleled at Jaffa, where it is also dated to the first century AD.20 No exact parallel could be found for the-^bowl shown in Fig. 1:10, but on the basis of its form and fabric it seems to belong to the Roman period. Of somewhat similar fabric is the base fragment of a mortarium (Fig. 1:11). The numerous fragments of cooking vessels found in square D-E/3-4 were mostly sherds of casseroles. The dominant types are presented in Fig. 1:13-18. Casseroles begin to appear in the Hellenistic period,21 are common throughout the Roman period and dis- appear towards the end of the third century AD. They are totally absent in the Meiron cistern group, which is dated 300 AD.22 The best parallels for our casseroles as well as cooking pots and storage jars can be found at Capernaum. All of our casseroles seem to be variants of Loffreda's Type A17, which flourished in the Early Roman period dated 63 BC to 135 AD.23 The later shallow and sharply carinated casseroles, Loffreda's Type A16, are absent at Tell Qiri. The cooking pots (Fig. 1:21-26) correspond to Loffreda's Type A4, with a floruit in the Early Roman period.24 The storage jars (Fig. 1:34-38) correspond to Lof- freda's Type Al.25 The jug (Fig. 1:27) and jug base (Fig. 1:28) correspond to Loffreda's Type AIO, dated to the Early Roman period, as are the juglets (Fig. 1:31, 32). 26 The jug (Fig. 1:30) is paralleled at Shik- mona.27 The juglet with cup-shaped mouth (Fig. 1 :33) is typical of the Early Roman period. It corresponds to PCC Type 3J.1, dated 37 BC-70 AD. It, too, is paralleled at Jaffa, where it is dated to the first cen- tury AD.28 Fig. 1:39 represents the nozzle of a "Hero- dian" lamp. These lamps are restricted to the Early Roman period. They first appear in the middle or towards the end of Herod's reign and continue until the middle of the second century AD, a date fixed on the basis of finds from the Judean Desert caves.29 19.

On the basis of the glass finds (see below, p. 36), it seems that the date of Stratum II can be established more pre- cisely, from the last quarter of the first century BC to the first quarter of the first century AD. REMAINS OF THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD STRATUM III Area Al, Squares D-E/3-4 At the lowest level in Area Al we reached a beaten earth floor with an oven (tabun) (see Plan 4:4). No clear architectural remains are associated with this Plan 4. Detailed plan of Area Al, Squares D-E/3-4, Strata I-III (Scale 1:100). 11</page><page sequence="25">floor. Except for a few earlier sherds, the pottery from this level is wholly Hellenistic, and the level was accordingly assigned to Stratum III. The Hellenistic pottery from Area Al is illustrated in Fig. 2:1, 2, 14, 16, 19, 21. Fig. 2:1 represents the body fragment of an ETS-I cup, which corresponds to Samaria Form 21. 30 According to Gunneweg's comparative study, this form should be dated from 80 BC to 50 AD. At Tel Anafa this form first appears as early as 125 BC. Four of the six examples found there are dated between 125 and 80 BC and only two examples came from the Roman phase. On the basis of the color and the poor quality of the glaze, our piece also apparently belongs to the Hellenistic period.31 The small base fragment of a red-slipped Megarian bowl is presented in Fig. 2:2. Megarian bowls are dated to 150-50 BC.32 On the basis of its ware this fragment should not be classified as Eastern Sigillata.33 The design consists of a medal- lion with two concentric circles centered by a rosette with more than eight petals. Megarian bowls with this kind of base decoration, and obviously not made of ETS-I material, are reported from the Athenian Agora and dated there to the turn of the second century and the early years of the first century BC.34 The storage jar (Fig. 2:14) with very low neck and slightly outturned rim has its closest parallels at Bala tah (Shechem) and is dated there to 225-190 BC.35 Fig. 2:16 represents the base of a probable Knidian wine amphora of the early third century BC.36 Fig 2:19 represents the concave base of a jug. Con- cave bases first appear at Balatah in Stratum Illb, dated to 250-225 BC. At Beth-Zur all the water jugs recovered from the cistern display the same base type; they are dated to 140-100 BC.37 The fusiform unguentarium (Fig. 2:21) is of heavy ware and should be dated to the second century BC.38 According to the comparative study, the pottery from the lowest level encountered in Area Al repre- sents types which range chronologically over nearly the entire Hellenistic period, with the ETS-I cup fragment (Fig. 2:1) its latest piece, antedating the building activity of Stratum IIb. It seems that this area was an open space through- out the Hellenistic period. Area A 2, Square L/4 The uppermost level in Area A2 contained poor architectural remains, including walls W. 100, W. 101, W. 105 and W. Ill (Plan 6:1). Part of what seems to have been a stone-paved floor was preserved in the northwestern part of the square. In the middle of the square there seems to have been a pit which cut through the stone-paved floor of the upper level of the Persian stratum. The outline of the pit was partly marked by stones laid in a semicircle. This upper level was disturbed by a later burial, T. 4 (see above, p. 7). The pottery finds here are poor, but they point to a date in the Hellenistic period, probably in the second century BC, for this level. The base of the Roman amphora (Fig. 2:17) is of the "standard" Greco-Italic type, which should be dated to the second century BC.39 30. Samaria-Sebaste III, Fig. 81:1. 31. J. Gunneweg, I. Perlman, J.

The uppermost remains in square L/4 are there- fore assigned to Stratum III. Area B, Squares L-M/9-10 In Area B, partial remains of a substantial building (Plan 5, Photo 3) were unearthed; it could be assigned to the Hellenistic period on the basis of the ceramic and numismatic evidence (see below, p. 51). Because of the limited area dug, only part of the building was uncovered and no complete plan could therefore be obtained. The remains in Area B included a large stone-paved area (L. 500), probably an open courtyard, partly enclosed by walls W. 50, W. 51 and W. 52. Outside the limits of this courtyard, sections of a beaten earth floor could be discerned in L. 501 and part of a stone-paved floor in square M/9. The pottery finds associated with this building are poor. The pottery above the floor is mixed Hellenis- tic, Persian and Iron Age, as a result of the late burials T. 5-14 which disturbed the entire area (see above, p. 7). The small bowl with everted rim resembling a fish- plate (Fig. 2:3) was found beneath the floor of the Hellenistic building. This form has a long life span and is well known in the black-glazed ware of the third and second centuries BC.41 Our piece is of local decorated ware.42 At Bala tah (Shechem) this form appears among the local ware already in Stratum Illb, dated to 250-225 BC,43 and is well represented in the theater excavations at Samaria. The material from this excavation is dated to the first half of the third century BC, with a possible extension of some forms to the end of the third century BC.44 At Tirat Yehuda this form continues into the second century BC and is common in the later phase which comes to an end between 180 and 140 BC.45 The latest date for it is 100 BC.46 The mortarium (Fig. 2:8) is also paralleled at Samaria and is dated in the third century BC.47 At Beth-Zur, a mortarium, which seems to be of quite similar material but with a slightly different rim form, is dated to 175-165 BC.48 The storage jar (Fig. 2:13) exhibiting the slightly outturned rim of the collared type, which is still absent in the theater excavations at Samaria but becomes popular at Balatah (Shechem) in Stratum Ilia, is dated to 225-190 BC. It also has parallels at Tirat Yehuda.49 Conclusion As is indicated by the ceramic and numismatic evidence, a date somewhere in the middle of the third century BC seems appropriate for the erection of the Hellenistic building. This building probably con- tinued in use until the beginning of the second cen- tury BC. UNSTRATIFIED HELLENISTIC POTTERY Two bowls with incurved rims in Hellenistic deco- rated ware (Fig. 2:4, 5) correspond to PCC Type 151.1, dated to 200-100 BC.50 The form is derived from Attic ware and is abundant in the theater exca- vations at Samaria in local black-slipped as well as red-slipped ware. It is dated there to the third century BC.51 The bowl with outturned rim, decorated with a dull black slip (Fig 2:6), corresponds to PCC Type 151.3, dated to 200-25 BC.52 This is also a basic form in Attic ware,53 and local imitations begin to appear as early as the beginning of the third century BC.54 40.

Architectural remains and intrusive late graves from Area B, Stratum III. The handle of a skyphos in local ware (Fig. 2:7) should be dated to the first half of the second century BC.55 Cooking pots with a convex neck (Fig. 2:9) seem to be more common in the earlier part of the Hellenistic period, the third and the first half of the second centuries BC.56 The cooking pot (Fig. 2:10) corre- sponds to PCC Type 71.1, with the best parallels coming from Beth Zur, dated 175-190 BC.57 The neck of a storage jar with a long collar (Fig. 2: 1 1 ) is typical of the end of the Hellenistic period and is still found in the Early Roman period.

A storage jar of the collared type with a more elongated neck (Fig. 2:15) is common at Tell el-Ful, and is dated from 135 to 63 BC.61 The jug (Fig. 2:18) is typical of the second century BC. It begins to appear at Balatah as early as in Stratum Ilia, and is common at Tell el-Ful in Period IV B, dated to 135-100 BC.62 The fragment of a wheelmade lamp with a dull black slip (Fig. 2:22) appears to be a local imitation of Howland's Type 32 (Broneer Type XII), dated from the second quarter of the third century BC to at least the end of the century and perhaps a little later; it has parallels at Samaria-Sebaste.63 Conclusion On the basis of the small quantity of pottery uncov- ered which could be assigned to the Hellenistic period, it appears that the site was quite sparsely occupied in this period. The comparative study of the pottery finds indi- cates that chronologically they cover the entire Helle- nistic period, though most of the activity on the site seems to have occurred in the third and first half of the second centuries BC. REMAINS OF THE PERSIAN PERIOD STRATUM IV Area A2, Square L/4 Stratigraphie remains that could be assigned to the Persian period came to light in square L/4 in Area A2. Three levels could be distinguished which belonged to the Persian period (see Plan 6:2). The Upper Level The upper level contained the remains of a partly stone-paved floor related to the fragmentary wall W. 1 10 (Plan 6:2). The material from above and below this floor is illustrated in Figs. 2:30, 31; 3:9, 17; 4: 6,9, 13, 14. The storage jar with rounded shoulders (Fig. 4:9, Photo 4:6) was found above the paved floor. It cor- responds to Stern Type F, dated to the fifth-fourth centuries BC. This is the only round-shouldered stor- age jar fragment which came to light in this area; all the other fragments belong to storage jars with angu- lar shoulders and its various subtypes.64 The storage jar fragments with angular shoulders and very low 61.

The mortaria (Figs. 2:30, 3 1 ; 3:9), on the basis of parallels, seem to belong to the flat-based type, Stern Type 5a.66 The mortaria with simple rim (Fig. 2:30, 31) are common at Tell Keisan and Taa- nach. At the former site they already appear in Niv. 4, dated to the seventh century BC, and continue into the Persian period, Niv. 3a, dated to 450-380 BC. The material from Taanach is dated to the second half of the fifth century BC.67 The heavy mortarium with thickened rim of trian- gular section (Fig. 3:9) also begins to appear in the late Iron Age and should be dated mainly from the seventh to fifth centuries BC.68 Only a single fragment of a mortarium with high ring base, Stern Type 5b,69 came to light above the floor in square L/4, while in Area H, the Persian cemetery, this type was abun- dant. The horizontal handle (Fig. 3:17) seems to belong to a crater, Stern Type D4, dated to the sixth to fourth centuries BC.70 The neck of a "torpedo" jar (Fig. 4:6) corresponds to Stern Type G, with a date in the fifth-fourth cen- turies BC.71 Conclusion On the basis of the pottery evidence, a date for the upper Persian level is indicated in the second half of the fifth century, probably continuing into the fourth century BC. The Lower Floor About 30 cm. beneath the upper floor, another floor of whitish beaten earth could be distinguished. No architectural remains are associated with this level. The pottery originating beneath this floor is illus- trated in Figs. 2:27; 4:10; 5:3, 8, 9, 16, 24. The mortarium (Fig. 2:27) is decorated on the outside with rouletting, which seems to be a rather late feature. Rouletting on Attic pottery does not appear before 390/380 BC.72 It has been found, how- ever, on two bowls from Qadum, where the Persian period pottery group is dated to the fifth century BC, with an emphasis on the second half of the century. This date seems to be appropriate for our mortarium. The form is also paralleled at Taanach and Tell Kei- san, with a date in the second half of the fifth century BC.73 The storage jar (Fig. 4:10) corresponds to Stern Type H6, which is dated from the sixth to the fourth centuries BC.74 A good parallel comes from Tel Mevorakh, where this type originated in Pit 1, which is assigned to Stratum V, dated from the mid-fifth to the beginning of the fourth centuries BC.75 The amphora (Fig. 5:3), probably of Samian origin, seems to belong to the earlier type with shorter neck, and should be dated to the late sixth-early fifth centuries BC.76 A date in the late sixth-early fifth centuries should also be ascribed to the amphora bases (Fig. 5:8, 9). One (Fig. 5:8) apparently belongs to a Samian amphora and the other (Fig. 5:9) is probably the base of a Chian amphora.77 The flat base of a perfume juglet (Fig. 5:16) was too small to be classified under a specific category but, in any case, perfume juglets with flat bases do not appear before the fifth century BC.78 The fragment of a figurine of a nude youth with a cloak covering the shoulder (Fig. 5:24) belongs to the 65.

It corresponds to Pryce Type 12 and is dated to 500-450 BC.79 Conclusion On the basis of the comparative pottery study, a date in the early to mid-fifth centuries BC seems appro- priate for the lower level. The Pits The earliest remains of the Persian period consist of several ill-defined pits which cut into the Iron Age level in Area A2, in squares L/4, 6 and 7. The pottery from the pits is illustrated in Figs. 2:24, 29; 3:7, 10,11, 16; 4:3; 5:2, 4, 13, 19, 21-23. The bowl, Fig. 2:24, is paralleled at Megiddo, where it is dated from the sixth to the fourth centuries BC.80 The mortarium (Fig. 2:29) seems to belong to the flat-based type and appears in the late Iron Age level (Niv. 4) at Tell Keisan, dated to the seventh century BC; this form continues there into the Persian period level (Niv. 3), which is dated to 450-380 BC.81 Another mortarium (Fig. 3:7) is paralleled at Megiddo and is assigned there to Strata I-III.82 The rim and base fragments shown in Fig. 3:10, 11 are made of the same material. No exact parallels could be found for it but the form seems to be a variant of mortaria uncovered at Hazor, Taanach and Tell Jem- meh. This form should apparently be dated to the sixth and fifth centuries BC.83 The crater (Fig. 3:16) corresponds to Stern Type 2 and is common through- out the Persian period.84 A typical cooking pot of the Persian period is presented in Fig. 4:3. These cooking pots are usually dated to the fifth-fourth centuries BC.85 At Tell Kei- san, however, this type already appears in Niv. 3b, which is dated to 580-450 BC.86 The neck of a proba- ble Chian amphora (Fig. 5:2) should be dated to the late sixth and beginning of the fifth centuries BC. Chian amphorae have also been found at Tel Mevo- rakh and Tell Keisan.87 The amphora handle with a finger impression at its base (Fig. 5:4) should be dated from the early sixth to early fii ih centuries BC.88 The jug fragment with wide cylindrical neck and thickened rim (Fig. 5:13) falls under Stern Type H, which is dated to the fifth cen- tury BC. An unusual stamped impression on its han- dle unfortunately cannot be identified. This jug type is common on many sites of the Persian period and is also well represented at Qadum.89 Several fragments of probable East-Greek ware (Fig. 5:19, 21-23) were found. These sherds belong to closed vessels, all unslipped with black decoration. This ware is paralleled at Sukas and dated there to the end of the seventh and the sixth centuries BC.90 Imported East-Greek pottery first appeared on Palestinian sites in the late seventh century BC, and continued well into the Persian period.91 The fragment of a closed vessel (Fig. 5:23) is proba- bly of Cypriot origin and should be classified under White-Painted V, dated to 600-475 BC.92 Conclusion The comparative study of the pottery from the pits points to a date in the late sixth and early fifth centu- ries BC. 79.

Other fragments are surface finds from the various areas excavated. Bowls Only a few bowl types that were not identified as mortaria were uncovered. The bowl with inverted rim (Fig. 2:23) corresponds to Stern Type Al and is paral- leled at Tell Keisan and Tel Mevorakh.93 The bowls with ledge-rim (Fig. 2:24, 25) correspond to Stern Type A3. A good parallel for the bowl in Fig. 2:25 comes from Tell Keisan, dated to 450-380 BC.94 The bowl with carinated sides (Fig. 2:26) corresponds to Stern Type A5. This type is well represented at Qadum, where it is dated to the second half of the fifth century BC.95 Three different types of mortaria could be distin- guished: a small vessel with simple rim and probably flat base (Fig. 2:27-31); a larger mortarium with thickened rim and flat base (Fig. 3:5-11); and morta- ria with thickened rim and high ring base (Fig. 3:1-4). The small mortarium with simple rim (Fig. 2:28) appears at Tell Keisan as early as the late Iron Age level, Niv. 4, and continues in Niv. 3 of the Persian period.96 According to comparative material, the morta- rium fragment with thickened rim (Fig. 3:5) probably had a base of the type seen in Fig. 3:6. It corresponds to Stern Type 5a, as does the mortarium in Fig. 3:8. 97 The flat base (Fig. 3:12) is paralleled at Tel Mevorakh.98 The mortarium with thickened rim and high ring base (Fig. 3:1, Photo 4:1) corresponds to Stern Type 5b, and Fig. 3:2-4 probably belongs to the same group.99 The majority of mortaria found at Tell Qiri were of this type and came from the cemetery in Area H, while only one fragment of a high ring base came from Area A2. It seems that these mortaria were especially common towards the latter part of the Persian period, at the end of the fifth and the fourth centuries BC. In the Qadum group, which is dated to the second half of the fifth century BC, the flat-based mortaria were by far more numerous. Craters Aside from the nearly complete crater (Fig. 3:13, Photo 4:2) that was found in the shaft of a tomb in the cemetery in Area H, very few fragments could be defined as craters (Fig. 3: 14-15). They all correspond to Stern Type 2a, dated to the sixth-fourth centuries BC.100 The crater (Fig. 3:13) came from L. 1975, the shaft of tomb L. 1976, and was found together with the amphora handle (Fig. 5:5) and the bottle (Fig. 5:1 1). On the basis of its ware, the crater is of East- Greek origin. Somewhat similar vessels were found at Sukas and were dated there to the sixth century BC.101 East-Greek material is abundant at Palestinian sites, and vessels with a red-band decoration continue to appear, together with local imitations, down to the fourth century BC.102 Grooved handles are appar- ently a common feature on craters of the later Persian period, and are also reported from Qadum.103 A date around the middle of the fifth century BC should be appropriate for our crater and it is also indicated by the other pottery from,L. 1975, as well as by the tomb type.104 93. For a discussion of the various bowl types assigned to the Persian period, see Stern (above, n. 64), pp. 94-95.

Those shown in Fig. 4:1,3 correspond to the usual type common in the Persian period, with straight neck, everted rim and globular, sack-shaped body - Stern Type B, dated to the fifth-fourth centuries BC.105 This type apparently first appeared at an earlier date. A good parallel comes from Tell Keisan, Niv. 3b, which is dated to 580-450 BC.106 The hole-mouth cooking pot (Fig. 4:2) is also par- alleled at Tell Keisan, with a date from the sixth to the fourth centuries BC.107 Storage Jars Many of the storage jar types common in the Persian period have also been found at Tell Qiri. 108 Fig. 4:4, 5 presents fragments of two hole-mouth jars. They apparently correspond to Stern Type A or B, dated to the sixth-fifth centuries BC.109 Storage jars with slop- ing, rounded shoulders (Fig. 4:7-8) belong to Stern Type F, with a date in the fifth-fourth centuries BC. They show minor variations in the neck: with incised grooves (Fig. 4:7) or slight ridge (Fig. 4:8). Both elements are present on the storage jars from Tel Mevorakh,110 but the jar in our Fig. 4:8 seems to be closer to the degenerate Iron Age II forms found at Bethel and dated there to the sixth century BC.111 The storage jar (Fig. 4: 1 1 , Photo 4:3) corresponds to Stern Type H6, and Fig. 4:12 seems to correspond to Stern Type H2. Both types have a broad time range and occur throughout the Persian period and perhaps later as well.112 Fig. 4:15 presents a rim fragment, and Fig. 4:16, 17 two handle fragments of "basket jars." The type with the very low neck seems to correspond to Stern Type 12 dated to the fifth-fourth centuries BC, and parallels have been found at Khirbet Kinniyeh and Kadesh Barnea. At Sukas, a basket jar of this type served as a burial urn.113 Amphorae Among the fragments of East-Greek wine amphorae (Fig. 5:1-9), 114 the neck fragment (Fig. 5:1) seems to correspond to Plain White V, following Gjerstad's classification, and is dated to 600-475 BC.115 The slightly curved amphora handle (Fig. 5:5) corre- sponds to Plain White VI, following Gjerstad's classi- fication, and is dated to 475-400 BC. 116 Of the various types of amphora bases (Fig. 5:6-9),117 the amphora base in Fig. 5:6 should be dated late in the Persian period. It corresponds to Plain White VII amphorae, dated to 400-325 BC. A date late in the Persian period was also proposed by Boardman at Chios, where it is assigned to the end of Period II and dated no later than the third quarter of the fourth century BC.118 The amphora base in Fig. 5:7 may possibly belong to a "basket jar." Bottles The bottle in Fig. 5:10, Photo 4:4 was the only vessel found in tomb L. 1973; the bottle in Fig. 5:1 1, Photo 4:5, together with the crater (Fig. 4:13) and the amphora handle (Fig. 5:5), came from the shaft (L. 1975) of tomb 1976. The bottles correspond to Stern Types Al and A2, both of which are dated to the fifth-fourth centuries BC. A good parallel for our bottle (Fig. 5:11) was found at Tel Michal, where it is assigned to Stratum P4 and dated to the late fifth century BC.119 105. Ibid., pp. 100-102. 106. Keisan, PI. 21:9a. 107.

The jug with ridged neck (Fig. 5:12) is paral- leled at Taanach.120 The jug with wide cylindrical neck and thickened rim (Fig. 5:13) clearly belongs to Stern Type H, dated to the fifth-fourth centuries BC.m These jugs were apparently popular in the late fifth and fourth centuries BC. At Taanach this jug form appears in Period VIB, dated to 425-400 BC, but is absent in Period VIA loci. It is well represented at Qadum. At Tell Keisan there are numerous examples in pit F. 2003, which is assigned to the late Persian period and continues into the Hellenistic period.122 Our jar fragment has a stamped impression on its handle, a feature which usually appears only on stor- age jars. Juglets Fragments of four types of juglets were found (Fig. 5:14-17), among them two types of dipper juglets (Fig. 5:14, 15). Fig 5:14 corresponds to Stern Type A2a, dated to the fifth-fourth centuries BC, while Fig. 5:15 seems to be closer to Type A2b, dated to the fourth century BC.123 Fragments of perfume juglets (Fig. 5:16, 17) were also found; they should be dated to the fifth- fourth centuries BC.124 East-Greek and Other Imported Ware125 The bowl (Fig. 5: 18) is of East-Greek ware. This type appears at Sukas as early as the late seventh century BC and continues down to the middle of the sixth century.126 On Palestinian sites it appears later. Good parallels are found at Tannach and Tel Mevorakh.127 Fig. 5:20 represents the lower part of a lekythos. This form is dated from the mid-sixth to the mid-fifth centuries BC, it gradually disappears in the second half of the fifth century, and is replaced by the squat lekythos.128 Conclusion The actual settlement of the Persian period at Tell Qiri has not been located, but according to the com- parative study of the pottery, especially from Area A and the cemetery, Area H, the site seems to have been occupied during the entire Persian period. THE CEMETERY (AREA H) (Plan 7, Photo 5) In 1977 part of a cemetery was excavated in Area H. Since time and staff were lacking,129 only a small part of the cemetery could be revealed. It had apparently extended over a much larger area. All the 18 tombs excavated are orientated in a roughly north-south direction. There seems to be no internal order in the placement of the graves on the cemetery grounds, though they do not seem to inter- fere with one another.. Some of them are shaft tombs, which vary in size and workmanship. They are cut into bedrock and are rectangular in shape, and they consist of a very small shaft and a burial chamber separated from the shaft by stone slabs. All the cover- ing stones, which had been set in a diagonal position, were found in situ. This type is best represented by tombs T. 1946 (Photo 6: 1 , 2) and T. 1973 (Photo 7:1). In tombs T. 1948, T. 1950, T. 1964 and T. 1965, the burial chamber is rectangular and well cut, but the shaft is reduced to a small step. The eastern face of the burial chamber is cut vertically, while the western face is slightly undercut diagonally. In tombs T. 1949, T. 1951 and T. 1958 the burial chamber is reduced to a rectangular step cut into bedrock, with the cover- ing stones placed diagonally against it. The burial chambers in tombs T. 1952, T. 1955 and T. 1960 are elongated and oval in outline, without shafts. They are well cut into bedrock. Here, too, as in tombs T. 120.

The covering stone slabs were placed diagonally and rest on the soil which covers the burial chambers. Five of the tombs, T. 1953, T. 1956, T. 1963, T. 1967 and T. 1968, are simple pits, characterized by a shallow depression cut into bedrock and covering stone slabs placed on the soil over the burial. An unusual tomb is T. 1976. Here the grave was situated at the bottom of a wide T-shaped shaft, L. 1975, hewn 1.10 m. into bedrock. The direction of the grave is northeast to southwest. The grave at the bottom of the shaft was covered with well-cut stone slabs. Next to the shaft of tomb T. 1976 was a small, almost square platform, L. 1969(Photo7:l,2). It was laid in two courses of dressed stones and had a slightly stepped appearance. Adjacent to this plat- form was a semicircle of large stones which were placed partly over tomb T. 1976 and connected the platform with tomb T. 1973. Tomb T. 1973 should therefore be slightly later than tomb T. 1976 and should probably be dated to the fourth century BC, while the pottery from shaft L. 1975 of tomb T. 1976 points to a date for that tomb in the second half of the fifth century BC. A construction somewhat similar in plan to our platform was found at Tel Mevorakh in Photo 4. Persian storage jar (see Fig. 4:9) connection with the domestic architecture, and was assigned there to the Early Hellenistic period and defined as a "Phoenician" architectural element.130 At Tell Qiri this structure may possibly have been the base of a kind of funerary monument. Finds from the Tombs The earth covering bedrock in Area H contained a large amount of mixed pottery in the upper level (loci L. 1941, L. 1942, L. 1961) which was predominantly Persian, but also included a small amount of Iron 130.

At a lower level, in loci L. 1947, L. 1957, L. 1962 and L. 1966, predominantly Iron Age material and sherds of the Persian period were found. Several stone-cut sections of what was probably a drainage channel were uncovered directly beneath the surface on the northeastern side of the cemetery, L. 1945. This channel could be traced for a length of nearly four meters. According to the associated pot- tery, this drainage channel most likely originated in the Roman period. Nearly all the tombs excavated were completely empty, except for the bones of the deceased. Tomb T. 1950 yielded a single bead (Fig. 6:23, Photo 8:1), a fusiform bead of black and white glass with a spirally applied pattern forming a border at the edge, proba- bly Late Persian or Early Hellenistic.131 The only tomb which yielded a number of grave goods is T. 1952 (Fig. 6:24-43, Photo 8:2-4). This tomb contained a number of glass beads, two spindle whorls, a fragmentary bone pin, two bone buttons, a fragmentary bronze mirror and a bronze spatula with a flat, rounded blade and olive-shaped end. This form of spatula was in use at least from the Late Hellenistic period and throughout the Roman period, with slight variations in form.132 The closest parallel to our bronze spatula-probe is from Pompeii, where in 1818 a physician's house with a large number of surgical and pharmaceutical instruments was discovered. Our spatula and the rest 131.1 would like to thank Mrs. Maud Spear of the Israel Museum, who was kind enough to examine and date the beads. 132. W.

Tomb T. 1973 is the only tomb where a single pottery vessel, a bottle (Fig. 5:10), was found within the burial chamber. The bottle corresponds to Stern Type A2 and has parallels at Lachish in the pits associated with the "Residency," dated to the fifth- fourth centuries BC.134 The grave T. 1976 was empty except for a few human bones and several sherds of the Persian period, but the tomb shaft (L. 1975) yielded a nearly complete crater (Fig. 3:13, Photo 4:2), an amphora handle (Fig. 5:5) and a complete bottle (Fig. 5:11, Photo 4:5). These vessels should be dated probably to the second half of the fifth century BC.135 Conclusions Although the finds from the tombs are meager, the pottery from tomb T. 1973 and from the shaft L. 1975 of tomb T. 1976 clearly indicates a date in the latter half of the Persian period, the second half of the fifth and the fourth centuries BC for the cemetery.

The most remarkable feature of the cemetery at Tell Qiri is the nearly complete absence of grave goods, a fact which is directly opposed to the evi- dence from nearly all the other cemeteries of the Persian period, which yielded an abundance of finds as, for example, the rock-cut shaft tombs at 'Atlit137 or even the simple interments at Kamid el-Loz. 138 It is possible that the lack of grave goods may be due to burial customs of a specific ethnic group rather than an indication of the poverty of the population. The tombs of the Persian period have been divided by Stern according to their contents into "Western" Phoenician and " Eastern" Achaemenid types.139 The cemetery at Tell Qiri cannot be assigned to either of these groups. It should be noted that the group of tombs at Lachish was void of any grave goods, except for tombs 183 and 184, each of which contained a single pottery vessel. Stern raised the possibility that these tombs may have belonged to the local Jewish- Samaritan population.140 As for the population bur- ied at Tell Qiri, the anthropological examination yielded different results; see below, pp. 27-33. 136.

Arensburg Tel Aviv University During archeological excavations conducted at Tell Qiri, human remains were found in tombs related to the Persian period ( c . 500-400 BC).1 Anthropological material of the sixth-fourth centuries BC is relatively scarce in the Middle East and especially in Israel. The preceding Iron Age (twelfth-sixth centuries BC), in contrast, is well documented anthropologically.2 The early anthropological finds from Tell Qiri are there- fore exceedingly important and can throw light on the biological as well as social conditions of the popu- lation in Palestine during the Persian period. MATERIAL Some twenty-six skeletons were uncovered, most of them regrettably in a very fragmentary condition. Their distribution according to age and sex is repre- sented in Table 1. Four more or less complete skulls (H. 1-H. 4) were recovered and could be mended. Comparative osteological material from the Iron Age in Israel and the neighboring northern countries is available. Human remains that could be regarded with a measure of reliability as those of ancient Jews are, however, scanty. It is only during the Hellenistic- Roman periods (c. 100 BC-132 AD) that physical traits of the Jewish population from Israel have been described and analyzed.3 From the preceding Iron Age (c. 700-600 BC), only isolated remains have been recovered, mainly in Jerusalem,4 Jericho5 and the northern Negev.6 Non-Jewish remains from the Iron Age at Lachish, Israel have been described by Risdon,7 from Sialk, Iran by Vallois,8 and from the Persian period at Kish, Iraq by Buxton and Rice.9 According to an archeo- logical report pertaining to the Persian period at Kamid el-Loz in Lebanon,10 a study of the human remains uncovered at the site is in preparation. RESULTS The number of individuals in each grave varies from one to three. In tombs in which more than one person were buried, the remains of a male, a female (gener- ally adolescent) and a child may have been deposited. In other tombs only a child or a single adult was interred. Only a few long bones could be measured, thereby permitting an estimate of stature (see Table 1). * We are grateful to Professor M.S.

The mean difference in stature between the sexes (c. 19 cm.) is greater than in present-day popu- lations (mean 12 cm.), suggesting some unfavorable social conditions discriminating against the women at the time, perhaps in food consumption. The skeletal remains are of a gracile type; muscular attachments are generally smooth in both sexes. In only a few instances was pathology present (see Photo 10 and Table 1), a circumstance probably due to the young age at death of the present "popula- tion." Indeed, more than a third of the uncovered remains represents individuals under 17 years of age, and there was only one case aged 50 or older. The four relatively complete skulls (Photos 9-12) from this site are of special interest because they differ in their metrical and morphological traits from the human remains found in the same region belong- ing to earlier periods (see Table 2). H. 1 is a complete cranium, but the mandible is missing. The skull belongs to a 35-40 year-old male. The muscular attachments are smooth, with medium developed glabella and mastoid processes, a slightly protruding occiput and sagittal depression in the pa- rietal region near the lambda. The orbits are on an oblique axis and relatively low. The vault is also low in relation to its breadth; the nasal aperture is meso- rhine. The cranial index (79.8) indicates a short and broad skull, near brachycrania. H. 2 belongs to a 35-40 year-old male. The skull is incomplete: base and face are missing. The occiput protrudes slightly, the glabella is of medium size, and the mastoids and superior nuchal crest are large. The mandible has teeth only on the left side; all other teeth were lost ante-mortem. The skull is very short and strongly brachycranic (83.9), with a high vault when compared to its reduced total length. Two perfora- tions in the vault suggest a pathological condition (multiple myeloma?). The H. 3 cranium comprises the vault and the right side of the face of an adult male. The whole palate, as well as part of the occipital bone and the mandible, are missing. The available occipital bone strongly protrudes backward, the glabella is of medium size, and the mastoids and inion are very prominent. The orbits are low and oblique, and the nasal aperture was probably wide. This is the only specimen in the group with a very elongated skull, a hyperdolicho- cranic (67.5). H. 4 is a very small skull belonging to a 20-25 year-old female. The vault is very rounded, strongly brachycranic (84.2) with a steep forehead, a slightly developed glabella, and medium-sized mastoid pro- cesses. The mandible is relatively strong and the gonia are everted. HISTORICAL SKETCH The history of the Jewish population in Israel from the end of the Iron Age to the Persian period ( c . 700-400 BC) was marked by important political events that deeply influenced the social and even biological structure of the people during that time and in the following centuries. The destruction of the kingdoms of Samaria and Judea put an end to the national aspirations of the Jews, while the destruc- tion of the Temple and the devastation in Jerusalem endangered both the spiritual and physical future of the people. These adversities were followed by com- Photo 9. Lateral and frontal views of H. 1. 28</page><page sequence="42">pulsory migration of Jews from Israel to Babylon where a large Jewish population was established. With the rise of the Persian Empire over a large part of the Middle East, the Jewish people received a large measure of autonomy in Babylon as well as for the remaining Jews in Israel proper. The Persian authori- ties also encouraged the diaspora Jews of the time to return to the land of their ancestors and rebuild the Temple.11 One of the major problems confronting the Jews returning to Israel, as well as the Jews who remained in Judea throughout the exile, was that of mixed marriages between Jews and non-Jews. The national importance of this problem is portrayed in the Bible,12 although how extensive or significant such intermarriage was at the time is difficult to say with certainty. The problem may have seemed large because of the religious revival during the period of the return to Zion. In any event, these questions are of importance for the biology of the Jewish people, namely, the probable influence of intermixture in the biological composition of the Jews then and in suc- ceeding generations. Another question concerns the influence of mass migration from and to Israel during relatively long periods of time, and especially its impact on morpho- logical traits. Boas13 and others have demonstrated that migrations may have significant effects on the 11. J. Liver, "Babylonian Exile and Persian Rule," in: J. Rappel (ed.)

Mass movements from and to Israel were very likely subjected to selective processes, e.g., with respect to age and sex of the people taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC or the influence of environmental conditions in Mesopotamia. This selection probably helped to model the morphology of the post-exilic Jews. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The present material from Tell Qiri represents an apparently "civilian population" ranging in age between 1 and 50 years, with the number of very young and old individuals being quite small. The incidence of pathology, probably related to the rela- tively large number of young in the recovered mate- rial, is low. Stature is relatively high for males (with one exception, 163 cm.) and low for females (see Table 1). Risdon gives a mean stature of 164 cm. for the males of Iron Age Lachish, 14 while most of the 206 living male groups of the Middle East reported by Field were under 170 cm.15 Table 3 indicates the morphometric characteristics of the so-called Mediterranean human groups, represented here by the Lachish sample and modern 14.

Lateral and superior views of H. 4. 30</page><page sequence="44">Bedouins, which in turn may be compared with the recovered Tell Qiri finds (Table 2). The principal traits of the skull are a generally elongated dolicho- cranic vault, medium height, medium to narrow face, relatively broad nasal aperture and low orbits. The earlier Iron Age remains from Sialk, on the other hand, differ from this Mediterranean pattern by a much broader vault (brachy or hyperbrachycrania), although the facial characteristics appear similar to those of the Mediterranean. Yet, some skulls from Iron Age Sialk are not brachymorphic, but present a low cranial index (73.9 and 75.7 in two male skulls and 73.3 in one female). When these narrow skulls are included in the means of Sialk, the cranial index shifts in males from 84.2 to 82.6 and in females from 87. 1 to 85.3. Brachycephaly also appears among the Jewish population, especially during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, but it is not the prevailing type and occurs even less frequently in earlier periods. In the Jewish crania, brachycephaly appears mainly as a result of shortening of the cranium, while breadth remains more stable, never reaching the extreme values observed in the Sialk remains. Their facial traits also differ from those of the typical Mediterra- neans or from those of Sialk, especially in the rela- tively narrow nasal opening and the higher orbits. The human remains from the Persian period of Kish (Table 3) seem to belong to a generally dolicho- cranic variant of the Mediterranean group, with only one brachycranic exception. If this small sample from Kish is indeed representative of the population living in Mesopotamia during the Persian period, it becomes clear that the biological influence of the Iranian people sharing such physical traits as those found at Sialk (e.g., hyperbrachycrany) was insignifi- cant at Kish. In this latter site, the population during the sixth to fourth centuries BC appears fundamen- tally Mediterranean, while in Iran, from the Iron Age to the present, brachycephaly was and is predominant. At Tell Qiri two skulls present a strong brachy- crany, one is mesocranic, and one is hyperdolicho- cranic. The extreme limits of brachy and dolichocrany that characterize these finds are rarely found among Mediterranean remains, past or pres- ent. Among the Jews, from the pre-exilic to the Roman periods, extreme cranial indices occur but are not the norm. In sharp contrast, the wide range of variation in the cranial index observed at Tell Qiri is commonly found at Iranian sites; for example, at Iron Age Sialk, hyperbrachycephaly is dominant whereas hyperdolichocephaly occurs at earlier peri- ods in this area. The presence of extreme variants in cranial index at Tell Qiri is perhaps explicable by (a) intrusion in Israel of foreign northern elements, a process that is documented in historical sources and in the Bible, or by (b) adaptation of the local population (or some part of it) to a new environment, including climatic, social, political and demographic changes. The latter possibility seems unlikely, especially since the people living in Israel before and after the Persian period do not present such extreme morphological features as those seen at Tell Qiri, and also because the Persian period was in fact characterized by relative social and political stability. The factor of migration in the interpretation of the Tell Qiri finds is difficult to assess. No reliable data from historical-biblical sources are available on the number of migrants, their geographical origins or ethnic affiliations. With many, but not all, of the Jewish people returning from the Babylonian exile, there were also Persian armies that came to the coun- try on their way to Egypt, taking with them not only their own families but also mercenaries recruited from the whole Middle East. These mercenaries, with the exception of the Persians proper, generally belonged to the same Mediterranean stock as the local inhabitants of Israel at the time and, as noted by Cappieri for earlier periods, they could hardly be differentiated from Canaanites, Jews or any other people in the region.16 A relationship between the Tell Qiri remains and ancient Jewish skeletal material seems extremely doubtful. Crania of the ancient Jews manifest a slow shift in morphology through time. The cranial index there is a good example of a generally low index among Jews of the Iron Age, especially in the peri- pherial regions (e.g., Jericho 72.5, and the northern Negev 75.2). It increased later in the Jerusalem area (76.5), becoming relatively high during the Hellenis- tic period (78.2) and subsequent Roman (79.3) and Byzantine periods (81.0) (see Table 3).17 Mention must be made of possible morphological changes due to migration: typical dolichocephalic 16.

Stature was calculated on the basis of Trotter and Gleser, in T.D. Stewart (ed.), Personal Identification in Mass Disasters (Washington, D.C. 1970), pp. 71-83. Mediterranean Jews deported to Babylon later returned to Israel after intermixture with other non- Mediterranean peoples and acquired a relatively broad cranial shape (brachycrania), as suggested by Stekholl.18 Boas,19 Shapiro20 and others have shown that migration and not only intermixture may cause morphological changes in a population. It is not improbable that this migratory factor also influenced morphological aspects of the Jewish post-exilic pop- ulation of Israel. Such migratory effects, however, are limited, and tend to be in the direction of features prevalent prior to migration. Thus Kobyliansky21 found that in the first generation the cephalic index of living Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe shifted from 83.6 in the parental generation to 77.7 in their sons born and raised in Israel. According to this model, the strong brachy and hyperdolichocrany of the Tell Qiri remains cannot be due to a migrational effect among Jews whose cranial index range was much narrower, and, if the Tell Qiri crania represent a second generation, they do not manifest a tendency to return to the features characteristic of the local Jewish Mediterranean people. 18.

Yet the overall biological impact, as already noted, was probably small, since the intermixture was among peoples belonging to essentially the same Mediterranean biological stock, in this case Jews and Mesopotamians. The main impact of intermixture during the Babylonian exile was primarily cultural, and the fury of biblical Ezra and Nehemiah was directed against the offenses to the moral national values which intermixture with pagan peoples endan- gered. Opposition to mixed marriages probably increased during this period as a reaction against the social customs of the Assyrians and Persians and the later Hellenistic "illuminism," while the biological effects of this process, if present, were largely ignored. The metric features of the Tell Qiri remains strongly suggest that they represent a non- Mediterranean group foreign to the region and prob- ably of northern, Persian origin. Table 2.

Barag The Hebrew University, Jerusalem The glass recovered from Area Al prior to the exca- vations includes twenty-two fragments of vessels, an amorphous chunk and a fragmentary spherical glass bead. Twenty-one fragments are of bowls, or rather drinking vessels, and only one is a blown fragment of a receptacle, indicating that this material must have come from occupational deposits and not from graves. The majority of the fragments belong to "sagged"1 vessels and only four (e.g.. Nos. 12-14) to blown vessels. Although nothing is known of the exact circum- stances of its discovery, it seems that this very small group of glass fragments forms a relatively homo- geneous group dating from the late first century BC-early first century AD. It seems likely that it is contemporaneous with some examples of Early Roman pottery from the same square, which also includes a nozzle of a knife-pared "Herodian" lamp (Fig. 1:39). As a group, this glass resembles some of the finds from Knossos,2 the House of Livia on the Palatine, Rome (late first century BC)3 and Morgantina, Sicily (Augustan-early Julio-Claudian).4 The unfortu- nately small and modest group of fragments from Qiri appears to be the first Syro-Palestinian example of this kind and date.

Outside, their surface is fire-polished. Rotary polishing marks are evident inside and outside to about 0.7 cm. below rim. Exam- ples from the late first century BC come from Mor- gantina, Sicily5 and the House of Livia on the Palatine.6 Some parallels were also recovered at Knossos in late first century BC to mid-first century AD fills.7 5.

Fig. 6:8. Light bluish-green. Pin-prick bubbles. Inside, a wheel-cut groove. Rotary polishing marks inside and on rim. Vertical grinding marks below groove. Rim carefully ground. Nos. 5-8 belong to ribbed bowls with a slightly con- cave base and linear wheel-cut grooves. They are fire-polished outside and rotary polished inside and on the rim, as in Nos. 1-4. This type is well- represented on other Palestinian sites such as Tel Anafa,8 Hagoshrim,9 and Ashdod.10 Nos. 5-8 are, however, contemporary with Nos. 1-4 and are similar to late first century BC examples from Morgantina11 and Knossos.12 9.

Similar to No. 10 but with a wheel- cut groove also on the outside. Nos. 9-11 are examples of relatively thin-walled shallow bowls with a flat or slightly concave base and linear wheel-cut grooves. These bowls, too, were fire-polished on the outside and rotary pol- ished inside and on the rim outside, as in Nos. 1-8. Examples from the late first century BC were uncov- ered at Samaria13 and a fragment from the Hero- dian palaces at Jericho is probably of a similar date. 14 This plain type, usually produced in light bluish- green glass, seems to be a characteristic Syro- Palestinian type of the late first century BC-early first century AD. BLOWN GLASS 12. Fig. 6:12. Light bluish-green with large light purple patch. Pin-prick bubbles. Outside, above ribs, a wheel-incised line. No. 12 is an example of a "Zarterippenschale" with- out the opaque white thread decoration. This type is usually attributed to the second and third quarters of the first century AD and their manufacture ascribed to glass-houses in northern Italy.15 Grose published two examples from Morgantina which he ascribed to the first half of the first century AD and suggested that the type may have commenced late in the preced- ing century.16 Its presence in the Qiri group supports a date in the late first century BC-early first century AD for the first occurrence of this class. This frag- ment, as well as some complete examples in various collections in Israel, seem to indicate that such bowls were also manufactured in the Syro-Palestinian area.17 13. Fig. 6:13. Translucent blue with white "veins." Inside, a thin white layer 0.5-1.0 mm. thick. Iridescence and pitting on the outside. No. 13, a fragment from the base and sides of a bowl or cup, is the only example of a luxury glass from the site. The glassblower first inflated a mixture of blue glass with white "veins." Subsequently, while the paraison was attached to and manipulated by the pontil-rod, it was inflated with monochrome white glass which formed an inner layer 0.5-1.0 mm. thick. It is thus a combination of the typical early Roman colored fabrics with white "veins" (usually blue, pur- ple or brown mixed with white "veins") and a further inner layer (Überfangglas).18 14.

Amorphous chunk of translucent, bluish-green glass (3 X 2.7 cm.) 16. Half of a translucent light blue spherical bead (0.8 cm. in diameter). There are, in addition, a bluish-green rim fragment similar to Nos. 6-8, two dark brown splinters (0.5 cm. thick), and one light brown and two bluish-green small body fragments of "sagged" bowls. One ribbed, light bluish-green fragment (46/3) may belong to a "pillar moulded" bowl19 and a small fragment comes from the bottom of a light bluish- green blown bottle. DISCUSSION The Qiri group differs markedly from the Late Hellenistic glass found, among others, at Ashdod20 and Tel Anafa.21 It is characterized, for example, by the absence of conical bowls with linear wheel-cut grooves. The hemispheric bowls (Nos. 1-4), the ribbed bowls (Nos. 5-8), and the shallow bowls (Nos. 9-11) have their roots in types which were in use between the mid-second and mid-first centuries BC but differ from them in various details. The ribbed bowls (Nos. 5-8) have parallels at Hagoshrim22 but the latter group seems on the whole to be earlier than the Qiri group. Our group belongs to a period in which cast or rather "sagged" bowls are still predominant but blown glass is already in use. The datable parallels, primarily from Italy and Sicily, indicate that the glass from Qiri dates from the Augustan period or perhaps the last quarter of the first century BC and the first quarter of the first century AD. It differs from its contemporary western parallels in the predominance of bluish-green and colorless glass. The brightly colored glass, so characteristic of western sites, was not in vogue in the east Mediterranean area. Mosaic glass and other luxury glass are not represented on the site except for the example of the "veined" Überfangglas. One may assume that almost all the Qiri glass was manufactured in Syro-Palestinian glass-houses, perhaps those on the Phoenician coast. Whether the "veined" Überfangglas (No. 13) is also of Syro-Palestinian origin is unknown. The small chunk of unworked glass is certainly not enough to claim local production on the site, and one may wonder whether it was brought from somewhere else as a souvenir, curiosity, or the like. Although this group is very small and is composed of utilitarian glass, it illustrates the types of glassware that were in use in an area only some 30 km. from the estuary of the river Belus and Ptolemais-Akko in the Augustan period. 19.

Portugali, Tel Aviv University As was noted in the Introduction, the settlement at Tell Qiri existed continuously throughout the whole of the Iron Age. The archaeological remains from that period consequently predominate in most exca- vation areas and at the site as a whole. Area D, the largest excavation area, contained no less than twelve stratigraphie phases, constituting five major strata of the Iron Age alone (Plan 8). The earliest Iron Age stratum in Area D (and at Tell Qiri as a whole) is Stratum IX, and the latest in Area D is Stratum V/VI. Strata IV and V, the latest Iron Age strata at Tell Qiri, do not appear in Area D as they were totally destroyed by bulldozers during recent construction works. The completion of the Iron Age stratigraphie sequence is found in Area C which is adjacent to Area D from the south. Strata V/VI through IX in Area C have been excavated in only small sections (about 75 sq. m.) while the remains of Stratum V in this area occupy over 300 sq. m. As in Area D, the upper part of Area C was destroyed by recent construction works, and consequently only a few remains from the latest Iron Age Strata IV/V were found there. Area A2 also contained important remains from the Iron Age, but only of the earliest strata. Iron Age remains were also excavated in Areas B, F and G, but only in small sections. The description and stratigraphie analysis of the Iron Age remains at Tell Qiri are presented here in the order of their state of preservation: Area D, Area C, Area A2, and the remainder in alphabetical order: Area B, Area F and Area G. (Areas Al, E and H are not included since they lacked Iron Age strata.) We begin with a discussion of the stratigraphy, describing each stratum separately, in the above- mentioned order. The stratigraphie analysis is fol- lowed by general chapters on varied aspects of the Iron Age settlement. AREA D The key to understanding the Iron Age stratigraphy in Area D is the fact that in no case was an entire new stratum built on top of a previous one. Most walls were in use during more than one stratigraphie phase and in more than one building. This can be seen clearly in the general plans provided below (Plans 8-14), and in particular in the sections (Plans 13-14). Consequently, the few small walls which were in use in one stratigraphie phase only are stratigraphically the most significant ones. This situation reflects the history and nature of the site - a small agricultural settlement composed of residential buildings, installations for agricultural industries and public buildings, whose plans are often identical with ordinary houses. Consequently, we did not find in Area D typical strata, but rather "strati- graphic phases" or "levels." Each such level was defined in relation to the preceding one and the one above it, and thus the entire stratigraphie system must be comprehended as one complete system. Within this continuous system we were able to define five major stratigraphie phases which we have termed strata. These strata were numbered in Roman numer- als from V to IX, whereas the various "stratigraphie phases" or "levels" are designated by letters. Phase VIII C thus indicates level C in Stratum VIII (Plan 8). Five general plans are provided below as an aid for the stratigraphie analysis of each separate stratum: 53</page><page sequence="65">Plan 8.

Plans 9, 10, 11 and 12 are superposition plans, illustrating the complex interrelationships between the twelve stratigraphie phases, and Plans 13 and 14 present the major sections of Area D. Follow- ing this general information, analysis proceeds in the order of strata, each stratum with its relevant plans and diagrams. STRATUM V/VI Unlike all the other strata described below, Stratum V/VI is not a genuine archaeological stratum, but comprises the first three stratigraphie phases exca- vated in Area D. These phases were badly damaged by recent construction in the area, to the extent that meaningful stratigraphie analysis and comparison were not possible. Consequently, the terms V/VIA V/VIB, etc. do not indicate continuation or stratigra- phie connection, as in other strata, but refer to strati- graphic phases found between Strata V and VII. Phase V/VIA (Plans 15-16) This is the first phase of Area D (see Plan 15). As most of the area was damaged by recent construction, only fragmentary remains were found in this phase. Judg- ing from the fact that four of the five walls excavated from this phase were new and not related to earlier phases (W. 201, W. 253, W. 148, W. 136 in Plan 15), it could be assumed that this was a new phase that reorganized the whole area. The few surviving remains in the area enabled us to suggest the follow- ing reconstruction (Plan 16): v z' Plan 16. Reconstruction of Strata V/VIA Phase V/VIB (Plans 17-18) Two stratigraphie levels form Phase V/VIB (Plan 17). One consists of the walls in the area and the second of several pits which were dug into the walls and their floors in a later phase, probably after the various buildings had gone out of use. A modern building had completely destroyed half of the remains of this phase, especially towards the north- eastern side of the area. Remains of several structures were excavated in the southwestern side of the area. They include W. 205, W. 202, W. 203, W. 84, W. 84a, W. 84b (Square E/15), and W. 219, while W. 206 in Square G/16, which was originally built in Phase V/VIC, con- tinued in use in the present phase. Of special impor- tance is W. 135 in Square G-H/14, which was originally built in Phase V/VIC, and is crucial for understanding the connection between Areas C and D. From the meagre surviving remains the following reconstruction is proposed (Plan 18): IS* Plan 18. Reconstruction of Strata V/VIB Phase V/VIC (Plans 19-20) This phase, whose details are presented in Plan 19, is totally different in plan from Phase V/VIB and also from the earlier Phase VIIA: All the agricultural installations found in Phase VIIA (see below) were discontinued and, at the same time, the function of this part in the settlement probably changed. The scope of the changes can be appreciated by compar- ing the relevant plans of Phases VIIA (Plans 21, 24) and V/VIB (Plans 17, 18). What must be emphasized, however, is that the southern part of the area was badly damaged by a large pit which was dug in a later period and destroyed most of the architectural and 62</page><page sequence="74">Plan 17.

On the basis of the above changes the following reconstruction can be suggested for the whole area (Plan 20): Plan 20. Reconstruction of Strata V/VIC. The Pottery Stratum V/VI (Fig. 8, Photos 16-17). In presenting the ceramic forms typical of the various strata, we have included only important, i.e., chronologically significant, types and material coming from key loci. For a full discussion as well as a comparative study, see below, pp. 139-223. Photo 16. Ridged pilgrim-flask from Iron III. Photo 17. Assyrianizing bottle. Since the upper levels of Area D were severely damaged by bulldozers, much of the late Iron Age material is difficult to place stratigraphically. The pottery in Fig. 8 has been attributed typologically to the range of Strata V-VI. The Assyrianizing bottle (Fig. 8:9, Photo 17) was found close to the surface, where it was most probably deposited as a result of the construction of the present-day road in the imme- diate vicinity. Stratum VI (Fig. 9, Photo 18). Locus 529 is a key locus for this stratum. Of special interest is the "flower" (Fig. 9:10, Photo 18:1) which was first encountered at Qiri and subsequently discovered also at Yoqne'am and Tell Keisan.1 These vessels are clearly foreign to the Jezreel Valley and were most probably imported from the coastal region.2 The appearance of the "hole-mouth" storage jar (Fig. 9:6) and the continuation of the cooking jar (Fig. 9:5) are also noteworthy. 1.

Goldberg of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University revealed a high sand content in the clay. The same is true for other "Phoenician" objects, e.g., Fig. 44:2-3.

The whole area now became a single complex for an agricultural industry, probably olive oil production. The oil press can be seen in Photos 19-21; a detailed description and reconstruction of the oil press and the oil production process are given below on pp. 134-136. As can be seen in the detailed Plan 21 , in this phase floor levels in the entire area were raised to about 70.40 m., a new room (L. 652 in Square E/16) was added to the northern building, and several pits of various sizes were built to the west and south of the area. The western pits (L. 1055 and 1056 in Square E/15) are relatively small and shallow, while the two pits which were built in the south (L. 1042 in Square G/16 and L. 1062 in Square G/17) are much deeper and larger. The pit of L. 1042 is unusual in that it was built wholly of stones (and plastered?) and had a cover at the top (Photos 22, 23, Plan 22 and sections there). Both pits (L. 1042 and L. 1062) were probably used for storage and belong to the same phase. Wall W. 241 functioned as a retaining wall, and was built because of the differences in the elevations between L. 1034 (70.45 m.), which contained pit 1042, and the area south of W. 231 (Square G/17), which contained pit 1062. This can best be seen in the isometric plan of the whole area (Plan 23). 67</page><page sequence="79">Photo 19. Area D, looking north at the oil press of Stratum VIIA.

These changes, which can be seen in Plan 25, include a new building at the northern end of the area, above the street that existed here in earlier periods. Wall W. 211 of Phase VIIC became the northern wall of the new building (Square D/17), while all the other walls are new (W. 225, W. 212, W. 235, W. 234, W. 229, W. 228 in Squares D/16, 17). As this new building blocked the earlier street, a new diagonal passage was now created between the building of Phase VIIB and the one built in Phase VIIC. The floor levels of these two buildings are between 70.00 to 70.10 m., whereas the street itself slopes from 70.00 m. at the northeast corner to about 70.30 m. in the central area (where it was built above W. 117 of Phase VIIC). The function of this new building is not clear. Its plan and the various installations found in it suggest that it may have been associated with the many agricultural-industrial installations found through- out the area (see above discussion of Phase VIIA).

An entrance from the main street, which led directly into an open courtyard (L. 658 in Square E/17), was situated in the western part of the new building. In the western corner of the courtyard, which opened onto a long, narrow room (L. 653b), were a stone-built installation and an oven. The east- ern and western parts of the building were built together as a single unit, and judging from the de- struction level of Phase VIIIA, the entire area was levelled in preparation for this new building. In the construction of this building the structures in the western half of the area were not completely destroyed. Several walls, W. 153, W. 122, W. 98, W. 117, and W. 137 (Square E-F/17), were added hereto connect some of the walls of the previous phase with the new building. The above changes in the area were also associated with modifications in the street network (described above in the discussion of Phase VIIB). The Pottery Stratum VII ( Figs. 10-14, Photos 24-28).

Several other changes were made on the north-south street and in the northwest- ern corner of the area. These changes in the street network were required for, or were the result of, changes in the plan of the building located in the center of the area. This new central building was composed of three spaces and a main entrance from the north. The building was entered through L. 675 (Square E/16) Photo 29. Area D, looking north at pits in a courtyard of Stratum VIIIA. The pit south of W. 232 is the lower part of L. 1062 of Stratum VIIA. 80</page><page sequence="92">Plan 27. Detailed plan of Stratum VIII A (Scale 1:100). 81</page><page sequence="93">which was probably a courtyard, which led into a second space (L. 670 and L. 677 in Square F/16) and a third space. The function of this building is not certain, and it is difficult to determine whether it had a cultic function, as in Phases VIIIB and VIIIC, or whether it was an ordinary residential building. A new building was also constructed on the eastern side of the area. Most of the walls in this building are new (W. 114, W. 112, W. 113, W. 124). Three of its western rooms can be seen in the plan(L. 662, L. 663, L. 666). Locus 666 (in Square F/17) gives the impres- sion of an agricultural installation, which may pro- vide us with a clue as to the function of this building (see east side of Photos 19 and 29). All these changes were accompanied by an eleva- tion of the area to 69.60-69.80 m. As is indicated in Plan 27, two phases could be distinguished in several spots. As these were essentially constructional phases, they do not alter the overall plan of this phase. All the above changes suggest the following recon- struction of the area, its buildings and street network (Plan 28): ''Av Plan 28. Reconstruction of Stratum VIIIA. With the exception of the northern (east-west) street, the main street network remained unchanged from Phase VIIIB. Phase VIIIB (Plans 29-30, Photos 30-31) Several modifications in the architecture and organi- zation of the area mark this phase and can be seen in Plan 29. First, several changes were made in the central building. The entrance in W. 125 (Square E-F/16-17) was blocked and a two-space building was thus created (in place of the previous three-space building), with L. 1117 as the front room and L. 675b as the back room. Secondly, a new structure was erected south of the above building, with an entrance from the south. It occupied the third space of the building of Phase VIIIA. In order to construct this building, the entrance in W. 125 was blocked, an entrance was opened in W. 138 (Square F/16), and a new front was added south of W. 138 ( W. 256, W. 268 and W. 264 in Squares F/15-16). These changes created a two-space structure with an entrance from the south into a front room (L. 690) and a back room in L. 677. An "upright stone" (massebah) and a stone basin (Photos 30-31) were uncovered in the front room (L. 690 in Square F/16), and a collection of cultic ceramic artifacts in the back room (L. 1044). These installations and the ceramic assemblage may indi- cate that this building, like its predecessor in Phase VIIIC, was employed for cultic functions of some sort (see below, pp. 86-90 - "The Cultic Building"). Apart from the elevation of the floors, only minor changes were made in the other buildings in the area of Phase VIIIC. These are shown in Plan 29. On the basis of both these minor and major changes, the following reconstruction of the area is suggested (Plan 30): / ^ J/J / Plan 30. Reconstruction of Stratum VIIIB. 82</page><page sequence="94">Plan 29. Detailed plan of Stratum VIIIB (Scale 1:100). 83</page><page sequence="95">Photo 30. Area D, looking south at the entrance of L. 690 (Stratum VIIIB) blocked by W. 261 of Stratum VIIIA. As is evident from the reconstructed plan, four build- ings stood here. The two central buildings survived in an almost complete state. The network of streets was almost identical with the preceding one from Phase VIIIC, and there were only minor changes in the northwestern corner of the area. Several pits which were dug into this phase also mark its end. These pits served either for dismantling the walls or were dug during the reorganization of the whole area (see above). Phase VIIIC (Plans 31-34, Photo 32) This phase, which begins Stratum VIII, represents a major change in the organization and probably also the function of this part of the settlement. As can be seen in Plan 31, at the center of the area an ordinary residential building was excavated, in the back room of which we found a collection of cultic artifacts (see below). Apart from W. 138, which continued from Phase IX A, all the other walls were built in the pres- ent phase, and thus are stratigraphically superim- posed on the previous phase's structures. In addition to the building in the center of the area, several other new buildings can be observed to its north, east, south and west (Plan 31). 84 Photo 31. Area D, looking southwest at details, objects and installations in L. 690 of Stratum VIIIB. The above architectural and functional changes were associated with a reorganization of the street network in this part of the settlement. As can be seen in the diagrammatic plan below (Plan 32), a new street with a westward extension was added on the northwestern side of the area. The direction of the entrances in the eastern structure suggests that there was an entrance from the north, another from the east, and a number of streets as reconstructed below (Plan 32): Plan 32. Reconstruction of Stratum VIIIC.</page><page sequence="96">Plan 31. Detailed plan of Stratum VIIIC (Scale 1:100). 85</page><page sequence="97">Photo 32. Area D, looking north at remains of Strata VII- VIII. As was noted above, the main architectural feature in this phase is the residential building in the center of the area, which contained an assemblage of cultic artifacts in its back room. The building comprised three spaces: The entrance (L. 1 152, L. 674), or open courtyard, led from the street into the building. The second and central space (L. 685a + L. 675 in Squares E/ 16-1 7), which was probably roofed, had a built-in bench along its western and southern walls. This central space led into a third space at the back of the building (Square F/16), which was subdivided by W. 229 into two rooms, a front room (L. 1074) and a small back room (L. 1065, Photo 32). It was in L. 1065 that the cultic artifacts were found. Plans 33 and 34 present an isometric plan and reconstruction of this building and its relationship with the adjoining street network. The Cultic Building (Photos 33-35) The building occupying Squares E-F/16-17 in Stra- tum VIII does not differ in plan or manner of con- struction from the other buildings of the stratum, and the first hint that this building was connected with a special function arose when finds of a clearly cultic nature, such as the incense burner and libation vessel (Figs. 15:8, 17:8, Photos 33:1, 2; 34), were encoun- tered. The building was in use throughout the three archi- tectural sub-phases of Stratum VIII (Plans 31, 29, 27): In the earliest phase (VIIIC) it was entered from the street in the north (L. 1152). From a front room (L. 685a -i- L. 675) and past the western wall, along which ran a narrow bench, one entered a second room (L. 1074) and then a small back room (L. 1065). The last room also includes L. 692 and, to some extent, also L. 1146, which may belong to Phase VIIIC or IXA. The incense burner was found here. The faience amulet in the form of the god Ptah- Sokar3(Fig. 57:1 1, Photo 65) was found in L. 1157 of Phase IX B, but may have belonged originally to this phase (VIIIC) and may have been displaced by a disturbance in the floor of L. 1 146. 3. I wish to thank Mr. Brandl of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University for his help and valuable remarks; and see MegiddoII , PI. 206:48, 50, 52-55 (of Strata VB-VA there); amulets of this deity, usually made of faience, are common in Palestinian sites throughout the Late Bronze-Iron Age. 86</page><page sequence="98">87 Plan 33.

Iron I cultic vessels: (1) incense burner; (2) double libation vessel. 88</page><page sequence="100">A radical change in the plan of the building occurs in the following phase, VIIIB: The building now comprised two "broad-rooms" and was entered from the south (L. 690). In the western part of this space was found a stone basin made of stone slabs enclosed by a thin partition wall (Photo 31). A libation vessel was found in the back room, L. 1044 (which also includes L. 677, 1064, 1074). It should be noted that in the previous pháse (VIIIC) the rear space of the building was located here, since now (VIIIB) the doorway which originally connected this space with the one to the north (= L. 685a of Phase VIIIC and L. 675b of Phase VIIIB) is blocked. In the next phase, VIIIA, the building was altered once more. It was again entered from the north (L. 675/681) into the front room(L. 670), and from there one reached what was the entrance room in Phase VIIIB (L. 690). The stone basin and partition wall continued to be in use (see Plan 27). The floors of all three sub-phases of Stratum VIII in this area are very close to one other, a fact which, together with the large number of disturbances here, makes the exact assignment of finds to the different sub-phases of Stratum VIII extremely difficult. The cultic use of the building, which will be discussed below, seems to be clearly attested for the two earlier phases, and only with some hesitation with regard to the third and latest phases of Stratum VIII. Another discovery of great significance as regards the function of the building are the bones (Photo 35). In five loci (L. 1044, L. 1064, L. 1065, L. 1074, L. 1 146) a large quantity of bones was unearthed, which show "a clearly biased limb representation. ..all are of sheep and goat.. .an obvious preference for right fore- limbs can be seen."4 This phenomenon contrasts sharply with the type and quantity of bones discovered in other loci at Tell Qiri. Apparently these are none other than remains of sacrifices of the kind described in Exod. 29:22 and Lev. 7:32, where the portion of the "right leg" is repeatedly mentioned. Archaeological evidence for this type of sacrifice was found also in the Late Photo 35. Bones (evidence of sacrifice) from Cultic Building. Bronze temple at Lachish, where it was noted that "the bulk of the bones brought back for examination were from the right foreleg of young animals, mostly sheep or goats" and that "the animals are all very young"5 - exactly as at Tell Qiri. A similar phenomenon, from a somewhat later date, has been noted in the Archaic Precinct of the sanctuary of Apollo Hylates at Kourion, dated to the eighth-sixth centuries BC.6 Scholars have long ago noted the widespread nature of the practice of sacri- fice throughout the ancient Near East and have pointed out the "Canaanite" origin of this Israelite type of sacrifice.7 It should be stressed that we do not claim that the inhabitants of Tell Qiri at that time were Israelites. Indeed, on the basis of the material recovered so far, there is no way of establishing whether the occupants of the site then were Israelites or - what seems more probable (based on historical considerations) - non- Israelites. The combination of cultic vessels and animal bones which are evidently the remains of sacrifices leads us to conclude that, despite the domestic nature of the building in which they were found, it may have had a cultic function. A collection of cultic vessels discovered in a similar context at neighboring Megiddo came from an ordinary house of the tenth century BC, and a similar find has also been notéd at Taanach.8 Another group of cultic vessels, including 4.

Iron I decorated crater. chalices and incense burners dating to the eleventh century BC, was found at Megiddo in a context which is clearly domestic. The story of Micah from Mount Ephraim, who kept a graven image and a molten image "in the house" (Judg. 17:4), is connected with a period and region very close to ours and may provide a literary counterpart of these archaeological discov- eries: " And the man Micah had a house of God , and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons , who became his priest " (Judg. 17:5). Another group of cultic objects came from Area A2, from a large building attributed, on the basis of its pottery, to Strata VIII-IX (see below, p. 123). The building could not be entirely excavated, since a modern kibbutz house stands over a large part of its area. Our attention was drawn to this area as a result of a trench dug by a tractor during building activities. This trench caused considerable damage to the build- ing and to the remains above it, which greatly compli- cated the determination of its stratigraphy and limited our knowledge of the building and its imme- diate surroundings. However, even the little we could learn indicates that this was an important building of a clearly non-domestic nature, which was different from all the other buildings encountered at Tell Qiri. The bones found in the building were unfortu- nately lost before they could be studied, and in light of the results of the examination of the other bones found here, what would certainly have been a very interesting analysis could not be carried out. A thin ash layer was encountered over almost the entire floor of the building, but we could learn nothing definite about it. The group of cultic vessels found in this building is perhaps an indication of its function. These vessels include three chalices, one with red- painted decoration, a cup and saucer, and two frag- ments of small votive bowls (Plans 52-53, Photos 33:3-5; 57-58; Figs. 28:9, 29:2-4). The exceptionally large number of complete and fragmentary chalices found at Tell Qiri is of great interest. Nearly seventy were uncovered, and since some chalice rims very likely may have been errone- ously identified as bowls, it is safe to estimate their number to have been even higher. Quantitative data from other sites, with the exception of neighboring Yoqne'am, are unavailable, so meaningful compari- sons are difficult to make. At Qiri, however, chalices constitute close to 1% (!) of the entire ceramic assemblage - a very high percentage indeed - while at Yoqne'am the frequency of this type is much lower.9 With all due caution, we may perhaps conclude that some special sanctity may have been attached to Tell Qiri in the Iron Age or that some important cultic center was located there. It may have been somehow related, as Mazar has already suggested,10 with the sanctity in ancient times of Mount Carmel, on the lower slopes of which Tell Qiri is located. The Pottery Stratum VIII (+ VIII/IX) (Figs. 15-18, 19, Photos 34-43). The key loci of this period are L. 690, L. 1044 (including L. 677, L. 1064, L. 1074) and L. 1065 (including L. 692). L. 1 146 is included here for typo- logical reasons. Several loci are questionable; their sure, with ambiguous and common secular material"; P.

The cultic nature of the building has recently been rejected by M.D. Fowler, "Concerning the 'Cultic' Structure at Taan- ach," ZDPV 100 (1984), pp. 30-34. It should be noted, however, that while one may question the nature of the pig bones found in the Taanach cultic building (Fowler, loc. cit.), the bones in the Qiri building are unquestionably evidence of sacrifices. 9. We are aware of the possibility that the large number of chalices at Tell Qiri may be the result of the specific areas chosen for excavation. It should be kept in mind, however, that a large proportion of this type was noted in all the areas excavated. 10. B. Mazar, "Carmel - A Holy Mountain in Ancient Times," in A.

The main changes are the new walls W. 248 (Square E/ 16) superimposed on W. 248a-b, and W. 128 on W. 250, and an elevation of the floors to 68.60 m. In this new phase the new floor (L. 1151 in Square F/15) at an elevation of 68.75 m. connects the newly built wall W. 266 with W. 281 and W. 263, which were first erected in Phase IXB. Note that W. 266 was built on the floor at an elevation of 68.60 m. (L. 1155 in Plan 37), which in Phase IXB connected W. 263 and W. 281 .

Detailed plan of Stratum IXB (Scale 1:100). 100</page><page sequence="112">Phase IXB (Plans 37-38) This stratum, as presented in Plan 37, is composed of two walls, W. 259 (Square E/17) and W. 237 (Square E-F/17) to the south, which were originally built in Phase IXC and were re-used in this later phase. All the other walls are new. The dominant structure in this phase is a large building, approximately 7.5 x 11 m., in the center of the area. As reconstructed in Plan 38, an entrance at the south of the building leads to an open courtyard (L. 1085, L. 1084 and L. 1083 in Square F/16; Plan 37) which was partly paved and contained a tabun (oven) in its southeastern corner. The open courtyard led into two roofed rooms in the northern end of the building. Stratigraphically, we can distinguish three phases here: (1) Walls W. 277, W. 273, W. 251, W. 250 (Squares D/16-17), whose bases are c. 67.70 m. and floors c. 68.00 m.; (2) several new walls with floors at approxi- mately 68.20 m.; (3) additional walls W. 249, W. 248 (Square E/16), with floors at an elevation of 68.40 m., when W. 259 ceased to be used. It appears that the first two phases are construc- tional phases of the building described above. Phase 3, on the other hand, represents a development within the building, in which two new roofed rooms were added in the area previously designed as a courtyard. This extension is presented in Plan 38 (at right): Plan 38. Reconstruction of the central building in Stratum IXB. At left, Phase A; at right, plan following the addition of two rooms. Phase IXC (Plan 39) This is the earliest Iron Age settlement; it was built directly on top of the Middle Bronze stratum in this area. This phase was exposed only partly, and in only a few spots. In most cases only the tops of the walls were exposed. Judging from W. 259 and W. 237 (Squares E-F/17), the bases of the walls are at an elevation of 67.50-67.40 m., and according to L. 1080 Photo 45. Iron I "Canaanite jar." (Square E/17) and L. 1 120 (Square F/16), the floors of this phase are approximately 67.60 m. Due to the fragmentary state of this phase no fuller reconstruc- tion is possible beyond the one made in Plan 39. The Pottery Stratum IX (Fig. 20, Photos 45-46). Locus 684 is typical of the earliest Iron Age stratum at the site. Important forms uncovered in this locus include oval-rimmed craters (Fig. 20:2-3), overlapping cook- ing pots (Fig. 20:4), the "Canaanite" jar - a clear carry-over from the Late Bronze Age (Fig. 20:5, Photo 45), and the juglets with pinched lips and pointed bases (Fig. 20:6-7, Photo 46). The absence of Philistine ware should be noted. Photo 46. Iron I juglet. 101</page><page sequence="113">Plan 39. Detailed plan of Stratum IXC (Scale 1:100). Plan 40. Section A-A in Area C.

As was noted, it was excavated to its full extent only in the two phases of Stratum V. Remnants of other strata are quite limited. Two general plans are provided here - Plan 40 which illustrates this discus- sion, and Plan 49 which presents the stratigraphie connection between Areas D and C. Both Plan 40 and Plan 49 present the two major sections of Area C. No superposition plans were needed in the case of Area C, as every sequential plan is also a superposition plan for all its later strata. Plan 48 of Strata IX and X is also a general superposition plan of all the strata in the area. Stratum IV/V (Plan 41, Photo 47) Due to recent construction works only a few frag- mentary walls have survived of this stratum. These 103</page><page sequence="115">Plan 41. Detailed plan of Strata III and IV/V (Scale 1:125). 104</page><page sequence="116">include W. 57, W. 132, W. 133 and W. 144 which, together with L. 587, form part of a building with a floor level of 74.40 m. (Photo 47). As can be seen in Plan 41, the walls in this stratum were oriented in a completely different direction from those of Stratum V and thus attest that there was no continuation and that a complete separation existed between the two strata (see also W. 57 in Plan 42 below). The Pottery Stratum IV/ V( Fig. 21, Photo 48). Only one locus, L. 587, belongs to this extremely disturbed area. In this locus was found a corner of a building superimposed on the large public building of Stratum V. Since it is built above the Stratum V building and orientated in a completely different direction from it, it is clear that this is not a sub-phase of V, but a totally different stratum. As Stratum IV has been assigned to the Persian period, this stratum, with the single surviving corner, has been designated Stratum IV/V. On the basis of the ceramic finds it should be dated to the latter part of the Iron Age, in the late eighth-early seventh centuries BC. Stratum V (Plans 42-44, Photo 49) The major structure in Area C was excavated in Stratum V. This is a large building, 16.00 x 12.50 m., with massive walls 1.00 and 1 .40 m. wide. Two phases of this building were distinguished. The first phase represents the main, original structure, and the other built above it after part of the former structure was destroyed and probably went out of use. Photo 47.

Detailed plan of Stratum VA-B (Scale 1:125). 106</page><page sequence="118">Plan 44. Reconstruction of Stratum VB. Plan 43. Plan of the public building of Stratum VA. A detailed plan of the main building is given in Plan 42 (see also Photo 49), and its general outline is shown in the following Plan 43: As can be seen in the plan and in Photo 49, the entrance of the building was on the north and opened directly onto a large, open courtyard approximately 9.5 X 10.10 m. Two rooms, L. 548 with a floor at an elevation of 72.43 m., and L. 544 with a floor level of 72.72 m., are located on the southern side. The entrance to these rooms was from the courtyard, and judging from their size (4.00 x 2.20 m., and see below) they were roofed. The floors in L. 548 and L. 544 were badly dam- aged by construction activities in later strata; their elevations were intact and could be reconstructed. The floor level of L. 548 was reconstructed by its threshold which was found intact; the floor level of L. 544 was reconstructed by the relationship between the bases oř W. 66, W. 77, and W. 72 to the threshold of L. 548 (see section in Plan 40). The main entrance from the north is also a reconstruction. Judging from the plan and the two other entrances, a main entrance from the north seems most logical. It is also possible that there was a small entrance built into the court- yard in the eastern wall of the building. As noted above, we identified two phases in this building - the earlier and original phase described above, and a later phase built on top of at least part of the original building. The plan of this phase can be seen in Plan 42 and its reconstruction is presented in Plan 44: . Photo 49.

Detailed plan of Strata VII, VIII (Scale 1:125). 109</page><page sequence="121">Photo 50. Euboean subgeometric dinos. As can be seen in Plan 44, the main changes included the subdivision of the open courtyard into two large (4.50 x 7.50 m.) and two small (4.50 x 2.00 m.) spaces. One of the large spaces had a paved floor and was probably open while the other one could have been roofed. Wall W. 106a which bounds this new structure on the west was built directly on top of W. 106, thus attesting that stratigraphically there are two independent phases here. This wall also suggests the possibility of an additional entrance from the west. Stratum V/VI (Plan 45) The few fragmentary remains found in this stratum include walls W. 146, W. 91 , W. 120 and W. 110 in the south, with L. 551, L. 564a, b, L. 561 and L. 566 having floors at an elevation of 7 1 .70 m. In the center of the area are W. 118, W. 131, and L. 574 with a floor atan elevation of 7 1.50 m. In the north are walls W. 135, W. 136, W. 148, and L. 605, L. 606, and L. 607. The excavation of these loci has not yet reached floor level. Stratum V/VI can be subdivided into Stratum V/VIA and Stratum V/VIB. To Stratum V/VIA belong W. 147 in Square K/13, W. 136 and W. 148 in Squares H/15-16, W. 118a in Square J/14, as well as W. 135 whose latest phase belongs to this stratum. All the other walls shown in Plan 45 belong to Stratum V/VIB. While no reconstruction can be suggested for this stratum, it is of great importance for the understand- ing of the connection between Area C and Area D (see below). The Pottery Stratum V(+ V/VI) (Figs. 22-23, Photo 50). The key loci of Stratum V, which is known in this area mainly from the large public (?) building, are L. 518, L. 545 and L. 575. The typical pottery in these loci includes thickened-rim bowls with carinated body, Samaria ware, profiled-rim craters and moulded-rim cooking pots, as well as the cooking jar and hole-mouth stor- age jar. The stratigraphie position of L. 551 was unfortunately problematic, but it clearly belongs somewhere within the range of Stratum V/VI. Of special interest are the small "Phoenician" jug (Fig. 23:9), which was definitely imported to the site as evidenced by its clay composition (see above discus- sion of Stratum VI in Area D), and the dinos (Fig. 23:10, Photo 50), dated c. 700 BC.12 Stratum VII (Plans 46-47) This stratum, as presented in Plan 46, is composed of several walls in Squares J, K, L/13, 14, which together form an entire building. It consists of W. 1 10, W. 1 1 1 , W. 1 19, an entrance between W. 1 1 1 and W. 119, and floors at an elevation of c. 71.00 m. (L. 567, L. 568, L. 565, and L. 577). These walls enabled us to reconstruct the building as follows (Plan 47): Plan 47. Reconstruction of the building in Stratum VII. .12. I wish to thank Professor J.N. Coldstream for his following comments: "It seems to be part of a Euboean Subgeometric dinos, c. 700 B.C. or possibly a little later. The type was first noted by J. Boardman, Tottery from Eretria,' ABSA 47 (1952), p. 7, Fig. 9. Further examples are published by A. Andreiomenon in Arch. Ephemeris(l915), PI. 61 and by J. P. Descoen- dres in Eretria V (Bern 1976), Beil. 4. The spout is quite normal in Eubeoan Late Geometric and Subgeometric craters and dinoi. Although the Qiri example is only a fragment, it seems to preserve more of the profite than any pieces found in the Euboean homeland." 110</page><page sequence="122">Fig. 22.

The collared-rim pithos and Philis- tine sherds (Fig. 25:7, 12, 13) as well as the juglets with pinched rim and pointed base (Fig. 25: 10-1 1 ) are typical of the period. Stratum IX (Plan 48) This is the earliest Iron Age I stratum in Area C. As can be seen in the plan, only fragmentary remains have been excavated (mainly due to the small size of the excavated area). Wall W. 134 forms a corner with W. 134a, and L. 586 between them. Because of the limited size of the excavated area and the very frag- mentary remains, no reconstruction of the area was possible. THE STRATIGRAPHIC CONNECTION BETWEEN AREA C AND AREA D Despite their proximity, almost no physical strati- graphic connection exists between these two major excavation areas. This is due mainly to recent con- struction works that have leveled all the upper strata that could have provided a tangible link between Areas C and D. The only physical stratigraphie con- nection between the two areas is W. 135 in Squares G-H/14. Stratum V/VI can serve as the connecting link between the two areas. As noted above, with the exception of W. 118a remains of Stratum V/VI A were found only outside the public building of Stra- tum V. These include W. 147 in Square K/13, W. 136 and W. 148 in Squares H/15-16, as well as W. 135 which originally had been constructed in Stratum V/VIB and was also reused in Stratum V/VIA. The stratigraphie relationship between these walls and the public building of Stratum V was established by the fact that in the south W. 147 is directly beneath the walls which are connected with the public building, while in the north W. 108 of Stratum V cuts W. 148 and is built above W. 135, and is thus stratigraph- ically later than both. Our interpretation of the fact that almost no remains of Stratum V/VIA were found in the area excavated inside the public building of Stratum V is that Stratum V/VIA here was destroyed when the area was leveled in preparation for the construction 116 of the public building. Consequently, remains of Stratum V/VIA are found only outside of it. As can be seen in the plans and sections (Plans 9, 15, 45, 49), no remains later than Stratum V were found north of the public building of this stratum. Thus we do not know whether the public building stood isolated in the area or whether it was part of a larger complex of buildings. The recent construction in the area further complicates this question. Judging by the southern and eastern sides of this public build- ing, and by its massive walls and plan, one can assume that in its initial phase it was probably an isolated structure. In a later phase, after the building was partly destroyed and rebuilt, several other struc- tures were built around it. AREA A2 Area A2 was, in fact, composed of three sub-areas which were excavated separately: Squares L/4-5 excavated in the 1975 season, Squares L-M/6-7 exca- vated in the 1977 season, and the section in Square N/5 excavated towards the end of the 1977 season. The plans presented below are a reconstruction of the structures and artifacts revealed in the above three sub-areas. The general section of Area A2 appears in Plan 50. Strata V/VI-VII (Plan 51) The uppermost and latest Iron Age remains come from Strata V/VI and VII. These include L. 523, at an elevation of 75.14 m., which belongs to Stratum V/VI, and L. 543, at an elevation of 74.40 m., which belongs to Stratum VII. Apart from a few stones marked as W. 159 (Plan 51, Square L/6), no struc- tures were found attributable to these two strata. The Pottery Strata V/VI and P7/(Figs. 26-27; Photo 52). The later levels in this area are eroded and disturbed, and very little has been preserved. The two cooking pots from L. 523 (Fig. 26, Photo 52) were found directly above L. 543 and are of clear tenth century date. The L. 523 cooking pots are also typologically later than those of L. 543 (Fig. 27:6-8). Strata V-VII in Area A are extremely poor in finds as well as in architecture. Stratum VIII (Plan 51, Photo 53) Several structural remains excavated in Area A2 are assigned to this stratum. These include walls W. 155, W. 159a, W. 159b, W. 115a, W. 115b, and the upper</page><page sequence="128">c o o c c o o &lt;L&gt; Ä J3 • 22 3 cd C/5 D o Û cd D Vh &lt; O -o o *o c o &gt;&lt; 4&gt; O Vi 13 C/Î cd C O .2 ^ -4- &gt; I O (U &lt;u 5/5 13 1) o J3 C/3 H w ed c Z « &lt; U ^ «« O Cd OQ E m&lt; o O " &lt;u o O &lt;u 'S B &lt;u u C/3 X) OŇ Ti- cs cd Qu &lt;u £ O -O e o a C/5 &lt;D i-i Ul O O c cd a 0 £ _c c n u, &lt;u x&gt; a 3 C u J3 H§ «O ^ C &lt;D * 13 CU &lt;■&gt; 00 0) w (U .. c fi ^ .. §&gt; w II Sin c/i r 8* Ł ' (N S &lt; &gt; 2 » Vh &lt; .. c 3 •- cd &lt; ~ 1 Oí &lt; W) §1 'ZÎ o o zzi o o Crt o &lt;2 o Ö «o c cd £ 117</page><page sequence="129">Photo 52.

W. 155, which runs north-south in Squares L-M/7, is quite massive (Photo 53). It was built of large stones, c. 100 x 70 cm., and may have been part of a public building. The fragmentary state of all the walls in this stratum does not enable reconstruction. Strata VIII-IX (Plans 52-53, Photos 53-56) The earliest and most interesting building excavated in Area A2 belongs, on the basis of the pottery, to the end of Stratum IX and the beginning of Stratum VIII. The various structural remains of this stratum (Plan 52) suggest that the entire area was occupied by a large building, 100-120 sq. m. in size. As recon- structed in Plan 53, this building was of a "three- space house" type, i.e., it consisted of two long, roofed spaces, one on either side of the building, with an open courtyard between them (Photo 53). Here it is an "open plan," however, as the two roofed spaces were fully open to their full length towards the court- yard. This can be seen from W. 161 (Square L/6) Photo 53.

Of special interest are several installations found at the northwestern corner of Area A2, outside the above building, in Square L/4. These include a sys- tem of channels and cupmarks dug into bedrock. As can be seen in Plan 52 and Photo 54, one of the channels was covered with stones. The stratigraphie position and the function of these installations are not certain. The fact that W. 115 (Square L/4) was built above one of the cupmarks and the channels continue beneath walls W. 115 and W. 156 (Squares L/4-7) indicates that the building was stratigraphi- cally later than these installations. On the other hand, the many installations inside the building suggest that the ones inside and outside belong to the same system and that the building is only technically above the installations.

L. 852 is the key locus of Stratum VIII and L. 861, L. 867, L. 880 of Stratum VIII/IX in Area A. The "marked" cooking pot (Fig. 28:4) is of special inter- est for its "early" type of rim (see discussion below of "marked" cooking pots) as well as for the unique type of marking; marked pots are usually confined to the tenth century (Stratum VII), making this example the earliest of its kind yet discovered. The remainder of the cooking pots (Figs. 28:5-7, 29:8-12), of the overlapping type, fit well within the Iron Age I con- text; this is also true of the Philistine ware (Fig. 29:13-14), craters (Figs. 28:2-3, 29:5-7), cup and saucer (Fig. 29:4, Photo 33:4) and chalices (Figs. 28:9, 29:2-3, Photos 57-58). The last two types are clearly related to the "cultic building" of Area A2. The slipped and painted chalice (Fig. 28:9) is especially noteworthy. AREA B Area B was a test pit. The area excavated was quite small and consisted of two and a half squares of 5 x 5 m. in Strata I and II. The earlier and deeper Iron Age strata were excavated in one 5 x 5 m. square (L/9, Plan 54). Strata V, V/VI (Plan 54:1-2) Walls W. 85 and W. 105, with loci L. 555, L. 556 and L. 557, are building remains of these two strata. An oven in L. 557 suggests a floor level of c. 73.70-73. 90m. Stratum VII (Plan 54:3) Walls W. 85 and W. 105, whose upper parts have been described above in Strata III and IV, were origi- nally built in this stratum. Stratum V also includes W. 104 and an installation east of W. 105 which indicates a floor at about 73.15 m. Stratum VIII, Phases A + B (Plan 54:4) W. 109, L. 570 and part of a wall on the northwestern side form this stratum. Stratum VIII, Phase C (Plan 54:5) Fragmentary remains in the southeastern corner of the square were excavated here. They have been defined as L. 583 with an elevation of 71.00 m. Photo 57.

The numbers in the plan correspond to the following strata: 1, 2 = V, V/VI, 3 = VII, 4 = VIIIA+B, 5= VIIIC, 6= IX (Scale 1:100). Stratum IX (Plan 54:6) General Characteristics This small excavation area does not enable a recon- struction of the plans or function of the area. How- ever, the walls of the buildings of Strata V-VII are broader than usual and, as we shall see below, they may indicate a building with a public function. The proximity to the public building in Area A2 raises the possibility that Area B is the east end of the "public quarter" extending between Areas A2 and B. AREA F (Plans 55-56) Five stratigraphie phases have been excavated in Area F, at the southern slope of the site. The upper- most stratum here is composed of two parallel walls, W. 310 and W. 308 (Square N/12), with a floor level of 7 1 .00 m. between them. No remains of this stratum have been found south of W. 308, and it can be assumed that they were washed down the slope. On the basis of the stratigraphy and the pottery, these remains were assigned to Stratum V/VI and the two 124 parallel walls are probably a section of a street run- ning from north-east to south-west. Below Stratum V/VI the excavation reached ãã second set of two parallel walls, W. 301 and W. 305 (Squares O-P/12). These two walls run from north to south along the entire Area F and, like the stratum above, they are probably a section of the settlement's street network. Stratigraphically this north-south street belongs to Stratum VII. Fig. 28 No. Object Reg.

Portugali Tel Aviv University As noted above, the site of Tell Qiri is unique in the sense that, unlike most excavated sites in Israel which are urban, this is a genuine rural settlement. In the present chapter we will utilize the detailed stratigraphie analyses presented above to arrive at the general features of rural construction, architec- ture and the relation of the settlement to its imme- diate environment and the region in general. WALLS (Plan 59, Photo 60) Three methods of wall construction may be discerned in the various structures excavated. The first is an ordinary wall consisting of two rows of stones, with a fill of smaller stones and soil between them. The width of these walls is almost uniform, c. 60-65 cm., and they represent the standard wall in the region of Palestine and Syria from the Early Bronze Age until 50-100 years ago (Plan 59A). Photo 60. Fallen bricks in Stratum VIII-IX of Area A2. Plan 59. Plans, sections and elevations of wall types. The second type of wall, constructed of one line of relatively large stones, is laid as in Plan 59B. The average width here is also c. 60 cm. This construction method is less common, and in several cases we found walls which combined the two methods. In the third method, stones were laid obliquely in a single line, as indicated in Plan 59C. This construc- tion method, for example, characterizes W. 82, W. 83 and W. 65 of Phases VII A-C in Area D, as well as part of the public building of Stratum V in Area C. It was also used in Tel Qashish in the Early Bronze Age. As noted, the standard wall was c. 60-65 cm. in width. Smaller walls of 20-40 cm. generally served as partition walls or installations while the broader 132</page><page sequence="144">Photo 61. Ceiling fragment from the Cultic Building of Area A2, Stratum VII-IX. Note the negatives of branches used to support the plaster. walls, which are unusual, probably belonged to buildings of a public nature (see below). Most stone walls were, in fact, foundations for a brick super- structure. Mud-bricks were found in and around the public building in Area A2 (Photos 56 and 60). Their average size is 55 x 18 x 12 cm., so that three bricks laid straight (in length) measure 54 cm., which is equal to the length of a single brick. The ordinary wall with stone foundation and brick superstructure is shown in Plan 59D. SPANS AND ROOFING (Plan 60, Photo 61) Two types of spaces differing in the size of their spans were identified: spaces with a regular width of 2.00- 2.20 m. and an irregular length of 3, 5, and 7 m., and spaces whose smallest span is more than 2.50 m. The constant of 2.00-2.50 m. results from the prevailing roofing method which dictated that the span should be at least 2.20 m. The exact method of roofing can also be recon- structed on the basis of complete roof sections exca- vated in Area A2, Stratum VIII/IX. These are made of plaster which still preserves the imprints of thin wooden beams that supported it (Photo 61). The roofing method consisted of branches laid on top and between the two supporting walls, which were approximately 2.20 m. apart. The wet plaster was added to the layer of branches, and when dry, the roof was complete (see Plan 60). This constant of a space of c. 2.20 m. between the walls prevails in small and large buildings alike, irre- spective of the width and massiveness of their walls (cf., for example, the public building in Area C, Stra- tum V with other smaller buildings) and clearly attests to the use of the above roofing method. This regularity is not exclusive to Tell Qiri, nor to a spe- cific period; like the above standard wall size of 60-65 cm., this was the traditional roofing method over a widespread region and in almost all periods. Once identified, this regularity has enabled us to differentiate between open and roofed spaces and to reconstruct their plans and functions. It is interesting to note that this regularity also "explains" the plan of the "four-room house." The variety of plans which form this category of buildings all consist of roofed spaces with a regular width of 2.00-2.50 m. arranged around an open courtyard. 1 THE PLAN, SIZE AND FUNCTION OF BUILDINGS The sizes of the various buildings excavated vary from units of 190 or 130 sq. m. to units of 30 and even 10 sq. m. Their size distribution is illustrated in the following diagram: 190 . . y' 'X * // X / * X , 130 . • X V X ° ^ / i 100 " / x *v / • / 50 " / cř N X ' .

For a comparative discussion of the "four-room house," see Y. Shiloh, "The Four-Room House - Its Situation and Function in the Israelite City," IEJ 20 (1970), pp. 180-190. 133</page><page sequence="145">Plan 60. Reconstruction of a typical roof structure. which is 1 30 sq. m. Their public nature is reflected not only in their size, but also in the width and massive- ness of their walls. However, not all public buildings are large and massive: the oil press in Area D, Stra- tum VII is small in size and has ordinary walls 60-65 cm. wide. As only two structures were identified as public buildings, no generalization can be made as to the plan and structure of a "rural public building." It is interesting to note, however, that the public building in Area A2, Stratum VIII/IX was the only "four- room house" excavated at Tell Qiri (the other one, in Plan 17, is essentially an 80 percent reconstruction). We may thus hypothesize that the "four-room house" was an "urban building" constructed in a rural settlement such as Qiri only for public functions. The plan of the public building in Area C, Stratum V is simple, consisting of a large open courtyard with two rooms at the rear. The size and massiveness of the walls suggest that they may have been higher than the usual (whatever it was) and that the two rooms in the rear may have supported a second storey. The second group of buildings ranges in size from 80/85 to 40 sq. m. These probably represent the ordinary rural dwellings (see Nos. 4-9 in Plan 61). The rural houses consist of one, two, or three spaces in a row, one leading into the other. The entrance to the house often opened onto an open courtyard (Nos. 7, 8 in Plan 61). Two types of these ordinary rural houses have been found. In its basic plan the first one had an entrance opening onto a large courtyard c. 6.00 x 6.50 m. with a space in the back c. 2.00 x 6.00 m. This latter space was often subdivided as in No. 8 in Plan 61. It should be noted that this plan is almost identical to that of the public building in Area C, Stratum V. The open courtyard was used for cooking, and the spaces in the rear probably were used for sleeping and stor- age. An example of the development and change of such a building by the addition of further rooms in the open courtyard, which gradually became smaller or sometimes disappeared, can be seen in Plan 38. The second type of rural house was composed of two spaces in a row with entrances in the center of the longest wall. Nos. 5 and 6 in Plan 61 are examples of this type. From the surviving remains, it cannot be determined whether the spaces in the front of these buildings were roofed or not. The width of the front spaces, which is about 2.20 m., however, suggests that probably both the front and the back spaces were roofed. In this type, therefore, the entrance from the street led directly into a room, with no courtyard between them. The third group comprises one-room structures which open directly onto a street or an open public area as, for example, the one-room building in Area D, Phases VIIC, VIIB, and VIIA. The last two build- ings were the only "long houses" excavated at Tell Qiri and are associated with the oil press (see below). THE OIL PRESS We have mentioned the oil press above in the strati- graphic analysis of Area D, Phase VIIA. In our dis- cussion of the use and function of this installation, we shall compare what is known about the traditional oil press2 with the actual findings in the area. The basic stages in olive oil production are as follows: First, the olives are warmed, and then crushed, probably with a large stone on bedrock or in a stone bowl. The crushed olives are then placed into wicker baskets which are piled one on top of the other on the oil press. The press itself consisted of a single stone in which a pressing surface was hollowed out at a depth of 5-10 cm., leading to a channel in one of its corners. The oil was extracted by pressing with a heavy stone over the pile of baskets or by a more 2. See S.

Hypothetical reconstruction of the plan of the southern part of the rural settlement at Tell Qiri. sophisticated method which employed a beam press with a stone weight at its end. The oil gradually flowed into a jar placed beneath the press funnel. In traditional oil presses still in existence today, the owner of the oil press receives about one tenth of the product. In Area D, Phase VII A, an oil press complete with stone basin and jar below the funnel, and olive pits around, was found in situ inside Room L. 653 (see Plans 21, 23, 24). Outside this room, in an open space, were two built pits and a small stone bowl (L. 1055 and L. 1056, Plan 21. 3 In comparing the above method of olive oil production with the actual finds in the excavation, it can be assumed that the two pits and the stone basin were connected with the function- ing of the oil press and were used in the crushing processes, and perhaps also for the purpose of allo- cating the owner his share. The two large built pits at the back of the oil press room were probably used for storage. 3. For similar installations from the Iron Age, see Avi- tzur, ibid, and D. Eitam, "Olive Presses of the Israelite Period," TA 6 (1979), pp. 146-155. 136</page><page sequence="148">THE PLAN OF THE SETTLEMENT The excavation at Tell Qiri was of too small a scale to enable a reconstruction of the sequence of settle- ments. This was possible, as we have seen above, only for some of the strata of Area D. We will attempt here to reconstruct the southern part of the settlement, for one period only, Stratum VIII, the remains of which occur in all of the excavation areas. In one case, in Area C, the building of Stratum VII has been used, as its general orientation is identical with the buildings of Stratum VIII. No attempt has been made to recon- struct the exact plan of Stratum VIII - this was not possible for any of the strata - but rather to describe the nature, or the basic structure, of the Iron Age rural settlement of Tell Qiri. We first drew all the Stratum VIII structures from all of the excavation areas on a single plan. This allowed us to determine the general orientation of the buildings in the various parts of the site. This information, in conjunction with the entrances to buildings and the various street sections excavated, enabled us to reconstruct the entire street network. The known boundary of the * settlement - the slopes of the Carmel mountains on the west and the river and slope of the mound on the east - completes the picture. The results of this exercise are presented in Plan 62. The reconstruction shows the rural settlement of Qiri as it is located at the lower end of the slope of the Carmel mountains. A street leads to the settlement from the south, probably from the spring of Ein Shofet, and splits in front of the village into two branches - one leading into the settlement and another between the site and the mountain, encircling it. Inside the settlement, the reconstruction exhibits an articulated street network. This plan was not the result of a centrally planned design, as in urban settle- ments, but was the outcome of an organic and grad- ual process of change and growth, in which each new building adapted itself to the existing system of build- ings and streets and, at the same time, contributed to shape and modify the overall character of the settlement. THE SETTLEMENT AND ITS ENVIRONMENT Land Use Plan 63 presents a reconstruction of land use in the environs of the Iron Age settlement at Tell Qiri. The analysis of land use was conducted in the following stages: First, the fields' "catchment area" had to be delineated. This was achieved elsewhere by con- structing Tissen polygons between Qiri and the sur- rounding Iron Age settlements. Such polygons defined the land which is closer to Qiri than to any other settlement. The result was a long, narrow plot of land stretching between the mountains and the Qishon River.4 (It is interesting to note that this pattern corresponds closely with that of traditional Arab villages in this region, as recorded by the PEF map.) Secondly, using J. Dan and Z. Raz's study on soil typology, the soil was classified and its agricultu- ral potential was determined.5 Four types of areas were defined - areas which are optimal for natural forest, plantation and grass, and areas which are potential flood areas and swamps. Thirdly, the Bible is also of assistance, as it defines three types of land outside a settlement:6 (1) migrashim - "public open spaces" immediately outside the settlement; (2 ) sadot - the fields of the settlement; and (3 )naot - grazing or pasture land.7 Fourthly, the flotation analysis at Tell Qiri revealed seeds of the following types:8 vetch, bean, wheat, oak, pistacia, olives and pome- granates. The bone analysis indicates that 85% of the bones found at Tell Qiri are of sheep and goats, about 10% of cows, others of wild animals such as gazelle, deer, wild pig, and bear. These point to the existence of herding and hunting.9 Finally, according to the land use theory, land which requires frequent and intensive cultivation is usually that situated closest to the settlement, while the extensive system of agricul- ture was applied to the land further away.10 Given the above information, an attempt has been made to allocate the various types of seeds, plants and animals to their optimal environmental areas. Plan 63 indicates that hunting took place in the mountains west of Tell Qiri (bear, gazelle and deer) as 4. See Y. Portugali, "Arim, Banot, Migrashim and Hase - rim : The Spatial Organization of Eretz Israel in the 12th- 10th Centuries BCE, According to the Bible," in: EI 17 (1984), pp. 282-290 (Hebrew). 5.

Grazing took place in the natural forest near Tell Qiri on the west, as well as beyond the fields - about 3 km. east of the site. The vetch and beans were restricted to the irrigated area, a 10-15 minute walk from the settlement where two small rivers flow, and the wheat to the unirrigated land - 2 to 3 km. from the settlement. There may also have been olive and pomegranate trees near or even inside the settlement, but the majority of these products came from the plantations southeast of Tell Qiri.11 11. The method of reconstructing agricultural land use has been termed site catchment analysis ; ibid., pp. 229-236. Plan 63 is, in fact, an elaborated alternative to site catchment analysis. Plan 63.

Hunt University of California, Berkeley Comments on Methodology The study of the Iron Age pottery of Palestine has long been a major concern of Syro-Palestinian archaeologists, and numerous typologies have been proposed for the period. Perhaps the best known is that of Ruth Amiran.1 It must certainly be acknowl- edged that the general course of the development of pottery during the Israelite period has already been established. These typologies were usually based on whole pro- files and complete forms, comparatively rare finds in most excavations. Even "diagnostic" sherds, those whose full form and precise data can be determined, are relatively rare. Due to these limitations only a small proportion of the excavated pottery is normally used in determining the ceramic characteristics of a stratum. Most excavations, save only a "representa- tive sample" of the pottery, and then only a part of that sample, is used in the analysis. Based upon principles drawn from outside Syro- Palestinian archaeology, some excavations in the Levant have made attempts to change this standard method for analyzing pottery. One common innova- tion has been the systematic collection and analysis of a larger portion of the pottery excavated. During the course of the excavations at Tell Qiri, the staff of the YRP decided to save all excavated rims in addition to the standard representative sample. The representative sample is normally composed of a selection of those sherds considered to be diagnostic of a particular period or form. Imported or highly decorated diagnostic sherds are probably the most frequently selected. Only when whole vessels are con- sidered likely to be present are all excavated sherds saved, and even then only those considered to be diagnostic are used in the analysis of the pottery. The standard presence/absence system of pottery analysis, based on the representative sample, can only measure the beginning and end of a cultural feature. The method can make no estimate of the frequency of the feature at any point during its life- span. Chronological conclusions are based upon the presence of a group of associated features in a given context. If the frequency of variations through time could be accurately measured, the association of the fea- tures in a given context could be much more clearly defined. Not only the presence of a feature, but also its frequency, could be used to define its chronologi- cal range. The more features for which ranges were established, the more accurate the dating of each context would be. However, in order to make a reasonable estimate of the frequency of any feature, it is essential to have a consistent sample of the pottery surviving after occu- pation was disrupted, and still remaining today after later disturbances. Even this sample is rarely col- * I would like to thank all those who have assisted me with this study, especially Amnon Ben-Tor, Yuval Portugali, Miriam Avissar and Aviva Schwartzfeld, without whose unstinting help and advice this pro- ject would have taken even longer to complete than it did. Any errors that remain are my responsibility and not of those who did so much to share their knowledge with me. I would also like to express my gratitude to the American Schools of Oriental Research, the Charles E. Merrill Foundation, the Regents of the University of California, and the Uni- versity Research Expeditions Program of the Univer- sity of California for providing financial assistance during the time this work was researched and written. 1 .

However, by establishing specific criteria and collecting and analyzing that sample as com- pletely as possible we can get a consistent sample. The haphazard selection of some, or even all, of the diag- nostic sherds excavated cannot be considered a con- sistent sample when the amounts and types of the discarded sherds are not known. One solution to this problem is simply to save and attempt to use in analysis every sherd excavated. Some excavations, notably those at Tyre2 and Deir 'Alia,3 have adopted this strategy.4 When the final analysis was completed, it was found that rim type was the only feature that could be used in statistical analysis. In light of this experience, the YRP staff decided to simplify the process by saving and using in the analy- sis all the rims excavated. By counting the number of each type of rim in each locus and stratum, and using that evidence as a sample of the original ceramic population, it is possible to construct frequency pro- files which estimate the relative frequency profile of the features selected (i.e., rims). It should be noted that the study of the frequency of each rim type does not provide an estimate of the absolute frequency of each form. For example, open vessels such as bowls have a higher ratio of rim to body than do closed vessels such as storage jars. Thus 1,000 bowl rims probably represent the survival of evidence for the presence of fewer vessels than would 1 ,000 storage jar rims. When any sort of sampling is done, an almost limitless number of errors and biasing factors may influence the result. At every excavation errors are made. While digging, some sherds are sure to escape detection and may be discarded with the dirt. Sherds may be placed in the wrong basket by workers or supervisors. Records may be incorrectly made, or not made at all, or even lost. Computer records may be incorrectly recorded. Inevitably some joints may not be noticed, or the evidence for the joint may not have been preserved, and a single vessel may be repre- sented by more than one rim. Accordingly, special efforts were made to mini- mize the effect of these problems. First of all, each ceramic form is studied separately. Thus, vessels with a greater proportion of rim to body are not compared to those with a lower ratio. In counting rims, a central issue is the question of joints. When two or more sherds join, or a complete vessel is recovered, should such rims be given the same statistical importance as a single small sherd? There is no simple answer to this question. We counted such rims only once. If sample size is large enough, it can be assumed that these errors were also consistent. Were this study concerned with the abso- lute frequency of the rim types in each phase, the problem would be virtually insurmountable. But a relative frequency traces only the changes that are observed in the sample as it exists today. Since the biasing factors are equally likely to have occurred in any phase, the resulting profiles should still be an acceptable estimate.5 The ultimate test of any method is the results. If they bear no relation to what previous researchers have found, and to what is already known of the Iron Age, then the results can be rejected. But if new knowledge, however flawed, is ascertained, then the method should be considered valid. A work such as this can not be fully evaluated until other sites have produced comparable results. YRP field excavation procedures were not greatly modified by the decision to save all excavated rims. General excavation techniques were based upon the locus to stratum methodology. The pottery from each locus was collected in one or more "baskets." As all excavations in the Near East currently save all the pottery they excavate until it is washed and sorted, it was not necessary to change field procedures. Sorting procedures, however, did require modifi- cation. In general, rims were presorted during wash- ing and were placed together in a corner of the drying 2. P. Bikai, The Pottery of Tyre (Warminster 1978). 3. H. Franken, Excavations at Tell Deir 'Alia, /( Leiden 1969). 4. Tyre and Deir 'Alia are the only sites where the excavators attempted such a methodology and pub- lished their results fully for the Iron Age. Excava- tions at Tell Jemmeh and elsewhere have experimented, but their results are not yet available. 5. The range of possible methods for study of ancient pottery is very wide. Each excavation must choose the elements which provide the desired results. This study stresses form over such considerations as volu- metrics or fabric for specific reasons. No attempt has been made to measure the rims, either in size or in relation to other parts of the vessel. While such measurements can produce worthwhile results in studies of complete vessels, most of the sherds used in this study were too small a part of the whole vessel to allow accurate measurement. The detailed study of fabric of Iron Age pottery has yet to produce any results that may justify the effort involved. 140</page><page sequence="152">tray. During the sorting procedure a normal repre- sentative sample was selected, along with all the rims. This procedure was followed for virtually every locus of every chronological period, except for loci known to be contaminated, pottery found on the surface of a square or during cleaning at the beginning of a sea- son.6 After sorting, the discarded body sherds were normally placed in a labelled section of a "cemetery" so that it would be possible to recover sherds for restoration, if necessary. Storage and recording procedures also required more space and effort. All the sherds were labelled with the site, locus, basket and sherd numbers (as is usual on most Near Eastern excavations) and stored in boxes. Quite often the eye sees what it expects to see. To ensure that the classification of the pottery would be as unbiased as possible, the classifier did not know the stratigraphie context of any of the loci before the pottery was typed. For the most part, the pottery for this study was typed long before the detailed strati- graphic analysis at each site had been completed. A. Rim Typology for Iron Age Pottery INTRODUCTION Any attempt to change pottery sampling methods is problematic. If an expedition wishes to use a larger part of the pottery sample, much of it is simply unclassifiable according to current pottery typolo- gies, which require a level of preservation most sherds cannot meet. The problems with standard typologies quickly became evident to the staff of the YRP. For example, a recent study of the pottery of Tyre by P. Bikai7 found that more than 20% of even the diagnos- tic sherds from the site could not be classified by the typology in use, and diagnostic sherds form only a small part of the total sample. To solve such prob- lems, the YRP staff developed a new typology for Iron Age rims based upon three principles: 1) The typology should include virtually the entire corpus of Iron Age rims excavated, so that a sound statistical sample could be obtained. 2) The typology should be relatively simple so that it could be learned quickly and used with relative ease. 3) Other significant features of the pottery would be integrated into both the rim typology and the analysis, when appropriate. In this way the results of the rim study could be compared more effectively to excavations using standard methodologies. To ensure that the typology included as much of the YRP corpus as possible, it was developed directly from the pottery excavated. By repeatedly working through the Qiri pottery, a typology that accurately reflects all the Iron Age rim forms found at the site was developed. As new forms were found at Yoq- ne'am and Qashish, the typology was expanded to include all the Iron Age rim forms from these sites. It was possible to build a profile of the characteristic pottery types and their relative quantities for each phase. To accomplish the twin goals of simplicity and facility, the typology is organized in a hierarchical manner and the definitions of the types are broadly based. The highest level of distinction is the division of the typology into two main components. The Full Typology includes all the Iron Age rim forms exca- vated, while the Streamlined Typology emphasizes those forms which have chronological importance at YRP sites. The Full Typology is subdivided into three main sections. The first, the Primary Form Typology, cov- ers the five main vessel types (cooking pot, storage jar, bowl, crater and jug) which account for the vast majority of the excavated pottery. The Secondary Form Typology includes most of the less common forms and the various special decorated and imported wares, such as chalices, Philistine ware and Assyrian pottery. The Minor Form Typology includes vessels that are methodologically problem- atic. These vessels are not only rare, they are also intrinsically unsuited for study by a rim analysis. For example, lamps are not suitable as the spout of the 6. These procedures were in most cases the result of trial and error. 7. Bikai (above, n. 2), p. 18. Out of 31,039 diagnostic sherds, 23% were "non-typable." For the Late Bronze, 45% of the diagnostic sherds fell into that category. A suitable response would have been the development of a more comprehensive typology. 141</page><page sequence="153">lamp is always simple in form, regardless of the form the rim of the rest of the vessel may take. The Streamlined Typology was derived from the first three, using the information gained from the stratigraphie analysis of the pottery. This version of the typology emphasizes the chronologically signifi- cant rim types and reduces the distraction the many types of the full typologies could induce. Neverthe- less, the full versions are essential as they reflect the full range of variation at the YRP sites and allow the more frequent types to be seen in the proper perspective. Each section of typology is first divided into vessel forms, such as cooking pots, or into wares, such as Philistine pottery. Since previous research had devel- oped a detailed knowledge of the pottery of Iron Age Palestine, long-established special wares were sepa- rated from the standard pottery in the typology. When the various wares share a rim form with the standard pottery, this relationship is clearly noted in the typology, so the various sections of the typology can be easily related. The rim types of each section are then distin- guished by individual characteristics. Each type has a certain range of variation, as the production methods of the period made the exact, unvarying duplication of vessels impossible. One of the major difficulties in developing a typology is the recognition of those variations which are significant from those that are the result of minor variations of technique or chance. The YRP staff used the knowledge gained from pre- vious studies of Iron Age pottery as a guide to the definition of types and the selection of significant variations. An effort was always made to relate the YRP types to previous full form typologies whenever possible. While the individual types are the basis of the typology, on occasion two or more of the types were found to share common features. When these were also of interest, an intermediate typological division, called a Group, was established between a Form or Ware and a Type. The grouping of types made the typology more flexible, as the analysis could proceed at several levels. For example, three types of "pinched" rim cooking pots were defined, depending on the direction in which the ridge of the rim was angled. The stratigraphie analysis shows that the angle of the ridge is not chronologically significant, so that the "pinched" rims did form a clear group. If rim form were the only significant feature of pottery vessels, all typologies could be based on rim form alone. But previous research has already estab- lished that other features of a vessel, such as body profile, are of vital importance. When advisable, non-rim features were integrated into the typology, usually at the Group level. At the same time, care was taken to ensure that the rim form remained specific within each type. The result may seem to be a "mixed" typology, but it is consistent at its most basic level. In order to ensure that as much information as practicable was included in the study, the analysis of the Iron Age pottery was converted from standard recording procedures to computer recording. The initial work on the Qiri pottery had been done by hand. For each basket the possible rim types were listed on the form and a tick mark was made for each rim of that type. Similar sheets for each locus tallied the totals for the baskets. Other characteristics of the pottery, including decoration and the presence of diagnostic non-rim sherds, were also recorded on the basket sheets, but these details could only be recov- ered with difficulty. Despite the use of numerous secondary lists for such topics as Samaria ware sherds or collared-rim pithos body sherds, the secondary information could not be coordinated with the data on rim type. The statistical analysis of the Qiri pot- tery based upon these records was restricted to the rim type alone, as this was the only information which could be summarized on the locus record sheets. As the YRP excavations progressed from Qiri to Yoqne'am and Qashish, the quantity of pottery increased in pace with the growth in the size of the work force. About 7,000 sherds were saved during the main season at Qiri, a total that was easily surpassed each subsequent season at Yoqne'am. This mass of material was the best argument for the use of a computer-based system. Using a computer recording system also freed the study from the confines of single purpose recording systems. The computer recording system could be based on individual sherds rather than on the basket or locus. This change gave much more freedom for the kind of data that could be recorded and utilized in the study. It became possible to associate a whole range of features to rim type. Decoration, body profile, handles and bases are all important and significant features of Iron Age pot- tery. However, unless these features could be consis- tently associated with rim form, they could play no role in the statistical analysis. Since each sherd has a separate and unique computer record, it was a rela- 142</page><page sequence="154">tively simple matter to include information about all these features in each record. Recording the pottery sherd by sherd had other benefits as well. As all the saved pottery, and not just the rims, was recorded, the computer records could be used to locate any type of Iron Age sherd. This feature eliminated the need for long searches through dusty boxes in order to make a list of all the sherds sharing a characteristic. The savings in time spent on office procedures were significant. FULL RIM TYPOLOGY PRIMARY FORMS Cooking Pots (CP) (Figs. 33-34) CP Group I: Triangular Rim The rim of this group is thickened and has a triangu- lar section. The outer line of the rim, from the lip of the vessel to the lower edge of the triangle, is basically straight. The body profile is always carinated. CP I/a : Overlapping . The lower edge of the triangle continues below a hypothetical horizontal line drawn through the base of the rim. CP I/b: Horizontal. The lower edge of the rim does not continue below a horizontal line drawn through the base of the rim. The lower edge of the triangle is horizontal or slants upwards. CP I/c: Massive. Similar in profile to CP I/b, but both the vessel and the rim are much larger. As no absolute standard size can be reasonably established, the dividing line between CP I/b and CP I/c is some- times subjective. CP Group II: Pinched Rim The lower edge of this rim is pinched into a ridge or flange. The line from the lip of the vessel to the lower edge of the rim is not straight. The body profile is always carinated.8 CP Il/a: Overlapping. The ridge slants downward. CP Il/b: Horizontal. The ridge slants upward or horizontally. CP II/c: Miniature. Similar in profile to CP Il/b, but the rims are small. As no absolute standard size can be reasonably established, the dividing line between CP Il/b and CP II/c is sometimes subjective. CP Group III: Modelled Rim This rim is thickened and has a stepped section. The thickening results in a wide variety of shapes. The carination is usually weaker than that found on the vessels of CP I and II.9 CP Group IV: Cooking Jars This rim is simple and the body is globular rather than carinated. (The rim may be slightly thickened on the interior.) These vessels are called jars to distin- guish them from the other CP groups, as in some typological systems they are classified as jugs rather than as cooking vessels.10 CP IV/a : High-Necked. A high neck. The lip is usu- ally turned in. There are usually two handles. CP IV/b: Low Necked. Low flaring neck. The lip is usually turned out. This type usually has one handle. CP Varia The rims included in this classification occur in small quantities and have rim forms which do not corre- spond to the main groups. Within this category, a number of forms were isolated in order to test their possible chronological significance. A. Triangular. This type has a narrow-necked, globular body and rim with triangular section. B. Flattened. This type is related to CP I, as it also has a basically triangular rim. The triangle's outer side is flattened or smoothed. 8. CP I and II have basically the same folded-over type of rim. The main difference is the final finishing of the folds, which in the case of CP II are pinched into a ridge. 9. The term "modelled" is used generically in this study for rims with modifications which could not be designated by a more descriptive term. 10. Amiran (above, n. 1), p. 238. 143</page><page sequence="155">C. Hole-mouth. Characterized by the absence of a neck. The rim may be slightly thickened on the inte- rior. No handles have yet been found on this type. D. Inturned. The lip of the vessel turns inward. E. Out turned. The lip of the vessel turns outward. F. Other. This type includes the CP rims found in Iron Age levels which could not be assigned to any other classification. Most of the forms are unique.

Absence of or only a very slight ridge around the neck. The rim is usually thickened. It is usually made of light colored clay, easily distin- guishable from that of PO/b. PO/b: Collared Rim. This type has one or more ridges (the so-called collar) around the base of the neck. The</page><page sequence="156">rim is usually thickened and the body usually has an oval profile. In some typologies, this vessel is classi- fied as a storage jar.

Other Types (OT) (Fig. 45) These are rare vessels and do not fit into the more general groupings by use and decoration. They are often highly individualistic. The following types are general groupings only. OT/a: Incense Burner (Bowl). This vessel is a rela- tively large bowl with a projecting base which fitted into a stand. ÒT/a: Incense Burner (Stand). This is an upright clay tube used to support an incense burner or other object. It often has holes or "windows" cut into the side. OT/b: Double Vessel. This vessel has two or more cups or bowls joined together. OT/c: Kernos. This vessel is composed of a hollow clay ring to which several appendages are joined. OT/d: Strainer Body. This vessel is usually a small jar on legs, with perforations on the upper part or all over the body. OT/e: Votive. This type of vessel is a miniature copy of a normal vessel. OT/f: Beer- Jug. The distinguishing feature of this type is a perforated spout set into the body of the vessel. The rim of this vessel can only be identified when the connection between the spout and rim has been preserved. OT/g: Three-Handled Jar. This type is distinguished by the presence of three handles. 149</page><page sequence="161">Fig. 33 No. Site/ Year Basket No. Locus Object 1 Qiri 76 2260/12 690 Cooking pot 2 Qiri 75 480/4 670 Cooking pot 3 Qiri 75 392/1 853 Cooking pot 4 Qiri 75 474/13 569 Cooking pot 5 Qiri 76 2546 1100 Cooking pot 6 Qiri 76 2124/1 1020 Cooking pot 7 Qiri 75 300/25 651 Cooking pot 8 Qiri 76 2287/4 1036 Cooking pot 9 Qiri 75 305/19 851 Cooking pot 10 Qiri 76 2742/10 1143 Cooking pot 1 1 Qiri 75 285/29 543 Cooking pot 12 Qiri 75 314/8 544 Cooking pot 13 Qiri 75 325/37 530 Cooking pot 14 Qiri 75 365 530 Cooking pot 150</page><page sequence="162">Fig. 33.

Though these types are necessary to fully document the entire corpus at the YRP sites and may one day prove to be significant in other areas of ancient Israel, their sheer number can detract attention from those forms which are of significance. With these observations in mind, a "streamlined" typology was developed, in which proven insignifi- cant variations were eliminated. In order to simplify the format, only the four most frequent forms (cook- ing pot, storage jar, bowl and crater) were included. While this Streamlined Typology is a useful tool in the analysis of the significance of the YRP pottery, it could not replace the full typology in the earlier stages of the work. One of the key requirements of this type of statistical analysis is a complete sample. Only when the full corpus of rim forms is defined is it possible to determine which are significant. If any forms are excluded, the size of the sample is unknown and sound statistical analysis is impossible. STREAMLINED RIM TYPOLOGY (Figs. 46-47) Cooking Pots (CP) CP Group I: Triangular Rim A thickened rim with a triangular section. The outer line of the rim, from the lip of the vessel to the lower edge of the rim, is straight. The body profile is always carinated. CP Group II: Pinched Rim The lower edge of the rim is pinched into a ridge or flange. The line from the lip of the vessel to the lower edge of the triangular rim is not straight. The body profile is always carinated. CP Group III: Modelled Rim A thickened rim with a stepped section. The thicken- ing results in a wide variety of shapes. The carination is weaker than on the vessels of CP I and II.15 15. See n. 9. 176 CP Group IV: Cooking Jars A simple rim and globular rather than carinated body. The vessel has a high neck, and the lip of the rim may be turned in. There are usually two handles. Storage Jars (SJ) S J Group I: High-Necked This group displays a relatively high neck. SJ I/a: Simple. The combination of simple rim and high neck occurs on oval, sharp-shouldered and sausage-shaped storage jars. SJ I/b: Thickened without Ridge. A thickened rim without a ridge on the neck. This combination of rim and neck occurs on oval and sharp-shouldered stor- age jars. SJ I/c: Thickened with Ridge. A thickened rim with a ridge on the nepk. This combination of rim and neck occurs on oval and sharp-shouldered storage jars. SJ Group V: Specific Rim and Body These rim forms are associated with a single, specific body profile, which can be predicted from the rim alone. S J V/a : Canaanite Jar. This type represents the survi- val of the Late Bronze storage jar tradition. It has a low neck and a carinated body. SJ V/b: Hole-mouth. Marked by the absence of a neck and thickened rim with a sharply marked edge along the outer circumference. The body profile is cylindrical. SJ V/c: Globular. A thickened rim with a triangular profile. The body profile is globular. SJ V/d: Rectangular. A thickened rim with a rectan- gular profile. The vessel has a low neck and angular shoulders. The body profile is sausage-shaped. This type is also included in SJ V.</page><page sequence="188">Bowls (B) B Group I: Basic Rim Types These rims appear on both carinated and rounded bowls. B I/a: Simple. Simple rounded rim. B I/b: Rectangular. Flattened horizontal rim. B I/c: Bevelled. The outer surface of the rim slopes outward diagonally. B I/d: Thickened. The rim is wider than the body wall on both the interior and exterior, and usually has a convex upper surface. B I/e: Ledged. Rim is wider than the body wall on both the interior and exterior, and has a flattened upper surface. The orientation of the upper surface of the rim is not significant. B I/f: Ledged Out. The rim is wider than the body wall on the exterior only. Otherwise similar to B I/f (Fig. 37). B Group IV: Special Body Profiles These rim forms appear with special and specific body profiles, which can be predicted even for rims without a preserved body profile. B IV/a: Spherical. Spherical body profile. The rim is usually thickened, like B I/e. B IV/b: Plate. Shallow flaring body. The rim is not widened. B IV/c: Bell-Shaped. Simple outturned rim and an S-curved body profile, usually with horizontal loop handles. Craters (C) C Group I: Circular Rim The rim has a circular profile. This group is usually handleless and occurs with various body profiles. C Group II: Profiled Rim A widened rim with a profile ranging from oval to rectangular. This group is usually handleless and occurs with various body profiles. C Group III: Sloped Rim A widened rim with an oval or triangular profile whose upper surface slopes diagonally outwards. These vessels usually have two loop handles and occur with various body profiles. C Group IV: Ledged Rim Rim with a flattened upper surface. It is usually wider than the body wall. B. Pottery Analysis INTRODUCTION The pottery from the YRP sites has already been analyzed on a regional basis through the 1981 sea- son,16 and the results will be included here when they supplement or modify conclusions based upon the Qiri pottery alone. This analysis has clearly estab- lished that the pottery corpus of the three sites is closely interrelated. Just as the new field methods employed by the YRP required a new pottery typology, the interpreta- tion of the data provided by those methods requires new kinds of analysis. Much of the evidence pre- sented here is quantitative, which, if it is to be reason- ably accurate, must conform to certain statistical standards which may affect more than just the numbers involved. For example, one major limita- tion of a quantitative study is the need for an ade- quate sample size. In statistics, a sample size of 15 or more is generally considered acceptable. In this study the rims of each vessel or ware are studied by strati- graphic phase. A sample size of at least 25 rims is required before the results for a phase are accepted as representative of the population of the phase as a whole. Phases with a sample size of less than 15 rims are considered too small for accurate analysis. Another requirement for any quantitative analysis is the need to define a level of significance. In any study, sample error and other unavoidable distorting factors must be taken into account when evaluating the raw data or results. For example, in one stratum rim type A may be .01% more frequent than rim type 16. M.

Such a small difference in frequency may not be significant and may be due to sample error rather than to a real difference in the population. For this work a general level of significance of 5% has been adopted. Thus, for primary forms, any rim type which fails to account for at least 5% of the sample for any phase or stratum is not accepted as character- istic of the phase. In the same way, unless the frequen- cies of two rim types are separated by at least 5%, the difference is not considered significant. In general, trends over time are stressed more than the quantitative difference between any two rim types in any one phase. Emphasis is generally placed on the frequency of the rim types only when one form is clearly dominant over all others in a phase, itself accounting for the majority of the sample. The con- sistent, gradual, phase by phase increase or decrease of a rim type is the most reliable kind of evidence for indicating the true trends of the frequency of the rim types and their general level of popularity. For Qiri, the quantitative analysis can only be carried out at the level of the stratum because the sample size of even the primary forms is too small to allow analysis by architectural phase. The two latest Iron Age strata at Qiri, Strata V and VI, must be combined, as Stratum V was badly disturbed by building activities by Kibbutz Hazorea. As Stratum V was represented by only a single phase and Stratum VI by two, together they account for the same number of phases as the other three Iron Age strata. The vessels assigned to the category of secondary forms were classified as such because they occurred in relatively small quantities at the YRP sites. Some of the secondary forms, such as Cypro-Phoenician ware, occur in small quantity because they were imported. Others, such as Samaria ware, were pro- duced in Palestine but are rare because they were a fine luxury product. Finally, forms such as baking trays had everyday uses but simply were not used in great quantity. For the primary pottery forms, at least 25 rims in each phase were required before the quantitative analysis could be accepted with confidence. The secondary forms cannot meet this statistical stan- dard. The phase by phase fluctuations in frequency of these less common forms cannot be taken as seriously as those of the primary forms. A secondary rim type could vary from 0% to 100% of the sample on the basis of the presence of a single rim. The change in frequency has occurred, but it cannot be considered 180 significant. Therefore, the analysis of the secondary form must emphasize the major tendencies and trends rather than phase by phase changes in fre- quency. This method of analysis resembles standard presence/absence techniques, except in this study the relative frequency of each of the secondary forms in relation to that of the whole stratum or site is established. As was noted in the discussion of the typology, the minor forms occur in extremely small quantities and are intrinsically unsuited for analysis by rim type. The observations concerning the limitations of a small sample size made in relation to secondary forms apply to minor forms as well. The format of the pottery analysis that follows conforms in general to that found in standard studies of the pottery of ancient Israel. Each form or ware is presented individually. In each section, a brief intro- duction describes the vessel or ware. Then the strati- graphic evidence is summarized and followed by an analysis of the importance of each of the YRP rim types. Finally, the evidence provided by this study is compared with previous ideas concerning that form or ware. Since the following sections deal with only a single portion of the pottery corpus at one time, it may be advantageous to describe some of the characteristics of the Iron Age pottery from Qiri as a whole. Signifi- cant observations can be made concerning the fre- quencies of the various vessels. PERCENTAGES OF VESSELS AT QIRI Proportion Cum Prop Cooking pots .2436 .2436 Storage jars .2456 .4892 Bowls .2111 .7003 Craters .1905 .8908 Jugs .0484 .9392 Secondary forms .0371 .9763 Minor forms .0237 1.0000 This table strikingly illustrates the numerical dom- inance of the five vessels which compose the primary forms. They alone account for more than 90% of the rims excavated at Qiri, and these figures are con- firmed by the results at Yoqne'am and Qashish. Cooking pots and storage jars are the two most fre-</page><page sequence="192">quent types, in raw numbers. Since the rim of a storage jar is much smaller in proportion to the body than that of a cooking pot, it is reasonable to assume that storage jars were the most common vessel in an Iron Age settlement. Bowls are only slightly less frequent in raw numbers than cooking pots. However, craters serve essentially the same functions as bowls, so that the two can be combined when considering the impor- tance of tableware as a class. Tableware accounts for 40% of the raw sample, indicating that in the past, as in modern households, this class was very important. Jugs are the least frequent of the primary forms, although they still deserve inclusion when contrasted with the extremely low frequencies of the secondary and minor forms. It is clear that the most important roles for pottery in the Iron Age were the storage, preparation and consumption of foodstuffs. The secondary and minor forms are truly infre- quent and thus are relatively unimportant at the three YRP sites. The secondary forms include all imported wares, as well as special local pottery, such as Philis- tine, Samaria and Bichrome wares. These three wares together account for only a fraction of 1% of the sample. The imported wares together occurred at about the same frequency, with Cypro-Phoenician pottery by far the most common. This distribution raises an important point of archaeological procedure. The main goal of the anal- ysis of the pottery from any excavation is the defini- tion of the pottery features characteristic of each chronological phase. Inevitably, some features will be ubiquitous but will occur in many phases, and so they will be relatively useless as a chronological indi- cator. The methodology used in this study is designed to trace the frequency of some of these common features, which will itself become a valid chronologi- cal indicator. The more common a chronologically significant feature is the more use it will be to the excavator in dating the site. Equally inevitable, some features which occur only in one specific phase, and are thus chronologically significant, will be so rare that they will appear in only one locus in a thousand. These features, such as the pillar-handle jar or the handle base, are character- istic of the Iron Age. They should not be ignored, but neither should they be emphasized in discussions of the pottery of a period, as a feature which occurs only rarely perhaps cannot be truly characteristic of anything. At Qiri, the main area of excavation was Area D, and the pottery from this area forms the main evi- dence for the analysis presented here. The method- ological decision to save all the rims excavated was taken only after the 1975 season had been completed, so the pottery from Areas A, B, C and E is composed only of the standard "representative sample." Areas F to H were excavated using the new methodology, but all the areas except for Area D were too small to provide an adequate sample size. The methodology on which this study is based was still under development and testing during the 1976 season at Qiri. During that season, all the rims were classified in the field but were not stored for later study, as became the practice in later seasons. For this reason, as the YRP typology was refined and the areas of study were expanded to include decoration and other features, only the saved rims could be reclassified. For the most part, the changes in the typology did not result in an inability to correctly reclassify the discarded rims. However, cooking pots in particular are a problem, as the initial version of the typology ignored an important distinction. How- ever, while the evidence from the other YRP sites allows this oversight to be corrected, the problem serves as a warning. Typologies continually evolve, and all the evidence should be saved until the study is finished. PRIMARY FORMS Co o k i n g Pots (F i gs. 33-34, 48) These vessels are traditionally identified as cooking pots for the following reasons: The pots are com- monly soot-covered and are frequently excavated in association with cooking installations. They have a distinctive quartz tempering which may have helped the clay resist the effects of repeated expansion and contraction due to changes of temperature. The typical Iron Age cooking vessel has a wide mouth, carinated body and rounded base. The neck and rim are wheelmade, while the body is handmade in a form or mould.17 A second, less common type of cooking vessel has a narrow mouth, a high neck, and 17. Franken (above, n. 3), p. 121. 181</page><page sequence="193">an oval body. The vessel usually has one or two loop handles drawn from the mouth. In the YRP rim typology this form is called "cooking jar" to distin- guish it from the standard cooking pot. Some studies have included the cooking jar with storage jars.18 However, like the cooking pots, the cooking jars are usually soot-covered and have quartz tempering, characteristics lacking in storage jars.19 As the general body profile of both these classes of cooking vessels is relatively constant, and the vessels are almost never decorated, variations in rim form have long been the main criterion for distinguishing types. It seems that in Israel, handles - while stand- ard on cooking jars - were not common on cooking pots.20 In contrast, at Judean sites, such as Arad,21 handles were common on most types of cooking vessels. Stratigraphie Evidence Altogether 1033 cooking pot rims were excavated at Qiri. Area D had 344 cooking pot rims with an estab- lished stratigraphie context; they form the basis for this analysis. As noted above, during the 1976 season some of the excavated rims were discarded after classifica- tion. In the preliminary YRP typology, later aban- doned as it was found to be inadequate, CP I and II were combined. In some phases the percentage of discarded CP I/II rims is high enough to make it impossible to know which group was more frequent. However, the evidence from Yoqne'am helps to resolve the question of the overall relationship of these forms. Stratum IX Three of the cooking pot groups appear in this stra- tum. CP I had the highest frequency, followed by CP II. Even if all the discarded rims were assigned to CP II, CP I would still be more numerous. CP IV is the only other rim type present above the level of signifi- cance in this phase. Stratum VIII The discarded rims make it difficult to judge the actual profile of this phase. CP II occurs more fre- quently than CP I in raw numbers. However, the difference between the two could easily be swamped by the discards. As CP I is clearly more frequent than CP II in Strata IX and VII, as well as at Yoqne'am in similar contexts,22 the raw numbers of this phase are misleading. CP I was almost certainly more frequent than CP II in this stratum. Again, CP IV is the only other type present. Stratum VII In this stratum CP I is again the most frequent, although CP II almost approaches it in number. CP IV is the only other type with more than 5% of the sample. CP III rims appear for the first time in small quantity. (As they occur in the earliest phase of the stratum, they may be intrusive.) Stratum V/VI CP I is still the most frequent, but CP III appears in this phase in quantity. CP II is now in third place, although the discards should be kept in mind. The only other type present is CP IV. The stratigraphie evidence from Qiri parallels that from the other YRP sites. The development of cook- ing pots during the Iron Age can be traced. CP I is the dominant form in Iron I, and as the period progresses this form gradually declines in frequency. CP III appears during Iron II, and the increase in frequency of this form is the best chronological indicator of that period. Both CP II and CP IV occur at fairly constant levels throughout the entire Iron Age. Ceramic Evidence Cooking Pot I: Triangular Rims (Fig. 33) The chronological position of CP I is clear. This group is the predominant form during the early part of the Iron Age; declines as the period progresses but occurs in fair quantities up to the end of the eighth century. This form is a clear indicator of the early Iron Age. The YRP typology divides CP I into three types. The main distinguishing feature is the direction in which the lower part of the rim slants. In Type I/a the lower part of the rim overlaps the base line, while the lower edge of Type I/b rims does not. The Type I/c 18. Amiran (above, n. 1), p. 238. 19. Although a third form, the baking tray, seems to have had a role in the Iron Age kitchen, it will be discussed separately, as the body profile of the tray precludes a use similar to that of the vessels pre- sented here. 20.

Hunt (above, n. 16). 182</page><page sequence="194">rim is distinguished by its massive size. Parallel types were defined for CP II. The three types have no chronological or regional significance, as the distribution of each echoes that of the group as a whole. The direction in which the rim slants is the result of minor adjustments by the potter when making the vessel. Several of the pots from the YRP sites had rims that were overlapping for part of their circumference and horizontal for the rest. The only noteworthy feature is the frequency of Type I/c in Stratum V/VI at Qiri. The preponder- ance of this type at such a late date is surprising, since the distribution of this type at Yoqne'am is no differ- ent from that of the other types.23 Cooking Pot II: Pinched Rims (Fig. 33) CP II is present in approximately equal quantities in all the Iron Age phases at the YRP sites. The profile of this group shows a slight tendency for increased frequency as the Iron Age progresses. However, these fluctuations are not significant. Cooking pots with this type of rim were produced from the 12th to the 8th centuries BC, with only relatively small changes in frequency. Like CP I, CP II was divided into three types. Our remarks concerning the chronology and regional importance of the CP I types apply equally to those of CP II (see above, n. 23). Cooking Pot III: Modelled Rims (Fig. 34) CP III is the clearest chronological indicator among the cooking pots. It is possible to trace the step by step increase of CP III during Iron II from the sub- phases of the strata at the YRP sites, accompanied by a decline of CP I. Cooking Pot IV: Cooking Jars (Fig. 34) CP IV occurs in virtually every phase of the Iron Age at the YRP sites. While there are slight variations in its popularity, it usually averages about 7% of the cooking vessel rims. As the distribution of this type is uniform, this group is not a good chronological indicator. The continuing popularity of this jar can best be explained by noting its form and function. While most cooking was done in standard open vessels, some apparently required closed cooking vessels with handles, as the CP IV rims occur in loci along with the standard cooking pot rims. Cooking Pot Varia (Fig. 34) None of the individual rim types in this group occurs in any stratigraphie phase at a frequency of more than 5%. Most appear in very small quantities. With two exceptions, these types were included in the study simply to ensure that the sample was complete and to serve as a reference for other sites where these types may be more important. By means of the exceptions, CP Varia D and E, we investigated the suggestion by H. Franken, based on his work at Deir 'Alia, that this was an as yet unrecog- nized important type of Iron Age cooking pot rims.24 However, only 42 rims belonging to this group occurred among the more than 3500 Iron Age cook- ing pot rims excavated at the YRP sites. Based upon this evidence, it is clear that the refolding of cooking pot rims was simply an unimportant variation of the standard rim types. Comparison with Other Studies R. Amiran's discussion of Iron Age cooking pots is concise and straightforward.25 Rim type is the main criterion used, as body profile is uniformly carinated and the vessels are undecorated. She divided the ves- sels into northern and southern types, based upon their occurrence at excavated sites throughout Palestine. The following table shows the relationship of the YRP types to Amiran's classification. AMIRAN YRP Iron I North CP Il/a Iron I South CP I Iron II A-B North CP Il/b Iron II A-B South CP I Iron II C CP III The evidence presented in this study indicates that Amiran's account of the development of cooking pots should be partially reevaluated and that the north/south distinctions suggested by Amiran are 23. Ibid. Due to the problem of the discarded sherds, the frequency profiles for CP I and CP II at Qiri are not as accurate as those from Yoqne'am. The more com- plete Yoqne'am evidence allows the Qiri results to be correctly interpreted. 24. Franken (above, n. 3), p. 120. 25. Amiran (above, n. 1), pp. 227-232. 183</page><page sequence="195">not valid, as CP I - not CP II - is the most popular form at the three YRP northern sites. Furthermore, Amiran's Plates 75 and 76 suggest that in Iron I in the north, the rim type called "over- lapping" (CP I and II, Type a) was preferred, while in Iron II A-B the "horizontal" rim (CP I and II, Type b) was more frequent. The YRP pottery evidence shows that the frequency of these two types is not chronologically significant. Rim type is not the only feature of interest for cooking pots. A number of the cooking pot rims from the YRP sites have letters or other signs incised on them before firing (see below, Chap. 8). In all, 73 incised rims were found at the YRP sites. Yoqne'am is the only YRP site which provides good evidence for the dating of the incised rims. At Qashish the sample is too small, while at Qiri only two of the rims could be assigned to a phase. At Yoqne'am these rims occur mainly in Stratum 1 1 and early in Stratum 10. Twelve of the eighteen incised rims that could be assigned to a phase came from these levels. The other six rims were scattered in several phases. While these rims form only a small part of the sample, they are a good chronological tool for distinguishing the early part of Iron II. The incised signs occur most frequently on CP I rims, mainly on Types I/c and I/b. A small portion of the incised signs occurs on CP II rims.

The high frequency of rims with handles preserved for CP IV, for example, indicates that these vessels normally had handles. As this form occurs uniformly throughout the Iron Age, no chronological significance can be attached to these handles. The situation is more complicated for the standard cooking pots. As Amiran has observed, handles are 26. See n. 20. 184 not common on this type of vessel.26 They are very rare on CP I, the early type, and are much more common on CP III, the late type. This increase in frequency may be due more to the form of the vessels than to any other factor. Whereas CP I and II have ledges of a sort built into the rim, which would make lifting the pots easier, CP III rims often have a more rounded profile that would have been harder to grasp. While in the north handles became more frequent, in the southern sites they were always common, and according to the evidence for every type two was the standard number. The main development of cooking pots at the YRP sites is thus clear. CP I is a good indicator of the early part of the Iron Age. CP III appears in quantity in the latter stages of the period. CP II is present in quantity throughout the Iron Age and is thus not a useful indicator of date. CP IV also occurs in smaller numbers throughout the period. The other types in the typology do not appear in significant quantities.

A storage jar is defined as a container for the storage and/or transport of solid or liquid mate- rials. The standard Iron Age storage jar had a narrow mouth and two or more handles, which were usually placed on the body or shoulder of the vessel. The body profile was usually oval or carinated. The base was usually rounded or pointed. This general form</page><page sequence="196">Fig. 48. Frequency of cooking pot rim types, by stratum.

This basic storage jar was supplemented by a number of variant forms, such as pithoi and hole-mouth jars. Aside from rim type, the only consistently impor- tant feature of storage jars is body profile. Few of the storage jar rims excavated from Qiri or the other YRP sites could be clearly associated with enough body sherds to determine the body profile. In all, the body profile of less than thirty of the more than 4100 S J I and II rims excavated was preserved. Most previous studies have considered body profile to be the single most significant feature of storage jars. The results of this study indicate that rims are also a valid criterion. The rim of some wide-necked jugs is identical to that of some types of high-necked storage jars. For very small undecorated sherds, it was not possible to determine beyond doubt which form the rim belonged to. For the sake of consistency these ques- tionable rims were uniformly classified as storage jars. While storage jars may be somewhat over repre- sented as a result of this practice, the rim types are not, for it is only the function of the vessel, and not the type of rim, that is in question. Stratigraphie Evidence A total of 987 storage jar rims were found in all areas at Qiri. This discussion covers the pottery from Area D, the only area for which all rims were classified. Area D yielded 376 storage jar rims with an estab- lished stratigraphie context. Stratum IX The three main types, SJ I/a, I/b and I/c, account for most of the sample, of which SJ I/c is by far the most frequent (at Yoqne'am it was the least common). The single Late Bronze Canaanite jar indicates that some Late Bronze influence was still present. The only complete form has an oval body. Stratum VIII The Stratum IX rim forms continue to occur above the level of significance, with the addition of SJ V/c. S J I/a is here the most frequent of the three main rim types, by a small margin. No complete body profiles were preserved. Stratum VII The profile of this phase is similar to that of Stratum VIII, but SJ 1/b is now the most popular of the three main types. The two vessels for which the body pro- file could be determined are sausage-shaped. Stratum V/VI In this stratum the three main types still comprise most of the sample. SJ I/a and I/b occur in almost identical quantities. SJ V/b, the hole-mouth jar, appears for the only time in quantity, and SJ V/c again rises above the level of significance. No com- plete body profiles were preserved. The stratigraphie evidence from Qiri parallels that from the YRP sites. Throughout the period, the three rim types of SJ I account for most of the sample. During the earliest phase of Iron I at Qiri, SJ I/c is the most frequent form. During the tenth century, SJ I/a became the most frequent. During the course of the later part of Iron II, SJ V/b and V/d appear, serving as the most useful chronological indicators for the storage jars of the Iron Age. Ceramic Evidence Storage Jar I: High-necked (Figs. 34-35) This group includes the majority of the SJ rims exca- vated at Qiri. Each of the three rim types occurs in all phases of the Iron Age, but since the frequency of the rim types changes over time, some chronological dis- tinctions can be made. SJ I remained the dominant group throughout the Iron Age, but during the eighth century new forms, such as the hole-mouth jar and the rectangular rim storage jar, began to occur in quantity and caused a reduction in the frequency of SJ I. Storage Jar I/a: Simple (Fig. 34) The frequency of simple rim storage jars peaks in the eleventh-tenth centuries at both Qiri and Yoq- ne'am.28 During Early Iron I and the latter part of Iron II the form occurs in smaller quantities, but almost never accounts for less than 20% of the sam- 27.

Paired with SJ I/b, this form is a good indicator of the first half of Iron II. Rims of this type are decorated about 1% of the time. Both red slip and red painted bands occur, but most of the vessels of this type are definitely not decorated. Storage Jar I/b: Thickened, without Ridge (Fig. 35) SJ I/b reaches its peak in frequency slightly later in Iron II than SJ I/a. At both Qiri and Yoqne'am this form is at its highest frequency during the ninth century.29 Together, high frequencies of S J I/b and I/a are a good indicator for the eleventh to ninth centuries. The rims of this type are almost never decorated. Storage Jar I/c : Thickened, with Ridge (Fig. 35) The stratigraphy at Qiri reveals this form to be a good chronological indicator for Iron I. Its popularity in Iron I was unexpected, however the frequency profile for this type at Qiri is dramatic evidence for its rapid decline as early as the tenth century. During Iron II, both SJ I/a and I/b were more common than this rim type. Within this type are a number of varieties. The Iron I type has a rim with an oval profile and a ridge near the rim.30 The body profile is usually oval. The Iron II type has the ridge lower on the neck, and a wide variety of thickened rims.31 The body profile is usu- ally sharp-shouldered. This type seems to be very common at Hazor from Stratum VIII on. However, none of the varieties of this type is especially frequent at the YRP sites after the end of Iron I. Though it occurs during Iron II, SJ I/a, I/b, V/b and V/d are all better chronological indicators. The production of storage jars may have had more of a regional character during the Iron Age than was previously realized. Already the use of the LMLK stamped jars has been seen to be virtually restricted to Judea, and S. Geva has recently traced a type of storage jar common at Hazor to Tyre and Cyprus.32 Several of the typical Hazor rim types are not fre- quent at Qiri or at the other YRP sites. As storage jars were intended for transport and trade as well as for storage, it is possible that the differences between the YRP sites and sites such as Hazor reflect regional differences in pottery production. The rims of this type are decorated about 1% of the time, usually with a red slip. Storage Jar V/a : Canaanite Jar (Fig. 35) This form is a continuation of Late Bronze influence into the Iron Age. These jars occur in small quantities in the earliest phases at Qiri and are an indication of the early date of Iron Age occupation at the site.33 Storage Jar V/b: Hole-Mouth (Fig. 35) This form is a good indicator for the latter part of Iron II. It is absent from the earlier phases at Qiri and increases gradually during Iron II at both Qiri and Yoqne'am. This rim type is more frequent in the late Iron II phases at Yoqne'am.34 An interesting feature of the rims is the incised lines appearing on some of the hole-mouth rims from Yoqne'am. This surface finish was not found at Qiri. The incised lines are typical of Judean vessels and the absence of this Judean feature at Qiri may be an indication of the village's limited contacts. Hole-mouth storage jars are generally considered typical of southern and not northern sites. However, the jars are too frequent at Qiri and Yoqne'am to support an assumption that all of the jars were imported. The low frequency of the typically Judean incised rims is further support of the concept that most of the hole-mouth jars were locally made and not imported. This form should be included in the corpus of northern storage jars. Storage Jar V/c: Globular (Fig. 35) This form is absent from the earliest Iron Age levels at Qiri. In general, it is never very common and is thus of no chronological importance. The vessel is never decorated. Storage Jar V/d: Rectangular (Fig. 36) The stratigraphie evidence clearly shows that this form, along with SJ V/b, is characteristic of the latter part of the Iron Age. At Qiri rims of this type occur only in the latest Iron Age contexts, and then only in small quantity. At Yoqne'am the form appears in the ninth century and increases above the level of signifi- cance in the eighth century.35 This form is not decorated. 29. Ibid. 30. Taanach I, Fig. 10:5. 31.

Geva has recently suggested36 that this form was made especially for export. The modifications include thinner walls and base to reduce weight, and the adoption of standard sizes. Examples of these jars have been found at Tyre and Cyprus. If this type was produced mainly in the region of Hazor, its lower frequency at Qiri could be another indication of the village's reduced contacts, as with the incised hole- mouth jars. Storage Jar Varia (Fig. 36) The only form in this group is the simple, low-necked type of storage jar. This form is absent from the earliest phase at Qiri and never occurs in quantity in any phase at any of the YRP sites. For this reason, it cannot be readily used as a chronological indicator. Very rarely decorated, this form was merely a minor variation among the various storage jar rim types. However, this form is generally considered to have been an important part of the Iron Age corpus. Since it is a distinctive rim type which is not easily confused with other types, more emphasis may have been placed on it than its numbers warrant. Comparison with Other Studies Storage jars pose both an opportunity and a chal- lenge to any classification system. Though a large quantity of storage jar sherds occur, it is difficult to connect rim type and body profile. The YRP typol- ogy recognized that rim type alone is not diagnostic; therefore neck type was integrated into their basic definition. Body profile was accommodated by creat- ing separate groups for each of the body forms. If this study had used standard presence/absence methodology, combined with a reliance on body pro- file, the number of rims used for analysis would have been 30 rather than 4100. As all three S J I rim types occur throughout the Iron Age, it is easy to under- stand the traditional emphasis on body profile over rim type. However, body profile is also not an ideal indica- tor. Ovoid and carinated profiles appear side by side throughout the period. If the only evidence available was vessels with a complete body profile, the ten stratified vessels at the YRP sites could provide little information. It would have appeared that storage jars were neither very frequent nor important.

The evidence indicates that SJ I/c is clearly a good chronological indicator, and that the other two SJ I types are also significant over the course of the Iron Age. The gradual growth in frequency of SJ V/b and V/d during the latter part of the Iron Age can be traced by our method in a manner which would otherwise be impossible in a presence/absence system. As regards decoration, Amiran has observed that the decoration of some storage jars reflects Late Bronze traditions.37 Such decoration appeared on none of the storage jar rims excavated by the YRP. Decoration was very rare38 and consisted of simple painted bands or slip and/or burnishing. Decoration on storage jars is apparently not as frequent as Ami- ran's plates suggest,39 so perhaps once again deco- rated vessels are over-represented in the publications. Bowls (Figs. 37-38, 50) During the Iron Age, bowls (B) were the common ceramic tableware, combining the functions of mod- ern bowls, cups and plates.40 The large number of 36. Geva (above, n. 32). The thin walls and base of this type of storage jar may have made transport easier, but the long-term trend for trading vessels was clearly towards thick bases and walls to reduce breakage. This factor may account for the relative unpopularity of the form at the YRP sites. 5 /. Amiran (above, n. 1), pp. 243 and 24!&gt;. 38. Less than 1% of the rims was decorated. 39. Amiran (above, n. 1), pp. 233-248. 40. Bowls seem to have been the standard drinking ves- sels of the period. It is possible that wooden drinking vessels, or vessels made from other perishable mate- rials, were used but have not survived in the archaeo- logical record. 189</page><page sequence="201">bowl rims excavated by the YRP is an indication of their importance. For this study, a bowl is defined as an open vessel of relatively small size,41 which was used mainly to hold and serve solids and liquids. Bowls with an unwidened rim (Types a-c) would have been much more effective for drinking than the bowls with thickened rims (Types d-f). The YRP typology includes a number of special- ized forms within the general category of bowls. B IV/ c, the plate, is distinguished by its splayed profile. Bowl Varia D, the platter, is a shallow vessel with a wide diameter. This vessel, too, is a sub-type of the bowl, and its body profile distinguishes it from the standard bowls. The classification system used by the YRP typol- ogy for bowls is based on rim type, but also incorpo- rates body profile. The latter has generally been also considered an important chronological indicator. Separate typological groups were established for rounded and carinated bowls, the two major bowl forms. A third group includes those rims for which the body profile was not preserved. Using this system, it has been possible to treat rim type and body profile as independent variables. Another significant feature of bowls is decoration, which follows the standard Iron Age pattern. Both painted bands and red slip, with or without burnish- ing, occur. Decoration also has been generally thought to have chronological significance. Stratigraphie Evidence Some general observations will also help to clarify the results of this study. Bowl Groups I, II and III will be combined when rim types a-f are discussed. The fre- quency profiles of the rim types are similar for the three groups. Throughout the Iron Age two specific sets of rim types always occur above the level of significance. The first set consists of rim types a, b and c,42 which together can be classified as unwidened rims. The other set consists of rim types d, e and f, which together can be classified as widened rims. The probable uses of the bowls of each set reinforce this division of the six basic rim types. The variation of frequency of these two sets of rims will also be examined for chronological significance. More than 900 bowl rims were found in all areas at Qiri. This discussion covers the pottery from Area D, the only area for which all rims were classified. Area D produced 336 bowl rims with an established strati- graphic context. The original YRP typology made no distinction between the various types of thickened rims, so rim types d-f were included in a single cate- gory. In any case, the evidence from Yoqne'am indi- cates that the individual widened rims were not chronologically significant.43 Stfatum IX The profile of Stratum IX presents several unique features. Simple rim bowls are dominant. Only rim types B I/c and B IV/aand IV/calso occur above the level of significance. None of the widened rim types is important. Rounded bowls are more frequent than carinated bowls. Stratum VIII The Stratum VIII profile contains the same basic elements as Stratum IX, with the exception of B I V/a. Simple rims comprise half the sample, and only B IV/c also occurs in quantity. The rim types which occur just above the level of significance are not important due to the size of the sample. Unwidened rim bowls are more frequent than widened rim bowls. Carinated bowls are more frequent than rounded bowls. Stratum VII The frequency of simple rim bowls takes a sharp decline in Stratum VII. The appearance of plates is another key feature of the stratum. The other rim types all occur in modest quantities and none repre- sents more than 10% of the sample. However, taken together, widened rim bowls are increasing markedly in frequency while unwidened rims are decreasing. Carinated bowls are more frequent than rounded bowls. Stratum V/VI The decline of the simple rim bowls continues in this phase. The large quantity of discarded rims makes it impossible to determine which of the thickened rims was the most popular, but the evidence from Yoq- ne'am suggests that the distribution was approxi- mately equal. The decline in frequency of the unwidened bowls continues while that of widened bowls continues to rise. Carinated bowls are more frequent than rounded bowls. 41. Large bowls are classified as craters. 42. B IV/c can also be included in the set of unwidened bowls, as it has a simple rim like Bowl Rim a. 43. Hunt (above, n. 16). 190</page><page sequence="202">According to the evidence from the YRP sites, simple rim bowls are the most frequent form during Iron I. As the Iron Age progresses, rectangular and bevelled rim bowls increase in frequency and that of simple rim bowls declines. The set of widened rims increases markedly during Iron II, although individ- ually none of the types is a good chronological indica- tor. B IV/c is characteristic of the early part of the Iron Age, B IV/b of the latter part of the period. Ceramic Evidence Bowl Rim a: Simple (Fig. 37) Simple rim bowls are the most common rim type of the early Iron Age. From the tenth century on, this form declines in frequency, as types b and c become the standard unwidened rims. When dominant, this rim type is a good chronological indicator for Iron I. Bowl Rim b: Rectangular (Fig. 37) As the Iron Age progresses, the frequency of this form increases. The profile of this form is paralleled by that of rim type c, and together these two types replace rim type a as the most important unwidened rim types. Yoqne'am provides the best evidence for this phenomenon.44 The occurrence of tłiis form in quantity is a good indicator for the latter part of the Iron Age. Bowl Rim c: Bevelled (Fig. 37) The significance of this form is much like that of rim type b. The occurrence of this form in quantity is a good indicator for the latter part of the Iron Age.45 Bowl Rims d, e, and f (Fig. 37) The original version of the YRP typology did not distinguish between these three rim types. While the discarded rims could not be reclassified, the evidence from Yoqne'am indicates that the frequency of these three types was very similar and that none was indi- vidually of chronological significance. Unwidened and Widened Bowls (Fig. 37) In the Early Iron Age, widened rim bowls (rim types d, e and 0 are not frequent. As the Iron Age pro- gresses, this set of rims increases in frequency while unwidened bowls (rim types a, b and c) decrease in frequency. Thus, the relationship of the two sets of rims to one another is a good chronological indicator. Bowl IV/a: Spherical (Fig. 38) This infrequent and insignificant bowl form is almost completely absent from the pottery at Yoqne'am and is neither frequent nor indicative at Qiri. Bowl IV/b: Plate (Fig. 38) At Qiri, the plate was never a major feature of the assemblage. However, the evidence from Yoqne'am, which is more reliable for the latter part of the Iron Age, indicates that the plate has one of the sharpest frequency profiles of any type considered in this study.46 This vessel is very rare until the middle of Iron II, when it becomes one of the more important forms. This form is a good chronological indicator. Bowl IV/c: Bell-Shaped (Fig. 38) The bell-shaped bowl is ultimately derived from the same Aegean source as the Philistine bell-shaped bowl. It was fairly common during Iron I and the tenth century at both Qiri and Yoqne'am and then virtually disappeared from the assemblage. This type is a key indicator for the early Iron Age, along with Bowl Rim a. Bowl Varia (Fig. 38) The various rim types included in this category almost never occur above the level of significance in any of the stratigraphie phases at the YRP sites. The evidence presented here indicates that the bowls of Iron I are characterized by simple rim and bell-shaped bowls. This pattern continues into the tenth century, but as Iron II progresses the widened rim, as well as the rectangular and bevelled rim bowls become increasingly common. At the same time, bell- shaped bowls almost disappear while the frequency of simple rim bowls declines sharply. 44. Ibid. 45. In terms of rim type, Bowl I/c and CH Ill/a are identical. As a chalice is simply a bowl with a high foot, an overlap between bowl and chalice rim type is hardly surprising. The relatively high frequency of Bowl I/c in Stratum IX at Qiri is another indication of the popularity of CH Ill/a in that period as, unless the joint is preserved, chalices usually cannot be distinguished from bowls. This particular question does not arise later in the Iron Age, as the bevelled rims of Stratum 10 at Yoqne'am generally occur on small thin-walled bowls, which are very different from the CH Ill/a vessel. 46.

Almost all the bowl rim types are present in all the stratigraphie phases at Qiri. A presence/absence study would have been unable to distinguish any change or development in bowl rim type during the Iron Age. Yet the frequencies at which simple, rectan- gular, and bevelled rim types occur are excellent chronological indicators, as is the general proportion of widened to unwidened bowls. Combined, these factors delineate a clear method for distinguishing the development of bowls during the Iron Age. As bowls are such a common form, a frequency study of their rims would clearly add precision to any strati- graphic study. Amiran's study of Iron Age pottery47 relies on decoration and body profile for the analysis of bowls. She makes subtle distinctions concerning the degree and placement of carination on the bowls. The sam- ple excavated by the YRP indicates not only that often the profile of the bowls is not preserved, but also that even when the profile is present, not enough of the complete vessel survives to determine the rela- tive placement of the carination. Except for Stratum IX at Qiri, carinated bowls are always more frequent than rounded bowls. The per- centage of unknown profiles is usually high, so the importance of this distribution remains in doubt. It is possible only to suggest that rounded bowls occurred in high frequency during the early part of the Iron Age. The study of body profile contributes little to the analysis of the YRP bowls, and previous conclu- sions based on this element should be viewed with caution. The study of the decoration of the bowls is complex due to the number of factors involved. As Amiran has noted, red slip decoration does not occur during the earliest phases of the Iron Age. Painted decoration is the most common technique up to the tenth century. One possible indication of urban/village variation is the difference in the decoration of bowls at Yoq- ne'am and Qiri. In raw numbers, the bowls are more frequently decorated at Yoqne'am than at Qiri. How- ever, if the evidence is considered stratum by stratum, there is an increase in the frequency of decoration as the period progresses. Yoqne'am has more late Iron pottery than Qiri, where Iron I levels were excavated. Thus, the clear difference observable in the raw numbers for the most part disappeared when single time periods were examined. The bowls at Yoqne'am are 5 % to 10% more frequently decorated than those at Qiri, in each period. However, since a number of the Qiri bowls were discarded this difference is not significant.48 Craters (F i g s. 38-39, 51) The term crater has been borrowed by Syro- Palestinian archaeologists of the classical world. The word is derived from the Greek Kpcmjp, which means mixing bowl, usually for wine.49 The word also appears with the variant spelling of krater. In Syro- Palestinian ceramic studies the term implies any open bowl-like vessel of relatively large size. Indeed, some ceramic studies prefer the term "deep bowl" for these vessels.50 While the distinction between craters and bowls is sometimes subjective, the problem is more semantic than functional. Craters were most proba- bly used to serve food, hold foodstuffs for temporary storage, and serve as mixing vessels for solids and liquids. As bowls served the same basic funcions, the difference is only one of scale. Past studies of Iron Age craters have stressed deco- ration, handles and body profile as the most signifi- cant chronological indicators. Craters were among the most elaborately decorated vessels of the Iron Age. While the typical red slip and burnish is the most common decoration, figurai decoration also occurs. Multiple handles have been suggested as a character- istic of the Iron Age, as are handle bases.51 Rim type has, at best, played a minor role in the classification of craters. This study concentrates on rims, and the results clearly show that rim type is an important criterion. Stratigraphie Evidence A total of 804 crater rims were found in all areas at Qiri. This discussion includes the pottery from Area D only, the sole area for which all rims were classi- fied. Area D has 262 crater rims with an established stratigraphie context. 47.

C I also occurs frequently and is characteristic of the phase. The only other type present above the level of significance is C IV/a. Stratum VIII C II is now clearly the dominant rim type. The fre- quency of C I has decreased. The only other type present in significant quantity is C IV/a. For the first time several C III rims appear. Stratum VII In this stratum C II retains its dominance. C I reaches a higher level of frequency. C III appears in signifi- cant quantities for the first time. None of the other types appears in quantity. Stratum V/VI Though C II is still the most frequent rim type in this phase, C II replaces C I as second in quantity. C IV/a again appears in significant quantities. In summary, the stratigraphie evidence from Qiri parallels that from the YRP sites. C II is the dominant early form. C III appears as the Iron Age progresses, but is not as frequent as in the later phases at Yoq- ne'am. C I seems to be a good chronological indicator for the early Iron Age. From the earliest part of the period, a new handleless crater is the most frequent form. While C IV, the survival of the Late Bronze crater tradition, is present, it is not very common. The real change during the period is the introduction and increase in frequency of C III. This form is the chronological indicator for the later part of the Iron Age. Ceramic Evidence Crater I: Circular Rim (Fig. 38) The stratigraphy from Qiri shows that this form is a good chronological indicator for Iron I. C I is not the most frequent Iron I form, but its profile shows a definite peak during Stratum IX; by the tenth century it was in decline. The form is never very frequent in any of the later Iron II levels at Yoqne'am, so its relative popularity at Qiri is all the more marked. For the first time it is possible to note that the crater forms at the YRP sites make a clear and deci- sive break with earlier Late Bronze crater traditions. C I never had handles and was only rarely decorated. Like C II and III, it is a distinct break from the handled, decorated craters of Late Bronze II. Crater II: Profiled Rim (Figs. 38-39) During the greater part of the Iron Age this was the dominant crater form at the YRP sites. Only in the last part of the eighth century was it surpassed in frequency. The decline was so gradual that it is diffi- cult to use C II as a chronological guide. C I and III have much more dramatic profiles. The form of C II corresponds in general to that of the open cooking pots. However, the craters lack the quartz tempering of the cooking pot clay and they have ring or disk bases rather than rounded ones. Within the group, Type b is the most frequent and also the most frequently decorated. About 18% of the rims of Type b were decorated, compared with less than 4% of the rims of Types a and c. This difference may indicate that decoration was deliberately made more frequently on the most popular model. The decoration is the typical Iron Age red slip and bur- nishing on the interior and/or exterior of the vessel. Of the more than 400 rims of these types, only one had a handle. The significance of these craters is more than chro- nological. Along with C I, these vessels are the main- stream crater tradition for the Iron Age. The break with the Late Bronze is clear from the earliest occupa- tion at Qiri. Taken together, these new forms usually account for more than 75% of the crater rims excavated. Crater III: Sloped Rim (Fig. 39) This vessel is the characteristic crater of the late Iron Age at the YRP sites and is an excellent chronological indicator. At Yoqne'am it also continues into a later phase of the period.52 This crater generally follows in the tradition of the typical Iron Age craters already discussed, although handles are more frequent (they are preserved on more than 10% of the rims); two handles were a standard feature. Decoration of a red slip and/or burnishing or painted bands also appear on these vessels. C III is not derived from the Late Bronze craters. The decoration is firmly within the Iron Age tradi- tion. This crater is the final stage of the development of an independent Iron Age crater. 52. Hunt (above, n. 16). 194</page><page sequence="206">Crater IV: Ledged Rim (Fig. 39) C IV is a descendant of the traditional Late Bronze crater. Yet, even during the earliest stages of Iron Age occupation at Qiri, this group was a minor part of the sample. Its appearance is no doubt related to a low level continuing Late Bronze influence which was not, however, a dominant factor shaping the craters of the early Iron Age. The presence of this form throughout the Iron Age at the YRP sites indicates that Late Bronze influence alone cannot explain its use as late as the eighth century. C IV provided a functional alternative to the standard undecorated and handleless new style of crater, and so continued in use for reasons that are functional and practical rather than cultural. Decoration is frequent in this group, as it was applied to more than 30% of the rims. Elaborate painted decoration, while not typical, is certainly more frequent than on the other forms and harks back to the Late Bronze traditions. The standard Iron Age slip rarely appears on this form. Two handles occur on more than 17% of the rims of this form. Multiple-handled craters also appear, but only as isolated cases. Multiple handles are a sign of the early Iron Age but they are not frequent enough to be considered typical or characteristic. Of the two types which comprise this group, Type a is clearly dominant. Both types occur in relatively minor quantities through the Iron Age. Crater V: Simple Rim (Fig. 39) In terms of quantity, this group is not very significant at the YRP sites. The form is related to Bichrome ware, as the simple rim crater is one of the typical forms of that style. In some cases the rims in this group are not classified as Bichrome ware only because so little of the vessel was preserved that the telltale decoration did not survive. As some of the rims were decorated with the standard red slip, the form has entered the standard decorative repertoire. This vessel sometimes had handles. The only time the form occurs above the 5% level of significance is during Stratum 10C (tenth century) at Yoqne'am. Bichrome ware dates to the same period. At Qiri not enough of these rims were found in Area D for accu- rate analysis. Crater Varia (Fig. 39) Only a single rim type of this group occurs in small quantities, and only at Yoqne'am; these vessels may be imports. Comparison with Other Studies Amiran's presentation of the craters of the Iron Age concentrates on body profile, handles and decora- tion.'3 Rim type is not given importance, except for a type Amiran describes as "thickened inwards and outwards/' This type corresponds to the YRP crater IV. She remarks that this became one of the charac- teristic features of Israelite pottery.54 Amiran observes that the crater tradition in Iron I is heavily dependent on Canaanite tradition for deco- ration and body profile, and that many craters have multiple handles." She defines six types of craters in existence during early Iron II, most of which corre- spond to the YRP C IV. Only one type has no han- dles, and it often has a loop-handle base. The same six types are said to continue during later Iron II, with the addition of slip and burnishing. Bar handles also become important. The only new type is a crater with a simple rim and painted decoration.56 These observations do not accurately describe the craters excavated at the YRP sites. From the very start of the Iron Age a strong independent tradition existed, typified by the handleless, undecorated C I and II. The rim that Amiran defines as Israelite occurs on the craters derived from the Late Bronze tradition and is not a new feature, as her own Late Bronze crater plate shows.57 Neither are the Iron II types suggested by Amiran any closer to the YRP pottery. The chronologically important forms are lumped into one type which is said to have a loop-handle base. Such bases are extremely rare at the YRP sites. Slip and burnishing is not a feature of Iron IIC, as this style is already established by the tenth century. Bar handles are also rare, and when loop handles do occur two is the standard number. Multiple handles are so rare that they cannot be considered characteristic. The evidence from the YRP does not add much new information to what is already known about body profile. The major change is one of emphasis. The necked craters and those with sharp carination 53. Amiran (above, n. 1). 54. Ibid., p. 216. 55. Ibid ., p. 216. 56. Ibid., p. 217. 57.

These "new" features of the YRP craters can best be explained by reviewing the material on which Amiran had to rely. For the most part, archaeologists have a bias for decorated pottery both when repre- sentative samples are saved in the field and, more importantly, when selected sherds are published. In publications of pottery plates preference thus is given to the most attractive and impressive finds. Plain rough ware tends to be ignored. The typical Iron Age crater had to compete with a small minority of elabo- rately decorated vessels and was simply not published in quantities that reflect its true share of the sample. Recent studies of Iron Age craters have tended to give more prominence to plain vessels. A typical example is E. Stern's publication of the pottery from Tel Mevorakh.58 He notes that some craters had a form similar to that of cooking pots, but suggests that they also had rounded bases.59 Stern follows Amiran in the division of craters into handled and handleless classes. He makes no observation on the frequency of either type, and notes that there seems to be little development between craters of Iron I and early Iron II.60 Once again, these conclusions are not as com- plete as those that the methodology of this study has made possible. It is particularly unfortunate that these plain ves- sels have been ignored. These forms are not only characteristic; they are also useful chronological tools, since their development may be easily traced. One possible indication of urban/village variation is the difference in the decoration of craters at Yoq- ne'am and Qiri. In raw numbers, the craters are decorated more frequently at Yoqne'am than at Qiri. However, if considered stratum by stratum, there is an increase in the frequency of decoration as the period progresses. Yoqne'am has more late Iron pot- tery than Qiri, where Iron I levels were excavated. Thus, the clear difference observable in the raw numbers for the most part disappeared when single time periods were examined. The craters at Yoq- ne'am are 5% to 10% more frequently decorated than those at Qiri, in each period. However, since a number of the Qiri craters were discarded, this differ- ence is not great enough to inspire much confidence in its significance. Jugs (F i g. 40) A jug, for the purpose of this study, is defined as a relatively large vessel used either to contain or serve liquids and solids. Jugs usually have a single handle drawn from the rim or neck of the vessel. Two basic groups of jugs were found at the YRP sites. J I has a wide neck and would have been useful mainly as tableware. The wide mouth would have made these vessels difficult to seal and thus not useful as contain- ers for trade. J II has a narrow mouth, which would have been much easier to seal. It could have been used for transporting medium-sized quantities of liquids, as well as serving as tableware. Both groups tend to have ring or disc bases and were decorated in the red slip or painted styles. The YRP typology includes jugs as one of the five primary vessels. Traditionally, jugs have been consid- ered one of the more important components of the Iron Age ceramic assemblage. However, they account for only about 4% of the rims excavated at the three YRP sites and occur in much smaller quanti- ties than the other four vessels included among the primary forms. 58. Mevorakh, pp. 50, 69. 59. Ibid., p. 50. 60. Ibid., p. 69. 197</page><page sequence="209">Accordingly, the statistical standards applied to the other primary forms cannot be used in this section of the study. Even when the stratigraphie unit of analysis is the stratum rather than the phase, the sample size is still not large enough for accurate analysis. The possibility of confusing some storage jar and jug rim sherds, as noted above in the discussion of storage jars, may have resulted in a somewhat lower frequency of J I than had actually existed. However the frequency of such doubtful sherds is not high enough to greatly alter the proportion of J I in the sample. The frequency of J II is not affected by this problem of classification. The overall distribution at Qiri is similar to that at Yoqne'am, where the stratigraphie evidence shows that J I rims were dominant in all the Iron Age strata.61 Of the J II types, only J Il/a usually occurred above the level of significance. Given the sample sizes, some brief remarks must replace the usual ceramic analysis. The higher fre- quency of J I rims, especially given the possibility of confusion with storage jars, is an indication that the jugs were generally used as tableware. The assemblage of jugs from Qiri and the other YRP sites seems to differ from the assemblages at other sites in Palestine. The scarcity of J II rims, which cannot be confused with other forms, is remarkable. The decanter, a form considered by Amiran to be the most characteristic jug of the latter part of the Iron Age,62 is extremely rare at the YRP sites, as are other related jug forms. J II forms may have been a luxury ware, used to hold and transport relatively expensive liquids, such as perfumes or fine wine. The contents of this type of jug may not have been suitable for storage jars because of the expense. If so, the vessels would most likely be found in the dwellings of the upper social classes, and such buildings have not as yet been exca- vated at the YRP sites.63 In any case, given the low frequency of any type of jug at Qiri and the other YRP sites, the importance of the jug in the Iron Age should be reconsidered and should not be accepted as characteristic of a period. SECONDARY FORMS Chalices (Fig. 41) A chalice (CH) is defined as a bowl with an attached high base. Since a chalice is a variation of the basic bowl form, the two vessels share a number of rim types, and these were classified as bowls unless there was some evidence indicating that the vessel was a chalice. It is not clear whether the Iron Age chalices were regular drinking vessels64 or whether they had cultic uses as well. Some chalices are among the most elabo- rately decorated vessels of the period, a fact which highlights their importance. The presence of soot marks on some of the chalice bowls suggests that the vessels may have been used other than for drinking.65 The best indicator of the use of the chalices must be the context in which the vessels were found.66 At Qiri, 62 chalice rims were excavated. CH Il/a is the most frequent, followed by CH Ill/b. The stratig- raphy indicates that CH III is early, as these rims appear only in Strata IX and VIII. CH III seems to have gone out of use by the tenth century. The CH II 61. Hunt (above, n. 16). 62. Amiran (above, n. 1), p. 259. 63. It is also possible that J II was used mainly as a tomb gift, an alternative explanation for the absence of the vessels in the settlement deposits at the YRP sites. 64. Bowls seem to have been the standard drinking ves- sels of the period. 65. At Megiddo a chalice with a broken base was found in situ in a stand, a context similar to that in which incense burners have been excavated {Megiddo II, PI. 90:9). This may account for the soot marks on chali- ces similar to those found on incense burners. 66. A class of Iron Age vessels has traditionally been thought to have a cultic function. Incense burners, kernoi, stands, cups and saucers, double vessels, votive miniatures, and "pierced" vessels, as well as chalices, are all part of this "cultic" class. A cultic attribution has long been an archaeological catch-all for an unidentified object. However, these vessels have been excavated in contexts with horned altars at Megiddo and in sanctuaries at Arad, Qasile and Taanach. The situation is complicated by the fact that cultic structures in the Iron Age were not always architecturally distinguishable from non-cultic buildings. However, some general rules will help to resolve this problem. All the vessels considered here are very rare. If several occur together in a room or locus, it would seem reasonable that the area in which they were found had a cultic role, especially if altars or other non-ceramic cult objects occur there. Of these vessels, the chalice has the most obvious domestic utility. In an isolated context, the presence of a chalice should not be taken as proof of the cultic nature of a locus or building. However, the possible existence of a form of household cult should not be ignored. See above, pp. 86-90 and also Qasile I, Chap. 12 for an excellent summary of the problem. 198</page><page sequence="210">forms occur throughout the Iron Age strata at Qiri. This stratigraphie evidence points to a number of important new observations. First of all, CH III is a good chronological indicator for the early Iron Age, and the early peak in the frequency profile of Bowl Rim c at Qiri reinforces the distribution. The Qiri CH III rims are not decorated. Some of the examples from Yoqne'am are decorated with a red slip.67 Secondly, CH I is very rare and does not appear in Amiran's description of chalices.68 It may be a local regional variation. None of the rims of this form are decorated. CH II is the most frequent group, but as the rims occur in almost all phases in roughly equal frequen- cies, the form is not a good chronological indicator. CH Il/a is the most frequently decorated form. Red slip, as well as red and black paint, appears. Fig. 41:7 illustrates the most elegant example found in the Qiri excavations. Most of the chalices at Qiri are undecorated, though at Yoqne'am all the types, except CH I, are decorated. As the decoration of vessels increased as the Iron Age progressed, and most of the Yoqne'am examples are later than those from Qiri, no conclu- sions can be made concerning the differences between urban and village sites. Similar doubts surround the frequency of the chali- ces at the two sites. In terms of raw numbers, Qiri would seem to have a greater proportion of chalices than Yoqne'am. However, for the first season at Qiri, not all the rims were saved and a preference for chalices might be expected because of the novelty of the form. In addition, it is probable that in Stratum VIII the major building in Area D was a cultic struc- ture while the cultic area of Yoqne'am as yet remains unexcavated. The chalices defined by the YRP typology gener- ally correspond to Amiran's types. However, her classification system ignores rim type. The evidence presented here demonstrates that rim type provides an accurate and convenient way to classify chalices. Baking Trays (Fig. 41) Baking trays (BT) are convex disc-shaped vessels with a diameter about the same size as that of a modern frisbee. These trays are made from the same sort of quartz-tempered clay used for cooking pots. Most of the vessels are soot-covered. The upper, or convex, surface is often marked by incised circular lines separating bands of notches. The concave sur- face is nearly always plain.69 Baking trays are often ignored in pottery studies. Amiran does not include them in her survey of Iron Age pottery.70 This disc-like form is unique to the Iron Age, although other baking tray forms occur in the Late Bronze Age. Several excavation reports have published Iron Age baking trays, but no comprehen- sive study has been attempted. The function of the baking trays has not yet been established. The origin of the name is not clear; it seems to have developed in the field by consensus. Certainly the quartz-tempering and the soot suggest that the vessels had some contact with fire. The trays may have been used for baking, especially for pita- like bread; the notches would hold the dough in place.71 Considering the variety of cooking vessels avail- able to the Iron Age cook, the main element missing is a frying pan. When placed over a small fire or hot stones, the baking tray could have served as a surface for frying, although not a convenient one as any grease would have run into the fire. The rims of 41 baking trays were excavated at Qiri. BT/a and e are the two most frequent rim types, and in all areas BT/a occurred more frequently than BT/e. However, since the two types appear in all the Area D strata, as well as in the stratified phases from Yoqne'am,72 in roughly equal quantities, it is not possible to attach any significance to the overall profile. The stratigraphie evidence for baking trays shows that the vessels occurred throughout the Iron Age. The most frequent forms are also the simplest. Bak- ing trays, whatever their true function, were utilitar- ian vessels. Qiri has a greater proportion of baking trays in its assemblage than Yoqne'am. Though it is possible that these utilitarian vessels were more common at a village like Qiri than at Yoqne'am, the situation is not clear cut, as many of the Qiri baking trays were not excavated in the statistically more reliable Area D. 67. Hunt (above, n. 16). 68. Amiran (above, n. 1), pp. 213-215. 69. Some studies publish baking trays as if they were bowls, with the convex side down. I, along with most other scholars, consider the notched side as the upper surface of the vessel. 70. Amiran (above, n. 1). 71. If the trays were in fact used for baking, some should have been found in situ inside the ovens. They may have been better suited for an open fire. 72. Hunt (above, n. 16). 199</page><page sequence="211">The evidence in Area D does not support the raw numbers for the site as a whole. Baking trays cannot be used with confidence to shed light on the differen- ces between urban sites and villages. Pithoi (Fig. 36) Pithoi are defined in this study as large storage vessels for solids or liquids. Due to their large size and weight when full, it is unlikely that these vessels were used for trade. As Amiran has remarked,73 the primary use for pithoi was domestic storage. Pithoi first appear in the Palestinian ceramic corpus in the Late Bronze Age, and the Iron Age examples are generally derived from the Late Bronze tradition. Pithos a: Pithos (Fig. 36) Pithoi are not common at the YRP sites. This general type of pithos was found only at Yoqne'am. The stratigraphie evidence shows that the form occurred through the tenth century. The pithoi are not usually painted or slipped, but they display incised rope, circle or line decoration.74 Pithos b : Collared Rim (Fig. 36) The collared rim pithos (or storage jar) has had a long academic history since W. F. Albright first identified the form in the Tell el-Ful/Beth-El area.75 Albright believed that the vessel was not only a chronological indicator of Iron I, but also an ethnic indicator for the Israelite tribes. This hypothesis has focused a good deal of attention on the collared rim vessel. This jar was named for the ridge or "collar" at the base of the neck of the vessel. It is relatively large, and Amiran 76 has stated that the form developed from the Late Bronze pithoi. There are numerous variations in the shape of the thickened rim. The collared rim pithoi have a distinctive fabric of light grey, gritty clay. During the last sixty years it has become clear that both of Albright's suggestions required modifica- tion,77 and the chronological limits of collared rim jars have been expanded. The pithoi occur in late Late Bronze II contexts at Aphek,78 and at Qiri they con- tinue into Iron II. The connection with the Israelites now also has been abandoned.79 It is true that several features of the form, including the many variations of the rim, and the collar itself, are departures from the typical Late Bronze pithos. However, the ethnic inspiration for these changes has not been established. The link with the Israelites was based both on the occurrence of the vessel at typical Israelite settlements in the central hill country and the Galilee and the absence of the jar at the "Canaanite" cities. Recent evidence demonstrates that the jars appear in ethnically ambiguous contexts. The stratigraphie evidence from Yoqne'am and Qiri indicates that collared rim pithoi were in use mainly in the Iron I and the tenth century. More rims were found at Qiri than at Yoqne'am, despite the smaller sample size from Qiri, probably because the Iron I strata at Qiri were more extensively excavated than those at Yoqne'am. Philistine Ware (Fig. 42) Philistine pottery is not frequent at any of the YRP sites. The rims of only two forms are attested,80 both of which are included in Dothan's category of bowls /craters.81 The difference between bowl and crater is one of size, and the examples from the YRP include both types. Dothan notes that the rim types found at the YRP sites are the most common forms of Philis- tine ware, attested at every site at which Philistine pottery appears.82 The only other Philistine form present is the beer-jug (none was recovered with a rim), a common Philistine vessel. The stratigraphie context of the Philistine pottery at the YRP sites is not satisfactory. Dothan has exam- ined the Philistine material from Qiri and dates it to the late twelfth or early eleventh century BC on stylis- tic grounds.83 However, if the stratigraphie evidence from Qiri were taken at face value, it would suggest 73.

Bichrome Ware (Fig. 42) Bichrome ware is distinguished by the style of decora- tion appearing on the vessels. During the Iron Age, most locally produced pottery was decorated in only one color, usually red, although black also occurs. Bichrome ware is decorated with bands of both red and black paint, hence the name. The corpus of Bi- chrome ware at the YRP sites is composed of craters, bowls and jugs. A few pilgrim flasks were also exca- vated, but none had a preserved rim. At Qiri only eight Bichrome rims were found. None occurred in a stratified context in Area D. At Yoqne'am 24 Bichrome rims were uncovered. The most common types are the craters. Both bowls and jugs also occur. With the exception of a single intru- sive rim in Stratum 10, none of the stratified rims occurs after the tenth century. The evidence from Yoqne'am supports the generally accepted Iron I to Iron II date for this ware. The stratified material is not extensive: this ware is not common at the YRP sites.84 The YRP finds can, however, make a significant contribution to the general knowledge of this ware. Amiran defines the basic forms of the Bichrome as the jug and the bowl.85 Though these forms appear at the YRP sites, the corpus can now be expanded to include two types of craters, which are also the most frequent ones of this ware at the YRP sites. These crater forms, as well as the other Bichrome forms, can fit easily into the standard Iron Age corpus of ceramic forms. The origin of Bichrome pottery is generally sought in Phoenicia.86 Amiran has suggested that the style began in northern Israel or Phoenicia. 87 She views the ware as the first expression of the Phoenician- Israelite cultural world after the collapse of the Bronze Age Canaanite culture. In fact, the "Bi- chrome" style of decoration is only a minor artistic development. Both red and black paint were used on standard Iron Age pottery, and this combination of two colors is not a difficult feat. The search for a single ethnic origin for this artistic variation may be misguided, since the forms of the Bichrome ware are part of the general corpus of the period. Vessels with identical forms have standard Iron Age slip and burnish decoration. J. Yellin and J. Perlman have recently tested two Bichrome sherds from Tel Mevorakh using Neutron Activation Analy- sis.88 With such a small sample the results are not definite, but a production source near Tel Megadim on the coast between Haifa and Dor was suggested. The overlap of standard technique of decoration and the Bichrome style on vessels of identical form and manufacture supports the suggestion made by Yellin and Perlman that the ware was locally produced. In fact, since the technique of decoration is nothing more than the combination of two pre-existing ele- ments of decoration, a single production center is unlikely. The ware could easily have been produced throughout Palestine. While the Bichrome ware is a useful chronological indicator, it is not a good tool for determining the ethnic associations of Iron Age pottery. The reason for the existence of any pottery style is always diffi- cult to determine, but the suggestion made by Yellin and Perlman that the ware was intended to imitate Cypriote Bichrome ware seems reasonable.89 Samaria Ware (Fig. 43) As Amiran has noted, the term Samaria ware (SA) has yet to be accurately defined.90 In this study, Samaria ware designates bowls decorated in a tech- nique using a relatively thick, highly burnished slip of a red, black or yellow color. Black-painted bands may also be used. This ware is named for Samaria, the royal capital of Israel, although there is no evi- dence that the pottery was produced there. Both Amiran's thick and thin varieties of Samaria ware91 occur at the YRP sites. While most of the Samaria ware rim types also appear with standard 84. Hunt (above, n. 16). 85. Amiran (above, n. 1), pp. 270-271; S.V. Chapman, "A Catalogue of Iron Age Pottery from the Cemeter- ies of Khirbet Silm, Joya, Grayé and Gasmieh of South Lebanon," Berytus 21 (1972), pp. 55-194, has a more extensive collection of Bichrome vessels from southern Lebanon, with a good number of pilgrim flasks which should also be considered typical Bi- chrome ware. 86. Mevorakh, p. 90. Stern includes Bichrome ware among his imported pottery, but includes a question mark after the word imported in the text. 87. Amiran (above, n. 1), p. 271. 88. Mevorakh , p. 90. 89. See above n. 81. 90. Amiran (above, n. 1), pp. 207-212. 91. Ibid. 201</page><page sequence="213">types of decoration, a number of these are unique. Samaria ware bowls also have footed bases more frequently than standard plates and bowls. Samaria ware has an appealing appearance, and should be considered a luxury ware. It is generally dated to Iron II. At Qiri only nine Samaria rims were recovered. The single stratified rim in Area D occurred in Stra- tum V/VI, confirming the standard Iron II date of the ware. At Yoqne'am, Samaria ware first appears in the tenth century, and its frequency increases as Iron II progresses.92 The most frequent form is SA/a, the pointed rim. In general, the stratigraphie evidence from Yoq- ne'am and Qiri supports the Iron II date of the ware. Samaria ware seems to have increased in frequency as the period progressed, although it was never common. With regard to the question of urban/village ceramic variation, Samaria ware is more frequent at Yoqne'am than at Qiri. The question of the discarded 1975 season rims does not obscure the significance of the higher proportion of Samaria ware rims at Yoq- ne'am. Since the Samaria ware is so distinctive, virtu- ally all excavated sherds would have been saved at Qiri whatever methodology was in use. In this instance, the greater wealth of the urban center is reflected in the greater frequency of the luxury ware in the city. Cypro-Phoenician Ware (Fig. 43) Cypro-Phoenician (CY), or Black-on-Red ware, is one of the most distinctive wares of the Iron Age in Palestine. The well-fired reddish clay of the vessels is usually covered with a glossy, highly burnished orange slip and is decorated with precisely drawn bands of black paint. More elaborate geometric deco- ration is not uncommon, and the vessel's horizontal handles are frequently emphasized by hand-painted lines. The origin and date of this ware has been the subject of some dispute. Black-on-Red ware is most common on the island of Cyprus, and the widest range of forms is also found there. Yellin and Perl- man have remarked that the Black-on-Red sherds they tested from Tel Mevorakh were most probably made from a mixture of two typical Cypriote clays.93 For this study, Cypro-Phoenician ware will be considered a Cypriote product. The question of date cannot be easily established. Cypro-Phoenician pottery is found in small quanti- ties at virtually every Iron Age site in Palestine. According to the Palestinian chronological evidence, the trade in this ware began in Iron I, peaked in the tenth century, and declined toward the close of Iron II. The stratigraphie evidence from the three YRP sites is almost identical with the accepted profile, although none of the ware was found in Iron I contexts. This coherent set of chronological evidence is unfortunately at odds with the accepted date of the Black-on-Red ware in Cyprus. The chronological range in Cyprus is fairly consistently a century or more later than their dates in Palestine. This dispute has raged since the 1930s.94 It is clear, given the NAA results from Mevorakh, that separate sources for Cypro-Phoenician and Black-on-Red wares are very unlikely. It seems that the basic chronologies of many sites in one culture or the other are off by at least a century. The preponderance of the evidence supplied by Birmingham and van Beek 95 demonstrates that the dates from Palestine are to be preferred. At Yoqne'am, more than 90 Cypro-Phoenician rims were excavated. Simple rim bowls are the most frequent form. The ware occurs most frequently in Stratum 11 and very rarely in the floor phases of Stratum 10. These results support the generally accepted dates in Palestine for the ware. At Qiri, only 18 Cypro-Phoenician rims were exca- vated. The most frequent form is the simple rim bowl. The rims occur in equal frequency from Stratum VIII through Stratum V/VI. The stratigraphie evidence supports the decline of frequency of the ware as Iron II progresses. The range of forms at Yoqne'am is greater than at Qiri. As with Samaria ware, Cypro-Phoenician pottery is an indication of the greater wealth and wider con- tacts of the urban center versus the village site. Like Samaria ware, Cypro-Phoenician ware is distinctive, and almost all the excavated sherds at Qiri would have been saved. As expected, imported pottery is more common at the urban site than at the smaller settlement. 92. Hunt (above, n. 16). 93. Mevorakh , pp. 88-89. 94. E. Gjerstad and W.

Another term used to describe this pottery is Achziv ware, after the site where a quantity was excavated. The origin of this pottery is not known, although Phoenicia has been suggested as the source. 96 The ware dates to Iron II. Phoenician ware is rare at the YRP sites. At Yoq- ne'am only 12 Phoenician rims were excavated. The stratified rims date from the tenth to the eighth cen- turies BC, supporting the generally accepted dates. Only two Phoenician rims were found at Qiri, but not in stratified Area D contexts. The full corpus of Phoenician ware was not found at the YRP sites. In particular, the mushroom rim jugs and juglets are absent. The most frequent form is the bowl, but the overall quantities are so low that this distribution cannot be considered significant. The presence of the three "flowers"97 is all the more remarkable given the generally limited number of rims. The scarcity of Phoenician forms at the YRP sites is somewhat surprising. From the tenth century on- wards, the western Jezreel Valley formed the border between Israel and Phoenicia. Contact between the two cultures should have been extensive, as Israel and Phoenicia had various political alliances. However, these contacts are not expressed in pottery, as pottery imported from Cyprus is more common than pottery produced in neighboring Phoenicia. While even cities within the Phoenician sphere of influence display an overwhelming Phoenician ceramic influence, as many standard Israelite forms continue at these sites, the frequency of the Phoenician pottery at the YRP sites is extremely low. Assyrian/Assyrianizing Ware (Fig. 44) As Amiran has noted,98 these forms - the carinated flaring bowl, the bottle and the "jarlet" - are distin- guished from local products both in shape and in technique. Parallels from Assyrian sites in Mesopota- mia leave no doubt as to the origin of the ware. Based upon the evidence available in 1969, Amiran has argued that almost all of the Assyrian pottery in Palestine is dated to the period following the Assy- rian conquest of Israel.99 The only exception was a bottle from Hazor. The stratigraphie evidence from Yoqne'am, and possibly Qiri, provides new evidence for pre-conquest contact. At Yoqne'am only two examples of Assyrian ware were excavated, a carinated bowl and a "jarlet." The latter was found in a Stratum 10A context, and the bowl below a Stratum 10 floor. Both these contexts indicate a date prior to the Assyrian conquest of Israel. At Qiri two bowls and a bottle were found, but only one of the bowls was in a stratigraphie context in Area D. The bowl is assigned to Stratum VII, which dates roughly to the ninth century BC. It is possible that the bowl is intrusive in Stratum VII. Other Imported Ware (Fig. 44) The evidence for other imported wares at the YRP sites is very slight. Small quantities of Cypriote White-Painted and Bichrome wares have been found, but in uncertain contexts. An especially interesting find at Qiri is a large portion of a Euboean Subgeometric dinos which was excavated in Area C in 1975. Prof. J.N. Coldstream examined drawings and a photograph of the sherds and dated the piece to 700 BC, or a little later. 100 The dinos was found in the large building in Area C, which dates to a possible Assyrian re-occupation of the site, at a time when Area D does not seem to have been occupied. MINOR FORMS Juglets (Fig. 40) Juglets appear in one of two basic forms in the Iron Age ceramic tradition. Each variant has a specific function. The first is the "dipper" juglet, JT I in the YRP typology. This vessel has a relatively wide mouth and large body, and generally was used to transfer liquids from a larger vessel to a smaller one. The second can best be described as a "container" juglet, JT II in the YRP typology. It has a narrow neck and a mouth and small body, and, like the modern perfume bottle, was used to hold small quan- tities of some relatively expensive liquid, such as a 96. Amiran (above, n. 1), pp. 272-275. 97. Sherds of the same form have been found at Keisan, see Keisan, PI. 42:3, 6. 98. Amiran (above, n. 1). 99. Ibid. 100. J. N.

Andreiomenou, Archailogike Ephemeris (1975), PI. 61. 203</page><page sequence="215">special oil, perfume or drug. The dipper juglet had domestic uses, and when traded would have been shipped empty. The container juglet was involved in the long-distance trade of luxury substances, and would have been shipped full. Juglets are not common at the YRP sites. Only 26 juglet rims were excavated at Qiri. JT/a and b are the most frequent and occur in roughly equal quantities in all phases of Area D. Only one unstratified Black Juglet rim was found. At Yoqne'am 127 juglet rims were excavated, but only five belonged to Black Juglets. Again, JT/a and JT/b were the most fre- quent. The only stratified examples of Black Juglets occurred in the tenth century. 101 JT I/a is the most frequent form. The body profile of five of the juglets was preserved. One is globular, two are oval, the fourth is cylindrical, and the fifth piriform. This type is decorated with red slip and burnish or with painted bands. JT I/b is also a frequent form. The body profile of three of these vessels was preserved. Two have an oval profile while the third is cylindrical. Its only decoration is red slip and/or burnishing. JT I/c occurs only in small quantities. Only one oval-bodied vessel was preserved. Some of the juglets have the standard red-slip decoration. From this evidence it is possible to conclude that the main types of dipper juglet rim were used throughout the Iron Age. The body profile of only ten of the 158 juglet rims was preserved. Amiran102 has noted that body profile is the best chronological indicator for Iron Age juglets, but given the small sample size no sound observations can be made about the significance of the body profiles of the YRP juglets. It is clear that the dipper juglets were much more common than the container juglets. JT Il/a and Il/b are varieties of Black Juglets, named for the black slip that normally decorates them. In some cases the slip is reddish. Amiran has already defined these types, noting that JT Il/b dates to the early part of Iron II and JT Il/a to the latter part of Iron II. 103 The limited finds from the YRP sites can contribute little to these chronological observations. The two types of Black Juglet are typical of Iron II, but are a relatively infrequent vessel. Since they are distinctive and easy to store, their frequency may have been exaggerated in previous studies. It is also possible that the juglet was a popular tomb gift and is scarce at the YRP sites because no tombs were excavated. The economic implications of the geographical dis- tribution of the juglets are interesting. The Black Juglets are found only within Palestine and were not exported to either Phoenicia or Cyprus. At the same time, Cypriote and Phoenician container juglets were being imported into both Israel and Judah. Thus, since exports were non-existent, Palestine was a net importer of the substances contained in the juglets. This trade imbalance was even more pronounced in the Late Bronze Age, 104 during which time the only locally produced container juglets were imitations of Cypriote and Aegean prototypes. During the Late Bronze Age, Palestine seems to have produced very little of the substances contained in the juglets. When the trade, disrupted at the end of the Late Bronze Age, was resumed in the Iron Age, one of the first items to be traded again was the container juglet. However, with the introduction of the Black Juglet, for the first time in centuries,105 local producers in Palestine were again competing successfully in the production of these substances. The role of container juglets in Iron Age trade has often been overlooked. The general outline of the trade must have been very similar to that of the Late Bronze Age, as the trading partners were also similar. Although the specific substances traded can no longer be identified, the numbers of juglets, both imported and local, suggests that they contained oils, perfumes, spices or drugs which were not available from local sources. Lamps (Fig. 44) Iron Age lamps were simply bowls whose walls were partially folded over to form a spout. This style of lamp is a continuation of the Late Bronze and earlier type of lamp. It would seem likely that since the analysis of the bowl rim form was fruitful the same would be the case with the closely related lamps. However, the key difference between the bowl and the lamp is the pinched spout for the wick. This spout 101. Hunt (above, n. 16). 102. Amiran (above, n. 1), pp. 251-265. 103. Ibid. 104. During the Late Bronze Age, Cypriote bilbils and Aegean alabastra and stirrup-jars were common at Palestinian sites. 105. If Abydos and Tell el-Yehudiyeh juglets were pro- duced outside of Palestine, it is possible that this imbalance extends back as early as the Early Bronze Age. 204</page><page sequence="216">is always simple, due to the pinching action required to form it. The rim type of the lamp bowl cannot be determined from the spout. Amiran has suggested that as the Iron Age pro- gressed wider and more pronounced lamp rims became increasingly common.106 The limited evi- dence from the YRP sites suggests that the various rim types occur with about the same frequency throughout the period. Cups and Saucers (Fig. 44) The cup and saucer of Iron Age Palestine is an ordi- nary bowl with a "cup" attached to its center. The body of the cup is often pierced by a hole, so that liquid poured into the cup would also flow into the bowl. The form began to appear in the Late Bronze and continued into Iron I. The vessel is uncommon and it is generally assumed that it had a cultic purpose. As these vessels have two rims, they represent something of a problem for a rim study. However, since in every case the rim of the bowl was simple, the rim of the cup was used for classification. Only seven cup and saucer rims were found at the three YRP sites. Cup and saucer rims were excavated at Yoq- ne'am and Qashish, none in a sound context. Five vessels were recovered at Qiri. The only example with a stratigraphie context in Area D was excavated in Stratum VIII, which dates to the latter part of Iron I. Flasks, Goblets, Pyxides and Amphoriskoi (Figs. 40-41) The decision of the YRP staff to save all excavated rims has revealed that the frequency of some forms was surprisingly low. The four forms considered here are examples of this category. Amiran has devoted major sections to each of these forms in her descrip- tion of the pottery of the Iron Age.107 Yet, each of these vessels is almost totally absent from the corpus of the YRP sites. Not only are the rims infrequent, but since these forms are recognized as diagnostic, all of their body sherds would have been saved. The only possible conclusion is that these forms were not com- mon at the YRP settlement sites. Amphoriskoi and goblets are entirely absent from the YRP sites. Ten flask rims were found at all three sites. Only one pyxis was excavated. The stratigra- phie context of this small sample was not useful. A number of possible solutions can be suggested for the scarcity of these forms at the YRP sites. Some of the forms, especially pyxides and flasks, may have been used mainly as tomb gifts, and thus would be rare in occupation deposits. The excavators at Tell Keisan108 found a relatively large number of flasks, but most came from a single locus. This suggests that these forms had restricted functions and were accord- ingly concentrated in specific parts of a settlement. In any case, the attention paid to these forms in previous studies seems out of proportion to their position in the ceramic assemblage. They also have little use as chronological indicators, as they do not appear in most contexts. Other Types The vessels included in this category are rare, and were expected to be so. Most of these vessels are considered to be of a cultic nature. The three-handled jar has no cultic associations and seems to have been merely a variation of the standard storage jars of the period. Only one was found at Qiri. No kernoi rims were excavated at Qiri, although a number of body sherds were recovered. Two miniature votive bowls were also excavated and are illustrated in the typol- ogy plates. OT/a: Incense Burners (Bowls) (Fig. 45) The name traditionally assigned to these vessels has clear cultic connotations. Recently, M. Fowler has argued that these vessels and their associated stands did not have a cultic purpose.109 The soot marks on some of the burners undoubtedly account for the last half of the name of the vessel. It should be noted that incense burners as well as stands are very rare. Unlike the typical vessels of the period, they do not occur in most loci. Secondly, during the Iron Age there are no hard and fast archi- tectural rules for distinguishing sanctuaries. Many were open areas or were situated in ordinary domes- tic buildings. Thus, non-architectural features such as pottery, figurines and altars are likely to be crucial in identifying cultic buildings. The presence of several rare and supposedly cultic vessels may indicate the possibility of a cultic role for 106. Amiran (above, n. 1), p. 291. 107. Ibid., pp. 213-215, 248-250, and 276-285. 108.

Qasile, Megiddo and Taanach110 demon- strate the association of the "cultic" class of vessels in a definite cultic context. Fowler includes the stand and burner from Qiri in his study, and notes only that they came from a domestic house. He suggests that these vessels may have served as braziers to heat rooms or for other domestic purposes. He ignores the finds associated with the Qiri burner and stand, which included chal- ice rims and a double vessel. When the standing stone and basin by the door of the unusual three-room structure are also considered, it becomes clear that the domestic nature of the deposit cannot be taken for granted. Fowler correctly points out that there is no proof that the burners were used for incense, and that they may have had many other possible cultic roles, rang- ing from use as a container for libations or as a cultic plant box. Certainly, the archaeological designation as incense burner should not be taken literally. Nevertheless the terminology holds, as it implies a cultic role for the vessel. Given the general context and associated vessels, it seems reasonable until a more convincing explanation can be found for the repeated association of these rare vessels. Incense Burners (Stands) (Fig. 45) Most of the comments made concerning incense burners (bowls) apply to stands as well. The two forms are often associated. The association of incense burners, bowls and stands as a single type represents A. Ben-Tor's view. M. Hunt, on the other hand, maintains that while it is clear that the burners and stands are closely related, they are often excavated separately and there is no proof that the two forms were always produced as sets. The stands in particu- lar could have had many uses on their own. The complete stand from Qiri was excavated with an incense burner in situ , indicating that the stand and bowl were a set. However, no other stands and burners were found in such close association. _The complete stand is relatively simple, as it lacks win- dows and was decorated with linear painted designs. The stand is a less elaborate version of the cult stands found in shrines at Megiddo111 and Taanach112 from Iron I. The stand from Taanach is particularly instructive, as W. Dever has recently pointed out the religious significance of some of the decorative ele- ments.113 While the Qiri stand lacks such cultic deco- ration, the context of both vessels is similar. Some of the fragmentary stands had windows, although none had elaborate decoration. OT/b : Double Vessel (Fig. 45) The double vessel from Qiri was found in the same locus as the incense burner and stand, and the com- ments on cultic use apply here as well. The vessel is crudely made and the surface finish is rough. The two cups are joined by a hole so that, as in the cup and saucer, liquid poured into one part would flow into the other. The shape of the two cups recalls that of a goblet, a form otherwise not attested at the site. OT/d: Strainer Bodies (Fig. 45) The name for this type was chosen for its neutral character. This vessel has also been called a censer, as frequently the holes are pierced only in the upper part of the body, limiting the utility of the vessel as a strainer. Such holes are, of course, typical of censers and no doubt led to the origin of the name. The few examples excavated at the three YRP sites can add little to the resolution of the question of the use of the vessels, as none of the contexts was sound. C. Observations on the Iron Age Pottery of the Yoqne'am Regional Project SUMMARY The preceding analysis of the Iron Age pottery exca- vated at Tell Qiri is a departure from studies on the pottery from other sites in Palestine. The "represen- tative sample" used at other sites had been expanded to include all the rims excavated, in an attempt to estimate the increase and decline in frequency of each rim type through time. 1 10.

When the evidence from each individual form is combined, the resulting stratum profile is even more precise because of the way the evidence interlocks. The figures which accompany this study illustrate the characteristic pottery of Iron I, the tenth century and the eighth century as found at the YRP sites. The Iron Age I (late 13-1 1th centuries BC) is best represented by the material from Qiri. Stratum IX is the earliest major Iron Age occupation at Qiri. The cooking pots are characterized by a high percentage of CP I rims, while CP II and IV occur in smaller quantities. SJ I/c is the most frequent storage jar rim, and its high frequency in this phase is all the more remark- able since it is infrequent in most later levels. The other two rim types of SJ I also occur in quantity, as they do in all phases of the Iron Age. The frequency profiles for bowls are even more rewarding, as the high frequency of simple rim bowls makes this almost universal form diagnostic. Bell- shaped bowls are also characteristic of the period. Bowls with widened rims are relatively uncommon in this stratum. Bowl rims are usually undecorated and slips are not generally found on the decorated rims. Finally, for the only time in the Iron Age, rounded bowls are more common than carinated bowls. The frequency profiles of craters also led to new and important observations. First of all, even during the early Iron Age the most frequent form was not derived from the Late Bronze craters. A new tradi- tion commenced which lasted until the end of the Iron Age. These handleless, usually undecorated ves- sels are in fact one of the most characteristic forms of the Iron Age at the YRP sites. During Stratum IX at Qiri, C II was the most frequent rim type, while C I was also an important type representing a large pro- portion of the sample. Though C IV, the form derived from the Late Bronze craters, occurs in Stratum IX, it is the least frequent major crater rim type. Among the secondary and minor forms, the only two points of interest are the presence of CH III and the collared-rim pithos in the early strata at Qiri. As Iron I progresses, a transition is made at Qiri from Stratum IX to Stratum VIII. While basically the same rim types are present in both strata, they can be distinguished by variations in frequency. S J I/c declines sharply in frequency as SJ I/a becomes more popular. For bowls the situation is similar. The fre- quency of the simple rim declines while that of the thickened rim bowls rises slightly. The popularity of C II peaks; that of C I declines. Slips are used to decorate bowls, but do not yet appear on craters. Corroborative evidence is available from Yoq- ne'am from the beginning of Iron II (tenth century BC). 114 CP I is still the most frequent cooking pot rim, but it continues a long-term gradual decrease. In fact, this note of gradual decrease applies to most of the major rim types. SJ I/a is still the most frequent storage jar rim, the simple rim bowl the most frequent form of bowls and C II the most frequent crater rim type, but the dominance of all three is decreasing. For the first time slip and burnish are commonly used to decorate bowls and craters. Widened rim bowls are also more frequent. Among the secondary and minor types, CH III disappears from the corpus. Bichrome, Samaria and Cypro-Phoenician wares all appear for the first time. The incised signs on cooking pot rims are also an indicator for this period. The differences between the pottery of Qiri Stra- tum VII and that of Yoqne'am Stratum 11 should also be noted. At Qiri, the collared-rim pithos con- tinues into the tenth century, and the B I V/c and C III rims occur in small quantities. The first is a carry- over of an earlier feature, and the last two do not occur until a later phase at Yoqne'am. These differen- ces can best be explained by the lack of a major stratigraphie break at Qiri in the transition from Iron I to Iron II. Stratum VII is composed of three phases, and the occupation during these phases seems to have been of a longer time span than that of Stratum 1 1 at Yoqne'am. The distinction between the main tenth and eighth century phases at Qiri and Yoqne'am is clear. The differences in almost every form are marked, but what is noteworthy is that these differences are antici- pated in every case by gradual changes during the intervening sub-phases of Stratum 10 at Yoqne'am and by Strata VII and V/VI at Qiri. For cooking pots the key difference is the appear- ance of CP III in quantity. SJ V/b and V/d are also new forms found only after the tenth century. For bowls the main changes are the decline in frequency of simple rim bowls accompanied by an increase in the other unwidened rim types, the rectangular and bevelled rims. In addition, large numbers of plates 114. For the full details of the Yoqne'am evidence, see Hunt (above, n. 16). 207</page><page sequence="219">also appear. For craters the dominant position of C III is the new element. All these changes, as has been demonstrated in the discussion of each form, do not occur suddenly at the end of the eighth century, but first appear in small numbers which increase gradu- ally as the earlier forms decrease. Given this evidence, the nature of the ninth century pottery and the reason it is difficult to define are clear. There was no sharp ceramic break during Iron II. The tenth century types gradually evolved and mingled with the increasingly popular new types dur- ing the ninth century. This was a period of transition with tenth and eighth century forms all present, dis- tinguished only by changes in frequency. Indeed, many of the Iron Age forms were long-lived and not restricted to any one phase. If the ninth century is accepted as a period of transition, the long-standing difficulty in defining the "typical" ninth century forms and assemblage is removed and the "mixed" loci from other sites can be reevaluated. The information derived from the secondary and minor forms adds somewhat to the overall picture. Phoenician pottery occurs in roughly the same small quantity as in the tenth century. Cypro-Phoenician ware shows a decline in frequency and Samaria ware an increase. Bichrome ware virtually disappears after the tenth century. Of course, the small sample size of these wares must be taken into account when evaluat- ing these differences. Again, it should be noted that the differences between Qiri Stratum V/VI and Yoqne'am Stratum 10 are generally those of degree. For example, CP III is not as frequent at Qiri as at Yoqne'am. In the same vein, bevelled and rectangular rim bowls, C III, SJ V/b and V/c, are also not as frequent as at Yoqne'am. CONCLUSIONS Based on the evidence from Yoqne'am, it seems likely that the Iron Age occupation in Area D at Qiri ended sometime during Stratum 10 at Yoqne'am. This would account for the lower frequency of late forms at Qiri. However, Stratum V/VI at Qiri is a compos- ite of two strata. Bulldozers levelled the surface of Tell Qiri for the construction of housing before exca- vation began and, as result, the latest Iron Age occu- pation in Stratum V of Area D was partially removed. The pottery assigned to Stratum V/VI is therefore more representative of Stratum VI than of Stratum V. The pre-excavation disturbance of the 208 surface of the mound can probably best explain the differences between Qiri and Yoqne'am during the ninth-eighth centuries BC. The following table summarizes stratigraphie rela- tionships and the absolute dates of the Iron Age strata at Qiri and Yoqne'am, based on the available ceramic evidence. Qiri Yoqne'am Date IX 1 2th- 1 1th centuries VIII 11th century IIB VII 11 10th century 10C VI 10B 9th century V 10A 8th century 10 9 7th century AN ASSESSMENT OF THE CERAMIC EVIDENCE FOR URBAN/VILLAGE VARIATION The Old Testament refers in various lists of tribal borders and adminstrative districts to a city and its banot , or "daughters" (Joshua 15:47). These "daugh- ters" were the villages surrounding the urban center which were administered by the central authority through the city, which served as a regional center. The three sites excavated by the staff of the YRP include an example of such a regional center - the urban site of Yoqne'am. Qiri and Qashish can be considered representative examples of the villages, or "daughters," administered by Yoqne'am, which was the closest urban site to both Qiri and Qashish. Since the three related sites were excavated by the same staff, using a common methodology, it is possible for the first time to examine the material culture of the sites and the relationship between an urban center and its dependent villages. The ubiquitous pottery can serve as the most effec- tive evidence of the material culture on which to concentrate such a study. As a basic component of daily life, the types of pottery in use can provide a good idea of the lifestyle of the inhabitants. The YRP staff expected to find major differences in the Iron Age pottery of the city and villages. Some of</page><page sequence="220">the preliminary hypotheses included speculation that the city pottery would be decorated more frequently and elaborately than that of the villages. More luxury and imported wares were also expected in the city, with the result that a noticeably wider range of ceramic forms would be available to the residents of the city. The results of the analysis of the form, frequency, and decoration of the pottery presented in this study show that the relationship between the urban site and its villages was not what was expected. In numerical terms, perhaps 99% of the pottery at the three sites is indistinguishable. Included in this part of the sample are the basic utilitarian forms, the cooking pot, the storage jar, the bowl, the crater and the jug. Not only are the rim types of these vessels in the city and the villages identical, they also occur at the same general levels of frequency during each chronological period in both types of settlements. Most of the other, and less common, components of the Iron Age pottery corpus, such as baking trays, juglets, lamps and chali- ces, are also virtually identical in both Yoqne'am and the villages. Only in the final 1% of the pottery corpus do some significant differences occur. Only the relatively highly decorated or imported wares vary in the city and villages. For example, imported wares such as Cypro-Phoenician and Phoenician pottery occur with greater frequency and in a wider range of forms at the urban site. Luxury vessels, such as the Samaria ware bowls, are also more common at Yoqne'am. In addition, the incised hole-mouth storage jars, a fea- ture from the southern region of the country, are attested at Yoqne'am but not found in the villages. All these elements suggest that the urban site had a wider range of contacts than the villages. And to help balance the picture, it should be pointed out that the only piece of Greek Iron Age pottery, a Sub- Geometric dinos from Euboea, was found at Qiri. In addition, Philistine pottery is more common at Qiri than at Yoqne'am, which may indicate more contact with the south in Iron I. The villages thus were not isolated from the outside world; they simply had fewer external contacts. As regards decoration, it, too, was expected to be a variable factor. And, indeed, the raw data supported the original hypothesis that the pottery of the city was more frequently decorated than that of the villages. The vessels from Yoqne'am were often decorated with slip and burnish, or painted. However, when the pottery was separated into chronological phases, it became evident that the plentiful Iron I finds from Qiri had biased the initial impression. Period by period, the Yoqne'am bowls and craters were only marginally more decorated than those of Qiri of the same phase. Several reasons for the basic similarity can be sug- gested. First of all, such differences as do exist are concentrated in fine tableware or imported vessels. No difference is apparent in cooking vessels, storage jars, or the typical bowls and craters. These vessels were essential requirements in all Iron Age house- holds. By and far, households used the same pottery, and wealth was exhibited only by the occasional fine or imported vessel. Iron Age pottery is not noted for its excellent deco- ration, beauty or pleasing form. If such little empha- sis was placed on the artistic quality of pottery during the period, pottery would seem to have been viewed as a utilitarian tool and not as an art form or mark of status. Status may have been indicated more by who used the pottery in a household rather than by the form of the pottery itself. In a rich household, ser- vants would have done the cooking; in a peasant household, the family members themselves would have done it. Similarly, a household, whether rich or poor, was likely to use the same kind of storage jar. Social difference therefore may also have been a func- tion of quantity rather than style. A rich household may have owned dozens of storage jars filled with foodstuffs and goods, a poor household only a hand- ful. But, on the whole, it seems that the daily life of the ordinary resident of Yoqne'am and Qiri, as reflected by the pottery, was basically similar and the inhabitants used the same types and styles of vessels and followed the same lifestyle. Though no upper class or government buildings that could be expected to produce a wealthier set of pottery vessels were excavated at the YRP sites, such buildings have been found at sites such as Hazor, Megiddo and Samaria. There, too, the pottery does not reveal any new types of cooking pots, storage jars or tableware. It thus seems that even at the upper reaches of society, the standard vessels were generally no different in form and decoration from those of the average resident. In Iron Age Israel, the standard city comprised about ten acres of dwellings and administrative buildings. The population of Iron Age Yoqne'am most probably numbered in the hundreds. The main role of the city was to serve as a key point in defense and to administer the central government's relations with the villages in its area. Based on the evidence provided by the material culture, residence in a city 209</page><page sequence="221">such as Yoqne'am would have been little different from residence in a nearby village. COMPARISON OF THE IRON AGE POTTERY AT YRP AND OTHER SITES115 Since this analysis is based on a new methodology, its comparison with other sites is somewhat difficult. As the pottery of the sites chosen for comparison uni- formly published using the "representative sample" method, the limitations of that method must be accepted. This evaluation can only be based upon the presence/absence system, as it is not possible to derive any accurate statistics from the published, or even the saved, "representative sample" of the other sites. Comparisons between sites are generally based either on selected loci or selected vessels. Neither of these approaches - although each is a valid method - is appropriate here. The frequency profiles used in the analysis of the YRP are based on the stratum or phase rather than the locus. A locus is a very limited physical area of a site and the function which that small area served in antiquity had a direct effect on the pottery and other artifacts deposited there. For example, in his study of the pottery of Taa- nach, W. Rast chose the pottery from a cultic build- ing as the basis for the pottery of one period. 116 This pottery was plentiful, and the parallels with other sites with similar contexts is very convincing. Never- theless, the pottery from the cultic structure cannot be accepted as representative of the ceramic corpus of the site as a whole, as the area had only a limited function. By excavating a large area, and using all the strati- graphically sound loci, we have sought to minimize the effects of architectural function and other factors on pottery analysis. The stratum and phase profiles are more representative of the pottery used on the site as a whole than of the pottery of any one locus. Another advantage of our method is the inclusion of every rim type and vessel form in the study. The classification of almost all the sample makes the resulting typology an accurate reflection of the pot- tery of the site. Excavations using the standard method do not necessarily publish all the forms found at a site, as the "representative sample" approach does not emphasize the importance of a complete sample. The comparisons made in this study are an effort to make the two methods compatible. Charts were com- piled recording the presence of the typical and char- acteristic rim types of the YRP sites at the comparison sites. Only one reference was provided for each type, as frequency studies cannot be effec- tively made on published pottery based on the repre- sentative sample. The types used in the charts include those of the streamlined typology, as well as the secondary forms with chronological importance. By means of this data it is possible to judge the relation- ship of the published pottery from the comparison sites with that of the YRP sites and to form an idea of the chronological relationships between the sites. The sites chosen for study are Taanach, Megiddo, Hazor, Keisan and Samaria. Taanach (Table 4). The excavations headed by P. Lapp117 uncovered major strata dating to Iron I and the tenth century BC. The remains of the latter part of the Iron Age were meager in the limited areas exca- vated. The earlier Sellin excavations produced remains from these periods, but the stratification from his early and primitive excavations is not accepted today. The pottery from Periods IA and IB at Taanach is similar to the pottery from Qiri IX and VIII. The main difference is the presence of Late Bronze style cooking pots at Taanach. The bowls, storage jars and craters are all similar to those of Qiri. The Late Bronze cooking pots are a clear indication that Period IA dates to a slightly earlier phase of the Iron Age than Qiri IX. The cooking pots, the Ugaritic Type B tablet from Taanach and the Canaanite jar from Qiri are all indications of the survival of elements of Late Bronze traditions at the two sites. Combined with the biblical references to the difficulty of the Israelites in subdu- ing the Late Bronze inhabitants of the Jezreel Val- ley,118 it may be possible to conclude that these features are the result of "Canaanite" populations at Qiri and Taanach. However, this "Canaanite" influence should not be overemphasized. The pottery corpus at both sites is almost entirely within the Iron Age tradition even 115. See comments below for the evidence from the sites chosen for comparison. 116. Taanach 1 , Fig. 10:5. 117. Ibid. 118. For example, Judg. 1:27-28. 210</page><page sequence="222">Table 4.

The Late Bronze type cooking pots disappear at Taanach during Period I, and only a single Canaanite jar was found at Qiri. Furthermore, the settlement pattern does not conform to that of the Late Bronze Age. Qiri was apparently not occupied during the Late Bronze Age, and it was a village, not a city-state. Taanach was no longer a "Canaanite" city-state but had become a simple village like Qiri. Ceramic features of the Late Bronze Age may have survived to some degree, but the social and political systems of the Late Bronze Age had already vanished. As at Qiri' and Yoqne'am, the transition at Taa- nach from Iron I to the tenth century is smooth. The same basic rim types occur, although at Taanach the variations in frequency are not apparent. Period IIA is not well represented, but would correspond best to Stratum 1 IB at Yoqne'am and Qiri VIII or the earli- est sub-phase of Qiri VII. The end of Period IIB at Taanach is dated to Shishak's invasion, which occurred toward the end of the tenth century. The pottery of this period is similar to that of Stratum 1 1 at Yoqne'am and Qiri VII. For the later periods Taanach can contribute little, but for the earlier part of the Iron Age its pottery reconfirms the results of this study. The craters, even in Period IA, are the undecorated, handleless forms found at the YRP sites. The cooking pots after Period IA are also identical to those found at the YRP sites. The same three main types of storage jar rims occur, and the bowl forms are also the same. 211</page><page sequence="223">Megiddo (Table 5). This site has long been a crux in Syro-Palestinian archaeology. The site was dug by a major expedition in the 1920s and 1930s. The results of the expedition have long been a major reference point, albeit a disputed one. Since the publications of the Chicago expedition,119 Megiddo has been "re- dug" and "correctly" re-published by more scholars than any other site in the country. It is a tribute to the archaeologists of the Chicago expedition that despite the disease and hardships they faced, the results were fully published to the degree that they could be "corrected." The brief excavations conducted by Y. Yadin resolved most of the major problems regarding the early part of the Iron Age, although the results of that work are not accepted by all. Disputes still rage around bits and pieces of the architecture, especially for the later periods, which were entirely excavated in the 1930s and on which no new work can therefore be done. The methodology of the Chicago excavators pro- duced loci that were not properly defined. The pot- tery, especially from Strata I to III, is a mixture of several periods. The architecture of Strata IV to VII has been split and recombined so many times, that even for these relatively "clean" phases it is nearly impossible to reassign the published pottery to its new "correct" context and stratum. Despite these major reservations, if the pottery is treated cautiously some valuable observations can result. The most important fact is the close analogy between the Megiddo and the YRP pottery. The cooking pots, storage jars, bowls and craters at the two sites are nearly identical. Parallels for almost all the rim types defined in the YRP typology appear at Megiddo. As the two sites are separated by only about ten miles, this finding in itself is not remarkable. The pottery from Megiddo VII and VI is almost identical with that of Qiri IX and VIII. The cooking pots and the craters are the best indicators for com- parison. Again, the transition into the tenth century is smooth, although the division between Strata V and IV is the most difficult problem at Megiddo. Stratum V is clearly early, but some eighth century elements such as C III, SJ V/b and V/d appear in Stratum IV. Stratum IV contains elements from the tenth to the eighth centuries and it is clear that the original excavations combined at least two phases in this stratum. The reconstruction by Y. Yadin l20seems to afford the best evidence for dividing the stratum architecturally.121 Stratum III dates to the period fol- lowing the Assyrian conquest and is thus later than much of the pottery from the YRP sites. The differences between the Megiddo and the YRP pottery can best be attributed to the differences between the excavation methods at the two sites. At Megiddo, the first four strata were completely exca- vated. Much of the earlier Iron Age levels were exposed. Given this huge sample, the excavators were attracted to the better decorated wares, which occupy much of the pottery plates. As less of Yoqne'am has been dug, fewer of these fine pieces were found. In addition, Megiddo was a major administrative cen- ter, while the status of Yoqne'am was not so exalted. Given the confused state of the publication of the Chicago expedition, and in the absence of any major publication of Yadin's work, the standard procedure for archaeological comparison should be turned on its head. The pottery of the YRP is the best example of what the pottery of Megiddo must have been. Especially when the evidence for the Iron I and the tenth century for Taanach is added to that of YRP sites, the pottery found in the buildings at Megiddo can be "reconstructed" with greater accuracy than the architecture. Taanach and the YRP sites straddle Megiddo, and the same forms occur at all five sites. It is reasonable to assume that the everyday, utilitarian pottery of Megiddo was the same as at the neighbor- ing sites. The pottery of the Jezreel Valley and the adjacent areas seems to exhibit a number of distinct regional features. The most obvious of these are the incised signs on cooking pots, which have a limited area of distribution, from Megiddo to the coast. The signs are most frequent at the YRP sites, where they may well have been produced. The high frequency of the handleless, undecorated craters is another possible 119. Megiddo / and Megiddo II. 120.

The recently proposed redating of Megiddo V-I V by D. Saltz raises a number of issues which cannot be considered here (See D. Saltz, Greek Geometric Pot- tery in the East: The Chronological Implications, Appendix D. (Harvard Dissertation, 1978). The close similarity of the pottery at Yoqne'am, Qiri and Megiddo, combined with their geographical proxim- ity, argue for the similarity of the occupation spans at the three sites. Thus, in my opinion, Saltz is not correct in eliminating a ninth century occupation at Megiddo. 212</page><page sequence="224">Table 5.

These craters are very common at the YRP sites and at other nearby sites such as Taanach and Mevorakh. This vessel does not seem to be as frequent at Hazor, where ledged craters are common. The Bichrome ware craters are another possible regional form. Hazor (Table 6). The publication of the finds from Hazor was never completed, but extensive plates were published. 122 The Iron I pottery from Hazor XII and XI is generally similar to that found at Qiri. The cooking pot forms are the same, as are the bowls and storage jars. The main difference is the absence of C I and C II forms at Hazor, where only C IV forms are found along with some variants. Once again, the transition to the tenth century is smooth, as most of the same forms continue. Here, too, the C I and C II rim types are not found at Hazor, although the rest of the pottery is similar to that at the YRP sites. Later, in Iron II, Hazor has a large number of levels which are attributed to the ninth century. Again, the pattern is basically similar to the YRP sites. CP III appears during these phases at Hazor, as do SJ V/b and V/d. However, while CP III continues to the end of the eighth century, CP I seems to disap- pear from the corpus after Stratum IX. During Strata VI and V, dated to the eighth century, rim types similar to C II and C III begin to appear, but these are not identical to the types found in the Jezreel Valley. These differences do not affect the underlying sim- ilarity of ceramic development at the sites, and they 122. Hazor I, II, III-IV; Hazor (above, no. 120). 213</page><page sequence="225">Table 6.

Tell Keisan (Table 7). Located in the Plain of Acco, this site can be considered a close neighbor of the YRP sites. 123 The pottery from Keisan displays differ- ent traits. The cooking pots at Keisan are unique in that although the site was occupied into the seventh century, the late CP III form never appears there. Instead, CP I and CP II occur to the very end of the Iron Age. While C I and C II are common at Keisan, the late C III form also never occurs there. It seems clear that Niveaux 1 1 through 8 at Keisan correspond to Iron I and the tenth century. The excavators suggest that after the ninth century the site was not occupied for 80 years. Little pottery from Niveaux 7 and 6 is published, so that the lack of the characteristic cooking pots and storage jars of the end of the ninth century may be due to the limited finds. In any case, the persistence of the CP I and CP II forms to the very end of the Iron Age attests to the long chronological range of these important forms. Samaria (Table 8). The pottery from the excavations at this site has created a good deal of controversy. The original publication assumed that the site was unoccupied when construction of the capital of Israel began in the early ninth century.124 123. See Keisan (above, n. 97). 1 24.

Found two CP's with marks, no context: 92:24 and 93:50. Soon after publication, clear signs of earlier pottery were noticed, and G.E. Wright has suggested that a tenth century or Iron I occupation preceded the capital city.125 The presence of collared-rim pithoi and the absence of CP III, SJ V/b and V/d in the pottery of phase I support Wright's redating. The pottery from phases II-III must be related to the initial construction of the capital. Phases IV, V and VI represent the later part of the ninth and the eighth centuries. Once again, the presence of CP I and II types attests to the long chronological range of these forms. The earlier rim types of the tenth century hampered by the impossibility of identifying the latest pottery in the make-up of a floor except by reference to the in situ floor deposits which Kenyon argued were not as accurate. In addition, there is no reason to assume that sherds of pottery currently in use were placed in the make-up of the floor during its construction. Any work which follows this metho- dology must be viewed with suspicion. 125. G. Wright, "'Israelite Samaria and Iron Age Chro- nology," BASOR 155 (1962), pp. 13-29. Since the 1960s the dispute over the correct dating has con- tinued. Most authorities support the earlier dates, although a sort of schism has developed and those supporting the Kenyon chronology modify the dat- ing at Megiddo, Hazor and other sites in accordance with the Samaria "evidence."

The preceding comparisons have been summar- ized in Tables 9-11 below. They demonstrate the presence or absence of the main elements of the pot- tery corpus of Qiri and Yoqne'am at the comparison sites in the Iron I, tenth and eighth centuries. The general agreement on the date and range of the most important types is remarkable, and demonstrates the compatibility of the methodology used in this study with earlier practices. In particular, the results for craters, cooking pots and storage jars indicate the accuracy of our conclu- sions regarding the dates of these forms at the YRP sites. The most striking evidence is the presence of C II types at all the comparison sites, except for Hazor. This type, ignored in most of the earlier publications, is widespread, and is probably the single most impor- tant Iron Age crater. The continuation of CP I and CP II into the eighth century at Samaria, Keisan, Hazor and Megiddo is confirmation of the range of the forms at the YRP sites. During Iron II, the CP II form was introduced and increased markedly in popularity, but the earlier forms did not die out. The triangular and pinched CP rim types were standard components of the Iron Age ceramic corpus from the twelfth to the eighth centuries. The situation is similar for storage jars. The pri- mary types continue throughout the Iron Age, and several new types are introduced during Iron II. Table 9.

The ceramic tradition of the Iron Age was remarkably conservative, with the most common forms declining in frequency rather than disappearing completely from the corpus. Only the less frequent and thus less significant forms con- form to the dating standards required by the pres- ence/absence system. Even with these forms, such as Bichrome ware or the Black Juglet, the range of the type is generally much longer than the "historical" periods of the Iron Age, which is generally divided into centuries. Almost all Iron Age ceramic features continued in use far longer than a century. The difficulties of the presence/absence system are clearly demonstrated by the bowl comparisons. One of the best chronological indicators for the Iron Age at the YRP sites is the decline in frequency of the simple rim bowl, accompanied by the rise in fre- quency of the other two main unwidened rim types, the rectangular and bevelled rim bowls, as well as of the widened rim bowls. The simple and widened rim bowls are present, as expected, in all periods at the comparison sites. But the presence of the bevelled and rectangular rim bowls is not as well documented since, due to the limited selection standards followed during excavation, the importance of these forms was not recognized. At the same time, much attention has been focused on the infrequent forms which can meet the standards of the presence/absence system. In the process, the importance of these forms in the Iron Age corpus has inevitably been over-emphasized, and forms that are only one in a hundred or a thousand are studied since their rarity makes them fit subjects for a presence/ab- sence approach. COMPUTER RECORDING SYSTEM FOR POTTERY While the computer recording system devised by the YRP staff is based upon standard computer encoding techniques, it is presented here in some detail both to assist in the interpretation of the analysis that follows and to serve as an example to other scholars in the field, as such systems are not yet commonplace in Syro-Palestinian archaeology. The basic unit of a computer recording system is the record, which contains all the information about each basic element of study - in this case each sherd or vessel. The record is composed of a number of columns (or bytes) in which the information is recorded. Each column is used to record a single letter, number or symbol. The system described here 218 has records with a fixed length of 53 columns. The length of a record should be kept as short as possible, consistent with the need to record all the data required. Records of more than 80 columns in length can result in some special problems. A record is normally divided into fields, which are composed of one or more columns. Each field should always be placed in the same location in each record. The consistent organization of records is vital. The number of columns needed for each field can often be reduced by the use of codes. Computers accept and manipulate two basic kinds of data - alphanumeric and integer. Alphanumeric data include letters, numbers and punctuation marks. Integer data include numbers, the plus and minus signs, and the decimal point. Several sub-types of integer data forms exist for the inclusion of decimal points in integer fields. Each field should have only alphanumeric or integer data. The two kinds of data should not be mixed. If decimal points are used, they should be consistently placed in the same column in the field for every record. The transfer of alphanumeric data (words) into numeric codes is often of great benefit. If properly organized, the codes can greatly reduce the time and effort required to record information. The format of the YRP computer records for pottery underwent a number of revisions before the one described here was defined. Each revision involved the reduction of the length of the record by the use of more coded data. It is advisable to follow two basic principles in coding data for computers. The first is always to be sure to leave sufficient unused codes in the system to allow for new discoveries. Every code in a field should not be assigned at the start of the work. New variations or combinations will always be encoun- tered. The second principle is to avoid the inclusion of independent variables in the same field. For exam- ple, body profiles and bases should not be put in the same field, as not only could one be preserved with- out the other, but the characteristics of neither are dependent on the other. Once the codes are established, it is vital that accu- rate and complete records of the codes be kept. As new codes will probably be added as the data is recorded and new types are discovered, confusion is easily possible if codebooks are not kept up to date. As an example, the YRP codebook has been included in the Appendix. Within these guidelines, the organization of the records, the fields and the codes should be left to the</page><page sequence="230">needs of the individual project. For example, the codes for rim type entered on the computer sheets in the field were directly related to the organization of the YRP rim typology (see Charts 1 and 3 and Appen- dix). Column 22 of the record stands for the vessel or ware type (i.e., 1 = cooking pot, 2 = storage jar, etc.). Column 23 contains the group number taken from the typology. Columns 24 and 25 indicate the type within the group (i.e., Type A = 01, Type B = 02, etc.). These initial codes were easily modified by the com- puter into a continuous set of numbers from 1 to 162 for easier statistical manipulation (see Chart 2). The format and codes presented here are specifi- cally designed for the Iron Age pottery of three sites in Palestine. See the full code in Appendix. The deco- ration of pottery during that period was simple, and for other periods and cultures the codes for decora- tion in particular would need to be expanded. Figurai and even complex geometric decoration is so rare on Iron Age pottery that it can best be studied on an individual basis. Using this system, it was consistently possible to record from 250 to more than 400 records a day in the field. This was usually somewhat faster than the rate at which the sherds were being excavated. Recording included classifying the sherd in question, as well as filling in the appropriate description of the sherd on the computer form. The records were entered into the computer at the rate of between 1 50 to 200 records an hour, when an efficient data entry program was used. All the records are 53 characters long (see Chart 3). The first four fields of the record identify the sherd. The site, year, area of excavation, locus number, basket number, and sherd number are all specified. The fifth field contains the classification of the rim type or period of the sherd if it is not from the Iron Age. The next three fields record the decoration of the piece.

Sharon, J. Yellin, I. Perlman The Hebrew University, Jerusalem Marked Iron Age cooking pots first attracted atten- tion after being found in great numbers by the YRP in the excavations of Tell Qiri and Yoqne'am.1 A. Type All of the marked cooking pots fall into the category designated by Aharoni and Amiran as the "Early Shallow Type."2 This is a broad, relatively shallow vessel, with a carinated body and a rounded base. The rim is inturned and triangular in section. In this report, two subtypes of the "Early Shallow Type" have been distinguished according to the shape of the rim.3 CP I. A triangular and/or slightly convex profile (Nos. 1,3,4, 6-12, 15, 18,21,24-26, 29, 30,32,33,36, 40).4 This type dates to the Iron Age II. CP II.A concave (pinched) profile. This subtype is by far the most common in the tenth century BC (Iron Age II) cooking pots (Nos. 19, 20, 22, 23, 27, 28, 35, 37, 39). There are several triangular rims which are only slightly concave (Nos. 2, 5, 13 14, 16, 17, 31, 34). These fall between our Types I and II. All of the marked cooking pots (Nos. 1-20) are of Type I (triangular profile) or, at most, slightly con- cave. The single exception is No. 19 from Mevorakh. B. Ware In all of the marked cooking pots the ware is brown- grey and the core is black, with many small grits. The single exception is No. 19 from Mevorakh which is reddish in color. It has already been noted that this specimen has a different rim type from the other marked cooking pots. It is, in fact, unique in almost every respect and should be separated from the rest of the group. C. The Marks The pots were incised with a round-tipped instru- ment, 2-4 mm. in diameter, before firing. None of the marks seems to be of letters, though some resemble letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The following marks were found: Sample No. 1 (Fig. 52:6) + 3 Sample No. 2 (Fig. 53:1) M Sample Nos. 3, 14, 17 (Figs. 52:5, 54:6, 7) 'l/ Sample Nos. 4, 8, 9, 11 (Figs. 52:1, 13; 54:1, 2) ....

Geographical Distribution Marked cooking pots have been found at the follow- ing sites: Qiri: Nos. 1-8 Yoqne'am : Nos. 9-17 Mevorakh : Nos. 18-19 (the inclusion of No. 19 in this particular group is doubtful, see above). Megiddo: No. 20 There are several examples which were not included in this study: from Dor, the Raqefet Cave, Ramat Hashofet, Qashish and Shikmona. Marked cooking pots appear to be a phenomenon characteristic of the western part of the Jezreel Valley and the northern Sharon Plain, and centered in the immediate vicinity at Yoqne'am. This study will attempt to deal with the following questions: 1. Were all marked cooking pots manufactured in the same place? 2. Can one or more of the sites represented in the sample (Yoqne'am, Qiri, Megiddo, Mevorakh) be identified as the provenance of these pots? 3. Can pots with different marks be identified with different sources? 4. Did the workshops which produced marked cooking pots also manufacture other cooking pots? (We noted that almost all marked cooking pots have a triangular rim - do cooking pots with triangular rim profiles have a different provenance that those with the more common pinched rim?) METHOD A. Sampling Method Twenty marked cooking pot fragments were chosen for neutron activation analysis. This sample includes all of the marked cooking pots found at Megiddo (1) and Mevorakh (2), and some of those found at Qiri and Yoqne'am. The sample was selected to include at least one of each of the different marks, and as many as possible of the three marks which appear on more than one or two specimens (W, A' and V). Twenty additional cooking pot fragments were selected as a control group to represent the typical compositon of local cooking pot wares of Qiri (Nos. 21-27), Yoqne'am (Nos. 28-34) and Megiddo (Nos. 35-40). For parallels from Mevorakh we chose seven cooking pot fragments (Nos. 41-47) from the Iron Age vessels analyzed and published in Vol. I of the Tel Mevorakh report.5 Unfortunately, the exact typology of these fragments is impossible to deter- mine. All cooking pots of the same assemblage, how- ever,6 are of the same types as the cooking pots of the study and control groups. They have been analyzed by the same laboratory, using the same standards, so that the results are directly comparable.7 The reference material was limited to cooking pots for the following reasons: 1) Cooking pots, which are coarse ware designed for home use, are unlikely to be transported beyond the immediate marketing range of their place of manufacture (neither for their intrinsic value nor for their contents). 2) The ware from which cooking pots are produced ("cooking pot material") is visibly different from that of other coarse wares. This difference is probably due to the special physical properties required for cook- ing ware (e.g., resistance to thermal shock, heat con- ductivity, etc.). While it is not certain that the difference in ware is due to a different clay composi- tion, we attempted to control this possible source of variation by comparing our marked cooking pots Fig. 52 No. Object Reg.

Thus, for example, Y 37 becomes MG 37. In addition, seven cooking pot samples already published (J. Yellin and I. Perlman, "Provenance of Iron Age Pottery from Tel Mevo- rakh, in Mevorakh [Nos. 1-7]) were used as the control group for Mevorakh. These were labelled MV 41 to MV 47 for the purpose of this study.

For the control groups we used only pots of the same period, as far as could be ascertained both through typology and stratigraphical provenance. This was done due to the possibility that in different periods potters at the same site used different clay sources. A single exception - by oversight rather than design - is No. 38, from Stratum Vb in Megiddo (all of the other specimens are from Stratum IVb-Va), which is somewhat earlier. As was noted above, whereas the marked cooking pots are almost exclusively of the triangular rim pro- file type, the control groups for all sites contain both triangular and pinched rim profiles. Neither the study group nor the control groups, however, were sampled randomly, so that no inference can be made from the sample as to the relative proportions of these types in any of the above sites. By the same token, any compo- sitional groupings obtained as a result of this study will infer the existence, but not the relative abun- dance, of pots of these groups in the sites under discussion. B. The Analytic Technique Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) was used as the tool for establishing the provenance of the cooking 229</page><page sequence="241">pots in this study. "Fingerprinting" the chemical composition of pottery by NAA has in recent years been widely used for provenance studies in Palesti- nian archaeology8 and need not be described here in detail. Briefly, the chemical "fingerprint" of a potsherd is determined by measuring the amounts of some 20-30 elements appearing in it - most in minute quantities. This is done by subjecting a sample of each potsherd to neutron irradiation (at the Soreq Nuclear Research Center), by which some of the elements in the sample become radioactive. Each such radioactive element emits gamma radiation at specific wavelengths. The quantity of each such element in the sample can now be determined by measuring the rate of gamma ray emission at its characteristic wavelength and compar- ing it with that of a standard, known amount of each element, which was irradiated with the sample under the same conditions. The resulting "fingerprints" will uniquely identify the source of the clay from which the pot was made. When two or more "fingerprints" match, the pot- sherds are of the same provenance. The opposite, however, is not necessarily true. Potters of the same site may draw clay from different sources. Moreover, different manufacturing techniques applied to clays of the same source may change the chemical compo- sition of the finished products (see below). It has been established empirically that even when more than one chemical composition represents a site, or several sites within the same geological region, the similarity between compositions within the region is greater than that between regions.9 (See below for a more rigorous definition of "similarity.") Whereas NAA has been used most frequently in biblical archaeology to differentiate between local (Palestinian) and foreign (Cypriote, Greek, etc.) wares, the present study seeks to make distinctions within a limited region, and perhaps between work- shops at the same site (if different marks are attribut- able to different workshops). In order to achieve this (assuming the analytic technique is sensitive enough to detect intraregional differences), the control group(s) must be chosen with care and the data analy- sis techniques refined. An implicit assumption usually made in the com- parison of a study group with a control group is that those compositions which appear most frequently at a site are of local manufacture. While this assumption is safe enough when studying patterns of interna- tional or interregional trade, they cannot be made in our case. It is certainly possible, for example, that a single manufacturing center, located at either of these sites, or at a third site nearby, supplied all the local demand for cooking pots for both Yoqne'am and Qiri. C. The Statistical Data Analysis10 In this study Smallest Space Analysis (SSA) is employed to interpret the NAA-produced data instead of the more commonly applied cluster anal- yses. Inherent in both these analyses (and indeed in any interpretation of NAA data) is the concept of "similarity" between compositions. The log- Euclidian distance function is used throughout this study in order to measure the similarity between two samples. In complex studies, it is important to distance one- self from the many hundreds of raw numbers and get a bird's-eye view of the structure of the similarity relations between the sampled wares. This can be done using SSA, which attempts to give a graphic representation of the data, where each sampled sherd is represented as a point in space. The greater the similarity between two sherds, the closer the two 8. I. Perlman and F. Asaro, "Pottery Analysis by Neu- tron Activation," Archaeometry 1 1 (1969), pp. 21-25; M. Artzy, F. Asaro, I.

The interpretation of the diagram thus produced proceeds in three steps: 1. Determination of the minimal dimension in which the diagram can be drawn without too much distortion. 2. Examination of the general shape of the point diagram. 3. Allocation of each point to a group of similar (near) points. (This last step is equivalent to the inter- pretation of cluster analysis.) RESULTS The measurements obtained by NAA for the 47 sampled pieces are given in Tables 13-17. Statistical analysis was performed on the basis of the following eighteen elements - Rb, Cs, Sc, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Yb, Lu, Hf, Th, Ta, Sb, Cr, U, Fe and Co. These have been chosen for their relatively low error values and proven reliability in pottery samples in the past. Next, the log-Euclidian distances between all pairs of cook- ing pot samples were computed and arranged in a distance matrix. SSA was performed upon this matrix. It was found that a two-dimensional picture can represent the similarity/dissimilarity relations between all 47 pieces with little distortion (coefficient of alienation = 0.06). The two-dimensional diagram is given in Fig. 55. The site at which each piece was found is designated (Y = Yoqne'am; Q = Qiri; MG = Megiddo; MV = Mevorakh). All of the incised cook- ing pots are marked with an asterisk or with the Fig. 55. Two-dimensional SSA diagram. 231</page><page sequence="243">incised symbol (W, A' or N/). The mark around the sample number signifies the type of cooking pot - a circle for Type I (triangular or slightly concave rim) and a square for Type II (pinched rim). Analysis of the Diagram We shall now attempt to answer questions 1-4, posed at the beginning of this study. 1) Nearly all of the marked cooking pots form a tight group in the upper lefthand corner (Fig. 55). The two exceptions are No. 19, which was suspect to begin with (see above), and No. 20, whose position on the space diagram is problematic. As it is still closer, however, to this cluster than to any other, it should perhaps be regarded as a variant within the group rather than as belonging to a different source. 2) Most of the control material from Qiri and Yoq- ne'am also falls within the same group. It can there- fore be confidently stated that the workshop manufacturing marked cooking pots was located at Yoqne'am or Qiri (or at a third site in the immediate vicinity) and satisfied most of the demand for cook- ing ware at both sites. This workshop was also engaged in some interregional export. We definitely know that some of its wares (MV 18, MG 20) had reached Mevorakh and Megiddo, and we may assume (though this has not been checked in the present study) that some marked cooking pots trav- elled as far afield as Dor and Shikmona. (It is not clear at this point whether or not the marked pots in the Raqefet Cave and at Qashish are imports or whether those sites were within the Yoqne'am-Qiri marketing sphere.) Two other clearly definable groups present themselves: a. All sampled Megiddo cooking pots (except for the marked pot MG 20, and MG 39 which is proble- matic) form one compositional group and thus appear to have been locally made. Q 22 and Q 27 and possibly Y 31 have a similar composition and were therefore probably produced at Megiddo. Inciden- tally, it appears that the same workshop (or at least one utilizing the same clay source and manufacturing techniques) was also active during the Iron Age I, as is indicated by No. 38 from Stratum Vb. b. The Mevorakh group, while being quite distinct, has much wider variability. This may be due to the fact that less control was exercised while choosing the group (it was meant to be contrasted with Cypriote imports rather than with the much more similar clays 232 of neighboring sites), or to the presence of material from other, as yet unidentified, sources within it. The presence of one cooking pot of composition similar to the Mevorakh group at Qiri (No. 23) is worth noting. This need not imply direct trade between these two small sites. An alternative possibility is that at least some of the Mevorakh material was distrib- uted from a larger coastal marketing center (Dor?) which also exported some of its ware to the Jezreel Valley. Two pieces, No. 39 from Megiddo and No. 34 from Yoqne'am, remain for the present unconnected to any of the groups. 3) The three symbols which appear with relative frequency (W, A' and V ) are specifically marked by their samples. At present, no sub-clustering accord- ing to mark can be distinguished. Possible explana- tions are: a. The marks are not potter marks; b. The marks belong to individual workers within a single workshop; c. There were several workshops, all using the same raw materials and manufacturing techniques. 4) While no absolute rules concerning the distribu- tion of rim types can be made (No. 28 of the Yoqne'am-Qiri compositional group has a pinched rim, and there are several triangular rims in the Megiddo group), the different workshops neverthe- less had strong typological preferences. It is espe- cially noteworthy that out of five pinched rim cooking pots chosen for the control groups at Qiri and Yoqne'am, four proved to be of non-local manu- facture. Thus, even without resorting to NAA of every single sherd, checking the ratio of triangular versus pinched rims in the various sites of the YRP could prove fruitful for the understanding of the mechanisms of the local trade. Finally, the marked cooking pots at Qiri and Yoq- ne'am may allow us to establish a very tentative model for the intra- and interregional marketing of local consumption products. It appears that the market functioned on two levels: a. There were several manufacturing/marketing centers, each of which had a monopoly over a region consisting perhaps of one town and several smaller sites (in our case, Yoqne'am, Megiddo and the center supplying Mevorakh). The great majority of the pro- ducts of such a center were distributed within the region (from Yoqne'am to Qiri, and perhaps Qashish, Raqefet, etc.). Conversely, most of the local demand was supplied by it.</page><page sequence="244">b. On the next level, there existed some reciprocal intraregional trade (e.g., one Yoqne'am- manufactured cooking pot was found at Megiddo, while several made in Megiddo were found at Yoq- ne'am and Qiri). The scope of this trade (as compared with regional manufacture) was small; nor have we noted any difference in the quality of the product. Inability of a local center to meet the market demands, or a wider marketing sphere for a quality product, can therefore both be discounted. The moti- vation for this trade and its exact mechanics remain, at this juncture, unknown. Table 13.

Ben-Tor The Hebrew University, Jerusalem Figs. 56-58 present the most common finds, other than pottery, which are typical of the Iron Age strata at Tell Qiri. These include the following: Spindle-whorls (some may have fulfilled other functions) made of limestone, basalt, clay (reworked potsherds) and bone are common in all Iron Age strata and are very similar to finds from other sites in the country. All have close parallels at the neighbor- ing site of Megiddo, Strata VII- III. 1 Among the metal objects, the axe (Fig. 56:10 = Photo 62) is treated separately (see below, pp.244- 245). All the other metal objects have close parallels at Megiddo.2 The large clay beads (Fig. 57:1-4) are common in the earlier Iron Age strata at Tell Qiri. All the beads have close analogies at Megiddo.3 The large glass bead (Fig. 57:10 = Photo 66) is of special interest.4 Photo 62. Iron axe. With regard to the faience amulet (Fig. 57: 1 1 = Photo 65), see above, p. 86. The bone objects comprise mainly spindle-whorls, spatulae and various pins.5 We could find no parallels for the polished bone object which is pierced by several perforations at both extremities, nor could we determine its function (Fig. 57:20 = Photo 67).

Stech University of Pennsylvania An iron axe from Tell Qiri, most likely of late elev- enth century BC date (Fig. 56:10, Photo 62), was studied metallographically in order to determine how it was made. The axe was found in Area D, on the floor (at 69.10 m.) of Locus 682 (Registry No. 650). A 4 cm.-thick sample was cut from the working end of the blade with a diamond cutoff wheel. Although the axe appeared to be totally corroded, two cores of surviving metal were revealed when it was sectioned (Photo 68). The section was polished following stan- dard metallographic procedures for observation in both the optical and scanning electron microscopes. It was studied in the unetched and etched conditions. 1 In the optical microscope, at a low magnification, a relatively low carbon concentration of about 0.2- 0.3% could be seen in the metal cores (Photo 69). Study at a higher magnification revealed that the characteristic lamellar arrangement of the pearlite was altered. The dispersed pearlitic structure was probably produced by forging the axe at about 730°C (the most likely eutectoid temperature when a bar of iron was being forged into the blade shape).2 The presence of about 0.2-0.3% carbon in the core of the object implies that either carbon accidentally diffused into the iron from pockets of charcoal embedded in the iron or that the artifact was case- carburized, with the core of the object containing the lowest amount of carbon, since, according to the laws of diffusion, the amount of carbon would form a downward gradient from the surface inward. The appearance of the pearlite, i.e., the regular rather than random distribution, suggested that the second alternative was viable. In order to test this hypothesis, a cellulose acetate replica of the corroded portion of the metallographic section was prepared; the replica was treated with evaporated gold to enhance any relic microstructures which might be present. The exami- nation of this replica in the scanning electron micro- scope revealed that the section was more or less completely pearlitic (Photo 70), thus confirming our hypothesis. The existence of homogeneously carburized metal cores and of relic pearlite throughout the metallo- graphic section indicates that the outer layers of the axe were heavily carburized, and therefore strong and able to retain a sharp edge. We cannot specify the length of time which would have been required to achieve the level of carburization seen in the metal cores because the diffusion of carbon is affected by many different factors, including impurities in the iron, nature of the charcoal, heat of the fire, con- stancy of the fire, etc. In a laboratory situation, for example, iron held at 920°C for one hour may have a carbon concentration of 0 to 0.1% 1 mm. below the surface; after four hours, 0.4%; and after nine hours, 0.7%. Because the time necessary to achieve a carbon content of 0.2-0.3% in the core of the artifact would 1. Etchants used were 3% nital (a solution of 3 parts concentrated nitric acid in 100 parts of ethyl alcohol) and picral (picric acid in ethyl alcohol). 2. Steel, an alloy of carbon and iron, with a maximum carbon content of about 2%, consists of a single phase above 910°C. When steel with a carbon content of about 0.8% is cooled below 730°C the single phase decomposes into two phases, one of which is pure iron and the other a compound of iron and carbon called cementite. The ferrite (pure iron) and cementite are arranged in alternate layers and form a product called pearlite - unless the steel is cooled rapidly enough, usually by quenching, to suppress this reaction. 244</page><page sequence="256">Photo 68. Cross-section showing surviving "steel" cores. have been much greater than that required for forg- ing, we conclude that the axe was deliberately case- carburized by being left in a charcoal fire for extended periods of time. Since it is unlikely that the smith of antiquity knew it was the absorption of carbon which strengthened his iron products, he probably had only a pragmatic understanding of the phenomenon, one in which he recognized a relation- ship between fire and the strength of iron. The technological achievement demonstrated by this axe - i.e., deliberate carburization - is paral- leled in a group of iron artifacts from Taanach. Of eleven artifacts of tenth century date, six show detect- able carburization (scythe, plough scraper, plough- share, armor scale and two unfinished tools). It therefore seems reasonable to suggest that steel was being used on a fairly regular basis in the Jezreel Valley by the tenth century BC, although a considera- bly larger group of iron artifacts should be examined before this hypothesis can be confirmed.

Rosen Archaeological Survey of Israel INTRODUCTION Although the lithic assemblage from Iron Age Tell Qiri is not a large one, numbering only some 600 artifacts and fewer than 40 tools (Table 18), the gen- eral scarcity of reports on flint implements from the later historical periods in the Levant, and in the Near East in general, affords the collection some impor- tance by its very existence. While lithic assemblages from the historical periods clearly do not have the potential for cultural analysis, as do ceramic assem- blages, studies of stone tools from these periods can provide important supplementary information on diverse topics such as agriculture, trade, and the development of metallurgy. Thus, while the collec- tion from Tell Qiri in itself may be insufficient to do more than suggest hypotheses with respect to these subjects, when placed in context with the other anal- yses the assemblage assumes an importance greater than its size. DESCRIPTION Sickle Segments. The sickle segments are the typical large geometric types associated with the Iron Age.1 They generally show serrated working edge retouch with sickle gloss,2 backing, and one or two trunca- tions. Four are triangular end pieces, two are paral- lelogram in shape, and the rest are rectangular. The ratio of the end pieces to the medial ones (1:3.25) offers a somewhat lower estimate of the number of Table 18.

The average dimensions are 5.4 x 2.7 x 0.8 cm. Although the average length of the sickle segments from Qiri is somewhat longer than that from other Iron Age assemblages,3 the length distribution and mode are not significantly different (Table 19). Borers . One broken drill with abrupt retouch (probably intrusive) and one borer on a notch were recovered. 1. S.A.

These are crude tools, simply retouched by direct percussion to form a notch or series of notches. Scrapers. The scrapers show little regularity in type. They fall roughly into the following categoiies: one end-scraper, two steep scrapers, one denticulated scraper, and one miscellaneous scraper. Blade Tools. One backed blade and one retouched blade were recovered. Miscellaneous. Seven pieces showed miscellaneous trimming. Debitage. The cores are small, irregular flake cores, generally with only one or two striking platforms. Most of them are made from local wadi cobbles. One is a broken, irregular blade/ bladelet core (probably intrusive). Flakes and blades show little sophistica- tion in preparation. Intrusives. A partial list of intrusive pieces includes five Canaanite sickles, five Chalcolithic sickles, one axe, one adze, one PPNB arrowhead, one PN arrow- head, and one limace. These have not been included in the tool counts in Table 19. The extent of the intrusions is of some importance. Of the 27 total sickle segments recovered, 10 (37%) are clearly intrusive. This suggests that a similar pro- portion of non-diagnostic tools (basically all the 247 Site Type Activity Characteristic Elements quarry collection natural flint, of flint, primary flakes (1), //©) reduction cores (2) 1 2 to cores blank production unretouched production of blade/ blade/flakes (3) ģļ: / site flakes = M / (quarry?) blanks Ę^r Jy 3 secondary retouching blade/flakes in 7 production of blade/ various stages of iřT / site flakes manufacture, up to /v / unused sickle M. /fp; - / segments (4) ^ secondary hafting » unused sickle production segments, in haft (5) site (usually not preserved) fields, use, used sickle segments, g.

When one further considers that data from other sites4 indicate that the proportions of sickles from Chalcolithic and Early Bronze tool assemblages are generally much lower than they are from Iron Age assemblages, then the degree of intrusion is even more pronounced. Table 19. Sickle Segment Length Distribution % 41 24 18 18 N 7 4 3 3 cm. 4-5 5-6 6-7 7-8 DISCUSSION Beyond the mere description of the assemblage, sev- eral conclusions can be drawn from the Qiri lithic collection. As with earlier periods,5 a clear distinction can be drawn between sickle segments and all other tools. The latter can be characterized as ad hoc tools, and are irregular flake tools falling into no genuinely set categories. They seem to have been manufactured quickly, with little more than some immediate task in mind. The flake cores found on the site match the general technology of the tools, and it is likely that they were manufactured on site. Sickle segments, on the other hand, are either trade items or the result of specialized manufacture taking place on an as yet unexcavated part of the site. This is evidenced by the absence of cores suitable for the manufacture of the blade-flakes used in sickle manu- facture, as well as by the absence of the unworked blade-flakes themselves. To help illustrate the rea- soning behind this conclusion, Fig. 59 presents a model of the stages of manufacture and use of Iron Age sickles. This model is supported by work on other sites6 as well as that at Qiri. Comparison of the Qiri assemblage to that of other historical sites suggests that by the Iron Age, when metal became relatively commonplace, flint had been replaced for most domestic purposes. It is important to stress that this contrasts sharply with the Early Bronze Age, at a time when lithic implements con- tinued to play an important role in many activities.7 Specifically, the high proportion of sickle segments in the Qiri assemblage (44.7%) is far greater than that generally associated with Early Bronze Age assem- blages, generally comprised of 5-15% sickle seg- ments.8 If some adjustment in the figures is made to account for the high percentage of intrusives, and if one assumes that a similar proportion of the non- diagnostic pieces is intrusive, then the sickle segment percentage rises to 57%. As mentioned earlier, other roughly contemporary collections show even higher sickle percentages, and it is likely that 57% is still too low. Regardless of the absolute number, this relative abundance of sickles, and the lesser number of other tool types, indicate the increasing restriction in the use of flint as a raw material. The continued use of sickles, even in a period when iron and bronze were readily available, is indicative of the high quality of a flint cutting edge, the general efficiency of a flint sickle,9 and the easy availability of flint as a raw material. Finally, on a somewhat obvious level, the presence of sickle segments, unambiguously identifiable as such due to the presence of sickle gloss,10 is a clear indication of agricultural activities. Thus, analysis of the Qiri lithic assemblage, as small as it is, still provides important insights into Iron Age society. Further collection and analysis from other sites from this period could help us refine these ideas, and perhaps add to them. 4.

Davis, Dept. of Zoology The Hebrew University, Jerusalem All the faunai remains from the 1975-76 seasons of excavations at the Iron Age site of Tell Qiri were examined. Artiodactyl bones were identified and classified according to the state of fusion of their epiphyses and the side of the body they came from: right or left. They include posterior mandible frag- ment/lower third molar; scapula; distal humerus, radius, metacarpus, femur, tibia and metatarsus; cal- caneum; astragalus and third phalanx. Sieving was not carried out at Qiri; the quantitative data must therefore be treated with caution, since a bias favor- ing larger skeletal elements is to be expected. The aim of this analysis was to discover which animals were utilized at Qiri and in what frequency, as well as the age distribution of the sheep/goat. RESULTS The dominant food animals represented are the sheep and goat (Table 20). Cattle, pig, fallow deer, gazelle, donkey and bear were also represented. Bones of sheep and goat are difficult to separate, and such Table 20.

Cattle were no doubt of economic importance, and the presence of fallow deer and gazelle bones point to some hunting activity as well. A large proportion of the sheep and goat were culled while still young (Tables 22-23). The absence of sieving explains the low recovery of such unfused epiphyses such as humeri, radii, tibiae and metapo- dia; the proportion of juveniles deduced from these must therefore be minimal. Notwithstanding this bias, at least 26% of the capro vines were culled before the age of 5-7 months, when the coracoid fuses to the scapula,1 and 59% before two years of age, when the distal femur fuses. Table 24 presents the raw data for five interesting loci which, according to A. Ben-Tor (personal com- munication), were ritual areas in which mainly right sheep/goat forelimbs are represented. This indicates a probable cultural preference for a particular part of the anatomy in the early Iron Age sacrificial rites. In addition to the mammals, numerous large tele- ost vertebrae and bones were found; these include a Sap rid as well as a species of Epinephelus identified by Prof. Haas of the Department of Zoology. Numerous valves of the Mediterranean - Glycimeris sp. (mol- lusca) were found, as well as Conus of mediterraneus and the fresh water Melanopsis praemorsa. Table 23.

Waisel Department of Botany, Tel Aviv University INTRODUCTION Tell Qiri is located near Hazorea, in the western Jezreel Valley, by the foothills of the Carmel Moun- tains. An important crossroad running from Acco eastward to Beth Shean, and the road from Jaffa to Acco, pass near the mound. The mound is situated in the Mediterranean phyto- geographical region. The average amount of rainfall is about 600 mm. Trees and shrubs, such as Quercus calliprinos, Quercus ithaburensis, Pistacia palaestina and Olea europaea, appear in this district. The geographical location of Tell Qiri offers attractive material for the investigation of the com- position of vegetation at the site in ancient times. MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant material was obtained from collections made during the excavations at the mound. It included charred pieces of wood and charred fruits and seeds. Samples of charred wood measuring about 1 cm3 each were taken for examination. The samples were aspirated in absolute alcohol, dipped in methyl ben- zoate celloidin solution for 24 hours and in benzene for 20 minutes, and afterwards transferred to 50°-55° C paraffin for 48-96 hours. Blocks were prepared and 10 n -thick sections were cut with a sliding micro- tome. Cross and longitudinal sections were prepared. Anatomical examination of the wood was made from these sections. Samples taken from live trees were used for reference. Excavated fruit and seed samples were compared to fruits and seeds which were recently collected. Specimens were identified and classified according to species, locus and basket. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS Four species of trees and five species of edible fruits were identified in the material collected (Tables 25- 26). Of these, the olive tree ( Olea europaea) was most common and accounted for a high percentage of the fruit samples and about half of the wood samples (Photos 71, 75). Olea europaea is indigenous to the Mediterranean region. Olive trees today grow naturally in the Car- mel, Galilee and Gilead, but most of the trees are cultivated. Abandoned olive groves appear all over the Mediterranean region. Our findings suggest that olives were common in the Tell Qiri region also 3,000 years ago. Support for this assumption can be found also in the results of the analysis of the botanical remains from Tel Taanach, 1 where remnants of olive wood and kernels were most common in layers from the Early Bronze, Middle Bronze, Late Bronze and Iron Ages. Another wood species which was identified and constituted about half the wood samples gathered at Tell Qiri was oak (Quercus calliprinos) (Photo 72). Quercus calliprinos is one of the main constituents of the maquis, together with Pistacia palaestina. This type of maquis is very characteristic of the Mediterra- nean mountain region of Israel, from Hebron to the Upper Galilee and Golan Heights. It also appears in Gilead and Edom.

Pistacia palaestina , together with Quercus calliprinos, constitute one of the main communities of the hilly Mediterranean region. It appears in all maquis and garigues in the north, central and east districts of Israel. Populus euphratica today grows on the site itself, but the trees are cultivated. The nearest natural population of Populus euphratica trees today inhabits part of the Jordan River banks. The wood remnants of Populus euphratica were probably brought to the area also in the past. Olea europaea , Quercus calliprinos and Pistacia palaestina represent Mediterranean climatic condi- tions and their presence at Tell Qiri 3,000 years ago suggests that the same conditions then prevailed in this area as well.

Seeds of wheat ( Triticum sp.), pomegranate (Punica granatum), vetch (Vicia sp.) and peas (Pisum sp.) were also found (Photo 75). These cultivated species can also be cultivated in this region today. However, even though the seeds were collected on the mound, one must be aware of possible contamination in other layers by ants, rodents, etc. Such redoturba- tion co,uld have moved recent seeds into old strata and vice versa. Nevertheless, the appearance of most seeds was different from the recent ones and thus seems to be valid. The fact that the same plant species which inhabit the area today also occupied it in the past supports the conclusions of our previous dendroarchaeologi- cal investigations, i.e., that the flora of our region was quite stable. The results obtained in the arid Negev as well as in the more humid Mediterranean region suggest that the macroclimate of the entire area has remained stable for the last 4,500 years. 2.

Ben-Tor Artifacts of definite Late Bronze Age date were unearthed in scattered places on the site, especially in Areas D and G. None of these objects was complete nor were they found in situ. The Late Bronze Age is thus represented at Tell Qiri by a handful of clearly dated objects as well as by some whose attribution to this period is possible, but not certain. There is no trace of architecture datable to this period, so that we are dealing here with one of the "periods" of the site, and not with a "stratum." This period should be placed somewhere between Stratum IX of the early Iron Age and Stratum X of the Middle Bronze Age. It is difficult to establish whether the Late Bronze Age was ever represented at the site by any architec- tural phases. In several places walls and foundations of the Iron Age penetrate deep into earlier strata, sometimes reaching the remains of the Neolithic period and causing extensive damage to all earlier strata (see especially Area G). Considerable damage was caused to the walls of the Middle Bronze Age, and a great number of stones were robbed by the builders of the Iron Age village. There is therefore a possibility that all the architectural remains of the Late Bronze Age were totally destroyed by later strata. It should also be pointed out that most Late Bronze Age objects came from loci of Strata VIII-IX, i.e., from the early Iron Age occupation of the site. On the other hand, the assumption that a stratum, walls and floors could have completely vanished without leaving a trace seems a bit far-fetched. Another explanation for the absence of any Late Bronze architectural remains in the excavated area may be that the artifacts were brought from the near vicinity to the place where they were recovered, as part of fill material. It can perhaps be assumed that the extent of the Late Bronze occupation of the site was more limited than that of later periods, and may be located in a part of the site that was not excavated. Despite these uncertainties, the group of Late Bronze artifacts recovered at Tell Qiri is of an inter- esting character (Fig. 60). Out of a mere handful of finds, two are of Mycenaean origin (Fig. 60:4-5); one, too small to illustrate, is Cypriote Base-Ring ware, or perhaps Base-Ring I two are fragments of Bichrome ware (Fig. 60:7, a small fragment, may depict a bird's leg; the other is too small to illustrate); another is a fragment of an alabaster vessel (Fig. 60:8, Photo 76); and the last fragment is of a faience bowl (Fig. 60:9). In addition to these, a small number of sherds of local origin were also recovered. Among these was a jug of the local painted ware (Fig. 60:1, with an unusual painted decoration on the neck), a shoulder of what appears to be a biconical jug (Fig. 60:2), a handle of a storage jar or of a crater decorated with crossed lines (Fig. 60:3), and what appears to be a local imitation of a stirrup vase (Fig. 60:6). Some other stray sherds decorated in the local painted style may also belong to the Late Bronze group of finds. These, however, may possibly date to Iron I, as is indicated by other finds from the Jezreel Valley, in Strata VIIA-VIA at neighboring Megiddo, or even in Strata VIII/IX at 1. I wish to thank Professor Trude Dothan of the Insti- tute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University for discussing the Qiri Late Bronze Age material with me, as well as for her important comments and suggestions concerning the other ceramic assemblages of the site. 257</page><page sequence="269">Qiri (Figs. 16:1, 19:8, 20:10). In any case, the objects depicted in Fig. 60 are unequivocably of Late Bronze date. The composition of the group of finds is especially interesting in that it includes representatives of var- ious groups of luxury wares such as alabaster and faience vessels as well as imports from Mycaenae and Cyprus. The Bichrome ware should also be consid- ered high quality ceramics, while the more mundane local wares, which usually constitute the majority of finds, are conspicuously few. It is difficult to offer a convincing explanation for this phenomenon. It does, however, reflect the comparative affluence of the community living at the site at the time, which is also evident from finds of earlier as well as later periods at Tell Qiri. With regard to dating the finds, since we are deal- ing here with only small fragments, all of which were found out of context, it is difficult to determine whether they belong to one period or to a longer range. A date in the first half of the period - LB I and early LB II - seems reasonably appropriate for this group of objects. It was already noted that the Cypri- ote fragment apparently belongs to Base-Ring I, and an early date in the Late Bronze Age is also suggested by the Bichrome fragments. The Mycenaean pieces appear to be Myc. IIIA, though Myc. HIB cannot be excluded. The Chocolate and Egg-shell wares found in MB II loci (Figs. 61:13, 63:4) may have originated in the assemblage under discussion (and if so, should be considered intrusive in the loci in which they were discovered) and support an early Late Bronze date for our assemblage. The alabaster and faience fragments have clear parallels in contexts dating to the Egyptian 18th dy- nasty.2 It should be pointed out, however, that a later date within the Late Bronze Age is also possible for some of the fragments. If this is indeed the case, then tne "Late Bronze Age" assemblage at Tell Qiri can be considered to have contained representatives of the entire range of the period. 2. W.

Ben-Tor THE STRATIGRAPHIC CONTEXT The remains that can be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age at Tell Qiri are rather poor. Only in the eastern part of the site, in Areas C-D-E, were Middle Bronze remains encountered in situ , while in Areas A2, B and F, Middle Bronze pottery was found mixed with that of the Iron Age. The Iron Age walls pene- trated to a great depth, causing considerable damage to the earlier remains. One of the reasons for this, in addition to the desire to found the Iron Age walls on bedrock, was stone-robbing, which may have been one of the causes for the disappearance in many places of walls earlier than the Iron Age. In Area F, for example, where a large amount of Middle Bronze pottery was recovered, the Iron Age walls penetrated as far down as the level of the remains of the late Neolithic period." Nothing, therefore, can be stated regarding the extent of the Middle Bronze Age settlement at Tell Qiri. Based on the remains recovered, the settlement of this period appears to have been somewhat smaller than that of the Iron Age, and if so, it was confined to the eastern half of the site. The only loci clearly attributable to the Middle Bronze Age are the following: Area C. L. 604: Beneath Loci 581 + 569 of the Iron Age, two very large boulders were encountered (Plan 48, Photo 77). One boulder was huge, with dimen- sions of 1.75 X 0.80 X 1.05 m.! Because of the restricted area available for excavation, very little is known of their function other than they seem to have belonged to a very large building. No floor was discerned, but the ceramic assemblage is exclusively Middle Bronze. AreaD. L. 1123(+L. 1086) in Square E-F/17 dates to the Middle Bronze Age. Here, too, the area exca- vated is rather small, measuring 3 x 3 m. L. 1080, immediately above L. 1123, is the earliest in the sequence of Iron Age loci in this spot, and the ceramic material found on the tempered earth floor of L. 1 123 is exclusively Middle Bronze. The floor cannot be related to any walls, probably due to the small area excavated here. Area E. Several loci of Middle Bronze date are located in the section excavated in the steep eastern slope of the site (see Plans 64-66). L. 513 (=L. 509) is a floor related to W.60. W.90 and its floor (=L. H) also belong to this phase, as is indicated by the orientation of the two walls, which may have been connected by W. 90A, and by the identical level of the two floors relating to the two walls. W. 59, W. 70 and W. 89 are clearly later (Iron Age!). L. 514 and L. G. L. 514 undoubtedly belongs to a later stage than L. 513 (+L. H): The floor of L. 514 is 70 cm. higher than the floor of the adjacent L. 513. In L. G the excavations ceased without reaching a floor, and probably stopped some 10-20 cm. above it. It should be noted that even though the loci were located on a slope, L. 514 as well as L. G are close to L. 513 and on the same topographical level of the slope. No wall can be attributed with certainty to this phase, which is the uppermost of the Middle Bronze phases in Area E. W. 69 is a possible candidate. W. 74 represents the earliest Middle Bronze ele- ment in Area E. This wall was found to extend beneath W. 90A. No floor was discerned here but the entire ceramic assemblage at this spot (L. 538) is Middle Bronze or earlier. It thus seems that two, or possibly three phases of the Middle Bronze Age can be distinguished in Area E: The upper phase, represented by L. 514, L. G and possibly W. 69; the middle phase, represented by L. 513, L. H and W. 60, W. 90 and W. 90A; the lower phase, represented by L. 538 and W. 74. W. 62 was at first thought to be part of a defensive system - a wall or stone revetment - while, in fact, it seems to have been no more than a layer of stones 260</page><page sequence="272">covering the slope, which represented the collapse and disintegration of walls that originally stood higher up the slope. We arrived at this conclusion for the following reasons: First of all, W. 62 has no inner or outer face. Secondly, its total thickness, over the entire 4 x 2.5 m. in which it was cleared, consists of only one course of quite small stones. Even W. 90 and W. 60, which clearly belong to ordinary houses, are built of larger stones. Finally, this stone layer cannot belong to any of the Middle Bronze phases which were distinguished because W. 90A of the middle phase clearly runs over it and W. 74 of the early phase extends beneath it. W. 173 also clearly extends under W. 62, but this wall, with L. 536-537, belong to the Early Bronze/Neolithic range at Tell Qiri. Photo 77. MB II "boulder-wall" in Area C (L. 604).

Among the carinated bowls, the closed type is dominant (Fig. 61:8-12), whereas the open cari- nated bowl is entirely absent. The high proportion of red-slipped and burnished bowls (Fig. 61:9, 10, 12) and bowls with gutter rims (Fig. 61:11, 12) is note- worthy. These characteristics apparently indicate an early date in MB II, somewhere in MB IIA or in the MB II A-B period of transition. This date is also indicated by the complete absence of the simple bowls with a rounded and inverted rim,1 which are especially typical of the later phases of MB II. All the shapes included in the typological chart (Fig. 61:1-12) have close affinities to MB IIA contexts at such sites as Aphek, Tel Poleg, Tel Zeror, Tell Burga, and others.2 The Megiddo parallels of Strata XIV-XIII should be treated with caution,3 since most of them origi- nated in tombs whose stratigraphie attribution is not always certain. It should be noted, however, that several bowl forms typical of MB IIA are missing in the Qiri assemblage, e.g., the bowls with modelled rim which are usually painted red,4 and the ridged- rim bowls.5 It therefore seems that some typical MB IIA bowl forms are missing at Qiri, as are also a number of form typical of MB IIB. This phenom- enon can apparently be explained by the fact that the Qiri assemblage is small and not representative and, accordingly, more weight should therefore be given to types that are present rather than to those that are missing. A problem is created by two bowl bases that should be definitely attributed to a late phase of MB II, i.e., to MB IIC. One base belongs to the Egg-shell ware group and the other to the Chocolate ware group (Fig. 61:13-14). If it could be established that both 1 . D. P.

However, both of these pieces are small, isolated fragments, and they can, in effect, also be attributed to the LBI, which is clearly represented at Qiri by a number of sherds.6 Craters Almost all of the Tell Qiri craters have affinities to MB IIA or MB IIA/B contexts at other sites.7 Though Fig. 61:22 is difficult to match, the Tell Qiri crater with an incised rim (Fig. 61:20) has a close parallel at Achziv.8 It should be noted, however, that some of the craters (especially Fig. 61:15-19) also appear in MB IIB contexts.9 For craters of C I type, see below. Cooking Pots The Tell Qiri cooking pots have clear parallels in contexts of the entire MB II. The cooking pot with upright walls (Fig. 62:1-3) is quite frequent at Qiri (which may perhaps indicate a relatively early date within MB II). The ridge is rather low (i.e., distant from the rim) and is neither wavy nor decorated with thumb impressions - a feature which 6. See above and Figs. 61:13-14; 63:4. The Chocolate ware base was found in L. 604, which clearly belongs to MB II; it originated, however, in a basket which came from a high level within the locus, and therefore may not belong to the locus to which it was attributed. 7.

Similar cooking pots are known from MB IIA,10 as well as from MB IIB contexts.11 The cooking pots with gutter rim (Fig. 62:4-6) are quite common in the early stage of MB II, while those with a slightly triangular rim (Fig. 62:7-8) become more common only by the end of the period. The Qiri assemblage appears to be too small to allow us to deduce a chronological significance from the fact that the gutter rim type appears in much greater quantity than the triangular rim cooking pot. Many parallels for both types can be found in MB IIA as well as MB IIB contexts, at sites such as Aphek, Tell Burga, Tel Zeror, Shechem, Megiddo, etc.12 Our C I crater type has a rim profile similar to that of the cooking pots, and they are classified as "craters" and not "cooking pots" because they were produced from a different kind of clay. This type, which can be defined as a hybrid crater/cooking pot with pointed, outturned or rolled rims (Fig. 61:15, 16, 17), respectively, are quite common in MB IIA/B assemblages.13 The bak- ing tray with incised base (Fig. 63:23) is also encoun- tered throughout MB II.14 Storage Jars The storage jars from Tell Qiri can be divided into two distinct groups: SJ I, the very fine type (Fig. 62:9-11, 13-16), and SJ II, the massive type which resembles the pithos (Fig. 62:17-22). A transitional jar (Fig. 62:12) is reminiscent of the large storage jars common in EB III. 10. Kochavi, Beck and Gophna (above, n. 2), Figs. 4:13; 7:16; 11:7-8; 18:14. 11.

The same combing also appears on some of the massive jars (SJ II). Unlike the fine jars, these are elongated, usually handleless vessels. They first appear in MB IIA and continue throughout MB IIB. 17 A large group of these vessels is known from an MB IIB context in neighboring Tell Qashish.18 Its popularity increases progressively dur- ing the MB IIB, so that the statistical data for the number of SJ II jars, relative to the overall number of storage jars in a given context, can serve as a chrono- logical indicator, It should be pointed out that the storage jar with ridged rim, which is apparently typi- cal only of MB IIB, 19 is completely absent at Tell Qiri. Jugs and Juglets These types are represented in the Qiri assemblage by only a very small number of fragments. The only jug type uncovered has a thickened gutter rim (Fig. 62:23-24). It is not always easy to distin- guish between jugs and juglets of this type, which occur throughout the MB II.20 None of the other typical jugs of the period, including those with a simple or trefoil mouth, is present at the site, proba- bly due to the limited nature of the assemblage. The same is also true for the juglets. Only rims of the large, oval and generally undecorated variant were found (Fig. 62:29). Juglets with a narrow neck and oval- or pear-shaped body are lacking, as far as is indicated by the rims. However, several fragments of bases (especially Fig. 62:31-32) seem to definitely belong to these juglets. 15.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS It should be emphasized that the material attribut- able to the MB II at Tell Qiri is extremely fragmen- tary. The architectural remains almost completely disappeared: their stones were probably robbed by the builders of the Iron Age settlement. Even where MB II remains were found in situ, their proper exca- vation was hampered by the limited space and by the fact that the excavation was a rescue operation. Accordingly, beyond the established fact that Qiri was indeed inhabited during the MB II, the following conclusions should be treated with considerable reservation. a) The extent of the settlement cannot be deter- mined with certainty. It seems, however, that it was somewhat smaller than that of the Iron Age, and was confined to the eastern part of the site. b) The settlement was probably not fortified. In the section excavated on the eastern slope of the site, where fortifications would be expected, the remains of private dwellings were encountered and there was no space whatsoever for fortifications. c) Three clear architectural phases of the MB II could be discerned. d) The ceramic assemblage, small as it is, is quite diverse in character. The comparative study seems to indicate that most parallels come from MB IIA con- texts or the MB II A/B transition stage. After comple- tion of the excavations, an MB IIA tomb containing a rich ceramic assemblage was discovered at the foot of the site and excavated by E. Meyerhof of Kibbutz Hazorea.21 Nevertheless, several of the ceramic types continue into MB IIB, making a clear-cut chronolog- ical determination difficult. e) An initial comparison of the MB II material found at the three sites, Tell Qiri, Tell Qashish and Tel Yoqne'am, can perhaps be attempted here. It should be stressed that, unlike Tell Qiri, extensive remains of the MB II period were encountered and excavated at the other two sites. Therefore, a priori , comparison of the material from these two sites with that of Qiri is problematic. Even though the excava- tion of the relevant strata has just begun at Yoq- ne'am, the ceramic assemblage unearthed there is already revealed to be the most impressive of the three sites. The Yoqne'am material with certainty dates to MB IIB/C, later than the date suggested for Tell Qiri. The ceramic material uncovered at all of the three MB II strata at Tell Qashish is extremely poor in comparison with that of Yoqne'am as far as quality of ware and diversity of types are concerned. This situation may reflect the city/village relationship between these two sites. However, the Tell Qashish material is inferior even in comparison with the pottery found in the village of Qiri, in spite of the fact that the area excavated, and the absolute number of vessels found at Qashish, including complete ones, exceeds by far those of Tell Qiri. In this preliminary comparison between the two village sites it is important to note that whereas Tell Qashish was fortified, Tell Qiri was definitely not. Tell Qiri was apparently the more affluent of the two sites, a superiority that is also reflected by the finds of all the subsequent periods during which both sites were occupied. The possibility that the unfortified (MB IIA/B) settlement at Qiri preceded the fortified (MB IIB/C) one at Qashish seems reasonable, though one cannot rule out the possibility that the two sites coexisted. f) Two MB II sherds from Tell Qiri are especially noteworthy. One, of Cypriote origin, is most proba- bly a fragment of a jug of the Red-on-Black group (Fig. 65:1). The other is a fragment of a large jar decorated with a grey/black burnished slip and incised lines (triangles?) and dots (Fig. 65:2). Due to the large dimensions of the vessel, which can be deter- mined by the thickness of the sherd and its shape, its attribution to the Tell el-Yehudiyeh group is quite doubtful, though it indeed shows some affinity to this group. g) A very small number of sherds, all of which were found out of context, are clearly dated to MB I (Fig. 65:3-4). Several tombs of this period, found in the immediate vicinity of the site, were excavated in recent years by E. Meyerhof.22 The MB I is one of the "periods" represented at Tell Qiri, and due to the absence of any in situ remains it was not assigned a stratum number. 21. As yet unpublished.

Baruch Hebrew University, Jerusalem INTRODUCTION Before beginning the detailed description of the finds of the Early Bronze, Chalcolithic and Neolithic peri- ods, some clarification is required concerning the chronological terminology employed in this report. Our chronological subdivision is based first and fore- most on the pottery typology. The terminology here basically follows that of Amiran.1 In her book, how- ever, she does not subdivide the Neolithic into stages. Thus the term Late Neolithic is applied here in the sense used by Moore.2 This corresponds to Kaplan's Chalcolithic - Wadi Rabah stage,3 and to Dunand's Neolithic Recent.4 The term Chalcolithic is applied here in the sense used by Amiran,5 which corresponds to Kaplan's Chalcolithic-Ghassulian stage. The term Early Bronze I (EB I) also follows Amiran.6 The typological subdivision of the pottery as well as of the lithic assemblage, proposed below, is sup- ported at Tell Qiri by stratigraphical evidence only to a limited extent. This is the result of the gap of nearly two millennia which existed in Areas E and G follow- ing the EB I. Thus throughout Areas E and G the lowest levels contained Late Neolithic sherds almost exclusively. However, whenever later materialise., Chalcolith- ic - EB I) appeared, it was usually stratigraphically inseparable from the earlier material. 1. R.

An assemblage of Late Neolithic sherds mixed with a small quantity of Chalcolithic and EB I material began to appear at the level of 62 m. and ceased at 60.68 m. Below that the layer was sterile. Segments of two different walls were encountered; neither however could be fully exposed due to the limitations imposed upon the extent of the area that could be excavated in this part of the mound. The two segments, W. 171 and W. 173 (Plan 64), were constructed in similar fashion - two parallel lines of fieldstones with a fill of smaller stones in between. W. 171 was built of a single course of flat stones; its northwest end was found suspended in "mid-air," its assumed continuation apparently de- stroyed by a later disturbance. In W. 173 two stone courses could be observed, of which only the upper course could be fully exposed. This wall, too, was destroyed at its northwest end, its assumed continua- tion forming an almost right angle with the assumed continuation of W. 171. However, because of the considerable difference in level it is highly question- able whether the two walls formed part of the same building. Area G (Plan 67) The excavated area here was 75 sq. m. Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic sherds mixed with some EB I sherds Photo 78. Neolithic walls and silo (L. 1884) in Area G. began to appear at the level of 70 m., i.e., immediately below the tenth century BC remains. In the southern part of the excavation area, bedrock was reached directly beneath the remains of the tenth century (L. 1883 A). Over most of the area, however, bedrock was reached 85-90 cm. beneath the tenth century remains. In various parts of the area foundations of walls and other installations belonging to the Iron Age levels had penetrated deep into the Late Neolithic level (W. 411-W. 414, L. 1878, L. 1889). Architectural remains that could be associated with the Late Neolithic level were uncovered in the northern part of the area. Locus 1879 Wall W. 404 is composed of two courses, each con- sisting of two small stones. Its northwest end con- tinued into the western balk of the dig. Wall W. 409, parallel to and c. 2.5 m. to the east of W. 404, was composed of a single course of somewhat larger stones, forming a single row; its northeast end must have been destroyed by an Iron Age pit (L. 1878). It is very likely that the two walls delineated a small yard (L. 1890), but no traces of the enclosing walls were found. Locus 1884 An intact conical silo was uncovered at the northeast corner of L. 1890 (Photos 78-79). It was constructed of small rectangular flat stones which were placed upright, tilting slightly beyond its outer diameter, measuring 75 cm. The bottom of the silo was paved with similar small stones mixed with pebbles. Inside the silo two large identical vessels were found, one of Photo 79. Neolithic walls and silo (L. 1884) in Area G. 275</page><page sequence="287">which could be completely restored (Fig. 68:22), and an assemblage of seventeen flint tools consisting of axes, adzes, chisels and several smaller artifacts (see below). Wall W. 413: A row of six large plano-convex stones, 1.5 m. long and about 60 cm. wide, lay in a northwest-southeast direction immediately to the west of W. 409 and about 20 cm. below its base (Photo 79). Locus 1909 These remains consisted of a floor segment built of very small flat and angular stones about 10 x 10 cm. The total floor section measured 90 x 25 cm. It was found close to the northeast corner of the square, immediately to the east of L. 1878 (the Iron Age pit). Stratigraphically, it was lower than W. 409 and may have thus belonged to the level of W. 413. Locus 1883 Close to the northern edge of the ledge formed by bedrock, which separated L. 1883A from L. 1883B in the southern part of the area, a mortar was found cut into bedrock about 30 cm. deep, approximately in the center of the ledge (Photo 80). On the same ledge, less than two meters west of the mortar, a limestone pestle was found lying on the rock surface. THE POTTERY The Late Neolithic Period (Figs. 66-68, Photos 81-83) Most of the Late Neolithic pottery from Tell Qiri was uncovered in Areas E and G, where it was found mixed with later, Chalcolithic and EB I material. This mixture was no doubt the result of the erosional gap which occurred in both areas following the EB I. Thus in both areas the sorting of the pottery into the three different periods was based solely on typological criteria and not on stratigraphy. Photo 80. Neolithic mortar cut into bedrock (L'. 1883) in Area G. Assemblages similar to the one under discussion have been uncovered at Ain el-Jerba,7 Wadi Rabah Levels B-C,8 Lod Area B,9 Tuleilat Batashi, Level III,10 Neve-Yam,11 and the PNB level at Jericho.12 Other parallels come from the Late Neolithic levels at Byblos13 and from assemblages ascribed to the Ard Tlaili and Jisr stages in the Beqa'a.14 The characteristic features of this pottery were described by Kaplan,15 who also noted its close affinities with the pottery of Tell Halaf.16 The resemblance between the pottery from the above- mentioned sites and that of Tell Qiri is expressed both in its distinctive finish as well as in the choice of types and forms. The vessels are made of an extremely gritty clay, that is soft and disintegrates easily due to the low quality of its firing. All the vessels were handmade and finely smoothed prior to firing. The most characteristic feature of this pottery is its slip, which is either red, brown or black, and which appears on most of the V-shaped bowls and on some of the storage jars and hole-mouth jars.

This is well attested in the Tell Qiri assemblage by the V-shaped bowls, the inner walls of which are covered with a red slip, while the outer walls, excluding the rim, are almost entirely blackened (Fig. 66:1). A similar phenomenon was also observed at Ain el-Jerba.19 Bowls and Craters The most common type bowl is the V-shaped, flat- based type of which several variants were encountered (Fig. 66:1, 2, 6-12). The dominant variant has a sharp rim with a slight inward curve (Fig. 66:11). Most of the variants of the V-shaped bowl have parallels in the above-mentioned assemblages.20 Another, much less common type, is the bowl with the inward curving wall (Fig. 66:3-5); similar types were found at Lod,21 Neve-Yam,22 and Byblos.23 Another common type is the hole-mouth jar (Fig. 67). Parallels for this type, which has several variants, were found at Ain el-Jerba,24 Tuleilat Batashi,25 Neve-Yam,26 Jericho27 and Byblos.28 Most of the hole-mouth jars lack a slip; their walls, however, were finely smoothed and some display a thumb decoration on a band of clay attached to the outer wall of the vessel (Fig. 67:16). The herringbone decoration (Fig. 66:13) is another characteristic feature of the late Neolithic pottery assemblages.29 Jars The most common type is the jar with high outward tilting rim of which several variants were encountered (Fig. 68:1-4, 7-20). Similar forms have been found at Ain el-Jerba30 and Jericho.31 The bowl-rim type (Fig. 68:5, 6, 22) is also a characteristic feature of the Late Neolithic pottery, as is evident from the fact that it was found at each and every one of the above- mentioned assemblages.32 Of special interest is the complete jar (Fig. 68:22), which was found intact together with fragments of another, identical vessel in the silo of Area G (L. 1884, Photos 81-82). 17.

The bulk of this material, which consisted mainly of bowls, originated in Area G. These bowls (Fig. 69:1-11) are rather crude and are made of very gritty and poorly-fired clay. They are characterized by thick walls and a broad, rounded or flat rim. Most are without slip (Fig. 69:5-10); some, however, have a bright red or faint orange-like thin wash, completely unlike the dark thick slip of the bowls ascribed to the Late Neolithic period. Similar 284 shades of slip or wash also appear on some of the closed forms (Fig. 69:12-16). These were made of a finer clay than the bowls, their walls are much thinner, and their firing is of a much higher quality. It should be noted that none of the these forms was found in Area G. Other finds ascribed to the Chalcolithic period, found in Area G and elsewhere on the mound, include churn handles (Fig. 69:20-21, Photo 84:6), small lug handles (Fig. 69:18, 19) and a few cornet bases (Fig. 69:17, Photo 84:8).</page><page sequence="296">Fig. 69.

Most of the EB I material, however, was found dispersed in various loci, in other areas of the mound, most notably in Area D where it was mixed with much later material. The most common types ascribed to the EB I are hole-mouth jars (Fig 70:1-5, 13-20). They were made of a high-quality, well-fired clay with few grits, and had a faint slip or wash in bright shades of brown or red. Most of the types of hole-mouth jars found at Tell Qiri have parallels at Afula33 and Beth Shean XVI-XIV.34 33. E.L. Sukenik, Archaeological Excavations at Afula (Jerusalem, 1948), PI. III. 34. G.M.

Accordingly, an axe is a bifacial tool with a symmetrical (biconvex) cross- section and a symmetrical profile; an adze has an asymmetrical (plano-convex), triangular, or sometimes even trapezoid cross-section; and a chisel is defined as a bifacial tool with two pointed edges. Definitions of subtypes within the group of bifacial tools follow the criteria used by Cauvin:38 1) Form of the edge a. Rounded edge : an edge without sharp boundaries with the lateral edges. b. Straight edge: an edge with sharp boundaries with the lateral edges, forming a more or less right angle. 2) Indices a. Longitudinal index : the ratio between the maximal length of the tool and its maximal width; a long tool is thus defined as a tool whose longitudinal index is greater than 2. b. Thickness index : the ratio between the maximal width of the tool and its maximal thickness. A thick tool is, accordingly, one whose thickness index is less than 2. Below is the general type-list comprising the tools found in both Area E and Area G. Tools found inside the silo in Area G (L. 1884) are listed separately. Axes (Figs. 72, 73:1) All the axes were shaped by flaking perpendicular to the long axis of the tool. The edge was shaped by the production of short and wide flakes, except for two tools (Fig. 72:1, 3), in which it was shaped by elon- gated flaking parallel to the long axis of the tool. Two tools (Fig. 72: 1, 2) have a rounded edge, both of them unpolished. One of these axes (Fig. 72:2) is made on a flake and is exceptionally long (16.5 cm.). Both tools have a longitudinal index less than 2 and a thickness index lower than 2. Four axes (Figs. 72:3-5, 73:1) have a straight edge which is, in all cases, polished. The tools in Fig. 72:3, 4 are broken; both appear to have a longitudinal index less than 2, but Fig. 72:3 is thick and 72:4 is thin. It seems that both tools were made on flakes. The axes appearing in Figs. 72:5 and 73: 1 are long and thick; the former is made on a flake. Adzes (Photo 86) Flint Adzes (Fig. 73:2-9, 74:1-4) Of the twelve adzes discovered, three are broken (Figs. 73:7, 74:1, 2). Two of these and eight of the other nine flint adzes have a straight edge (Figs. 37. R.J.

Like the axes, the adzes were also shaped by bifacial flaking parallel to the long axis of the tool, while the edge was shaped by the production of short and wide flakes. Eight of the eleven tools with an unbroken edge were polished (Figs. 73:2-8, 74:3). The complete tools are 7.2-8.6 cm. long (the average is 7.83 cm.), and their longitudi- nal index is greater than 2. The flint adzes in Fig. 73:2-3 are long and thin; all the other tools are long and thick. Several are made on flakes (Figs. 73:2-4, 9; 74:4); the rest are made on flint nodules. Limestone Adzes (Figs. 74:5-6, 75:1-3) These are heavier and cruder than the flint adzes. They are long (4.5-11.5 cm.) and thick. Two have a straight edge and a trapezoidal outline (Fig. 74:5-6), while the others have rounded edges and a rectangu- lar outline. Picks (Fig. 75:4-5) The two picks are made of limestone and have a triangular cross-section. One is made on a flake (Fig. Fig. 72 No. Type Locus Area 1 Axe - E 2 Axe 1884 G 3 Axe 1902 G 4 Axe 1883 G 5 Axe 1883 G 75:4). The other is exceptionally long (17.5 cm.) (Fig. 75:5). Chisels (Fig. 76:1-4) Three of the four chisels are made of limestone (Fig. 76:1-3); one is made on a flake (Fig. 76:3). This chisel and another as well (Fig. 76:4) have a boat-shaped long section; similar chisels are known from Ain el-Jerba.39 Borers (Fig. 76:5-11) All the borers are of flint. One tool (Fig. 76:10) has a bifacial point; all the others have steeply retouched points. One borer (Fig. 76:7) has an inversely retouched lateral edge. Sickle Blades (Fig. 76:12-32) Five of the thirty-seven sickle blades have smooth edges; all the others have finely denticulated edges. Except for two examples, all the blades are backed, though the backing is not always continuous or regu- lar. Neither pressure flaking nor sickle sheen was observed on any of the blades. Six blades are pointed at one end while the other end is broken (Fig. 76:12-16, 18). Four have double truncations (Fig. 76:19-22). One truncated edge is found on fifteen blades, while the other blade is in 39. Kaplan (above, n. 7), Fig. 13:13. 291</page><page sequence="303">most cases broken (Fig. 76:17, 26-28). On the rest of the blades both edges are broken (Fig. 76:23, 31, 32). The width of most of the sickle blades reach from 1.2-1.4 cm. Six blades reach a width of over 1.7 cm., with a maximum width of 1.9 cm. (Fig. 76:29). The thickness of most blades ranges from 0.4-0.5 cm.; one is 0.8 cm. thick (Fig. 76:23) and three others have a thickness of almost 0.9 cm. (Fig. 76:26, 29, 30). Endscrapers and Burins The two endscrapers and two of the three burins from Area E display a patina which clearly differentiates them from the rest of the assemblage. This patina, grey with white dots, is common in Epipaleolithic industries (O. Bar-Yosef, personal communication). The two endscrapers are simple and the burins are dihedral (bec de flûte). It is very likely that these tools are intrusive in the assemblage. The third burin has a whitish-brown patina similar to that appearing on the rest of the flint tools. It is, however, a straight- dihedral burin and may thus also be intrusive. All endscrapers and burins from Area G are of whitish-brown flint. All endscrapers are simple. Four burins are angled burins on a snap (one is transver- sal), while another was made on a concave trunca- tion. This burin was made on a broken piece of a bifacial tool, as is evident from the traces of sheen on its back. Sidescrapers Three of the five scrapers (one from Area E and two from Area G) closely resemble fan-scrapers in their shape; they are, however, not of tabular flint. Varia These include two broken denticulated limestone pebbles, a transversal flake with a circular retouch, a thick curved blade broken at the tip, with steep, climbing retouch on both lateral edges. Apart from these artifacts, three broken arrow- heads, made by pressure flaking, were also discov- ered (two in Area E, one in Area G); they represent 40. M.

THE CHRONOLOGICAL POSITION OF THE LITHIC ASSEMBLAGE Introduction The general impression received from the artifacts is of a homogeneous lithic assemblage. In our opinion it should be ascribed to the Late Neolithic period. The resemblance of the boat-shaped chisels to the chisel found at Ain el-Jerba has already been mentioned. The absence of true fan-scrapers and of Canaanite blades is also significant in this respect. Additional evidence pointing to the above-suggested date is the fact that the stone tools were found together with Late Neolithic pottery in the silo of Area G (L. 1884) and the existence of parallels with other sites. Axes The six axes reflect a rather high variability. Only one axe found outside the silo of Area G has a parallel in the silo assemblage (Figs. 72:5; 73:1). This type of axe, long and narrow and with a polished edge, appears from the beginning of the Pottery Neolithic40 through the Ghassulian stage.41 In Byblos similar types appear from the Middle Neolithic through the Ghassulian.42 An axe similar to the short type with a rounded edge (Fig. 72:1) appears in Sha'ar Hagolan in the Yarmukian assemblage43 (though with a pol- ished edge). The short, broad type (Fig. 72:3, 4) has affinities in the Middle Neolithic period at Byblos.44 The general impression is that axes with a rounded edge, and short, broad axes with a straight edge, disappear at the end of the Late Neolithic period and are not found later.

Neolithic axe and adzes (Scale 1:2). 293</page><page sequence="305">Adzes In contrast to the axes, the adzes reflect a rather high stylistic conformity. All the adzes found outside the silo of Area G have parallels in the silo asemblage. The dominant type is the trapezoidal adze whose working edge was flaked by short and wide flakes and •was polished only to a limited extent (Figs. 73:2-7, 74:3). This type of adze is known from the beginning of the Pottery Neolithic45 through the Wadi Rabah stage. It was found at Ain el-Jerba46and Neve-Yam.47 In Byblos this type appears from the Middle Neo- lithic onwards. It seems that towards the final stages of the Late Neolithic it becomes rare and is replaced by a longer adze with a more rectangular outline and a more extensively polished working edge.48 The trapezoidal adze, however, does not totally disap- pear, as it is encountered at Byblos in the Chalcolithic period49 and at Ghassul.50 Sickle Blades The finely denticulated sickle blades characterize the Late Neolithic51 as well as the Ghassulian.52 They replace the crudely denticulated blades which charac- terize the Yarmukian stage.53 At Byblos finely dentic- ulated sickle blades appear from the Middle Neolithic;54 here, too, they were preceded by crudely denticulated sickle blades. Scrapers It is possible that the scrapers, which bear similarities to the fan-scrapers, belong to the Late Neolithic period and should thus be viewed as predecessors of the true fan-scrapers. A similar "prototype" fan- scraper was found at Ain el-Jerba.55 45. Stekelis (above, n. 40), PI. 6:6. 46. Kaplan (above, n. 7) Fig. 11:2, 4, 5. 47. E.E. Wreschner, "Newe-Yam.
