<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sociology of Religion 1993, 54:1 83-100 Gender and the Experience of Conversion: The Case of "Returnees" to Modern Orthodox Judaism* Lynn Davidman Brown University Arthur L. Greil Alfred University This essay develops a gendered analysis of the experience of conversion to one particular religious perspective, that of modern Orthodox Judaism. Based on interviews with newly Orthodox men and women, our analysis reveals important gender differences in the processes of recruitment and resocialization. Male recruits were more likely to have been active seekers and to have found Orthodoxy "on their own, " while women were more likely to enter through personal contacts. Men emphasized ethical and workplace concerns in discussing the appeal of Orthodoxy; women stressed issues related to family and personal relationships. Men reported higher levels of belief in an anthropomorphic God. Questions of gender roles were more salient for the women. These differences are consistent with gender role distinctions both in the wider society and within Orthodox Judaism. Future research should employ gender as a category in the analysis of all forms of religious experience. Within the sociology of religion, the last twenty years has seen a proliferation of studies of the conversion process (for reviews, see Greil and Rudy, 1984b; Kilbourne and Richardson, 1989; Richardson, 1985; Snow and Machalek, 1984). The vast majority of these studies focus on conversion to the perspectives of religious groups that are regarded by the larger society as deviant, such as Hare Krishna and the Moonies (Greil and Rudy, 1983; Snow and Phillips, 1980). This tendency to focus on conversion to groups viewed as deviant from the perspective of the Jewish and Christian traditions may have produced a distortion in scholarly understanding of the conversion process. Thumma (1991) has recently called upon researchers to conduct conversion studies *EThis is a revised version of a paper presented at the 1992 annual meeting of the American Sociological Association in Pittsburgh.

Several recent studies (such as Austin, 1977; Davidman, 1991, Heirich, 1977; Kaufman, 1991) begin to correct this imbalance by focusing upon conversion to such religious com- munities as Orthodox Judaism and conservative Christianity. Most conversion studies focus on conversion to the perspectives of a specific group. A few studies have been conducted that compare the conversion experience across several social settings in an attempt to discover which features of the conversion process are most general and basic (Gerlach and Hine, 1970; Greil and Rudy, 1984b; Kox et al., 1991; Lofland and Skonovd, 1981; Pilarzyk, 1978). Few if any studies systematically address the possibility of intragroup variation in the conversion process. Scholars seem to assume that, although the experience of conversion may vary from one group to the next, it is necessarily the same for all those who convert to the perspective of a common group (Greil and Rudy, 1984a). In fact there exists some evidence suggesting that this assumption is unwarranted. Austin (1977), for example, found that the well- known Lofland and Stark process model accurately represented the conversion experiences of some members of the fundamentalist Christian community he studied but not that of others. (For other examples, see Lofland and Skonovd, 1981; Pilarzyk, 1978; Richardson, 1978; and Wallis, 1977.) Few conversion studies pay attention to the question of whether and how gender influences the conversion experience. By ignoring gender, these studies implicitly assume that it is not a significant factor in the analysis of the process of conversion. This gender-blindness characterizes research on new religious movements in general, which, despite their emergence in an era of feminist scholarship, do not typically utilize gender as a category of analysis (Davidman and Jacobs, 1993). Feminist scholarship has demonstrated that all social relations, processes, and institutions are gendered (for well-known examples, see Bernard, 1972; Hochschild, 1983; and Kanter, 1977). Gender role expectations within contemporary American society are built upon the assump- tion that there exist two distinct spheres: home and work. Women are expected to develop those skills and characteristics that will allow them to create a nurturing home environment, while men are taught to focus on the public world of work. Religious communities generally play an important role in creating and maintaining these gender distinctions, since they define male and female nature and roles in distinct ways. Thus we can assume that women's and men's experiences in religious communities would indeed manifest important gender distinctions. In addition, there are several reasons for assuming that the experience of conver- sion in particular will be different for women and men. In modern American society, men and women grow up with different expectations regarding their styles of social interaction and emotional expression. A well-known tradition that describes these gender distinctions is the self-in-relation school of feminist theory, which suggests that women experience themselves as more interconnected with others than do men (Chodorow, 1978; Gilligan, 1982; Miller, 1976, 1984; Rubin, 1976; Surrey, 1984). Gilligan writes that, "in view of the evidence that women perceive and construe social reality differently from men and that these differences center around experiences of attach- ment and separation, life transitions that invariably engage these experiences can be expected to involve women in a distinctive way'" (1982:171).</page><page sequence="3">THE CASE OF "RETURNEES" TO MODERN ORTHODOX JUDAISM 85 Since conversion involves intensive interaction with others and the formation of affective bonds, and is frequently an emotion-laden experience, it seems reasonable to assume that the process will be different for women than for men. In fact, the few conversion studies that have considered gender lead us to believe that it does shape the conversion experience in significant ways. Rochford's study (1985) of the Hare Krishna indicates that the mechanisms for recruiting newcomers into the process of conversion differ for women and men: although the initial contact with men is often made through an approach by strangers in a public place, women are more likely to be recruited through networks of friends and relatives. Jacobs's research (1984, 1989) on individuals who leave alternative religious groups similarly highlights the significance of relationships in women's conversion experiences. The women's attraction to the groups was often sparked by an intimate relationship with a guru or religious leader. When that relationship deteriorated, the women were more likely to leave the group. These studies suggest that religious conversion is indeed affected by gender roles and expectations and that the experience is more likely to involve intimate and emotional connections for women. This article reports the results of a case study that extends the study of gender and conversion into the context of modern Orthodox Judaism. This research compares the experiences of ba'alei and ba'alot teshuvah [plural male and female forms of the word referring to someone who becomes newly Orthodox as an adult], paying special attention to the ways in which that experience differs for women and men. Although there have been several studies that focus primarily on men's experiences (Aviad, 1983) or on women's (Davidman, 1990a, 1990b, 1991; Kaufman, 1991), only one study systematically compares the conversion experiences of the women and men; Danzger (1989) found that men reported spiritual experiences more frequently than did women. We would certainly expect to find gender differences in newcomers' attraction and resocialization in Orthodox Judaism, since it does indeed prescribe distinct roles for men and women. Women's roles are defined largley in terms of their duties as wives and mothers in nuclear families: women are expected to light the Shabbat and holiday candles and create the proper environment for their families within the home. Men's religious roles are more focused upon public ritual observance in the synagogue; because they have greater religious obligations in prayer and study, they are the ones who lead the services, read from the Torah [Pentateuch] scrolls, and receive ritual honors. Therefore, it seems reasonable to expect that the experience of becoming Orthodox will be different for women than it is for men, because of gender differences both within Orthodox Judaism and in the society at large. Our analysis of the role of gender in the process of becoming a ba'al and ba'alat teshuvah [singular form] is guided by a microstructural view of gender roles. Risman (1987) contrasts the microstructural perspective on gender roles to what she terms the "individualist" perspective. The individualist approach assumes that women and men learn their gender identities and the behaviors appropriate to them in early childhood and that this identity then acts as a sort of internal gyroscope that impels females' and males' behavior throughout their lives. The microstructural approach, on the other hand, proposes that gender roles are constantly being shaped by the social situations in which individuals find themselves and by the face-to-face inter-</page><page sequence="4">86 SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION action that takes place within those situations. The microstructural perspective has much in common with the view of some students of conversion that the conversion process is best understood as a process of learning a new social role (Balch, 1980; Bromley and Shupe, 1979; Snow and Machalek, 1984; Straus, 1976, 1979). METHODS Descrpt of Field Setting and Sample This study is based on five months of participant observation and intensive inter- viewing of a sample of women ba'alot teshuvah (1984) plus an additional month of intensive interviewing of male ba'alei teshuvah (1987) at Lincoln Square Synagogue, a large modem Orthodox synagogue on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. (The major findings of the study of the women in this community can be found in Davidman, 1990a, 1990b, 1991.) Lincoln Square Synagogue is widely known within the Jewish world for its activist and extensive outreach programs and its highly educated and professional membership. For over a decade the synagogue has engaged in an inten- sive and extensive program of recruiting the secular Jews in its neighborhood and resocializing them into traditional Jewish observance. A major focus of Lincoln Square Synagogue's outreach program is a special Beginners' Service designed for people who know little about traditional Judaism. This community's attempts to convert secular Jews to Orthodoxy is part of a more general trend, begun in the early 1970s in Israel, to develop specialized Jewish institutions whose purpose is to teach assimilated Jews the laws and practices of Orthodox Judaism. This essay relies primarily on interviews with 51 ba'alei and ba'alot teshuvah, 25 women and 26 men. The rabbi responsible for conducting the Beginners' Service provided brief descriptive summaries of all individuals whose names appeared on the synagogue's Beginners' mailing list. Based on these summaries, we selected respondents representing the broadest possible range in terms of both length of involvement and level of observance. We then wrote to all selected respondents inviting them to participate in the study. The Beginners' rabbi added a personal note expressing his support for the project. Ninety percent of those we asked agreed to be interviewed. By design, then, the sample included men and women who had just begun to explore the synagogue and religious life, as well as those who had been participating for several years. Among the men, length of involvement with the synagogue ranged from under one year to 18 years; for women, length of involvement ranged from under one year to ten years. Sixteen of the women and 12 of the men had been exploring Orthodoxy for under three years. Not all of our interviewees had become observant, although most still participated in services, classes and activities at Lincoln Square Synagogue. Of those who became observant, not all remained fmm [a Yiddish word referring to traditional observance]. Of the 25 women, 12 had become observant, eight were moderately observant, three had never become even minimally observant, and two had dropped out. Of the 26 men, 11 could be described as observant, eight were moderately observant, three had never become observant, and three had dropped out. Nonobservant individuals and</page><page sequence="5">THE CASE OF "RETURNEES" TO MODERN ORTHODOX JUDAISM 87 dropouts have been retained in the sample because they can serve in some ways as a "control" group. The two groups in the study share similar demographic characteristics. The age for the women ranged from 24 to 52, with the large majority in their 30s. The age for the men in the sample ranged from 27 to 53; again, the majority were in their 30s. Both the women and the men were highly educated; nearly all of them have at least a college degree. About a third (8) of the women and half (13) of the men have a postgraduate degree. Nearly all of the women worked in a variety of well-paid positions in business or the professions, including advertising, academics, public rela- tions, managerial or sales positions. The men, too, occupied professional positions. The sample includes five writers, five lawyers, and two doctors, as well as men who worked in businesses and other professions. Among the women, 17 were single, two were divorced, and six were married; of these six, three had married since their conversion. Although a slightly higher pro- portion of the men were married - ten of the 26 - only four were married at the time of their entry into Orthodoxy; six had married since then. The major focus of this study is on the initial stages of attraction into the community, and the male and female respondents had similar marital statuses at that time. The people in the sam- ple came from a wide range of religious backgrounds. Included here are nine women from families that had almost no Jewish observance at all as well as eight women with Reform backgrounds, seven with Conservative, and one Orthodox. The men came from similar religious backgrounds: seven men came from nonobservant families, seven were reared Reform, ten had been Conservative, and two had been Orthodox. All interviews were done by the senior author, who conducted the interviews as informal conversations based on an interview guide described by Davidman (1991). All interviews were taped and later transcribed. Converting to One's Own Religion An issue in the sociological study of conversion concerns the question of how, precisely, to define the term. Travisano defines conversion as "a radical reorganiza- tion of identity, meaning, and life" (1970:600). Similarly, McGuire describes conver- sion as "a transformation of self concurrent with a transformation of one's central meaning system" (1982:49). Although these and other definitions of conversion describe it as a change in world view, some critics of this literature point out that many so- called studies of conversion actually focus upon the process of affiliation to a new group (Greil and Rudy, 1984b; Snow and Machalek, 1984). It is clear that affiliation with a new group is not the same thing as conversion: joining a new group does not necessarily imply a radical change either in behavior or in ways of looking at the world (Balch, 1980; Long and Hadden, 1983; Straus, 1976, 1979; Zygnunt, 1972). Is the process of becoming ba'al and ba'alat teshuvah conversion or is it merely a change in group affiliation? Can individuals in fact convert to their own religion? We would argue that becoming a ba'al and ba'alat teshuvah can indeed be classified as a conversion process insofar as it involves a radical change in belief system and way of life. Philip Glasser, a 27 year old lawyer who is married to a ba'alat teshuvah, exemplifies how this movement from secular to Orthodox Judaism does indeed connote</page><page sequence="6">88 SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION such a radical transformation of self, meaning system, and way of life. He was reared in the Bronx in a family that belonged to a Reform Temple. His family did not observe the Sabbath in any way. Observance was generally limited to Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Hanukkah, and Passover. As Philip describes it, the attitude at Passover was always, "Let's get to the food." Philip has been going to Lincoln Square Synagogue for two years. In the year prior to his interview, he had married a woman, also a "returnee," whom he met at Lincoln Square. He and his wife keep a kosher home; they observe the Sabbath strictly as well as the family purity laws [a system of regula- tions guiding the sexual relationships of husbands and wives]. Philip describes himself as having a "love affair with God." Once a secular Jew, he has now adopted a way of life whose daily, weekly, and annual rhythms revolve around religion. It is reasonable, therefore, to refer to Philip's religious transformation as conversion. Philip is fairly typical of those who have become observant. For those who have become moderately observant, the distance between former and present life-style is, of course, not quite as great. Qualifications Before we proceed with our analysis, several qualifications are in order. As is the case in any study employing purposive sampling, we cannot claim that our findings for the women and men who came to Lincoln Square Synagogue are representative of the experiences of ba'alei and ba'alot teshuvah in other settings in the United States and elsewhere, such as in Israel. Similarly, although we did not observe any major systematic demographic differences between our samples of women and men, the lack of a random sample prevents us from claiming that the women and men interviewed are representative of all female and male recruits at Lincoln Square Synagogue. Nor can we claim that differences between female and male recruits in our sample would necessarily be found in the population as a whole. This study is based on converts' accounts of their conversion experiences. The literature on interviewing in general suggests that respondents' accounts are never frilly objective recollections of an experience but rather represent reconstructions based on subsequent experiences and perspectives (Dean and Whyte, 1958). In studies of religious conversion, it has been found that members of particular groups often provide stan- dardized accounts of their conversion experiences (Beckford, 1978; Snow and Machalek, 1983, 1984; Taylor, 1976, 1978). Some argue that such accounts say more about the ideology of a specific group than they do about converts' actual experiences. Our respondents, however, did not provide stereotypical, formulaic accounts of their conversion experiences. Since these accounts are not standardized, we believe that they can be regarded as descriptive of converts' past experiences. PATHWAYS INTO LINCOLN SQUARE SYNAGOGUE The majority of the literature on conversion asserts that converts often turn to new religious belief systems in a time of crisis or at a turning point in their lives (Austin, 1977; Baer, 1978; Galanter, 1980; Harrison, 1974; Kox et al., 1991; Lofland and Stark,</page><page sequence="7">THE CASE OF "RETURNEES" TO MODERN ORTHODOX JUDAISM 89 1965; Richardson, 1978). However, our findings indicate that although a few individuals (five women and six men) did contact Lincoln Square Synagogue at a period of life crisis, the large majority did not. This distinction between our findings and those of other studies of conversion may reflect the difference between the process of adopting a relatively less deviant world view and the process of adopting a more deviant world view that has been the focus of many previous studies. Our data show three distinct paths of entree into Lincoln Square Synagogue, which we label accidental contact, casual search, and committed search. Three Distinct Paths Accidental contact refers to the experiences of those newcomers who were not deliberately and self-consciously seeking a spirital path or greater knowledge about Judaism. Six ba'alei and eight ba'alot teshuvah entered the synagogue without having deliberately sought out a Jewish experience. One woman who came to Lincoln Square this way is Evelyn Nason, a married woman in her 40s who worked with her husband in their own finance company. Evelyn's husband's father had died, and he was looking for a place to say Kaddish. After trying several synagogues he went to Lincoln Square, where he got to know Rabbi Riskin, the founding rabbi of the synagogue. One day she and her husband ran into Riskin on the street, and he remembered Evelyn's name. She claims that she was quite impressed and thereafter accompanied her husband to Lincoln Square Synagogue. Similarly, Michael Spencer, a 31 year old single scriptwriter, also became involved with Lincoln Square rather accidentally. He had grown up in a nonobservant Reform family. He had been a Bar Mitzvah and had gone to Hebrew school, but had long since ceased being involved with a synagogue. He thought of himself as Jewish, but saw this as a cultural, rather than a religious, identity. Michael's sister discovered Lincoln Square Synagogue and asked him to accompany her because she felt uncomfortable going alone. Michael went with his sister and found Shabbat services at Lincoln Square to be an eye-opening experience which heightened his sense of Jewish awareness. He continued to attend Shabbat services occasionally on his own. Casual search. Those whom we identify as "casual" searchers are individuals who became interested in learning more about Judaism and who sought a place in which to do so, although not always in a systematic way. This category includes seven men and ten women. A woman who came to Lincoln Square this way was Deborah Wechsler, a 28-year old single woman who worked in publishing. Her background contained minimal Jewish observance and training, but as an adult she became more interested and went to some classes at the 92nd Street YMHA with Elie Wiesel. Since she could not understand a lot of the Biblical references in his classes, she wanted to learn more. She heard about the Lincoln Square beginners' minyan [prayer service] and began attending. Another casual searcher is Donald Butcher, a businessman in his early forties, who lives with a woman who is not interested in Orthodoxy. Donald was brought up as a Conservative Jew, which, he says, "means that you go to shul [synagogue] twice a year." He went to Hebrew school but stopped after he became a Bar Mitzvah.</page><page sequence="8">90 SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION As an adult he decided he wanted to learn more about Judaism, so one day he "wandered in" to Lincoln Square Synagogue. He has been going there for about five years. He now keeps kosher and observes the Sabbath laws "within limits." Committed search. Committed searchers are those ba'alei and ba'alot teshuvah who had been on a spiritual quest for many years and who eventually made a decision systematically to "search in their own backyards," i.e., in Jewish religious directions. Thirteen men and seven women can be classified as committed searchers. A number of committed searchers had explored other religions before becoming involved with Orthodox Judaism. Janet Machtiger, a 51 year old divorced journalist, had always been interested in spirituality. As a child she felt that if she did not marry she would grow up and be a nun because that was the only model of a committed religious life that she knew, and she was certain that this was the kind of life she wanted. During her high school years she lived with her family in Germany where she saw holocaust films and felt very conscious of being Jewish. In college she attended Yom Kippur services with some friends and later, when she moved to New York, took some classes at the Jewish Theological Seminary. She also enjoyed attending Catholic and Protestant services with her friends and spoke eloquently of the sense of mystery evoked in the Catholic Latin liturgy. She married a man who was from an Orthodox background, and the first time she went with him to an Orthodox synagogue for Rosh Hashanah she immediately knew this was what she wanted. Although her husband had abandoned his observance, she pursued Jewish studies and knowledge vigorously, eventually ending up at Lincoln Square Synagogue after her divorce. Paul Levinson, a 33 year old single man who sells economic research, grew up in New Jersey. His parents, who belonged to a Reform synagogue, thought of themselves as agnostics. Jewish observance, he recalls, was limited to celebrations at Hanukkah and Passover. Paul says that he has always been a spiritual person. He had experimented with several Eastern religions but then decided that he should look to Judaism to meet his spiritual needs. After checking out many synagogues over the course of several years, he went to Lincoln Square at the suggestion of his roommate. He has recently married a woman who was reared as an Orthodox Jew. Paul describes himself today as practicing "varsity religion," a term he used to indicate how intensive and high- level his commitment is. Gender Differences in Pathways to Orthodoxy In analyzing the paths men and women took to Orthodoxy, we found several interesting differences. Women were slighdy more likely (8 of 25) to have reached Lincoln Square "accidentally" than men (6 of 26), while a greater number of men (10) than women (3) had defined themselves as religious seekers and tried out other religions. More women (9) than men (1) entered Lincoln Square Synagogue via classes, and women were somewhat more likely (10) than men (7) to have made contact with the synagogue through a significant other. Three times as many men (18) as women (6) first went to Beginners' Minyan on their own. These differences might be explained by gender role expectations in American society. In conformity with gender role expectations, the men in this study might have</page><page sequence="9">THE CASE OF "RETURNEES" TO MODERN ORTHODOX JUDAISM 91 taken a somewhat more active approach to their search for a new world view. Alter- natively, but also in conformity with gender role expectations, these men may simply have presented themselves as having taken a more active role. These findings about men's more active role, and women's greater reliance on significant others are consis- tent with Rochford's (1985) Hare Krishna finding that men were more likely to make contact with the group in public places whereas more of the women entered through close personal relationships. THE APPEAL OF LINCOLN SQUARE SYNAGOGUE Consistent with the findings of the large majority of conversion studies, in which the formation of affective bonds between members and recruits is cited as a major factor in the appeal of religious movements to newcomers, both women and men reported that the sense of community they found at Lincoln Square was a major attraction (Balch and Taylor, 1978; Beckford, 1978; Bromley and Shupe, 1986; Davidman, 1990b, 1991; Lofland and Stark, 1965; Rochford, 1982; Snow et al., 1980; Snow and Phillips, 1980; Stark and Bainbridge, 1980a, 1980b). In this area there were no noticeable gender distinctions; 17 men and 15 women mentioned the sense of community they had found at Lincoln Square as a major attraction of this way of life. Linda Drescher, a divorced woman in her mid40s who was rearing two sons while working full-time in publishing, expressed this sentiment clearly: One of the things I most enjoy about participating in Orthodox Judaism is a sense of community. I need to be part of a community and I really am here. It fulfills an emotional need in myself to have a sense of belonging. That people welcome me and give to me and that I give to them. Its a need both for me and for my place in the world. Similarly, Jeff Levy, a 38 year old free-lance writer, who is engaged to a ba'alat teshuvah, answered the question, "What do you like best about the observant way of life?" as follows: The coming together of the community, the tremendous support we have from one another, having an extended family. It's quite tremendous. Most people have to go it alone in this world. Lincoln Square is a community whose members are very much for each other. I particularly saw that when my father died. I constantly see it. I have more friends today than I've ever had in my life. Fifteen women and 15 men also mentioned a sense of identity and connection with their heritage as a major attraction of Orthodoxy. Ruth Melamed, a single businesswoman in her early 30s, emphasized Orthodoxy's historical roots: What I loved about Orthodox Judaism is the sense that I'm simply part of a 3,000 year old continuum that happened to skip a couple of generations. You can look at my parents' or grandparents' nonobservance as a little bloop out of 3,000 years. So I like this sense of where I stand in history. David Shapiro, a 30 year old writer, married to a woman who is not involved in</page><page sequence="10">92 SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION Orthodoxy articulated the same sentiments: "I feel a direct connection between myself and six thousand years of Jewish history, as if I could have been comfortable with a sword in my hand in Joshua's army or out in the desert." Both women and men indicated that family life in the Orthodox community was an important attraction, but this factor appears to be more salient for women. In their interviews, most of the women elaborated greatly upon this theme whereas, although most men mentioned it, few discussed it as extensively. Women and men also differed in their descriptions of the meaning of Shabbat. For the women, Shabbat was attrac- tive primarily as an embodiment of family values. Deborah Wechsler was quite explicit: I would like to get married soon and have a large famnily. Marriage was never that central; I never really started thinking about it until within the last year or so. But now, I see how it's all part of Shabbat. Going to the Rabbi's home for Shabbat lunches, I see how beautil it is, the Jewish family around the Shabbat table, and the little boy making Kiddsh, and I see that is something I really want for myself. In contrast, men's discussions of Shabbat more frequently focused upon its value as a respite from the demands of work. For example, Paul Levinson stated, "I like the rhythm of having Shabbat. I like that very much. It gives me a chance to replenish and step back from my work and get some perspective on where I'm going. I might be the kind of person who would have worked seven days a week." Given gender role expectations in the society and in this particular religious community (i.e., increased emphasis on family for women, continued emphasis on work for men), it is not surprising that women's descriptions of the appeal of Shabbat more often focused upon it as an enhancement of family values while men's descrip- tions emphasized Shabbat as an escape from work. Another important gender difference in the appeal of Orthodoxy concerns the realm of prayer, public worship, and Torah reading and study. Since women have only minimal obligations in this area, that men were much more likely (9) than women (2) to mention laining [chanting from the Torah], davening [praying], and singing as positive aspects of Orthodoxy is not surprising. Avram Small, a 51 year old computer programmer, who, together with his wife, became ba'alei teshuvah, enthused: I love to daven, I love to daven. Right away, the first thing I love to do is daven. Say brachas [blessings], I love to do that. It makes me feel Jewish. It makes me feel a special Jewish connection with God. Davening is also a social experience as well as a religious experience. It makes me feel very connected, very close toward the Jews, and gives me a very warm feeling. By contrast, although two women described how they found the sound of the prayers very attractive, since they were reminiscent of the ancient roots of the religion, they specified that it was the sound of the prayers coming out of the men's section that appealed. Ellen Reiss, a 37 year old divorcee who worked in computers, expressed this eloquently: "In thinking about the synagogue services, there is a feeling that I get from the sound of the prayer coming out of the men's section at various times that makes me feel very much allied with a community, that is very ancient and that I hope is eternal."</page><page sequence="11">THE CASE OF "RETURNEES" TO MODERN ORTHODOX JUDAISM 93 In addition, several female interviewees expressed difficulty with prayer. As Janet Machtiger said when asked whether she has had any religious experiences: "Ah, if I could have on my last day the kind of mystical experience I think June [her Protes- tant friend] has every time she opens a prayer book, it would be terrific. Once I loved God for about 30 seconds." Although both women and men mentioned a strong sense of moral order as a major attraction of Orthodoxy, many more men (17) than women (7) emphasized this theme. Men's discussions of ethics were much more elaborated than those of the women. Whereas the women might have talked for 15 minutes at a time about family, the men were much more likely to go on about the value of Judaism as an ethical way of life. For example, Nathan Levitsky, a 38 year old single real estate salesman, answered the question "What does being Jewish mean to you?" as follows: What does being Jewish mean to me? It means we have a purpose. We have a purpose of being the people of this world that teach moral and ethical values to people. We have to live our lives and, somehow, go beyond that to be a role model for the world. We have to be a model of righteousness, of fairness, morals, ethical conduct, standards of living, justice. That's why Hashem [it., "the Name," i.e., God] put us here - to tell the world, to be a light unto the nations. This higher concern for ethics in the men's accounts might be related to men's greater investment in work and to the competitive atmosphere of some of their professions. Preoccupation with work may heighten men's awareness of and concern for ethical issues. As Richard Gale, a 31 year old single lawyer, stated: I try to bring to my job a sense of values, a sense of honesty and integrity, that does have some bearing on how I conduct myself and on the advice that I give people as well. Sometimes I counsel a corporation about firing someone, usually an executive. I mean, I have a duty to tell them what the law is, but I also tend to suggest a more lenient or a more even-handed approach than is required. LEVELS OF INVOLVEMENT IN ORTHODOXY Although the women and men in this sample were equally likely to become observant, more men (20) than women (14) professed belief in an anthropomorphic God. In response to the question, "What is your sense of God?," Donald Butcher replied: "I guess it's the traditional Jewish sense of God. I believe there is a god who does exist. He rewards those who deserve rewarding and punishes those who need to be punished." Whereas very few women (4) brought up the subject of God and God's nature without prompting, the majority of the men (16) did. Five of the men referred to God with the Hebrew term of "Hashem," whereas only one woman did, perhaps reflecting a higher level of integration of Orthodox conceptions of God among the men. Similarly, for men, but not for women, level of observance correlated with belief in an anthro- pomorphic God. In other words, men who believed in an anthropomorphic God were more likely to be observant than those who did not. Brian Danzer, a 32 year old single lawyer, said that he did not have any sense of God, which is why he doubted</page><page sequence="12">94 SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION that he would ever become fully Orthodox. Of 19 men who believed in an anthropo- morphic God, 17 were observant or moderately observant; of 13 women who professed belief in an anthropomorphic God, eight were observant or moderately observant. Of 19 observant or moderately observant men, only two expressed doubts about the reality of an anthropomorphic God. Ten of the 20 observant or moderately observant female respondents, in contrast, did observe Jewish law and ritual while remaining uncertain about the nature of God. As Sherry Weinberg, a 35 year old single woman who worked in sales, stated: I came into observance with an awful lot of doubts about just how to approach the notion of a personal God. I felt that I was a member of the Jewish people with a strong individual religious sense, but who couldn't believe in a personal God. One thing I knew, that was axiomatic with me, was that Jewish continuity was extremely, extremely, important. And education was important. I very much wanted my descendants to be Jewish. But the whole question came up: Can I perform these mitzvot? Can I be observant without believing? Is there any integrity in that? Can I be a member of an observant community without being able to feel the reality of a personal God, or is that misrepresenting myself? And I'll tell you, even though I've been fully frum now for five years, I still cannot feel the immediacy of a personal God. I can't feel communication with a personal God when I'm davening. For men, but not for the women, those who had been committed seekers were more observant. All 13 of the men who had been committed searchers before discovering Lincoln Square Synagogue were observant or moderately observant at the time of the interview. Of the seven women who had been committed searchers, four were observant or moderately observant. While only one of the six men who had come to Lincoln Square "by accident" was observant or moderately observant at the time of the interview, five of eight female "accidental converts" were observant or moderately observant. Similarly, all six men who came to Orthodoxy in a crisis period in their lives became observant or moderately observant, whereas only two of the five women who came to Lincoln Square Synagogue in a time of crisis became observant or moderately observant. Men's more active involvement in prayer may help account for these gender differences. The obligation to pray communally, as well as three times a day, provides male converts with an immediately available religious role, whereas women's primary religious obligations depend upon their marrying. Since Orthodoxy requires of men high levels of participation in prayer and in the synagogue, the observant Orthodox male finds himself talking to God quite often. Since belief often follows practice, a person who talks to God frequently is more likely to come to a belief in God than one who does not. Thus, it is not surprising that level of observance and belief in God were correlated for men in our study. Nor is it surprising that the male seekers - those who were looking for a radical change in their lives - were more likely to become observant and believe in God. Our data indicating that women place a greater emphasis on connection and men on belief resemble Warner's (1988) finding among evangelical Christians that the men were more likely to be ideological and doctrinal about their religious commitments whereas the women were more prosaic and oriented to relationships.</page><page sequence="13">THE CASE OF "RETURNEES" TO MODERN ORTHODOX JUDAISM 95 The patriarchal conception of God in the community may also help to account for the higher correlation between belief and observance among men. One man referred to this factor as a possible source of gender distinctions: If you were to ask a random sample of fifty Jewish men and fifty Jewish women if they believe in God, I think you would find that the men would say that they do much more frequently than the women would. One thing that comes to mind immediately is that a lot of women have problems with the patriarchal nature of God. Guys feel fairly comfortable with that, obviously. GENDER ROLES IN TH-E ORTHODOX COMMUNITY For the most part, both women and men were supportive of the Orthodox separa- tion of men's and women's spheres of activity. As Ellen Reiss stated: I do think that there are differences between men and women, and I like the way Orthodoxy emphasizes that fact. I think it's almost destructive to take away the differences. Even though we're going far away from our biological selves and I think that's partially part of the problem. You know, when babies are made in test tubes and people don't have to get pregnant ... I remember seeing an article in some newspaper about how they'll be able to implant fertilized eggs in men and babies could grow in men some day. That is just the most horrible idea in the world to me. Nathan Levitsky expressed a similar feeling about the gender distinctions within Orthodoxy: "They set standards. A male knows what he has to do. A female knows what she has to do. It takes a lot of confusion out of the picture. It can help, it can help." The issue of gender role divisions, however, seems more salient for women. Women were considerably more likely (13) than men (0) to initiate talk about gender roles. Similarly, twice as many women (6) as men (3) expressed problems with the Orthodox conception of female and male roles. Ellen Reiss addressed this issue in her interview: Well, I've heard Rabbi Buchwald and some other people talk about the reasons that women don't have the obligation to observe commandments that have to do with time and that also means that they don't have the honors in the synagogue, which is a little problematic, even though the Rabbi says, well, the synagogue isn't supposed to be that important in Judaism. Still, you see them going up to the Torah and there is a certain feeling of dependency, sort of, you need men to do the mitzvah, the commandment, for you, and I think that does sort of perpetuate a certain kind of dependency and a feeling of not being quite an equal in the religion. In contrast, Jonathan Stiefel, a 38 year old single lawyer, did not seem to have many problems with the gender inequalities he observed: "In some areas, women are really second class citizens. It doesn't get in my way, but I understand. It doesn't get in my way, except that I empathize with women who have problems with it." A striking finding of this study is that the women who have problems with the Orthodox conception of gender roles are likely to remain nonobservant or to have dropped out, whereas this relationship does not hold for men. Of the six women who expressed concern about gender roles within Orthodoxy, only two were observant</page><page sequence="14">96 SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION or moderately observant, while all three men who were uncomfortable with the Orthodox conception of gender roles were observant or moderately observant. Gail Paretsky, a single public relations specialist in her mid-30s who dropped out of the synagogue a year before our interview, said bitterly: I have seen so many situations in that community that I felt were anti-woman. The religion idealizes the man, the first born man, the priestly man, all the men, in fact. Probably more than other religious groups. You know, when I was going to services regularly I was very into it. I went every week and I wasn't counted for the minyan [quorum of ten adult males needed for public worship], whereas they could bring a man in and even if he fell asleep he still counted whereas I did not. I talked to the Rabbi about it and he said that when I get married and have a family and fulfill the very important role in the home, I'll see how beautiful it is. And I thought, what hypocrisy! If he really thought it was so important he'd be the one at home raising the children and his wife would be at the synagogue reading from the Torah. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms the importance of a gendered analysis of the experience of religious conversion. Although we found many common themes among the women and men "returnees" to Orthodoxy, such as the importance of the community, affective bonds with members, and the sense of identity provided by Orthodoxy (all themes that are highlighted in other studies of conversion as well), we also found important differences in the attraction of Orthodoxy and the dynamics of conversion for the women and the men. Among the women as well as the men three distinct pathways to Orthodoxy were discerned: accidental, casual search, and committed search. However, the men were more likely to have been committed searchers, which may be explained by the fact that men are expected to take a more activist stance toward life, or at least to represent themselves as doing so. Women's contact was more likely to be mediated by significant others, a finding that is consistent with a wide body of literature on the centrality of affective relations in women's major life decisions. The respondents' accounts of their attraction to Orthodoxy similarly reveal gender differences. Both men and women described the appeal of the warm nuclear families in the community. But the appeal of family was more salient for the women; it was a theme about which the majority of them spoke at length. In extolling the appeal of Shabbat, the women were more likely to cite family themes; in contrast, men elaborated upon the respite from work as a primary benefit of Shabbat. Men were much more likely to talk at length about their attempts to apply the ethics they learned within the Orthodox community to their work situations. These differences in how the women and the men accounted for their attraction to Orthodoxy - women's greater emphasis upon family themes in contrast to men's focus upon work-related topics - can be explained by differences in gender role expectations both within Orthodox Judaism and in the wider society. Danzger's (1989) findings among newly Orthodox Jews and Warner's (1988) study of evangelical Christians similarly found the women more oriented toward relationality, particularly in nuclear families, whereas the men were more doctrinal and likely to report spiritual experiences. Men's greater</page><page sequence="15">THE CASE OF "RETURNEES" TO MODERN ORTHODOX JUDAISM 97 emphasis on prayer in our study reflects the situational context of Orthodox Judaism, in which only men may be involved in the world of public worship. The gender differences in levels of observance and belief in this study offer a striking contrast to some of the data about belief among Christians. Studies that measured the religiosity of Christian men and women found that women profess higher levels of belief (Argyle and Beit-Hallahmi, 1975; Nelsen et al., 1985), whereas in the modern Orthodox Jewish community upon which we report here, men were much more likely to believe in an anthropomorphic God. This difference between religious groups can probably be accounted for by the distinct gender role divisions within the practices of Orthodox Judaism. Belief in God is more salient for single men than for single women because of men's ritual obligations with regard to prayer and Torah study. When women marry and become engaged in socializing children, belief in God may become more important for them. The differences in the findings between Christians and this group of Jews points to the need for more comparative studies of gender and religious ex- perience across all religious traditions. For the men in this study, belief was more closely related to observance than for women, whereas for women level of observance seemed to have more to do with the general appeal of the Orthodox way of life. This may help to explain why satisfaction with gender roles was related to observance for women but not for men. In comparing women and men's experiences of conversion to Orthodox Judaism, we found that their attraction and resocialization to Orthodoxy followed gendered patterns that were both appropriate to Orthodoxy and consistent with conventional views in the wider society. This analysis of the conversion of males and females in one particular community reveals themes that are common in other fundamentalist religious communities as well. Studies of charismatic Catholics (Neitz, 1987), Christian evangelicals and fundamentalists (Ammerman, 1987; Rose, 1987; Warner, 1988), as well as other contemporary religious movements (Aidala, 1985; Wagner, 1982) similarly reveal that in the context of a wider society in which gender and family norms are confusing, the delineation of distinct and conventional roles for men and women and normative patterns for nuclear family life were primary elements in these groups' attraction for potential converts. Our research has revealed the gendered nature of religious conversion in one community of Orthodox Jews. Future research in this area should address the question of how gender may influence the conversion process in other religious groups as well as across religious groups. This study further affirms the importance of employing gender as a category of analysis for understanding all aspects of religious experience. The sociology of religion must pay greater attention than it has in the past to developing an understanding of the way gender shapes the experience of being and becoming a religious person.</page><page sequence="16">98 SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION REFERENCES Aidala, A. 1985.
