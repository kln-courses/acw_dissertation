<plain_text><page sequence="1">NABOKOV AND FICTIONAL ARTIFICE nrfr Robert Merrill There are two VIRTUAL commonplaces about the art of Vladimir Nabokov: that it is anti-realistic or anti-mimetic, and therefore a delib erate reproach to the Great Tradition of the nineteenth-century novel; that its major subject is art itself, which makes it a supreme example of what we now call metafiction. One could hardly count the books and articles devoted to the thesis that Nabokov has been a major influence on the "new" self-reflexive fiction, especially the contemporary Ameri can novel. He has been labeled a metafictionist, a parafictionist, a fabulator, a patternmaker, and an artificer;1 discussions of his work have been given such titles as "The Conjuror's Art" and "Nabokov's Puppet Show."* The writers with whom he is most often associated are 'See, respectively, Stanley Fogel, "'And All the Little Typtopies': Notes on Language Theory in the Contemporary Experimental Novel," Modern Fiction Studies, 20 (Autumn 1974), 328-336; James Rother, "Parafiction: The Adjacent Universe of Barth, Barthelme, Pynchon, and Nabokov," Boundary 2, 5 (1976), 21-43; Robert Scholes, The Fabulators (New York: Oxford University Press, 1967), p. 13; Michael Rosenblum, "Finding What the Sailor Has Hidden: Narrative as Patternmaking in Transparent Things," Contemporary Literature, 19 (Spring 1978), 219-232; Patricia Merivale, "The Flaunting of Artifice in Vladimir Nabokov and Jorge Luis Borges," in Nabokov: The Man and His Work, ed.

No one has encouraged this approach toward Nabokov's works more than their author. Nabokov's disdain for "human interest" as an aesthetic criterion is as legendary as his contempt for artistic "sincerity." "All art is deception," he announced firmly.* "My characters are galley slaves" (SO, p. 95). Nothing annoyed Nabokov more than an appeal to the utilitarian value of art. "I have no social purpose, no moral message; I've no general ideas to exploit," he insisted, again and again, in more than a few of his numerous interviews and his prefaces to the English translations of his Russian novels (SO, p. 16).6 "Rank moralists and didacticists" are roasted in nearly all of his public statements about the art of fiction—and the writers indicted include Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Conrad, Mann, Sartre, Faulkner, Camus, and even Oscar Wilde (SO, p. 33)! He expressed distaste for the "damp emotionalism" of his first novel, Mary (1925)7 and acknowledged that the heroine of his last Rus sian novel, The Gift (1952), "is not Zina, but Russian Literature."8 Is it any surprise that Nabokov's critics have taken his description of Sebas tian Knight's The Prismatic Bezel to be an accurate account of his own works: "the heroes of the book are what can be loosely called 'methods of composition.' It is as if a painter said: look, here I'm going to show you not the painting of a landscape, but the painting of different ways of painting a certain landscape"?9 After all, Nabokov's feelings about 'Max F.

Surely his own books reject the conventions of realism for a deliberate and even exaggerated artifice, an art about different conceptions of art. Such, at least, is the conventional wisdom apparently sanctioned by Nabokov himself. It will not be my intention to recast Nabokov as a Realist, one of George Eliot's more unlikely descendants, but I do wish to argue that the conventional view of Nabokov's art is misleading in two crucial respects. The first is that it offers a monolithic theory so far as Nabokov's novels are concerned, implying as it does that all of the novels are best characterized as metafictions, parafictions, fabulations, etc. Indeed, this theory implies that a late work such as Pale Fire (1962) or Ada (1969) is an adequate model for all of Nabokov's seventeen novels, that Nabokov's long career as a novelist was devoted to a single fictional form or mode—fabulation, let us say—and that his later (English) novels differ from his earlier (Russian) works only in terms of relative development or maturity. I believe that at least seven of Nabokov's Russian and two of his English novels are seriously misrepre sented by this view. Quite simply, there is greater diversity—formal diversity—in Nabokov's canon than the popular view suggests. This view is also misleading in so far as it implies that Nabokov repeatedly—nay, relentlessly—employed the devices of fictional artifice toward a single goal or theme: art.10 No one questions the importance of art in Nabokov's fiction, but even the more blatantly "artificial" of the later novels (e.g., Transparent Things [1972], Look at the HarlequinsI [1974]) deal with subjects other than art. Most discussions of Nabokov make all of his novels sound like one endlessly rewritten book. Like his formal diversity, Nabokov's thematic richness will become apparent only if we stop reading his novels as "metafictions," a class of works restricted to a single form and theme almost by definition.11 My aim, then, is to clarify the nature of Nabokov's fiction, early and late. The discussion will focus on Lolita (1955) and Pale Fire, Nabokov's best and most representative novels; but I trust that what is said about these works will also apply to the many novels he wrote before and after his two master pieces. "This is the major thesis of many works on Nabokov, but especially the books by Julia Bader and L. L. Lee cited above. "If by "metafiction" we mean a fiction which is about fiction, then I do think the limitations of the form are self-imposed and self-evident. This becomes quite apparent if one reads a discussion of "metafiction" in which the form is defined in a broader fashion which has little to do with the appar ent meaning of the term.

FICTIONAL ARTIFICE 441</page><page sequence="4">I I have deplored the tendency to treat Nabokov's canon as uniformly fabulistic, the seamless production of "the old puppeteer Nabokov."11 A thorough defense of this position would require detailed analysis of all seventeen novels, but I think we can bypass the obvious difficulties by reconsidering Nabokov's well-known hatred for literary realism. Those who assume that Nabokov is always and everywhere an artificer do so, at least in part, because they think his rejection of realism left him no option except fabulation. There may be other fictional possibilities, however, which Nabokov has in fact exploited. It seems clear that Nabokov altogether hated literary realism as an historical movement, one best represented by the great nineteenth-cen tury novelists in Russia, France, and England. Indeed, his contempt for the major artists of this period appears on just about every page of his published opinions. And if we can accept George Levine's summary of what literary realism has stood for during the last one hundred and fifty years, we can easily see why Nabokov loathed this movement: "Among other things, it has, surely, implied that ordinariness is more real —at least more representative and therefore truthful —than heroism, that people are morally mixed rather than either good or bad, that the firm est realities are objects rather than ideas or imaginings."15 Imagine Vladimir Nabokov writing in praise of "ordinariness"! Given his views on life and art, Nabokov's attitude toward the great "realistic" period in literature is almost absurdly predictable. It is less obvious why Nabokov should have dismissed realism as a literary method. The crucial point is that Nabokov quarreled with the epistemological assumptions underlying literary realism fully as much as with the social and philosophical ideas of the great realists. Nabokov believed that "reality is an infinite succession of steps, levels of percep tion, false bottoms, and hence unquenchable, unattainable" (SO, p. 11). He remarked in his afterword to Lolita that "reality" is "one of the few words which mean nothing without quotes" (L, p. 314). Therefore, he could hardly sympathize with a literary method which insisted on "an unmediated record of reality"14 or which argued that "an intent, veri similar representation of moral situations in their social contexts" was the novelist's task in so far as he wished to be truthful.15 Indeed, Nabokov's contempt for any literary theory stressing verisimilitude was "Stegner, p. 73. "George Levine, "Realism Reconsidered," in The Theory of the Novel: New Essays, p. 236. 14Levine, p. 253. "Robert Alter, Partial Magic: The Novel as a Self-Conscious Genre (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1975), p. ix. 442 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">all but inevitable. But one might still question whether his disdain for literary realism was tantamount to rejecting the traditional novel and embracing the more extreme forms of fabulation, as so many of his critics have assumed. This question is immensely complex and ultimately turns on one's conception of the novel as a literary form. Without doing any kind of justice to other theories, I would like to suggest that what characterizes so-called "traditional" novels—whether Fielding's, Austen's, Balzac's, or Hemingway's—is not so much a "verisimilar representation of moral situations" as the presence of what the late Sheldon Sacks called a "represented action," i.e., a fictional action in which "characters about whose fates we are made to care are introduced in unstable relationships which are then further complicated until the complications are finally resolved by the complete removal of the represented instability."16 (The best analysis of a represented action is R. S. Crane's famous essay on Tom Jones.)17 Such an "action" focuses on the fates of its characters, of course, which explains the popular assumption that traditional fiction is primarily devoted to the creation of character. It is a commonplace — and rightly so —that fabulation subordinates the element of character in order to emphasize artistic design for its own sake or for the didactic ends we associate with fables, parables, and allegories.18 Those who argue that Nabokov is everywhere a "puppeteer" assume, in effect, that his novels are not organized to trace the good or bad fortunes of those "galley slaves," his fictional characters. My own view is that slightly more than half of Nabokov's novels are organized to do precisely that. I refer to Mary (1926), King, Queen, Knave (1928), The Defense (1930), The Eye (1930), Glory (1932), Laughter in the Dark (1933), Despair (1936), Lolita (1955), and Pnin (1957). These novels may not be "realistic" in terms of the definitions offered above, but they do seem to me represented actions. This means that they are novels in which Nabokov's famous "artifice" is either severely restricted or assimilated into the work primarily to illuminate its characters and their fates. In practice this means that the fictional worlds of these novels are self-contained and not subject to the authorial intrusions which mark —and often distinguish —Nabokov's truly fabulistic fictions. I believe I can illustrate this distinction by glancing at Invitation to a Beheading (1938) and Bend Sinister (1947), on the one hand, and King, Queen, Knave and Laughter in the Dark, on the other. "Fiction and the Shape of Belief (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1964), p. 15. "See R. S. Crane, "The Plot of Tom Jones," The Journal of General Education, 4 (1950), 112-130. '•This view is persuasively argued throughout Scholes' The Fabulators. FICTIONAL ARTIFICE 443</page><page sequence="6">Invitation to a Beheading and Bend Sinister are, as Andrew Field has remarked of Invitation, "the most patently fable-like of Nabokov's novels."19 They are also, of course, the most self-consciously artificial of the novels prior to Pale Fire. We see this most clearly in the insubstan tiality of their fictional personae. Nabokov himself remarked that in Bend Sinister "everybody is merely an anagram of everybody else (BS, p. ix), and the "characters" in Invitation (always excepting the novel's hero, Cincinnatus C.) tend to merge with one another in a burlesque manner Henry James would have found appalling. James would also have objected to the role of the narrator ("an anthropomorphic deity impersonated by me," as Nabokov characterized the narrative voice in Bend Sinister) (BS, p. xii), for after any number of direct authorial in trusions Nabokov ends Invitation by permitting Cincinnatus to escape his fated beheading simply by willing that he should survive, then stops the action of Bend Sinister fully nine pages from the end in order to describe the room in which he is writing the book and to comment on the denouement —two of literature's more blatantly "unrealistic" conclu sions.80 These remarkable intrusions call attention to the author and his artifice, as Alfred Appel and others have been arguing for years now, and no doubt contribute to our sense that these two novels read rather like medieval dream-visions, or even fantasies. Similar claims have been made for King, Queen, Knave and Laughter in the Dark, two novels often linked because they deal with the classical "triangle" motif, but also because they are seen as the early works in which Nabokov's penchant for fictional artifice first revealed itself. In King, Queen, Knave, for example, Nabokov introduces a character named Goldemar who has written a play called King, Queen, Knave in which the god of chance is depicted "in the role of a novelist or a playwright" (KQK, p. 224) —perhaps an anthropomorphic deity? Indeed, throughout the novel we hear talk of a movie version of Goldemar's King, Queen, Knave, which no doubt will bear a conspicu ous resemblance to the novel we have been reading. This use of plays within-novels, or movies-within-novels, is usually seen as an unmistakable sign of Nabokov's fabled puppeteering. And as Dabney Stuart has argued, Laughter in the Dark is also a novel in which Nabokov's characters reenact the dreariest version of a cinematic "love" triangle.21 Like the dramatis personae in Invitation to a Beheading and Bend Sinister, these characters would seem to be walking clichés we can only l9Nabokov: His Life in Art (Boston, MA: Little, Brown and Company, 1967), p. 195. *°See Invitation to a Beheading (New York: Capricorn Books, 1965), pp. 222-223, and Bend Sinister, pp. 233-241. flNabokov: The Dimensions of Parody (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1978), pp. 87-113. 444 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">compare to the mannikins —real machines and unreal people—in King, Queen, Knave. The "reality" of these characters is so slight, it seems altogether appropriate for Nabokov to shatter the illusion of fictional verisimilitude, as when he and his wife, anticipating Hitchcock, make "visits of inspection" at the end of King, Queen, Knave," or when Nabokov, in his role as anthropomorphic deity, refers to the lovers of that novel as "our two farcical schemers" (KQK, p. 254). In point of fact, however, Nabokov seems not to have thought of King, Queen, Knave and Laughter in the Dark as fabulations. When asked whether he had anticipated Invitation to a Beheading and Pale Fire in any of his early novels, Nabokov responded: "Possibly in The Eye, but Invitation to a Beheading is on the whole a burst of spontane ous generation" (SO, p. 174). However "generated," Invitation is indeed formally different from the novels which preceded it. The crucial point, I think, is that Nabokov never really "shatters" fictional verisimilitude in his early works. His cameo appearance at the end of King, Queen, Knave is so brief and unobtrusive that only readers thoroughly familiar with Nabokov's personal life and professional interests—in this case, en tomology—could possibly identify him. Contrast this with his spec tacular intrusion at the end of Bend Sinister. And when the narrator of King, Queen, Knave refers to the central figures as "farcical schemers," how does this really differ from the commenting habits of Fielding, Austen, Dickens, Forster, or even such a recent novelist as Anthony Powell? As Wayne Booth has shown, direct authorial commentary has played a valuable role in all kinds of novels, including works we would all call "realistic." Nabokov's caustic commentary seems to be an anti realistic device because we have somehow come to assume that authorial sympathy, or identification with the hero, is a corollary of literary real ism, whereas in Nabokov's novels, as Strother Purdy has reminded us, "we must face Nabokov's scorn for his characters."" Because his early novels are peopled by characters for whom dislike or scorn, and not identification, is the proper response, Nabokov creates an unmistakable "distance" between his characters and his audience; indeed, this effect is fashioned line by line, cumulatively, and cannot be disentangled from the texture of Nabokov's early novels. Because we identify extreme aesthetic distance with the art of the fabulator, it is not hard to see how the early novels have been identified with the later ones. Nonetheless, the difference between Nabokov's early and late novels is crucial. To insist on this distinction is not to deny Nabokov's palpable "See King, Queen, Knave, p. 254. Nabokov uses the phrase "visits of inspection" in his preface, p. viii. "Strother Purely, "Solus Rex: Nabokov and the Chess Novel," Modern Fiction Studies, 14 (Winter 1968-69), 383. FICTIONAL ARTIFICE 445</page><page sequence="8">dislike for his early protagonists —most notably, Franz and Martha in King, Queen, Knave, Albinus and Margot in Laughter in the Dark, and Hermann in Despair; in fact, this dislike helps explain why most readers prefer Nabokov's English to his Russian novels, for there is a distinct chilliness to the early works. One wonders why Nabokov should have employed so much technical skill simply to expose the "farcical" plots his early characters are forever concocting. At the same time, certain formal distinctions must be honored if we are to avoid misinterpreting specific works. Stuart is wrong, for example, when he argues that the "novelistic" texture of Laughter in the Dark is violated by the constant comparison of the characters to cinematic types.14 As Field has remarked, it is the characters, not Nabokov, who "cinematize" the novel, who think of themselves as movie stars and therefore commit themselves to acting out the hackneyed fates of their idols.85 Nabokov's treatment of this proc ess is pitiless, but in the crucial sense of the term it is novelistic; that is, it traces a coherent and causally-related series of episodes in which the characters, however unattractive, are the constant center of interest. Nabokov's ironies are directed at the illusions of his characters, not the "methods of composition" by which they are delineated. There are at least three problems, then, with the popular view that characterizes all of Nabokov's novels as fabulations. If I am right in viewing seven of his nine Russian novels as traditional in form (though traditional in no other way), then it should be obvious that this view radically misrepresents Nabokov's career as a Russian novelist. It also distorts the evolution of his art, for with his last two Russian novels, In vitation to a Beheading and The Gift, and his first two novels in English, The Real Life of Sebastian Knight (1941) and Bend Sinister, Nabokov began to make precisely those formal innovations we now identify with fabulation. We need much better studies of this transition than we now possess, but of course we must first recognize that there was such a transition. The third problem with the popular view remains to be mentioned, but it is probably the most serious. While Lolita falls within Nabokov's later, English period, I would argue that it represents his greatest achievement working within the formal conventions of the traditional novel. Unfortunately, nothing could be less clear in the most influential interpretations of the book—interpretations which assume that Lolita differs from Nabokov's other works only in terms of its quality. Alfred Appel's various writings on Lolita are central here, for they offer a convenient compendium of the more fashionable views which "See note 21 above. "Field, Nabokov: His Life m Art, p. 159. Field cites Vladislav Khodasevich, the Russian poet critic, as having first made this point. 446 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">have grown up around Lolita and Nabokov's canon generally.*6 It is Appel who has argued most forcefully—and gracefully—that Nabokov's art "is artifice or nothing" (L, p. xviii); that it everywhere manifests "the fantastic, a-realistic, and involuted form toward which even his earliest fictions evolve" (L, p. xviii); and that, in the case of Lolita, "the interfacings of verbal figurations . . . undermine the novel's realistic base and distance the readers from its dappled surface" (L, p. lx). Appel would describe Nabokov's art as "involuted" rather than fabulis tic: "An involuted work turns in upon itself, is self-referential, conscious of its status as a fiction, and 'allegorique de lui-meme'— allegorical of itself, to use Mallarmé's description of one of his own poems" (L, p. xxii). For Appel, the texture of Lolita is shot through with self reflexive "gaps" or "holes" (L, p. xxvi), so much so that one of the novel's functions is to parody the realistic tradition and its devotees, those "old-fashioned readers who wish to follow the destinies of the 'real' people beyond the 'true' story" derided by John Ray, Jr. in the foreword to Lolita (L, p. 6). In Appels view, such parody teaches us about our own efforts to order life, our "fabricated illusions" (L, p. xxxii), by tell ing a "story" which is really that of the artist's "mastery in form, his triumph in art" (L, p. lvii) — a story in which "the author has demon strated the fiction of 'reality,' and the reader who accepts these implica tions may even have experienced a change in consciousness."17 It should be apparent that this "story" has little to do with the fic tional fates of Humbert Humbert and Lolita, who seem to exist only to prove that they have no "existence" or "reality" apart from their cre ator. Appel assumes that the novel's "gaps" or "holes" —authorial intru sions—are so glaring as to sabotage its "realistic base," and that any critical analysis which focuses on Humbert and Lolita betrays an acute form of nostalgia for the Victorian novel. To test this crucial assump tion, we must look rather closely at the more important of these so called narrative "gaps." Appel acknowledges that the most conspicuous "gap" in Nabokov's other works—the intrusive authorial voice—is missing in Lolita, where Humbert's voice is maintained from beginning to end (L, p. xxxi). What he points to instead are "verbal figurations" in the text which cannot be attributed to Humbert's mind or "art." His major examples are the many sly references to Quilty, the Freudian "false scents" which are littered through the opening pages of the book, the coincidences centering on the number 342, the Ramsdale class list (starring Aubrey McFate), the elaborate butterfly and fairy-tale motifs, the "cryptogram "Appel's several articles on Nabokov and Lolita are incorporated into his introduction to The Annotated Lolita. Future references to this introduction will be included within the text. *7"Lolita: The Springboard of Parody," in Nabokov: The Man and His Work, p. 120. FICTIONAL ARTIFICE 447</page><page sequence="10">mic paper chase" (L, p. 252) Quilty imposes on Humbert while fleeing with Lolita, and Nabokov's anagrammatic appearance as Vivian Dark bloom, Quilty's collaborator. Appel remarks that "the butterfly motif enables Nabokov to leave behind on H. H.'s pages a trail of his own phosphorescent fingerprints" (L, p. 329), but all of the examples cited above are thought to have the same basic purpose. Quilty's numerous "appearances" might seem Appel's most im pressive evidence, for how many readers have managed to avoid being taken in by the artful insinuation of Quilty into the novel's very texture? Even Field, who notes the book's "realistic" characterizations, agrees that "the reader who pays careful attention to Quilty's appearances must, in the end, question the entire realistic basis of the story."88 But this reasoning is far from self-evident. After all, Humbert himself takes credit for the Quilty theme, as we might call it. When Lolita —now Dolly Schiller—finally reveals the name of her abductor, Humbert reflects: "I, too, had known it [Quilty's name], without knowing it, all along. There was no shock, no surprise. Quietly the fusion took place, and everything fell into order, into the pattern of branches that I have woven through out this memoir with the express purpose of having the ripe fruit fall at the right moment" (L, p. 274). Why should we doubt Humbert's claim that he has planted the numerous references to Quilty—clues which were there all the time, as the novel's events were taking place? Appel's answer is that such "patterns" exhibit "extraordinary narrative control for an allegedly unrevised, first-draft confessional, written during fifty six chaotic days" (L, p. xxviii).29 I would suggest that Appel's argument exhibits an extraordinary literalism for an admirer of Vladimir Nabokov. Would Appel argue that Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an "involuted" fiction because an illiterate thirteen-year-old couldn't possibly write one of America's greatest novels? Would he suggest that we read Great Expectations as a "metafiction" because its narrator seems unaware of the artful fictional patterns he has created? The plain truth is that very few narrators are endowed with the intelligence and artistic sensibility of their creators. It is a fictional convention that we accept their products as artless "confessions" or reports, whereas the best of them are among the most artful of novels (Henry James to the con trary). Indeed, Humbert presents fewer problems in verisimilitude than most fictional narrators, for he is indeed a "well-read Humbert" (L, p. 72) who talks like a book, as Lolita so rudely informs him (L, p. 116). If Lolita is "the most allusive and linguistically playful novel in English since Ulysses (1922) and Finnegans Wake (1939)," as Appel claims (L, "Field, Nabokov: His Life in Art, pp. 327, 34S. "For similar arguments, see pp. 329 and 351 of The Annotated Lolita. 448 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="11">p. ix), Nabokov has gone out of his way to provide a narrator whose literary training and general intelligence are up to the task. As for the argument that Humbert's "confessional" is too artful to be a hurried, unrevised first draft, this calls to mind the complaint that Marlow's au dience would never have listened through his incredibly protracted yarns. The point is just as logically cogent and just as irrelevant. To recognize that Humbert is responsible for the Quilty references should allow us to see that the novel's other "verbal figurations" derive from his unique character, not "the puppeteer's modified voice" which critics persist in hearing behind Humbert's.50 Humbert is "susceptible to the magic of games," as he himself admits (L, p. 235), as well as to the magic of rationalization. If we put the two tendencies together, we should be able to account for almost everything in the novel which has been seen as a "gap" or "hole" in its realistic surface. For example, those Freudian "false scents" are obviously Humbert's creation, for it is Humbert who constantly reminds us of the psychological connection between Annabel and Lolita, Humbert who repeatedly attacks Freud and psychoanalysis, Humbert who claims to know more about the psy choanalytic "racket" than any of his analysts (L, especially pp. 36-37). Similarly, the many references to Edgar Allan Poe will be misunder stood if we turn directly to Nabokov to explain their function;'1 for Humbert compares himself to the American poet quite self-consciously, as we see when he tells a Ramsdale reporter that his name is Mr. Edgar H. Humbert (L, p. 77), then registers at The Enchanted Hunters motel as Dr. Edgar H. Humbert (L, p. 120). Again, it is Humbert himself who notices that his motel room number, like the Haze house number, is 342 (L, p. 120). Later, when Humbert tells us that he registered at 342 hotels, motels, and tourist homes while searching for Quilty and Lolita (L, p. 250), we must be rather innocent not to see this unusually specific number as an example of Humbert's now desperate but still self-conscious susceptibility to the magic of games. We might well ask why Humbert would want to make fun of Freud, invoke Poe, and con jure up "ominous" coincidences. The immediate point is that to ask such questions implies that we can explain the novel's "verbal figura tions" without reference to anything outside its fictive world. The real question is whether there is anything in Lolita which can not be reasonably attributed to the narrator's experiences or peculiar whimsy. Consider two of Appels other examples, Aubrey McFate and the so-called butterfly motif. For Appel, McFate is one of the more con spicuous devices by which Nabokov undermines Humbert's credibility: "Carl R. Proffer, Keys to Lolita (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1968), p. 82.

Aubrey McFate, who is following Humbert, turns up in the middle of the neatly alphabetized Ramsdale class list which Humbert incorporates in his narrative, thus undercutting the inviolable 'reality' of much more than that list."" But of course Aubrey McFate is not really following Humbert. Instead, beginning at page 58, Humbert starts to use Aubrey McFate as his name for that fiendish "force" —destiny, fate itself—which he sees as conspiring against him throughout the novel. The Ramsdale class list has been offered to us on pages 53-54. Isn't it perfectly obvious that McFate turned up in the middle of that class list before Humbert came to personify his wretched destiny? In fact, isn't it clear that Humbert, struck by little Aubrey's interesting surname, simply appropriated "McFate" at the rele vant point several pages later in his "confession"? Why he should want to do this is again the question, but it is hardly the case that Aubrey McFate's name "violates" the reality of the Ramsdale class list. The butterfly motif is a different matter, for it would indeed be unrealistic to suppose that Humbert devised this "pattern"; as Nabokov confirms in Appel's notes to Lolita, Humbert knows absolutely nothing about Lepidoptera (L, p. 328). Nonetheless, Diana Butler's pioneering article on this subject has encouraged others to assume that there is an extensive entomological motif in Lolita which in effect compares Humbert to a detached lepidopterist and Lolita to his "prey," a butter fly." Appel's complete list of the entomological allusions is quite disap pointing, however (L, p. 329). Many of the items amount to nothing more than Humbert calling something a "bug" or "fly" which an en tomologist would be able to identify more specifically (L, pp. 376, 383, 401); others are Humbert's references to himself as a spider, which Appel reminds us is "prominent among the butterfly's natural enemies" (L, p. 356)1 We are asked to believe that Charlotte's former home town, Pisky, is a link in the entomological chain because Pisky means "'moth' in rural English" (L, p. 358). The evidence for a butterfly motif is simply unpersuasive. The supposed references are either impossibly obscure (e.g., "Pisky") or of dubious relevance (e.g., the spider metaphors). The nymph/pupa/metamorphosis cycle, as Appel describes it, is certainly suggestive so far as Humbert's relationship with Lolita is concerned (L, pp. 340-341); but to leap from the nymph/butterfly connection to a "motif' including no fewer than twenty-six references, and then to point out that Humbert is incapable of devising such a motif, is first to manu facture and then to manipulate one's evidence. Perhaps it is relevant stAppel, "Lolita: The Springboard of Parody," p. 118. "See Diana Butler, "Lolita Lepidoptera," New World Writing, No. 16 (Philadelphia, 1960), pp. 58-84. 450 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="13">that Nabokov was extremely critical of Butler's essay: "I happen to remember the essay by a young lady who attempted to find entomolog ical symbols in my fiction. The essay might have been amusing had she known something about Lepidoptera. Alas, she revealed complete ignor ance and the muddle of terms she employed proved to be only jarring and absurd" (SO, p. 96). Appel himself admits that Nabokov "implored the unscientific annotator to omit references to Lepidoptera" in his notes to Lolita (L, p. 329).34 In our search for "unrealistic" elements in Lolita, then, we are left with two pieces of evidence: Quilty's "cryptogrammic paper chase" and Vivian Darkbloom. The problem with Quilty's playful allusions, as Appel shrewdly points out, is that they often refer to matters he is sup posed to know nothing about: "How could Quilty know that earlier in these pages H. H. had used 'Kitzler,' identified 'Aubrey' as his 'McFate,' toyed with Chestnuts, alluded to Eryx (and Venus), and quoted 'While brown Dolores'?" (L, p. 418). This question is unanswerable, for Humbert does attribute to Quilty an allusive range which is realistically impossible. Appel is technically "right." One wonders, however, just how significant this evidence really is. How many readers—even careful readers, "little Nabokovs"" — have noticed the narrative sleight-of-hand to which Appel calls attention? If Nabokov really meant to undermine Humbert's narrative credibility, this sort of device is extraordinarily sub tle and finally, I think, ineffective. The problem with Appel's position on this matter, as well as on Nabokov's anagrammatic signature, Vivian Darkbloom,56 is that he wishes to claim so much on the basis of so little. Further, what he wishes to claim is critically sterile. Appel's conclusion concerning Quilty's improbable knowledge is that "Quilty knows all this —and everything else —because Nabokov wants him to know it, and because Quilty and H. H. can be said to 'exist' only insofar as they have been created by the same man" (L, p. 418). Once again we are told that the "point" to Nabokov's artifice is that it emphasizes the insub stantiality of his fictional creations. I call this conclusion sterile because it undermines what is truly distinguished in Lolita: the creation of one of modern fiction's most interesting and complex characters. Over the years Lolita has inspired a few intelligent discussions "The tenuousness of the butterfly motif is confirmed by contrasting it with the fairy-tale motif, which Appel summarizes on pp. 346-347 of The Annotated Lolita. Notice that the latter almost invar iably involves Humbert's direct references to Lolita or himself. "I am still trying to track down the source of Nabokov's remark that his ideal readers would be "little Nabokovs." Either scholarship will triumph or I will have to revise this sentence. [Leave it. The reference is in Field's Nabokov: His Life in Art, p. 315. —the Eds.] "It must be admitted that "Vivian Darkbloom" is an authorial intrusion of the kind Appel is try ing to detect. Nabokov allowed himself this gesture in a number of his works, of course, regardless of their formal nature. FICTIONAL ARTIFICE 451</page><page sequence="14">which have implicitly treated the book as a novel of character." These readings have suggested that Lolita deals centrally with Humbert's fan tastic attempt to incarnate an impossible, atemporal vision of imperish able bliss. Even Appel has agreed that Humbert's desire "to fix once for all the perilous magic of nymphets" (L, p. 136) is the occasion for Nabokov's "devastating criticism of the reflexive attempt to move out of time."" The novel traces Humbert's attempt to thwart time, then, but also the growth of his awareness that this effort has been both futile and morally criminal, in so far as it has led him to impose his desires on Lolita and thus deprive her of her childhood and her status as an inde pendent being. Whether Humbert really achieves this awareness has been much debated, of course. Some would have it that for once John Ray, Jr. is reliable when he describes the book as "a tragic tale tending unswervingly to nothing less than a tragic apotheosis" (L, p. 7), while others would see Humbert as never arriving at penitence. My aim here is not to resolve this issue, but to point out that the question is indeed central to Nabokov's achievement and deserves the full consideration it never gets when Lolita is treated as an "involuted" fiction. I would add that the question of Humbert's growth is often simpli fied by failing to consider his incorrigible game-playing. Whether or not we agree with Appel's overall approach to Lolita, we must somehow ex plain the verbal gymnastics he points to. Humbert's use of "Aubrey McFate" is quite revealing in this regard. Humbert's little joke asserts his superiority to fate —because he can still "laugh" at it, indeed trivial ize it —while it also calls attention to the "fact" that as a victim of fate he should be relieved of all moral responsibility. The same contradictory motives are seen in Humbert's "playful" treatment of psychoanalysis. On the one hand, his contempt for "the Viennese medicine man" (L, p. 276) —so similar to Nabokov's —reinforces Humbert's self-serving conten tion that nympholepsy provides "an incomparably more poignant bliss" (L, p. 20) than what psychoanalysts would define as "normal" adult sex uality. On the other hand, Humbert suggests at many points, invariably in a serious tone, that his attraction to Lolita is "a fatal consequence" (L, p. 42) of his unsatisfactory childhood experience with Annabel. He is thus a psychological victim, not to be blamed for what comes of his "See Lionel Trilling, "The Last Lover—Nabokov's Lolita," Encounter, 11 (1959), 9-19; Melvin Seiden, "Nabokov and Dostoevsky," Contemporary Literature, 13 (Autumn 1972), 423-444; Michael Bell, "Lolita and Pure Art," Essays in Criticism, 24 (April 1974), 169-184; Brent Harold, "Lolita: Nabokov's Critique of Aloofness," Papers on Language and Literature, 11 (Winter 1975), 71-82; Mathew Winston, "Lolita and the Dangers of Fiction," Twentieth Century Literature, 21 (December 1975), 421-427; William Vesterman, "Why Humbert Shoots Quilty," Essays in Literature, 5 (Spring 1978), 85-93; G.

Humbert's contradictory but equally compelling motives also lie behind the other examples of his ver bal "play." Humbert compares himself to Poe (as well as to much greater artists such as Virgil, Dante, and Petrarch) because the com parison implies that his nympholepsy is anything but a sickness, yet he also sees his "McFate" at work in motel room numbers because such ex ternal coercion suggests that he is indeed a victim of unhappy fate. Humbert's "compensatory jollity," as Appel calls it (JL, p. 371), thus represents his desperate attempt to rationalize the moral implications of his "confession." This attempt is to be seen on nearly every page of Humbert's nar rative, complexly mixed with intermittent recognition of his guilt. On page 18 Humbert tells us that "you have to be an artist and a madman" to appreciate the non-human nature of nymphets; on page 20 he refers to that "incomparably more poignant bliss" provided by your average nymphet; and on page 21 he invokes Virgil, Dante, and Petrarch as his illustrious predecessors. Yet by page 23 he is writing of his "degrading and dangerous desires." Indeed, on the very page that he muses about the poignant bliss of nympholepsy, he also refers to "the dimmest of my pollutive dreams" (L, p. 20). As late as page 142 he is referring to his sexual appetites as "monstrous," yet within thirty pages he assures us that "there is no other bliss on earth comparable to that of fondling a nymphet" (L, p. 168). These are not isolated examples, either, for almost every page reveals Humbert's maddening ambivalence toward his own behavior. Humbert's genius for self-deception is matched only by his capacity to confront and learn from his more horrifying actions, as when he admits how "touching" his despised Charlotte became (L, p. 79) or when he writes that "adult Lotte loved me with a mature, possessive passion that I now deplore and respect more than I care to say" (L, p. 106). The voice we hear in these passages emerges more clearly in the second half of Lolita, as Humbert's champions have been quick to point out; and of course it is in this voice that Humbert renders his late portrait of Rita, that truly touching "good sport" (L, p. 260) who seems to have been introduced so that Humbert might demonstrate his belated maturity. Yet his interlude with Rita is followed almost immediately by Humbert's determined effort to kill Quilty, as if murdering Quilty could somehow shift the entire blame for Lolita's fate to Humbert's perverse "double." Humbert's execution of Quilty is very nearly the last scene in the novel, yet it reveals the same contradictory motives observed earlier. And the murder of Quilty is of course followed by Humbert's "climactic" insight when he overhears the voices of chil dren while waiting to be arrested (L, pp. 309-310). Here, at the very end of his story, Humbert conjures up and seems genuinely affected by FICTIONAL ARTIFICE 453</page><page sequence="16">an image of Lolita's "murdered" childhood, the only crime for which he would pass sentence upon himself (L, p. 310). Is Humbert sincerely con trite at this point? Is he ever to be regarded as "sincere"? The difficulty in answering such questions derives from Humbert's immensely compli cated narration, wherein he "exposes" himself repeatedly while revealing a nature so intelligent and sensitive not even his most pathetic jokes or "verbal figurations" can conceal it. However we interpret the conclusion, then, it should be apparent that our reading depends on how we have responded to Nabokov's pro tagonist throughout the book. Appel's approach to Lolita, taken far enough, leads to such descriptions of the novel as Julia Bader's: "moral taboo merges with literary taboo, and we get the supreme object of literary originality posing as the main character of a novel about liter ary originality."®9 Another critic, traveling the same road, concludes that Nabokov's novels "deal most fundamentally with the nature of creative language."40 My argument is that the nature of our involvement with Humbert, as well as with the other characters, will not support the conclusion that Lolita is "about" literary originality, creative language, art in general, or any similar abstraction. The novel's so-called involu tions are not merely doubtful; in so far as we interpret them as such, they divert us from what is most profoundly appealing in an art which is complex and sophisticated but thoroughly traditional in its basic ends. Anyone who thinks that this is a sentimental approach to Lolita should consider Nabokov's remarks about his title character. In dif ferent interviews Nabokov spoke of his "unfortunate little Lolita," "my poor little girl," and "my little girl's heartrending fate" (SO, pp. 83, 94, 25). No doubt Humbert is to be seen in a rather harsher light, but there is no literary law which dictates that a "sympathetic" character must be loved, vindicated, or otherwise depicted in a "heartrending" fashion. Rather, he must be shown in all his human complexity. He must be shown, in fact, in precisely the manner Nabokov adopted in presenting Humbert Humbert. II Curiously enough, one of the best guides to Invitation to a Behead ing, Bend Sinister, Pale Fire, or Ada (not to mention such byzantine works as Transparent Things) is Appel's introduction to The Annotated "Bader, pp. 66-67. 40Charles Russell, "The Vault of Language: Self-Reflective Artifice in Contemporary American Fiction," Modern Fiction Studies, 20 (Autumn 1974), 357. 454 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="17">Lolita. Almost everything Appel remarks about Lolita applies with much greater cogency to the novels just mentioned. Whether we talk about "involuted" fictions, self-reflexive novels, or fabulations, we are speaking of the highly self-conscious fiction Nabokov did in fact pro duce in almost half of his novels. My quarrel with typical discussions of these works isn't formal, then, but concerned with the supposed "mean ing" of such books. As I remarked earlier, we have been told repeatedly that Nabokov's more artificial novels either have no meaning at all or deal with the single theme of art. I think that neither assertion is defen sible. Nabokov did insist that his books had "no moral in tow" (L, p. 316), but such statements were clearly intended to deny a didactic or propagandists intention. That Nabokov acknowledged the thematic im plications of his works is suggested by his characterization of Invitation to a Beheading and Bend Sinister as "absolutely final indictments of Russian and German totalitarianism" (SO, p. 156). This is not to say that either book can be reduced to such a proposition, but that the meaning of each work constitutes, among other things, just such an "in dictment." This meaning would also seem to involve a theme other than art, for art and totalitarianism are not exactly synonymous. I wish to pursue the problem of "meaning" in Nabokov's fabulations by discussing the thematic implications of Pale Fire, one of Nabokov's most respected but least explicated novels. To refer to Pale Fire as one of Nabokov's least explicated novels should underline the issue here, for Pale Fire has been the subject of numerous critical studies. Unhappily, these studies have tended to con firm Michael Rosenblum's remark that "much of the best writing on Nabokov takes the form of annotation."41 I would add that much of the worst writing also takes this form. Indeed, critics have been a good deal more enthusiastic about annotating the details of Pale Fire than ex plaining the work's governing principle. In Robert Alter's elegant formulation, "The besetting sin of criticism . . . has been merely to un cover intricate patterns of the novel's formal games and then to assume that intricacy itself is sufficient evidence of masterful imaginative achievement. . . . the essential question to be faced is what purpose the design really serves."41 Alter seems to be referring obliquely to Mary McCarthy's famous review of Pale Fire, in which McCarthy analyzes the novel's "games" at great length but devotes a single sentence to the work's meaning: "Love is the burden of Pale Fire, love and loss."45 Field, on the other hand, tells us that the novel's subject is death, not love.44 Neither critic is very informative when it comes to what exactly 41Rosenblum, p. 221. «Alter, p. 186. ""Vladimir Nabokov's 'Pale Fire,'" Encounter, 19 (1962), 81. "Field, Nabokov: His Life in Art, p. 300. FICTIONAL ARTIFICE 455</page><page sequence="18">Nabokov wished to say about either love or death. One problem is that even such forceful critics as McCarthy seem cowed by Nabokov's dramatic warnings against finding "messages" in his novels—as if all meanings were messages, and vice-versa. Not wishing to be caught in the vulgar activity of symbol-hunting, or meaning-mongering, they have contented themselves with uncovering the intricate patterns of Nabokov's formal games, as Alter notes. But of course there is a second problem, one which cannot be willed away. Pale Fire is one of the most difficult novels yet published in a century famous for difficult novels. This difficulty is such that one of the very few original readings of the book, that by John Lyons, seems to me to arrive at precisely the opposite of Nabokov's meaning. Whereas Lyons takes Nabokov to be arguing that "because there is such a perversely organized planet there must be a divine disorganizing principle," that is, "an inscrutable Deity,"45 I believe that Pale Fire is profoundly skepti cal about such claims to cosmic faith. How should we decide this issue? I am confident that my view can be supported by Nabokov's public statements on religion, e.g., his rejection of the religiosity of his own early poems as "a stylistic pose,"46 his comments on Pasternak's "sickly sweet brand of Christianism," his assertion that "Philosophically, I am an in divisible monist," his frank admission that religion never meant anything to him (SO, pp. 206, 85, 160). But this tactic begs the ques tion of what in the work supports Lyons' view or my own. In fact, it begs the more urgent question of what in the work encourages us to ask such a question in the first place. Why should we concern ourselves with Nabokov's religious or philosophical opinions? The answer to this question should help explain the novel's notori ous difficulty. Pale Fire differs from Lolita in that it focuses on general questions of belief rather than the particularized fates of its characters. Shade and Kinbote are sufficiently interesting that it is all too easy to overlook the fact that Nabokov has made no real effort to develop them in the manner of Humbert Humbert or Pnin. Douglas Fowler has noticed that Kinbote is an especially "inconsistent" character, the vehicle of Nabokov's most farcical humor (Kinbote as pederast, pedant, and vege tarian) but also for a number of suspiciously Nabokovian speeches. Who is speaking in the following passage, which describes the technique of a Zemblan painter, Eystein, "master of the trompe d'oeil": "This device which was apparently meant to enhance the effect of his tactile and tonal values had, however, something ignoble about it and disclosed not only an essential flaw in Eystein's talent, but the basic fact that 'reality' "John O. Lyons, "Pale Fire and the Fine Art of Annotation," in Nabokov: The Man and His Work, p. 157. "Field, Nabokov: His Life in Part, p. 88. 456 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="19">is neither the subject nor the object of true art which creates its own special reality having nothing to do with the average 'reality' perceived by the communal eye" (PF, p. 130)? Whose voice describes in such splendid anguish Charles the Beloved's inability to love his Disa (PF, pp. 209-212)? Who tells us at the end of the commentary that he may "turn up yet, on another campus, as an old, happy, healthy, heterosexual Russian, a writer in exile, sans fame, sans future, sans audience, sans anything but his art" (PF, pp. 300-301)? Do these passages really derive from Kinbote/Botkin, who speaks so often and so fatuously of "manlier pleasures"?47 Fowler notes that Kinbote is an impossibly "complicated" character, one whose alternating foolishness and Nabokovian wisdom cannot be reconciled, and I would agree. This is not an artistic failure on Nabokov's part, however, as Fowler argues,4* but rather a conspic uous sign that Nabokov's intentions here are not those of a realistic or traditional novelist. No less than Gradus, Shade and Kinbote function in Pale Fire like those inspired puppets Appel sees everywhere in Nabokov's canon. To focus on the complications of their "story" is, I think, to conclude with Fowler that Nabokov has simply failed. Given the novel's obvious brilliance, such a conclusion declares its own bank ruptcy. Nabokov's treatment of character forces us to look elsewhere for the novel's controlling principle. This doesn't require that we look to Nabokov's general beliefs, but the book's peculiar organization strongly suggests that we should do so. Indeed, we are perplexed by the structure of Pale Fire long before we come to understand the nature of its charac terizations. The novel's parts are those of a scholarly edition, of course, consisting here of John Shade's last poem, "Pale Fire," and the in troduction, commentary, and index of his good "friend" and colleague, Charles Kinbote. The parody of a critical edition is so broad, however, beginning with the first page of Kinbote's incredible introduction, that we are immediately confronted with the question of what this book is really about. This question is all the more compelling as we move through the novel's several parts and discover that there is almost liter ally no connection between poem and commentary. We are forced to do one of two things. Either we must abandon the book as a hopeless mud dle, or we must try to put it together as something other than Kinbote's "critical" edition. One method of doing this is to look for hints in poem and commentary which will unravel the "real" story involving John and Sybil Shade, Kinbote (or Botkin), and Shade's assassin, Gradus (or Jack Grey). I have already suggested that such an approach is ultimately «'For other passages clearly in Nabokov's and not Kinbote's voice, see pp. 198-99, 203-204, 24S-245, 278-279.

Pursued far enough, this line of inquiry reveals only that Kinbote/Botkin is a lunatic, albeit a very sympathetic lunatic, whose famous neighbor, John Shade, was very nice to him before the terrible accident which took Shade's life. In fact, given the way in which Kin bote is "characterized," we might well ask what the value of this approach could possibly be. It seems to me that we must inevitably con sider the novel's structural oddities in a different, rather more intellec tual light. That is, we must ask ourselves what such a poem and such a commentary have in common. Why has Nabokov juxtaposed these ap parently independent artifacts? As a critical commentary on Shade's "Pale Fire," Kinbote's notes are of course utter nonsense; finally they are as different from John Shade's poem as Kinbote is different from Shade. But the problem with this observation is that many readers have been very much taken with Kinbote's story of the fantastic Zemblan revolution. The commentary may have nothing to do with "Pale Fire," but it can be seen as a considerable achievement in its own right. In deed, it can be seen as a work of art. Here, of course, we come upon the connection between poem and commentary. Different as they are, the two are nonetheless related as works of art, the products of radically different and yet equally compelling artistic imaginations. We seem to be moving into that ultra-familiar subject, Nabokov's conception of art and the artist. The subject of art is indeed crucial in Pale Fire, but it is by no means the novel's theme. I take Field to be nearer the truth when he observes that Nabokov's topic is death. More precisely, Pale Fire deals with man's need "to fight the utter degrada tion, ridicule, and horror of having developed an infinity of sensation and thought within a finite existence" (SM, p. 219). As Nabokov goes on to say in this passage from his autobiography, Speak, Memory, love is one of our most important "weapons" in such a fight; art is obviously another. It will be clear, I trust, that Shade's poem is an example of the struggle defined above, for the poem explicitly confronts the very prob lem—our finite existence —Nabokov cites in the passage I have quoted, and does so in an elaborate artistic form—in Popean couplets, no lessl It is a good deal less obvious that Kinbote's commentary is an example of anything save vanity, intellectual confusion, and massive wish-fulfill ment. But Shade himself gives us the clue to the nature of Kinbote's effort. When someone calls Kinbote a madman or lunatic, Shade replies, "'That is the wrong word. . . . One should not apply it to a person who deliberately peels off a drab and unhappy past and replaces it with a brilliant invention.'" Such a person is actually "a fellow poet" (PF, p. 238). No less than Shade's "Pale Fire," Kinbote's commentary should be read as an artistic response to the "unhappy" realities of past, present, and future, the most devastating of which is of course death. 458 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="21">The problem with this notion is that while Kinbote's commentary does seem "a brilliant invention" —one critic has called it "Shakespear ean" in character49 —it hardly seems "deliberately" crafted in the way that Shade's poem is crafted. Indeed, it seems to be precisely what it "really" is, i.e., the paranoid fantasy of one V. Botkin, who projects his petty academic quarrels onto the fabulous fictional landscape of Zembla, "a distant northern land" (PF, p. 315). Shade's artistic control is almost the last thing one would associate with the commentary. On the other hand, how many readers have felt that "Pale Fire" is "a brilliant invention"? Shade's poem has even been taken as a parody, not, I would suggest, because Nabokov intended it as such, but because he has tried to define Shade's limitations by attributing to him a seriously flawed masterpiece. (This would explain why Nabokov once referred to the composition of "Pale Fire" as one of the two most dif ficult artistic tasks he ever undertook [SO, p. 55].) Shade's poem and Kinbote's commentary are works of art, written to assert the value of "an infinity of sensation and thought within a finite existence," but they are imperfect works which tell us more about the limitations of art than its supreme value. The limitations of Kinbote's "art" are obvious enough, for it is quite impossible to imagine that his commentary was consciously contrived to assert anything, let alone the value of an infinity of sensation and thought. Those who speak of Kinbote's "Shakespearean" qualities don't mean to imply that he is the Bard's equal, but they do imply a compar able intention on Kinbote's part which is simply misleading. It is rather more to the point, and rather more difficult, to define the limitations of Shade's art. "Pale Fire" and its author's philosophy are sympathetic but inadequate responses to the "unhappy past," that is, to life. The poem is a fascinating, not quite successful attempt to synthesize the poetic qualities of Pope (especially the Pope of An Essay on Man and the Moral Essays) and Wordsworth (especially the Wordsworth of "Tintern Abbey" and The Prelude).** Shade writes in the verse form of his aca demic specialty, Pope, employing the four-part structure of the Essay and the inevitable pentameter couplets, but his subject matter is quintessential Wordsworth—his childhood experiences, relationship with nature, and intimations of immortality. Shade's poetic stance is also Wordsworthian, constituting a highly personal meditation upon his own past. The famous "climax" to this meditation involves a series of propo sitions which seem directly in Wordsworth's tradition, yet remind us as well of Pope's faith in a providential universe: 4,See Alter, pp. 202-204. "Several critics have remarked the Pope/Wordsworth connection, but see especially Field, Nabokov: His Life in Art, pp. 106-113. FICTIONAL ARTIFICE 459</page><page sequence="22">But all at once it dawned on me that this Was the real point, the contrapuntal theme; Just this: not text, but texture; not the dream But topsy-turvical coincidence, Not flimsy nonsense, but a web of sense. YesI It sufficed that I in life could find Some kind of link-and-bobolink, some kind Of correlated pattern in the game, Plexed artistry, and something of the same Pleasure in it as they who played it found. (PF, pp. 62-6S, 11. 806-815) This passage doesn't quite bespeak a Christian faith comparable to Pope's, but it does assert what Maynard Mack finds in An Essay on Man: an affirmation of "the life, quality, design, direction, and objec tive meaning of man's experienced world."51 And it is followed, at the end of Shade's poem, by a personal declaration of poetic and cosmic faith which echoes Wordsworth's most spirited celebrations: I feel I understand Existence, or at least a minute part Of my existence, only through my art, In terms of combinational delight; And if my private universe scans right, So does the verse of galaxies divine Which I suspect is an iambic line. I'm reasonably sure that we survive And that my darling somewhere is alive. As I am reasonably sure that I Shall wake at six tomorrow, on July The twenty-second, nineteen fifty-nine. And that the day will probably be fine. (PF, pp. 68-69, 11. 971-982) The reference to "my darling" is to Shade's daughter, Hazel, who has committed suicide. Shade's meditation is inspired by this death and leads to the general contemplation of our finite existence already noted. Here Shade's romantic assertion of an equivalence between his "private universe" and "galaxies divine" leads on to an assertion of personal immortality (though Shade's modernity is no doubt reflected in his "rea sonably sure"). If art is indeed a weapon in our fight against the extinc tion of all sensation and thought, Shade and his poem are here to tell us that this contest can be won. It can be won because life ultimately reveals "a web of sense," not the "flimsy nonsense" it appears to be. Shade's confident conclusion lies behind the oft-expressed view that Nabokov means to assert that "artistic perception and design can trans cend human fortunes and misfortunes; chaos can be ordered by trans 5lMaynard Mack, "Introduction," An Elssay on Man (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1950), p. lxv. 460 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="23">forming the world into significant aesthetic form."58 I fear that this optimistic view is not really Nabokov's. Shade is as sure of his conclusion as he is that he will wake at six o'clock the next morning, but of course he will be murdered within moments after writing these "final" lines to his poem. The irony has been noticed by others, but no one has made much of it. Yet surely it undercuts the buoyancy of Shade's conclusion, his extravagant conviction that the "galaxies" are structured after the orderly pattern of an iambic line, i.e., art. We may impose our aesthetic orders where we will, but the world will never conform to our predilection for order, just as it will never conform to the patterns commemorated in Pope's Essay and Wordsworth's Prelude. As Nabokov once said, "We shall never know the origin of life, or the meaning of life, or the nature of space and time, or the nature of nature, or the nature of thought" (50, p. 45). Art is valuable because "it has to do with order, and creates little worlds of its own, possessing internal harmony, in the bosom of this disordered planet," as E. M. Forster once observed;55 but Nabokov knew very well that art's "little worlds" had value precisely because they did not corres pond to the world at large, a world whose "line" is only intermittently and randomly "iambic." "The cradle rocks above an abyss, and com mon sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of life between two eternities of darkness" (SM, p. 19). So Nabokov begins Speak, Memory, a work in which he describes his own futile efforts to escape the "prison" of time (SM, pp. 20-21). To refer to Nabokov's efforts as "futile" is misleading, of course. The works of art which derive from these efforts are to be valued so long as men continue to interest themselves in the written word. For that matter, Shade's poem and Kinbote's "crazy" commentary are to be valued as examples of the invaluable human desire "to express one's position in regard to the universe embraced by consciousness," which Nabokov took to be "an immemorial urge" (SM, p. 218). But neither should we forget that the cradle does rock above an abyss, that the im mortality Nabokov confers on such characters as Adam Krug (Bend Sinister) is, as he acknowledges, "a slippery sophism, a play upon words" (BS, p. 241). There will always be, as Kinbote/Nabokov reminds us in the last lines of Pale Fire (excepting the index), "a bigger, more respectable, more competent Gradus" (PF, p. 301) to shatter the iambic lines of our imagination. Thus the paradox at the heart of Pale Fire: art is the most precious human product, yet art makes nothing happen.

The interpretation of Pale Fire sketched above is obviously incom plete, and I don't mean to present it as any kind of final word on this terribly complex novel. I do mean to suggest that some such reading is what the novel calls for, not the vague generalizations about "art" which Nabokov's fabulations usually inspire. As in my treatment of Lolita, I also want to suggest that our general understanding of this very great writer and his several works is radically imperfect, based as it is on our inadequate grasp of his various formal ends. We will never get to the bottom of Nabokov, just as we will never know the origin of life, but whatever understanding we can achieve will come from approaching his work in a more flexible manner than has been the case since Nabokov ceased to be, in his own words, "an obscure, doubly obscure, novelist with an unpronounceable name" (SO, p. 107).54 "I wish to thank the Research Advisory Board of the University of Nevada, Reno, for a summer grant which supported the writing of this essay. 462</page></plain_text>
