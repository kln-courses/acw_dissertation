<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEND SINISTER AND THE NOVELIST AS ANTHROPOMORPHIC DEITY Susan Fromberg Schaeffer I Bend Sinister1 occupies a pivotal place in the Nabokov canon, for it is in this work that Nabokov explicitly form ulates the beliefs implicit in The Eye, Invitation to a Be heading, and The Real Life of Sebastian Knight: that there is an ultimate artificer of human existence, and that one of the best tools for discovering the ultimate meaning of life and death is not philosophy but art. So cleverly is this novel constructed that on a first reading the reader is likely to see little of Nabokov's attempt to solve the rid dle of life and death, for this attempt is not made within, but beneath, the confines of the ostensible plot. Thus, for most readers, Bend Sinister will not be a philosophic novel in which the author competes with his own creature, the philosopher Adam Krug, to discover the pattern in the carpet of the mortal world; it will only seem to be a novel which graphically and masterfully describes the plight of an exceedingly intelligent man in an astoundingly mo ronic and bestial dictatorship. It is in the last scenes that Nabokov reveals what the alert reader must have suspected all along: Bend Sinister is far more than a satirical work attacking the evils of tyr anny. The novel has seen Adam Krug refuse to sign a document supporting Paduk, his childhood schoolmate, and the dictator of the terror state; it has seen the state arrest his friends, and murder his child, and, in the last scene, Krug is brought to a "confrontation ceremony" in the prison yard to which he himself has been taken. Here, i Vladimir Nabokov, Bend Sinister (London: Corgi Books, i960). All sub sequent references to this edition will be made in the text. 1 1</page><page sequence="2">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW he is to confront twenty of his friends; their lives will be spared if he promises to support the document pledging his support of the state. What the assembly does not know is that suffering (in the first scenes of the novel, Krug's wife dies when a dangerous kidney operation fails to save her) has driven him mad, and that sight of all his old friends makes him believe that he is back in his boyhood, back in his old schoolyard. When an old friend severely cautions Krug that, "The days we pup-played in this very yard are gone," the remark has unexpected results. Krug snatches the man's hat: It was a sissy sealskin bonnet. The boy, with a stutter of rage, tried to retrieve it. Adam Krug threw it to Pinkie Schimpffer, who, in turn, threw it up a snow-fringed amassment of stacked birch logs where it stuck. Schramm ran back into the school house to complain. The Toad, homeward bound, stealthily walked along the low wall towards the exit. Adam Krug slung his book satchel across his shoulder and remarked to Schimpffer that it was funny—did Schimpffer also get sometimes that feel ing of "repeated sequence," as if all this had already happened before: fur cap, I threw it to you, you threw it up, logs, snow on logs, cap got stuck, the Toad came out...? Being of a practical turn of mind, Schimpffer suggested they better give the Toad a good fright. The two boys watched him from behind the logs. The Toad stopped nearer the wall, apparently waiting for Mamsch. With a tremendous huzza, Krug led the attack.... In a burst of vigorous speed, Krug was running towards the wall, where Paduk, his features dissolving in the water of fear, had slipped from his chair, and was trying to vanish. The yard seethed in wild commotion. Krug dodged the embrace of a guard. Then, the left side of his head seemed to burst into flames (that first bullet took off part of his ear), but he stumbled on cheerfully: "Come on, Schrimp, come on," he roared without looking back, "let us trim him, let us get at his guts, come on!" He saw the Toad crouching at the foot of the wall, shaking, dissolving, speeding up with his shrill incantations, protecting his dimming face with his transparent arm, and Krug ran towards him, and just a fraction of an instant before another and better bullet hit him, he shouted again: You you—and the wall vanished, like a rapidly withdrawn slide, and I stretched 1 1 б</page><page sequence="3">BEND SINISTER myself and got up from among the chaos of written and re written pages, to investigate that sudden twang that something had made in striking the wire netting of my window. As I had thought, a big moth was clinging with furry feet to the netting, on the night's side. . . . Well, that was all. The various parts of my comparative paradise, the bedside lamp, the sleeping tablets, the glass of milk—looked with perfect submission in my eyes. I knew that the immortality I had con ferred upon the poor fellow was a slippery sophism, a play on words. But the very last lap of his life had been happy and it had been proven to him that death was but a question of style, (pp. 221-2) The last scene, which ends with the appearance of the author, and his surprising assertion that "death was but a matter of style," strongly suggest that satirizing tyranny is not the core which animates Bend Sinister, for, if it were, many sections of the novel would be irrelevant to the main design. The whole of Chapter 12, for example, describes the notes for an essay Krug had once intended to write. The notes have nothing whatever to do with tyr anny, and the narrator remarks that Krug would never write that essay "because by now he had forgotten its lead ing idea, its secret combination," (p. 143) and the matter of the mysterious essay is dropped. Nor is it clear why Nabokov should have made his main character a philoso pher. Krug never really thinks about the philosophic im plications of the new government: he begins to take notice of it only when he realizes that tyranny, like kidney dis ease, can kill. The part Krug has to play in the ostensible plot could be taken as competently by an intelligent plumber, historian, or marine biologist. Nabokov's narrative technique also hints at something lurking just beneath the surface of Bend Sinister. If his primary intention was to attack tyranny by representing all its horrors, then it is unlikely he would have taken the chances the fictional author of the novel is so will ing to take. By repeatedly refusing to stay behind the 117</page><page sequence="4">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW scenes, the "author" of the novel commits the single sin Henry James pronounced anathema in the creative artist: our author not only admits that the world he has created is make-believe, but he clambers on stage among his crea tures, and in so doing, threatens the effectiveness of the dramatic illusion he has just taken such pains to create. In the final scene, the author virtually dares his readers to sustain their belief in the puppets so suddenly overshad owed by the silhouette of the puppeteer. So inevitably and so drastically does the ending of the novel detract from its dramatic impact that it might be tempting to assume that Nabokov had not yet fully perfected his con trol of point of view. It is more likely, though, that Na bokov was in such perfect control of his material that he could, if necessary, afford to take chances with his readers. Bend Sinister, coming as it does after The Eye, Despair, and The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, all of which dem onstrate remarkable sophistication in handling difficult and unusual dramatic techniques, must be considered a mature work; it seems likely that Nabokov deliberately sacrificed dramatic intensity to something more important. The intrusive author of Bend Sinister (a character not to be confused with Nabokov, the "real" author) thrusts himself upon the reader throughout the work, and hid den in his rude intrusions is the shoe-shaped door to the hid den dimension of Bend Sinister. The opening and closing scenes differ drastically from the rest of the novel. They are set in the author's real world, and in these scenes, the author speaks in his own voice, simultaneously commenting on Adam Krug's story, and describing the physical appearance of his own "com parative paradise." With the exception of these scenes, and a handful of comments made by the narrator as he tells Krug's story, the novel is a third person narrative set in the fictional country of Padukgrad. The opening and closing scenes thus encircle the sphere of Adam Krug's world and enclose that sphere within the sphere of the l 18</page><page sequence="5">BEND SINISTER author's real world. Like Finnegan's Wake, Bend Sinister is circular: the novel begins with a description of what the author sees from his window at four-thirty in the after noon, and it ends with a description (a negative picture) of what he sees from that same window at two o'clock at night. Within the larger circle of the narrator's world spins the smaller circle of Adam Krug's world, so that the novel itself has the concentric form of a circle within a circle. The inner circle is created by the artist's imagina tion; the outer circle is the real world of the author. In Bend Sinister, Nabokov attempts to investigate the rela tion between these two spheres of experience in order to prepare the way for investigating the problem of life and death. Krug himself never solved this problem, for as the narrator tells us, "Krug could take aim at a flock of the most popular and sublime human thoughts and bring down a wild goose any time. But he could not kill death." (P- 34) The narrative technique of the opening scene is peculiar, and it focuses the reader's attention on the relation of "inner" and "outer"—or the relation between the real world and the imagined one. The opening paragraphs of the novel describe everything visible from the author's window. The first is an elaborate description of a kidney shaped puddle together with the shapes reflected on its mirror-like surface. A description of the two trees cutting laterally across the grey sky follows, but the inventory of the physical world is suddenly interrupted when the au thor slides without warning into the imaginary world he is about to create. He labels the view he has just begun to describe (the view from his bedroom window)—"View from a hospital window." (p. 7) The author then turns away from the coalescing world of the novel, and resumes describing his real world, but again interrupts himself to rapidly sketch in the outlines of the novel's developing plot: "The operation has not been successful and my wife will die." (p. 8) The expanding world of Bend Sinister 1 19</page><page sequence="6">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW again dips beneath the horizon of the author's real world as the author again focuses on the house across the street and continues sketching the scene outside. As he writes, the day fades, leaving the scene an "achromatic copy of the painting previously seen." (p. 9) This curious starting and stopping might make an unsophisticated reader won der whether Nabokov had decided where to begin his book when he actually began writing. The narrator of Nabokov's Despair, another author reluctant to take the plunge into the icy waters of creation, beautifully carica tures the awkward picture such an author presents: "It may look as though I do not know how to start. Funny sight, the elderly gentleman who comes lumbering by, jowl flesh flopping, in a valiant dash for the last bus, which he eventually overtakes but is afraid to board in motion and so, with a sheepish smile, drops back, still going at a trot." (p. 13) Here, the author's hesitancy does have a purpose, and its purpose is to create a certain functional confusion. Whose windows are we looking out of: the author's or those of the as-yet-unnamed character with a dying wife? The sense is not at all clear. Nor was it meant to be, for Nabokov is using a stylistic technique to make a point which, in the novel, he never explicitly makes; the artist's created world is always tied to his real world— the mosaic of the created world always shares or borrows something from the world of the creator. Adam Krug's world and the author's world share a view from a bedroom window. By permitting the reader to observe the author in his workshop, Nabokov calls attention to the artistic process underlying the book and permits his reader to deduce the nature and extent of the links between the author's real and created worlds. Throughout the novel, the authorial intrusions remind the reader of the many links between the world of Adam and his creator. When Krug's car reaches the site of the University meeting, it seems to have taken the author along as an invisible passenger. Dr. Alexander, the driver of 12 0</page><page sequence="7">BEND SINISTER the car, gets out, disappears, and reappears from inside the house. He does this with such remarkable speed that the author is vaguely reminded of something remarkable that happened once before, and after several futile attempts to jog his memory, finally realizes that his description of Dr. Alexander's speedy appearance at the head of the stairs was somehow prompted by a speedy elevator he used to take. (p. 40) The author again lends Krug a vi sion from his world later, when he interrupts his clinical, third-person description of the repulsive Toad to re mark that, "I never noticed his eyes, or else his eyes have changed." (p. 134) Later, the narrator again shifts sud denly from third to first person narration, and in so do ing, hints at another link between Krug and himself. As Krug returns to Padukgrad from the Institute for Ab normal Children, his car follows the same route Olga and he followed the night of their car accident. The present trip recalls the past one. The author tells us that "Ember was trying to recall the American name for a similar kind of fir tree in the Rocky Mountains. Two things happened together: Ember said 'Douglas' and a dazzled doe plunged into the blaze" (and here the sudden shift from third to first person occurs) "of our lights." (p. 208, italics added) The accident, then, originally took place in the author's world; later he lent it to Krug and Olga, just as, in the opening scenes, the author lends Krug the view from his bedroom window. One group of authorial intrusions, then, serves to re mind the reader that the artist always includes bits and pieces of his "outer" world (thoughts, experiences, en vironment) in the "inner" world he creates; another group defines the extent of the power the artist has over his creatures of the inner circle. When Krug is summoned to the University's emergency meeting, the author proudly announces that Krug's car was obtained by "the magician in our midst"; that magician is, of course, the author, (p. 37) The only limits to the magician's power are 1 2 1</page><page sequence="8">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW self-imposed. The author is a magician, but he is also an artist, and hence a stylist. He is free to do anything he thinks justified by the ends he hopes to achieve. A finished book is the result of a long series of stylistic choices, con scious or unconscious, among all the possible methods of rendering a scene and among the many possible events which eventually make up the plot. Most novelists take great care to conceal this process. In order to maintain the dramatic illusion, to promote the suspension of disbelief, they make their created world seem as autonomous as possible, as independent of the creator as possible. But, in Bend Sinister, Nabokov repeatedly takes the reader be hind the scenes to watch the novel slowly taking shape in the hands of its creator. Krug's first interview with the grown Toad, Paduk, reveals the author choosing, god-like, among the many possible "realities" of Krug's world. The confrontation between the two ex-playmates, Krug and the Toad, is an uproarious one—every single move Krug makes meets with the instant and emphatic disapproval of hidden ob servers. At the end of this farcical scene, (p. 136) the narrator abruptly jerks the magic carpet out from under his reader; he announces that the interview was not really at all as he described it, and then proceeds to describe a totally different version. Both sat still, drummed nerv ously on desk and chair. Paduk said little except "curt platitudes." One version of the scene is a comic portrayal of the preposterous stupidity of the state, the other, a portrayal of the hum-drum, routine, altogether monoto nous workings of that totally uninteresting political phe nomenon. Instead of combining the versions, or choosing between them, Nabokov includes both. The second ver sion is the most realistic; the first, the most entertaining. Which should be chosen? By presenting both versions, the author forces the reader to momentarily experience the power of the artist. If the artist wants the reader to believe in the reality of his characters, then he will be 1 2 2</page><page sequence="9">BEND SINISTER tempted to choose one version of the scene as "real." Whether or not the reader is aware of his tendency to do this, the point still has been made: the fate of a character in a work of fiction only seems inevitable; the author him self determines it at will; he can also change it—he is the ultimate arbiter of possibilities and potentialities. II Nabokov is particularly anxious to demonstrate the ex tent of the author's power in matters of life and death. At the moment of Krug's greatest pain, the author slyly re minds us that Krug is only a character in a novel; his tragedy takes place, not in the real world, but in the fic tional "inner" world of Bend Sinister. Thus, when a fran tic Krug accuses a clerk of having delegated the men who abducted David, Kolokololiteischchikov (Gogol's Chich ikov) protests: "I did not delegate anybody. You are in the presence of an underpaid chinovik. As a matter of fact, I deplore everything that has happened in Russian literature." (p. 194) In other words, Krug's happiness or misery depends not on fate nor on Krug's own actions, nor yet on Paduk—but on the artist's decision. In the final scenes, the author permits the State to destroy Krug; David's death added the finishing touches to the brutal and bestial picture Nabokov set out to paint. Hence, the author is now free to let Krug suffer "the senseless agony of his logical fate" or to somehow relieve his suffering. To torment Krug further is "logical," but unnecessary, and the author realizes this. When Krug returns to Pa dukgrad and prison, he has nothing further to lose. His wife has died; his child has been murdered. He falls asleep in his cell, dreams, and then the author throws a switch and the train of Krug's life moves onto a different and happier track; "at that moment," says the author, just after Krug had fallen through the bottom of a confused dream and sat up on the straw with a gasp—and just before his reality, his remembered hideous misfortune could pounce 123</page><page sequence="10">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW upon him—it was then that I felt a pang of pity for Adam and slid towards him along an inclined beam of pale light—causing instantaneous madness, but at least saving him from the sense less agony of his logical fate. (pp. 214-5) In his ability to decide matters of life and death, the author resembles God, for in his created world, he has all the powers of the conventional deity. Yet there is some thing in the traditional imagery Nabokov chooses to de scribe the artist-god which implies that the author does more than merely "resemble" or "impersonate" God. The author appears as God to his creature Adam; he comes to him as a beam of light and in a flash of divine madness, Adam moves closer to the "comparative paradise" of his pitying creator, the anthropomorphic deity (p. 137) writing the book. The imagery implies that the au thor-god acquires his power over his creatures by actually stealing a spark of the divine flame of creation. (The impor tance of this will be evident later.) This concept is strength ened by succeeding events. As Adam moves closer and closer to death, he begins to sense the existence of a mode of being beyond his own. As the divinely-made Krug listens to the sounds of the night in his dark prison cell, he hears the heartbeats of younger men noiselessly digging an under ground passage to freedom and recapture, the pattering sound made by the excrementa of bats, the cautious crackling of a page which had been viciously crumpled and thrown in a wastepaper basket and was making a pitiful effort to un crumple itself and live just a little longer, (p. 215) This sheet of paper seems to be uncrumpling somewhere in the author's wastepaper basket—yet Krug hears it in his world, his world which is slowly beginning to dissolve. When Krug charges across the schoolyard toward the Toad and death, the tissue of his world becomes thinner and thinner until it threatens to disclose what lies beyond the "inner circle"—the comparative paradise of the author god's workshop. In the last scene, the fabric rips; the Toad 124</page><page sequence="11">BEND SINISTER protects his "dimming face" with his "transparent arm," and as a bigger and better bullet finds Adam Krug, the wall between his world and the author's vanishes, and the author, "amidst a chaos of written and rewritten pages," is finally disclosed. In a rather patronizing tone, he an nounces that he has proven to Krug that "death was but a question of style"; in the end, the artist controls his character's fate. The authorial intrusions, then, constantly focus the reader's attention on the creative process underlying the finished work, and two aspects of this process receive par ticular emphasis. First, the author-god always leaves his fingerprints upon the created world; secondly, the author is god within his created world. These two ideas live very close to the heart of Bend Sinister, for they explain the purpose of an extensive and elaborate thematic structure which underlies its every scene. This thematic structure, like the authorial intrusions, serves to emphasize the power and presence of the author-god. In the opening scenes, the author mentions two seemingly unimportant and irrele vant images visible from his bedroom window: these two images evolve into the two "core" images of the book. The first and most important of these is the kidney-shaped puddle, the fancy footprint, described by the opening par agraph of the novel. The second is the image of the glass of milk and sleeping tablets which the author sees on his desk as he writes, (p. 222) Seen from above, the tablets and glass of milk form circles, or balls, of different sizes. Since these images are present both in Krug's world, and that of his creator, they establish points of tangency between the two spheres; they link Krug's world with that of his cre ator. These images also remind us of the god-like powers of the artist. Chapter five describes a long dream of Krug's; this dream is a prophetic one; it fortells Krug's future, and in it, the two "core" images of the novel are firmly and systematically associated with impending disasters; the images thus acquire the status of prophetic omens or 125</page><page sequence="12">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW signs. They seem to be the symbols of the divine, secret language which the God of the novel uses to communicate with his Adam. The subject of Krug's prophetic dream seems to be the "embarrassing return to one's former existence (with the off-stage passing of years translated in terms of forgetful ness, truancy, inefficiency)," (p. 60) the old dream about the man who finds himself back in his childhood classroom unable to do the lessons because of unwittingly having missed "ten thousand days of school." Although the dream seems to recapitulate Krug's school days, the organization of it is not chronological. As the author tells us, the dream "bristled with farcical anachronism; it was suffused with a sense of gross maturity (as in Hamlet the churchyard scene): its somewhat meager setting was patched up with odds and ends from other (later) plays." (p. 60) The dream is really an elaborate collage of past, present, and future time. Each event it describes may be compared to the kind of picture formed when several transparencies are laid upon one another; the composite picture owes some thing to each layer. The incidents in Krug's dream are constructed on this principle, each superimposing the three zones of time. Thus, the description of Krug's trip through a tunnel to the schoolyard where he is to play soccer is also a description of the final scene in which Krug travels from prison to that same schoolyard, there to play a final, fatal game with those same schoolmates. Later, when Krug fol lows his soccer ball into another tunnel, he is simulta neously travelling through the same tunnel he finds him self in after leaving Peter Quist's antique shop. Both tunnels are peopled with "workmen fixing wires or some thing" among a "tangle of rickety scaffolding." Incidents in the dream which appear as simple flashbacks are de ceptive, for they too superimpose time: they foreshadow later events. The Headmaster of Krug's school decided to develop the politico-socio consciousness of his boys and had them organize their own political parties. Krug stayed 1 2 6</page><page sequence="13">BEND SINISTER aloof, but Paduk collected the assorted misfits (one of whom had beheaded his baby sister) and organized them into the infant Party of the Average Man. The real significance of the dream, however, has very little to do with the events it describes. The real mean ing, like that of the novel, lies beneath the surface of events portrayed. The author tells us that: among the producers or stagehands responsible for the setting of the dream there has been one ... it is hard to express it. .. a nameless, mysterious genius who took advantage of the dream to convey his own peculiar code message which has nothing to do with schooldays or indeed with any aspect of Krug's physical existence, but which links him up somehow with an unfath omable mode of being, perhaps terrible, perhaps blissful, per haps neither, a kind of transcendental madness which lurks behind the corner of consciousness and which cannot be de fined more accurately than this, no matter how Krug strains his brain, (p. 61) The message is this: Krug's world is in fact created and ordered by a purposeful artificer, the author, "the name less, mysterious genius," "the someone in the know" who has the power to foretell the future and who indicates his existence through the related images of the fancy footprint and the three circles (or balls). When the fancy footprint is first described, it is like "a spatulate hole through which you can see the nether sky," and at that moment the pud dle's surface does reflect "a portion of pale blue sky." (p. 7) In Krug's world, that same puddle is at once a mir ror and a door, a through-the-looking glass door connect ing Krug's world and the author's. Krug does not find that door until he goes mad, but the reader can sense its existence earlier, for in Krug's dream, all phases of his life superimpose, and in consequence, common elements of events widely separated in time and space are brought into uncommonly sharp focus. In Krug's dream, the reader sees the image of the ball bounce merrily through tunnels of Krug's life, and after it run the fancy footprints. Krug 1 2 7</page><page sequence="14">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW never follows these images back to their source, but they can be followed until they emerge from the tunnels of Krug's world into the author's. Every important leaf of Krug's life bears the water mark of the footprint and ball. The image of the puddle is associated with our earliest picture of Krug, for his childhood desk bears a special inkstain "in the shape of Lake Malheur." (p. 60) Lake Malheur is a kidney-shaped lake. (Krug visits that lake after Olga's death, and there his friends, the Maximovs, are arrested by the state.) The image of the puddle (at once the image of the inkstain and the lake) is closely related to the image of the glass of milk and sleeping pills. In Krug's world, these three balls first appear in the guise of the three soccer balls. The narrator stops his description of Krug's boyhood soccer game to describe . . . the ball, the ball, the smooth india rubber ball, approved by the authorities, suddenly disclosed in a glass case like some museum exhibit; three balls, in fact, in three cases, for we are shown all its instars: first, the new one, so clean as to be almost white—the white of a shark's belly; [this is the image of the glass of milk] then the dirty grey adult with grains of gravel adhering to its weatherbeaten cheek [this is the image of the ball of stone Krug finds on the parapet] as well as the pebbled cheek of the moon he sees that same night; then a flabby and formless corpse, (p. 62) The soccer ball would become a formless corpse if it hit "a certain vicious projection" on the school roof. Then, "the stricken ball's collapse would not be noticeable at once" (p. 62), but "at the next hard kick, its life air would start to ooze, and presently it would be flopping about like an old galosh, before coming to rest, a miser able jellyfish of soiled indiarubber." (p. 62) The image of the ball, then, is related to the image of the puddle; when the ball collapses, it takes on the form of an "old galosh." The fancy footprint is a collapsed soccer ball. Both these 1 2 8</page><page sequence="15">BEND SINISTER images are associated with Paduk, partly because both he and Krug were fashioned by the same creator, and par tially because the two men's destiny is so closely linked. Paduk's father had invented the "padograph," a me chanical device resembling a typewriter: this instrument reproduced its owner's handwriting. Paduk received one of the first samples for his birthday, and since "he had never got rid of infantile inkstains ... his father had thrown in additional keys for an hourglass-shaped blot and two round ones." (p. 66) Paduk's handwriting, an arachnoid scrawl expressive of his personality (the em blem of his government is also arachnoid—a crushed spider) thus bears the same symbols as does Krug's life: three soccer balls, one of which is punctured to form the hourglass, or the fancy footprint which trots through the lives of the two men. Olga, and Olga's death, are also associated with the pud dle; Krug consciously notices it for the first time as he watches it from her hospital window. She is dying of kid ney disease, and the kidney shape of the puddle helps fix the shape firmly in Krug's mind. As he helplessly watches his wife die, he simultaneously watches the changing images reflected on its mirrory surface. Olga's physical disintegration is thus mirrored by the disintegration of the dying day. During Krug's dream, he repeatedly sees Olga sitting before a mirror, but this time the mirror reflects the disintegration that he most hates and fears: the mirror now reflects Olga's disintegration, not that of the dying day. Krug first sees her removing her diamond tiara before a brilliant mirror; still before the mirror, he sees her preparing to remove her diamond necklace, and he thinks to himself, "yes, divesting herself of all her earthly jewels." (p. 63) In the Headmaster's Office (where Krug is made to discuss his reluctance to participate in student political parties), Krug sees Olga again; this time she is in a print on the wall. The print depicts "a lady in 129</page><page sequence="16">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW cherry red, sitting before her mirror." (p. 69) And when Krug finds himself back in his old classroom, Olga appears as the subject of the class' next theme, (pp. 77-8) Although Krug notices the fancy footprints and soccer ball inkblots on many separate occasions, he never manages to synthesize these discrete instances into a single mean ingful pattern; consequently, he cannot fathom its signif icance. He spends the night of Olga's death watching the kidney-shaped puddle; then, as he crosses the bridge, he pauses with his hand on the parapet and feels there "a certain pattern of roughness: a furrow in the stone of the parapet and a knob and a hole with some moisture inside." (p. 16) Krug thinks, "On this particular night, just after they had tried to turn over to me her purse, her comb, her cigarette holder, I found and touched this—a selected combination, details of the bas-relief. I had never touched this particular knob before and shall never find it again." (pp. 16-17) Yet he does find this combination again; minutes later, he finds it on his own son's cheek: "A combination of three tiny brown spots, birthmarks on the faintly flushed cheek near the nose recalled some combi nation he had seen, touched, taken in recently—what was it? The parapet." (p. 29) It is appropriate that David should bear the sign of three dots, for his destiny is shaped by Krug's and Paduk's, and Krug's blindness to the subtle warnings of danger threading his life ends by causing David's death. Krug's dream reminds him of the inkblots which used to deface Paduk's homework, but he does not connect them with those defacing Dr. Alexander's signature on the University document, (p. 53) with Pa duk's "blot" of spilled milk, (p. 139) or with the inkblot eclipsing Peter Quist's signature on the letter offering to help Krug escape Padukgrad. (p. 164) Quist's signature and that of the Toad are the same, but Krug fails to take the hint. It is not surprising that Krug should fail to sense the 1 30</page><page sequence="17">BEND SINISTER logic behind the more subtle, repeating patterns of his life. He is so remarkably obtuse that when Kol asks him whether he is sure that Arvid Krug really is not his son, his questions are not as preposterous as they seem. Some thing seems radically wrong with Krug's capacity to syn thesize splinters of experience, and this incapacity appears to have its roots in his inability to face the reality of death. He fails, for example, to fathom the logic behind the pattern of arrests in his world; he fails to see that, after his friends are all arrested, he and his child will be next. The whole Peter Quist episode is another example of his astonishing blindness to the natural consequences of events. He desperately wants to escape from Padukgrad with David, and when Quist hints it can be arranged, Krug blindly trusts him. Nor is this trust shaken when Quist "supposes" that Krug's code name is "madamka"— "Madamka" is an anagram of "mad adam krug," and both these names were the Toad's nicknames for him. When Quist seems reluctant to aid David's escape, Krug promises to carry the child if necessary, but Quist dubiously mur murs, "One day you were not able to carry him a couple of miles to the railway station." (p. 165) That day was the day of Maximovs' arrest; only if Quist had a hand in the arrest could he know this. Yet when Quist obligingly shows his tired customer (shuddering to think of his long journey home) "a short and pleasant cut" through a tunnel which just happens to surface in Krug's own back yard, Krug still suspects nothing, even though he checks the tunnel's entrance the next day and finds it occupied by "the mournful detective assigned to his house and an organ-grinder of sorts playing chemin de fer." (p. 171) When Ember was arrested, two organ grinders, silent but gazing upwards, stood in the street below, (p. 115) but still Krug does not suspect Quist and his promise of escape by rail (chemin de fer). Just as Krug fails to grasp the signif icance of these larger patterns, the narrator hints that he 1 3 1</page><page sequence="18">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW would have necessarily missed the significance of the smaller ones even if he had noticed them, for in the interview be tween Paduk and Krug, the narrator has Krug say this: "And then," said Krug, "the two proceeded to speak of old times, to remember the names of teachers. ... I know all that, and really we have more important things to discuss than snowballs and inkblots." (p. 135) By the novel's end, however, Krug's attitude toward the inkblot-footprint has undergone a complete metamor phosis. He has a dream and a vision, and both illuminate the significance of these symbols. In his dream, he begins to sense that love somehow survives death. As he falls asleep, he begins to feel ... a slow sinking, a concentration of darkness and tenderness, a gradual growth of sweet warmth. His head and Olga's head, cheek to cheek, two heads held together by a pair of small ex perimenting hands which stretched up from a dim bed, were (or was—for the two heads formed one) going down, down, down towards a third point, towards a silently laughing face. There was a soft chuckle just as his and her lips reached the child's cool brow and hot cheek, but the descent did not stop there and Krug continued to sink into the heart-rending soft ness, into the black dazzling depths of a belated but—never mind—eternal caress, (pp. 213-14) Krug's vision of eternal love appears to him as an image of three faces, three spheres. This vision is thus linked not only with the three dots on David's cheeks, the soccer ball, and the inkblots, but also with the creator of Krug's universe, "this nameless mysterious genius" creating his destiny. He does not realize this consciously, but somewhere behind "a flap of dark consciousness," he begins to sense that this dream proves he has really lost nothing. When he wakes, he sees a luminous "fancy footprint"—and this vision causes him to sense both the existence of a mysterious pat tern woven into his life's fabric, and something of its signifi cance: In the middle of the night something in a dream shook him 132</page><page sequence="19">BEND SINISTER out of his sleep into what was really a prison cell with bars of light (and a separate pale gleam like the footprint of some phosphorescent islander) breaking the darkness. At first, as sometimes happens, his surroundings did not match any form of reality. Although of humble origin (a vigilant arc light out side, a livid corner of the prison yard, an oblique ray coming through some chink or bullet hole in the bolted and pad locked shutters) the luminous pattern he saw assumed a strange, perhaps fatal significance, the key to which was half-hidden by a flap of dark consciousness on the glimmering floor of a half-remembered nightmare. It would seem that some promise had been broken, some opportunity missed—or so grossly exploited as to leave an afterglow of sin and shame. The pattern of light was somehow the result of a stealthy, abstractly vindic tive groping, tampering movement that had been going on in a dream, or behind a dream, in a tangle of immemorial and by now formless and aimless machinations. Imagine a sign that warns you of an explosion in such cryptic and childish lan guage that you wonder whether everything—the sign, the frozen explosion under the window sill and your quivering soul—has not been reproduced artificially, there and then, by special arrangement with the mind behind the mirror, (p. 214) The footprint is "aimless" because it can no longer warn Krug of the impending explosion in his life; it is "ab stractly vindictive" since it mocks Krug's failure to read it aright. He is in prison precisely because its meaning was "half-hidden" in some "half-remembered nightmare"— the dream described in Chapter Five. Yet, when Krug wakes from his dream of Olga and David, the footprint, "the luminous pattern," once again becomes purposeful and fully benevolent; he finally senses that it is a "sign that warns you of an explosion." At first, he fears that the whole thing really means nothing; he fears that perhaps the sign, the explosion, and his quiv ering soul had been "reproduced artificially, there and then, by special arrangement with the mind behind the mirror," when suddenly it dawns on him with the force of an explosion that that is the real point, the real mean ing of what he sees. Everything has been reproduced by special arrangement with the mind behind the mirror: 133</page><page sequence="20">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Krug, the explosion, the symbols warning him of the ex plosion, Olga and David, Ember and Hedron and the Maximovs, everyone destroyed by the explosion—all have been artificially created by the man behind the mirror, the man on the other side of the looking-glass. When Krug meets his friends for the last time at the confrontation ceremony, he inarticulately tries to tell them what he has at last learned from his vision of the footprint of the phos phorescent islander: "You silly people," he said, wiping his nose with his hand, "what on earth are you afraid of? What does it all matter? Ridiculous! Same as those infantile pleasures—Olga and the boy taking part in some silly theatricals, she getting drowned, he losing his life or something in a railway accident. What on earth does it matter?" (p. 218) Krug has somehow divined that he and Olga and David are merely characters in a work created by the man be hind the mirror; he also divines that all events are just "a question of style." Olga died of kidney disease, but in Bend Sinister, she could have easily drowned. (In a dream Krug has several days after Olga's death, he sees her floating, Ophelia-like, down the river on a barge). David, murdered by the state, might easily have died in a rail way accident. (Krug had intended to escape, by train, with David, and later, he found David building a train out of chairs; that train was wrecked when the govern ment agents arrested them both.) Krug realizes that their fates only seemed inevitable; they were chosen from among many possibilities. Although the choices were not happy ones for the characters, still, Krug's end is—as the author tells us—a happy one. He could not bear to believe there was no purpose to his suffering; his intelligence could not "accept the inanity of accumulating incalculable treasures of thought and sensation, and thought-behind-thought and sensation-behind-sensation, to lose them all at once and forever in a fit of black nausea followed by infinite noth 134</page><page sequence="21">BEND SINISTER ingness." (p. 94) In the final scenes, Krug realizes that his suffering has a purpose; everything happening to him has an ordered place in the artist's design, Bend Sinister: every thing important in his life bears the sign and seal of a guiding intelligence who orders his life, giving it significance. Life is not "a tale told by an idiot." Ill For the reader who believes in Krug and his misery, the author's reassurance that Krug's end was happy is not en tirely convincing. Does Nabokov actually mean that his last moments were happy because Krug was a character in a "Russian" novel, rather than a real man in Stalin grad, Leningrad, or Padukgrad? Unless Nabokov has some how indicated that what is true of the novel is also true of real life, his final judgment of Krug's fate can mean nothing more. A close look at the novel, however, does reveal that the world of Bend Sinister is meant to be a paradigm of the real world. In the novel, Nabokov argues that we are all characters in the vast work of an ultimate artificer whose palette is the universe and whose pigments are all things under the sun. This concept of existence un derlies and explains every aspect of the novel. Nabokov chose a philosopher for his central character because such a man would be most likely to formulate the philosophic basis for such a belief. Krug is not concerned with politics, but he is concerned with death, and this concern antedates the establishment of Paduk's government by many years. Fifteen years be fore, Krug's parents had been killed in a railway accident, and in order "to alleviate the pain and the panic" Krug had "looked straight into the eye-sockets of death and called him a dog and an abomination." (p. 128) He does not, however, discover whether anything lies beyond death; he can only rebel against its apparent senselessness; this is why the author appears to have serious reservations con cerning Krug's abilities, though we are told he is the fin 135</page><page sequence="22">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW est thinker the country has yet produced. Krug never even looks for the ultimate answers to fundamental questions: "He had never indulged in the search for the True Sub stance, the One, the Absolute . . (p. 158) But in his dream, he sees "The Christmas tree of the Cosmos," "the one, the absolute." He sees Olga "divesting herself of all her earthly jewels," and as he watches, he sees the phe nomenon of life, which is her body, stripped by death of its curls, its mask, its mirror. In his dream, Olga's death is the "demonstration for the next theme," but Krug does not know the answers to the questions her death poses. As he watches his wife innocently and pitifully disintegrate, he is swept by a "horrible qualm," the childish impotence and shame of the schoolboy who cannot answer the teach er's question; in his dream, Krug, the adult, great thinker admired by all the continents, again finds himself a child, helpless, ashamed, ignorant. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the adult Krug's phi losophy to enable him to answer the ultimate question of what death is. He finally realizes that he excels at crea tive destruction, and cannot help feeling that ... he was really bigger and brighter than most of the men around him; but he also knew that what people saw in him, without realizing it perhaps, was not an admirable expansion of positive matter but a kind of inaudible frozen explosion (as if the reel had been stopped at the point where the bomb bursts) with some debris gracefully posed in mid-air. (p. 160) This "inaudible frozen explosion" is meant to be con trasted with the image of the explosion Krug envisions the night before his death; he pictures that death as an "explosion" created by the man behind the mirror. This second explosion is described as an "admirable expansion of positive matter" detonated by the creative, synthesiz ing intelligence; it takes place in a newly created world. The explosions of Krug's philosophic efforts are crea tions of the analytic faculty. With great precision, style, grace, Krug simply destroys; unlike the artist, he has 136</page><page sequence="23">BEND SINISTER nothing to replace what is destroyed. The beauty of the explosion, the intellectual fireworks, tend to blind him, and his admirers, to the essential futility of his activity. These two explosions are, then, contrasted in order to make the following point: the creative faculty must be en listed in the search for answers to questions of life and death; analytic efforts alone are insufficient. Krug's life explodes with Olga's death, and that of the old order, but he does not have the weapons to kill empti ness and shame. Hence his absolute refusal to hear Olga's name mentioned, and his repeated references to the piti ful, shameful quality of her death. When he finally does attempt to face Olga's death for the first time, he turns, not to philosophy, for comfort, but to something quite different—his imagination, his creative faculty: Then I must do something about you, my love. We have imagined that a white hospital train with a white Diesel engine has taken you through many a tunnel to a mountainous country by the sea. You are getting well there. But you cannot write because your fingers are so very weak. Moonbeams cannot hold even a white pencil. The picture is pretty, but how long can it stay on the screen? We expect the next slide, but the magic lantern man has none left. Shall we let the theme of a long separation expand till it breaks into tears? Shall we say (daintily handling the disinfected white symbols) that the train is Death and the nursing home Paradise? Or shall we leave the picture to fade by itself, to mingle with other fading im pressions? (p. 93) Minutes after imagining the celestial train, Krug and David see a "freight train puffing beyond the fields to the lake." (p. 94) This may be a poignant coincidence, but it may also be a sign that Krug has stumbled across the right path when he turns to his imagination for help. The train is puffing its way toward Lake Malheur: Lake Mal heur is the kidney-shaped lake—a link between Krug's world and a higher mode of being. Olga's death, then, forces Krug to abandon creative destruction and begin his attempts at creative construc 137</page><page sequence="24">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW tion; he begins a groping approach to the world on the other side of the gates of death. He momentarily turns to his imagination, but then turns back to philosophy; his philosophical attempts to find answers are abortive, (p. 159) Ironically, his present efforts are unnecessary; he already has an outline of the "as yet unwritten theme" whose subject is Olga's death, and that outline is no further away than his desk drawer. In this drawer is a "miscellaneous" collection of notes concerning the prob lems of Victorian telepathy and "illusions hynagogiques," fraudulent revelations in papyrus, the last Tasmanian, and the nearest star. Although these notes seem an un related lot, still the outline of Krug's unwritten essay con cerning the meaning of life and death can be deduced from them. In one way or another, all the notes help answer these questions: "Is there a God, and if there is, how can we detect his presence?" The notes draw upon extremely diverse sources: dreams, illusions hypnagogiques, art, telep athy, science, philosophy, anthropology—for whatever light they can cast on these questions. One group of notes evidently answers the implicit ques tion, "Can we deduce something of the nature of God by consulting man's conception of him?" Dr. Livingstone found that, to a savage, God is the local chief Sakomi (Skotoma?). The savage knows no greater power than the chief; to him the chief is understandably the All Powerful. The savage's conception of God tells us nothing of God's true nature; instead, his conception illuminates the nature of his own mind. The note concerning Orpheus seems to imply that, even if God did exist, we might learn nothing of him by consulting man's conceptions of him. The Romans, for example, inherited the Orphic legends from the Greeks, yet if we were to form our notion of Or pheus from Roman pictures of him, his true nature would be completely obscured. Romans venerated strength, not artistic ability; hence they tended to represent their he roes as gladiators. One note describes a Roman painting 138</page><page sequence="25">BEND SINISTER of Orpheus; he is a gladiator in an arena. This Orpheus, Krug's note tells us, was killed by a bear. Yet the real Orpheus loved animals and was himself worshipped and protected by them; he charmed them with his music. The Roman image is thus an unconscious forgery of the Greek. What the Roman painter did unconsciously, the Catholic priests and spurious prophet, Psalamanazer, did consci ously—they deliberately "forged" religious beliefs and practices for their own ends. All too often, then, man's concept of God brings us no closer to God, only closer to the mind of man. As Giovanni Battista Vico put it in The New Science, the savage's concept of God shows that, "because of the indefinite nature of the human mind, whenever it is lost in ignorance, man makes himself the measure of all things." The Roman painter's conception of Orpheus inadvertently illustrates yet another axiom of Vico's: "When men are ignorant of the natural causes producing things, they attribute their own nature to them." Vico's work throws a great deal of light both on Krug's unwritten essay and on Bend Sinister as a whole. As a phi losopher interested in epistemology, Krug would have known Vico's work, just as Nabokov, an enthusiastic ad mirer of Joyce, would have been acquainted with it. Vico's name is, in fact, mentioned in Bend Sinister when Ember and Krug discuss the many possible interpretations of Hamlet. That discussion begins when Ember explains to Krug why the state is so anxious to produce a complex Shakesperian tragedy. Krug is surprised that men per fectly incapable of reading anything intelligently should want to produce that particular work. Ember points out that to the State, Hamlet is crystal clear: the State has done what generations of scholars and critics could not; it has discovered "the real plot of Hamlet." Hamlet, says the State's critic, is the tragedy of the masses, and young Fortinbras, their representative, is the play's real hero. Ember and Krug then begin to work out their own ver sion of the play, and their version reflects their personali 139</page><page sequence="26">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW ties. In the midst of one of his comments, Krug says, "(cf. Winnipeg Lake, ripple 585, Vico Press edition)" simul taneously acknowledging his debt to Joyce's "library chapter" in Ulysses and his own use of Vico's philosophy. Nabokov's "Hamlet chapter," like Krug's unwritten es say, demonstrates the truth of the two Vico axioms previ ously mentioned. Like Dr. Livingstone's savage, the State makes itself the measure of all things; what it cannot un derstand, it makes over in its own image; thus Hamlet becomes a tragedy of the masses. To a sensualist, Hamlet is a series of sensual images; to a German scholar, "word droppings on [the man's] decrepit hat." (p. 109) Although Krug (and Nabokov) accept Vico's axioms, they do not seem to accept the conclusions he draws from them. Vico himself broke with the Newtonians and the Carte sians because of his belief that nature could not be prop erly known by man. He maintained that God alone could know nature, for nature was God's creation. Man, he held, could only understand what he created; civilization, all the works of language, literature, history, and art. Vico held that man could learn much about himself, not God, by studying his own works. Krug's notes reflect Vico's dis trust of science as a metaphysical tool. One of these notes tells us that "The nearest star is Alpha Centauri," and another quotes recent measurements of the "finite though boundless universe." Krug, however, comments pessi mistically that "we can easily imagine people in 3000 AD sneering at our naive nonsense and replacing it with some naive nonsense of their own." "The ant," says Krug, "lives in a universe of shaped odors, of chemical configura tions," and no doubt the ant thinks what it sees, every thing sees. Man, like the ant, is thus emprisoned by the bars of his senses; when he attempts to describe "infinite sight," he must, as Krug realizes, do so "without himself being able to see." He wonders whether man must al ways resign himself to spouting naive nonsense on pro foundly serious subjects. 140</page><page sequence="27">BEND SINISTER The Krug who collected these notes did not seem to believe this was man's inevitable fate, for one group of notes hints at the possibility of breaking the prison bars of our senses. They suggest that the same ground, which proves so sterile when tilled one way, may prove very fertile indeed tilled in another. A new way of looking at old things may yield unexpected insights. In Speak, Mem ory, Nabokov compares an incident in his life to a "puz zle-picture" popular in illustrated magazines for children; he and his wife and child were walking towards the boat which was to take them to America: There in front of us ... it was most satisfying to make out among the jumbled angles of roofs and walls, a splendid ship's funnel, showing from behind the clothesline as something in a scrambled picture—Find What the Sailor Has Hidden—that the finder cannot unsee once it is seen. (p. 240) Several of Krug's notes hint that life is like Nabokov's picture-puzzle; perhaps somewhere in imaginative and artistic work is a hidden clue, a sign of God's presence. Krug admits to envying Dr. Ivar Aasen, the man who in vented a language. He seems to envy Aasen's creative ca pacity; perhaps by investigating the actual process of creation, artistic creation, rather than its end result, we might learn how to look for the "hidden clue" in the picture puzzle of reality. This idea is picked up and de veloped in the note describing Raphael's representation of "the miraculous draught." In this tapestry, Krug notes, "we find among nondescript piscine forms of the young painter's fancy two specimens which obviously belong to the skate family, never found in fresh water." (p. 144) The two kinds of fish represented in the tapestry come from two very different seas: the sea of the painter's imag ination and the salty sea surrounding Italy. Perhaps the creator of an artistic work (or world) will always leave clues which refer us back to the creator's world. Human works refer us back to human artists; god-like works (works of nature) refer us back to the unknown world of the 141</page><page sequence="28">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW ultimate artificer. If this is true, then the next step is to turn to nature and search for hidden clues which may betray the designing hand of God. "The glory of God," quotes Krug, "is to hide a thing, the glory of man is to find it." The crucial question is where to look. Many of his notes attempt to define profit able areas to explore. One group of notes considers vari ous cases of telepathy, illusions hynagogiques, and pro phetic dreams. Krug finds one dim dream particularly promising. A Mrs. Storie dreamed her brother's death on the railroad tracks, (p. 142) Perhaps Mrs. Storie could dream of his death before it happened if God temporarily dissolved the barriers between time and space, and at the same time dissolved the barriers between dream life and real life. Another note deals with "Mrs. Bidder's demon." When she woke from a demon-filled nightmare, she was astonished to find a demon from the dream world lingering in the real one, but when she leaned forward to examine more closely the demon whose hand clutched her bedrail, it vanished into the ornaments over her mantlepiece. Krug is not really convinced by Mrs. Bidder and her demon; he dismisses such demons as "illusions hynagogiques." Still another group of notes deals with written things, which, like Mrs. Bidder's demon, seem to promise insight into "all the secrets, all the mysteries." One of these was the Egyptian papyrus which promised to reveal all, but turned out to be nothing more than the clumsy calcula tions of a long-dead farmer. This document is contrasted with a more innocent-looking one, one which makes no promises whatever, but may in fact hint at the myster ies and secrets of the universe. This is the newspaper clip ping which mentions that "the State Entomologist had retired to become Adviser on Shade Trees, and one won dered whether this was not some dainty oriental euphe mism for death." (p. 143) Krug wonders at the suggestive ness of the wording; perhaps the news item conceals a hidden dimension of meaning, some kind of clue, a sign 142</page><page sequence="29">BEND SINISTER of a mysterious mode of being. This idea is elaborated further by the note which mentions a "famous American poem": A curious sight—these bashful bears, These timid warrior whalemen And now the time of tide has come; The ship casts off her cables It is not shown on any map; True places never are This lovely light, it lights not me; All loveliness is anguish—(pp. 143-144) These lines are taken from different pages of Herman Melville's Moby Dick, and are arranged as a poem; the implication seems to be that in Moby Dick, as in Krug's dream, someone (perhaps the author, perhaps someone else) may have taken over the tissue of the work and used its fabric to convey "his own peculiar code message." (p. 61) The unwritten essay, then, seems to blaze several well marked trails the philosopher can follow when attempt ing to track down the beast, Death. The unwritten essay seems to assume that the artist is a minor god; the process by which he creates is similar to, if not the same as, the process by which God himself creates. Since all artists leave clues revealing their identity and presence, and since God is an artist, God must also leave hidden clues to his nature. His hand is most likely to be detected in the out of-the-ordinary and the otherwise inexplicable (prophetic dreams, telepathy) and in the minutia of life, the scrib bling in life's border (newspaper clippings, an occasional misplaced fish). During his waking hours, Krug cannot even remember the "leading idea" that held these notes together; yet, during his dreams, he does catch sight of it. When he saw Olga presented as the demonstration for the theme on death, he felt only panic and shame, emo tions intensified by his knowledge that the "answer" was 143</page><page sequence="30">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW somehow contained in a rosewood box painted to look like a little book; Krug "regretted that he had not opened the box or book while it passed through his hands." (p. 77) Yet he did in fact see into the book, for at the University's document-signing, "Orlik, the old zoologist, opened a little book lying next to him and discovered that it was an empty box with a lone pink peppermint on the bottom." (p. 49) At the instant when Krug reminded them of his childhood habit of sitting on the Toad's face, there was a crash of wood against wood as Orlik put the "Buxom biblioformis down with too much force." The lone pink peppermint inside the "Buxom biblioformis" was the same shape as the blot, the author's sleeping tablets, the soccer balls. Inside the box, then, was a code message from the creator of his world, a sign of the creator's existence tucked away unobtrusively in a corner of the picture. But when Krug wakes up, glimmerings of understanding fade; he tosses his notes back, saying that they are "dead and unusable." But the very next instant, Krug sees David's picture of a two-eyed dolicocephalic profile" (this image is connected with the pictures of primitive beings painted on the Altamira caves mentioned in one of Krug's "useless" notes), and this picture, associated with what Krug has just read, sparks his long-sleeping inspiration: "I might," thinks Krug, "start writing the unknown thing I want to write; unknown, except for a vague shoe-shaped outline, the infusorial quiver of which I feel in my restless bones." (p. 146) The shoe-shaped outline is, of course, the hidden clue, the secret code in Krug's world which testifies to the existence of its creator. It seems, then, that the very notes Krug so peremptorily dismisses have in fact made him dimly aware of the critical significance of that coded message. He, however, has no idea of how to begin his search for it. Krug's child David provides a hint as to how this search should be conducted. Soon after grasping the existence 144</page><page sequence="31">BEND SINISTER of the shoe-shaped outline, Krug goes in to see David for what will be the last time before the State murders him. He finds David evenly shading a piece of paper with a lead pencil. This paper is atop the fibroid cover of a book, and as David continues his aimless shading, "with magical precision and quite independent of the (acci dentally oblique) direction of the pencil strokes, the impressed word ATLAS came out in tall narrow white letters. One wondered if by shading one's life in like "fashion"— (p. 175) David's shading technique is the one the reader must use to find the meaning hidden in Bend Sinister. If Krug were to shade his life—if the reader shades it for him—a pattern emerges from beneath the chaos and apparent formlessness and aimlessness; certain insignif icant shapes, a shoe shape and the shapes of the three balls, take their fateful significance in his world; they become the raised letters (the name of a god), the coded symbols which the God of Bend Sinister uses in writing his invisible messages—messages which cannot be unseen once they are seen—to his creature, Adam. IV Bend Sinister, then, is a paradigm of the philosophy ex pressed in Krug's unwritten essay. The whole book is constructed around the assumptions implicit in it. Once this is understood, many otherwise inexplicable passages suddenly become absolutely relevant to the main design. One of the "slippery sophisms" constructed by the essay is this: Two things which have the same powers must be alike. The "God" of Bend Sinister and the God of the Universe share power over life and death. The God of Bend Sinister and the God of the Universe must be alike. In Bend Sinister, Nabokov repeatedly attempts to answer this question: Can artistic creation be compared to divine 145</page><page sequence="32">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW creation?" In Chapter Six, Krug remembers that he and Ember . . . happened to discuss the possibility of having invented in toto the works of William Shakespeare, spending millions and millions on the hoax, smothering with hush money the countless publishers, librarians, the Stratford-on-Avon people. (P- 79) Krug wonders whether he and Ember could have manip ulated the world as God manipulated it; could they have worked with reality to produce the same effects God produced? They seem to think so. But Krug soon realizes that he will not be able to determine whether artistic and divine creation are comparable by determining whether or not he and Ember could have invented Shakespeare. Krug would be "copying" or "translating," not creating. When he listens to Ember's translations of Shakespeare, he marvels at the strangeness of the day. Three hundred years after Shakespeare wrote his play . . . another man, in another country, was trying to render those rhythms and metaphors in a different tongue. This pro cess entailed a prodigious amount of labor, for the necessity of which no real reason could be given. It was as if someone, having seen a certain oak tree (further called individual T) growing in a certain land and casting its own unique shadow on the green and brown ground, had proceeded to erect in his garden a prodigiously intricate piece of machinery which in itself was as unlike that or any other tree; as the translator's inspiration and language were unlike that of the original author, but which, by means of ingenious combinations of parts, light effects, breeze-engendering engines, would, when completed, cast a shadow exactly similar to that of individual T—the same outline, changing in the same manner, with the same double and single spots of sun rippling in the same posi tion, at the same hour of the day. From a practical point of view, such a waste of time and material (those headaches, those midnight triumphs that turn out to be disasters in the sober light of the morningl) was almost criminally absurd, since the greatest masterpiece of imitation presupposed a voluntary limitation of thought, in submission to another man's genius. Could this suicidal limitation and submission be compensated 1 4 б</page><page sequence="33">BEND SINISTER by the miracle of adaptive tactics, by the thousand devices of shadography, by the keen pleasure that the weaver of words and their witness experienced at every new wile in the warp, or was it, taken all in all, but an exaggerated and spiritualized replica of Paduk's writing machine? (pp. 113-14) This passage seems to concern itself with the value of translation (a value which Nabokov, an expert translator, certainly recognizes), but the real point of the passage is this: if an author wants to consider himself a rival of God, he must be more than a slavish imitator; he must be able to create something out of nothing. The artist can do this; the translator cannot. At the beginning of Chapter Six, Nabokov invites us to watch the author in competition with God; perhaps both create our sense of the past in the same way, for The retrospective effect itself is a fairly simple illusion, not unlike the pictorial values of depth and remoteness produced by a paintbrush on a flat surface; but it takes something better than a paintbrush to create a sense of compact reality backed by a plausible past, of logical continuity, of picking up the thread of life at the exact point where it was dropped. The subtlety of the trick is nothing short of marvellous, considering the immense number of details to be taken into account, ar ranged in such a way as to suggest the action of memory, (pp. 79-80) God can create this miracle. So can the author, and Nabokov shows how: Krug at once knew that his wife had died; that he had beaten a hasty retreat to the country with his little son, and that the view framed in the casement (wet leafless trees, brown earth, white sky, a hill with a farmhouse in the distance) was not only a sample picture of that particular region but was also there to tell him that David had pulled the shade up and had left the room without awakening him; whereupon, with almost obsequious apropos, a couch at the other end of the room dis played by means of mute gestures—see this and this—all that was necessary to convince one that a child had slept there. On the morning after her death her relatives had arrived. The night before Ember had informed them of her death. Note how smoothly the retrospective machinery works: every 147</page><page sequence="34">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW thing fits into everything else. They (to switch to a lower past gear) arrived, they invaded Krug's flat. ... They came in full force: her sister Viola, Viola's revolting husband, a half brother of sorts and his wife, two remote female cousins scarcely visible in the mist and a vague old man whom Krug had never met before. Augment the vanity of illusive depth. Viola had always disliked her sister; they had seldom seen each other during the last twelve years, (pp. 79-80) Nabokov continues describing the funeral, Krug's flight from it to the country, and his arrival at the Maximov's: "This completes the reconstruction," and with this final remark, the author-god proudly bows himself out of the picture. Thus, Nabokov demonstrates that a god and the author possess similar powers; they must, therefore, be alike. Their creations also are alike. An artistic work, Nabokov implies, grows as anything in the natural world grows. Shakespeare, for example, "had only to breathe on any particle of his stupendous vocabulary to have that particle live and expand and throw out tremulous tentacles until it became a complex image with a pulsing brain and cor related limbs." (p. 113) Since a work of art and a natural work share the same properties, they, too, must be alike. The world of Bend Sinister, then, can be equated with the real world. This is the "slippery sophism, the play on words" Nabokov uses to confer immortality on Krug in the book's last scene: Everything that exists in Bend Sinister exists in the real world. Divinely-wrought patterns exist in Bend Sinister. Divinely-wrought patterns exist in the real world, (p. 222) Nabokov calls this a slippery sophism because he has no illusions about the validity of his major premise; in setting up Bend Sinister, he has merely set up a scheme in which he already believes, and his novel therefore has not really proven anything. Krug's prophetic dream helps create a divinely-wrought pattern in the book. Like Mrs. Storie's dream of her brother's death, it warns Krug of what is to happen, and it does so by breaking down the 148</page><page sequence="35">BEND SINISTER barriers of time and space, the barriers separating the "inner" imaginative life from the "outer" life of reality. Krug himself wondered about the nature of that last barrier: "Or is 'outer' and 'inner' an illusion too, so that a great mountain may be said to stand a thousand dreams high and hope and terror can be as easily charted as the capes and bays they helped to name?" (p. 160) In other words, whatever happens in one's imaginative life is as concrete and real as what happens in "real" life. The narrator of the novel, so careful to show these principles ruling his world, finally pronounces them false. But it is characteristic of Nabokov to have second thoughts about his second thoughts; perhaps—in spite of all his doubts—he has hit on the answer after all— perhaps God is an artist. Perhaps God does make his presence known by weaving beautifully complex patterns. The last scene of the novel plays a joke on the superior, patronizing author, the creator of slippery sophisms; in the last scene, he sees a moth trying to get into his room from "the night side." He describes it in detail, yawns and remarks, "Well, that was all. The various parts of my comparative paradise—the bedside lamp, the sleeping tablets, the glass of milk—looked with perfect submission into my eyes. I knew the immortality I had conferred upon the poor fellow was a slippery sophism, a play upon words. But the very last lap of his life had been happy and it had been proven to him that death was but a question of style. . . . Twang. A good night for mothing." (p. 222) There is something odd happening in this concluding passage. The narrator is too sure of himself, too confident of his easy triumph over Krug the philos opher. Over and over again, the narrator has emblemized Olga as a moth, yet when he finds a moth trying to get into his room from the night-side, he thinks nothing of it. Yet in his introduction, Nabokov himself tells us that the moth is Olga's rosy soul, and in fact, the butterfly is an ancient Greek symbol for the soul. The narrator, then, 149</page><page sequence="36">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW makes the same mistake Krug makes—he fails to see a pattern developing in his own life. The mode of being beyond his own sends him Olga in the form of a butter fly. He too has breathed on his particles, causing them to live and expand. Inner and outer is an illusion; God is an artist, and the world is his work. In the final scene of the novel, the ultimate artificers signal secretly to their creature—the author of Bend Sinister. Bend Sinister foreshadows Pale Fire, for Pale Fire is also a paradigm of the world constructed in Bend Sinister. Pale Fire throws retrospective light on one intriguing aspect of Bend Sinister—the novel's intricate thematic structure. Although the shoe-shape seems to have been chosen at random, in Nabokov's work, the shoe-shape has a very special significance. When Krug crosses the bridge the night his wife dies, the soldiers there refuse to let him leave it because the soldiers at the other end have failed to sign his much fussed-over pass. Krug's pleas that those soldiers cannot read, much less write, do not pro duce the desired effect, and he is sent back. Infuriated, he marches off thinking, "What would happen if I threw it (the pass) into the Kur? Doomed to walk back and forth on a bridge which had ceased to be one since neither bank is really attainable. Not a bridge but an hourglass which somebody keeps reversing, with me, the fine fluent sand, inside." (p. 19) The hourglass shape is a variation of the shoe shape; for Nabokov, these shapes signify infinity, or infinite life, and it is thus appropriate that Krug's life conform to a "vague shoe-shaped outline," and that the author-god, the anthropomorphic deity, should choose this mark to make his presence known. In Pale Fire, John Shade, too, is preoccupied with these same symbols. Always searching for evidence of order and eternal life, Shade seems to find apparently ordinary things miraculous. One of these is "The miracle of a lemniscate left/ Upon wet sand by nonchalantly deft/ Bicycle tires," and the other is a figure eight, the mathe 150</page><page sequence="37">BEND SINISTER matical symbol of infinity. The ampersand is also a figure eight: both are basically hour-glass shapes. So too are footprints and kidney shapes; in them, one loop of the "eight" is larger than the other. When Krug senses that this is the meaning of the "phosphorescent footprint," he is finally comforted; before this, Krug's dilemma was the same as Quentin Compson's in The Sound and the Fury. What Quentin could not bear was realizing that "even the despair or remorse or bereavement is not particularly important to the dark diceman."2 Krug at last understands that a higher mode of being exists, "per haps blissful, perhaps terrible, perhaps neither." It is enough to know that it does exist. Krug's final speech, in which he tries to convince his friends that it does not matter, nothing matters, everyone is safe, everyone is in the hands of the ultimate artificer, foreshadows John Shade's far more elegant statement of the same thing in Pale Fire. In Lolita, the hourglass shape makes another appear ance, this time to name the shape of the Lake which Humbert visits with Mrs. Haze and Lolita. The ultimate artificers leave their mark upon Humbert's world, but although Humbert suspects that these artificers exist, he never believes in them as do Krug and Shade. It is part of his torment to believe (at the very moment that the gods attach the final, searing threads to the web of his destiny) that perhaps "in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a North American girl child named Dolores Haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac." If this is true, says Humbert, "Then life is a joke." This is Humbert's final torture—that he must go to his grave suspecting that life is a joke. But unlike Krug, his final moments are not lightened by a beam of divine light bringing blessed madness. 2 William Faulkner, The Sound and the Fury (New York: Modern Li brary, 1929), p.
