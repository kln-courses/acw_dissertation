<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALICE MAHER BELLTABLE ARTS CENTRE LIMERICK 3 ? 28 October Tryst, Alice Maher's title for her recent ex hibition, might equally have been called 'The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland'. Certainly, assignations, dangereuse or otherwise, are kept, such as that between the enigmatic bathers in Lovers leaping in</page><page sequence="2">37 a pond, or the bizarre confrontation bet ween a seated donkey and a purple-coped cleric in Meeting on the high road. In others however, Amadeus Juggling for example, where a large- headed female figure is seated, Buddha-like, juggling with small, pink babies, the word Tryst' is stret ched to become a statement of sexual identity and its meeting with reproductive destiny. The exhibition, described as an installa tion, consists of two elements. Firstly, an inner space, where a series of twenty small (30 x 21cm.) mixed media compositions are displayed, is entered through an ante chamber containing three painted fabric tents. These circular pavilions, of varying size and colour, are suspended by wires from the ceiling, and are thus able to rotate slightly, like fairground carousels. As such they prepare us for two recurrent images in this exhibition ? a fairy tale wonderland and the world of the circus and clowns. The small mixed media works are ex ecuted on rectangular paper fragments, mounted on white board, and framed und er glass. Their torn or serrated edges are clearly intended to contribute to the overall expressionistic style of the work, which is itself caricatural, featuring bright and sometimes garish colours, and a variety of surface texture. The harsher, more ag gressive tendencies apparent in the artist's earlier drawings (see CIRCA 39) have been toned down, and the emotional tenor of the work may now be described as pen sive and sometimes melancholic. There is much evidence of circus and carnival im agery, but the affinity, as shown in The Mirror, is with the sad mountebanks of Picasso's 'Blue' Period, rather than Ensor's leering grotesques. Here a blue painted clown stands contemplatively in a land scape holding a looking glass in one hand and a snake entwined stick in the other. The significance of the traditional vanitas symbol is obvious enough, but the implica tion of the snaky sceptre (or more precisely eel-wound arrow) requires a consultation with Ripa's Iconologia in order to confirm her identity as Prudence. It soon becomes apparent that the ar tist is interested in exploiting the nuances of art historical iconography, and many of her subjects are predicated by reference to earlier works of art. In The Somnambulist for example, a female figure in a long blue dress walks through a dream landscape in a Delvaux-like trance. To her right a naked female reclines provocatively like a Titian esque Venus, whilst the recumbent head of a further somnolent figure suggests a probable source in Magritte. This kind of art historical compote offers an intriguing puzzle for the viewer to decipher. Once the interpretation has been made however, it needs to be seen against the overall con cern of the artist with her female identity, and feminine 'Rite of Passage'. Maher also uses animal imagery with its symbolic and often implicit suggestion of anthropomorphism to caricature human foibles and types, in a way that resembles Grandville and Beckmann. For example in Meeting on the high road, a kind of Bunuelian anti-clericalism pervades the confrontation of Bishop and Donkey. But she goes way beyond this caricatural use to something that lies at the heart of her work. In Confused couple kissing, Maher attempts a fusion of human and animal forms where one figure, shown with a pur ple rabbit's head (beneath which pigtails can be seen) and wearing green and white striped 'hobby-horse' trousers, embraces a blond-haired maiden. This suggests a rela tionship betwen the participants, within the metaphor of the carnival or circus context, in the vein of 'On with the Motley', ? the deliberate pathetic adoption of roles (who after all is more pathetic than the clown?) The artist is also concerned to exploit the mythic implications of identity confronta tions; Alice with rabbit, frog and princess, Beauty and the Beast. This is familiar feminist territory ? in particular the feminist analysis of the fairytale showing its use in defining the limits of sexual iden tity ? and while there are certainly male/female confrontation in this work there are many others which suggest Alice's meetings with her numerous alter egos. The "baroque exuberance" (CIRCA 30) which characterised many of the artist's previous charcoal and chalk drawings, is notably absent from these works. This must in part be accounted for by the reduction in scale as much as by the change in medium. However, within the larger con text offered by the hanging pavilions, something of that previous dynamism returns. As in the case of the smaller com positions however, the menacing imagery of the theatre of cruelty so evident in the past, has been exchanged for the whimsy of the carnival and the ballet. The three tent/carousels are, in my opi nion, the most interesting and successful part of the exhibition. Each offers a distinc tive assortment of superimposed imagery which may be viewed externally or, more effectively, from within, the painted forms being visible through the opaque medium of the tenting. The continuous circular for mat creates a unifying effect upon the disparate imagery, totally absent from the separate wall-mounted works. This format is thus central to Maher's intentions in her search for identity and the linking of inner and outer worlds. The narrowest and darkest of these ex otic pavilions is painted blue overall, its ex terior decorated with arabesque forms in dark brown, fawn and yellow. The pattern also incorporates an iconography of hiero glyphic signs and mystical images, such as the Wheel of Fortune and stylised Egyp tian Gods. Thus the exploration of female destiny is posed in terms of reading the signs and the Cabbala, and the omens are gloomy. In the larger, pink tent the imagery is more varied, and offers a cross-cultural whirligig, where sprightly Irish dancers jig alongside more indeterminate cavorting bodies reminiscent of the damned descen ding into hell in the course of some Michelangelesque 'Last Judgement'. All are goaded into action by a Diana huntress figure with a cattle prod who appears elsewhere in the exhibition in Hunting Home. The significance of the etymologi cal definition of 'tryst' as a 'hunter's station', given by the artist in the catalogue, is so made clear. The artist is both huntress and animateur, searching for and invigorating the symbols which go to make up her iden tity and purpose. The white pavilion is the largest and most spectacular of these visual carousels. Here the iconogaphy is at its most arcane, and we encounter a figure with an arrow through both hands (a St. Sebastiana with her hands tied!) and another with a tree growing out of her head. Elsewhere, a car dinal rides past in the gondola of an air balloon, which is being propelled along by a devil, while two other figures spiral by, heads joined back to back in a Janus-like configuration. In amongst these exotic creatures, a number of domestic animals such as donkeys and cows wander about disconcertingly. One particular image here seems to characterise the exhibition as a whole; that of a woman reclining like a latter day Mme. Recamier on a chaise-longue. Closer in spection reveals that the chaise is sup ported on a child's sandal-clad feet and the woman has a child's face. She also appears to have a tree growing out of her head, and is wearing a long dress with a pattern of jet aeroplanes on it. Initially, the effect is one of schizophrenic confusion, but it is not difficult to see that the serene maturity of the original reference is undercut by the child image, and the jet planes suggest that this is not one women at one moment of time, but a symbol for the female condi tion. Other images show woman aspiring; a woman on stilts embraces a smaller man; a woman climbs a shamrock-beanstalk; woman taking on a multitude of identities as she ascends through the territory of home, love, battlefield, transience and change. And sadly, the ultimate definition of 'tryst', Icarus-like, she falls. The upper part of the work is crowded with images of a naked woman plunging to earth, but often in the proximity of a plethora of small fishes, tear-drops, sperm or seeds, and as Jack Pakenham suggested in his review of Maher's last exhibition, this may suggest the female's being tied to and unable to escape her reproductive function. This exhibition must be grist to any Art Historian's mill and I can only admire the ingenuity, the awareness of styles and meaning which run through this show, and the way that punning, word-play and literary models are used to elucidate such a serious theme. It is also impressive that Maher can use these in such a personal and felt comment on her own condition. However, I don't think the exhibition as a whole, comes off. The small pictures in the 'inner sanctum' appear fragmentary and unrelated, thus diminishing the coherence of the installation. Secondly, I felt the references were in the end, just too eclec tic. I'm not sure what was gained overall by the sheer number of historical references, apart from the artist's pleasure in citing them. It is possible with this exhibition, just not to see the wood for the trees, and as Alice realised in Through the Looking Glass, the wood where things have no name is a place where you are in danger of losing the identity you already have.
