<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes and Queries "MARIAN EVANS AND GEORGE ELIOT" LAWRENCE AND ELIZABETH HANSON'S Marian Evans and George Eliot (Oxford: $6.00) is a weighty book, painstakingly setting forth all the facts of the author's life that can be dug up by an unre- mitting mining operation in the so-far published letters, the long array of biographies and, to some extent, in the critical judgments that have been passed on the productions of G. E.'s pen. The facts seem to me indisputably accurate, but I fear no reader who is not already a G. E. enthusiast will read the account with any deep interest. One point where one's interest seems to quicken is the passage describing Mary Ann's childhood (chap. i), but I could not help saying as I read, "Page Maggie Tulliver." No doubt The Mill on the Floss, especially the early chapters, is the artistic re- production of George Eliot's own experience, but the reader (this one at least) would like to have some distinction made between a rehash of pages in the novel and a factual account. That may be too carping, but such things put one off and make further reading a bit on the suspicious side. What these biographers seem to have done is to transfer to the young Marian all the traits we find so touchingly portrayed in the child Maggie. The reader should be told that this transfer has been made. Besides the facts of George Eliot's life, we find in the book many portraits of Victorian people who were important in the making of her personality. Robert Evans was certainly a great influence on his daughter, the Brays came into her life at a crucial point, John Chapman at another. Herbert Spencer's relation to the half-fledged thinker and writer is well portrayed. Faithful research and a con- siderable background of knowledge of the world of liberal, strug- gling thinkers and writers in England from 1850 to 1880 make the Hansons' picture of this chaotic, interesting, and petty world seem authentic. They have chapter and verse for most of their statements. [299]</page><page sequence="2">300 Nineteenth-Century Fiction One rather confusing practice, one which I think they used in order to prove their "fairness," is to give conflicting reports on events, ideas, and traits of character. Readers as versed as the biog- raphers are in the personnel of the Victorian world would find little difficulty in assessing the value of these conflicting statements, but the ordinary reader will, I think, become merely bewildered. The most vital and overwhelming influence in George Eliot's de- velopment was-and I think few students of her life will disagree- George Henry Lewes. My own interest in Lewes is so great that I hesitate to criticize the picture of Lewes that these biographers give. I think they mean to be fair, but so many of their witnesses stress his less attractive aspects and so little emphasis is placed on his really noteworthy achievements that I get an impression of deroga- tion rather than approval. The truth is, as I see it, that Lewes was one of the most un-Victorian men of his time. With his family background and his unconventional, partly French education, not to mention his wit and his critical attitude, it is not surprising that many of "the best people" looked askance at the man. But we are not Victorians and we would like to hear from more who admired and enjoyed G. H. L. and not so much from those who thought him-and called him-"a mountebank." Mr. and Mrs. Hanson hurry over the last three years of George Eliot's life, and perhaps it is just as well. Many people who were shocked at the union of George and Marian were more shocked by her marriage eighteen months after his death to a man twenty years younger than herself. It was indeed surprising, yet under- standable in the light of the dependence which had showed in her earlier years and had been developed during her life with Lewes. The Hansons dwell over and over again on her sense of sin, or of something at least resembling it, because of her unmarried state. They attribute most of her worry over her work to the feeling that she must give something great in order to make up for breaking the laws of society. That may be corrct. She certainly worried and gloomed a great deal, but I, for one, cannot feel so sure about the</page><page sequence="3">Notes and Queries 301 motivation either of her worry or of her marriage to Cross. As Gordon Haight said, she wanted someone to lean on. As for the achievement of this book in criticism, I have bouquets and brickbats. I do not have at hand a card catalogue of everything that every critic has said about George Eliot. A good many of the critical remarks printed in this work sound familiar to me. The idea that some of her heroines approach saintliness in order to teach nobility to her readers (of course in order to "atone" for her own "sin") is not new, I think, but it is pressed farther than I re- member it being by any other critic. George Eliot's worst book would furnish the best backing to this theory, but the wooden vir- tue of Romola, and perhaps the lapse of Esther in Felix Holt into sugary sweetness, are as far as I could go in proving this theory. When Mr. and Mrs. Hanson include Dorothea in this kind of evidence, I, for one, must rebel. But let us save Dorothea for later treatment. The Hansons, whether by their own critical acumen or by en- larging on points already made by others, do come out with some interpretations that add to our pleasure in reading, perhaps because they say what we have long thought, but never said in print, or because they give a new slant to the good old books. One such in- terpretation is the analysis of the developing love between Maggie and Stephen in The Mill on the Floss. The description of Stephen when we first meet him makes him out such a fop that it is hard to admit his later development into a real man swept into infatua- tion by the ardent girl who makes Lucy pale into insignificance. The biographers might have gone on and shown the truth of George Eliot's depiction of the boat journey where Maggie, too, has come under the sway of an unwilled, honest passion. Another nice piece of appreciation is the passage on Silas Marner, which at- tributes a symbolic, dreamlike quality to the simple tale. I think the realism of the scene at the inn is one of G. E.'s best pieces of bu- colic description. It sets off by contrast the story of the little weaver. The Hansons' praise of Gwendolen as "exploratory and detailed</page><page sequence="4">302 Nineteenth-Century Fiction to a degree far exceeding the work of any contemporary novelist" is not, I fear, especially new, but it is well to have it repeated. Henry James's tribute to George Eliot pointed the way to such statements. Another piece of character depiction which the Hansons praise is that of Dorothea in the early chapters of Middlemarch, and no one can quarrel with their enthusiasm. Nor with their appreciative remarks about the development of the love affair of Lydgate and Rosamond. But I, for one, quarrel decidedly with their statement that "Dorothea slips too often from the reader's sympathy after the death of Casaubon." Perhaps she is more serious, more unselfish than the run of female kind. But to me, and to many another reader, she is as real as any character her creator ever gave us. And she loved Ladislaw, whom these critics call "that unfortunate blend of Shelley and Lewes." (Query: do the biographers disapprove of both ? The implication is that they do.) The love of Ladislaw for Dorothea is shown as a cataclysmic stroke which calms down into a true and lasting adoration. Her feeling is traced with as much psychological insight, as much stream-of-consciousness technique, as is the affair of Maggie and Stephen. The real tragedy of the book is, of course, Lydgate's, and I believe that part of George Eliot's purpose, possibly a half-conscious purpose, in Middlemarch is to show what a pass a man can be brought to who seeks as his mate only a pretty plaything, or perhaps a kind of soothing syrup to bring him a let-down after the serious business of life is done for the day. To me, one of the key passages in the book is the one toward the end of chapter 76 (Vol. III) when Lydgate says of Dorothea, "She seems to have what I never saw in any woman before-a fountain of friendship towards men-a man can make a friend of her." Those of us who feel reality in Lydgate feel reality in this feeling of his. His statement seems the clue to one of the aspects of the relation of men and women that interested George Eliot the most. She, too, was "un-Victorian" on this point. No, I cannot feel that Mr. and Mrs. Hanson excel as critics. They are patient and assiduous collectors and assimilators. Their book is</page><page sequence="5">Notes and Queries 303 a compendium of facts and opinions, but their failure with George Eliot's greatest book mars what might have been a good new book on a great novelist. ANNA T. KITCHEL. Toledo, Ohio "MOBY-DICK" The edition of Moby-Dick by Professors Luther S. Mansfield and Howard P. Vincent (Hendricks House: $5.00) is the fifth volume of the projected Complete Works of Herman Melville. It includes a 25-page general introduction, 260 pages of explanatory notes ("nearly one hundred and fifty thousand words," according to the jacket), and a selective index to the introduction and notes. It does not include the "exhaustive study of the differences between the original English and American editions" promised by the jacket, nor does it include the textual notes which are presumably printed in the limited edition for subscribers only. It is a copious, valuable, and puzzling book. Many readers will find it too copious. The short essay on Cato (PP- 593-594), for example, goes considerably beyond the normal requirements for explaining a simple literary allusion; and the comments upon Bayard Taylor seem hardly called for by the im- probable theory that Melville may have been confused about his birthplace and therefore referred to him as "the poor poet from Tennessee." Such notes as these are frequent, and their length helps explain why the binding on my copy of the book is beginning to give way before I have made any extensive use of it. On the other hand, such a collection of miscellaneous information related to Melville and more or less relevant to the text of Moby-Dick should be of real use to scholars and of genuine interest to enthusiastic readers. The editors have made an elaborate and almost exhaustive investigation of sources and analogues, and they have drawn ex- tensively, if not always wisely, upon recent Melville scholarship. My personal preference, at least, would be for considerably less peripheral commentary and a few additional notes on matters cen-</page><page sequence="6">304 Nineteenth-Century Fiction tral to an understanding of the book and its background. Cooper's influence is more evident than one would gather from reading the notes, and it seems to me that the parallels between Coleridge's diagnosis of Hamlet and Melville's of Ahab are both clearer and more important than many of the literary analogies discussed at length. I should like to have seen more attention paid to Melville's humor (particularly a note on the proverbial allusion involved in Pip's query about the doubloon and on Dr. Bunger's tall story on page 439), and I would have been grateful for a reference to an available text of the "well-known song, 'Captain Bunker'" which neither I nor any other Melville scholar of my acquaintance has seen in its entirety. This general lack of judiciousness in the commentary is one quality which makes the book something of a puzzle. I wonder, for example, why Carlyle's Teufelsdrockh is discussed at length in connection with Ishmael when the most significant parallels in- dicated in other notes are with Ahab, and why Newton Arvin is cited on page 609 for the autobiographical character of a passage when Henry Murray's long and interesting note on it in his edition of Pierre is ignored. Its other puzzling quality is the questionable trustworthiness of a volume in which the copyreading permits a reference to Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia, allows refer- ences to Thomas Wilson Melvill when the spelling is normalized for the names of other members of the family who did not use the final "e," and licenses an extraordinary inconsistency in the form of bibliographical references and the abbreviation of periodical names. Among other typographical errors in the notes is the omis- sion of the crucial final "s" from the word "reason" in the annota- tion in the volume of Shakespeare quoted on page 643. I have not observed any particular errors in the text, but such carelessness in the notes leaves me still inclined to trust Arvin's Rinehart edition as the most carefully prepared modern text of Moby-Dick. LEON HOWARD University of California, Los Angeles</page><page sequence="7">Notes and Queries 305 "CAVALCADE OF THE AMERICAN NOVEL" Early in his book, Edward Wagenknecht remarks that "fiction did not become really respectable in America until it had been purified by the stalwart manliness of Cooper and Scott." Before reading very far in Cavalcade of the American Novel (Henry Holt: $4.80) one becomes aware that this is more than a statement of fact. Mr. Wagenknecht makes no secret of his own taste for stalwart manli- ness. For him, the post-1918 years that produced our most sustained literary accomplishment are a "futilitarian era" whose novelists have not kept faith with the good, the true, and the beautiful; and he closes his century-and-a-half survey on a new humanist note of disgruntled aspiration. Now I do not quarrel with any man's right to believe that the smiling aspects of life are the more American, or even that "if you lose the freedom of the will, there can be no morality, and without morality, the novel... cannot possibly have any meaning .... " There is something (perhaps ironical) to be said for the first propo- sition, and a great deal to be said for the second-if it is said care- fully and with a due regard for the beautiful complexities of human beings and their art. But a man who holds these views too literally is certain to be an untrustworthy critical historian of literature: untrustworthy, because he directs our attention away from the process of art itself to his own oversimplified paraphrase of what the novelist seems to be saying. This is a point which, one hopes, hardly needs to be argued; I raise it only because Mr. Wagenknecht forces me to do so, by his insistence on being a critic as well as a historian. For this I admire him. Yet in the end his book is not really about American novels, but a series of judgments about the philosophies of their writers. Mr. Wagenknecht appears to believe it is both-as when he implies that Hemingway would be a better novelist if he had not abandoned the old-fashioned values. (Query: why is Mr. Wagenknecht so sure he did ?) But he does not estab- lish this direct interplay of philosophy and literary quality through</page><page sequence="8">306 Nineteenth-Century Fiction analysis of crucial points of weakness in the structure of the novels themselves. It would seem, finally, that The Sun Also Rises is a poor book because "it has been [successful] in teaching young people how to waste their lives," and because "if one cannot live without illusion... it is better to romanticize beauty than ugliness, healthier to romanticize life than death and the things that make for death." What is particularly disturbing about this evasion of the literary responsibility of the literary critic is that when Mr. Wagenknecht indulges in it he does not do himself justice. For his book abounds in evidence that he is indeed a critic, in spite of himself. When he has decided that a particular writer is on the side of the angels (see, for example, his discovery that Dreiser was not really a natu- ralist after all), he can examine him in a useful and enlightening fashion. But if a writer is in his considered judgment unsound, then Mr. Wagenknecht is likely, as a critic, to be the same. Healthy-mindedness exerts still another unhealthy effect on The Cavalcade of the American Novel. It at times dictates a mighty odd principle of selection. Of course, as Mr. Wagenknecht dis- armingly observes, no survey can include everything. But surely if there is space for The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, there should have been space for that disturbing minor classic, The Story of a Country Town. And what is to be said for a history of the American novel in which F. Scott Fitzgerald, James T. Farrell, and James Gould Cozzens do not appear at all, except in the lumber room of Wagenknecht's appendix ? One would be willing to pass up all these writers if Wagenknecht could account for their absence. But he doesn't. His book unfolds no over-all thematic plan that would make such omissions intelligible. It proceeds on the stand- ardized lines of chronological development and at times is so generously inclusive as to seem a grab bag of data that belong properly in The Oxford Companion to American Literature. This being the case, one has to assume that some highly important novelists have been left out because they make Mr. Wagenknecht</page><page sequence="9">Notes and Queries 307 feel queasy. Does a stand for morality entitle any critic to rig the record ? Art is moral because it is art. It is a mode of perception; it extends the limits of man's self-knowledge. Without such end- less extension, the moral health of a people cannot maintain itself. Mr. Wagenknecht yields to no one in his concern for the souls of his countrymen. But perhaps the quite unintentional moral of The Cavalcade of the American Novel is that while nostalgia for the good old values has been a productive emotion for American novelists, it is no such thing for American critics. BERNARD BOWRON University of Minnesota "OUR EXPLOITS AT WEST POLEY" In Hardy of Wessex (1940) I printed a list of Hardy's short stories in which I stated (p. 266) that, although "Our Exploits at West Poley" was advertised in the Youth's Companion for November 22, 1883, it was "never printed" and was "not published" in book form. In Hardy in America (1946) I was more explicit. I stated (p. 84) that on November 5, 1883, Hardy addressed a letter to the editor of the Youth's Companion, suggesting that in case a sec- ondary title were desired for his story, "A Tale of the Mendips" would do. I then remarked: "It is impossible to say just what hap- pened ....Nothing more was heard of the... Exploits at West Poley." Now, thanks to the persistence, the detective skill, and the pa- tience of Professor Richard L. Purdy, my previous statements about this story are all proved wrong. For it was printed; it was published; and now, with four illustrations by Lynton Lamb, it is made available in a handsome edition with an introduction by Richard L. Purdy (Oxford University Press: $7.50). In presenting his amazing discovery, Professor Purdy informs us that the Exploits, no very short short-story after all, languished in manuscript in Boston for nearly ten years after the Youth's Companion had advertised it. Finally, in 1892-1893, The House-</page><page sequence="10">308 Nineteenth-Century Fiction hold, a (to me wholly unknown) Boston monthly, serialized Our Exploits in six installments, and in the dusty files of this maga- zine it has been lying, hidden and forgotten, for the past sixty years. Even if Hardy's name had not been attached to this "story for boys," Professor Purdy would have been able to recognize it. For Our Exploits has all the familiar Hardy characteristics. The scene (a cave in the Mendip Hills) is vividly presented, with Hardy's eye as alert as ever for striking details; the rustics talk with comic eloquence; and the plot is "sensational" in characteristic Wessex manner. There is even a mysterious stranger who obviously be- longs in the company of J. O. Bailey's "Mephistophelian visitants" (see PMLA, December, 1946). The story shows Hardy's usual clumsiness, but also his characteristic charm, as well as his skill in giving his tale of the Mendips more than ordinary meditative significance. Purdy's find will delight Hardy fans everywhere. CARL J. WEBER Colby College CURRENT BOOKS F. Homes Dudden's Henry Fielding: His Life, Works and Times (2 vols., Oxford University Press: $21.00) is a massive and some- what old-fashioned biography, but it is not a heavy Victorian life- and-times compilation, more stolid than stimulating. Critical treat- ments of the major works are full and detailed; Tom Jones, for example, is discussed at monograph length-150 pages. Neverthe- less, most readers will find the social history of greater interest. Dr. Dudden, master of Pembroke College, Oxford, is a distinguished theologian who is also a historian. It is not surprising, therefore, that his knowledge of critical bibliography, particularly of recent Ameri- can studies, is very shaky. But he has in general a masterly grasp of the facts of Fielding's life and career, and he has rendered them with the authority that comes only with years of familiarity with one's subject.</page><page sequence="11">Notes and Queries 309 Clarence R. Decker's The Victorian Conscience (Twayne: $3.00) is not so inclusive a study as the title suggests. Actually, Mr. Decker examines the British reaction to realism in continental letters, chiefly Balzac, Baudelaire, Zola, Ibsen, and the Russians. The Vic- torian conscience certainly manifested itself in this way; but this was not the only way, and the evidence is often conflicting. Mr. Decker is hard on Trollope, for example, noting several times Trol- lope's "priggish warning 'that it behooves the English novelist to be pure.'" But he does not mention Trollope's own battles with the censors. Nevertheless, Mr. Decker's book is packed with interesting and amusing material of cultural significance. Some of the facts, however, might have been rechecked, for errors have crept in. One of them, unfortunately, occurs in the very first paragraph, where Charles Reade's Griffith Gaunt is declared to be the work of Kingsley. Shortly before his death Dixon Wecter edited for publication a Mark Twain volume now titled Report from Paradise (Harper: $2.50). This consists of two pieces: the full text of Captain Storm. field's Visit to Heaven, only part of which had been previously published, and "Letter from the Recording Angel," first pub- lished in 1946. It is easy to understand why it was not considered wise to publish these during the author's lifetime, though they seem unexceptionable now. Captain Stormfield is an amusing satire on anthropomorphism and on solemnly literal religious beliefs, but it is a bit prolix and suffers from the lack of a final au- thorial revision. The brief "Letter," on the other hand, is first-rate Mark Twain. Here in a broadside against Andrew Langdon, Olivia's uncle, Mark wrote his "Holy Willie's Prayer," a raking fire on hypocrisy that is also hilarious foolery. It is good to have these two derisive jeux d'esprit. The English Novelists Series has recently been taken over in the United States by Roy Publishers, who have issued four titles in addition to the Le Fanu volume noticed in the December number of NCF. Julian Symons's Dickens, though it will annoy Dicko-</page><page sequence="12">310 Nineteenth-Century Fiction laters and though there are such lapses as a discussion of Arthur Clennam and Flora Finching as characters in Our Mutual Friend, is probably the best brief treatment of the novelist ever written. Mr. Symons suggests that Dickens shows strongly marked manic- depressive traits and that his "remarkably accurate clinical descrip- tions of nervous disorders... correspond almost exactly in many instances to features of his own behavior." Dickens's works "re- flect life with an extraordinary intensity, but they reflect it in a distorting mirror .... In the whole of Dickens's work there is not one relationship between a man and a woman which is adult, rather than a product of childish fantasy." Mr. Symons contends that though Dickens is "the greatest creative writer of the Vic- torian age in England," he cannot offer us a perfect novel. His work is rather "a collection of magnificent fragments." Robert Ashley's Wilkie Collins, though it has the misfortune of follow- ing Kenneth Robinson's full-length study, emphasizes notably the trend toward the serious study of a novelist once dismissed as merely ingenious. Indeed, it is Mr. Ashley's fault that he takes his assignment somewhat too seriously and thereby produces a critique that suffers from academic anemia. Nevertheless, his analy- sis of the fiction, both long and short, is certainly the fullest and best informed that we have had. It would be unjust not to sing out Hallelujah for an otherwise unexceptionable study of a novelist who has been not only neglected but scandalously neglected. Two other current volumes in the series are George Blake's Barrie and the Kailyard School and Jocelyn Brooke's Ronald Firbank. S. Diana Neill's A Short History of the English Novel (Mac- millan: $2.50) attempts to answer the need for a comprehensive one-volume survey that will not neglect the twentieth century. That Miss Neill does not entirely succeed is partly owing to the magnitude of her task. She must scatter her shot very widely, and she is driven perforce to generalizations. That way disaster lies. Since her potential audience must be assumed beginners in the field, unusual wariness is demanded. But what is the student to</page><page sequence="13">Notes and Queries 311 understand who reads, "Trollope was no thinker: he did not criticize the world he depicted"? And, again: "Like Jane Austen, he was a snob"? The first statement is both irrelevant and untrue, the second is most misleading. The ration of space may also give students a false set of relative values. Trollope is allotted 1 ? pages, Thackeray 5, Jane Austen 5~; yet Aldous Huxley gets 8?, Butler 9, and Lawrence 10. In a volume of essays a writer may be as selec- tive as he chooses, but a literary history should preserve a better judicial balance. Stephen Crane: An Omnibus (Knopf: $5.00), edited by Robert Wooster Stallman, is by no means a run-of-the-press anthology. It is an important contribution to Crane scholarship, not only by virtue of the editor's long introduction and briefer section prefaces, but more importantly in the choice of Crane material, particularly the letters, of which 57 are hitherto unpublished. With these is an interesting discussion of the exasperating problems involved in making available the vital Crane correspondence. No group of collectors and executors, unless it be that of Emily Dickinson, has ever so baffled scholarship as the "protectors" of Stephen Crane. Professor Stallman declares that the selection of Crane's best work for this big volume (740 pages) "has been determined by critical standards, not by mere personal taste." Perhaps so, and certainly the result is eminently praiseworthy, but one wishes that the editor had chosen another tone. No doubt Crane's earlier edi- tors and biographers have set no example of diligence and taste, but one is led to feel that Mr. Stallman presses the point too hard. Nevertheless, it is rarely that the editor of an anthology emerges on this basis alone as the leading authority on his subject, but this is without doubt Mr. Stallman's achievement. John W. Dodds's The Age of Paradox: A Biography of England 1841-1851 (Rinehart: $6.00) is Required Reading for all who are interested in Victorianism. This handsome book (there are 192 illustrations) re-creates the daily life of the period better than anything known to the present writer. And this in spite of the</page><page sequence="14">312 Nineteenth-Century Fiction fact that Professor Dodds's work had been anticipated in many respects by able predecessors. One thinks of Trevelyan's English Social History, G. M. Young's symposium Early Victorian Eng- land, and R. J. Cruikshank's Charles Dickens and Early Victorian England. Much of the material is therefore familiar, but by reduc- ing his perspective to a single decade Mr. Dodds is enabled to give his work both greater unity and a heightened narrative and dra- matic sense. What is lost in sweep is recaptured in intensity. The publication of Lesbia Brandon (British Book Centre: $7.50), a fragment of a novel by Swinburne, has led to a furious and pro- longed controversy in the TLS between Randolph Hughes, the editor of the piece, and Alfred Noyes, who strongly doubts the authenticity of portions of the MS. The figure of T. J. Wise, which looms ominously in the background of this picture (with Edmund Gosse uncomfortably close to his elbow), suggests that almost any kind of legerdemain is possible. Whatever may be the facts of the history of the MS and the ubiquitous galleys, it is certain that Lesbia Brandon will not "elevate" Swinburne as a novelist. It is also certain that Mr. Hughes is an injudicious critic and a most reprehensibly careless editor. It will not suffice to insist that an editor's duties cease with the submission of the MS to the publisher. The author of Rogue Herries and The Cathedral may not have been an inspired novelist, but in Hugh Walpole (Macmillan: $5.00) Rupert Hart-Davis finds in him at least a fascinating bi- ographical subject. Walpole gushed best sellers in a way that brought despair to his more sophisticated (and very possibly jeal- ous) rivals, and with book-club success went the potential of in- dulging expensive tastes: books, manuscripts, paintings, objets d'art, and a beautiful home at Derwentwater. Yet Walpole was a tortured soul-highly emotional, by turns too sweet and bearishly irritable, thin-skinned and sadly maladjusted for ordinary living. His story, so outwardly sanguine, is full of a deep inner pathos, and Mr. Hart-Davis has done scholarly and sympathetic justice to it in one of the very best biographies of recent years.</page><page sequence="15">Notes and Queries 313 Howard Mumford Jones's monograph The Bright Medusa (Uni- versity of Illinois Press: $2.50) is a keen analysis of the revolt of youth in the name of art against contemporary culture. Taking the Fitzgerald revival as the occasion of his remarks, Professor Jones comments learnedly but wittily on the enigmatic lure which the life of art holds for youth, and on the disastrous results in the 1920's of concentration upon self as the measure of value. Of the pessimism which has flooded our time Mr. Jones remarks, "no period previous to ours has tried to establish the autonomy of art on the premise that the world of the spirit has vanished." The revolt had patent weaknesses, and these Mr. Jones thoroughly explores, but he contends that it was in its day "a healthy move- ment of demoralization," and he hopes for another such revolt against "the dead weight of conformity that now lies upon us." Despite the tremendous current interest in the American short story few critics have been tempted to a historical survey. The standard text, which is still that of Pattee, is not only thirty years old but concludes with O. Henry. Ray B. West, Jr., now comes forward to up-date such obsolete accounts with The Short Story in America: 1900-1950 (Regnery: $3.00). Mr. West brings to his task wide reading and a keen critical intelligence. He would be the first to admit, however, that in 125 pages it is difficult, if not impossible, to avoid superficiality; indeed, he modestly calls his study "unpretentious." But the temper and the climate of the criti- cism of fiction has changed so markedly since Pattee that a full- length treatment is very badly needed. The quality of Mr. West's little volume suggests that he may well be the man to supply it. One of the most delightful novelties of the year is Philip Ham- burger's J. P. Marquand, Esquire (Houghton Mifflin: $2.00), sub- titled "A Portrait in the Form of a Novel." Mr. Hamburger, a staff member of the New Yorker and a frequent writer of that maga- zine's well-known "profiles," has produced a unique literary hy- brid-a biography that is also a parody. Mr. Hamburger clearly admires his subject, and he knows him well enough to be sure</page><page sequence="16">314 Nineteenth-Century Fiction that an affectionate chuckle at his mannerisms will not be mis- interpreted. If the portrait is sometimes irreverent, it is always good natured. Trollopians will no doubt welcome the first edition of Did He Steal It?, published in a limited edition ($3.00) by the Princeton University Library for its friends. Of the two known copies of this unproduced play, privately printed for the author, one is in the Parrish Collection at Princeton. This has been reproduced in fac- simile with an introduction by Robert H. Taylor. Since in his Autobiography Trollope admitted that he had no skill in plotting, and since the dialogue of his novels, while often of cumulative strength, is rarely crisp or epigrammatic, it is not surprising to find Did He Steal It? sadly inept as a drama. Perhaps the chief, if not the only, virtue of this oddity is that it serves to define more precisely the limits of Trollope's talent. Potpourri: In the handsome Oxford Illustrated Trollope the "Palliser" series is continued with The Prime Minister (2 vols.: $8.50), which carries an informed preface by L. S. Amery and period illustrations by Hector Whistler. Simultaneously, we have The Warden ($4.00) as the first of the Barsetshire novels. There is a full introduction by Mgr. Ronald Knox, who is as witty, urbane, and charming as one would expect, and there are amusing illus- trations by Edward Ardizzone .... Oxford has also reprinted in its World's Classics "Double" series ($2.00) Marcus Clarke's For the Term of His Natural Life, one of the greatest novels of Vic- torian Australia. Trollope tells us that he read it "with great pleasure." For this edition Dr. L. N. Allen of Canberra University College contributes a fine introduction which suggests a number of reasons why Clarke's book is still vital .... Samuel Butler's The Way of All Flesh has now been reprinted in the Everyman Ameri- can Editions (Dutton: $1.45), with a long and understanding introduction by George Moreby Acklom .... One of the bargains of the year for students is An Introduction to Dickens, edited by Edward Wagenknecht (Scott, Foresman: $2.50). Great Expecta-</page><page sequence="17">Notes and Queries 315 tions is reprinted in its entirety, and there are a dozen other selec- tions of varying length in a volume of 880 pages .... That Kather- ine Anne Porter is a writer of magnificient stories has long been recognized; that she is also a sensitive critic is fully documented in The Days Before (Harcourt, Brace: $4.00), her volume of col- lected essays. Though she is chiefly concerned with contemporary literature, there is much to interest students of nineteenth-century fiction, particularly the stout defence of Thomas Hardy against the attacks of T. S. Eliot, and the analysis of the effect on James of his family background .... Essays in Modern Literary Criticism (Rinehart: $6.00), edited by Ray B. West, Jr., is a valuable 600- page anthology covering the backgrounds, the theory, and the practice of current criticism. There are also useful bibliographies. ... John Carter's A B C for Book-Collectors (Knopf: $3.00), a dic- tionary of words and phrases which bibliophiles should know, is probably the best book of its kind. Can you identify "niger," "dentelle," "yapp edges"? If not, consult John Carter .... Ward L. Miner's The World of William Faulkner (Duke University Press: $3.50) is an interesting attempt to distinguish between fact and fiction in a topographical comparison of Oxford and Jefferson, Lafayette and Yoknapatawpha. Mr. Miner's style is anything but exciting, and his book deals with only the raw material of criticism; but someone must do such work, and it is well that it should be done carefully .... William Freeman's Oliver Goldsmith (Philo- sophical Library: $4.50) offers the general reader a pleasant intro- duction to this writer, but specialists will not find it rewarding. When are we to get a really first-rate book on Goldsmith?... Charles C. Mish has compiled a valuable bibliography of English prose fiction 1600-1700. Of the contemplated three parts of this work the first two are at hand (Bibliographical Society of the Uni- versity of Virgina: $1.00 each part). Mr. Mish's list is admittedly a chronological rearrangement of Esdaile, but various additions, deletions, and corrections have been made. For students of the period the value of Mr. Mish's "synoptic overview year by year"</page><page sequence="18">316 Nineteenth-Century Fiction of fiction in English will certainly not be questioned .... The jacket blurb for The Man from Main Street, an anthology of Sinclair Lewis's nonfictional prose edited by Harry E. Maule and Melville H. Cane (Random House: $3.75), declares that not many people think of Lewis "as a militant pamphleteer." Perhaps so. But in a sense this is precisely what Lewis always was-a fire-eater like his friend Mencken who for his apocalyptic denunciations of American charlatanry chose the novel as a more effective medium of attention than the essay. In this volume, at any rate, one can see how much at home he was in a pose as cheeky and iconoclastic debunker. We could well spare the later novels for more of this racy writing .... Dickensians are chuckling over Stanley Young's comedy Mr. Pick- wick (Random House: $2.50), the success of which in London and New York reminds us of Dickens's long interest in the theater. Most of the novels are too panoramic, however, for easy dramatization, and in Mr. Pickwick so much is inevitably sacrificed that the result can be regarded only as a tour de force .... Cooper's The Pathfinder has just been reprinted (Modern Library: $1.25) with a brief but incisive introduction by Norman Holmes Pearson.</page></plain_text>
