At a truly astonishing pace volumes of the E (tudes) P (reliminaires aux) R (eligions) 0 (rientales dans l'Empire Romain) continue to appear. Most of them are typical monographs and may indeed be "preliminary" to a full scale treatment of one of these religions. But their content is so rich that they are not likely to be superseded even by the best synthesis. Francoise Dunand's three volumes Le Culte d'sis dans le Bassin Oriental de la Mediterranee (EPRO 26, Leiden, 1973) is a full scale treatment of high order. For the Western Mediterranean there is nothing of the same scope but Michel Malaise's Les Conditions de Penetration et de Diffusion des Cultes Efgyptiens en Italie (EPRO 28), though different in theme and orientation, has something of the same synthetic quality. Of the two EPRO volumes here to be reviewed Enrica Leospo's deals with a very peculiar object that Malaise, though aware of its existence, saw no need to discuss, whereas Holbl examines more closely, and here and there adds something to, subjects that have found their place in Mme Dunand's great panorama. He differs from her in paying attention to deities other than Isis. Sarapis, Atum, Amun, Ptah appear alongside with Isis as witnesses to a certain religious homonoia (concord) between Ephesus and Alexan- dria, a homonoia which the coins of the Imperial Age explicitly attest (pp. 71 ff.; pl.s 12-15). It is difficult to select some highlights from Holbl's pre- dominantly archaeological chapters. The earliest objects in- dicative of Egyptian influence have come to light in the "archaic" Artemisium where they must have been before the new buildings undertaken by Croesus. They include a flute- player, a kneeling woman, some monkeys, and most interest- ing, a head of Bes (pl. 1) ugly and frightening enough to leave no doubt about its apotropaic purpose. -Inscriptions bearing on the Egyptian deities begin in the first half of the 3rd century B.C., with a dedication to Sarapis, Isis and Anubis as synnaoi (sharers of one temple; p. 43). The temporary sojourn of Antony and Cleopatra in Ephesus (33- 32 B.C.) invites speculation about closer links with Egypt datable to these years, but the temple on the market place which was built in this period cannot with confidence be assigned to Isis or any other Egyptian deity. Future finds may help. A temple farther West (2nd cent.) can on firmer grounds be claimed for Sarapis and the suggestion that some of the niches were meant to accomodate statues of Egyptian, while others those of Greek deities, is probably the best that we can ask for (pp. 35ff.; see also for the temples pp. 27ff., 33ff.). In the last chapter (pp. 79ff.) H. turns to literature. Several Greek novels, most notably the Ephesiaca of a Xenophon (which belongs to the 2nd century but is the shortened version of an older novel) include Isis as well as Ephesus in their plot; writing under the influence of Merkel- bach, H. wonders whether the "Great Diana" (Artemis) of Ephesus may for these writers be a disguise-"Deckname"- of Isis or whether the two cults were similar enough to allow a writer to shift from one goddess to the other-perhaps even without puzzling his contemporaries as much as we are puzzled if we approach these subjects with Merkelbach's theories in mind. Anyone eager for information about the mysterious Isis tablet in Torino but not willing to undergo the long torture of making sense of obscure objects on darkish photos should begin by unfolding the last page of E. Leospo's monograph. Here he will find Enea Vico's reproduction of the entire tabula as it looked in 1559 when much more than today could be seen on it. It is a remarkable composition: Isis throning in the center is approached on both sides by three individuals. Five are anthropomorphic while the sixth by its ibis head identifies himself as Thot. Around this central group there are arranged in three rows ten larger and a number of smaller units. The larger ones usually present three individuals who are often wearing an animal or other symbol as headgear. Above, below and on the sides of these figures we see many more animals, many more symbols, items needed for sacrifice or libation and hieroglyphs in a variety of arrangements and locations. On the four sides of the tabula are sphinxes and other astonishing mixtures, altogether far more "signs and wonders" than I can report. Leospo takes up scene after scene and does her competent best to identify and explain whatever lends itself to such treatment; for some items including hieroglyphs are decora- tive and devoid of meaning. As she argues convincingly the painter copied without bothering to understand what he copied. Her learning and her prudence are equally to be commended.</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 77 The chapter (I) on the 'history' of the mensa informs us at perhaps excessive length about what happened to the piece, i.e. who acquired, who lost it, and where it was taken by right or by force after it had first come to light in connection with the sacco di Roma of 1527. Here we learn amongst other things that the great Champollion, after seeing it in 1824, declared it "fausse et moderne" (pp. 25f.). Clearly what he meant was that it was nothing truly Egyptian, and I doubt whether anybody today would think differently. Signora Leospo is almost certainly right in regarding the representa- tions of Egyptian rituals and similar subjects on the 1st century wall paintings of Campania as the nearest relatives of the tabula (pp. 92ff.). On the way to this conclusion she disposes of some ill founded hypotheses; altogether she does far more good things than I am able to report. Mme Le Corsu traverses a much larger territory than either of the two other books. Her subjects include the relations between Egypt and Greece, myths, cults, mysteries, literary documents, the spreading of Isis worship throughout the Roman provinces and a history of this religion which does not even conclude with the triumph of Christianity but goes on to revivals of interest (or curiosity) in Isis during the Renaissance, in free masonry and elsewhere. Unfortunately her equipment is inadequate. The 'evidence' that allows her to detect Egyptian influence in the 'Homeric' hymn to Demeter (pp. 60f.) cannot be taken seriously, and to hold the Orphics-yes, of all people, the Orphics-responsible for the assimilation of Demeter to Isis (as also for fashioning the Dionysus myth after that of Osiris, pp. 70, 76) shows a taste for adventure that may entertain but cannot enlighten. She accepts as literally true what Tibullus and Propertius say in their love elegies (p. 190) and reconstructs without hesitation the ordeals that Apuleius does not report but that she is sure belonged to initiation into Isis' service (pp. 148ff.) since they appear on the walls of Herculaneum. However the book is clearly a labor of love and as an introduction to the diffusion of Isis' cult, e.g. in Roman Gaul, it may prove useful.
