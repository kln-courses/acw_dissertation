<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXHIBITIONS IN NEW YORK Reviewed by ELIZABETH McCAUSLAND ALLEN TUCKER Whitney Museum TcpTHE THINGS that one has seen all one's life are the things that are down deepest in one. Mark Twain said 'Unconscious observation is the only important observation'. A great many artists have painted out of their own country. One could make a list of them, but nevertheless I think that our job is to stay here and paint; to go abroad and learn-to come back here and create. Go abroad not necessarily to draw from a model, but go abroad to see the glories of the world that through the centuries man has made, but come back here and help to continue to create American ideas and ideals. To help here at this critical time not only with one's product but with one's personality, for the future of this country depends on the ideas that are now created, and ideas are created first by art. For the creative imagination must rule the mind. The mind must not limit the creative imagination. The affair of the painter is to exercise and develop his creative imagination. The country depends on him. He must develop and express his ideas, his visual ideas in terms of design. He must see-see visions, for where there is no vision the people perish." Allen Tucker stated his creed of life thus in Design and the Idea. The fruits of his action in art are now being shown in a memorial exhibition of some forty oils and a score of recent water colors. The evolution of twenty-five years- from Le Vieux Cordes and The High Balcony of 1914 up to his death last January-is set forth in a sequence which makes his late Expressionism the logical outgrowth of his early Impressionism. As his stroke broadened and grew more emotional, so also his palette became freer, as may be noted in the change from the somber monotones of Josie Collins, 1918, to the seething pigment of Sundown, Gotts Island, 1930. The religious spirit which Tucker's friend and biographer, Forbes Watson, stresses as the strongest motive power in his work also intensified. The Review of 1931 is an anticipation of the 1936 Crucifixion, the giant skeleton in major-general's uniform surely being an ethical protest against war and its waste. In considering the sum total of the ideas which Tucker has bequeathed to his country, vide his own manifesto, one must note a more significant phenomenon than ques- tions of style or mood. Something of Tucker's set of philosophic values crept into his work. Human beings are the least active and least interesting elements in his pic- tures. Could it be that this represents the artist's evaluation of humanity as tiny, insignificant ants? The canvas Aground, 1932, notably minimizes its human figures, as does The Linesman, 1928, where the telephone repair man mending a line in a blizzard can scarcely be seen as the artist has contrived his composition. This deliberate act of will may be taken as reflecting the value the painter set on mankind. Similarly in such pictures as The Strike and The Dead Factory, of about the same period, the active human element is dwarfed to static minute forms, while the real action is to be found in the swirl and im- pasto of paint. These esthetic preoccupations Tucker prob- ably found more satisfying than the struggle and clash of men and women in the real world. But it is a question as to whether nature can answer all hungers or provide pro- tection from those doubts which will invade the human soul whose chief society is itself. Such spiritual isolationism drains vitality from art; and Tucker's work is no exception. BURCHFIELD WATER COLORS 1917-1918 At Rehn Remembrance of time past-"certain moods and impres- sions of my childhood"-occupied Burchfield's mind when he painted these water colors two decades ago. His at- tempt to recreate and to record his memories endows the work with overtones of nostalgia and fantasy. It is a dream world he pictures, peopled with anthropomorphic houses (The Cat-Eyed House) and winking trees, weath- ered clapboards which seem to wave in the wind and dandelion puffballs like haloes. Most nostalgic recollection is A Small Town, of which he wrote in a carefully docu- mented diary, "A fanciful summary of a small town in which the houses seem to reflect the personality of the people who live in them, be they smug, querulous, or pol- lyanna in character." A valentine of a house, tucked in the center of the picture, must speak of loving thoughts; but the deepest nostalgia is shown in the locomotive with steam up. Here is symbol of that ever-recurrent hunger TWENTY-TWO</page><page sequence="2">PORTRAIT OF A LADY ANTONIO MORO (1519-76) This magnificent panel, one of a pair, is included in the inaugural exhibition of "Portraits by Masters of the XVI, XVII &amp; XVIII Centuries" at the Galleries of James St. L. O'Toole, continuing on view until December sixteenth.</page><page sequence="3">NATIVITY At the Robinson Galleries LOUISE CROSS for flight which a million Americans suffered on Main Street. The Burchfield exhibition is a memory of a memory. The water colors have not been exhibited before; and the only previous exhibition of work of this period was that held at the Museum of Modern Art in 1930. Burchfield him- self selected the thirty-nine examples; and that he is at last willing to show the work has a peculiar significance. Time has given him the necessary detachment to view them as if they were "the work of another man." to which he adds the reservation "as indeed I may well be." In this perspective Burchfield sees the 1917-1918 period as a "romantic" one. The observer, blessed with another kind of detachment (not necessarily superior!) feels that romantic is not the exact adjective. Much of the work is pure poetry and pure fun, in a fantastic spirit. The plane of feeling is def- initely that of time past: its intensity is that of remem- brance, rather than of immediate experience. By the safe light of memory, gibbous moons are not terrifying, but esthetic. The primitive vision of a child is recaptured in the slightly wooden tree of Violets, and it is a boy's will reflected in the light swaying of meadow grasses in Wind Over the Hill. The emotions of adolescence, cen- tered on simplified perceptions, have been filtered through recollection, so that almost every water color has that cool stillness of a dream. Dreamlike too is the haunted-house quality of some of the work. In these paintings memory has been a mute on strings. And indeed as one surveys Burchfield's later work, this mood of spiritual detachment appears as a dominant characteristic. It is the mood of the poet, too gentle for the battle, solacing himself with fairy- tales because the stories of real life are too terrible to hear. CHANG SHAN TSE PAINTINGS At Nierendorf "O China, roar like these tigers!" began the first line of the poem inscribed by Chang Shan Tse on his great mural, in which eighteen tigers symbolize the eighteen provinces of China. Unfortunately, this painting (ten foot high and twenty foot long) cannot be shown in the present exhibi- tion because of its size. Nevertheless it suggests the ob- jectives of the painter. A poet, a professor, a scholar, Chang Shan Tse has utilized the tradition of Chinese painting to contain the new content of his councry's struggle for independence. In the style of the Ming dynasty he paints of Chinese resistance to invasion. The tiger, he declares, shall be China's new symbol to replace the dragon. The coiled and tense strength of this animal he loves. It is shown ready to spring into action, whereas traditionally the dragon has been inert and passive. The new symbol he came by dramatically. In China's libera- tion movement of 1911, Chang Shan Tse led three thou- TWENTY-FOUR</page><page sequence="4">sand Chinese guerillas. When they laid down their arms and took up the arts of peace once more, their parting gift to their leader was three tiger cubs. One remained as a family pet, till it had to be left behind when the family fled Suchow. Japanese bombs killed that tiger-but not the tiger of China, Chang Shan Tse asserts. A hundred of his paintings were exhibited at the New York World's Fair. But the current exhibition offers an opportunity to study his fine craftsmanship and poetic spirit in more inti- mate circumstances. WORK OF YVES TANGUY At Pierre Matisse Gallery A member since 1926 of the Paris surrealist group, Yves Tanguy will open his first American one-man show De- cember 12th. The Tanguy exhibition, which will consist of a dozen oils and a number of water colors and draw- ings, is the first of a series being arranged in this country with the approval of the French minister of education; and the artist has traveled to the United States with the authorization of the French government to open the dis- play. A percentage of the sales will be sent to a com- mittee in Paris for the purchase of works by French ar- tists, which in turn will be sent to America for further exhibitions. A fair-sized group of Tanguy paintings was included in the Museum of Modern Art exhibition, Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism, held in 1932. The present selections serve to reenforce the impression gained at that time, namely, that the quality of Tanguy's work is pleasanter than that of Dali. The macabre and pathological do not dominate Tanguy's paintings, although there are certain morbid elements incorporated. His chief concern, aside from arousing emotion in the spectator, is with space and light. His perspective is a vanishing one, with the horizon an illusion. Air bathes this sphere, which at once seems to curve backwards and away from the eye and also inward and toward the eye. His spatial conflict is staged, how- ever, in a perpetual twilight; for Tanguy's light is not a blazing midday sun, but the diffused glow of the nether world. These ambiguities of space and light are the re- flections of a tenuous world outlook, one would say. This spectral universe, peopled by inanimate objects or disiecta membra of human forms, is as illusory as the unstable horizon line or the uncertain perspective. Minutely and meticulously painted (the gouaches are par- ticularly spectacular, because of the delicate craftsmanship involved in painting tiny, fragile objets in careful chiaro- scuro in this temperamental medium) the Tanguy paint- ings are the results of an esthetic based on complicated concepts of negation. This world which does not end in infinity is a denial of the realities of practical existence. This amorphous and indefinite half-light is a day which never ends, because it has no beginning in measurable and recognizable time. These bloodless arms and legs have not suffercd the agony of dismemberment, because they have never lived with human organs, functions and sensa- tions. Essentially this universe is a vacuum, from which vital energy, thought, feeling and will have been stripped. beaches with the emptiness of their discontent. Not for these silent forms to "tease us out of thought As doth eternity." These are the parched, sere fossils of futility, morphology of interest to the culture archeologist, scarcely food for the living. HANDFORTH DRAWINGS At Hudson D. Walker Preliminary drawings for a children's book, Faraway Mea- dow, comprise the bulk of the Thomas Handforth exhibi- tion, though portrait drawings of East Indian types, wash drawings of the landscape of India and Chinese land- scapes around Peiping are also included. In addition there are three oils, a medium in which Handforth has not ex- hibited before. Resident in China for some years, whence he has recently returned by way of India, the artist reflects FOLLETTE TOULOUSE LAUTREC In the Current Exhibition "Small Masterpieces of XIX Century French Art" at Durand-Ruel Frozen in history, surrealism's symbols strew forlorn TWENTY-FIVE</page><page sequence="5">HEAD OF KWAN YIN T'ANG DYNASTY From the Lung Men Cave Temple In the current exhibition of Chinese stone sculpture at Yamanaka &amp; Company. qualities of the landscape and of the art of this country in his drawings for Faraway Meadow. The horses, elephants, deer, tigers and other animals are drawn with great delicacy of line and fine modeling; they curvet and prance amid trees, streams, rocks, mountains too ethereal for mundane eyes. Here is fantasy of another kind than Burchfield's introspective dream world. SMALL MASTERPIECES At Durand-Ruel Scale is a constant deception. Picasso is always springing surprises with his postage stamp colossi, such as the Stand- ing Nude of the Wadsworth Atheneum, measuring the grand total of 71/2 by 51/2 inches! This is to be expected of Picasso. But when the now relatively staid masters of late nineteenth century painting try the same tricks, what are we to think? Where is the old stability of "Art is long"? At any rate, these pictures are small, and they are masterpieces. And that brings up the abstract proposition of scale again. What can be said in favor of the large picture, as the large mural? Immediately the answer is: It can be seen at great distances and by large numbers of people. Is the small picture then a closet art, a miniature lovingly gloated over by its maker and no less lovingly caressed by its owner through the platonic magnifying-glass? Or may it be that the small painting, complete in itself and con- ceived with spatial largesse, was an anticipation of the age when millions would see their pictures reduced to the con- ventional proportions of newspaper cuts? Today the mag- nitude of reality is usually encompassed in two or three columns. In these small masterpieces, the physical factor was about the same. If these hypotheses are too fanciful, it may be suggested that these small paintings represent a private passion of their makers, an intimate conversation with a precious and beloved theme. In such a painting as the Lautrec Follette there is no scanting on loving care: the device by which the dog's figure is placed in relation to natural planes is seemingly casual but really very adroit, the fillip of geuius. By the opposition of the plane of the floor and the plane of the wall, the dog is made more commanding. Yet the whole panel is painted with elan. A chrysanthemum of a dog is Manet's Douki, where the esthetic problem is nor a spatial one, but one of rendering light on the dog's hair. More architectural is the Renoir Baigneuse of 1882. An excellent racetrack subject is Degas' Chevaux de Courses, while the Manet La Jetee de Boulogne has a broad sweep, appropriate to landscape. Classical is the Pissarro figure painting, Femme et Enfant dans les Champs. Representing van Gogh in his less seen Paris phase is a street scene along the Seine, while Daumier's Les Avocats might be 11 by 8 feet instead of inches, so imposing is the painter's conception. PAINTINGS BY LEBDUSKA At Valentine Gallery The fantasy of folk lore is Lebduska's theme. Pandas (Urformen der Natur of the teddy-bear) cheetahs, pink and lavender elephants, white and rose horses, flowers like embroidery, wild asses, a green snake strangling a panther, a fabulous wealth of watermelons-these are his dramatis personae. Topical, popular, illustrative, his art has the true character of folk art; it speaks to the folk. His is a dream world, too, but with the heightened vibrato of brilliant hues, astiringent as plucked strings. The formal quality of his design would be mechanical except for this high frequency of feeling, expressed also in gauche nuances of drawing. HOLIDAY SHOW At Perls Galleries Chagall strikes the midnight of Noil in this exhibition, while the Vlaminck Snowy Landscape sets the proper stage for the holiday season. The fantasy of Chagall is that of an innocent heart; his clock has been metamorphosed into a semi-human fact. But it is the awkwardness and sim- plicity of his cock and old man which really cheer the soul. Equally his Le Veau et la Dame has the high spirits of a good joke. Chirico Horses add to the desired gay effect. TWENTY-SIX</page><page sequence="6">LIMITED EDITIONS OF SCULPTURE At Robinson Galleries "Sculpture in Limited Editions"-that is, the idea of pro- ducing multiple originals of a sculpture, as a print is a multiple original-has been in operation now six months. Latest news bulletin is the addition to the list of small pieces cast in hard plaster and selling for as low as $5 and $7.50. Original price range was $15 to $100, so the additions are carrying on the work of bringing sculpture within the reach of millions of moderate income. New titles in the "library" are the de Creeft Turkish Venus, the Schmitz Girl with Lute, the Wheelock Walt Whitman, the Margaret Brassler Kane Torso, the Hugo Robus Mother and Child, three Slobodkin numbers, the small original sketch for his fifteen-foot Lincoln wantonly destroyed at the World's Fair and two humorous pieces of sailors. The feature of the new list is the Louise Cross Nativity, the galleries' first venture into plastics. This piece is typical of the technical problems of produc- tion involved in the galleries' adventure in multiple orig- inals of sculpture. Methods had to be worked out for the making of the pieces in cast stone and for the carving of the wood pieces. Now experimentation continues into the as yet unexplored field of plastics. The problem is com- plex. Sculpture can be cast (very expensively) one at a time in plastics; or a block of plastic can be carved, but always at the risk of "checking." Or a die can be made of lead or steel into which the liquid or paste-like plastic is forced under pressure. The latter use is a cheap method from the point of view of production costs. But to tool up for it is very costly, the chief item of expense being the die. Unless one could be certain of a sale of from 10,000 to 20,000 units, this method is out of the question. The idea of an "edition" of fifty or one hundred is absurd. So-to make sculpture in plastics, the Robinson Galleries worked out an intermediate method. The first plastic sculpture is The Nativity, the six traditional figures of Virgin, Child, Joseph, Angel, Sheperd and Ox. The The plastic is transparent, with a faint rose-lavender tint. The group is mounted on a base and illuminated from below as shown in the reproduction. The hunger of the public for art at popular prices is in- dicated by the fact that traveling exhibitions have gone to about forty cities. Here is a new deal for the Cinderella of the fine arts. ENGLISH SPORTS IN ART At Knoedler's Far cry from the loneliness of Ryder and Newman to the English sporting prints and paintings now on view. Yet both exhibitions may be thought of as holding up the mirror to life. In America of the late nineteenth century, art was a lonely business. In England of the early nine- teenth century, art was a business. In America at the end of the ninteenth century, the main current of creation turned to building transcontinental railroads, expanding industrial plant and integrating the mercies of sensitive plants like Ryder and Newman, who suffered, inwardly bled and produced their masterpieces, a sterile species which could not perpetuate itself. In England at the beginning of the nineteenth century, power lay in the hands of the newly emerging industrialists. The voice of the steam engine was heard through the land. In Nottingham, weavers displaced by machinery rioted. Blake's passionate cry had been of no avail: Jerusalem had not been built in England's green and smiling land. But the new industrialist class was finding life more than pleas- ant. There were the excellent and really beautiful color prints of sporting events with which to decorate a tired business man's study; they could be bought for two or three guineas, today a set of eight brings ?1,400 at Sotheby's. For diversion-and to keep down an expanding waistline-there was hunting. Racing and coaching, shoot- ing grouse, pheasants, partridge and ducks were other amusements. This whole world is brilliantly and vividly visualized in the work of Wootton, Sartorius, Stubbs, La Porte, Alken, Cordrey, Wolstenholme and others.

Art was left to the tender TWENTY SEVEN</page><page sequence="7">BRUSH DRAWING ANGNA ENTERS Currently at the Newhouse Galleries UNKNOWN AMERICAN PAINTERS Come and gone without fanfare is the exhibition of this title, organized by the advisory committee of the Museum of Modern Art and shown in the Members' Room of the museum last month. Without questioning the value of the "advisory committee's laboratory for experiment and research," one may sincerely challenge the proposition with which this exhibition made its bow. This was: "While the exhibition consists of eighteen unknowns, it is merely an indication of the fertility of the little-touched source from which this group, preponderantly non-professional, springs. The professional artist has not been overlooked, but so much has been done for him by galleries and mu- seums, collectors and writers, that there is comparatively little difficulty for the professional of merit to find an audience. On the other hand, the non-professional does not enjoy this advantage. He finds a public little prepared to encourage him, since it has had only a limited oppor tunity to orient itself to his work.' This statement involves two fallacies. The first is that the professional artist has all the opportunity he needs to go ahead in his "profession," develop professionally and sup- port himself by the practice of his profession. The testi- mony of thousands of painters, sculptors and printmakers is to the contrary. The second is that the non-professional by virtue of being non-professional is therefore of a higher order of creative significance than the professional. We do not surrender our bodies to non-professional medicoes nor our legal tangles to non-professional jurists. The deeper danger in such formal encouragement of the primitive is that a cult is being built up comparable to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's doctrine of the splendid savage. Let a man or woman be a simple village wight, and that per se makes him or her a good painter. To be sure, the simple direct vision of the child has its own strength and character, and the adult who can preserve simplicity and innocence plus the added strength of mature knowledge is thrice blessed. But the child's vision is not inherently bet- ter than the man's. Sometimes it has the advantage of cutting through sham, as in the case of the emperor's new clothes. But it would not be at all equipped to see what the X-ray sees; the X-ray is the invention of controlled science. The faith of the child may move mountains; but the dynamite of men can be more certainly counted on for vast construction projects. IMMORTELLES FOR FEDERAL ART GALLERY Characteristic of the widespread opportunity of professional artists to practice their trade is the closing of the Federal Art Gallery at 225 West 57th Street. Thus has the Wood- rum Bill joined the museums and galleries, collectors and writers in encouraging the professional. Before the ax fell. the gallery had chalked up a notable record of forty ex- hibitions, making it (as Robert M. Coates says in a fore- word to the gallery's closing report) "the home of hope." Here hundreds of unknown artists had a chance to show their work and to let it be judged on its merits. Painters and sculptors and printmakers who could never have hoped to rent a gallery for a two-weeks' show at last had their place on 57th Street. "A Preview of the Art of the Fu- ture," the gallery's report on its forty exhibitions is sub. titled; in this, Lilliam Semons points out "the purpose and function of an art gallery for the people: to preserve for safe keeping beyond the abuse of time and neglect our heritage from the past, while it establishes a firm founda- tion for the future of art." (Continued on page 45) TWENTY-EIGHT</page><page sequence="8">(Continued from page 28) Religion of another kind has pervaded masks through history. In animistic societies, the mask had an important psychological function: it created a mood of security in its wearer, who felt that its protection frustrated pow- erful spirits. In primitive cultures the role of magic was a major one; its re- sultant art was endowed with magic's own potency. Committed neither to animism, deism nor monism, one may still respond to the urgency and mor- dant power of these masks. The variety of uses for masks is briefly outlined in Dr. Herbert J. Spinden's eminently readable essay, issued by the museum in connection with its ex- hibition. Besides the first use for magic, masks have been used from early times in the dances of primitive peoples. This led to their use in the theater, in Classic Greece and Japan and in modern times generally. Ven- eration of the dead was responsible for the mummy and the mask in Egypt, for sepulchral masks in the treasure tombs of Mycenae and in the Andes. In the modern era masks survived in folk dances and the Carnival; and, latest refinement of civilization, in gas masks and beauty packs. All these uses are excellently demonstrated in the exhibition. Particularly beautiful or interesting are: a bronze burial mask from Ecuador, an armor mask with helmet from Japan, a ceremonial mask from New Ireland, a ceremonial mask of the Dan tribe from Africa, a cere- monial mask of the False-Face Society of the Iroquois, and the theatrical mask from Japan, illustrated on page twenty-seven. SUGGESTION Christmas comes but once a year: PAR- NASSUS eight times. Shopping causes trench feet: hard sought presents are soon forgotten. But gift subscriptions to PARNASSUS (with Christmas card) require only the filling out of the blank enclosed with this issue. CORRIGENDA Through an editorial error, the Chagall painting, The Betrothed, referred to by Howard Devree in his article on the Carnegie International in the Novem- ber issue of PARNASSUS, was mis- taken for an earlier, similar canvas. (Continued from page 35) the enormous role of the workshops in the production of the great Venetian painters has been too often overlooked. The autographic status of these paint- ings, orignally secondary, become overwhelmingly important, partly be- cause of our preponderant interest in the creativeness of the individual artist, partly because of the pressure of the art market, where the difference be- tween a work by the master's own hand and one produced with the help of assistants is considered enormous. The tendency to find everywhere the master's touch and to overlook the fact that at this time a more or less exten- sive collaboration was customary has resulted in attributing to the leading masters poorer productions which by their stylistic and technical character- istics resemble the authentic master- pieces. Actually, these secondary works were often by assistants who, through long training and collabora- tion with their master, inevitably came to share or imitate his peculiarities. We must reject works about whose au- thenticity there exists any doubt and attribute to the great artists only those which display that mysterious original- ity and superiority on which intrinsic criticism rests. If these considerations seem to lead to negative results, I would point out as in my books on Titian and on Tin- toretto, that we have to reduce the im- mensely swollen list of works of these and other great masters, and give back to their workshops what they may justly claim in the light of the pro- fessional habits of the period. In closing, I wish once more to emphasize the fact that the activity of the Vene- tian workshop meant not only a dilut- ing and thereby impoverishment of the master's style, but an enrichment as well. It increased the painters' scope, augmented their effectiveness and af- forded opportunities for trying out on a larger scale artistic principles which in reality were their personal property. The workshop operated under the mas- ter's responsibility; it was an instru- ment to enlarge his scope. Sometimes, from a scientific point of view, a cre- ation vastly indebted to assistants may bear a more convincing evidence of the master's genius than one which no hand other than his has touched.
