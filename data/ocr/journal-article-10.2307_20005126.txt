<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rel. Stud. Io, pp. 6740 JOHN J. SHEPHERD Lecturer in Theology and Religion, Weymouth College of Education REFERRING TO GOD It is a current commonplace that if the concept of deity is incoherent then no significant truth-claim is made for a formula like 'God exists', for it is neither true nor false but meaningless. This is the problem of factual mean ing on which such emphasis is laid by critics like A. Flew, R. W. Hepburn, C. B. Martin, K. Nielsen and P. Edwards. I wish here to counter their challenge. All parties agree that it will not do to argue that 'God' is meaningful because it has a systematic syntactical usage, for it is possible to stipulate and to follow rules for using a term consistently in relation to other terms without ever defining or even understanding that term. Thus 'The Absolute is in process' could function intelligibly in a way that 'Lute sins rock' could not, yet 'Absolute' might remain a total mystery or be incoherent. There fore grammatical intelligibility must be distinguished from the factual intelligibility which is the point at issue here. Typically the claim that basic theistic assertions are factually meaningless rests on a fundamentally empiricist criterion of factual intelligibility which must be eschewed or modified if the theist's case is to stand. Justification of this empiricist criterion is often lacking in critiques of theism which pre suppose it. Noting this, Kai Nielsen attempts to furnish one. He argues that the criterion is justified because both philosophers like himself and many religious believers find themselves struggling unsuccessfully to understand just what is supposed to be meant by putatively factual basic theistic asser tions like 'God exists', 'God creates/sustains the world', 'God loves', 'God acts', where 'God' is defined as incorporeal; because, when assertions are unquestionably factually meaningful, examination reveals that they are in principle empirically confirmable or disconfirmable; and because examina tion of basic theistic assertions reveals that they are not similarly confirmable or disconfirmable. From this it is inferred that empirical confirmability or disconfirmability in principle is the criterion of factual intelligibility. Adoption of this criterion is thus presented, justifiably, not as anti-theistic dogmatism fundamentally begging questions as to the possibility of varieties of fact but as the product of genuine difficulties of comprehension which lead to the felt propriety of generalising 'a method that is repeatedly used in practice by reflective men when they try to decide whether a given use of language makes a factual claim'.' 1 Kai Nielsen, 'The Intelligibility of God-Talk', Religious Studies 6 (March I970), p. 21.

SHEPHERD Clearly if the difficulties of comprehension could be overcome the reasons for resorting to an empiricist criterion would disappear and the possibility of varieties of fact admitted. Since however, as Nielsen agrees, compre hension admits of degrees the temptation to adopt the criterion may never be eliminated. Yet if its appeal is to be reduced it is necessary to take up particular criticisms and extend descriptions of God as far as possible in an effort to cope with difficulties of comprehension. Perhaps the three most severe criticisms are directed against the notions of putative incorporeal identity, incorporeal character, and incorporeal action. The problem of incorporeal identity is the problem that ultimately we appear to identify ourselves as personal continuants by reference to our bodies. Bodily identity is thus apparently a necessary condition of personal identity and one which the divine 'person' cannot fulfil. Consequently 'divine person' is unintelligible.' Yet the status of bodily continuity as a necessary condition of personal identity is open to question. According to proponents of this necessary condition memory is also a criterion of personal identity but subsidiary to and dependent upon the criterion of bodily continuity. Its necessary depend ence is said to spring from the fact that without independent checks it would be impossible to distinguish true memories from false ones.2 But a check on bodily continuity is the only independent check available. Penelhum argues initially that bodily identity is both a necessary and a sufficient criterion. Subsequently however he concedes that it is legitimate to interpret puzzle stories about supposed bodily transfer (for example a prince wakes one morning in a cobbler's hut and body, the cobbler in the prince's palace and body) as stories of, precisely, bodily transfer; by doing so he relegates bodily identity from being a sufficient criterion to relative parity with memory, and although not stated explicitly, implicitly the position seems then to be that neither bodily identity nor memory are individually sufficient criteria but both are necessary and are sufficient jointly. He insists however that this interpretation of puzzle stories, though legitimate, is not mandatory, for an alternative account in terms of 'retrocognition' is also possible, in which case bodily identity would again be both necessary and sufficient.3 Let us agree that bodily transfer is theoretically intelligible (a person's difficulties in expressing his character by means of an alien body being in 1 See A. Flew, God and Philsophy (London, I966), 2.I4; Paul Edwards, 'Difficulties in the Idea of God', in The Idea of God: Philosophical Perspectives (Springfield, Ill., I968), eds. E. H. Madden, R.

Now as Penelhum notes our instinctive preference is for this interpre tation rather than a retrocognition theory. Yet the reasoning behind this preference is said to be philosophically disreputable. If we imagine our selves as one of the protagonists in the story, waking up with all the memories of, say, yesterday's prince, we imagine ourselves as knowing quite clearly that we (still) are the prince despite the cobbler's body. Yet this presupposes that memory could be an independent criterion, which is false because of the impossibility of distinguishing in terms of memory-claims alone between reliable and unreliable memories; and in any case bodily evidence is relevant to interpreting the story-it is necessary to imagine identifying the post change persons through time by reference to the bodies which they then have. Details of the story may apparently be changed however to dispose of the necessary relevance of bodily evidence. Suppose the memory-train characterised yesterday as the prince's comes to consciousness as before in the cobbler's hut and body but this time the cobbler-body is found by observers to be blind, deaf and dumb. The prince-body has meanwhile disappeared. In this situation the 'prince-mind' (in a sense not presupposing that the prince has moved into the cobbler's body rather than that the cobbler is retrocognising the prince's past) could not make itself known as such to anyone and they would have no reason to suppose anything other than that a personal disaster had befallen the cobbler. People would know that the 'prince' had disappeared; but so also without their knowledge would the cobbler-mind (let us assume). The prince-mind would know that its body was being treated strangely but not that it was totally different. It would think that a personal disaster had befallen it but would be unable to determine its scope. Now the logic of the bodily transfer interpretation of the first story strongly suggests that the present phenomenon could legiti mately be interpreted by narrator and audience as 'prince in cobbler's body'. Indeed the prince-mind itself would be presumed to doubt its continued identity even less than in the first case for it would have no ground whatsoever for doubt. But its (private and implicit) identity-claim would be independent of reference to any actual continuing body. Moreover if the further step were taken of making the cobbler-body tactually and olfactorily numb it would then apparently make no difference to the (private and implicit) identity-claim whether any body were there at all. Thus it appears possible to suspend the relevance of actual bodily evidence to personal identity without incoherence. (Admittedly incoherence would be introduced if the disappearance of the prince-body should be followed by the appearance of identical prince-minds in several (similarly incapacitated) cobblers' (or other) bodies; but the purely logical possibility of this happen</page><page sequence="4">70 JOHN J. SHEPHERD ing does not detract from the coherence of the putative logical possibilities of bodily transfer and, consequently, of suspension of the relevance of bodily evidence to personal identity, provided that it were never realised even if the latter possibilities were realised. And certainly believers in personal survival of death, whether religious or not, would claim that the possibility of such duplication of personalities need not be viewed as a threat since, precisely, it never is realised.) Yet if the basic question is not to be begged it is necessary to meet the objection that despite appearances the modified story is incoherent because it reduces the identity claim of the prince-mind to dependence on memory alone. The objection presumably is not that a disembodied (or body-irrele vant) memory-claim could not be entertained-Penelhum admits the possibility of instances of disembodied perception and action, therefore an instance of disembodied memory-claim should be no problem-but that it could not be warranted. However it seems reasonable to argue to the contrary that if the content of the memory-train is clear, coherent, apparently stable, vivid, cannot be willed away or replaced, and if there is no apparent or no strong reason to doubt it, one is warranted in accepting it. This principle does not dispose of the logical possibility of error but neither does it appeal to bodily identity, as the example of the cobbler's friends' reaction to the blind, deaf and dumb 'cobbler' shows. (Or would objectors to disembodied identity claim that the modification of the puzzle story even to that extent renders it unintelligible? This would be difficult to sustain if the coherence of the original puzzle story is admitted.) And as is widely acknowledged, logical possibility of error need not preclude absolute certainty. Moreover the principle does provide criteria for distinguishing true memories from false. The criteria are doubtless imperfect for distinguishing true memories from false within a given memory train but they seem reasonable when applied to the personal identity disclosed by means of the memory-train as a whole. That is to say, they would be unreliable (though not useless) guides as to whether I did this rather than that but reliable in confirming that whichever was done I was the person who did it; 'reliable' not in the sense that they prove the validity of a deductive inference regarding identity on the basis of memory-'I have a vivid, irreplaceable ... etc. memory of doing this or that but I cannot tell which' does not entail 'I did this or that'-but in the sense that given the conditions specified one would be warranted in accepting the validity of the deduction. It is arguable that if the deepest root of our instinctive preference for the bodily transfer interpretation over the retrocognition theory interpretation were uncovered it would be found to consist of this principle. In any event the preference may justifiably claim by virtue of the principle to be philoso phically reputable even if not logically inviolable. But it may prove to be</page><page sequence="5">REFERRING TO GOD 71 both; for it would seem to be a necessary condition of applying the bodily criterion that one should first of all rely on one's memory. One cannot determine one's own or anyone else's physical presence at past events, whether a decade or a minute ago or whatever, without using one's memory to affirm that the conclusion 'x was/was not there' is being made by the same person who began the investigation, however long or short, namely oneself. Penelhum argues that 'we are dependent on our memories in not being able to carry through any cognitive procedure whatever without using them. This, however, does not show that when engaged in the cognitive procedure of determining who someone is we cannot, at least in theory, dispense with the memory-claims of the person himself, and it is this that we would need to prove to show that there is parity of dependence between the two standards'.' Clearly however we cannot dispense with our own memory-claims since we are, as Penelhum admits, dependent on our memories. His argument is plausible only to the extent that it is possible at least in theory to dispense with the memory-claims of any other person whose identity is being estab lished. With regard to one's own identity therefore memory is logically prior to bodily identity, though the latter may be absolutely crucial, for example in cases of split or multiple personality, or practically speaking highly serviceable in the normal pursuits of embodied life on earth. It may be added that acceptance of the principle that vivid, irreplaceable . etc., memory-trains are worthy of credence overcomes the objection that a 'survivor' might be a replica of a supposed human predecessor rather than personally identical with him. In this respect post-mortem survival does not differ in principle from personal continuance on earth, for otherwise we should believe that the persons we are in any given moment are the virtual replicas of the persons we seem to remember having been in preceding moments. Although this atomic self theory seems sensible to Whiteheadians and some others it should be rejected on the grounds that it overpopulates the word with entities and takes us back to Old Testament notions of responsibility according to which it is right to visit the sins of the fathers on the sons. Unless there is compelling reason to suppose that one is not per sonally identical with the personal predecessors one seems to remember having been, one should accept that one is. It may be urged then that circumstances of disembodiment are con ceivable in which memory could be a sufficient criterion of personal identity. Not only in the original puzzle story but also in the modified version, even if modified to exclude a body altogether, the prince-mind would be justified in taking itself to be the continuing prince, or as it might be put, the con tinuing essential prince-person. The position argued for hitherto however is the sufficiency in principle of present disembodied memory of past embodied existence-disembodied memory either 'in' this world or another 1 Terence Penelhum, Survival and Disembodied Existence, p. 67.</page><page sequence="6">72 JOHN J. SHEPHERD or in none except that constituted by memory itself. In such a case the relevance of past bodily evidence would not be eliminated, for the dis embodied memory-train would include memories of past embodied states and these would need to form a pattern so that one would claim to remember bodily identity in the past. This would not entail however the application of the criterion of bodily identity on a par with that of memory and impugning its essential sufficiency, for it would apply to the past or indeed a part of the past only. Claims to continuing personal identity would depend on memory alone. This essential sufficiency in principle may be illustrated by taking one further step and conceiving memories entirely exclusive of physical reference. Examples might be memories of thoughts or tunes, including perhaps in the latter case memories of having composed them. Thus it seems possible to develop a coherent albeit rather thin concept of a disembodied memory train disclosing to the rememberer his identity as a personal continuant. Nor indeed should this be altogether astonishing. When it comes to the core experience of being a person, that essentially non-objectifiable sub jectivity referred to as the systematic elusiveness of 'I', reference to cor poreality may apparently be totally suspended introspectively even as things are in the world, without bodily transfer of a far-fetched kind. The result, granted, is a slippery mystery. One does not, so to speak, know where one is as one does with a relatively clear-cut reference to one's body; but this mystery is more important than the practically speaking necessary but necessarily crude referential clarity available to us as embodied beings. It does not seem incoherent to suppose that this lived subjectivity harbours the essence of personal identity, a view hospitable indeed to the conceivability of disembodied personal existence. But if it harbours it it also conceals it-'systematic elusiveness'. This can be seen too from the fact that, when it comes to personal identity alone as opposed to knowledge of personal identity, not only bodily identity but also memory can be dispensed with as necessary conditions of personal identity. Just as it is possible to conceive personal identity without bodily identity so it seems posible to conceive a person existing incorporeally in eternal un knowable dreamless sleep or unconsciousness (though this is not strictly relevant to the concept of God in question here). Neither memory nor bodily continuity, individually or jointly, compose that essential relation con stitutive of personal identity. Neither is a logically necessary or a logically sufficient condition of personal identity, though in the world as it is they may jointly be both necessary and sufficient from a practical point of view. Be that as it may, returning now to the concept of the divine person in question the conditions specified regarding the reliability of memory as a criterion of personal identity are not difficult to introduce into the notion of a conscious creator. Indeed they seem to be implied already, for the cosmos</page><page sequence="7">REFERRING TO GOD 73 does not suggest that it is the product of a creator who has difficulty in remembering what has gone before. Thus the problem of incorporeal identity appears soluble with regard to the kind of deity that is relevant here. More over it has proved unnecessary to adopt C. Hartshorne's view that God is compelled to create some world or other-he could exist in eternal isolation; though since the cosmos does exist it is clearly open to him to use it referen tially in ways analogous to those in which we refer to our bodies and their varying relations (cf. 'during the war....' and 'during the first ice-age. . .'). Turning to the related problems of incorporeal character and incorporeal action, which may be discussed more briefly, it is necessary to distinguish divine character as allegedly displayed towards us in the world and divine character as allegedly displayed towards us in a putative afterlife; similarly with divine action. The nature of the cosmos can be used to indicate the character of a putative deity. Thus it may be urged that his loving character is displayed in the fact that the cosmos he sustains is beautiful and morally acceptable as a place for personal development (including, but not restricted to, moral develop ment). It is displayed further (so it may be maintained, whether correctly or not is here irrelevant) in the fact that he reveals himself; and reveals himself focally in Jesus and his message of redemptive love. Yet these are allegedly divine actions, so the first of the two problems develops into the second. For Edwards and Nielsen 'disembodied action' is meaningless. But consider the not uncommon human experience of creating and sustaining mental images, perhaps a group of people conversing. There appears to be nothing inherently corporeal in such mental imaging and if the previous defence of disembodied identity is correct this appearance is not deceptive. The act of sustaining mental images requires no bodily reference (other than to the bodies appear ing in the images). Its nature is mysterious but that it occurs is indubitable, and consequently it seems perfectly intelligible to posit analogous action, this time explicitly incorporeal, on the part of a cosmos-sustaining deity. The nature of the analogous action is, as far as can be judged by relating the notions of incorporeal identity and human imaging, neither self-evidently contradictory nor covertly nonsensical. And similarly with divine revelatory action. The nature of this is perhaps even more mysterious but it does not seem a self-contradictory notion like 'square circle' where the two terms definitionally exclude each other; and perhaps here alleged medium possession may provide some analogy, not in the sense that God would 'take over' a personality but in the sense that he might minutely affect it in a manner analogous to medium possession-though here the analogue is itself notoriously obscure. It may be added that the intelligibility of talk of disembodied action in the cosmos is further supported by the case of talk about poltergeists. Edwards</page><page sequence="8">74 JOHN J. SHEPHERD and Nielsen deny this, urging that poltergeist-talk is intelligible only either if it refers to shadowy human-like beings with insubstantial bodies, or else is reducible to talk about strange and at present incomprehensible occur rences such as mysteriously flying crockery. According to Nielsen, Evans, who suggests this analogy, 'can only be as confident as he is that poltergeist talk is intelligible because he does not distinguish between these different ways of construing such talk'.' Yet this is grossly question-begging. It is open to Evans to retort that he fully appreciates the distinction but does not regard it as exhaustive. The notion that the crockery flies by the agency of a non-corporeal being is one which he simply does, as far as he can tell and despite everything that critics like Edwards and Nielsen say, understand. The nature of the agency is a mystery but not the notion that some mysterious agency or efficacy links certain startling physical occurrences and putative disembodied experiences of intending to cause precisely these occurrences. Moreover this kind of example may be elaborated, as by H. Meynell who suggests the possibility of a sheet of paper being observed to move into a typewriter and a message typed on it, despite the failure of all empirical tests even to begin to account for this. The phenomenon is rendered intel ligible if we suppose that a disembodied spirit is bent on communicating with us, even though the nature of the agency involved remains obscure.2 Nielsen contends that 'when we carefully reflect on ... the depth grammar of the [our] language, we will come to see that "disembodied love" or "bodiless action" like . . . "wife without husband" is an unintelligible collocation of words. This claim rests on no general theory of language; it is not more dependent on neo-behaviourist or materialist conceptions than on verificationist ones. Rather, it turns on the kind of understanding we should gain by careful attention to our actual use of words in a particular area.'3 The preceding remarks suggest however that it is Nielsen who might benefit from further reflection on our actual use of words in a particular area which, although not commonplace (it belongs to the province of psychical research), gives rise in some people to the stubborn but reflective conviction that it is rendered understandable by this use, which includes references to dis embodied action. The attributes of justice and goodness may be said to be covered by that of love. They are exhibited in the continuous action of creation (assuming, that is, that the problem of evil does not seem insuperable); it is not necessary moreover to expect specific intrusive acts of justice of the once fashionable miraculous type. In so far as the divine goodness is not exhaustively describ able in terms of creation and revelation it is susceptible of analysis in terms 1 Nielsen, Contemporary Critiques, pp. I25-6. Cf. Donald Evans, 'Commentary on Paul Edwards' Paper', in The Idea of God, eds. Madden, Handy Farber, p. 84. 2 Hugo Meynell, God and the World: The Coherence of Christian Theism (London, I97I), p. 120. Cf. Penelhumn, op. cit., chapter 3. 3 Nielsen, ibid., pp. II9-20.</page><page sequence="9">REFERRING TO GOD 75 of dispositions and mental attitudes which do not require bodily reference as the discussion of incorporeal identity should have made clear. As for omniscience, the mode of knowledge of the cosmos is obscure but some analogy does seem possible even here-perhaps the mind of a superb mathematical physicist cum aesthete. Again the essential point is that although the mode of knowledge is obscure it does not seem unintelligible to claim that it may occur and that the cosmic knower should be incorporeal. These remarks are necessarily brief and inconclusive for speculation as to the manner of various forms of divine action cannot inspire great confidence. On the other hand it does not seem nonsensical to claim that these various forms may occur, and for the basic action of sustaining the cosmos which in turn is interpreted as an action of love there is a reasonably illuminating analogue. The inconclusiveness of the remarks will receive further attention later. There remain the problems of divine character and action in the context of an after-life. That Christian belief necessarily involves reference to an after-life is disputable (cf. process theology) but the problem of evil does seem intractable without it; not that pain suffered can be unsuffered, but if sufferers could reach a point from which they looked back and said that it had been worthwhile the problem of pain would surely diminish in com parison with its immensity if a supposedly loving God knows that countless numbers have perished and will perish with anything but this affirmation on their lips or in their hearts. In any event, if it be included, the question arises whether survival would occur incorporeally or in some kind of body. Now it has been argued above that incorporeal existence is conceivable but no'thing said hitherto justifies the further claim that disembodied persons could recognise each other. Identification in that sense may require bodies of some kind. If this be granted it does not follow however that the bodies must be physical. They must be a recognisably person-disclosing something but more than that need not be specified either concerning the mode of recognition or that of disclosure or the nature of the medium. There might perhaps be analogies with telepathy, this being taken then as a mode of knowledge essentially independent of physical bodies but not of bodies per se. If direct awareness of the contents of other minds were possible then these contents might count as features of 'mental bodies'. This is fanciful but does not appear self-contradictory or vacuous. Our physical bodies are indeed often felt as obstacles to full expression of our mental states even when we are fairly successful in communicating with and relating to people, hence suspension of that mode of communication and relation might make room for a more successful mode of spiritual communication appropriate to our (apparently or putatively) essential natures as nonmaterial subjects. According to Edwards telepathic communications are 'completely beside</page><page sequence="10">76 JOHN J. SHEPHERD the point since they are communications between living, embodied organisms. If somebody claimed to know on the basis of telepathy that Mao-tse-tung is angry now this is perfectly intelligible but Mao-tse-tung is not a disembodied spirit. However, if he maintained that he telepathically knew Stalin to be angry, I would be unable to attach any meaning to his statement; and only the latter could serve as a model for the believer in a bodiless deity.'" Yet the difficulty in attaching meaning to the statement about Stalin does not seem insuperable. What would it be like to know telepathically that Stalin is angry now? It would be necessary to know telepathically (that is a mystery but it is not the focus of Edwards' attack) that 'somewhere' there were mental experiences of anger whose subject was aware of himself as having been Stalin on earth. Clearly therefore such knowledge-claims presuppose the possibility of nonmaterial survival-a possibility not granted by Edwards though he does advocate a distinction between mental and bodily events. Given the possibility of disembodied survival however the only difference between the Stalin case and the Mao-tse-tung case is that in the latter the feelings are located 'in' a living body which in turn is located in the world, and in the former they are located 'somewhere, I know not where'; but there seems no reason why this difference should create difficulties; and it would be an unimportant contingent accretion to the telepathic knowledge of Stalin if the telepathist were either focally or subsidiarily aware of the relevant moustached Georgian face. Of course if post-mortem forms of communication in some sense analogous to telepathy be admitted and minds given the status of some kind of 'body' it is unnecessary to make God an exception-his 'corporeality' in this extended sense is inocuous. The arguments in support of his disembodied existence would then be taken as supporting his nonmaterial existence rather than his incorporeality. It may be added that if the arguments fail it is necessary to adopt the view that God must create some world or other which then acts referentially as his body. The possibility of post-mortem existence may then perhaps be preserved only by having resurrection replica bodies as suggested by J. Hick. Nevertheless it may be that telepathy should prove an unsatisfactory analogue. Yet even if we were left virtually completely in the dark as to the nature of post-mortem intersubjective intercourse, including the relations between God and other selves, we should not be justified in ruling out its very possibility. It is sad to escape the charge of being woolly-headed by becoming narrow-minded, as would surely be the case here, for the mysterious powers encountered at the natural human level should engender a charitable view of possibilities in a putative spiritual realm. The problems of divine character and action in the context of an after-life may be treated as special instances of problems arising in connection with a 1 Edwards, 'Reply to Commentators', in The Idea of God, p. 95.</page><page sequence="11">REFERRING TO GOD 77 post-mortem social existence and similarly soluble in principle; or not. The view taken here is that they are. I have argued then that it is possible to attach sense to the notions of incorporeal identity, character and action; though the extent to which a discussion like this can help others to attach sense to these notions must vary considerably from one person to another. After all, understanding permits of degrees-a point which will be taken up again shortly. A distinction has appeared in the preceding discussion which needs to be underlined. It is the distinction between identification of incorporeal existence in the sense of picking out in thought rather than in reality and identification in the sense of picking out in reality. It is not altogether clear that this distinction is always maintained in discussions of factual intelligibi lity, cf. 'it has got to be shown how what is specified in our definition of the word God could, in principle, be identified', and 'the moment one invokes this condition of immateriality one puts an absolute ban on any possible identification of God'.' Yet the distinction is crucial, as the different treat ment accorded the problem of incorporeal identity and the problem of incorporeal social intercourse respectively above indicates. The fact that we are at present incapable of picking out God directly in reality as an individual or even of specifying particular observables which must count (or perhaps in principle would have to count) as indicating his presence does not entail that it is nonsense to speak either of his presence or of his existence as an individual, and neither does it entail that it isfactual nonsense to speak thus. In short it is a mistake to link 'understanding the meaning of x' too closely with 'the method of establishing the truth or falsity of x'. This close linkage is explicitly defended by Nielsen on the grounds that to understand the meaning of x, where x is a sentence purportedly used to state a fact, we must know what conceivably could count for the truth or falsity of x. For x to havefactual meaning, x must have truth conditions. If we do not know what these truth conditions are, x is meaningless to us, and that God might know what they are does not make x an intelligible bit of human discourse. It still remains a factually meaningless English expression'.2 The mistake here springs from a failure to contextualise the truth condi tions. It is perfectly true that in order for a statement to have factual meaning we must be able to indicate what states of affairs would count for or against the statement-on this critics like Nielsen and Flew are correct. What is not true is that in order for the statement to have factual meaning for us these states of affairs must be susceptible of apprehension, even in principle, still less of observation, by us-on this critics like Nielsen and Flew are quite mistaken. Admittedly when it comes to the warrant for accepting a pur I Flew, op. Cit., 2.20.

SHEPHERD portedly factual statement as true, requests for empirical or near-empirical evidence are in order; but the fact that such evidence is ambiguous does not, as Nielsen urges, render the claim that God exists void of factual con tent.' For example it may be specified that the occurence of cosmic experi ences of a certain kind would count for the statement 'God exists'; but they would be apprehended (we may suppose) by the cosmic self alone, not by us; yet our ignorance of whether these truth conditions obtain does not evacuate the claim 'God exists' of factual meaning. This is implicit in the defence of incorporeal identity above and is independently plausible anyway. While it is true then that an alleged statement which is compatible with any and every state of affairs is factually meaningless it is not true that an alleged statement which is compatible with any and every state of affairs capable (in principle) of being apprehended by us is factually meaningless. Thus it is unnecessary to attempt to provide basic theistic statements with factual meaning retrospectively by means of eschatological verification. Their factual meaning is assured if they exclude some state of affairs or other, whether physical, mental or transcendent-provided these states of affairs may be described or indicated. However in this last respect it would be sufficient for example to specify that unconscious cosmic experiences occur for the claim 'God exists' (where the deity is an idiosyncratic entity) to be factually meaningful. Thus it is not even the case that the states of affairs counting for an allegedly factual statement must be capable of being apprehended, if not by us humans, then by someone or other. The link between 'understanding the meaning of x' and 'the method of establishing the truth or falsity or x' is then in any event decisively weaker than claimed by Nielsen; and circumstances are conceivable in which it may be severed completely-an unconscious cosmic self could be completely unknowable. The conclusion warranted by the preceding discussion as a whole is that an empiricist criterion of factual intelligibility is both unnecessary and prejudicial to unfettered enquiry. We might also say that the discussion vindicates and in part illustrates the possibility of making a reasonably adequate reference to a transcendent God as logical subject. For to show that a basic existential statement like 'God exists' is factually meaningful is to show that there is, and/or to give, an individuating description of its intended referent; and this has been done in sketchy outline in the preceding discussion. But to give an individuating description of its intended referent is to refer to the particular which is the logical subject of the statement. Now to refer to a particular is to identify it in the sense of picking it out in thought. However it is necessary to distinguish between a speaker's sense 1 Nielsen, ibid., pp. 63-4. Nielsen's earlier emphasis, ibid., pp. 56-60, on empirical experience by us as a necessary condition of factual intelligibility is mistaken, as the immediately succeeding text above here indicates.</page><page sequence="13">REFERRING TO GOD 79 of 'identity' and a hearer's sense. A speaker may 'make an identifying reference to' a particular yet his hearer may be unable to identify the particular on the basis of the identifying reference. Only if he does so should the speaker be said to 'identify' the particular.' Now to make a reasonably adequate reference to a logical subject is, hopefully, not just to make an identifying reference to a particular but also to identify that particular. Yet the gap between making an identifying reference and identifying cannot be bridged by purely logical means. The hearer has to 'see' the point of the identifyring reference. Perhaps he has to wait for and work for the penny to drop; but perhaps it obstinately refuses to drop, in which case the fault may lie either with the hearer or else with the speaker-the identifying reference may be improper in some way. Then the hearer has to ask for further help and the speaker must try to elucidate his identifying reference. But in such a case since in the end, failing the uncovering of a downright logical blunder, if there is to be agreement it must be a matter of the penny dropping, there is scope for endless disagreement, for the penny may not drop. Moreover it should occasion neither surprise nor concern if at times the debate should proceed at the level of: 'But that is intelligible'-'It's not'-'It is, think about it again'-'I just can't see that it is'-'But I can attach sense to it'-'I just don't see how you can". That is part of the logic of the situation; though needless to say there is scope too for more respectable philosophical argu mentation. If the preceding discussion is so far correct that theists are not committing logical howlers in speaking of an incorporeal God it would appear that the most damaging charge to bring against theists in this respect is not that basic theistic assertions are factually meaningless but that they are in adequately factually meaningful or that it is impossible to make a reasonably adequate reference to their logical subject. The debate may then salutarily become explicitly rather inconclusive (since the criteria of adequacy cannot be clear-cut) in place of the unsuccessful knock-down approach adopted by many critics hitherto. The preceding discussion is intended however as a vindication of the basic theistic claim that a reasonably adequate reference to God is possible. I presuppose, with Edwards for example, that mental events are not identical with physical events in the brain or nervous system, though in order to refer to God it is necessary to presuppose only that the distinction between mental and physical events is intelligible. I presuppose too that despite objections raised by critics like Hartshorne there is no incoherence in speaking of the personal identity of a personal continuant.2 Yet if his atomic 1 This is taken from P.

Hartshorne, 'Strict and Genetic Identity: An Illustration of the Relations of Logic to Metaphysics', in P. Henle, H. Kallen, and S. Langer, eds., Structure, Method and Meaning: Essays in Honor of Henry M. Scheffer (New York, I95I).</page><page sequence="14">80 JOHN J. SHEPHERD theory of the person were to be preferred, the only effect on the present argument would be to make the divine person referred to a personally ordered society of entities analogous to human persons. It would still be possible to refer to God, and a person holding such a view of human persons would presumably take no offence at the analogous notion of the divine person. More contentiously for Christian theists, the argument seems to presuppose divine temporality. I am not sure that it is possible to make a significant reference to a totally timeless deity who loves and acts, or that it is necessary, even from a Christian viewpoint, to try and do so. Be that as it may, in the limited space here available I have been concerned only to show that the enterprise of referring to God, in a doctrinally relatively unramified sense of 'God' which may be developed in different ways, can get off the ground despite contemporary empiricist criticism.</page></plain_text>
