Two men inside the elephant coordinate their steps skillfully to make the elephant "dance." Njovu, along with other zoomorphic masks such as mkango (lion) and kasiya maliro (antelope) represent important ancestral spirit forces in the Gule wa Mkulu (big dance) performing tradition of the all-male Nyau cult among the Chewa people of South Eastern Africa. The animal masks represent a reenactment of a prelapsarian innocent past when men, animals, and god lived in harmony-a time before humans invented fire and caused a forest to burn creating animosity between them. Humans are represented by satirical anthropomorphic masks asso- ciated with such physical or social diseases as drunkenness and syphilis. The forest fire is represented by the ritual burning of the animal con- structs after a week of licentious Gule wa Mkulu performances, thus pre- paring the way for a return to "normality." The Gule wa Mkulu performance can be traced back (for example, through cave paintings) to at least the I5th century. It functioned at the economic, political, religious, and social levels to mediate the ideology of the agricultural, communalistic Chewa peoples, one of the dominant eth- nic groups found in what is now Malawi and parts of Zambia and Mo- zambique. In the precolonial period (from the i th to early Igth century), the peoples of what is now Malawi were grouped in a series of culturally linked petty states, which sometimes united to make more powerful kingdoms, such as the Kingdom of Kalonga in the I7th century. The people were rich in a variety of highly functional performing arts, not only masked performances, but also spirit possession dances (such as Vimbuza of the Tumbuka people), initiation ceremonies (such asJando of the Yao people) or war dances (such as Ingoma of the Ngoni people). Scarcely any area of political, religious, or social life was neglected by the performing arts-whether dances, mimes, games, rituals, narratives, or dramatized songs. The cultural wealth of the Malawi peoples was severely effected in the Igth century by Portuguese and British imperialism and by the slave trade operating from Zanzibar. The imposition of formal colonialism by Britain in the i89os had a particularly strong impact on Malawian per- forming arts. The British administrators and missionaries made undis- guised assaults on Malawian culture. For example, several attempts were</page><page sequence="2">116 David Kerr 1. Southern Africa.

The Nyau cult leaders retaliated by in- corporating stereotypes of colonial political and religious figures into the satire of the anthropomorphic masking tradition (Linden and Schofeleers I972). Most of the other performing arts also made adaptations in re- sponse to colonialism. Another development was the creation of syncretic performing arts, synthesizing indigenous traditions of organization and culture with im- ported colonial traditions. The militaristic mimes of Beni, Mganda, and Malipenga, which adapted Western military uniforms and marching steps to an indigenous choreographic aesthetic, are the best examples of such syncretisms. The cross-cultural competitive organizational skills involved in these dance clubs helped give rural Malawian societies the confidence to meet colonialism on its own terms-an essential element of the con- sciousness-raising that preceded the formal struggle for independence. The British also introduced some of their own performing traditions in Malawi. The white enclaves of Zomba, Blantyre, and Mulanje developed sports clubs that fostered a "theatre of nostalgia" exclusively for whites, reproducing in an archaically naturalistic mode, on small proscenium stages, the farces and musical comedy hits of the London West End. Pa-</page><page sequence="3">Theatre in Malawi I17 tronizingly didactic sketches in local languages were also encouraged. They were staged in community halls, broadcast on the radio, or filmed (silent, with a local-language running commentary) for mobile cinemas, in an effort to "educate the natives" on such topics as modern farming techniques, taxation, post office savings, and road safety. Propaganda of a more generalized kind was associated with the conspicuous pomp of Em- pire Day celebrations, which included marches, songs, dances, and dis- plays of imperial might. Presentation of traditional English drama for Malawians was restricted to the very few secondary schools set up by the British, where the annual Shakespeare production offered a ritual-like in- duction into the elitist culture of Europe. When Malawi achieved independence in I964, the diverse performing traditions-both indigenous and imposed-continued to interact dialecti- cally and helped to mediate some of the important transformations taking place in the economic, social, and political domains. The modern state of Malawi is a fairly small, narrow, and mountainous country about Iooo kilometers long, at the southern end of the Great Rift Valley in southeastern Africa. Its neighbors are Tanzania to the north, Zambia to the west, and Mozambique to the south and east. The major towns of Blantyre, Zomba, Lilongwe, and Mzuzu are fairly small; most of the population of six-and-a-half million live in the rural areas. The economy is agrarian, with most people making a living from subsistence farming, fishing (Malawi has several lakes including the 600-kilometer long Lake Malawi), or, increasingly, by working as laborers or tenant farmers on tea, sugar, and tobacco estates. Migrant labor in South Africa provides another outlet. Although agricultural policies in Malawi have been relatively successful-compared with most of Africa-the popula- tion is extremely poor, with high rates of illiteracy and disease. Politically it is a very conservative, one-party state, governed autocratically by the life-term president, Kamuzu Banda, through the Malawi Congress Party. Internally, the population is controlled by a complex political machin- ery and some remarkable social engineering in which politicized neotradi- tional dance plays an important part. Precolonial and syncretic dances 2. "Simon" mask (imitat- ing a European) in a Gule wa Mkulu performance at Tembuna village in Zam- bia, close to the border of iii'x11 Malawi.

More obvious still has been the creation of specialized dances for wom- en, very loosely based on indigenous women's dances such as Chimtali, Chitelele, Mwinoghe, and Chioda. Although these dances are referred to in the media as "traditional," they have been adapted to function as quasi- fascist praises of the president, making such terms as populist or neotradi- tional more accurate. The dances are performed by the League of Malawi Women, one of the major power bases of the state's hegemony. The president has given these women the sentimental title of mbumba. In the matrilineal kinship system of the Central Region's Chewa, mbumba means sister(s) who needs to be married off and protected afterward by an older male relative, known as nkhoswe. The president makes much use of the notion that he is "nkhoswe number one," protecting the interests of all the women in Malawi-his mbumba. The women's dances are rein- forced by regional rivalry, subtle threats, gift incentives for prominent dancers, and free transport (open lorry) facilities. When performed in one of the large urban stadiums, such as Kamuzu stadium in Blantyre, the colorful and superbly synchronized, undulating mass of women singing adulatory songs, creates a remarkable impression of group hysteria, par- ticularly when the president descends like a god to dance among them or leaves the stadium in a raised open vehicle, surrounded by the chanting, swaying throngs. The extent to which neotraditional dances (Gule wa Chipani) have been incorporated into the most prominent arenas of the political hegemony, 3.

President Banda dances with his mbumba at San- /t~~~ s S (Photo courtesy of David Kerr) has had an impact on the relationship between the indigenous performing traditions and the newly emergent tradition of the literary "art theatre." As in all other African countries, though perhaps somewhat later than most, Malawi developed a tradition of indigenous literary drama. Its rise has been most closely associated with the Travelling Theatre of Chancel- lor College, the University of Malawi's main constituent college. The Travelling Theatre started in 1969 with an adaptation in English of Brecht's The Caucasian Chalk Circle. Early productions were either adap- tations of European classics or works by African playwrights, such as Wole Soyinka, John Pepper Clark, or Obotunde Ijimire, all from Nigeria. Before long, however, a generation of young Malawian playwrights- including James N'gombe, Chris Kamlongera, Innocent Banda, and Steve Chimombo-had emerged, writing plays in English. These were performed by the Travelling Theatre, and several were published in the anthology Nine Malawian Plays (Gibbs, I976). They also fed a growing literary theatre movement in the secondary schools, where the British- Council-sponsored Association for the Teaching of English in Malawi organized an annual drama competition in the schools for plays in English. From the outset there was a rather uneasy relationship between indig- enous performing traditions and the new literary drama. The plays were in English, mostly tailored to a forty-five-minute competition format, and performed on indoor proscenium stages before a seated, bourgeois urban audience. This meant that it was difficult to integrate the indig- enous performance aesthetic-in-the-round, open-air, participatory per- formances of indeterminate length. Nevertheless, there was a strong feeling of cultural nationalism in emergent Malawian playwrights which encouraged them to explore Malawian oral and performing arts traditions. These playwrights adapted Malawian oral narratives (N'gombe's The Banana Tree, 1974 and The Beauty of Dawn, 1975), by setting plays in a precolonial period (Kamlon- gera's Chauta's Wrath, 1978), or by weaving literal translations of tradi- tional riddles and proverbs into a modern text (Kamlongera's Graveyards, I975).</page><page sequence="6">I20 David Kerr 5. A scene from Wachiona Ndani? by Steve Chi- mombo, performed by the Travelling Theatre at Chi- runga Open Air Theatre, Zomba. (Photo courtesy of David Kerr) The most common technique was to graft indigenous dances into the performance, whether in a relatively direct quotation of a village dance (such as some of the dances in Chauta's Wrath), or with a greater degree of stylization (as in Dunduzu ChisizaJr.'s The Deceased's Attack, I983). It has been a particularly common technique, to the point of cliche, in plays put on at the schools' drama festivals. The artificiality of the proscenium stage, however, was a constant im- pediment to the successful integration of indigenous dance with literary dramas in English. To overcome that problem, staff and students at Chancellor College in Zomba in 1975 constructed an open-air, thrust stage with raked seating built into a natural slope and shaded by two trees. Since performances at the ungated Chirunga Theatre were necessar- ily free of charge, and because its capacity was over a thousand, it devel- oped into an important venue for the academic community as well as for peasants and workers from nearby compounds and villages. The most ambitious production at the Chirunga Theatre was The Rain- maker by Steve Chimombo (1976), a one-and-a-half-hour verse epic in</page><page sequence="7">Theatre in Malawi I2I English about the martyrdom of Mbona, the 17th-century founder of the Mbona rain cult. The play incorporated many indigenous dances, includ- ing a performance of Gule wa Mkulu by a real Nyau cult sect, who set up their traditional sacred changing hut (liunde) just off the campus. Al- though the production was spectacular, attracting much attention and critical comment, the integration of the indigenous performance into the more arcanely literary text was problematic. At one performance the au- dience had to wait for nearly an hour in the middle of the play, while the Nyau members, who for religious reasons could not be harried by the stage manager, prepared for their entrance. The taboos preventing wom- en from approaching the carefully guarded sacred masks made traveling with the mixed cast almost impossible. After The Rainmaker, interest in indigenous dance continued in some productions, but there was also an increasing interest in dialog plays with more modern themes. One reason for this was that the mid-'7os saw a vast growth in the politicized Gule wa Chipani (neo-traditional dances) described above. Dance in nonpolitical contexts was thus discouraged as producers feared they might commit choreographic "sacrilege" by unin- tentionally quoting newly valorized political dances. Another very important constraint on English-language literary plays was the Censorship Board. The Censorship Control of Entertainments Act of 1968 established a Censorship Board, which by I972 began to impose draconian measures on films, plays, books, and magazines. Un- der the act, "stage play" included any "tragedy, comedy, play, opera, farce, revue, variety, burlesque, interlude, melodrama, pantomime, dia- logue, prologue, epilogue or any other dramatic entertainment or part thereof" (quoted in Gibbs I985:19). The act covered poems, lectures, vi- sual arts, and song lyrics. It suppressed any frank portrayal or discussion of sexual, religious, or political matters. Plays have frequently been cut totally rejected, including international plays like Soyinka's Giants (1984), Adrian Mitchell's Man Friday (1972), and John Ruganda's The Burdens (1970), and Malawian scripts which have never been produced, such as Garton Sandifolo's The Two Paupers (1983). Even after the script has been approved, most productions have to be viewed by members of the Cen- sorship Board during dress rehearsal. Censorship and the suppression of criticism by the ever-vigilant state machinery forced all cultural activities to take a defensive stance; any in- cipient political expression was disguised under a heavy mask of allegory or symbolism. Often this developed into a game of nerves whereby Uni- versity artists attempted critiques of the regime by employing codes which would be too obscure for Party vigilantes and the Censorship Board, decipherable only by the educated cognoscenti. This process was useful in keeping open channels of communication and provided the cli- mate for some eloquent and moving writing, particularly of verse. All the same, the emphasis on coded allegory led to a kind of elitism whereby intellectuals savored their own wit and subtlety as oases of reason amid the deserts of cultural repression. A good example of coded drama from the mid-'7os is Innocent Banda's short absurdist parable Cracks. This play is about a well-educated lunatic, recently released from the mental hospital, who survives by begging on behalf of a rich patron. The parasitic patron uses the threat of authority figures to keep the lunatic under control: "If you think, just because you have been to college, you can do anything, just wait till I get the police on you" (Gibbs I976:I49). At the time of its production, the audience had</page><page sequence="8">I22 David Kerr 6-8. Community Theatre Workshop in July 1984 at Mbatamira Farm, Zomba. (Photos courtesy of David Kerr)</page><page sequence="9">Theatre in Malawi I23 no difficulty relating the play to the recent wave of arrests without trial of intellectuals. Fortunately for Malawian theatre a slight political "thaw" took place in 1979. The much less heavy-handed implementation of Censorship Board policies led to the "unbanning" of several plays, including Soyinka's Lion and theJewel (I959) and Kamlongera's Chauta's Wrath. The opaque coding which had encouraged a kind of English-language coterie drama in the 70s, gave way to an interest in more openly socially-committed drama. A series of plays by Athol Fugard produced in I979-80-Sizwe Bansi is Dead (1972), The Blood Knot (1961), and The Island (1974)-were particu- larly influential in opening up the Malawian stage to contemporary inter- national politics. Even more important, however, was the emergence of drama in local languages. The impetus behind this came from what is usually called the "Theatre for Development" movement. Theatre practitioners and devel- opment agencies in countries like Botswana, Zambia, Swaziland, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria in the late '70s became interested in promoting a pop- ular participatory theatre in which intellectuals and peasants together cre- ated African-language plays through improvisation. Influenced by this movement, the University Travelling Theatre held a Theatre for Devel- opment workshop in 1981 at Mbalachanda Rural Growth Centre in a remote part of Malawi's Northern Region (Kamlongera 1982). The workshop created several plays about health, literacy, and agricultural problems in a mixture of the Malawian languages Chichewa and Chitumbuka. After the workshop, the most popular play, Mchira wa Mtondori (a do- mestic comedy about a love potion which was a rough recasting of Enoch Timpunza-Mvula's English-language play The Lizard's Tail, 1975) was translated yet again in Chichewa, Malawi's dominant language. This ver- sion, Mchira wa Buluzi, played to packed theatres throughout the nation. Almost overnight, Chichewa drama sprang up everywhere. Groups such as Kuka Players, Kwathu Theatre Arts Group, Black Lass, Pamodzi The- atre, Revelation Theatre, and Lonjezo Travelling Theatre were estab- lished. They were not usually created by intellectuals, but by workers or groups of unemployed dropouts. Some of the Chichewa groups did not 9.

Chimbudzi, a sketch performed with the Liwonde Primary Health Care Unit at the Mwima Trading Centre near Liwonde. (Photos courtesy of David Kerr) survive very long, but others, such as Kawthu and Lonjezo, have become extremely popular and attract huge urban audiences to their semi-impro- vised, didactic farces reflecting class tensions in society. Madzi Akatayika (If the Water Spills) by Kwathu Theatre Arts Group is a good example of popular Chichewa urban theatre. It tells of a fairly rich man, Mayaniko, who mistreats both his wife Esnati and a domestic ser- vant, Alifeyo. Eventually he dismisses both from his household so that he can marry a younger woman, Joseline. Alefeyo and Esnati marry and prosper, whereas Mayaniko and Joseline become poor. In the end, Ale- feyo and Esnati employ Mayaniko and Joseline as domestic servants in a comeuppance terribly satisfying to popular audiences. The moral concern for the stability of marriage is the underlying concern, as in many Chichewa plays. Madzi Akatayika was adapted from a novel of the same title by Willie Zingani (1984). Most Chichewa plays, however, are created collectively through improvisation. The plays are sometimes performed as an after- noon's or evening's entertainment by one drama group, but often they are set within the program of a "Variety Show"-a vaudeville mixture of pop music, break dancing, traditional dance, poetry reading, standup comedy, and conjuring. Theatrically, the Chichewa plays normally use a proscenium stage, a broadly exaggerated acting style, a story line bor- rowed from indigenous popular narrative and adapted to a modern urban environment, a heavy emphasis on comic dialog and mime, and a moral tone reinforcing traditional kinship and community values. By contrast, the rural-based Theatre for Development movement has been closely associated with the University, most recently in a campaign where intellectual theatre cadres have cooperated with villagers and Pri- mary Health educators from the Liwonde Agricultural Development Di- vision to use theatre as a consciousness-raising tool for the establishment of village health committees. Theatrically such performances are close to indigenous performing traditions in that they are held outdoors and in- the-round at the village bwalo (community space). There is a high degree of participation from the audience, not only in formal elements such as songs, but even in the structuring of the play-for example, by providing endings for unfinished texts. With such improvised, participatory drama</page><page sequence="11">Theatre in Malawi 125 there is inevitably a strong link between fantasy and reality, along the lines of Augusto Boal's use of drama to "rehearse" strategies of popular activism. This draws upon indigenous traditions of using the performing arts as vehicles for licensed protest about specific community abuses. The popularity of both urban and rural Malawi-language theatre has by no means killed English-language drama, which continues to flourish, with some plays mixing English and Malawian languages just as they are mixed in everyday usage. All the varieties of performing arts I have de- scribed-even the precolonial ones-survive, though transformed, along- side modern cultural forms. What this survey indicates is the extreme eclecticism of the Malawian performance styles. In the short period since independence, the perform- ing arts have become a major arena for exploring and creating tradi- tions-concrete manifestations of the submerged stresses and communal introspections as an emergent nation manufactures the complex machin- ery of new ideologies.
