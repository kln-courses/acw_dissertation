<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM CANOE TO CHURCH ON LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY ULAWA, SOLOMON ISLANDS Roger Neich Abstract. This study surveys the published literature on Ulawa bonito canoes to provide a context for the description of a shell-inlaid bonito canoe from Ulawa purchased by Auckland Museum in 1897. The symbolism of the canoe's shell inlay is explained on the basis of a contemporary letter written by Rev. Walter Ivens of the Melanesian Mission, leading to an understanding of the place of bonito fishing in Ulawan culture. Built by the people of Madoa village under the direction of Rev. Clement Marau, the canoe was sold to raise money for a corrugated iron roof on the Madoa Church then under construction. Contemporary accounts of the building of the Madoa Church provide an insight into the role of the Melanesian Mission in the conversion of Ulawa to Christianity and the commodification of Ulawan material culture. These records demonstrate the development of tourist art, especially model canoes and inlaid bowls, on Ulawa in the later decades of the nineteenth century. Questions of authenticity are discussed with regard to the role of the Melanesian Mission and its staff in the production of this bonito canoe and Ulawan tourist art. KEYWORDS: Bonito canoe; shell inlay; Christianity; Melanesian Mission; Ulawa; Solomon Islands. INTRODUCTION Among the extensive Pacific artefact collections in the Auckland Museum, a beautiful small bonito-fishing canoe from Madoa village on Ulawa in the Solomon Islands survives as mute evidence of changing times in turn-of-the-century Melanesia. This canoe is a product of those few years at the end of the nineteenth century when the process of conversion to Christianity on Ulawa was at its most intense. Another product of those years is the large church built at Madoa on Ulawa under the direction of the Rev. Clement Marau, a Melanesian Mission clergyman. The canoe and church are connected through the aspirations and activities of Clement Marau and his converts. This is also the period when much of the original fieldwork and language learning was being carried out by those missionaries such as Codrington, Fox and Ivens who later wrote the major ethnographies on which our knowledge of south-eastern Solomon Islands cultures are based. By their time, these cultures had already been drastically altered by European administrative, trading and missionary activities. Apart from this Auckland Museum canoe, very few nineteenth century Ulawa canoes are now left in the world, perhaps only the one in the British Museum (Haddon 1937:94; Mendana 1901:xxii) and another in the Maidstone Museum, Kent, England (Waite 1987:52). The Maidstone Museum canoe is a lisi type of larger canoe made for inter-island travel, not a bonito Rec. Auckland Mus. 37: 5-43 2001</page><page sequence="2">6 NEICH canoe. The British Museum canoe (registration number 1870.2-9.1) is a three or four-man bonito canoe. Consequently, this Auckland Museum bonito canoe is extremely important as a rare surviving example of a vanished craft for which the island of Ulawa was famous. Beyond its intrinsic importance as a historical artefact, this canoe is also an instructive example of the way objects pass through times and retain the social imprints of their passing. Since the publication of studies on colonial change in ethnic arts such as Graburns Ethnic and Tourist Arts of the Fourth World (19 76) and Thomas's Entangled Objects (1991), we have come to realise the greater time depth and the intensity of colonial intermeshing which has produced the artefacts collected through much of the nineteenth century. As Graburn (1999:345) has bluntly stated: We now realize that practically all the objects in our ethnographic collections were acquired in politically complex, multicultural colonial situations. Furthermore, we can state unequivocally that unless we include the sociopolitical context of production and exchange in our analyses we will have failed in our interpretation and understanding. For some purists, this situation of colonial complexity has called into question the authenticity of the artefacts produced under these conditions. However, as Graburn (1999:350 ff.) has made clear: Authenticity and genuineness were folk categories, measures by which people in certain historical or cultural situations judged cultural productions. Authenticity as a culturally constructed concept has important meanings for the consumers and, at least in the early stages of cross-cultural contact, it has little meaning for the producers. Judgements of authenticity have served as a device for maintaining power and stratification in colonial systems. But now, many indigenous groups have taken up the discourse of authenticity to enhance their positive self-image and to recover pride in their native identity. When champions of the so-called authentic artefact' imply that artefacts made in these intercultural situations are therefore non-authentic, it is beholden upon the art-historical analyst to realise and demonstrate that: ... the solution to defining the authenticity of an object circulating in the network of world art exchange lies not in the properties of the object itself but in the very process of collection, which inscribes, at the moment of acquisition, the character and qualities that are associated with the object in both individual and collective memories. In order to interpret such objects we must begin to unpack the baggage of transcultural encounter with which they travel and search for the meanings and memories stored inside. (Phillips and Steiner 1999:19) This analysis will reveal ramifications throughout Ulawan culture at a time of drastic change. The circumstances surrounding the construction and sale of this canoe and the building of the Madoa church constitute a particularly clear example of this cross-cultural engagement. It becomes a study of both indigenous and missionary attitudes towards the old culture and the new missionized culture. Fortunately, the Melanesian Mission and its supporters constantly felt the need to report their experiences, in published books and especially in the mission's periodical, the Southern Cross Log (Note 1). With such a wealth of documentation and contemporary photographs</page><page sequence="3">ULAWA CANOE 7 (Note 2) available, a closer examination of this story allows a detailed reconstruction of the context for these events. Thanks to the records contained in contemporary missionary and indigenous accounts of the action, the story can be told largely through the actual words of the participants or key observers, thereby revealing their attitudes with exceptional clarity. The analysis also traces the introduction and development of new techniques and skills in artefactual competence; the Madoa canoe and church are both the result of an amalgam of Solomon Islands and English skills. The canoe was made with introduced metal tools, applied with traditional skills in an acculturated situation, with the direct intention of sale outside the culture of its makers. On the other hand, the church was built with introduced tools, applied with newly-learned skills in an acculturated situation, with the intention of producing a highly- valued object for use within the culture of its makers. Both the canoe and the church are therefore perfect examples of objects embedded in their times, supremely entangled objects', each with a social history all its own. BONITO CANOES OF ULAWA Labillardiere in June 1793 off the island of Ulawa was probably the first European to record a detailed description of Ulawan canoes. While still some distance offshore from Ulawa (Fig. 1), a four-man canoe paddled out to the French ship and was soon joined by eight other canoes eager to trade. Labillardiere wrote: We admired the elegant form of their canoes, which were exactly similar to those we had seen the preceding days at the easterly part of the Arsacides [Malaita] . They were about twenty-one feet in length, two in breadth, and fifteen inches in depth. The bottom consisted of a single piece cut from the trunk of a tree, and the sides were formed Fig. 1 .

These were ornamented on the outside with figures of birds, fishes, and &amp;c., rudely carved. The greater part of the canoes were terminated in front with the head of a bird, under which was seen a large bunch of fringe, coloured with a red dye, which appeared to me to have been made of the leaves of the vacoua. The other extremity of the boat was likewise ornamented with a red fringe, and here we frequently observed, in the inner side, the carving of a dog projecting from the vessel, which led me to suppose that the savages possess this animal. I was surprised to observe that they had given it nearly the form of a blood-hound; though it is probable that they do not possess that species, but that the carving was nothing more than an imperfect representation of the dog usually met with in the South Sea islands. (Labillardiere 1800:277-2788) Labillardiere commented on the instability of these canoes in the waves and their need for constant bailing but was amazed at the speed they attained when paddled with full effort. Labillardiere's description and his plate suggest that these were probably large four-man versions of bonito canoes. When Brenchley (1873:249) arrived off Ulawa on HMS Curacoa in 1865, he counted at least 90 canoes coming out to meet them. Judging from his description these were also bonito canoes: ...their two ends were alike, they were without outriggers, and generally carried two, rarely three men; their paddles were short, narrow, with a pointed blade. At each extremity the canoes were ornamented with tassels, made of strips of pandanus leaf dyed red at intervals, and also with mother-of-pearl let in different patterns. Fig. 2.

The only major difference is that perhaps the larger three and four-man bonito canoes had become less frequent in favour of two-man versions (Fig. 2). Former missionary the Rev. Walter Ivens (1927:149-154) has provided the most detailed account of the building of canoes on Ulawa, where the generic term for canoe is iola. However, his account is still somewhat sketchy with regard to the bonito canoe, dealing mostly with the larger inter-island canoes. Of these larger canoes, Ivens mentions the raku which holds six men, the lisi nima which is the ordinary overseas canoe, the la o which is a lisi decorated with coneshell la'o inlays, and the iola saraa which had two projections on the prow, a mast decorated with cowries in the bows and a narrow stern with carvings of two birds and a man. The iola sara'a had become obsolete long before Ivens s time. Haddon (1937:91-95) largely followed Ivens for his description of Ulawa canoes, and uses Ivens s general term iola, to apply specifically to the bonito canoe. Without giving a specific Ulawan term for bonito canoes in this text, Ivens describes them as a three or four-man canoe, up to 24 feet long, about 28 inches wide and 14 inches deep on the outside. All bonito canoes have an individual name. The future owner cuts and prepares the necessary timber, then engages an expert canoe builder who must be paid and fed. For an inlaid and decorated bonito canoe, the builder could be paid up to ten pieces of shell money. In his dictionary of the Ulawa language, Ivens (1929:130) gives the term iola ni weieu for bonito canoe, which simply means "canoe for bonito". He goes on to list specific terms for other types of canoes, namely a canoe without separate attached stem and stern, a one-man canoe, a three- man canoe, a four-man canoe, a six-man canoe, and the two types of larger overseas canoes described above. It should be noted that the Auckland Museum Ulawa canoe does not have a carved dog at the stern although some writers (reviewed below) have given the impression that this carving is a universal feature of south-east Solomons bonito canoes. Labillardiere off Ulawa in June 1793 carefully described a carving of a dog on the stern of several canoes. However, in his description cited above, Labillardiere says, "we frequently observed", which implies that a dog carving was not present on all of the canoes seen at that time. In 1851 while travelling through the Solomon Islands in his yacht Wanderer, ; John Webster painted a bonito canoe at the entrance to Marau Sound, Guadalcanal (Auckland Museum PD 43. 1 9). This shows an animal carving at the stern, probably a bird rather than a dog judging by its round head without ears and straight non-curled tail. Another Webster sketch of a bonito canoe stern (Auckland Museum PD 43.27) clearly shows a small carving of a dog with ears and curled tail. Webster's admiring description of San Cristobal bonito canoes in his book (1 866:65- 66) mentions only that "a small image was generally placed inside near the stern". Brenchley (1873:title page) shows an indistinct dog on an Ulawa bonito canoe, presumably drawn from a canoe seen there in 1865. This is obviously not the Ulawa lisi canoe collected by Brenchley and now in the Maidstone Museum. Waite (1987:52) does not mention a carved dog in her description of the Brenchley Ulawa canoe at Maidstone Museum but she does say that the stern has been broken off completely. My own examination of this canoe while it was on loan to the British Museum confirms the absence of a dog carving at the stern. Writing about bonito canoes of Santa Ana and Santa Catalina, Davenport (1990:104) describes a carving of a dog as one of the distinguishing decorations of a bonito canoe. Usually depicted holding a bonito in its muzzle, this is said to represent the origin myth of ritual</page><page sequence="6">10 NEICH fishing for bonito, several versions of which relate a supernatural event wherein a dog catches a bonito. Davenport reports that some experts of Santa Ana and Santa Catalina maintained that the dog carving is a recent decorative innovation borrowed from Ulawa. There is a shell-inlaid carving of a dog on the inner stern of the bonito canoe attributed to Ulawa in the British Museum (Mendana 1901:xxii). Ivens (1927:152) and Haddon (1937:94) mention dog carvings on bonito canoes, while Mead (1973b:23) figures a diagram of a dog carved on the stern of a generalised Santa Ana and Santa Catalina bonito canoe. Pendergrast (Ethnology Department files, Auckland Museum) saw and photographed a dog carving on the stern of an old inlaid bonito canoe at Su'umoli village on Ulawa in 1973. However, the absence of a dog carving on the Auckland Museum bonito canoe emphasises that a dog carving on the stern was not a constant feature of Ulawa bonito canoes. Similarly, judging from the three other later bonito canoes in Auckland Museum, respectively from Santa Ana, Santa Catalina and southern Malaita, a dog carving at the stern is not a universal feature of bonito canoes from these islands either. In some cases this place was taken by the carving of a bonito or a shark. Complicating this discussion is the possibility that at some times and/or at some places in this area of the Solomon Islands, there may not have been a separate type of canoe dedicated solely to bonito fishing. It has been suggested that perhaps canoes used for other purposes might also have been used occasionally for bonito fishing. Given the long time-span from Labillardiere's observations in 1793 to the present, there are probably several answers to this question, complicated further by the spread of Christianity. However, the accounts by Ivens, Davenport, Mead and others certainly make it clear that in the time of their fieldwork, bonito canoes constituted a specific type of canoe distinct from all others and reserved for the purpose of bonito fishing. THE AUCKLAND MUSEUM BONITO CANOE FROM MADOA VILLAGE This canoe is 480 cm long and 60 cm wide (Figs 3,4). The hull is built of separate thin planks, with the joins between them covered by a thick ridge of black parinarium gum. Two long narrow planks form the flat keel and these are joined to one wider side plank on each side, with their curves produced by skilful adzing. Above these side planks, one narrow gunwale plank runs the full length of each side. On the inside, there are only two cross ribs, situated in the forward half of the hull. These ribs are attached to the interior of the hull planks without the fishhead-shaped cleats seen in both the British Museum and Maidstone Museum examples. In the bow there is a small simple cross-seat, but nothing comparable in the stern. The up-curved prow and stern reach up to the same height and both finish in the same small peg which originally held the leaf tassels. At the rear of the prow section there is a vertical step in the gunwale line, and the prow is distinguished by more decorative detail. All the profile heads of the shell-inlaid frontal frigate bird motifs and the two sea spirit figures face forward to the bow. Nautilus shell inlay follows all the outer upper edges of the canoe and continues down under the prow and stern to the waterline. Two forms of nautilus shell inlay elements are used on this canoe, both usually with edge notching (Ivens 1927:392). One form is an isosceles triangle, and the other form is a rectangle with a deep V cut-out at both small ends. Details of the decorative patterns will be described below in the section on the symbolism of the canoe. There are no signs of the charcoal and tree juice decorations seen stained into the wood on some bonito canoes (Ivens 1927:153). Both early photographs of the Auckland Museum canoe show that when collected it was</page><page sequence="7">ULAWA CANOE 1 1 Fig. 3. "Canoe made in Ulawa to raise money for roofing the church.

These are now missing and were probably lost long ago. Several writers have commented on the importance of these red tassels as part of the necessary decorations for a bonito canoe (Brenchley 1873:249, quoted above; Davenport 1990:105; Haddon 1937:94; Ivens 1927:134; Labillardiere 1800:277, quoted above). The same red tassels were worn by the bonito initiates and were attached to special ceremonial haircombs. Ivens (1927:383-384) has described how these tassels and streamers were prepared from the leaves of the fan palm, aleale , and then dyed with scrapings from the lelemo tree and the root of the kikiri.</page><page sequence="8">12 NEICH Fig. 5. Paddle (AM 12108) fromMadoa, Ulawa. Photo: Auckland Museum. In his letter accompanying the canoe (see below), Ivens noted that the two paddles that came with it had actually been used. This implies that they were probably not made expressly for this canoe. They conform to the distinction first noted by Codrington (1891:297) between the narrow pointed paddles of the eastern Solomons and the broad short-bladed long-handled paddles of the western Solomons. As with other eastern paddles, these two are narrow and pointed with a crescent-shaped handle. One of the paddles (AM 12108) has a handgrip in the form of a bird on a square pedestal (Fig. 5) decorated with nautilus shell inlay that continues down the shaft on both sides. THE HISTORY OF THE AUCKLAND MUSEUM CANOE The earliest photograph of this canoe (Fig. 3) was published by Awdry (1903:103) in his popular book on the Melanesian Mission, with the caption "Canoe made in Ulawa to raise money for roofing the church". This photograph was taken by Mrs O 'Ferrali who is listed as a European lay worker of the Melanesian Mission. She was the wife of the Rev. O'Ferrall, famous for his missionary work on Santa Cruz. It was almost certainly taken in early December 1 897 at the Melanesian Mission headquarters on Norfolk Island while the canoe was on its way to Auckland on the Southern Cross. The photograph shows the canoe complete with a paddle at each end and fortunately also illustrates the red dyed leaf tassels at prow and stern which have since disappeared. A later photograph of the canoe (Fig. 4), still with its tassels intact, was apparently taken outside at the former Auckland Museum building in Princes Street. This is probably the photograph taken by museum staff at the request of Rev. Ivens in 1925 when he intended to include the canoe in his forthcoming book on Ulawa (Ivens 1927), but for some reason it was not used. In the Auckland Museum's records, this canoe is registered as AM 12106 and its two shell- inlaid paddles are numbered AM 12107 and AM 12108. These three items were purchased from the Rev. Archdeacon RB. Comins in 1897, for a total price of £12. The canoe and its paddles had been brought to Auckland on the Southern Cross , after its last trip around the islands for 1897. The Southern Cross reached Norfolk Island on 6 December 1897, which is also the date of Ivens's letter to the museums curator, Thomas Cheeseman. The ship then reached Auckland on 1 9 December 1 897, which is when the Ulawa canoe was probably delivered to Auckland Museum.</page><page sequence="9">ULAWA CANOE 13 In a handwritten letter, Rev. W. G. Ivens wrote to the Auckland Museum supplying information about the canoe, as requested by his colleague, Archdeacon R.B. Comins. Norfolk Island December 6th 1897 The Museum Curator, Auckland. Mr. Comins has asked me to write some account of the canoe forwarded to you per Southern Cross. It is a full sized 2 man canoe and a boy can be taken as well. One man thus wd. sit on the front seat, the boy in the middle &amp; the 2nd man aft on a bit of board laid across the bottom of the canoe. The two paddles are full sized &amp; have actually been in use. As Mr. Comins has written, the canoe was made by the Church people of Madoa, Ulawa, &amp; the proceeds from its sale are to be devoted to a fund for the supplying of iron for a Church wh. the Rev. Clement Marau &amp; his people are building at Madoa. Such a canoe as this one offered to you wd. have been used in heathen days &amp; used almost exclusively for bonito fishing &amp; would have been very sacred women would have been prevented from seeing it. The frigate birds or man of war hawks (kaula is the Ulawa name) are associated with the bonitos &amp; the presence of a flock of them anywhere always indicates the presence of bonitos. Sacrifices were offered to Kaula, a kind of disembodied ghost, associated with the bird, &amp; in all the Ulawa decorations Kaula has a foremost place. If Kaula's favour could be won, then the bonito fishing wd. be successful &amp; reversely any one successful in' bonito fishing was regarded as one befriended by Kaula. Between the Kaula on each side of the canoe is the representation of a "ghost of the deep" (akalo ni matawa). On the near side one stands on a rainbow &amp; the off-side one has a fish head &amp; an arrow in his right hand &amp; a bow in his left preparing to shoot the poor fisherman. The front of the canoe is cut in tattoo fashion on both sides, also there is a bird cut holding a fish in its mouth. Then there are 2 birds' wings, one on each side &amp; 2 fishes fins, one on each side. The square towards the bottom in the front represents clouds as does the pyramidal piece of shell on both side of the front. Then there are other birds in the front &amp; on the stern. The canoe is made of good wood, the raised part of stem and stern is of specially good red wood called "liki". The canoe builder is renowned for the lightness and neat construction of his canoes. The inlaying was done by the people as a whole. The grassy looking decoration dyed and red is from Malanta [Malaita] &amp; is much sought after by Ulawa people. I trust that you will see your way to give us the price we ask for the canoe 12 pound- as a piece of work the canoe is perfect - such a good specimen has never been offered for sale before &amp; the people say that they never turned out such a piece of work before. This canoe represents part of the offerings of the natives themselves towards the building of their big church - I am Sir yours etc. W.G. Ivens (Auckland Museum files) The comments by Ivens advertising this canoe as "perfect" and better than any canoe made</page><page sequence="10">14 NEICH previously indicate that it may not be a typical example of an Ulawan bonito canoe. As a first point, it appears never to have been used for fishing. Ivens makes a point of saying that the paddles had been used, which strongly suggests that the canoe itself had not. In a later letter to the museum (Ivens to Cheeseman, 18 September 1925, Auckland Museum files), Ivens reiterates that this canoe was "made at my suggestion originally" to raise funds for the church roof. If it is not typical, then the question becomes one of how does it differ from other bonito canoes. Being made by church people for sale to a museum might have encouraged the craftsmen to take extra care with the workmanship and to make the decoration more elaborate than usual. Or the opposite effect may have occurred because it was being built for ignorant outsiders. In the same 1925 letter, Ivens also mentions that this canoe is a one-man canoe, in contrast to his earlier claim that it was a two-man canoe, and is inferior because it has only nautilus shell in the decorations and no lao cone shells. The most obvious difference is its small size, suggesting that it is best considered as a slightly reduced model of a usual bonito canoe with some limitation in the range of its shell inlay decorations. Nevertheless, despite its small size and restriction to nautilus shell inlay, the high quality of workmanship and great amount of inlay strongly support the view that this canoe was honestly intended to show the best of Ulawa canoe construction and decoration. By this time, Ulawa was already well known as a source of small model canoes made for sale to passengers on the mission ship. From this perspective, the Auckland Museum canoe might be regarded as a superior, slightly reduced-size model made for a specific purpose, exemplifying a different moment in the commodification of Ulawan canoe culture. BONITO FISHING IN ULAWA CULTURE Writing for his audience of mission supporters in the Southern Cross Log for 1 897, Rev. Ivens has given a very lively contemporary account of bonito fishing at Ulawa from canoes such as the Auckland Museum example: In old days the great fishing feat was to catch bonitos; these go in a shoal, and their presence is usually indicated by a circle of birds flying overhead, and now and then darting down to secure for themselves some of the small fish which the bonitos are chasing. As soon as the fish were espied - either by means of the accompanying birds or through bright lines left on the water as they leapt here and there in chase after their smaller brethren - then down would go the canoes, two men to each, and then began the race to get up first. The canoes almost flew along, so eager were their owners to exceli in this the greatest of sports. As the canoes neared the fish, the bow-man ceased paddling and began to cast with his rod and line in amongst the fish, while his companion kept the canoe going, and also looked after a line that trailed astern. The hooks used are made of pearl or clam shell, or of tortoise shell, and serve for both hooks and bait in one. Those cast with the rod are of ordinary hook-shape, and have an imitation fish cut on them; those dragged astern are made of a straight piece of clam or pearl shell with the downward side carved to imitate the look of a small fish, and on the upward side as it floats is fastened a hooked piece of tortoise shell. Both these big bonito hooks, and also the small hooks, used when fishing from the rocks, exhibit the most perfect workmanship. An infinitude of time must have been expended over their making, and yet a stick or so of tobacco will purchase the best of them. The bonito was a sacred fish, and when caught they were cooked and eaten in the places sacred to the spirits, where the women might not enter. (SCL II(22):27-28, Feb 1897)</page><page sequence="11">ULAWA CANOE 1 5 In his later ethnography of Ulawa, Ivens (1927:130-159) gave a full account of the role of bonito fishing in the malaohu initiation of young boys in Ulawa, as does Mead (1973a) for Santa Ana, and Davenport (1981; 1990) for Santa Catalina. In Ulawa, the young initiates underwent a period of seclusion in the canoe house, taoha&gt; which also served as a custom house' where the men gathered and spent much of their time. Here they carried out the rituals connected with the bonito canoes and their ancestors. Canoe houses were built around canoe landing places called maalitawa in Ulawan, situated at small inlets with an opening in the shore reef and access up the coastal cliffs of the island. Hendren (1976:152) has described the archaeological remains of earlier canoe houses on Ulawa in the early 1970s, among which were still-functioning canoe houses containing shell-inlaid bonito canoes. Similarly, Pendergrast in 1973 photographed bonito canoes at several villages around Ulawa (Auckland Museum files). When not in the canoe houses on the beaches, the older men, young unmarried men and malaohu boys of Ulawa congregated and slept in the toohi which served as a clubhouse in the village (Ivens 1927:46-47). Several of these toohi custom houses' on Ulawa were photographed by Beattie (see note 2) during his 1906 visit on the Southern Cross. Waite (1997) has described several custom houses, both of the canoe house and council house varieties, from localities in the south-east Solomons. SYMBOLISM OF THE BONITO CANOE Several recent studies (e.g. Phillips and Steiner 1999) of non-Western artefacts intended largely for trade and sale have demonstrated that many of these forms of art still exhibit all the communicative and signifying qualities of 'legitimate' or authentic' works of art. This is especially clear when the same types of objects are being used simultaneously within the culture, as was the case with the Auckland Ulawa canoe. Nevertheless, we must be aware that the actual messages and meanings conveyed by these objects will be very different for the indigenous users and the external collectors or consumers. Many writers on various south-east Solomon Islands cultures, including Ulawa have commented on the manner in which bonito canoes and their associated rituals constitute a central cultural focus for the coastal peoples in this area. Unlike the other important decorated canoes used in trading and travel which have a recognized economic aspect, the bonito canoes are sacred ritual objects operating in the spiritual domain. Their construction represents an attempt to realise an ideal form, both in aesthetic and spiritual terms. Writing of the canoes of Santa Ana and Santa Catalina Islands in the 1960s, Davenport (1990:99-100) has explained how most bonito canoes were self-perpetuating votive offerings made by important men to their tutelary deities. A few other bonito canoes were constructed as ancestor memorials, sponsored by a lineage. Davenport (1968:22) especially, saw the sacred bonito canoes and the canoe houses where they were kept as the main locus where "the secular domain of man intersects with the sacred domain of the deities". Given this central cultural role of bonito canoes as material representations of the relations between humans and the supernatural, it is to be expected that the symbolism of the bonito canoes will convey very powerful messages (Figs 6, 7). Most prominent are the motifs rendered by inlays of nautilus shell and conus shell, set in rows and outlining figures such as birds and fish. The small triangular and rectangular pieces of nautilus shell are readily cut from the thin shells of nautilus which drift ashore and consequently have minimal intrinsic value. The larger round and half-round discs of conus shell, lao, are much thicker and required intensive labour to grind them down to the required shape. Consequently, the conus discs have considerable intrinsic value and are always rescued from old worn-out objects and reused, virtually becoming heirlooms.</page><page sequence="12">16 NEICH Fig. 6.

In his letter about the Auckland Museum canoe, Ivens identifies the frontal stylised birds depicted by the shell inlay as frigate birds or man of war hawks, known as kaula on Ulawa (Fig. 8). He explains that Kaula, as a disembodied ghost associated with these birds, had the power to ensure successful bonito fishing, provided his favour had been gained by appropriate sacrifices. Codrington (1891:126, 145) also notes that Kaula as the frigate bird is venerated at Ulawa, and as Daula at Florida (1891:145). It is this sacred character of the frigate bird in association with bonito fishing that accounts for the bird s widespread occurrence in shell inlay ornament throughout the Solomons. Very similar shell-inlaid profile frigate bird motifs are shown along the side of a la'o inter-island canoe figured by Ivens (1927: frontispiece), but they are not recorded elsewhere as occurring on the sides of Ulawa bonito canoes. On both sides of the Auckland canoe, at prow and stern, a profile inlaid bird figure faces into the middle of the canoe (Figs 9, 10). These are referred to by Ivens in his letter as "other birds", but they would seem to be representations of frigate birds also. In addition to these frontal and profile birds represented solely by shell inlay, the canoe also features one frigate bird on each side at the upper rear of the raised prow section just in front of the vertical step in the gunwale (Fig. 11). Facing towards the bow, the body of these birds is represented by shell inlay on the solid timber of the gunwale edge, but the bird s head and a fish that it is holding in its beak are carved out of the gunwale in three-dimensional open-work. On the left side, the birds head has since been broken off. Although Ivenss letter does not make the observation, it can be suggested that the stirrup-shaped line of shell inlay projecting down from the shoulders of the bird might represent the bird's wings shown with the characteristic sharp-angled joint of a frigate bird's wing.</page><page sequence="14">18 NEICH Fig. 9.

Detail of right side bow of Ulawa bonito canoe, showing inlay and open-work carving depiction of bird with fish in its mouth and tattoo pattern below the birds body. Photo: Auckland Museum. Immediately below the body of the birds described above, is an area of incised geometric decoration perhaps with black pigment in the lines (Fig. 11). In his letter, Ivens describes this pattern as "cut in tattoo fashion", presumably referring to body tattoo patterns seen on Ulawa. In fact, this particular pattern does not closely match any of the Ulawa tattoo patterns reproduced by Ivens in his book (1927:83). However, the pattern on the canoe is virtually identical with the side facial pattern of segesege or unpigmented tattoo from Santa Catalina reproduced by Mead (1 973a:3 1). Mead comments that each tattoo artist and segesege artist have their own favourite compositions, and similarities among Sa'a, Santa Catalina, Ulawa and other south- east Solomons areas are confined to the motifs used on the side of the face. In Sa'a and Ulawa, pigment is added to these facial markings. Ivens mentions two birds' wings and two fishes' fins, inlaid one on each side of the canoe (Fig. 12). The bird wing with a characteristic frigate bird sharp-angle joint, rises from the lower edge of the bow. Ivens does not mention it but the fish fin depends downwards from a darkened wood area with the shape of a fish's head which is followed by an inlaid straight body line ending in an upright tail fluke. Therefore, this apparently isolated fin motif can be reasonably interpreted as part of a larger fish-form composition. As described by Ivens, the inlaid square pattern (Fig. 1 2) at the end of the line of inlay under the bow represents clouds, as does the triangular pyramidal piece of shell set above the line of inlay in the central part of the prow. Another relationship to tattoo patterns is suggested by the similarity of this Ulawa triangular shell inlay cloud' motif to an Ulawa tattoo "cloud" motif figured by Ivens (1927:85). The human-like figures inlaid one on each side of the canoe are identified by Ivens in his letter as "ghosts of the deep", or in Ulawan, "akalo ni matawa". The figure on the left side of the canoe (Fig. 13) faces towards the prow and stands on a structure with up-curved ends. In his</page><page sequence="16">20 NEICH Fig. 1 2.

Photo: Auckland Museum. letter, Ivens identifies this as a rainbow, while in his book (Ivens 1927:33) a wood carving of a sea spirit riding on a similar shape is said to be seated on an iola hoi , that is, a canoe with turned-up ends. Comparison of the head-form on this Ulawa canoe sea spirit figure with others drawn by Ulawan artists (see below) confirms that this inlaid figure also has a fish for a head. The sea spirit figure on the right side of the canoe (Fig. 14) also faces forward but stands on a flat base. His head is very clearly depicted in the form of a fish, probably a shark judging by the upright dorsal fin. In his hands he holds a bow and arrow, ready to shoot an offending fisherman. Unfortunately Ivens did not say specifically which particular sea ghosts are represented on this canoe. Several native drawings or carved representations of these sea spirits from Ulawa, Saa and other places have been published by Codrington (1891:197, 259), Fox (1924:125, 126, 127, 128), Ivens (1927:33, 201, 202, 204,206) andWaite 1979:256-260). Some of these published figures show the attributes of bow and arrow, rainbow or canoe, shared by the Ulawa canoe inlays. Out of the 1 5 figured, 14 have their head depicted as a fish, of which only one or two look as if a shark was intended. This probably relates to the figure on the right side of the Auckland canoe, which seems to have a shark for its head. According to Fox (1924:124 ff.), Ivens (1929:199 ff.) and Waite (1979:256-258), these spirit beings are called akalo ni matawa at Sa a and Ulawa, adaro ni matawa at San Cristobal, and are known by other cognate terms in other parts of the south-east Solomons. Akalo ni matawa are not ghosts of dead men, rather they are spirits that have always lived in the open sea or matawa. They are usually represented as partly anthropomorphic and partly fish-like, and are thought to live far out at sea or near small islands along the coast. The people of Ulawa think of San Cristobal as the original home of these sea spirits. They are mostly malevolent</page><page sequence="18">22 NEICH spirits who shoot fishermen with bows and arrows of garfish if they have been offended or are not satisfied with sacrifices. At Ulawa, the offerings usually made to the sea spirits are flying fox teeth and dried almonds. Rainbows and waterspouts are their special signs, to be avoided by people out in canoes because these are the paths by which the sea spirits travel. Many of the canoe landings around Ulawa are under the care of particular akalo ni matawa. On Ulawa, the worship of sea spirits was called haraina. Fox says that the chief of them is called Ngoriaru and he is known by that name in south Malaita, Ulawa and all of San Cristobal. Two subordinate chiefs of sea spirits in Ulawa are known as Huaholai matawa and Hanai matawa. Ivens recognises that Ngorieru (note spelling difference) is the chief sea spirit at Sa'a, but maintains that the chief sea spirit at Ulawa is Pua Tangalu. Other sea spirits at Ulawa named by Ivens are Wasi i matawa, Hui holai matawa, Hana i matawa, and Sii aleha. Given the extremely variable representations of different sea spirits, it is probably not worthwhile trying to specifically identify the two on the Auckland Museum canoe. Apart from the sea spirits and profile frigate birds inlaid on the sides and the absence of a dog carving in the stern, most of the decorative design elements on this Ulawa bonito canoe can be matched in form and placement on a generalised south-east Solomons bonito canoe as diagrammed by Mead (1973b:23). ULAWA IN THE SOUTH-EAST SOLOMONS CULTURE AREA Ulawa was once a famous centre for the manufacture and sale of canoes to southern Malaita, Uki and San Cristobal (Codrington 1891:294; Ivens 1927:8). Santa Ana informants told Mead (1973b:25) that their ocean-going risu-e-rima canoes were formerly manufactured only in Ulawa and Santa Ana for sale to the mainland of San Cristobal. Ulawan canoes had a reputation throughout the south-east Solomons for being lighter and more artistically made than other island canoes. Beyond the supplying of canoes, Ulawa was also a source of technical and ritual skills necessary for inter-island canoe travel. As Mead (1973b:59) has said, "Ulawa men were respected for their skills, feared because of their powerful sea deities and military powers, and hated for their success." Within the wider south-east Solomons area, by virtue of these skills and its location, Ulawa occupied a very special position in the cultural and art area bounded by San Cristobal, south Malaita and Ulawa (Mead 1977:156-161). In trade and cultural relationships, Ulawa dominated the western part of San Cristobal and acted as a "gatekeeper" in this areas relations with more distant areas of the Solomons to the north. Ulawa people placed a higher value on themselves and their products (Figs 15, 16), as evidenced by the copying of Ulawa arts and styles by people of these dominated areas and the higher bride price demanded by Ulawa in dealings with Santa Ana. Without being systematically aware of this wider picture, European missionaries were repelled and challenged by the pride and apparent arrogance of Ulawa culture. As Ivens wrote in 1898: Those who knew Ulawa in old days could tell a tale, for Ulawa once had a terrible reputation. Self-will, blind, ignorant fanaticism, all had their exponents here. The Gospel and its teachers were flouted out, and there was only wanting the power and the opportunity to be rid of them all. For greed and rapacity, I believe, the people had few equals. For nothing, one got nothing in return; and for gifts the return was nothing too; and often the present was hurled back at its giver, because something else was wanted instead. An axe was once actually thrown down at Bishop Selwyns feet, because a few books were wanted instead; and the very children had to be 'bought' to come to school, and the rule was no present, no schooling'. And as far as their heathenism was</page><page sequence="19">ULAWA CANOE 23 Fig. 15. Non-Christian men of Ahia village, Ulawa, wearing their traditional valuables and ornaments, 1906.

Sacrifices were offered on every possible occasion - for rain, for fine weather, as first-fruits, for bonito catching, at the launching of a new canoe, for victory, for deliverance, etc., etc. ( SCL IV(43):11, Nov 1898) In this missionary view of Ulawa culture, Ivens illustrates a classic case of European misunderstanding of Melanesian views on reciprocity. The European missionaries believed they were bringing free gifts of goods, new skills, and spiritual enlightenment. They expected to be thanked, or at least for the Ulawans to show some gratitude. For their part, the Ulawan leaders who were accustomed to dealing with outsiders from a position of dominance, suddenly found themselves expected to assume a position of inferiority, as inferior receivers of gifts instead of superior gift givers. For a Melanesian society based on economic status where 'gifts' served to place receivers into a state of obligation, the arrival and persistence of these outsiders must have been seen as a fierce challenge. CLEMENT MARAU, APOSTLE OF ULAWA Fox (1958:162-163) and Hilliard (1978:171-173) have summarised the story of the development of Christianity on Ulawa, beginning with the departure of Walter Waaro to Norfolk Island with Bishop Patteson in 1870. When Waaro was due to return to Ulawa as a Christian teacher in 1880 he felt inadequate for the task and asked his older friend at Norfolk, Clement Marau (Fig. 17) of Merlav (Merelava) in the Banks Islands, to accompany him for the first three months. Marau had gone to Norfolk Island in 1869 and had been confirmed in 1875. Marau went with Waaro and eventually stayed on as the main local missionary at Ulawa until his death in 1920. This period was interrupted by Marau s suspension from office in 1907 for adulteries with local women. Clement Marau's own life story has been told many times, in addition to his autobiography (Marau 1 894) which takes him up to 1894. Fox (1958:162-163) and Hilliard (1978:171-173) give useful summaries, noting that he was ordained deacon in 1890 and priest in 1903. Marau does not mention it himself, but in the context of this study it is also important to note how he learnt to do shell inlay in Ulawa style and began selling inlaid bowls to raise money for his bride price, as explained by Fox (1958:163): Fig. 17. Rev. Clement Marau at door of Madoa Church, Ulawa, 1906. Note locally-made, shell-inlaid church furniture. Photo: Beattie, Auckland Museum.</page><page sequence="21">ULAWA CANOE 25 He wished to marry an Ulawa girl, but a prohibitive price of £50 was asked, so Marau learnt to carve and inlay, made bowls and sold them till he got the money. He married Susie in 1883. Considering the effort that it took to raise £40 in the 1890s for his Ulawa church roof, £50 seems an excessive amount to have raised single-handed in about three years but it was probably quoted as a convenient and impressive round figure. In any case, Clement probably did not have to raise the full amount himself but was helped by the efforts of his own kin from Merlav. Bishop Montgomery writing before Marau's suspension, described Marau at the height of his success: As years have passed, Clement has strengthened his position steadily... There are, I believe, no heathen in his island now. His church is a noble coral structure, and he lives to be the most respected and the ablest native priest in the Mission. (Montgomery 1908:220) Some years after his suspension, Clement was eventually readmitted to communion but his position on Ulawa remained a source of disturbance until his death in 1920. His elder son Martin was ordained deacon in 1919 and became the next leader of the Ulawa church. MADOA VILLAGE BY THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY The name of Madoa village has been spelt in many different ways, among them Mwadoa, Matoa, Mwatjo'a, Mwado'a, and Mwadjo'a. Hendren (1976:164) includes a useful map of Ulawa, spelling the name of this village as "Mwdo'a". The progress of Christianity in Ulawa and Madoa has been well documented by mission writers, although their critics of the time claimed that mission-reported numbers of converts were hopelessly optimistic. Madoa was one of the early success stories on Ulawa and it soon came to be regarded as an approved model mission village, held up as an example to visitors and Ulawans alike (Figs 18, 19). According to Ivens (1927:46), pagan Madoa had four chiefs, each with a landing place of his own, a canoe house and a club house. The ceremony for malaohu boys was last held at Madoa under the chief Lakai Malau in about 1860 (Ivens 1927:132). This cessation of the malaohu ceremonies marks a major phase in the decline of the old religion. By 1896 Ivens could report that out of the nine villages on Ulawa, four had mission schools, and of these Madoa had nearly all its people baptised ( SCL 11(22), Feb 1897). Many mission visitors of the mid- 1890s commented on the successful transformation of Madoa: It was terribly uphill work at first - now, every village of Ulawa wants to have a school. We visited four places, and everything seemed most encouraging. Of course, the most interesting spot of all is where Clement Marau lives at Matoa. It is very wonderful to see what has been done here. The landing place is bad. There are great masses of coral rocks, and the boat has to move amongst them very slowly, and when the landing place is reached one has to climb up a sort of rude ladder to the higher ground above. A good number of people had collected there and as we walked up a sort of avenue to the village we met Clement. It is one of the largest and perhaps the best-kept village in the Mission. The houses are large and well-built, and not all over the place as is the general way, but arranged on each side of a long and fairly broad open space, which has almost the</page><page sequence="22">26 NEICH Fig. 18.

There is a general clean-up once a week as at Norfolk Island, and everything was beautifully tidy the day we were there. {SCL 11(1 6):3, Aug 1896) In his report for 1896, the Bishop of Melanesia detailed how these changes were affecting the people of Madoa: May 2 - The third [village visited on Ulawa] is the Rev. C. Marau s village. It is a model of cleanliness, and built in good taste. There are eighty children and young people, and fifty adults going to school here. Christianity is certainly in possession in Matoa, but the island generally is only in a transition stage, and walking the street of this village, amongst its clean, nicely-clothed people, are naked visitors from other places, some utterly regardless of their nakedness, others ashamed of it, and trying to hide themselves behind trees and in houses when the people come together. If they could be baptised and become Christians at once they would do so, but they dread the interval between renouncing their present gods, and being received into the kingdom of the true God. During this time, when they are nobodies, their forsaken gods might catch and punish them for their desertion. Hence they remain where they are, and are naked. The first step a man takes towards becoming a Christian is to put on a loin cloth. Then he attends classes for a year or more, after which he is baptised. {SCL II(22):4-5, Feb 1897) In contrast to the Bishops European perspective of what clothing meant for the converts, Marau (1 894) tells how new adherents were so embarrassed when they first put on the loincloth to signal their new status. Under this new Christian regime, the rhythm of life in Madoa had taken on an emphasis based around the Sabbath: A bell rings at nine o'clock each night, sending everyone to their homes; no one being permitted to loiter about after that bell has rung. On Sundays the people meet for a social meal at mid-day. The fish is caught, and all the food prepared, on the Saturday. Young and old, Chiefs, Teachers and people here all meet together. In large bowls the food is brought in, and divided out to all alike. If there have been any quarrels among the people, coming to the social meal is a sign that such are ended. Conversely, if any stop away, it is a sign that the oifence is not forgiven, and that something yet remains to be done. (Marau, quoted in Hilliard 1978:171-172). THE BUILDING OF THE MADOA CHURCH In his biographical account of the first conversions on Ulawa, Marau (1894:78) described what became the place for his new church, if not the exact spot: There still remained one sacred place in the middle of the village [Madoa] which some of the people had reserved by their own choice, asking me if I pleased not to destroy it, and they would build a house sacred to God in the place of it. I agreed that it should so remain for a time, but said that it would be well to clear the place underneath, cutting away the creepers and chopping down the big trees; the stones with which it was fenced should be carefully piled in a heap, and at some future time we would see what could be done.</page><page sequence="24">28 NEICH In his proselytising zeal, Marau had already destroyed many sacred places associated with spirit worship, destroying their charms and emblems, chopping down sacred groves and desecrating sanctuaries. The Melanesian Mission Report for June 1896 ( SCL 1896:xii) notes that, "Clement has started a fine church, the walls of stone and concrete, and the roof to be of native timber." In this same report, Rev. R.B. Comins {SCL 1 896:xli) wrote: From here we steamed round to Matoa, where the Rev. Clement Marau is stationed, where we found all. He and his people had long desired to have a special building for divine worship distinct from that used for school purposes. With this object they had cleared and leveled a suitable site in the centre of the village, and were now waiting for some practical hints before laying the foundations of a substantial stone church. The people were all very enthusiastic about it. From this time on through 1896 to 1898, the building of the new church at Madoa (Figs 20, 21) is a theme running through all the issues of the Southern Cross Log , both from the points of view of visiting Europeans and of local Ulawans. In 1 896 a visiting missionary wrote: Fig. 20. Madoa Church, Ulawa, 1906, showing the coral block walls and corrugated iron roof built under Rev. Clement Marau's direction.

Interior view of Madoa Church, Ulawa, 1906, showing coral block walls, corrugated iron roof, steps of sawn white coral paving in the apse, and church furniture. Photo: Beattie, Auckland Museum. About the middle of the street, Clement is building the new church, which is the wonder of all who see it. The material used is white coral, which is carried with immense labour from a considerable distance. The walls are perfectly straight, very substantial at the bottom, and gradually growing less thick. The apse is circular as at Norfolk Island, and there are three arched entrances. He has also built a stone vestry. The roof has not yet been begun. Clement said people came from all places to see the church. Some thought it foolish to work so hard, some only wondered, and some were offended because they had not been asked to help. (SCL 11(1 6) :3 Aug 1896) The Bishop reported on his 1896 visit to Madoa with a description of work on the church: May 2 - The church which Clement and his people are building is of coral, cut out of the reef and sawn square. When finished it will be the finest piece of native or European work in the Solomons. He says that the heathen have not hindered the building of it, but have marveled, admired, and occasionally grumbled because they had not been called in to help. The Christians have made it their work alone. (SCL 11(22) :4- 5, Feb 1897)</page><page sequence="26">30 NEICH After the 1896 voyage of Southern Cross , Rev. Ivens wrote that at Ulawa: Clement is very busy now cutting trees and sawing timbers for his church and herein his people s love for him and for the work is clearly shewn; one man readily gave the site for the church, and allowed his coconuts and breadfruit to be chopped down, nor did he ask for any remuneration; and the men of the village will all readily in turn give gratis a day or two days of their time in helping in any part of the church building that may be going on. The church walls are 72ft. long by 36 fit. wide, and are of sawn coral, cut and placed by Clement; they are about 3ft. wide at the bottom and slope up from both sides to about 9in. The whole is 8ft. high. The east end has an apse. It is the timber for the roof that Clement is now cutting. He wants to put an iron roof on, but I am afraid the cost will be too much, £40 at the least, and where is this to come from? Would that some kind friend with a long purse would come our way. ( SCL 11(22) :30, Feb 1 897) In March 1 897 the Editor of the Southern Cross Log made a plea: The captain of HMS Pylades in speaking of his late visit to Ulawa, writes that he is charmed with Clement Marau' and he adds 'I think something might be done to help to an iron roof for his church. If you think so, please put me down for one pound'. The coral walls of Clement s church are now finished, and the question has now to be settled whether it will be roofed with sago thatch which would rot out every six or seven years, staining the walls, or with iron which would cost perhaps £40, but last a very long time. Clement has set his whole heart upon an iron roof, and will probably set aside his salary (£20 a year) to purchase one. We should be very glad to see his wish fulfilled, and will receive subscriptions towards defraying the cost. If the iron could be carried down to Ulawa in the Southern Cross in April, there is no doubt that Clement would be immensely pleased and encouraged. ( SCL II(23):2, Mar 1897) As a result of this plea, contributions ranging from three shillings and sixpence to £4 started to come in from individual Mission supporters (SCL 111(26), June 1897). From the first voyage of 1897, Rev. Ivens reported from Ulawa that: The Rev. C. Marau s church at Matoa, Ulawa, is approaching completion; he only now wants the roofing. A trader in Guadalcanar happened to visit him a short time ago, and shortly after his visit sent Clement a promise of half the iron required, and the remainder at cost price. This is a great encouragement, and we take this opportunity of thanking Mr Ivensen for his generous gift. It is not always that missions and trade go so happily together in these out-of-the-way parts of the world. (SCL III(27):3, July 1897) But then in February 1898 (SCL 111(34): 10-1 1, Feb 1898) Clement was reported to be greatly distressed at the death of his four year old son Mark. The church building had come to a standstill but just previous to this the roof of the church had been prepared for the thatching, with 200 bamboo rafters each 23 ft. (7m) long laid the whole length of the church. By August 1897 it was reported that Clements church had been temporarily roofed with thatch, pending arrival of iron. An 1898 letter supposedly written by a young Melanesian girl reads:</page><page sequence="27">ULAWA CANOE 31 We are all very busy building the new church now. We all help to carry the stones and to labour. But Clement has fenced round that piece of ground where the church is being built, and we keep it holy. If we are hungry as we work, and want to eat, we go outside that fence, and we do not carry things inside that fence, only what we want for the church. So when the church is finished it will be very holy. All the people love Clement, and obey him, and fear him, but he is never proud. (SCL IV(44):11, 1898) Archdeacon Palmer writing from the islands in June 1 898 for an English audience was very impressed: Clement Marau was very well, and gave a good report of the place [Ulawa] - school and work on both sides of the island going on satisfactorily. I was gready pleased with his Church. One can hardly credit that it was built by Melanesians. The walls are 2 feet thick at the bottom, and slope to 9 inches at the wall plate. It is well and evenly built with solid stone and good lime: as substantial a building as one would wish to see. The Chancel is an Apse, and raised much as the Norfolk Island Chapel is, and floored with oblong slabs of white coral, sawn into shape, and well and evenly laid. I wondered, seeing Clem had no level, how he managed to get it so straight and level. He told me he got a straight and long bamboo, split it, cut out the joints, and used water to give him the level. The stone has all been dressed with axes. I am afraid to say how many he told me had been used up in the process. It is a pity he had not been provided with some mason s hammers. The roof is well and strongly made, and at present is thatched, but the iron is all here for roofing it. Altogether it is a most creditable structure; far and away the best church in Melanesia. (SCL English Supplement, V(50), Sept 1899) The Southern Cross Log of November 1 898 contains a full account of the building of Madoa church to date, obviously written by Rev. Ivens who regarded himself as Clement Maraus mentor during the building: It is now over two years since Rev. Clement Marau began to build his church at Matoa, Ulawa. In civilised lands one hardly expects a clergyman to build his own church, but in Melanesia the better workman a clergyman is, the better chance will there be of his having a good church to worship in. And Clement was determined to have a church the like of which has not been seen yet in Melanesia, and his people nobly supported him in the carrying out of his plans. The people gave themselves willingly to the work; Clement merely had to state what he wanted, and there were always plenty of volunteers to do what he needed. Philip Huraatea gave the piece of ground for the church to be built on, and cut down several coconut palms and bread-fruit trees in order to provide the necessary space. The church stands right in the middle of the long village, and alongside it a school-house is to built, and possibly a house for the white missionary. The stone for the walls was all sawn with an old cross-cut saw, rusted and broken- handled. Wherever good boulders were found, blocks were sawn out of them, and then all the people, women included, carried them on their backs to the village. And no light load some of them must have been, for I saw several stones over the doorway at least 3 feet long and 1 5 inches wide. Slowly the walls rose from a three feet base to a width</page><page sequence="28">32 NEICH of 6 inches at the top, and standing nearly 8 feet high. The stones are all well set in their places in mortar, some of them (sandstone) having a smooth face, and others of rougher coral stone, a jagged one following the line of the coral. The east end Clement has built apsidal shape, and the apse is to be floored with cut limestone, and is to have four steps. He hopes to have this all ready this summer. The Holy Table is to be made at Norfolk Island, and Clement has great plans for inlaying it with nautilus shell, and when finished it ought to be worth seeing. The seats will be made locally, and inlaid in due time. The pillars for supporting the roof are fourteen in number, seven a side; both they, and the cross beams which they support, are of very heavy wood, chosen specially for its white ant resisting properties, and their dimensions are well in keeping with the size of the building. I spent a month with Clement this year, and we set up the pillars, and mortised the cross beams, and got everything ready to put on the temporary sago-palm leaf thatch. All the timbers fitted well into their places, and the result is a very strong structure; and with the temporary roof on the building looks uncommonly well both inside and outside. As I wrote before, the church is 70 feet long and 34 wide. Towards the expense of iron roofing we can now, I think, reckon on over £30 (thanks to the kind helpers), and Mr. Soenson [sic] has made a very generous offer of help besides; but there will be many other expenses. Let me close by telling some interesting things concerning the building of the church. The heathen from the other villages would avert their heads when they passed the church, lest the power of the Spirit, whose it was, should strike them; and if any shavings or bits of wood from the timbers lay in the path, these they would carefully brush aside lest they should tread on them and do despite to the Spirit. Nor could any one of them be persuaded to go inside the walls or even to mount on to the stones of the foundations. And when those who had been working at the church were given bowls of pinga' (a yam soup generally provided when there has been any kind of club or associated work on), should any heathen have chanced to be standing near, no persuasions availed to make him eat this pinga' with the school people, for he feared lest by eating he would be putting himself into the power of the Christian's Spirit. And yet I heard that even the heathen added their quota to this work of God, for they helped, some of them, to sew the thatch, and, often, one standing by, would help me turn over the heavy timbers in the shed, and they even tried their hands at the wonderful augur. The sewing of the thatch took a whole day and the best part of two nights, and eight hundred bundles of thatch were used (each as much as one would care to carry). But how I was struck with the reverence of the people; no one of them ever dreamed of smoking inside what were really the bare walls, nor would they sit and chatter inside, but when a man wanted to smoke or to have a chat, he went and sat somewhere outside. All bags and such like things were left outside. One great cause for wonder is the willingness of the people; and their zeal comes from nothing but the power of the Gospel of Christ. As heathens they had no such zeal, and they certainly have not got it through their being merely civilized. They, themselves, wonder that they should have worked so long and so persistently and with such good effect. C SCL IV(43):10-1 1, Nov 1898)</page><page sequence="29">ULAWA CANOE 33 In a letter dated 10 May 1899 {SCL V(51):7, Sept 1899), Clement Marau told Rev. Ivens triumphantly: While you have been away, you may see that I have not been idle, for I have finished translating the Acts, and we have sawn all the rest of the stone for paving the east end of the church, and all the steps are laid. My brother, it is good. Just as you and I planned how it should be, so have I finished it, right up to the last step on which the Holy Table stands. At last, in his "Report on the Island Voyage of 1900", Rev. Ivens could write: Owing to the kind help of Mr. Allen Christian, of Norfolk Island, we were able to roof the Madoa (Ulawa) Church with iron, while the ship went west for three weeks on the last voyage. From outside the church looks well, and I hope that everything will be finished inside in time for consecration next August. (SCL V(49):20, June 1901) Finally, the Madoa church was consecrated on 3 October 1901 and given the name St. Barnabas after the parent church on Norfolk Island. THE LESSON OF THE MADOA CHURCH As noted above, the last pagan canoe rituals and initiations took place in Madoa in about 1 860. In 1898, on Ulawa, out of an estimated population of 1000 people there were 16 baptisms, 245 Christians, and 437 people under instruction. By 1900, four villages were still heathen on Ulawa, with 351 Christians out of a total population of 700 people. The Melanesian Mission was well aware of the powerful example provided by Clements church. Even before its completion, the missionary publications praised the church and its creator continuously. Thus, in a special issue of the Southern Cross Log (IV(45):30, 1898) we read: Undoubtedly what will prove to be one great factor in the final establishment of Christianity in Ulawa will be found in the completion and consecration of the church at Madoa. Already its fame is established, and Christians regard it as a marvellous instance of what can be done under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and heathens are confirmed in their opinion that some great spirit must be helping those who adopt the new way. We trust that by the end of 1899 the church will be all ready for consecration, with its iron roof on, and the stone pavement finished in the chancel. And again, written about Ulawa in 1899, for an English audience: The island is now largely Christian, more than half the people probably attending the five schools. The Rev. C. Marau is a great power, and has immense influence throughout the whole island. He has built a wonderful coral church, after the pattern of St Barnabas', Norfolk Island. This is the finest building in the Solomon Islands, and reflects great credit upon the native Christians who built it. He has also composed chants and hymns for the services. (SCL V(53):34-5, Nov 1899) When the Christians of Suuholo village asked Clement to stay on Ulawa and build a</page><page sequence="30">34 NEICH church for them he agreed, thereby delaying his own ordination. As Awdry ( 1 903: 1 05) reported: It has been very uphill work, and the small island is still not entirely Christian, but there are six schools, and in 1901 a really remarkably fine church was opened, built under Clement's direction, of which the people are justifiably very proud. Clement would have been ordained priest by now if he could have been spared to go away to Norfolk Island for the necessary study, but when his own church was finished the people of a neighbouring village implored him to stay a little longer and help them to build a similar one and he consented. There is a great wave of church building in the islands now, and the people care very much to have them beautiful, and will often build the churches of coral, or even of stone (although their own houses are woven of wicker-work), and they inlay the ends of the seats, lecterns, etc., with mother of pearl or shell, as they used to do their great war canoes. The historian of the Melanesian Mission, David Hilliard (1978:173) commented: When completed in 1901, after seven years' work by the people of the village, it was the first building of its kind in the Solomons and the most elaborate yet built in the island diocese. Like the Patteson Memorial Chapel at Norfolk Island, it had a semi- circular apse and was dedicated to St. Barnabas. Its fame spread throughout the south- east Solomons, and its example was followed by Christian communities elsewhere in Ulawa and south Malaita. The expensive corrugated iron roof on the church had been the special ambition of Clement Marau, and his success in achieving this, with the help of the money from the sale of the Auckland canoe, greatly enhanced his personal prestige. Clement's difficulties in obtaining suitable tools and new materials illustrates how some materials from the outside world only reached Melanesia at great personal and financial cost. The dealings around these materials illuminate the workings of an early colonial society. On a wider scale, the corrugated iron roof at Madoa can be seen as one early example of the introduction of corrugated iron into a Pacific economy. The rapid spread of corrugated iron as a long-lasting material conferring high status soon became familiar across the Pacific. But so much of this development here at Ulawa depended on the personal status of Clement Marau. As Hilliard (1978:173) commented: Marau s disgrace in 1 907 for visiting village women at night after the evening bell had rung and his punishment of those who knew of his adulteries caused the once- flourishing Ulawa church to almost disintegrate in a resurgence of pagan customs and religious rites. THE MELANESIAN MISSION AND SOLOMON ISLANDS CULTURES The Melanesian Mission was known for its relaxed permissive attitude towards certain aspects of traditional Melanesian culture. There was no blanket prohibition of betel nut chewing, smoking, traditional dancing, mourning rites, Christian attendance at pagan feasts or the payment of bride price. Also the Mission made explicit provision for the Christian blessing of canoes, nets, houses, gardens and other customary activities (Hilliard 1978:196-197). Many of the earlier church buildings were constructed to the form of traditional custom houses with</page><page sequence="31">ULAWA CANOE 35 some of their decorations continued. Some active encouragement was given by European missionaries to the retention of native handicrafts and their use in the decoration of village churches. The continued use of cone shell and nautilus shell inlay on introduced forms including church furniture and equipment was part of this wider permissive attitude. In his new church, Clement planned to apply shell inlay to the ends of the pews, the chalices, the lectern and the credence or Holy Table {SCL IV(43):10, Nov 1898). After his 1924 fieldwork, Ivens (1927:48) later reported, The church at Mwado'a has its altar and reredos inlaid with 5,000 pieces of cut pearl nautilus shell. The dove (with lambent rays) on the top of the reredos, a triumph of inlaying work, was done by Robert Marau [a son of Clement]. This permissive and ambivalent attitude of the Melanesian Mission towards traditional Ulawan culture is also apparent in the building and disposal of the Auckland Museum Ulawa canoe. This small canoe embodied several different meanings for the groups of people involved in its manufacture and subsequent life-history. For Clement Marau and the Ulawa people who made it, the canoe was a means to show outsiders something of the rich symbolism of their traditional culture. It was a symbol of the best effort and best skills their culture could muster. However, for Clement Marau and the Ulawa Christians, it was also a means to a greater end, one way available for them to raise money for their church roof. As such, it was already being considered as a commodity, made expressly to sell to the highest bidder. When seen within the context of Ulawan society, this shift to a canoe as a commodity was not such a huge step as might be imagined. As traditional exporters of full-size canoes to other areas of the south-east Solomons, Ulawans were accustomed to the idea of trading and selling their new canoes. For Clement himself, the sale of curios as an important source of income was not a new idea, as he had already raised the money for his bride-price by learning to do shell inlay work in Ulawan style for sale. After his visit to Ulawa in 1892, Montgomery (1908:218) commented: Ulawa is famous for its bowls and model canoes and woodwork inlaid with mother-of- pearl. The ship [Southern Cross ] does not buy anything on Sunday; but on Monday morning as soon as it was light the bargaining was very brisk, and bowls and tobacco changed hands to a very large extent. This trade in artefacts shows that the Ulawa people were used to supplying demand from outsiders for their artworks. They had already realised the value of their artworks as something that outsiders valued and coveted. Clement simply expanded the idea of producing art commodities to include a full-size canoe. Ivens sometimes claimed that this canoe had been built expressly for sale at his, Ivens , suggestion. Regardless of whether it was Marau or Ivens who initiated the project, the question is raised regarding the amount of shell inlay on the canoe. If this was a conscious attempt to make a better one than ever seen before, then it may well have been more elaborately decorated than usual. Certainly Ivens promoted the canoe as, "perfect - such a good specimen has never been offered for sale before &amp; the people say that they never turned out such a piece of work before." Thus, for the missionaries, this canoe was the best ever made and the best ever offered for sale. As such, they regarded it as a perfect example of the power of Christianity to motivate its converts for a better life. For the Auckland Museum of the time, this canoe sufficed as an example of a traditional</page><page sequence="32">36 NEICH bonito canoe. As will be seen below, the museum rejected the chance of obtaining another canoe from Ulawa because it already had this as an example. ULAWAN CANOES AND BOWLS AS COMMODITIES Both the Madoa Church and the Auckland Museum bonito canoe were moments or episodes within an ongoing production of artefacts on Ulawa which included objects made for local use, objects made expressly for sale, and objects which moved from local use to sale. On many of these, shell inlay with conus or nautilus shell continued and developed as a hallmark of Ulawan and Solomon Islands origin. There are indications that during the later nineteenth century, the art of shell inlay had been changing from a specialised, ritually prescribed technique to a democratised practice open to anybody with the patience and skill. Ivens (1927:472) described how on Ulawa in former times, a man who was engaged in inlaying a la o canoe would stay in the canoe house until his work was finished. If he had to go outside, he wrapped himself in a pandanus umbrella to conceal his identity. The ostensible explanation given for this was the need to keep the sun off him, otherwise it would cause the parinarium putty to soften and fail to fix the la o shell inlays into place. And no women were allowed to see the decorated canoes used in bonito fishing. By the 1 880s this restricted access to the shell inlay craft must have been softening, when Clement Marau, an outsider, was allowed to inlay bowls for sale. By 1 897, the inlay on the Auckland Museum bonito canoe was "done by the people as a whole". By 1904, Ivens was advertising his skill at inlaying and offering to add inlay as required. And by 1925 as will be shown below, an Ulawan canoe builder was offering to add inlay purely for effect to meet European buyers' preferences. Fig. 22.

Enlarged traditional comb from Tulagi, south-east Solomons (AM 13628) decorated with symbols of cross and church architecture. Photo: Auckland Museum. Melanesian Mission influence had a strong effect with regard to the acceptance and encouragement of shell inlay on all these categories of objects, whether canoes, bowls (Fig. 22) or church furniture. This church encouragement of inlay and the influence of Christian symbols also penetrated back into the production of traditional forms of artefacts. Examples of this are a Solomon Islands wooden comb (Fig. 23) with shell inlay set among elements of church architecture, or many objects featuring a cross as decoration and sign of the owner s conversion to Christianity. Clement Marau's production and sale of Ulawa-style inlaid bowls to raise his bride-price money leads to the intriguing question of how many inlaid bowls collected from Ulawa during the 1 880s and 1 890s were actually made by a Merlav man, that is Clement Marau, living on Ulawa. In a very revealing letter, Ivens (Ivens to Cheeesman, 1 1 Feb 1904, Auckland Museum files) shows how the tastes of European purchasers began to influence the production of commercialised artefacts on Ulawa. He also naively indicated the extent of his own involvement in the manufacture and sale of curios from Ulawa. Cheeseman had recently declined to purchase an Ulawa bowl because he thought that it was too plain to arouse the interest of the Auckland public. Ivens writes: It was a revelation to me re the public's taste . . . Your remarks re inlaying of bowls has set me to work - I have here two more large bowls given by Ulawa people for sale to provide money for roofing their church. I am having them inlaid here [at St Barnabas, Norfolk Island] now by Ulawa men - the actual shell to inlay each costs me nearly a pound to buy. One of them might possibly suit you when it has been inlaid; the most likely one is over 7ft. in length including handles ... You may take my assurance that both of these will be well inlaid</page><page sequence="34">38 NEICH for I myself am no novice in the art of inlaying. One must I suppose put a price on the bowls so that you may have some basis to work on - £5 or £6 would to my mind represent a fair price. They must be sold and I shall take them myself to NZ in November if I cannot find a purchaser. Comins and Ivens had a strong influence on the building of the Madoa church and the Auckland canoe. Ivens' letter quoted above gives some indication of their wider influence, especially with regard to the acceptance and encouragement of shell inlay on objects made for sale to outsiders. In his review of the significance of the Melanesian Mission for museum artefact collections, Stanley (1994:36) suggested that new syncretic objects, often featuring shell inlay and Christian symbolism, had a central importance for the Mission in bridging the old and new orders and providing legitimation for the new. He sees missionary collecting of these objects as a sign of searching for cultural continuity. All these motivations are no doubt true but this present study also indicates a more practical purpose behind missionary promotion of distinctive shell-inlaid objects. This was the need to raise money for the mission and the need of individual poorly- paid missionaries to raise money for themselves and their families, a point also made by Stanley. Stanley hesitates to suggest that some of these syncretic objects may have been collected with the thought of future missionary exhibitions in mind, but in view of the role of Ivens in artefact production documented here it may not even be too far fetched to suppose that some objects were actually manufactured with this purpose in mind. For the western Solomons, Waite (1999) has demonstrated how the figurehead or nguzunguzu from traditional headhunting canoes has been tamed and made into a symbol of the modern Solomon Islands. In the south-east Solomons, the same role has been assumed by the ceremonial bowl with black surface and shell inlay that has made the transition to modern national symbol (Davenport 1 997; Mead 1 979). This study has perhaps revealed some of the Melanesian Missions influence on this transition. THE PERSISTENCE OF THE ULAWA CANOE As was noted above, the last pagan canoe rituals and initiations took place in Madoa in about 1860. At Madoa in 1924, Ivens (1927:xvii) found "only one elder who had known the old days". Two other villages on Ulawa had held malaohu feasts in the early 1920s and Ivens (1927:132) expected that these two villages might still hold them again in the future. Of the 900 people living in nine villages on Ulawa by 1924, there were fewer than 40 men over 50 years of age, and only three villages were still heathen. Pessimistically, Ivens (1 927: 146) described one of the few old men making a bonito canoe at Sa a on Malaita in 1925, expecting that, "with the passing of the bonito catching the zest for canoe building will pass too". In 1925 on his return from his last fieldwork in Ulawa, Ivens wrote to Cheeseman in a letter that reveals the changing attitudes towards canoe rituals and the commodification of their associated artforms on Ulawa: A native on Ulawa has a large inlaid canoe for sale - the length is 24 feet - it is a full- sized three man canoe (seating four). The inlay work is of nautilus shell set in patterns representing frigate birds, three on each side with conventional designs in between - these are on the top plank. Sections of cone shell, white semicircular, run the length of the canoe on both sides and also across the upraised stem and stern. The usual streamers of strips of the umbrella palm dyed red adorn the stem and the stem. The canoe is fitted out with paddles. It is a good specimen of the inlaid Ulawa canoe. You have a small one</page><page sequence="35">ULAWA CANOE 39 man canoe in the museum from Ulawa, but the decoration is of nautilus shell only. This one has the la'o cone shell in addition. For the one in the museum £12 was paid. The price asked for the three man canoe is £28 to £30. I promised the man that I would make enquiries about the sale. The Southern Cross could pick it up next year and I am sure Captain Burgess would see to its being carried safely. Payment would have to be made to the owner - partly in money and partly in tobacco. This could easily be arranged. The native priest in charge of Ulawa, Rev. Martin Marau [son of Clement] , would act as a go-between for the Captain. The agreement with the owner was that I was to write to Martin Marau and inform him as to whether a sale had been made. In this event the owner was to put certain finishing touches to the inlaying, getting in as much shell as possible so as to make the canoe look really well - for as I told him canoes sell by reason of the inlay rather than of their sea-worthiness where white people are concerned... As you will realise, the opportunities for securing such things grow less and less every year - the natives are ceasing to produce such things. When I saw the canoe at Ulawa I realised that here was a chance to procure a really good article. (Ivens to Cheeseman, 18 Sep 1925, Auckland Museum files) Obviously, by this time the message about the preference of European buyers for more elaborate shell inlay had become a standard part of the arrangement in producing objects for sale to collectors. Sadly, Auckland Museum declined to purchase this larger Ulawa canoe, commenting that it already had "the type at least represented" (Cheeseman to Ivens, 20 Oct 1925, Auckland Museum files). Some published accounts describe the continuation of the malaohu or maraufu initiation ceremonies in the south-east Solomons into the twentieth century. This implies that bonito canoes were still active for these ceremonies to be complete. An initiation ceremony was held at Natagera on Santa Ana in the late 1920s (Mead 1973a). Bernatzik (1935:Fig. 14) figures an "enormous festal dish, modelled on the bonito fishing canoe, used for the initiation festival at Ngora-Ngora", indicating that an initiation ceremony for young boys took place at Ngo rango ra on the northern tip of Ulawa in 1932 or thereabouts. Using photographs taken by American military visitors to elicit participants' memories, Mead (1973a) described the last malaohu bonito initiation held in the village of Gupuna on Santa Ana in 1943. Bonito canoes were involved in these ceremonies and some are visible in the photographs taken at the time. Davenport reported (1990:124, note 5) that the only fleet of specialised bonito canoes still operating in the 1 960s in the eastern Solomon Islands, according to the practice of the traditional religion, was maintained by the important men of one group on Santa Catalina. Writing of Star Harbour, San Cristobal, in the period of 1970-1971 , Mead (1973b:22) was pessimistic about the future of the bonito canoe. He noted only two functioning bonito canoes in Santa Ana and about ten in Santa Catalina, but none on the mainland of San Cristobal. He believed that their days were numbered, because the foundation of the bonito canoe cult had been undercut by conversion to Christianity and because bonito can be caught more efficiently from a dugout canoe powered by an outboard motor. However, by the 1970s bonito canoes had still not become extinct on Ulawa, where they were seen by Pendergrast in 1973 and Hendren (1976:152-153) in the early 1970s. Perhaps a similar situation developed here on Ulawa as described by Davenport (1990:100) on Santa Catalina in the 1960s. There, devout Christians could still build and maintain ancestor memorial bonito canoes for catching bonito to eat, but they must avoid all associations with the bonito canoes dedicated to tutelary deities, as still used by pagan islanders.</page><page sequence="36">40 NEICH CONCLUSION Many strands have been entwined in this study. It now remains to separate some of these aspects and assess what has been added to the documentation and understanding of Ulawan history and culture. At the most obvious level, by adding a third Ulawa canoe to the corpus of museum-held examples, this study has provided an opportunity to add further information to published descriptions of Ulawa bonito canoes, with regard to basic construction and decorations. With the aid of Ivens' letter, it has also been possible to increase our understanding of the symbolism of Ulawa bonito canoes. Although very similar in construction and decoration to the bonito canoes from Santa Ana, Santa Catalina and San Cristobal, this Ulawa canoe is distinguished by the darker colour of its planks and the richness of its shell-inlay decorations along the mid- sides of the canoe, especially the frontal frigate birds and the akalo ni matawa. Whether these extra shell inlay figures are a normal feature of Ulawa bonito canoes or a sign of the special purpose of this particular canoe is a moot point. Parallel to the construction and symbolism of the Ulawa bonito canoe, this study documents the building of an important new Pacific Island church that had a pivotal role in furthering the development of church building in this part of the Pacific. Therefore, a better understanding of the contexts and motivations involved in the building of the Madoa church is critical for future studies of the history of northern Vanuatu and Solomon Islands church architecture. Beattie s magnificent photographic documentation of the Madoa church and many other smaller local church buildings throughout the area deserves to be better known and better utilised. By concentrating on the critical case of the Madoa church, some appreciation can be gained of the processes of introduction of new tools, new technologies and new materials into this part of the Pacific. Coral blocks sawn with a rusty broken cross-cut saw, stones dressed for the chancel floor using large numbers of steel axes instead of more appropriate masons' hammers, mortised joints, a builder's level contrived of split bamboo, and the people's excitement at the efficiency of an augur, all illustrate the intensive labour and individual learning and adjustments involved in the introduction of new technologies. On a socio-political level, by expanding the analysis beyond the actual artefacts of church and canoes into the wider social context, this study has been able to provide a more detailed and concrete description of the introduction of Christianity to Ulawa than was previously available. By examining the socio-political context of production for both the canoe and the church, the 'baggage of the transcultural encounter' in which these two artefacts were created has been unpacked' to a greater extent. This clarification raises some interesting questions for the notion of artefactual authenticity. These questions of authenticity need to be considered against the background of the commodification of artefacts and the early development of tourist art in Ulawa. Several years before the Auckland bonito canoe was built, a trade in model canoes and inlaid bowls had already developed. The Auckland Museum wanted to regard their bonito canoe as a straightforward unproblematic example of an Ulawan bonito canoe. However, the analysis pursued here has highlighted some of the traces of the complex transcultural encounter inscribed in this artefact. While the museum thought that it could treat this canoe as a traditional artefact, in fact both the 'traditional' canoe and the 'introduced' church were created in very similar situations. Even though European influence may not be obvious in the canoe at first sight, it is there, embedded in the object. For those seeking a pure 'authentic' Ulawan bonito canoe, the role of the Melanesian Mission in the creation of this one would be seen as a complication better forgotten. For these seekers of</page><page sequence="37">ULAWA CANOE 41 authenticity, the notion would become even more problematic when the hands-on involvement in artefact production by Rev. Clement Marau, and perhaps even Rev. Walter Ivens, has to be taken into account. However, by tracking the development of artefact commodity production in one small Pacific island, a deeper appreciation of the richness and complexity of the situation of production is now possible. In effect, the canoe has now gained a more authentic' history, and a history within which the Melanesian Missions role is better understood. Consequently, this study provides an early example of the role of a Christian mission as a major player in the commodification of artefacts, a role repeated in many other areas of the modern Pacific. And even further in the case of Ulawa and the south-east Solomons generally, this study has illuminated the role of the Melanesian Mission in the development of inlaid bowls as another national symbol for the Solomon Islands, matching the comparable development of nguzunguzu canoe figureheads as a national symbol from the western Solomons. From one perspective, this canoe can be regarded as an example of those numerous objects collected during the heyday of ethnological collecting in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which on closer research now turn out to be replicas produced for sale at the time of their manufacture. However, it must be remembered that as artefacts move through space and time between cultures, they have the potential to shift and slide between categories, regarded sometimes as artefact, sometimes as art, sometimes as replica, and sometimes as commodity. In view of Davenports (1968:22) observation that sacred bonito canoes and their canoe houses are the main locus where "the secular domain of man intersects with the sacred domain of the deities", it is tempting to treat church buildings also in this light. Churches then replaced bonito canoes and canoe houses as the main locus representing man's relationship to his new 'tutelary deity', the Christian god. Such a suggested simple replacement is probably too convenient for a very complicated process. Any hypothesis along these lines for Ulawa would need a systematic analysis of the passing of canoe houses and custom houses village by village as Christianity progressed. Did bonito canoes and canoe houses pass away at the same time as the church arrived or earlier or later? Why did Madoa cease holding its malaohu ceremonies so early? Why, how and where has the bonito canoe persisted in parts of Ulawa? Acknowledgements. I thank Mick Pendergrast for information supplied and for his comments on the text.

WEBSTER, J. 1866 The Last Cruise of the "Wanderer". Sydney, Cunninghame. NOTES 1 . The Southern Cross Log (SCL) was first published as a monthly journal in Auckland as a New Zealand and Australia edition starting in 1 895 and later also as an English edition starting in 1 900. Because of the editorial design of this publication, it is not always possible to determine the author of particular contributions. Consequently some quotes used here can only be referenced to the SCL. The Southern Cross Log was named after the mission ship owned by the Melanesian Mission of the Anglican Church. The Melanesian Mission had moved its headquarters to Norfolk Island in 1867, but the mission ship continued to be based and serviced in Auckland. From Auckland, the Southern Cross made regular annual voyages of about five month's duration to visit all of the mission's stations throughout the Melanesia islands. 2. John Watt Beattie (1859-1930) was a prominent photographer of portraits and landscape based in Hobart, Tasmania. In 1 906 the Bishop of Melanesia, the Right Rev. Dr Wilson invited him to travel on the Melanesian Mission steamer, the Southern Cross , on its annual five months voyage around Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. Beattie exposed about 1,300 plates on this voyage and kept a diary of the trip. Virtually all of these negatives were purchased by Auckland Museum in 1933, three years after the photographer's death. In his diary of the 1906 Southern Cross voyage, Beattie (Mss RS 29/3, p. 24, Royal Society of Tasmania) describes their arrival at 6 am on Wednesday 3 October off Madoa on Ulawa, "where Rev. Clement Marau the foremost clergyman of the Mission resides - he is a Melanesian". An hour later, Beattie got ashore, "The landing was very rocky, and it looked dangerous to look behind and see the curling white breakers coming on as though they would overwhelm you. The Bishop invariably takes the steer oar, and is an expert boatman. Madoa is a large village, very clean, with a very fine church, stone walls with galvanised iron roof. I got one or two characteristic photographs and then back to the ship again". The ship called at Madoa again on Monday 29 October for two hours and Beattie was able to take more photographs. Next day they called at other Ulawa stations, starting with Lenga, then Marata and finally Ahia, along the coast to the south-east. At Ahia, Beattie met many people who had not yet become Christians; "they remain in their old time ways and are very dirty and smelly in consequence. Still they are interesting . . . They have a very fine and large gamal [custom house] here, the best I have seen yet. There are many carvings of a somewhat 'loud' order, fine food bowls, and other native manufactures useful and ornamental. I got the gamal with some of the occupants." R.
