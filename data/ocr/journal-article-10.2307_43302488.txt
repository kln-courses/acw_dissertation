<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review Article Imaging Wisdom. Seeing and Knowing in the Art of Indian Bud- dhism by Jacob N. Kinnard, Curzon, London, 1999, xii+210 pp. 16 b/w ills., acknowl., list of figs., bibl., ind. £ 7.95. Erberto Lo Bue This book focuses on the context of ideas and practices surrounding the visual representation of the concept of prajnā in India between the 8th and 1 1th centu- ries, and explores the role played by the production and use of images related to such concept in Indian medieval Buddhist religious practice. The English noun "wisdom" is adopted throughout the text to render the Sanskrit prajnā (Pāli: pañña ), a choice exclusively dictated by lexical convenience, since the author acknowledges that such translation is prosaic and perhaps ambiguous (p.80). The various meanings of the term Prajflāpāramitā as explained by Stcherbatsky are reported by the author on p.31, n.36. The expression "art of Indian Bud- dhism" in the subtitle actually refers to Buddhist sculpture produced during the period in which the Pāla dynasty ruled north-eastern India, though the religious images analysed and illustrated in the book were not necessarily produced within the boundaries of the Pāla kingdom. The use of the expression "Pāla pe- riod" throughout this work is justified by the author with the circumstance that Indian historians themselves adopt dynastic divisions to date images (p.48). The text is divided into seven chapters and is preceded by acknowledgements (pp.viii-ix) and list of figures (pp.x-xi), and followed by bibliographic refer- ences - both primary and secondary (pp. 182-206) - and an index (pp.207-210). Chapter One ("Imagining Images"; pp. 1-24), is, in Kinnard's own words, a "rather general methodological discussion laying the theoretical groundwork for the author's examination of some of the broad concepts involved in the Buddhist creation and use of artistic images" (p.2). Chapter Two ("Present Presence, Pre- sent Absence"; pp.25-44) deals with the importance of the physical presence of the Buddha - whether real or represented - and with the problems raised by his physical absence, whereas the strategies adopted by Buddhists to cope with Šāk- yamuni's absence are analysed in Chapter Three ("Imaging and Imagining the Buddha"; pp.45-78). Kinnard turns to the specific dynamics of prajnā in Chapter Four ("The Im- age of Wisdom"; pp.79- 1 13), dealing with the overall importance of prajnā in Buddhist literature and with the ways in which "wisdom" is expressed through two ubiquitous representations of the Buddha during the Pāla period: the one making the "earth-touching" gesture and the one displaying the gesture of "turning the wheel of the doctrine". In chapter Five ("Representing Prajflāpāra- mitā"; pp.1 14-147) Kinnard deals with the personification of prajnā in the form of the goddess Prajflāpāramitā ("Perfection of Wisdom") as from the 8th century, examining the supremacy of the Prajflāpāramitā texts and their use as objects of veneration, as well as the rationale behind the shift from the veneration of the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW ARTICLE 69 physical remains of the Buddha to that of the prajnāpāramitā viewed as the source of Sâkyamuni's awakening, and discussing also a few iconographie fea- tures of Prajftāpāramitā and Cundā, two related and often indistinguishable god- desses sharing an iconographie constant: the book (p. 146). In Chapter Six ("The Book is the Thing"; pp. 148- 175), Kinnard interprets the "iconographie explosion of books" that occurred from the 10th century onwards, when texts appeared in the iconography of several deities and were even vener- ated per se, as a synthesis of the rûpakâya and dharmakâya as well as of vision and wisdom (p. 149). In the last chapter ("Seeing and Knowing"; pp. 1 76- 181), the author summarizes what he has argued in the previous chapters and empha- sizes the importance of "seeing" vs. "hearing" in the process of enlightenment (p. 180), insisting on the importance of the creative tension between seeing and knowing - vision and wisdom - which runs through the Mahâyâna tradition, and exemplifying the ongoing transformation undergone by Pāla-period images in a modern religious - though not necessarily Buddhist - context. Kinnard's study is based on the assumption that it is impossible to under- stand how and why a Buddhist image - or, for that matter, any religious im- age-is produced and perceived, without comprehending at least some of the thoughts and practices preceding it (p.5): hence the author's concern with meth- odology and his discussion - initially based on Catherine Bell's Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice - of the dominant ways (psychological, functionalist, structural) adopted by Western scholars, from Freud onwards, to view religious images. Kinnard does not approve of art critics who see in works of art meanings that artists have never intended. He shares Panofski's emphasis on situating a work of art within its social and historical context, and on the need of studying the complex of ideas going in its production and reception (pp.19 and 132). Being aware of the impact of extra-artistic factors (pp.13 1-132) in the production of religious art works, he further suggests that "all images are local" inasmuch as they are always located in a specific context (p.22), which cannot be identified with a single textual source, but corresponds to a whole field of texts, practices and ideas (p. 132). The author's broad point is that "visual images are something like a language, but they are not merely language" (p.24). Kinnard challenges the "intellectual" trend of studying religions on the basis of their textual production, of regarding religious images as mere illustrations of texts and of leaving the study of relig- ious images to art historians (p. 16). Images cannot be reduced to the status of the verbal (p.20) and - Kinnard argues - scholars dealing with religious studies should find room for the visual, too (p. 13): religious images are also meant for illiterate people and it is doubtful that ordinary Buddhists used texts to interpret the complexities of the late Buddhist pantheon (p. 137). In the author's view, the current focus on texts has created an incomplete picture obscuring some vital aspects of Buddhist thought and practice (p. 12). Following Gadamer, Kinnard believes that an image has an ontological significance in its own right and serves to "complete" the ontology of its prototype; hence Buddhist images "do not simply represent the Buddha and the various deities in the Mahâyâna pantheon", but are "dynamically involved" (p.42) in the production of religious meaning.</page><page sequence="3">70 THE TIBET JOURNAL Also the author's discussion on the "presence" of the divine in sacred objects is based on a careful review of the opinions of several scholars (including Schopen, Strong, Eckel, Marion, Kasulis, Gadamer as well as Mus) on the issue. Going beyond Gombrich and Tambiah's opposite stances concerning precept and practice, Kinnard suggests that the circumstance that what people do is not necessarily what they say they do (Gombrich's view) does not correspond to a static dichotomy (p.43): precept and practice "are not two distinct categories, but two overlapping discourses that mutually inform one another" (p.39). He further points out that the embodied presence of the divine is not a mere, invariable ei- ther/or phenomenon and cannot be reduced to plain utterances such as "either it really is the divine in the stone or the stone symbolizes or refers to the divine" (p.43). Though appreciating Evans-Pritchard's attempt to get at indigenous catego- ries, Kinnard finds a particularly suitable way of looking at religious doctrines, and of explaining how practitioners relate to them in Bourdieu's concepts of habitus - namely the largely unconscious field of perception, thought and action set within the historical and social conditions of its production - and theory of practice. In his own words, the author attempts "to tease out the range of the possibilities of the habitus " of images, which necessarily entails the intents of those responsible for their construction "as well as the various ways in which such images would or could have been received" (p. 179). According to Kinnard, practitioners relate to religious doctrines in a dynamically dialectical state of flux in which they deal with unforeseen and ever-changing situations "in a man- ner that is neither predetermined nor unconscious, but always a matter of ten- sion"; it is such tension - he argues - "that is at play in the Buddhist conceptions of the absence/presence of the Buddha in images" and also accounts for the fact that a devotee is able to view the Buddha as present in an image that is regarded at the same time as a reminder of his absence, thus maintaining simultaneously "an ontological and a semantic/symbolic position on the presence of the Bud- dha" (p. 11). Having pointed out that in the Pāli canon there is no reference to images of the Buddha (p.65), Kinnard suggests that such images should be seen as part of a dialectical process: they are unnecessary, except in the absence of the Buddha. Quoting a passage from Eckel's study on the Buddhist philosopher Bhāvaviveka (To See the Buddha) stating that "any particular representation of the Buddha (including the physical Buddha himself) is inadequate to represent the Buddha in the deepest sense", Kinnard argues that, since to Bhāvaviveka the reality of šunyata (emptiness) is dominant, "the question of the Buddha's presence is in fact always a question of absence" (p.33). Absence and presence are bound to coexist: a representation of the Buddha shows the reality of his absence (there- fore embodying sunyata ), at the same time making available his presence (p.42). Having suggested that Buddhists started making images of the Buddha in order to fill the gap between the absence and presence of Sâkyamuni, the author argues that various Buddhist texts reflect the Buddha's followers' desire to be in the presence of the Buddha in order to listen to his teachings (the emphasis be- ing on seeing as well as hearing), though - following Lamotte - he emphasizes the lateness of such textual traditions: it was only after a long period of</page><page sequence="4">REVIEW ARTICLE 71 "absence" of Sâkyamuni that the Buddha had to be made present in a lifelike manner - not just through symbols - in the mind of meditators, and eventually his visual representation came to be not only accepted, but even encouraged. Thus the Pratyutpanna-buddha-saijimukhâvasthita-samâdhi-sûtra incites to "paint pictures well, and construct images" of the Buddha (p.77), while the Vimutimagga states that "if a man wishes to meditate on the Buddha, he should worship Buddha images and such other objects" (p.75). In the course of time Sâkyamuni became a figure more to be venerated than to be emulated (p.76). But how could the representation of the Buddha be reconciled with the fact that attachment to the physical body is pointless and even a hindrance, since the vision of the Buddha and the vision of his doctrine are in fact the same? The author analyses a passage quoted by Strong in The Legend and Cult of Upa - gupta, where Upagupta asks Māra to represent the Buddha in a physical image (pp.3 1-32) in spite of the fact that from a doctrinal standpoint such image is an illusion. Kinnard explains the episode not merely as an attempt to express the congruence of doctrine (precept) and practice, but rather as a " self-conscious reflection on their incongruence " (pp.37-38). Applying Kasulis's methodology, he interprets Upagupta's comment as a dynamic play between metaphysics (as represented by precept), praxis (as represented by practice) and metapraxis: in spite of his awareness that Sâkyamuni has gone altogether to extinction (meta- physics), Upagupta bows down in front of the Buddha's image fashioned by Māra (praxis), but does not fall into the trap of regarding such representation as real (metapraxis) (p.41). Kinnard suggests that the same kind of metapractical reflection underlies the famous story of Prasenajit, one of the clearest - and per- haps earliest - justifications for making images of the Buddha (pp.70 and 78). In a similar way Šāntideva, though using images to illustrate the emptiness of all forms and to demonstrate the centrality of prajnā in leading to the realization of truth, refers to a wide range of verses from different texts describing and pre- scribing the worship of the Buddha also through images, and explicitly linking the vision of the Buddha with the development of prajnā (p.96). Again, Kinnard interprets this position in the sense that images function in a metapractical way, as a means of reflection on the relationship between precept and practice: al- though images are not ultimately real, it is implied that they are effective on a mundane level, inasmuch as they earn merit to the devotee or may fulfill her/his wishes (pp.99- 100). So - the author argues - the emphasis on visual images in the Mahäyäna was the result of a gradually developed, multilayered habitus which was developed to respond to the absence of the Buddha (pp.7 1-72). See- ing religious images, just like seeing the Buddha, came to be linked with a true understanding of his teachings and with progress on the path of enlightenment (p.63), and the very equation of vision and knowledge became a central compo- nent in the visual representations of Sâkyamuni during the Pāla period (p.62). The discussion on actual images begins in what the author regards as the "second half' (p.45) of the book, starting from chapter Three, where he exam- ines "the various strategies available to medieval Indian Buddhists for making the Buddha present" and attempts to reconstruct the context in which works of art were produced. Kinnard argues that such works do not merely illustrate or narrate significant events in the Buddha's life: they also make available the</page><page sequence="5">72 THE TIBET JOURNAL Buddha's prajnā (p.80), a characteristic which - in spite of its absence from the standard lists of what constitutes buddhahood (p.96, n.52) - had started playing an important role in early Buddhism. The author argues that major motifs in early Buddhist art, such as the bodhi tree, already imply the centrality of pañña and that it is a wisdom-centered habitus that underlies the later visual represen- tations of prajnā (pp.85-86). In Pāli literature pañña is the insight into the nature of things, leading directly to enlightenment (p.81): it is an active epistemological faculty going right to the heart of the nature of things (p,82); in iconographie terms its function may be represented by the emblem of the bodhisattva Mañjusrl, the sword, which is related by the author to the sword used to dig an anthill in a parable reported in the Vammlka Sutta (pp.83-84). Kinnard argues that the innovative tantric component of Buddhism during the Pāla period has been overemphasized by scholars such as Tāranātha, Dutt and Conze, and insists on the fluid and composite character of the religious milieu in medieval northern India, where conservative Buddhists - particularly at Bodhgayä - were strong enough to dare melt down consecrated images and turn them into coins, as reported by Tāranātha himself (p.53). In the midst of such fluidity, however, Kinnard detects one constant: a continuous and renewed in- terest in prajftā, as shown by the production of commentaries on the much ear- lier Prajnāpāramitā literature, of a very high number of copies of Prajnāpāra - mitā texts and of related images, hence the emphasis on prajnā during the Pāla period appears to have been textual as much as visual (p.56). The author thus attempts to place the iconography of the goddess Prajftā- pāramitā in the larger context of the representation of praj't iā he discusses (p. 135). The application of such criterion is particularly useful because - as in the case of other deities - there is no Indian text describing the iconographie origin and development of Prajfiāpāramitā: while images of the goddesses were made from at least the 9th century, the earliest written sources describing her iconography date in fact to the 12th century (p. 134), and most of the statues de- picting her are bronzes dating to the 10n century (p. 135). Here it should be pointed out that, although Kinnard criticizes the art historians' one-to-one cor- relation between a specific image and a text, he does not dismiss the importance of the relationship of religious art with religious writing and regularly resorts to texts when analysing the environment in which images were produced: discuss- ing the Prajnāpāramitā context, in particular, he starts from the ninth chapter of Sāntideva's Bodhicaryãvatãra , which he regards as an important Pāla-period source for the contemporary conception of prajnā and for its relevance to sculptural representations (p.87). Having acknowledged the role played by the Prajnāpāramitā genre in the context in which images of the goddess of the Perfection of Wisdom were pro- duced (p. 133), Kinnard further analyses the Astasāhasrikāprajnāpāramitā in connection with the issue of the relative merits of reverence towards the relics of the Buddha and of reverence towards the book itself: according to the compilers of that very text, venerating the book is more efficacious than worshipping Šāk- yamuni's physical remains, since the latter derive from the source of the Bud- dha's knowledge and wisdom, namely from the very prajnāpāramitā (pp.1 18- 1 19) which supports them (pp.88-90). Incidentally, the author views such new</page><page sequence="6">REVIEW ARTICLE 73 attitude towards the book as revealing of the level of competition the redactors of the Prajftāpāramitā texts faced in the Buddhist milieu in which they operated (p. 116). According to the author, the shift that occurred from the conception of the book as a mere container to that of the book as dharma meant that the Prajftā- pāramitā came to represent the dharmakâya, the true body of teachings (pp. 120- 121). The book in itself, regarded as a container of perfection, became the teacher (p. 139) and an object of cult. It was not a matter of reading and learning the text, therefore, but of worshipping it as a religious object; the book started to function as a relic or an image would (p. 122): just as the vision of the images of the Buddha could lead to the understanding of the dharma (p. 146), so seeing and honouring the Prajftāpāramitā allowed the devotee to partake of the wisdom it contained. Within the same Mahâyâna context, the author argues, devotional vision began to take precedence over learning and recitation (p. 123), and the devotional shift that had brought to the development of the cult of the book eventually gave rise to the representation of the Prajftāpāramitā as a goddess. Kinnard further suggests that the persistent concern with prajftā in the religious art of the Pāla period led to the fact that the book eventually became a standard iconographie motif associated not only with the goddesses Prajftāpāramitā and Cundā, but also with the bodhisattvas Mañjusri and, occasionally, Avalokit- ešvara (pp. 164- 165). Kinnard suggests that the above factors brought about a new attitude towards images. For example, the emphasis on the prajftāpāramitā teachings during the Pāla period must have conditioned the way medieval Buddhists perceived stat- ues represented in the gesture of turning the wheel of the doctrine, no longer seen as a mere symbol of Sâkyamuni's first sermon, but now representing also the Perfection of Wisdom. Not only the Buddha, but even the goddess Prajftā- pāramitā and the bodhisattva Mañjusri came to be portrayed in that particular gesture: to medieval Buddhists the Perfection of Wisdom was at the heart of the dharma , inasmuch it allowed the dharma to be known and caused its wheel to be turned (p. 105). Also the gesture of touching the earth - which immediately preceded Sâkyamuni's awakening - must have been felt to be connected with prajftā (p. 108), since there is no enlightenment without the realization of empti- ness and no realization of emptiness without prajftā (p.99). Hence - the author argues - what is most important "is not whether an individual image depicts Prajftāpāramitā or Cundā or Tārā, but that such an image clearly is intended to represent and present prajftā' ' (p. 142, n.74). Following Susan Huntington, Kinnard explains the shift in iconographie em- phasis from the gesture of "turning the wheel of the doctrine" to that of "touch- ing the earth" during the Pāla period with the circumstance that Sārnāth - where Sâkyamuni started "turning the wheel of the doctrine" - was the pre-eminent place in the Buddhist world during the Gupta period, whereas Bodhgayâ - the site of full enlightenment - lay within the Pāla realm: the author argues that Sâkyamuni figures prominently in the "icono-Zog/c" of images produced in the Pāla milieu and that the prominence of the gesture of touching the earth seems to be a conservative move in contrast with the expanded notions of Buddhahood that prevailed in contemporary tantras (pp. 109-1 1 1). According to Kinnard,</page><page sequence="7">74 THE TIBET JOURNAL many of the Pāla-period images representing Säkyamuni have been arbitrarily identified with the cosmic Buddha Akçobhya on the mere grounds that they are portrayed in the gesture of "touching the earth" - shared by both Buddhas - whereas such images are in fact "decidedly polyvalent and involve a kind of scale of meanings, a variety of devotional and hermeneutical possibilities" (p. 112). From an iconographie point of view the most interesting chapter in the book is probably the fifth, where Kinnard argues that the textual discourse on the prajnāpāramitā underlies and leads to the sculptural representation of the corre- sponding goddess. The application of Bourdieu's theory and of a methodology based on the analysis of the religious and cultural habitus in which images are produced, of the contemporary field of praxis; and of the complex range of dis- cursive and visual practices available to Buddhists (p. 137), is best exemplified by Kinnard's analysis of a 9th century statue of the goddess Prajñápáramitá flanked by two lotuses supporting the text she symbolizes and displaying a teaching gesture, while sitting on a lion-throne showing a couple of devotees with a deer (pp. 135-141; fig.l). The iconography of this image leads Kinnard to suggest that the supremacy of the Prajnāpāramitā was an essential component in the field of practice in 9th century Bihar, where the statue was found (p. 138), and that no text, but the habitus of such an image made its symbolism clear to the devotee (p. 139), who could identify with the hearer of the true dharma , associating both the gesture and the deer to Sâkyamuni's first sermon at Sārnāth, to the Prajnāpāramitā (p. 141) as well as to the books embodying the prajnā that had allowed Šákyamuni to reach enlightenment and sustained his teaching. In other words, such a representation of the Prajflàpâramitã plays on the con- scious and subconscious associations and implications involved in the represen- tations of the Buddha, "co-opting his place of preeminence by co-opting his ico- nography" (p. 140), without usurping the place occupied by the image of Säkya- muni, which remained predominant throughout the Pāla period (p. 141). In fact the relatively small number of statues of Prajflāpāramitā justifies Snellgrove's remark (quoted on p. 142) that the goddess did not attain a great cult in India. Indeed, though Prajñápáramitá is "the teacher par excellence " and "the source and originator of the dharma ", she is "not a mother goddess at all" (p. 141). Examining the rationale of the shift from the worship of the physical remains of Säkyamuni to that of the Prajflāpāramitā as the source of the Buddha's awak- ening, hence teacher - and "mothçr" in a purely metaphorical sense - of all the Buddhas, Kinnard does away with the Western neo-Buddhist notion of Prajflā- pāramitā as a "mother goddess", arguing that such misrepresentation is basically rooted in Beai and tonze's incorrect interpretations of passages from Faxian's Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms and from the Afpasahāsrikā Prajnāpāramitā. Such interpretations, narrowly literal and out of context, have been uncritically accepted by a stream of scholars who did not scrutinize the texts translated by Beai and Conze (pp. 125- 130). In fact also Mafljušri jis referred to as "mother" as well as "father" of all the Buddhas, always in a metaphorical sense (p. 159). That the cult of Prajflāpāramitā was the cult of the text the goddess symbolizes - and not of a "mother goddess" - is confirmed by the fact that the book became an</page><page sequence="8">REVIEW ARTICLE 75 object of veneration per se, and as such it was represented even in religious art works. Another important chapter, interesting also from an iconographie point of view, is the sixth, where the author deals with the self-referential ity of the Prajnãpãramitã literature, a vast portion of which is devoted to praising the text itself and to describing the advantages of reciting, writing, and venerating the actual book. Kinnard discusses the relevance of the so-called "cult of the book" to visual practices during the late Pāla period, following the emergence of an overall focus on books as a consequence of an intense scholastic activity in Buddhist monasteries (pp.150 and 152): Mahâyãna scholars of the period were intimately associated with texts through a variety of exegetical and hermeneuti- cal devices, to the point of being, it would seem, "somewhat obsessed with them" (p. 151), and contemporary Buddhists came to envisage the book as an object not only of study or recitation, but also of mere contemplation in itself (p. 152). This new trend resulted from a broader attitude concerning religious invoca- tions in the shape of dhāraņh , condensed texts as well as texts in general, which were seen as sources of sacred power (cf. p. 154, n.17) to the point that some Buddhist authors posited the superiority of religious invocations to relics (p. 155) and that the verses stamped on clay tablets (sãccha' cf. Tib. tsha tsha) ended up embodying "nuggets of prajña " (p. 156): the written word had become a signifi- cant object in itself (p. 152). Some of the stone images reproduced in the book show details with the worship of the text represented in the form of a book, though the main subject of the steles is always anthropomorphic; in that respect the author's statement that the text was represented "on its own" (p. 149) or "per se" (p. 176) is better qualified on p. 171: sculptures began to be fashioned that included images of the book set upon a pedestal. Though the interdisciplinary approach of the book (anthropological as much as philological, historical as well as iconographical) makes its reading occasion- ally demanding, the reader receives the author's constant help and support: every thesis is expounded at the beginning of each chapter and every demon- stration is summarized at its conclusion. In his discussions the author goes straight to the point and avoids unnecessary emphasis or repetitions. The result is a neatly articulated and remarkably clear text, lending itself only to minor criticism. One wonders, for instance, at the notion of "female bodhisattva " implied by a statement on pp.1 11-112: "the Buddha adds that Màra cannot really hinder the Bodhisattva who truly applies his or herself'. Since bodhisattva is a term of masculine gender and does not seem to be applied to female beings in the Ma- hàyãna texts analysed by the author, it would have been useful to quote the original Sanskrit text to justify the use of the pronoun "herself'. That is the only point in which the author seems to refer - albeit indirectly - to a category of "female bodhisattva s", although he never describes either of the wisdom god- desses he analyses - Prajftāpāramitā and Cundā - as "female bodhisattva Such expression is not found in Indian Buddhist texts, but appears in Tibetan histori- cal literature with reference to high-ranking ladies, as well as in Western neo- Buddhist, mother-wishing or post-feminist agendas with reference to Buddhist</page><page sequence="9">76 THE TIBET JOURNAL goddesses: the current use of the terms "male bodhisattvď and "female bodhi- sattva " seems to reflect contemporary West-centered projections and preoccu- pations rather than the application of philological evidence. The author's focus on sculpture does not reflect a choice of dealing with statuary rather than with painting, but rather appears to follow the circumstance that virtually nothing is left of the painting produced during the rule of the Pála dynasty. Thus the adjectives "iconographie" or "artistic" might have suitably replaced "sculptural" in expressions such as: "emphasis on prajnā in Buddhist sculptural and discursive practice in the Pāla period" (p. 169). Finally, the state- ment that six or seven hundred years after the ninth or tenth century Bodhgayâ was not inhabited by Buddhist monks (p. 181) is not accurate in the light of the information afforded by 'Jigs med grags pa in his history of the kingdom of Gyantse (1481). In fact the king of Gyantse hosted the abbot of Bodhgayà, who was travelling to China - where he had been invited by the emperor Chengzu - , for two months in 1414; the abbot, Šri Šāriputra, is even painted - wearing a characteristic pointed red hat - in one of the temples in the main monastic building at Gyantse. One may add that some of the remarks contained in Kinnard's work apply also to the Nepal Valley - to which Pāla-period India provided a cultural model in more than one way: like Pāla rulers, the kings of the Nepal Valley supported Vaisņavism as well as Buddhism; the popularity of the Prajnāpāramitā literature is reflected in the many copies that were made of its texts in the Valley; and the aesthetics and iconography of Pāla art influenced Newar artists for centuries to come. In fact the popularity of the Prajnāpāramitā extended to Kashmir - where artists fashioned images portraying Avalokitešvara with the book (see for instance Amy Heller, Tibetan Art , Milan: Jaca Book, 1999, p.62, n.33, and p.72, fig.33) - , Gilgit and Tibet, where huge manuscripts of the Prajnāpāramitā are preserved in monasteries such as Sakya and Gyantse (where a precious 15th century copy of the book is carried in procession). Indeed, both in Tibet and in the Nepal Valley religious texts, besides being read and studied, have been also worshipped. Such situation seems to reflect precisely the habitus described by Kinnard with reference to the Pāla period (cf. pp. 173- 175); after all, to quote Eckel as reported by the author, "To see something is to know it more directly than to hear about it through words" (p. 180). The unpretentiousness of the two-line biographical note in the back cover flap is admirable, but may have the effect of making those who are not acquainted with the author curious to know more about his work. Only a couple of Kin- nard's articles are mentioned in the bibliography, but the amount and variety of relevant sources selected and studied is impressive, and their skilful use proves that the materials had been fully and profitably assimilated. The book is well produced and does credit not only to the author, but also to the general editors of "Curzon Critical Studies in Buddhism" as well as to the publishers, who have already issued seven books in the same series, besides other interesting works in the "Durham Indological Series". It is a pleasure to have real footnotes, at the bottom of pages, and the 16 black-and-white illustra- tions carefully selected by the author are finely printed on glossy paper.</page><page sequence="10">REVIEW ARTICLE 77 I only wish to point out a few misprints in view of a possible reprint of the book: "is that what have" (p.28, line 18); "God gives the gift of out of this love" (p.36, n.40); "a direct connections" (p.67); " prasentiď (p.70, line 2); "Decca Museum" (captions of figs. 14 and 15); "proceed this one" (p.86, n.23); "to creat" and "has point out" (p. 101); "have already see" (p. 108); "Bodhgays" (p.l 1 1, n.99); "been located Bohdgayâ" (p. 135, n.53); "the presence ... empha- size" (p. 141); "in the Nālandā" (p. 146); Pratītyasumutpādagāthā (p. 154); "in- speakably" (p. 155); "posses" (p. 169). Furthermore the use of the Wade-Giles system in the transliteration of the titles Tao-hsing Ching (p.77) and Fang-Po Ching (p. 159) is inconsistent with the adoption of the pinyin system for Chinese names elsewhere in the text. Finally, the bibliografie reference to Gellner's study on the use of the text of "The Perfection of Wisdom" (p. 191) should read "Alessandria: Edizioni dell'Orso and Turin: CeSMEO". Kinnard's work provides an excellent model of how iconographie analysis should be contextual ized; not only it demonstrates a methodology that may fa- cilitate a new and fruitful approach to art works, but it also expands our under- standing of Buddhism. Being concerned with problems of methodology as well as with the study of images as an important aspect of religious experience, Im- aging Wisdom is highly recommended both to students in the field of religion and to art historians, all too often forgetful of the ways textual discourses inter- act with devotional practices "on the ground". 4</page></plain_text>
