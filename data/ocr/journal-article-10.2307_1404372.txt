<plain_text><page sequence="1">120 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS BORDERLANDS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION The three books here under review once again show how Jewish and Muslim culture, apart from being living forces in their own right and apart from acting upon one another, have greatly influenced Western Christian civilization in certain phases of its history and have been strongly influenced by it. While they are thus of great interest for the elucidation of Western culture through comparison and contrast, the main purpose and value of these books are, of course, their contributions to the understanding of the history and of the religious and cultural characters of Judaism and Islam themselves. 1. The book by G. Scholem, Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, a work which, since its first publication in 1941 (the present edition is revised), has become something of a classic, is a profound study of some of the deepest aspirations of Jewish faith and piety. It contains an excellent in- terpretation of the Kabbalah ("Tradition"), the esoteric Jewish doctrine which developed in the Middle Ages and has ever since formed the core of Jewish mysticism, also influencing Christian mystics from Ramon Lull to Pico della Mirandola and from Erasmus and Reuchlin to Jacob Boehme, not to mention Rosicrucians and Freemasons. As Scholem explains in chapter 2 on Merkabah-mysticism-mystical specu- lation on the throne of God and the heavenly halls and palaces-Kabbalism grew out of late antique gnosticism and has always preserved a more or less gnostic character blending easily with neo-platonic ideas of emanation. In the Kabbalah as well as in the pagan, Jewish and heretical Christian gnosis the mythical element is very strong; to keep this element within the boundaries of Jewish orthodox monotheism was one of the prime concerns of the Kab- balists and other Jewish mystics. On the relation between myth and mysticism in general Scholem in the first chapter of his book propounds an interesting theory which, in fact, forms the basis for his interpretation of Jewish mysticism m particular. Mysticism in the strict sense for him represents a late phase of religious development, following upon the first or mythical stage, in which the world is "full of gods," and the second stage in which the "break-through" of revealed and institutional religion occurs which destroys the mythological "dream-harmony of Man, Universe and God," thus creating "a vast abyss" between God and Man. Mysticism then "may be called the romantic period of religion" in which an attempt is made to find "the secret that will close the abyss, the hidden path that will span it." Such a definition of mysticism is possibly too narrow to embrace mystical experience in general, but it does at least serve as a useful heuristic hypothesis in explaining the tension between ~1.

In opposition to nineteenth and twentieth century rationalistic Jewish historians, Scholem undertakes to vindicate the true religious value of Jewish mysticism, the "elusive something" in mythical and pantheistic thought which he thinks compatible with monotheism and which, in his eyes, is a "quest for the hidden life of the transcendent element in ... creation." In view, espe- cially, of the messianic Kabbalah of Issac Luria (see below), it may, perhaps, be said that the deepest meaning of this quest is a sub-conscious and unin- tentional yearning for divine incarnation, never appeased within the Jewish religion. Kabbalism proper and related mystical movements such as German Hasid- ism reached their first bloom in the central part of the Middle Ages, a period to which chapters 3 to 6 of Scholem's book are dedicated. The most important of all Kabbalistic works is the famous Zohar (Sefer Ha-Zohar, that is Book of Splendor) of late thirteenth century Spain, the attribution of which to Moses de Leon Professor Scholem upholds with strong reasons. In this work we meet the most characteristic ideas of the mediaeval Kabbalah with their peculiar gnostic-neoplatonic flavor: such as the En-Sof, the infinite hidden God, or the ten Sefiroth, emanations or spheres of divine life in the descrip- tion of which the Kabbalists at times come particularly close to gnostic anthropomorphic aeon-mythology as they do also in the concept of Adam Kadmon, the primordial man, who antedates the creation of the visible world including the biblical Adam, whose fall must be mended by Tikkun, the res- toration of unity between God and the world. It is in this mediaeval period, too, that we find clear evidence of a quasi-magical type of Kabbalism (which was and still is often enough erroneously believed to be its only one), espe- cially in the works of the Spanish Jew Abraham Abulafia (second half of the thirteenth century), which lead from the meditation of the Holy Name of God and of the Hebrew alphabet to an almost magical system of ever new combinations of the sacred letters as a road to ecstasy. (The relation, incident- ally, of Ramon Lull's Ars Magna to Abulafia's Kabbalah would be worth while investigating.) It is of the highest interest to see how in one of the most revolutionary periods of European history, in the sixteenth century--under the impact, in par- ticular, of the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492-the blissful world of the Zohar, a world of almost purely contemplative esoteric theosophy, was transformed into that of the much more problematic, elaborate, dynamic and socially influential Kabbalah of Isaac Luria (died 1572) and his contempor- aries, which finally found a strange sequel in the mystical heresy of the false Messiah Sabbatai Zevi of Smyrna (died 1676) and his followers, in Sabbatianism. The Lurianic Kabbalah-the most brilliant outgrowth of the Kabbalistic school of Safed in Palestine which also produced the more systematic work of Moses Cordovero-represents the second height of Jewish mysticism and went far beyond the mediaeval Kabbalah in popular influence throughout the diaspora. Scholem demonstrates in a fascinating manner that the fundamental</page><page sequence="3">122 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS innovation of the Lurianic Kabbalah consists in the exaltation of the historic fact of Jewish exile into a mystical metahistorical and metaphysical principle and how this development was caused at least in part by the increasingly catastrophic turn which Jewish history took after the great exodus from Spain. Luria's three principal ideas are, first, the Tsimtsum, the withdrawal of God into Himself in which He, as it were, exiles Himself from His totality into deep concentration and seclusion, thus abandoning a kind of mystical primor- dial space into which He feturns in creation and revelation; secondly, the Shevirath Ha-Kelim, the Breaking of the Vessels of divine light, a cathartic- and again exile-like--process, necessary for the cleansing of the divine Sefiroth themselves from all evil; and thirdly, a definitely messianic re-interpretation of Tikkun or restoration, which is supplemented by emphasis upon the reincarna- tion of the not yet purified (spiritually exiled) souls and by a mystical and even magical technique of prayer as effective preparation for the messianic age which will terminate the historical as well as the metaphysical exile of Israel and of the world. Scholem rightly points out the Manichee character of this doctrine accord- ing to which evil-symbolized by exile-is rooted in the realm of the divine itself. This essential trait of the Lurianic Kabbalah goes far in explaining how the actual messianic movement of Sabbatianism, that arose less than a hundred years after the death of Luria and the other great mystics of Safed, could grow up around the person of a "Messiah" who was a manic-depressive, com- pelled by the nature of his illness to commit anti-nomian acts, and who finally under duress was driven into the consummation of sin by his apostasy from Judaism to Islam. The tragedy of the apostate Messiah Sabbatai Zevi could be interpreted by the Sabbatians as the savior's necessary and redeeming descent into the realm of evil and even inspire fake conversions of entire Sabbatian groups to other religions. While the conversion of the Sabbatian Jacob Frank and his followers to Catholicism around 1750 would, I believe, still bear further investigation, Scholem's linking up of Sabbatianism with the two main trends of modem Judaism-cosmopolitan liberal reform-Judaism and modem Polish-Ukrainian Hasidism-appears thoroughly convincing. Modem Hasidism which, incidentally, has no direct relation to mediaeval German Hasidism, is through the works of Martin Buber more generally known than other forms of Jewish mysticism. Scholem in his last chapter draws a sympa- thetic picture of it which, like the rest of the book, gives a moving view of Jewish mystical piety--alongside not a few absurdities. The mystical fervor of the Jewish Kabbalist and Hasid, probing into the mysteries of God, is at any rate strangely incongruous with the prejudices and atrocities of anti- semitism. Jewish mysticism could not disarm the murderers of Auschwitz or Buchenwald and the perpetrators of other pogroms, but we may hope that it made some of the victims bear more easily the tortures and death inflicted upon them. 2. The book by Professor von Grunebaum of the University of Chicago, which, like that of Scholem, grew out of a series of lectures, has as its subject Mediaeval Muslim culture envisaged in some of its principal aspects. Chapter headings like the Mood of the Times, the Religious Foundation, the Body</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 123 Politic, the Human Ideal, Self-Expression in Literature and History, etc., clearly indicate what the author set out to do: not to give a systematic intro- duction into the civilization of the early Islamic period, but rather "to trace the temper and flavor of the Muslim Middle Ages," a purpose in which in the opinion not only of this reviewer, but also of competent Arabists such as G. Levi della Vida (in American Historical Review, vol. LII [19471 pp. 495 ff) and E. J. Jurji (in Speculum, vol. XXII r19471 pp. 100 ff.) he has succeeded extremely well. The emphasis of the work lies primarily on Muslim literature in the widest sense of the term, this being von Grunebaum's particu- lar field (of special interest in this respect is chapter 9 on Greek influence upon Arabian Nights), and secondarily on the social manifestations of re- ligious and political life. Fine art is left out altogether as the writer considered it "outside his ken." Theology and philosophy are dealt with mainly in their social repercussions-and not without the odd disturbing remark about "many a theology ridden century" or about Muslims mysticism's failure exactly to define the human mind's limitations "in the manner of a Kantian critique of pure reason." Problematic aspects of institutional history such as Islamic feudalism are only just touched upon. But notwithstanding such limitations, von Grunebaum has with real skill built up a many-colored mosaic image of "the Muslim Man" not easily to be forgotten. True the book only rarely catches the immediate aliveness of the best pages of the Koran or the magic spell of the Arabian Nights-whoever has read Hugo von Hofmannsthal's few pages on the Arabian Nights will know what I mean-but it does possess a sober firmness of intellectual appreciation which is probably the best kind of preparation a scholar can give to those who want to study a foreign culture. It is one of the strangest facts about the strange culture of Islam that it is at the same time so far from us as a finished product and so near to us through some of the essential elements-Greek, Jewish and Christian-of which it is composed and which chiefly formed the atmosphere of its mediaeval growing- period which was also the age of our own growth. Von Grunebaum's first two chapters on the relation of Islam to Eastern and Western Christendom in the Middle Ages are, therefore, among the most interesting of the book and, together with chapter 7 on the Muslims' human ideal, constitute a considerable contribution to cultural history. Von Grunebaum rightly calls his book a study in cultural orientation. There is, especially, one chain of interrelated observations which seems to be of general significance for the understanding of the Islamic world. The educational ideal of the Muslims became progressively literary: the rhetorical tradition of late Antiquity was perpetuated by upholding style, elegance and encyclopaedic information as the highest intellectual aims of an eminently civilized society which, however, was not humanistic in the sense of being interested "in the richest possible unfolding and evolving of man's potential- ities." This basic attitude is reflected equally strongly, though in different ways, in science, politics and religion. The occupation with Greek science-- for the preservation and transmission of which mediaeval Islam has, neverthe- less, done so much--did in the consensus of the educated Muslims never advance beyond the criteria of usefulness, either practical or social. There</page><page sequence="5">124 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS was great appreciation of knowledge, but only in so far as it contributed either to the material well-being or to the intellectual entertainment, that is to the literary culture, of the lettered classes. In the politico-religious sphere, the blatant failure of Islamic civilization to conform reality even remotely to the primitive ideal of Muslim theocracy was in part due to the literal and literary approach to the Koran and to tradition, which discouraged reform and thus neglected one of the most vital forms in which historical life takes its course. In this respect, too, "wording outranked meaning." Despotism and bureaucracy--how convenient, incidentally, for the head of the secret police to be at the same time postmaster general!-polygamy and harem-miscegenation: these were c9mplementary aspects of the sensuous beauty of the Arabian Nights and of the whole sophisticated culture of mediaeval Bagdad or Cairo or Cor- dova. Still another aspect was mysticism the radical forms of which-as in the case of the Jewish Kabbalah--were altogether subversive of the original religious tenets, and like Jewish mysticism could lead to pantheism and anti- nomianism. Von Grunebaum gives a rather detailed characterization of the mystical and largely neoplatonic gnosis of the Sufis as well as of the political mysticism of certain Shiite sects. The mystical groups of the latter type believed that a perfect Imam (Leader) or Mahdi (the Righteously Guided) would appear as a Logos-like incarnation of God. They thus produced the only genuine reform-idea conceived of by Islam and, at the same time, a deep alteration of Mohammed's own religion with its radical rejection of all divine incarnation. In practice this idea created little except the fanaticism which led to the sterile violence of the mediaeval Assassin-sect or of the late nineteenth century Mahdi of the Sudan. 3. Brockelmann's History of the Islamic Peoples, a translation of a German work of 1939 by the well known authority on Islam, covers the entire field, except for the Muslims of India and the Far East. It is chiefly a history of political and religious developments, but the main cultural and intellectual trends are also sketched as far as it was possible in a work of this scope. The chief value of the book is practical in the sense that it is a convenient, concise and full reference work. Unfortunately, the translation is slightly marred by the fact that the concentrated style of the German original is not always quite clearly rendered-so it is at times nearly impossible to guess to what person or people a term like "the latter" refers. There are good indices of personal and place names, but no glossary of Arabic and other oriental language terms is given. The book is divided into five main sections: The Arabs and the Arab Empire (to ca. 750), the Islamic Empire and Its Dissolution (to ca. 1258), the Ottoman Turks as the leading power in Islam, Islam in the nineteenth century, the Islamic States af the (First) World War, followed by a review of events from 1939 to 1947 by one of the translators. The chapters on the Ottoman Turks and on modem Islam in general are for obvious reasons treated in greater detail than the rest. Not every reader will share the author's enthusiasm for Kemal's totalitarianism in Turkey or his views on the success of that experiment. The treatment of the Palestine</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 125 problem-as if it had been created solely by British imperialism-is such that the translators found it necessary to add a warning in a footnote. As in so many books of this kind, not a few matters which would seem to be of primary interest to a student of universal history have been neglected: so, for instance, nothing is said about the character of Mohammed's visions or the controversial problem of his literacy. The relations of Islamic to Western his- tory are treated not less sketchily than the usual treatment of Islamic history in the histories of Europe. Almost nothing, for instance, can be learned about the role of the Emperor John VI Cantacuzenus in bringing the Ottoman Turks to Europe and thus facilitating their conquest of the Byzantine Empire. The utopian philosophical novel of Averroes, contemporary and fellow-countryman of Ibn-Tufayl, is mentioned, but the obvious question of its possible influence on St. Thomas More's Utopia (via Pico della Mirandola, who translated into Latin a Hebrew version of the novel and whose life More wrote) is not con- sidered. These remarks are not meant to dispute the real usefulness of Brockel- mann's work as a storehouse of information on Islamic history. -GERHART B. LADNER</page></plain_text>
