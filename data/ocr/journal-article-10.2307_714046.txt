<plain_text><page sequence="1">300 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW A recent trend seen in fascicles of the Corpus Vasorum is the more comprehensive provision of profile drawings, which reflects greater recent interest in potting as well as painting, or at least in the whole vase and not merely its decoration. CVA Berlin 7, like other recent publications, includes some images produced radiographically. Profile drawings produced by conventional methods have their drawbacks, not least the practical difficulties of measuring the thickness of the walls of closed shapes. Real anomalies in potting may go unrecognized, because the inner surface of a complete vessel cannot be seen. The exhibition of the Theodor material allowed an opportunity for the vases to be put through the CT scanner of the Academic Medical Centre of the University of Amsterdam, and each entry here is accompanied by a scanned image. This reveals the interior surface of a vessel very clearly. Winifred van der Put illustrates in an appendix the future possibilities of the technique for ceramic studies with scans of two lekythoi by the Gela Painter, clearly produced by the same potter, who had a difficulty in centring the cylinder demonstrated by the uneven thickness of the wall; the lowest point of the interior is lower than the top surface of the foot. A conventional profile drawing might reveal the latter, but the irregular wall-thickness would be very unlikely to emerge in the process of measuring-up a complete lekythos. That the two vases came from the same potter seems undeniable, and further studies of such scanned material could have important consequences for the understanding of Athenian workshop practices and techniques. Together with the treatment given here to the wider context of standard subject matter on these vessels, we have the conditions in which to expand the study of an important craft tradition which very occasionally gave rise to masterpieces of decorative art, rather than an art form with a depressing underclass of substandard products. University of Glasgow ELIZABETH MOIGNARD V. KARAGEORGHIS, R. LAFFINEUR, F. VANDENABEELE (edd.): Four Thousand Years of Images on Cypriote Pottery. Proceedings of the Third International Conference of Cypriote Studies, Nicosia, 3-4 May 1996. Pp. 174, 1 ill. Brussels, Liege, and Nicosia: A. G. Leventis Foundation, 1997. Paper. ISBN: 9963-560-31-8. This volume contains the papers delivered at the Third International Conference of Cypriote Studies (1996). Previous conferences considered Cypriote Terracottas (1989) and Cypriote Stone Sculpture (1993), and this volume emulates its two predecessors in publishing the proceedings within two years of the conference. The four thousand years of its title cover the Chalcolithic down to the Roman period; of the fifteen papers, ten are in English and five are in French. There is particular attention paid to the range of striking zoomorphic designs, with papers devoted to the subject by Annie Caubet and Robert Merrillees on 'Les askoi anthropomorphes et zoomorphes aux periodes CA et CM', Marguerite Yon on 'Rhytons zoomorphes et vases figuratifs au Bronze Recent', Nota Kourou on 'Cypriot Zoomorphic Askoi of the Early Iron Age. A Cypro-Aegean Interplay', and Antoine Herman, on 'Vases a embouchure en forme de tete animale a l'age du Fer'. In each case the papers are free-standing, and presumably have been published much as delivered in conference form; in consequence we miss the element of editorial interaction between papers, so that, for example, there is no cross-reference between Caubet &amp; Merrillees and Kourou. The volume opens with a brief survey of 'Incised and Painted Human Figures in the Neolithic and Bronze Age' by Paul Astrom: examples are few, and Astrom extends his survey to include Middle Bronze Age Cycladic, Helladic, Minoan, and Near Eastern, as well as Cypriot. Against this background, he pleads for a comprehensive survey of the representation, and meaning, of gesture in all facets of Cypriot artwork, a plea which it is to be hoped will not go unheeded. The theme of human, as well as animal, representation is taken up for the transitional stage between the last phase of the Cypriot Bronze Age (Late Cypriot IIIB) and the Early Iron Age by Maria Iacovou in 'Images in Silhouette: the Missing Link of the Figurative Representations on Eleventh Century BC Cypriote Pottery'. Again, the material is limited, in this case to Proto-White Painted Ware in LCIIIB, and to a mere eleven examples of it at that; however, Iacovou adds a previously unpublished Proto-White Painted askos which resurfaced in 1996, probably originating from the necropolis of Alaas. Particularly striking amongst the images on these twelve vases discussed by Iacovou is the warrior on a kalathos from Palaepaphos, dressed in a short tunic, with helmet, greaves, and long sword with tasselled sheath, whom she considers ?

However, it is the sudden appearance of silhouette portrayal which is the most important feature of Proto-White Ware, and I. maintains the Syro-Palestine affinities of the technique against a proposed Minoan origin. A modified form of this latter is presented by Vassos Karageorghis in 'The Pictorial Style in Vase-painting of the Early Cypro-Geometric Period'. K. engages with I.'s earlier The Pictorial Pottery of Eleventh Century BC Cyprus (Goteborg, 1988) rather than her conference paper, pointing to larnakes of LM Crete as possible prototypes, whilst stressing the role of the native painter in thus fusing influences from both Aegean and Levant into the distinctive Cypriot pictorial style. Similarly Louise Steel in 'Pictorial White Slip-The Discovery of a New Ceramic Style in Cyprus', discussing a fragmentary White Slip krater discovered at Kalavasos in 1994, takes full account of the oriental connotations as well as the elements of Mycenaean pictorial style in its decoration, but nevertheless gives proper emphasis to it as a local response to these external influences. Other subjects covered in this wide-ranging volume include Ellen Herscher on 'Representational Relief on Early and Middle Cypriot Pottery', Karin Nys on 'Vases with Anthropomorphic Protomes in the Cypro-Geometric and Cypro-Archaic Periods (1050-475 BC)', Helene Cassimatis on 'Le rhyton a Chypre a l'epoque historique', Frieda Vandenabeele on 'The Pictorial Decoration of the Cypriote Jugs with Figurines Holding an Oinochoe', Demetrios Michaelides on 'Magenta Ware in Cyprus Once More', Robert Laffineur on 'The Cypriote Ring-Vases Reconsidered', and Antoine Hermary on 'Le "style d'Amathonte" '. For this breadth of subject matter and, in particular, for the speed of publication, there is inevitably a price to pay: spelling and typographical errors-'long-robbed figure', 'to a large extend'-are numerous; there is a serious displacement of plates illustrating Iacovou's piece-in her catalogue vase no. 4 is plate XIIc (not XIIIa), no. 5 is XIIIa (not XIIIb), no. 6 is XIIIb (not XIIIc), no. 7 is XIIIc (not XIIId), no. 8 is XIIId (not XIIIe), no. 10 is XIIIe (not XIVb), no. 11 is XIVb (not XIVc), on p. 64 vase no. 12 is plates XIVc and XIVVd (not XIVd and XVa), and the kalathos discussed on p. 67 is plate XVa (not XVb), whilst plate XVb receives no acknowledgement in the text; plate XIIc is reproduced at XIXb but, once again, we miss editorial cross-reference; in Nota Kourou's Early Iron Age categorization of zoomorphic askoi (p. 90) her plates are XXIVa-d (not XIVa-d). At times these flaws can be distracting rather than merely irritating; and although the significance of the individual contributions offers adequate compensation, they collectively lack the cohesion which the importance of the subject so clearly merits.

RUTTER: Lerna: A Preclassical Site in the Argolid: Results of Excavations Conducted by The American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Vol. III: The Pottery of Lerna IV. Pp. xxxvi + 780, 5 plans, 125 figs, 21 pls. Princeton: The American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 1995. $120. ISBN: 0-87661-226-5. This impressive tome comes hedged about with mildly defensive background information about the history of its parent excavation, and the circumstances in which the work on its material was done; in fact the joins are not evident to anyone but those already possessed of the knowledge, and the difficulty of what Jeremy Rutter was asked to do is transparent, not least because archaeological method has moved on in the forty years since the original excavation. Lerna, in the Argolid, is regarded as the type-site for the pre-Mycenaean period in southern Greece; Lerna IV, to which the pottery series typologized here belongs, is the Early Helladic III settlement which follows the destruction of the House of the Tiles. Lerna was originally excavated in the 1950s, and reported in Hesperia by John L. Caskey, the then Director of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens; ill-health and other commitments meant that he did not see the project to completion; Lerna I (1969) and Lerna II (1971) deal with fauna and people respectively, and the American School is now engaged in extending the series and particularly in initiating publication of the artefacts from the site.
