IVY GEORGE Weinberger-Thomas's Ashes of Immortality employs extensive textual analysis and fieldwork to study the practice of Hindu widows burning themselves on their husbands' funeral pyres in India. The author notes that widow-burning is only one form of funerary ceremonials that in- volves the voluntary death of certain survivors. The practice is rooted in notions of settling debt, debts of obligation and love that the survivor feels toward the deceased master. The practice is crucial to maintaining a particular social ecology in the Hindu socio-religious realm. Male sub- jects of a deceased king also voluntarily surrendered themselves on the royal pyre. Suicide as an act of loyalty is but one form of other suicides that are votive, devotional, and expiatory in intent and often directed at the divine and not necessarily a mortal master. Weinberger-Thomas does a remarkable job of clearing the cobwebs of conventional ethnocentric prejudice that sees sati as an antiquated form of patriarchal violence against widows. Rather, a satf is a rare woman (hence, a rare practice) who is vested with exceptional divine energy and</page><page sequence="2">180 IvY GEORGE consents to violence, thereby "shattering the circuits of the phenomenal world, of that ineluctable series of rebirths and redeaths, [to] at last cross over the ford that leads to immortality" (219). Contrary to popular perception, the practice of widow-burning is not a Hindu religious injunction, although Hindu priests and families have appropriated the practice. Nevertheless, according to the vast dharma treatises, the death of the husband is understood as a consequence of the wife's sinfulness, and fire was the ultimate means of experiencing expia- tion and healing. The widow's "fire-bath" on the funeral pyre of the husband was a most auspicious opportunity for purification, redemption, and union. According to the dharma texts that recommend the custom, the sati who abandons herself on her husband's funeral pyre purifies through her death three sets of lineages for three to seven generations: her husband's, her mother's, and her father's. Thus, the sati's sacrifice be- comes an "offering to the ancestors and a source of liberation for the living" (84). Over time, the practice of sati has become emblematic of conjugal love and family stability, which is foundational for social order and the maintenance of racial purity. In the mind of the Hindu tradition- alist, a ban on the practice of sati is tantamount to violating the sacredness of Hinduism and consequently damaging to Indian national integration. Widow-burning may be seen variously as a form of murder, suicide, or sacrifice, or because the son of the deceased lights the pyre, it can also be seen as a matricide. The thousands of men and women who are in atten- dance at the event are implicated by virtue of their presence in a sort of collective homicide. The distinction between suicide and sacrifice is more nuanced, as sati can pass as suicide in the sense of a voluntary death, whereas a sacrifice is prompted by external influences, such as divine inspiration and cultural injunctions. Weinberger-Thomas draws on Durk- heim's theoretical formulations of the various forms of suicide. She sug- gests that while Durkheim may have classified sati as a form of altruistic suicide because the widow is committed to unity with and dependence on her deceased husband, it is in fact more like an egoistic suicide given that the widow chooses to partake in, and therefore complete, the program of her redemption. The husband's death is "a mere device for furthering the plot" (167). From such a standpoint, a woman's "sati-hood" signifies her sacredness, rather than her subordinated status. Weinberger-Thomas notes that despite a legislative ban on the practice of sati, it holds a pervasive sway in the consciousness of a variety of Hindus. Sati is "embedded in a mental and affective universe, transmitted through multifarious channels, and making the rhythm of an important aspect of people's religious lives," therefore giving rise to what is gener- ally understood as tradition (188). From a positivist standpoint, Weinberger-Thomas conducts a superb study of the practice of sati. She cannot be faulted for being an Orientalist</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 181 voyeur. She strenuously resists Western tendencies to classify sati as a "fanatical" practice in "lower societies." Weinberger-Thomas presents sati as the appropriation of the female body and mind for the purpose of patriarchal dominance in the name of religion and social status. Yet one is struck by the almost detached, equanimous engagement in the face of a clearly heinous and violent practice that interrupts the fullness of female life. At points, Weinberger-Thomas's status as a Western scholar handicaps her analysis of the Indian social context. Her discussion of the Hindu understanding of a "bad death" is a case in point. Dying in bed can pollute the dead person because she has died away from the earth, which is pure. Dying in one's bed-every Westerner's dream-is the worst of natural deaths for the Hindu because that position, of being neither here nor there, will be reenacted by the dying individual in his next life: he will be born neither in heaven nor on earth, but rather as a spirit doomed to wander in the intermedi- ate region. (68) Does the bed represent a foreign item of furniture introduced into some of the indigenous communities? If so, is it seen as a threat to prevailing beliefs around death? Conversely, are bed deaths included in the catalogue of "bad deaths" as a form of religious resistance to technological change? Weinberger-Thomas's presumption that the reader is male is puzzling, not only given the subject of study, but also in light of the attempts at gender-inclusive writing in the social sciences. Additionally, the broader question of whether the incidence of sati in the semi-urban classes in India as a reaction to the internal and external forces of modernization and globalization is not addressed. Nevertheless, Weinberger-Thomas pro- vides us with an excellent survey of the subject of sati in its regional, religious, cultural, and historical variety. Susan C. Seymour's Women, Family, and Child Care in India in Transition is a longitudinal study (from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s in the Indian city of Bhubaneswar) on extended families' adaptation to social change brought on by urbanization and modernization. She is particularly interested in how women and children are affected by this change. Seymour shows that the ideal patrifocal joint family varies in its gender dynamics by class and caste status, ethnic and religious identity, intergenerational differences, rural versus urban residence, and regional location. She suggests that the principal medium of modernization in Bhubaneswar has been the availability of Western-style secular schooling and its influence on the aspirations, occupations, and social status of the local residents. In Bhubaneswar, modernization does not represent an abrupt break in tradition; rather, new institutions are introduced against the backdrop of established social structures and cultural traditions. Bhubaneswar, an</page><page sequence="4">182 IvY GEORGE ancient temple town dating back to the early centuries B.C.E., was chosen in the 1940s as the seat of government for the newly created Indian state of Orissa. Seymour studies the "Old Town," which was the old temple town, and the "New Capital" where new government offices and housing were constructed in the 1950s. While middle- and upper-status families in the Old Town and the New Capital have been increasingly open to the new educational opportunities for women, women are still expected to place their interests second to that of the other household members. In this sense, the higher education of women was seen as enhancing their marriageability; personal aspira- tions for employment were not considered relevant. Educated women's success in family and careers depended on the degree of support received from their husbands and in-laws. When career women met with resis- tance from family members for their new-found independence, marital and family strife resulted. Traditional patrifocal family values require that family members carry out their obligations toward one another on the basis of age, gender, and filial relations. Seymour shows in her intergenerational interviews with women that the nature of these obligations is changing. Thus, where financial aid was rendered freely in the past to family members in need, now financial aid is seen as a kind of investment with the expectation of some form of repayment. Filial kindness and help now have an instrumen- tal quality. Female respondents identify the education of wives as a singular locus of change in terms of their self-assertion and opposition to the collective demands of the patrifocal family. Clearly, Seymour perceives the advent of modernization, urbanization, and, particularly, Western-style education as progressive social forces. Traditional marriage arrangements by families persist in spite of in- creased women's education, parental control and caste identity being important factors. Implicit in these discussions is the belief that the marriage partners have no say in their marriage arrangements; if they did have a choice, such a marriage would be classified as a "love marriage." This is too simple a distinction. The absence of choice in one's marriage is more the exception than the rule in the modern unions of the new Indian middle class. That the so-called "love" marriages of the West are also largely influenced by the lenses of race, class, and education is easily overlooked. The only difference in the two arrangements is that, while the couple relies heavily on family networks to bring about their union in the former system, the latter employs non-formal networks to make the match. Seymour explains the practice of arranged marriages by drawing on research to show how Indian children are socialized toward interde- pendence rather than independence and personal autonomy. Again, this position is simplistic and untenable in light of the volumes of social science research on gender and Women's Studies demonstrating</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 183 the importance of relationality for females in the West (Carol Gilligan, et al.). Ironically, Seymour's distinction between interdependence (non- Western) and autonomy (Western) confirms the case that Indian feminists like Vandana Shiva make, whereby the Third World and its cultures have been equated with the weak female in Western thought. Further, this anthropomorphic scheme of differentiating societies over- looks the sophisticated cosmology within which the culture of interde- pendence arises. A disposition for interdependence that is rooted in a consciousness of balance among all varieties of life, human and non- human, arises among pre-industrial cultures. In a cosmic context of affin- ity, affiliation, and interdependence, inter-personal interdependence is only a slice of the whole. Seymour concedes the danger of overdrawing the distinctions as she recognizes that interdependence and independence exist on a continuum along which cultures fall according to the particular mixture of collectivist and individualist elements that they exhibit (269). Seymour observes the emergence of the class system as an improve- ment over the caste system for it provides new opportunities to the lower castes that would have hitherto been excluded from education and em- ployment. However, both systems offer little promise of mobility for the very poor. Poor women do not have choice about work outside the home. They are forced to seek work, leading to social stigma due to their eco- nomic need. Seymour speculates whether employment of higher-status women will bring honor to the poor working woman. She seems to negate the importance of choice (to work or not to work outside the home) to produce social prestige and value. Heralding modernization as a social good, Seymour believes that India's adaptation to social change will be different from the response of the West. She overlooks some of the inherent contradictions in market- driven modernization that promises freedom, choice, mobility but also brings in its wake greed, rootlessness, social license, and communal breakdown. The perversion of the dowry (bridal gift) that results in dowry demands and dowry-related deaths, and the deployment of amniocentesis and abortion to select male babies over females are some of the contem- porary consequences. Seymour offers little critical assessment of the impact of modernization. In all, the study was strong on description, but weak on analysis.
