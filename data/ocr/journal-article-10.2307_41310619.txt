Moses of Coucy's Reading Audience and His Sefer ha-Mizvot by Judah D. Galinsky Sefer mizvot gadol {Semag) by the French Tosefist R. Moses of Coucy was a most influential halakhic work in medieval times. Originally titled Sefer ha-mizvot ( The Book of Commandments ),* it was written in northern France in the first half of the thirteenth century and in many ways reveals the influence of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah.2 Indeed, to understand R. Moses of Coucy's legal project properly, it is important to comprehend the availability of Mishneh Torah in Europe at the time. Whereas Maimonides completed his Mishneh This article began as a paper delivered at the 2007 European Association for Jewish Studies (EAJS) Summer Colloquium, "The Cultures of Maimonideanism," held at Oxford University, orga- nized by Gad Freudenthal and James Robinson. I would like to thank the organizers and participants for their comments, as well as David Kazhdan and Menachem Butler for reading this article and offer- ing helpful suggestions toward its improvement. In addition I would like to thank Ephraim Kanarfogel for discussing many of the issues dealt with in this study and for sharing his own study on the topic. Finally a special thanks to the anonymous reader for giving me the opportunity to reexamine my con- clusions and to sharpen my formulations relating to the final section of this study. The research for this study was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (grant no. 1342/07). 1. This can deduced from the end of R. Moses' introduction to the negative commandments (the first volume of the work), where he writes, "and behold the two parts meant to write a book containing the positive commandments in one part, and a book containing the negative commandments in a second part." Moreover, early citations of the work refer to it as Sefer ha-mizvot. See, e.g., the letter of intro- duction written by R. Isaac of Corbeil to his ' Amude gola (that later became known as Semak) where he states, "And whoever does not understand the commentary, should look into the Book of Command- ments ( be-Sefer ha-mizvot ) written by R. Moses of Coucy {Semak, Sefer mizvot katan ( Amude gola ) (Jerusalem: Yerid ha-Sefarim, 2005), la)." In addition, R. Meir ha-Cohen in his Hagahot Maimoniyot consistently refers to R. Moses' work as Sefer ha-mizvot. It would seem that after R. Isaac of Corbeil 's book became popular and recognized as an abridgement of R. Moses' work, the title was changed to Sefer mizvot gadol - Semag in order to contrast it with Sefer mizvot katan - Semak. 2. As R. Solomon Luria (Maharshal), the famous sixteenth-century sage from Lublin, wrote, "for it is already a known fact that the Semag is entirely based on the Rambam and in most places he copies directly from him. He will not argue with him except in those places where the Tosefists argue with him, and without them he will not raise his hand and his foot against him." His words are found in She'elot u-teshuvot ha-Rema, ed. A. Ziv (Jerusalem: Hemed, 1971), siman 67. See also a second formulation of Maharshal along the same lines, below. 293</page><page sequence="2">Judah D. Galinsky Torah circa 1 1 80, the work seems not to have reached the study halls of the French Tosefists before 1200.3 In this article, I explain R. Moses' purpose and program in writing his Sefer ha-mizvot , examine the format he chose, and clarify who his pre- sumptive reader, or readers, may have been.4 R. Moses of Coucy and His Sefer ha-Mizvot5 At some point in the beginning of the thirteenth century, R. Moses of Coucy studied at the bet midrash of R. Judah Sir Leon in Paris.6 R. Judah, a major Tosefist of his era and a student of R. Isaac of Dampierre, died around the year 1224. 7 Between 1235 and 1238, R. Moses, already an established scholar, embarked on a preaching mission, reminiscent of that undertaken by the Christian friars of the time,8 to Spain and other Christian countries.9 The goal of his mission, as it emerges from the various sermons preserved in his book, was to raise the level 3. The first indication we have that the scholars of France were even aware of Mishneh Torah s existence reaches us through an exchange of letters around 1203 between R. Meir ha-Levi Abulafia of Toledo and R. Samson of Sens, the famed Tosefist and student of R. Isaac of Dampierre. It has been noted that a close reading of their learned exchange indicates that it was only around this time that the French scholars came to know of Maimonides' legal code. On this exchange of letters, see Bernard Septimus, Hispano- Jewish Culture in Transition: The Career and Controversies of Ramah (Cam- bridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1982), 48-51. On the appearance of Mishneh Torah in north- ern French study halls at around this time, see, e.g., J. R. Woolf, "Admiration and Apathy: Maimonides' ' Mishneh Torah ' in High and Late-Medieval Ashkenaz," in Be'erot Yitzhak: Studies in Memory of Isadore Twersky, ed. Jay M. Harris (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005), 430. 4. This examination is a continuation of an earlier shorter study; see Y. D. Galinsky, " Kum ' Aseh Sefer Torah mi-shne halakim: le-birur kavanatR. Moshe mi-Coucy be-ktivat ha-Semag ," Ha-Ma layan 35 (1995): 23-31. 5. The best concise study of R.

Moses' reputation was built primarily on his activity as author of a legal work. No doubt he was a learned Talmudist, a Tosefist who wrote Tosefot on the Talmud,15 but he does not seem to have attracted a following as a teacher of Talmud.16 We are not aware of any students composing Tosefot under his tute- lage or reporting legal decisions in his name, as was the case with some of his contemporaries, namely R. Jehiel of Paris and the brothers of Evreux. We may reasonably assume that during his lifetime R. Moses was acknowledged as a learned and skilled preacher, but it is his legal work that brought him long-lasting esteem. In scope and structure, Sefer ha-mizvot was unique compared to other legal works by Tosefists before R. Moses, such as the Yere'im by R. Eliezer of Metz and Sefer ha-terumah by R. Barukh b. Isaac. Sefer ha-mizvot is a wide-ranging work, 10. See Y. D. Galinsky's recent study "Gishot shonot le-tofa'at mofte kedoshei ha-nozrim be-sifrut ha-rabbanit shel yeme ha-benaim" in Ta-Shma: Mehkarim le-zikhro shel Yisrael M. Ta-Shma, ed. Avraham (Rami) Reiner and others (Alon Shvut: Tvunot, 2011), 195-220, relating to R. Moses' response to the phenomenon of miracles related to relics of Christian saints. 11. See Urbach, Ba'alei ha-Tosafot, 334; Katz, Exclusiveness, 104; and Galinsky, "R. Moses of Coucy," 87-90. Israel Yuval has emphasized this aspect of R. Moses' life's work, both his preaching mission and the composition of his halakhic work. See I. J. Yuval, Two Nations in Your Womb: Percep- tions of Jews and Christians in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, trans. J. Chipman (Berkeley: Uni- versity of California Press, 2006), 257-74 and his "Moshe Redivivus - ha-Rambam ke-'ozer la-melekh ha-mashiah," Zion 72 (2007): 186-87. The sermon published by Ta-Shma (see note 9) does much to strengthen this hypothesis. On the various calculations about the coming of the messiah during this time, see also E. Kanarfogel, "Hishuve ha-kez shel hakhme ashkenaz: mi-Rashi u-bne doro ve-ad le-tkufat ba'ale ha-tosafot," Rashi - Demuto ve-yizirato, ed. Avraham Grossman and Sara Japhet, (Jerusalem: Merkaz Zalman Shazar, 2008), 2:388-89, 393-94, and 395-400. 12. Regarding 1247 as the plausible year for the completion of the work, see the comment of Y. M. Peles in his introduction to Sefer mizvot gadol ha-shalem (Jerusalem: Machon Yerushalayim, 1993), 1:23. 13. On the effect of this event on his work, see J. R. Woolf, "Some Polemical Emphases in the Sefer Miswot Gadol of Rabbi Moses of Coucy," Jewish Quarterly Review 89 (1998): 86-93 and Y. D. Galinsky, "Mishpat ha-Talmud be-shnat 1240 be-Paris: 'Vikuah R. Yehi'el' ve-'Sefer ha-Mizvot' shel R. Moshe mi-Coucy," Shenaton ha-Mishpat ha-Ivri 22 (2001-2003): 45-69. 14. The implication of the format and the division into parts shall be elaborated below. 15.

Galinsky summarizing all areas of Jewish law, including items irrelevant to his time and place, such as laws relating to the Temple and its service. In structure, as well, R. Moses' work was unusual. Each part of the two-volume work (positive and negative commandments) is organized so that related laws are listed in one section and developed in a coherent manner. In contrast, as illustrated in this article, the two previous Tosefists' works lack such organization. Program and Purpose of R. Moses' Sefer ha-Mizvot Sefer ha-mizvot is a well-organized and structured work, based on the model of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah , with some modifications.17 Its broad scope may be the result of R. Moses' reliance on Mishneh Torah ,18 for it is very likely that he was convinced by Maimonides of the religious importance of summarizing the entire Oral Law in a cogent work. Nevertheless, we note three structural differences between R. Moses' work and that of Maimonides. First, in contrast to Maimonides, R. Moses of Coucy divided his work into two parts: prohibitions ( lo ta'aseh) and positive command- ments (' aseh ). Second, in his treatment of the law, he included extensive citations from talmudic (and rabbinic) sources. Last, he cited conflicting legal opinions by medieval scholars, mainly from northern France. In short, one can say that R. Moses of Coucy transformed the Maimonidean code into a French legal summary, with the addition of talmudic references as well as conflicting rabbinic 17. Urbach, Ba'alei ha-Tosafot , 472 has already noted the major differences in that R. Moses of Coucy inverted the order of Maimonides' last four books, namely Sefer Nezikin (Damages), Sefer Kinyan (Acquisitions), Sefer Mishpatim (Judgments), and Sefer Shoftim (Judges), which he placed before Sefer Hafla 'ah (Promises), Sefer Zeraim (Seeds), Sefer ' Avodah (Temple service), Sefer Korba- not (Sacrifices), and Sefer Tohorah (Ritual purity). The motivation for the rearrangement seems to have been the author's wish to keep all practical halakhah together and move the laws relevant to the past and future to the end of the work. There are a number of additional minor discrepancies, but I will mention only one of interest. As a fitting coda to his book, the author ends his section on negative command- ments with two mizvot that he "rescues" from the middle of the Book of Judges, hilkhot mamrim : the prohibition of adding and of subtracting biblical commandments. He may have decided to place these commandments at the end of the book because of their relationship to the five rabbinic positive com- mandments that he places at the end of his section on positive commandments (also a deviation from the Mishneh Torah structure). The message that emerges from these changes is that one may not alter the Law of Moses, given at Sinai by adding or subtracting from it; however, the talmudic sages did have authority to add rabbinic commandments. This may be a polemical response to Christian attacks on Judaism in general, and the Talmud in particular, during this time. It should be noted, however, that even regarding this twofold deviation, R. Moses was influenced by Maimonides. See Maimo- nides' comments regarding rabbinic commandments in Mishneh Torah and their relationship to the above-mentioned negative commandments found at the end of the list of commandments, Mishneh Torah, Sefer ha-madda , Shabse Frankel edition (Jerusalem and Bene Berak, 2001), 20-21. See also note 83. 18. An alternative explanation would be to relate the inclusion of laws relating to the Temple and to the land of Israel in his work to the messianic expectations that were widespread at this time. See note 1 1 . 296</page><page sequence="5">The Significance of Form opinions. I will now explain the program and motive underlying the unique book of commandments as reflected in R. Moses' statements to that effect. 1. A Tosefist's Supplement to the Talmud One of the author's more straightforward statements of purpose is found in his introduction to the book of positive commandments, in which he emphasizes how his work will enhance the reader's ability to study God's Torah. Midway through the introduction, he writes: A man may learn his entire life and still fail to attain knowledge of a particular commandment, and this is due to the length of the Talmud, the dialectic reasoning, and to the fact that one commandment may appear in several places. The Torah cautioned [regarding the mizvah of Torah study] "And thou shalt impress them diligently upon thy children [Deuteronomy 6:7]," [and that] the Torah's commandments must be "finely honed" in your own and in your children's mouths ... so that if someone asked [regarding a com- mandment] you will not stammer; rather, you will reply immediately . . }9 The vast scope of the Talmud, with its inherent lack of order and the complexity of its dialectics, did not allow most students of the law to achieve the necessary mastery of the material. The verse "And thou shalt impress," as talmudic sages understood it, necessitates a work like R. Moses' Sefer ha-mizvot. Obviously, a composition of such nature must include all the commandments and all the laws, not only those relevant to medieval Christian Europe, as he points out in the first part of his introduction: And there are those among the common folk who say, "What do the com- mandments in Seder Kodashim [Hallowed Things] have to do with us, and even more so this is true of Seder Zera'im [Agricultures] and the command- ments contained in the order of Toharot [Purities] which are inapplicable in our day and age?" Let no man say this, for there is a religious duty to know the foundations of the commandments which the Master of the universe commanded even though they are not applicable in our time , for we have been commanded concerning all the commandments, "And teach them."20 These two passages seem to indicate that R. Moses' purpose in composing his work was to provide a study aid for serious-minded Jews interested in fulfilling their religious obligation of Torah study, Talmud Torah , in a most complete manner. In Franco-German Jewish society, this religious duty was not merely one of the 613 commandments but rather its primary religious ideal.21 19. Sefer mizvot gadol, mizvot ' aseh 1-96, ed.

On the centrality of Torah le-shma in medieval Ashkenaz, see Y. M. Ta-Shma, Ha-Sifrut ha-parshanit la-Talmud be-Eropah u-Zefon Afrika 1000-1200 (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1999), 297</page><page sequence="6">Judah D. Galinsky R. Moses' work should therefore be viewed as a supplement rather than a replace- ment to Talmud study. Given that in Franco-Jewish society mastery of the Talmud was limited to the scholarly elite, we may deduce from this introduction that R. Moses' target audience was quite narrow. He does not seem to be addressing the broader Jewish society nor the learned layperson who was not too conversant with the Talmud. Rather, he seems to have had in mind students who had studied the Talmud in the past and had retained sufficient skills so as to enable continuing study throughout their lifetimes. 2. An Itinerant Preacher s Continued Mission A second statement of purpose occurs at the end of his lengthy introduction to the book of negative commandments.22 Here, R. Moses describes the historical circumstances that led him to write his Sefer ha-mizvot. After recounting the devel- opment of halakhic literature from the past, from geonic times until the Mishneh Torah of Maimonides, and after lauding and critiquing the latter, he shifts to the recent past and the present. R. Moses first describes his preparations in antici- pation of his preaching mission to the Jews of the Diaspora, "arranging the com- mandments by-heart ... the basis of each of the commandments, without all of their ramifications, so that I would not err in my rebuke."23 R. Moses traveled to a number of diaspora communities to rebuke them for their laxity in observing the commandments. He went to Spain and to other unnamed Jewish communities in Christian Europe, convincing many to observe mizvot such as tefillin and mezuzah, to refrain from violating various prohibitions, and in general to educate about the law and its ideals.24 It was in preparation for this mission that he reviewed the main points of the law.25 Immediately following the description of his preparatory measures, he relates that "in several localities, they [i.e., his audience] asked of me to transcribe the principles of the command- ments along with their sources, in the form of a book."26 In the body of the work 16-21; Ephraim Kanarfogel, "Progress and Tradition in Medieval Ashkenaz," Jewish History 14 (2000): 287-316, and J. D. Galinsky, "Halakha, kalkala ve-idialogya be-veit midrasha shel ha-Rosh be-Toledo," Zion 72 (2007): 388-93. 22. The introduction deals mainly with proving the authenticity of the Oral Law. See Woolf, "Some Polemical Emphases" and Galinsky, " Mishpat ha-Talmud ." 23. Sefer mizvot gadol ha-shalem, 13. 24. In his sermons, R. Moses stressed the importance of repentance, warned against prohibited relations with non-Jewish women, spoke about belief and trust in God, and demanded a higher moral standard especially in business dealings with Gentiles. One of his most central themes was the obser- vance of divine commandments, in particular those of Tefillin, Mezuzah, and Zizit. 25. We may learn about the basic structure of R. Moses' sermons from his introduction to the positive commandments. After citing at length from an inspirational sermon dealing with the purpose of the law and the eternal nature of the Torah, R. Moses concludes, "This introduction I preached to the exiles of Jerusalem in Spain and to the other exiles in Christian Europe [literally 'exiles of Edom'] to draw their hearts to the service of the God of Israel, and afterwards I would preach to them about the commandments.'''' (Sefer mizvot gadol, mizvot ' aseh 1-96, ed. Elyakim Shlezinger, 11). 26. Ibid. 298</page><page sequence="7">The Significance of Form he refers to this request: "Subsequently I was in other lands and my words were well received everywhere. And they requested me compose a book explaining the commandments in concise form."27 The response to R. Moses' sermons seems to have been largely positive. Jews in some localities encouraged him to compose a work that would serve as a substitute for his teachings.28 R. Moses, however, was hesitant. He stated, "I was afraid to do so, to compose a Torah scroll for the masses, 'for I am brutish, less than a man; I lack the wisdom of humans' [Proverbs 30:2]. "29 He then relates that he experienced a heavenly vision demanding of him to overcome his fears: "Arise! Compose a Torah scroll contain- ing two parts."30 This revelation gave him the needed impetus to proceed with his project, as he concludes, "And, therefore, I, Moses son of Jacob, have given my attention to composing two books. . . ."31 In short, according to R. Moses' words in this introduction, the genesis of his Sefer ha-mizvot can be traced to his prepara- tory activity prior to leaving France and to the requests he received during the course of his preaching activities among Jewish communities. One may question the accuracy of the events depicted,32 and one might also be skeptical about the extent to which R. Moses' final product was a response to his audiences' request. Nevertheless, it is evident that he viewed his role as an author, in some way, as an extension of his activities as a preacher.33 In his mind, the book was a continuation of his work of "strengthening the people of Israel in Torah and improving their ways" (" le-ma'an yithazku yisrael be-torah ubi-tokhaha ").34 In attempting to reveal R. Moses' purpose in writing his work and to define his target audience, this is an important point. A preacher's audience would have to include individuals from many walks of life, with diverse levels of education, and of varied religious observance. His readers would include a much wider cross-section of Jewish society than a limited circle of Talmud students. 27. This report is found at the end of positive commandment 3. Sefer mizvot gadol, mizvot ' aseh 1-96, ed. Elyakim Shlezinger, 17-18. 28. It is worth noting the similarity between R. Moses' description of his preparations "arran- ging the commandments by-heart ... the basics of each commandment, without all of their ramifica- tions" and the way he describes the request of his audience for "the principles of the commandments together with their sources, in the form of a book," and "a book explaining the commandments in concise form." 29. Sefer mizvot gadol ha-shalem, 13. 30. Ibid. 31. Ibid. 32. The claim of writing not from one's own initiative but in response to others is a common- place in medieval literature; see E. R. Curtius, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages, trans. W. R. Trask (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1990), 83-85; nevertheless, it would seem that at least "in some places" he was actually asked to compose a work on the commandments, a request he mentions not only in his introduction but later in the body of the work as well. In addition, see Ta-Shma "'Iggeret," where a thirteenth-century scholar, possibly R. Moses himself, describes in a letter the request by a Spanish community that he remain and teach them Torah instead of returning home to his family. 33. One can surmise that this is the reason for including throughout his work selections from the various sermons he delivered. See note 9. 34. Sefer Mizvot gadol ha-shalem, 14. This appears in the last line of the introduction. 299</page><page sequence="8">Judah D. Galinsky 3. A French Scholar s Version of Mishneh Torah A third purpose, somewhat less explicit than the previous one, but no less important, emerges from his introduction to the negative commandments. As noted, the final section of R. Moses' introduction is dedicated to describing the history of the Oral Law. Before introducing his book, R. Moses details the sequence of events that led to the redaction and writing down of the law. He begins his description with the Mishnah and ends with the Mishneh Torah . R. Moses' description of post-talmudic, halakhic literature is quite striking. The works written after the sealing of the Talmud merit only his brief mention, with the exception of the work of Maimonides, which he treats at length, providing both high praise and pointed criticism. Regarding the post-talmudic compositions prior to Mishneh Torah , R. Moses writes: And the Geonim who arose after the Amoraim realized that they could not manage to teach the entire Talmud to the many, so they produced brief works containing halakhic rulings in order to maintain [the existence of] Torah in Israel. Rav Yehudai Gaon produced the Halakhot gedolot , and R. Isaac from Fez produced a composition he called Rav ' Alfas , and so [did] many, each [producing] his own book.35 In contrast, he wrote the following about Maimonides the scholar and his work: And behold, later, their words also became occluded for the hearts [of man] had diminished. And the great man, Rabbenu Moses son of Maimon, arose . He was from Cordova, in the land of Ishmael, and he produced a composition encompassing the whole Torah, a fine and praiseworthy composition, and he illuminated the eyes of Israel. And he was a master of all knowledge; there was no one like him in these later generations. And many were strengthened in Torah by means of his books that spread in the lands of Christendom and Islam [lit., "the land of Edom and the land of Ishmael"].36 R. Moses of Coucy was evidently very impressed by Maimonides the person, his varied accomplishments, and most importantly, by his extraordinary legal work. R. Moses also praises the contribution of Mishneh Torah in spreading Torah among the people of Israel.37 Maimonides, however, is not immune to his critique. R. Moses deplored the lack of talmudic sources corroborating the halakhic rulings in Mishneh Torah and the total absence of northern French halakhic contribution. He states the following: However, this luminary [ga on] did not cite any proofs in his works, so that any individual who offers halakhic rulings based upon his books and is asked to provide some proof-text or source, if he did not learn the proof for 35. Sefer mizvot gadol ha-shalem, 12. 36. Ibid. 37. We discuss this aspect of R. Moses' description below. 300</page><page sequence="9">The Significance of Form this, or if he had learned it and forgotten it, this matter [Maimonides' decision] will be for him as a dream without a resolution.38 Indeed, medieval scholars had discussed this problematic aspect of Maimonides' code.39 However, it is the second issue mentioned by R. Moses, and it is unique to a scholar steeped in the French talmudic tradition and writing for a readership raised within the Franco-German legal culture: Moreover, in several places his interpretations and his halakhic rulings are dis- puted by the pillars of the Torah and its great men, namely, Rabbenu Solomon b. Isaac [Rashi], and Rabbenu Jacob b. Rabbenu Meir [R. Tam], and Rabbenu Isaac b. Samuel [Ri of Dampierre], from whose waters all the wise men of the latter generations drink.40 Following these broad concerns, R. Moses shifts his focus, in a way that may be described as punctilious, to several disagreements between Maimonides and the French sages on the enumeration of specific commandments.41 He then describes the exact circumstances, mentioned above, that prompted him to write his own work.42 R. Moses' decision to position his work within the context of all previous halakhic compositions, in particular that of Mishneh Torah , reveals that he per- ceived his Sefer ha-mizvot as yet another stage in the development of halakhic codes. Furthermore, his focus and critical assessment of Mishneh Torah above all other compositions strongly implies that he viewed his objective as providing a corrective to deficiencies he had found in the Maimonidean Code, while at the same time preserving its positive qualities. Having examined R. Moses' work and compared it to Mishneh Torah , I believe that Sefer ha-mizvot was to a large extent a revised version of Maimonides' classic legal code. R. Moses adopted much from Mishneh Torah as far as scope, structure, language, list of commandments, and even a considerable amount of halakhic content. His significant contribution, however, was the inclusion of numerous source citations from the Talmud, as well as most of the halakhic material drawn from the legal traditions of French sages.43 There are also some minor revisions in the listing of the commandments based on French teachings. 38.

Moshe will slightly revise Maimonides' formulations to align them with the Tosef- ists' positions. See Elyakim Shlezinger, Pne Moshe (Jerusalem, 1997), which is devoted to revealing R. Moses' editorial changes that influence the content of the law. 301</page><page sequence="10">Judah D. Galinsky R. Moses of Coucy did not hide the fact that Mishneh Torah was at his side when he wrote Sefer ha-mizvot ; he cites the author by name more than 250 times in the work. Indeed, one can reasonably say that his reliance on and adoption of many of Mishneh Torah' s features went far beyond those specific instances in which he cites Rabbenu Moshe. The sixteenth-century sage R. Solomon Luria correctly captured the relationship between R. Moses and R. Moses b. Maimon, when R. Luria wrote: And, presumably, the Semag is not disagreeing with the Rambam - for one who carefully examines the words of the Semag and the Rambam will find that the trunk and root of the Semag [geza ha-Semag ]44 is the Rambam, and its nourishment is from him [ve-yenikato mimeno ], except where he cites opposing views, such as those of Rashi or Rabbenu Tam or Ri. However, when [he cites halakhot ] anonymously, [he is taking them all from the Rambam] at one stroke - take a look, and you shall find [it thus].45 The modeling of the French Tosefist's legal work on the code of Maimonides has led me to consider that R. Moses of Coucy's primary motivation stemmed from his desire to provide his audience, particularly the French and German reader, with a revised and enhanced version of Mishneh Torah , one that had all its virtues without what he considered to be its shortcomings. Despite the fact that R. Moses never explicitly states this purpose, both the body of his work and his introduction speak clearly to this motive.46 Support for this hypothesis comes from an individual who was part of R. Moses of Coucy's circle of acquaintances in Paris, one who received per- mission to copy a section from his work while it was still very much a "work in progress."47 I am referring here to Karshavya (Kreshebya)48 ha-Nakdan, or as it 44. In the Talmud (Bava Batra 82a), the trunk and the root serve the same purpose. The distinc- tion between the trunk and the root is that one is seen by the naked eye and the other is hidden underground. 45.

See Galinsky, "Kum laseh Sefer Torah" 23-3 1 , and see Jeffrey Woolf who has argued in a similar vein in his "Maimonides Revised: The Case of the 'Sefer Miswot Gadoid " Harvard Theological Review 90 (1997): 175-205. 47. It is possible that Karshavya (Kreshebya) was residing only temporarily in Paris. R. Solomon Luria in his list of medieval scholars {She ' elot u-teshuvot ha-Maharshal , siman 29) writes cryptically, "Karshvya be-drom " (literarily "in the south"). Most scholars have understood this to be a scribal error for "be-dros" from the city Dreux (which comes from Latin "Drocae"). The samekh can very easily be misread as a mem sofit , especially by scribes unfamiliar with the French town. See, e.g., Urbach, Ba * alei ha-Tosafot , 337, n. 25 and 462. See also H. Gross, Gallia Judaica (Amsterdam: Philo Press, 1969), 180, where he reads Luria 's words as referring to Dreux. Since, however, there is no corroborative evidence for placing our Cresbien le Ponctateur in Dreux, we must remain somewhat skeptical with regard to this report. 48. In the gloss cited by Kupfer below, he calls himself KRSHBYA. However, in the colophon to Mishneh Torah he writes KRSHBYAHU. Similarly in the fable that he appended to the Berechiah ha-Nakdan 's fox fables, Mishleshu ' alim , A. M. Haberman edition (Jerusalem and Tel Aviv: Schocken, 1946), 132-35, he refers to himself at times as KRSHPYA and at times KRSHPYAHU. 302</page><page sequence="11">The Significance of Form was pronounced in French, Cresben (Cresbien) le Ponctateur,49 an expert punctua- tor or "grammarian," copyist of books, scribe, and religious poet.50 To the best of our knowledge, however, he was not an important Talmudist.51 In one instance, probably in a gloss appended to R. Moses' Sefer ha-mizvot , he wrote, "So said Karshavya [or more accurately Kreshebya] ha-Nakdan ... in the days of R. M. of Coucy and R. Jehiel of Paris; I was in the city of Paris in the presence of R. Jehiel . . ."52 Around 1242-1243, he copied Maimonides' entire Mishneh Torah ,53 appending two additions related to the Maimonidean code. The first addition, found in the opening pages of the manuscript, is Karsha- vya's original poetic composition, summarizing the 613 commandments, in a genre known as ' Azharot , customarily read on the holiday of Shavuot.54 The second addition is a chapter from R. Moses of Coucy's yet-to-be-completed work, which eventually became the Sefer ha-mizvot. Karshavya placed this excerpt within Mishneh Torah between Chapters 7 and 8 of the laws of Sheluhim ve-Shutafim (Agents and partners) with the heading, written in capital letters, " PEREK ZORFATI"55 "[A] French Chapter." He then continues in normal letter- ing size, "written by the Rav R. Moses b. Jacob from Coucy who argues on the sixth chapter, according to the tradition of the French Sages." This chapter appears, with minor variations, in R. Moses' Sefer ha-mizvot , at positive com- mandment 82. It would seem that the characterization of R. Moses' chapter as a "French Chapter" that disagrees with Maimonides, based on French halakhic tra- dition, was not Karshavya 's own but was rather conveyed to him by the author, R. Moses, who was busily writing his work at precisely this time. 49. Cresben is the northern French equivalent of Catalan Provencal Crescas. Both Crescas and Cresben may be a Romanization of Joseph on the basis of the biblical verse ben porat Yosef. Joseph is a fruitful vine, and the Latin verb crescere, means "to grow" or "to increase." I would like to thank Cyril Aslanov for assisting me in clarifying the various aspects relating to KRSHBYA's name and possible place of residence in Dreux. 50. In general, see N.

A survey of the various glosses that he appended to his copy of R. Moses of Coucy's Sefer ha-mizvot (positive commandments 19, 21, and 25) reveals his specialization in the area of copying Torah scrolls, public reading of them, and copying tefillin. The gloss related to commandment 25 was preserved in the printed edition of Sefer ha-terumah siman 201.

Galinsky Moreover, Karshavya's reference to R. Moses' work as " Perek Zorfati written by the Rav R. Moses b. Jacob from Coucy," and after the citation as "the end of the chapter [salik pirka ] written by the Rav R. Moses b. Jacob from the city of Coucy ..." indicates that at this stage of his composition, R. Moses had not yet decided to present his work as a book of commandments. It is likely that at this initial stage the book was loosely structured as chapters, perakim , that ran parallel to the perakim of the Mishneh Torah. Had R. Moses' book already been organized as a sefer ha-mizvot , a book of commandments, one would have expected Karshavya to have at least alluded to its format as such. In short, the evidence from Karshavya's Mishneh Torah reinforces the hypothesis that R. Moses' primary purpose in writing his book was to present an alternative French version of Mishneh Torah to the reading public.56 If I am correct in this characterization of R. Moses' program, it becomes essential to explain his decision to abandon the Maimonidean model of an inte- grated legal code and to replace it with the format of a two-part book of command- ments.57 Such an innovation could only have appeared as artificial, and less user- friendly, to readers familiar with Mishneh Torah. What, then, possessed R. Moses to destroy a beautiful edifice and replace it with one far less pleasing and even more then a tad unwieldy?58 To understand his decision to shape his halakhic work as a two-part book of commandments, it is worth considering its revolutionary nature within its French context. The Revolutionary Nature of R. Moses of Coucy's Books French talmudic legal culture at the time was primarily a scholastic venture of the study hall. Eleventh- and twelfth-century scholars focused their attention on writing commentaries on the Talmud and did not devote much attention to the composition of practical legal works.59 This is not to say that the Tosefists, or Rashi for that matter, were oblivious to the practical side of lived religious life; rather, they felt that the needs of the students and scholars in the bet midrash were of primary importance.60 During the Middle Ages, the French became 56. See also the additional evidence for this suggestion brought in the conclusion of this study. 57. As noted above, each part of the work followed the structure of Mishneh Torah with some variations. 58. Maimonides in his introduction to his Sefer ha-mizvot describes at length the rationale behind his decision to structure his work according to topics and not commandments. See Isadore Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah) (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1980), 27-28. 59. In this practice they were following the scholastic culture of German Jewish scholars, active in the Rhineland during the eleventh century. It is worth noting that both cultures valued the writing of responsa literature. At some point in time, the scholars of Germany (in contrast to France) fused these two areas of interest by writing books on the Talmud where they integrated their important responsa. For examples of this genre during the late twelfth and the thirteenth century, see Simcha Emanuel, Shivre luhot: sifre halakhah avudim shel ba ' ale ha-Tosafot (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2006), 134-35. 60.

When R. Moses contemplated writing a book on halakhah, only two poss- ible works from within the French orbit could have been considered as precedents for his undertaking. Neither was a particularly fine model. I am referring here to the early thirteenth-century Sefer ha-terumah , by R. Barukh b. Isaac, a student of the famed Tosefist R. Isaac of Dampierre, and the earlier Sefer ha-yere'im from the late twelfth century by R. Eliezer of Metz, a student of R. Tam, the founder of the French Tosefist movement. Beginning with the later work, I will briefly describe both in order to demonstrate their incompatibility with R. Moses' goals and needs. I will then go back in time to the Yere'im , which is the more relevant precedent for R. Moses, at least with regard to the format and structure of the book he ultimately chose to write.61 Sefer ha-terumah was a legal summary of practical halakhah. It emerged from the study hall of R. Isaac of Dampierre.62 From the Tosefist commentarial enterprise, R. Barukh gleaned those elements with halakhic relevance and put them into book form. He dealt with topics limited to certain areas, beginning with the laws of ritual slaughter and proceeding to those relating to menstruation, divorce, idolatry, and various other areas of halakhah. He concludes with the laws of the Sabbath.63 The work was by no means an all-encompassing code, and the author does not seem to have attempted to devise a coherent structure.64 The body of the work reads like a Tosefot on the Talmud, with lengthy intri- cate dialectic, albeit with a clear practical orientation. In addition, it is worth noting that the internal order of each section of laws basically follows the order of the corresponding tractate of the Talmud and related Tosefot. In short, Sefer ha-terumah was not exactly a work of practical halakhah but rather a collection of scholarly Tosefot on the Talmud, with practical ramifications limited to specific topics. The work was a natural extension of the Tosefist movement, bringing to its practitioners and to a wider learned audience, within France and beyond, the prac- tical implications of the Tosefist approach to the Talmud. The nature of the earlier Sefer ha-yere'im differed from that of the Terumah.65 According to the author's introduction to the work, his was a book Simon-Dubnow-Instituts 8 (2009): 95-118. See, however, David Berger's response, "Polemic, Exeg- esis, Philosophy, and Science: On the Tenacity of Ashkenazic Modes of Thought," ibid., 27-39. 61. It is worth noting that with regard to halakhic content, however, ha-terumah played a more central role than Yereim. 62. Urbach, Ba'alei ha-Tosafot, 347-54. 63. The complete list of topics treated in Sefer ha-terumah is 1. Shehita ; 2. 'Issur Ve-heter; 3. Halla ; 4. Nidda ; 5. Gittin ; 6. Haliza ; 7. ' Avodah Zarah; 8. Yayin Nesekh ; 9. Sefer Torah' 10. Tefillin; 11. ' Erez Yisra ' el ; and 12. Shabbat. 64. It is, however, worth mentioning that R. Barukh appended an abridgement to his work to serve in the dual capacity of a short practical summary of the larger work as well as a table of contents for it. See meanwhile Y. D. Galinsky, "Ha-Rosh ha-Ashkenazi bi-Sefarad: 'Tosafot ha-Rosh,' 'Pisqei ha-Rosh,' Yeshivat ha-Rosh," Tarbiz 74 (2005): 406^107. 65.

Galinsky of commandments whose purpose was to inculcate Talmud students with a rever- ence for God, commandments, and laws. According to R. Eliezer, a Jew could enhance personal awareness of God's presence in his daily life by being attentive to God's commandments and knowing their biblical and rabbinic sources. He writes: My thoughts and ponderings leave me in distress, when I see those students of Torah (lit., "the Torah poor"; ' aniye torah) toiling in the field of dialectics (lit., pilpul ha-kushiyot) of the talmudic discussion, while failing to internalize the source of the commandments, what the Creator has commanded. How can they carry out His ordinances and His laws? Their fear is by rote, as they do not place the fear of the Rock before themselves. [Consequently], the command- ments with which they are familiar are observed, and those with which they are not will be forgotten. Thus, the receptacle [i.e., the soul] will be filled by the whims of the heart [lit., "that of his heart"] and not for the sake of God 66 R. Eliezer felt the need to sensitize the student toward an awareness and fear of the Lord, in order to balance out the very strong emphasis on intellectual study prac- ticed in the Tosefists' schools. Despite this clear religious agenda, an analysis of the work reveals that in actuality, Yereim was comprised of three distinct elements: 1 . A list of commandments, mizvot , with their biblical and talmudic sources, as enumerated in the classical list by the ninth-century Babylonian sage, R. Simon Kayara, author of Halakhot gedolot , and accompanied at times with the rationale for the respective commandments; 2. Scholarly Tosefist dialectical interpretations of selected mizvot ; and67 3. Lengthy practical halakhic treatments of specific mizvot ,68 It would seem that as a Tosefist writing for fellow students of the Talmud, R. Eliezer could not write a work with a sole focus on detailing the commandments and their sources without occasionally adding some advanced talmudic dialectics and practical halakhah. The purpose of the work was to enhance awareness of God through knowledge of the biblical commandments. It was not meant to be a prac- tical legal code with the goal of codifying halakhah and instructing readers on how to lead their lives (as was Mishneh Torah), nor was it a collection of Tosefist teach- ings and rulings such as Sefer ha-terumah. 66.

It is divided into seven pillars: 1 . Prohibited sexual unions; 2. Commandments relating to eating; 3. Commandments relating to prohibited benefit; 4. Monetary prohibitions that are the result of taking or withholding money; 5. Wrongs to God and human beings (and positive commandments) that do not involve financial benefit; 6. Acts related to speech that offend God but cause no harm to human beings; and 7. Acts unrelated to speech that offend God but cause no harm to human beings. A glance at these categories alone indicates the difficulty in using R. Eliezer as a model for a practical halakhic guide. Such a structure, including its additional subdivision that could at times total eight subcategories,69 could not facilitate straightforward systematic study of the law. To demonstrate the problematic nature of Yereim' s structure, I now will list, according to the order of the book, its placement of the various commandments relating to Passover. The first commandment is the prohibition of eating hamez and is found at siman 52. This location is within the second pillar of the work, devoted to commandments relating to eating and within the subcategory of prohi- bition whose punishment is excommunication. The second and third command- ments are the positive commandment of eating maza , at siman 91, and of eating maror , at siman 93. The placement of these two commandments is also within the "eating" commandments; they appear, however in the subcategory of positive commandments, thus the distance between the prohibition of hamez and the com- mandment of maza and maror. The fourth commandment concerns the prohibition against benefit from hamez and is found at siman 103. The location of this com- mandment is in the third pillar, devoted to commandments relating to forbidden benefit. The prohibition of owning hamez is at siman 301 and 302; the command- ment to observe all laws of Passover the entire seven days is at siman 416; and 69. In addition to this basic division, the author subdivided each pillar into various numbers of hooks iyave ha-amudim ), the number dependent on the content of the pillar. The hooks in Yereim define the level of prohibition according to severity of the punishment, so that in every pillar one can find at least one, though usually there will be a number of the following types of prohibitions, according to the following order (see source 10B): 1. punishment by stoning; 2. by burning; 3. by sword; 4. by choking; 5. by excommunication {karet)' 6. death from the hand of heaven; 7. negative commandments (not punishable by death); and 8. positive commandments. The first seven categories are almost always negative commandments, with various degrees of punishment, and the eighth category is the positive aspect of the religion. Note that this internal subdivision was inspired by that of the Halakhot Gedolot, the classic list of mizvot that was R. Eliezer's source. The division into seven pillars, however, was his creation. 307</page><page sequence="16">Judah D. Galinsky burning the hamez is at siman 437. Each of these three topics appears in the seventh pillar, devoted to acts unrelated to speech that offend the Lord. They are, however, in different subcategories: the first in negative prohibitions and the next two in positive.70 Based on the structure and content of the work, it seems obvious that the character of the Yere ' im is not of an organized halakhic work but rather of a soph- isticated sefer ha-mizvot - book of commandments. As noted, the author may have included within this work a considerable amount of halakhic material and Tosefist dialectics; however, the nature of the text is of a book of commandments, with the goal of educating students of the bet midrash. To summarize, we can reasonably say that northern France, in contrast to Spain, lacked a strong tradition of writing legal works. Before R. Moses of Coucy, no one there had written a well-structured book of laws, independent of the Talmud, and it would be hard to imagine that anyone in France prior to R. Moses had contemplated summarizing the entire Oral Law. After Maimonides completed his project, however, at least one Frenchman was prompted to emulate him. The impressive scope of Mishneh Torah , together with its structure and form, captured the heart and mind of R. Moses.71 R. Moses of Coucy's Heavenly Vision and the Format of His Book Sometime before implementing his ambitious plan, and while the draft of his work on halakhah may yet have been loosely structured as Perakim Zorfatiyim (French chapters), parallel to Mishneh Torah , R. Moses understandably hesitated, saying, "and I was afraid to do so, to compose a Torah scroll for the many [sefer torah le-rabim]" 72 He was clearly aware of the novelty of this new literary genre. The lack of tradition and true precedent for such a legal work - a summary of the oral law - from within the glorious French school of Talmud study could deter 70. It is worth contrasting this diffusion of commandments and laws related to Passover as found in Yere' im to their placement in R. Moses of Coucy's work. In the later work one can find all the special laws of Passover located in two areas according to the two-part division of his work. In the negative commandments, prohibitions 76-79, one will find all the laws relating to hamez on Pass- over, with the exception of the positive commandment to eliminate all hamez from one's possession before the holiday. In the positive commandments, commandments 39-4 1 in addition to the aforemen- tioned requirement of hamez elimination prior to the holiday, one can find all the various other laws relating to the Passover holiday in one section. 71. On these unique qualities in Mishneh Torah , see Twersky, Introduction , 188-23. With regard to Maimonides' language and style, additional qualities that endeared him to R. Moses, see ibid., 324-55.

It is likely that he chose the image of a Torah scroll to describe his legal work because of the vision he received instructing him to write such a scroll, as shall be seen below - although it would seem that in the original version of the work he wrote simply "sefer le-rabim." 308</page><page sequence="17">The Significance of Form even one of the more adventurous spirits of the Tosefist movement.73 In addition, one has at least to consider that at the time, Maimonides was a somewhat contro- versial figure because of his philosophic writings74 and because of his claim, in the introduction to Mishneh Tor ah, that there was no need for any other works besides the Bible and his legal code.75 R. Moses may not have wanted to be perceived as too much of a follower of the Spanish sage or as a scholar interested in writing a work that would replace the Talmud and its study. I believe that it was at this juncture that a heavenly vision, so to speak, inter- vened and showed R. Moses the way out of his quandary: And at the beginning of the sixth millennium, a dream vision appeared to me: "Arise and make a Torah scroll [sefer torah ] of two parts." And I contem- plated [the meaning of] the vision, and beheld the two parts meant to write a book containing the positive commandments in one part, and a book con- taining the negative commandments in a second part . And, therefore, I, Moses son of Jacob, have given my attention to composing two books. . . .76 The message of the heavenly vision was cryptic, as medieval visions of these sorts usually were, and required interpretation.77 After giving it much thought, R. Moses understood the vision's content to be a directive telling him how to intro- duce his work to a Franco-German audience. He understood that he had to take the Mishneh Torah model and transform it into a book of commandments, as such a work had good precedent in the composition of R. Eliezer of Metz. He would not completely abandon, however, the Maimonidean structure for that of Yereim , for that would defeat his entire purpose of producing a properly organized legal code. Rather, he would modify the format of Mishneh Torah by converting it into two separate books, one containing laws related to the positive commandments and the second related to the negative commandments.78 This editorial choice 73. We do not know of any other famous French Tosefist who left his country in order to preach to Jewish communities throughout Christian Europe. 74.

Galinsky regarding the presentation of halakhic material would enable him to introduce his work within the French tradition, following in the footsteps of R. Eliezer of Metz.79 The heavenly vision may have given R. Moses the idea, but the hard work of its implementation was left for him to complete. He had to learn to rearrange the legal content of Mishneh Torah into its positive and negative components and reconstruct it into two separate books that mirrored each other. He did, however, have the generous assistance of the "Great Eagle" himself. Maimonides, in his preface to Mishneh Torah , not only copied the list of positive and negative commandments from his own book of commandments but also appended a separ- ate listing according to the order of Mishneh Torah. This second list was so central to Maimonides' legal thought that he copied it twice more in his work. At the beginning of each of the fourteen books (e.g., Book 2, ' Ahava ; or Book 3, Zemanim), he copied the list of mizvot relevant to that book. Then at the beginning of each collection of Halakhot (e.g., "laws of Tefilla ," "laws of Shabbaf) he included the list of mizvot relevant to that collection.80 This repeated listing of the mizvot has led Moshe Halbertal to conclude that the commandments served as subtitles for the various books of the Maimonidean legal code.81 It is likely that R. Moses made good use of the list according to the order of Mishneh Torah as he went about structuring his own book.82 In fact, one could argue, along Halbertal's suggestion, that R. Moses of Coucy's most basic structural modification of Mishneh Torah was his decision to elevate Maimonides' "subtitle" to the status of "title."83 It was this slight adjustment in Mishneh Torah' s structure that allowed R. Moses to introduce his work as an authentic expression of traditional Tosefist scholarship. 79. For a somewhat similar step by a later halakhic scholar, R. Moses Isserles, in presenting his Torat Hatat to the reader, see Elchanan Reiner, "The Ashkenazi Elite at the Beginning of the Modern Era: Manuscript versus Printed Book," Polin 10 (1997): 85-98, esp. 95. 80. One can see the two additional lists of mizvot in Rav Yitzchak Shilat's edition of Mishneh Torah , titled Rambam Miduyak, or in the Shabse Frankel edition of Mishneh Torah. In most standard printings the list at the beginning of each book was omitted. On the centrality of the enumeration of the commandments within Maimonides' legal thought, see Moshe Halbertal, "Sefer ha-mizvot le-Rambam, ha-arkitektura shel ha-halakha ve-ha-tiorya ha-parshanit shela," Tarbiz 59 (1990): 457-80. 8 1 . See M. Halbertal, Rabi Moshe ben Maimon (Jerusalem: Merkaz Zalman Shazar, 2009), 97- 101, esp. y 99. I would like to thank David Henshke for discussing this issue with me. 82. Additional assistance may have come from Karshavya ha-Nakdan who at this exact time was compiling such a list based on the list of mizvot according to the order of Mishneh Torah ; see note 98. 83. An interesting structural consequence of this shift from code to book of commandments relates to the placement of the rabbinic commandments in these two books. Maimonides, who was writing a code, was easily able to allot space within his work for these commandments. E.g., he includes a section dealing with the laws of Purim and Hanuka or those of ' Eruven within the book of Zemanim (i.e., Holidays), though they are purely rabbinic in nature. In contrast, R. Moses, who was writing a book of biblical commandments, was much more restricted in this regard. He therefore delays his treat- ment of all five rabbinic commandments until he completes his examination of the biblical ones, placing them at the end of the positive commandments. See also note 17. 310</page><page sequence="19">The Significance of Form The Reception of Mishneh Torah in Thirteenth-Century Europe To understand R. Moses' mindset as he wrote his work, as well as to define his potential target audience, we will examine the reception of Mishneh Torah in Christian Europe in the first half of the thirteenth century, particularly in the area known as Ashkenaz.84 Until the late thirteenth century, there is no evidence that the Tosefists of France and Germany, with the exception of R. Moses of Coucy and R. Isaac 'Or Zaru'a of Vienna, engaged with Maimonides' work. Mishneh Torah is not mentioned more than three times in the printed Tosefot on the Talmud. Moreover, explicit references to Mishneh Torah are few even in the practical halakhic work of R. Isaac of Corbeil, Semak, accompanied with the glosses of R. Perez.85 It was only late in the century, and mainly in the study hall of R. Meir of Rothenburg, that one can note a serious and sustained engagement with the work.86 Once we leave the rarefied air of the Tosefists' study halls and the talmudic scholars studying there, and examine other types of readers, I would tentatively suggest that a somewhat different picture emerges. Not all educated Germans and Frenchmen were Tosefists. Then, as today, in addition to basic talent and determination, talmudic dialectics demanded a certain cast of mind.87 There were talented individuals who had studied Talmud and Tosefot and even knew their content, but who chose to focus attention on varied areas of Jewish religious culture, such as religious poetry (piyyut), exegesis of piyyut and/or Bible and religious-ethical thought, Christian-Jewish polemics, and more.88 I would think 84. This topic has recently drawn the attention of a number of scholars. See Woolf, "Admiration and Apathy" mentioned in note 3; H. Soloveitchik, "The Halakhic Isolation of the Ashkenazic Com- munity," Jahrbuch des Simon-Dubnow-Instituts 8 (2009): 41-47, and recently E. Kanarfogel in a lecture titled "The Diffusion of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah in Thirteenth-Century Ashkenaz" deliv- ered in Toronto at the AJS Conference in 2007. 1 would like to thank Professor Kanarfogel for sharing his conference paper with me. As will be clarified below, my interest and treatment of this issue is some- what different from these previous studies. I am interested neither in clarifying the question of Mishneh Torah' s influence on French halakhah nor in describing the exact level of engagement of both French and German scholars with the work. My interest pertains rather to the question of readership: was the Mishneh Torah a work that aroused interest among educated readers in France and Germany in the first half of the thirteenth century or was it ignored? 85. In the combined work of both scholars R. Isaac and R. Perez I have found altogether only some twenty-five citations. 86. See Soloveitchik, "Halakhic Isolation," where he vigorously argues that true engagement with Mishneh Torah in France and Germany occurred only within the walls of R. Meir of Rothenburg's study hall. 87. On this, see the perceptive observations of H. Soloveitchik, "Three Themes in the Sefer Hasidim," AJS Review 1 (1976): 339-44, and Soloveitchik, "Can Halakhic Texts Talk History?," AJS Review 3 (1978): 180-81. 88. See E. Kanarfogel's book-length study, The Intellectual History of Medieval Ashkenazic Jewry: New Perspectives (Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, forthcoming).

Galinsky that many of these educated individuals remained conversant in Talmud study, to varying degrees, without it being their main preoccupation. For such a readership, whether learned or less learned, a work like Mishneh Torah would have been a very welcome addition to a library. The usefulness of a well-structured summary of the Oral Law composed in accessible mishnaic Hebrew should have appealed to those who were not full-time Talmudists. A well- organized abridgment of the Talmud would have been of interest to French and German readers, even if they had no intention of basing their religious practice on Maimonides' legal opinions. The primary motivation for studying Mishneh Torah was to broaden one's talmudic knowledge without the difficulties of enga- ging in intensive and time-consuming study of the Talmud. Although the manuscript evidence for circulation of the work during the thir- teenth century is ambiguous at best,89 three independent literary sources from the first half of the thirteenth century imply that shortly after it reached France and Germany, Mishneh Torah aroused interest among various types of readers within Ashkenazi society.90 The earliest dated piece of evidence is from Bohemia, in R. Abraham b. Azriel's commentary to religious poetry, ' Arugat ha-Bosem. R. Abraham, a learned student of R. Elazar of Worms, completed his extensive com- mentary around 1234 and cites from Mishneh Torah both in areas of Jewish thought and of halakhah. Using E. E. Urbach's source index from Volume 4 of his edition,91 we find R. Abraham referring explicitly to positions of R. Moshe b. Maimon from the sections "Principles of the Torah" ( Yesode ha-Torah ), "Repentance" ( Teshuva ), "Reciting Shema" (Keriat Shema), Tefillin , Zizit, "Blessings" ( Berakhot ), "Circum- cision" ( Mila ), Shabbat , "Festivals" ( Yom-Tov ), Lulav , and "Sanctification of the 89. For an initial survey of the manuscript evidence for the spread of the work in Ashkenazi society during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, see notes 106 and 107. As we shall see, only one dated manuscript from the mid-thirteenth century has come down to us, as well as one from the end of the century and an additional one tentatively dated as thirteenth-fourteenth century. However, there are a good number of undated manuscripts that have been tentatively dated as from the fourteenth century. Only a closer examination by an expert will confirm this dating. It is entirely possible that many of the manuscripts that are dated as from the fourteenth century may actually be from the thir- teenth. It is also of interest to note that while strong indications show that R. Moses of Coucy's work was already recognized as important among the scholarly class of France and Germany already in the thirteenth century, the number of manuscripts from that time period is not overwhelming either. There are only three dated manuscripts from the last quarter of the thirteenth century and only three undated ones that have been estimated from the "thirteenth-fourteenth century." This means that on the whole the majority of the twenty-five surviving copies of Semag from the thirteenth and four- teenth centuries are from the fourteenth century (nineteen manuscripts). In a word, although I believe that one can establish the popularity of a work based on a large number of extant manuscripts, one should not necessarily assume that the converse is correct. There may be various external and internal factors that could affect and determine the fate of a medieval manuscript and its survival into the twenty-first century. 90. Even if Maimonides and his halakhic rulings were clearly not treated as authoritative among the scholarly class. 91. See ' Arugat ha-bosem, ed. E. E. Urbach (Jerusalem: Mekize Nirdamim, 1939-64), 4:272- 73. It is worth noting that in Urbach's listing of sources, volumes 2 and 3 are mistakenly switched a number of times. 312</page><page sequence="21">The Significance of Form New Moon" (Kidush ha-hodesh)92 - altogether some fifty quotations.93 I believe that such unaffected use of Mishneh Torah , or certain sections of the work, close to the time of its appearance in northern Europe, indicates its appeal to a certain kind of religious intellectual. R. Abraham, a talmudic scholar who had an impress- ive library at his disposal, was familiar with the hibbur of the Spanish sage, or parts of it, and used it in the specific areas of his interest.94 Moreover, at around the same time in the area of Paris, lived the copyist, grammarian, and religious poet Karshavya (Kreshbeya), whom we met earlier, who not only copied the entire Mishneh Torah but also composed his own version of ' Azharot , the religious poem traditionally read in synagogue on Shavuot. The poem, which he titled ' Azharot Maimoniyot , summarizes the com- mandments and is based on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah. Apart from Karshavya's use of Maimonides' work, his words of praise for the work of the "great eagle," written not later than 1242-1243, can teach us much about the enthusiasm that the work evoked among certain circles. He writes: I examine this matter - the structure, the numbering of the mizvot , and the reasoning, which Moses [Maimonides] included in his book of laws, the Yad ha-Hazaka. He never tired, and never let his eyes close, but rather kept his tongue constantly sharp, [discussing] the words of the first Moses, which are written in the book [of the Torah]. . . . I begin to feel a strong yearn- ing for thee, like a burning-fire, a fire-offering upon its sacrificial pyre; [I am roped] up by the flame, and fettered by love. And I say: "Oh now, let me come to thee- for the glory of the Lord hath shined upon thee, and brought forth blossoms and glorious flowers. " And the spirit of the Lord passes over me, and sparkles within me, for my heart becomes warm with feelings of flaming love for these two men, each prominent in his generation, more beloved than gold, the two Hebrews from the Land of Egypt, but quite removed from the arrogance [of that land] - the first Moses and the second; one the [adoptive] son of Bithiah [daughter of Pharaoh], and one his [spiritual descendant]. The house of [the latter] is all clothed in crimson, and his storehouse [of knowledge] is filled to the ceiling, and his spirit is enwrapped in the mantle of Shin'ar. 95 He sits at the gate, and his name is Tahkemoni [full of wisdom], the prince, my master, who comes from Mt. Sinai. 92. Abraham's citations from Maimonides' laws of kidush ha-hodesh include both halakhic and scientific statements relating to the Jewish calendar. 93. Abraham cites from the nonhalakhic portions of Mishneh Torah around fifteen times and from the halakhic portion around thirty-five times. One can assume that there are even more nonattrib- uted references to the work, as is usually the case with medieval authors who borrow without explicitly citing their sources. 94. See H. Soloveitchik, "The Halakhic Isolation," 44. 95. Shin 'ar is the early biblical word for Babylonia (see, e.g., Genesis 11:2). Here it stands for the tradition of the Babylonian amoraim and geonim; Karshavya is saying that Maimonides is the heir to that tradition. 313</page><page sequence="22">Judah D. Galinsky And I, from the midst of the fire of love, call out, [in] the blaze. And as the flame ascends, I am desirous of his golden language, and of his mantle of glory and splendor. Oh, would that I could even be the capital of a pillar in the structure which he built about the mizvot ; I could then fight its battles, in its gates! I desire his works, and take them, to kiss them , [for they are supplies]96 of sustenance and food. And whenever my desire burns strong, in my home, the laws and Torah [of Maimonides] are pleasant song for me .97 Karshavya describes Maimonides as one who has "brought forth blossoms and glorious flowers," actually comparing him to the biblical Moses, writing of him as one who "sits at the gate, and his name is Tahkemoni , the prince, my master." He alludes to the unique qualities of Mishneh Torah - its language and structure - writing, "I am desirous of his golden language, and of his mantle of glory and splendor." He ends his paean of praise, declaring his appreciation for the entire work by stating, "I desire his works, of sustenance and food and take them, to kiss them. . . . And whenever my desire burns strong, in my home, the laws and Torah [of Maimonides] are pleasant song for me." These lines eloquently describe the work's uniqueness and attraction for a certain type of reader. Moreover, in the paragraph that follows, Karshavya criti- cizes earlier French authors of ' Azharot for not attempting to properly organize the mizvot. He feels that the earlier poets subjugated rational order to the rhyme scheme, creating groups of mizvot that lack internal order - thus his wish to correct this basic flaw by writing ' Azharot using Maimonides' list of mizvot orga- nized according to the order of Mishneh Torah .98 The final source is undated, and there are questions regarding its exact provenance. Nevertheless, its use of Mishneh Torah is most telling. The book is titled Sefer hasidut , and the earliest surviving dated manuscript of the work is from 1299." This work has recently been analyzed at length by Haym 96. Karshavya is making an untranslatable pun on two interpretations of the word nashku in Psalms 2:12. One interpretation of the verb is "to kiss" (or even, as Rashi quotes in the name of Menahem, "to desire"); another is "to supply food," also cited by Rashi on that verse. Karshavya is using both meanings of the verb, so I have translated it twice (with the second time in brackets): "to kiss them [for they supply]," or "are supplies of." I would like to thank Gavriel Wasserman for assisting me in understanding the various passages from Karshavya's poetic introduction cited in this study. 97. See notes 53 and 54; N. Golb has transcribed the text in its entirety in Toldot ha-yehudim ba-ir Ruan be-yime ha-benayim (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1976), 208-27; the introduction cited above is at 208. 98. See above where we described the two basic lists of mizvot to be found in Mishneh Torah. However, Karshavya tells us in this same paragraph that in preparing his poem he needed to modify Maimonides' list slightly. The list of mizvot according to the order of Mishneh Torah was structured exactly according to their order of appearance in the book. This meant that the positive and negative commandments were not divided into two distinct lists but rather were integrated. Karshavya, for the purpose of writing ' Azharot , had to divide Maimonides' list into its two distinct components, the positive and negative commandments respectively. 99. The work was published as the first part of Sefer hasidim (Bologna, 1538), simanim 1-152 that became the standard edition of the work. On the earliest dated manuscript of the work, see Solo- veitchik, "Piety, Pietism and German Pietism: Sefer Hasidim I and the Influence of Hasidei Ashkenaz," Jewish Quarterly Review 92 (2002): 465-66. 314</page><page sequence="23">The Significance of Form Soloveitchik,100 who suggests that it may have been written earlier than 1220.101 Even if we were to assume a more conservative estimate, it would still have had to be written no later than 1230.102 The second unresolved question relates to its place of origin. As Soloveitchik and others have noted, there are strong indi- cations, based on French glosses found in the work, that it was written in northern France. The book, however, was clearly influenced by Sefer hasidim of the German pietists, and may have been composed in the Rhineland area of Germany, where French was still in use.103 Nevertheless, even if the work origi- nated in Germany, we know that it reached study halls in France at the latest around 1220-1230. For our purposes, it is important to note that this Franco- German work of Jewish pietism relied on the formulations of Mishneh Torah. As Soloveitchik teaches us, Maimonides' treatment of repentance, prayer, and proper conduct ("the Golden Path") take central stage in Sefer hasidut , replacing the unique doctrines of the German pietists and of Sefer hasidim on these issues.104 The early thirteenth-century Ashkenazi authors of Sefer hasidut clearly had access to Mishneh Torah and used it in revising and modifying Sefer hasidim. We have seen three different works of Franco-German religious culture, known as Ashkenaz: a commentary to liturgical poetry, a liturgical poem, and a work of pietism, all composed in the first half of the thirteenth century circa 1215 and 1242. The cumulative effect of these sources may indicate that beyond the walls of the Tosefists' study halls, Mishneh Torah was beginning to circulate and make its mark. Once we add the names of R. Moses of Coucy and R. Isaac 'Or Zaru'a to the list of early readers of Mishneh Torah , it would seem that although Maimonides' work was not seriously engaged within the Ashkenazi study halls until the late thirteenth century, there is a good possibility that it had begun to gain a readership much earlier on.105 In addition, it is possible that inter- est in Mishneh Torah was not limited to creative individuals, but included learned laypeople of the various Ashkenazi lands. Admittedly such a claim would not be easy to substantiate for the thirteenth century. It would necessitate an in-depth 100. See Soloveitchik, "Piety, Pietism," 455-93. See also Ivan G. Marcus, "The Recensions and Structure of Sefer Hasidim," Proceedings - American Academy for Jewish Research 45 (1978): 131-53. 101. See Soloveitchik, "Piety, Pietism," 488-90 (app. II). Soloveitchik reached this conclusion based on the fact that R. Jonah of Gerona was clearly acquainted with the work and left the study halls of northern France around the mid- 1220s. 102. It is at least possible that R. Jonah became acquainted with the work only when he returned to France during the controversy over the philosophic works of Maimonides ca. 1232-33. 103. See Marcus, "Recensions and Structure," 153; Soloveitchik, "Piety, Pietism," 466. 104. Soloveitchik, "Piety, Pietism," 458-60. 105. It is worth noting also that R. Aharon ha-Kohen, author of Sefer ha-gan, active around the year 1240, cites Mishneh Torah twice in his commentary to the Bible. One of the sources appears in the recently published edition of Sefer ha-gan , edited by J. M. Orlian (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 2009), on the verse in Leviticus 21 :4. For the second citation, see Tosafot ha-shalem, ed. Y. Gellis (Jer- usalem: Ariel, 1982), 1 :65-66.

Galinsky study of the twenty-four surviving manuscripts106 copied in Ashkenazi script from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, in particular those that do not contain the glosses of R. Meir ha-Kohen.107 Based on this evidence, I would recommend examining R. Moses of Coucy's introduction, cited earlier, that in my opinion has been somewhat over- looked in the scholarly discussion relating to the spread of Mishneh Torah in thirteenth-century France and Germany.108 Regarding Maimonides, R. Moses writes: And he was a master of all knowledge; there was no one like him in these later generations. And many were strengthened in Torah by means of his books that spread in the lands of Christendom and Islam}09 In this passage, R. Moses refers to Maimonides' code as having circulated in countries of Christian Europe, a testimony that probably included the area he knew most intimately, northern France and Germany.110 While one may argue 106. Using the catalog of the Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts, I noted that out of the twenty-four manuscripts of Mishneh Torah in Ashkenazi script only seven are dated (two from the thirteenth and five from the fourteenth century). Of the seventeen undated manuscripts, the catalog lists one as " 1 3th- 14th century" and the remaining sixteen as "14th century." The dating, however, is to be considered only an initial estimate and must be substantiated by an expert. 107. 1 have limited myself to manuscript copies of the work that contain at least one of the four- teen books of the Yad. It should be noted that this number of manuscripts (twenty-four) is quite a sub- stantial amount for an halakhic work copied in Ashkenazi script during this period, indicating that at least by the fourteenth century, Mishneh Torah had become a widely circulating work among Ashkenazi readers. For the sake of comparison, it is worth noting that the number of surviving manuscript copies in Ashkenazi script of major sections of R. Moses of Coucy's Sefer ha-mizvot from this time period is roughly the same (twenty-five). I will add that a major development at the end of the thirteenth century clearly paved the way for the work's positive reception in France and Germany during the fourteenth century, namely the com- position of R. Meir ha-Kohen Ashkenazi's glosses, Hagahot Maimoniyot, to Mishneh Torah. Neverthe- less, it is worth noting that out of the twenty-four surviving manuscripts, six copies still do not include the glosses of R. Meir, and at least one (Budapest 77) had the Hagahot added more than a hundred years after the work was initially copied (altogether seven manuscripts which originally did not include Hagahot ). The particular case of Budapest 77, which includes dated colophons for both the work and for the Hagahot copied later, alerts us to the necessity of carefully examining all the sixteen copies of Mishneh Torah with Hagahot in order to ascertain when these Ashkenazi glosses were added to Maimonides' work. Finally, it is worth noting that out of the twenty-four manuscripts, some six were clearly written for people of means, judging from the professional level of the layout and the writing as well as the aesthetics of the illuminations or designs. It is also interesting that three of these six luxurious manu- script copies do not have (or did not originally have) the Hagahot of R. Meir. These data may point to the existence of a reading audience that was not necessarily rabbinic but rather lay. I hope to return to all of this manuscript evidence at a later date. 108. See, however, Twersky, Introduction , 519. 109. See above at note 36. 110. On the movement of students from Germany and countries east of Germany to study in northern France, such as R. Isaac Or Zarua and R. Meir of Rothenburg, see Kanarfogel, Peering 316</page><page sequence="25">The Significance of Form that in these lines he was referring only to certain Jewish communities of Christian Europe, such as Christian Spain, southern France, and possibly Italy with the exclusion of France and Germany,111 there is no indication of such a distinction from his words. I would argue that the evidence cited above supports taking R. Moses' report at face value.112 It is possible that already at this time at least some people in Ashkenaz "were strengthened in Torah" by Maimonides' Mishneh Torah , even if the work was not accepted by the rabbinic elite as author- itative or seriously studied in the bate midrash. I would then suggest that what prompted R. Moses of Coucy to write his "French" version of Mishneh Torah was his desire to counter the spread of Mai- monides' Mishneh Torah not only in Spain and southern France, but also in France and Germany. Although R. Moses recognized and genuinely appreciated Maimonides' "fine and praiseworthy composition" that "illuminated the eyes of Israel," he could not endorse it, essentially because the work did not take into account northern French legal teachings.113 Even if in his time Mishneh Torah was not yet widespread and influential, he may have feared that had he not offered an alternative, the code of the Spanish sage would eventually circulate widely and become accepted as the authoritative guide in France and Germany, affecting actual halakhic practice there.114 through the Lattices , 221 and the references cited there. On Isaac, see Avraham (Rami) Reiner, "From Rabbenu Tarn to R. Isaac of Vienna: The Hegemony of the French Talmudic school in the Twelfth Century," in The Jews of Europe in the Middle Ages (Tenth to Fifteenth Centuries ), ed. Christoph Cluse (Brepols: Turnhout, 2004), 273-82. 1 1 1 . On the lack of usage of Mishneh Torah among the rabbinic elite in Italy, see I. M. Ta-Shma, "The Acceptance of Maimonides' ' Mishneh Torah ' in Italy," Italia 13-15 (2001): 79-90. This of course cannot teach us anything about its acceptance among the secondary elite or among the readership of learned laypeople. 112. According to the above suggestion, there may be room to reevaluate the statement of R. Isaac Israeli who wrote at the beginning of the fourteenth century in Toledo, "And as soon as the work [of Maimonides] was made public and disseminated throughout the Diaspora, all of Israel agreed to rule in accordance with its dictates on all matters of law, rabbinic ordinances, and custom" ( Yesod ' Olam [Berlin: Kornegg, 1848], part 2, sec. 4, chap. 18, p. 35a). At first glance, this description smacks of unsubstantiated hyperbole. However, on second thought, one could argue that even if this description does not accurately reflect the reality in Ashkenaz or Zorfat, there may be some truth to his claim, at least with regard to readers of halakhic works who were not part of the scho- larly elite. 113. From R. Moses' perspective, it was irrelevant whether Maimonides was aware of the French teachings and ignored them or whether he was never exposed to them. In the final analysis, he did not make use of French legal positions when formulating his halakhic decisions. 114. One can learn much about such anxiety from the reaction of the sixteenth-century Ashke- nazi scholars to the spread of R. Joseph Karo's impressive legal works, Beit Yosef and Shulkhan Arukh, in Germany and Poland. See Y. S. Spiegel, ' Amudim be-toldot ha-sefer ha-ivri: hagahot u-magihim, mahadura shneya (Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University, 2005), 302-306, where he assembles evidence that demonstrates that the leading scholars of the time were fearful that R. Karo's works were becoming too influential on the halakhic practice of the reading public, including of their students. Although these students of R. Moses Isserles, R. Solomon Luria, and other scholars clearly realized that Joseph Karo's halakhah was not the same as their own, they nevertheless studied the work and were 317</page><page sequence="26">Judah D. Galinsky With this in mind, it is revealing that R. Moses chose to formulate his cri- tique of Mishneh Torah from the perspective of an "individual who offers halakhic rulings based upon his [i.e., Maimonides'] books."115 According to R. Moses, such a reader would probably fail in his task since he would be unable to substantiate his ruling with the proper prooftext from the Talmud, and because his decision would not correspond with French legal tradition. This point of view, of an average scholar deciding the law, can be contrasted with the earlier critique of both R. Abraham b. David (Rabad) of Posquieres (end of the twelfth century) and R. Samson of Sens (beginning of the thirteenth) who por- trayed the weaknesses of the work from the perspective of an established legal scholar, but not one who would entertain deciding the law according to Mishneh Tor ah. 116 In short, although the readership of Mishneh Torah in France and Germany around the middle of the thirteenth century may still have been limited, the poten- tial for the work's spread was real, especially among reading communities not attached to the Tosefist's bate midrash. This was because of the inherent qualities of the work, as described by Karshavya and R. Moses himself. It was this vision of the masterful and accessible Maimonidean code slowly penetrating the Jewish communities of Christian Europe, including Zorfat and Ashkenaz, that is reflected in R. Moses' critique of Mishneh Torah, 117 and it motivated him to devote his days to composing his own French version of the work. One can learn about the primacy of the French audience for R. Moses by paying close attention to his comment made in the context of partnership laws. The passage appears not only in his Sefer ha-mizvot (positive command- ment 82) but also in his Perek Zorfati , appended by Karshavya to his copy of implementing it le-halakha (in practice) because of its utility and other inherent qualities. It is true, as Spiegel emphasizes, that the powerful impact and influence of print technology made R. Karo's works a real and immediate threat. Still, I would suggest that a similar fear and anxiety was at work on R. Moses of Coucy, albeit on a smaller and a much slower-paced scale. He felt that he had to act to combat the creeping influence of Mishneh Torah during the thirteenth century. 115. See the full citation at note 38. 116. Both scholars noted that Maimonides does not mention the names of authorities from pre- vious generations nor include conflicting legal opinions. Rabad criticizes, as well, the lack of talmudic proof texts behind the decisions. Both felt that the work was written in a way that did not allow for the serious engagement of scholars. On these earlier critiques, for Rabad, see I. Twersky, "The Beginnings of Mishneh Torah Criticism,", 161-83, esp. 171, and for R. Samson, see his response to R. Meir b.

This "French Chapter," as noted above, reflects an earlier stage in the formulation R. Moses' work. A comparison of R. Moses' comments as they appear in these two sources allows us entree into R.

He writes at first, "All [the laws] that we determined [kol mah she-pasaknu] in the laws of partnership119 are according to Rav Alfasi 's rulings in his Shearim and the way they emerge from the words of R. Shlomo [i.e., Rashi], as we have explained." He then adds that at least in one instance he cannot accept R. Alfasi 's decisions because his understanding goes against that of the French sages. Thus he writes in his Perek Zorfati: For Rav Alfas diverted only slightly from the words of the Tann'aim accord- ing to the interpretation propounded by Rava in the chapter Ezehu Neshekh. And in this deviation he is disputed by Rabbenu Shlomo [Rashi] and Rabbenu Yaakov [R. Tarn] and Rabbenu Yishak [Ri], of whom all the sons of France drink from their waters and accept their decisions [she-kol bene zorfat shotim memehem ve-tofsim ikar divrehem].120 R. Moses, as I have argued, when writing his Perek Zorfati , wrote with a local French audience in mind; hence, he notes that R. Alfasi 's interpretation goes against the accepted interpretation of the French scholars, whose authority was acknowledged by all Jews in France. When R. Moses, however, inserted the above passage into his Sefer ha-mizvot at positive commandment 82, he made a seemingly minor change in the wording that may be of telling significance. Instead of writing about the sons of Zorfat accepting the authority of Rashi and the Tosefot, he substituted " she-kol yisra'el shotim memehem ve-tofsim ikar . . ,"121 - that all of Israel drink from their waters and accept their words as law.122 This minor revision may indicate that some time after writing his perakim and completing his book of commandments R. Moses began to contemplate the possibility that his work could appeal to readers far beyond his vicinity. Hence the change from bene 118. See David E. Sklare, "R. David ben Sa'adya al-Ger ve-hiburo Al-Hawi," Te'uda 14 (1998): 110-11. 1 19. In the Perek Zorfati he writes somewhat less accurately, "All [the laws] that we determined in this book ." 120.

This is the reading of the text in the printed version of Sefer ha-mizvot as well as nine med- ieval manuscripts that I checked, including Paris - Bibliotheque Mazarine 4472, which usually pre- serves R. Moses' original formulations. On the various authorial recensions of the work, see Peles (note 12), 17-24 and his introduction to Sefer mizvot gadol ha-shalem (Jerusalem: Machon Yerusha- lyim, 2003), 2:17-24. 319</page><page sequence="28">Judah D. Galinsky zorfat (sons of France) to kol yisrael (all of Israel), a change echoed in his intro- duction to the negative commandments.123 R. Moses may have wished that his work would be acknowledged as an improvement on the earlier Mishneh Torah and adopted by Jews all over. Realis- tically, however, his primary reading audience was destined to remain French, and possibly German, Jews to whose sense of pride for their indigenous legal traditions he could appeal.124 Conclusion In this study we have analyzed R. Moses of Coucy's program and purpose in writing his Sefer ha-mizvot. Although it would seem that the initial impetus for his project came during his preaching mission outside of France and to answer the requests he received, once he started to write, he wrote as a Frenchman, more con- cerned with the short- and long-term fate of the Tosefist's legal traditions. R. Moses' work was to serve as an alternative to Mishneh Torah , incorpor- ating many of its unique features, such as scope, structure, language, and even a fair amount of its legal content. At the same time, his Sefer ha-mizvot diverged from its model in a number of crucial areas, notably in its overall structure. Wishing to remain grounded within French tradition, R. Moses decided to convert the Maimonidean format of an integrated legal code to that of a book of commandments, a format with good French precedent, as in the work of R. Eliezer of Metz's Yere'im. He accomplished this by dividing Mishneh Torah into two parts, according to its most basic building blocks, the positive and nega- tive commandments.125 Two other areas differentiated R. Moses' work from that of Maimonides - the centrality of French legal traditions, mainly of the Tosefists, and the inclusion of talmudic sources for each of the laws. A close reading of both introductions (negative and positive command- ments) indicates that R. Moses had two main reading audiences in mind when he wrote his book. The first consisted of students of Talmud and mature talmudic scholars, whose free time was almost solely devoted to Talmud study. For this reader he offered a Mishneh Torah-type book that would serve as a supplementary aid to the Talmud, as an instrument to assist both scholar and student alike in ful- filling the all-encompassing religious obligation of Talmud Torah , Torah study. The second group consisted of readers who were not full-time Talmud scholars, 123. Compare to the passage in his introduction cited above at note 40: "Moreover, in several places his interpretations and his halakhic rulings, are disputed by the pillars of the Torah and its great men . . . from whose waters all the wise men of the latter generations drink." 124.

It is plausible that R. Moses of Coucy's decision to structure his work in such a way was in some measure influenced by Karshavya (Kreshbeya)'s use of Mishneh Torah in composing his ' Azharot . Both scholars were clearly frustrated by the lack of structure and order to be found in classical French works, as in the listing of mizvot in previous French ' Azharot , such as those of R. Eliyahu or in their explication by R. Eliezer of Metz's Yere ' im . 320</page><page sequence="29">The Significance of Form and included the learned layperson. For this reader he offered a work that would serve as an alternative for the Maimonidean code, Mishneh Torah , whose work was spreading throughout the Jewish communities of Christian Europe. In the final analysis, R. Moses may have entertained hopes that his work would spread throughout Christian Europe, but even he realized that his true read- ership remained quite close to home. His most basic wish was to transform Maimonides' grand idea into an idiom that was not only understandable but also acceptable to all the different reading audiences of France and Germany: students of talmudic law, religious intelligentsia, and learned laypeople.126 Judah D.
