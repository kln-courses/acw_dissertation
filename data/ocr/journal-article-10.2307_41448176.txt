<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS The Human Animal. By Weston LaBarre. University of Chicago Press, 1954. Pp. xv + 372. $6.00. In this attempt to formulate a unified anthropological view of man, the two main categories of interpretation are man's biological evolution and the orthodox psychoanalytic theory of human behavior. As an anthropologist, LaBarre is interested in culture, interpreted as a function of biological evolution. In fact, he is so insistent on the biology of culture and human behavior that he refers to man time and again as "the human animal." In depicting man's organic evolution he makes extensive comparisons with other species, and particularly with the apes. One wonders whether apes today more closely resemble the behavior of some common ancestor than we do? All mankind is one species, says LaBarre, with the important dif- ferences between "races" being functional or cultural, rather than biological. Culture is " man's ecology." It has freed man from biological evolution; continued evolution for him is cultural. ". . . the emanci- pated hand has emancipated man from any other organic evolution what- soever. With man, genetic evolution and organic experiments have come to an end" (p. 89). An important aspect of cultural evolution is its " fantastic speed " when compared to biological ; in addition, man has to pay no genetic price in physical specialization for his cultural evolution. Chapters 10 and 11 are concerned with the analysis of com- munication, and the change from phatic to symbolic. The former gives "information about an individual animal's state of mind" (p. 57), and commits LaBarre to anthropomorphism (pp. 8, 18, 57, 165, 334) ; the latter refers to language. The development of language is related to biological evolution: language could have been developed only by an animal with man's organic evolution. LaBarre demonstrates quite effectively that our conception of reality is determined for us by the structure and concepts of our language. Thus language, which is the means to knowledge, is also effective in forever concealing from us the picture of reality as we would find it were we free of language. The effect of this cogent argument is later dissipated, however, when LaBarre tries to show that language is basically emotional rather than cognitive. Cultural behavior, which is distinctly and singularly human, is interpreted by LaBarre in terms of orthodox psychoanalytic theory.</page><page sequence="2">94 BOOK REVIEWS Everything centers around the oedipal situation and the permanent breast. Relations between the sexes, and differences in behavior between the sexes are biological-psychoanalytic: for example, generalization is male, but "biologically, women are closer to realistic particulars" (p. 212). It is "small wonder" that women in general are more "psycho- logical-minded than men . . . They have to be, biologically." (p. 215). LaBarre's hatred of the father and adoration of the mother is not based on empirical investigation but on faithful acceptance of the word of his own god, namely Freud. One wonders to what extent this biological- psychoanalytic theory is or can be useful in relation to further study. For example, in what way will the study of human culture be advanced by applying individualistic concepts to collective phenomena? This is what LaBarre does when he concludes that the wisdom of a culture "is often enough mere senile dementia." (p. 365). Psychoanalysts may agree with LaBarre's unrestrained application of psychoanalytic interpretations to cultural evolution, but hardly any other group will. The last chapter, "Three Minutes to Midnight," is concerned with the current scene. Militarism and political absolutism are conceived as imminent threats to continued cultural evolution; human speciation is now and has for long been cultural rather than organic. Whatever one may think of specific details of The Human Animal , it should be said in its favor that LaBarre's position is openly stated throughout, even though it may be controversial. A good example is his conclusion that the hypothesis of the soul is a garment ill fitting modern man: it is poor physics, bad embryology, bad biology, poor psychology, and "a wholly inadequate anthropology." (p. 302). The Human Animal , because the theme of the biological evolution of behavior runs through it from beginning to end, will probably appeal forcefully to those whose intellectual orientation is to biology.
