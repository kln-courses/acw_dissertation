JUNE 23, 1927 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY RIGNANO'S HYPOTHESIS OF A VITAL ENERGY AND THE PREREQUISITES OF A SOUND THEORY OF LIFE IN his recent book, Qu'est-ce que la vie,1 Rignano has developed a theory of the living organism which differs from any of the three traditional vitalistic, mechanistic, or teleological types of theory and which, nevertheless, is to a certain extent a combination of all of them. His theory is vitalistic in the sense that he asserts the presence in living things of a strictly biological factor which is not present in the inorganic. It differs, however, from a vitalistic theory such as Driesch 's because this biological factor is not imperceptible. Life is a form of energy, si generis. The theory is teleological to the extent that it rests upon and emphasizes the tendency to self-maintenance and restoration and reproduction, which is so characteristic of life, and also because it insists that there are characteristics in organic systems forcing one to judge them teleologically, which do not exist in inorganic proc- esses. The theory develops by emphasizing the teleological charac- teristics of life rather than by tending to ignore them. It is not teleological, however, in the sense of introducing the end or final state as an essential cause. The teleological appearances exist and they do not reduce to the principles and entities of physics and chem- istry, but their presence is due to the existence of a new type of energy possessed of the property of mnemonic accumulation. Given a universe of electrons and protons and this purely biological kind of energy, systems with the teleological characteristics exhibited by living things follow. The teleological attributes of life result, neither from any mysterious foresight nor from the entrance of a final cause, but from the properties of an energy which, since it gath- ers up the past, tends to maintain, preserve, and restore what that past has produced. Teleology results, not from the working of the future in the present, but from the accumulations of the past in the present. The mnemonic character of this energy makes a living 1 Qu'est-ce qq6e la Vie? Nouveaux essais de synthese biologique. EUGENIO 'RIGNANO. (Bibliothleque de Philosophie contemporaine).

X" 2 The theory is non-mechanical in the sense that it denies the complete validity of the physico-chemical categories to account for life; it is mechanical, however, to the extent that it admits them as partial causes and is deterministic. The argument to the theory rests upon the fact that living things exhibit essential characteristics which inorganic systems do not possess. These characteristics appear, not only in the higher forms, but in every stage of physiological development from the more simple processes of assimilation and metabolism to those com- plexities which involve the compounding of affective tendencies to produce the moral and legal elements in human society. There are certain dynamic, spontaneous, teleological characteristics of living things which inorganic systems do not exhibit. Therefore, Rignano argues, these characteristics prove or suggest the existence of an energy of an entirely different type from that present in the in- organic. Furthermore, given this energy and assuming a correla- tion between its manifestations in the objectively observable tend- ency to the maintenance of the normal physiological equilibrium and in the subjectively known psychical factors termed "desires," "needs, etc., it is possible to account for the psychical as well as the physical life of man. Its deductive fertility combines with the argument from the fact of the essential difference between the or- ganic and the inorganic to justify Rignano in its acceptance. The specific considerations which lead him to this conclusion merit attention. In assimilation and metabolism certain facts not present in the inorganic stand out. Organic material is the result of an active, not a passive process of synthesis, he says. In the crystal, organization occurs, but it is the result of a process in which the elements are, passively deposited. In this connection Loeb is quoted. " Ce pouvoir synthetique de transformer de petites 'pierres de construction' en composes compliques, specifiques pour chaque organisme, constitute le 'secret de la vie' ou, plutot, un des secrets de la vie.'" 3 Life "s'agit . . . d'un processus actif de synthese et de reconstruction." 4 2p, 165. 3P. 11.</page><page sequence="3">RIGNANO'S HYPOTHESIS OF A VITAL ENERGY 339 But this is not all. An organism, Rignano says, is a dynamic equilibrium which tends to maintain itself. Not only is it a com- plicated system produced by what seems to be an active process of selective synthesis, but this active process seems to function teleologically to preserve what it has produced. M. Pieron is quoted as saying: "Tout se passe dans la matiere vivante, comme si la preservation d'un equilibre chimique instable constituait son but immanent." 5 Creative, selective, spontaneous activity seems to be combined with teleology in living things. The most important point appears when Rignano attempts to show that the synthesis involved in the stability of living things can not be explained by the traditional physico-chemical principles. In this connection he puts his finger upon one of their significant peculiarities. They involve an unusual combination of stability and instability. Dissociation plays as important and essential a part as association in organic stability. Rignano uses this fact to prove the absurdity of the mechanical theory of assimilation. His argu- ment may be stated as follows: a mechanical explanation accounts for a given phenomenon by tracing it back to previous factors; this is impossible with reference to organic synthesis, since the physico- chemical elements which are the immediately previous factors that must constitute the coordinative mechanism are in a state of dis- sociation and flux. If one attempts to escape the difficulty by assuming a stable mechanism existing apart from the dissociating substances, then an absurdity arises, since the mechanism must be assumed to vary with the degree and chemical nature of the dissociation in the precise way necessary to produce the normal equilibrium. "En d'autres termes, il doit y avoir, entre le mecanisme synthetiseur et le processus de desintegration, le meme rapport qui existe entre la medaille et le coin quit sert 'a la frapper: lorsque celui-ei change, la figure de la medaille subit un changement correspondant; de meme avec le changement du processus de desintegration, doit changer aussi, et en parfaite correspondance, le meeanisme d'integration." 8 The physico-chemical fact at the basis of this argument has been emphasized by the English physiologist, J. S. Haldane. He has pointed out 7 that protoplasm, the fundamental substance in living things, is unstable. Instead of being the kind of physico- chemical material which can account for the stability of the system in which it appears, it depends upon the relations in which it stands for its own stability. Instead of looking to the physico-chemical 5P. 14. 6P. 12. 7 The New Physiology. London, 1919, p. 35.</page><page sequence="4">340 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY materials to explain life, it seems as if we must look to life or a positive creative teleological process of synthesis to account for the existence of the materials. The peculiar part which instability and dissociation play in living systems can not be ignored. It presents a problem which traditional mechanism needs to consider more seriously. From these facts Rignano draws the following conclusion: "C 'est ce que Loeb n'explique pas. Aussi l'id6e qui se presente spontane- ment a 1 'esprit est-elle que la vie consiste en un processus e'nerge'tique synthetiseur qui englobe dans son tourbillon la substance qui nous appellons vivante et qui, lorsqu'il cesse, laisse cette derniere a la merci des seuls agents physico-chimiques naturels qui sont surtout de d6sintegration. " 8 . . . It is quite clear upon Rignano 's theory that if this vital energy were not present, the most simple organic systems would not exist. The fact of chemical synthesis is but one element in his argu- ment. Its more general basis is revealed in the following statement: "En presence de touo ces faits qui distinguent si nettement le phe- nomene de la vie, dans ses manifestations les plus generales et les plus elementaires, de tous les phenomnenes dn monde inorganique naturel, lesquels ne presentent rien de semblable, il est permis de se demander, nous semble-t-il, s'il est vraiment conforme 'a 1'esprit scientifique de s'obstiner h nier, contre l'evidence, que ces faits pr6sentent quelque chose de substantiellement diffrent de la ph6nomenalite ordinaire purement physico-chimique, et de con- tinuer en consequence a pretendre que les seules lois physico- chimiques doivent suffire 'a les expliquer; ou, plutot, s'il ne serait pas plus conforme a la saine methode positive de chercher si, en formulant I'hypothese d'une nouvelle forme d'e'nergie,-soumise par ailleurs et a tous egards aux lois generales de 1'e'nergetique, mais dou6e de proprietes elementaires bien d6finies, diff6rentes de celles qui sont inherentes aux diverses formes d'e'nergie du monde inorganique. . . . " 9 When Rignano passes to a consideration of generation and regen- eration, of adaptation to environment, and of the more complex and higher processes, both individual and social, the evidence ac- cumulates to support this hypothesis. The argument, however, is the same as the one given above. The existence of harmonious de- velopment in morphology emphasized by Driesch, and the fact that the embryo develops as if it were guided or directed by an occult intelligence or entelechy much after the manner in which a tech- nician constructs a machine is noted. The inadequacy of the theory 8sp. 20. 9P. 22.</page><page sequence="5">RIGNANO'S HYPOTHESIS OF A VITAL ENERGY 341 of chance variations to account for adaptation to environment, is emphasized. In this connection Rignano urges two points. First, there is no process of natural selection in the inorganic. Second, the Darwinian theory presupposes a positive tendency to persist which is characteristic only of the spontaneous and teleological con- sequences of a vital energy. A study of behavior in even the sim- plest forms confirms Rignano in the same conclusion. The trial and error mechanism and the capacity to react without external stimulation together with the presence of a positive tendency to maintain the animal "dans son optimum d'ambiance" imply the spontaneity and teleology of a strictly biological factor. When Rignano considers the reflexes and the instincts, the psy- chical side of life appears. It is because, in the higher stages of development, the reflexes are so unequivocally adjusted to the main- tenance of the normal physiological state that they have given rise, he says, to the conception of the organism as a machine. It is simply because the positive tendency to maintain the normal has become stereotyped in the reflex, that mechanism is plausible. But just as a machine which exhibits a fitness for a certain function implies its creator so the organism with its regular tendency to main- tain the normal physiological state involves that which preserves the neutral materials as instruments for a certain end. It is only when one regards the reflex as "la fixation mnemonique graduelle de la tentative reussie, executee sous 1 'impulsion de la tendence affective correspondante" '10 that it becomes intelligible. The fundamental mnemonic character of both reflexes and instincts makes it neces- sary to study the affective tendencies for a complete understanding of the nature of life. In this study the richer psychical content of the vital energy appears and a unified theory of the bodily and psychical life of man is traced out and developed. The theory rests upon the method of hypothesis and the introspective evidence for the connection be- tween psychical and objective physical factors. In all forms of life there is a tendency to remain in a stationary physiological state or to return to it. "Si nous reservons la de'lomination d' 'af- fectives ' 'a cette categorie speeiale de tendances organiques qui, 8ubjectivement, chez 1'homme, se manifestent comme 'besoins,' ou 'appetits,' ou 'desirs,' et, objectivement, chez 1 'homme et les animaux comme mouvements, completement executes ou a 1 'etat naissant, pourvu qu'ils presentent un aspect non mecanise, il devient possible de ramener toute une serie de tendances affectives ainsi definies a une seule et unique tendance fondamentale, inherente a n'importe quel organisme: tendance 'a 1 'invariance physiologique. &lt; 11 loP. 105. ii Pp. 107 and 108.</page><page sequence="6">342 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY The affective tendencies fall in'to three groups: those which ex- hibit themselves in instincts, as behavior which does not have to be learned; those involving Jennings' principle of "the readier reso- lution of physiological states," which arise "par voie d'habitude"; and finally those which are derived or compounded from the first two. A study of mental and social activity is made to demonstrate that the will, the emotions, the attention, and the reason, together with the moral and legal aspects of society, can be defined in terms of these two groups of fundamental affective tendencies. Since both of these groups are mnemonic in character and nothing more or less than the expression of the vital energy, Rignano is able to present his hypothesis as a theory of the psychical as well as the physical life of man. There is a continuity of development evident in Rignano 's theory which must commend it to anyone. The picture of the co- ordination of the physico-chemical materials to produce life with its spontaneity and capacity to learn and to preserve what has been learned, together with the correlation between the psychical and the biological which results in the final production of the rich cultural and social life of man provides a view of life which a gen- eral observation of man and his relation to nature and society seems to support. It must be admitted that the general picture involving the physical and the psychical and the combination of both to pro- duce the rich spiritual life of man is very close to the truth. The general impression left by Rignano's theory is one which will com- mend it to many people. The fac't that it appears to offer an escape from an unscientific vitalism or a teleological position which negates positive research will commend it to many more. However, one must not allow the very satisfactory general pic- ture of the union of the physical and the psychical to cause one to mistake a general description of the facts to be explained for a proof of the existence of the vital energy proposed as their expla- nation. The real question is not whether this general ou'tline of the development of life is more or less true, but whether such a de- velopment justifies the thesis that life involves a vital energy with the peculiar property of mnemonic accumulation. There are two ways to answer this question. One is to assume his arguments against mechanism to be valid and to determine whether this energy has the capacity to produce the development which he has ou'tlined. The other is to determine whether the facts to which he refers necessitate or give a reasonable basis for the acceptance of a strictly biological type of energy. We shall consider the theory from the deductive point of view first. A query is in order with reference to the meaning and significance</page><page sequence="7">RIGNANO'S HYPOTHESIS OF A VITAL ENERGY 343 of the psychical element in his theory. He says unequivocally that the "marque psychique" of all the phenomena of life is only "une marque mnemonique." 12 It is by maintaining this that he is able to give a causal and deterministic account of biological teleology and thus to escape the charge that his hypothesis discourages scientific research. Thus he says, "Les 'causes finalistes' sont scientifique- ment inadmissibles, lorsqu'elles sont conques comme un 'futur' qui evidemment, ne peut agir avant d'e^tre. Mais dans le fiialisme bio- logique ce n'est pas le futur qui agit, mais le passe, par les accumula- tions mnemoniques." 13 Again he says, "Nous n'avons pas d'avan- tage en besoin d 'invoquer 'un principe interne, co-substantiel, guidant et coordonnant les actions particulieres des diverses parties de l'organisme, en vue de la realisation d'une fin.' I 214 The psy- chical side of life is not a cause, but an expression of the imprint of the vital energy with its fundamental property of mnemonic ac- cumulation. As expressed in the above quotations the theory is consistent. It must be noted, however, that it is utterly incapable of accounting for the facts which mechanism is supposed to leave unexplained. If this vital energy has no property other than that of being able to actively preserve the past, it follows that it can produce no effect which has not been produced before. It does not initiate new lines of activity, it merely preserves and repeats what has been initiated by other causes. This serves very well to account for learning, but it fails completely to account for the chemical synthesis involved in the chemical organization of life which makes an organic system possible. In his first chapter Rignano goes to great pains to inform us that living things involve a type of chemical organization which the traditional principles of physics and chemistry are incapable of producing. Assuming this contention to be true, it means that the vital energy must begin with chemical elements, scattered here and there in nature, which are incapable of organizing themselves. If the new energy is to be competent to bring order out of the chem- ical chaos which the argument against mechanism has created, it must coordinate into stable organic systems physico-chemical ma- terials which can not co6rdinate themselves when conditioned by the traditional principles. It is quite obvious that an energy possessed of no property other than that of actively preserving what the past has produced would be useless. Since the past would be constituted solely of inorganic systems or chemical flux, there would be nothing 12 P. 163 13 p. 161. 14 P. 161.</page><page sequence="8">344 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY to be accumulated but the systems and flux of the inorganic. In- stead of accounting for the peculiar type of chemical organization present in living things such a factor would merely preserve the systems and the flux of the inorganic. We have come upon the fatal weakness of all arguments to vitalism. They prove too much. There is no point in introducing these additional purely- biological causes unless organisms would be impossible without them, but if such is the case, then the or- ganization necessary for the effectiveness of an entelechy or a vital energy possessed of mnemonic properties does not exist. The problem of biology is the problem of organization and the prob- lem of organization is the problem of accounting for the origin and stability of a peculiar type of physico-chemical relatedness. If the traditional principles of physics and chemistry can account for this organization, entelechy or a vital energy is unnecessary, and if the traditional principles are inadequate then these biological or psychological factors are useless. Without the physico-chem- ical materials organized to give the vital energy an established type of organization to preserve by means of its property of mnemonic accumulation, the energy is worthless, and with the or- ganization it is unnecessary. It is only because the vitalists of either the physical or the metaphysical type fail to take their arguments against the mech- anists seriously that their theories of an entelechy or a vital en- ergy become plausible. If the arguments against the mechanists which make the introduction of these new entities or factors nec- essary are sound, the laws of physics and chemistry must be conceived of as leaving the chemical elements, involved in life, scattered throughout nature in a state of flux. In such a situ- ation an energy possessed of nothing more than the property of mnemonic accumulation would be as helpless and incompetent a source of organization as a cork in a hurricane in a boundless ocean. If mechanism is inadequate it must be realized that the materials are not at hand to provide the organization which a vital energy is to "remember" or to provide the possible chemical re- actions which entelechy is to suspend. Instead, entelechy and this vital energy must go out into a chaos of trillions and trillions of molecules which can not organize themselves into organic groups and select one here and another there and bring them together into a certain place to build up a system which is stable. The properties which these vital factors possess immediately eliminate them as adequate for such a task. The problem of organization is the problem of explaining how unstable chemical materials and a peculiar combination of chemical association and dissociation</page><page sequence="9">RIGNANO 'S HYPOTHESIS OF A VITAL ENERGY 345 join together to form a physico-chemical equilibrium which per- sists for a certain length of time. To propose a solution by the introduction of entelechies or units of vital energy is but to use- lessly complicate a situation in which there are too many entities and in which there is too much energy already. The occasion calls neither for entities nor for energy, but for some coordinating principle which can supplement the traditional principles of phys- ical science to get the simplest type of organism into existence. One other difficulty arises concerning the adequacy of an energy with a purely mnemonic quality. Rignano, in deducing the ele- ments of the psychical life from this fundamental factor, included desires, appetites, and the will. In speaking of chemical synthesis he also speaks of choice. If desire or choice has as its reference the mere maintenance of that which has already been realized this exposition is consistent, but if either refers to the production of something not yet attained, then the present is conditioned by an ideal to be realized in the future and not solely by what has been accumulated from the past. He is unable to keep away from the latter alternative, for he says, "II n'existe donc aucune separation entre les agents qui dirigent les phenomenes et les phenomenes qui sont guides, agents dirigeants et phenomenes guides etant une seule et meme chose: accumulatioins mne'moniques en cours d'activa- tion." 15 "C 'est precisement 1'accumulation mnemonique qui porte la fin en elle-meme, c'est-a-dire qui porte 'a 1'etat potentiel telles ou telles activites physiologiques, a l'activation des-quelles par consequent elle tend et dont 1 'activation constitute precise- ment la fin en question. " 16 The last sentence means that this vital energy is not merely something which accumulates what the past has realized but that it possesses from the outset, within itself, everything that can ever become past. In other words, it possesses the ideal activity and form which is not yet realized. This is essential if it is to play the part ascribed to it in the origin of new species or if it is to escape being the useless thing described above. But if this is admitted the vicious teleology which he condemns is present. Phenomena are conditioned not only by purely observable physical factors existing in the present, but also by an imminent poteiitiality which will only be realized in the fu- ture. This is the final cause of Aristotle, no matter how much reference to it as connected with energy may disguise the fact. As such, it is subject to the criticism which its author launches against final causes. The vicious type of teleology which Rignano tries to avoid is possible providing he limits the vital energy to a purely 15P. 164. 16 P. 164.</page><page sequence="10">346 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY mnemonic property. The difficulty, however, is that such a type of energy is useless to solve the problem which is raised. Only by regarding the energy as containing within itself the principle which it preserves does the theory become even slightly plausible. If something other than mechanism is necessary it is a coordinat- ing principle and not additional entities or energy. As Aristotle clearly perceived, a coordinating principle, or as he termed it, form, is meaningless as a thing in itself. It thus becomes necessary to re- gard both matter and form as characteristics of an irreducible proc- ess of development. This is the only meaning that can be found for a relatedness independent of the entities which are related. It is important to note that such a thesis has two consequences. One is the acceptance of teleology, the other the denial of the primacy of the physical chemical categories even as partial fundamental causes. They become merely more or less permanent characteristics of a process of change, owing their apparent individuality to an act of the observer when he tears them from the process to turn them into entities of thought. To assert that activity or process rather than stuff is fundamental is to maintain the principle of becoming. This principle means that time introduces something new. From this it follows that a given phenomenon is not wholly conditioned by past factors and hence that teleology is inescapable. If one agrees with Rignano in the contention that teleology is vicious there seems to be no other alternative but to examine more thoroughly the ca- pacity of mechanism to account for the peculiar type of organic relatedness which the traditional principles seem to leave inex- plicable. What are the merits of the theory of a vital energy when con- sidered from the inductive point of view? The three most signifi- cant facts which constitute the argument to the theory are the psy- chical characteristics of living things, their dynamic characteristics, and their teleological tendency to maintain the normal physiological state. In the higher forms of life the psychical aspect is an evident fact. However, this fact can not constitute a proof of the existence of a purely biological type of energy. The psychical may be the property of a mind entirely separate from matter and energy or a correlate of the matter of the inorganic. It is to be noted that ma- terialism implies the existence of the psychical, for it can only make its case against Aristotelianism in the face of the obvious facts of colors and sounds which are in nature, by presupposing a mind to take care of these factors which its physical categories ignore. A truly scientific materialistic physics and a thoroughgoing behavior-</page><page sequence="11">RIGNANO'S HYPOTHESIS OF A VITAL ENERGY 347 istic psychology are incompatible. The psychical attributes of man prove nothing, therefore, concerning the existence of a vital energy. The spontaneity exhibited by living things also constitutes a most questionable basis for an argument to such a factor. Rignano says: "Les tendances des corps inorganiques sont dues a des forces qui leur sont exterieures et qu'ils subissent; les tendances affectives des animaux, au contraire, sont dues a des forces internes, inde- pendantes des forces exterieures et autonomes 'a 1'egard de celles-ci.17 "De la decoule 1'aspect d'activite et de spontaneite dans le com- portement des etres vivants, en opposition absolue avec 1'aspect de passivite et d'inertie qui caracterise la matiere brute.18 If, instead of considering vital energy in contrast with brute matter, we are fair to materialism and make the comparison with inorganic energy, the argument that the inorganic categories are incapable of accounting for organic spontaneity becomes a bit fantastic. For energy is that which does work. It certainly is difficult, even in the realm of the anthropomorphic, to find anything any more inherently creative and spontaneous and dynamic. One might add that it is not an unknown attribute of certain organic systems, some of which are not the lowest in the paleontological scale, to exhibit a certain pas- sivity with reference to the exhibition of this property which is the very essence of inorganic energy. It must be admitted that it is very difficult to conceive of anything more dynamic and independent of external causation than inorganic energy. If spontaneity is all that is required there seems to be no reason why the ordinary energy of inorganic science will not do. Not only is the ordinary energy of physical science capable of ac- counting for the dynamic characteristics of living things, but it pro- vides the only exact account of why there is less of the spontaneous in the inorganic. In the eighteenth century Lavosier noted that the organism is tied into the inorganic universe. He noted not only that there is an exchange between plants and animals of oxygen and carbon dioxide, but also that all organisms stand in an essential relation to the solar system. Living things depend upon energy from the sun for their own origin and existence. Stated in thermo- dynamical terms this means that they require work to be done upon them in order to exist. This is undoubtedly one of the most funda- mental characteristics distinguishing organic from inorganic sys- tems. The latter combine spontaneously, often releasing energy in the process; the former require energy to be put into them in order to be produced. I am indebted to Professor F. H. Pike of the De- partment of Physiology of Columbia University for impressing the 17 P. 115. 18 P. 115.</page><page sequence="12">348 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY signifieance of this fact upon my mind and also for pointing out that the fallacy involved in regarding life as a special form of energy was noted as early as 1870 by Wyeville Thomson in his Edinburgh address. It is quite obvious that systems which give up energy when they are formed should be less spontaneous than those which gain energy in their formation. When we combine with this the fact noted by Rignano in his discussion of assimilation and metabolism, that an organic system involves chemical decomposition as well as chemical combination and that this dissociation results in the breaking down of organic compounds to release the energy con- tained in them, it becomes obvious that no special kind of energy is required to account for the spontaneity and "internal causation" exhibited in living things. Nor is the situation different if we view the fact of spontaneity from the point of view of matter rather than energy. Mechanism can stand up before the two facts of stuff or conservation and change only by accepting the atomic theory. It is an entirely false con- ception of the ultimate physico-chemical entities which regards them as inert and subject only to external causation. There is no point whatever in physical mechanism and its atomic theory unless it accounts for change. It can not do this unless the atoms are conceived to be in constant motion. Since the void is impotent and there is nothing aside from the atoms except the void, it follows that the source of their motion must be internal and not external. The motion of the atom is as spontaneous and completely conditioned by internal causation as the behavior of the most pep- pery fighting cock one can imagine. If we, knowing the fundamental principles of the atomic theory, were to come into this universe for the first time without the present habit of thought which takes the passivity of the inorganic for granited, there is little doubt but that the question we would ask would not be why organisms are so spontaneous, but why inorganic systems succeed so thoroughly in masking the spontaneity of the elements out of which they are constructed. It is a peculiar mental intoxication which causes certain in- dividuals upon the observation of spontaneity in living things or upon the mere pronouncement of the phrase, "the dynamic atom," to solemnly read the obituary notice of materialism. Why the com- bination of moving electrons and protons to form a chemical element should not produce a system, the parts of which are moving, and why at least certain molar systems should not exhibit the dynamic characteristics of the basic elements which constitute all systems, seems difficult to understand. If a special kind of energy is re- quired to account for the differences between living and non-living</page><page sequence="13">RIGNANO'S HYPOTHESIS OF A VITAL ENERGY 349 things, it would seem that its task should be to mask the appearance of spontaneity in the inorganic rather than to produce it in the organic. In emphasizing the presence in the organism of an appearance of teleology which is absent for the most part in the inorganic realm, the argument for a strictly biological factor rests upon more solid ground. Yet here also a word of warning must be uttered. The experimental work which has revealed this appearance of teleology has also indicated that in many cases, at least, it can not be taken at its face value. What appears as such turns out often upon closer examination to be the reverse. There is, for example, the classical case reported by Jennings 19 of bacteria originally distributed evenly in a field of water into which at a certain place a drop of oxygen is introduced. If we look at them again after a time they are all found collected within the drop. What could be more teleological? They need oxygen for the maintenance of the normal physiological processes and they go into the drop to get it. Suppose, however, that instead of being content with an observation of the first and last state, we examine the intermediary stages of their behavior. Jennings tells us that they swim about at random. As a result, their paths take them sooner or later into the drop. They do not stop, how- ever upon arriving there. Instead they proceed directly through to the other side, where, upon entering the region devoid of oxygen, they reverse their course and proceed back to the opposite side to repeat this procedure. It is as if a man came into a room in need of a match to light his pipe and finally arrived at the holder upon the mantel when a procedure of rectilinear motion and deflection, analogous to that of the billiard ball with reference to the sides of the billiard table, finally took him around the room again and again until he bumped his nose into the match case. We would scarcely brand such behavior as teleological. An example quoted from Rhumbler by Bayliss in his Principles of General Physiology is also quite to the point. "If a fine bit of glass rod be pushed against a drop of chloroform under water, it can not be made to enter the drop; on releasing the pressure it is immediately rejected. If, on the contrary, the rod be first coated with shellac it is at once sucked in. As soon as the shellac is dis- solved by the chloroform the rod is thrown out again. . . . One might say that the chloroform will have nothing to do with substances that it can not digest, and when a mixed food particle is presented to it and accepted, it digests a part and rejects a non-assimilable remainder." 20 Certainly one must insist that this appearance of 19 The Behavior of Lower Organisms, p. 29. 20 P. 3. (London, 1915.)</page><page sequence="14">350 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY teleology reduces to physico-chemical causes. Something more than an appearance of teleology is necessary, therefore, to warrant the assertion that categories other than the physico-chemical exist. Yet any adequate theory of life must indicate why the appear- ance is present so often in the organic and so rarely in the inorganic. This does not mean, however, that one is to argue directly to the existence of a vital energy. Such an argument is fallacious because adjectival differences do not necessarily involve substantial ones. An adequate treatment of this problem involves a study of the peculiar type of physico-chemical organization present in an organism, in its relation to the fundamental principles which condition the movement of matter and energy in space and time. We must first observe and agree upon the essential characteristics peculiar to the type of chem- ical organization present in a living thing and then determine whether the traditional principles are capable of moving matter and energy about to produce such an organization before we can decide whether the teleological appearances necessitate categories other than the physico-chemical. This analysis has gone far enough in the work of L. J. Hender- son 21 to indicate that if the adaptation and teleology apparent in life involve something more than the traditional principles, a purely biological or psychological category such as entelechy or a vital en- ergy is wholly inadequate as the missing factor. His work shows that there is a fitniess of the environment for life as well as an adap- tation of life to the environment and that this fitness has its basis not in any interaction which occurred after life originated, but in the properties of the chemical elements which were determined at the time of the formation of the inorganic universe. This means that the adaptations and fitness and teleology, so evident in living things, have their basis in the very foundations of the inorganic. Life is not an after-thought produced by the mys- terious appearance of a vital energy after the inorganic universe was formed. It is grounded in no special private category, but in the fundamental principles which condition everything. Provision was made for it when the properties of the chemical elements were de- termined. It is because the adaptation and teleology to which Rig- nano points is not strictly biological in its basis, but has its origin in the fundamental principles of the inorganic, that a purely bio- logical category is inadequate to account for it, if some new prin- ciple is necessary. The dynamic and teleological characteristics of living things and their many adaptations point to something very much more fundamental than a vital energy. The factors which reveal the inadequacy of the hypothesis of a 21 The Fitness of the Environmeent, 1913.

For one thing, we must look to the funda- mental principles which move matter and energy about in space to produce atomic, molecular, and molar systems. The first and most important task is to determine precisely what are the fundamental characteristics of an organic system. This brings us to one funda- mental fallacy in all discussions of this problem. We have argued directly from isolated selected characteristics as if all physico-chem- ical systems were and must be like inorganic physico-chemical sys- tems. Then, when we find that there are characteristics in an or- ganism which do not exist in a stone, we conclude that there is a vital energy or an entelechy or a teleological principle in one which is not in the other. It does not seem to have occurred to any except a few rare thoughtful physiologists, who have never developed their philosophy, that the difference between the two systems may be due to the fact that the fundamental principles of physical science have organized the physico-chemical materials in a different way in an organism from what they are in a stone- and hence that it is folly to discuss the characteristics of living things without making a study of the peculiar type of physico-chemical organization upon which those characteristics depend. There is nothing in connection with the theory of the organism which needs to be more emphasized than the fact that the first re- quirement of a sound theory is a clear conception of the peculiar type of physico-chemical organization which a living organism in- volves. Just as the general physico-chemical architecture of a whirlpool or a crystal is different from that of a stone, so an organic system is different from any of them. Put a stone in a vacuum and it still remains a stone. Its relation to its environment is relatively -unimportant. Shut off the oxygen supply in this room for even a few moments and we cease to be living organisms. The elements outside of an organism are as essential a part of a living thing as the materials which, because they are solids or semi-solids, we erudely speak of as its body. The air we breathe is as much a part of an organism as the materials of its bones. To build a theory of the organism without noting these facts and going on to deter- mine exactly what the general characteristics of this peculiar equi- libriumn between internal and external elements are, is to attempt to arrive at a theory of an organism without having even the most elementary conception of what an organism is. We have noted this same fact in connection with energy. Its relation to an inorganic system is entirely different from its relation to an organic one. Rig- nano in his first chapter puts his finger upon another fundamental differentiating characteristic. There is a peculiar combination of</page><page sequence="16">352 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY association and dissocia'tion in a living thing. Chemical instability plays as great a part as chemical stability in life. Any sound theory of the organism must begin, as Rignano begins, with the differences between the organic and the inorganic, but instead of assuming that the problem ends there, with the simple statement that a something exists as the condition of these unique character- istics, we must realize that the problem is in its most elementary stages. The differences are signs of a different type of organization. We can not determine whether they involve principles other than those of the inorganic until we carry on a careful analysis and ob- servation of the organization of the animal as a whole in its relation to the energy and elements of its environment to determine what the nature of this organization is. Once the essential observable and verifiable characteristics of an organism are known it is a simple problem in formal logic to determine whether or not life is con- ditioned by the traditional physico-chemical principles. One has merely to determine whether the propositions which describe the essential characteristics of this new type of system can be deduced from the first principles of traditional inorganic science. When we have a sound objective picture of the peculiar type of organization involved in a living organism, the theory will take care of itself. The occasion calls for the imagination to conceive of a type of physico-chemical organization different from that present in the in- organic, and for some practical means of getting a representative organic system before us as a whole and yet sufficiently analyzed into its significant elements, that we can perceive its essential character- istics. "Life seems," as Wyeville Thomson said, "to be more a prop- erty of matter in a certain state of combination than a force." 22 With a careful determination of the peculiar and essential charac- teristics of this " state of combination," any adequate theory of the organism must begin.
