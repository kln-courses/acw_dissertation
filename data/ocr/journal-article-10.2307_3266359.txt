<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Biblical Literature periods together as Stratum I seems problematic, especially since Biran notes that in the sacred precinct there were at least two phases each in both the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Because it is accessible to non-specialists, Biblical Dan could serve as a supple- mentary text in introductory biblical studies or archaeology courses and could also be useful for study groups in churches or synagogues. Keith L. Eades Upland, CA 91786-3026 YHWH Is the Husband of His People: Analysis of a Biblical Metaphor with Special Ref- erence to Translation, by Nelly Stienstra. Kampen: Kok Pharos, 1993. Pp. 252. ?59.90. In YHWH Is the Husband of His People, Stienstra promotes an awareness that bib- lical metaphors function not only as primitive rhetorical devices but also as crucial cog- nitive keys for interpretation. The book begins with a review of primary theories for understanding metaphor (chap. 1). Stienstra focuses on metaphorical concepts as coher- ent systems of meaning in which the cultural background of a concept serves as a "donor field" contributing to the "recipient field" of the metaphor itself. Stienstra then deals with the theological problem of using human language to describe God (chap. 2) and argues for a careful distinction between anthropomorphic literalism and anthropomor- phic metaphor. She takes to task those who would remake biblical metaphors into their own cultural image, holding that it is better to understand a metaphor's meaning within its unique context. In chapter 3, Stienstra highlights the cultural background for the book's model metaphor through a discussion of marriage and family relations in ancient Israel. She then sketches out the basic metaphor and its many corollaries as it appears in Hosea (chap. 4), and in other books such as Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Jeremiah (chap. 5). Stienstra finds only hints of the marriage metaphor in the Pentateuch and suggests that the lack of its development there (particularly in Deuteronomy) may argue for an earlier date of composition than normally accorded by modern scholarship. In chapter 6, Stienstra deals with translation theory and takes issue with modem translations that do not remain true to the ancient metaphors. Stienstra's work is painstakingly thorough, and the frequent repetition of pet phrases such as "the titular metaphor of this monograph" is somewhat grating. Though tedious to read, the book provides a helpful contribution to the study of biblical metaphor. Tony W. Cartledge Apex, NC 27502 Sage, Priest, Prophet: Religious and Intellectual Leadership in Ancient Israel, by Joseph Blenkinsopp. Library of Ancient Israel. Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1995. Pp. xii + 191. $19.00. Joseph Blenkinsopp (Notre Dame) has distinguished himself with an impressive 726</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews publishing record marked by judiciousness, balance, and common sense, as he pushes our understanding in fresh directions, but in a way that is congruent with the main flow of scholarship. This book is no exception to the kind of balanced judiciousness we have come to expect from him. He has taken up, in turn, the social roles of sage, priest, and prophet, and has considered the religious-intellectual leadership of Israel in those roles. In my judgment, Blenkinsopp's study is a model of sound method. He is asking his- torical questions and aims at the recovery of Israel's ancient historical reality. He is attentive to methods now emerging in OT studies, e.g., anthropology and social history, and more particularly "role theory." But he keeps his methodological interests and awarenesses rigorously in the service of his substantive research agenda. Thus he is no methodological purist but makes use of various methods as they serve his investigation. He takes into account, moreover, the density of the tradition and the ideological impact of the canonizing process, but he does not seek a "pure" historical reality behind the canonizing process, as though the canonizing process is an unmitigatedly distorting enterprise. He is realistic and sensible about the evidence that is available and the con- clusions that are credible in the midst of this dense tradition. Unlike some purists among the social scientists, Blenkinsopp proceeds in a way that pays primary attention to the witness of the text in all of its complexity, yielding outcomes that are credible but not remote from the claims of the text itself. His long discussion of the sages begins with an insistence (in disagreement with R. N. Whybray) that the sages are institutionally locatable and identifiable. Blenkinsopp takes up the gains of recent sapiential study and weaves them into a credible general portrayal of the sage. He takes Ben Sira-of whom we know the most-as a "profile of a Jewish intellectual in the Hellenistic period." He goes behind that Hellenistic evidence to consider the creation of a "moral consensus" in clan and household, which then is absorbed into the state system of power and control. He considers state sages in the time of Hezekiah as practitioners of literacy who served and constituted "the ruling elite" who practiced "a class ethic." With that basis (which follows the general contours of consensus scholarship) Blenkinsopp then considers in turn the feminine dimension of wisdom in Proverbs, and the theodic tensions voiced in the books of Job and Ecclesiastes. He observes that the "naturalistic ethic" of wisdom is peculiar in Israel, both because of its "cultural hostility" and because it was drawn into the orbit of Torah. Like everyone else, Blenkinsopp's survey of priesthood is limited and stymied by the problematic of complex and obscure historical evidence. He reviews the evidence and a variety of possible explanations concerning the Levites, Zadokites, and Aaronites. His discussion, in my judgment, takes on fresh power when he leaves the (for now) insoluble historical questions in order to consider the priestly literature and the liturgi- cal intention reflected in that literature. Here Blenkinsopp follows his own earlier work, in order to consider the anthropological approach to the material especially associated with Mary Douglas concerning creation as "the making of a conceptual scheme" and the ways in which the literature and its liturgic practice embody, imitate, and guarantee the reliable ordering of creation. Blenkinsopp's summary of these priestly inclinations indi- cates how profoundly scholarship has moved beyond the older issues of historical recon- struction to a recognition that the text as such is indeed a priestly performance. Concerning the prophets, Blenkinsopp considers the evidence of early individual 727</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Biblical Literature figures, ecstatic groups of prophets, and the Deuteronomic revision of the prophetic role. His primary interest, however, is in the four prophets commonly assigned to the eighth century-Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, and Micah-whom he regards as "dissident intel- lectuals" and "agents of change." He understands them-in a way not unlike that of Michael Walzer-as those who protest and dissent against the coercive power of the state with its economic exploitation intrinsic to that political coerciveness. It is curious, since Blenkinsopp is primarily noted for his attention to later emergent Judaism, that he has paid no attention here to the sixth- or fifth-century prophets but stays in the frame- work of conventional prophetic studies. Apparently he stops at the point where the prophets lose their dissident edge and become establishment figures. In my judgment, Blenkinsopp has provided a model study in two regards. First, he has offered a reliable synthesis of the most recent work in social history and anthropol- ogy, weaving the evidence into a coherent, sensible pattern. Second, he has shown how to take seriously recent methodological gains in social scientific research without falling into a reductionist dismissal of Israel's own theological self-understanding. In these two ways Blenkinsopp offers a happy overview that avoids excessive speculation or faddish methodological preoccupation. The book will be an excellent introduction for novices and a base-line for future study. Blenkinsopp suggests that these several offices com- peted for control of "the redemptive media" in Israelite society. Perhaps a next step, which Blenkinsopp does not undertake, is to consider the ways in which these several roles clashed or were allied in their articulation of a self-conscious Israel. Blenkinsopp has provided a reference point for important work now to be addressed. Walter Brueggemann Columbia Theological Seminary, Decatur, GA 30030 Priests, Prophets, Diviners, Sages: A Socio-Historical Study of Religious Specialists in Ancient Israel, by Lester L. Grabbe. Valley Forge, PA: Trinity Press International, 1995. Pp. xviii + 261. $20.00 (paper). Professor Grabbe (University of Hull) has written a useful survey of the leadership roles (specialists) that are most visible in ancient Israel in the OT period. As might be expected, he takes up in turn the king, priests, and prophets, and to these he has added "the wise," reflecting the recent emergence of the sapiential traditions as a focus of scholarly interest. For each of these "offices" he offers a social-scientific survey of the data related to them. Along with these standard topics, it is of special interest that Grabbe has included an extensive discussion of "diviners, healers, and others," which pays attention to evidence for divination and shamanism. The book is an attractive representative of a new, quite self-conscious enterprise which attends to anthropological and socio-historical methods of historical reconstruc- tion. Grabbe sets out to articulate a "critical minimum" on the subject (p. 206), i.e., the most that can be said with any confidence, according to the rigorous methods he has taken for himself. Beyond that methodological commitment, the study seems to be firmly situated in a skeptical perspective that flourishes in Britain at the moment, which regards any theological dimension to interpretation as fideistic and lacking in critical dis- cipline. 728</page></plain_text>
