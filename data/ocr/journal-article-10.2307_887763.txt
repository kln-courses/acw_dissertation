<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXHIBITION REVIEWS Kendal and Leeds Sculpture exhibitions Of the generation of English sculptors who emerged in the 1980s Alison Wilding has been the least publicised and her work is perhaps the most enigmatic. Her exhibition Intensities' at Abbot Hall, Kendal (closed 23rd November) gave an opportunity to appreciate both the material and the poetic qualities of her art. Wilding has always been exceptionally attentive to the nature of materials, especially their colour and the way they catch, absorb, deflect or reflect light. The installation at Abbot Hall, which is entirely lit by side windows, made this especially clear. The morning light caught the two sculptures installed downstairs in the rooms filled with eighteenth-century furniture and paintings, and shone through the emerald green of the large Drowned, exposing its inner struts - as so often in Wilding's work it is like seeing the nucleus of some primitive form. Amoeba-like, it seems at the same time uncannily mechanistic in the precision of its crafting. This strangeness was accentuated by the Georgian chairs and game table in the room. Likewise Echo (1995; Fig.49) in the next room glittered in the morning sun and, thus illumined, the brass ball buried in its fretwork of stainless steel seemed to come to the surface like some rising buoy. Here too, installed in the room devoted to portraits by Romney, the work's curious amalgam of the mechanistic and the anthropomorphic, of oddness and grace, fitted well with the older art, each becoming more poignant and curious in their unex- pected companionship. (Such an installa- tion of the brand new with the old recalled the little noticed exhibition entitled Private view of recent British and German artists at the Bowes Museum, County Durham last summer.) Upstairs in the official exhibition rooms the small sculptures poised on the window- sill, when penetrated by the afternoon light, revealed internal copper lumps or wiring like heart or nerves within their pyramidical forms. On the floor, the show's title work (1997; Fig.48) was again a play on the organic and geometric: the surface on the floor, part matte, part gloss, holding a dia- mond shape that echoed the upright form beside it. Once more it seemed more animate as the light struck it, showing the surprisingly puckered skin. It is Wilding's ability to take simple shapes such as this diamond and'reconfigure them, rendering them awkward yet paradoxically elegant, that is perhaps her defining quality. Many of the formal pleasures of these works were repeated in the accompanying drawings that showed both the gestation of simple shapes, hovering between organic and geometric, and a sensuous delight in paper and the drawing materials - not just water-colour and pigment, but silicone fluid. The crumpled and wrinkled paper she sometimes employs echoes the rumpled rubber of some of her sculptures. Wilding's was an exhibition about sculp- ture as mass and light-revealing surface. Its constant metaphor was of gestation and ani- mate life; its character governed by the touch of the making and forming hand. In 48. Intensities, by Alison Wilding. 1997.

Their premise is more conceptual, their ways of making are in the service of intellec- tual programme rather than being a virtue in themselves. For this 1990s generation if there is a 'lump', a material object, it is not large and commanding in the centre of the room, but rather small and on the margins. Elizabeth Wright arranged a line of squashed, unnat- urally elongated beer cans; Steve Johnson admittedly showed bronzes, but cast thirty times too large from tourist trinkets. Vin- cent Shine pinned to the wall two delicate simulacra of clover plants, one painted green, the other white. They seemed like specimens floated out of context, and, indeed, the notion of definition or typology underlies much work here. In other works the 'objects' are only insinuated: Christo- pher Williams screened a video of a woman listening to headphones: she smiles ner- vously and puffs on a cigarette, but we have no real idea what amuses her, for she says little and we cannot hear what she hears. Judging by this show, the new British sculpture is small-scale, quizzical, concep- tual, its focus not the thing itself but the liminal, the notional object and its space.

Curtis in her catalogue essay2 suggests that the new relationship of the audience to the 'sculpture' is akin to read- ing, and that translation will prove an espe- cially useful term to comprehend its workings. Certainly many of these artists use words, but their interest seems to be more in the elusive, the intangible, the sug- gestive. It is this that makes this exhibition so intriguing. Maybe what we have here is not that over-familiar trope of the eighties, Duchamp's readymade, but explorations of his more puzzling concept of the inframince.

He has reprocessed the original recording of sup- posed silence and tabulated the barely detectable notes of wind, rain, birds and distant conversation: for Huyghe there is no absolute void. As much as Wilding does, these artists refer to space and how we inhabit it; but their spaces are not so much 'real' phenom- enological ones but social or imaginary. The notion of cyberspace haunts this exhi- bition as a seemingly inevitable metaphor for imagination or memory. This parallels the way in which, in the arena of public art, the biomorphic bronze 'turd' in the plaza has been replaced by the site-specific 'pro- Rouen and Brescia Jacques-Emile Blanche 'The Arts' loomed large in the childhood homes ofJacques-Emile Blanche at Auteuil and Dieppe. His father, a famous aliiniste in a renowned medical family, numbered among his patients Theo van Gogh and Maupassant; and his visitors included Gounod as well as a handful of Impression- ists. Blanche might have been a musician, a writer or a painter. Though he plumped for the last, he never relinquished his other early passions, and the friendships he culti- vated - and celebrated in numerous por- traits - were with the pre-eminent authors and composers of the time. He did, in fact, try his hand as a novelist, and he was a prominent critic of contemporary painting and literature; and he is at least as well- known as a prolific annaliste of his age. Now, more than half a century after his death and a memorial exhibition at the Orangerie, the Mus6e des Beaux-Arts in Rouen (to 15th February),' has chosen almost one hundred paintings from a vast and far-flung euvre (the museum itself owns one hundred- and-fifty works) by which to re-evaluate Blanche the painter. Blanche painted the middle classes, at home and at play. The paraphernalia of meal-taking allowed him to indulge his verve for still life (his training was in Manet's studio). There is a marvellous painting here, not shown before, of Sickert and his mother at breakfast in Neuville (c. 1908; cat. no.36; Fig.52), in which the artist's attention is focused as closely on the accoutrements of the dining-room - a china teapot and silver coffee-pot, fine porcelain, two Staffordshire dogs - as on the two figures, caught in freeze-frame. (Like Sickert, Blanche often used photographs, post-cards and press cut- tings as starting-points for his work: this composition was derived from a photo- graph, but one which reveals far more modest furnishings than these.) He was fas- cinated by decoration, did his home up in an extraordinary blend of Chinese and old English styles, and enjoyed translating the varied effects of coromandel screens, shellac 1 I i: i 6= ~1 "' B I ? zi ;i F 3 P r P r Y ; ii --- "t 3 r I 1 r, pr j I, i ~t~bi 3~ 65 j b43 ~ "- b;; ::::~ D 54 EXHIBITION REVIEWS ject' responding more to social and cultural context. Perhaps the quintessential work here is Adam Chodzko's Involva Act I and II of 1995-96. Having placed an 'advertise- ment' in a pornographic contact magazine of a drawing of a forest and the question 'do you want to join me in this place?' he received seven answers. These letters of reply he photographed in Hampstead Heath. At Leeds the drawing faced the photographs - tease against desire - both real and invented landscapes becoming phantasmagoric. Obviously there is an implicit return in all this to an element relatively neglected in sculpture of recent decades - narrative. Moreover, there is a curiously persistent pathos to much of this work. In Richard Woods's 18 Choppers (Fig.51), children's bikes are corralled together and all painted in the garish style of that ubiquitous vehicle: how- ever, in a strange reversal of the expected typology, only one is actually a 'chopper'. Though the layout of this exhibition superficially resembled the chaos of late 60s shows such as MWen Attitudes become Form, in fact every work was clearly in its own space. In this sense there is a debt to Wilding's gen- eration, with its sense of display and the work's autonomy. This is an important exhibition in trying to characterise what happens next in sculpture, or indeed what is already happening, and how the Henry Moore Institute will deal with it. As an insti- tute predicated on the notion of support for sculpture, it must come to terms with a new generation whose concept of sculpture is a dematerialised one. Indeed, some of these artists would describe themselves not as sculptors but artists pure and simple. Per- haps we are seeing the genre's collapse, whether temporary or not, into an art of 'objects in an age of cyberspace'. Can a sculpture exist without palpable form, out- 51.
