Books on Dante and his work continue to pour forth, so it seems, in a never-ending stream, year after year and month after month. This can, of course, be considered only as a tribute to the great author whose seventh centenary we are celebrating this year. There can be no doubt that others will continue to be published for many years 'to come in homage to Dante's universal appeal and all-embracing genius. One of the more recent books dealing with Dante and his greatest work is Dante and His Comedy by Professor Allan Gilbert, whose interest in Dante and other great Italian writers of his period goes back almost half a century. Different in purpose and approach from that of most other books on the great poet, it is a welcome addition to the already vast number of such books and should be read by all lovers of Dante's poem and especially by those who teach it, either in the original or in translation and whether or not they are old masters in the field or novices just starting. Serious consideration of the problems discussed, the questions raised, and the interpretations proposed by Mr. Gilbert might well change in greater or lesser degree their approach to the teaching and interpretation of many passages of this masterpiece. Before entering into the matter of interpretation of passages and similar critical matters in the Commedia it seems desirable to describe briefly the make-up of Mr. Gilbert's book. The text itself occupies one hundred seventy-one pages and is divided into six main chapters, which are broken down into many subdivisions set apart in the chapter: the latter are in turn further divided into smaller divisions, whose titles are carried at the head of the page as they appear. The six main chapters are entitled: i. " Fact or Fancy? " 2. " Poetry " 3. " Comedy " 4. " Religion " 5. " Beatrice " 6. " Punishments and Rewards." To give a clearer idea of the subdivision of the chapters. I shall now give those under chapter 3 " Comedy "; they are " Comedy through Dante's Eyes," " The Comic Hero," " Epic Figures Lowered," " Common Life in Action " (itself divided into " Inferno and Purgatorio and Paradiso ") " Similes from Daily Life " and " Generally Recognized Comedy." I count a total of twenty-three subdivision titles carried at the top of the pages of this one main chapter. The seventh chapter (pp. 172-191) is called " Outline Analysis of the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 197 Commedia " and is a very valuable and extremely useful adjunct to the foregoing discussions. Next follow an Index (pp. 193-199), then the " Key to Passages from Dante and His Commentators " (pp. 200-207) all given under the division and line of the poem to which they are related. On the last page of this division we have a list of the fifteen authors and the two anonymous works. This final division is entitled " Commentators on the Commedia "; they range from Dante's sons to C. H. Grandgent and William Vernon. One can easily see that this is no book to be read lightly or hurriedly. I doubt if anyone seriously interested in Dante could or would do so, for nearly every page raises questions of interpretations of passages made over the years and covering the point under discussion throughout the whole of the Commedia. Mr. Gilbert's main thesis is that there is far more of comedy in the literal sense of the word than most commentators are willing to admit and that it is far from being totally the allegory that it is sometimes considered to be by commentators, critics and readers. This detracts in no way from the greatness of the Commedia, but rather adds to it. He asks, for example, how much that Dante " sees " is reality, how much is pure fiction. He suggests that " Vision " might be a better title for the book. A few examples of the questions (perhaps unanswerable) that Mr. Gilbert puts to the reader are: p. 31. " Why is smoke the punishment of the angry in Purgatory? Is it irritating like anger or, on the contrary, does it oppose the swift violence of wrath? Did Dante not make the allegory clear enough to gain for it immediate recognition? Must the reader who penetrates it turn from rapid impression to delaying logic? Even then can he be sure his solution is correct? " p. 66 " Is it possible to justify Dante's choice of title against the objections of Boccaccio? Or must we suppose that he applied the word " comedy " in a mood of humility when, knowing his tendency to egotism (Purg. 11. 118; 13. 136), he wished to remove his work from competition with the tragic Aeneid (Inf. 20o. 113) or even with Lucan's Pharsalia? How seriously are we to take the traveler's reception by the poets in Limbo (Inf. 4. 00oo)? Does this mean that the historical Dante believed his own product equal with that of Virgil and the others, or is the fictitious sightseer a literary critic, as it were, delighted to enter the company of the great, just as later he was privileged, as an admiring listener, to catch something from the conversation of Statius and Virgil (Purg. 22. 128)? pp. 95-96 (speaking of the passage concerning the eagle in the Para- diso) " Yet for what level of taste did Dante plan this extraordinary experience? Had he been astonished by some marvelous display of fireworks, making use of the latest development of gunpowder, or even of the older Greek fire known to Florentine warfare? Did he regard the mechanical image of the eagle as so impressive that all men must look upon it as dignified, or may he have had some of that pleasure in the crowd's taste with which we now can look upon such wonders? Is this a marvel fit for</page><page sequence="3">198 REVIEWS Dante the traveler, whose " childish " thought is pleasantly accepted by Beatrice (Par. 3. 26)? p. 124 (speaking of the griffin in the Paradiso) " He knows that Scripture condescends to human powers by attributing feet and hands to God (Par. 4.43), yet he himself presents no anthropomorphic God. Even the Holy Spirit as a dove, however Biblical, has no place in his poem. In representing divinity, he concedes to human weakness as little as he can. Is is likely that he abandons such a practice to typify the Second Person of the Trinity as a mythological draft animal? But the poet is in the reader's hands; each man may interpret the allegory as he will." pp. 169-170 (speaking of the uniformity of appearance of the in- dividuals among the redeemed) " After Saint Benedict has spoken feelingly of his order, the traveler, with courtesy but yet as though not much in- terested in what has been said or in the lights, asks if he can see the saint without his brilliant disguise (22. 60). The latter politely answers, then turns back to the topic interrupted by the traveler's irrelevant inquisi- tiveness. Are we to suppose the questioner wearied by the monotonous lack of individuality in the appearance of the redeemed? " No reviewer could possibly, in the space at his disposal, list more than a few of the questions he raises or the interpretations he proposes. I also doubt that any one teacher would agree to any more than a small portion of them in most cases. Be that as it may, I am sure that the book will be received as a worthy and useful addition to the vast resources already available. I hope that it will have its place in every library of standing and also in that of every teacher of Dante's works. Reading it and pondering over it will be a profitable and rewarding experience for the teacher and the specialist, as well as for every other person truly interested in what Dante has written for the centuries to read and meditate upon. WM. MARION MILLER Miami University THEOPHIL SPOERRI: Dante und die europdische Literatur. Das Bild des Menschen in der Struktur der Sprache. Stuttgart: W. Kohlhammer, 1963. 209 pp. This is neither a historic nor a romantic nor a scholastic nor a neocritical but an existential introduction to the Divina Commedia. It is existential insofar as Spoerri in the midst of a behavioristic world of relativities shares with Dante the belief in absolute values coming from a Supreme Being who can at any time break directly or indirectly into the life of an individual and lead him through a cleansing process to a sincere knowledge of self, to purity and truth.
