<plain_text><page sequence="1">Die Ikonographie Pal?stinas/Israels und der Alte Orient: Eine Religionsgeschichte in Bildern, Band I: Vom ausgehenden Mesolithikum bis zur Fr?hbronzezeit, by Silvia Schroer and Othmar Keel. Freiburg: Academic Press Fribourg, 2005. 392 pp., 9 figures, 262 catalog illustrations, 3 maps. Cloth. 44.00. Ambitiously broad, Die Ikonographie Pal?stinas/Israels und der Alte Orient: Eine Religionsgeschichte in Bildern, Band I: Vom ausgehenden Mesolithikum bis zur Fr?h bronzezeit is an analytical survey of the iconography of ancient Israel/Palestine within its Near Eastern context. Temporally, the authors address material dating from the Natufian period through the Early Bronze Age; geo graphically, their scope extends from Palestine to southern Mesopotamia. The publication includes a clearly presented and well organized introductory chapter divided into three parts. The first part, "Forschungsgeschichtliche Situierung des Pro jekts," includes a narrative description of the research his tory of the project, including a brief discussion concerning the relationship between the study of the material culture of ancient Palestine/Israel and text-oriented biblical schol arship. Iconographie analysis requires an authoritative text, and the use of the Bible as that authoritative text is, obvi ously, problematic due to the temporal and cultural dispar</page><page sequence="2">2007 BOOK REVIEWS 101 ity between the subject matter and the texts used. Although emphasis is placed on the biblical texts as a source of in sight, the authors are careful to note that excavating their narratives for kernels of knowledge regarding the meaning of particular motifs is of very limited use; rather, it is the independence of these two disciplines that ensures the in tegrity of each and therefore facilitates their useful coop eration. The methodology used in their investigation of the iconography of Israel/Palestine is that of the Freiburger School, and this section includes a brief survey of the his tory, theory, and method associated with this approach. Of particular interest are the authors' remarks on the contri bution of their research to biblical studies, in light of the fact that so much of the material covered in this volume dates to preliterate periods. Schroer and Keel stress that the two can be mutually informative if the scholarship per mits a dialogue, and that this dialogue can serve as a means of posing questions and challenging assumptions of and within each discipline. The second part, "Verh?ltnisbestimmungen: Wort Bild-Kunst," is an abbreviated discussion of the nature of ancient art and the ambiguous relationship between word and image. Readers will find a fresh take on the familiar digression as to whether ancient images can be construed as "art" (pp. 21-23) which includes numerous citations of recent works. The third part, "Anlage und Organisation des vorlie genden Werkes," is a lucid and concise presentation of the organization of the volume and is immeasurably helpful to the reader. In this section, the authors present a cultural and geographical overview of the volume and the methodolog ical and organizational principles used. Additionally, they define their corpus and describe the procedures used in the selection and arrangement of the catalog. The body of the book is organized chronologically into four main sections: the Natufian, Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Early Bronze Age. The beginning of each section in cludes a listing of the general, critical literature that is the foundation of the scholarship regarding that period. Within each of these sections, the authors give an overview of those issues that they have distinguished as being quintes sential of the period in question, a discussion of the subjects of the visual art of the period, and a consideration of the sig nificance of these issues and subjects in light of biblical texts and scholarship. At the end of each section is a catalog of selected images. The discussion of the Natufian period (ca. 12,000 10,000 B.c.) is brief but satisfying; the chapter is eight pages long, including the map and a catalog of four arti facts. The authors do a tremendous service to their reader ship by providing an exhaustive listing of general resources as well as thorough citations of specific, and often very re cent, works. The result is a concise and useful overview of scholarship regarding the Natufian cultural assemblage. The chapter on the preceramic and ceramic Neolithic period (ca. 9400-5800 B.c.) spotlights the depiction of ani mals and anthropomorphic forms as subjects of Neolithic art. There is a section that focuses on a seated female figure from Shacar Hagolan, followed by a digression questioning old interpretations of anthropomorphic figurines as objects of veneration. The authors challenge the popular interpre tation of female figurines depicted cupping, cradling, or offering her breasts as fertility idols. Citing as comparanda early Egyptian images wherein a goddess is depicted nurs ing the prince, it is suggested that in an era where the an cestors seem to play a critical role in the legitimization of authority and territory, this image may be read as a refer ence to a legitimizing connotation associated with nursing and nurturing (pp. 61-62). This tantalizing proposal then segues into a survey of skull preparations and ancestor stat ues, with examples drawn from Ain Gazai and Jericho. The chapter on the Chalcolithic period (ca. 4500-3600 b.c.) focuses on the visual themes of homed quadrupeds and birds, standing female figures, and the depiction of plants and vegetation. In the discussion of relevant biblical refer ences, the authors address the homed quadruped and bird as symbolic imagery. An embarrassment of riches, the fourth and final chap ter, on the Early Bronze Age (ca. 3500-2300/2000 b.c.) is longer than the first three chapters combined and has far greater depth in terms of both scope and subject. Due in no small part to the emergence of early urban civilization, the symbol system in play grows increasingly complex, and the authors are obliged to incorporate discussions on thematic comparanda from Mesopotamia and Egypt. These themes impact the visual language of Early Bronze Age Palestine/ Israel due to the increasing influence of these civilizations, both throughout the region and on one another. Rather than presenting the catalog as a single entity at the end of the volume, images pertaining to each chapter are conveniently presented at the conclusion of that chap ter, with the images on the reader's right side and the cat alog entries, including references to provenance and related bibliography, immediately to the left. The illustrations are consistently crisp and explicit. Because the authors' priv ilege subject matter over style, the clear, uncluttered line drawings with simple stippled effects are almost certainly preferable to photographs, which are not used and are not missed. Particularly relevant to this volume is a deceptively small assertion that it is the corpus in its entirety, the body of work characteristic of a given period and place, that may be referred to as "art"?specifically, the art of that period and place (p. 22). A survey of the iconography of such a corpus is inherently challenging. To identify iconographie elements that characterize the art of a given period and place is a formidable work of synthesis, a process that priv ileges the whole of the corpus over the individual artifact. This process requires, out of necessity, a certain degree of framing and editing. Form, including material and tech nique of manufacture, as well as archaeological context and style, are virtually absent from the equation; also absent is a consideration of audience, for both the images in question and the biblical texts. The intent of this mode of analysis</page><page sequence="3">102 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 348 is to understand the meaning of the symbol, not the mean ing of the individual artifact. Mirroring the methodology, the resulting insights and conclusions are broad and re late to those trends and general themes associated with the identified image-subject. There is a very useful chart at the end of the volume that demonstrates the evolution, or transformation, of these se lected key themes over time. Extrapolating images from the catalog, this graphic summarizes the trajectory of change in the iconography of ancient Palestine/Israel from the Natufian period through the end of the Early Bronze Age: from the depiction of wild animals to farm animals; from the voluptuous female forms of the early Neolithic period, to the female erotic; from the iconography of ancestor ven eration to pious images of servitude to the divine; and from the depiction of earthly warfare to a mythical battle against chaos. The authors serve the material well by integrating their findings and analyses in a lucid and cogent manner. Due to the audacious geographic and temporal breadth addressed, Die Ikonographie Pal?stinas/Israels und der Alte Orient: Eine Religionsgeschichte in Bildern, Band I: Vom ausge henden Mesolithikum bis zur Fr?hbronzezeit is an ambi tious undertaking. The authors are to be commended for resisting the temptation to overindulge in digressions. In stead, the prose stays on point and the reader is given the benefit of the authors' meticulous insertion of citations identifying a source where a small fact or idea can be fur ther explored. This consistently thoughtful and thorough incorporation of relevant bibliographic citations, in addi tion to the exhaustive bibliography at the end of the vol ume, render this a valuable reference work.
