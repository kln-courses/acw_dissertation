      <p>Readers of this excellent book would do well to get the basic facts about champagne by first reading the beautifully illustrated section on champagne in <italic>The Wines and Vineyards of France: A Complete Atlas and Guide</italic> (New York, 1990), edited by Pascal Ribéreau‐Gayon. Guy’s narrative construction requires that the basic viticultural and enological facts be fed to readers only sporadically throughout the text wherever relevant. She begins with the marketing of champagne and its intimate connection with bourgeois rituals over the period 1789–1914. Champagne is an upmarket item, nicely illustrating Voltaire’s remark that the superfluous is a necessary thing. Like good bordeaux, fizz became popular first in Restoration London; the craze spread in early eighteenth‐century France and continued in the reign of Louis XV. Tales of upper‐class indulgence are plentiful, sometimes gaily displayed in paintings like the <italic>Déjeuner d’huîtres</italic> by Jean‐François de Troy (1735). Even the frugal monarch Frederick William I of Prussia loved this <italic>gotter Wein.</italic> Influential and beautiful women gave champagne a sex appeal unique in the wine business.</p>
      <p>Big firms soon came to control the export market in the champagne business. Cliquot conquered Russia; Roederer, also strong in the Russian market, invented <italic>Cristal</italic> for Alexander II. Small companies producing cheaper froth were unknown outside France but controlled the domestic market. This is not to say that French consumers did not drink posh labels. Being a new wine with an upscale aura, champagne needed a distinguished pedigree, “a ‘mythic’ past that linked wine and a family name” (17). Marriage alliances with noble families was one effective way of associating the producer and his product with the sociocultural baggage carried by the nobility. In the eighteenth century this kind of interbreeding was called “manuring one’s field.” Since many newcomers in the champagne business came from the German states, marrying into old French families had the added advantage of integration into the regional social structure. What is now called the Syndicat des grandes marques de Champagne began in 1882 as an organization of firms classifying their wine as <italic>grande marque</italic> to signal its authenticity to foreign markets. A guarantee of quality and purity became important in a saturated market. And the long but largely legal battle began to reserve the name of champagne for wine produced in a limited area in France rather than allow it to be used as a generic word for sparkling wine. The champagne industry produced different qualities of wine for different consumers, ranging from Dom Pérignon for the pretentious rich to Aÿ <italic>mousseux</italic> for the impecunious bohemian. Different degrees of sweetness were devised for different markets, ranging from the Russian <italic>doux</italic> to the British <italic>brut.</italic> Britons drank nearly half the champagne exported in 1896. Not that champagne has ever been an item of mass consumption: only a small number of the world’s population drink wine, let alone champagne. Perhaps it “became a subject of mass culture” (11). Carbon dioxide (the bubble‐forming gas in champagne) was not the only gas essential to the formation of the bourgeois identity: in the 1890s the most popular and highest paid entertainer in Paris was <italic>le Pétomane</italic> (the king of flatulence) at the Moulin Rouge.</p>
      <p>Wine is a much‐manipulated product of the agro‐industry; champagne is the most manipulated of wines, with even the vice of chaptalization turned into a necessary virtue. Champagne is also a blend of wines from several varieties of grapes that come from many different vineyards (Krug’s Clos du Mesnil is the most famous exception). Many of these vineyards were small properties owned by <italic>vignerons</italic> who sold their grapes to the wealthy <italic>négociants</italic> who were the champagne producers. The champagne makers bought grapes and wine from the cheapest sources, including some in the Languedoc. This practice angered the <italic>vignerons</italic> in the Marne, who constructed their own version of the French myth of <italic>terroir</italic> and promoted the notion of the <italic>terroir</italic>’s distinctive product of unique taste, the <italic>goût de terroir,</italic> a gustatory concept with a controversial enological history. In chapter 3, entitled “Industry meets Terroir,” Guy takes us through a century of conflict over these issues (1789–1890). Big firms bought up as much land in the Marne as possible, especially when it was cheap. By 1900 Moët &amp; Chandon owned 365 hectares, but given the expanding market for fizz they still needed to buy grapes and wine from other grape growers. The grape growers of the Marne (the department in which the three most famous champagne‐producing areas are located), believing in the uniqueness of their <italic>terroir,</italic> wanted to limit authentic champagnes to those made from grapes grown in the Marne. Well organized, literate, and politically active as Radical‐Socialists, these <italic>vignerons</italic> were able to give the politically powerful and rightist <italic>négociants</italic> a good fight and cause confusion at the national level.</p>
      <p>The social tensions arising from economic and political issues were exacerbated after the 1870s by the spread of the root‐sucking phylloxera aphid (<italic>Phylloxera vitifoliae</italic>), terminator of the French vine. Although the <italic>négociants</italic> were slow to realize that the only defense against the disease was replanting with American rootstocks grafted onto French vines, the peasant <italic>vignerons</italic> had their own fantasies about phylloxera, including the belief that the Marne was immune. In this time of tension a great deal of anti‐German feeling resurfaced against the “Kraut” <italic>négociants,</italic> the ones with German names and distant Teutonic roots. Guy integrates her treatment of this great vineyard plague into a discussion of the national debate over finding a solution to the problem, which included a long search for the rootstocks appropriate to local soils. The Champagne region was lucky in being hit last with the disease, for that allowed it to profit from the sufferings and solutions in other wine areas. Paradoxically, a drop in grape production in the Marne was matched by an increase in champagne production. Falsification (use of grapes and wine from outside the Marne) became a hot social issue complicating the issue of replanting. One result was clear: a drop in the price of vineyards with a big expansion of <italic>négociant</italic> property. Viticultural practices, including labor, cultivation, and agro‐chemistry, were modernized to meet the demands of a profitable and expanding champagne industry. The identity of champagne as a regional and therefore French product seemed more confused than ever. It was not yet clear that the problem could be solved only by creating a legal fiction.</p>
      <p>Establishing the identity of authentic champagne was a matter of establishing boundaries, the limits of the “true” Champagne region, which meant the exclusion of areas not in the Marne. This was an explosive issue in the neighboring Champagne departments of the Aube and the Aisne. By 1900 champagne was recognized in France and in some other countries as the designation for a unique regional product, not as a generic label for sparkling wine. Authenticity and quality were geographically determined. But commerce reared its ugly head, with fraud becoming widespread as <italic>négociants</italic> imported raw material (grapes and wine) into the Marne to satisfy an expanding market for bubbles. By 1910 foreign markets took over 20 million bottles and the domestic market 15 million bottles annually. With a population of 39 million, France was not getting high on champagne, though its per capita consumption of alcohol was perhaps the highest in the world. The new century had floated in on an ocean of wine, for French wine production had been excessively reestablished, especially in the Languedoc. The decade of surpluses, falling prices, and Midi <italic>vigneron</italic> violence began. Would Champagne also turn violent?</p>
      <p>Big firms like Chandon and Krug wanted champagne making restricted to the Marne but with the provision that the firms would retain the commercial liberty to buy grapes and wine from outside the department, and they wanted to keep their imports a professional secret. Marne <italic>vignerons</italic> were angrily opposed. Guy analyzes the whole debate over the importance of <italic>terroir</italic> within a more general discussion of an anthropomorphic concept of France imagined by the geographer Vidal de la Blache and of the boundary paradigm of the Peter Sahlins school, which integrates local identity into a national negotiation rather than treating it as a sort of <italic>Gleichschaltung</italic> à la Eugen Weber. This is clever and makes some sense. Whether it represents a change in the way we look at French history is open to discussion. At least her analysis has the conceptual virtue of getting the notion of <italic>terroir</italic> out of a pedological, viticultural, and enological dead end. France being a mongrel nation, the identity of the country still remains elusive. In this case competing actors identified themselves as French by invoking the French Revolution to support the claims of the Marne and the counterclaims of the Aube. (One can see why Fernand Braudel admitted to being tormented over the years by the word “identity.”) Dragged into the dispute, Paris equivocated but then favored the Marne’s claims, though not without a few flutes or coupes thrown to the rest of the Champagne.</p>
      <p>Following a bad harvest in 1910 thousands of <italic>vignerons</italic> marched in Epernay against fraud and its source, the <italic>négociants.</italic> The organization representing the <italic>vignerons</italic> took a list of grievances to Paris, where even the Conseil d’Etat got involved. Guy sees the period 1910–14 as one of continued tension—“conflict and compromise”—rather than in terms of the conventional, mythic history of “harmony and consent” (157). <italic>Négociants</italic> and <italic>vignerons</italic> could not agree on the “true” Champagne or on a pukka champagne. Guy ends with the revolt of 1911, again an infection of “revolution and stalemate” (158). Information that a shipment of wine from the Midi was being delivered to the firm Perrier led to an attack on the firm, with the destruction of the shipment and the champagne stocks in the cellar and the smashing of equipment. Attempts to prosecute failed and unified the protesters. Other firms suspected of so‐called fraud were also attacked. Troops ordered in by Paris hesitantly clashed with rioters: the designation of this orgy of millions of francs worth of property damage as a revolution in Champagne was certainly an exaggeration. Was it class warfare, labor against capital? Guy believes that this interpretation is untenable because some of the protesters were property owners. The Marne <italic>vignerons</italic> were united on the need to exclude other departments in the Champagne from a clearly defined Champagne <italic>viticole,</italic> thus protecting the product of a unique <italic>terroir,</italic> an essential ingredient in the identity of the French nation. A patriotic monopoly. <italic>Négociants</italic> themselves were generally divided into two groups: the producers in Reims willing to halt buying outside and those in Epernay not willing to do so. Many of the firms in Epernay were small ones producing for the domestic market.</p>
      <p>In 1911 the Chamber of Deputies debated the issue and voted to limit the appellation “champagne” to the Marne. Trouble began in the ostracized Aube, a big supplier of grapes to Marne champagne producers. At one point nearly twenty thousand protesters massed in Troyes. Red flags and tax strikes in the Aube produced deadlock in Paris, which led to protests in the Marne against fellow Champenois in the Aube. Marne <italic>vignerons</italic> argued that their department was the new Champagne created by the French Revolution and other Champenois departments were merely the Champagne of the <italic>ancien régime.</italic> A redefinition of <italic>terroir</italic> would redefine Champenois and part of the French identity. This was clever, effective nonsense. Parisian power decided to move troops into Epernay and Reims to prevent another lower Languedoc type of peasant revolt, but in vain: the organized <italic>vignerons</italic> of the Marne, going on a rampage in their department, destroyed the cellars of merchants suspected of “fraud.” Troops were reluctant to face large crowds and unable to prevent an enormous amount of damage to the property of large landowners and <italic>négociants,</italic> who were targeted in a “black book” as enemies of the supposedly exploited <italic>vignerons.</italic> Paris soon moved to occupation with repression and prosecution. Forty‐six <italic>vignerons</italic> were convicted of crimes, but we know little about this denouement of the drama because the judicial records that were not destroyed in wars are still sealed.</p>
      <p>As the champagne houses acquired more and more land at cheap prices, more and more <italic>vignerons</italic> turned to wage labor and were guaranteed work for their loyalty to the firms. Guy argues that there was therefore a social break after 1911, with subsequent labor movements concentrating on wages and working conditions rather than on the product and its <italic>terroir.</italic> The “war on fraud” (184) withered away. Guy mentions that the history of champagne in the twentieth century remains to be written. (We would be fortunate if she wrote it.) She does mention the establishment of the INAO (Institut national des appellations d’origine) and the AOC (appellations d’origine contrôlées) rules trying to uphold the connection of geography and product. This is now a sick system, and some exporters even use the competing system of identifying wines on the labels by variety of vine. As for the vaunted <italic>terroir</italic>‐product connection, blind tastings and such developments as the success of pinot noir in Oregon (including a domain of the Burgundian firm Drouhin) and Louis Latour’s best‐selling chardonnay from the Ardèche, for example, show the weak basis of the French construct. Most people would argue, like Robert Parker, that French champagne tastes best. In case this argument fails, French firms are taking no chances and are producing good sparkling wine (not “champagne”) in California and Oregon.</p>
