Achados Arqueologicos num Sambaqui do Baixo Ama- zonas. PETER PAUL HILBERT. Instituto de Antro- pologia e Etnologia do Para, Pub. 10, Belem, 1959. 22 pp., 17 figs., 2 maps. The archaeological sequences along the Amazon river are gradually being delineated, principally by Peter Paul Hilbert, who has devoted his efforts over the past decade to this task under the auspices of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi and the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia. The paper under review describes a shell midden on the north side of the Amazon, a few kilometers west of the modern town of Alenquer. Located in a swamp, the site is inundated during the rainy season. The refuse accumulation is composed of rocks and shells. Stone and pottery artifacts and 175 potsherds collected from the surface by Frei Protasio Frikel between the years 1939-41 form the basis of the type descriptions. Pottery artifacts include 26 tubular pipes, the majority with incised dec- oration. The pottery was classified on the basis of temper into three types. The majority (85%) is tempered with sili- ceous sponge spicules, known as cauixi; 5% is tempered with shell, and the remainder of the sherds contains both materials intermixed. Decoration is by brushing, incis- ing or modeling. Motifs used in incised designs include zoned fine crosshatch, zoned parallel lines, unzoned parallel stepped lines, concentric squares, and squared spirals. Vessel shapes are simple bowls and jars with a direct rim. Lug adornos sometimes occur at the rim. Stone artifacts include squared axes with lateral notches, crudely shaped hammerstones, manos, and metates or mortars. The tubular pipes that comprise the most unusual artifacts show the same range and relative frequency of temper varieties as the vessel sherds. Maximum length is 17 cm. Some are plain but others are modeled to produce anthropomorphic forms and decorated with broad lines and fine zoned crosshatch. The only other tubular pipes from the lower Amazon are the much smaller and cruder ones from the later Mangueiras phase, the second pottery-making complex in the sequence on the Island of Maraj6. Hilbert suggests that the two principal kinds of temper represent two archaeological phases, the earlier having shell temper and the later cauixi temper. Most of the decorative styles and the pipes are equated with the later Jauari Phase. There is no clear-cut distinction, how- ever, since examples occur of both pipes and decorated sherds with shell or shell-and-cauixi temper. The major significance of this report is that it docu- ments the existence on the lower Amazon of a site show- ing strong affiliations with the Ananatuba phase, the earliest pottery-making culture on the Island of Maraj6. The zoned fine crosshatch decoration is identical to that characterizing Sipo Incised of the Ananatuba phase. Ves- sel shapes are also similar. Ananatuba phase pottery is tempered with crushed sherd, but cauixi is not native to Maraj6 so that this is not a significant difference. When the affiliations of the complexes on Maraj6 Island were traced, it was suggested that the Ananatuba phase was derived from somewhere up the Amazon. Hilbert's re- port is the first clear evidence in support of this inference. The detailed description and excellent illustrations make it a valuable contribution to our knowledge of Amazon prehistory. BETTY J. MEGGERS Smithsonian Institution Washington, D.C.

These monographs on preceramic sites in southwestern Hokkaido will interest archaeologists concerned with pre- Neolithic cultures in the Far East, and those who look for Asian prototypes or parallels for early assemblages found in northwestern North America. English summaries and captions on illustrations make both monographs useful to those who do not read Japanese. Excellent drawings and photographs of nearly all the implements, detailed tabular summaries of types, and carefully drawn site plans and profiles that record the provenience of artifacts attest to the high standards of workmanship that were followed from the planning of excavations to final publication. These monographs were prepared by teams of specialists from several museums and universities; they represent the combined -and not always compatible--views of a number of leading Jap- anese archaeologists on the very intricate problems of pre-Jomon cultures in Hokkaido. The Tarukishi excavations, carried out in 1954, were the first to demonstrate the presence in Hokkaido of a blade industry at a site for which reasonable antiquity could be claimed. The five authors report separately on their special interests. Shuta Takeuchi describes the preliminary survey, the organization of the team, and the manner in which records were kept, all of which indicate meticulous care in excavation. Masao Minato, in a dis- cussion of the geology of the site, supported by maps and profiles of the terraces, shows that the artifacts came 578 [ VOL. 26, No. 4, 1961</page><page sequence="2">cores. Localities II and III produced an unusual group of projectile points with stems ground on their lateral and basal edges. Yoshizaki, who cites Wormington in his bibliography, should be credited with probably the first recognition of basal grinding on points from Asia. The collection from Locality IV consists mainly of large blades and blade tools; Yoshizaki equates it with the Tarukishi assemblage. Chiefly on the basis of typological com- parisons of the four localities with a number of other sites in northern Japan, Yoshizaki concludes that they follow one another in the sequence I-IV. This ordering, which by extension makes the Taru- kishi material much later than the microblade in- dustries, involves, as he himself admits, some radical changes in Yoshizaki's views on chronology. He formerly equated the Tarukishi material with that from Shirataki Locality 13, which he still considers to be earlier than any of the microblade sites in Hokkaido, a position in which he is supported by Serizawa and Ikawa in a recent publication. We are at present unable to assess the typological reasoning which separates, presumably by thousands of years, the blade industries of Tarukishi and Tachikawa Locality IV from that of Shirataki Locality 13; there should be more discussion of this in the near future. A statement from Minato on the current status of the geological stratigraphy and correlations at Tarukishi is urgently needed, for as the record now stands he appears to be in disagreement with Segawa; moreover, a com- bination of his 1956 views with those of Yoshizaki would make the microblades of Tachikawa come from before the interstadial preceding Tottabetsu II, an incredibly early date. This problem and others like it in northern Japan will probably be settled finally only by radiocar- bon dates and further studies of archaeological and geo- logical stratigraphy. Whether these assemblages date from early or late in the Last Glaciation, their provenience in northern Japan marginal to the virtually inaccessible area from which Chard proposes to draw early Asian contributions to North American cultures should attract the attention of Americanists. Of significance here are the tongue- shaped cores, basally g,ound points, and special varieties of burins and possibly the blade industry. This mate- rial will also interest those who have noted the tendency of Russian workers to ascribe earlier dates to such sites as Mal'ta and Verkholenskaia Gora than previously. It is to be hoped that the producers of these very com- mendable monographs will make many more contribu- tions to the internationally significant corpus of archae- ological materials, and in addition turn their attention to more comparisons of their island assemblages and sequences with those of the mainland and of northern North America. WILLIAM N. IRVING AND HARUMI BEFU University of Wisconsin Madison, Wis. from a residual clay layer in the third terrace from the top in a series of six. The artifacts were below a loam bed; the top of the soil profile had been disturbed by plowing. Minato correlates gravels, which at places near the site overlie the residual clay, with moraines of the second stage of the Tottabetsu glaciation (Tottabetsu II). He very cautiously suggests that the interstadial which preceded Tottabetsu II, to which the artifacts are at- tributed, may correlate with either the Wiirm I-II or the Wiirm II-III interstadial. Hiromichi Kono, Toshio Oba, and Takeuchi combine forces in the description of the artifacts. Of the aggregate of 72 specimens, 17 are classed as blades or flake-blades, 11 are tools (primarily scrapers) made on blades or flake-blades, three are called flake tools and two are "fabricators," said to resemble "boat-shaped tools." In addition there is a large core and 38 flakes. The terminology is adapted by the Japanese from that used in England. Oba, in a separate chapter, delineates the marked differences between these materials and the stone industries which accompany Jomon pottery of early styles. Sosuke Sugihara discusses the characteristics of the site and the Tarukishi assemblage, and proposes a classification of the artifacts which differs in some respects from the preceding one. His estimate of the position of the assemblage in the Japanese sequence confirms the relatively early date ascribed by the other authors on the basis of local comparisons. Kono adds a useful summary of literature on the preceramic archaeology of Hokkaido. In general, this monograph is a model of cooperative endeavor by independent scientists. The main body of the report on the four "localities" of the Tachikawa site, not far from Tarukishi, is by Masa- kazu Yoshizaki. Masaji Ishikawa gives a history of the discovery of the site and the excavations, carried on in 1958 and 1959. Chosuke Serizawa, in a preface, describes succinctly the chronological problems of northern Japan and the relevance of the Tachikawa material to their solution. Shuryo Segawa's cautious study of the regional geomorphology is accompanied by maps of river terraces and diagrams of stream profiles. All of the Tachikawa localities are on the highest of a series of four dissected terraces of the Kombu River. The terrace complex is thought to correspond to that of the Tarukishi area. However, because all of the Tachikawa artifacts come from the upper part of a loam which appears to cor- relate with the top of the loam on the lowest terrace, Segawa concludes that the site can be assigned to the "uppermost Pleistocene or earliest Holocene." According to Yoshizaki's excavation profiles, the artifacts come from up to half a meter below an undisturbed, modern humus layer; no other natural stratigraphy was observed. The four Localities (I through IV) yielded totals of 111, 30, 73, and 31 artifacts, respectively. Locality I is distinguished by tongue-shaped ("boat-shaped") micro- blade cores and microblades; these do not occur at the other localities. In addition, there are large blades made into scrapers and burins, but no bifaces other than the REVIEWS 579</page></plain_text>
