<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROBLEM OF THE DIVINE PRESENCE: SOURCE-CRITICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF EXODUS XXXIII 12-23 by RACHEL M. BILLINGS Harvard University Introduction The text of Exod. xxxiii-xxxiv presents a mass of thorny problems that make it difficult to disentangle the text enough to understand its present state in a historical-critical way. For centuries, nonetheless, readers have managed to comprehend the text as a unity in its pre- sent, canonical state in both in the Jewish and Christian faith commu- nities. Theological techniques of exegesis were used to make spiritual sense out of a text that is difficult to read literarily. Part of the suc- cess of such a pre-critical theological reading lies in its ability to endow the peculiarities, difficulties, and outright inconsistencies of the text with motive and meaning. The very irregularities and non-sequiturs that make the task of the source critic so difficult are the apple of the theological reader's eye. For these are the points in the text that require explanation, that open gaping questions; it is in these spaces that the pre-critical reader delights. In the world of the historical critic, these points in the text are problems to be solved, breaks in logic that must be deductively analyzed and understood; they create distance between text and reader. In the world of the pre-critical reader, they are oppor- tunities. They provide a crack through which the reader may enter into the world of the text, room for his world to intersect with the text's world. That is because these "problems" are the points where the text cannot be explained in its immediate context alone. It requires the faithful and ingenious contributions of the reader to make it under- stood by his contemporary community of faith. Not history or logic, but the reader himself, working from the traditions of his faith com- munity and the resources of the canonical text as a whole, must pro- vide an exposition of the text and answer its questions.

BILLINGS the reader's contribution prevents the text's historical distance or obscu- rity from shutting the reader out. While this insistence that the text "make sense" in its present form may seem either naive or evasive from the historical critic's perspec- tive, it can offer surprising insights to the modem reader, since the pre-critical reader's very act of filling the gaps in the text frequently acknowledges that the gaps are indeed there. Such a reader can often see as well a modern reader where the text is unclear; the difference is that he presses on toward the goal of what the text means rather than dwelling on the gaps. In this pause of recognition that the text may seem contradictory or even incoherent on its own, the critical and pre-critical reader can sometimes meet. Despite their different con- cerns, then, the insights of both can aid in achieving a rich and multi- dimensional reading of the text in its present form. With this background, I will turn to the difficulties-or perhaps opportunities-of the text at hand, Exod. xxxiii 12-23, first examining its history of interpretation, noting the questions regarding its source division, and selecting the particular questions that I will address. Then, I will consider the ways in which pre-critical Jewish commentators' recognition and explanation of some of these same questions can illu- minate a critical reading of the text. Finally, I will bring these criti- cal and pre-critical insights to my own analysis of these questions and conclude with some suggestions as to how the present form of the text might better be understood. Problems in the text The first question regarding Exod. xxxiii-xxxiv is how to select a portion of the text on which to focus, since the text's very complex- ity makes it difficult to separate a part from the whole. In fact, the questions I will focus on arise even before these chapters. This is because the theme of the challenge to God's continued presence with Israel in Exod. xxxiii and the renewal of the covenant in ch. xxxiv both originate from the incident of the golden calf in ch. xxxii.' Moses has already appealed once for God to restrain his wrath toward Israel and not reject them in favor of founding a new nation from Moses I See B. S. Childs (Exodus: A Critical, Theological Commentary [Louisville, 1976], p. 586) and C. Houtman (Exodus [Leuven, 2000], Vol. III, p. 605) who consider chs. xxxii- xxxiv a unity in their current redaction. 428</page><page sequence="3">EXODUS XXXIII 12-I3 himself (xxxii 7-14). Further, the Lord has agreed to postpone their punishment because of Moses' intercession on their behalf, and has ordered him to continue the task of leading them into the land of Israel, guided by the Lord's angel (xxxii 30-34). Everything seems set- tled, but then at the beginning of ch. xxxiii, we find the Lord again ordering Moses to lead the people into the land, again accompanied by his declaration that he will send an angel, but this time with an explicit refusal to remain in their midst (w. 1-3). When the Israelites grieve at this, though, the Lord orders them to remove their jewelry while he makes up his mind about them (xxxiii 4-6).2 A brief story about the tent of meeting follows this, seemingly interrupting the Lord's decision-making process; we are told of Moses' intercession for the people outside the camp and of the people's worship (xxxiii 7-11). It is then in xxxiii 12 that Moses requests an answer from the Lord as to whom he will send to accompany the people on their journey. The section that begins here can be subdivided into several shorter units, but ultimately reaches its close in xxxiv 9 which reiterates the lan- guage and concerns of xxxiii 12. A series of difficulties occurs in the verses in-between, involving inconsistencies of theme and language, abrupt transitions from one subject to another, and numerous elements that seem out of their expected order. The particular problems that my analysis will focus on are as follows: 1. Moses' complaint in xxxiii 12 that the Lord has not told him whom the Lord will send to accompany him on the journey seems to con- tradict the Lord's previous declarations in xxxii 34 and xxxiii 2 that he will send an angel. 2. The Lord's response in xxxiii 19 that he will cause his goodness to pass before Moses does not seem to fit with Moses' request in xxxiii 18 to see his glory; similarly, v. 20 refers to seeing God's face rather than his glory. However, the section in xxxiii 21-23 returns to speak- ing of God's glory passing by. 3. Again xxxiv 1 seems to change the subject, yet a few verses later, in xxxiv 6-9, the theophany discussed in xxxiii 18-23 apparently takes place. 2 The precise sequence of this section is confusing, since several elements seem to be out of their logical order; however, the same could be said for much of ch. xxxiii. 429</page><page sequence="4">RACHEL M. BILLINGS History of interpretation of the passage This passage has long been both structurally problematic and deeply mined theologically. As B. Childs notes, this entire section does not lend itself to source division by means of the classical criteria. Few clues in the form of vocabulary typical of the major sources emerge from it.3 Childs provides a rough outline of the text's history of inter- pretation. Early critical commentators tried to make sense of it in terms of the classic four-source division, dividing it among J, E, and a J/E redactor.4 Other commentators, including M. Noth, observe the difficulties in the text, but find it impossible to attribute the pieces found to dis- tinct sources.5 More modern commentators have suggested a combi- nation of sources and stories in the text's formation.6 While no confidently agreed-upon source-critical analysis of the text exists, some very general divisions can be set out. Within the section of Exod. xxxiii 12-23, w. 12-17 and w. 18-23 are often considered separate units which have been expanded to reach their current form. A number of commentators further connect the unit of vv. 12-17 back to the start of ch. xxxiii, differing in their opinion of how many of these initial verses belong there.7 Another incongruity noted by sev- eral commentators is the three replies or parts of replies with which the Lord responds to Moses' request for a revelation of God's glory in v. 18.8 Most often xxxiv 1 is considered the start of a new section 3 Childs, Exodus, p. 584. 4 Examples of this approach include B. Bantsch and S. R. Driver (Childs, Exodus, p. 584). 5 A further discussion of Noth's analysis will be offered below, since he observes both important connections and seams in the text. Further, Noth does attribute the covenant-making in Exod. xxxiv to J, although with numerous exceptions to this in vv. 1-9 (M. Noth, Exodus [London, 1962], pp. 260-61). 6 W. Beyerlin is an example of this approach (Childs, Exodus, p. 584), and it seems to me to be perhaps the most viable one. 7 Childs, Exodus, p. 585. Childs himself disagrees with the idea of making xxxiii Iff. the beginning of the unit in w. 12-17, but on dubious grounds, since he still consid- ers w. 12-17 to presuppose aspects of w. 1-4. His main difference is in considering them separate episodes rather than in arguing that they are unconnected (Exodus, p. 593). Houtman offers a better solution in taking xxxiii 1-3 as the beginning of the dialogue in vv. 12ff., and considering the rest of the intervening material in xxxiii 4-11 to be an interruption, but with this entire section functioning as preparation for the renewal of the covenant (Exodus, p. 686). 8 Childs, Exodus, p. 595; Noth, Exodus, p. 257; also see Houtman, who proposes that w. 21-23 may be the original conclusion of v. 18, with w. 19-20 added as commen- tary (Exodus, p. 703). This suggestion is a fruitful one, as I will show later in my own analysis of the passage. 430</page><page sequence="5">EXODUS XXXIII I2-13 in some sense since it begins the renewal of the covenant with the making of a new set of stone tablets. How commentators divide the text as a result of this varies; both Noth and Childs deal with ch. xxxiii and xxxiv as separate wholes, perhaps for lack of an easier way to subdivide them. In discussing the boundaries of the text, my deci- sion to consider xxxiii 12-23 with reference back to xxxiii 1-3 and for- ward to xxxiv 1-9 is closest to that of Corelis Houtman, who examines xxxiii 1-xxxiv 9 as a unit. It is important to keep in mind, however, that all of this material forms part of the larger section of Exod. xxxii- xxxiv, spanning the time from the sin with the golden calf through the renewal of the covenant.9 Harmonizing solutions of various degrees have been offered as an accompaniment or alternative to a source-critical analysis of this pas- sage. Childs acknowledges the difficulties of the text's current form source-critically, but cannot find much more to securely say about its history. While not denying the complexities of its formation, he focuses his attention on the story the text tells in its current, canonical form. Cassuto makes a similar move, though he rejects the exegetical prob- lems of the text as the inventions of the too-logical minds of critical commentators. For him, the dialogue between the Lord and Moses makes fine sense if one properly understands the allusive, piecemeal style of eastern speech.'Â° To misunderstand it, in his opinion, means that one has forced it into western categories of thought incompatible with the text. This works fine for Cassuto, since his style of running commentary allows him to midrashically weave his interpretation and explanation of the text into the text itself. Indeed, everything makes much more sense with the glosses he provides-if only the logic of text alone flowed as easily as it does when accompanied by his com- ments! Unfortunately, the sense of the text seems to derive largely from his contribution, while the text itself provides only the background for his reading. Such analyses can help us read the text as it now stands, but Noth's analysis is more helpful in sorting out its difficulties. He avoids source attributions for the most part, but at least makes an attempt to ana- lyze how the parts of the text might fit together, even though his suggestions point out the problems more than resolve them. He implicitly 9 See n. 1. 10 See U. Cassuto, Commentay on the Book of Exodus (Jerusalem, 1967), p. 432. 431</page><page sequence="6">RACHEL M. BILLINGS connects w. 12b, 13, 16, and 17 by observing that their talk of Moses having found favor in God's sight does not refer to a particular inci- dent, but rather to Moses communication with God (and presumably his intercession for the people) in general.1 Recognizing the problem that Moses' words in v. 15 seem to presuppose that the Lord has not promised to accompany the people despite his declaration that he will do so in v. 14, Noth rejects the possibility of taking v. 14 as a ques- tion as some have done.'2 Instead, he proposes that v. 15 shows that the Lord's declaration in v. 14 did not satisfy Moses, because the Lord has only said "I will give you rest"-that is, Moses is the only object of the Lord's favor in this reply, but Moses is trying to secure his favor for the entire people.'3 Moses' request in v. 18 to see God's glory begins another, uncon- nected section which shows its own derivation from multiple sources by the three divine replies that it contains in w. 19-21.14 As for v. 18 itself, Noth sees its continuation mainly in w. 21-23.'5 Within this sec- tion, he takes v. 20 to be a later insertion elaborating on v. 23b.'6 Moving on to ch. xxxiv, Noth understands it to mainly contain the J account of the giving of the covenant on Sinai, though the first few verses, which are most relevant here, contain numerous redactional elements. He considers v. 2ba, v. 3, and v. 9 all to be secondary,'7 while vv. 6aba and 7 are not in their proper place and v. 6aa may not belong to J.'8 All in all, then, that leaves us with only xxxiv 1, 2a, 4-5, and 8 as firmly identified J material in Noth's view. This analysis of the text leaves many questions open, but offers a starting " Noth, Exodus, p. 256. However, Moses' quotation of this statement as God's words in xxxiii 13 raises the possibility that this refers to an event not preserved in our pre- sent text rather than to a general state of affairs. 12 Childs likewise rejects this option for contextual reasons (Exodus, p. 594). 13 Noth, Exodus, p. 257. 14 Noth, Exodus, p. 257. 15 Noth, Exodus, p. 257. 16 Noth, Exodus, p. 258. 7 He designates v. 2ba and v. 9 as secondary because of geographical issues involv- ing Sinai. While he reads the J story as depicting Moses as receiving God's commands in xxxiv 1 while still on the mountain and v. 2bb as having him ascend yet higher to the mountain's peak, v. 2ba has Moses descending the mountain. As for v. 9, it brings in the subject of departure from Sinai raised in the previous chapter, and thus is not an organic part of the giving of the covenant. Finally, v. 3 is inserted on the basis of the prohibitions regarding the mountain in Exodus xix (Noth, Exodus, pp. 260-61). 18 Noth, Exodus, p. 261. 432</page><page sequence="7">EXODUS XXXIII I2-I3 point for a critical discussion of the connections and disjunctions of the units in question. The contribution of pre-critical Jewish sources Both early and medieval Jewish commentators are not unaware of the problems of this passage. While their solutions are often ultimately theological, some of their resolutions of the text's problems continue to be echoed by critical commentators who recognize a division of the text into literary sources. With one exception, I will focus here on the comments of Rashi, who has a number of particularly helpful insights into this text. On the first point, however, I will consider the possible solutions offered by Rashi, Ramban, and Ibn Ezra (as quoted by Ramban), who see the same problem in Exod. xxxiii 12, mentioned above and commonly recognized by scholars.'9 Moses' objection that the Lord has not told him whom he will send with him contradicts the Lord's declaration in xxxii 34 and xxxiii 2 that he will send an angel. Rashi suggests that v. 12 is Moses' indirect complaint that an angel is insufficient; that is, only the presence of the Lord himself is adequate if Moses and the people are indeed favored. Houtman takes up this same position (with reference to Rashi!) because of how it fits into the preceding material, though he does not deal with its source- critical identity.20 Ramban disagrees with Rashi, and suggests that if Moses objected, he logically should have complained when the Lord first said he would send an angel rather than some time later.2' Thus, he takes v. 12 as a request to know what sort of angel will accompany the people. Interestingly, S. R. Driver takes up a solution similar to Ramban's and bases it specifically on a source-critical understanding of the text. He proposes that if this verse is originally part ofJ, Moses' question should be understood as asking which of God's many angels will accompany his people.22 19 See Rashi's and Ramban's commentaries on xxxiii 12. 20 That is, this explanation accounts for the Lord's declaration that he will send an angel, and posits the difference in v. 12 as based on Moses' dissatisfaction with-not ignorance of-that fact (Houtman, Exodus, pp. 697-98). 21 See Ramban on xxxiii 14. 22 S. R. Driver, The Book of Exodus (Rev. ed.; Cambridge, 1918), p. 360. 433</page><page sequence="8">RACHEL M. BILLINGS Furthermore, Ramban quotes yet another possibility suggested by Ibn Ezra, which is taken up by Childs.23 They argue that Moses is dissatisfied with God's response in v. 14 because it focuses only on Moses (taking the second-person singular object suffix to indicate this). Moses, on the other hand, wants to ensure God's presence with the whole people. These three solutions in their modern critical manifestation thus adopt interpretations already found in Jewish commentators in trying to argue for the logic of connecting this text with xxxiii 1-3. They raise the possibility of reading vv. 12-17 as a continuation of the pre- ceding dialogue between the Lord and Moses in xxxiii 1-3 despite an apparent contradiction. Such a solution is not purely harmonizing and has more in favor of it from a source-critical perspective than one might expect. A genuine problem arises in attempting to read these stories as originally separate because of strong verbal links that sug- gest an intentional connection, whether this unity derives from a com- mon source or from redaction. I will discuss this possibility further in my own analysis of the text below. Rashi may be seen to understand a certain aspect of the theophany in a way that is congruent with a modern critical analysis as well. In interpreting the Lord's response to Moses in v. 19, he takes it as a limitation on the amount of God's glory that Moses will be permitted to see. That is, God's goodness is the particular aspect of his glory that he will show to Moses. This finds echoes in Houtman's suggestion that v. 19 (as well as v. 20) supplies secondary commentary on the theo- phany of God's glory requested by Moses in v. 18 originally answered in vv. 21-23.24 Together they point to the same insight that v. 19 is a further definition of how it is that Moses will experience God's glory in the requested theophany. As I will demonstrate below, this recog- nition aids in understanding the internal structure of vv. 18-23 as well as their connection to the covenant renewal that follows. Perhaps the most remarkable connection that Rashi sees is what a modern critical commentator would consider the essential editorial framework of the passage, constructed by a combination of arrange- ment and redaction of the materials involved. While he does not employ such critical terminology, Rashi notes two key connections between 23 Childs, Exodus, pp. 594-95. 24 Houtman, Exodus, p. 703. 434</page><page sequence="9">EXODUS XXXIII 12-13 Exod. xxxiii 3 and xxxiii 16 that draw these spliced elements together in xxxiv 9 in order to close the theme of Moses' intercession to main- tain God's presence with his people.25 Specifically, he recognizes that in xxxiv 9, the danger of the Lord's dwelling in the midst of his peo- ple as mentioned in xxxiii 3 is averted by the Lord's merciful nature as revealed in the theophany. Furthermore, he observes the connec- tion of this verse with the theme of Israel's particularity in xxxiii 16, which can only be demonstrated by God's presence among his peo- ple. Thus, he ties together what the canonical text presents as the different stages of Moses' intercession for the people and links them to their culmination in xxxiv 9, even while unaware that in doing so, he has traced the skillful work of the redactor in tying these strands together by means of xxxiv 9. This insight, too, will prove to be impor- tant in showing how the different sources discovered in the course of my analysis are held together. Source-critical analysis With these problems and insights in mind, I now move to my own examination of the literary divisions of the text. The breaks in the sense and sequence of the passage offer some of the best footholds the source critic can find for the task of descending into its source history. At the same time, pinpointing the places where the text does make sense, where the connections of vocabulary or logic seem to hold it together, can aid in excavating its sources as well. In looking at the text in question, I will break down the material in xxxiii 12-23 into two smaller units, blocks apparently intended to be coherent in their current context, which can then be examined in more detail. The first logical unit consists of Exod. xxxiii 12-17, since v. 17 seems to provide the closure required by the note of inquiry raised in v. 12.26 Next, v. 18-23 comprise the second unit, since v. 18 raises the subject of a theophany and v. 23 concludes the description of the Lord's response, including his statement of what will take place and the conditions under which it will occur. Obviously, the conclusion of both units does not come until xxxiv 9, so I will refer to the mate- 25 See Rashi on xxxiv 9. 26 The Masoretic Text divides the text between v. 16 and v. 17, but most modern commentators consider v. 17 to make the most sense as part of the preceding section (e.g., Houtman, Exodus, p. 700; Childs, Exodus, p. 595). 435</page><page sequence="10">RACHEL M. BILLINGS rial in xxxiv 1-9 to assist in understanding the two units in question. Also, I will look back to xxxiii 1-3 for clues as to how the apparent contradiction between xxxiii 2 and xxxiii 12 might be resolved. Inter- estingly, both of these units begin with a request raised by Moses (v. 12 and v. 18) and end with the Lord's response (v. 17 and w. 19-23), a roughly parallel structure which makes them easy to separate. But this relatively simple initial division only begins the much more diffi- cult task of analyzing their contents and original functions. Exod. xxxiii 12-17: Moses' request on the basis of the Lord'sfavor The problems and clues that this text presents suggest two major possibilities as to its origin. As noted previously, the major difficulty is that the section beginning in v. 12 does not seem to know of the guid- ing angel promised in xxxii 24 and xxxiii 2. The medievalJewish com- mentators' creative interpretations of Moses' question in xxxiii 12 may initially seem harmonizing, but they offer a critically valid solution to the disjunction between the texts. While it may initially seem most scholarly to declare that this passage derives from a separate source and thus simply contradicts what precedes at the beginning of ch. xxxiii, the proposed connection cannot be dismissed so easily. Four strong verbal connections forge a link with xxxiii 1-3: the root 'lh in reference to departure from Sinai (w. 1, 12, 15), the idea of the Lord "sending" a representative with the people (w. 2, 12), the reference to "this [place]" by the demonstrative pronoun alone (w. 1, 15), and the paralleling of "you and the people" (v. 1) in the Lord's speech with "I and your people" in Moses' speech (v. 16). Thus, w. 12-17 may indeed be the continuation of w. 1-3, showing Moses' implicit dissatisfaction with the Lord's provision of an angel. On the other hand, the text of vv. 12-17 does not necessarily seem to be internally coherent. It is at least possible to separate out w. 12-13 and 17 on the basis of internal structure as a coherent unit in which Moses makes a request for himself in light of God's favor for him. While v. 13's phrase "see, indeed this nation is your people" places this request in the realm of Moses' advocacy for the people, the request is based on Moses' merit before God, not the people's, and centers on Moses' sta- tus and relationship with God. If w. 12-13 and 17, then, were orig- inally a distinct unit, the connections between v. 16 and xxxiii 1-3 might be a secondary expansion meant to tie this tradition about Moses into the problem at hand. 436</page><page sequence="11">EXODUS XXXIII I2-13 First, let us consider in more detail the possibility of reading the text as a unit with xxxiii 1-3. Returning to xxxii 34 and xxxiii 2, it is worthwhile to take a closer look at the language; an angel is to be sent before the people. This will take care of the people's direction, but perhaps Moses wants to know something more. He has been on inti- mate terms with God as demonstrated particularly by his previous intercession in xxxii 32; thus the declaration in xxxiii 12. As the first- person singular suffix in xxxiii 12 may show, Moses' question does not primarily concern how the people will find their way to the Promised Land. That is, he asks not whom the Lord will send before or with us, but "with me." In the past, Moses has been known to the Lord by name and has found favor in his sight (v. 12). To enable the contin- uation of this favor with and closeness to the Lord, Moses asks to know the Lord's ways (v. 13).27 One possibility, then, is that what Moses requests here is the Lord's continued intimacy with him despite the Lord's expressed inability to dwell among the people. The Lord grants this in v. 14 by conceding that his presence will indeed go with Moses. However, Moses has only reached his proximate goal; his expressed concern in v. 15-once again indirectly phrased-is that the Lord "bring us up," not accompany Moses alone. In short, Moses does not want the Lord to remain at Sinai while his angel leads the peo- ple on.28 Thus, the logic of v. 15 is made evident: Moses would rather that he and the people stay at the holy mountain than travel on to a great inheritance without their God. Only with God's continued pres- ence can they continue to distinctively be his people (w. 15-16) and know that they-not just Moses-have God's favor (v. 16). Thus, the Lord's full granting of Moses' further request, that he be present both with Moses and the people, is contained in his reply that "even this thing that you have said, I will do" (v. 17). While this unitary read- ing accounts well for the verbal links to the preceding material, how- ever, the question remains as to whether this view truly satisfactorily accounts for the text's coherence with the Lord's previous declarations that he will send an angel. A second possibility is to take this section as deriving from a tra- ditional unit about Moses' privileged position before God, with redac- 27 This word is vocalized as plural in the Masoretic Text even though it is written as a singular form. 28 See Driver, Exodus, pp. 361-62, for a similar view on v. 15. 437</page><page sequence="12">RACHEL M. BILLINGS tion tying it into the current context. The text contains many repeated verbal roots that give it tight internal coherence at certain points, yet do not link back to the preceding material in xxxiii 1-3, suggesting that it may be a separate unit. In xxxiii 12-13 and 16-17, yd' occurs six times and m.' occurs five times, the latter always in the phrase "to find favor in the eyes of.. ." In xxxiii 12-13, Moses makes two requests that the Lord make something known to him on the grounds that the Lord knows him by name and favors him (v. 12); the purpose of this is that he may know that he continues to find favor in the Lord's sight (v. 13). Moses' request begins and ends by calling the Lord's attention to something by the root r'h, first focusing on Moses' leadership of the people and second on the identity of the people as the Lord's people. However, w. 14-15 seem to interrupt this structure to some extent; they do not precisely respond to Moses' request, nor does their vocab- ulary link them to vv. 12-13. Rather, it seems that the more likely conclusion to this unit was originally the Lord's response in v. 17. There he agrees to grant "this thing that Moses has said"-namely, to make known to Moses his ways so that Moses may know that he continues to find favor with the Lord-on the basis that Moses has found favor in his sight and that he knows Moses by name (v. 17). A chiastic pattern of the repeated verbal roots structures this request and response.29 Each occurrence ofyd' is paired with an occurrence of ms', except for the first-which is Moses' initial plea that the Lord (xxxiii 12) make known whom he will send with Moses, thus highlighting this concern. This plea alone, then, need not be bound to this particular point in the exodus story, since it could function equally well at other points where Moses' mediation of God's presence is in question. How, then, do vv. 14-16 fit into this explanation of w. 12-13, 17 as a traditional unit perhaps originally unconnected with the crisis of the broken covenant? They shift the focus of Moses' request from its original concern for a revelation of God's ways to Moses to enable him to continue in his role as mediator for the people to a request for God's continued presence not only with Moses (v. 14), but with his people as well (v. 15). The attempt to splice this into a request that originally centered on Moses provides the rationale for Moses' awkward response in v. 15, which makes the crucial shift from God's 29 Houtman recognizes this pattern as well (Exodus, p. 683). 438</page><page sequence="13">EXODUS XXXIII 12-I3 continuing presence with Moses alone, requested in vv. 12-13, to an expansion of the plea to include God's presence with the whole peo- ple in w. 15-16. Thus, the medieval Jewish commentators' interpre- tations may enter once more to explain Moses' dissatisfaction with the divine response. If it is indeed the case that these verses are expansions of an orig- inal unit consisting of vv. 12-13, 17, then the vocabulary that seems to link w. 15-16 back to xxxiii 1-3 (see above) may be an intentional, redactional integration of this unit into the current context. The func- tion of this redaction, then, would be to make Moses' request for him- self as mediator and its fulfillment only an intermediate goal (w. 12-14), ultimately aiming to draw Israel back into the Lord's favor alongside Moses (w. 15-16). The Lord's response in v. 17 would pro- vide the confirmation of this second stage of the request, then, and would form the closing bracket of the framework provided by the orig- inal unit. With this analysis of the text, however, the looming prob- lem of the angel still remains. Why intentionally insert and expand a traditional unit that seems to contradict what precedes? Does this really offer a better solution than regarding the contradiction as part of the original structure? I present these two possibilities as suggestions regarding how the text might fit together; arguments could certainly be made in favor of each, other possibilities could certainly be introduced as well. In my view, the text in vv. 12-17 seems best analyzed as a traditional story emphasizing Moses' favored status with God, worked into the current context by a redactor who interwove with it Moses' intercessory plea for God's ongoing presence with Israel following the episode of the golden calf. This seems more probable than regarding the apparent contradiction as stemming from a single source. Since the original unit in vv. 12-13, 17 focused strongly on Moses' privileged status before God and the redaction is concerned with God's dwelling among his people, this episode might very tentatively be considered part of a northern source favoring Moses, with perhaps a P redaction fitting it into its current context. However, the absence of the divine name Elohim from the text paired with the presence of the Tetragrammaton in xxxiii 17 make this derivation difficult to argue for securely. Perhaps it is best in this case to recognize the general theological concerns and original contours of these two layers of the text without pressing their identification or details. 439</page><page sequence="14">RACHEL M. BILLINGS Exod. xxxiii 18-23: Moses' request for a theophany Following the successful fulfillment of Moses' requests in w. 12-17, v. 18 presents yet another. This, too, involves the issue of God's presence, but essentially in the form of a demand for a theophany. A very small verbal connection links this loosely to the previous unit. In the previous passage, Moses has been requesting that the Lord "see" (w. 12, 13) to the task of providing for his people, but now Moses asks the Lord to "cause me to see" (v. 18) the Lord's glory. As Noth has observed, the beginnings of three replies to this request are con- tained in w. 19-21. Three different expressions for the divine mani- festation occur in these verses as well: God's "glory" (w. 18, 22), God's "goodness" (v. 19), and God's "face/presence" (w. 20, 23b)-an expres- sion that has already been used in w. 14-15. However, the reader should be careful not to assume from the start that this difference in terminology makes these different expressions mutually exclusive. In fact, it is possible that an existing mixture of wording enabled the blending of different theophanies in this passage. Still, the precise rela- tionship among these is difficult to determine in the text as it stands, since the strands are interwoven. Were these terms originally inter- changeably used, or have they been juxtaposed by a redactor? That is, how many theophanies have been joined to create this passage? To discover their relationship, one must begin by figuring out whether any verses can be sorted out as logically coherent with each other apart from the rest. Perhaps the easiest strand to distinguish consists of v. 18, containing Moses' request to see God's glory, and w. 21-23a, in which the Lord responds with a description of how he will fulfill this request. At first, it seems that v. 23b, with its highly anthropo- morphic concept of God's "face" and "back," may be separate from this unit which initially speaks of a theophany of God's glory. However, it accounts for several elements in the preceding verses which otherwise do not receive proper closure. First, we know from v. 22 that the Lord's "palm" will cover Moses only until the Lord passes by; without v. 23b, the idea of the Lord moving his "palm" aside in v. 23a is incomplete since we do not know what is revealed. Second, the idea of God's "back" and "face" are no more anthropomorphizing than the image of God's "palm" which is clearly organically a part of these verses. Finally, the verbal root r'h in v. 23b fulfills Moses' request in v. 18 of having a visual experience of the Lord. Thus, it seems best to follow Houtman in considering w. 21-23 the natural continuation of v. 18. 440</page><page sequence="15">EXODUS XXXIII 12- I3 In this case, I think that vv. 19-20 may best be understood as exegetical "commentary" on the theological content of the theophany. They answer the questions, "What does it mean to see God's glory? What exactly is Moses asking for?" They provide two answers, both of them de-anthropomorphizing. The first answer is that to see God's glory is to hear the declaration of his name, his name by which he is on intimate terms with Moses and Israel, and to see his "goodness," his attributes of divine freedom that permit him to be merciful (v. 19). This follows Rashi's understanding of this verse as a limitation on the meaning of "God's glory" in the preceding verse. In the context, this is particularly relevant in light of the concern for God's continuing presence with Israel despite Israel's sin; the Lord's mercy is precisely what Moses would want him to reveal of himself. The second answer is that to see God's glory does not mean to see his face; no one can see God's "face" and live (v. 20). These two exegetical insertions set the boundaries on what it can mean for Moses to see God's glory without telling us precisely what Moses sees. Although this unit defines and sets out the conditions for the theo- phany, no theophany actually takes place until the first several verses of ch. xxxiv. Which theophany is this? While we might expect the theophany begun in v. 18 and continued in vv. 21-23 to be concluded here, the characteristics of this theophany actually seem to best cohere with v. 19. The same language of the Lord passing before Moses (xxxiv 6) and declaring his name and attributes (xxxiv 7) is found in that verse. It seems possible, then, that the theophany in xxxiv 6-8, while now positioned as the fulfillment of vv. 18, 21-23, was originally a separate theophany connected with J's giving of the covenant. Childs seems to point in the right direction by suggesting that the theophany in vv. 18, 21-23 should be understood as originally more of a personal revelation to Moses than a prelude to the covenant-making.30 Thus, I am inclined to see vv. 5-8 not as its original conclusion, but to see this personal theophany in vv. 18, 21-23 as linked into the present context by v. 19, which defines the theophany by means of certain elements that connect it verbally and thematically into the covenant- renewal (i.e., God's graciousness and mercy) and thus the theme of the Lord's ongoing presence with his people. This conclusion is rein- forced by the fact that xxxiv 5-7 seems to make sense in connection with the covenant apart from the preceding material. 30 Childs, Exodus, p. 596. 441</page><page sequence="16">RACHEL M. BILLINGS Because of its strong anthropomorphism, the theophany in w. 18, 21-23 should most likely be attributed toJ, E, or another early tradent. With regard to the defining additions, v. 20 could have been inserted on a theological basis by any later redactor who had qualms about reference to God's "back," "palm," and "face." On the other hand, v. 19 vitally links this theophany into its new context, and thus again should likely be attributed to P's structuring of the material. Why bother to link these two theophanies? The theophany in w. 18-23 has two important functions in this context. Like w. 12-17, it seem to preserve a tradition about the favored status of Moses, such that he can request a personal revelation of God; by placing it here and adding v. 19, the redactor links Moses' role as favored intercessor in the preceding verses to the appearance of God to renew the broken covenant in ch. xxxiv. This theme concludes in xxxiv 9, where Moses' intercession again acts as a linking element that recalls the issues and themes of xxxiii 1-3 and 12-17, along the lines of what Rashi observed, and connects it to the theophany itself, in effect conveying that the goal of this whole section has been Moses' mediatorial efforts to con- vince God to return from his distance and dwell in the midst of his people. This happens step by step over the course of these two chap- ters. First, he concedes to be with Moses (v. 14), then agrees to accom- pany the whole people (v. 17). Next, he agrees to appear to Moses personally in a theophany which takes place in xxxiv 6-8, and at that point responds to Moses' plea for him to remain in the midst of his people (xxxiv 9). The Lord's response ultimately is found in his renewal of the covenant, beginning in xxxiv 10; only this finally resolves the crisis of xxxiii 3 where the Lord insists that he will not "go up in the midst of you." Now he, by his own graciousness and mercy, makes this indwelling possible. Conclusions In my analysis, then, the proposed source-critical division of the two units in Exod. xxxiii 12-23 is as follows: Unit 1 w. 12-13, 17: Moses' request for the Lord to make known his ways and whom he will send with Moses; the Lord's willingness to grant that request. Source: Traditional fragment recounting Moses' favor by the Lord; perhaps E or a general northern tradition favoring Moses. 442</page><page sequence="17">EXODUS XXXIII 2- I3 vv. 14-16: Expansions bracketed within Moses' request that link it to the issue of God's personal accompaniment as opposed to that of an angel, as expressed in both xxxii 24 and xxxiii 1-3. Source: Redactional activity linking broken covenant to covenant renewal; perhaps P, due to its structuring function and its con- cern for God's presence among his people. Unit 2 vv. 18, 21-23: Moses' request to see God's glory, and the Lord's description of how he will fulfill that request. Source: Traditional fragment recounting personal theophany to Moses; perhaps J or E because of its strong anthropomorphism. v. 19: Exegetical expansion of this theophany to explain what is meant by God's glory as it relates to the situation of the broken covenant. Source: Redactional activity; perhaps P, based on covenant theo- phany in xxxiv 6-8 v. 20: Exegetical expansion to curb the anthropomorphism of w. 22-23. Source: Redactional activity for theological purposes; uncertain origin In their current context, these levels of source and redaction blend to form a new meaning beyond what the source stories alone pos- sessed. Moses' plea on the basis of the Lord's favor, recounted in w. 12-13, 17, seems to originally have been a personal request. Placed in this new context, however, the story reflects Moses' role as media- tor between God and the people. Expansions in vv. 14-16 relate his request to the problem of God's refusal to travel among his people in xxxii 34 and xxxiii 1-3. Thus, Moses' appeal on the basis of the Lord's favor for him grounds not only the granting of a favor for himself, but a plea for God to demonstrate his favor to both Moses and the people. The Lord's reply in v. 17, then, becomes a crucial stage in Moses' intercession following the golden calf incident. Similarly, the theophany of vv. 18, 21-23 which seems to begin as Moses' request for a personal revelation becomes something quite different when placed in a new context and supplemented with w. 19-20. Once more, it demonstrates Moses' close relationship with God by his ability to ask for a revelation of God's glory. In light of v. 19, however, the theophany has further significance; what God will reveal of his glory will be his freely distributed mercy and compassion-pre- 443</page><page sequence="18">RACHEL M. BILLINGS cisely what Israel needs if he is to dwell among them without destroy- ing them. Further defining the limits of the theophany, v. 20 reminds that no one can actually see God himself, so that the theophany simul- taneously becomes deanthropomorphized and focused on the Lord's attributes rather than his appearance.31 God's gracious granting of this request to Moses then leads into his descent not only to be close to Moses in a moment of theophany, but to renew his covenant and thus enable his continued presence among his people. While this analysis has by no means resolved the difficulties of these two units of the text of Exod. xxxiii 12-23, it has offered some sug- gestions as to how a source-critical division of these texts might be made. These texts will no doubt remain a point of exegetical and source-critical struggles for as many centuries as they have already. However, they will also no doubt remain a rich theological resource in all their diversity as they have been for even more numerous centuries. Abstract Employing insights from both pre-critical Jewish commentators and critical scholars, this article offers some suggestions for the source-critical analysis of Exod. xxxiii 12-23. After briefly reviewing the history of moder source-critical analysis of the passage and considering the insights of several medieval Jewish commentators, it analyzes the text in two units, w. 12-17 and w. 18-23. Taking a clue from these pre-moder readers, it seeks to perform the modern critical task of distinguishing the text's sources by look- ing for the points at which the text fits together and for the meaning created by this splicing of sources rather than focusing primarily on the text's internal inconsistencies per se. In conclusion, it is suggested that in each of these units, the blending of sources has transformed a personal request of Moses into Moses' intercession for Israel to enable the Lord's ongoing presence in the midst of his people. 31 See Childs for various understanding of this shift (Exodus, p. 596). 444</page></plain_text>
