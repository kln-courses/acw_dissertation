On might become an island: the contrary, his friend and colleague Friedrich von Esch scholtz pointed out in his chapter, "On the Coral Islands," The reef, or the first origin of these isles, is formed by the "Their situation with respect to each other, as they often animalcules inhabiting the lithophytes.

A hammer in the hand of an idiot may break in pieces the Apollo Belvidere, or the Venus de Medici, which are scarcely less worshipped as miracles of art in our day, than they were by idolaters of old as the representatives of deities. (Ellis 50) "Looking abroad over the whole world after the lapse of nearly six thousand years," Montgomery concluded, "what have we of the past but the words in which its history is re corded? What besides a few mouldering a brittle ruins which time in insensibly touching down to dust?" (Ellis, 51). So much for the edifices of antiquity, and the humanist—and Enlightenment—pride in neoclassicism. It was a Biblical per spective in the hands of Montgomery the missionary; it was a secular one in the hands of Péron the anthropologist; it was an imaginative perspective the vision of either. "Thus, while man," Péron wrote "—who proclaims himself king of the natu ral world—laboriously constructs on the earth's surface those frail buildings which the effect of time must soon bring down, feeble little worms (whose existence he was but lately ignorant of and still disdains) create in the depth of the ocean more and more of these prodigious monuments, whose strength defies the ages and is such that even the im agination declines to conceive of. . ."(3: 47). It was James Hutton who said "time is not made to flow in vain; nor does there ever appear the exertion superfluous to power, or the manifestation of design, not calculated in wisdom to effect some general end" (qtd in Toulmin and Goodfield 156). Hutton's is, if one may say so, a sort of Whiggish interpretation of geo-history, one that the 19th cen tury began to replace with a sometimes scarcely renovated version something far older: a cyclical vision of contending forces, neither achieving final victory over the other, and without any possibility of a "general end." "Whatever destroy ing tendencies, then, exist on earth," William Knight wrote (in a discussion of the "formation of new land by coral worms"), "these renovating powers compensate for them. . .. No marks of a degradation acting through a prolonged series of ages are exposed to our observation, without being met by constant renewal. The one arises out of the other." And "one great and good Being" was the orchestrator of this irreduci ble algorithm (258; my italics). For Agassiz, too, "destruction and construction go hand in hand, and the materials broken or worn away from one part of the Reef help to build it up elsewhere" (176). Such a pattern was one of those "intellec tual links in Creation, which give such coherence and consis tency to the whole, and make it intelligible to man" (192.) This was a theodicy Darwin himself (at least in his early days) was prepared to walk towards, in his infinitely methodical but also visionary way These coral islands stand, and are victorious: for here another power, as antagonist to the former, takes part in the contest. The organic forces separate the atoms of carbonate of lime one by one from the foaming breakers, and unite them into a symmetrical structure. Let the hurricane tear up its thousand huge fragments; yet what will this tell against the accumulated labour of myriads of architects at work night and day, month after month? Thus do we see the soft and gelatinous body of a polypus, through the agency of vital laws, conquering the great mechanical power of the waves of an ocean, which neither the art of man, nor the inanimate works of nature could successfully resist. (Voyage 338) James Montgomery could not see atoms of calcium carbon ate being woven and unwoven by coral polyps and the action of the waves. But he could see the Pacific in a flooded York shire valley, and he could balance and contrast forces of de struction and construction in an eerily similar way. NOTES 'Montgomery had written a generous and astute review of Wordsworth's poem in the Eclectic Review, in January, 1815, regretting Wordsworth's loss of faith—particularly in natural theology. 2I have greatly depended on Stoddart's scholarship for the his tory of coral observation and on Rudwick's for the intellectual context. ''"Victorian natural history books were written with the aim ," Lynn Barber writes (72; my italics), "of encouraging their readers to see evidence of God's existence and attributes in the natural orga nisms around them, by means of natural theology." Milton Mil lhauser concurs (69): "Throughout the greater part of the nineteenth century geology was to be regarded primarily in the light of its religious significance." 4In 1831 Montgomery would edit the Journal of Voyages and Travels by the Rev. Daniel Tyerman and George Bennet, Esq., Deputed from the Ixmdon Missionary Society to Visit their Various Stations in the South Seas, China, India, &amp;c. Between the Years 1821 and 1829 (John Snow), in which (1: 153) the missionaries explained to their Tahitian audi ence how the coral reef the Polynesians assumed to be a rib of one of their gods was in fact "formed by multitudes on multitudes of the feeblest things that have life, through ages working together, and in succession, one mighty onward purpose of the eternal God; while each poor worm, among the millions which perhaps an angel could not count, is merely performing the common functions of its brief existence, and adding, perhaps, but a grain to a mass of materials which, in process of time, may fill up the bed of the Pacific Ocean, and convert it into a habitable continent." 5Baudin and Flinders had a famous encounter in the waters off Spencer Gulf in April 1802, and Péron had also seen "coundess le gions of pelicans" on Kangaroo Island some months before (2: 57). 47</page><page sequence="10">*'T he imaginative sequence or pattern Flinders sketches here —islets, in a lagoon, on an uninhabited island, next to an unknown coast, at the antipodes of Europe—is endemic to the Western literary imagination of Australasia: thus the hero of Marcus Clarke's Austra lian classic, For the Term of his Natural Life (1874) is at one stage in the narrative left in chains on Grummet Rock, off Sarah Island, off Tas mania, off Australia . . . and so on and so forth, ad infinitum. 'Montgomery was eager not to leave an impression of censori ousness: "I would sooner lose a finger from my hand," he told Hol land (4: 219), "than unduly blacken even the character of a cannibal: but alas! the depths of depravity into which the natives of New Hol land are sunk, scarcely admit of being aggravated by description." Montgomery was the son of Moravian missionaries who had died in the West Indies during his childhood. 8Another source for Montgomery's vision, Eleanor Porden's scientific fantasia, The Veils: Or the Triumph of Constancy (John Murray, 1815), Book Four of which ("The Sea") reproduces as footnotes (170-71) two extracts from contemporary lectures by Peter Mark Roget, to the effect that "coral islands are formed with a rapidity which is astonishing, whether we consider the great depth from which they arise, or the extreme minuteness of the animals which produce them," and "many of the larger tribes of fishes feed on the smaller kinds, and are exceedingly voracious," and so forth. For ref erence, John Williams (University of Greenwich). 9Montgomery imaginatively anticipated the work of Charles Darwin and recuperated the work of his Charles' grandfather, Eras mus, in The Temple of Nature (164-5): "The marble mountain, and the sparry steep,/Were built by myriad nations of the deep,—/Age after age, who form'd their spiral shells,/Their sea-fan gardens and their coral cells", and so forth, such that mountains, islands, and conti nents "Are mighty Monuments of past Delight."
