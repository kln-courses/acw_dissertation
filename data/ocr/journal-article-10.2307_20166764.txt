In several parts of the hemisphere, especially in the Andean and Mesoamerican regions of "high civilization," this consciousness of the material past took the form of antiquarianism: the veneration and reuse of ancient cities, collection of ancient objects, and creation of archaizing copies. The purpose behind these revivals varied, as did knowledge of the original cultures. To understand such revivals, one must attempt to understand historical thought in the New World. The bulk of ideas about "the past" (a continuum of myth and history) was transmitted orally. Even in cultures that practiced some form of historical recording (in manuscripts or on stone monuments), the amount and nature of information were limited, and records were usually destroyed periodically as history was "rewritten." History was conceived as cyclical rather than linear. It was the result of a dialectic between the past and the present, in which events were seen as repeating types. Current happenings were interpreted to fit patterns established by the past, and the past was reconceived to accommodate present circumstances.1 This form of historical thought has two important implications for the study of antiquarianism. In the first place, revived objects, like past events, were used to validate and provide precedents for the present. Second, the end result of such constantly evolving histories was not true history in the modern Western sense. As events moved into the more distant past they gradually lost their historical specificity. For this reason, the inheritors of such traditions would have had as much trouble matching them to ancient remains as the modern scholar. In other words, if later people were not the direct and immediate descendants of a previous culture, they had little specific knowledge of it, even though they may have inherited many traits indirectly. In most cases then, the material remains provided the only direct link with earlier cultures, and antiquities thus played an important part in the formation of the historical consciousness of New World people (see Tom Cummins, dissertation in progress). Antiques and archaizing objects brought the past and the present together. Later people reused ancient monuments in contemporary ceremonies and created new objects that combined within one image elements from both time frames. Although there are several important studies of archaizing in Andean civilization,2 no one has directly addressed the phenomenon of antiquarianism in the cultures of Mesoamerica (fig. 1).3 Evidences of later activity at ancient sites are usually of secondary interest to archaeologists and are appended to reports focusing on the earlier inhabitants.4 Even a cursory survey of the literature on Mesoamerica, however, reveals a number of reused sites and antiques and possible revival styles. The most common examples of antiques deposited in later contexts are carvings of jade (and other green colored stones). Jade carving began with the Olmecs, the first great artists of Mesoamerica, perhaps as early as 1000 b.c., in the Middle Preclassic Period.5 Olmec jades were highly prized by later people, as attested by 1. For an explanation of some of these aspects in Aztec history, see Umberger 1981, passim. Like other Mesoamericans, the Aztecs were very concerned with time and had a calendar of repeating dates (i.e., the date 1 Rabbit recurred as a day every 260 days and as a year every 52 years). Thus in their histories, cyclically recurring types of events tended to happen (that is, were made to happen or were interpreted as happening) on dates of the same name. The events could be either of the same type literally or seen as related metaphorically. 2. See, for instance, Menzel (1960), Lyon (1966), Rowe (1971), Berger (1976), and Cummins (dissertation in progress). There is also a vast literature on revivals of past styles in Western civilization; for a comprehensive survey and bibliography specifically on classicism, see Greenhalgh (1978). For another study of attitudes toward antique remains in Res, see Nercessian (1983). For studies of archaizing in a different non-Western area, see articles in Murck (1976) on Chinese art. 3. I am aware of only one article that treats Mesoamerican antiquarianism as a phenomenon with important consequences for an understanding of the archaeological record (Proskouriakoff 1968, and comments by M. Coe and others following the paper). The only monograph on the subject is Coe's (1966) study of an Olmec jade with Maya glyphs. 4. This is not to say that there is not good information on later occupants in several reports. Although not their primary focus, Coe and Diehl (1980, 1: 213 ff., and elsewhere) give detailed treatment to the Early Postclassic reoccupation of the Olmec sites of San Lorenzo, Potrero Nuevo, and Tenochtitlan (in Veracruz); and Acosta in various articles (see bibliography) gives a great deal of information on Aztec presence at Tula. 5. Mesoamerican prehistory is traditionally divided into three main periods: the Preclassic, Classic, and Postclassic periods. The following are the generally accepted subdivisions and durations of these periods: Early Preclassic, 1500-1200 b.c.; Middle Preclassic,</page><page sequence="3">64 RES 13 SPRING 87 Figure 1. Map of Mexico with inset of the Aztec area in Central Mexico. Stippling indicates the extent of the Aztec Empire. (The maximum expanse of ancient Mesoamerica extended farther to the north and south of the area covered by the map.) those found in an Early Classic offering at Cerro de las Mesas in Veracruz (Drucker 1955). During the same period Maya artists carved glyphs on Olmec jades; and the inscription on one, commemorating the accession of a lord, indicates an evocation of the past for political purposes.6 Olmec jades are also depicted in Classic Period murals. At Teotihuacan they fall in streams of water from the hands of fertility deities (A. Miller 1973: 154-155, pis. 324, 326). In Late Classic battle scenes at Cacaxtla in Central Mexico and at Bonampak in the Maya lowlands, defeated warriors may be wearing Olmec pendants. Here Olmec jades seem to identify one group with the past in a negative sense (M. Miller 1986: 101-102). In the Early Postclassic after the fall of Classic Maya civilization, antique Maya jades were deposited along with Olmec jades in the sacred well at Chichen Itza.7 Perhaps by this time they, too, had become important signifiers of the past. Beginning in the Late Classic, there is evidence in various parts of Mesoamerica of reoccupation and reverence for ancient sites. At Laguna de los Cerros in Veracruz and at Sin Cabezas on the Guatemala coast, monumental figurai sculptures of Preclassic date were resurrected. In Veracruz the sculptures are Olmec, and at Sin Cabezas they are pedestal figures in the local Olmec-related style. Those at Laguna de los Cerros (or similar sculptures) subsequently may have stimulated Maya artists at Tonina to create the few sculptures in-the-round made in Classic Maya times (see Proskouriakoff 1968: 126-128). Again in Veracruz during the Early Postclassic San Lorenzo and two nearby sites had major reoccupations one thousand years after their abandonment by the Olmecs. The new people took advantage of the original layout, and as a 1200-300 b.c.; Late Preclassic, 300 b.c.-A.D. 300; Early Classic, A.D. 300-600; Late Classic, A.D. 600-900; Early Postclassic, a.D. 900 1200; Late Postclassic, a.D. 1200-1521. 6.

Offerings were deposited, Olmec artifacts were resurrected, and sculptures may have been moved and reused (Coe and Diehl 1980: 1, 35, 213ff., and elsewhere; Coe 1981: 136-139). In Central Mexico the Toltecs probably made pilgrimages to the deserted ceremonial center of the sacred city of Teotihuacan, the mythical birthplace of the sun, in much the same way as described later in Aztec times. At another ancient site, Chalcatzingo in Morelos, a shrine, consisting of a broad stairway, altars, and platforms, was built below an Olmec rock carving (Grove 1984: 167) at the end of the Early Postclassic. After the fall of Tula around the same date, the inhabitants of Central Mexico continued to imitate the Toltecs' distinctive sculptural forms. From the foregoing it is evident that a regard for the cities and art of the past was an important aspect of Mesoamerican culture. In this paper, I will concentrate on antiquarianism among the Mexica Aztecs of Tenochtitlan, the creators of the last great culture to dominate Mesoamerica before the Spanish Conquest.8 It has been generally acknowledged that the Mexica copied the art forms of their immediate predecessors, the Toltecs,9 collected some antiquities (Batres 1900), and created a few pieces imitating the older styles of Teotihuacan (Umberger 1981: 80-81) and Xochicalco.10 That these activities were much more extensive than previously thought has only become apparent with the excavation of their Great Temple, the Templo Mayor. With the new finds, it is now appropriate to examine Mexica antiquarianism in detail. Fortunately, in the case of the Mexica, whose civilization flourished between 1428 and 1521, a wealth of information was recorded during the century after the Conquest. Thus we can ascertain something of their attitudes toward past cultures, analyze relationships between ancient and contemporary objects, and hypothesize possible reasons behind their collection, reworking, and revival of these styles.11 The Mexica Aztecs The focus here is on the Mexica Aztecs12 of Tenochtitlan, a city whose remains are now under Mexico City. The Mexica were one of several seminomadic groups who arrived in Central Mexico at the time of (or soon after) the waning of Tula, the capital of the Toltecs, who dominated the area prior to 1200. The Mexica founded Tenochtitlan and its twin city, Tlatelolco, on adjacent islands in Lake Tetzcoco, in the first half of the fourteenth century. In the late fourteenth century the people of Tenochtitlan acquired as ruler (tlatoani, speaker) Acamapichtli, the son of a Mexica noble and a princess of Culhuacan, a city on the south lake shore whose rulers were said to be the descendants of the royal line of Tula.13 Thus the Mexica 8. At this point antiquarianism seems much more prevalent in Mexica culture than in earlier Mesoamerican groups. And as Menzel (1960: 597) notes of the situation in Peru, "antiques clearly [prove? of greater attraction in some periods than in others. Imitations, in particular, seem to be confined to certain periods." But, in the case of the Mexica, to what extent is this the result of recent and fortuitous discoveries and a lack of information on earlier cultures? Perhaps more extensive evidences of antiquarianism, especially archaizing styles, will become apparent as chronologies are refined and archaeologists and scholars focus on later reuse of sites and objects. 9. See, for instance, Beyer 1955; Moedano K?er 1947; and Nicholson 1971: 118-119. 10. Nicholson 1971: 120, 122; Umberger 1981: 94-95, 219. 11. Although the information on antiquarianism is scattered, the cumulative effect of focusing more on this phenomenon would benefit Mesoamerican studies. Archaisms are direct and tangible connections between cultures ? and their investigation makes obvious the fallacy of assuming that visual similarity indicates closeness in time (Menzel 1960) and sameness of culture and meaning. In the end such studies should lead to stricter definitions of the styles of different cultures. The investigation of archaizing is also enlightening because it reveals the part played by conscious choice in a culture's acquisition of artistic elements, as opposed to a view that stresses passive reception of "influences" (see Winter 1977; Von Staden 1976). What a later group is looking for and at, what they understand, what they modify, and what they misunderstand are all revealing. An awareness of the extent of antiquarianism in Mesoamerica would also help explain generalized and less easily defined influences from much earlier cultures. In the end the study of archaisms should, in fact, contribute new insights into the problem of continuity and disjunction between cultures in Mesoamerica by focusing on the conscious receivers rather than the unconscious donors. For discussions of continuity and disjunction, see Kubier 1967, 1973, 1977; Willey 1973; Nicholson 1976; Townsend 1979: 13-15, 71; Berlo 1983: 1-8. 12. The term Aztec, which became popular in the nineteenth century, is useful as a general designation for the related Nahuatl speaking groups who inhabited Central Mexico in the Late Postclassic Period (a.D. 1200-1521), although they did not refer to themselves as such (Nicholson 1971: 116, n. 13). The people of Tenochtitlan and their neighbors in Tlatelolco called themselves Mexica. Thus I am using Aztec to refer generally to the cultures of the Late Postclassic and their art and Mexica to refer specifically to Tenochtitlan and objects found there (Tlatelolco is referred to only twice). I am calling objects in the distinctive late fifteenth- to early sixteenth-century style that centered in Tenochtitlan (sometimes referred to as the Metropolitan Aztec style) either Late Mexica or Late Aztec, depending on provenience. 13. It is generally thought that the Toltec line went to Culhuacan</page><page sequence="5">66 RES 13 SPRING 87 established a connection with the legendary Toltecs, and it is assumed that they absorbed or inherited survivals of Toltec culture from Culhuacan and other communities. Between 1428 and 1431 the Mexica defeated their overlords, the Tepanecs of Azcapotzalco, won their independence, and formed an alliance with two other cities, Tetzcoco and Tlacopan. By the 1480s this Triple Alliance dominated a major part of Mesoamerica, and Tenochtitlan was the imperial capital of a large tribute empire. The city was divided into quarters ? corresponding to the four quadrants of the world ? by four streets that met at the sacred walled precinct (fig. 2). At the center was the Templo Mayor (excavated between 1978 and 1982),14 surrounded by other temples and platforms. The Templo Mayor was a double pyramid-temple dedicated to Tlaloc, the ancient Central Mexican rain god, and Huitzilopochtli, the Mexica tribal numen, who, as the politically dominant deity in Mexico, was associated with the sun. The right side of the temple, Huitzilopochtli's shrine, was conceived as representing Coatepec, the Serpent Mountain, the site of his birth in myth. It is apparent from the visual evidence that the Mexica were absorbing a number of foreign styles during the second half of the fifteenth century, the period of formation of their own great style (and simultaneously the formation of the empire). The artistic situation in Tenochtitlan was very complicated at this time. According to the written sources, the Mexica collected artworks frorq ancient sites and deity images from the temples of conquered towns, and they also brought artists from neighboring towns to work in Tenochtitlan. As in other parts of the world, both ancient and contemporary styles were probably imitated for the purpose of identification, authority, and prestige. However, there is also an aspect of conquest and humiliation involved in the Mexica's collection of foreign objects and use of foreign artists. The deity images were actually "captured" and kept in a "prison temple," the Coacalco or Coateocalli (Sahag?n 1950 1982: bk. 2, 2d revised ed., 182), and artists were made to carve monuments that commemorated their own defeat. This aspect of humiliation generally does not apply to the ancient objects (see Nicholson 1971 : 119, n. 17), except perhaps in the case of antiques from conquered territories outside the Aztec heartland. The Mexica probably venerated all ancient sites in general. The focus here will be on the three important cities that seem to have had special and distinctive associations for them: Tula, Teotihuacan, and Xochicalco. Approximately sixty kilometers to the northwest of Tenochtitlan was Tula (florescence, a.D. 900-1200), identified as the legendary Tollan in the written sources, the city of the Toltecs and their ruler Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl (Our Lord, Feathered Serpent). As indicated above, the Mexica claimed partial descent and their right to rule from the Toltec line. The older city of Teotihuacan (a.D. 1-750), whose very impressive remains are thirty kilometers to the northeast, was associated with a more distant, cosmic event, the birth of the fifth and final sun in mythic times. Finally, Xochicalco, a city sixty kilometers to the southwest with a florescence postdating the decline of Teotihuacan (a.D. 650-900), seems to have been associated with the invention of the calendar, which the Mexica and other Aztecs inherited. All three cities then were considered the sites of important beginnings, places of origin for the Aztecs. While their ideas on Tula are best known, those on Teotihuacan are more shadowy, and their attitudes toward Xochicalco are least understood. The Aztecs probably referred to the inhabitants of these cities generally as Toltecs.15 The collection of antiquities According to the literary sources the Mexica and other Central Mexicans made ceremonial pilgrimages to ancient sites (instances are given for both Tula and Teotihuacan), were familiar with the surface remains, and dug for buried objects. They were especially interested in finding objects made of jade and greenstone (chalchihuite, which (as seen above) were highly valued in Mesoamerica and buried in offerings and graves as early as Olmec times. Proskouriakoff (1974: 15) has noted that one passage in Sahag?n's Florentine Codex indicates that the Aztecs looked for changes in surface plant growth and other signs as indications of where to dig for ancient objects. after the fall of Tula. Davies (1977: 300-301) further suggests that Culhuacan existed in Toltec times. 14. For information on the Templo Mayor excavations, see Matos 1981; L?pez Portillo, Le?n-Portilla, and Matos 1981a; for recent studies of the offering caches at the site, see Nagao 1985a and b. 15. Other ancient cities for which there may be evidence of Aztec awareness include Teotenango in the State of Mexico and El Tajin in northern Veracruz. In the relaci?n geogr?fica of the colonial (and Aztec-period) town of Tenango, the area occupied by the ruins of Teotenango is surrounded by a conventional Aztec-style drawing of a wall (the ancient wall that is still there). The text says, "In ancient times there was a town on the hill" (Paso y Troncoso 1905-1906, 7: 1 and map facing 1). Melgarejo Vivanco (1970: 15) suggests that Mictlan (Place of the Dead) in the Aztec tribute province of Tuxpan (in Codex Mendoza) might have been El Tajin.</page><page sequence="6">Umberger: Antiques, revivals, and references to the past in Aztec art 67 Wherever they can see that something like a little smoke [column] stands, that one of them is giving off vapor, this one is the precious stone. . . . Then they dig. There they see, there they find the precious stone, perhaps already well formed, perhaps already burnished. Perhaps they see something buried there either in stone, or in a stone bowl, or in a stone chest; perhaps it is filled with precious stones. This they claim there. And thus do they know that this precious stone is there: [the herbs] always grow fresh; they grow green. They say this is the breath of the green stone, and its breath is very fresh; it is an announcer of its qualities. In this manner is seen, is taken the green stone. Sahag?n 1950-1982: bk. 11,221-222 In Aztec thought, jade and greenstone were associated with water and fertility because of their color. They were also thought to attract moisture (perhaps for this reason the Aztecs looked for a column of mist and greener plants). In addition, a small piece of greenstone was placed in a cavity in the chest of many Aztec sculptures to represent the heart.16 A greenstone was put in the mouth of the dead for the same purpose and buried with the remains. For this reason, and because of their discovery in caches and burials at ancient sites and cemeteries, such stones were probably associated with the ancestors in Aztec thought.17 Archaeological remains in Mexico City indicate that Mexica collecting was not confined to urban areas and the cities mentioned above. Antiquities discovered in Mexico City (see, for instance, fig. 3), mostly in offering caches at the Templo Mayor and in other areas, include Teotihuacan masks and figurines (most of greenstone) and ceramic vessels, a Toltec ceramic vase, a Maya jade, jades or greenstones from Oaxaca, a Preclassic bib-and-helmet jade, and even an Olmec greenstone mask that was over two thousand years old in Mexica times. Archaeologists have also discovered more than a thousand objects from Guerrero (mostly greenstone masks and figures) as well as Mixtee greenstone objects from Oaxaca and a Huastec shell carving from northeast Mesoamerica. Because of problems with the dating of Guerrero, Mixtee, and Huastec objects, it is not known how old these pieces were in Mexica times and what the Mexica's attitude toward them was. In the case of the Guerrero objects, at least, some are ?AW ^b?F VbV ^^ ^* ??? Ebb*. mmB ^ ^^ ^"* ?^^ " &lt;B?V^ Figure 3. Antiquities discovered by Leopoldo Batres behind the Cathedral on Escalerillas Street, October 16, 1900: (2) is a greenstone plaque from Oaxaca; (3) is a gray stone Teotihuacan figure; (6) is a classic Maya jade head; (7) is a greenstone plaque with a figure in Xochicalco style (Mexica copy); (8) is a bib-and-helmet head (probably jade or greenstone), culture unknown, Late Preclassic Period. Batres 1902: 24. definitely old, and even if numbers of them were of recent manufacture, they constituted the type of objects that were meant for burial. They therefore probably had the same significance as objects actually excavated from graves: they were associated with the predecessors of the present inhabitants (see Nagao 1985a: 96, n. 73). Another category of interest is that of antiquities collected and modified by the Mexica. A group of approximately fifty greenstone masks and figurines from Guerrero found in Offering Chamber II at the Templo Mayor (Phase IVb)18 is especially interesting because of the addition of painted hieroglyphs and other motifs by the Mexica (Ahuja 1982). Two other antiques that were probably modified by Aztecs are a Teotihuacan greenstone figure with a late Postclassic inscription (see fig. 23) and an Olmec mask that may have been 16. The stones are usually missing, but some were found in sculptures recently excavated at the Templo Mayor (Hern?ndez Pons 1982: fig. 13). 17. See Nagao 1985a: 50-52; and Thouvenet 1982, for further associations of greenstone. 18. The Mexica periodically rebuilt the temple, constructing a larger pyramid directly over the older one. Archaeologists found seven main phases wherein the entire temple was rebuilt; there were other additions to just the west-facing side. For discussions of the dating of the phases, based on hieroglyphic date plaques, see Matos 1981a; L?pez Portillo, Le?n-Portilla, and Matos 1981; Nicholson, in press; and Umberger, in press a. The following is my estimate (based on Matos 1981a) of when the various phases were visible (date of construction to date of covering by later phase): Phase I, unexplored; Phase II, early rulers, 1390??1431 ; Phase III, Itzcoatl, 1431 (probably finished)-1454; Phase IV, Motecuhzoma I, 1454 (probably finished)-unknown date before 1481; Phase IVb, Motecuhzoma I, 1464-unknown date between 1469 and 1481; Phase V, Axayacatl, unknown date between 1469 and 1481 (Axayacatl's reign)-1483; Phase VI, Tizoc/Ahuitzotl, 1483</page><page sequence="7">68 RES 13 SPRING 87 recarved by an Aztec artist (Easby and Scott 1970: no. 307). Both are of unknown provenience. A number of questions arise in relation to these collected antiquities. How did the Mexica acquire them? Did they excavate them, or demand them as tribute? What were the ideas behind their burial, reworking, or reuse? Were they recognized as antiques or were some objects considered more as tribute from conquered people? To what extent were the Mexica sensitive to distinctions between styles and connect them with particular sites or cultures, or are we seeing in their burial just a generalized evocation of the past? Matos (1978: 15) notes that 80 percent of the objects found at the Templo Mayor are non-Mexica, and all of these are from tributary areas.19 Were such objects included in regular tribute from various parts of the empire? Tribute lists mention (or picture) only unworked greenstone or strings of beads, although it is possible that this category referred generically to all greenstone objects, worked and unworked. Nicholson (quoted in Nagao 1985a: 52) suggests that antiquities may also have been the result of looting after warfare. Another possibility is that foreign leaders were required to bring them to Tenochtitlan as offerings on important occasions. One incident is described during the rebuilding of the Templo Mayor in the reign of Motecuhzoma I (Nagao 1985a: 33): Seeing the speed with which his temple was being built, King Motecuhzoma ordered all the lords of the land ... to collect from all cities a great number of precious stones, green stones . . . which they call chalchihuitls?[and other types of precious stones], and each braza [1.67 M.] that the building grew, these precious stones were to be thrown into the fill. . . . Duran 1967, 2: 228; see also Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975: 357 Phases IV and IVb were built by Motecuhzoma I, and, indeed, many greenstone objects were found in offering chambers on those levels. It is difficult to answer questions about the significance of the burial of the unmodified antiquities, in particular, because most were found in offering caches, and there seems to be no purposeful pattern behind their deposit (Nagao 1985a: 52). Antiques of different cultures appear to be mixed indiscriminately with certain types of Mexica objects. Perhaps they were meant to be references to the past and ancestors in general (rather than to specific societies), or perhaps many (those of greenstone) were buried also because of the connection of greenstone with water. Could the accumulation of greenstone objects at the temple also represent the "heart" of the empire, as greenstone does in the chest of a sculpture? Or could the burial of objects extracted from burials and offerings in different parts of the empire relate to the Mexica's efforts to make their city an imago mundi, a miniature ?mage of the empire? There was a temple for conquered gods and a zoo and gardens for animals and plants from different parts of the empire. In addition, even the human and animal sacrifices at the Templo Mayor were from all areas. Perhaps, then, the idea was to rebury sacred offerings from all parts in the center. Unfortunately, present evidence can take us no further toward the solution of these questions. It is probable that a number of these ideas were operating at the same time. Although most collected antiques were unmodified, a few were reworked or reused in ways that relate to their origins: the Teotihuacan figure was recarved with the date of a mythical event associated with Teotihuacan; and glyphs on some of the modified Guerrero objects may name their places of origin, which would also make them seem to be items collected after conquest or as tribute. Others in this group have hieroglyphic dates that may provide clues to the circumstances of their burial. Archaizing artworks In the case of archaizing copies of artworks, architecture, and motifs from past cultures, a distinction should be made between revivals and survivals of ancient forms (see Greenhalgh 1978: 20-24).20 A revival is the result of the direct observation of an original object, and constitutes a conscious and (begun)/1487 (finished)-ca. 1500; Phase VII, Motecuhzoma II, begun soon after flood of 1499/1500-destroyed 1521. Presumably the objects found within a phase were deposited during the time it was visible. This schema of dates applies only to objects found in the - recent excavations of the Templo Mayor and nearby platforms and pavements. Objects found outside this context must be dated on the basis of other criteria, that is, style and hieroglyphic dates. 19. Although in styles originating in areas outside the Aztec empire, the Olmec mask and Maya jade found in Tenochtitlan may have come from within the empire. The Olmec mask is made of a stone from the Puebla-Oaxaca-Guerrero area south of the Valley of Mexico (Matos 1979) and could have been found in any part of Central Mexico, especially Guerrero. Maya jades have also been found in Central Mexico and in Oaxaca. 20. Greenhalgh writes specifically of classical revivals in Western art, and although his general discussion is useful for the consideration of non-Western art, his final definition is too narrow. "Only when the</page><page sequence="8">Umberger: Antiques, revivals, and references to the past in Aztec art 69 purposeful reference to the past. A survival, on the other hand, is the result of a chain of replications of a form with or without knowledge of its original source. It is often difficult to draw a line between the two categories, and to find the links in the chain between early and late types. A specific problem for this study is that in some cases we cannot determine whether a sculpture is an antique, an early Mexica copy, or a non-Mexica Aztec copy, because of our ignorance of the parameters of all styles involved. This is due in part to the confusion of the archaeological record at the ancient sites by the activities of later people and in part to lack of studies. We are familiar with the distinctive late Aztec style that was centered in Tenochtitlan (see, for example, figs. 11, 15), but many non-Mexica Aztec or early Mexica objects are in rough or less distinctive carving styles and are recognizable mostly because of their imagery rather than surface qualities. This is especially a problem in the case of early copies of Toltec types in which recognizable Aztec imagery is lacking (see, for example, fig. 10). Nevertheless, a number of Mexica imitations can be distinguished, and they appear to be limited to objects and motifs in the styles of the three cities that are the focus of this study. It should also be noted in the case of these consciously archaizing imitations that the Mexica were aware of the culture of origin and that they chose to refer to a particular style or site because it was relevant to the occasion for which the object was created. In other words, these references to ancient styles were not generalized or haphazard evocations of the past. Although it is difficult to date Mexica sculptures and link them with events in history (see Umberger 1981), a few enlightening examples have hieroglyphic dates or original context to give clues to the circumstances of their creation. Even though the Mexican purposes were related to the site in question, however, they did not necessarily fully understand the forms they were imitating. Despite their legends and traditions about the cultures of the past and their inheritance of many forms and ideas, when they were faced with the material remains, they had to evolve their own interpretations. The degree of understanding varied according to each culture and object. For this reason and because of the demands of the event commemorated, one cannot assume that the original and the copy had the same meaning. Toltecs and Chichimecs21 In the written sources, the Toltecs, the previous inhabitants of Central Mexico, are described as great artists. The word for artist, in fact, is toltecatl, literally, "a person from Tollan," and art is toltecayotl, "the Toltec thing." There [was] no real word for their name. Their name is taken from ? it comes from ? their manner of life, their works. The Tolteca were wise. Their works were all good, all perfect, all wonderful, all marvelous; . . . Sahag?n 1950-1982: bk. 10, 165-166 It is apparent in the literature that the term Toltec was often meant to refer specifically to the inhabitants of Tula (Tollan) Xicocotitlan. At other times, however, it is used more broadly, to describe the inhabitants of Teotihuacan and other ancient cities,22 just as Tollan is appended to the names of several cities?for instance, Tollan Chollolan (modern Cholula).23 And these, the traces of the Tolteca, their pyramids, their mounds, etc., not only appear there at the places called Tula [and] Xicocotitlan, but practically everywhere they rest covered; for their potsherds, their ollas, their pestles, their figurines, their armbands appear everywhere. Their traces are everywhere, because the Tolteca were dispersed all over. Sahag?n 1950-1982: bk. 10, 167 As Davies notes, "both Tollan and Toltec are concepts as much as proper names" (1984: 210; see also 1977: ch. 2). It seems probable that the Aztecs used the term Toltec in the broader sense to designate all their urban predecessors in Central Mexico, in contrast to the Chichimecs, nonurban inhabitants, or barbarians.24 Both categories were broadly applied to a number of different groups, and their general connotations were of civilized and settled versus nomadic, uncultured, and barbarian (which was not necessarily negative). The Mexica and their neighbors all claimed a dual Toltec-Chichimec heritage. Their histories begin with the migration of their Chichimec ancestors into Central Mexico before the foundation of ideals of Roman civilization join a selective interest in Roman style are we entitled to call the product a revival" (p. 24). In this passage he is actually defining a renaissance rather than a revival. 21.

Alva Ixtlilxochitl's (1975-1977, 1: 272) list of Toltec cities includes Tula, Teotihuacan, Toluca, Cuauhnahuac, Cholula, and others. 23. According to Heyden (1983), Tollan, literally meaning "place of reeds and rushes," may signify the watery and fertile environment, which was thought appropriate for the site of a great city. 24.

The contrast between Toltecs and Chichimecs and their descendants is shown through distinctions in costume both on Mexica sculptures, such as the Stone of Tizoc (fig. 4), and in pictorial manuscripts (which although Colonial period in date, reflect preconquest ideas). Toltec warrior costumes and paraphernalia, visible on such sculptures as the colossal Atlantean figures at Tula (fig. 5), include the "butterfly" pectoral (this could also be on the front of the headdress), a headdress of upright feathers and a long feather panache, a bird on the front of the headdress, a triangular apron over the loincloth, a disc on the back, and an atl-atl. Nonwarrior attributes consist of woven dyed cotton cloaks, a ceremonial jacket (xicolli), the blue pointed crown of a lord (xiuhuitzolli), and woven reed thrones (icpalli). In contrast, Chichimec costumes and paraphernalia consist of headgear featuring a headband and a variety of small feather decorations, bows and arrows, animal skins, maguey fiber cloaks (which seem to represent a stage between skins and dyed cotton cloaks), and bundles of reeds for seats. The purpose behind the contrast between Chichimec and Toltec clothing varies according to context. A Figure 4. Tezcatlipoca dressed in Toltec warrior outfit and conquering the deity of another town, dressed in non-Toltec, or Chichimec, garb, Stone of Tizoc, Mexica, 1481-1486, MNA. contrast between warriors can indicate a distinction between civilized conquerors and uncivilized conquered groups, as on the Stone of Tizoc, where the representatives of the Mexica are dressed in Toltec warrior costumes and their enemies are dressed in Chichimec costumes.25 Or a contrast in civilian clothing can indicate a change through time from an uncivilized to a civilized state, for instance in Sahag?n's Primeros Memoriales (Paso y Troncoso 1905-1907: 6, ill. 18 and others), where the costumes of the kings of various towns change from Chichimec to Toltec after the defeat of the Tepanecs in 1428. The Mexica did not always identify the Toltec past as superior to the Chichimec past. On the Temple of Sacred Warfare, Motecuhzoma II is dressed as a Chichimec in contrast to the dead figures below who wear Toltec costume parts (Umberger 1984: 72-73, and figs. 2, 3). Thus the Mexica sometimes invoked one heritage, sometimes the other, depending on the circumstances. The Toltecs, however, were the symbols of the art producing past. The Toltecs of Tula26 In Aztec sources, Tollan was the legendary city of Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl, a great culture hero, ruler, and religious leader, whose reign ended in disgrace and 25. At first I thought that the Toltec warrior costume worn by the figures on the Stone of Tizoc was an archaizing outfit, not what actual Mexica warriors wore. It is only represented on stone sculptures and not in manuscript representations of warriors, and from descriptions it seems not to have been worn in actual warfare. Aztec warriors wore body-length fitted costumes. The ruler wore an outfit representing the flayed skin of Xipe Totee. However, Wray (1945) has pointed to a similar contrast at the Toltec-Maya city of Chichen Itza (on the Yucatan Peninsula) between warriors in sculpture who wear the typical costume described above and those who wear simpler costumes in mural paintings depicting an actual battle. Wray suggests that the costume worn in stone reliefs is reserved for scenes of a ceremonial or formal nature (thanks to my student Pamela Jones Pailet for pointing out this contrast in Toltec art). Klein (in press) has recently analyzed Mexica bench reliefs (to be discussed later), where figures wear some of these Toltec costume parts. She decided that these are the costumes that were worn by kings and warriors for the procession into Tenochtitlan after battle and for the subsequent bloodletting ceremony. If this Toltec costume was used just for ceremonials, it is interesting that it is depicted in conquest scenes even though it was not worn in warfare. See also Anawalt (1985) on other aspects of Toltec clothing and Pierce (1981) on a similar contrast between warriors in an unusual sixteenth-century church mural at Ixmiquilpan. 26. The following discussion of Mexica contact with Toltec art is limited mostly to objects in Central Mexico, since I am assuming their knowledge was based on local remains. In some cases, however, related examples at Chichen Itza may indicate the broader range of examples that were once visible at Tula.</page><page sequence="10">Umberger: Antiques, revivals, and references to the past in Aztec art 71 flight. Quetzalcoatl was the prototypical priest and the first to institute bloodletting. The Aztecs also probably inherited their warrior societies and other institutions from the Toltecs. In addition, there is a connection between Tula and Huitzilopochtli. The Mexica during their migration stayed for a while near the city at Coatepec, where they dammed a river and established a settlement. It was here that Huitzilopochtli was born, or rather reborn as the sun, according to modern interpreters. Tula (fig. 6), identified as the legendary Tollan by Jim?nez Moreno (1941), is located in the state of Hidalgo.27 Tula Grande, the area of the main Toltec occupation of the site, features a plaza with an adoratorio (small platform) in the center and a number of structures around the periphery: a west-facing pyramid-temple (Pyramid C), probably the main pyramid of the site; a smaller pyramid-temple on the Figure 5.

Tula was reoccupied after the collapse of Toltec power. It was a significant town at the time of the Spanish Conquest (Diehl 1983: 166-169), and there were intermarriages between its ruling line and that of Tenochtitlan (Davies 1980: 8). Aztec-period remains at Tula include a palace on the hill of El Cielito, which was still occupied in Colonial times; buried caches and scattered ceramics, of both early (Aztec II) and late 27. For archaeology at Tula, see Acosta (1940, 1941, 1945, 1954, 1956, 1956-1957, 1957, 1960, 1961, 1964) and Diehl (1981, 1983).</page><page sequence="11">72 RES 13 SPRING 87 types (Aztec III);28 Aztec-period burials and sculptures; and adoratorios in the main area of Tula Grande. Diehl (1983: 168-169) does not believe that Tula Grande was the center of the late Aztec town, because the extensive damage to that part of the site made it uninhabitable. Pyramid C was completely looted and destroyed, and its revetment removed. Pyramid B, which had once been decorated on all sides with reliefs of birds, animals, and composite monsters, was stripped, except for one area on the east side that was hidden by a later structure. The shrine on top of the pyramid was destroyed, and a ramp was cut into the rear of the temple, presumably for removal or burial of the sculptures on top. Parts of these sculptures (all being composed of several stacked pieces) were found on the ramp and behind the pyramid. These comprised four 4.6 M. tall Atlantean warrior figures (fig. 5), piers with warrior reliefs, and cylindrical column sections decorated with feathers, which presumably represented feathered serpents (one tail section was also found at the site). The palaces were burned, and many of the bench reliefs representing processions of warriors were removed from their rooms and from the vestibule connecting the palaces and pyramids. There is also evidence of looting of buried caches, for instance in the Canal Locality Temple. Other Toltec sculptures found at Tula (most not in their original contexts) include chacmools (see fig. 13) (all but one broken), small supporting figures (telamones), miscellaneous relief panels, and other types. According to archaeologists, the destruction and looting of Tula probably began soon after the Toltec period and continued until the Conquest. Aztec groups are usually blamed for much of the damage to the site. In contrast to Teotihuacan, where it is known that the center was systematically destroyed at the fall of the city, it is not clear how much damage was done at the time of the fall of Tula, or how much happened later (see Diehl 1981: 292; and Mill?n, in press: n. 43). That Aztec groups did loot the city is indicated by a well known passage in Sahag?n: Then there they [the Toltecs] went?they went to live, to dwell on the banks of a river at Xicocotitlan, now called Tula. . . . And they left behind that which today is there, which is to be seen, which they did not finish ? the so called serpent column, the round stone pillar made into a serpent. Its head rests on the ground; its tail, its rattles are above. And the Tolteca mountain is to be seen; and the Tolteca pyramids, the mounds, and the surfacing of Tolteca [temples]. . . . And Tolteca bowls, Tolteca ollas are taken from the earth. And many times Tolteca jewels? arm bands, esteemed green stones, fine turquoise, emerald-green jade?are taken from the earth. . . . Sahag?n 1950-1982: bk. 10, 165 The amount of looting done by the Mexica specifically, however, is still in question. As will be seen, the archaeological materials found to date in Mexico City do not support the idea of massive looting of the site, and passages in written sources indicate that people other than the Mexica of Tenochtitlan went to Tula and removed art. In the 1420s their neighbors in Tlatelolco took a statue identified as the god Tlacahuepan from Tula back to their city (Historia de los Mexicanos por sus Pinturas 1973: 60).29 There are no mentions of similar practices in other towns, like Culhuacan, during the period intermediate between the Toltecs and the Mexica. There is evidence, however, that Tlaxcala, a Nahuatl-speaking town that was never conquered by the Aztec Triple Alliance, had strong memories of Tula. Motolinia (1971: 78) mentions that the Tlaxcalans had two deity ?mages, a large one, on which they put a mask that had come from Tula, and a small one that they had brought with them from Puyauhtlan, their place of origin on the border of the state of Tlaxcala (Sahag?n 1950-1982: bk. 2, 2d ed. revised, 43, n. 12). Given that the Tlaxcalans carried artworks from Tula and elsewhere, it is interesting that two Toltec telamones now in Vienna were collected in Tlaxcala.30 Judging from their style, these sculptures probably originated in Tula. In addition, among sculptures attributed to Tlaxcala are two chacmools and a related type of standing figure, who holds a circular 28. Aztec Black-on-Orange ceramics fall into three pre-Hispanic style groups. Aztec I and II correspond to ceramic spheres centering on Culhuacan and Tenayuca respectively and dating to ca. 1150 1350. Aztec III ceramics correspond to the period of Tepanec and Mexica dominance in Central Mexico, ca. 1350-1521. The presence of Aztec III ceramics at Tula may indicate Mexica activities. 29. According to Sahag?n (1950-1982: bk. 2, 2d ed., revised, 175) Tlacahuepan was a deity closely associated with Huitzilopochtli (the god of Tlatelolco as well as Tenochtitlan), especially during the festival of Panquetzaliztli, which celebrated Huitzilopochtli's birth and subsequent victory over his enemy siblings (by extension the deities of conquered groups). In myth (Sahag?n 1950-1982: bk. 3, 2d ed., revised, 17), Tlacahuepan was one of the "sorcerers" along with Huitzilopochtli and Titlacahuan (Tezcatlipoca), who predicted and helped effect Topiltzin Quetzalooatl's downfall. 30.

In 1519 Motecuhzoma II sent his priests to Tula to bury some pieces of biscuit that his messengers got from the Spaniards then in Veracruz. Afraid to eat it, Motecuhzoma said that it belonged to the gods and that to eat it would be a sacrilege. He told the priests to carry it solemnly to the city of Tula and to bury it in the temple of Quetzalcoatl,55 since those who had arrived here [the Spanish] were his sons. The priests took the biscuit, placed it in a gilded gourd, wrapped the latter in rich mantles and made a long procession to Tula. Along the way they incensed it and sang hymns honoring Quetzalcoatl, whose food they carried. Once it had reached Tula it was buried in his temple with great honors. Duran 1967, 2: 510-511; translation, Duran 1964: 267 Another important evidence of Mexica presence at Tula is a group of reliefs on the La Malinche hill across the river from Tula Grande (fig. 7). These represent a frontal image of Chalchiuhtlicue, the Aztec goddess of water and floods, faced by a profile Quetzalcoatl, who stands before a rampant feathered serpent (a Toltec convention)34 and lets blood from his ear. These reliefs 31. One of the chacmools is in the Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a (Seier 1960-1961, 2: 817, fig. 17) and the other is in a private collection (Von Winning 1960). The standing figure is in the Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a (Nicholson and Berger 1968, fig. 18). 32. The details of Motolinia's discussion of the larger sculpture in Tlaxcala reveal other connections with Tula and the Toltecs. It was a colossal figure (three estados, ca. 6 M. tall) and represented the Tlaxcalans' main god Camaxtli/Mixcoatl, who was the father of Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl. If it had the striped legs and net bag that are the usual characteristics of Mixcoatl, it would have resembled the colossal figures associated with Pyramid B in those details, as well as size. On the occasion of the god's main festival, the vestments of Quetzalcoatl were brought to Tlaxcala from Cholula, the center of Quetzalcoatl's worship in Aztec times. After they were put on the statue of Camaxtli with the mask from Tula, it was said, "Today Camaxtli goes out as his son." 33. It is not known which structure this might have been. We have no record of Aztec-period names for features at the site. There is a glorified description of Quetzalcoatl's Tula (Sahag?n 1950-1982: bk. 10, 166), but it cannot be matched with the remains. 34. This convention is common at Chichen Itza, and although rarer it is also represented at Tula ? for instance, the central figure of the relief in the Palace East of the Vestibule (fig. 9). Its presence in the Malinche reliefs and on other Aztec objects indicates a strong association with Tula.</page><page sequence="13">74 RES 13 SPRING 87 Figure 8.

On exhibit at the MNA are a total of eight figures facing right, twenty figures facing left, plus the two central figures. were most likely carved in 1500 (the date 8 Flint next to Chalchiuhtlicue), as part of ceremonies petitioning the goddess to stop a flood in Tenochtitlan. The flood had begun with the building of an aqueduct in the previous year, 7 Reed, a year associated with Quetzalcoatl. On a monument carved to celebrate that occasion, the rampant feathered serpent behind Ahuitzotl identifies him with Quetzalcoatl. The profile figure of Quetzalcoatl at Tula, then, is either Quetzalcoatl standing in for the king or Ahuitzotl himself, petitioning the goddess to stop the flood. The connection between Quetzalcoatl and these events explains the presence of the reliefs at Tula (see Umberger 1981: 129-132, 157-164).35 Moving to Tenochtitlan, the main features of the layout of Tula seem to have been duplicated by the Mexica. The plan of the sacred precinct in Sahag?n's Primeros Memoriales (fig. 2) depicts a west-facing main pyramid, aligned with an adoratorio, a skull rack, and a ball court to the west. As for the archaeological remains, the only certain Toltec object is a plumbate vessel found in an offering on Phase II of the Templo Mayor (Mus?e du Petit Palais 1981 : no. 37).36 Plumbate vessels are lustrous wares, which were made on the Pacific Coast of Guatemala and traded widely during the Toltec period. Since examples were common at both Tula and Teotihuacan, they could have been associated by the Mexica with both sites. Diehl (1983: 27) suggests that many sculptures were removed from Tula and taken to Tenochtitlan. The candidates for Toltec sculptures in Mexico City are close in iconography and general form to sculptures at Tula, but in all cases there are significant differences, indicating that they are Mexica copies. Two types of sculptures are involved: bench reliefs with processions of warriors and a group of four warrior figures in-the round. The bench reliefs are usually identified as Mexica (Beyer 1955; Moedano K?er 1947; Nicholson 1971: 11 7-118), but the figures are usually called Toltec (Nicholson 1971: 111, fig. 31, 119). Procession reliefs, which must have originally decorated benches, have been found on two phases of the Templo Mayor, where they were reused as construction materials. One group, discovered in 1913 (Beyer 1955), was set into the side wall of the pyramid platform of Phase III (fig. 8). Another group discovered in the recent excavations served as paving blocks on the northwest corner of the terrace in front of the pyramid (Phase IVb) (I have not seen them at close enough range to discuss them).37 A third group was found in their proper (presumably original) context? on the sides of benches in the interior rooms of the Platform of the Eagles, a structure to the north of the Templo Mayor (possibly Phase V [Matos 1984b: 19]). The benches have projecting sections, which seem to be places of special focus, as on the benches in the vestibule and palace areas of Tula. The procession reliefs, although similar to those still remaining at Tula (and likewise crude), are not in styles represented at the site. In addition, the Mexica 35. The site of Huitzilopochtli's birth, the hill of Coatepec in the province of Tula (location unknown), was the object of a pilgrimage in Motecuhzoma I's reign (Duran 1967, 2: 217). It was also said that after the Conquest, the image of Huitzilopochtli from the Templo Mayor was hidden in a cave near Tula (Padden, 1970, 266, 270). 36. An example of a reworked plumbate piece is a very similar dog vessel of unknown provenience, which has traces of stucco and blue paint on the surface. Ulf Bankmann recently suggested that it may have been renovated by the Aztecs and pointed out that blue dogs are depicted as accompanying the dead in Aztec manuscripts (Roemer- und Pelizaeus-Museum 1986: vol. 2, no. 130). 37. The reliefs are visible as dark blocks in Matos 1984a, ill. after p. 63, lower left corner.</page><page sequence="14">Umberger: Antiques, revivals, and references to the past in Aztec art 75 Figure 9. Figures on projecting section in situ inside entrance to Palace East of the Vestibule at Tula, Toltec, H. 45 cm. The figure in the center has a feathered serpent behind him. After Acosta 1954: fig. after p. 80. processions proceed from opposite directions and meet at a central section, featuring a pair of important personages flanking a zacatapayolli, a grass ball for the deposit of sacrificial points.38 This type of composition is characteristic of both the Platform of the Eagles reliefs and the ones discovered in 1913. In the case of the former, where the reliefs are still in their proper context, the central scenes are on the fronts of the projecting areas. The arrangement of the reliefs remaining at Tula (many are missing) indicates that the figures proceeded from left and right toward the stairway of Pyramid B, but there are no comparable central scenes. The only projecting area that still has relief decoration features an important person, but in a different manner (fig. 9). The other figures, in profile, proceed around the projection from right to left toward Pyramid B. The central figure on the front is highlighted by frontal presentation (with head turned back toward the procession) and a rampant feathered serpent behind him. The remains of the back of the next figure to the left indicate that the procession continued toward the pyramid stairway.39 Finally, a number of motifs represented in the Tenochtitlan reliefs are found only in Mexica art, for instance, the zacatapayolli and the smoking mirrors on the figure (probably a king) to the left of the center in the relief illustrated here (fig. 8). Moedano K?er (1947) has also pointed out that certain weapons are only depicted in the Mexica reliefs (atlatls, darts, and lances) and that the xiuhuitzolli headgear is more common. Whether there were intermediate examples of bench reliefs between the Tula and Mexica versions is unknown.40 The four warrior figures in question (fig. 10) were found in 1944 in the area to the west of the Templo Mayor (12 Guatemala Street) together with a late-style Mexica copy (fig. 11) (Mateos Higuera 1979: 213 214). Actually the latter is a copy of only three of the earlier figures (the fourth wears a skirt), which, although dressed in typical Toltec warrior outfits and resembling the colossal Atlantean figures at Tula in general form, 38. Klein (in press) has recently suggested that the Platform of the Eagles was the Tlacochcalco Cuauhquiauac, the House of Darts at the Eagle Gate, which was a place for bloodletting by the ruler and warriors (thus, the central focus on bloodletting instruments in the reliefs). She suggests the same purpose for similar rooms at Tula and Chichen Itza, and quotes Matos (personal communication) as saying that there is another, unexcavated room of this type flanking the south side of the Templo Mayor, complete with bench reliefs. 39. Another set of related reliefs was once located around the upper fa?ade of the open patio of Room 1 of the Burned Palace at Tula. Found broken and scattered on the floor of the room, their arrangement was hypothetically reconstructed by Acosta (1954: 112) as follows: a series of recumbent figures flanking and facing central bowl-like objects containing an unidentified mass with projections, one in the center of each wall. If this is the proper reconstruction, there is a similarity to the Mexica reliefs in that a cult object is featured in a composition with a central focus. In addition, there are procession scenes with a central focus on a similar object (which does not look like a Mexica zacatapayolli) at Chichen Itza (Moedano K?er 1947: 127). Thus the type existed on the Toltec horizon, but none remains at Tula. 40. It is interesting that the reliefs found in Mexico City were associated with phases of both early and late date at the Templo Mayor (Phases III, IVb, and V). By Phases IVb and V the Mexica's distinctive late style had evolved, yet the reliefs on those levels are not in the late style. They either were reused from earlier buildings or were made by artists not practicing the late style. There are other, less finely carved sculptures on these levels ?the serpent heads that decorate Phases IV and IVb, for instance. Providing a contrast is a late-style version of this type of procession relief, the Stone of the Warriors, which was probably created between 1450 and 1480 and therefore roughly contemporary with Phases IVb and V. This monument (Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a; Nicholson 1971: 124, fig. 57) represents a similar procession of warriors around the sides of a single large block, which, like the projecting sections of the bench reliefs, served as a seat or altar.</page><page sequence="15">76 RES 13 SPRING 87 Figure 10. One of four warrior figures found at 12 Guatemala Street (formerly Escalerillas Street) behind Cathedral, Mexica/ Aztec, H. 1.15 m., MNA. By permission of INAH. were almost certainly not made by the Toltecs. The only small standing human figures at the site, the telamones with upraised arms, are smaller in size (Wendy Schonfeld, personal communication) and not at all similar in style. Schonfeld has also observed that the four figures have holes in the chests for the insertion of jade, an Aztec characteristic not found on Toltec figures, and that these holes were part of the original conception. (Note the low position of the necklace and pectoral to allow for the hole.) It is therefore probable that the four figures are earlier Mexica sculptures, derived either from the Atlantean figures or a smaller Toltec version (now lost), and then copied by a later Mexica artist. The differences between the two Aztec versions are interesting. The copy is point for point very close in terms of pose, proportions, and paraphernalia. However, it has the typical and unmistakable attributes of the late aesthetic?the inflated surfaces contrasting with flat surfaces, greater projection of planes, enlarged hands, and carefully articulated sandals, hands, feet, Figure 11. Late Mexica copy found in same location, H. 1.30 m., MNA. Photograph courtesy INAH. and border details. The characteristics of this aesthetic appear in early form in figures from Phase IV of the Templo Mayor (1450s) and in developed form in the Coyolxauhqui relief sculpture on Phase IVb (1460s). Thus, although the date of the four matching figures is unknown, the late-style copy probably postdates the mid-1460s.41 The chacmool is another important sculptural type derived from the Toltecs.42 Pre-Mexica versions made in Central Mexico in the period after the fall of the Toltecs, for instance those at Tlaxcala, must have been purposeful, overt references to Tula. The Mexica would also have known the chacmool to be a Toltec type; of 41.

Several chacmools have been discovered in Tenochtitlan (one in the early style and three in the late style). These Mexica versions, even the early one, could never be mistaken for Toltec originals. They are more the result of a series of replicas rather than of firsthand study. The chacmool on Phase II of the Templo Mayor (fig. 12) is the earliest datable Mexica version. The outline and arrangement of masses of the Tenochtitlan sculpture are distinctively different from the Tula type, which is a standardized form at the site. Replacing the flat upper surface and container of the Toltec chacmools is a large three-dimensional bowl sitting on the stomach and held by hands with splayed fingers.43 There are two other Central Mexican chacmools with this same emphasis on the round bowl, one of unknown provenience now on the pyramid of Santa Cecilia Acatitlan in a northern suburb of Mexico City (fig. 14) (Solis 1976: 13, fig. 25) and one in the site museum at Tula. Both are missing their heads, are rougher in style than the Mexica chacmool, and lack the painted decoration and costume details. The Mexica chacmool was visible on the platform of the Templo Mayor before and during the war of independence from the Tepanecs and was covered by 1431, when the temple was rebuilt for the coronation ceremonies following the war (see Umberger, in press a). The three chacmools, then, probably represent a type popular during the time of Tepanec domination before the political rise of the Mexica.44 Although their interrelationship is unknown, it can be said that the Tenochtitlan version is more monumental and more artistically advanced. There is already the Mexica propensity for articulating details of costume. In addition, unlike the other two chacmools, some costume parts are of Toltec origin ? the triangular apron, the garment covering the upper body, and the blocklike earplugs. This indicates knowledge of the original source of the chacmool form and the Mexica's more conscious and explicit form of archaizing. The late-style Mexica chacmools (fig. 15)45 likewise are not specifically related to the Tula type, and again they seem to have developed from the earlier post Toltec version. However, the Mexican consciousness of the relationship of this distinctive form to the past is evident in the wearing of antique picture-plaque jades (to be discussed below) and the identification of two of the chacmools with an ancient god, Tlaloc.46 Thus it can be said that Mexica chacmools are the result of a continuing tradition, but with knowledge of their source in Tula, and they were meant to recall this link to the past. One interesting question concerns the identification of chacmools with deities. In the most recent discussion of chacmools in Mesoamerica, M. Miller (1985: 15-17) points out that in addition to the two late Mexica chacmools with Tlaloc attributes, the early chacmool at the Templo Mayor is associated with Tlaloc because of its placement in front of the god's shrine. From this she suggests that the chacmool form in Mesoamerica is generally associated with Tlaloc. Earlier Central Mexican chacmools, however, including those at Tula, seem not to be elaborated with recognizable deity attributes. The attributes on the only whole example at Tula (fig. 13) include the ''butterfly" breastplate and triangular apron worn by the Atlantean figures at the site, as well as a knife on the shoulder and the pointed headdress of a lord. The breastplate and crown may identify the figure as Xiuhtecuhtli, the old fire god, or they may just identify him as a Toltec lord. Thus I agree with Esther Pasztory (in press) that the association of the chacmool and Tlaloc in late times is probably a Mexica invention, not a survival from the deep past. As will become apparent in the following examples of archaizing sculptures, the Mexica often combined an old form with deity characteristics differing from the original model. At this point, I think that the Tlaloc chacmools are more likely to be the result of a 43. Although without the detailed articulation of fingernails, lines, and knuckles of the late style, this is the earliest dated example showing the Mexica focus on hands. 44. An early ceramic example of a chacmool with bowl-shaped container was found at Culhuacan in a stratigraphie level with early Aztec ceramics (Aztec I and II) (S?journ? 1970: [1051). This association seems to indicate a pre-1350 date for the initiation of the bowl-shaped container on chacmools. It is of unknown size (but presumably small, given the material) and missing its head, as is true of most Central Mexican chacmools. 45. The other two chacmools are of about the same date as the one illustrated, judging from their style and imagery, but they are both badly damaged. One is in the Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a (Seier 1960-1961, 2: 819, fig. 18) and the other is in the Museo de Santa Cecilia Acatitlan (Solis 1976: 12, figs. 22-24). The interrelationship of the three sculptures is unknown. 46. Pasztory (in press) points out that the Tlaloc chacmool (fig. 13) also has a trapeze-and-ray in his headdress, an ancient symbol associated with Tlaloc and not depicted in Aztec art.</page><page sequence="17">78 RES 13 SPRING 87 14 Figure 12.

Carved in a panel on the front of each vase is the motif of a standing figure with rampant serpent behind him. As Nicholson and Keber suggest, the vases are imitations of an X Fine Orange vessel type (1983: 95). Although no exact prototype is known, both the vessel type and figurai motif were common in Toltec times. Cylindrical pedestal vessels in various wares have been found all over Mesoamerica. True X Fine Orange vessels bearing Toltec motifs seem to have been made on the southern Gulf Coast and are found principally in Veracruz and the Yucatan Peninsula. Strangely, no true X Fine Orange has been found at Tula (Diehl 1981 : 289), but rather a related type, which Acosta called Polished Orange (1956-1957: 91). Nicholson and Keber cite as a prototype for the Mexica vessels a vase in Vienna (fig. 17), of unknown provenience, which is a Toltec-period ware imitating X Fine Orange (Christian Feest, letter, April 1, 1986; see also Nowotny 1959: 136-137). It has the same shape and a carved panel, although the scene is multifigured. Acosta found pieces of another related vase at Tula (fig. 18) ? probably a bell-shaped pedestal vessel (also a common form in Toltec times). Of interest is the relief panel depicting a profile male figure with feathered serpent behind. It is not known if there was an original closer to the Mexica vases, which is quite possible, or if the artist conflated a Toltec-period vase type with a Toltec type of composition.48 The vases were buried next to the monumental Coyolxauhqui Stone, representing Huitzilopochtli's defeated enemy sister, at the base of the Huitzilopochtli side of the Templo Mayor. They contained incinerated human remains. From their location one would assume that it was the cremation of an important person, possibly Motecuhzoma I, who died in 1469, a date associated with this phase by Matos (1981a: 50; see Umberger, in press a). If these were a king's funerary vessels, the use of a Toltec period form would be appropriate (Nicholson, in press). It is interesting that although the figurai prototype is Toltec, the Mexica arranged the vases in the holes in which they were buried to conform to a Mexica type of composition; the profile figures on the two vases were oriented toward the west and faced each other. This pairing of figures is commonly used for representations of kings, as in the central section of the bench reliefs found in 1913 (fig. 8). Klein (in press) suggests that this composition type is associated with the passing of power from one ruler to another at the time of a death and accession. In addition, the figures are dressed in deity costumes that would not have been found in Toltec prototypes. One seems to be a combination of Mixcoatl and Xiuhtecuhtli, the Old Fire God, and the other is a form of Tezcatlipoca standing before a feathered serpent (Nicholson with Keber 1983: 95-96). Several other large Toltec-like ceramic vessels (fig. 19) were found in the interior rooms of the Platform of the Eagles. There are eight vessels altogether, six with what Matos and other archaeologists identify as weeping Tlaloc faces (Matos 1984b: 20). Large braziers decorated with Tlaloc faces have been found in many parts of Mesoamerica and date from Toltec times up to the Conquest (Fernando Robles, letter, June 12, 1986). In photographs (Matos 1984b: photos 9, 10; 1984a: ill. on 102-103) the vessels at the Templo Mayor look very like a Tula ceramic type, called Abra Coarse Brown by recent archaeologists (Cobean 1978) (fig. 20). There are two basic problems with these related ceramics at Tenochtitlan and Tula. First, it is unclear whether 47. I think it is a coincidence that two chacmools at Chichen Itza have Tlaloc faces or Chac (Maya rain god) faces on their earplugs (Miller 1985: 17), given the lack of evidence of Tlaloc associations on the chacmools between these and the Mexica versions. 48. Another similar vase, but of true X Fine Orange, is a bell shaped pedestal vessel from Chichen Itza. Painted around the sides is a procession of Toltec warriors with feathered serpents behind them. Again, only parts of the vase remain. It was classified by Brainerd (1958: fig. 89a) as an imported ware from Veracruz, Cerro Montoso Polychrome. Another, beaker-shaped orange vessel in Vienna has pairs of Toltec warriors in carved panels on opposite sides (Becker Donner 1965: no. 124, p. 18, pi. 32; Nowotny 1959: 134-136). Mayer (1844: 106-108) illustrates this vessel and says it was found on the Cerro del Tesoro (Tula Grande). Besides the affiliation with X Fine Orange, the Mexica vessels from the Templo Mayor seem to have other connections with Veracruz. The figure on the one illustrated (fig. 16) has two left hands, something that is rare in Aztec art proper but characteristic of the Aztec provincial style around Castillo de Teayo, Veracruz, and Huastec shell carvings. This may perhaps indicate a Veracruz artist and Mexica awareness that Toltec-type ceramics are found in Veracruz. The reference is still to the Toltecs, given the strong connection between Tula and the man with serpent motif, evident in the Malinche reliefs (fig. 7).</page><page sequence="19">80 RES 13 SPRING 87 Figure 16.

Photograph by Salvador Guil'liem Arroyo, courtesy INAH. those at Tula are Toltec or Aztec; and second, the relationships between the various vessels need to be clarified through technical and stylistic analysis (they are currently being studied by Francisco Hinojoza). Acosta found fragments of this vessel type and late Aztec ceramics scattered around the Aztec-period adoratorio next to Pyramid C at Tula (Acosta 1954: 107-111, pis. 51-52).49 He thus believed that the vessels were Aztec productions inspired by Toltec types and suggested that they were used in a ceremony featuring ceramic breakage like the New Fire Ceremony (1954: 114). Cobean (1974: 35), however, decided from the context of the remains of another vessel found next to the Canal Locality Temple that the known examples at Tula are probably Toltec period in date. Figure 17. Toltec-period imitation Fine Orange vessel, provenience unknown, H. 24.8 cm. Photograph courtesy Museum f?r V?lkerkunde, Vienna. The eight vessels in Mexico City give rise to new questions about the whole group; and the answers at this point are inconclusive. There is nothing about any of these vessels that recalls the late Aztec style so well known in other media. Yet Eduardo Matos (letter, April 22, 1986) does not think there is any evidence of Mexica repairs to the Tenochtitlan vessels?which would suggest that they are Mexica productions, as would their size and number.50 On the other hand, Robert Cobean (letter, September 25, 1986) thinks that the Templo Mayor vessels are probably Toltec productions (on the basis of style), although they vary from the Tula vessels in details. Large storage areas, where the Mexica could have discovered such vessels 49. The adoratorio was built next to Pyramid C after the latter was stripped of its revetment, and thus it is dated to post-Toltec times. Whether it is early or late Aztec is unknown. Acosta (1954: 111) believed that the platform and the scattered ceramics around it, including the Abra Coarse Brown fragments, were late Aztec, that is, Mexica period (some of the ceramics definitely are). 50. In addition, Mexica "fancy" ceramics are not well known and may vary from the styles evident in other media (this is true of Aztec III Black-on-Orange ceramics).</page><page sequence="20">Umberger: Antiques, revivals, and references to the past in Aztec art 81 Figure 18.

Whatever the exact situation, the discovery of such closely related examples in a Toltec context at Tenochtitlan and in a late Aztec context at Tula suggests that the Mexica thought of the form as Toltec. There is another interesting Templo Mayor vessel, representing a skeletal figure, which Nagao (1985a: 72-73) suggests is a copy of a plumbate vessel in a light greenish stone.51 Other sculptures which seem to be in a style somewhere between Toltec and Mexica, are two reliefs of birds of prey clutching hearts, like those on Pyramid B at Tula, but finer in carving style, polychromed (rather than stuccoed in white), and including additional motifs in the background.52 In summary, it must be pointed out that the few true Toltec and Teotihuacan objects found to date in Mexico City do not implicate the Mexica in the extensive looting apparent at the two cities. There are many more Mexica imitations than antiques. It is also evident from the written sources on Teotihuacan that large sculptures of deities, including Tonacatecuhtli who was thought to be a "Toltec" god (Alva Ixtlilxochitl 1975-1977: 1, 272-273), were worshiped by the Mexica and their neighbors at the site (see below). Whether these were ancient or modern ?mages is unknown, but their presence does indicate that that city was treated with respect, and was not considered merely a place to be Figure 19.

Likewise, the evidence of pilgrimages to Tula and the burial of offerings seem to suggest the same thing. Teotihuacan53 If Tula was associated in Mexica thought with Quetzalcoatl, warrior figures, dynastic legitimacy, and cultural precedents, Teotihuacan was linked with a sacred, cosmic event at the beginning of the present era of time?the birth of the sun. In the year 1 Rabbit, the fourth era of time ended in a great flood and the fifth era began with a period of darkness that lasted until 13 Reed, twenty-six years later,54 when the gods gathered at Teotihuacan for the birth of the new sun. After a rich god failed to leap into the fire that would transform him into the sun, a poor, sore-ridden god dared and became the 4 Movement sun. Then the rich god jumped into the ashes and became the moon (Sahag?n 1950-1982: bk. 7, 3-9). The best-known Aztec reference to specific features at the site of Teotihuacan is also found in the Florentine Codex: Offerings were made at a place named Teotiuacan. And there all the people raised pyramids for the sun and for the moon; then they made many small pyramids where offerings were made. And there leaders were elected. . . . And when the rulers died, they buried them there. Sahag?n 1950-1982: bk. 10, 191-192 Teotihuacan (fig. 21) was the largest Precolumbian city in Mesoamerica, covering eight square miles. Its population, estimated up to 125,000, was only equaled or exceeded by that of Tenochtitlan. The plan has two wide avenues oriented toward the cardinal directions and dividing the city into four quarters. The avenues meet at a point in front of a great ceremonial-civic complex, the Ciudadela, which encloses the so-called Temple of Quetzalcoatl. The northern end of the north south avenue, the Street of the Dead, is limited in access by a palace complex and features the two largest pyramids in the city, the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon. In 1971 a cave was discovered under the west facing Pyramid of the Sun. This was apparently an important place of pilgrimage from early times and probably the original source of the city's power. Figure 21. Teotihuacan in 1865, as it appeared before restoration. Seler 1960-1961, 5: 406, fig. 1, by permission of Akademische Druck- u. Verlagsanstalt, Graz. Periodically at unknown times in its history, the long passageway was sealed by walls (which were later broken), and although an Aztec sherd was found near the entrance, it is not known if the Aztecs were aware of the cave (Heyden 1975: 134). Acosta removed all materials from its floor for study. Unfortunately, the results were never published (Mill?n 1981: 233), so the dates of use are not known. Mill?n (in press) suggests the possibility that Teotihuacan's original attraction was the same as in Aztec times, its claim to be the birthplace of the sun,55 and that the cave under the 53. For an overview of Teotihuacan archaeology, see Mill?n 1973, 1981. 54. Anales de Cuauhtitlan 1973: 5; Historia de los mexicanos por sus pinturas 1973: 32, 36. 55. A variation on this suggestion, made by Davies (1984: 210), is that the fifth and final sun was born after the fall of Teotihuacan.</page><page sequence="22">Umberger: Antiques, revivals, and references to the past in Aztec art 83 pyramid was an appropriate place for this and other types of origins?a symbolic function of caves throughout Mesoamerica (see Heyden 1975). There may have been a cave under the Pyramid of the Moon also (see Kubier 1982: 50). The most noticeable characteristic of Teotihuacan architecture is the talud-and-tablero (sloping base supporting rectangular panel) profile of the stepped levels of its pyramid platforms (see fig. 28). Mural paintings, the city's main art form, once covered all surfaces with bright polychromy. Although sculpture is rarer at Teotihuacan, the city's artists did create some distinctive forms, such as anthropomorphic face masks and braziers representing the Old Fire God supporting a container. In addition to the sloped line with rectangular panel, another popular combination of shapes was a curvilinear solid on a truncated cone. Like Tula, the peripheral areas of Teotihuacan were reoccupied after its fall in around 750; the sacred center, however, was totally destroyed, and although used for ceremonies by later people, it was never again inhabited. In late Aztec times, Teotihuacan was within the jurisdiction of Tetzcoco, Tenochtitlan's ally, and there were five Aztec communities, notably San Juan Teotihuacan and San Francisco Mazap?n, near and on the ruins. There is some evidence of Aztec presence in the ceremonial center?for instance Aztec-period burials on the east side of the Ciudadela and possibly an adoratorio in front of the Pyramid of the Sun. The well-known Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl, which featured sculptures of double-headed, feathered serpents, was stripped of these sculptures, except for a section that was covered by a later platform. When this was done and by whom is not known. Evidence of the appearance and use of Teotihuacan in Aztec times is found in the 1580 Relaci?n de Tecc?ztlan y su partido (Paso y Troncoso 1905-1906, 6: 221-222). In the map accompanying the relaci?n (fig. 22), two large pyramids and seven smaller platforms are located around a rectangular area, presumably the north part of the north-south avenue, containing the words "or?culo de Montecuma." The text identifies the two main pyramids, the largest as the Pyramid of the Sun and the one to the north as the Pyramid of the Moon. On the summit of the Sun and facing west was a stone idol of Tonacatecuhtli (Lord of Sustenance), of one piece of stone and three brazas tall (about 5 M.). On a lower platform in front of the pyramid was a smaller idol called Mictlantecuhtli (Lord of the Dead). Another idol three brazas tall and representing the Moon was on the Pyramid of the Moon. Around this pyramid were many other platforms, on the largest of which were six other idols called the brothers or siblings of the Moon.56 "To all of these the priests of Montesuma, lord of Mexico, went, with the said Montesuma, each twenty days to sacrifice." Every fourth year there was a ceremony in a great plaza between the pyramids, during which wrong-doers were punished on a small platform two estados high (ca. 4 M.). The question is whether the Aztecs were reusing Teotihuacan deity ?mages found at the site, images of their own, or a combination of the two. According to early sources (see Pe?afiel 1900: 34), the sculptures were destroyed by Bishop Zum?rraga in the sixteenth century. However, two large Teotihuacan period sculptures at the site could be the remains of these deity images. One is the 3 M. tall sculpture of a female deity discovered in 1889 at the southwest corner of the Figure 22. Detail of map of Tecciztlan and environs showing site of Teotihuacan (in center), from relaci?n geogr?fica o? 1580. Paso y Troncoso 1905-1906, 6: map after p. 222. 56. Alva Ixtlilxochitl (1975-1977, 1: 272-273) gives much of the same information about the Aztec-period idols at Teotihuacan: "Los ?dolos de los tultecas que antiguamente tuvieron, fueron los m?s principales que fue Tonacateuhtli, y hoy en d?a est? su personaje en el c? Ipyramidl mas alto, que es dedicado al sol, de este pueblo JTeotihuacanl, que quiere decir dios del sustento, y |a| su mujer ten?an Jporl otra diosa, y dicen que este dios del sustento era figurado al sol y su mujer a la luna, y otras diosas que llamaban las hermanas del sol y luna, que todav?a hay pedazos de ellas en los cues de este pueblo. . . ." It is interesting that the relaci?n and Alva Ixtlilxochitl indicate the Aztecs' connection of Tonacatecuhtli, Lord of Sustenance, with the sun and the main west-facing pyramid of Teotihuacan, which may have been a double temple like the Templo Mayor (to be discussed further on). This information complements Nagao's (1985b) identification of the mysterious Two-Horned God images found in a number of caches at the Templo Mayor as representations of the same deity (also known as Ometecuhtli, Lord of Duality).</page><page sequence="23">84 RES 13 SPRING 87 plaza of the Pyramid of the Moon; the other is a fragment of a similar sculpture found nearby (Seler 1960-1961, 5: 435-437, fig. 27, pi. 17, nos. 1, 2). The most interesting remains are death images that may have been associated with the Mictlantecuhtli platform. Beyer (1922 170-171: pi. 82a, b) suggested that two profile skull sculptures found about 100 meters east of the Pyramid of the Sun were part of this shrine, either left there from Teotihuacan times or moved there by the Aztecs. In 1963 Chadwick excavated a large sculpture, representing a frontal skull framed by a large pleated circular element, near the platform in front of the Pyramid of the Sun. This he suggested may have been the death god image described as being on the platform (Mill?n 1973: fig. 21b).57 Another possibility is a sculpture in the Teotihuacan site museum (see fig. 25), which one can assume (from the two Mexica copies to be discussed below) was visible in Aztec times, although its original location at the site is unrecorded. The sculpture is a Janus figure, with skeletal faces on front and back. The body is a truncated cone with stylized ribs, four arms, and a row of skulls in relief around the base. These skulls match in details the large profile skull sculptures found previously near the Pyramid of the Sun. They share the distinctive upturned curl in the nose area, the volute where the jaw and cheek meet, and the knot behind the head.58 These similarities may indicate that the three sculptures were part of the same ensemble. The large plaza with platform used for punishment of criminals may be either in front of the Pyramid of the Moon or at the Ciudadela, or, less likely, the smaller one in front of the Sun.59 There are several aspects of the layout of Teotihuacan that are repeated in Tenochtitlan. Both cities were organized by grid plans and two main north-south and east-west avenues meeting in the center. Both also had a main west-facing pyramid, but that of Tenochtitlan was placed at the meeting place of the avenues, rather than to the north. According to Mill?n (1976: 238), the Teotihuacan Pyramid of the Sun may have had two shrines on top also. If so, some evidence points to its having been shared by rain and sun deities, as in the case of the Mexica temple.60 Actual Teotihuacan objects found in Mexico City include figurines, masks, and ceramic vessels, cached at and near the Templo Mayor61 and in front of a small temple to the south (near the corner of Pi?o Suarez and Izazaga streets) (Gussinyer 1970a). An important modified antique of unknown provenience is a Teotihuacan serpentine figure inscribed in Postclassic times with the dates 13 Reed and 1 Flint on its chest (fig. 23). In the Mexica calendar these were two years at the middle of the fifty-two-year cycle, the most important position in the cycle. Thirteen Reed was the date of the sun's birth at Teotihuacan, and 1 Flint was a date of multiple references of political importance to the Mexica (see Umberger, in press b). It was the date of Huitzilopochtli's birth, the year the Mexica left on their migration from their homeland, and the year they overthrew the Tepanec capital city (1428). When inscribed together with the date of the sun's birth, it probably signified the birth of the "Mexica sun" in a political sense, and the ascendance of the Mexica as the people of the sun.62 Both dates were associated 57. Von Winning (n.d.) suggests that this sculpture is actually Aztec, because death images are very rare at Teotihuacan, but I agree with Esther Pasztory (letter to Von Winning, December 2, 1980) that its style is consistent with that of other Teotihuacan sculptures. She cites a Teotihuacan mural that depicts skulls (A. Miller 1973: 57, fig. 47). 58. This same type of skull is presented frontally in the mural cited by Pasztory, indicating the Teotihuacan origin of the type. 59. Other early sources of information on Teotihuacan are the Mazap?n maps (Kubier 1982) of which there are three copies, showing the layout of the city in the early colonial period and including N?huatl glosses naming many parts of the site, the north south avenue, for instance, which was then, as it is now, called the Street of the Dead. The maps indicate other places of significance to the Aztecs, for instance, a "place of reverence" west of the Pyramid of the Moon and a "place of burials in honor of the sun" behind the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl in the courtyard of the Ciudadela, which may possibly correspond with Aztec-period burials recently excavated in Structure 1R on the east platform (Martinez and Jarquin 1982: 45; Romero 1982). An Aztec III jar was associated with a child's burial, which was accompanied by a fragment of a Teotihuacan sculpture (not illustrated). An adult burial nearby included two vases of Tetzcoco Red-on-Black ware. See Kubier's analysis of the N?huatl glosses of the Mazap?n maps and discussion of other early maps of Teotihuacan. See also Hodge (1984: 117-132) for further information on Aztec-period Teotihuacan. 60. Associated with Tlaloc, the rain god, are the cave (his name means "path through the earth" in N?huatl) and the child sacrifices found at the corners of the stepped levels of the pyramid (Heyden 1975: 141). Alva Ixtlilxochitl (1975-1977, 1: 272-273), after his description of the "Toltec" city of Teotihuacan, states that the Toltecs sacrificed children to Tlaloc.

The Flint date, represented as a knife with face and speech scroll, could be Aztec, but the Reed date is atypical, consisting of two reed arrows with points visible (in the Mixtee manner) rather than the usual reed shaft and leaves emanating from a vase seen in cross-section (see fig. 35). There are two possibilities: either the inscription is that of a non-Mexica group using similar symbolic associations,64 or a foreign artist working for the Mexica. At present I do not know the answer, but I think the latter explanation is possible because of the speech scroll on the Flint date. As far as I know, speech scrolls occur only on Aztec dates. There are two late Aztec-style monuments that use arrows for Reed dates, and another Aztec period sculpture at Castillo de Teayo, Veracruz, with the dates 1 Flint and 13 Reed in a nonconventional, provincial style.65 The atypical style of these inscriptions of 0 ?w&gt; &lt;jg? ^r ?o?

Parts of two similar greenstone figures were found in the House of the Priests adjacent to the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan (Seler 1960-1961, 5: 434, fig. 26). Could the Hamburg figure have come from this area also? If so, its association with the date of the sun's birth would have been especially appropriate. 64. There is some evidence that these two dates were important and had similar symbolic associations in Early Postclassic times. The connection of 13 Reed with the sun goes back at least to Xochicalco, where it is inscribed on the back of Stela 3; on the front of the same monument is 4 Movement, the calendric name of the sun in Aztec times (see Caso 1967: 186, pi. 3). I feel that the inscription of these two dates together indicates the same symbolic association with the sun that they had in later times (on the relationship of 13 Reed and 4 Movement, see Umberger 1981: 203-204). That the date 13 Reed was significant at Xochicalco is indicated by its appearance on three, possibly four, monuments (Berlo, in press). One Flint does not appear in the known Xochicalco inscriptions. However, in the written sources it is associated with the migrations of groups besides the Mexica, which probably indicates that it had political associations before the Mexica expropriated it. One Flint and 13 Reed are inscribed on two boxes excavated by local people at Tolcayuca, Hidalgo (Cossio 1942: photos 10, 14; these boxes were called to my attention by H. B. Nicholson, personal communication). Most of the other materials at the site are Mazap?n (Toltec period), and the carved dates, which are very difficult to see in the photographs, are unconventional in relation to Mexica inscriptions. The boxes may thus indicate the linking of the two dates in pre-Aztec times. 65. For the two Aztec objects with arrows for reed dates, see Caso 1967: 68, fig. 20; Nicholson 1956: 99, fig. 3.

Two such incidents are recorded in the written sources. On one occasion during the 1450s, the Mexica made Tepanec artists carve a sacrificial stone on which was depicted the defeat of their own nation (Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975: 318-319). The year of that defeat, 1 Flint, may very well have been carved on the monument. At another time also in the reign of Motecuhzoma I, on the day 1 Flint, Huitzilopochtli's ceremonial day, artists from nearby communities were brought to Tenochtitlan to carve images of the gods that Huitzilopochtli had conquered (Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975: 356).66 In the category of archaizing monuments are four platforms (Boone 1985: 179) and four stone sculptures. A bust-length death figure (fig. 24), found in 1900 in front of and on axis with the Huitzilopochtli half of the Templo Mayor, seems to be a copy of the death figure in the Teotihuacan site museum (fig. 25; this is the only known Teotihuacan example of this type). The Mexica version was found in battered condition under a pre Hispanic floor in front of a small west-facing platform. It reproduces the general shape and motifs of the Teotihuacan figure (four arms, stylized ribs and skulls around the base), but has only one face. Made of greenstone, the image was further modified by the addition of Aztec deity characteristics. It wears the head decoration of Coyolxauhqui, Huitzilopochtli's enemy sister whom he killed soon after his birth at Coatepec. In addition, on top of the head the representation of the sign for grass (malinalli) including its flowers (xochitl) may refer to Malinalxochitl, another enemy sister, whom Huitzilopochtli abandoned near Malinalco, a town south of Tenochtitlan, during the Mexica migration (Peterson 1983: 122). The figure is dead, like Coyolxauhqui, but not decapitated. Its location in front of the temple, which represented Coatepec, is appropriate for a Coyolxauhqui image (other Coyolxauhqui sculptures were placed on that axis), and the use of greenstone is not unprecedented in representations of this deity.67 The sculpture then must Figure 24.

Another sculpture (fig. 26) (Seler 1960-1961, 2: 843-846) similar to the greenstone death figure but of gray volcanic stone and without the Coyolxauhqui headdress, was found with four cihuateteo, death goddesses, at the corner of 16 de Septiembre and Isabel la Cat?lica streets. It has hair like a cihuateotl (sing.) and therefore may represent an archaizing version of that type; the date 7 Flower on top of the head may be a calendric name. It is interesting that the Mexica used the same model for figures with different identities, a Coyolxauhqui type and a cihuateotl. Perhaps this 66.

The Coyolxauhqui figure, representing the enemy of Huitzilopochtli, was destroyed in pre-Hispanic times and interred below a pavement; the other was not damaged. The dating of these two late-style archaizing sculptures is difficult. They may have been made in the 1480s or 1490s, in the reign of Ahuitzotl, with other female death deities.68 The four Teotihuacan-style structures include two Red Temples flanking the north and south sides of the Figure 26. Mexica gray stone, archaizing cihuateotl, found at corner of 16 de Septiembre and Isabel la Cat?lica Streets, H. 1.14 m., MNA. By permission of INAH. Templo Mayor, another, more distant platform to the west of the Templo Mayor (on Guatemala Street, now in the garden of the Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a), and a fourth one north of the Templo Mayor (near the corner of Argentina and Justo Sierra Streets).69 They all feature the typical Teotihuacan talud-and-tablero profile, and at least one, the Red Temple north of the Templo Mayor, has pseudo-Teotihuacan paintings in the form of broad vertical bands, each containing a large red-rimmed eye, on the sloping talud (fig. 27). On the alfardas (sloping panels) framing the stairway the bands are horizontal. Bands with eyes represent liquid at Teotihuacan and are ubiquitous at the site. Although 68. Unfortunately, the correspondence of the 1900 excavation to the recently defined levels of the Templo Mayor is unknown. The greenstone figure has a Tlaloc earth monster on the bottom very like that on the great Coatlicue and Yolotlicue sculptures, which may date from around 1491, the date 12 Reed carved on both (Umberger 1981: 77-78). The gray stone figure was found with a colossal head bearing the same date (Mateos Higuera 1979: 226-227). 69.

The platform farther north is painted with a Tlaloc design (Matos 1964: fig. 2). Tlaloc was an ancient god associated with Teotihuacan, but the painting does not follow Teotihuacan conventions. Boone (1985: 179) comments that all four platforms with ta/ud-and-tab/ero profiles would have recalled Teotihuacan also because of their bright polychromy, in contrast to the other buildings in the ceremonial precinct, which were probably white. During the recent excavations, an important archaizing sculpture was found in the area behind the Red Temple with pseudo-Teotihuacan paintings (fig. 29). It is a late Mexica sculpture of Tlaloc in a pose derived from Teotihuacan sculptures of an old man carrying a brazier on his head, which modern scholars interpret as representing the Old Fire God (fig. 30). This is a typical Teotihuacan type found in several places in the city, and thus is comparable to the Toltec chacmool. The Mexica version is, in fact, very close in style and iconography to the Tlaloc chacmool (fig. 15). Both figures wear heavy jade necklaces with antique picture-plaques and carry vessels, one full of water and I_/ \ Figure 28.

Although some scholars suggest that the figure in the pose of the Old Fire God is a conflation of Tlaloc and the Old Fire God (Nicholson with Keber 1983: 35; L?pez Austin, in press), I do not think there are any intentional references to the original Teotihuacan deity on the sculpture. Even the eyes in the decorative band around the vessel, typical motifs on the Teotihuacan sculptures, are misunderstood and transformed into flowerlike forms. In Mexica times, the fire god, Xiuhtecuhtli, had taken a different form, and it is possible that the artist did not know the identity of the Teotihuacan deity. Or if he did know its identity, he chose to ignore it, borrowing only its distinctive pose. I am thus* extending Esther Pasztory's (in press) line of thought on the Tlaloc chacmool in suggesting that both archaizing Tlalocs are conflations of the ancient deity with the most typical figurai forms of the cities with which the Aztecs associated him (Alva Ixtlilxochitl 1975-1977, 1: 273). The Teotihuacanoid sculpture has a date on the back, 11 Reed, which probably refers to the year 1503, the second year of Motecuhzoma H's reign. The Tlaloc chacmool was certainly carved around the same time, which according to the written sources was a period of concern about water. The inauguration of the new aqueduct in 1499 and ceremonies to stop the subsequent flood were occasions for the making of images of water deities. The written sources emphasize the part played by Chalchiuhtlicue, goddess of the water of the lake. The priest who welcomed the water to the city dressed as the goddess, and a sculpture of Chalchiuhtlicue was later thrown into the spring where the aqueduct started (Duran 1967, 2: 375-381). She was also depicted in the reliefs on the Cerro La Malinche at Tula. Tlaloc was a participant, too, although not as important in the written accounts. After the flood, Tenochtitlan suffered a serious drought, and normal conditions did not return until 2 Reed (1507). It is not surprising that sculptures and structures with aquatic imagery were created at this time. Another sculpture of interest (fig. 31) was first published in 1900 with an implied provenience of Teotihuacan (Pe?afiel 1900: pis. 49-51). The upper part of this late Aztec sculpture is covered with Teotihuacanoid reliefs of flowers, comparable with a flower-covered cylindrical sculpture from the site (fig. 32). The lower part has low relief carvings on both front and back representing the face of a non Teotihuacan deity (the same face is depicted twice). Like the archaizing Coyolxauhqui and cihuateotl, the Figure 29.

A cavity in the top reproduces the hole for a tenon that is part of such multipiece Teotihuacan sculptures. Pe?afiel apparently recognized this when he called the sculpture a column section. The Aztec piece may be imitating an unknown Teotihuacan prototype, or it could be the result of a conflation of Teotihuacan forms. The deity depicted would not have been part of the original. Finally, Nagao (1985a: 72-73) suggests that a greenstone vessel (Mus?e du Petit Palais 1981: no. 81), which archaeologists label as Teotihuacan, is actually a Mexica translation into precious greenstone of a Teotihuacan Thin Orange type of vessel, since no greenstone versions are known from Teotihuacan. As Nagao points out, this vessel was found with the stone copy of a plumbate vessel, both being translations into stone of ancient ceramic types, along with true antiques (Olmec, Teotihuacan, and Guerrero pieces). Although skeuomorphs (translations of forms from one medium to another) are common in Mexica art, these two vessels are the only archaizing stone copies of ceramic forms of which I am aware. Xochicalco71 The site of Xochicalco, south of the modern town of Cuernavaca in Morelos, had an eclectic art style. The motifs represented in its monumental reliefs point to connections with cultures in Veracruz, Oaxaca, and the Maya area. The most striking structure at the site, the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpents, is covered with reliefs of hieroglyphs, feathered serpents, and Maya looking personages (see fig. 38).72 A passage in the Florentine Codex indicates that the Aztecs called the site Xochicalco: There are large vestiges of the antiquities of this people as they nowadays appear in Tula, Tollantzinco, and a 71. For Xochicalco archaeology, see Saenz 1962, 1963a, 1963b, 1964; Hirth 1984. 72. I am not describing the layout of the site because there are no obvious correspondences to the plan of Tenochtitlan. Nor is there archaeological evidence of Mexica activity at the site (Michael E. Smith, personal communication). Although some of its structures suffered purposeful destruction, it is noteworthy that the reliefs on the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpents were left in place, in contrast to the stripping of pyramids at both Tula and Teotihuacan. Many of the reliefs were still visible at the time of Dupaix's visit in 1805 (1978: 127, pi. 31, fig. 33).</page><page sequence="30">Umberger: Antiques, revivals, and references to the past in Aztec art 91 structure called Xochicalco, which is near Quauhnauac [Cuernavaca].73 Sahag?n 1950-1982, introductory volume: 48 According to Jim?nez Moreno (1942: 129-136; 1959: 1072),74 Xochicalco was also in an area of quasi mythical importance, which the Aztecs referred to as Tamoanchan. From his study of written references to Tamoanchan, he deduced that there were at least two important Tamoanchans: a more distant and ancient place, which he located on the Gulf Coast, "sublimated in myth" by Aztec times, and an identifiable area relating to the more recent past and located near Aztec Cuauhnahuac (Histoyre du Mechique 1905: 27), an area which, as Jim?nez Moreno notes, is similar to the Gulf Coast in its semitropical environment.75 In addition, the Aztec period cities of Amaquemecan (Amecameca) and Chalco to the southeast of Tenochtitlan were both called Tamoanchan (Chimalpahin 1965: 34, in introduction by S. Rend?n; Davies 1980: 250), and there are evidences of artistic connections between Xochicalco and this area, seeming to date from Xochicalco times and perhaps later.76 So it appears that Tamoanchan, like Tollan, was a concept as well as the name of several historically identifiable (perhaps related) places. Another, often quoted passage in Sahag?n connects the invention of the calendar that was later to be used by the Aztecs with Tamoanchan: But four remained [at Tamoanchan] of the old men, the wise men: one named Oxomoco, one named Cipactonal, one named Tlaltetecui, one named Xochicauaca. And when the wise men had gone, then these four old men assembled. . . . Then they devised the book of days, the book of years, the count of the years, the book of dreams. They arranged the reckoning just as it has been kept. And thus was time recorded during all the time the Tolteca, the Tepaneca, the Mexica, and the Chichimeca reign endured. Sahag?n 1950-1982: bk. 10,19 Based on this passage and the location of Tamoanchan near Cuernavaca, Jim?nez Moreno suggested that the site of the invention of the calendar was Xochicalco. Indeed, according to Caso's (1967: 166-186) analysis of the inscriptions, the calendar used at Xochicalco was ancestral to the Aztec calendar, with the same year bearers and many of the same day signs. In fact, this is the earliest appearance of the Rabbit Reed-Flint-House year bearer system in Central Mexico. Supporting the evidence that the Aztecs considered this area the locus of the invention of their calendar, and also indicating that Xochicalco probably was the site of that event, is a rock carving (fig. 34) discovered near the site during the 1966-1967 archaeological season (Saenz 1967). It depicts a 1 Rabbit date (with a loop around the cartouche, designating it as a year bearer), Figure 34. Inscription on rock at Xochicalco, probably representing a fire drill in a piece of wood with a numeral one next to it and the dates 1 Rabbit and 2 Serpent below, Late Classic to Early Postclassic. After Saenz 1967: fig. 1. 73. The structure must be the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpents. Another probable reference to this pyramid is found in Alva Ixtlilxochitl's list of ruins of Toltec cities (1975-1977, 1: 272; Michael E. Smith, personal communication): "En Cuauhnahuac, otro palacio, con una ciudad que sol?a ser antigua, un palacio labrado todo de piedras grandes de piedra de canter?a sin lodo, ni mezcla, ni vigas, ni ninguna madera, sino unas piedras grandes pegadas unas a otras. . . ." 74. The following two paragraphs paraphrase and slightly expand Jim?nez Moreno's ideas. 75. Jim?nez Moreno also suggested that the references to a more distant, mythical Tamoanchan indicate that the ancient inhabitants of Xochicalco came from the Gulf Coast. 76. A Xochicalco-style relief representing a woman was found on the island of Xico in the southeastern Aztec area (Seler 1960 1961, 2: 159-160, fig. 69). Xico had a substantial occupation contemporary with Xochicalco. Another, very curious object is a large relief-covered block (later made into a container), which was given to the Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a by a Chalco family (Seler 1960-1961, 2: 161, fig. 70). In some ways it looks midway between Xochicalco and Aztec in style. The date glyphs, however, are definitely Xochicalco forms. See also Nicholson (1971: 120).</page><page sequence="31">92 RES 13 SPRING 87 a new fire symbol (drill, board, and flames), and a circular element signifying the numeral one. All of this Saenz interpreted as the commemoration of the first new fire in a 1 Rabbit year. There is no reason to believe that the inscription is not contemporary with the florescence of the site. Mexica objects in an archaizing Xochicalco style are few but significant. In the category of Mexica revivals is the cartouche around the dates on three fire serpent heads found in Mexico City (fig. 35). Here the date 2 Reed in late Mexica style has a Xochicalco style frame and Xochicalco numerals below, a bar (representing five) and three dots (compare with fig. 36). This is a purposeful archaism that can be linked to a specific date in Mexica times, 2 Reed (1507), the year of the last new fire and binding of years ceremonies initiating a new fifty-two-year cycle before the Conquest. According to the Codex Telleriano-Remensis (1899: f. 42r), the Mexica formerly "bound their years" in 1 Rabbit, but in 1506 Motecuhzoma II postponed the binding of the years until 2 Reed, the next year, because of repeated famines in 1 Rabbit years. Whether such a reform actually occurred in 1506 and the exact nature of the change are unknown (see Umberger, in press a, appendix). In any case, it can be said that the Mexica artist's use of the Xochicalco frame was meant to evoke that site because of its association with the calendar and the beginning of the fifty-two-year cycle, on the anniversary of that occasion. Caso (1967: 15) interpreted the numeral eight under the 2 Reed date on the xiuhcoatl heads as indicating the eighth new fire since the Mexica departure from Aztlan. It is more likely that the reference is to something that happened at Xochicalco?perhaps the first cycle beginning in the 1 Rabbit system. If there was a calendric change in 1506 making 2 Reed the more prominent year, perhaps the Mexica were creating these "antiques" to project the change into the past. Antique jade picture-plaques Another interesting object in the style of Xochicalco, a small jade plaque (fig. 37 and fig. 3) discovered in front of the Templo Mayor in 1900, raises special questions related to jade in Mesoamerica, survivals and revivals of types, and the interrelationship of figures in jade and in large-scale reliefs. The jade in question is a copy of the figures on the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpents at Xochicalco (fig. 38), which in turn look like copies of a Maya picture-plaque jade (fig. 39). The two Figure 35.

The profile version seems to have been originally derived from representations of rulers, which evolved in stone and stucco reliefs at Palenque (Proskouriakoff 1974: 13). In her study of jades found in the sacred well at Chichen Itza, Proskouriakoff suggested that these types were made and buried in the Late Classic Period, and then were excavated and offered in the cenote in the Early Postclassic. She considered the possibility of heirlooms less likely (for a contrasting view, see Coggins and Shane 1984: 66-68). It seems that Classic Maya jades like these also traveled to other parts of Mesoamerica, where they were deposited in later contexts. Maya jades of various types have been found in Oaxaca and Veracruz, near Teotihuacan,77 in Tenochtitlan (fig. 3, no. 6), and reportedly at Tolcayuca (Cossio 1942: fig. 16).78 Mexican versions of Maya types (fig. 40), usually with frontal figures in preference to profile figures, have been found at Monte Alban, Xochicalco, and Tula. I believe the Xochicalco-style plaque discovered in Mexico City to be a Mexica carving, although close to the original reliefs, because of the mittenlike hands, which are characteristic of the late Aztec style and not of the Xochicalco models. Jades found at Xochicalco (Saenz 1963: photo 9) are of frontal figures and do not relate in any respect to the reliefs on the pyramid, nor in carving style to the jade in question. The Xochicalco jades are carved with a grooving technique and the figures fill the entire space; the Mexico City jade has a cut-out background, like both Xochicalco and Mexica 77.

In addition, the use of a square frame and the misunderstanding of the details of the monster-maw headdress point to a later, probably Mexica, copy. The jade then is both a survival and a revival; it is a conscious revival of the figures on the Xochicalco pyramid, but at the same time a survival of the Maya type. Another question is whether the plaque was meant to evoke an antique jade. This is difficult to answer because it is closer to the figures on the pyramid than to any other existing jades. But were the Mexica aware that the figures on the pyramid were related to jade prototypes? Evidence of the wearing of jade picture-plaques is found on five Mexica stone sculptures (figs. 41, 42). These pendants represent a seated frontal figure, wearing a monster maw headdress and holding his hands at chest level. The sculptures include the three late-style chacmools, the Tlaloc in the pose of the Old Fire God, and a life-size seated jaguar warrior (Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a). Although prototypes for the depicted jades could have been of Maya, Oaxacan, or Central Mexican manufacture, the original was probably a Mexica version rather than a collected piece, judging especially from the shape of the frame, which is not found in older types. Although no actual Mexica jades like this have been found, I think they probably existed, given the jade carved after the Xochicalco model. The inclusion of picture-plaque jades on revivals of both Toltec and Teotihuacan sculptural types probably indicates that they were associated in Mexica thought with the "Toltecs" in the general sense. Just as the figures on Maya jades were made monumental on the Xochicalco pyramid, the figure from the jade plaques worn by Mexica sculptures was represented in an unusual rock carving at Acacingo (fig. 43; see Barlow 1946), where the figure indicates his relationship to jade pendants by framing with his hands the pendant on his own chest. A hole in the rock below the pendant and between the hands was for the insertion of a real piece of jade.

The rock commemorates the same calendrical happening as the dates on the fire serpent heads and is located in the general area that Jim?nez Moreno identified as Tamoanchan, the site of the invention of the calendar.7' Why the figure from the jade is depicted in connection with this event is not known. Ensembles of antiques and archaizing monuments Before the recent excavations, references to the past in Mexica art seemed to be eclectic and fragmentary. However, at the Templo Mayor two structures with ensembles from the Toltec and Teotihuacan pasts were revealed. Under the Platform of the Eagles are the rooms with Toltec-style procession reliefs and ceramic urns. There was also an almost life-size ceramic figure dressed in the fitted costume of an eagle warrior (Nicholson with Keber 1983: fig. p. 84). The Aztec warrior cult centered around several groups, the most prominent of which were the eagle and jaguar warriors, who fought for the sake of the sun. The eagle itself was a symbol of the sun, and the jaguar represented darkness. Eagles with hearts, jaguars, and coyotes depicted in reliefs at the site of Tula have been interpreted as the symbols of similar warrior groups. In archaizing Xochicalco type frames refer primarily to calendrical matters. And this count of days ? so was it claimed ? was an invention of the two called and named Oxomoco and Cipactonal. . . . They who were readers of day signs embellished their book of days with their representations. Sahag?n 1950-1982: bk. 4, 4 Thus two Aztec rock carvings in the Xochicalco area (the one at Acacingo definitely Mexica) and three fire serpent heads with 79. Jim?nez Moreno (1942: 135) suggested that another group of Aztec-period rock carvings at Coatlan near Cuernavaca (Krickeberg 1969: 95-109, pis. 58-60) relates to the passage in Sahag?n about the calendrical reform in Tamoanchan. Represented are two of the characters mentioned, Cipactonal and Oxomoco, as they are depicted in the Codex Borbonicus (1974: 21). Another passage in Sahag?n underlines their connection with the calendar:</page><page sequence="35">96 RES 13 SPRING 87 addition, the central focus of the bench reliefs was the zacatapayolli associated with bloodletting, a practice invented by Quetzalcoatl (see Klein, in press). So to create this warrior-related ensemble in Tenochtitlan, the Mexica looked to Tula. Across the courtyard is the Teotihuacan-style painted platform, behind which was found the Tlaloc in the form of the Old Fire Cod. Both have water imagery and perhaps were part of an ensemble.80 Other sculptures found together may have formed similar archaizing groups. The five "Toltec" warrior figures were found with reliefs of eagles and jaguars, which unfortunately have not been published (Moedano K?er 1944: 56; Noriega 1944; Mateos Higuera 1979: 213-214).81 The three fire serpent heads with Xochicalco-style cartouches may also have decorated a structure. Although no building with Xochicalco imagery has been found, Sahag?n (1950-1982: bk. 2, 2d ed. revised, 191) mentions a Xochicalco temple in his list of sacred structures in Tenochtitlan. It is well known that the center of Tenochtitlan recreated a mythic landscape, with the Templo Mayor at the center representing the hill of Coatepec where Huitzilopochtli was born as the sun. The precinct was the setting of ceremonial recreation of myths, for instance, the Panquetzaliztli ceremony, which reenacted Huitzilopochtli's defeat of his enemy brothers soon after his birth (Le?n-Portilla 1981: 82, 84). The archaizing structures referring to the sacred cities nearby, the sites of legendary and mythic events, probably were meant to contribute to this setting. Whether they formed a more coherent pattern in the plan of Tenochtitlan is not known. The layout of some elements of the city seems to have been a combination of several ancient cities, with its four-part plan and west-facing pyramid, like Teotihuacan (possibly even the double shrines), and its east-to-west alignment of pyramid, adoratorio, skull rack, and ball court, like Tula.82 There is a smaller ensemble on Tetzcotzingo (fig. 44), a sacred mountain with a complex of temples and other structures in the pleasure garden of the rulers of nearby Tetzcoco, which was created between 1454 and 1467 (Anales de Cuauhtitlan 1975: 52). Relevant to the subject of this paper are three pools of water along the walkway around the hill, which are identified as representing different capital cities by the chronicler Alva Ixtlilxochitl (1975-1977, 2: 114-116). The pool on the south side represented Tenayuca, an older city on the north shore of Lake Tetzcoco, which was ruled by the Chichimec ancestors of the kings of Tetzcoco. The remains of the pool feature a stepped wall, the hieroglyphic symbol of Tenayuca. On the west end of the pathway a larger pool, according to the chronicler, had three frogs around it representing the Aztec Triple Alliance cities of Tetzcoco, Tenochtitlan, and Tlacopan (one frog remains). On the north side of the hill the pool mentioned as representing Tollan must correspond to a small pool with what appears to be a temple front behind it (the stairs and one alfarda remain), probably the emblem of the city. Here the Tetzcocans refer to both their Chichimec and Toltec pasts in an architectural ensemble.83 The Mexica as archaeologists and inheritors of the Mesoamerican past There are many types of archaisms, and motivating factors vary greatly. In her seminal article on Andean antiquarianism, Menzel (1960) contrasts two types discernible from studies of tomb ceramics in the lea 82. I wonder if the association of the archaizing greenstone death figure with the small platform in front of the Templo Mayor could have been meant to recall the Mictlantecuhtli platform in front of the pyramid at Teotihuacan, which I have hypothesized was possibly associated with the model for the Mexica sculpture (this is speculative, as we do not know the original location of the Teotihuacan sculpture). 83. They may be linking themselves and their allies more closely to Tenayuca than to Tula. A canal running from east to west along the south side of the hill joins the Tenayuca and Aztec pools; the Tula pool is not part of the system. However, this could actually be a matter of geography; Tenayuca and the Triple Alliance cities are around the lake, while Tula is far to the north. 80. Eduardo Matos (letter, April 22, 1986) says that the sculpture was found close to the Red Temple in fill corresponding to Phase VI; he believes they could have been associated. 81. Some of the eagle and jaguar reliefs may be those published by Solis (1976: 26, nos. 60-62); others may be canine reliefs at the Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a. The idea of feline/canine reliefs and eagle reliefs presumably for setting into a wall dates back to Toltec times, but the Mexica versions are not close enough to the prototypes on Mound B at Tula to be considered copies. The top of a beautifully carved "stela" (which is actually almost in-the-round) was found at the same site. Representing a face emerging from a monster maw feathered headdress, it may have been a copy of a Xochicalco type of stela, as suggested by Moedano K?er (1944: 57). The only one known represents a female figure. See Nicholson 1961 : fig. 1, for an illustration of the Mexica sculpture; see Seler 1960-1961, 2: 157, fig. 64, for an illustration of the Xochicalco stela. The lack of the lower part of the sculpture makes it difficult to decide if it is an archaizing piece, or even whether it represents a female (as suggested by Nicholson 1961) or a male.</page><page sequence="36">Umberger: Antiques, revivals, and references to the past in Aztec art 97 Valley of Peru. The first type involved the collection and imitation of certain styles of several hundred years earlier, a form of archaizing popular during the Inca occupation of the valley. In contrast, after the end of Inca domination there was a wholesale revival of the local ceramic style of sixty years earlier and rejection of the Inca ceramic types that had replaced them. Menzel does not discuss the problem of changes in meaning, but there is a contrast in this respect, too. The later revival brought back elements within memory from the lea people's own culture, and the forms and iconography were probably for the most part understood. The earlier revivals, on the other hand, were of forms out of memory and pertaining archaeologically to different cultural configurations. What did these forms mean to the later people, why were they revived, and how were they understood? This is not known in the case of the lea Valley. For the Inca in Cuzco, however, written evidence and archaizing objects look back to Tiahuanaco, a revered ancient city, which played a part in myth as the place of origin of their royal line and institutions (Tom Cummins, dissertation in progress). In Mesoamerica, the specific motivations behind most evidences of pre-Mexica antiquarianism remain obscure. There are a few exceptions, all jades, where context or inscriptions give a clue to the general intention. Evidence at Teotihuacan and in the Maya area indicate that both cultures were aware of Olmec jades as representative of a distinct style. One jade, on which was commemorated an early Maya king's accession, was used for dynastic validation through continuity with the past. In Teotihuacan murals, the jades pour from hands in streams of water, indicating the same associations as in Aztec times. The explicit depiction of Olmec jades indicates that their antiquity also had significance. The wearing of Olmec pectorals by the losing warriors in the Cacaxtla and Bonampak murals is interesting, especially considering the later depiction of antique jades, derived from Maya types, on Mexica sculptures. In both cases the exact significance is unknown. The Mexica accumulated objects from a number of ancient cultures, and they were aware of the cultures of origin, even of works in styles that they did not imitate. They probably knew the specific sources of the Guerrero and Mixtee pieces, which most likely came as loot, tribute, or gifts from conquered areas. In fact, the Mexica knew more about their origins than we do (few have been found in context). In the case of Olmec and Maya jades and greenstone objects, from cultures more distant in time and space, the evidence so far does not indicate their identification by the Mexica with particular cultural configurations. Although the Maya area was outside the empire, Maya jades could be found in Central Mexico, albeit not in great numbers. Whether the Mexica saw any originals besides a few like the small head illustrated (fig. 3) is unknown. However, they were familiar with and copied Central Mexican imitations of Maya jades, which they would have seen in jade copies and in large stone reliefs. They seem to have associated such jades with the "Toltecs" in the general sense, and not a particular style. The Olmec "heartland" likewise was outside the Toi Ian Triple Alliance Cities Tenayuca Figure 44. Plan of Tetzcotzingo. After Parsons 1971: 124, fig. 24 (modified).</page><page sequence="37">98 RES 13 SPRING 87 empire, but there was a significant Olmec presence in Central Mexico and Guerrero (for instance, at Chalcatzingo and Teopantecuanitlan [see Crossley 1986]). Olmec jades were also buried in graves in Guerrero, the source of so many other greenstone objects in Tenochtitlan. Thus the Mexica could have been exposed to enough Olmec objects to recognize them as a distinctive style associated with particular sites. The ideas behind the burial of so many ancient and foreign objects in the Templo Mayor are still unclear. These objects probably signify to some extent Mexica appropriation from different parts of the empire of sacred offerings associated with the past or ancestors ? which in some way validated their imperial claims. The styles of Tula, Teotihuacan, and Xochicalco were associated with three ancient cities with particular associations. These cities had the same place in Mexica historical thought that a single city had for the Incas. They were considered places of dynastic, institutional, cultural, and cosmic beginnings. Their veneration and specific associations were pre-Mexica, and presumably the sites were not used by them exclusively in late times. For example, although Teotihuacan was used by the Mexica for ceremonies, it was actually in the jurisdiction of Tetzcoco, and the 1480 relaci?n indicates that it was used by the people of neighboring towns. The Mexica, however, were appropriating the ancient authority of these cities for their own purposes through their manipulation of art forms. Late-period knowledge of all three cities was based on legends, combined with oral traditions of local inhabitants nearby, who were familiar with the actual remains. Unfortunately, we have "local" reports only for the Aztec-period functions of the remains at Teotihuacan. In contrast are the vaguer descriptions and mythological accounts of events at all three sites, which reflect a distant view and show more concern for the place of the city in Aztec thought than for its actual appearance. At this point it is very difficult to evaluate the specific naming of areas and sculptures at Teotihuacan. How much reflects the original situation at that city and how much was the invention of later Toltec and Aztec people? One would suppose, as Mill?n does, that the Teotihuacanos did claim to have founded their city at the site of the birthplace of the sun, and that the naming of the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon relates to their original associations, although their symbolic elaboration in Teotihuacan times would have been much more complicated. Likewise, Xochicalco was associated with the beginning of the calendar that the Mexica used and probably was the site of that invention. More problematical is the identification of sculptures at the sites with deity names, for instance, the lost sculpture of Tonacatecuhtli, a god whose Mexica appearance is not easily identified (see Nagao 1985b), not to mention his Teotihuacan appearance. Was Tonacatecuhtli a Teotihuacan deity, and was the sculpture a Teotihuacan ?mage, which kept its original identity? Could a major deity image survive the holocaust of the final destruction of Teotihuacan? It seems unlikely. The Tlatelolcans identified a sculpture collected from Tula as the deity Tlacahuepan, who was closely associated with both the fall of Quetzalcoatl and the birth/rise of Huitzilopochtli (see n. 29). Given the political implications, the identification of this god with a Toltec sculpture should probably not be taken seriously. In addition, since the Mexica usually changed the identity of figures in their imitations of ancient forms, the continued association of deities with particular formal types cannot be assumed. Sometimes they used the same form for different deities (for instance, the archaizing Teotihuacan death goddesses and the man and serpent motif), and sometimes different forms for the same deity (for instance, Tlaloc in the form of a chacmool and the Teotihuacan Old Fire God). The Mexica's earliest imitations derived from the art of a group with which there was much cultural continuity (if not total ethnic identity), although there was a time gap of perhaps 150 years between the fall of Tula and the founding of Tenochtitlan. It is thus probable that many Toltec objects were understood. The history of Aztec relations with Toltec art is long and complex. Mexica copies are in both early and late styles and developed out of an earlier widespread tradition of imitation by various Central Mexican groups. Some are derived from intermediate productions rather than being direct copies of Toltec objects. In fact, it is interesting that even in the late . period when the Mexica were obviously studying ancient objects at first hand (as is apparent in the case of the orange vases, the Teotihuacanoid Tlaloc, and the Xochicalcoid cartouche), they seemed to prefer to use as a model their own last version of a form rather than returning to an original. This is especially apparent in the late chacmools. On the other hand, details may reveal new observations of antiques, for instance, in the depiction of jade pendants. The early Aztec chacmools</page><page sequence="38">Umberger: Antiques, revivals, and references to the past in Aztec art 99 were survivals of Toltec forms and were vague reflections of the originals, whereas the Mexica versions (even the earliest) sharpen the image and make it more specific with details of both archaizing and contemporary significance. Imitations of Xochicalco and Teotihuacan works appear relatively late, probably after 1480; known examples are only in the late fifteenth- to early sixteenth-century style and were made after a gap of at least five hundred years for Xochicalco and seven hundred years for Teotihuacan, with no direct cultural continuity. It is probable that Teotihuacan- and Xochicalco-type objects continued after the fall of those polities, and it is possible that there were early Aztec imitations, but no certain examples can be identified.84 All Mexica imitations seem to be direct revivals from ancient objects, presumably studied at or collected from those sites. In the case of most archaisms, we have a general sense of the motivation behind the choice of style and forms; the connections are often very straightforward, as in the rooms of Toltec-derived works used by warrior groups. There are several examples, however, which served a commemorative purpose and can be linked to specific events. These were inscribed with or associated archaeologically with hieroglyphic dates (the orange vessels, the Malinche reliefs at Tula, the Teotihuacanoid Tlaloc, the fire serpents with Xochicalcoid frames, and the Acacingo relief). In such monuments a tighter fit can be made between imagery and historical circumstances. The Malinche reliefs at Tula, for example, were made on the occasion of a ceremony to stop a flood, and the connection with Tula and Toltec forms can be seen as a circumstance of history. The flood started in a year associated with Quetzalcoatl. In conclusion, it is obvious that the Mexica knew a lot about the art and cities of their predecessors; that they inherited many forms, ideas, and conceptual structures from the past; that they were sometimes aware of the sources; and that they linked material remains to oral traditions. However, it is equally obvious that their visual knowledge was based on firsthand observations, and that they modified forms for their own purposes. Even if they had some awareness of the original context and associations of an object, what was most important for them was the purpose behind their reuse of the object or motif. In Mesoamerica, the physical remains of an ancient culture and oral traditions about it had separate histories. While the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon, the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpents, and various structures at Tula remained visible, many objects went out of view (literally or figuratively) and were not the focus of attention until late Preconquest times, when they were again studied by Mexica "archaeologists."
