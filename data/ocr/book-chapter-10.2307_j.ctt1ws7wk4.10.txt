<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter 4 ECOLOGIES OF NEARNESS   Touch ramifi es and shapes accountability. Accountability, caring for,  being aff ected, and entering into responsibility are not ethical abstractions;  these mundane, prosaic things are the result of having truck with each  other. ... Touch, regard, looking back, becoming with—all these make  us responsible in unpredictable ways for which worlds take shape. ...  Touch and regard have consequences. —Donna Haraway, When Species Meet Introduction Th e question of propriety in interspecies nearness pervades ecotourism dis- course: How close should we get to animals? How close can we get to nature?  How close are we already? Th is chapter examines tourist and volunteer activ- ities designed to facilitate human nearness to a diversity of marine life to ask  how interspecies aff ective relationships are cultivated through the slippery  phenomenological moments we sometimes call “experience.” Sometimes the  quest for remarkable experiences entails traveling great distances: Much like  humpback whales, tourists from the north migrate south to warmer climes  in December and January. Th e opportunity to watch whales breeding in  their natural environment is a seasonal delight available to any ecotourist  with seeing eyes and access to Dramamine. Swimming with dolphins, while  controversial, gets us even closer because we can watch, touch, feel, and even  kiss them, all from the comfort of a human-scale swimming pool. Coral  transplanting, on the other hand, is a much more involved activity that takes  us out of our terrestrial habitat and plunges us into theirs. Th e practice is  meant to attract the “ethical tourist,” someone who volunteers (and in many  cases pays) for the chance to see and touch coral, to transplant new life, and  to learn the realities of coral degradation by getting up close and person- alizing reefs. 79 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

As I discussed in Chapter 3, for humans getting close and “be- ing there” (Geertz 1988) entails a psychological, aff ective, sometimes even  spiritual engagement with other life forms. Nature-based tours gain mean- ing through the anthropomorphism of animals, and by off ering interspe- cies contact predicated on the delicate negotiation of looking, feeling, and  touching for experience. Proximities of Nearness In 1998, a group of visitors to Okinawa climbed and clustered around a  giant looking glass tree (an evergreen mangrove with an umbrella-shaped  crown and above-ground roots that radiate from its base like wooden rib- bons). Tourists wrapped themselves around the tree, leaning up against it  and feeling its bark with their bare hands. In 2004, a diff erent group stood  near the same tree but were unable to touch it. A small fence had been built  around this “arboreal monument” (Ogden 2011: 108) to protect the tree  from the thousands of tourists who encircle it every year. Professor Arasaki  opened his lecture on ecotourism by comparing photographs of these visits  to illustrate how restrictions on tourist access to Okinawa’s natural beauty  were tightening as the number of annual visitors rose. Next, Arasaki showed a promotional video about ecotourism in Higashi to  a room full of JICA Sustainable Tourism trainees. Th e fi lm centered on Keiko,  a Nature interpreter who, like many of the guides I met during fi eldwork,  had transplanted herself from mainland Japan to pursue a more meaningful,  “grounded” career. Followed by the camera, she guides two young girls on a  rather tame kayaking trip down the Gesashi River. Upon noticing that the  girls aren’t having much fun, Keiko paddles closer to the shoreline and shows  them how to lean back in their kayaks and glide underneath the mangroves,  leaving only a few inches between their faces and a maze of twisting brown  roots. Soon the girls are giggling and squealing with delight, as intended. I was once that bored customer, paddling aimlessly down the river until  our guide directed us toward a mangrove and invited us to taste its salty  leaves. Upon closer examination, I could actually see the leaf ’s color grada- tion change from green to yellow, indicating how far up the saltwater had  been absorbed. It was the taste of the salt that fi nally alerted my senses and  drew me into the tour experience.  You just read an anecdote describing a lecture that contained photographs  of trees and a fi lmed clip of an Okinawan ecotour guide trying to bring  her customers closer to nature. Did you feel anything? What was your ex- perience of mine? Surely the jarring impropriety of a “close-up” paragraph  80 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

How close is too close?  How close is close enough? Experience Near (But Not Too Near) How do you convince someone that she is aff ected  by something if she can’t feel it? How do you teach her how to feel it? —Dr. Karen Magik, coral activist When we watch the whales in action, we are very moved or excited. —Zamami Whale Watching Association, English-language brochure When I met with Karen Magik at the Churaumi Aquarium, one of the fi rst  things she said to me was, “I think the key [to education] is through expe- rience. People don’t care [about an issue] until it aff ects them.” She spoke  broadly about public awareness of the many environmental issues faced by  Okinawa: red soil run-off  and erosion, ocean pollution, and the loss of bio- diversity. Her question about how to “feel” a problem rather than simply  studying it or noticing it left me pondering the “world’s largest” circular pane  of curved glass that separates visitors from the enormous whale shark ( jinbei- zame) and manta rays on display at the aquarium. Th e glass was designed to  enable spectators to get closer to the animals, and to simulate the experience  of aquatic immersion by providing them with panoramic views from above  and below. Of course we could not touch them, but were we close enough  to feel them? According to marine tourism specialist Carl Cater, no. Cater suggests that  the experientially oriented “new tourist” (see also Krippendorf 1987 and  Poon 1993) seeks a particular form of intimacy premised on the anthropo- morphosis of certain animals both on and “in our own terms” (Cater 2010:  135). We emphasize the maternal relationship between dolphins and their  calves, for example, seeking a sort of mammalian kinship. We want to get  closer: psychologically, emotionally, and physically, as we try to understand  animals. Despite our substantial diff erences, charismatic megafauna be- come “constructed as ‘near’ to us, while those we know little about [are con- structed] as the ‘others.’” One of these “others” is coral, a species most of us  would struggle to relate to, save for appreciating their natural beauty. Our  non-human “others” need not be alien to our everyday life, however the  educational experiences aff orded by marine aquariums and other sea life in- 81 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

How do we establish interspecies closeness in the twenty-fi rst century?  For many travelers, sightseeing—seeing sights, seeing the sea—is no longer  enough. Tourists are increasingly doing things “with their own bodies, with  embodied objectives such as fi tness, thrill, spirituality, risk, sensual connec- tion, sexuality, taste, inscription and fl ow” (Franklin 2003: 213). As ecotour- ists, “sharing a breath with a whale from an observation boat, hearing dolphins  communicating underwater while diving, or feeling the warmth in one’s arms  after kayaking” (Cater 2010: 138) allows us to feel these experiences.1 Watching Whales Watching Us In Okinawa, there are at least three ways to feel a cetacean: you can watch  one, you can play with one, and you can eat one. Perplexed by the merits  of Dolphin Th erapy and ambivalent about dining on Flipper (I discuss this  moral quandary later), at fi rst I opted to simply watch. On a frigid (for Oki- nawa) Tuesday morning in late January 2011, I joined program coordinators  from the Okinawa International Center, Okinawa Environment Club staff ,  and JICA CARICOM trainees at Tomari Wharf in Naha. We popped our  motion sickness pills and boarded a giant ferry headed for Zamami Island,  part of the beautiful Kerama Archipelago about 30 km west of Okinawa  Island. Our guide met us at Zamami Port and ushered us into their wel- come center. “Momo,” a very energetic and sprightly woman in her forties  nicknamed for a peach, spoke good English but relied on Weasel2 (the offi  - cial JICA interpreter) to explain the remarkable anatomy of the humpback  whales (zatō kujira) we were about to see. She held up a stuff ed whale toy  to illustrate diff erent physical characteristics. Males and females, I learned,  are the same size so one has to locate their sex organs to determine which is  which (no small task). Unaware of the rhythmic nature of whale watching, I had always assumed  that any sightings were fairly sporadic if not altogether random. I asked  Momo how often they fail to see any whales, and she replied that only once  in her ten-year career had they missed the whales entirely. Th ey have spotters  who watch for familiar whales, who are often annual visitors, and the short  boat ride out into the bay is canceled if the whales do not show up on any  given morning during the late winter/early spring breeding period. Once  the tour group is out in the water, it is fairly easy to predict when—though  not where—the humpbacks will emerge. Whale breathing is periodic, and  though they can cover quite a lot of territory in the interim, each individual  resurfaces every seven, eight, nine or even twelve minutes to take another  82 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="5"> Ecologies of Nearness breath. To improve our odds of sighting them each time, we divided our boat  into quadrants. Half of us stood on one side, half on the other, and as we  looked out across the water we shouted, “Twelve o’clock!” or “Five o’clock!”  and so on to indicate which direction the others should turn. Most of the JICA participants were eagerly snapping their cameras in all  directions, trying to capture any part of a whale’s breach, the stunning pose  where they rise up on their backs and then slam back down into the water.  Capturing the experience on fi lm, as opposed to merely watching the whales,  appeared central to this experience. For most of this group, the most reward- ing and entertaining activity was to capture images of the whales digitally— for immediate sharing with friends, family, and (eventually) for posterity. I  found the process of searching for the whales through a camera lens, while  balancing on a rocking boat, dizzying and disorienting. I decided just to  take in the three solo whales and one pair with my naked eyes, and hoped to  remember what I saw. Each whale that comes to Zamami is assigned a number and given a  nickname based on the diff erent patterns and markings on its fl ukes. Each  tail has a unique combination of gray and black patterning with splotches  of white, and watching for them was like taking a prehistoric Rorschach test  writ large: one individual fl ashed the pattern of a butterfl y, another a fl eur  de lis. “Th e Mayor,” so named for the regularity of his visits to the same spot  over many years, gave us multiple splashing encores. We returned to the Welcome Center, our freezing bodies and faces warmed  only by windburn, and the Director of the Zamami Whale Watching As- sociation greeted us and gave a short lecture on the activities of Zamami  tourism as we thawed. I asked about the most evocative or emotive experi- ence tourists report from their visits, and without hesitating he replied that  mother-calf sightings never fail to astound whale watchers. He qualifi ed this  statement by adding that it is now illegal to follow these precious pairs be- cause the calves tend to get overly curious about the vessels and often come  too close, wanting to play. “It is considered stressful and disruptive, and  potentially dangerous for the baby whales that risk getting caught in the  engine,” he explained. He said that just seeing the whales breach is enough  to bring some people to tears, but the most exciting moments are when the  adults come very near the boat, occasionally even swimming underneath it. “How to watch whales watching the boat.” Th is loosely translated head- ing from the English-language Zamami tourist orientation pamphlet I was  handed invites watchers to ponder what Jennifer Wolch and Jody Emel (1998)  call the “ultimate animal question”—Who’s doing the watching? (quoted in  Cater 2010: 144, my emphasis). Whales swimming toward the boat pro- duced a sudden and thrilling nearness—an exhilarating reminder that per- haps we were being watched, too. Th e whales also wanted to get closer. 83 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

I tracked down Dr. Nakasone, a diminutive middle- aged man sporting spiked black hair and a white lab coat. He directs the  dolphin therapy program at Wellness Village Motobu (Motobu Genki Mura)  in northern Okinawa. Th e Wellness Village off ers a variety of dolphin ex- periences to accommodate a range of time frames and budgets. Activities  range from the fi fty-minute Training Workshop, where tourists pay ¥3,000  ($35) to watch dolphin trainers do their job, to the fi fty-minute Dolphin  School, where for ¥6,500 ($75) customers can kiss a dolphin and feed it  vitamin-laced fi sh. After perusing the list of off erings, however, I still was not sure how this  qualifi ed as “therapy.” Noting my confusion, Professor Nakasone explained  that two other programs off ered: one is the experience (taiken) program; the  other is intentionally therapeutic. When I asked him about the salient dif- ference between the two, he smiled and explained that, in fact, “Th e content  is completely identical.” Rather, it is the outcome that varies: “Th ose in the  Experience course might go home and say, ‘Th at was fun!’ while those in the  formal Dolphin Th erapy Program might say ‘Th at was fun and my heart has  grown lighter.’” “In either case,” he continued, “you are only spending 1–2 hours per  day with the dolphins, trainer, and psychologist.” (Only the therapy course  involves a psychologist.) Th e most important diff erence between the two  programs is goal setting: Th ose who choose Experience do not associate their  experience with a strategic healing objective, while those opting for Th er- apy do. Participants’ therapeutic objectives are formally outlined and docu- mented before, during, and after the program. Th e dolphin therapy program is also lengthier than the experience course.  It lasts fi ve days and costs roughly ¥400,000 ($4,700). I was still unclear; if  the content of both programs was the same, then what did Dr. Nakasone  mean by “therapy”? His grin widened as he explained that simply being with  the dolphins and communicating with them can be therapeutic for autistic  and depressed children, and for adults who suff er from mental illness (men- taruteki na byōki).3 He produced an elaborate photo album documenting the  program. I grew a bit teary-eyed when he turned to the image of a small boy  who was recovering from the psychological trauma of a car accident. He was  petting a dolphin and then coaxing it to jump over a white-and-red stick that  he held out over the side of the tank. Th e somewhat arbitrary categorical distinction between “therapy” and  “experience” became clearer to me when he compared dolphin therapy to  horse therapy: “It’s just riding horses, you know.” Dr. Nakasone gestured  84 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="7"> Ecologies of Nearness playfully like he was taking the pulse and temperature of a dolphin, and then  a horse. Or perhaps he was mimicking a dolphin or horse trying to take his  temperature? I could not quite tell. “You can’t do this,” he smiled. “You can’t  do this kind of [medicalized] therapy with the animals.” He was making  light of the directional ambiguity of the phrase “dolphin therapy.” I asked,  “What makes this health tourism?,” still stuck on the hybrid travel category  he had outlined earlier. “Most participants come from outside Okinawa  Prefecture and stay at local hotels for the week. Th at’s why we tack on [call  it] ‘Tourism.’ And once the therapy [session] is over they are free.” Adult  participants are released to do other sightseeing activities for the rest of the  day. I opted for the “Dolphin Adventure” course, settling on a sort of discount  therapy where, for ninety minutes and ¥13,000 ($150), I could experience  all of the above as well as the opportunity to be ferried (or, in some cases,  dragged) by a docile dolphin across an enclosed swimming tank. At the  Wellness Village, a friend and I joined a family of four visiting from the  Tokyo area. We changed into the wetsuits and rubber slippers provided and  then sat baking in the sun like sea lions as we waited for the program to  begin. Th e thick suits seemed rather cumbersome and unnecessary given the  sunny weather in late February. Th is marine outfi tting was a required feature  of the Experience. Our twenty-something guide, who introduced herself as Kokoro (“Heart”  or “Spirit”) began the tour by giving us a cursory introduction to small Oki- nawan sea life. She led us into an artifi cial wading pool and taught us how to  tell the diff erence between a sea cucumber’s bottom and its mouth. I found  myself feeling underwhelmed, but the eight-year-old girl standing next to  me was clearly both disgusted and delighted by the prospect of touching the  slimy black, sand-fi ltering loaf. Kokoro introduced us to a few small banana fi sh (Gurukun)—popular  bright blue and yellow animals that turn a pinkish red when deep fried and  are a staple of the northern Okinawan diet—and a few large Deigo trees. She  then led us into a lecture room where she pulled out a large colorful chart  of “Cetaceans of the World” found in Okinawa. Kokoro held up a small  rubber dolphin and challenged us to point out which species we were about  to meet. Bottlenose (Bandō iruka) was correct: “Seikai!” she exclaimed, clap- ping excitedly for the little girl. I stupidly asked where the whale sharks were  on the family web, to which Kokoro kindly replied that the animals that had  mesmerized me at the aquarium were, in fact, sharks (not whales). Th ere was  no applause. My heart sank as Kokoro enthusiastically explained that all of the dol- phins housed at the Wellness Center are transplants from Taiji, Japan. My  ears immediately fogged over, and I could hardly hear to her explanation  85 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="8"> Footprints in Paradise of how the dolphins are carefully selected, then wrapped up and shipped  south via airplane and boat in what to me resembled crude coffi  ns. Having  watched the movie Th e Cove the year before, I was devastated by this revela- tion. I felt immediately complicit and profoundly ignorant for failing to ask  in advance one of the most basic questions: “Where do the dolphins come  from?” I lived just a few miles down the road in Nago, where drivers entering  the city are greeted with a giant gray marble sculpture of a bottlenose dol- phin that reads “Welcome to the Safe Dolphin Village.” I had just assumed  that the animals were captured locally. I debated whether I should quit this  Experience early and ask for a partial refund, but I did not want to alienate  or off end my hospitable informants. I stared at the colorful photographs of  shrink-wrapped dolphins being sloshed about by large cranes, and felt a little  too guilty a little too late. Kokoro called for me to join the others as they  headed toward the dolphin tanks, and I followed. Kokoro introduced the dolphins individually, calling them forward to tell  us their names and asking us to remember them because “each one is diff er- ent.” First we stuff ed vitamins into dead fi sh and fed them to the dolphins.  Th ey did a variety of tricks, each time rewarded with another fi sh and ample  praise. Th ey fetched and bounced balls with their noses, leapt over my out- stretched candy cane pole, and clapped their dorsal fi ns as if mirroring our  loud applause. One even surfaced to give me a kiss on the lips, a behavior  naturalized in many dolphin depictions across Motobu (see Figure 4.1). Th e  whole time we were with them I felt anxious and confused about what I was  doing with (to?) these highly intelligent cetaceans. Th e only activity during which I was able to temporarily forget my own  quandary, and lose my self-consciousness was the swim. Kei-chan swam up  to the edge of the tank and waited for me like a fl oating taxi. I was elated  when I successfully latched on to her dorsal fi n by clasping my right hand  over my left, and she shot across the pool with me on her back. Th e little girl  in our group needed a lot of coaxing and encouragement, but on her fourth  try she grabbed onto Kei-chan and away they went. We emerged from the  water and began to towel down. I wrestled with my petite wetsuit, and my  conscience. Was there any sense in which this was not cruel? Dolphins are  trained through positive reinforcement and motivated by praise and love,  just as humans are, we were told. Swimming with dolphins has been correlated with the relief of depres- sion, but the mammals’ “healing properties” (Antonioli and Reveley 2005:  1233; Frumkin 2001) may derive from the aff ective boost that humans gain  through this unusual sensorial interaction. Marino and Lilienfeld (2007:  243) hypothesize that the therapeutic benefi ts are attributable less to the  presence of the dolphins themselves than to factors such as the size and touch  of the animal, and the opportunity for human interaction with them.

Curiosity about these kinds of alternative healing programs drew  me to researching dolphin therapy, and I would have been content to pursue  only the human perspective on such encounters had Th e Cove not suggested  that the dolphins might be depressed, too. Changing Perspectives: A Tale of Two Films Our sentimentality toward animals is a sure sign of the disdain in which we  hold them. It is proportional to this disdain. It is in proportion to being rele- gated to irresponsibility, to the inhuman, that the animal becomes worthy of the  human ritual of aff ection and protection ... [Ecological] sentimentality is noth- ing but the infi nitely degraded form of bestiality ... in which we ridiculously  cloak animals to the point of rendering them sentimental themselves. —Jean Baudrillard (1994: 134) Th e Cove Th e Cove (2009) is a highly politicized documentary produced by the Oce- anic Preservation Society and starring Rick O’Barry, the world-famous dol- 87 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

Th e fi lm won the 2010 Academy Award for Best  Documentary Feature for its controversial exposé of dolphin slaughters in  the mainland town of Taiji, Wakayama Prefecture. Images of Taiji resem- ble images of Nago: both towns are chock full of dolphin motifs painted  on signs, woven into fences, grown into elaborate fl ower formations, and  prominently displayed in statue form (see Figure 4.1). Unaware of Nago’s  history of dolphin hunting when I fi rst arrived, I assumed that the many  colorful, caricatured images of dolphins I saw were a celebration of a local  animal tourist attraction and an advertisement for the Churaumi Aquarium.  My initial impression of Nago matched Rick O’Barry’s in Taiji: “You would  think this is a town that really loves whales and dolphins.” Toward the beginning of the fi lm, O’Barry declares that human beings  are entering a new era of human-animal relations: “It’s all about respect now,  not exploitation.” One of his primary objections to dolphinariums is that the  dolphin’s quality of “self-awareness” makes them unfi t for captivity. In con- trast, Japan’s International Whaling Commisson (IWC) representative Jōji  Marushita (who quickly becomes the fi lm’s scapegoat) is quoted as saying:  “We have never heard a convincing reason why this species is so special.” Put  another way by the Taiji fi shermen: “You eat cows. We eat dolphins.” Th is is  precisely the same rationale I heard from the trainer Kokoro at the Wellness  Village when I asked her how she felt about the fi lm. O’Barry became internationally famous for his work training lead dol- phins for the popular 1970s US television show Flipper. O’Barry tells the  story of how Cathy (one of a few dolphins that played Flipper during the  course of the show) “committed suicide” in front of him when she stopped  breathing. (Unlike human beings, he explains, dolphins are conscious  breathers and can choose to stop at any point). He attributes this act to her  unhappiness and suff ering while in captivity. At one point the fi lm attempts to shift perspectives from human to dol- phin by pointing out the inadequacy of using a variation of sign language  to communicate with dolphins (who have no hands). One trainer asks, “We  can teach them, but what about what they can give to us?” O’Barry even implies that in some senses the dolphins possess greater  (self-)awareness than the fi shermen: “It’s not about intelligence, it’s about  consciousness. Th ey are self-aware, like humans are self-aware. I don’t believe  that the fi shermen here are aware of that.”4 Questions of animal agency and self-awareness (not merely “Who’s doing  the looking?” but also “Can they suff er?”) have been explored across time,  geography, and disciplines. Philosopher Jacques Derrida, in a treatise critiqu- ing the Cartesian distinction between “thinking human” and “every other  living species,” reaches back to the sixteenth century to quote Michel de  Montaigne on the problem of perspective in our relationships with animals:  88 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="11"> Ecologies of Nearness ‘“When I play with my cat ... who knows if I am not a pastime to her more  than she is to me?”’ (Derrida and Mallet 2008: 7). In Japanese literature,  Sōseki Natsume’s I Am A Cat (2002) off ers an equally playful role reversal in  which the life story of the owner is told by “his” cat, from the rather haughty  cat’s perspective.5 Gregory Bateson’s (2000: 371–72) work on communicational theories  argues against the notion that dolphins might possess anything a linguist  would call language. Rather, he suggests that, like humans and other mam- mals, “[Dolphins] are preoccupied with the patterns of their relationships.”  Bateson writes: “Th e cat asks for milk by saying ‘Dependency,’ and I ask  for your attention and perhaps respect by talking about whales. But we do  not know that dolphins, in their communication, resemble either me or the  cat. Th ey may have quite a diff erent system” (372). Bateson’s groundbreak- ing work on animal communication transcended the language question and  paved the way for social scientists to grapple with the problem of cross- species relationships broadly construed. Sociologist of science Bruno Latour (2004) asks whether animals can  intervene in their own representations, while historian of biology Donna  Haraway in When Species Meet (2008) philosophizes about dogs and other  “companion species” by alluding to Geertz’s turtles: “We are in a knot of  species coshaping one another in layers of reciprocating complexity all the  way down. Response and respect are possible only in those knots, with ac- tual animals and people looking back at each other, sticky with all their  muddled histories” (Haraway 2008: 42). Haraway’s studies of aff ect between  human and nonhuman animals theorizes these relationships as intrasubjec- tive rather than the more conventional intersubjective; she re-conceptualizes  human-animal inter-actions as mutually constitutive “intra-actions” (2008:  262) that are hermeneutical rather than dyadic. Th is alternative view of non- humans, in which the human species is always already entangled, may be  part of why proponents of Th e Cove interpret respect for dolphins as freedom  for dolphins. Dolphins and the People of Nago Th e “muddled history” of human-dolphin relations in Okinawa is sum- marized in a 2010 Okinawan documentary fi lm made for Japan’s Nation- wide Whale Forum (Zenkoku Kujira Fuoramu). Dolphins and the People of  Nago6 opens with many black-and-white photos of pre–World War II dol- phin hunts, rolling through tranquil images of old fi sh markets and small  children helping to pull landed dolphins in to shore with single ropes tied  around their tails. Still images then transition into full culinary color as vid- eos of people cooking in groups and dancing in traditional performances  that center around ritualized dolphin hunts. Unlike Th e Cove, which delivers  89 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

First hunted in Okinawa during the Meiji period (1868–1912), dolphins  were considered a favor or blessing from God (kami no onkei). Opinions  vary as to why Pitu7 fi rst migrated into Nago Bay, but stranding is the most  likely reason. Mr. Yamato (the whaling expert introduced in Chapter 3), is  interviewed throughout the fi lm and notes that the people of Nago inter- preted this accident of nature as a “yuimun” (in Japanese: yorimono), a gift  from god that comes near, that comes to you. Th e narrator is nostalgic: “We  took Nago’s rough [stranding] waters as charity from the sea. It was an era  in which we took them together, we divided them together, and we used the  leftovers to be sold.” Dolphins follow the Kuroshio (Black Current), a warm Pacifi c Ocean cur- rent that moves northward from the Philippines and passes in and around  Okinawa in a northerly fl ow toward mainland Japan in February and March.  Before World War II, Okinawans used the roundup (oikomi) method still  used in Taiji to trap dolphins. In the fi lm, Yamato describes this period as  one of heroic gestures, including hunting dolphins for survival. Th e immedi- ate postwar period was, he told me, “a time with no protein.” Th us, dolphin  became an even greater luxury. Th e whaling industry in Japan developed signifi cantly during the “Golden  Age” of the 1950s, as technologies for hunting larger whales improved. Th e  roundup method was outlawed in Okinawa in 1991, in accordance with  larger global trends to limit whaling. Today fi shermen in Okinawa are re- quired to hunt with a crossbow that allows them to take only one dolphin  at a time, which is why therapy and show dolphins are imported from Taiji.  Taiji fi shermen use the round-up method, allowing for the entrapment of  a vastly greater number of animals at one time. As of 2010 only 105 dol- phins can be taken annually in Okinawa (the Taiji fi gure alleged in Th e Cove  is 23,000). Fishermen have diffi  culty attaining these restricted numbers  because, according to Yamato, the dolphins “don’t come around as much  anymore.” “It’s a food culture that you can’t enjoy unless you’re from here.” Th e latter part of Dolphins and the People of Nago showcases the many ways  that dolphin can be prepared. Colorful images showing the dark purple meat  being stir-fried, sautéed, and chopped into dolphin rib soup are meant to  leave the viewer salivating. Th e narrator emphasizes the need to fi nd exciting  new ways to cook these traditional foods in order to keep young people in- terested in eating them. Nago’s diverse dolphin food culture must go on for  the vitality of the city, the viewer is told. Th e fi lm concludes with Yamato’s  90 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

According to Yamato, humpbacks that en- tered Nago Bay were also originally regarded as yuimun, but unlike the smaller  dolphins this enormous “gift from god” was also regarded as a god that could  not be eaten (or, from a more practical standpoint, could not be taken). By  the end of the war, however, these whales were “worshipped” for a diff erent  reason: Okinawans were starving. Th is was a time when the post-meal Jap- anese saying “Gochisōsamadeshita” (literally “I feasted,” but meaning “Th ank  you for the delicious meal”) was frequently replaced by the Okinawan phrase  “Tarajishimashita” (“More please” or “Th is was not enough”). Hunting tech- nologies had advanced such that hunters could now land the larger whales. But even a yuimun can come too near. In southern Okinawa, fi shermen  regard dolphins as pests on the order of the mongoose. Th ere is no strong  history of dolphin hunting in southern towns because there is no bay in  which to trap them easily. Some older divers in the southern town of Itoman  told me that dolphins pose a major problem for local tuna fi shermen. Sharks  will eat one bundle of fi sh bait (used to catch the tuna) and then move along,  but dolphins can hear everything: the clinking of fi shing wires as deep as  fi ve hundred meters, the approaching fi shing boats, humming engines. Th ey  recognize these underwater mechanical sounds as “chow time” and follow  the boats relentlessly to catch the catch. In a follow-up interview with Yamato, I asked him what he thought about  the future of whaling in Nago. His prediction, that the industry would most  likely shift away from hunting and more toward dolphin and whale watch- ing, echoed other stories I had heard about Okinawan fi shermen. Some re- sponded to the rapid decline in fi sh stocks over the last couple of decades by  converting their vessels into touring and diving boats. An empty fi shing boat  might depart and return empty on wasted fuel, but a tourist-fi lled vessel was  sure to provide a reliable “catch.” In the end, Yamato turned my questions  back on me: “So, which story do you believe? Mine or theirs?” (referring to  Th e Cove). Trying to be diplomatic, I replied that I thought both fi lms made  important points about changing dolphin culture in the twenty-fi rst century.  “Both?” He balked, incredulous. On my way home from the museum, I passed an older woman hunched  over picking wildfl owers next to a placard that described the history of whal- ing in Okinawa. I could read the Japanese portion, but I asked her to ex- plain the Okinawan expression “Hiitudooi!” (in Japanese: “Irukadazo!”). She  told me that when she was small, the whalers would shout this out when a  dolphin was spotted. Everybody, including children, would run from their  schools, homes, and workplaces toward Nago Bay to help land the animal or  91 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

Yamato had told me that  I should still be able to fi nd dolphin sold in most local grocery stores, but  this woman said it was harder to come by these days. I followed up at four  supermarkets in Nago but was unable to fi nd any meat labeled “dolphin,”  and store employees told me they did not carry it. Even the surf ’n’ turf menu  at Restaurant Flipper—a popular dining establishment with a blissful-look- ing cartoon dolphin on its sign—was limited to deep fried shrimp and steak  (see Figure 4.2).

I divulge my own gut responses to  uncomfortable fi eldwork experiences to illustrate the surprising and small  ways in which tourists and ethnographers are occasionally challenged to re- orient pre-existing beliefs and political commitments. Th e ethics of nearness  is complicated, perhaps even defi ned, by a globalizing environmental politics  that infl uences our attitudes toward certain charismatic animals—or what  Jean Baudrillard (1994: 134) would call our disdainful “sentimentality.” Today the opportunity to touch, ride, and eat a dolphin is a tourist nov- elty. Dolphin consumption is rare in mainland Japan; when Yamato’s To- kyoite nephew overheard us chatting he blurted out, “You eat dolphins?!”  Regardless of whether they are for eating, touching, or watching, dolphins in  Okinawa (as with many places) are popularly portrayed as cuddly creatures  close to human beings. Indeed, humans and dolphins are both mammals; eat  at the same level of the food chain; and respond to whistles. Still, my facili- tated encounter at the Motobu Wellness Village only served to increase my  awe for these cetaceans. In the next section I consider the pursuit of nearness  to a tiny animal so “other” that we have to transform our most fundamental  human traits just to get close. Aquatic Adaptation What does it mean, in the fullest sense of the phrase, to be absorbed by nature? —Rob Nixon (2011: 185) All the divers I met during my fi eldwork were seeking an unmediated, or at  least under-mediated, experience of an underwater world. Some were pay- ing customers in search of the world’s most colorful, fi sh-fi lled reefs. Others  were volunteers intent on ameliorating the reef damage wrought by human  beings and other natural disasters. I talked to Japanese dive guides who had  swapped their pantsuits for wetsuits to escape the corporate world in Tokyo,  and former U.S. Marines intent on transferring their amphibious reconnais- sance skills to the leisure sport of postwar wreck diving. If you swim too close, however, scuba diving can make you somebody’s  lunch. Every time a leisure diver is killed by a shark or pierced by a stingray,  we are reminded that we do not, in fact, own the ocean. Th ese shocking  news stories remain so because we forget that, when underwater, human  beings quickly become “matter out of place” (Douglas 2003). In two years of  diving in Okinawa, I was never attacked or harmed by anything underwater  93 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

All of my cuts and bruises were sustained during the precarious,  pre-weightless periods I spent entering and exiting the water amidst pro- truding shallow reefs. Most diving accidents actually occur before the diver  is even in the water, and Okinawan divers typically wear felt-soled booties to  prevent slippage on algae during rocky beach launches. Underwater safety is a matter of preparation. SCUBA, an acronym that  emerged in the 1950s, stands for “self-contained underwater breathing appa- ratus.” Air tanks made from aluminum or steel attach to your back through  a buoyancy control device (BCD)—an infl atable vest that regulates above- water fl oatation and aquatic buoyancy. Rubber fi ns strapped onto your feet  help you propel yourself through the water using the “frog kick.” Th e wet  (or dry) suit simulates seal blubber. During the winter, my wetsuit served the  functional purpose of insulating me against the chill of cooler waters. During  the summer we were advised to wear a “shortie” (short-sleeved) wetsuit, but  were strongly encouraged to continue in our full-length gear for complete  protection against the scraping coral and stinging jellyfi sh down below. Haraway (2008) does not see these kinds of technological appendages as  mere “mediations” or extensions between cohesive beings such as humans,  animals, and plants; rather, she writes that “technologies are organs” co- terminous with our physical bodies (Haraway 2008: 249). Our biophysical  eyes, our underwater cameras, and our masks all become semiotically active  “technological eyes” (250). David Picard (2013: 102) uses a technological  metaphor when he compares the disorienting visual experience of diving in  “magic” coral gardens to the eff ect of a high aperture in photography. Objects  of diff erent distances come into focus in the same frame, whereupon a group  diving experience is enhanced by each diver’s altered sensory perceptions. Learning to Dive Of the many forms of nature-based tourism I explored during my fi eldwork  in Okinawa, coral transplanting was the only activity that required special  training. According to the international diving license in my wallet, I am an  “advanced intermediate diver” because I have logged more than fi fty dives  under the supervision of certifi ed scuba instructors. During my open-water  certifi cation scuba-diving lessons in the summer of 2009, I was taught never  to touch anything living in the water. As a beginning diver, I had unsteady  buoyancy and balance, and I was terrifi ed of crushing a living thing with my  tank, or underfi n. Th e fi sh I did not worry about; they came and went freely,  quickly darting away before any part of my clunky apparatus could assault  them. Th e poor corals, however, could not escape my plunging clumsiness. 94 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="17"> Ecologies of Nearness Once I was certifi ed, I joined a Sunday dive club to practice my under- water skills and prepare me for future coral transplanting. I copied the senior  divers, many of whom volunteered for the non-profi t organization (NPO)  Reef Check, and began wearing cheap white cotton gloves on our underwa- ter outings. Th e gloves appeared to serve a dual purpose: to protect me from  the corals and to protect them from me. Th ey certainly did not provide any  warmth. Coral’s sensitivity to human touch is debated. Dan Brendt, one of my  American ex-military dive instructors, told me that it is actually quite hard  to kill a coral this way (though problems can arise from too many hands  lightly touching the same reef on any given day). Divers are taught not to  touch anything in order to cultivate a more cautious attitude in the water. In  Australia, in fact, gloves are prohibited precisely to dissuade touching. Pro- fessional and advanced amateur divers often swim with their arms crossed  in front of them, both because they have achieved perfect buoyancy without  fl ailing their arms about (as beginners do), and to remind less experienced  divers to keep their hands to themselves.  When one is studying the contents of the ocean, however, the rules of en- gagement change entirely. By January 2011 I was more advanced, so I began  diving with a group that had been diving together for ten years in northern  village of Henoko. Th e leader always maintained that he only dives as a  hobby, “because it’s fun,” and claimed to be uninterested in monitoring or  reef cleanup activities. Nonetheless, he regularly facilitated the research proj- ects of marine biology graduate students from the University of the Ryukyus,  who latched onto him to use his boat and access the resources he provided to  the greater diving community in Oura Bay.9 When I dove with Diving Team Snack Snufkin (so named for their lead- er’s resemblance to a Swedish anime character popular in Japan), we all pitched  in to help one student with his project examining the eating habits of small  conch (tōkamuri, a marine mollusk with a spiral shell). We gathered in a  shack-turned-meetinghouse in Mr. Snufkin’s backyard at nine o’clock on a  cool Sunday morning. Th e space was littered with miscellaneous dive gear  and empty beer cans (for post-dive consumption only) and plastered with  fading color photographs chronicling Snufkin’s lifetime of diving adventures. We sat in a circle around a fi re pit, introducing ourselves as smiling late- comers rolled in. Th e day’s leading researcher, Pakuchi (a postdoctoral stu- dent nicknamed for his unusual love of cilantro), explained his project. We  were each handed a small, lidded plastic jar, a special notepad for writing  underwater, and a regular mechanical pencil attached with Velcro. Much to  my surprise, most of the materials required for this sophisticated survey were  purchased at the hundred-yen (dollar) store. Suddenly thinking better of it,  Pakuchi returned to me and asked how many times I had dived. At this point  95 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="18"> Footprints in Paradise in my fi eldwork the number was about thirty. Everyone else was in the high  hundreds if not thousands. As he confi scated my materials, he reassured me,  “Maybe next time.” I was both disappointed and relieved not to be skewing  his data on my fi rst dive with a new group. Fingering Eyes Diving with ten marine biologists was wildly diff erent from diving with  tourist pleasure seekers. Th ey touched, poked, prodded, and picked things  up. Th ey uprooted sea grasses and various other plants, examined them, and  replanted them in the sand afterward, glove-free. I found this more “schol- arly” approach to ocean life exhilarating and liberating, and reasoned that  it might be all right if I touched a few things too. I located a mostly dead- looking sea slug (though they never move much, this one had begun to  shrivel), fl ipped it over and began to gently poke at its belly with my gloved  fi nger. In my excitement, I began touching all kinds of things with the busy- ness of bumblebee pollinating fl owers. Ostensibly searching for live conch,  I went willy-nilly round the reef, lightly fondling the spiny tips of green  coral and delicately tracing the intricate lined curves of creamy brain coral. I  tittered with a child’s delight as bright purple tentacles of clustered sea anem- ones instinctively shrank down around my probing index fi nger. Pakuchi had instructed me to stay close to him and his partner, and for- tunately the unusually clear water that day made it diffi  cult to get lost. Once  my exploratory spree was over, I returned and watched as the others wrote  brief notes to one another on their waterproof pads. I had not managed to  locate any conch shells (most of us surfaced empty-handed that day), but  I wanted Pakuchi to see the glorious, swirly mountain of gray sand I had  found plopped perfectly, like a dollop of soft serve, on the muddy bottom of  the bay. Surely this mound housed something of interest! “Unchi,” he scrib- bled on his pad. I had discovered worm poop. After the dive we were all freezing. We returned to Snufkin’s house, where  the students took turns showering and used an outdoor brick pizza oven to  cook hirayachi (a thin, savory pancake-crepe hybrid made with eggs, fl our,  and green onion), fried shrimp, and vegetable crackers in hot oil. Snufkin  drank beer. Nobody reprimanded me for my earlier touching frenzy, but by  this time I had started to feel guilty and promised myself I would not do it  again. Perhaps Eva Hayward will forgive me. Hayward’s 2010 article “Fingery- eyes” contemplates the “haptic-optic” of cross-species encounters through a  titular, slightly creepy neologism that refers to the “synaesthetic quality of  materialized sensation” and “transfer of intensity, of expressivity in the simul- 96 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="19"> Ecologies of Nearness taneity of touching and feeling” cup corals (Hayward 2010: 580–81). Hay- ward studies cup corals (Balanophyllia elegans) in part because this species  experiences the world non-visually, and conceives of human eyes as “con- tiguous with—not divisible from—the body’s sensorium” (582). Th e onto- logical status of these “sightless” corals stems from a complex haptic-sensory  apparatus comprised of tactile, kinaesthetic, and proprioceptive senses, and  Hayward’s fascination with them derives from the fact that they exist with- out the capacity for sight. Put more simply, “they ‘touch,’ therefore they are”  (577). I had to use my fi ngeryeyes to get a grip on coral. Classifying Coral Corals are weird, gorgeous, magnifi cent, perplexing, awe-inspiring, unfamil- iar creatures. Marine biologists have established a rigorous taxonomic system  for classifying corals, but it can be diffi  cult for the untrained onlooker to dis- cern, based on their appearance, whether corals are rocks, plants, or animals.  Coral’s broadest defi nitions—as a hard stony substance secreted by certain  marine coelecterates as an external skeleton, typically forming large reefs in  warm seas; or as a sedentary coelenterate of warm seas with a calcareous,  horny, or soft skeleton—are of minimal help to non-specialists. Th e subor- ders within the broadest scientifi c classifi cation of coral (Anthozoa) include  reef-forming stony corals (order Scleractinia or Madreporaria), soft corals  (order Alcyonacea), and horny corals (order Gorgonacea). Ordering the “Other” Th e privileging of the visible and of the sense of sight over others in the  creation of knowledge is powerfully articulated in Michel Foucault’s (2002)  critique of Linnaeus’s taxonomic classifi cation of plants and animals in Th e  Order of Th ings. Foucault describes the fi eld of natural history as “nothing  more than the nomination of the visible” (144), a fi eld in which “sense of  touch is very narrowly limited to the designation of a few fairly evident  distinctions (such as that between smooth and rough); which leaves sight  with an almost exclusive privilege, being the sense by which we perceive  extent and establish proof.” Th is ordering of things creates a legible system  for accumulating knowledge that simultaneously defi nes, through its meth- odology, natural history’s “condition of possibility” (145). Th e limitations  of the predominantly visual mode of inquiry, as Hayward (2010) illustrates,  become further apparent when we recognize that eyes come mounted on  moving bodies. 97 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="20"> Footprints in Paradise Many of my diving companions imagined exploring the ocean as the  “next best thing” to space travel as we often imagine it: technologically (ox- ygen must be regulated), experientially (buoyancy resembles weightlessness),  and visually (a host of alien life forms await). Marine anthropologist Stefan  Helmreich’s 2009 ethnography Alien Ocean highlights the discourses of oth- ering and foreignness associated with marine scientists’ attempts to “appre- hend” and ascribe social meaning to marine microbes, among the smallest  members of an ocean ecosystem. Such recently discovered microbes elude  existing taxonomies and classifi cations, in part because the “signifi cance of  these life forms for forms of life” is poorly understood (Helmreich 2009:  16). Corals’ function in marine ecosystems is likewise complex but can be  simplifi ed for human interest as follows: they attract and provide food and  shelter for the fi sh we eat. Coral is not new to taxonomies of the sea, yet its  distant, “alien” nature still informs the landlocked human imaginary. Corals  are visible to the naked (though generally masked) eye, but still they are hard  to comprehend. As one of my instructors put it, “Corals hold and protect  squid eggs just as trees hold bird eggs ... but because they are not leopards,  lions, or pandas, we tend to forget about them.” Helmreich (2009: 15) fi nds that “marine mascots” have “scaled down  from the nineteenth-century whale to the twentieth-century dolphin to,  now ... the sensationally odd and not-quite other.” Like marine microbes,  corals are “neither charismatically mammoth nor wet and cuddly.” Th e Yam- baru kuina (introduced in Chapter 2), for example, will always be cuddlier  than an abrasive stony coral, but NPOs such as Coral Okinawa, Sea Seed  Okinawa, and Reef Check are working hard to mobilize this sessile animal  for environmental education and conservationist purposes. Corals are an- thropomorphized and gain social meaning through the interspecies nearness  produced by human underwater intervention. Native Transplants Transplanters’ eff orts are not unambiguously benefi cial to the ocean. Oki- nawa, often referred to as the “Galapagos of the East,” is marked as a biodi- versity hot spot because its reefs are comprised of approximately 380 diff erent  kinds of coral. (Florida, by comparison, hosts about 30 species.) In the global  marine science community, discussions of biodiversity often include discus- sions of “bioinvasion.” Helmreich (2009) defi nes marine bioinvasions, in- tentional or otherwise, as “the human-mediated transport of creatures from  one marine ecosystem to another, an activity that frequently has deleterious  eff ects on destination waters” (12). Contemporary coral transplanters are  every bit as intentional in their maneuvers as the well-meaning Japanese bi- 98 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="21"> Ecologies of Nearness ologist who fi rst brought the mongoose to Okinawa (discussed in Chapter  2). However, the impact of the coral reef “bioinvasion” on marine ecosys- tems is less clear. Th e species discussed in this chapter, table coral (midori ishi  sango) from the genus Acropora, is native to Okinawa, but even native corals  of the same species have diff erent genes. Clustering too many cousin corals  together can lead to gene-mixing and spawning that could cause one species  to go extinct. Table coral’s role in the ecosystem is well understood, but  extensive coral transplanting could nevertheless generate an “alien ocean”  comprised of “mixed up lineages” and “those outside, beyond, or within  known oceans” (17). Th e risk of destroying one species by saving another  complicates the ethics of promoting reef biodiversity through intervention. Accounting for Loss Have you ever seen deep inside the ocean? We sea creatures are living in places you’ve probably never seen. Please protect us. In return, we’ll give your children a great gift, beautiful oceans. We the ocean corals wish to coexist with human beings. Sea Seed Okinawa (NPO) “Message from in the Sea” I can’t count them, but I can tell you there’s less fi sh. —Dan Brendt, Director of Operations Reef Encounters International dive school Okinawan adults who I spoke to about the ocean nearly always began by  extolling the rolling beauty of their warm blue-green seas and brilliant coral,  but would quickly qualify all claims to paradisiacal beauty with “... but  it used to be even prettier.” My informants frequently lamented that their  grandchildren and children would never experience the beautiful beaches  they had known. Stories of loss and decline pervade discussions about the  health of all natural environments in Okinawa, but the fate of the ocean of- ten evokes a peculiar sort of nonspecifi c sadness—those who had never been  scuba diving and only rarely swam in the ocean were well aware that marine  ecosystems are degrading rapidly, but their nostalgic descriptions of this loss  were often somewhat vague. Th e problems of slow vulnerability and temporal diff erence discussed in  Chapters 2 and 3 also pervade coral reef discourse. A 300-year-old coral  killed in hours to weeks by abnormally high sea temperatures cannot be fully  replaced for centuries (Richmond et al. 2007). Th e phenomenon known as  “coral bleaching” (so named because many corals turn white when stressed),  99 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="22"> Footprints in Paradise kills much more slowly; the long-term causes of bleaching are less clear, but  researchers often cite climate change and ocean pollution as major contrib- uting factors. During fi eldwork I dived with members of the Okinawa chap- ter of the international NGO Reef Check Research Group (established in  1997) and the locally based Coral Okinawa (established in 2004), an NPO10  that harnesses volunteer diver skills and labor to monitor the growth (and  regrowth) of six key reef sites on Okinawa’s main island. Volunteer divers  quite literally transplant baby coral polyps on top of bleached coral skele- tons, using cement and metal cages to protect young corals from common  predators such as the crown-of-thorns (a brilliantly colored spiky venom- ous sea star) and other echinoderms. Th e eff ectiveness of such transplanting  methods remains debatable (Nishihira 2006: 71), but Reef Check’s ongoing  certifi cation of survey divers has greatly improved regional knowledge of fi sh  and coral species in the East China Sea and Pacifi c Ocean surrounding Oki- nawa. Detailed assessments of reefs can be obtained through aerial photog- raphy and mounted sensors on ships, boats, and submersiles; but the most  reliable sources of information about coral reefs are scuba divers themselves  (Dimitrov 2002: 63). Organizations like Reef Check and Coral Okinawa  are promoting sustainable coral interactions by “transplanting” the divers  themselves from typical tourist sites to reef recovery sites. Planting Stakeholders Coral Okinawa11 director Tomohiro Gibu frequently used the English loan- word “stakeholder” (suteekuhorudaa) to describe high-level corporate and gov- ernment coral conservation sponsors. In addition to the Ministry of Environ- ment’s annual contributions, for example, in 2010 Okinawa Prefecture ded- icated ¥1 billion ($12 million) to transplanting corals in the Kerama Islands  (still considered relatively healthy and vibrant). Roughly ten local businesses,  which all use the same stretch of ocean to conduct profi t-based activities rang- ing from dinner cruises to mozuku12 harvesting, are offi  cial coral stakeholders. Divers can also become individual stakeholders, and symbolic gestures,  such as personifying each transplant with a nickname, are intended to en- courage volunteers to grow attached to the reefs and continue monitoring  their coral’s growth over an extended period of time. In Okinawa, marine  scientists, environmental activists, and volunteer tourist divers have under- taken not only to document and quantify coral losses not readily apparent to  landlocked eyes, but to intervene in this slow decline by transplanting new  corals atop old. I call these reef volunteers diving stakeholders, in part because they quite  literally take a stake in the health of the ocean by hammering large silver  100 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

Nearness achieved through  this kind of intervention gives coral an intimate, moral value for volunteer  gardeners. Divers’ identities as ecological stakeholders are produced, I ar- gue, through the “slow labor” of harvesting, growing, and transplanting coral  reefs over periods of months and years. Th eir actions are motivated by in an  international discourse that considers biodiversity loss an “absolute, univer- sally self-evident evil” that may never be forgiven (Lowe 2006: 158; Wilson  1984). Within this discourse, replacing dead corals with live ones becomes a  rational project replete with careful measurements, standardized procedures,  and photographic evidence of progress. I emphasize this aspect of coral  transplanting because, as I discuss next, the aff ective rewards of partaking in  this activity derive from the act of “coral gardening”13 much more than from  tracking the incremental growth of coral polyps. For coral gardeners, the  meaning and the feeling is in the doing. Stakeholders theory contends that people will protect what they value.  Th e term originated in the business and fi nance world, but since the 1980s  the stakeholders concept has broadened to encompass niche enterprises such  as environmentally sensitive tourism intended to educate visitors and local  community members (Honey 1999a: 12). Robert Fletcher takes issue with  one of the underlying assumptions of stakeholders theory—that the primary  incentive for local engagement in conservation initiatives is economic. In  the context of ecotourism (and other forms of nature-based tourism), “stake- holding” circulates as a discourse with a “relatively coherent and culturally  specifi c set of beliefs, values and assumptions” that entails a host of non- material motivations as well (Fletcher 2009: 271). Following Martha Honey  (1999), Fletcher argues that for the typical ecotourist (described in the In- troduction as young, highly educated, middle-class), ‘“genuine’ ecotourism  must go beyond simply selling an encounter with ‘nature’ to provide eco- nomic, social and environmental benefi ts” (Fletcher 2009: 272). Th e “con- dition of possibility” (Escobar 1995; Foucault 2002) for creating value and  meaning through ecotourism is shaped by a particular cosmopolitan cultural  perspective shared by this elite demographic. What is this perspective? One feature is an emphasis on the consump- tion of experience as a form of class distinction (Bourdieu 1984), or what  Fletcher (2009: 276) calls the “promotion of a post-industrial approach to  natural resource use, wherein rural landscapes are seen [as] a site for the the  production and consumption of experiences more than the production and  consumption of commodities characteristic of an industrial resource regime.”  As Karen Magik, argued, such experiences are the key to education—another  shorthand term used by ecotourism planners to justify the value of their  labor, and of conservation projects more generally, to local people (Fletcher  2009: 280). Environmental education (what Celia Lowe [2006] might sub- 101 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="24"> Footprints in Paradise sume under an “analytic of knowledge”) becomes an umbrella term for the  conveyance of what can appear to be straightforward facts and fi gures related  to conservation. Th is kind of learning promotes a particular set of ideologies  about nature that tend to be naturalized by members of the ecotourist demo- graphic, which includes me and most likely you, too. Lowe (2006: 23) writes that “thinking of humans as subjects constituted  by knowledge, rather than unconstrained individuals who possess and con- trol knowledge, is useful for comprehending the identities that emerge from  projects to conserve biodiversity.” In a similar vein, Hayward (2010: 593)  theorizes that the coral organism’s “responsiveness with an environment are  the conditions of its emergence.” Th is ontological model applies to coral  transplanters as well. Volunteer divers emerge as ecological stakeholders as  they carry corals and ferry reef data between wet and dry worlds. Th is kind  of liquid mobility also becomes a “strategy for claiming territory” (Ogden  2011: 90)—a strategy for both humans and nonhumans to stake claims in  reef territory. Coral Gardening Th e essential Trobriander ... is fi rst and foremost a gardener ... He experiences  a mysterious joy in delving into the earth, in turning it up, planting the seed,  watching the plant grow, mature, and yield the desired harvest. If you want to  know him, you must meet him in his yam garden, among his palm groves or  on his taro fi elds. You must see him digging his black or brown soil among the  white outcrops of dead coral and building the fence, which surrounds his garden  with a “magical wall,” which at fi rst gleams like gold among the green of the new  growth and then shows bronzed or grey under the rich garlands of yam foliage.  (Malinowski 1935: xix) Coral Gardens and Th eir Magic, Bronislaw Malinowski’s 1935 account of  agricultural economy in the Trobriand Islands, can stimulate in the reader a  deep “yearning for the physical sensuousness of a wet and blue-green Earth”  (Haraway 1999: 50 ). Th e descriptive contrast of blacks and browns, greens  and golds against the dead white of dead coral makes me want to delve deep,  to plant and grow new life. However, Malinowski’s ethnography is concerned foremost with the ma- teriality of coral primarily as a lens on Trobriander life. Like the islands of  Okinawa Prefecture, the Trobriand Islands (currently known as the Kiri- wina Islands, a chain of atolls located off  the eastern coast of New Guinea)  are comprised of coral. Malinowski’s Trobriander informants scraped small  chunks of coral from the outer ridge of their atoll and used them as an ingre- 102 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="25"> Ecologies of Nearness dient in what could be likened to magical fertilizer for yams and other crops.  Th is practice provides an ethnographic basis for his discussion of magic and  rationality in Trobriander daily life. In short, Malinowski followed the coral  to get near the people. I never found an “essential” Okinawan of the sort Malinowski character- ized in his ethnographic present, but I was intrigued by the “mysterious joy”  (1935: xix) of the coral transplanter, whose work, I can now say with confi - dence, can prove infi nitely frustrating and unrewarding. An early detractor  from so-called “armchair anthropology,” Malinowski asserted that a particu- lar form of interactive nearness (conventionally known today as participation- observation-interaction) is key to understanding Trobriander ways of life.  Malinowski’s famous trumpeting call for the ethnographer to “put aside  camera, notebook and pencil, and join in himself in what is going on” (Ma- linowski 1922: 21-22, quoted in Geertz 1988: 76-77) is by now canonical  advice for anthropologists and standard fi eldwork practice. To even attempt  underwater participant observation amongst Okinawan coral transplanters  and reef surveyors, however, these were precisely the participatory tools I had  to take up.  Monitoring and Maintenance In late February 2011, I joined the NPO Coral Okinawa for an orientation  and training course that would enable me, at long last, to join them on one  of their monthly monitoring trips. We met on a crisp Wednesday morning  at the Ginowan Marine Support Center and were soon joined by six grad- uating students from the Okinawa Well Sports Technical College. Most of  these 18–22-year-olds expressed an interest in pursuing some sort of sports  fi tness career, and all of them were experienced divers. I perused blue plastic  tanks full of baby coral transplants warming under heat lamps in their watery  nursery. Mr. Gibu called us to gather around him, and began a sort of review  session by quizzing the students on what exactly we were protecting the  corals from with the green metal cages he had amassed. He held one up, and  I recognized it as a half-moon shaped upside-down hanging fl ower basket,  also from the hundred-yen shop. He asked the group: “Who eats the coral?”  “Onihitode (crown-of-thorns),” one student replied. Gibu continued: “What  else does?” “Reishigai (dog winkles),”14 the group chorused. Most students were returning to do maintenance (mentenansu) and mon- itoring (monitooringu) on corals they had transplanted the previous month.  Both of these key words were borrowed from English, and when Gibu asked  them what monitoring meant in Japanese the giddy bunch went silent. Even- 103 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

His translation was met with a vigorous nodding of heads. He  later explained that he preferred to use the English loanword version of these  basic words in his explanation of international standard transplanting proce- dures because many of the training manuals and literature he drew on were  published in English. Gibu selected one of the more experienced students to  explain the basic transplanting procedure to me. Th e tools laid out before us  included the familiar white gardening gloves, a coarse wire brush, a mallet,  thick silver nails, clear zip ties, two varieties of mud-like dark grey glue, and  the inverted fl ower basket cages. Th e student gave a quiet, very tentative over- view of how each of these tools was used to secure the adolescent corals atop  the reef. After another brief moment of silence, Gibu jumped in to elaborate  on the protocol we were to follow once submerged: 1)  Select an appropriate reef on which to build (we relied on Gibu’s ma- rine biologist assistant to do the choosing). 2)  Use the wire brush to scrape the surface of the reef vigorously and  clean off  algae and other accumulated particles. 3)  Mix the two glues together into golf ball-sized lumps, taking care  never to touch the glue out of water. 4)  Remove the planting corals from their plastic container and press the  square base fi rmly into the glue mixture, taking care to secure all four  corners. 5)  Press the coral transplants into the reef such that each fi ts snugly un- derneath the canopy of the wire cage. 6)  Secure the cage on top of the corals, ensuring that none of the polyp  branches protrude to invite fi shy nibblers. (Note: author’s translation) 7)  Use the zip ties to anchor the basket atop the corals. 8)  Secure zip ties to the reef by carefully hammering four nails around  the perimeter of the cage without shattering the underlying reef. 9)  Adjust until zip ties are taut. After rehearsing the process twice, we were sent to prepare the materials. I  scooped globs of the dark and light grey glues from a large tub using house- hold rice scoopers. Th e glue resembled black sesame ice cream, a popular  Japanese dessert, but the sticky stuff  made it diffi  cult to transfer into our  smaller containers. I removed the hanging cords from the wire basket plant- ers, completing their transformation from aboveground garden accessory  into underwater coral safe haven. Mr. Gibu then led us outside to the adolescent coral nursery (these larger  specimens had been incubating for about six months). Each table coral,  104 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

He asked us to carefully choose six corals that we  estimated would all fi t inside a protective cage. We tenderly lifted them out  of their shallow, fi ltered seawater nurseries and placed them side by side  into clear plastic tubs and fastened lids on top. After a short bus ride to the  shoreline we all unloaded and began donning our gear. I quickly fell behind  and was still adjusting my fi ns while everyone else waded into the water for  a shore launch. A teasing student voice rang out: “Andy, you’re pretty slow!” Shallow Encounters Not all transplanters are divers. One need not even get wet. I attended a  number of family-friendly shoreline maintenance and monitoring events  where participants could wade just a few meters out toward a shallow reef  to check on the growth of their coral, or to plant a new polyp. Th e fi rst  time Gibu invited me to participate in a transplanting session, he just told  me to meet him at nine in the morning at the Ginowan Marine Support  Center, giving no further details. I turned up in late January 2010 with my  wetsuit and all of my diving gear in tow and was immediately handed a  “Staff ” badge and given an offi  cial NPO Coral Okinawa sweatshirt to wear.  My job was unclear, so I stood guard next to the nursery and tried to look  confi dent. Soon a large tour bus arrived and unloaded about ninety volunteers. I  was surprised to see that a “typical” tourist guide, outfi tted with heels and a  fl ag, was leading the group. I noticed that a few of the volunteers were wear- ing t-shirts that read “We ♥ Okinawa,” a tourism promotion campaign I  had noticed across the island. Th e group gathered around Gibu, who briefl y  explained the philosophies and procedures he had taught me the fi rst time  I attended one of his lectures. Th e We ♥ Okinawa representative gave him  precisely twenty minutes to explain his NPO’s activities. Gibu later told me  that he was very frustrated because he needed at least forty minutes to ex- plain what they do and why they do it. His speech began: Why should anyone care about coral? First of all, because they’re alive. Th ey are  small animals. Coral are like underwater trees—they are inhabited by fi sh like  birds inhabit the forest. Coral is their habitat. But 90 percent of Okinawa’s reefs  have died in the last fi fteen years. Looking from above or outside nothing has  changed, Okinawa’s sea is still unusually beautiful. But inside it’s changing. Th e  coral could be gone in fi fty years. 105 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="28"> Footprints in Paradise He touched on the devastation of El Niño in 1998,15 concluding that trans- plantation would help at least “a little bit.” He closed with a call to “re- turn Okinawa’s reefs to their pre-’98 condition.” When Gibu was fi nished  speaking, the tour guide summarized his comments as follows: “Without  beautiful, clean water we can’t make good beer!” Only then did I realize that  this coral tour was actually an Orion Beer–sponsored event, and that our  volunteers were just stopping in on their way to a brewery in Nago. In just one hour on this sunny Sunday morning, ninety people migrated  toward the coral nursery, listened to Mr. Gibu’s brief explanation of his  work, secured a broken branch of coral onto a square base with a rubber  band, then wiped their hands with the corporate towels generously provided  by Orion (see Figure 4.3a). Th en they jumped back on the bus and off  they  went, completely dry. After incubating for about 2–3 months (see Figures  4.3b and 4.3c), the corals would attach to their square bases and would be  ready for transfer by an experienced diver (see Figure 4.3d).

By now I had transplanted  coral about six times. Th e pressure to get it right mounted when Gibu, only  half joking, pulled me aside and said, “Andy, today we’re not taking care of  you. Everyone here is a pro. You’re on your own.” Aware that I tended to  move slowly, he asked me to start setting up my gear at least twenty min- utes before everyone else. I tried to act cool and confi dent, stealing sidelong  glances at the other divers to make sure none of my gear was assembled  backwards or upside down. I struggled to pull up my wetsuit, hopping on  one foot and bouncing up and down as if on a pogo stick. Trying to appear at  ease, I casually asked him about the origins of today’s batch of corals. He told  me that after permission was obtained from the prefectural government,16  baby table corals were harvested from donor corals collected specifi cally for  this transplanting. He added that every May the sea turns briefl y but in- tensely red when corals release their eggs for fertilization, a phenomenon I  had watched on the news but never managed to see live. Eggs and sperm are  then harvested and combined to make new corals. On this occasion we were  planting only fi ve corals each because, Gibu informed us, “Th e point is to do  it cleanly and properly.” When we arrived on Kamiyama, we did a quick review of materials and  objectives, lined up and leapt into the chilly water one at a time (left hand on  108 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

Despite  the foreboding, nauseating waves and grey storm clouds we had encountered  on the way out, we all entered the water with relative ease. We defl ated our  BCD vests, gave each other the thumbs down sign,17 sank down to about  fi fteen meters, and began swimming due east. I followed behind the others,  mimicking their relaxed and leisurely graceful frog kicks with my black rub- ber fi ns, and practiced reading my compass. Th en my mask began to fog over  and I realized I had forgotten to spit on the hard plastic lens.18 I lifted the  mask, allowing the cool seawater to rush in and wash the inside of the lens.  I cocked my head back, angled the mask away from my face, and purged the  water with an equine nasal snort. Perhaps for the fi rst time since I had begun diving, I actually recognized  where I was. Th e reef was small, and on our previous mission I had taken  for granted that I would be able to recall where my corals were located. Such  was not the case, and I was grateful for the individualized nametags zip-tied  to each cage. Without names, they all looked the same. I began surveying  the reef for a smooth, bare spot ripe for transplanting. One of the other  divers swam up behind me and handed me two baseball-sized balls of the  grey glue; another followed with my fi ve transplants. I had found a reason- ably fl at spot nestled in a crevice of the reef and surrounded by rusting and  algae-covered cages from past plantings. I began to scrub away with the wire  brush, recounting the planting protocol steps in my head. My buoyancy  shifted as I gradually depleted the air in my tank, and soon I had to jam my  neoprene-padded knee into the crevice to stabilize my position. I hesitated  to hammer the nails into the compromised reef, which cracked with each  strike. After about twenty minutes I had completed my task and began looking  around for something else to do. Th e divers were scrubbing algae off  the  cages of older coral (maintenance), so I joined in until they began signaling  that it was time to go. Gibu hovered behind us to do the monitoring, which  included photographing the corals and recording their few centimeters of  growth over the past few months. Soon I heard the faint, tinny clanking of  pointer-on-tank, which signaled that it was time to head back. By the time  I arrived back below the boat the other divers were all doing their safety  stops,19 fl oating in lotus position, perfectly suspended in the water, looking  peaceful. On the ride back to Naha, I asked Gibu what the day’s activities had actu- ally cost Coral Okinawa. He puff ed carefully on a cigarette, taking care to tap  the ashes into a glass jar to prevent them from fl oating off  into the water. He  told me that a local dive shop had donated the boat, and, save for the glue,  virtually all of the materials used were from the 100 yen store. Most expenses  were incurred in the growing and harvesting of corals prior to transplant. To  109 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="32"> Footprints in Paradise the eight thousand corals he was actively monitoring we had added fewer  than thirty—but at least this small action was cost-free. After docking, we unloaded all of our gear and gathered in a circle to re- view the day’s events. He asked each diver to give a three-minute impression  of their experience, asking: What went right? What could have gone better?  What did you learn? What does this mean to you? Most of the responses were  on the mild side, displaying commonplace Japanese public modesty: “I think  I might have helped a little bit,” or “I’d really like to do this more often.” I  asked Gibu a more specifi c question about the consequences of hammering  into one dying coral to plant a new one on top. In between thoughtful drags,  he replied that the damage done to corals by typhoons far outweighs the dam- age we do with our hammers,20 and insisted reassured me that our methods  followed the international guidelines they had adopted in 2004. His comments left me wondering whether our contributions were merely  a drop in the salty sea bucket. If our eff orts could be thwarted any time the  sea temperature surpassed thirty degrees Celsius, or whenever a tsunami blew  through, and if every seventy years the reefs are taken over by the crown-of- thorns anyway, then why bother? He countered my cynicism: “For policy, we  need this [protocol] as a policy. More than new technology, we need good  policies.” Th is is how Gibu and his volunteer transplanters take stakes in coral. Conclusion When we think of getting near to nature, we might imagine childhood proj- ects such as butterfl y and rock collections, or perhaps even seashells and coral  fragments once collected to decorate our bathrooms and gardens. But not all  nature collections involve removing the object of interest from its ecosystem:  diving stakeholders collect coral colonies by adding to the marine popu- lation and naming individual transplants. Th is form of collecting involves  monitoring and maintaining corals, and recording the names of fi sh and  other species that inhabit them. Instead of acquiring natural trinkets such as  sand dollars, the take-home from this kind of coral counting and collecting  is data, accumulated and recorded on waterproof notepads and later elabo- rated in personal dive logs. In addition to chronicling basic details such as  the temperature of the water, depth and length of each dive, logbooks (a  form of “recreational book-keeping” [Lorimer and Lund 2008: 197]) always  include a section for the diver to sketch any remarkable sightings. In Chap- ter 3, village walkers and community chatters gathered local cultural and  ecological knowledge by collecting objects such as rocks, fl owers, memories,  and photographs. In the context of coral transplanting, the experience of  monitoring and maintenance is collected rather than the coral itself. 110 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched. Not for resale.  </page> <page sequence="33"> Ecologies of Nearness Hayden Lorimer and Katrin Lund (2008: 185) problematize a common  trope in outdoor travel and exploration through the fi gure of novelist John  Fowles. Fowles fi rmly believed in the possibility of a “pristine encounter”  with nature: “[Fowles’] message was clear: for as long as the conceptual urge  to classify, document, list and tick prevailed, our common response to nature  would be much the poorer.” In Fowles’s view, expressed most eloquently in  his essay “Th e Blinded Eye” (1984), amongst collectors an “elevated appreci- ation” of nature is too commonly subordinate to “a much diminished, lesser  form of knowing”—a knowing based on drawing, measuring, and counting  (Fowles 1984: 77, quoted in Lorimer and Lund 2008: 186). Th e capacity  to see, and, in the case of coral transplanting, to touch one’s collection, is  central to the act of coral gardening. Lorimer and Lund (2008: 186) artic- ulate shared qualities in the experience of collecting nature, where “tasks  of judgment, organization, inspection, preservation, re-inspection and com- parison happen as a series of correspondences between nimble hands and  discriminating eyes.” Diving stakeholders’ “epistemic ambitions” are grati- fi ed through haptic (involving the sense of touch) and optic intervention in  local coral reefs, as well as through the simultaneous proprioceptive (bodily)  experience of underwater movement through diving. Our need to feel nature may derive from an overall trend identifi ed by  Bryan Turner (1996: 1) as the turn to a “somatic society,” wherein the body  becomes part of a “self-project” wherein individuals express their emotional  needs through specifi c acts of bodily construction. Th rough this process  of embodiment, the individual body “is connected into larger networks of  meaning at a variety of scales” (Cresswell 1999: 176). Th e range of spatial  scales can be imagined through interactions with whales, dolphins, and coral. Th e ecologies of nearness explored in this chapter consider aff ective, ther- apeutic, moral, and scientifi c forms of intimacy between and among human  and nonhuman animal species. In Okinawa, ecological stakeholders emerge  through the use of natural tools—fi ngers, eyes, brains, and kisses—and also  through technological extensions of these tools: nomenclatures, notepads,  cages, harpoons, cameras, tanks, masks, and hammers. Th ese tools bring us  close to nonhumans through a nearness that also constitutes us as human.  Chapter 5 considers what else is lost when we lose our sense of place in nature. Notes  1.

While they do endorse much of the research showing depressed patients’ positive responses  to animals, mental health specialists Aaron Katcher and Gregory Wilkins (1993: 178–79)  dispute many of the exceptional claims regarding dolphins and autism. Th ey write: “Press  reports of autistic children miraculously responding to the presence of captive dolphins ... are the result of uncontrolled clinical studies and the suggestive infl uence of the cult that  has evolved around dolphins and other cetaceans. Equally spectacular results have been  noted with cats, dogs, birds, and even a small turtle.”  4. In a remarkable 2013 announcement, India’s Ministry of Environment and Forests Cen- tral Zoo Authority rejected various tourism development groups’ proposals to build a  commercial dolphinarium because “cetaceans in general are highly intelligent and sen- sitive ... [and] dolphin should be seen as ‘non-human persons’ and as such should have  their own specifi c rights and [it] is morally unacceptable to keep them captive for enter- tainment purpose” (Ministry of Environment and Forests 2013).  5.

Oura Bay is famous in Okinawa as a site where the relatively rare species blue coral was  fi rst discovered, but is perhaps better known as the home of the endangered dugong—a  charismatic animal resembling a manatee. Anti-U.S. military base protestors rally around  these and other symbolically valuable species to prevent the expansion of heliports into the  northern village of Henoko (see Figure 1.1).  10. In Japan, “NGO” refers to international non-governmental organizations, while “NPO”  refers to domestic non-profi t organizations.

Dog winkles or rock shells are thumb-sized, purplish, predatory sea snails. 15. Coral bleaching is a well-documented consequence of rising sea temperatures that has  plagued Okinawa’s reefs since the major El Niño bleaching of 1998. Th e summer of 1998  marked the strongest El Niño on record, during which the complete absence of typhoons  in Okinawa Prefecture rendered the temperatures of the East China Sea warmer than at  any time in the previous ten years. Hurricanes and typhoons are actually critical to the sur- vival of Okinawa’s reefs because the intense winds churn up and cool down the shallower  ocean waters in which many heat-sensitive coral species reside. Experts from the Ministry  112 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

A 2016 reef survey conducted in  Okinawa’s Sekisei Lagoon fi nds that 90 percent of coral has bleached, and that 70 percent  of Japan’s largest reef has died. It is worth noting that bleaching coral reefs can recover  with time and favorable conditions. 16. Many broken coral branches wash ashore following typhoons, but it is illegal to remove  them from the shore as some may survive being beached and return to a coral colony with  low tide. 17.

Th e meaning of environmentally friendly (kankyō ni yasashī) transplanting practices is  contested. Sea Seed Okinawa advocates transplanting by drilling holes into dead corals  and securing baby polyps with the Okinawan sponge gourd Naabeera (Hechima in Jap- anese) rather than using chemical glues. A New York Times article on the world’s largest  government-led “coral transplant surgery” project on Sekisei Lagoon Reef (Okinawa) de- scribes a range of other methods being tested by reef scientists that could be used else- where to rescue reefs endangered by overfi shing, pollution, and global warming (Fackler  2009). 113 This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.
