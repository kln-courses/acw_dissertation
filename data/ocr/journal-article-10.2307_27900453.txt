<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS IN THE BHAGAVAD GITA.* NO other work of Sanskrit literature is so well known and so highly valued in India and the Occident as the Bhagavadg?t? (Mbh., VI, 830 ff.), "The Song of the Exalted One," i. e., the solemn discourse of Krishna. Originally a text-book of the Bh?gavata sect, the Bha gavadg?t? in time attained such a significance for all Brahman India that it has become the sum of all wis dom to the cultured Indian. In his contact with Chris tians he falls back on it as an authority against the New Testament, whose fundamental doctrines he believes to be contained in the Bhagavadg?t? which in Hindu opinion is much the older. On the other hand European scholars have thought that no other Indian work bears such abundant evidence of Christian influence as the Bha gavadg?t?. For these reasons I cannot limit myself simply to mention and discuss the points which have given rise to such statements. An exposition of the relations between Christianity and Brahmanism with reference to the history of religion requires a connected summary of the contents of the Bhagavadg?t?1 even though I must state most posi * Authorized translation from the German manuscript by Lydia G.

After a feud of many years' duration, the two closely related but hostile tribes of the Kauravas and P?ndavas with their military forces and allies advance to battle against each other on the field of the Kurus near where Delhi now stands. A mighty crashing of shells, drums and trumpets resounds, and arrows begin to fly from both camps. Then Arjuna, the famous archer of the P?ndavas, catches sight of some of his kinsmen in the enemy's army, is shocked at the thought of killing them and lets fall his bow and arrows, because he would rather die than to fight and win under such circumstances. But Krishna, who stands at his side in human form as charioteer on the war chariot, admonishes him to do his duty without con sidering consequences and convinces him that he must take part in the battle. These admonitions and instructions of Krishna become more and more profound and treat in sublime diction?in many places with rare beauty and loftiness of expression ?the highest questions about the nature of deity and man's relation to it. Upon the foundation of metaphysical specu lation is here erected a sublime ethical code. Gradually Arjuna perceives who is speaking to him. Krishna reveals himself to Arjuna as the only God, the Lord of all worlds, who has taken upon himself the form of the hero of the Y?dava tribe, and in the eleventh song at Arjuna's request shows himself in his celestial radiant form penetrating the entire world. It has long been known that we do not possess the Bhagavadg?t? in its original text, but in a form which is the result of substantial transformations. The teachings put into the mouth of Krishna in the Bhagavadg?t? offer a remarkable mixture of pantheistic and monotheistic ideas,</page><page sequence="3">496 THE MONIST. of philosophical thought and of pure and deeply religious faith in God. A personal God appears in human form, propounds his teachings, demands of the hearer before all else, besides fulfilment of duty, faithful love and submission to him, then reveals himself with special grace in his divine but still anthropomorphic form, and promises that after death as a reward for his love of God the faithful one shall enter into himself, shall attain communion with God. Along with this God, as personal as can be, who dominates the whole poem, there often stands as the highest principle the imper sonal neutral Brahman, the Absolute. Sometimes Krishna says of himself that he is the only Supreme God who has made the world and all creatures, and governs the All; sometimes he proclaims the pantheistic doctrine of the Brahman and the M?y?, the cosmic illusion, and places before man as his highest aim, that he should overcome M?y? and become Brahman. These two doctrines, the theistic and pantheistic, are dovetailed into each other and follow sometimes very di rectly and sometimes with a loose sort of connection. Nor is the one set forth as the lower, exoteric, and the other as the higher, esoteric doctrine; it is not taught that the ism is the preparatory step to knowledge or the symbol of truth, and that pantheism is truth itself ; but both forms of faith are treated almost without exception as if there were no distinction between them either as regards value or content. The attempt has been made to do away with the con tradictions in the Bhagavadg?t? by explaining that no definite system is here propounded, but that it is a poet who speaks, who takes the thoughts and forms them as they crowd upon him without regarding the contradictions which may arise in separate details. But the great contradiction extending through the</page><page sequence="4">CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS IN THE BHAGAVADG?T?. 497 Bhagavadg?t? can not be set aside by appealing to the poetic temperament. It can only be removed by the as sumption that one of the two heterogeneous doctrines which Krishna proclaims in the Bhagavadg?t? must be a later addition. Therefore Adolf Holtzmann has upheld the view that the Bhagavadg?t? was originally a purely pantheistic poem and that later it was worked over by worshipers of Vishnu-Krishna whereby it attained its present form. But this also is a mistaken view; the re verse is true. The whole character of the poem is so overwhelmingly theistic both with regard to setting and method, that we must suppose that the Bhagavadg?t? was from the start a purely theistic poem and was worked over in the pantheistic spirit after the Brahmans had succeeded in winning over the religious community of the Bh?ga vatas, the worshipers of Krishna, by identifying Krishna with their god Vishnu who had already become the All God. In the ancient poem Krishna speaks of himself?and Arjuna of Krishna?as of an individual, a person, a con scious divinity; in the additions of the redaction the neu tral Brahman appears as the highest conception and is occasionally identified with Krishna. In short, in the an cient poem Krishnaism is set forth which is founded philo sophically upon the S?nkhya and Yoga systems; in the additions of the redaction Brahmaism is represented, the forerunner of the system of the Ved?nta. It has long been known that the doctrines of the S?nkhya-Yoga are on the whole the foundation of the philosophical doctrines of the Bhagavadg?t?, and that compared to them Brahma ism remains considerably in the background. Because of this conviction I have sought in my translation of the Bhagavadg?t? to select the original form of the poem and have eliminated the additions of the Brahmaistic revision. The view which I here submit and my corresponding</page><page sequence="5">498 THE MONIST. attempt to a reconstruction of the original Bhagavadg?t? have met with some opposition but still with more assent, among others from such eminent scholars as Sir George Grierson and Winternitz. Winternitz says2 : "If we read the poem omitting the passages set off in small print by Garbe in his translation, the result is that there is no gap and that even in many places an interrupted connection is again established by leaving out the verses so indicated. It speaks on the whole in favor of the correctness of Garbe's conception that among the 170 verses cut out by him perhaps ten or twelve at the most can be named which show evidence of any poetical beauty/' I myself had not noticed this esthetic consideration, but subsequently be came convinced that the Bhagavadg?t? in my reconstruc tion far exceeded the traditional text in poetical beauty and unity and must be recognized as the work of a genuine poet. I will now first present as briefly as possible the doc trines of the genuine original Bhagavadg?t?, i. e., the Bh? gavata faith worked out from the elements of the S?nkhya Yoga with some new interpretations. In doing this it is not advisable to follow the train of thought of the Bhaga vadg?t? which wanders from one thing to another and constantly confuses the various established standpoints especially in the practical requirements. The religious content of the Bhagavadg?t? corresponds to the N?r? yan?ya section of the Mah?bh?rata (XII, chapters 336 353), the second ancient text-book of the Bh?gavatas, ex cept that the latter is somewhat more strongly Brahmaistic than the Bhagavadg?t?. 2 Geschichte der indischen Litteratur} I, 373. Cf. also Wiener Zeitschrift f?r die Kunde des Morgenlandes, XXI, 196, 197. I would like to utilize this opportunity to make a concession. I consider it very possible that Winternitz is right when in agreement with W. von Humboldt he feels obliged to con sider as mainly later additions, besides the verses I have omitted, the last songs of the Bhagavadg?t? which compare very unfavorably with the first twelve. By this means the scope of the original Bhagavadg?t? is still further materially diminished.</page><page sequence="6">CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS IN THE BHAGAVADG?T?. 499 As an introduction to my exposition, I must say in advance a few words about the conditions under which the adornment of the Bh?gavata religion with the above mentioned philosophical arguments took place.3 When, according to the genuinely Indian tendency to fuse religion and philosophy, under the especial instigation of the strongly speculative influence of the Kshatriya caste, the effort was made to give a philosophical basis to the monotheism of the Bh?gavata religion, the pantheism which found ex pression in the older Upanishads was not chosen for this purpose. The home of this pantheism, the doctrine of the Brahman or the All-One, was the so-called "midland" (Madhyadesha, the region around and north of Delhi), the home of the Brahmanic civilization and expansion of power. The Brahmanic pantheism fitted but poorly with the popular monotheism of the Bh?gavatas who therefore directed their attention to the philosophical systems which had arisen "in the freer atmosphere of the less Brahmanized outland"?to use Grierson's happy expression?, the S?n khya and Yoga. Of these two the S?nkhya, purely athe istic and regardless of ethics, was not sufficient for their purpose; for this system could be used by the Bh?gavatas only in the development of the doctrine of matter and its relation to spirit. Since the religion of the Bh?gavatas possessed faith in God and a pronounced ethical character its followers were better served by clinging more closely to the Yoga system which recognized God and pursued ethical tendencies. The Yoga system is a daughter of the S?nkhya. It has adopted all the important S?nkhya views except its denial of God, and upon these has built up its doctrine of the concentration of thought and the powers to be won thereby. The personal God is inserted into the Yoga sys tem in a very loose and disconnected way and the suppo 3 Cf. for the following, Grierson, article "Bhakti-M?rga," ERE, II, 541 a.</page><page sequence="7">500 THE MONIST. sition is not unjustified that this insertion has been under taken in the interest of the union with the Bh?gavata re ligion; for thus did the system intended originally only for the comprehension of scholars, gain an influence over wider circles. The Bh?gavatas on their side borrowed several concepts from the Yoga system, especially that of the Yoga or the concentration of thought which they grad ually transformed in the sense of submission to God, and approximated to the conception of the love of God.4 I shall begin my analysis of the doctrine of the Bhaga vadg?t? with the systematic part, and start with the per sonality of God. God is a conscious, eternal and omnipo tent being, the "great Lord of the world without a begin ning" (X, 3). He is not only different from the perishable universe but also from the imperishable spirit of the be ings (XV, 17-19), hence spirit in another and a higher form than the souls of all creatures. When we read in VII, 4-6 that God possesses two natures, a higher spiritual nature through which the world is preserved, and a lower material nature consisting of everything that according to the S?nkhya belongs to prakriti or matter, we must not understand by this that matter constitutes one-half of God's essence. Rather does it mean that matter itself is not in dependent, following its own blind impulses, but unfolds under the direction of God ; in other words, that God ope rates in matter and acts through it. This is established beyond doubt in other passages of the Bhagavadg?t?. God implants in matter the germ of development (XIV, 3, 4) and hence is the father of all creatures, whereas matter may be compared to the mother's womb (XIV, 4). God directs the origin, development, and dissolution of the uni verse (IX, 7, 8, 10) and in this sense he calls himself the beginning and the end of the whole world (VII, 6; X, 8) 4 The significance of the Yoga system for the Bh?gavata religion is still clearly apparent in the legend of Akr?ra, Bh?g. Pur., , 57? 29, in Grierson, A, 9 8, . 257, Note 25.</page><page sequence="8">CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS IN THE BHAGAVADGITA. 5OI and identifies himself with death (XI, 32). All conditions of beings are derived from him (X, 4, 5), he directs their fate, i. e., rewards them according to their deeds, and so causes creatures in the course of life "to whirl around like figures on a puppet stage" (XVIII, 61). All God's ac tions are performed merely for the sake of the world; for himself there is no desire to be fulfilled, no purpose to be attained (III, 22, 24). "Whenever right is decreasing, and wrong is increasing," God who has existed from eter nity and is imperishable, creates himself anew, i. e., as sumes new forms of manifestation "for the protection of the good and the extermination of the wicked, in order to establish justice" (IV, 6-8). Because God's acts pertain always to the creation he governs and never arise from any selfish motive he is not bound by his acts (IV, 13, 14; IX, 9) ; hence he can never be entangled in the world's existence. The visionary description of God in Song XI is a dramatic adornment intended to work upon the imagi nation, but is of little importance for the teaching of the Bhagavadg?t? proper. The relation of God to the world of men is not only determined by the stern law of compensation, but God loves the people who recognize him and submit to him with their whole hearts, (VII, 17; XII, 14-20; XVIII, 64, 65, 69), and he saves from all sins those who take their refuge in him alone (XVIII, 66). Here (and likewise XVIII, 56, 58, 62, 73) we already have faith in divine mercy (pra s?da) which we meet with in some later Upanishads and which consequently plays so conspicuous a part in the In dian sects. Although God directs the dispensation of the universe, yet, as we have seen above, it is matter which performs all acts (III, 27; V, 14; XIII,' 20, 29). The world develops from primitive matter and returns to it again (VIII, 18, 19) ; the idea of evolution and reabsorption as well as the</page><page sequence="9">502 THE MONIST. notion of the eons is borrowed from the S?nkhya system. On the whole all views pertaining to matter in the Bhaga vadg?t? agree with the S?nkhya doctrine. The three gunas, or constituents of matter,5 play the same part here as in the S?nkhya system; i. e., by their influences they put the spirit in fetters (XIV, 5 ff.), and the consequences of their activity are manifest in life on every hand, as is shown in great detail in Songs XVII and XVIII. The physiological ideas about the internal organs and senses are likewise those of the S?nkhya system (III, 40, 42; XIII, 5). All these agreements, however, are not so important for the teaching of the Bhagavadg?t? as the fundamental concep tion with regard to the nature of matter which was bor rowed from the S?nkhya and from which starts the philo sophical speculation in Song II. To be sure matter was not created by God, but has existed from the beginning, and is subject to constant change and transformation. All its products and effects are transitory ; its influences, especially joy and pain, come and go and hence do not deserve that we should allow ourselves to be regulated by them (II, 14). In contrast to this mutability of everything that matter brings forth stands the immutability of spirit. The spirit (the soul, the self) resembles matter only in so far as both are eternal and indestructible ; for what is has always been and always will be, "the non-existent knows no existence, the existent no non-existence" (II, 16) ; but the great con trast between matter and spirit consists in the fact that the latter is never capable of change. Indeed the spirit dwells in the body absolutely inactive, "neither acting nor causing to act" (V, 13-15) and remains unmoved by all influences and operations of matter. This is brought out in sublime language in the second song. Whosoever knows 9 See my S?nkhya-Philosophie, 209-220, et passim; "S?nkhya und Yoga," Grundriss der indo-arischen Philologie und Altertumskunde, III, No. 4, pp. 19, 20.</page><page sequence="10">CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS IN THE BHAGAVADGITA. 503 that the spirit is the true self, that the worn-out body is abandoned and passes into a new one as old clothes are laid aside and new ones donned (II, 22), that the spirit can be neither injured nor destroyed?such a one does not lament over the suffering and death of a man, that is to say, over matters which concern only the perishable body. All this is pure S?nkhya doctrine ; but nevertheless the conception of the spiritual principle in the Bhagavadg?t? is essentially different from that in the S?nkhya system, not exclusively philosophical but predominantly religious. According to the Bhagavadg?t?, which proclaims the faith of the Bh?gavatas, the individual soul has not led a sep arate existence from the beginning, but has detached itself from the divine soul as a separate part (XV, 7; cf. also XVI, 18; XVII, 6). Hence the individual souls have a divine origin; they have entered into a connection with matter which is not able to produce any transformation in them but which has brought life and consciousness into the world. It is man's task so to conduct himself that his soul may return again to its origin, to God. With this we come to the practical part of the doctrine of the Bhagavadg?t?. Here stand the two opposing ways of salvation, one of which consists in withdrawing from worldly life and striving after knowledge, the other in acting according to duty apart from all desire. Although the second way is frequently characterized as the better one (III, 8; V, 2; XVIII, 7) and according to the whole context of the Bhagavadg?t? is to be regarded as the par ticular moral ideal of the poem, still the author has not dared to disregard the path of salvation of world renun ciation and abstract knowledge. The idea that salvation from the circuit of life is to be attained by meditation in complete isolation from the world had been for centuries so rooted in the thoughtful circles of the Indian people that it could not be seriously opposed. Nothing else remained</page><page sequence="11">504 THE MONIST. than to recognize both ways side by side and to teach that right action led to salvation as well as knowledge which presupposed the renunciation of works and inactiv ity.' From the fact that in the Bhagavadg?t? now one standpoint is advocated and now the other, and occasion ally the ideal of quietism is frankly placed above that of activity (VI, 3), all sorts of inconsistencies and confusions have arisen which might have been avoided by the positive rejection of the quietistic standpoint. The two standpoints are assimilated with one another in the Bhagavadg?t? by the explanation that the dutiful act performed entirely without reference to consequences and without any per sonal interest loses its effective power, and hence does not result in continued existence for the doer. Actions of this kind therefore in this respect have the same value as the inactivity of the way of salvation through knowledge. The knowledge to be attained on the quietistic path of salvation is described in several passages (XIII, 23; XIV, 19) exactly in the sense of the S?nkhya system, as a dis tinction between spirit and matter ; and as a result of this distinction the prospect of liberation from the necessity of rebirth is held out to the one who possesses this knowledge (XIII, 23) without reference to his conduct. This may be looked upon as an isolated recognition of the genuine S?nkhya ideal. In general the saving knowledge, accord ing to the view of the Bhagavadg?t?, is not limited to the distinction between spirit and matter, but this distinction may be regarded only as a preliminary condition of the knowledge of God which in truth leads man to supreme salvation. The other path of salvation, the Yoga, conceived as disinterested fulfilment of duty, is preached in the Bhaga vadg?t? incessantly and in various ways. Fulfilment of duty alone would not lead to the goal as long as it is in the slightest respect accompanied by hope for the results. Man</page><page sequence="12">CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS IN THE BHAGAVADGITA. 505 should do what is commanded him without passion, with quietness and equanimity, feeling the same towards every one, esteeming of equal value pleasantness and unpleasant ness, joy and pain, success and failure, without desire and without any personal interest. The works of him who acts with this disposition, without troubling himself about the transitory effects of material things (II, 14) solely according to the dictates of duty and following the divine example (III, 22) and leaving the results of all his work to God, are not subject to the law of compensation (IV, 22, 23; IX, 27, 28; XVIII, 12, 17). The requirements here set forth presuppose the condemnation of the Vedic ritual which in the original Bhagavadg?t? is enunciated without any limitation. All the ceremonies of the Brah manic ritual serve personal desires throughout and hence stand in sharp contrast to the ideal of morality of the Bha gavadg?t?. "Give up all sacred usages," we therefore read in XVIII, 66, and in II, 42-45, outspoken scorn is shown for the promises of the Veda which take only the material world into account and offer only transitory re wards (cf. also IX, 20, 21). Accordingly indifference for the prescriptions of the Vedic ritual is likewise a prelim inary condition for the attainment of salvation (II, 52, 53). That in this requirement also we have genuine S?nkhya Yoga doctrine is clear to every one acquainted with the Indian systems. Whichever of the two paths of salvation man may fol low, in both cases he must overcome an obstacle in his natural disposition. When it is said in III, 33, that "be ings follow their nature" and when in XVI, 1 ff. the dis tinction is made between men born for divine existence and those born for a demonic existence, this predetermi nation is to be understood as an effect of previous merit or of previous sin. In the Bhagavadg?t? there is no ques tion of predestination properly so called. Instead we can</page><page sequence="13">5 6 THE MONIST. recognize in it the assumption of moral freedom. Man is entirely free whether or not he will overcome the obstacles which lie upon the path to salvation, whether he strives after low aims or the highest. On the path to the latter innate ignorance stands opposed to the practice of knowl edge (V, 15), and the likewise innate desire which is the peculiar enemy of mankind to the practice of duty (III, 37, 43); but unbelief and skepticism are also destructive (IV, 40). As an expedient toward the successful over coming of these obstactles moderate Yoga exercises are recommended (V, 27, 28; VI, 10 if.; VIII, 10, 12 ff.). Even if a man is not successful in mental concentration these Yoga exercises are nevertheless not in vain, for such a man is reborn under favorable circumstances and finally attains the supreme goal (II, 40; VI, 41 if.). We finally come to the most important requirement which the Bhagavadg?t? makes of men in need of salvation. As is well known the Bhagavadg?t? is the Canticles of bhakti, the faithful and confiding love of God. Both on the path of knowledge and on that of the self-denying ful filment of duty, love to God leads to the goal with absolute certainty. The whole poem is filled with this thought; to proclaim this thought it was written. From the love of God arises the knowledge of God (XVIII, 55) and love of God likewise brings ?bout that the faithful refer all works to God and leave the consequences to him. To every one without distinction of birth or of previous behavior bhakti vouchsafes the certainty of salvation?even to criminals, women, Vaishyas and Sh?dras (IX, 30-32). But it is not a question of a passing impulse of love for God, but the whole nature of man must be filled with an unchangeable love. When this is the case man's thoughts are directed upon God even in the hour of death. Special weight is laid upon this point in the Bhagavadg?t? (VIII, 5, 9, 10,</page><page sequence="14">CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS IN THE BHAGAVADGITA. 507 13) because man enters into that form of existence of which he is thinking in the hour of death (VIII, 6). What now are we to understand of the condition of the soul which has been freed from the existence of the world and has entered into God? Are we to regard it as unconsciousness, as is taught in the S?nkhya-Yoga ? Is the individuality of the soul which once separated itself from the divine soul, extinguished in the return to its ori gin ? No ! Salvation is thought of as a blessed condition of the soul which continues to exist in its individuality in the presence of God. This has remained for all time a fundamental and lead ing doctrine of the Bh?gavata religion. God has caused all individual souls to go forth from himself to a separate conscious existence and since then they exist for all eter nity as individual conscious beings. When they have won salvation from their worldly existence they do not become God but become like God and at his feet enjoy an ever lasting bliss which consists solely in serving him.6 How indeed on the assumption of the S?nkhya-Yoga a soul can lead a conscious existence without regard to matter, we learn neither from the Bhagavadg?t? nor any other Bh?ga vata work. Apparently we have here to do with a view which is derived from the earliest times of the Bh?gavata religion, and which ever since these times has formed one of the main props of this faith. Therefore in its adorn ment with elements of the S?nkhya-Yoga this view must not be supplanted by the opposite doctrine of the two sys tems. Pious conviction helped to do away with the diffi culties of method which thus arose. In general, however, the religio-philosophical doctrines of the original Bhaga vadg?t?, as the above exposition shows, are of transparent clearness. This clearness is greatly impaired by the pan theistic redaction. The traditional form of the poem in ? Grierson, ERE, II, 544a.</page><page sequence="15">5o8 THE MONIST. which sometimes the personal God (Krishna) and some times the impersonal World Soul (the Brahman) appears as the supreme principle, and both are often identified, in which sometimes the conscious continued existence in the presence of God and sometimes the absorption into the world-soul is set up as the highest goal?is full of intrinsic contradictions. Looking back we find in the Bhagavadg?t? the follow ing agreements with Christian views: 1. Faith in God's love to man and in his mercy and for giveness of sins arising therefrom; 2. The requirement laid upon man of faithful love to God, bhakti.7 From these agreements have arisen all sorts of similari ties of New Testament modes of expression which very naturally suggested the thought of a loan. Lorinser8 has gone the farthest in pursuing this idea when with great decision he expresses his conviction, "that the author of the Bhagavadg?t? not only was acquainted with the writings of the New Testament and made fre quent use of them, but on the whole has woven into his system Christian ideas and views," "that this much ad mired monument of the spirit of ancient India, this most beautiful and loftiest didactic poem which can well be re garded as one of the noblest flowers of pagan wisdom, owes precisely its purest and most highly praised teachings for the most part to Christian sources" (page v). Lorinser even undertakes to show from what writings of the New Testament more and from what fewer "sentences are bor rowed," that "all the epistles of St. Paul with the exception of those to the Thessalonians and to Philemon were uti lized" (page 285), and the like. No one to-day would dare draw such bold conclusions 7 See above, pp. 501, 506. 8 In the introduction, notes and appendix to his metrical translation of the Bhagavadg?t?, Breslau, 1869.</page><page sequence="16">CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS IN THE BHAGAVADGITA. 509 from such very indefinite similarities in thought and ex pression. Even Lorinser would certainly not have allowed his joy in discovery to carry him so far beyond all bounds if he had been more intimately acquainted with the Hindu thought cycles.9 Even A. Weber, though always inclined to a great extent to believe in Christian influences upon India, thinks that Lorinser has greatly overestimated the weight of his argumentation, and that the question whether an acquaintance with the doctrines of Christianity must be assumed for the Bhagavadg?t?, still continues to be sub judice.10 Almost all the other Indologues have completely re jected Lorinser's argumentation, last of all Winternitz11 in whose opinion "not more than twenty-five of the more than one hundred parallel passages from the Gospels which Lorinser compares with passages of the Bhagavadg?t?, are of such a kind that a loan would be conceivable. How ever, in no single case/' Winternitz continues, "is the similarity so close that the assumption of a loan would be any more probable than that of an accidental agreement. Even love of God is not of course limited to Christianity. I will only mention Sufism in which it plays no less sig nificant a part than with the Christian mystics." But the best criticism of Lorinser's theory is furnished by the materials collected by John W. Robertson12 who brings forward from the pre-Christian Greek and Roman literature passages which bear a much greater similarity to New Testament ideas than the verses of the Bhaga vadg?t? which Lorinser compares with them. 9 A particularly striking proof of this deficiency in Lorinser I have men tioned in my translation of the Bhagavadg?t?, page 105, Note 3. 10 Indische Literaturgeschichte, 2d ed., 367. 11 Geschichte der indischen Litteratur, I, 370, Note 3. 13 Christianity and Mythology, London, 1900, 285, cited in van den Bergli van Eysinga, Indische Einfl?sse auf evangelische Ers?hlungen, 2d ed., 21, Note 4.</page><page sequence="17">THE MONIST. Of all the Indologues Hopkins after his change of view13 approaches most closely the standpoint of Lorinser. Hopkins14 has collected a large number of parallels from the Bhagavadg?t? and the New Testament and incidentally has ascribed particular significance to the circumstance that most of them are to be found in the Gospel of John. That in the narrow space of this Gospel so many parallels "partly of surprising similarity" stand side by side, seems to Hopkins in consideration of the more general agree ments in the other Gospels, to be an almost conclusive proof of the dependence of the Bhagavadg?t?. Hopkins explains the partiality for the Fourth Gospel alleged to be observed in the Bhagavadg?t? from the fact that this Gos pel?perhaps not uninfluenced by the gnosticism of that time?was peculiarly suited because of its mystical tone to cause the Indian theologians to borrow such expressions and thoughts as best fitted in with the conception of Krishna as a god of love.15 It would lead too far and would not be worth while to speak in detail of the parallels brought forward by Hop kins after I have already (July Monist) treated more par ticularly of the Christian similarities in other parts of the Mah?bh?rata in which Hopkins considers a loan from the New Testament possible. All those similarities are satisfactorily explained from the intrinsic parallelism of the fundamental religious and philosophical conceptions of the Bhagavadg?t? and the Gospel of John. We shall also see at once that the age of the Indian ideas precludes the assumption that they were borrowed from Christianity. First I will add that Paul Deussen in his translation of the Bhagavadg?t? points out only in the following three verses the passages of the New Testament (in John and u See "Christian Elements in the Mah?bh?rata excepting fhe Bhagavad g?t?," in The Monist of July, 1913, page 337, Note 33. 14 India Old and New, 148-159. 15 India Old and New, 155, 158.</page><page sequence="18">CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS IN THE BHAGAVADGITA. 5 11 Galatians) which are related in sense, without taking into consideration the possibility of a loan.

But those who are devoted to me in love are in me and I in them.16 Bhag., IX, 32: Even those, O Son of Prith?, who are of lowly birth, women, Vaishyas and Shudras, will attain the highest aim, when they take their refuge in me.

I now come to the question, What on the whole is the historical possibility of the assumption of Christian in fluences upon the Bhagavadg?t?? The traditional text belongs to a period in the development of the Mah?bh?rata which Avith Hopkins17 we must place in the time between 200 B. C. and 100-200 A. D. I had thought that I had ascertained for this text (i. e., for the redaction of the Bhagavadg?t? in the pantheistic sense), the second cen tury after Christ and for the composition of the original "Deussen might just as well have named as parallel passages to this verse of the Gospel of John the two following verses of the Bhagavadg?t?, IV, 35 : "Thou wilt not again, so fall into confusion, Oh P?ndava, when thou hast attained the knowledge by which thou wilt perceive creatures without excep tion (first) in thyself and then in me;" and VI, 30: "Who sees me in all things and all things in me, from him will I not be lost nor will he be lost from me." It is clear that these verses of the Bhagavadg?t? express the well known fundamental view of Brahmaism. It is remarkable however that these parallels to John xiv. 20, which are closer than all other agreements with the New Testament brought forward from the Bhagavadg?t?, are entirely lacking in Lorinser's lists of alleged loans. 17 See the introduction to my translation of the Bhagavadg?t?, 58 ff.</page><page sequence="19">512 THE MONIST. poem the second century before Christ.18 A considerable interval must be assumed between the two compositions for the reason that in India they would not have dared until after considerable time had elapsed to transform by such a comprehensive revision and redaction a work which was considered a revelation of deity and was surrounded by the nimbus of the greatest sanctity. But there may be different opinions about the length to be assigned to this interval. However, for the question in hand the problem is of secondary importance since of course the ad herents of the theory of Christian influence can insist that this influence was not felt until the revision of the Bhaga vadg?t?. If the date I have just assigned to the revision is correct it excludes the assumption of Christian influence, because at the very earliest Christianity penetrated into northwestern India at the beginning of the third century. Any considerable shifting of this date to a later time is excluded; nevertheless some scholars like Lassen, Weber, and John Davies place the composition of the text of the Bhagavadg?t? as it has been handed down, in the third century, and for this time to be sure although we cannot grant the probability of Christian influence, there is never theless a remote possibility of it. Moreover since some specialists believe in the historical character of the legend of St. Thomas as far as it concerns the Indo-Iranian borderland and at the same time consider Christian influ ence possible as early as the first century, the proof for the love of God and a loving God in a pre-Christian age must be found here. Scholarly Indians10 claim that the religion of bhakti. "My main reason for the latter date which I derived from the age of the Yoga-s?tras, pp. 62, 63 of my introduction) I can no longer maintain since H. Jacobi has proved in a keen and convincing fashion that the author of the Yogas?tras, Pata?jali, is not identical with the grammarian of the same name and that he can not have written before 450 A.

The statement is certainly not correct in this form for the reason that such a high degree of culture as is necessary to produce the idea of love of God never existed on earth in immemorial times; but still it contains an ele ment of truth, for bhakti did not, as Grierson once errone ously said,20 make its appearance directly and like a flash of lightning as something quite new whereby knowledge (of the alleged truth) has been forced out of its dominant position in religion, but in its beginnings and earliest im pulses it may be traced back to ancient Vedic times.21 In the Rigveda where the gods are often called father, brother, friend, etc. and are supplicated for health and protection in all sorts of expressions of childish confidence, the ancient poets were prompted to use these words from the same feelings that joined them to the human beings who were most closely related to them. When monotheistic tenden cies had gained the upper hand, this old feeling of naive affection for the gods was gradually ennobled and exalted to a submissive, devout and confiding love of God which filled the whole personality. Love of God first became the pinnacle and center of religious life among the sect of the Bh?gavatas out of which Krishnaism arose; it seems also to have received the name bhakti among the Bh?gavatas as this word is derived from the same root as Bhagavat and Bh?gavata. From P?nini's grammar (IV, 3, 95, 98) it follows that at the time of its composition bhakti was not only used in the secular sense of "love, submission, devotion," but that it was also applied to men's relations with God. j?va and the Bh?gavata or P?nchar?tra Systems," before the Aryan section of the Congress of Orientalists at Vienna in 1888.

The connection of the word with \r?sudeva in rule 98 is a proof which is now indisputable since Grierson has defi nitely refuted Kielhorn's view that Vasudeva in this pas sage is not the name of a god, but of a human person.22 Heretofore it has been generally supposed that Panini lived about 300 B. C., but there was not a positive proof for this date. Now from Jacobi's study of the Kautiliya23 we know with certainty that Panini was recognized as a grammatical authority as early as the fourth century B. C. Accordingly in its religious signification 'bhakti, because mentioned by Panini, must have been a generally current concept in India about 400 B. C. Therefore it is not at all necessary to assign a later date to the Shvet?shvatara Upanishad because of its concluding verse, "He who feels the highest love to God (yasya deve para bhaktih). . . When Hopkins says24 : "The doctrine of bhakti, faith ful love as a means of salvation, can not be much older than the Song" (i. e., the Bhagavadg?t?), we must on the contrary emphasize that it may have been proclaimed in the circle of Krishna worshipers centuries before the composition of the original Bhagavadg?t?. A new doc trine is submitted differently than the bhakti in the Bhaga vadg?t? where this sentiment is required throughout as a matter of course. It is found also in the closest connection with the doctrine of devotion (yoga) which in the begin ning of the fourth song Krishna expressly characterizes as very ancient. The assumption that the use of the word bhakti in its ^JRAS, 1909, 1122. See also R. G. Bhandarkar, loc. cit., 1910, 168-170. Edmund Hardy, in the Lit. Centralblatt, 1903, col. 1269, has further called attention to the fact that bhakti (in the P?li form bhatti) appears in J?taka V, 340, 3, 6, and 352, 11, denoting "love, devotion/' and with regard to the transition to the specific meaning, love of God, has referred to Therag?th?, verse 370. Hence we have here from the far south a further proof that the Indian idea of the love of God is older than Christianity. 23 Sitzungsberichte der .

The idea was very improbable from the first because distinct traces of the religious senti ment which Hindus call bhakti are to be found also in the Greek and Roman religions in pre-Christian times.25 In this respect the Indians, who from the earliest days have always taken the salvation of the soul more seriously than most other peoples, have certainly not remained behind the Greeks and Romans in development. The idea of Krishna as a loving God must also have been as old as that of the love of God; for each of these ideas is dependent on the other. Only a loving God could demand love. But a loving God also shows mercy and by forgiving sins delivers from perdition otherwise un avoidable. Although pras?da, the usual word for the grace of God first appears in the later Upanishads26 and in the passages of the Bhagavadg?t? cited above (p. 501), yet the idea of divine grace itself is much older. Without it the countless prayers of the Vedic poets for all manner of divine favors would not have been possible. Hopkins27 instances as a particularly characteristic case the verse in the Rigveda (10, 125, 5) where speech (V?ch) per sonified as a goddess declares "Whom I love I shall make a man of*power, a priest, a seer, a sage." Hand in hand \vith the victorious advance of the mono theistic faith in a loving God must have gone the develop ment of the doctrine of his grace. "The doctrine of pra s?da, or grace, has formed an essential part of the Bh?ga vata religion so far back as literature takes us," says Grier 28 Barth, Religions de finde, 132; A. Berriedale Keith, JRAS, 1907, 490. ^Kath., , 2, 20; Shvet, 3, 20; 6, 21; Mund., 3, 2, 3 (Hopkins, Great Epic, 188). It is probable that we have here a loan from the Bh?gavata re ligion since the idea of mercy does not harmonize with the Upanishad doc trine of the pantheistic Brahman.

The seemingly Christian coloring of the Bhagavadgita and of those later portions of the Mah?bh?rata whose con tents are akin to it, must therefore in consideration of all that I have here set forth be characterized as an out growth of genuine Indian religious feeling.
