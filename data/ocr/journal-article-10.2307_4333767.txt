<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vivian Mercier THE LIMITATIONS OF FLAUBERT THE FRENCH and the English have grown more than a little impatient with Flaubert of late. The best Martin Turnell can say of him in The Novel in France, after amply documenting his "immaturity," is that "he seems to me to be a great technician, a great literary engineer rather than a great novelist." The Times Literary Supplement (September 17, I954) quotes without strong dissent "a dismissive paragraph which leaves very little to admire" from Histoire de la litt6rature franfaise by Kleber Haedens. Henri Peyre, in The Contemporary Fresnch Novel, lists Proust, Valery, Gide and-"more blatantly unjust"-Malraux and Sartre as severe critics of Flaubert before coming to the conclusion that "it is doubtful whether he will ever be restored to a supreme place." Yet the books on Flaubert keep coming. Two of the four' that I have read recently-Earp and Stonier's far-from-new transla- tion of Bouvard et Pecuchet and Philip Spencer's sober biography -first appeared in England. The other two, Francis Steegmuller's wholly admirable Selected Letters and Jacques Barzun's labor- of-love version of the Dictionnaire des idees rerues, show, as does Lionel Trilling's ingenious new introduction to Bouvard et Pecu- chet, how extremely fruitful the attachment to Flaubert of an older generation of American writers and teachers continues to be. Mr. Barzun's devoted attempt to translate the untranslatable from one period and culture to another seems to me a waste of his great talents, but no doubt everything by Flaubert ought to i.

Those limitations, rather than his equally real gifts, fill my mind after a moderately conscientious re-reading of Flaubert.2 They can be studied most instructively in L'tducation sentimen- tale, that desert of ennui, which I am happy to have re-read, if only for the reassurance that I need nevcr read it again. To point-as Martin Turnell and Henry James, among others, have done-to the utter nullity of Frederic Moreau as a hero does not sufficiently explain the aridity of L'Education. That Frederic is homme de toutes les faiblesses, as his creator calls him in a moment of exasperation and un-Flaubertian subjectivity, con- stitutes the book's one profound irony. Flaubert intended this Histoire d'un jeune homme (the sub-title) to be, like Vanity Fair, a "novel without a hero." True, the comic Arnoux, a sort of Bloom-plus-Blazes-Boylan, threatens to fill the vacuum left by Frederic. If the book had a hero, this cheerful and ultimately unsuccessful crook would be he. Flaubert himself may have put hiis finger on the true reason for the failure of L'Iducation in a letter to Mme. Roger des Genettes written in I879, ten years after the book had appeared: Why hasn't that book had the success I expected? Perhaps Robin has discovered the reason? It is too true to life, and aesthetically speaking it lacks the falseness of perspective. (Carrespondence, IV, 334.) By la faussete de la perspective I do not think he meant "false perspective," but rather that all perspective involves distortion, the deliberate practice of an optical deceit upon the spectator. From the common-sense viewpoint, things do not get smaller as they get farther away-they only seem to. The rest of the passage 2. I have just now read or re-read the following: Salammbd' and L'Idducation senti- nzentale (both Paris, Nelson, I95I), Trois Contes (Paris, Nelson), La Tentatioa de Saint-Antoine (London, Dent), Correspondance entre George Sand et Gustave Flau(bert (Paris, Calmann-.L:vy), and the fourth volume of the Bibliotheque-Charpentier edition of the Correspondance. I have made my own translations where necessary in this paper.</page><page sequence="3">402 FLAU BERT will help clarify Flaubert's meaning: The plan has been so well drawn up that it becomes invisible. Every work of art must have a point, a summit, constitute a pyramid-or, let's say, the light must strike one point on the sphere. Now, in life there's nothing of all this. But art isn't nature. No matter: I don't think anyone has pushed integrity further. The phrase "constitute a pyramid" (faire la pyramidc) and the idea of the light striking the sphere seem to confirm my interpre- tation of la faussete' de la perspective. False or not, the use of perspective in painting implies some kind of moral "perspective" or it remains a meaningless technical device. A proper use of perspective will relegate to the back- ground elements which belong there; Flaubert, however, with his wide-ranging contempt for all aspects of igth Century Europe, cannot decide on which elements to bring forward and which to push back. The focus in L'Pducation fluctuates constantly, with disastrous results. George Sand frequently reproached Flaubert for his lack of "a firmly established and comprehensive view of life." He replied on one occasion, "You are right a thousand times over." But he refused to touch up the picture of life as he saw it: "I have deliberately turned away from the adventitious and the dramatic. No monsters and no heroes!" In a letter of January 12, 1876, discussing Flaubert's work in general as well as L'Jducation, George Sand had the last word in this particular exchange of views: supreme impartiality is an anti-human thing and a novel must above all be human. If it is not, no one feels at all grateful to it for being well written, well composed, and full of accurately observed detail. It lacks the essential quality: interest. In a postscript three days later she added, ". . . give up the convention of the realists and return to the true reality." We may dispute endlessly about the primary reason for lack of perspective in L'Iducation (and in most of Flaubert's other</page><page sequence="4">VIVIAN MERCIER 403 work). Some will say that perspective was omitted on principle, others that Flaubert was making a virtue of necessity. We can hardly, however, deny that perspective is lacking. How, then, justify Flaubert's remarks about hiis "plan"? Let me put it this way: in order to build a pyramid, one must first draw both a ground plan and an elevation; L'Education possesses the former, but not the latter. So far from being "in- visible," the way in which Frederic's sentimental education is made to mesh with public events becomes glaringly obvious at times. He rebels against his long platonic attachment to Mme. Arnoux and sleeps with Rosanette for the first time on the eve of the overthrow of Louis Philippe in I848; the sale of Mme. Arnoux's effects, which leads to his break with Mme. Dambreuse and his return to Mme. Arnoux, takes place on December x, I85I, the eve of Louis Napoleon's coup d'6tat; next day France too followed the rebellion of three years before by a reaction. The successive stages of whatever "education" Frederic re- ceives are pat in other ways also. Mme. Arnoux is both mother- substitute and inaccessible goal; Rosanette is a mistress, desirable and enjoyable for her own sake; Mme. Dambreuse, neither a remote goal nor an immediate end, serves only as a means to further Frederic's temporary social and political ambitions. Both France and Frederic, losing whatever idealism they once pos- sessed, become so far corrupted as to confuse means with ends. Since Frederic's ambitions are as unreal as everything else about him, he eventually reverts permanently to his mother-fixation (as France does to her Napoleon-fixation?). Note also the class backgrounds of the three women: Rosanette is working-class, Mme. Arnoux lower-middle-class, and Mme. Dambreuse upper- middle-class. Frederic's last remaining shreds of credibility have been sacrificed to this neat political allegory. Worse still, a surprisingly good political novel has been sacrificed to his spineless love-affairs. To prove this, it is only necessary to mention Senecal, a relatively</page><page sequence="5">404 FLAUBERT minor character. He begins as a doctrinairc republican and egali- tarian socialist, goes to jail after the defeat of the working-class insurrection in June I848, turns Bonapartist soon after his release, cries "Long live tyranny, provided that the tyrant does good," and is last seen as a mounted policeman striking down the humanitarian republican Dussardier, his former friend and comrade-in-arms, who is protesting against Louis Napoleon's coup d'etat. There in a nutshell lies European history of the igth and 20th Centuries. So much for the ground plan of L'18ducation. To document the absence of a third dimension, let us examine one scene which would become a climax-perhaps the climax-in any other novel: Frederic's break with Mme. Dambreuse. Flaubert has set this "romantic" crisis against a wholly unromantic background- the sale of Mme. Arnoux's personal effects by public auction. If irony was intended, it fails to come through, unlike the irony of the famous scenes in Madame Bovary where Rodolphe makes fake love to Emma against the background of the agricultural prize-giving. The weakness of the auction scene is that Flaubert writes like the sentimental bourgeois he intends Frederic to be. In spite of himself, Flaubert too regards the passing from hand to hand of Mme. Arnoux's underwear as a profanation. The humor of the scene appears nowhere in the writing: When Fr6deric entered, petticoats, fichus, handkerchiefs and even chemises were being passed from hand to hand and turned over and over; sometimes they were thrown from a distance, and suddenly something white would fly through the air. Afterwards her dresses were sold, then one of her hats, from which a broken feather dangled, then her furs, then three pairs of boots; and the dividing up of thesc relics, in which he confusedly recognized the shapes of her limbs, seemed to him an atrocity, as though he had seen crows tearing her corpse in pieces. '"hat las that last forced image to do with the sentimental rub- bish that precedes it? Nothing, if the scene is conceived in a</page><page sequence="6">VIVIAN MERCIER 405 spirit of irony. Everything, if Flaubert's psychic make-up and bourgeois upbringing cause hiim to see real heartbreak in such an invasion of le chez-soi. II The lack of perspective noticeable in the structure of L'Education may be seen also at the grammatical level in Flaubert's mature style. In abandoning the periodic style for a more impressionistic one, Flaubert has abandoned the hierarchical arrangement of ideas that goes with the former. We no longer find subordinate i(leas arranged in subordinate clauses, nor the main idea set forth in the main clause; instead, we have innumerable brief inde- pendent clauses separated only by commas and shepherded into groups by semi-colons. A number of observations and affirmations are thus set down side by side, but little effort is made to establish their relative importance. Flaubert's mastery of ca(lence prevents us from realizing that most of his long "sentences" are not in fact periodic. They sound like periods, but there th-e resemblance ceases. Ford Madox Ford an(l Ezra Pound, among others, have praised Flaubert's skill in the juxtaposition of incongruous or quite unrelated ideas for more or less ironic effect. The films, however, have long since domesticated this technique of omitting transitions, which is basic to the compositioni of Cantos, making it far more commonplace than it may have seemed when that poem was begun. I think it is fair to Pound to say that he has exalted this technique into a principle; about the correctness of the principle I have the gravest (loubts. In late Flaubert-Trois Contes. say-it is certainly more of a mannerism than anything else: They were served with beef kidneys, dormice, nightingales, mince- meat wrapped in vine-leaves; and the priests were arguing about resurrection. (Trois Contes, p. 260).</page><page sequence="7">406 FLAUBERT That kind of writing appeals to a fairly immature taste; further- more, it leads the reader to seek irony where none may be in- tended. What are we to make of the last sentence in the follow- ing passage about the saint's mother from La Ligende de saint Julien l'hospitalier? She was very white-skinned, a little proud and serious. . . . Her domestic economy was regulated like the interior of a monastery; each morning she apportioned their tasks to her maids, supervised the making of preserves and unguents, spun with a distaff or embroidered altar-cloths. By dint of prayers to God she obtained a son. (Trois Contes). The whole conte is usually viewed as a sincere piece of what in England would be called Pre-Raphaelitism; this view may be incorrect, but if it isn't, Flaubert's irony has become a habit rather hard to shake off. (Note, by the way, that there is not a single subordinate clause in the paragraph quoted above.) The encyclopedic subject-matter of Bouvard et P6cuchet, Flaubert's last book, makes such a style almost mandatory. Little tabloids of misinformation patter constantly upon the reader's head, until Flaubert parodies his own style on almost every page. Since he never finished or revised this book, it would be unfair to quote from it. After all, the same tendency can be detected as early as L'Tducation. This, for example, from the death of Rosanette's son: Les meubles etaient renverse's. Deux ou trois scrviettes trainalent. Six heures sonnerent. La veilleuse s'eteignit. (P. 538). Any literal translation must sound bathetic because bathos is inherent in the wrlting: The furniture was overturned. Two or three towels lay about. Six o'clock struck. The nightlight went out. Painters-Monet for example-who accepted Impressionist doctrine wholeheartedly have always been criticized because their</page><page sequence="8">VIVIAN MERCIER 407 pictures, though crowded with faithful notations of reality, offer no one point in the composition where the eye can rest and around which the remainder of the picture can be focused. Similar criticism may be levelled against the structure of Flau- bert's novels and against his sentence style. Just as the Post- Impressionists stressed composition in their paintings in reaction against the Impressionists, so Proust's reversion to the periodic style may have been partly due to a conscious reaction against the style of Flaubert. III Flaubert's limitations in the structural and stylistic disposition of his materials must stem in part from his method of obtaining those materials. The much-advertised research he did for Salammbo was insignificant beside the load of information and misinformation that he had to take aboard for his espece d'encyclopedie critique en farce. According to Philip Spencer the documentation for Bouvard et Pe'cuchet "comprises over II,OOO pages of plans and drafts, and sixty dossiers of notes." Flaubert's need to write books which demanded research is ultimately more significant than his overloading of creative works with the results of his scholarship. His first major work, the earliest of three versions of La Tentation de saint Antoine, was also the first to require an orgy of erudition. Even a novel of contemporary life like L'Tducation suffers from excessive research; witness the passage where Mme. Arnoux insists on showing Frederic over her husband's ceramics factory outside Paris. After two pages of technical terms-which cost Flaubert much research, as he complains in one of his letters- "Frederic was beginning to get bored." The reader, not being in the company of the woman he loves, reaches the same point at least a page ahead of Frederic; once again the background has forced its way into the foreground. Flaubert seems deliberately to have primed himself for this passage, but there are others</page><page sequence="9">408 FLAUBERT where I feel that he has put in unnecessary details simply because he couldn't bear to waste them. (Joyce and Pound often give me the same impression: they do not distinguish sharply enough between the necessary and the available.) Did Flaubert feel incapable of holding the reader's interest through a love story only, and therefore invade the political and social fields to give his novel substance? Personally, I do not think so. I believe the following passage from Chapter V of Bouvard et Pecuchet expresses Flaubert's own view: They took it in turns to read aloud La Nouvelle He'loise, Delphine, Adolphe, Ourika. But the yawns of the one who was listening proved contagious to the other, who soon let the book slip from his hands to the floor. They found fault with all these for saying nothing about the surroundings, the period, the dress of the characters. Only the heart is dealt with; always sentiment, as if there were nothing else in the world. (P. J53.) "The surroundings, the period, the dress of the characters"- why must these be included? Historical "documentation" alone is sufficient reason for Flaubert, I would say. Mr. Turnell attempts a symbolic interpretation of Flaubert's imagery in certain pass- ages of Madaine Bovary, but in my opinion the conscious intent of Flaubert's use of sensory detail is primarily to achieve veri- similitude. Only in the "plan" of a novel-e.g., L'Iducation, as outlined above-does one find him showing a conscious pre- occupation with symbol or, at least, allegory. Doubtless the bric- a-brac in Felicite's room (Un Coeur simple) has symbolic value of a rather elementary kind, but the mounds of detail in Bovary an(l L'Tducation rarely stand for anything but themselves. No, that's not quite fair. In Bovary-and this is the book's salvation-virtually every detail carries a double weight, for each contributes its glint of irony to Flaubert's splenetic vision of pro- vincial life. That life was close enough to him to make hiis ambi- valent feelings of love and hate give each phrase its own electrical</page><page sequence="10">VIVIAN MERCIER 409 charge. All the loving care of a Dutch master is lavished on details each of which is a nail in the coffin of mocurs de province -the sub-title of the novel. Take Emma's wedding cake, for instance: It started off at the base with a square of blue cardboard representing a temple with porticoes and colonnades, with stucco statuettes all round it in recesses studded with gilt-paper stars; on the second layer was a castle-keep in Savoy cake, surrounded by tiny fortifications in angelica, almonds, raisins and quarters of orange; and finally, on the uppermost platform, which was a green meadow with rocks, pools of jam and boats of nutshell, stood a little Cupid, poised on a chocolate swing whose uprights had two real rosebuds for knobs at the top.3 I confess I cannot extract any deep allegoric or symbolic sig- nificance from temple, castle and pastoral Cupid. The description reveals the cake as ugly, banal, sentimental, and probably in- digestible; no doubt Flaubert felt that matrimony en province resembled the cake in all these respects. The irony lies in the fact that the guests accept this monstrosity as a perfectly appropriate symbol of all that they value in marriage. Perhaps the pastry- cook intended the temple to imply the sanctity of marriage, the castle its stability, and Cupid on the swing its pleasures. The marriage of Emma and Charles was destined to possess none of these characteristics; but did Flaubert intend the cake to fore- shadow their destiny? I doubt it. If my view of Flaubert is cor- rect, he did no more than describe a peculiarly hideous cake which he had seen in some Rouen store window. Although Joyce and Mann imitate Flaubert in their use of real-life documenta- tion, they make it serve a symbolic purpose as well, diverging from Flaubert's practice toward, for example, Melville's. A wedding cake is, of course. a ready-made symbol; even more so is a wedding bouquet. Flaubert makes play with two 3. Madame Bovary, tr. Alan Russell (Penguin Books, 1950), pp. 41-2. The three "with's" in the first clause would have nauseated Flaubert.</page><page sequence="11">410 FLAUBERT of the latter, one being that of Charles' first wife, the other Emma's own. Rarely, however, does he confer symbolic meaning on a normally non-symbolic object such as the Vicomte's cigar case. When he turns to the Parisian scene in L'Education, he often sees it with the naive, dazzled eye of a provincial-as Balzac so frequently does. The long account of the masquerade at Ro- sanette's lacks symbolic overtones, and even irony-perhaps be- cause it is seen through Frederic's eyes rather than Flaubert's. At any rate, the love-hate polarity does not generate enough current for even the mildest shock. The publication of Flaubert's Dictionary of Accepted Ideas reminds us that if Flaubert too often confused the task of the novelist with that of the compiler, his favorite form of compila- tion was the sottisier. Mr. Steegmuller, by including a letter of December 3I, 1830, in his selection, shows us that Flaubert com- menced his encyclopedia of human folly at the age of nine: And since there's a lady who comes to see papa and always says stupid things, I'll write them too. What a crushing sense of inferiority he must have suffered to spend so much of his life recording absurdities from common speech, classic authors and scientific writers! Perhaps he felt in- ferior to the two doctors in his family-his father and his elder brother, Achille-and tried to prove the inadequacy of all scien- tific and professional knowledge. Why is Charles, the chief butt in Madame Bovary, an incompetent medical man, specifically? Flaubert's implied contempt for almost all the characters in his novels may be a form of compensation for this sense of inferiority. Yet he achieved one successful sottisier-not Bouvard, not the Dictionnaire, but the final published version of La Tentation, which mocks the learning of the 4th Century rather than that of the i9th. It may yet prove to have greater staying power than any other of his works. He once called it "a dramatic exposition</page><page sequence="12">VIVIAN MERCIER 411 of the Alexandrian world in the fourth century." What an odd recipe for a book, one thinks-and the book is as odd as the recipe. Flaubert has managed to write what is essentially an expository work in dramatic form; the dramatic technique speeds up the exposition amazingly, as in the fourth section, where the Heresiarchs confute one another simply by stating their conflict- ing views in turn. The fifth section, in which the gods die one by one, takes the reader by storm. Its audacious conception has only one dis- advantage: the earlier, non-anthropomorphic gods of necessity file past without saying anything, reducing the dramatist's func- tion to the provision of an immensely long stage direction. Later in the scene, the technique yields its dividends. Instead of in- forming the reader in a dry footnote that the Romans had a god of stomach gas, Flaubert allows Crepiltus (i.e., crepitus ventri) to mourn his lost glory in Rabelaisian detail: Les vases dor, comme des tympanons, rLsonnaient sous moi;-et quand plein de muranes, de trufles et de pdtts, lintestin du maitre se d6gageait avec fracas, l'univers attentif apprenait que Cesar avait di'nt! His final cry is truly pathetic: "But now I am confined to the rabble-and people cry out in horror at my very name!" Char- acteristically, as Crepitus exits, a peal of thunder heralds the voice of Jehovah. He is followed in turn by Hilarion, the Me- phistopheles of this Faust, whose creed-again characteristically- proves to be Science. I think Flaubert succeeds in proving that dramatic presentation offers certain advantages even in an encyclopedic work. IV Flaubert himself has provided us with a revealing metaphor for his working method, whether as compiler or as novelist. Speak- ing of authors who are not "great men"-himself included-he</page><page sequence="13">412 FLAUBERT writes: "We have to pile up a lot of little pebbles to build our pyramid . . ." (Steegmuller, p. 149). He hoarded these "little pebbles" as other men hoard coins-the bigger the pile the better. As he told Turgenev when the latter urged him not to treat the subject of Bouvard et Pecuchet at any great length, "I can never write anything short" (Steegmuller, p. 247). Even when a book is complete, he is very reluctant to part with it by publishing. And he is almost pathological, like Joyce, about editorial diminu- tion of his hoard. He writes thus to Laurent-Pichat, who pub- lished Madame Bovary in the Revue de Paris: I will not make a correction, not a cut; I will not suppress a comma; nothing, nothing! (Steegmuller, p. i8i). As a matter of fact, he hoarded his unpublished works: I am bored by my own sentences; and if I keep those that I have written it is because I like to surround myself with memories-just as I never sell my old clothes. I go to look at those writings sometimes in the attic where I keep them, and I dream of the time when they were new and of everything I did when I was pregnant with them (Steeg- muller, p. 64). Old clothes and old writings were not the only things he hoarded: He collected bric-a-brac of all kinds-amulets, primitive musical in- struments, arrows, copper plates, glass necklaces, Greek and Egyptian arms, plaster masks, and mouldings of bas-reliefs. He even kept an old hat of his mother's to fondle from time to time . . . (Spencer, p. 210). The last trait reminds us of Felicite' in Un Coeur sigtnple. He hoarded mementoes of the living as well as the dead: This is the hour when, alone amidst everything that sleeps, I open the drawer that holds my treasures. I look at your slippers, your handker- chief, your hair, your portrait, I reread your letters and breathe their musky perfume (Steegmuller, p. 59).</page><page sequence="14">VIVIAN MERCIER 413 How long had he been separated from Louise Colet when he wrote this? Since Tuesday at midday, and it was now II p.m. on Saturday. How long had their love affair lasted, that he had acquired so many souvenirs? Since Wednesday of the previous week. But this hoarding tendency goes deeper yet; he hoards him- self. "When two persons love," he tells Louise, "they can go ten years without seeing each other and without suffering any ill effects therefrom." The thought that Louise might have a child by him prostrates him physically (Steegmuller, p. 145). Even his sexual continence, so frequently attested in the letters, may well be described as a hoarding of himself. He provides us with a metaphor for his own continence: The marvelous fluids of love have seethed in me too furiously ever to escape, and this has made me impotent (Steegmuller, p. 37). About the only thing he was not miserly with was money. Although not usually extravagant, he gave away huge sums to his niece Caroline when her husband got into financial difficulties. The related trait of orderliness Flaubert displayed to a per- haps pathological degree: He was tyrannically tidy, with books, paper, and quills each in its proper place; if a penknife was mislaid he seethed with fury, and the visit of a friend or a trip to Paris or Trouville so disorganized him that it might be days or even weeks before he could recapture his mood and train of thought (Spencer, p. I36). In one of his letters he says, "I read or write regularly from eight to ten hours a (lay; and if I am disturbed it makes me ill." One cause of his ambivalent feelings toward Louise Colet from the very beginning of their relationship was the disturbance she created in his mental and physical habits: Before I knew you I was calm. .. . I had arrived at an understanding of everything in myself, I had sorted it all, classified it all, with the</page><page sequence="15">414 FLAUBERT result that I was more at peace than at any previous period of my existence. . . . Then you came along, and with the mere touch of a fingertip you threw everything into confusion (Steegmuller, p. 6i). Only an orderly man could have created the "invisible" and rigid plan of L'18ducation or found a place in it for everything that he had accumulated in his notes. At the same time, his overloaded books would be quite unreadable if it were not for their extremely orderly and logical development. George Sand constantly took issue with Flaubert's orderliness and his completely cerebral method of work. Their entire cor- respondence-about 450 pages in French-is a continuous dia- lectic between two opposite temperaments, two conflicting views of the nature of art and the artist. In a letter dated November 29, i866, George Sand sums up her own method of composition as follows: The wind plays my old harp as it pleases. It has its highs and lows, its loud notes and its false ones; it's all the same to me at bottom, provided the emotion comes, but I can find nothing in myself. It's the other who sings at his good pleasure, well or ill, and when I try to think about this, I get frightened by it and say that I myself am nothing, nothing at all.... She goes on to offer Flaubert some well-meant advice: Let the wind, then, play over your strings a little (Laissez donc Ic vent courir un peu dans tos cordes). I think you take more trouble than you ought and that you should give the other his head a little more often. In other words, he should let his unconscious take control from time to time. But he had tried that in the first version of La Tentation, and the results had been disastrous, according to his friends Louis Bouilhet and Maxime Du Camp. His temperament might limit him, forcing him to be cerebral rather than intuitive, but it was better to accept its limitations.</page><page sequence="16">VIVIAN MERCIER 415 Sand and Flaubert each lacked what the other possessed. As the pendulum of taste swings, she may yet be set above him; at any rate, she is a much better writer than my generation was taught to believe. Try some of the nouvelles: Pauline or La Marquise. And if there have to be idylls of rural life, La Mare au diable is as well written as an idyll can be. Orderliness is within her scope, at least in her shorter works, but not miser- liness. She squanders herself in her books, exploiting any tremor of passion she has ever felt. "Orderliness, parsimoniousness and obstinacy" make up a familiar Freudian triad. The fact remains that Flaubert's char- acter exhibits the third of these traits in close conjunction with the first two-as we saw in his stubborn refusal to permit dele- tions from the text of Madame Bovary. His stubbornness is fur- ther documented in Mr. Spencer's accounts of the battles Flaubert fought for the honor of his friends after they were dead. His long but victorious struggle to have a monument erected to Bouilhet in their native Rouen might well provide the skeleton for a Flaubertian novel. He could fight stubbornly in his own behalf too when cor- nered, as Mr. Steegmuller's selection from his letters at the time of the Madame Bovary prosecution amply demonstrates. Indeed, Flaubert's whole literary career-especially when compared with the time-serving of Du Camp, who parlayed his meager talent into an Academy fauteuil-is a study in stubbornness. He would not compromise any of his standards for the sake of popularity. This exemplary quality in his life-"Saint Flaubert" he has been called more than once-has led us all to overrate his work. V One final limitation may best be described as a moral one. Henry James summed up the charge in these words: Why did Flaubert choose, as special conduits of the life he chose to</page><page sequence="17">416 FLAU BERT depict, such inferior and in the case of Frederic such abject human specimens? . . . we are forced to believe it to have been by a defect of his mind. And that sign of weakness remains even if it be objected that the images in question were addressed to his purpose better than others would have been: the purpose itself then shows as inferior. (The Art of Fiction and Other Essays. New York, Oxford, 1948, PP. 135-6.) Though James speaks of a defect of Flaubert's mind at one point and juxtaposes images with purpose at another, thus implying that he is criticizing Flaubert's aesthetic purpose, his choice of such words as inferior, abject, and weakness suggests that con- sciously or unconsciously he is making a moral judgment rather than an intellectual or aesthetic one. At best he is saying that a book about morally inferior people will be inferior aesthetically. George Sand had no scruples about judging works of art from a moral standpoint; in discussing L':ducation she com- plained of "the absence of action by the characters upon them- selves. They endured events and never took command of them." This tendency she compared with the positive behavior of Shake- speare's characters, who always overcome circumstances, for good or evil. Now, Flaubert himself had foreseen precisely such a criticism while the book was still in progress and had voiced his misgivings in a letter to George Sand herself (November i, 1867). His defense against all such charges was that he refused to falsify the record: . . .will such flabby (mous) characters be interesting? Great effects are only arrived at with simple things, with clear-cut passions. But I see simplicity nowhere in the modern world. Does the fault lie with Flaubert or with the modern world? It is worth recalling that Dostoevsky, like Flaubert, was born in 1821 and brought up in a hospital annex; the Russian never seems to have found such difficulty in arriving at great effects. Flaubert was on safer ground in saying, as he did more than once, that</page><page sequence="18">VIVIAN MERCIER 417 "one does not choose one's subjects, they force themselves on one." His books were what they were because he was what he was, though he rationalized his shortcomings so brilliantly in his correspondence that many novelists of quite opposite tempera- ment have been misled by his example into writing with an impersonality and lack of emphasis foreign to their natural gifts. At times he could be very frank about his shortcomings, which he understood at least as well as anybody who has ever written on him. When writing Madame Bovary he stated: I shall never go very far; I know my limitations. But the goal I have set for myself will be achieved by others: thanks to me someone more talented, more instinctive, will be set on the right path. It is perhaps absurd to want to give prose the rhythm of verse (keeping it dis- tinctly prose, however) and to write of ordinary life as one writes history or epic (but without falsifying the subject). I often wonder about this. But on the other hand it is perhaps a great experiment, and very original too. I know where I fail. (Ah, if I were only fifteen!) No matter: I shall always be given some credit for my stubbornness. And then, who can tell? Some day I may find a good motif, an air completely suited to my voice, neither too high nor too low. In any case I shall have lived nobly and often delightfully (Steeg- muller, p. 148). For all his seeming arrogance, he must have put a low valuation on both his talent and his character. But his whole life was dedi- cated to refuting George Sand's proposition that: "Our work never has any value save in so far as we are ourselves of value." He hoped it was possible to create works of art that would stand by themselves regardless of whether their creator, Gustave Flau- bert, were a latter-day saint or a mufle-a cad-like most of the human creatures he saw around him or put into his books.</page></plain_text>
