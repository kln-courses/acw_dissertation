<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Gannet.-Bryan Nelson. 1978. Vermillion, South Dakota, Buteo Books. First published in 1978 by T. &amp; A. D. Poyser Ltd., Berkhamsted, England. 336 pp. Illustrations by John Busby, 62 figures (many illustrations), 32 tables, 32 black-and-white plates. Cloth. $25.00-This book provides an excel- lent, if somewhat anthropomorphic, introduction to the Sulidae and summary of the known data on the Gannet (Sula bassana). It seems unusual for a scientist to write two books on the same subject and have them appear in the same year published by three publishers. However, such publications invite com- parison as well as needing review (see review of "The Sulidae," 1978, J. Bryan Nelson, Oxford; Auk 96: 634-637, 1979). This book stands well by itself. Bryan Nelson is THE student of this family and his work will stand as an example for all seabird ornithologists. Apparently published for the interested amateur, the book serves that purpose well. The chapters deal with morphology, numbers and distribution, breeding be- havior, ecology, the Gannet at sea (really migration and band recoveries), the other Sulidae (Pelecani- formes only very briefly), and the Gannet and man. The chapter on numbers and distribution seems excessive for the audience and much is repeated in "The Sulidae" in more detail, yet some interesting aspects are found only in this book (see portions on the Bempton colony, for instance). The other chapters give fine summaries of information. The John Busby drawings here are excellent and add importantly to the popularizing of this text. I suspect that the drawings reproduced here were, in fact, the rough sketches for "The Sulidae," where many of them appear in more finished form. Numerous instances of repetition exist between the two books. A comparison of, for instance, the summaries of breeding ecology on pp. 195-198 here with pp. 157-158 of "The Sulidae," clearly indicates the similarity of the books. Additionally, compare Fig. 15d (p. 100) and Fig. 21 (p. 129) here with Fig. 83 (p. 192) and Fig. 88 (p. 205) in "The Sulidae." The photos in this text are excellent, many of which are repeated in "The Sulidae." Number 6 is especially interesting since it is a reverse image of the Sule Stack of Fig. 9 (p. 42) in "The Sulidae." What is the correct orientation? Most of the figures are likewise repeats from "The Sulidae." I checked the first 30 and only 4 are new. The book concludes with several excellent tables, many again from "The Sulidae" but with some additional data presented here. This book was apparently written before "The Sulidae." On p. 58 it is noted that the "latest count" is 482 nests in 1974, but on p. 35. of "The Sulidae" the "latest count" was 432 nests in 1976. Perhaps one or both are typos, as the reference given for the 1974 count is a paper by Young listed with a 1968 publication date in the references. Nelson tends to make dogmatic statements when, in fact, he should be somewhat cautious and en- courage further studies. For instance, on p. 306, Table 18, many assumptions are presented as the "gospel." I trust that Nelson is continuing the studies which will provide the data for accuracy beyond these assumptions. The concluding literature cited section provides a new methodology, including the "references," an "annotated select bibliography," and a "bibliography." This book should be welcome to those who cannot afford "The Sulidae," and it does provide a good short summary. I believe that both books are necessary for a complete understanding of the state of the sulid art in the mid-1970s. While Nelson has performed a tremondous service in summarizing all his knowledge in these publications, the reader must remember that the last word has not been written, or the last interpretation formed, on the gannets and boobies. Hopefully, Bryan Nelson will continue to make his major contributions to our understanding of this family and marine ornithology.-RALPH W. SCHREIBER.</page></plain_text>
