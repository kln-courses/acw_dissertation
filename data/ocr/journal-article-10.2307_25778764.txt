BENDA, 1873-1948 The exhibition of "Exotic Drawings and Theatrical Masks" by W. T. Benda, December 1992 to March 1993 at Illustration House in New York City,1 brought to fruition the present article.2 It is a reminiscence, coinciding with the 120th anniversary of Benda's birth, of the unique, multifaceted oeuvre he produced in his half-century in the United States. A review in the early 1920s noted that Benda's work showed "not only brilliance of technical method, but his inherent imaginative quality."3 Critic Frederic Taraba, writing seventy years later, observed that Benda's "visionary approach to illustration is why Benda's creations have stood the test of time, why his images remain fresh to the modern eye."4 Wladyslaw Teodor Benda, Polish-born (in Poznan, on January 16, 1873) American painter, designer and illustrator, came to the United States in 1899 and remained for the rest of his life (died November 30, 1948).5 Although 1.

Benda 23 Benda arrived in the United States at the age of 26, accompanied by his parents and two sisters, at the invitation of his step-aunt, the illustrious, world-renowned Polish actress, Helena Modjeska (Modrzejewska) (1840-1909). Benda's father, Jan Szymon, was Modjeska's half-brother; they were children of the same mother. Jan Szymon, who married Ksawera Sikorska in 1869, had three children: Wladyslaw, Jadwiga and Emilia. Modjeska and her husband, a Polish nobleman, Karol Chlapowski, had lived in southern California since 1876. Their lovely residence, named Forest of Arden, in the canyon of the Santiago River near Santa Ana, was designed by American architect Stanford White. That residence, which has been declared a National Historic Monument, became a first American home for Benda and his family.9 From early childhood, drawing had been part of Benda's life. Initially, it was his father, a musician interested in art, who taught his son sketching.10 Later, as a young man, Benda, who at first enrolled to study civil engineering, trained in drawing and painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Cracow (1892 1894?), under the direction of professors Izydor JabtoAski, Florian S. Cynk (New York: Macmillan, 1907); Samuel McChord Crothers, The Book of Friendship (reprint of the 1910 edition, Freeport, New York: Books for Libraries Press, 1969); Louise Seymour Houghton, The Russian Grandmothers Tales (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1906); Hamilton Wright Mabie, Parables of Life (New York: Macmillan, 1906); Leonard Wood Jr., "Until to Morrow," Scribner's Vol. 41 (January 1917), p. 95; and Oscar Wilde, "For Love of the King (A Burmese Masque in Three Acts and Nine Scenes)," The Century, Vol. 130 (December 1921), pp. 225-242. Benda also gave lecture-demonstrations on the use of his masks in dancing and pantomime. Held in art museums, clubs and schools, the presentations took place in Washington, D.C., New York City, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, Chicago, Cleveland, Springfield, Illinois, and Newark, New Jersey.

The editors of American Artist remembered him as "one of the most kindly, understanding individuals it has ever been [our] privilege to know."13 Art critic Lloyd E. Smith, in his 1927 article "W. T. Benda and His Masks, Calm Repose, Subtle Drama, and Girls with Almond Eyes," described the artist as a man: somewhat under average stature, and blond ? with a neat blond mustache. His features have a slight Slavic cast. But there is nothing of the bohemian about Benda, artist though he is. He dresses in conventional business clothes. His manner is always gentle and mild, even, at times, a trifle shy and reticent. He has a softly modulated voice, but consistent with his reticent manner, it now and then has a hesitating note in it. Perhaps it is more hesitant when he is speaking English, for he does not talk English so fluently as he does several foreign languages. In 1993, Benda's daughter, Eleonora (Mrs. Donald Shimler of Connecticut), reminisced about her father: Yes, my father was multilingual. He was a brilliant artist who never wasted a minute of his time. He was gentle, with a lively, teasing sense of humor. My father started a family rather late in his life. At the age of 47 [in 1920] he married my mother, Romola Campfield. 20 years his junior. In addition to me, they had another daughter, Basia [Mrs. George C. Rudolph, who lives in South Carolina].15 11. J.

In Africa he visited Morocco.16 Benda began his artistic activity in the United States, with the backing of Helena Modjeska, by designing the sets and costumes for a production of Antony and Cleopatra in which she played Cleopatra.17 It was also thanks to Modjeska that Benda was able to open an art studio and school of painting in Los Angeles.18 After he moved to New York, while working at the American Lithographic Co., in 1906, Benda was offered his first job as an illustrator by Joseph Chapin, art editor of Scribner's magazine. During the subsequent years, his illustrations caught on, and he produced an abundance of work. He maintained studios in Manhattan, at first at 1 Gramercy Park and later at 1, 2 and 27 West 67th Street.19 His studios were filled with antique furnishings, exotic carvings and draperies of costly fabrics, while he, as usual, dressed conventionally in business clothes.20 Carol Bird, in an article published in 1922 in the prestigious journal Arts and Decoration, described Benda's Gramercy Park studio as "luxurious,'' with Chinese and Japanese styles predominating.21 Benda remarked, "I am fascinated by colorful things, luxurious effects, splendid parts to make a splendid whole, and so I work out my oriental learnings."22 But Bird observed that if one studied Benda's motifs carefully, one could see they were of "Polish origin, but worked out into Oriental characterization."23 One source of Benda's artistic vocabulary was the Art Nouveau, or Secession style, ascendant in Europe in the 1890s and early 1900s. In France, it was known as le style moderne; in Germany, the Jugendstil; in Poland, Mloda Polska, or "Young Poland." The turn-of-the-century trend began in Central Europe, in Munich and Vienna, with some seminal influences from Japanese woodblocks, and became a progressive force in the art world, especially in two-dimensional compositions of graphic art. In Poland, the movement centered at the end of the nineteenth century around the Cracow Academy of Fine Arts, where Benda studied before moving 16. Ryszkiewicz, p. 129. 17.

Benda 27 to Vienna and his subsequent departure for America.24 In New York, Robert Henri, an early proponent of Art Nouveau in America, was Benda's teacher in poster and cover design.25 The aesthetic elements that were present almost invariably in the work of all Art Nouveau artists were stylization and decorativeness of forms; the use of an elegant, sinuously flowing and delicate line of drawing combined with a planar, or flat, graphic treatment of the forms themselves; and a preference for ornamental motifs of an organic derivation, such as flowers, foliage and trees. The focal point was the image of a woman, sensuous and spellbinding, symbolical and mysterious . . . beautiful and in bloom, languorous and almost feral . . . with her unfurled hair and the complicated folds of her dresses, adorned with opulent jewels .... The flora coils sensually around the central figure, burgeoning , . . into an overabundance of luxuriant vegetation.26 Benda's images of women are evocative of the feminine ideal dictated by Art Nouveau. His women seem to synthesize the elements of sublime beauty and allure, of physical decorativeness of form and line ? expressing sensuality and yet possessing a certain spiritual quality. They are often wrapped in exotic materials rich in texture, pattern and folds; they are adorned by designs in which floral elements are present; their faces are framed by long, flowing hair. A particular characteristic of Benda's female faces is their almond-shaped eyes, their seductive gaze narrowed by downward-drawn eyelids.27 24.

He espoused a wide range of styles. Besides Art Nouveau, he drew from several other nineteenth century traditions: Realism, for example, with its preference for conveying the essential reality of forms or scenes;28 Romanticism, or, more specifically, a Polish notion of it, with its undertone of the spirit of patriotism (Figure 2);29 and a sentimental inclination to use in., signed 1.1.); a Life magazine cover, January 8, 1923; a portrait of a woman in a green gown (pencil and watercolor, 17 x 16.25 in., signed l.r.); a woman wearing a gold-colored shawl (watercolor and pastel, 14.25 x 9.5 in., signed l.r.); cover for The Shrine magazine, May 1927.

This last element in Benda's work was uniquely characteristic of the Polish Secession artists, whose fondness for the village folklore and folk art of their country31 is said to have distinguished uYoung Poland'' from other Art Nouveau movements.32 Benda's personal technique called for initial drawings of contour and form and the interpretation of light and shading effects ranging from soft, mistlike dusting to the use of clustered, firm and vigorous lines in charcoal, ink or pencil. After he had strengthened his lines with layers of fixative, he applied watercolor, pastel, or watercolor touched up with pastel. He finished by delineating his original drawings with charcoal, ink or colored pencil to render them more tactile. Pulaski Fought for the Liberty of Poland and Other Nations.

Benda 3 1 Benda's talent in using the drawn line to evoke a sense of repose and quiet serenity in the facial expressions of his stylized women finds its counterpoint in his ability to draw figures in motion, stressing the movement's realness and animation as well as its diversity. The wide gamut of movement in his work is illustrated by the following examples. In Krakowiak, circa 1916 (pastel on cardboard, 24.8 x 39.37 in., signed l.r.), a folk dance of the Cracow region that Benda called "vivacious ... danced with agile, springing step," the artist depicted a line of joyfully exuberant dancing women and men. His composition, which was described by the art historian and critic Wladyslawa Jaworska as "full of dynamism," is splashed with vibrating motion, youth, grace, and color. "Scarcely any other amusement is so directly founded on man's natural need of giving play to youthful vigor and emotions as the graceful swing of the dance," said Benda.33 In Przed burza. [Before the Storm], 1915 (oil on canvas, 62.6 x 36.6 in., signed l.r.), village people, gathering hay from a field on a hillside, express in their hurried movements the sense of haste before the approaching storm.34 In depicting patriotic themes, Benda drew the pressing-forward movements of groups of soldiers, in works such as Apocalyptic Cavalry (charcoal, 30 x 35 in., signed 1.1.); Peasant Army Crossing Field of Snow: Refugees (charcoal and pastel, 23 x 36 in., signed l.r.); and Rebel Soldiers Prepare for 33. I question the current attribution of Krakowiak to "about 1940" (see Jaworska, Malarze Polscy..., p. 2; and "Polskie malarstwo w Montrealu...," p. 18), since Benda discussed this composition already in 1916, and used it then as an illustration for his article "The Dance," pp. 672, 679. Krakowiak was shown at City Hall in Montreal, Quebec, at an exhibition of Polish painters arranged on the occasion of the visit of Pope John Paul II to that city in 1984. It was featured on the cover of the catalogue of the exhibition Malarze Polscy. Peintres Polonais. Polish Painters (1850-1950), as well as on the invitations and posters announcing the event. In 1993, Krakowiak was again reproduced, on the cover of the Souvenir Ball Journal, for the 58th Annual Ball of the Kosciuszko Foundation (April 24). (See The Kosciuszko Foundation Newsletter, Vol. 44 [1944], p. 1.) The Kosciuszko Foundation had also issued color prints of Krakowiak for a sale to commemorate the Millennium of Poland in 1966, and to promote Polish culture.

The artist once observed that "every shade of emotion and movement, from languid sentimentality to turbulent ferocity . . . from frivolous to solemn, can be found in the dance and its infinite combination of steps, leaps . . . ,"36 In addition to movement, Benda's use of form and color plays a significant role in Dance. Six symbolic, nymphlike figures, profiled in the nude, or half clothed in animal skins, are silhouetted on a background of Pompeian red, flanking a central, satyrlike figure rendered in verdigris green. He is emerging from behind a pedestal formed of stemlike motifs ? organic, pliant and coiling at their tips, reminiscent of vine-stem tendrils. Two ornaments in the shape of avian wings serve as the couches on which two of the dancers rest in the lower corners of the panel, playing on the cymbals. This scene is Benda's variation on the Greek myth of Dionysus, the god of wine, and the maenads, whom he inspired to abandon their homes and families for a life of music and ecstasy of dancing amid nature. In The Amazons, prior to 1912 (charcoal and pastel, 24 x 36.5 in., signed 1.1.), Benda depicted a "joyous cavalcade'' of young women mounted on zebras at the gallop through a landscape of tall grasses. The artist emphasized the rapidity of motion through the interplay of the zebras' striped bodies and the richly patterned garments of the Amazons. The Amazons was originally the last part of a triptych. The middle part showed the women riding horseback under a lush canopy of trees, their garments flapping in the air, their flying hair transformed into foliage of the trees above. By contrast, the first panel of the triptych represented one of the women lagging behind, forced to pull her recalcitrant charge, a donkey, thus delaying the pattern of rapid motion that was characteristic of the other two panels.37 35.

Benda 33 In Women's War Dance of the Mozambique Coast (charcoal and red watercolor on board, 25 x 38 in., signed I.e.), Benda illustrated six African women in a ceremonial dance, to "bring victory to the men engaged in battle."3* * * * It seems that Benda's name cannot be mentioned without thinking of the "Benda masks," that phase of his artistic activity in which he is regarded as an outstanding authority, with which his name is inseparably linked, and for which "he will longest be remembered."39 In the 1910s, when he had already won renown as an illustrator and designer, Benda began creating theatrical masks. His description of the process entailed in the design and execution of the masks, and his feelings about that process, have been recorded in his book, Masks (1944), and in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (14th edition, 1929), for which he wrote an authoritative article on theatrical mask making.40 Benda's book contains 69 photographs of his masks. It is a veritable gallery of fascinating, inimitable compositions that speak clearly of his talent and are an inexhaustible source on mask making. The masks are of every imaginable kind, each appropriate to the type of character the artist was intent on portraying. Taken together, Benda's masks offer a many-sided study of the human and animal world. Filled with the artist's insightful impressions as a portraitist and a superb caricaturist, they represent not specific individuals, in most instances, but rather generic human types and moods, and the grotesque and comedic. The masks convey the elements of illusion and mystery, simultaneously appearing alive and seeming to change expression. There is in them the "resemblance to life, the imitation of real human faces. But over and beyond this, in a transcendental sense, is the expression of something more real than reality." The word "spiritual" has often been used to describe the masks, Lloyd Smith observed in his article on Benda's art.41 Among the arresting masks in Benda's book are the faces of glamorous, beautiful women. They are extraordinarily lovely, serene, with delicate fea 38. See The Illustration Collector, p. 14, No. 43. 39.

There are men's faces, such as the monocled English Statesman (1927), the Lawyer (1930), the Soldier (1943), and the portrait mask of the pianist Ignacy Paderewski (1940). There are visual personifications of certain states of mind, such as the Ascetic (1916); socioethnological studies of human race, such as the Sioux Indian (1926) and Sad Negro (1930); and renditions of fantastic creatures, endowed with both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic traits, such as the Insect (1923), Ramhorn (1918) and Sea Monster (1919). Benda made strikingly unconventional and frightening masks, "expressly to give shudders to the onlookers," he said, such as Blue Demon (1914) and Pestilence (1922); and mischievous masks, such as the Old Wag (no date) (Figure 4).42 My masks are made for use in pantomime and dance, but not for the spoken drama. . . . They may be called, for want of a better expression, "silent masks.* This kind of mask would muffle the speech, while speech would destroy the effect and mystery of the mask.43 I started making masks in utter ignorance of what had previously been done, and of what was currently going on, in this very ancient art. . . . It was only much later that I got acquainted with the amazing variety of masks of all lands and of all times.44 His method of mask making, he said, is solely my own ? one which I invented and developed for my personal use. While it is well suited to my purpose, temperament, and way of doing things, I by no means claim that it is the only good method.45 Benda believed that a mask must be strong, rigid and very durable, despite its apparent fragility. It must also be very easily adjustable to the head, its weight should average from six to seven ounces, and it must be executed with the utmost precision. He formed his masks upon a brass-wiring construction, contouring and modeling the shape of a face out of tiny strips of hard, unbleached paper, glued together piece upon piece in a number of consecutive, tightly compressed layers. When dried, the rough surface of the model was cut, carved and shaved, and protected on both the outside and inside with three 42.

Finally the mask was painted with oil or tempera colors, of which several coats might have been applied, each of them followed by the repeated shaving and patching of the mask's surface, until it achieved a desired effect. After the final coat of varnish and another layer of paint, the mask was carefully polished to give it the naturally soft and smooth quality of human skin. The eyes were painted, with the pupil pierced to admit light, or a slit was made for the entire eye. The nostrils of all the masks were open for breathing, but the mouths of most ? unlike the masks of Japanese or Greek drama ? were closed. Hair was painted on the forehead, or on the top of the mask, as were elaborate, ornament-laden headdresses. The inside of the mask was often finished with layers of gold leaf.46 To meet the demands of his painstaking labor, Benda assembled a wide variety of tools, which he enumerated as "wood-carving tools, surgeons' scalpels, jewelers' burrs, silversmiths' files, shoemakers' knives, razor blades, penknives, scissors (long and short, straight and curved), a set of small clamps, calipers (both exterior and interior), as well as a box of pliers, tweezers and nippers of every kind and description."47 The "Benda masks" were initially created for the artist's own amusement. In 1914, Benda attended a masquerade ball for which, as part of his costume, he made a mask.48 In his article "Masks on the Stage and Off," Benda recalled how at the last moment it occurred to him that it would be good to appear in a bizarre mask, so I made one by gluing together variously shaped pieces of heavy wrapping paper." He said that after his return from the masquerade, "I threw the flimsy affair into the waste basket, but the next morning I picked it out again and added more character to its features. Some two weeks later, I decided to complete it properly. So for 30 odd evenings I worked on it, until it became ornamental and permanent enough to hang on the wall of my studio. The masks were further developed as a hobby for entertaining his friends by staging little pantomimes at masquerade balls, which were then very popular, or at private dinners and clubs. It was his "peculiar bent," Benda explained, "for conveying thoughts and feelings by any other medium than words," that 46.

Crowninshield praised the "genius of this painter" and repeatedly devoted space in the pages of Vanity Fair to Benda's art and to the publication of photographs of the "Benda masks."50 Eventually, the masks found their place in stage performances of dance and pantomime.51 The American ballet and concert dancer and choreographer Margaret Severn used them with great success in a series of dances for the Greenwich Village Follies of 1920, at Broadway's Shubert Theater (staged by John Murray Anderson). Subsequently, for more than twenty years, she toured throughout the United States and Europe dancing and miming with the aid of Benda masks. Another American interpretative dancer, Grace Christie, wore Benda masks in her revue, League of Notions, at the Alhambra Theater in London (produced by C. B. Cochran). 49.In 1918, members of the Comedy Club enacted a mask pantomime at the estate of Mr. and Mrs. Charles C. Goodrich in Llewellyn Park, New Jersey, before an audience of invited guests. In 1920, a group of members of New York's Coffee House Club, wearing Benda masks acted in a fantasy pantomime conceived by John J. Chapman.

T. Benda 39 Benda also created masks for the original production of Eugene O'Neill's The Hairy Ape, and for several one-act plays written by Benda himself. The masks became the "unique, if not dominant note" of presentations carried out in North and South America, in Europe and Australia.52 For, as Benda said, not only is one who puts on a mask seemingly transformed into the being the mask portrays, but he himself is aware of this strange metamorphosis ... for the wearer of a mask yields subconsciously to the irresistible impulse to act like the being the mask typifies.53 W. T. Benda's life ended November 30, 1948, at the age of 75. He was scheduled to give a lecture on mask making at the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Art in Newark, New Jersey.54 Shortly before his talk, as he stood in the wings of the school auditorium, the artist suffered heart failure and slumped to the floor. Firmly held in his hand was one of his masks.55 52. See Benda, Masks, pp. x, 92, 102, 104; Smith, p. 84; McCabe, p. 324. 53. Benda, Masks, p. i. 54. Taraba, p. 110; The New York Times, p. 29. 55.

In the foreword to his book Masks, Benda remarked, Is there not, then, more than a little irony in the mischievous trick of fate that has gradually ensnared me into talking about the very masks which I began making expressly to avoid talking? For ever since my false faces have become known, I have been asked to "say something about" . . . so-called "Benda masks." So I have talked, at first timidly, then quite brazenly, till this talking has developed into a persistent habit, whereof the following pages are the outcome and an example.</page><page sequence="20">40 The Polish Review APPENDIX Among the exhibitions showing W.
