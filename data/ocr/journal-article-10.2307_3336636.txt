<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shared Masking Traditions in Northeastern Ivory Coast KATHR YN L, REEN In the sous-prefecture of Kong in northeastern Ivory Coast, most of the population declares itself to be Muslim. As the years pass this religious identity is slowly becoming an ethnic identity. Pre- colonial divisions within the Mandekan- speaking group (Mandekan is the lan- guage of the ancient Mali empire, cur- rently made up of three major dialects: Mandinka, Bamana, and Dyula) as well as among surrounding previously Gur- speaking groups are falling into disuse. The reasons for this ethnic change have been dealt with summarily elsewhere (Green 1986a:121-22). In the precolonial period the Mandekan-speakers, divided between the Muslim Dyula (Jula) traders and scholars and the Sonongui warriors, held political and economic control over a state centered on the village of Kong. The frontiers of this state expanded and contracted according to the strength of the ruling Watara family in relation to the surrounding warrior states such as Asante, Gyaman, and, in the nineteenth century, Sikasso. Yves Person has called the Kong state a Dyula state (1968-1975, vol. 1:148; vol. 3:2054, 2059). I have ar- gued elsewhere, however, that the Dyula of Kong owed political allegiance to the distinct warrior group known as the Sonongui, distinguished as a sepa- rate siya, a word often translated as "ethnic group" (Green 1984). The Sonongui were formed from an amalgam of peoples combining both Mandekan-speakers and Gur-speakers, with the Mande group and their culture definitely predominating (Green 1984:chaps. 4, 5). The most important distinguishing characteristic between the Sonongui and the Dyula was reli- gion; the Dyula practiced Islam in vary- ing degrees of orthodoxy and the Sonongui practiced the traditional be- liefs of the Mande and Gur peoples with outward displays of Islamic ceremony at appropriate times. I have recently ar- gued, based on field research in the summer of 1986, that it was not until early in this century that the Sonongui could even begin to be considered Mus- lim, because before that time their politi- cal power was firmly based on a tradi- tional occult power society (Green 1986b). While conducting this research on the precolonial religious orientation of the Sonongui I was able to observe and col- lect data on the continuing masking tra- ditions of Kong. This article presents ma- terial on the concept of do, the Do society of Kong, the mask called Domuso in Kong, and the general question of the movement of both mask types and ritual concepts in the area of northeastern and north-central Ivory Coast and west- central Ghana. Data collected in Kong display striking contrasts with as well as similarities to the material collected by Renb Bravmann in the nearby Cercle de Bondoukou of Ivory Coast and the con- tiguous area of Ghana. Do as a Mask Type Bravmann, in his seminal work Islam and Tribal Art in West Africa, has a chapter on "The Do Masking Tradition" (1974: chap. 8). In it he illustrates a mask type photo- graphed in various collections and among Ligby and Hwela peoples (both Mande speaking) in the border regions of Ivory Coast and Ghana near the Ivo- rian town of Bondoukou (Figs. 1, 2, 3). He also presents a photo taken in Kong by M. Prouteaux sometime before 1925 and labels this "Do masquerades at Kong," while the original photo was labeled "Deux masques et jeune fille" (Two masks and young girl) (Fig. 4). In a later publication Bravmann indicates that ac- cording to Prouteaux the masks were "carefully carved wooden masks, some covered with brass, known as lo..." (1983:69).' Prouteaux, however, does not call these masks by that name. He indi- cates only that they are masks that ap- pear at the "fetes du Lo," a crucial differ- ence (Prouteaux 1925:624, 628). Brav- mann was clearly led to this leap of faith regarding nomenclature for Kong be- cause of the situation he found in his own fieldwork area, where Do is a par- ticular mask type quite similar to the two masks photographed by Prouteaux. As will be seen below, this is not completely incorrect for Kong. However, Do in Kong is much more than a mask type. Bravmann's excellent chapter on "The Do Masking Tradition" does not deal with the question of what do actually means, but it is important for an under- 1.

FROM BRAVMANN 1974: PL.72. 62</page><page sequence="2">standing of this masking tradition, which Bravmann found to be "exclu- sively Muslim" (1974:147). To my knowl- edge Philip Ravenhill is the first to con- front the issue of the wide usage of the term do in the context of masking societies in West Africa. In a paper pre- sented several years ago, Ravenhill (1984:1) commented on its "generic" na- ture, citing a Bambara-French dictionary that defines do as "association secrete frtichiste," not a mask type (Bailleul 1981:47).2 In Kong, on being queried about the meaning of the word, the tutigi (head of the sacred forest) responded: "If you hear the word do, it means knowl- edge. Knowledge is do. This knowledge gives us the ability to control things through subaghaya [sorcery]."3 As this quotation indicates, the word is connected with secret or occult knowl- edge. It is most probably a shortened form of the Mandekan word gundo or dogo, meaning "secret" - and usually associated with the occult (Delafosse 1929, vol. 1:622). Since do appears in Bail- leul's 1981 dictionary as a noun meaning "association secr'ete frtichiste," it is curious that another Bambara-French dictionary, published in the early twentieth century, does not have an entry for a noun form of do (Bazin 1906).4 Could the word's ap- pearance in the 1981 work represent a twentieth-century southern penetration of the Bamana (Bambara) by the Dyula dialect of Mandekan (Mande language), or was its omission simply an oversight in the early dictionary? Kate Ezra's work in the southern Bamana-speaking area (a Mandekan-speaking group whose lan- guage is very close to Dyula) indicates that the Bamana Jo society is sometimes called the do society in this southern area of Mali (Ezra 1983:49 n.; 52 n.). It is clear, then, that do refers, at least in some Mandekan-speaking areas, to secret societies or occult power. Various authors have presented evi- dence of "Do," "dou," or "Dwo" masking traditions or religious societies running through a wide area of Ivory Coast, Ghana, Mali, and Burkina Faso. Con- tinued research may locate the use of this word in similar contexts elsewhere. In addition to Bravmann's material cited above, L.-G. Binger, in his long exploratory expedition through the Western Sudan in the late nineteenth century, gave a short description with an accompanying drawing ofdou5 in the vil- lage of Kotedougou in Burkina Faso (1892, vol. 1:378-79). J. Capron discusses various masquerades as incarnations of Do, defined as a divinity that binds to- 2. DO MASK, HWELA QUARTER OF SORHOBANGO, 1966. FROM BRAVMANN 1974: PL.74. 3.

Guy Le Moal indicates that both the Zara and the Gur-speaking Bobo of Burkina Faso venerate the Dwo divinity. Dwo is con- sidered, simplistically, as the "son" of the "father" Wuro. Dwo was given the func- tion of safeguarding humanity, and in the cult of Dwo, humans have fabricated numerous mask manifestations of the deity (Le Moal 1980:19, 118-20). Monica Visona has collected data on masks called Do among the Akye, and docu- mentation exists for similar masks among Morenou Anyi in Ivory Coast (personal communication, Nov. 19, 1986). Finally, Susan Vogel has discussed the evolution of the Do tradition among the Akwe Baule people of Ivory Coast (Vogel 1987). On examination of these examples it becomes obvious that the term Do has been applied to quite different masking traditions. The drawing that accom- panies Binger's description of the dou in Kotedougou shows masks with either wooden crests on the top of the head or with wooden bird beaks on cloth face masks (Fig. 5). Binger related: "The dou are individuals ridiculously disguised, wearing clothes on which dafou (indi- genous hemp), fibers, and leaves of the ban palm have been sewn; for head cov- ering, they have a cap or skullcap [calotte] also in dafou, surmounted by a crest of wood reddened by ochre, or sometimes provided with a bird's beak also in wood. Two holes are contrived in the skullcap for the eyes" (Binger 1892, vol. 1:378-79, my translation). As the drawings were completed by an artist after Binger's re- turn to Paris, one cannot be at all sure how faithful they are to what Binger ac- tually saw. In this issue (p.40) Chris- topher Roy presents leaf masks he docu- mented in Burkina Faso, designated as Do and clearly of the same type as those Binger saw. The masks discussed by Capron for the Bwa people are leaf and stem masks. Le Moal's detailed pre- sentation of the Dwo masks among the Bobo relates primarily to leaf and fiber masquerades, though it indicates that other mask types are also used (1980). Monica Visona suggests that the Do masks and related masquerades in southern Ivory Coast are all wooden helmet masks. Susan Vogel states that the Do among the Akwe Baule can be a horizontal helmet mask of various styles. After the French conquest, however, Do came to be identified in some villages as a drum that accompanies another mask (Vogel 1987). Finally, Bravmann's Do masks are small wooden face masks (Figs. 1, 2, 3). If it is understood that in Mande lan- guages do means "secret," in some sense, and that among the Gur peoples Do is a divinity, these typological differ- ences between the masks discussed above make much more sense. L. Tauxier indicated that do means "hidden man" (homme cache in the Mande languages. He continued: "The word Do or Dou doesn't designate a special god but is a generic name given by the Dyulas to the gods of the secret societies. However, here [Abengourou, southeast Ivory Coast] the word Do or Dou designates the society established in the countries of Kong and Bondoukou" (Tauxier 1932:74 n.).6 Bravmann concluded that in the area where he worked, Do has come to mean only the small wooden, predominantly anthropomorphic face mask. In Kong, however, the word itself can have a very wide meaning. In my interviews with the tutigi of Kong in the summer of 1986, he explained that do, meaning "secret," is also the term used for all masks, for all ritual objects in the masking society, as well as for the society itself.7 This wide definition can be supported by looking again at Binger's narration of his encounter with the dou of Kotedougou: "On approaching the village, I was struck by the animation which reigned on the outskirts. I was asking myself what it all meant when Diawe, who had a better view than I, says to me, "Ici, ma lieutenant, jamais des dou qui fini," which in his language means: "Dou are never lacking these parts" (1892, vol. 1:378, my translation). Though Binger goes on to describe the masks shown in Figure 5, which he says he has seen before, Diawe's exclamation, rather than refer- ring to this particular type of mask only, just as likely means that masks in general are not lacking in this village. This hypothesis is further strengthened when one remembers that Binger spoke a Mande language and had spent some time in Kong just prior to coming across the dou under discussion here. It is there- fore most likely that he would have fol- lowed the wide Mande definition of do used in Kong. In interviews in the fall of 1980 in that same village of Kotedougou (where Kong warriors settled in the mid-nineteenth century), I was assured that the Bobo who lived there indeed had many masks that formed part of their traditional religious practices.8 This hypothesis for the wide meaning of do is further strengthened by Binger's state- ment, following his discussion of the Kotedougou dou: "Among the Bambara and the Malinke of the upper Senegal, dou also exist, but these are inoffensive. I saw two of them one evening at a "tam- tam" of Komantara (Medine) at Demba Sambala's which only came there to dance. The Khassonke call them mama (ancestors)" (1892, vol. 1: 380, my transla- tion). Previously, during his long stay in Kong, Binger had related: "Policing is done by the dou; it is the dou who, with the aid of their whips, opened a passage 5. PROMENADE OF THE DOU IN KOTEDOUGOU. FROM BINGER 1892, VOL. 1:379. 64</page><page sequence="4">for me through the crowd the day of my entry. Beginning about ten o'clock at night, they circulate in the streets, quiet noisy conversations in the interior of dwellings and seize all those who are cir- culating in the streets without any good reason.... These policemen carry the name of dou because this word signifies 'return' [sic] and because their function is to make everyone return home. In order to frighten the people, at night they disguise themselves and give out wild cries; other times they use horns, from which they draw out strange sounds" (1892, vol. 1: 303, my transla- tion). These are obviously not the same dou as those in Kotedougou, who were involved in promenades of the village and dancing and who did not carry whips. Thus the evidence seems to indi- cate the sharing or borrowing of a word (do) and the concept it represents (secrets dealing with the occult or spirit world) rather than of an actual mask type or style. This wide meaning of the word could explain in part Bravmann's discus- sion of the wart hog mask in the Do mas- querade at Bondo-Dyoula (Fig. 10, cen- ter): "This mask is unusual for a Do be- cause it is not, strictly speaking, a face mask and because it represents a wart hog" (1974:152). If do is a general term embodying the concept of secret rather than strictly a mask type, the wart hog would not be unusual. Sharing of Masquerade Concepts An example of this borrowing of a word and its concept by masking societies ap- pears with the Senufo word and mask spelled koddli or koddalu. Anita Glaze has published masked figures designated as "kod6li- y~h?" masquerades of blacksmith junior grade Poro societies (Fig. 6). These are carved wooden an- thropomorphic face masks with horns curving up and inward. Distinctive proj- ections, frequently termed "legs" in the literature, hang from the sides of the lower cheeks. Yet the tutigi of Kong, on viewing a photo of Figure 6, immediately declared it to be Domuso, a Kong mask that I will discuss here later. Thus there is a common mask type in the Kong Dyula and Korhogo Senufo areas that goes by different names. On the other hand, Kong has a mas- querade called Kondali, which functions in the way described by Gilbert Bochet for the Senufo koddalu mask: "The word koddalu is very vague and its etymology is uncertain. It designates in a general fash- ion all the ritual human figures whose faces are concealed and whose presence has for a goal to give a luster to the per- formance of the ceremonies."9 He con- tinues: "In fact, any masked person of a minor nature who contributes through dancing to the animation of a ceremony can be called koddalu" (Bochet 1965:668, my translation). Kong's Kondali, called the father of all masks (Fig. 7), is a solid- color brown cloth-covered figure, rope- belted at the waist, with sleeves drop- ping 20-25 centimeters beyond the fingertips, and a triangular-shaped sack hood with two red bull's-eyes with black rings for the eyeholes. It serves to enli- ven the mask performances and uses its whip to scare children and keep them under control. Although the people of Kong and the Senufo thus share the koddalulKondali concept of a mask that animates the performance but is not the center of attention, they use completely different mask types to fulfill its role. Do and Domuso in Kong As I have already indicated, in Kong "Do" designates predominantly the se- cret society to which all warriors used to belong as well as the masks and other ritual paraphernalia associated with the society; it is not a mask type. 10 Some Is- lamized Dyula who took part with the Sonongui in battles were also members of the society. Karamogow (Islamic scholars), however, were not associated with the Do. Informants in Kong are adamant that the Do in Kong is the same as the Lo among the Dyula of the Korhogo area and that both are simplified versions of the Poro of the Senufo. Any member of the Do in Kong may gain access to the sacred forest of the Senufo by undergoing an examina- tion in which he names ritual objects by their special sacred forest names before a 6.

DANCED BY JUNIOR GRADE PORO IN- ITIATES, IT IS CALLED KODOLI-YEHE FROM GLAZE 1981: PL. 42. 65</page><page sequence="5">Senufo examining committee. Con- versely, any Senufo Poro member may gain access to the Kong society. Bochet, considering the institution in the Korhogo area, suggests that interpreta- tion of the Lo and the Poro promoted the sharing of rituals between the two groups (1965:672). The Do in Kong has been changed and reduced by Islam and the occupational obsolescence of the formerly warrior Sonongui, but the tutigi of Kong indicated that the Do never had an elongated series of initiations similar to that of the Korhogo area of Senufo country. The origin of the Do society was in the early formation of the Mande state in Kong. According to the tutigi there was great division among the various groups in Kong - the Dyula, Sonongui, and Hwela in particular - and the Do was organized to enforce unity among the people and at the same time give them the power to defend themselves against outside attack. Kate Ezra provides a strikingly similar example among another Mandekan-speaking group, the southern Bamana; she states, "One of the principal roles of the Jo society is to bring people together" (Ezra 1983:48). In discussing the organization of the Poro society among the Mende of Sierra Leone, K.L. Little describes a seemingly similar need for a greater authority: "In the old days, it [the Poro] supplied the mystical quality of authority which is apparently lacking in the purely secular figure of the Mende chief" (Little 1949:204). As part of this unification pro- cess - which cannot be treated in detail in this article - the Hwela Gban mask, a powerful sorcerer-hunting zoomorphic horizontal mask, kept from the eyes of women and noninitiates, became part of the Do society in Kong. In this way, Hwela settlers were united with the Dyula and Sonongui in the area. The masks that Bravmann identifies as Do kyemve ("beautiful maidens") (?) (Figs. 1, 2, 3) are called Domuso ("woman mask") in Kong (Figs. 8, 9), so named both because they have feminine features and because they dance in a provocative style, with much hip move- ment. The Domusow (w= plural marker) always appear in pairs. They are carved wooden face masks, all of a basically sim- ilar style, though there are some minor differences. The length and width of the horns can vary, as can the color of the face, with white and red being the pre- dominant colors. Facial scarifications and the "legs" projecting from the cheeks may not be present. One of the masks I witnessed in the summer of 1986 had an unidentified animal carving be- tween its horns. The costume for all of the Domusow in Kong consists of an in- digenous cotton cloth cape that covers the dancer's head, except for the mask, and falls approximately to waist level. Under the cape the dancer wears a tight- fitting shirt that is only partially seen during the performance. The wrists and ankles have a fiber ruff-type covering that conceals the hands and feet. The dancer's legs are wrapped tightly in var- ious cloths with a waist-to-knee-length fiber skirt dyed red at the hem. The waist is encircled with a fiber fringe 10-13 cen- timeters long. The Domuso in Kong, according to the current tutigi, was never in the sacred forest. He characterized it as a kind of theater. These masks are believed to be vulnerable to sorcerers and therefore re- ceive medicine to protect them when they appear in public. The tutigi asserted that he has to be on constant guard against sorcerer attack during the per- formance of the masquerades. He also indicated that, though he was not cer- tain, he believed that the mask was in- troduced by Ligby people. This agrees with Bravmann's evidence that it was predominantly Ligby villages in which the Do was found in his fieldwork area (1974:156-57). Contrary to Bravmann's finding among the Ligby and Hwela, however (1974:166), Domusow are held not by karamogow but by Dyula and Ligby Mus- lims who are not part of the scholarly class, with clan names of Baro, Toure, Bamba, and Konate. The karamogow in Kong do not consider it seemly to be as- sociated with the Domusow. Bravmann found a similar reluctance on the part of the karamogow in Bondoukou: "The Dyula of Bondoukou claim that the tradi- tion fell into abeyance some forty years ago as a result of pressure from Imam Kunande Timitay, a rigorously orthodox leader" (1974:160). There is no indication that karamogow were ever keepers of the masks in Kong, however. When askec, how the dancers were recruited, the tutigi replied that he watched for in- terested young boys who would gather at each performance and then trained them. He said that he was always careful 7. KONDALI MASQUERADE OF THE DO SOCIETY KONG, 1986. 8. DOMUSOW MASQUERADE PAIR. KONG, 1980. 9. DOMUSOW MASQUERADE PAIR. KONG, 1986. 66</page><page sequence="6">10. DO MASKS. BONDO-DYOULA, 1967. FROM BRAVMANN 1974: PL.75. to make sure that the child of a karamogo did not become involved by mistake. Un- like the situation in Bondoukou, the karamogow in Kong have not gone to the length of banning the performances, however, probably owing to the tradi- tional political power and respected status of the Sonongui in Kong, who have many other masks of their own. The tutigi of Kong, a man with the clan name of Diabagate whose family has al- ways held this position and was in close association with the Sonongui, gives permission for interested parties to keep the masks. Unlike the Do society masks, which are kept in the sacred forest, these masks are stored in the homes of their keepers. Mask performances in Kong in which the Domusow take part occur at specified times of the year, in close con- formity with data presented by Brav- mann: after Ramadan to celebrate the ending of the Islamic fasting month, dur- ing the first month of the Muslim New Year (Diomande or Muharram), at an eclipse of the moon or sun (not men- tioned by Bravmann), and at funerals. Bravmann states: "In all Ligbi villages and towns where the Do occurred, they were said to appear at the funeral rites of all members of the 'ulama' [karamogow]; this is optional for other Muslims, male and female, but non-Muslims in the community are never accorded such a privilege" (1974:170). In Kong it seems that the Domusow dance at the funerals of certain karamogow (in death the masks' appearance is apparently regarded as an honor by relatives of the deceased) and at the funerals of Do society members. - As everyone in Kong now claims to be Muslim, it is not clear if the same condi- tions held in the past. Bravmann says the Do in his fieldwork area perform after the Islamic Id-al-Kabir (The Great Feast), known as Tabaski by the Dyula, and at weddings (1974:170). The tutigi in Kong specifically denied any Tabaski performances of the masks. There was also no evidence that the Domusow ever danced at weddings in Kong. The Domusow do dance at con- temporary political gatherings, as Brav- mann also indicates for the Do in his area of data collection (1974:171). Bravmann mentions no secret society connection with the Do masks. This dif- ference with Kong is the main problem with a comparison of his Do and the Kong Domuso. The appearance of Domuso is directly associated with the Do society masks (though they are not part of the initiation and are not kept in the sacred forest) and is controlled by the tutigi. Thus in Kong the Domusow come out only after the lomisi (misi=bull; ani- mal that can produce loud noises) (con- fusingly not domisi) has sounded. The lomisi is a large double-skin covered drum that proceeds through every quar- ter of the town the night before the masks perform to warn everyone that they will appear the next day and that from that moment no other drums may sound until the mask performance is over. 12 This difference between the Do of Bravmann's research area and the Kong Do has resulted in a great deal of confu- sion in the literature. It led Bravmann to declare: "The festival and masquerade at Kong were referred to by Prouteaux as 'Lo,' which according to Bochet is the Malinke term used by the Mande living in Senufo country to refer to the major secret society of the non-Muslim Senufo. The Senufo themselves call this society 'Por' [sic]. But the Senufo Lo or Poro is a very different type of association from the Do, as it is a multi-functional, esoteric, male-dominated social-control cult concerned with initiations, burials, agricultural fertility, and so forth. The Dyula masquerade at Kong shared none of these features, except possibly the ap- pearance of the mask at the funerals of chiefs (a feature of the Do) - which Prouteaux suggests but does not con- firm" (1974:157). Using Bravmann's discussion of Do, another scholar, from the Senufo side of the question, states: "Bravman discusses a Do masking tradition in western Ghana, but this society is clearly very dif- ferent from the Senufo Poro.... Glaze states that Lo is the Dyula equivalent of Poro; thus it is altogether possible that there are Lo societies in some parts of Senufoland, but it is doubtful that they function in the same manner as Poro" (Richter 1979:69). The Lo society mask performance (which Kong informants insist should be called Do in Kong) is exactly as Prouteaux described it in his article and as already indicated is considered by its members in Kong to be equivalent to the Poro of the Senufo (Prouteaux 1925:624- 35). The Domuso is only one of the masks that appear publicly after the lomisi sounds. The Sapho mask, a fear- some sorcerer-hunting, one-eyed cloth and fiber masquerade; Kondali (Fig. 7); Toro, a masquerade similar to Kondali in form and function but with fiber ruffs around the waist, wrists, and ankles, 67</page><page sequence="7">and no painted eyeholes; and Jenna (dis- cussed later) are all also part of this mask performance. The tutigi indicated that apart from the Jenna these other masks were formerly for initiates only. As times changed toward the end of the last cen- tury certain masks were selected to ap- pear with the Domusow for the enjoy- ment of the public. At night, and for in- itiates only, other masks come out at times appropriate for the Do society. There are, certainly, many differences between the Do and the Poro owing to the differences in the occupational roles of the members. The Kong society is not as elaborate and does not deal with ag- ricultural fertility, a very important func- tion of the Poro society of the Senufo ag- riculturalists. Rather, as a secret society in the past composed of warriors, it fo- cused on gaining occult power to protect its members in time of battle as well as against sorcerers both in battle and in daily life. One of the main differences be- tween the Poro and the Do is that the Poro was basically obligatory for all adult male Senufo (Glaze 1981:11). Member- ship in the Do was optional. Certainly Is- lamic scholars and committed Muslims had no dealings with it. Origins of the Do and the Domuso Mask Type What could be the origins of the Do iden- tified by Bravmann as "exclusively Mus- lim?" The confusion comes over distin- guishing between the Do tradition he discusses, of a small face mask appearing during specifically Islamic occasions (i.e., the ritual context), and the Do mask type he identifies. Is it not possible for a mask type to be borrowed without the ritual meaning of the donating society being attached to it? Richard Werbner, in discussing the movement of cults in West African societies, points out that societies go through a process of "exotic reduction" whereby they "domesticate" new and exotic cult forms so that they work within their particular societies (Werbner 1979:63). Thus the Do mask type identified by Bravmann could have been borrowed by Ligby or Dyula and then come to be placed in an Islamic con- text as the Muslim Ligby or Dyula society required it. The donating society could have been either the essentially non- Muslim fellow Mande-speaking Sonon- gui of the Kong area or the Senufo people who used the mask in the Poro context. Another possibility is that the conversion to Islam of the Ligby and Dyula after they had already reached the region of Kong and the northern Ghana-Ivory Coast border area with the mask as part of their pre-Islamic reli- gious tradition means that this one par- ticular mask type was retained after con- version and placed in an Islamic context. The close resemblance among Figures 1-3, 6, 8 and 9 is evident. If one looks specifically at the mask type identified by Bravmann as Do, one clearly sees similarity with Senufo Kpelie (a mask type that is the same as the example Glaze calls kod6li-yihi in Fig. 6), a name Glaze objects to, but which I use here as a generic term following the suggestions of Bochet and Richter.'3 Bravmann indicated that the Kong masks "were much closer in style to the Kpelie used by the Senufo within their Lo [sic] society than to Do masks. Typical Kpelie pendants or 'legs' projected from the cheeks of the masks, facial features were more sharply delineated and in- cised geometric designs filled the facial area of the masks" (1974:157-58). Yet some of the masks that Bravmann de- clares to be Do masks from the area of his fieldwork exhibit these same characteris- tics: incised geometric designs on the face and pendants projecting from the cheeks (Figs. 1-3, 10). Ellen Suthers has collected a folktale among the Djimini, a Senufo group south of Kong, which says that a mask fitting the description of Domuso had been Djimini first and that the Dyula stole it.14 The tutigi of Kong indicated that the Domuso could be found among the Djimini, but there it was visible only to secret society initiates. Bohumil Holas also indicated that the Dyula borrowed liturgical objects, "with appropriate adaptations" from the Senufo for use outside of their Islamic practices, and he specifically stipulates the Kpelie masks as being part of this process (Holas 1978:58). With the obvious similarities in style of the Senufo and Mande Dyula masks discussed, and the traditions from the Djimini, the Do masks of Bravmann or Domuso of Kong could very well be borrowings from the Senufo that have subsequently been used in different con- texts. Various informants in Kong insist that they did not copy the Do from the Poro, because the Senufo of Korhogo ac- tually came from Kong.15 Bravmann states: "Restricted art types, such as the Do, generally have little or no relevance for neighboring peoples and thus have not exhibited the mobility of more univ- ersally applicable traditions" (1974:85). This is again confusing the mask genre with the ritual context. There is nothing about the Do masks described by Brav- mann that makes them particularly Is- lamic. The possibility of Dyula borrow- ing from the Senufo is bolstered by the fact that at least one of the songs sung when the masks appear in Kong is in the Senufo Tiembara dialect. On the other hand, Gilbert Bochet related that the Malinke language was used within Senufo ritual as well (1965:660). The di- rection of the borrowing, then, is not cer- tain, but it is clear that peoples in this re- gion of northeastern and north-central Ivory Coast and west-central Ghana share masking traditions and some ritual vocabulary. Each uses these traditions and vocabulary in ritual contexts appro- priate for their particular culture. 11. KAMURU MASQUERADE, 1970. FROM GLAZE 1981: PL.65. 68</page><page sequence="8">12. TYELIGE MASQUERADE, 1970. FROM GLAZE 1981: PL.10. Examples of Mask Borrowing There is certainly evidence in Kong that this mask borrowing has occurred in the past with other mask types. Part of the Kong Do society is a masquerade called Gbangbe, meaning "white/clear Gban," whose dancer is entirely covered in a knitted bodysuit with knitted hood. (It did not appear during my fieldwork period.) Gban is the name of the sorcerer-hunting mask brought to Kong by the Hwela - a horizontal mask like that described by Bravmann in his chap- ter on the "Gbain Masking Tradition" (1974:chap. 7). Gbangbe, although an en- tirely different mask type, happens to dance in the Kong Do to the same rhythm as the Gban. It is called Gban be- cause of the shared rhythms of the two masks, butgbe has been appended to dif- ferentiate it from the frightening Gban. On seeing a picture of the Senufo mask called Kamuru (Fig. 11) in Anita Glaze's work (1981: pl.65), the tutigi of Kong indi- cated that it was Gbangbe. He explained that people in Kong saw this mask in Sinematiali, a Nafara Senufo town ap- proximately 130 kilometers to the west, and were so attracted to it that they brought it back to Kong. It dances at the funerals of Do society members and can be seen from afar by noninitiates. In the Senufo area it is worn by younger chil- dren in a blacksmith Poro society. As another example of borrowing, the tutigi indicated that sometime in the pre- colonial past the karamogow of Kong were so jealous of the masks displayed by the non-Muslims (possibly indicating that Domuso used to be considered entirely non-Muslim?) that they wanted a mask of their own. They came up with the cloth mask Jenna, probably from the Arabic word jinn (genie).16 Cloth covers the face and continues in a long rectangle approximately 30 centimeters wide and reaching to the knees. The entire piece is covered with cowrie shells, which in the facial area outline the eyes, nose, and mouth. The masquerader's costume is of the same style as that of the Domuso, lending credence to the tutigi's claim that the mask was copied by Kong karamogow. They would have had the most opportu- nity to see and copy the Domusow, out of all the masks in Kong, since it has always appeared in public performances in Kong, unlike many of the other masks. The cloth headpiece has a stiff tail sprout- ing out of the top of the head and curling back in a wide arc reaching the level of the waist. The masquerader carries an iron or wood scepter of varying lengths in one hand and runs through and around the crowd, teasing and being chased by children. During his perusal of Anita Glaze's book, the tutigi of Kong indicated that the mask she identified as the Tyelige masquerade (Fig. 12) (1981: pl.10) is Jenna. He said that elsewhere the Jenna mask has other names and that only initiates can see it. In Kong it is a marabout (karamogo) mask, without spiritual significance, which dances for entertainment purposes only. It is ob- vious that the Tyelige masquerade is quite different from the Jenna, but in- teresting that the tutigi equated the two. This paper has indicated various ways and reasons why mask types that are part of one group's deeply rooted belief system may be obtained by another. As a people moves into an area, through the process of "domestication" described by Werbner, a mask can be incorporated into the masking society of those already in the region. Thus the Hwela Gban mask became part of the Dyula Do soci- ety in Kong. Mask forms can also be passed on through the influence of the carvers of the masks, a topic of study that needs to be investigated for the Dyula Do. All of the Kong wooden masks are produced outside the Kong region, des- ignated loosely as "in Jimini." Ellen Suthers indicates that a blacksmith from a Numu village of Nawonon in Djimini said he made carvings for the Dyula.17 Finally, as seen in the cases of Jenna and Gbangbe, attraction to a mask ob- served in another area can lead to its being incorporated, possibly with an entirely different significance. This article cannot end without the traditional call for more research. Being female, I was not allowed access to the sacred forest in Kong, and so could not see the Gban masks or learn about the rituals associated with them. It is clear, however, that ethnic designators for art can only indicate among which group a piece was collected; the group's name cannot designate the type or style. Fur- thermore, ethnic designators are them- selves so changeable and contextual, as in the case of the Dyula and Sonongui, that we should always be on our guard with their usage. O Notes, page 92 69</page><page sequence="9">GREEN, notes, from page 69 I would like to thank Monica Visona for her extensive com- ments on a first draft of this paper. I would also like to ac- knowledge with gratitude the Division of Sponsored Re- search, the Center for African Studies, and the Department of History at the University of Florida, whose support in the summer of 1986 allowed me to return to Kong for four months of field research. Most of the data in this article comes from this recent period of research. 1. Lo and Do are both used in the literature, as the I and d in Mande languages are frequently interchanged and easily comprehensible to native speakers. Do is used in Kong. Lo is used among the Dyula of the Korhogo region in Ivory Coast. See below for further discussion of these terms. 2. Ravenhill11984:1. I would like to thank Philip Ravenhill for his quick response to my plea across the sea for a copy of his paper. 3. Interview with Balagazani Diabagate, in Kong, June 15, 1986. I owe Balagazani Diabagate, the tutigi of Kong, a par- ticular debt of gratitude for his openness and patience in the face of my often ignorant questions. I would also like to ex- press my gratitude to Bouraba Diabagate, my invaluable re- search assistant. 4. In Bazin's (1906) dictionary under do the reader is directed to see dyo for a verb meaning "to stop." However, dyo as a noun is defined in a first meaning as "confrbriefrtichiste" and in a second meaning as "frtiche (nom d'un)." 5. The common plural marker for Mandekan languages is w. Binger's spelling ofdou is most likely the plural form, using a u rather than a w for the plural marker. See Tauxier1932:74, n., where he relates that "Do" is the singular and "Do-ou" is the plural. 6. I would like to thank Philip Ravenhill for this reference. 7. Interviews with Balagazani Diabagate, Kong, June 15, July 22-24, and August 8, 1986. 8. Interview with Bafaga Diane and Sourou Milogo, Kotedougou, October 26, 1980. 9. See Glaze 1981:131-32 for a discussion of kodili as a wide concept of mask. 10. Unless otherwise stated my information on Do and Domuso in Kong comes from interviews with the tutigi of Kong, Balagazani Diabagate. 11. I witnessed no such funeral dances during any of my fieldwork. 12. See Prouteaux 1925:624-27 for a description of the lomisi's first night out after the Ramadan fasting month. When I wit- nessed the lomisi's announcement of the masks in June, 1986, I did not see the Kondali mask accompanying it as Prouteaux describes. It is interesting that Vogel also indicates a close connection between a drum and the Do among the Baule. 13. See Kpelie mask photos and discussion in Richter 1979:67, 72. 14. Ellen Suthers, personal communication, November 19, 1986. In this context the "Jimini" mask collected by Austin Freeman in the nineteenth century and discussed at length by Bravmann, who questions its provenance, could very well have been collected among the Djimini. It need not necessar- ily have come from Satama Sokoura or any other Mande set- tlement, contrary to what Bravmann suggests. See Bravmann 1974:147-52 for his discussion of the Freeman piece. Satama Sokoura is actually in Djamala and not Djimini, as he de- clares. 15. See Bernus 1961:284-90 for a discussion of the supposed Kong origins of the Senufo Tiembara founders of Korhogo. This story of the Kong origins of the Senufo Tiembara found- ers of Korhogo has lately been questioned by Tiona Ouattara (1977). 16. See Bravmann 1977:46-52 for a masking tradition among the Islamized Zara that gives form to an Islamic spirit. 17. Ellen Suthers, personal communication, November 19, 1986.
