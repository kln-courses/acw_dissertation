<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT BIBLIOGRAPHY ALBEE, EDWARD Phillips, Elizabeth C., "Albee and the Theatre of the Absurd," Tennessee Studies in Litera- ture, 10: 73-80, 1965. Albee utilizes Theatre of the Absurd techniques to emphasize conditions observable in contem- porary American culture: "Loneliness among city dwellers, racial injustice, neglect of old people, debasement of national ideals, and deca- dence in American intellectualism." (W.G.F.) AMERICAN LITERATURE Feibleman, James K., "Literary New Orleans Between World Wars," The Southern Re- view, 1:702-19, Summer, 1965. Recalls past incidents and events relating to literary figures, including William Faulkner, Sherwood Anderson, and Gertrude Stein. (J.M.D.) Guttmann, Allen, "From Brownson to Eliot: The Conservative Theory of Church and State," American Quarterly, 17:483-500, Fall, 1965. The only major twentieth-century champion of the American conservative theory of Church and State left his native land to be- come a British subject. T. S. Eliot's "'career is an emblem of the estrangement of American Conservatism from the predominantly secular and increasingly democratic course of the American Republic." (W.G.F.) Santangelo, G. A., "Towards a Definition of American Victorianism," Dalhousie Review, 45:256-67, Autumn, 1965. ""To the rebels of the twenties, the period before 1900 was a cultural wasteland inhabited by puritans." (R.K.) Spengemann, William C., and L. R. Lundquist, "Autobiography and the American Myth," American Quarterly, 17:501-19, Fall, 1965. From Franklin to Andrew Carnegie, American autobiography generally reflected the American myth that "describes human history as a pil- grimage from imperfection to perfection"; the disenchanted stance of Scott Fitzgerald, how- ever, by striking "'at some of the fundamental tenets of American faith" seems "to have the most to tell us about those autobiographical forms which we recognize as being distinctly modern." (W.G.F.) ARTAUD, ANTONIN Derrida, Jacques, "La parole soufflie," Tel Quel, No. 20, pp. 41-67, Winter, 1965. For Artaud, God is the demiurge. The history of God is the history of the Work as excre- ment: scatology itself. Ranged against God, Artaud does not renounce salvation. To the contrary, soteriology will be the eschatology of the cleansed body. (T.T.B.) Nin, Anals, "Onze lettres i Anais Nin," Tel Quel, No. 20, pp. 3-11, Winter, 1965. [Eleven letters to the American novelist writ- ten between February and July 1933.1 (T.T.B.) Sollers, Philippe, "La pens'e met des signes," Tel Quel, No. 20, pp. 12-24, Winter, 1965. In all his writings there is no word that Ar- taud uses more often than thought. His thea- ter is addressed directly to the unconscious when "life" repels it. Life must lead the thought in order to lead life. Thought can- not be other for Artaud than the act by which we wish to be our thought. (T.T.B.) Thivenin, Paule, "Antonin Artaud dans la vie," Tel Quel, No. 20, pp. 25-40, Winter, 1965. [Bettina Knapp's souvenirs of the last two years of Artaud's life.] (T.T.B.) ASTURIAS, MIGUEL ANGEL Donahue, Francis, "Miguel Angel Asturias: su trayectoria literaria," Cuadernos Hispano- americanos, No. 186, pp. 507-27, June, 196, A survey of the development of this little known but highly regarded Guatemalan novel- ist, with special attention to his El senior presi- dente. This novel is his first accomplished work of his mature production, representative of his decision to abandon preciositi in favor of social involvement. (C.O.) AUB, MAX Garcia, Lora, Josi, "Fabulaci6n dramitica del fabuloso Max Aub," Insula, No. 222, p. 14, May, 1965; No. 223, p. 13, June, 1965; Nos. 224-5, pp. 28-9, July-August, 1965. A lengthy genera lanalysis of Aub's work while in Mexico. "Spain's indifference or ignorance of this important dramatic production is more than cruelty, it is stupidity or weakness. There is need for an early staging of this thea- ter which, like it or not, is a part of our literary patrimony." (C.O.) AUDEN, WYSTAN HUGH Fowler, Helen, "The Faces and Places of Au- den," Approach, No. 57 pp. 6-14, Fall, 1965. 216</page><page sequence="2">Auden in his desire to establish an intimacy with his reader as a single person talking to other single persons has slowly learned to es- chew preaching, legislating for mankind, and acting the star role. At first a self-appointed bard in the public arena, he now prefers a private audience with friends. (A.F.) Replogle, Justin, "Auden's Marxism," PMLA, 80:584-95, December, 1965. "Most of Auden's works are not Marxist in any sense of the word. His Marxism neither grows nor diminishes steadily through the years, but appears erratically, though 1938 (after which Marxism disappears entirely) may be a climax. . . . Aside from On the Frontier (perhaps mostly Isherwood's work), nothing . . suggests that Auden ever felt any serious commitment to Marxism as either a political weapon or a political-economic ideology." (W.G.F.) Wright, George T., "A General View of Au- den's Poetry," Tennessee Studies in Litera- ture, 10:43-64, 1965. "As Auden's career has proceeded, he has passed from the nightmare conception of man divided from his own best self by overpower- ing shadows, to the more sanctified fairy tale of man born to evil but capable of enchant- ment by grace." (W.G.F.) BARRIE, SIR JAMES Williams, David Park, "'Hook and Ahab: Bar- rie's Strange Satire on Melville," PMLA, 80: 483-8, December, 1965. In Peter Pan, Barrie uses both Melville's Typee and Omoo and, even more extensively, Moby- Dick. He "transforms the rebellious Ahab into the tyrannical father-Hook who is rebelled against. ... The mutilated Roundhead Ahab becomes the mutilated Cavalier Hook." (W.G.F.) BOBROWSKI, JOHANNES KAhler, Hermann, "Bobrowski's Roman," Sinn und Form, 17:631-6, 1965. Bobrowski's novel "Levin's Mill-34 Passages about my Grandfather" deserves "our special attention and a special place in recent German literature because it appeared simultaneously in the two Germanies and was praised by crit- ics from both." (J.R.R.) BRECHT, BERTOLT Barthes, Roland, "Litterature et signification," Tel Quel, No. 16, pp. 3-17, Winter, 1964. All the plays of Brecht finish implicitly by a chercher l'issue addressed to the spectator in the name of that deciphering to which the materiality of the show must lead him and awareness of the unconscious which is por- trayed on the stage. (T.T.B.) Faye, Jean-Pierre, "Formalisme ou sens?" Cri- tique, No. 215, pp. 335-41, April, 1965. The ideological theatre of Brecht is a direct offspring of the Russian formalist school, being rooted in the precepts of Viktor Chklovski and Tolstoi. (T.T.B.) Willett, John, "Brecht et les formalistes rus- ses," Tel Quel, No. 23, pp. 94-5, Autumn, 1965. Brecht derives his ideas from Chklovski par- ticularly in his citation of Verfremdung, which was not in his vocabulary before his trip to Russia in'1935, and by imitating other aspects of Russian formalism. (T.T.B.) Zmegac, Viktor, "Einfiihlung und Abstraktion -Brecht als Antipode Schillers," Sinn und Form, 17:51-28, 1965. In his attempt to create a non-Aristotelian theater, Brecht quite consciously attacked Schiller's dramatic theories. (J.R.R.) BRITISH LITERATURE Harris, Henry, "The Symbols and Imagery of Hawk and Kestrel in the Poetry of Auden and Day Lewis in the 'Thirties," Zeitschrift fiir Anglistik und Amerikanistik, 13:276-85, Third Quarter, 1965. The "preoccupation of Auden and Day Lewis with the symbols and imagery of 'Hawk' and 'Kestrel' does seem to stand out as peculiar to their work and thus to that period of English poetry as a whole." (S.A.) BRUCKNER, FERDINAND Harper, Anthony J., "Ferdinand Bruckners Behandlung des 'Pyrrhus und Andromache'- Stoffes," Maske und Kothurn, 11:97-102, (Summer) 1965. "Since Bruckner [in his Pyrrhus und An- dromache (1951) ] succeeded in creating genu- ine greatness of character, there is here the possibility for great tragedy . . . but ultimately he doesn't succeed in drawing a convincing picture of the inevitability of human self- destruction." (J.R.R.) CABELL, JAMES BRANCH Canary, Robert H., "James Branch Cabell and the Comedy of Skeptical Conservatism," Midcontinent American Studies Journal, 6: 52-60, Spring, 1965. "The fictional universe of Cabell's novels sug- gests a skepticism which can see through bour- 217</page><page sequence="3">geois ideals but cannot see beyond them. From Jurgen onwards, the novels imply that wisdom lies in a passive acceptance of the world and the social order." (W.G.F.) CARPENTIER, ALEJO Martinez-Palacio, Javier, "Los anti-heroes de Alejo Carpentier," Insula, No. 226, pp. 1, 14, September, 1965. The Latin American novel has sinned by "re- frying" European and American styles and techniques. Carpentier is an exception. With- out abandoning his "engagement" in the social world, he recognizes the prime obligation of creating art. (C.O.) Sorel, Andris, "El mundo novelistico de Alejo Carpentier," Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos, No. 182, pp. 304-18, February, 1965. A survey of his work, with emphasis on his most recent novels. "His work is an example, a path to be taken into account by all Spanish language writers." (C.O.) CATHER, WILLA Schroetter, James, "Willa Cather and The Professor's House," Yale Review, 54:494- 513, Summer, 1965. Willa Cather's anti-Semitism is most fully ex- hibited in The Professor's House. Two influ- ences created this attitude: a psychological "root" not fully understood and a cultural influence. Perhaps the latter was the virtual exclusion of the Jew from the Midwestern small town of 1870-1900. Cather's American contemporaries-Dreiser, Anderson, Fitzgerald, and Wolfe-were equally anti-Semitic. (F.L.) CHIARELLI, LUIGI Zettl, Walter, "Luigi Chiarellis Spiel 'Die Maske und das Gesicht,' " Maske und Koth- urn, 11:43-54, (Spring) 1965. Chiarelli's grotesque comedy "The Mask and the Face" (1916) has been accepted as his- torically important; because of its still impor- tant problems and the performance possibilities of the play, it should also be returned to the current repertoire. (J.R.R.) CLAUDEL, PAUL Thibaudeau, Jean, "Claudel," Tel Quel, No. 23, pp. 92-94, Autumn, 1965. With Artaud, Claudel is really the only one who has both understood the Oriental theatre and indicated all the conditions, from respira- tion and gesture to scenography, of a truly modern Occidental theatre. (T.T.B.) COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Johnson, R., "Juan Ram6n Jimenez, Rabin- dranath Tagore, and 'La Poesia Desnuda,'" Modern Language Review, 60:534-46, Oc- tober, 1965. "Jimenez himself played a greater part in the translations of Tagore published under Zen- obia Camprubi Aymar's name between 1915 and 1922 than has previously been thought, and . . . Rabindranath Tagore was a rather more important influence on Jim nez' own work than has yet been conceded." (J.R.R.) Piiiera, Humberto, "Tempo de Proust en el tiempo de Machado," La Torre, 13:137-54, January-April, 1965. The ideas of Bergson and Heidegger are clearly reflected in the ideas of Antonio Machado. But as a poet, Machado is closer to Proust. He feels time in the same way. He makes similar extensive use of memory and dream, and creates a similar mood of tedio or tempo lento. (C.O.) Tucker, Harry, Jr., "A Glance at 'Whiteness' in Melville and Camus," PMLA, 80:605, De- cember, 1965. "Melville's explicit association of 'whiteness' in nature with 'annihilation' seems related to Camus's implicit association of it with death." (W.G.F.) CONRAD, JOSEPH Ober, Warren U., "Heart of Darkness: 'The Ancient Mariner' A Hundred Years Later," Dalhousie Review, 45:333-7, Autumn, 1965. Conrad's theme is a powerfully ironic post- Darwinian parody of Coleridge's theme. (R.K.) CRITICISM Thorpe, James, "The Aesthetics of Textual Criticism," PMLA, 80:465-82, December, 1965. It is the intentions of the artist "which dis- tinguish the work of art as an order within the class of aesthetic objects, which must be protected in order to preserve the work from becoming a collaborative enterprise, which gives the integrity of completeness to the actual work of art. The inference for the textual critic is that the intentions of the artist are of controlling importance over textual work." (W.G.F.) Weimann, Robert, "Northrop Frye und das Ende des New Criticism," Sinn und Form, 17:621-30; 1965. This survey of recent American literary criti- cism---especially "the esoterically sealed struc- 218</page><page sequence="4">ture" of the New Criticism-closes with a brief look at Walter Sutton's Modern Ameri- can Criticism and the hope that its stress on the social and historical marks the beginning of a movement away from the private and the subjective of such New Critics as Frye. (J.R.R.) DAHLBERG, EDWARD Herbst, Josephine, "Edward Dahlberg's Because I Was Flesh," The Southern Review, 1: 337-51, Spring, 1965. Dahlberg's autobiography is unique, for it re- veals that his "search has been for the few great images which gained real access to his heart. They interpret, as nothing else can ever do, all the rest." (J.M.D.) DEASSIS, MACHADO Novotny, Peter, "A Poetic Corroboration of Psychoanalysis," American Imago, 22:40-6, Spring-Summer, 1965. DeAssis's novel Dom Casmurro was published in the same year as Freud's Interpretation of Dreams, and-even though he could not have known of Freud-his novel displays "an in- tuitive psychological awareness of and at times considerable similarity to some of the discover- ies of psychoanalysis." (J.M.D.) DEGUY, MICHEL Arseguel, Gerard, "Michel Deguy I'arpenteur," La Nouvelle Revue Francaise, 13eannie, No. 154, pp. 700-7, October, 1965. Deguy's poetry is turned towards the outside, plugged in directly on the perceptible and visible, listening to its pulsations, registering its movements. Yet never do time and space unfold according to a clear continuity. (T.T.B.) DESNOS, ROBERT Tortel, Jean, "Robert Desnos aujourd'hui," Critique, Nos. 219-220, pp. 718-37, August- September, 1965. Desnos' spontaneity and verbal sprightliness is ever available. He is never as fortunate in his choice of language as when he adulterates his emotion with humor or as when he is not consciously directing it, never as complex as at the moments when he confines himself to the commonplaces of love and friendship. (T.T.B.) DRAMA Aub, Max, "Pr6logo acerca del teatro espafiol de los aiios veinte de este siglo," Cuadernos Americanos, 140:194-210, May-July, 1965. A prolog to a never published collection of Spanish theater of the 20's, to have included works of Unamuno, Azorin, Grau, G6mez de la Serna, Lorca, and Aub. Aub outlines the importance of the great figures of the first decades of the century, sketches the intellectual climate of Spain in the 20's, and places each work in its context. (C.O.) Liibbren, Rainer, "Verfliichtigte Wirklichkeit," Neue Rundschau, 76:472-92, No. 3, 1965. Most of the contemporary German dramatists -Peter Hirche, Konrad Wiinsche, Wolfgang Hildesheimer, Peter Weiss-have abandoned reality and conflict as a dramaturgic essential. The result is poor theater. Only a few dramas -Rolf Hochhuth's Der Stellvertreter is the best-known example--utilize conflict as a dra- matic basis. (R.H.L.) Sol6rzano, Carlos, "El teatro hispanoamericano contemporineo," Cuadernox. No. 100, pp. 44-8, September, 1965. "Clearly, the authors are numerous and the phenomenon of renovation is a fact which in- volves the entire continent." (C.O.) DU BOUCHET, ANDRt Burgart, Jean-Pierre, "Lecture d'Andre du Bouchet," Tel Quel, No. 18, pp. 82-3, Sum- mer, 1964. By its basic impersonality, Bouchet's poetry evokes that common and singular ego that we leave buried normally under banality and compromises. By flashes, it opens up for us the luminous presence of a reality common to us all. (T.T.B.) ELIOT, THOMAS STEARNS Unger, Leonard, "A Tribute; T. S. Eliot: The Intimate Voice," The Southern Review, 1: 731-4, Summer, 1965. "I have said in effect that in Eliot's poetry we find the intimate voice of the modern sensi- bility." (J.M.D.) FAULKNER, WILLIAM Note: James W. Webb and A. Wigfall Green have edited under the collective title William Faulkner of Oxford (Louisiana State Univer- sity Press), forty-one reminiscences of Faulk- ner by his friends and neighbors, all but three of which were especially written or taped for this volume. Backman, Melvin, "Sutpen and the South: A Study of Absalom, Absalom!," PMLA, 80: 596-604, December, 1965. 219</page><page sequence="5">"Sutpen is both the pride and shame of the South. . . . His heritage is peculiarly com- pounded of accomplishment and defeat, inno- cence and guilt, pride and defensiveness . . . For his descendants, accomplishment has often become but a memory, pride has become de- lusion, and innocence has become unacknowl- edgeable guilt." (W.G.F.) Lawson, Lewis A., "The Grotesque-Comic in the Snopes Trilogy," Literature and Psychol- ogy, 15:10-19, Spring, 1965. "During the thirty years of the composition of the Snopes Trilogy the grotesque-comic sublimation had helped [Faulkner] ward off a threat, but in the process it had destroyed his fascination for the subject." (J.M.D.) Steinberg, Aaron, "Intruder in the Dust: Faulkner as Psychologist of the Southern Psyche," Literature and Psychology, 15:120- 4, Spring, 1965. "Faulkner delineates the Southern psyche on a two-fold level. He dramatizes an unconscious reason for race hatred (what Chick discovers in the grave). He shows the Southerner con- sciously reacting to this unconscious reason (the arguments of Stevens)." (J.M.D.) Stone, Emily Whitehurst, "How a Writer Finds His Material," Harper's Magazine, 231:157- 61, November, 1965. An early adventure of Phil Stone, lawyer friend of William Faulkner, became the basis and heart of Faulkner's "The Bear." Other characters in that story were modeled upon identifiable persons in the Faulkner country. (F.L.) Warren, Robert Penn, "Faulkner: The South and the Negro," The Southern Review, 1: 501-29, Summer, 1965. "If Faulkner feels the past as the repository of great images of human effort and integrity, he also sees it as the source of dynamic evil . . . If he finds in modernity a violation of the dream of the 'communal anonymity of bro- therhood,' " of nature, and of honor, he does not see it as the barred end of history; it is also the instant in which action is possible, with a choice between action as 'doom' from the past and action as affirmation." (J.M.D.) FICTION Foucault, Michel, "Debat su le roman," Tel Quel, No. 17, pp. 12-54, Spring, 1964. [A discussion of the contemporary new novel by Philippe Sellers, J. P. Faye, Claude Ollier, Mme. Durry, J. Thibeaudeau, E. Sanguineti, J. L. Baudry, Marcelin Pleynet, Gilbert Amy, M. de Gondillac and J. Tortel.] (T.T.B.) Kauffman, Stanley, "Greatness as a Literary Standard," Harper's Magazine, 231:151-6, November, 1965. Today's critics and today's readers cheat them- selves by holding to a romantic and illusory standard of greatness for the American novel of our time. Much good fiction is being writ- ten, well worthy of intelligent readers. The Great American Novel myth still haunts pub- lishers. (F.L.) Sonnenfeld, Albert, "Twentieth Century Goth- ic: Reflections on the Catholic Novel," The Southern Review, 1:388-405, Spring, 1965. "The Catholic novel thrives on the Church's adversity, and one can say, to put it historic- ally, that the Catholic novel as a literary tra- dition is limited to England . . .to Germany ... to France." (J.M.D.) Welty, Eudora, "Words into Fiction," The Southern Review, 1:543-53, Summer, 1965. "We have to remember what the novel is. Made by the imagination for the imagination, it is an illusion come full circle-a very ex- clusive thing, for all it seems to include a good deal of the world." (J.M.D.) FINNISH LITERATURE Kivimaa, Arvi, "Wie steht es mit der finnis- chen Dramatik?" Maske und Kothurn, 11: 78-88, Spring, 1965. A survey of contemporary Finnish drama shows that this art form continues to enjoy a significant, if not dizzying popularity. (J.R.R.) FORD, FORD MADOX Andreach, Robert J., "Ford's The Good Sol- dier: The Quest for Permanence and Sta- bility," Tennessee Studies in Literature, 10: 81-92, 1965. Dowell's "'rage for order' is ironic, the result of Ford's handling of the epistemological prob- lem in first person narration. Dowell is not a Jamesian character who comes to know who he is and where he is in relation to objective reality." (W.G.F.) FORSTER, EDWARD MORGAN McDowell, Frederick P. W., "E. M. Forster's Conception of the Critic," Tennessee Stud- ies in Literature, 10:93-100, 1965. Forster feels that "a critic must display the complementary qualities of sympathy and de- tachment. . . . Above all else, the critic needs sensitivity and a sensibility as supple and re- sponsive as the artist's, if he is to write at all authoritatively and interestingly." (W.G.F.) 220</page><page sequence="6">FRENCH LITERATURE Weightman, John, "The Stories Women Tell," Harper's Magazine, 231:162-7, November, 1965. The middle twentieth century has seen a num- ber of French women's autobiographies, the latest sensation being Violette Leduce's La Bdtarde. Publication of English and American women's life stories began earlier. French women's emancipation seems to be a more com- plex problem than has been thought, even by Simone Beauvoir. (F.L.) FROST, ROBERT Traschen, Isadore, "Robert Frost: Some Di- visions in a Whole Man," Yale Review, 55: 57-70, Autumn, 1965. Frost's ability to integrate his own life denied him a true tragic sense. He never "risked" his whole being, a fact which resulted in de- fects in his poetry: failure to fuse his idea of nature with his feeling, disjunction between subject matter and verse rhythm, separation of fact and feeling, and division of his subject matter from that of his age. Passionate com- mitment like Eliot's or Yeats' is absent. (F.L.) GARLAND, HAMLIN Whitford, Kathryn, "Crusader Without a Cause: An Examination of Hamlin Garland's Middle Border," Midcontinent American Studies Journal, 6:61-71, Spring, 1965. Garland combats phantoms much of the time. "The more closely one examines the history of the Middle Border, the more difficult it be- comes to reconcile Garland's Single Tax ac- tivities with his personal experiences or with the content of those stories and novels which seem to have been designed as Single Tax arguments." (W.G.F.) GERMAN LITERATURE Garcia Ponce, Juan, "El artista como h6roe (Mann, Hesse, Broch)," Re-vista Mexicana de Literatura, January-February, 1965, pp. 12-34. Mann, Hesse, and Broch, using the artist as protagonist, do so as poets of decadence, of the end of an age. The artist as exile or misfit searches to regain his place in a world where traditional values have collapsed. (C.O.) Kesten, Hermann, "Deutsche Literature-- zwanzig Jahre nach 1945," Welt und Wort, 20:327-30, Oktober, 1965. This survey of recent German literature con- cludes that "it has now become more cheerful and humane in these twenty years . . . [Now] there is a whole series of German authors with wit and reason, some can even write, a few write well. What more do you want? In our day we need most of all satirists and moralists. There are a few." (J.R.R.) Ory, Carlos Edmundo de, "Las ratas en la poesia expresionista alemana. Teoria de una constante visionaria," Cuadernos Hispano- americanos, No. 185, pp. 273-99, May, 1965. From 1760 German poetry has led the world in "funereal" themes. From Sturm und Drang through Heine, Rilke, the theater of Biichner and of Wedekind, images of ugliness, includ- ing rats, have typified the anguish of much of German literature. Such expressionists as Wer- fel, Trakl, Heym, Benn, and Lasker-Schiiler continue and intensify the use of the rat, es- pecially as an "enemy of happiness." (C.O.) GIDE, ANDRt O'Reilly, Robert F., "The Emergence of Gide's Art Form in Paludes," Symposium, 19:236- 47, Fall, 1965. Paludes is a satire on Gide's earlier works and represents an emotional change in the artist. Gide develops and perfects techniques used in later works. (C.O.) San Juan, E., Jr., "Pattern and Significance in Two Plays of Andre Gide," Discourse, 8: 350-61, Autumn, 1965. "In 'Saul,' as well as in 'Philoctetes' and 'Candaules,' Gide is concerned chiefly with the rule: 'Dare to be yourself.' " (W.G.F.) GIONO, JEAN Boisdeffre, Pierre de, "A Manosque avec Jean Giono," A La Page, No. 15, pp. 1368-76, September, 1965. Whether he is interested in the history of Do- mitian or the battle of Pavia, Giono is always a writer for whom man is the end, the rule and the measure of everything-whether he be prince or potter. If there is a "message" in Giono, it is that of giving to men the thirst and the taste of life. (T.T.B.) GREENE, GRAHAM Barratt, Harold, "Adultery as Betrayal in Graham Greene," Dalhousie Review, 45: 324-32, Autumn, 1965. "The typical Greene hero does not expect marriage to bring lasting happiness." (R.K.) Boardman, Gwenn R., "Greene's 'Under the Garden': Aesthetic Explorations," Renas- cence, 27:180-90, 194, Summer, 1965. In this story, Greene has "provided his own 221</page><page sequence="7">form of legend and figures (Javitt and Maria) who do indeed dramatize both personal fantasy and moral consciousness. This fifty-nine page story could serve also as a commentary on Greene's theory and practice of the craft of fiction." (S.A.) HARDY, THOMAS Alexander, B. J., "Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure: A Rejection of Traditional Chris- tianity's 'Good' God Theory," The Southern Quarterly, 3:74-82, October, 1964. ".. Jude [was] a man who sincerely desired and valiantly attempted to devote his life's energies to the services of the church. As Hardy emphasizes, however, no sympathetic assistance from an understanding God of good- ness and concern came to strengthen Jude in his attempt to overcome the power of the flesh...." (J.L.A.) HEMINGWAY, ERNEST Hovey, Richard B., "Hemingway's 'Now I Lay Me': A Psychological Interpretation," Literature and Psychology, 15:70-8, Spring, 1965. The story "bears striking analogies to what occurs in psychoanalytic treatment," and thus sheds light on the conflicts in other stories which portray the mother as the destroyer and the father as the weak figure who cannot pro- tect and save his manhood. (J.M.D.) Portz, John, "Allusion and Structure in Hem- ingway's 'A Natural History of the Dead,' " Tennessee Studies in Literature, 10:27-41, 1965. "A Natural History of the Dead," excerpted from Death in the Afternoon, "far from be- ing merely a horrible example of Hemingway's lapses in technique and structure, reveals much of both his method and his motives." It "sug- gests that writing fiction was one of Heming- way's methods for controlling his painful memories and fears." (W.G.F.) HERNANDEZ, MIGUEL Arendt, Erich, "Miguel Hernindez," Sinn und Form, 17:389-94, 1965. This biography of the Franco victim Hernin- dez is preceded by translations into German of ten of his poems (pp. 371-88). (J.R.R.) HILDESHEIMER, WOLFGANG Dormin, Hilde, "Denk ich an Deutschland in der Nacht," Nueue Deutsche Hefte, 107: 124-34, September-Oktober, 1965. "[Hildesheimer's] unwillingness for compro- mise and self-deception, his sense for dark, even gloomy, colors . . . force him to a cease- less conversation with himself, a ceaseless quar- rel with the aporias before which we are all put in one way or another.

Michelangelo's "Battle of Cascina" is studied as a probable influence on Hofmannsthal's "Das kleine Welt-theater." (J.R.R.) ICAZA, JORGE Campos, Jorge, "En las calles de Jorge Icaza," Insula, No. 221, p. 11, April, 1965. Written shortly after his Huasipungo, this novel has suffered undeservedly in the shadows of the more widely known one. Both novels show Icaza's social protest as well as his con- sistent trace of humor. (C.O.) IRISH LITERATURE Martin, Augustine, "Inherited Dissent: The Dilemma of the Irish Writer," Studies, 54: 1-20, Spring, 1965. "Irish writing has reached some sort of cross- roads, a time demanding re-appraisal and re- newal." This essay "examines the relationship that exists and has existed between the Irish writer and his society," and glances "at some of the more urgent problems and difficulties that confront the young creative writer in Ireland to-day." (S.A.) JACCOTTET, PHILIPPE Richard, Jean-Pierre, "Philippe Jaccottet ou I'insaisissable familiaritY," Tel Quel, No. 16, pp. 78-84, Winter, 1964. Jaccottet is not the poet of dramatic forcings, mutations, hiatus or dualisms. His gift is to surprise at the humblest level of experience the manifestations of the instinct which per- mits things to glide gently through the air towards the heights. (T.T.B.) JAMES, HENRY Murray, Donald M., "The Balcony, the Pond, and the Literary Traveler," Antioch Review, 25:333-6, Summer, 1965. "In the James novel, places are. .. are firmly fixed as symbols in the substance of action and theme." "By contrast, Thoreau's Walden uses place . . . to analyze an idea." Visits by the literary pilgrim to only the former kinds of 222</page><page sequence="8">places can be of any real value in deepening appreciation of literary works of art. (J.L.A.) Randall, John H., III, "The Genteel Reader and Daisy Miller," American Quarterly, 17: 568-81, Fall, 1965. James may have intended Daisy Miller as an attack upon stereotyped American gentility. "The genteel audience should have squirmed under self-scrutiny when it saw that the un- Manfred-like 'crimes' of Winterbourne are ex- actly the crimes of negation, exclusion from human sympathy and snobbish cruelty that were most likely to be committed by the gen- teel nineteenth-century American Puritan reader." (W.G.F.) Rovit, Earl, "The Ghosts in James's 'The Jolly Corner,' " Tennessee Studies in Literature, 10;65-72, 1965. The problem of structural unity posed by the "unnatural coincidence" of Alice Staverton's dreams with Spencer Brydon's leads to the con- clusion that "The Jolly Corner" can finally be regarded as "allegorical rather than sym- bolic in its structure," "closed" rather than t"open" in form. (W.G.F.) JOYCE, JAMES Berger, Helene, "L'avant-portrait ou La bifur- cation d'une vocation," Tel Quel, No. 22, pp, 69-76, Summer, 1965. In A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man the benefactress is a prostitute because in woman it is himself that Joyce loves. Through orgiastic satisfaction he achieves communion with himself and an experience of life, which is lived as the felix culpa-the necessary wound which makes an artist of Shakespeare in Charybdis and Scylla chapter of Ulysses and becomes in Finnegans Wake, "phoenix culpa." (T.T.B.) Carrier, Warren, "Dubliners: Joyce's Dantean Vision," Renascence, 27:211-5, Summer, 1965. Dubliners as a whole is "modeled not so much after Homer, as Richard Levin and Charles Shattuck have claimed, as after Dante." (S.A.) KAFKA, FRANZ Reed, T. J., "Kafka und Schopenhauer: Phil- osophisches Denken und dichterisches Bild," Euphorion, 59:160-72, 1965. Kafka studied Schopenhauer's writings in- tently; however, he remained essentially inde- pendent from the positive yet negative spirit of Schopenhauer's philosophy. "What he got from it was a strong stimulus, what he took from it were images and terminology." (J.R.R.) Robert, Marthe, "Franz Kafka et le 'proces' de la littirature," Tel Quel, No. 18, pp. 8-19, Summer, 1964. Kafka was not a theoretician. For him litera- ture was a passion, in the profane and religi- ous sense of the term. He follows a well es- tablished romantic tradition: that of the great novelists of the last century and early twenti- eth such as Balzac, Dickens, Zola and Gide. (T.T.B.) Robert, Marthe, "Lettres ' Minze E.," La Nouvelle Revue FranCaise, 13eannie, No. 154, pp. 635-62, October, 1965. Thirteen letters from Kafka to Minze E., dated from Winter 1919-20 to Fall 1922, which ex- press that mixture of repressed eroticism, re- spect, admiration, irony and intransigence that characterizes Kafka's relations with others. (T.T.B.) LAWRENCE, DAVID HERBERT Nichols, Ann Eljenholm, "Syntax and Style: Ambiguities in Lawrence's Twilight in Italy," College Composition and Comnmuni- cation, 16:261-6, December, 1965. The syntax of Twilight in Italy is best de- scribed as epic. Its features "stand apart from tnormal' prose syntax in much the same way that the syntax of Beowulf or Paradise Lost stands apart from the syntax of language suited to less heroic subjects."

An interview held in'July, 1936, is reproduced here with commentary and notes, calling spe- cial attention to Lorca's insistence on the social nature of such poetry as Poeta en Nueva York. (C.O.) Serrano Poncela, Segundo, "Lorca y los uni- cornios," Insula, No. 221, p. 3, April, 1965. Lorca's symbolic unicorns probably derive from the Spanish Baroque, which he knew well, rather than from Rilke or other non- Spanish sources. (C.O.) MACKENZIE, SEAFORTH Clarke, D., "Seaforth Mackenzie: Novelist of Alienation," Southerly, 25:75-90, No. 2, 1965. The "socially alienated" Mackenzie used in his four novels the broad theme of alienation. Failure to publish his Dead Men Rising (1951) in his native Australia depresses his reputation there. (S.T.) MAcORLAN, PIERRE Lanoux, Armand, "Un romantique en chandail 6cossais: Pierre Mac Orlan," A La Page, No. 17, pp. 1633-9, Nov., 1965. The hero of Mac Orlan is never the war but the soldier. The ethics of adventure color his inspirations, which, plus the decor, constitute what is constant in his very diverse work, which he calls the social fantastic. (T.T.B.) MALLARMA, STEPHANE Bolle, Louis, "Mallarm6, Igitur et Hamlet," Critique, No. 221, pp. 853-63, October, 1965. It seems strange that an exclusively lyric poet as Mallarm6 should have been haunted through- out his life by the idea of an archetypal per- sonage that proceeds all at once from the mime, buffoon, prince, priest and dancing girl. The symbolic reciprocity between the figures of his poems and his prose works could per- haps be interpreted by this archetype. (T.T.B.) MANN, THOMAS Elma, J., "Thomas Mann, Diirer und Doktor Faustus," Euphorion, 59:97-117, 1965. This illustrated article examines Dilrer's r6le in Mann's study of the failure of German bourgeois intellectuality. Elma concludes, "Al- brecht Diirer belongs in the evolutional series not simply as a chronological beginning, but also as the bright world of the early period which already bears the poison within itself."

Robichon, Jacques: "Franqois Mauriac a quatre-vingts ans," A La Page, No. 16, pp. 1504-11, October, 1965. Mauriac explores the solitude of man in the midst of his likenesses and his facility to de- lude himself concerning his vices. In these themes he is a moralist. His interpretation of the seamy side of life and the immanence of hell attach Mauriac to the tradition of Pascal, Joubery, Chamfort and Montaigne. (T.T.B.) Tartella, Vincent P., "Thematic Imagery in Mauriac's Vipers' Tangle," Renascence, 27: 195-200, Summer, 1965. The "systems of imagery that energize the novel," as well as some of its situations, have "scriptural resonances" which provide "a rich ground against which Louis' story is the mod- ern, particular figuring of a timeless, universal pattern." (S.A.) MEXICAN LITERATURE Cohen, J. M., "The Eagle and the Serpent," The Southern Review, 1:361-74, Spring, 1965. A discussion of contemporary Mexican poetry. "'Throughout the forty-five years since Lopez Velarde's Zozobra, Mexican poetry has veered between personal realism and a visionary qual- ity, the imagery of which is colored by the tropical or semi-tropical landscape of the country." (J.M.D.) MONTHERLANT, HENRY DE Gouhier, Henri, "La religion dans le thiitre de Montherlant," La Table Ronde, No. 22, pp. 5-11, September, 1965. Montherlant envisions Christianity as a princi- ple of surpassing the world as it is: a soul detiched from the goods of this world and from itself; a liberation which rids the ego of passions and results in the annihilation of the ego itself. (T.T.B.) MUSIL, ROBERT Henninger, Peter, "Le dernier livre de Robert 224</page><page sequence="10">Musil," Critique, No. 221, pp. 841-52, Oc- tober, 1965. Throughout his career, Musil has not ceased laying claim to a part of his work, multiplying references to his previous works and recom- mencing repeatedly an historical account in which he tries to define the precise place and function of them. (T.T.B.) NERUDA, PABLO Lozada, Alfredo, "Residencia en la tierra: al- gunas correcciones," Revista Hispdnica Mod- erna, 30:108-18, April, 1964. Neruda's changes in later editions of certain poems shows the poet's concern for the crea- tion as finished product. The changes evidence a tendency toward greater conciseness and a more fertile imagination. (C.O.) O'CONNOR, FLANNERY Le Clezio, J. M. G., "L'univers de Flannery O'Connor," La Nouvelle Revue Franfaise, 13eann&amp;, No. 153, pp. 488-93, September, 1965. O'Connor depicts man a prisoner in a cursed universe. Consequently he can only be a fa- natic. His ideas have more importance than his daily acts because they motivate them. Reality has no longer such importance. Inter- ior motivation is what counts. (T.T.B.) O'GORMAN, NED Kelly, Richard, "In Praise of Beauty: Ned O'- Gorman," Renascence, 27:171-9, Summer, 1965. Ned O'Gorman's critical neglect is unfortun- ate because "he offers both vigor and a deep sense of mystery to an age of poetry that at one extreme deifies the rational and well- wrought poem and at the other the Emotional Self that clinically unfolds itself in metaphoric prose." (S.A.) ORWELL, GEORGE Colquitt, Betsy Feagan, "Orwell: Traditional- ist in Wonderland," Discourse, 8:370-83, Autumn, 1965. "The body of Orwell's writings affirms that his general intellectual position was always traditional; his early works show commitment to such beliefs with the tenacity and aplomb of Carroll's heroine if not with her optimism." But the last novels suggest the plight of a tragic, modern Alice "whose wonderland is an anti-utopia." (W.G.F.) PAREZ DE AYALA, RAM6N Soldevila-Durante, Ignacio, "Ram6n Pdrez de Ayala. De 'Sentimental Club' a 'La revo- luci6n sentimental,"'" Cudernos Hispano- americanos, No. 181, pp. 5-19, January, 1965. "Sentimental Club," a forgotten early story of Perez de Ayala, links him with the London literary scene of that time (1909), as well as with the ideas of Shaw, J. Huxley, and H. G. Wells. A revised version of the story (1959) reveals quite a different man. (C.O.) PIERCE, OVID WILLIAMS Betts, Doris, "The House by the River: Ovid Williams Pierce," South Atlantic Quarterly, 64:283-95, Summer, 1965. In three novels, one yet unpublished, Pierce has employed and transcended regional ele- ments to depict " 'life in its fundamental terms,' " In each, the theme of "the effect on man of time" is conveyed through the image of a house, man's "piece of perma- nence," beside a river, "the flow of Time." (J.L.A.) POETRY Bousoiio, Carlos, "La sugerencia en la poesia contemporanea," Revista de Occidente, 7: 188-208, November, 1964. Suggestion, insinuation, a "miniloquence" by contrast with the grandiloquence of the Ro- mantics, is the central phenomenon of poetry since Baudelaire. Not simply a rhetorical de- vice, it implies a changed concept of the na- ture of art. (C.O.) Brooks, Cleanth, "Poetry Since The Waste- land," The Southern Review, 1:487-500, Summer, 1965. "It seems certain that poetry will continue for a long time to revolve around the matter of man's consciousness-the consciousness which separates him from the other animals and alienates him from nature but which at the same time is the very power that allows him to see nature, as it were, from the outside and to see himself in the very act of seeing it." (J.M.D.) Mandel, Oscar, "Why Poetry?" Antioch Re- view, 25:239-47, Summer, 1965. Modern poetry is slack in rhythm and affected in figure because it is demoralized and has nothing new to say. The demoralization re- sults from a sub-conscious awareness that science has marched ahead in new discoveries while poetry, by its nature, can only attempt to express in charged language familiar prop- ositions.

(J.M.D.) Tate, Allen, "The Unilateral Imagination: Or, I, too, Dislike It," The Southern Review, 1: 530-42, Summer, 1965. "We must distinguish great poetry from the egotistical sublime (Wordsworth's style) and from Godwin-Methodism (Shelley's style).

PROKOSCH, FREDERIC Cluny, Claude Michel, "Frtdric Prokosch," La Nouvelle evue Francaise, 13eannie, No. 155, pp. 886-93, November, 1965. The Asiatics (1935) prefigures all subsequent work of Prokosch down to and including The Sisters (1962), the ensemble of which charac- terizes him as part of the uprooted writers that each American generation has known since Melville. His novels are attempts at the ex- ploration of the self through space and time. (T.T.B.) PROUST, MARCEL Bell, William S., "'Proust's 'Un amour de Swann,' A Voyage to Cytherea," L'Esprit Criateur, 26-37, Spring, 1965. Like Baudelaire's voyager, Proust, the narrator, sets out on a quest for the country of love and finds it sterile. In both cases, love is an actively destructive force. At the end of the voyage, Baudelaire's adventurer, like Swann, finds there only his own image. (T.T.B.) Bersani, Jacques, "Proust exposh," Critique, Nos. 219-220, pp. 781-5, August-Septem- ber, 1965. Proust is one of the most pathetic of all writ- ers. He lacks the romantic exalted side of a Balzac, or Hugo, even that of a Musset. How- ever, he placed all his talent in the living setting of his works. (T.T.B.) Brie, Germaine, "lean Santeuil: An Appraisal," L'Esprit Criateur, 5:14-25, Spring, 1965. In sharp contrast to Pleasures and Days, Proust's Jean Santeuil is an ambitious and intricate novel abounding in skillfully nar- rated passages ranging from the delicate to the quasi-Balzacian. Nevertheless, Proust did not succeed in creating an integrated fictional world. (T.T.B.) Giilich, Elisabeth, "Die Metaphorik der Erin- nerung in Prousts 'A la recherche du temps perdu,' " Zeitschrift fiir franz6sische Sprache under Literatur, 75:51-74, April, 1965. This study of Proust's metaphorical presenta- tion of memories concludes that "the fabric of memories corresponds not only to Proust's theory of memory but also to his technique of presentation; through the tying of the threads of memory there emerges a pattern of high artistic quality which makes clear at the same time the strictly thought out and ingeniously executed composition of the work of art." (J.R.R.) Houston, John Porter, "Literature and Psy- 226</page><page sequence="12">chology: The Case of Proust," L'Esprit Crd- ateur, 5:3-13, Spring, 1965. In creation of characters Proust liberated the narrow, somewhat mechanical concepts of per- sonality in which Flaubert and Zola were con- fined. His innovations in the portrayal of characters did not transform the novel for he has had few distinguished imitators-the most striking one being Lawrence Durrell, whose Justine owes much to Proust. (T.T.B.) Kolb, Philip, "Proust's Protagonist as a 'Bea- con,' " L'Esprit Crdateur, 5:38-47, Spring, 1965. The real protagonist of Proust's novel is not Time, as has been suggested, but the Narrator. Strictly speaking, Time is just a major theme, closely interwoven with that of Memory. (T.T.B.) Naughton, Helen Thomas, "A Contemporary Views Proust," L'Esprit Crdateur, 5:48-55, Spring, 1965. Prior to Proust, novelists limited themselves to the search for motives of action. Absurdity had been stressed by Dada and the Surrealists. Proust fixed with his gaze the subconscious which had flowed unchecked. He refused to accept the notion of human absurdity, of the unfathomability of the human soul. (T.T.B.) QUENEAU, RAYMOND Chessex, Jacques, "Raymond Queneau, sage et savant," La Nouvelle Revue Franeaise, 13e annie, No. 153, pp. 475-9, September, 1965. Queneau reveals to us solitude, boredom, tragic life, ruin and death. He philosophizes constantly but in such a manner that his read- ers are amused, not realizing that beneath the veneer of parody, comical ideas and fantasy lies a singular enterprise of criticism and de- struction. (T.T.B.) ROBBE-GRILLET, ALAIN Anzieu, Didier, "Les discours de l'obsessionnel dans les romans de Robbe-Grillet," Les Tem s Modernes, 21eannee, No. 233, pp. 608-37, October, 1965. The specific articulation between the latent dramatic kernel of the novels of Robbe-Grillet and the manifest structure of the text is a prime example of obsessional neurosis. The real problem is that of Oedipus. (T.T.B.) Faye, Jean Pierre, '"Nouvelle analogie?" Tel Quel, No. 17, pp. 3-11, Spring, 1964. According to Robbe-Grillet the condition of man is to be there. Going further, in his work things and objects will be there before being something. He contains in his work the best of Kafka, Sartre, Camus and Roussel. (T.T.B.) Pingaud, Bernard, "L'oeuvre et l'analyste," Les Temps Modernes, 21eannie, No. 233, pp. 638-46, October, 1965. Robbe-Grillet's novels are rich in hidden meanings and an analyst has the right to ex- amine them but he condemns himself then to neglect the form of the novel and to treat it as an enigma for which he must find the key. The characteristic of the work is to maintain in it a plurality of meanings. (T.T.B.) Ricardou, Jean, "La querelle de la metaphore," Tel Quel, No. 18, pp. 56-67, Summer, 1964. Robbe-Grillet disparages the use of the meta- phor but he knows only anthropomorphic metaphors and considers the phenomenon only as an entity. He really objects to a single category of metaphors, that of external orien- tation, but rejects the ensemble in order not to accept what he refuses to admit. (T.T.B.) ROETHKE, THEODORE Eberhart, Richard, "On Theodore Roethke's Poetry," The Southern Review, 6:612-20, Summer, 1965.

Rulfo's uniqueness resides in his ability to cre- ate a purely regional scene (rural Jalisco, Mexico), omitting what is peculiarly regional and presenting what is essentially human. Though he carefully excludes all reference to the non-regional, his result is universality. (C.O.)

Shvart's staging of The Naked Emperor, based upon Anderson's tale is "social and political criticism of con- temporary life." Volodin's The Appointment uses street language, recognizably human char- acters, and is politically critical. Playwrights like Radzinsky (in 104 Pages of Love) violate the Soviet dogma against tragedy on the stage. (F.L.) SALINGER, JEROME DAVID Seitzman, Daniel, "Salinger's 'Franny': Homo- erotic Imagery," American Imago, 22:57-76, Spring-Summer, 1965. There is a similarity of attitudes in Lane and Franny. "Each character attacks the other as though a relationship is possible only on the basis of a symbiotic union. . . . But since there is only one model possible for a relation- ship, and since symbiosis works in two direc- tions, there is deep fear that each will lose his difference and his separateness in the other." (J.M.D.) SARRAUTE, NATHALIE Finas, Lucette, "Nathalie Sarraute ou les Mita- morphoses du verbe," Tel Quel, No. 20, pp. 68-77, Winter, 1965. From Tropismes to the Fruits d'Or, Sarraute's novels suggest two states of the language: the pronounced language which is that of the dia- logues, woven of commonplaces, formulas, ac- cepted ideas; and the other language which is silent which she translates into visionary equivalences.

As critic and philosopher, Sartre has, with rank prejudice, the tendency to take certain words and certain expressions in their most common and vulgar meaning and acceptation, rather than to elucidate their exact sense. (T.T.B.) SCHNITZLER, ARTHUR Jiger, Manfred, "Schnitzlers 'Leutnant Gustl,' " Wirkendes Wort, 15:308-16, September-Ok- tober, 1965. One is tempted to regard Schnitzler's works as too temporally bound and thus to restrict his achievements to stylistics. We should note that "what he ironically presented were an objective condition of consciousness in a con- crete milieu before [World War I] and, be- yond that, general structures of prejudice which will not disappear with that epoch." (J.R.R.) SNOW, CHARLES PERCY Smith, LeRoy W., "C. P. Snow as Novelist: A Delimitation," South Atlantic Quarterly, 64:316-31, Summer, 1965. "... for two important reasons-limitation of moral vision and artistic inadequacy-Srnow does not appear to match the performance of the major English novelists. . ...

(J.M.D.) THEORY OF LITERATURE Slochower, Harry, "Symbolism and the Crea- tive Process," American Imago, 22:112-27, Spring-Summer, 1965. "The over-all thesis of this paper is that the high norm of mental health in the creative process is not homeostatic adaptation with ab- sence of stresses and tensions. The urge for creating presupposes 'dis-ease' and dissatisfac- tion with what is, entails a desire to reshape and transcend." (J.M.D.) Vivas, Eliseo, "The Self and Its Masks," The Southern Review, 1:317-36, Spring, 1965. Imaginative literature and depth psychology are "in principle distinct, having different aims, and . . . no benefit can come to the poet who substitutes his creative observation for the psychological handbook." (J.M.D.) THURBER, JAMES Holmes, Charles S., "James Thurber and the Art of Fantasy," Yale Review, 55:17-33, Autumn, 1965. Thurber's central theme is man's precarious life in a mechanized world of large organiza- tions and mass-mindedness, where aggressive women threaten his masculinity. Through ir- rational fancy the Walter Mittys find some compensation for inadequacy in a world where communication is lacking. This lack and the necessity for irrational compensation serve as sources for Thurber's fantasy. (F.L.) TROPES Isaacs, Neil D., "The Autoerotic Metaphor in Joyce, Sterne, Lawrence, Stevens, and Whit- man," Literature and Psychology, 15:92- 106, Spring, 1965. "The characteristics indicative of autoerotic metaphors-rocking motions, explosions, prac- ticing musical instruments, experiencing touches of water-are trite, obvious, banal." (J.M.D.) TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE- GENERAL Kibel, Alvin C., "'Tradition' and the New Art," American Scholar, 34:413-29, Sum- mer, 1965. "Since . . . the eighteenth century ... tra- dition in the arts . . . no longer derives from the general continuity of human life, and ar- tists have [developed] . . . mechanisms where- by to nourish their own work upon . . . the artistic past. . ... The [Romantic] notion of art as paradigm is one . . .' Eliot's 'timeless continuum' of aesthetic forms is another." (J.L.A.) le Carri, John, "What Every Writer Wants," Harper's Magazine, 231:142-5, November, 1965. A writer wants freedom. The nearest he comes to achieving it is in telling his story "as best he can, and having done so . . . get on with another." His only "sovereignty" lies in his private world, however much the "keys of the city" may lure him. (F.L.) Mandel, Oscar, "Sore Literature and Discon- tented Science," South Atlantic Quarterly, 64:308-15, Summer, 1965. "Social usefulness makes the scientist happy, uselessness has soured the writer." The modern artist's pessimistic "vision of the world .. arises from his own relegation to the margin of society, and not at all from an unprece- dented insight into truth." He is guilty of "resentment" and "spiteful art." (J.L.A.) Pryce-Jones, Alan, "How to Act Like a Writer in New York and London," Harper's Mag- azine, 231:146-50, November, 1965. The English cling to amateur status in litera- ture, as in everything else. In the United States the close relationship between the crea- tive and the academic makes the American writer more serious (professional). The Amer- ican writer has independence, "gusto," and great industry; the British has elegance, inti- macy (because crowded in London with other writers), and "unexpectedness." (F.L.) 229</page><page sequence="15">UNAMUNO, MIGUEL DE Blanco Aguinaga, Carlos, "Aspectos dial6cti- cos de las Tres novelas ejemplares," Revista de Occidente, 7:51-70, October, 1964. Though Unamuno was clearly anti-Hegelian as early as 1902, he admits a great debt to Hegel. He preserves the notion of the dialectic, giv- ing it an existential interpretation. A key work in this sense is Niebla. A more syste- matic presentation of the dialectic nature of his querer ser (will to be) can be found in his Tres novelas ejemplares. (C.O.) Ferrater Mora, Jose, "Unamuno, 1964," Re- vista de Occidente, 7:29-40, October, 1964. Unamuno is always eminently personal. His philosophy of personality, his personality. (C.O.) Rof Carballo, Juan, "El erotismo en Una- muno," Revista de Occidente, 7:71-96, Oc- tober, 1964. Although Unamuno's fictional characters are notoriously sketchy, far from being complete human beings, and thus apparently hardly ade- quate for themes of love, he has nevertheless approached a peculiarly Spanish eroticism with unprecedented profundity. (C.O.) UTOPIAN LITERATURE Eckstein, Rudolf, and Caruth, Elaine, "From Eden to Utopia," American Imago, 22:128- 41, Spring-Summer, 1965. A discussion of the psychological meaning of utopias, including mention of Golding's Lord of the Flies, Hilton's Lost Horizon, Huxley's Brave New World, Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm, and Skinner's Walden II. (J.M.D.) VALtRY, PAUL Faye, Jean Pierre, "Valfry politique," Tel Quel, No. 23, pp. 89-90, Autumn, 1965. One of the first Frenchmen of letters to join the new school of semantics, Valkry was pre- occupied with words which constitute a group of two members, one physical, the other mental. His attention deciphered many things in the bizarre ensemble of human language, "composed of fixed signs and ideas." (T.T.B.) Genette, Gerard, "Valery et l'axiomatique lit- teraire," Tel Quel, No. 23, pp. 75-82, Au- tumn, 1965. There is in Val'ry an idea of literature which is both very modern and very ancient, and which approaches not only contemporary For- malism (that of the New American Criticism) and even more that of the Russian school of the 1920s, but also the presesnt researches of structuralism. (T.T.B.) VALLEJO, CPSAR Lora Risco, Alejandro, "C6sar Vallejo y la guerra civil espafiola," Cuadernos Hispano- americanos, No. 183, pp. 553-83, March, 1965. Lora Risco contests the oft made assertion of Vallejo's Marxism and his socially oriented poetry. He examines the striking lack of such poetry in Vallejo, even in such works as Es- paia, aparta de mi este cdliz. Vallejo is, rather, an eminently human poet, working to revitalize a decadent literary language, often making pronouncements tinged with Marxist rhetoric. (C.O.) WEDEKIND, FRANK Shaw, Leroy R., "Frank Wedekind zum 100. Geburtstag," Maske und Kothurn, 11:103- 9, (Summer) 1965. Wedekind "wanted to find the source of his happiness in his unhappiness. He wanted to play the r6le of a martyr, a modern Christ, whose vision is fulfilled when he is crucified, or, on the other hand, to present himself as a clown, the indestructible Hanswurst, who smilingly stays on his feet in spite of all mis- fortune." (J.R.R.) WILLIAMS, TENNESSEE Da Ponte, Durant, "Tennessee Williams' Gal- lery of Feminine Characters," Tennessee Studies in Literature, 10:7-26, 1965. Williams truly excels "in his ability to create striking feminine portraits" of a gallery of types which "he has succeeded in investing with one common quality-an ability to fas- cinate." (Note: The 1965 issue of the annual Tennessee Studies is dedicated to the memory of Mr. Da Ponte, who died in an airplane crash in 1964.) (W.G.F.) WOLFE, THOMAS Paschal, Reeves, "Thomas Wolfe on Publish- ers: Reaction to Rejection," South Atlantic Quarterly, 64:385-9, Summer, 1965. "The recipient of Wolfe's wrath toward pub- lishers . . was the firm which was the first to reject [his first book]. One of Wolfe's most caustic satires is his account of the pub- lishing firm of 'Rawng and Wright' in Chap- ter 32 of The Web and the Rock. .. " (J.L.A.) WOOLF, VIRGINIA Garnett, David, "Virginia Woolf," American Scholar, 34:371-86, Summer, 1965. "One of her chief interests . . . is relative 230</page><page sequence="16">movement." Secondly, "the prose is like poe- try." The theme of Mrs. Dalloway, "one of the great novels in the English language," is the spiritual death of a woman who chose "traditions of her class" rather than, like Vir- ginia, "personal freedom and spontaneity." (J.L.A.) Samuelson, Ralph, "More than One Room of Her Own: Virginia Woolf's Critical Dilem- mas," Western Humanities Review, 19:249- 57, Summer, 1965. A tension arises between Woolf's insistence on woman's equality with men and simultaneously on their difference and autonomy. Also she states in A Room of Her Own that "the best writers are 'androgynous.' " Her inconsisten- cies reveal the artist's mind "grinding away" at dilemmas not yet resolved and in the proc- ess of transformation into art. (F.L.) YEATS, WILLIAM BUTLER Haerdter, Michael, "William Butler Yeats- Irisches Theater zwischen Symbolismus und Expressionismus," Maske und Kothurn, 11: 30-42, (Spring) 1965. The author undertakes the "thankless task of defending Yeats the dramatist and the per- formability of his plays." (J.R.R.) Malone, G. P., "William Butler Yeats: A Cen- tenary Tribute," Contemporary Review, 207:96-9, August, 1965. Yeats was Anglo-Irish, not a scion of native Gaelic stock. He gradually grew detached from the affairs of both England and Ireland. Yeats disliked the middle class, was fond of the peasantry, but also had an aristocratic flair. He hated science; he abhorred Communism, and democracy did not appeal to him. His vision was Utopian. (F.L.) 231</page></plain_text>
