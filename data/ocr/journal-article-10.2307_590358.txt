Bryant Intellectuals and religion in Ancient Greece: notes on a Weberian theme* ABSTRACT At the analytical core of Max Weber's sociology of religion is the attempt to relate diverse religious values, beliefs, and needs to the class and status positions of different social groups and strata. Within this framework the role of religious 'intellectuals' priests, prophets, and others is singularly important in that they are typically responsible for the development of systematic conceptions or 'world images' of the relations between the divine and human realms, and for expounding and codifying the ritual, canonical, and ethical obligations which are mandated by these religious ideas. In ancient Greece, however, the principal carriers of intellectualism and theological rationalization were not priests or prophets, but secular philosophers who lacked religious authority. This essay examines the social causes and consequences of this unique circumstance, especially as it relates to the Weberian concern with religious rationalization. After a brief account of the historical origins of Greek polytheism, the religious views expressed by the poets Homer and Hesiod are discussed and related to the material and ideal interests of the strata which comprised their respective audiences, the warrior-aristocracy and the peasantry. There follows a detailed examination of the religious rationalism of the early Greek philosophers, whose theological tenets are shown to strikingly confirm Weber's observations regarding the religious propensities of intellectual strata. The influence of intellectualism upon the 'destiny of religions'l is one of the more complex subjects in Max Weber's wide-ranging compara- tive studies; it is also one of the most important. In accordance with the fact that certain intellectual groups or strata priests, prophets, bureaucratic literati, monastic monks, and others have typically played a prominent role in the creation and transmission of religious values, much of Weber's work is devoted to providing sociological portraits of these various 'carriers' ( Trager) of intellectualism, The British Journal of Sociology Volume XVXVII Number 2</page><page sequence="2">270 Joseth M. Bryant identifying their material and ideal interests, the afEnity of their teachings with the religious needs of the lay population, and the 'power position' (Machtstellung) which they hold vis-a-vis other strata. One particularly significant development which attends the ascendency of certain of these 'carriers' (two of Weber's classic examples are the prophets of Ancient Israel and the Puritan divines) is the 'rational- ization of religious life', a process marked by the displacement or sublimation of traditional magical beliefs and practices, and the establishment of a more coherent religious metaphysic and ritual. Wherever such groups either did not arise or failed to achieve an independent status of social significance, or where the principal carriers of intellectualism were secular rather than sacerdotal, the rationalization of religious life, notes Weber, was 'fragmentary or entirely missing'.2 The object of the present study is to investigate the relationship of intellectualism to the religion of the ancient Greeks, frequently cited by Weber as a primary example of a partially rationalized religion. In his most comprehensive discussion of the diverse influences of intellectualism upon religion, Weber lays great emphasis on the basic social psychological orientation of intellectuals, which he variously characterizes as entailing 'an inner compulsion to understand the world as a meaningful cosmos', a 'demand that the world and the total pattern of life be subject to an order that is significant and meaningful', and so on.3 Although this orientation is shaped in any particular case by a host of distinct historical and sociological circumstances, most forms of intellectualism, religiously-based as well as secular, express this 'natural rationalistic need' at least to some degree.4 As notable products of this intellectual rationalism channeled into religious form, Weber points to the Hindu doctrine of Karma and its Buddhist variant, the Book of Job, Gnostic speculation, and Manicheanism.5 It will be demonstrated here that the theological reflections of the earliest Greek philosophers manifest a similar orientation. I THE COMPOSITE NATURE OF EARLY GREEK RELIGION Over the course of several centuries during the first half of the second millenium B.C., various Indo-European peoples invaded the Mediter- ranean basin and either expelled, conquered, or merged with the indigenous populations. One of these northern invaders, the Mycen- aeans, eventually developed an advanced civilization on the Greek mainland which was centered in a number of heavily fortified palace- complexes, ruled by kings and their warriors, administered by bureaucratic functionaries, and sustained by the labours of peasants, slaves, and craftsmen.6 Extensive trade relations with Egypt, the</page><page sequence="3">Intellectuals and religion in Ancient Greece 271 Minoans, and the peoples of the Levant brought the Mycenaeans both material gain and cultural enrichment, as attested by an archaeological record filled with artefacts imported from the older Mediterranean civilizations and by the survival of Near Eastern elements in early Greek myth and legend. Mycenaean military prowess was such that dominion was extended over the declining Minoans of Crete around 1400 B.C., and colonies were established in numerous Aegean islands, in parts of Anatolia, and on Cyprus. Over the next two centuries, however, Mycenaean civilization entered a phase of decline, probably related to the numerous wars whose traces remain in the archaeological record and in the memories preserved in such legends as the sailing of the Argo, the assault on Thebes, and the Trojan War. Fresh waves of Indo-Europeans began penetrating Greece in the late thirteenth century, their treks southward resulting in the displacement of settled populations and the destruction of virtually all of the major palace-complexes. With the violent collapse of Mycenaean society, the Greek world entered a lengthy Dark Age (roughly 1200 to 800 B.C.), initially characterized by a major decline in material culture, massive depopulation, administrative disorder, and frequent internal migrations.7 Out of the rubble of the old civilization and the influx of additional warrior-peoples a new social order gradually took form, consisting of nucleated agrarian settlements which were organized as communal associations under the political leadership of warrior-kings and the leading noble families. From this basis the Greek Polis or 'city-state' would eventually emerge.8 Although the discontinuity in social organization between the world of the Mycenaeans and that of the Dark Age Greeks was virtually complete, numerous cultural elements were preserved, particularly in the areas of religion and myth. Thus whereas the history of the Polis is essentially post-Mycenaean, Greek religion has a much older and more complex pedigree, retaining diverse elements from a number of different sources.9 The Mycenaean legacy was itself an amalgam, composed of Indo-European features which had been fused with the practices and beliefs of the pre-Greek populations, and subsequently modified under the strong cultural influence of the Minoans and their Near Eastern contacts. Later migratory peoples, including the invaders who destroyed the palaces, introduced additional novel elements. Although the fragmentary empirical record does not allow us to distinguish these specific contributions in detail, historians have identified the core elements: derived from the older Aegean 'substrate' were agrarian fertility cults, the earth-mother, theriomorphic deities, nature spirits, and sundry chthonic powers; from the conquering Indo-European invaders, gods of the tribe and clan, and deities with patriarchal and martial traits; and from both the indigenous and migratory peoples, a variety of communal, ancestral, and domestic cults. Innumerable deities and spirits of</page><page sequence="4">272 Joseph M. Bryant diverse cultural origins thus co-existed in a loose-fitting composite polytheism, the complexity of which was further extended by a variety of regional and local differences in cultic practice. II THE EMERGENCE OF THE PANTHEON In his discussion on the origins of Greek religious beliefs and practices, the fifth century historian Herodotus observed that it was Homer and Hesiod 'who composed for the Greeks the genealogy of the gods, gave the gods their names, distributed their honours and functions, and depicted their forms'.lÂ° That two non-sacerdotal poets should have been responsible for establishing the cognitive religious universe of a people is a striking social phenomenon; but that was essentially the case with the ancient Greeks, and it provides the key to understanding both the nature and history of their religion. From the time of Fustel de Coulanges to the present, historians have stressed that religion was an integral part of social life within the Polis; and, indeed, there was virtually no activity which did not have a religious dimension: from fertility magic in the countryside to the exorcism of demons in the workshop, from the taking of auspices for war and politics to tendance of the dead and the purification of marriage and childbirth, from the confraternal bonding of communal feasts and festivals to athletic competitions and sundry forms of artistic expression even the simple act of consuming a meal was preceded by a ritual offering. It is an important sociological fact, however, that despite this extensive permeation of religion into all spheres of daily life, the Greeks never developed an independent hierocratic organization responsible for the administration of religious practices, nor a clerically educated professional priesthood. In the civic religion of the Greeks, responsibility for the maintenance of cultic activities was vested in the political apparatus of the Polis, which included a small number of lay officials known as hiereis (conventionally translated as 'priests'), all of whom were members of the citizen body either elected or appointed for temporary terms of office, though in some cases the positions were hereditary. Most importantly, these administrative functionaries were not possessed of any distinctive religious charisma or knowledge, nor did they monopolize or control communication with the gods; the routinized performance of various rites and the management of sacred property (temples, lands, dedications) constituted their basic duties. As for the other main category of religious personnel, the manteis or 'seers', they operated as professional free-lance advisors in both public and private capacities, but their activities were similarly confined to a formal ritualism: examining the entrails of sacrificial animals for omens,</page><page sequence="5">Intellectuals and religion in Ancient Greece 273 interpreting the messages of the gods as registered in meteorological phenomena, the flight of birds, and so on. The consequences of this pattern of institutionalization were far- reaching, for with the lay citizenry (rather than a corporate priesthood) exercising control over cultic enterprises, Greek religious life remained embedded in the traditional practices of ritualism and magic, the basic aims of which were utilitarian: to avert worldly evils and induce benefits through sundry apotropaic, propitiatory, and honorific modes of sacrifice and worship. As Weber notes, this 'practical and calculating rationalism' of do ut des (I give so that you may give) is the basic character of all 'everyday and mass religiosity' (Alltags- und Massenreligiositat) an orientation that is transcended or modified only with the emergence of special 'carriers' freed from direct everyday concerns, i.e. specialists involved in the continuous operation of religious activities and the canonization of doctrine.ll Not only did the Greeks lack such specialists, but with the emphasis of ofEcial religion on ritual rather than creed, the scope for theological speculation was remarkably open. Inasmuch as poets were from time immemorial the traditional 'educators of the people', it naturally fell to them to relate the ways of the gods to mankind. (a) The Homeric Tradition The supreme poet for the Greeks was of course Homer, whose Iliad and Odyssey represent the artistic culmination of a centuries-old tradition of oral poetry.l2 Conventional questions of authorship and dating are accordingly somewhat inappropriate since oral composition adheres to its own pattern of development, marked by the gradual accretion of a highly standardized poetical vocabulary of fixed phrases and stock set-pieces which are 'stitched together' by the singer into a uniform metrical structure. Authorship is thus both personal and collective, as each individual singer draws upon the vast store of traditional materials and refashions it extemporaneously as the occasion and his inspiration dictate. The question of overriding sociological importance is accordingly not who 'composed' the two epic masterpieces or when, but rather when did they become the common possession of the Greek people. On the basis of archaeological evidence (such as the depiction of celebrated epic scenes on painted- pottery) and the manifest borrowing of Homeric materials by later poets, most historians suggest the latter half of the eighth century. The actual process of transmission was carried out by wandering singers and rhapsodists who regularly presented the two masterworks (along with lesser epic materials) at various regional and local festivals and in the homes of noble patrons. Transmission was also facilitated by the return of writing to Greece around 725 B.C., this time in the form of an alphabetical script which the Greeks borrowed from the Phoenicians and transformed through the revolutionary invention of vowels, a great simplifying advance which allowed for</page><page sequence="6">274 Joseph M. Bryant general literacy (unlike the complex scribal syllabary of the Mycenaeans which had been lost during the Dark Age period). Once disseminated, the poems of Homer exercised an unrivalled and enduring influence on all of subsequent Greek culture; the artistic mastery of the epics, the comprehensive Weltanschauung which they present in such compelling fashion, and the fact that the Greeks treated the epics as records of their early history all made Homer's pre-eminence as 'the educator of Hellas' inevitable.l3 As is well- known, his 'teachings' were decidedly aristocratic, a fact reflecting the social circumstances within which the epic art-form emerged and functioned. Given the preoccupation of the poems with the adventures, life-style, and moral ethos of warrior-nobles, it cannot be doubted that the epics originally served as a form of aristocratic entertainment and as a medium for the celebration of aristocratic ideals. This is confirmed not only by the examples of other traditions of epic poetry, such as the Teutonic and the Anglo-Saxon, but also by Homer's own artistic depiction of court poets in the Odyssey, where the characters Demodocus and Phemius regale banqueting nobles with inspirational songs on 'the glorious deeds of heroes'. Although both poems are composite works, containing orally-preserved materials from several distinct historical periods, the institutional and cultural matrix of the epics is generally thought to reflect conditions spanning the tenth and eighth centuries, the period when Greece was recovering from the material poverty of the immediate post-Mycenaean era. 14 With Homer as our principal witness, and relying on the implications of later historical developments and the archaeologist's spade to establish the reliable parameters of his testimony, let us briefly examine the heroic world of Agamemnon and Achilles, as this will have a significant bearing on the interpretation of Homeric religion. The social order of the Dark Age period was dominated by petty kings and nobles, collectively known as the aristoi or 'best people', whose power derived from their martial prowess and superior wealth (chiefly in lands and livestock, precious metals, and slaves). Political afEairs were controlled by the king in conjunction with a council of elders and the foremost warriors, and major public issues were aired before the demos or 'people' in the place of assembly. The vast majority of these commoners, often simply referred to as the 'multitude', were independent peasants, though some were landless and compelled to toil as labourers on noble estates. A limited number of craftsmen also operated within these communities, their production geared towards satisfying local demand. The social gulf between the ruling aristoi and the demos was quite wide, as the nobles maintained a distinctively seignorial style of life which featured conspicuous display (feasting, fine raiment, chariots, munificent gift-exchanges) and a moral code based upon thilotimia, the competitive quest for glory and honour (time). Given the centrality of the warrior role in the nobleman's</page><page sequence="7">Intellectuals and religion in Ancient Greece 275 pattern of life, a function which both legitimized his political dominance and garnered additional wealth through booty, it is hardly surprising that arete or 'excellence' was primarily demonstrated by feats of martial prowess, such as the sacking of cities, plundering, and the slaughtering of other warriors in the travails of combat. The moral vocabulary of the epics reveals the regnant value system: the principal terms of commendation, esthlos and agathos (both conveying the notion of 'good'), are generally applied to acts of bravery, fighting efficiency, and noble birth, while the terms of derogation, kakos ('bad') and deilos ('vile', 'worthless'), are used to signify cowardice, ineffective fighting, and men of common birth.l5 Ethical standards were thus largely determined by class distinctions and the performance-demands of the warrior role. The divine realm depicted in the epics mirrors the world of the earthly aristocracy in all essentials, excepting the gods' immortality and immense powers. Thus Zeus, like Agamemnon, holds assemblies in which others can counsel, but he himself retains ultimate authority. As befits any of the great nobles, the Olympians dwell in palatial abodes replete with servants, and they share the heroic delight in banquet and song. The gods are also regularly portrayed in such mundane activities as riding in chariots, arming for battle, and sleeping in beds. In short, their characterization is extensively anthropomorphic. Their motivations and ideals likewise conform to heroic standards. Although the Olympians have 'greater arete- and time-' than men, they are no less zealous in pursuing or defending these concerns. The honour which mortals are expected to show the gods is manifested through sacrificial offerings and by prayer-invocations which express gratitude or recognition of divine glory. Should a person neglect a sacrifice or fail to acknowledge a god's greatness at an appropriate moment (either wilfully or by mistake), or should he become reckless in his thoughts and assign too much credit for his station and prowess to himself, the gods will react to this afEront upon their honour by punishing the transgressor. Alternatively, proper observance of divine time- and having a 'mind that is god-revering' is generally associated with various benefits, commonly represented as gifts from the gods.l6 These range from personal attributes like strength of limbs and sharpness of mind to worldly goods such as wealth, status, and the sensual delights of Aphrodite. There is, however, no strict correlation between proper religious conduct and the acquisition of divine gifts (the universal problem of theodicy). This lack of fit is partly a consequence of the competitive struggle over limited goods, e.g. when two heroes 'dear to the gods' clash, one of them must nevertheless fall. More important, however, is the notion that there exists an immanent and impersonal order in the cosmos, vague powers or a force behind all things which is ultimately responsible for the general disposition of'what is' and 'shall be'. The</page><page sequence="8">276 Joseph M. Bryant epics usually express this view by the word moira, a multivalent concept meaning 'one's portion' or 'part' in prosaic circumstances (as in a helping or portion of food), but conveying the notion of 'destiny' or 'fate' in more generalizable existential situations (as when a warrior dies in battle). The relationship between the gods and moira is somewhat ambiguous, for in one famous scene Zeus contemplates saving one of his mortal offspring from a moira which had decreed his death, while elsewhere it is said that not even the gods can save a man they love once the dread moira of death lays claim to him.l7 Despite Zeus' supremacy, which occasionally creates the impression that he is the ultimate power, the moira motif is the predominant notion, poetically captured by such repeated scenes and images as Zeus holding in his hands the sacred 'golden scales' which measure destinies, and the 'weighty Spinners' who spin out the fates of mortals.l8 The origins of this belief in an immanent impersonal order are unfortunately shrouded in the mists of pre-history, but Weber's comparative research on the religious propensities of warrior-aristocrats sheds light on the social psycho- logical motivations for such a view. The life pattern of a warrior has very little afEnity with the notion of a beneficent providence, or with the systematic ethical demands of a transcendental god. Concepts like sin, salvation, and religious humility have not only seemed remote from all ruling stratan particularly the warrior nobles, btut have indeed appeared repre- hensible to its sense of honour. Such an orientation Weber explains as follows: It is an everyday psychological event for the warrior to face death and the irrationalities of human destiny. Indeed, the chances and adventures of mundane existence fill his life to such an extent that he does not require of his religion (and accepts only reluctantly) anything beyond protection against evil magic or ceremonial rites congruent with his sense of status.'9 This religiously-neutral fatalism also expresses itself in the Homeric conception of the afterlife: with the last gasp of breath, the ttyche or 'life-force' leaves the body and flutters down to gloomy Hades, the place 'where senseless dead men dwell, mere images (eidola) of perished mortals'.20 The prospects there are so grim that even life as the lowest menial on earth is deemed preferable. As Weber notes, privileged strata in general are not inherently prone to the idea of salvation, but rather assign to religion 'the primary function of legitimizing their own life pattern and situation in the world'.21 That the Olympians provide an ideological sanction for aristocratic supremacy and culture is self-evident. Not only do the gods legitimize aristocratic values and practices by sharing and engaging in them</page><page sequence="9">Intellectuals and religion in Ancient Greece 277 personally, but because many of the heroes are ultimately descended from divine liaisons with mortal partners, they are entitled to greater consideration from above and obedience from below. The heroes themselves are regularly characterized as diotrephes ('god-nourished'), dios ('godlike'), and more rarely, isotheos ('equal to a god'); and the kings are said to wield their authority at the behest of Zeus, 'who gives them honour and holds them dear'.22 The fact that the epics ignore or minimize many non-aristocratic aspects of early Greek religion has also been taken as a sign of ideological bias (discussed below). The extensive anthropomorphization of the gods indirectly afforded human beings a greater dignity and pride in their own humanity, but it also rendered the Olympians rather suspect as moral agents they were simply all-too-human in their emotions (jealousy, anger, desire) to offer guidance for ethical conduct. The values they upheld were those of the warrior-aristocracy, and these were largely self-regarding, concerned with personal honour and glory. Although such an orientation did not preclude recognition of social responsibilities the heroes occasionally express sentiments of noblesse oblige, loyalty to the community, and the kings are frequently referred to as 'shepherds of the people' considerations of honour clearly take precedence over public concerns. It is similar with the Olympians: though the poet contends that 'the blessed gods do not love savage deeds, but honour justice and the right actions of men',23 the actual conduct of the gods at times petty, deceitful, and capricious was not entirely consistent with such an exalted notion. As we shall see, various attempts were subsequently made to elevate the Olympians into ethical powers, but the continuing influence of Homer and the wider tradition of Greek Myth effectively precluded the emergence of a religiously-grounded morality. The composite polytheism of early Greek religion was thus given an aristocratic slant in the epics: the dominant gods were portrayed as a patriarchal family of divine nobles, while the cults of chthonian spirits, fertility rites, ecstatic practices, and other features common to primitive agrarian-based religions were disregarded. Gods particularly close to the peasantry, such as Demeter the grain-goddess and Dionysus the wine-god, were virtually ignored; while the craftsman's god, the divine smith Hephaistos, was depicted as misshapen and with a limping gait which furnished the occasion for 'unquenchable laughter' among the other gods. (b) Hesiod A significantly different representation of the divine realm was offered by Hesiod, a peasant-farmer of the late eighth century who became a poet after a mystical revelation from the divine Muses. His two monumental poems, the Theogony and Works and Days, were both composed in epic metre and vocabulary, but the awkward verse arrangement and the novel thematic content suggest that these poems</page><page sequence="10">278 Joseph M. Bryant were original creations rather than parts of an oral tradition, even though they record many beliefs and practices which actually predate the Homeric epics. Hesiod provides us with our first direct information on the social position of the common man in an age of aristocratic supremacy, and the overriding impression he creates is that life was extremely hard for the poor man, and not much better for small farmers like himself. The spectre of'burning-eyed' famine is raised several times, and Hesiod is tireless in singing of the necessity of toil, to pile 'work upon work'. The men of his era, he informs us, 'never rest from toil and suffering', and the gods give them 'grievous cares'.24 To survive this harsh reality, Hesiod counsels three necessary courses of action: ritual purity before the gods, just dealings with men, and unrelenting labour. As Weber observes, the religious mentality of peasant strata is fundamentally shaped by their existential dependence upon organic processes and natural events, a circumstance which accounts for their strong attachment to traditional weather magic and animistic ritualism.25 Hence it is no accident that the Greek religious calender largely corresponds to the peasant's annual cycle of ploughing, sowing, reaping, and threshing, for each of these activities requires the 'co-operation' of Nature, which was to be gained through sacrifice and ritual. Magical coercion of nature spirits and the supplication of those higher deities connected with agriculture thus constituted the primary religious concerns of the peasantry. In Works and Days, Hesiod provides a catalogue of this peasant ritualism, giving evidence for both the prevalence of superstition and the common peasant view that all of Nature is somehow spirit. Among other things we learn that one must not urinate facing the sun, nor befoul rivers and springs; it is bad to beget children after a funeral, but propitious following festivals for the gods; before crossing a river one should offer prayer to it and cleanse one's hands; it is bad to wash your body with water a woman has bathed in; and never cut your fingernails at a festival! Hesiod also offers advice concerning lucky and unlucky days: the eleventh day of the month is good for shearing sheep and picking fruits; you should geld boars and bulls on the eighth, but mules on the twelfth; bring home a bride on the fourth, but make sure the omens are favourable; the thirteenth is bad for sowing, and always be careful on the fifth! Agricultural advice and the practical side of peasant religion were not Hesiod's only concerns, however, for his poems also contain a strong moral critique of the nobility's guardianship of the community. Their hubristic behaviour and corrupt legal practices, he charges, will bring down a stern punishment from Zeus, one which will make the whole community suffer for the folly of the ruling aristoi. Hesiod legitimizes his demand for social justice by way of a contrast between the 'Just' and the 'Unjust Polis'.</page><page sequence="11">Intellectuals and religion in Ancient Greece 279 Those who give straight judgments to strangers and to the people of the land, and who do not transgress what is just, their Polis flourishes and the people in it prosper. Peace, the nurse of children, is abroad in their land, and far-seeing Zeus never decrees grievous war against them. Neither famine nor disaster ever consorts with men who give -straight judgments; with good cheer they manage their carefully tended fields, and the earth bears them an abundant livelihood. But for those who practice hubris and cruel deeds, far-seeing Zeus, the son of Kronos, ordains a punishment. Often even an entire Polis suffers because of a bad man who does wrong and contrives reckless deeds. Upon the people the son of Kronos sends a great woe, plague and famine together; the people perish, their women do not bear children, and their families diminish through the contriving of Olympian Zeus. And again, at another time the son of Kronos either destroys their wide army, or their walls, or their ships on the sea. In portraying Zeus as the transcendental authority for social justice, Hesiod modifies the epic tradition in an important respect. For despite the fact that the Homeric Zeus had protected certain groups from outrage (notably parents, strangers, and guests), and had opposed oath-breaking and crooked decrees, his role as a moral agent was rather ambiguous; in far too many respects he appeared more concerned with his own honour than with justice per se. Hesiod strives to overcome that inconsistency by portraying a Zeus whose principal concern is withJustice, both here in the world of men and throughout the cosmos. Much of the Theogony details how Zeus established himself as the supreme god, a process which saw him triumph over various hubristic gods and other monstrous forces. Following the victory Zeus is significantly chosen by his supporters to be the ruler, and his very first act is to bring order to the cosmos by assigning various oflices and functions to the other gods. In a remarkable poetic innovation combining genealogical and proto-philosophical modes of thought, Hesiod creates a divine paradigm for human society by having Zeus wed Themis (Custom or Right), a union that produces three 'ideal' daughters: Eunomia (Good Order), Dike- (Justice), and Eire-ne (Peace).27 In Works and Days it is the maiden Dike- the deification of Hesiod's central communal ideal who reports to her Olympian father on men's injustices, and she is helped in this supervision by 'thirty thousand guardian spirits who keep watch on those who 'devour bribes' and steal wealth by violence or deceit,- and who 'grind down' their neighbours through hubris.28 All such acts are violations against Zeus' cosmic order, for it was he who gave justice to mankind so that they would not 'devour each other' as do fishes, beasts, and winged birds.</page><page sequence="12">280 Joseph M. Bryant These moral innovations in theology were only partially successful, however, for like all the poets who came after him, Hesiod was somewhat limited by the traditional myths and legends which constituted the cultural heritage of the early Greeks. There are accordingly several tales in his own poems which present the gods in an unethical light, and even Zeus, Hesiod's supreme champion of justice, carries a pre-moral legacy in the primordial myth of his cruel punishment of Prometheus, the benign Titan-god who stole fire for men so that humanity might survive.30 In sum, the loose-fitting composite polytheism of early Greek religion received a- culturally decisive imprint from the two non- sacerdotal poets, Homer and Hesiod. Between them, the nobleman's bard and the peasant-poet basically established the pantheon of Greek deities by describing their characters, genealogies, functions, and areas of concern. Although the religious atmosphere of Hesiod's countryside diÂ£fered from that found in the halls of Homer's nobles, there was no direct opposition between the two perspectives. As we noted above, Greek religion was largely practical in orientation (do ut des), and therefore accommodative to the diverse rituals and beliefs of various social strata. III THE THEOLOGICAL RATIONALISM OF THE EARLY GREEK PHILOSOPHERS At the core of any 'genuine religious rationalism', Weber contends, is a demand that 'the world order in its totality is, could, and should somehow be a meaningful "cosmos"'.31 Historically, it has been the task of diverse intellectual strata (priests, prophets, bureaucratic literati, monks, and others) to create religious interpretations which address this problem of meaning, and the 'world images' they have forwarded have varied considerably according to sundry social and historical conditions. In the preceding sections we have noted that as a consequence of the particular institutional arrangement of Greek religion marked above all by the absence of a professional priesthood, independent hierocratic structures, and sacred canonic texts the cognitive or theological dimension of religious life remained general and indeterminate. Non-sacerdotal poets provided basic information about the gods (genealogies, functions, etc.), but the mythical heritage which conveyed this information was neither comprehensive nor internally consistent. This theological indeterminacy was not experienced as a social problem, however, since a strict adherence to utilitarian ritualism constituted the basic demand of religious life. As Weber observes, neither warrior-nobles nor peasants have an inherent religious need or incentive to construe a coherent theodicy or to pursue any type of ethical speculation about the cosmic order, except in cases where the former are threatened with</page><page sequence="13">Intellectuals and religion in Ancient Greece  281 depolitization, the latter with some form of enslavement (Hesiod's attempted transfiguration of the gods into ethical powers, for example, clearly reflects the plight of an agrarian demos oppressed by hubristic aristoi).32 The absence of a developed cognitive rationalism in ancient Greek religion thus seems to be rooted in the following social circumstances. First, for the two principal strata comprising the lay population, the warrior-nobles and peasants, the limited theological requirements of everyday religious life were basically satisfied by the cognitive information provided by the poets, which afforded some measure of conceptual focus as well as legitimacy for conventional cultic activities. At the same time, the perfunctory ritual responsibilities of the non-corporate religious personnel neither required nor stimulated rationalistic reflection about the divine order or the cosmos. And finally, the absence of sacred texts precluded the emergence of a priestly literary guild engaged in scriptural exegesis and lay education. Given these conditions, it naturally followed that the 'carriers' of intellectualism in Greek civilization would be secular rather than sacerdotal. Beginning in the sixth century B.C., a new social type emerged in Greek society, the philosophical intellectual, whose inner quest for comprehension engendered a remarkable flowering of rational modes of thought, manifested in such fields as cosmology, astronomy, mathematics, and biology.33 Particularly relevant to our concerns is the fact that much of the new wisdom represented a critical response to the traditional accounts of the gods and the cosmos. Since the new spirit of inquiry was above all marked by an effort to explain physical phenomena in naturalistic rather than supernatural terms, this necessarily entailed a displacement and rationalization of those magical-mythic elements which had dominated the traditional mentality. Earthquakes, rain, and lightning, for example, were no longer traced to the emotions of anthropomorphic gods, but to natural processes of cause and effect (however erroneously perceived). But though the gods and spirits of conventional belief were banished from the phenomenal world and replaced by the mechanism of natural causality, the new 'world images' of the philosophers were not devoid of religious content. On the contrary, one typically finds at the core of their speculation some form of'natural theology', which either rejects the personal gods of the traditional religion in favour of a deification of Nature, or which interprets the conventional gods as allegorically representing the more abstract truths discovered by philosophical reason.34 A brief overview of the relevant doctrines will confirm Weber's thesis that intellectuals have always been the exponents of a relatively theoretical rather than practical rationalism.35 Regarding Thales, the first philosopher, little reliable information has survived. He was born in Miletus around 625 B.C., apparently</page><page sequence="14">282 Joseth M. Bryant from noble ancestry (as were most of the other early sages), and died some seventy-five years later a celebrated figure in the Greek world. He is credited with various astrological observations and acts of mensuration, but is best remembered for his innovative cosmology. According to Aristotle, our primary source for early Greek thought, Thales believed that water was the material source from which the cosmos originally developed, and that water also served as the abiding, hidden constituent of all existing things, 'the substance persisting but changing in its conditions'.36 Why water was chosen as the primordial and basic substance is unfortunately not known. Aristotle speculates that Thales was probably influenced by the obvious connections of water with life; while most modern scholars have suggested that the three familiar 'conditions' of water as liquid, solid (ice), and vapour (mist) readily lends itself to a view that water is somehow the basic material constituent. As important as these considerations probably were, it is also likely that Thales was influenced by various mythical accounts of the world's formation, not only Greek, but also Egyptian and Mesopotamian, civilizations which were in direct economic and cultural contact with the Ionian Greeks.37 In Homer's lliad, for example, the great earth-encircling river-god Okeanos is at one point credited with begetting the other gods, and he is later identified as 'the genesis (origin, source) from which all things have been created'.38 Correspondingly, in most Egyptian and Mesopotamian creation-myths, primeval water-gods are presented as the original world-entities which beget the other powers. Thales thus de-personified these mythic cosmogonies in favour of the natural element which the language of myth clearly represented. Theological features were not purged from his worldview, however, as the celebrated statement 'all things are full of gods' confirms. Whether Thales intended this declaration to signify the divinity of water is uncertain; it might also be related to his belief that seemingly inanimate things are somehow alive or 'ensouled' (empsychon), a deduction said to have been based on the kinetic properties of magnetic stones. Unfortunately, both Thales and his philosophy remain obscure from lack of information, and all that can be safely said is that he dispensed with the traditional mythic gods and in some sense viewed the natural world as animate and divine. When we turn to Anaximander (c.611-546 B.C.), Thales' kinsman and younger contemporary, we discover the first comprehensive worldview based on rationalistic principles of deduction and expla- nation. He is credited with authoring the first book (or books) in prose, dealing with such subjects as cosmology, geography, and even zoogony and anthropogeny (he traced the origins of animal life to bark-encased urchins which were generated in slime, and human beings to fish-like creatures). His starting-point was apparently Thales' cosmology, for Anaximander clearly seeks to avoid the</page><page sequence="15">Intellectuals and religion in Ancient Creece  obvious difficulties of his predecessor's positions. Thus whereas 283 Thales had surmised that the earth floats on water, Anaximander argues that it is suspended freely in mid-air, 'held up by nothing because of its equal distance from all things',39 a brilliant conjecture undoubtedly sparked by a recognition that Thales would still need t.o explain what supported water, what supported the support, and so on. A similar correction characterizes Anaximander's conception of the primordial material substance. By selecting water, or any other specific material, one would obviously have difficulty in accounting for the existence of opposed qualities (hot-cold, wet-dry, water-fire, etc.). Anaximander accordingly begins with an abstraction which he terms the apeiron, a 'boundless' or 'indefinite' substance of unlimited extent which seives as the source of all things. Out of the perpetual whirling motion of the apeiron, basic qualities are 'separated out', thereby resulting in the formation of the cosmos and its ordered arrangement of earth, water, air, and fiery aether. The world undergoes continuous transformations as the opposed qualities and substances engage in mutual 'strife' with each other heat vapourizing water, water extinguishing fire, spring overcoming winter, and so on. The entire process of creation and destruction is said to be balanced 'according to necessity, for they render justice and retribution to each other for their injustice according to the assessment of time'.40 That is, each power or substance experiences a period of encroachment or unjust domination over another, only to suffer retribution once the other advances in counter-aggression (as, for example, in the change of seasons). Here then is the first clear articulation of the principle of natural law, vividly expressed in moral terms. The metaphysical basis for this pattern of cosmic justice is the apeiron itself, which Anaximander hieratically declares 'encompasses all things and steers [or governs] all'. It is also 'immortal' (athanaton) and 'indestructible' (ano-lethron), and therefore 'the divine' (to theion).4} The predicates which traditional religion reserved for the Olympian gods are thus transferred to an abstract principle of cosmic ontology, a lexical shift signifying that rational reflection on the concept of 'divinity' had discerned the anthropomorphic 'unworthiness' of the conventional deities. For Anaximander, divinity and justice are immanent in the natural order of things, a comprehensive 'world image' which strikingly illustrates Weber's thesis regarding the 'rationalistic need of intellectualism to conceive the world as a meaningful cosmos (sinnvollen Kosmos)'.42 The third great Milesian, Anaximenes (c.587-525 B.C.), essentially follows the course mapped out by his predecessors. Instead of water or the apeiron, he selects air as the original and basic form of matter, and explains all existing things and their transformations as occurring through either the 'thinning' or the 'thickening' of the primary substance. Metaphysical motives seem to have influenced his choice</page><page sequence="16">284 Joseph M. Btyant of air, for he identifies it as 'god' (theon), and declares that 'just as our pache, being air, holds us together and controls us, so do breath and air encompass the whole world'.43 This comparison of cosmic air with the breath or air of the human being is highly suggestive, for the ptyche was traditionally conceived as the 'life-force' of the body. By extension, therefore, air would function as the cosmic life-force, a role which probably accounts for its alleged 'divinity'. In any event, rational speculation has once again expurgated the conventional gods and transferred religious values to natural forces. We are unfortunately not informed as to the reasons why the Milesians dispensed with the traditional gods in their cosmological systems; but given the religious rationalism which they manifest in their stated positions, it seems probable that the inconsistencies of the myths and the anthropomorphic limitations of the Olympians were recognized and implicitly condemned by silence. Support for this inference is furnished by the views of Xenophanes (c.570-480 B.C.) a poet-sage born in Colophon, but compelled to emigrate to Greek Sicily in 546 B.C., the year the Persians conquered the Greeks of Asia Minor. Unlike the philosophers from Miletus, Xenophanes explicitly challenges the traditional accounts of the gods in the light of the new rationalism, and his vigorous criticisms include the first rudiments of the sociology of religion The Ethiopians say that their gods are snub-nosed and black, the Thracians that theirs have blue eyes and red hair. But if cattle and horses or lions had hands, or were able to draw with their hands . . ., horses would draw the forms of the gods like horses, and cattle like cattle, and they would make their bodies such as they each had themselves. But mortals consider that the gods are born, and that they have clothes and speech and bodies like their own.44 Not only does Xenophanes reject the anthropomorphic representation of the gods, but also the immorality which had been imposed on them by the greatest of poets Homer and Hesiod have attributed to the gods everything that is a shame and a reproach among men, stealing and committing adultery and deceiving each other.45 As to his own beliefs, he advocates a more abstract, philosophical theology which is basically shorn of anthropomorphic traits One god, greatest among gods and men, in no way similar to mortals either in body or in thought. Always he remains in the same place, moving not at all; nor is it fitting for him to go to different places at different times, but without toil he shakes all things by the thought of his mind. All of him sees, all thinks, and all hears.46</page><page sequence="17">Intellectuals and religion in Ancient Creece 285 The relationship between this 'one greatest god' and the occasionally mentioned plural 'gods' is not known; Aristotle complains that Xenophanes 'made nothing clear', but simply 'gazing at the whole heaven said that the one is god'.47 What is certain, however, is that his objections to traditional religious beliefs are based primarily on considerations of propriety and seemliness: human frailties are deemed irreconcilable with a rational conception of the divine. Aristotle records that he declared it 'impious' to believe that the gods were ever born, for this would imply a time when they did not exist.48 And in another hymn he advises that men should not sing of the battles between the gods, which he dismisses as 'the fabrications of our forebears', but rather 'sing praise to the god with pious tales and pure words'.49 This reverent tone distinguishes him from the Milesians, whose religious metaphysics do not provide an observable outlet or avenue for any personal emotionalism other than contempla- tive satisfaction with the meaningful, ordered totality of Nature. The rationalist assault on conventional religion was continued and extended by Heraclitus of Ephesus (c.540-480 B.C.), who expressed his views in an oracular style bordering on mysticism. It is accordingly rather diflicult to discern the meaning of many of his aphoristic statements (even the ancients referred to him as the 'riddler'), though the core doctrines regarding the ceaseless mutability of the cosmos emerge clearly enough. The process of change is said to be orderly, maintained by the Logos which ensures a coherent balance through the perpetual strife of opposites. 'Listening not to me but to the Logos, it is wise to agree that all things are one'. Â° This underlying unity is not to be understood as one of identity, but rather as an interdependent continuum in which the plurality of things is connected through the unity of opposites The way upward and downward is one and the same. Disease makes health pleasant and good, hunger satiety, weariness rest. Out of all things there comes a unity, and out of a unity all things. Sea is the most pure and most polluted water; for fish drinkable and salutary, but for men undrinkable and destructive.5l It is Heraclitus' central claim that 'all things happen according to this Logos', which thus seems to function as the governing force or unifying principle of the cosmos.52 The subject is somewhat complicated however by the fact that he frequently employs other terminology, rationalistic as well as religious-poetic, to express the same insight War is the father of all and the king of all, and some he shows as gods and others as men; some he makes slaves, others free. It is necessary to know that war is common and justice is strife, and that all things happen by strife and necessity.</page><page sequence="18">286 Joseph M. Bryant This cosmos no god or man has made, but it always was and is and shall be; everliving fire, measures kindling and measures . * . extlnguls. zlng. Thunderbolt steers all things. One thing, the Wise alone, is unwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus. To god all things are beautiful and good and just, but men have supposed some things to be unjust, others just. God is day night, winter summer, war peace, satiety hunger.53 Thus whether designated as the Logos (which conveys ordered rationality), War or Strife (metaphors for the clash of opposites), Fire (the physical manifestation of change), Zeus or Thunderbolt (the name ofthe highest deity and his traditional weapon), or simply God, Heraclitus' religious metaphysic presents a depersonalized divine power, immanent in the dynamic flow and interchange of all things. It is this understanding which compels him to assail conventional religious practices, including the basic act of ritual sacrifice and the cult-objects chiseled from marble and stone They vainly purify -themselves by defiling themselves with blood, as though one who had stepped into mud were to wash with mud; he would seem to be mad, if anyone noticed him doing this. And they pray to these statues, as if one were to converse with houses, for they know not what gods and divine heroes really are.54 The agrarian fertility cult is also viewed critically, though Heraclitus discovers that it celebrates at a deeper, hidden level the unity of opposites For if it were not to Dionysus that they made the procession and sang the hymn to the shameful parts [the phallic symbols], their deeds would be most shameful. But Hades [Death] and Dionysus [Life?], for whom they become frenzied and celebrate the Bacchic rites, are the same.55 And with his observation that 'corpses are more fit to be thrown away than dung', he rejects the ceremonies of burial and grave-tendence which figured so prominently in the ancestor and domestic cults of Greek religion.56 Slightly antedating and also overlapping the birth of rationalism on the Ionian coast was a general religious ferment throughout the Greek world, evidenced by the emergence and in some cases the creative revival of various beliefs and practices, including the orgiastic worship of Dionysus the wine-god, the mystery-cults at Eleusis and elsewhere, the spread of chthonic hero-worship, the ascetic salvation movement known as Orphism, and the appearance of sundry shamans and thaumatourgoi (wonder-workers) who offered purification, medicinal</page><page sequence="19">Intellectuals and religion in Ancient Creece  287 magic, divination, and prospects for a more favourable afterlife. The motivating impulse behind several of these developments was the quest for salvation, a need that was not satisfied by the traditional portrayal of Hades as the gloomy domicile for the dead.57 The so- called mystery-cults, which were associated with the chthonic deities who controlled the harvests and the realm of the dead, constituted the oldest and predominant form of salvation-oriented practice in Greek religion: through participation in certain secret rites (mysteria) entailing ritual purification and a preparatory ascetic regimen, the initiate was offered the prospect of a better fate in the afterlife (conceived in temporal terms); as there was no notion that initiation was to be followed by a methodically planned and permanent routine of continuing piety, most of these rites were little more than magical insurance policies.58 It was different in certain branches of Orphism, however, which did demand of its members a systematic devotional life based on the sacred poems attributed to the mythical singer Orpheus and his followers. Although the early history of Orphism is exceedingly obscure, it is clear that other-worldly salvation was its principal concern, and that various ascetic practices (including vegetarianism) and ritual purification constituted the chief means for securing a more favourable afterlife and for avoiding eternal consignment in the slime of Hades.59 Another important salvation movement of the period was founded by the shaman-philosopher Pythagoras (c.570-495 B.C.), whose doctrines are generally thought to represent an intellectualist reformation or refinement of Orphism.6Â° Both the man and the message are difficult to recover from the legends which were early on attached to his name, but our sources do confirm two essential facts: first, that he taught a doctrine of metempsychosis and immortality of the soul; and second, that he established an aristocratic religious sect which eventually rose to a position of political dominance in most of the Greek city-states in southern Italy (which they controlled from roughly 510 to 450 B.C., before they were overthrown and virtually annihilated by the masses). Pythagoras' role as a religious reformer and as a shaman credited with trips to the underworld, previous incarnations, acts of bilocation, and other miracles is difficult to reconcile with his reputation as a philosopher and mathematician, but since there can be no question that these diverse aspects formed a unity in his own life, it is essential that we avoid the common error of elevating either side at the expense of the other. The analytical key for unlocking this problem is provided by Weber, who notes that quests for salvation which arise among privileged strata are generally characterized by a disposition toward an 'illumination mysticism' that is linked with a 'distinctively intellectual qualification for salvation', typically featuring a devaluation of'the natural, sensual, and lZhysical' and the discernment of'a unity behind all empirical reality'.6 The applicability of this comparatively-</page><page sequence="20">288 Joseph M. Bryant based generalization to the phenomenon of Pythagoreanism will be confirmed by a brief examination of the founder's principal doctrines. Metempsychosis is at the core of the Pythagorean salvation belief, and there are plausible grounds for crediting Pythagoras with its introduction to Greece.62 The Orphics placed a similar emphasis on the immortality of the soul, but their position seems to have been originally based on a primitive anthropogonic myth unconnected with transmigration: as an infant, the god Dionysus had been murdered and devoured by the Titans, who were subsequently blasted by Zeus' thunderbolt; from their ashes arose human beings, who thus contain within themselves both an evil 'Titanic' nature as well as a portion of the divine Dionysus. Orphic salvation methodology accordingly consisted of purging the Titanic side and elevating the Dionysiac through asceticism and purificatory rituals. The Pythagoreans pre- served both of these practices, but also introduced mathematics, an intellectual pursuit unknown to Orphism. This original feature is usually traced to Pythagoras' two famous discoveries: that concordant notes in the musical scale correspond to fixed mathematical ratios between the first four integers; and that the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is always equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. These remarkable findings indicated that sound and shape were both controlled by number, and from this 'illumination' Pythagoras leapt to the conclusion that the entire cosmos was somehow composed of numbers and that mathematics could reveal a higher, super-sensible world, the rational 'unity beyond all empirical reality'. From this basis the Pythagoreans developed an elaborate cosmological system and a number-mysticism which assigned numerical values to all things, including relationships: thus marriage is 5, composed of a male 3 and a female 2; justice is 4; opportunity 7; and so on. The psyche or 'soul' is also a number, but more importantly it is immortal and subject to numerous reincarnations (forms of animal life included) until eventually purged of all earthly corruption, whereupon it returns to its divine origins. That the Pythagoreans believed in a hierarchy of ontological purity is suggested by the celebrated statement that 'among rational creatures there are gods, men, and beings like Pzthagoras', and by the progressive status levels within the sect itself. 3 As for Pythagoras, he was viewed by his disciples as the living epiphany or incarnation of Apollo, presumably the last stage before his psyche escaped the wheel of rebirth and returned to the ultimate divine essence. Such ascension in the ontological scale required several life-times of existential katharsis or 'purification', which was to be achieved by strict adherence to numerous magical-ritual commandments, various ascetic practices, and by mathematical study which draws the soul upward to a revelation of the perfect, divine reality beyond sensory-experience. Although much of the Pythagorean system remains obscure owing to</page><page sequence="21">Intellectuals and religion in Ancient Creece 289 the sworn secrecy of the membership, the basic tenets all bear the trademarks of what Weber identified as an 'illumination mysticism' and 'a distinctively intellectual qualification for salvation'. A similar fusion of religious-mystical and rationalistic modes of thought characterizes the philosophy of Empedocles of Acragas (c.496-435 B.C.). A highly eclectic thinker, Empedocles attempted to create a comprehensive worldview by integrating Orphic and Pythagorean salvation doctrines with the ontological positions laid down by his philosophical predecessors. The titles of his two epic poems, On Nature and the Purifications, reveal the synthesizing intent of his enterprise. In the former and probably first work, Empedocles provides a cosmology that is heavily infused with religious conceptions. He locates the material basis of the world not in a single primordial substance as had the Milesians, but in four 'roots' or elements: shining Zeus, who signifies fire; life-bringing Hera, representing air; Aidoneus is the name for earth; and tearful Nestis is water.64 All existing things are made from various mixtures of these four substances, and all changes in the material world are nothing but re- arrangements of the basic elements. To account for the process of change Empedocles introduces two motive forces which he poetically terms Philia or 'Love', and Neikos or 'Strife'. The former acts as the efficient cause of attraction and mixture, the latter of repulsion and separation. The ontological status of Love and Strife is somewhat ambiguous, for while both operate as abstract forces, Empedocles also apparently conceived of them as substances diffused throughout the cosmos. They are presented as rivals in a never-ending cycle and each has an allotted period of dominance: Love advances during one phase, mixing together and uniting all things until a perfect, divine Sphere comes into being; whereupon Strife begins to stir, ruptures the Sphere, and progressively separates and scatters all things; once again Love revives, and the cycle continues. The Sphere is the highest, 'most blessed' form of divinity, a mystical absolute One, 'exulting' in solitude when 'all things unite in one through Love'.65 Apparently accepting Xenophanes' strictures against anthropomorphism, he stresses that this God 'has no feet, no swift knees, nor genital parts'.66 During the phase of world-formation, however, lesser gods are said to come into being, and these are presumably the gods of traditional belief. The doctrine of metempsychosis presented in the Purifications parallels the cosmology in several important respects. He begins by presenting a primal paradise when 'all things were tame and gentle to man, both beasts and birds, and the flame of loving kindness burned; and trees grew with leaves and fruit ever on them'.67 This age is said to have existed when the love-goddess Kypris or Aphrodite ruled alone, without the war-god Ares or any of the other gods mythopoeic language which clearly identifies Aphrodite with the</page><page sequence="22">290 Joseph M. Bryant cosmic force of Love, and Ares with Strife. Empedocles emphasizes that during this blissful era, men worshipped the goddess in reverent fashion, with perfumes and holy images, and refrained from staining their altars with blood-sacrifices and from feasting upon the rendered limbs of animals. But eventually this 'greatest abomination' (conven- tional practice in the traditional religion! ) was committed, and bloodshed and dismemberment became the customs of men, ending the reign of Aphrodite-Love and ushering in that of Ares-Strife. From this presumably allegorical collective fall, Empedocles turns to the fate of individuals. Whenever any of the 'blessed daimons' (i.e. the semi-divine souls of men in the golden age) transgress by shedding blood or oath-breaking, they are banished from their original unity with the divine and compelled to undergo worldly incarnations, 'growing into the forms of all manner of mortal things, exchanging one grievous way of life for another'.68 Empedocles himself shared this fate, for having put his trust in 'maddening Strife', he became 'a fugitive from god and a wanderer', already incarnated heretofore as 'a boy and a girl, a bush and a bird and a mute fish'.69 The final stage in the wheel of rebirths is reached when the souls which have been progressively purified are embodied in 'seers, bards, doctors, and the leaders of men on earth; and thence they arise as gods mighty in honour, sharing with the other immortals their hearth and table, without part in human sorrows and weariness' . 70 The historical Empedocles had performed in each of these callings: a religious seer, a poet, a doctor credited with miraculously restoring the dead to life, and a prominent political figure in his native polis. Hence the celebrated exordium of the Purifications O Friends who dwell in the great city of golden Acragas, up by the citadel, men mindful of good deeds, havens of respect for strangers, unversed in wickedness, all hailX I go amc)ng you an immortal god, no longer mortal, honoured by all as is fitting, crowned with garlands and verdant wreaths. Whenever I enter the flourishing cities with these my followers, both men and women, I am revered. They follow me in countless numbers, inquiring the path to gain, some seeking prophesies, while others, long distressed by grievous pains, seek to hear the word that heals all manner of illness.7l This is the bold declaration of a shaman-seer now poised to return to the state of blessedness with the other immortals, and eventually to a unio mystica with the absolute divine. The Empedoclean worldview is thus throughout animated by a religious mysticism and a quest for salvation, strongly informed by the need to understand the cosmos as a meaningful totality. It is appropriate that we close this survey of the theological rationalism of the early Greek philosophers with a brief mention of the atomic theory developed by Democritus of Abdera (c.460-370 B.C.);</page><page sequence="23">Intellectuals and religion in Ancient Greece  291 for not only does atomism represent the intellectual culmination of pre-Socratic natural philosophy,72 but it also illustrates Weber's contention that religion is increasingly 'shifted into the realm of the irrational' whenever 'rational, empirical knowledge has consistently worked through to the disenchantment of the world and its transformation into a causal mechanism'.73 According to Democritus, the universe is ultimately composed of extremely small, imperceptible particles known as atomoi ('indivisibles') which are infinite in number and dispersed throughout a boundless void. These atoms are ungenerated, unalterable, homogeneous, and solid, differing only in size and shape (smooth, rough, hook-shaped, convex, and other innumerable variations). The atoms are said to be in constant motion, and their varied movements give rise to collisions which result either in repulsion or in the formation of compound bodies through the entanglement of congruently shaped atoms. From the coalescence of compounds, innumerable kosmoi or 'world-orders' emerge, eventually passing away through the ceaseless process of change, i.e. the re- arrangement of atoms within compound structures. The macroscopic properties of all existing things colour, size, temperature, taste, etc. are accordingly reducible to the microscopic aggregates of differently shaped atoms, temporarily combined in varying positions and arrangements. For example, sweet things are made of smooth atoms, bitter of sharp or hooked ones; white colours are produced by smooth surface atoms which reflect light fully, black colours by jagged atoms which prevent light from penetrating. Since everything is said to consist of atoms and the void, it necessarily follows that all sensation, including thought, must be explained as a form of contact or touch. Thus sight is caused by contact between the atoms of the eye and the images created by the thin films or effiuences of atoms that are constantly being emitted by physical objects; similar physicalist explanations account for smell, hearing, and taste. The mind and psyche are both composed of extremely fine, mobile atoms of spherical shape, and the processes of thought and corporeal motion are explained as movements of these atoms caused by the impingements of external atoms upon the senses. The atomistic approach to all physical, biological, and psychological entities and processes was thus rigorously materialistic: all things are due to the movements of matter and to the contacts between its parts. Since everything happens according to mechanical 'necessity', that is, the spontaneous interplay of countless atoms in a limitless void, the motive 'spiritual' forces which had 'steered all things' in the earlier cosmologies Zeus, the apeiron, Logos, divine Air, Love or Strife are expurgated with the result that the world's existence and processes are 'disenchanted', losing all magical and spiritual signifi- cance. For Democritus, the atoms and the void carry no value except for theoretical or explanatory purposes; there is no deification of</page><page sequence="24">Joseph M. Bryant 292 nature, and every teleological account is ruled out by the purposeless combination and separation of matter. Within such a worldview, there is little if any room for religious elements, and our sources suggest that Democritus' approach to theology was basically aetio- logical.74 He explained the origins of man's belief in the gods as a product of psychological fear and awe resulting from observing the paradoxa or 'wonders' of nature, such as thunder, lightning, eclipses, and the regularity of the seasons .75 The act of divination he demystified by noting that the condition and colour of the entrails of sacrificial animals reveal health or sickness, from which it is possible to predict the future sterility or fertility of the fields.76 Prayers to the gods he deemed useless or unnecessary: 'Men ask in their prayers for health from the gods, but they do not know that the power to attain this lies within themselves'.77 And he reserved his harshest judgment for conventional and salvation views about the afterlife Some men, not knowing about the dissolution of mortal nature, but well aware of the badness of their own ways of life, afflict the period of life with anxieties and fears, inventing false tales about the time which comes after death.78 Although scholarship is divided on the question of whether Democritus dismissed the gods altogether as figments of human imagination (our source materials are ambiguous), it is none the less clear that even if he believed in their existence, they too would have been epiphenomenal atomic compounds subject to eventual dissolution. The universe of natural causality posited by Democritus is effectively if not literally 'a world robbed of gods'. CONCLUSION The preceding discussion has documented that the rational discovery of nature was simultaneously a discovery of new conceptions of divinity. Gradually emancipating themselves from traditional mythical and religious thought-patterns, the earliest Greek philosophers tended to adapt and transfer conventional religious predicates to the realm of nature, which they presented as a unified and ordered totality purged of miracle and magic. Rational reflection on the concept of divinity readily exposed the inconsistencies and 'unseemliness' of the traditional accounts of the gods, while conventional cultic practices were censured as unholy and absurd. Whether the divine was considered immanent in the law-abiding patterns or material substances of nature, or as the mystical All-One beyond the world of sensory experience, the theologies forwarded by the philosophers were strongly coloured by what Weber described as 'the natural rationalistic need of intellectualism to conceive the world as a meaningful</page><page sequence="25">Intellectuals and religion in Ancient Greece 293 cosmos'.79 Having developed outside the institutional framew-ork of the traditional religion, however, this intellectualist form of religious rationalism exercised only a negligible influence on conventional belief and practice. Not only were the philosophers isolated individuals lacking both temporal and spiritual authority (Pythagoreanism being a short-lived exception), but more importantly, their views had little afEnity with the practical religious needs of peasants and warrior- nobles, the principal citizen strata of Polis society.80 And as the absence of a professional priesthood and sacred texts precluded the emergence of an 'internally' generated rationalization, ritualism and magic remained standard practices within Greek religion, while the mythic tradition and the loose pantheon established by Homer and Hesiod sufEced for the limited theological requirements of the . . cltlzenry. The theological rationalism of the early Greek philosophers was not without historical significance, however, for their pioneering efforts inaugurated a tradition of thought which features as its crowning achievements the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle, and includes the many important contributions of the Hellenistic schools.8l The influence of Greek philosophy on western civilization is not simply limited to the secular fields of ethics, science, art, and politics, but also penetrates deeply into the theological core of Christianity, which in its formative years borrowed heavily from pagan intellectualism.82 As that subject is beyond our present concern, let us simply recall the recondite declaration which opens the Gospel of Saint John In the beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was with God, and the Logos was God. This was a theological principle which Heraclitus would have recognized, at least in part. Joseph M.

A few divinely favoured heroes were exempted from consignment in Hades, however, receiving as a special dispensation entry into the paradisal 'Isles of the Blest' or the 'Elysium Plain'; see the discussion of these notions in G. Kirk, op. cit., n. 37, pp. 132-4, 264-6. 58.

Guthrie, A Histo?y of Creek Philosophy, vol. 1, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1962, ch. 4, provides a very readable account; and F.

From Max Weber, pp. 350- 1, cf. p. 281. 74. I follow here the interpretation of G. Vlastos, 'Ethics and Physics in Democritus', Phzlosophzcal Revzew, vol. 54, 1945, pp. 578-92, and vol. 55, 1946, pp. 53-64; and W. Jaeger, op. cit., n. 34, pp. 180-5; the arguments of D. Mc- Gibbon, 'The Religious Thought of Democritus', Hermes, vol. 93, 1965, pp. 385-97, are highly speculative, rely- ing on late sources and several fragments whose authenticity is questionable; more importantly, however, he fails to link what he misleadingly calls Democritus' 'integrated theology' with the atomistic worldview, thereby gravely undermining his entire attempt at reconstruction. 75.

The outbreak of several trials charging various philosophers with reli- gious impiety in fifth century Athens provides the clearest evidence that the impersonal 'gods' or 'divine powers' of contemplative intellectuals were com- pletely alien to the religious orientation of the rest of the citizen population; see the cogent discussion of this phenomenon as well as other manifestations of ireaction' in E.R. Dodds, op. cit., n. 56, ch. 6, 'Rationalism and Reaction in the Classical Age'. 81. I am presently completing a large- scale study in the sociology of knowledge which seeks to lay bare the social bases of Greek ethics from Homer to Epicurus and Zeno, tentatively titled On the Social Origins of Epicureanism and Stotcism: A Study of Moral Codes and Social Structure in Ancient Greece. 82.

Finley (ed. ), The Legacy of Greece, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1981, ch. 12.</page></plain_text>
