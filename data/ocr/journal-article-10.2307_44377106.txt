<plain_text><page sequence="1">D. H. Lawrence and Deep Ecology Paul Delany For Nature, as green as she looks, rests everywhere on dread foundations, were we further down - Carlyle, The French Revolution "DEEP ECOLOGY" IS A TERM COINED BY THE NORWEGIAN PHI- losopher Arne Naess in 1973. It now identifies an international move- ment with an extensive literature by such figures as Warwick Fox, Gary Snyder, Bill Devall, George Sessions, and Paul Shepard.1 The founding be- lief of deep ecology is "biocentric equality" : "[A]ll organisms and entities in the ecosphere, as parts of the interrelated whole, are equal in intrin- sic worth" (Devall and Sessions 66). Warwick Fox offers an alternative formulation: "[W]e can make no firm ontological divide in the field of ex- istence: ... there is no bifurcation in reality between the human and the non-human realms [T]o the extent that we perceive boundaries, we fall short of deep ecological consciousness" (qtd. in Devall and Sessions 66). Deep ecology thus starts with a rejection of the Judeo-Christian belief that God has given to humankind "dominion over all the earth" (Gen. 1.28); it rejects also the secular version of this claim, that human interests and values take precedence over all others. Its denial of anthropocentrism distinguishes deep ecology from "shallow" ecology (including the Animal Rights movement) and from "social" ecology. Shallow ecology keeps hu- mans at the center but asks them to tread more lightly and respectfully on the earth. Social ecology blames environmental degradation on bad political arrangements such as consumer capitalism with its inbuilt waste and greed, claiming that with better values, human society would not dam- age the natural world so relentlessly.2 Deep ecologists argue that neither of these movements can respond adequately to the environmental crisis be- cause they still view humans as stewards of nature rather than organisms inextricably bound up with it. That the universe is not human-centered has been a theme in West- ern philosophy at least since Spinoza; deep ecology is unusual only in the lessons it draws from this displacement. It proposes, for example, that human self-realization must include a deep sense of connection between 27</page><page sequence="2">Critic 55.2 individual consciousness and everything else in nature- a connection that conflicts with the atomistic individualism of modern consumer-capitalist so- cieties. Deep ecologists contrast their norm of "world-living" to the "world- making" of technical-rationalists- which is, intrinsically, a "world-breaking" as well (Wexler 53). Social organization should be based not on abstract human inventions such as the market or the nation-state but on a "natural" exchange both within and among species. This exchange should follow "bioregional" qualities and boundaries; that is, human associations should be specific to a particular environment and largely determined by it. Deep ecologists believe, finally, that a "re-inhabiting" of the planet according to these principles would require a substantial reduction both of human pop- ulations and of the standard of living in industrial societies. Deep ecologists recognize that their program is not likely to be imple- mented in the near future, and this recognition feeds a vein of apocalyptic gloom in their writings, as if the ecological equivalent of the Dark Ages were close at hand. David Foreman of Earth First! has argued that large wilderness areas need to be preserved "so that there is something to come back after human beings, through whatever means, destroy their civilisa- tion" (qtd. in Tokar 140). Some deep ecologists practice survivalism, living in remote areas and depending as little as possible on the amenities of civi- lization; all would agree that wilderness has special value as a place where nature can do its work unrestricted by androcentric values and projects. They oppose, therefore, any interference with the apparent (from a hu- man perspective) cruelty, waste, or disorder of natural processes. They do not believe, for example, in shooting wolves to save elk; pr√©dation serves its own ends, and any human squeamishness about it is implicitly paternal- istic. For the same reason, deep ecologists would not support vegetarianism or animal rights, because these causes set up an opposition between human morality and the rest of the biosphere. For deep ecologists, the issue is not how we can treat animals better but how we can become better animals ourselves. Current ecological movements have hailed Walt Whitman, D. H. Law- rence, and Robinson Jeffers as precursors. But such appropriations of liter- ary artists, making them into prophets of the contemporary, will always be problematic. First, the writer's calling is for "creation" rather than "state- ment," to use Lawrence's terms; second, a writer can scarcely be held responsible for what later generations make of his or her work. Years af- ter Lawrence's death, he was called a protofascist and a male supremacist; such indictments project Lawrence's views beyond his death into later po- litical and social conflicts.3 As ecological readings of Lawrence appear in the 1990s, they may exemplify a more benign anachronism- presenting Lawrence as an enlightened forerunner of our present concerns rather than as one tainted by "reactionary" attitudes toward politics and gender. Yet, within the current emergence of environmental consciousness deep ecology 28</page><page sequence="3">Paul Delany is likely to hold a marginal and even scandalous position precisely because of its resemblance to those themes of power and masculinity that have so troubled Lawrence's later readers. At the same time, Lawrence's closeness to deep-ecological beliefs also allows him to make a specially valuable cri- tique of them. He joins Whitman and Jeffers in anticipating the vision of deep ecology, but more than they he also wrestles with the vision's darker implications. Even when we look at Lawrence through green spectacles, he retains his power both to delight and to disturb. I Lawrence's early writings reflect the divided image of nature that pre- vailed in the literary culture of his youth. His first novel, The White Peacock , presents a group of sensitive young people whose ideal is the "love in a cottage" of George Meredith and other late-Victorian pastoralists. Nature offers the young people a refuge from modern civilization, promising not only beauty to soothe their souls but also decorous sensuality. But such idylls are disturbed by the gloomier view of natural processes that stems from Darwinism. Later on, in his "leadership phase," Lawrence could treat the Darwinian "struggle for existence" with equanimity: "In nature, one creature devours another, and this is an essential part of all existence and of all being. It is not something to lament over, nor something to try to reform" (Phoenix II 467). But the main characters of The White Peacock , especially the women and Cyril Beardsall, do lament over it as the coun- tryside around them resounds with the death agonies of birds and beasts. The only one who refuses to lament is the gamekeeper, Annable, per- haps the first literary character to profess deep ecology. Lawrence uses him to suggest that we might slough off the burdens of divided consciousness and irksome morality if we could just return to our biological roots. "When a man's more than nature he's a devil," argues the keeper; our highest and best aim is simply to be a "good animal" (132). In the dialectic of the novel, Annable is a "thorough materialist" (146), set against the "souliness" of his first wife and of Leslie Tempest and Lettie Beardsall (132, 150). Like a modern sociobiologist, he tells Leslie that his mustache and bright waist- coat serve the same purpose as the markings on a male finch: to entice the female into intercourse.4 He treats his wife as little more than a breeder, refuses to help her with domestic tasks, and boasts that his children are brought up "like a bunch o' young foxes, to run as they would" (131). He stands up for the wild against the tame, letting nature do as it will and careless that the resulting plague of rabbits is driving farmers off his mas- ter's land. While walking in the countryside, Cyril Beardsall and George Saxton come upon the logical fulfilment of Annable's creed of laissez-faire: an abandoned farm with nettles taller than a man, a headless doll, fero- cious rats, and "feathers, bits of animal wreckage, even the remnants of a cat" (60). In the middle of this scene of decay lies a gamekeeper's cap, sug- 29</page><page sequence="4">Critic 55.2 gesting that the ruined farm embodies Annable's creed "that all civilisation is the painted fungus of rottenness" and that decay- the maggots at work in a dead rabbit- is inseparable from renewal (146). Of course, Cyril is intrigued by Annable without being able to endorse his way of life, still less to emulate it. Annable remains an eccentric, and he is abruptly removed from the novel halfway through without having played a significant role in the action, perhaps because if he were to be taken seriously, the rest of the characters would suffer by contrast. Cyril, like Lawrence himself at the time, wants to reconcile soul and sense, conscious- ness and natural process, but is left with only the pains of self-division. This division extends to the masculine and feminine sides of his nature: Cyril admires Annable but gives some assent to his sister's outcry that "[m]en are all brutes" who need to be tamed by women (51). Most of the "natural" cruelty of The White Peacock is assigned to males and deplored by the female characters; Cyril- deploring it, too- is feminized by his sympathy. The keynote of The White Peacock , then, is self-division: Once Annable is removed from the scene, Lawrence reverts to brooding over the con- flicts between mind and nature, spirit and flesh, showing how they are expressed- but not resolved- in the fates of the different characters. His theory of "blood consciousness," first articulated in December 1915, is pri- marily an attempt to deal with self-division by making spirit no more than a subordinate element of flesh (Letters 2: 470). But the theory also implies a cosmology that is a crucial precursor of the deep-ecological perspective. Blood consciousness expresses Lawrence's desire to break down the tradi- tional boundaries, in Western culture, between the conscious self, the body, other people, and the whole natural world. If Christianity has denied and devalued the material world, then Lawrence will take as his god the goat- footed Pan, who brings all things together. Through Pan, Lawrence can achieve union with the great pine tree in front of his New Mexico cabin: I am conscious that [the tree] helps to change me, vitally. I am even conscious that shivers of energy cross my living plasm from the tree, and I become a degree more like unto the tree, more bristling and turpentiney, in Pan. And the tree gets a certain shade and alertness of my life, within itself. ("Pan in America," Phoenix 25)5 Lawrence thus achieves a vital communion with nature instead of being a gloomy and inhibited spectator of its drama. Further, this union is one of equals, not an appropriation of nature for humanity's spiritual aggrandize- ment: Wordsworth gathered [the primrose] into his own bosom and made it part of his own nature. "I, William, am also a yellow 30</page><page sequence="5">Paul Delany primrose blossoming on a bank." This, we must assert, is an impertinence on William's part - You see it is not so easy even for a poet to equilibrate him- self even with a mere primrose. He didn't leave it with a soul of its own. It had to have his soul. And nature had to be sweet and pure, Williamish. Sweet-Williamish at that! Anthropomor- phized! Anthropomorphism, that allows nothing to call its soul its own, save anthropos: and only a special brand, even of him! (Phoenix II 447, 449) II The central debate of The White Peacock was between the souliness of young idealists such as Lettie and the primitive vitalism of Annable. But there is also a third path in late-Victorian fiction. Lawrence read closely such novelists as George Gissing, who saw in social life the expression of the Darwinian laws of natural selection and the struggle for existence (Letters 2: 96). In this view, social institutions such as marriage or the market are simply extensions of the organic world. Thus, the socialist orator in The White Peacock sees modern London as an evolutionary war of all against all: For him the world was all East-end, and all the East-end was as a pool from which the waters are drained off, leaving the water- things to wrestle in the wet mud under the sun, till the whole of the city seems a heaving, shuddering struggle of black-mudded objects deprived of the elements of life. (281-82) The outbreak of the Great War suggested that the "struggle of black-mudded objects" had become a horribly literal description of the natural human will in action. Could the war be nature's revenge on the "painted fungus" of civilization, a revelation of what we are "further down," beneath the veneer of culture? As the war went on, Lawrence vacillated between two responses to this question. The first is a misanthropic despair: Modern society, especially in- dustrialism, has turned humans into sick animals by thwarting fundamental instincts that are given free expression in more primitive societies. That is why a highly civilized man such as Evelyn Daughtry (in the 1915 version of "England, My England") goes to war: "because of a basic satisfaction he had in participating in the great destructive motion" (England, My Eng- land 225). The war may even presage the actual extinction of humanity- a prospect that Lawrence, in his grimmer moods, seems to look on with rel- ish. During the war years, the idyllic pastoral scenes of his earlier fiction are reversed into a series of "deathscapes," to use Malcolm Lowry's term. Douglas Porteous has suggested that this term well describes 31</page><page sequence="6">Critic 55.2 many landscape components which, with a very few notable exceptions, have been systematically ignored by geographers. War zones, refugee regions, military installations, and weapons- testing areas (e. g. much of Southern California), tracts of clear- cut logging, Indian reserves and the like each represent, actu- ally, potentially or symbolically, the deaths of human beings, of ecosystems, of cultures. (43) Lawrence's deathscapes begin symbolically with the modern city, "a disease on the clean earth." Later, in Women in Love there is Gudrun and Loerke's vision of death by snow (453). Finally, there is Lawrence's obsession with the archetypal twentieth-century deathscape, the Flanders battlefields of 1917, where all that remains of nature is a featureless desert of mud (Delany 127, 341-42). But Lawrence's other response to whether the war was nature's revenge is actually to welcome the great instinct for struggle that the war released. "Man [sic] perhaps must fight," he wrote in 1924. "Mars, the great god of war, will be a god forever" (Phoenix II 359). People should not fight with explosives and poison gas, to be sure; but in such wartime works as "The Crown" and "Education of the People," Lawrence proclaims the need for the male of the species to engage in martial exercises and to satisfy "the profound motive of battle " (Phoenix 657). If nature is a great theater of struggle, how can or should humans be exempt from it? When Lawrence exalts the Lion over the Lamb, he approaches the deep-ecological claim (notably by Paul Shepard) that people live best as hunters or predators. Even amidst the horrors of the war, Lawrence kept a faith in nature as an escape from humanity's self-imposed burden of morality. Nature man- ages always to be orderly and fruitful without reference to human ideas of "should" or "ought"; so even if humanity does destroy itself, Birkin, in Women in Love , can look forward to the survival of a purer, more vital world (127-28). Human destructiveness is part of a natural cycle, Lawrence argues elsewhere, like the alternation of moods: If Attila had not smashed up Padua, we would not have had the later glory of Venice (Phoenix 89). Deep ecology laments the irreversible damage that humanity, even in de- parting from the scene, might leave behind. But Lawrence looks forward to the liberation of the natural world from human projects into a destiny of endless play: Whatever the mystery which has brought forth man and the universe, it is a non-human mystery, it has its own great ends, man is not the criterion If humanity ran into a cul de sac, and expended itself, the timeless creative mystery would bring forth some other being, finer, more wonderful, some new, more lovely race, to carry on the embodiment of creation. The game 32</page><page sequence="7">Paul Delany was never up. The mystery of creation was fathomless, infalli- ble, inexhaustible forever. (Women in Love 478-79) III In all these issues, Lawrence is exploring two principles that anticipate the deep-ecological premise of biocentric equality. One is that humanity is not the purpose or climax of the natural world and may even be "one of the mistakes of creation- like the ichthyosauri" (Women in Love 128). The second principle is that humanity is subject to natural laws more authori- tative than any anthropocentric understanding of human motives. Earlier in this century, Ludwig Klages advocated a shift from a "logocentric" to a "biocentric" philosophy (Bentley 236). To establish a biocentric norm, one must derive the "ought" of human morality from the "is" of natural process (Holmes). The "heroic vitalism" that Eric Bentley finds in Carlyle, Nietzsche, and Lawrence provides one solution: Whatever fosters the com- plexity, beauty, and force of the life process is good. Lawrence's vitalism makes him a biocentric thinker. But he is also a literary artist, a shrewd critic of certain deep-ecological tenets and, more broadly, of any "naturalist" stance toward human behavior. I will take Women in Love as an exemplary text here because it dramatizes an inter- locking set of biocentric issues: struggle, power, will, misanthropy, sexism, pr√©dation, and domestication. Even if we agree that the proper human ideal is to embrace struggle and to be "strong"- in whatever sense we might use the word- what does this ideal say about relations between the strong and the weak, between men and women, between people and animals? Perhaps the most important vitalist concept in Women in Love is "will." To construct a biocentric morality, we would have to be able to identify a person's natural will and know how it should interact with the wills of oth- ers. The central questions of the novel are, first, "How do we know when we are being natural (or spontaneous)?" and, second, "Are all wills equal, or should one be subordinated to another according to a natural hierar- chy? " Birkin, to find hope in his world, must be able to distinguish healthy wills from corrupted ones (he also wants to make the healthy wills prevail, but that is a strategic rather than a moral matter). Because the novel is highly dialogic, in the Bakhtinian sense, we observe that Birkin's stance on the will is circumscribed by a number of rival positions and terminologies. Hermione is strongly anthropocentric and self-controlled: "Domesticating" her natural will, she becomes a self-conscious spectator of her own animal functions. Gerald directs his will outward, seeking fulfilment through con- trol over the machine (and the mechanized humans who attend it). Loerke's will is parasitic on culture; he seeks to undermine the "higher" values, like "the wizard rat that swims ahead." Ursula is anarchic, favoring the free 33</page><page sequence="8">Critic 55.2 play of all wills; she resists Birkir≈•s ordering of wills, seeing it as mere bullying- especially when he tries to correlate will with gender. In presenting these diverse ways of living, Lawrence explores the issue of what is natural through the mediation of domestic animals, which act as a bridge between the wild and the human. Such animals are subjected to human will and even genetically modified by it (Meeker 151-52); they are therefore ideal indicators of how human will interacts with nature. Repeat- edly, Lawrence shows two or more human characters responding to such domestic animals as tame deer, horses, cattle, cats, dogs, and rabbits.6 In all but one of the episodes, a genderized struggle for power is played out along the animal/human axis. It begins with Hermione and her deer park: "[She] talked to the stag, as if he too were a boy she wanted to wheedle and fondle. He was male, so she must exert some kind of power over him" (88). Gerald's beating of his mare is counterposed to Gudrun's domi- nation of the Highland bullocks. Winifred Crich treats her male Pekingese with possessive love and captures his likeness Mas if working the spell of some enchantment" (236). Gudrun directs toward the male rabbit Bismarck a "sullen passion of cruelty" (240). And in Loerke's statuette, the young girl rides a stallion that is "rigid with pent up power" (429). In all these situations, the polarity of gender seems to be superimposed on a conflict between conscious will and brute organic resistance; that the will always holds control is an implied criticism of all the characters who impose it on animals in the way they do. A true relationship, conversely, will be based on respect for wildness rather than for domesticity: [A]ll wild creatures are shy- even the fiercest - This is not fear of physical hurt, but fear of being known. No free thing can bear to be encompassed by the psyche of another being, save, perhaps, in sheer fright or in sensual love - Thus it is hard to catch weasels, or any wild creatures, at play. No free creature willingly yields itself to the touch of another being. It cannot bear to be sensually encompassed. The true self is like a star which must preserve the circumambient darkness which gives to it its distinction and uniqueness. (Arnold 56) These encounters also help to differentiate the novel's two main couples. Gerald and Gudrun impose their will on domestic animals to provoke sexual excitement in themselves and in others; Ursula and Birkin are exempt from this excitement and sometimes strongly condemn it. The perverted quality of Gerald and Gudrun's sexuality is expressed in human or animal wounds: gashes in the flanks of Gerald's Arabian mare, castration of the Highland bullocks that Gudrun drives before her, scratches inflicted on both Gerald and Gudrun by Bismarck, the rabbit. For an unhealthy human consciousness, domestication is a kind of pornography in itself: Gerald and 34</page><page sequence="9">Paul Delany Gudrur≈•s pleasure in their struggles with the various beasts finds a parallel in Hermione's fascination with her alienated and controlled animal self. In each of two related episodes, a young woman is treated as a kind of domestic pet: the Pussum by Halliday and Gerald, the adolescent model by Loerke. Here again is a perverted exertion of the will that generates both violence (the Pussum's stabbing of Halliday, Loerke's beating of his model) and a sexual pathology. Gudrun's complicity in these episodes- whether by toleration or by morbid interest- contributes to the final catastrophe of Gerald's death and distinguishes her destructive will from Ursula's healthier one. Only in the Mino episode does Lawrence show a more positive hu- man/animal relation. Unlike the other episodes, the human beings here exert no power over the animals; they simply observe them and draw their different conclusions. Birkin claims that the wild female cat wants to be cuffed by his tomcat, Mino. In accepting Mino's dominance, the she-cat empowers herself: The French volont√© de pouvoir is an enactment of one's self-directed will whereas the German Wille ziir Macht inflicts one person's will on others (150). Ursula cannot deny that the female wants to submit, but she is still indignant; to her, Mino is just another male bully, regardless of whether his partner accepts it. As with Gerald's beating of his mare, Ursula's instincts reject any "natural" mandate for female subordination: Her own rebellion is proof enough, to her, that females are not fated to submit. The conclusion of the Mino scene reframes Birkin's doctrine of male dominance, then dissolves it into indeterminacy. When the landlady comes in to announce tea, Birkin and Ursula "looked at her, very much as the cats had looked at them, a little while before" (214). This shows the reader that although Birkin has not actually been cuffing Ursula, they have been engaged in a ritual combat that they both enjoy, a refined form- proper to their human, rather than animal, status- of foreplay. Their final embrace confirms the biologically undetermined quality of their exchanges when Birkin kisses Ursula, "murmuring in a subtle voice of love, and irony, and submission" (217). So it is the male who submits in the end, ironic and provisional as he may claim that submission to be. Because Birkin and Ursula's quarrel over gender roles and triangular marriage is still unsettled on the last page of the novel, we must conclude that nature has not provided a definitive answer to the question "How should men and women live together?" Modern mechanism and its accom- panying perversion of instinct destroyed Gudrun and Gerald's relationship, but repudiation of mechanism is not enough, by itself, to guarantee salva- tion for Ursula and Birkin. It is true that in his didactic works of the period Lawrence sometimes proposed an undiluted biocentrism, with none of the dialogic interplay to 35</page><page sequence="10">Critic 55.2 be found in the novels. The narrator of "Education of the People" says to "woman enthroned" : I'll let you be womanly; you let me be manly. You look after the immediate personal life, and I'll look after the further, ab- stracted, and mechanical life. You remain at the centre, I scout ahead And between men let there be a new, spontaneous relationship, a new fidelity. ... Let them realize that they must go beyond their women. (Phoenix 664) This biological determination of sexual relations will be complemented by a deterministic male aggression: "Let there be the profound motive of bat- tle Not M√∂ns or Ypres, of course. Ah, the horror of machine explosions! But living, naked battle, flesh-to-flesh contest" (657). And education (for all but a select few) should no longer address the mind, but the body: Above all things, the idea , like a strangling worm, must not creep into the motor centres. It must be excluded - That is the whole point of real physical life: its joy in spontaneous mindless animation, in motion sheer and superb, like a leaping fish or a hovering hawk or a deer which bounds away, creatures which have never known the pride and the blight of the idea. (644) The flaw in all these exhortations is that they are exhortations. If such actions were truly natural, people would not have to be told to do them, for they would not think of doing anything else. The leaping fish and the hovering hawk never required instruction. Deep ecologists persist, nonethe- less, in trying to set norms for natural behavior. Shepard, for example, has posited a "natural, psychogenetic development for humans" that occurs as a matter of course in hunter-gatherer societies but that in the modern world is typically arrested at the early adolescent stage (Devall and Ses- sions 183-85). Shepard has proposed an ecological revolution that would restrict agriculture and trade to the coastal regions of the United States; the interior would revert to wilderness, in which people could rediscover the virtues of a hunter-gatherer way of life. The deep-ecological argument is that pr√©dation and cruelty, as essential features of the natural order, should form part of human moral and aes- thetic development. Lawrence certainly admired the predator: "The tiger, the hawk, the weasel, are beautiful things to me; and as they strike the dove and the hare, that is the will of God, it is a consummation" (Phoenix II 407). But such admiration did not mean that people- who have the choice of imitating the hawk or the dove- should aspire to be predators them- selves. Like Robinson Jeffers (another lover of hawks), Lawrence refused 36</page><page sequence="11">Paul Delany to participate in war. And a multitude of his texts argue that rather than strike another creature, we should do our best to leave it alone.7 IV As Lawrence emerged from his leadership phase and accepted Europe as his final home, he became more willing to accept that culture, rather than nature, is our human element. We could define this reconciliation as a move from deep ecology to the concept of the "cultural landscape." This concept assumes that in Europe, and most other places, there is really no such thing as a natural environment, for everything one sees is the product of a long history of human practices- agricultural, predatory, domestic, and architectural.8 However, this classic cultural landscape is the product of traditional, small-scale, and locally adapted technologies, which in recent decades have been supplanted by intensive agriculture and silviculture. The cultural landscape is therefore a middle term between true wilderness and what we can call the "industrialization of nature" in the modern world. In "Flowery Tuscany," Lawrence gives one of his most eloquent appre- ciations of the cultural landscape: The intensive culture of vine and olive and wheat by the cease- less industry of naked human hands and winter-shod feet, and slow-stepping, soft-eyed oxen does not devastate a country, does not denude it, does not lay it bare, does not uncover its naked- ness, does not drive away either Pan or his children. (Phoenix 45) The sea cliffs of Cornwall and the American high deserts were the natural counterparts, in Lawrence's middle period, of the starkness of his inner landscape. But in the last years of his life, tenderness became his ideal for both nature and human relations. In upholding tenderness, Lawrence arrived at a more skeptical view of pr√©dation- especially as a marker of human masculinity- and of the Darwinian imperative of struggle. Though Lawrence never disavows the animal predator, he becomes ever more insistent that there is no model of human manhood to be found there. "One is forced to admire the stark, enduring figure of Deerslayer," he wrote in 1922. "And yet he lives by death, by killing the wild things of the air and earth. It's not good enough" (Studies 62). "Man Is a Hunter," four years later, mocks virile glory, whether it comes from getting a girl "into trouble" or from shooting as many little birds as will fill a handkerchief. The poem "Mountain Lion" surprises by its reversal of gender expectations. The two male hunters are gentle and shy, almost ashamed of their kill; glory is on the side of their female victim- once beautiful in "the yellow flash of a mountain lion's long shoot." Now, in death, she leaves "a gap in the world" that no human could fill. The natural 37</page><page sequence="12">Critic 55.2 predator is beyond gender, and it becomes a measure of man's littleness that he claims the predator identity to glorify the male and reduces woman to a destined prey (Complete Poems 401-402). Another poem from Birds , Beasts and Flowers , "Cypresses," renounces the struggle for existence as a means of producing the higher from the lower. Lawrence laments that this struggle favors not the best organisms but only the most brutal ones.9 The ironclad Romans extinguish the Etr- uscans, who had carried "so much of the delicate magic of life" : They say the fit survive, But I invoke the spirits of the lost. Those that have not survived, the darkly lost, To bring their meaning back into life again - There is only one evil, to deny life As Rome denied Etruria And mechanical America Montezuma still. (Complete Poems 298) The same degenerative forces were at work in the Spanish conquest of the New World. "The Conquistadores were damned by their insensitiveness to life," Lawrence comments. "It was the educational result of Spanish struggle for existence against the infidel Moors" (Phoenix 356). Finally, we arrive at Lawrence's implicit critique of Mussolini's fascism: "Brute force and overbearing may make a terrific effect. But in the end, that which lives lives by delicate sensitiveness" (Etruscan Places 29).10 Even if the survival of the fittest has its part in nature, in culture it serves the destructive cause of mechanism, acting under the cover of Darwinism- social or historic. There is a moral here, finally, for the deep ecologists. Proposing a new Malthusianism, some deep ecologists speak of the planet's restricted "carrying capacity," of the need to reduce human populations, and of the role of war, famine, and pestilence (including, inevitably, AIDS) in bringing about this reduction.11 Lawrence, of course, can go them one better in mis- anthropy, imagining- or having Birkin imagine- "a world empty of people, just uninterrupted grass, and a hare sitting up" (Women in Love 127). But unlike the deep ecologists, Lawrence remains a humanist in making the relations between humans and nature the product of thought rather than instinct: Since man [sic] became a domesticated, thinking animal, long, long ago, a little lower than the angels, he long, long ago let off being a wild instinctive animal. If he ever was such, which I don't believe. In my opinion, the most prognathous cave-man was an ideal beast. He ground on his crude, obstinate ideas. He was no more like the wild deer or the jaguar among 38</page><page sequence="13">Paul Delany the mountains than we are. He ground his ideas in the slow ponderous mill of his heavy cranium Let us accept our own destiny. Man can't live by instinct, because he's got a mind Man has a mind and ideas, so it is just puerile to sigh for innocence and naive spontaneity. Man is never spontaneous. (Phoenix II 623-24)12 Deep ecology looks backward through history, seeking the point where humanity took a wrong turn and rejected the guiding hand of instinct. Unhappily, perhaps, Lawrence recognizes that no such atavism is possible: We must face the crisis of our environment with all the knowledge we have so far acquired and all that, in the future, we can hope to invent.

Hermione and the stag (88), Gerald and the mare (110-13), Mino the cat (148-51), the Highland cattle (166-68), Looloo the Peke (235-36), Bismarck the rabbit (237-43), the model on horseback (429-34). 7Among Lawrence's essays, see "Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Novels," "Reflections on the Death of a Porcupine," "Man is a Hunter." 8See Birks et al., Rackham, Salter. yNote, however, that only "vulgar Darwinism" posits the struggle for existence as an unending war of all against all. Darwin's own formulation was, "I use the term Struggle for Existence in a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another, and including (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny" (62). In other words, survival can be promoted through cooperation with others, and an individual can sacrifice its own life-chances for the sake of its offspring. It is now a commonplace to argue that the Victorian "nature red in tooth and claw" was largely a projection of human competitiveness onto a natural world whose laws were not, in fact, so uniformly ferocious. 10Anna Bramwell has tried to link current ecological movements to the Nazi interest in organic agriculture and "the folk." Lawrence's sympathetic but cautious relations with the folk movements of the twenties can be traced in his correspondence with the Bedalian Rolf Gardiner and in Gardiner's memoir in Nehls 71-84. 11 For references, see Tokar n7. 12 See also the extended critique of willing to live naturally in the first version of "Hector St. John de Crevecoeur" in Arnold.
