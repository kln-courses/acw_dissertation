<plain_text><page sequence="1">CORRESPONDENCE To the Editor: In "Speenhamland Revisited,"1 Walter Elder performs a useful service when he questions the catastrophic consequences which have been so long attributed to the Speenhamland period of English poor law administration (1795-1834). Historical judgment has held it responsible for de- pressing wages and debauching and pau- perizing the English working class. The Commissioners' condemnation of the Old Poor Law provided the springboard for enactment of the repressive "reform" of 1834. As we know, the climate of opinion surrounding outdoor relief which was generated by the Commissioners' report2 was to leave its mark on both sides of the Atlantic. Your readers may be interested in some additional perspectives on Speenhamland which are provided in a recent study by Mark Blaug.3 He characterizes the Old Poor Law as "essentially a device for deal- ing with the problems of structural un- employment and substandard wages in the lagging rural sector of a rapidly growing but still underdeveloped economy." He went on to say: "It constituted, so to speak, 'a welfare state in miniature,' com- bining elements of wage-escalation, family allowances, unemployment compensation, and public works, all of which were ad- ministered and financed on a local level."4 1 Social Service Review, XXXVIII (September, 1964), 294-302. 2 Report from His Majesty's Commissioners for Inquiring into the Administration and Practical Operation of the Poor Laws (London, 1834). 8 "The Myth of the Old Poor Law and the Making of the New," Journal of Economic History, XXIII (June, 1963), 151-84, and "The Poor Law Report Re-examined," Journal of Economic His- tory, XXIV (June, 1964), 229^5. Blaug compares wage rates, per capita relief expenditures, and migration from rural to industrializing centers in Speen- hamland and non-Speenhamland counties, as well as in agricultural and industrial counties, in the years before and after the passage of the New Poor Law. In addition, he goes back to analyze the original, but not hitherto tabulated, questionnaires gathered by the Commissioners in the course of their inquiry. Not only do his findings challenge the traditional condem- nation of the Old Poor Law, but he con- cludes that the Speenhamland subsidies represented fairly enlightened public policy for that time. He argues: (1) that subsidies from the rates were a response to sub- standard wages and not the cause; (2) that the allowances paid after 18IS were not so much wage subsidies as family allow- ances, starting with the third or fourth child; (3) that the Speenhamland system of wage-subsidy proper, associated with the roundsman method of employing labor by private farmers, had already substantially fallen into disuse before 1832, and that this was known to the Commissioners; (4) that in the conditions of economic under- development in the rural sector, accom- panied by characteristic labor surpluses, it may have been better policy to use labor inefficiently than to keep it unemployed. "The Old Poor Law," concludes Blaug, "tried to maintain the real income of workers by tying wages to the cost of living; it provided unemployment com- pensation together with a scheme to pro- mote private employment; and it coupled both of these to a family endowment plan. It is not often realized that the kind of arguments which are used to condemn the 4 Blaug, "The Poor Law Report Re-examined," op. cit., p. 229. 102</page><page sequence="2">CORRESPONDENCE 103 Old Poor Law per se would equally con- demn most modern welfare legislation."5 This rehabilitation of Speenhamland is important for helping to set the historical record straight. Mr. Elder shows that a new look is useful also for what it may suggest for current social policy formation in connection with poverty and unemploy- ment. He sees parallels in the 1795-1834 period and ours, intimating that "the cause of the distress" of the working class in the first period is "unclear," and he ex- plains it by reference to the fact that "squire, parson, and common man were caught up in forces of history which they did not understand and could not control. . . . It is suggested that the same poorly understood forces are operating today that operated in the eighteenth century, and that they are causing the same types of dislocations. These forces have to do with how we use the increased productivity brought on by the advance in scientific knowledge."6 I would take issue with Mr. Elder's con- clusion on two counts. First, we are now not so much grappling with mysterious, unknown forces as with a search for politically and economically acceptable remedies. Similarly, in England in 1834, the rising manufacturing class whose in- terests were served by reform of the Poor Law "understood" that they needed low wages, cheap food and raw materials, and the removal of obstacles to recruiting a supply of labor from the countryside to the factory. The Old Poor Law stood in the way. And it was struck down by the first reform Parliament. Second, one wonders if Mr. Elder may not be advancing a counsel of despair in suggesting that adjustment to the social and economic dislocations which he de- scribes, and to which he properly attributes the distress of the common man in the first 5 Blaug, "The Myth of the Old Poor Law . . .," op. cit.} p. 152. 6 Elder, "Speenhamland Revisited," op. cit., pp. 298, 302. half of the nineteenth century, "will be found, if at all, through greater under- standing of human feelings about giving and receiving and greater understanding of what motivates men to work and create."7 Certainly, it would be better if national policy with regard to poverty, economic growth, structural unemployment and differential rates of productivity were made in awareness of human feelings, needs, and motivation. And if such awareness strengthens determination to adopt policies that address themselves to the dislocations, that would be net gain. But the values which he invokes are not enough, and in some cases may not even be relevant. One can only agree with Mr. Elder's reminder, however, that better understand- ing of the Speenhamland episode is needed because it was so influential in shaping opinion about poverty, unemployment, and methods of treating them. In this regard Blaug's evaluation of the evidential quality of the Poor Law Report of 1834 is note- worthy. "Anyone who has read the Report of 1834," says Blaug, "can testify to the overwhelming cumulative effect of the end- less recital of ills from the mouths of squires, magistrates, overseers, and clergy- men. But as evidence of a social malady it has little value, particularly on the ulti- mate question of the corrupting influence of lavish relief: in what age would it not be possible to collect complaints from the upper classes about the laziness of work- ers?" Of additional interest, therefore, in illuminating how a climate of public opinion may be formed in support of a particular social policy line is Blaug's judgment that the Commissioners "de- liberately selected the facts so as to im- peach the existing administration on predetermined lines."8 Vera Shlakman School of Social Work Adelphi University 7 Ibid., p. 302 (emphasis added). 8 Blaug, "The Myth of the Old Poor Law . . . ," op. cit., p. 177.</page><page sequence="3">104 CORRESPONDENCE To the Editor: When I belatedly read Ellouise Minter's article, "The Fair Hearing: A Core Strength,"9 I was appalled that the author did not raise the question of the constitu- tional rights of social assistance applicants, in her long sixteen-page essay about griev- ance procedures. It is a most disappointing experience to read the many well-argued defenses of ob- solete types of bureaucratic administration. One cannot help but think that the impor- tance of "fair hearing" could have become less relevant by now if social workers had applied more concerted and skilled efforts to promoting well-integrated and adequate systems of social service, rather than to rationalizing away the fine points of public service hypocrisy. It is important that everyone, especially those intrusted with the administration and application of public services, have a keen sensitivity for the rights of people. The caretaking professions should consider it a professional obligation to promote the Bill of Rights, in order that its principles can find application to all levels of govern- mental management. It is unforgivable that even today responsible officials will be satisfied with interdepartmental boards of review. It must be the right of all citi- zens, including those in need, to present their grievances before independent boards or courts in which the members have no vested interest in the issues under debate. It is this right, I believe, which is the "core of strength" in a free society. A. M. Orno Mental Health Services Provincial Government of British Columbia Vancouver To the Editor: Mr. Orno's comments on "The Fair Hearing: A Core Strength" merit thought 9 Social Service Review, XXXVIII (March, 1964), 1-16. by all social workers who profess concern that society's provision for the needs of "the many" shall in fact reach the needs of "the one." "Sensitivity to the rights of people" is a pervasive professional attitude which can touch reality most dramatically in the individual transactions implicit in the administration of massive programs of public service. Like Mr. Orno, many social workers may now regret that in the past thirty years their profession's involvement in the evolution of those services has been less consistent and less systematic than might have been expected of a profession with such massive concern for people. Yet who better than the social worker understands the futility?yea, folly!?of counting on guilt as a basis for solving the problem at hand? "The Fair Hearing: A Core Strength" was merely one social worker's attempt to think with some detailed perception about the real potential of the situation today: How are the individual's constitutional rights to "equal protection" and to "due process" integrated into procedures which permit his legal right to assistance to be "reduced to judgment" and which puts him, as the lawyers say, in "possession of the benefits of that judgment"? The generic procedure described in the article is a practical structure which permits the indi- vidual, in the words of A. Delafield Smith, "the opportunity of entering the sacred administrative precincts and participating in a formal and challenging inquiry into the whys and wherefores of the action taken in his case."10 In 1965 some states may indeed have need for "defenses of obsolete types of bureaucratic adminis- tration." The article was not intended to provide this. It was addressed not to the issue, raised by Mr. Orno, of what might have been the best instrumentality for assuring the indi- vidual's rights to equal protection and to due process, but rather to the present po- 10 See A. Delafield Smith, "Elements of the Ju- dicial in Social Security Programs," Social Service Review, XVII (September, 1943), 424-41.</page><page sequence="4">CORRESPONDENCE 105 tential of the existing structure. It is worth noting now, however, that at the time the Social Security Act was framed, according to Smith, the courts were truly not equipped either with legal background or with processes that were "adapted to social security conceptions and requirements." Mr. Orno does not state how, in the past quarter-century, this situation may have changed. The issue for the individual who is the target for massive programs of public services is not what might be better than bureaucratic organization for administering those services, but rather, given the inter- governmental bureaucracy, how his oppor- tunity to experience self-determination can be assured, even at the moment he might feel most powerless in the presence of that bureaucracy. No law, no policy, no manual will automatically achieve the intent of any program. The disciplined human inter- vention of the social worker with his "sen- sitivity to the rights of people" can utilize existing organizational structure to achieve program goals, if there is indeed the will to achieve those goals. The existing bureauc- racy is not a monolithic "vested interest" in the anthropomorphic sense suggested by Mr. Orno in referring to "public service hypocrisy," but rather a configuration of heterogeneous human beings, occupying, it is true, a hierarchy of positions. There is public accountability for use of those posi- tions to achieve program goals through responsible decisions. Supporting the strength of this accountability, the social worker within the hierarchy can have catalytic influence by using his professional skill to focus on arriving at responsible decisions through a problem-solving process of working through each conflict wherever it occurs. It is the non-adversary nature of the fair hearing which makes it a core strength for public social services designed to protect the constitutional rights of man as well as to administer that to which he has a legal right.
