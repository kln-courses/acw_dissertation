<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Next Christian Epoch. By ARTHUR A. VOGEL. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1966. 111 pages. $3.50. Vogel announces in his Preface that he is adding another voice to the contemporary the- ological dialogue. He aims to answer the "new theology" and the "death of God" enclave by a sharp reassessment of traditional theology in the light of promising developments in the social sciences as well as by a fresh interpre- tation of anthropomorphism which provides his clue to divine transcendence. Instead of a dirge or a paean of joy over a post-Christian, secular age, he sets forth the possibility of another great Christian epoch (p. 5). Accord- ingly, the predominant tone of the book is positive, although it is constantly in critical conversation with those modes of thought that would reduce men to scientific objects shorn of intimate relations with deity. The central contention of the book is that there is a God of the Christian tradition who is accessible to man. The starting point for</page><page sequence="2">186 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION this view is what Vogel calls "our most imme- diate experience of ourselves in our lived- world" (p. 106). He wishes to argue that, since man has the capacity for self-transcendence as an anthropomorphic being, a transcendent realm of being must be acknowledged. "Experi- encing our transcendence within the world, we have all the material necessary--and all the motivation possible--for acknowledging the Transcendent" (p. 77). A psychological state is here offered as a clue to an ontological real- ity. But how is this transformation effected? Having started with the contention of "the primacy of man" and the notion of an age "of enthusiastic, recognized anthropomorphism" (p. 3), we are asked to believe that this pri- macy provides a clear indication of divine reality. However, the transitional step is miss- ing, so long as man is confined within the orbit of his own finitude. A hiatus remains between the world and man, on one hand, and God, on the other, which is never filled in the argu- ment. Several halting efforts in the direction of filling this hiatus are offered. In one case this is attempted by arguing that "the whole move- ment of our being seeks its completion in con- summate Being where freedom and order, person and content, coincide" (p. 77). But the yearning for this completion does not serve the purpose of establishing the reality of that which is yearned for any more than it denies it. Sheer spiritual insatiability will not provide the grounds for establishing the reality of de- ity, nor does it even establish the presence of a longing for the infinite. The problem of determining God's nature from an anthropomorphic standpoint is ap- proached in another way when it is asserted that "everything about him is mysterious" (p. 87). This certainly sounds like a dead end for further descriptions of the divine nature, but we are offered the doctrine of the Trinity as a way of understanding this mysterious being. "Impersonal words," it is said, "do not tell us enough about God's power to be our best guides to his interior nature" (p. 88). But how do we know what the best guides are unless we already know something quite definite about his interior nature? In fact, in spite of the mystery of God, Vogel is willing to tell us a great deal about God's purposes, as when he states that "God's will is to valorize the uni- verse through us" (p. 100) and that God is "Personal Concern" (p. 89). It appears that we know much more about the divine nature than simply that everything about him is mys- tery. Among the most successful features of the book is the author's willingness to confront Professor van Buren as a representative of the death-of-God theology, and not only argue his own case but expose the palpable, historical, scriptural, and philosophical weaknesses of his opponent's position. Furthermore, he makes a persuasive, if not a logically compelling, case for a traditional form of Christian theism which has been forged in the controversies of contemporary thought. Although the dominant caste of the book is optimistic about the future of Christianity, it is no soft optimism that is offered. The issues with which Vogel wrestles cut too deeply into the texture of human existence to allow any cheap victory. CLYDE A. HOLBROOK Oberlin College ANNOUNCEMENT The Editors of the Journal of Religion take pleasure in announcing to their readers the appearance of a new British quarterly, Theoria to Theory, whose aims would seem to have much in common with those of this Journal. The announced intention of this new quarterly (whose first number appeared last October) is to find significant new ways of moving from Theoria-or, "con- templative insight as opposed to disputatiously dogmatic theology"--to Theory (that is, systematic philosophy): which is to say that the journal will be de- voted to explorations of the various areas of interrelationship among religion, philosophy, and science. The sponsoring body is the English group known as the Epiphany Philosophers, who are scholars working in philosophic and scien- tific disciplines who have "found their natural allies from the religious side among monastics"; and the guiding hand behind this new enterprise is that of Dorothy Emmet. The subscription rate for U.S. readers is $5.00 per annum, and subscriptions may be sent to the Subscriptions Secretary, Epiphany Phi- losophers, 9 Marion Close, Cambridge.</page></plain_text>
