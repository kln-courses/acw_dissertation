<plain_text><page sequence="1">Incarnational Apophatic : Rethinking Divine Accommodation in John Milton's Paradise Lost by Paul Cefalu This essay argues that John Milton's Paradise Lost reveals both the limits and dangers of several modes of accommodating God to both angelic and human understanding. Not only does God fail successfully to accommodate himself and his internally efficient de- crees during the celestial council, but the Son, who might otherwise serve as an agent of the special accommodation of redemption, also fails to accommodate the Father: the Son's tendency to disclose several of God's mysteries subverts the basic concealing- revealing function of accommodation, which otherwise aims to render some of God's ways palatable to creaturely understanding even while ensuring the ontological and epistemological distance between creatures and God. Milton thus approaches accom- modation skeptically, even testing its effectiveness and capaciousness as an exegetical device that might be of use in mimetic poetry. THE and favorite question hence topic accommodated of among whether Miltonists, John to Milton's the level the God of most creaturely is anthropomorphized recent intellect accounts is of a and hence accommodated to the level of creaturely intellect is a favorite topic among Miltonists, the most recent accounts of which suggest that, despite his embrace of traditional accommodative principles in De Doctrina Christiana, Milton's use of the device in Para- dise Lost veers from conventional early modern usage.1 While C. A. Pa- trides and others established some time ago that Milton follows John Calvin, himself an heir to Augustine, in relying on a form of "baby- talk" in which a speaking God and the attendant images of God need 1 Still the most extensive overview of Milton's theory of accommodation in historical context can be found in Leland Ryken, The Apocalyptic Vision in Paradise Lost (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1970), 7-24.

Graves has more recently suggested that Milton relied on the figure of syn- ecdoche in order to represent God in De Doctrina Christiana : accord- ing to Graves, Milton states that "God has actually revealed himself, although incompletely, and not that he has revealed merely a symbol for himself."2 Hence Milton's God is not a condescended symbol or metaphorical image but rather a literal object that conforms to scrip- ture, even though what God essentially is involves much more than the partial image conveyed in Milton's text. This reading accords roughly with Michael Lieb 's "theomorphic" notion of God and Michael Bryson's contention that Milton's God needs to be understood according to prin- ciples of negative theology, inasmuch as Milton typically provides a re- vealing image or account of God only quickly to negate that very image or account.3 In the following pages I suggest that, despite the warm embrace of divine accommodation in De Doctrina Christiana, Milton's Paradise Lost reveals both the limits and dangers of accommodating God to both angelic and human understanding. Not only does God fail at accom- modating his internally efficient decrees to his auditors at the celes- tial council, but Raphael's measuring of the heavenly by the earthly for Adam's benefit serves like the prohibition itself to incite rather than ap- pease Adam's curiosity. As the apotheosis of what Reformed dogmatics would describe as the special accommodation of redemption, the Son would seem to vindicate or legitimate the use of accommodative the- ology; yet we will see that, because the pre-incarnated Son tends to re- veal God's otherwise inaccessible mysteries, his example (which runs up against not only the Lutheran-Calvinist but also the Arminian views of God's hiddenness) undermines the basic "concealing-revealing" func- tion of accommodation, namely, the scriptural tendency to make God's 2 Patrides, " Paradise Lost and the Theory of Accommodation," Texas Studies in Literature and Language 5 (1963): 58-63. Elsewhere, Patrides tends reductively to align accommoda- tion with affirmative rather than negative theology: "The 'affirmative' approach proved even more popular, especially when in time it appeared as the theory of 'accommoda- tion.'"

To rely too heavily on anthropomorphic figuration is to encourage a false likeness between the phenomenal and hidden or noumenal deity; effective accommo- dation occurs, at least according to the pseudo-Dionysian, if not the Calvinist-Lutheran acceptation, when God is represented in "dissimilar images," that is, when he is depicted in base, material types that in their very disanalogous and non-anthropic relation to God help the initiate to progress from shadowy types to truth. We will see that, although Milton does embrace some of the tenets of this alternative tradition of accommodation, he yokes the negative way to the poem's manifest Christology and messianism. The result is a distinctive, although not historically unique, incarnational apophatic that posits as the endpoint of the negative way not an "unknown" God but rather the emptied Word of God embodied in the Son.5 GOD'S INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EFFICIENCY In De Doctrina Christiana, Milton distinguishes God's internal from ex- ternal efficiency. The former is "that which is bounded within God" and includes general decrees relating to foreknowledge relative to creaturely free will and specific decrees relating to the nature of predestination (in- cluding Milton's Arminian position on universal atonement).6 God's ex- ternal efficiency refers to God's "working out of decrees, whereby he ac- complishes outside him something decreed within him" and includes the hypostatic relationship between God and the Son (which denies the coeternal nature of the two), the nature of God's creation ex deo, and God's brief on providence as it relates to creaturely sin (129 ).7 4 As Edward Dowey, Jr., remarks of special revelation, "The emphasis as in the general revelation, remains on the communication of knowledge, and always under the double aspect of revealing-concealing, revealed character and concealed essence" (The Knowledge of God in Calvin's Theology [Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdman's Publishing, 1994], 12). 5 I borrow the phrase "incarnational apophatic" from Paul Rorem, "Negative Theolo- gies and the Cross," Lutheran Quarterly 23 (2009): 319. 6 The Complete Works of John Milton, Volume VIII: De Doctrina Christiana, part 1, ed. and trans.

Just as divine praxis , manifested, for example, as the procession of a Triune God, served to distinguish and preserve the mysterious substance of the divine being from its economy, so divine economy served to preserve the mystery of God's being.10 The entire thrust of divine accommodation, extending from the patristics through Calvin and up to Milton, relies on an "as if" logic: God is ren- efficiency, see Maurice Kelley, This Great Argument: A Study of Milton's " De Doctrina Chris- tiana" as a Gloss upon " Paradise Lost " (Gloucester: Peter Smith, 1962), 77-82. 8 Most systematic theologians employed some such division of theology based on the scholastic distinction between being or esse and operation or operari. Such a distinction is reformulated, for example, in William Ames's Marrow of Theology , as "faith" and "obser- vance" (William Ames, The Marrow of Theology , ed. John D. Eusden [Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 1968], 79). 9 For an account of the early history of divine accommodation, see Stephen D. Benin, The Footprints of God : Divine Accommodation in Jewish and Christian Thought (New York: State University of New York Press, 1993). For a detailed monograph on John Calvin's use of accommodation, see Arnold Huijgen, Divine Accommodation in John Calvin's Theology: Analysis and Assessment (GÃ¶ttingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, 2011). 10 On oikonomia and negative theology, see Giorgio Agamben's The Kingdom and the Glory: For a Theological Genealogy of Economy and Government, where Agamben writes, "The economy through which God governs the world is, as a matter of fact, entirely dif- ferent from his being, and cannot be inferred from it. It is possible to analyze the notion of God on the ontological level, listing his attributes or negating, one by one- as in apo- phatic theology- all his predicates But this will not rigorously say anything about his relation to the world or the way in which he has decided to govern the course of human history" (trans. Lorenzo Chiesa [Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2011], 54). It should be noted that, for Calvin, at least, God's accommodating "economy" even in prac- tice might serve to secure God's inscrutability. In his Pentateuch commentaries, Calvin will note that "God appears to concede many things that he does not approve. He allowed the people to eat flesh in the wilderness; he permitted husbands to give a bill of divorce to their wives. . . . Nevertheless such permission did not make it right for them to eat flesh, or free them of blame for divorce," about which David F. Wright asks, "But how was Israel to distinguish between God-given direction and God-given license?"

As Dowey remarks, "The presence of God in these theophanies is no exhibition of his essence, it is rather a further illustration that his essence is not only unknowable but also deadly to man- and his 'voice' as well- except when graciously veiled under ap- pearances accommodated to human abilities."11 In Miltonie terms (and consistent with the theological usage of oiko- nomia) God's internal efficiency describes God's intentions and plans, some of which remain inaccessible to humankind, while his external efficiency describes the temporal unfolding of his designs, which in- cludes the creation and ongoing government of his world. It follows that, while humanlike actions will typically be ascribed to Milton's God (he creates and legislates in anthropomorphic, often passible ways), his preceding intentions will not typically be anthropomorphized, particu- larly because those intentions should remain hidden from view. An- other way of putting the distinction between God's internal and exter- nal efficiency is to say that the former describes why God does what he does, while the latter describes how God does what he intends. The tra- ditional, especially voluntaristic explanation as to why such hidden in- tentions remain opaque is that, despite the special revelation of Christ, God's unrevealed or veiled aspects maintain him as a hidden God (deus absconditus) even for those saints who are well advanced in the order of salvation. Consider God's dialectical prÃ©cis on predestination and free will: "They themselves decreed / Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew, / Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, / Which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown. / So without least impulse or shadow of Fate, / Or aught by me immutably foreseen, / They trespass, Authors to themselves in all / Both what they judge and what they choose."12 The rejection of foreknowledge is a preamble to God's capsule sum- mary of single predestination and resistible grace: "Some I have chosen of peculiar grace / Elect above the rest; so is my will: / The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warn'd / Thir sinful state, and to appease be- times / Th' incensed Deity, while offer'd grace" (3.183-87). With respect to the peculiarly paradoxical nature of divine foreknowledge in relation 11 Dowey, The Knowledge of God in Calvin's Theology, 12. 12 Milton, Paradise Lost, in John Milton: Complete Poems and Major Prose, ed.

God knows all in eter- nity, but the events he knows occur in time and appear from the human standpoint to be known beforehand."13 Milton himself relies on this precise mode of accommodation in his discussion of foreknowledge in De Doctrina Christiana, where he takes pains to describe the causal re- lationship between divine epistemology and decrees: "If we must speak about God in accordance with our own habits and understanding, it seems more consonant with reason that he foreknew before he decreed" (63). The burden of Milton's claim in De Doctrina Christiana that God has not decreed all things absolutely rests on an admitted extrapola- tion from the laws of human reason: "If, however, it is lawful to subject divine decrees to human reason, then . . . this type of non-absolute de- creeing can be briefly defended even on human grounds" (57). To have Milton's God in Paradise Lost assert his foreknowledge and qualified predestinarianism is one thing; to have him attempt to explain and parse their logic is quite another; such explanations will neces- sarily be truncated and will still raise questions as to their (and God's) inner workings to any angelic or creaturely intellect.14 As most Milton- ists agree, what is being dogmatized here in such condensed form is the well-known Arminian position that elevates free grace, creaturely free will, and the predestination of the elect over the hard determin- ism of supralapsarianism, the latter a Calvinist presupposition of the Westminster Confession. Once Milton's God articulates such distinc- tive and polemical doctrine, he is beyond the range of accommodation entirely, despite what Miltonists typically have suggested about this speech.15 God takes on the dual role of creator and expositor, and be- cause his explanation inevitably raises more questions than it answers, he comes off looking like an incompetent exegete, not simply a peremp- tory deity.16 Accommodation assumes that those scriptural character- 13 Norman L.

But such images and articulations as such , rather than their exegeted versions, are accommo- dations. To dogmatize and politicize an image or articulation (through the vehicle of God himself) is to assert a true meaning of that image or articulation and hence subvert the fundamental disclosing-revealing logic of accommodation (which is designed to open up rather than con- tract God's ineffability). Once we see Milton's God as Arminian, Calvin- ist, or Lutheran in orientation, we have achieved a divinization of crea- turely doctrine rather than an accommodation of divine transcendence. Scholars have long assumed that Milton's dilemma in so characteriz- ing God stemmed from the difficulty of putting such an arcane speech in the mouth of a believable, dramatic character. "The most obvious problem," Dennis Danielson remarks, "is that of anthropomorphism, of God sounding like a human being vociferously defending his own ac- tions. Such a context makes it very difficult for us not to feel the same skepticism regarding this speaker's motivations that we would feel in any analogous human situation."17 But our skepticism is fueled not be- cause God is anthropomorphized but rather because, once he engages in reformed apologetics, he can no longer be seen as accommodated, the latter designed precisely to mitigate skepticism in its assumption that an essential (transcendent) deity exists beyond the compromised form.18 The important point is not that God is a characterological fail- ure-his polemics as such are engaging- but that we would be wrong to argue that God's dogmatism can be explained away as an example of accommodation. Against Alexander Pope's quip that Milton's "God the Father turns a school-divine," several Miltonists have suggested that God's speech could not have been ornamented figuratively or pitched in the Grand thodical logic works against any effort to follow it. God dwells on a point only for the length of time it takes to state it concisely (truly), and that time is insufficient for a merely human mind to assimilate the various parts of a complex argument" ( Surprised by Sin: The Reader iti Paradise Lost [New York: St. Martin's Press, 1967], 82). But I would suggest that, as soon as the totality that is God descends to argumentative logic, that omniscience turns into dogma, and so the speech it delivers loses the very element of "truth" that should be conveyed coming directly from a deific source. 17 Danielson, "The Fall and Milton's Theodicy," in The Cambridge Companion to Milton , ed. Dennis Danielson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), 149. 18 I agree with David Daiches's contention that Milton shows here "too little sense of the numinous," but I don't believe that the numinous is displaced necessarily by Milton's being "too detailed in his anthropomorphism." See his Milton (London: Hutchinson Uni- versity Library, 1957), 184.</page><page sequence="8">Paul Cefalu 205 Style: "Poetry is human and metaphorical/' Arnold Stein remarks, "and the Father's speeches are intended to express divine Justice as if di- rectly: to seem without seeming: to create the illusion of no illusion."19 That the clear delivery of theological information is God's chief purpose and function is elaborated by A. S. P. Woodhouse, who claims that "the knowledge conveyed - the firm assertion of man's free will - is essential to a comprehension of the poem, that decorum would hardly permit the poet to introduce images and similes into the speech of God . . . that this passage clearly has its function, not merely in conveying information, but in the pattern of the whole."20 The problem, though, is not purely stylistic in the sense that Milton had to opt for bloodless logic over in- decorous rhetorical flourish; the problem again is that God's foreknowl- edge relative to free will cannot be so reduced and would typically defy even the most incisive logical parsing.21 Michael Murrin has suggested that "If the Father argues a perfectly rational logic, for example, we should not understand that as a mirror of divinity or as Milton's con- ception of God; rather, it too fits a figure of accommodation."22 But this assumes too quickly that God's logic is "perfectly" logical or that such a position on arid doctrine can ever be rendered with unassailable deduc- tions. To refashion Pope's quip: Milton's God is not enough of a school- divine to render his speech on foreknowledge compelling. Milton's fit readers can appreciate the accommodated rationality of Milton's God, but too much denominational polemicizing will compro- mise such unassailable logos and rationality. And if we take the posi- tion that even those emotional outbursts of God are concordant with scripture and hence perfectly "just and reasonable," as Dennis Burden argues, we need not assume that Milton's God appears at all in con- descended form.23 Jeffrey Shoulson makes a compelling point when 19 Stein, Answerable Style: Essays on Paradise Lost (Minneapolis: The University of Min- nesota Press, 1954), 128. 20 Woodhouse, The Heavenly Muse: A Preface to Milton, ed.

But one can easily imagine the poetic and narrative difficulties of in- corporating such strategies into God's apology for foreknowledge and single predestination. The first challenge is that the speech is delivered to an angelic assembly, not Adam and Eve, an assembly that presum- ably should be able to intuit some of the subtleties of the concept with- out the need for God's exfoliating logic. Because the speech is designed as much for the reader's sake as it is to dramatize God's anger and frustration to his celestial auditors, Milton could not rely on the more typical tactic of putting such information in the mouth of one of the archangels, who might then be able, as Raphael does in analogous situa- tions, to remind the reader and Adam and Eve that the theoretical com- plexities of divine foreknowledge are beyond process of speech. The other option would be to have the omnipotent narrator accommodate God for us, analogous to the way in which he controversially qualifies our understanding of Satan's character. What would happen if the nar- rator, Calvin-like, interposed between God's speeches a reminder that God is just condescending to creaturely and angelic understanding, that the essence of the divine decrees is part of God's opaque internal effi- ciency and so inaccessible to us? That would preserve God's mystery even as God is anthropomorphized, but it would court the risk of quali- fying God's ability to represent himself adequately. To depict God in a mimetic epic requires a delicate balancing act between accommodation and anthropomorphism: to render God humanlike helps to make him believable, but without some reminder that God is much more than this human form, God ends up with a contracted rather than an expanded essence. At least with respect to the celestial dialogue, Milton's God is unrelatable because he is neither human nor godly enough. In their interpretations of Milton's tendency toward anthropomor- phism, several Miltonists have underlined Milton's contention in De Doctrina Christiana that because God chooses to represent himself di- rectly, even anthropathetically in scripture, we should take God at his 24 Shoulson, Milton and the Rabbis: Hebraism, Hellenism, and Christianity (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001), 126.</page><page sequence="10">Paul Cefalu 207 word and hence not employ a standard principle of accommodation in attempting to understand divine self-representation. LiÃ©b remarks that, if for Calvin accommodation is "tantamount to figuration/' for Milton God is an "author to himself," and so "to know God as he wishes him- self to be known is to read him in scriptures."25 Milton thus breaks with reformed dogmatics, according to Lieb, in motivating a new form of passibility describable as "theopatheia" that remains faithful to Milton's contention in De Doctrina Christiana that "on the question of what is or what is not suitable for God, let us ask for no dependable authority [auc- torem ] than God himself."26 It is undoubtedly true that Milton's God in Paradise Lost has been too frequently described as "antipassible," but Milton's rigorous scriptural take on accommodation in De Doctrina Christiana does not resolve the problematic characterization of God in Paradise Lost. Indeed if we are to take it seriously as a proof text for Paradise Lost , De Doctrina Chris- tiana is partly responsible for such representational challenges: God's speech on single predestination and resistible grace fails to do justice to the subtlety of the range of scriptural references to the concepts, the irreducible total of which is responsible for the roiling early modern debates on the subject. If we deny that Milton's God is just an accom- modated deity and that we have to take him at his word, we elevate a polemical position to the level of unassailable scripturalism (which would require a leap of faith beyond what is capable of even the most devout reader of Milton's text).27 But if we refuse to treat De Doctrina Christiana as a proof text, we still have the trouble of seeing God as ac- commodated precisely because he is too anthropomorphized, his mind and body so available for dialectical scrutiny that we lose sight, as it were, of the face behind the face. John E. Parrish summarizes the Mil- tonic ideal of accommodation by noting that "In 'condescending to ac- commodate himself to our capacities,' God has certainly not stooped to words which he that runs can read: the devout reader must still ponder and analyze and weigh various interpretations before determining on 25 Lieb, Theological Milton, 143. 26 Ibid., 147. 27 1 agree with William Madsen's contention that Milton would not arrogate to himself the accommodative abilities that he reserves for God himself: "It is therefore difficult to understand what it means to say that Milton uses the method of accommodation in Para- dise Lost , since he would hardly arrogate to himself a mode of understanding and expres- sion that he denies to the human authors of the Bible and reserves for God alone/' See his From Shadowy Types to Truth: Studies in Milton's Symbolism (New Haven, CT: Yale Univer- sity Press, 1968), 74.

Returning to the text, we can see that the subsequent Sacred Song partly serves to compensate for the failure of accommodation in the im- mediately preceding speeches on foreknowledge and free will. Con- sider the mystifying paean to God's ineffable names: Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent, Immutable, Immortal, Infinite . . . Amidst the glorious brightness where thou siÅ¥st Thron'd inaccessible, but when thou shad'st The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine. (3.372-79) This corresponds to the list of positive and negative divine attributes that Milton provides in the second chapter of the first book of De Doc- trina Christiana, where he underscores his use of accommodation: "It will be no less our duty to imagine him in our mind exactly as he- in adapting himself to our grasp- wants to be imagined" (29). But we get more than an accommodated figure of God in the Song; we get the nearly oxymoronic, concrete-abstract metaphor, "throned inacces- sible," which anthropomorphizes even as it renders abstract and out of reach the metonymical marker of God's throne. A truly accommodat- ing image would be one in which the throne is simply invoked, but the choir's reminder that it is inaccessible suggests an accommodative over- kill, as if Milton needs to remind his reader that the anthropomorphic image nevertheless leads to an uncommunicated deity. This helps to ex- plain, beyond its grandiloquence and dramatic effects, why the Song is placed sequentially where it is: had it come before God's account of his internal efficiency (as it does in De Doctrina Christiana ), God's sermo- nizing against supralapsarianism would seem to compromise the very epistemological and ontological mysteries established by the Song. The Song follows God's exposure of his internal efficiency and so reestab- lishes whatever majesty of God is compromised in the earlier dramatic exchanges with the Son. But there is still another explanation for the overly glib nature of God's speech on foreknowledge and free will, one that rests not simply 28 Parrish, "Milton and an Anthropomorphic God," Studies in Philology 56 (1959): 628.</page><page sequence="12">Paul Cefalu 209 on seeing this speech as a truncated Arminian explanation of God's single predestinarianism but also one that further assumes a distinctive approach on Milton's part to a long-standing Reformation debate about the relationship between the revealed and the hidden wills of God. This distinction is usually described as a tension between a theology of the cross, on the one hand, and the hiddenness of God, on the other hand. Martin Luther and John Calvin typically assume that, despite the outworking of God's government for humankind via the Incarnation, God's essential mystery was not entirely revealed in Christ, that God remained veiled despite his emptying of himself in the Son. Both theo- logians adhered to a concept of God's "double revelation" for polemical reasons: they needed to integrate a concept of hard divine determin- ism with the special grace of God administered through the Word of Christ. Luther remarks that we cannot discern God's intentions beyond noting that the source of grace is a manifestation of God's predestinat- ing purpose: beyond that, one only confronts the "concealed [occulta] and dreadful will of God, who, by his own design, ordains whom he wills to receive and partake of the mercy preached and offered. . . . This will is not to be enquired into, but reverently adored as far as the most awesome secret of the divine majesty, reserved to himself alone and for- bidden to us."29 This antinomy of wills is featured in Calvin's Institutes , as well, where Calvin refers to the secretive nature of God's creative decisions: the often contradictory mysteries through which God works through Christ remain distinct from the abyss of God's unrevealed will in the government of the world: "His wonderful way of governing the world is justly called an 'abyss' because while hidden from us, it ought reverently to be adored."30 Miltonists have long noted that, in Paradise Lost , God's position on human freedom accords not with Luther's or Calvin's position on supra- lapsarianism, but with Jacobus Arminius's stance on universal atone- ment. What has not been finely parsed, though, are the precise meta- physical reasons informing Arminius's theology. In his polemic against William Perkins, Arminius argues for a single, revealed will of God. Perkins had advanced a standard Lutheran-Calvinist account of God's two wills, remarking that "God in his commandements and promises doth not utter whatsoever hee hath decreed, but doth in part onely so 29 B.

For the hidden will of God is said to be efficacious; but if, in its exercise, God willed that the fall should occur, it is cer- tainly a necessary conclusion, also, that He effected the fall, that is, He must be the cause of the fall; for whatever God will, even by his hidden will, the same, also, He does both in Heaven and on the earth; and no one can resist His will, namely, that which is hidden.32 For Arminius, a distinction between God's hidden and revealed will might obtain elsewhere, especially regarding the creation of the world, but with respect to the epistemology of predestination such a distinc- tion would run up against a contradiction between what God decrees before and after the Fall. If we return to God's free will defense in Paradise Lost , we can see that one reason that God's will is so logically, authoritatively, and straight- forwardly manifested (and then so easily intuited and embellished by the pre-incarnated Son) is that his Arminian position refuses to posit a concealed will of God; hence we find an identity between God's revealed plan for humankind (this is why the Son is central to the dialogue) and his unrevealed will. And this explains further why there is no distinc- tive form of accommodation operating in the divine colloquy. The prob- lem, though, is that this doubly revealed and exposed Arminian God of the celestial realm is not easily integrated with the hidden God that of course needs to be heavily accommodated to Adam by Raphael and whose dark mysteries in relation to the creation, cosmos, and the prohi- bition accord much more with the Lutheran-Calvinist hidden God and even the Dionysian God of negative theology. This tension between the heavenly and the earthly God should not be explained away by noting that the divinely substantial Son, for example, would generally be ex- pected to have the ability to penetrate into the hidden will of God even as he embodies the revealed will, while the creaturely and discursively endowed Adam and Eve should not. The problem with that too-easy 31 Perkins, A Christian and plaine treatise of the manner and order of predestination and of the largenes of Gods grace (London, 1606), 15. 32 Arminius, An Examination of a Treatise Concerning the Order and Mode of rre- desination/' in The Complete Works of]acob Arminius, vol. 3 (CCEL, 2010), 220.</page><page sequence="14">Paul Cefalu 211 resolution is that the hidden will of God referenced in Raphael's ex- position is repeatedly clarified offstage by the Son/Christ, the latter of whom would not typically be privy to God's internal efficiency, even according to Arminius, for whom the integration of God's two wills in relation to predestinarianism is an exception rather than a rule. In his Fourth Disputation on the nature of God, Arminius explicitly remarks that, with respect to the hidden mysteries of God (those which would fall under "theoretical" rather than "practical knowledge"), even Christ should remain ignorant: "God's knowledge is so peculiarly his own, as to be impossible to be communicated to any thing created, not even to the soul of Christ; though we gladly confess, that Christ knows all those things which are required for the discharge of his office"33 (italics mine). Regarding the celestial dialogue in Paradise Lost , it is not that the pre- incarnated Christ and the Angels are unsurprisingly better endowed to understand God's hidden, unrevealed will; it is rather that the God of book 3 is difficult to reconcile, doctrinally speaking, with the God of much of the rest of the text. The remainder of this essay will attempt to reconstruct the manner in which Milton attempts to achieve, through what I will be describing as an incarnational apophatic, an integration of the overexposed God of heaven with the mostly hidden God of the creaturely realm. ACCOMMODATING HUMANS TO GOD Milton's more developed notion of accommodation in De Doctrina Christiana is, as several critics have noticed, based on a rigorous applica- tion of scriptural sufficiency. Cautioning against anthropopathy, Milton remarks, "It is therefore better to contemplate God and mentally imag- ine him not anthropopathetically, that is, as mortals do, who never stop inventing nicer definitions of God, but as scripture does" (29). As long as we remind ourselves that whatever human traits God attributes to himself should be viewed as perfect versions of their imperfect human exemplars, we are permitted to acknowledge whatever "form which he [God] assigns himself in sacred literature" (31). If we entertain a concep- tion of God that is not in accordance with what he has disclosed, "we are not following God's wishes but foiling God in his purpose" (33). We can begin to see the limits of De Doctrina Christiana as a proof 33 Arminius, "Disputation 4/' in The Complete Works of Jacob Arminius, vol. 2 (CCEL, 2010), 330.</page><page sequence="15">212 Rethinking Divine Accommodation in Paradise Lost text for the role of accommodation in Paradise Lost. What of those poetic elaborations of God in Paradise Lost that have no clear scriptural basis? Which scriptural accommodative paradigm or hermeneutical principle guides the reader of Raphael's embellishment of the war in heaven, during which God's conversations with Christ seem to rely on frank anthropopathy (and of course instigated Samuel Johnson's quip that Milton grossly confused the corporeal and the spiritual)?34 And how should we respond to the colloquy between Adam and God in book 8, a poetic elongation that has no extended scriptural warrant? In the fol- lowing section I suggest that, regarding the poem's allegorization of God's external efficiency (those moments and episodes in which God's decrees and activities are intermingled with the created orders), Milton does rely on an accommodative principle- not the one set forth in De Doctrina Christiana but rather an inverted version thereof- in which creatures are encouraged to lift themselves up to God's level. This is a form of accommodation that squares with some of the principles of the apophatic way of negative theology, but it is an expressly Christocentric or incarnational version of negative theology that mingles with but ulti- mately is distinguished from the more typical neo-Platonic theology of the Dionysian tradition bequeathed to the seventeenth century from the pseudo-Dionysius, who is often referred to as pseudo-Denys.35 Perhaps surprisingly, throughout Adam's colloquy with God on the creation of Eve, God is not accommodated or anthropomorphized to any obvious extent. In his recounting of the scene to Raphael, Adam notes only that God pronounces the terms "sternly" (8.333), God's stern- ness then giving way to a "dear aspect" (8.336). After Adam lodges his complaint about solitude, admitting his presumptuousness, the "sacred shape," which is little more than a "vision bright," shows interest as if "with a smile," Adam underscoring the use of simile in his descrip- tion (8.365-66) 36 God is then invoked as a "Heavenly Power" (8.379) and later responds to Adam with "gracious voice Divine" (8.436). De- 34 "The Confusion of spirit and matter which pervades the whole narration of the war in heaven, fills it with incongruity" (Johnson, Lives of the Poets : Milton, in The Works of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.: With an Essay on His Life and Genius by Arthur Murray, Esq., vol. 2 [New York, 1857], 44). 35 On the reception of the pseudo-Dionysius in seventeenth-century England, see Gary Kuchar, "A Greek in the Temple: Pseudo-Dionysius and Negative Theology in Richard Crashaw's 'Hymn in the Glorious Epiphany/" Studies in Philology 108 (2011): 261-98. 36 On the identity of the "shape Divine/' see Russell Hillier, "Milton's 'Genial Angel': The Identity and Salvific Office of the Son in Adam's Narrative of Creation and Recre- ation," Studies in Philology 107 (2010): 366-400.</page><page sequence="16">Paul Cefalu 213 spite the informality of the conversation and God's Socratic tutelage to Adam, the former comes off as ethereal and always just outside the outer limits of Adam's vision. What makes the conversation possible, what renders it a two-way col- loquy, is the grace of God's elevation of Adam so that the latter can speak to the former. Adam quickly intuits and exploits this realization, however feebly, in his complaint that he cannot likewise elevate the ani- mals to his level of understanding: Yet so pleas'd, Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt Of Union or Communion, deifi'd; I by conversing cannot these erect From prone, nor in thir ways complacence find. (8.429-33) God does not fundamentally descend to Adam; Adam ascends to God, Adam worrying that he would not be able to perform such a conjur- ing act on the ill-endowed animals beneath him. This reads as a denial of anthropomorphism on two planes: God does not need to anthropo- morphize himself, and neither Adam nor the beasts have the power to anthropomorphize the latter. But Adam's true epiphany happens just before he falls asleep and Eve is created from his rib: Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now My earthly by his Heav'nly overpower'd, Which it had long stood under, strain'd to the highth In that celestial Colloquy sublime, As with an object that excels the sense, Dazzl'd and spent, sunk down, and sought repair Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd By Nature as in aid, and clos'd mine eyes. (8.452-59) Adam's closing remarks raise the question of the precise source of his ability to engage in such a high-pitched conversation with God. While Adam had earlier noted the asymmetry of God's giving the power of his creatures to converse with him relative to the human inability to give the power of animals to converse with humans, the cause of Adam's ability to speak with God is now not one-sidedly God's gift or grace. By saying that he was "straining to the height" in order to converse with God, and that he is now spent, Adam suggests that he has exercised his own desire and latent ability to rise to such a height, or that, at most,</page><page sequence="17">214 Rethinking Divine Accommodation in Paradise Lost God was the efficient cause of such ability, Adam himself something like the material cause. However we parse the causal nexus, we conclude that Adam's limited creaturely ability was to some extent "accommo- dated" to God's level. There is a further sense that Adam's keen ability to recount such an esoteric story to Raphael requires a mode of two-way accommoda- tion between himself and the archangel. That the divine historian must render palatable his narratives of the war in heaven and cosmologi- cal design is clearly stated in his prefatory comments leading into his exposition of the exaltation of the Son: "What surmounts the reach / Of human sense, I shall delineate so, / By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, / As may express them best" (5.571-74). We know from Raphael's distinction between discursive and intuitive reasoning that the latter is a distinctly human vehicle of communication, and we recall that God himself motivates such an accommodation when he enlists Raphael to "such discourse bring on" to Adam and Eve (5.233). These accom- modative discourses continue after Adam plies Raphael with further questions on both astronomy and the creation of the world, although here Raphael worries that such abstract musings might not be rendered palatable to Adam's creaturely ability: "This also thy request with cau- tion askt / Obtain: though to recount Almighty works / What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, / Or heart of man suffice to compre- hend? / Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve / To glorify the Maker, and infer / Thee also happier, shall not be withheld / Thy hear- ing" (7.111-18). More is suggested in these lines than a continuation of Raphael's translated discourse to Adam. The line "yet what thou canst attain" shifts attention away from Raphael's ability to refashion divine decrees into discursive form and toward Adam's creaturely ability to absorb such gnomic information. It turns out that, despite some blun- ders along the way, Adam shows himself quite capable of, if not rising to angelic intuitiveness, at least meeting Raphael halfway and display- ing his keen attunement to the nuances of the creation narrative. If we look more closely, we see that the entire conversation be- tween Raphael and Adam is as much concerned to underscore, or at least suggest, Adam's ability to elevate his discursive ability to under- stand Raphael as it is Raphael's ability to condescend to Adam's level. Such creaturely abilities are hinted at in Raphael's prefatory remarks to Adam just before his narrative of the war in heaven when, after promis- ing to liken spiritual to corporeal forms, he adds "though what if Earth / Be but the shadow of Heav'n, and things therein / Each to other like</page><page sequence="18">Paul Cefalu 215 more than on Earth is thought?" (5.574-76). Raphael wonders whether he even needs to accommodate the spiritual to the corporeal, since the ontological and epistemological distance between the angelic and the creaturely might not be as wide as is typically assumed. And the pos- sibility of this narrow distance is itself informed by the often remarked neo-Platonic cast to Raphael's account of the scale of nature: since all is created from first matter, and all is motivated to 'return' upward, there is only a difference in degree, not kind, between angelic and creaturely understanding: "Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse / Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, / Differing but in degree, of kind the same" (5.488- 90). The reason that Adam seems "in Heav'n" when he discourses with Raphael is not merely because Raphael is an adept storyteller; it is also because Adam has no mean capacity to enlarge his own creaturely imagination. Perhaps the clearest example of this bi-directionality occurs during Adam's prefatory comments to Raphael regarding his colloquy with God. After Raphael has finished spinning his extended metaphor of the war in heaven, Adam shows himself eager to try his own hand at re- counting a lofty story: "now hear mee relate / My story, which perhaps thou hast not heard" (8.204-5); and, in an unmistakable structural echo of Raphael's earlier preface to the angel's story- "to recount Almighty works / What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice (7.112-13)- Adam remarks, "For Man to tell how human Life began / Is hard; for who him- self beginning knew?" (8.250-51). Framed in the context of a courteous, Chaucerian exchange of stories, Adam will now raise up his creaturely abilities to narrate to the cognitively endowed archangel the very gene- sis of human life. Adam has been empowered by Raphael's example of storytelling, and so, in an analogous way, can tell of things unseen by the archangel himself. Throughout Raphael's exposition of the war in heaven and cosmo- logical matters, Milton seems to be relying as much on the negative- theological view of accommodation as he does the more traditional Calvinist approach, the latter of which assumes that frank anthropo- morphism is a basic scriptural means of accommodating God to human capacity. For the pseudo-Dionysius (and his scrupulous sixteenth- century commentator Dean John Colet), positive anthropomorphisms- representing God with eyes, hands, or other body parts- is a too- dangerous affair for initiates: the construal of God and heavenly matters in relation to such "sacred shapes" can foster the presumption that the communicant can apprehend the deity:</page><page sequence="19">2i6 Rethinking Divine Accommodation in Paradise Lost Because a hidden principle of the Deity resides in all things, on account of that faint resemblance the sacred writers have endeavored to indicate [God] to the name of all objects, not only of the better but also of the worse kind; lest the duller sort attracted by the beauty of the fairer objects, should think God to be that very thing which he is called.37 The way of negation, through which God is manifested in base, material form, is a more permissible, even safer form of accommodation: those sacred images that are most unlike God, those worldly and crude ob- jects that seem "entirely inadequate and ridiculous," are the ideal God- representations, for they pay homage in their very dissimilarity to the ineffable quality of deity. This helps to explain the mock-heroic, even comic reconstruction of the war in heaven, much remarked by Milton- ists, in which the angelic corps excavates the very "earth" of heaven in order to parry the cannon-fire of the rebels (Stein memorably described the scene as a "custard pie" fight), suggesting that Raphael needs to rely on a crude form of engaging materialism to get his (and God's) mes- sage across about the perils of hypocrisy; and the Dionysian form of ac- commodation more generally explains Adam's questing for more lofty information after getting a whiff of the divine ways through such nar- rative materialism.38 After he has just digested the lesson of the war in heaven, Adam shifts his attention away from the materiality of that ex- position to the ethereality of the divine nous behind the further circum- scription of chaos: "What cause / Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest / Through all Eternity so late to build / In Chaos " (7.90-93). Adam en- acts (or attempts to enact) the step-wise process of Dionysian pedagogy, namely, an initial exposure to a materially accommodated aspect of God's designs, from which one can progress from such shadowy types to truth. Dionsyian accommodative theology was designed to take any individual from "nothingness" to shadows, shadows to images, and then images to absolute knowledge. The sacred, anagogie truths or, as Origen, via Saint Paul, describes them, the "oracles of God," are vouch- safed to a select few (Moses, for example, received the true, rather than literal or allegorical sense of the Law), and such truths are filtered to the prophets and ecclesiastical officials (analogous to the role of the arch- angels in Paradise Lost). In this case, the otherwise faithful rank-and-file (Adam and Eve) must strive to unfold such mysteries through their ini- tial engagement with ordinary objects, images, and types (in Raphael's 37 Colet, Two Treatises on the Hierarchies of Dionysius, trans. J. H. Lupton (London, 1869), 13- 38 See Stein, Answerable Style, 24.</page><page sequence="20">Paul Cefalu 217 terms, "contemplation from created things"), after which they can attain to more celestial heights. This helps to explain why, in Raphael's re- construction of God's comments to the Son during the war in heaven and then prior to the creation, the invisible nature of God is reasserted against any manifest anthropomorphism. Ready to enlist the Son to rout the rebel army, God emphasizes his invisibility: "Son belov'd, / Son in whose face invisible is beheld / Visibly, what by Deity I am" (6.680-82); and of course the subsequent description of God as one who fills infini- tude, "nor vacuous the space" (7.169), is hardly an anthropomorphic figuration (despite the material monism underlying divine ontology). Suffice it to say that this is quite unlike the Calvinist tactic of accom- modation, which typically relies on an unabashed anthropomorphism that clarifies divine decrees but in keeping with the top-down charity (agapeism) of Calvinist dogma does not in turn coax the communicant into questing after more knowledge.39 FALLING INTO ACCOMMODATION Yet there are limits to what Milton's God will divulge to Adam through various forms of accommodation; and there are limits placed on the nature and content of the questions that Adam might put to Raphael re- garding God's designs. After Raphael has cautioned Adam to "be lowly wise," and to "think only what concerns thee and thy being" (8.173- 74), Adam reveals that he has learned a rather conventional distinction between illicit theoretical curiosity, on the one hand, and permissible questioning about practical conduct, on the other hand: "That not to know at large of things remote / From use, obscure and subtle, but to know / That which before us lies in daily life, / Is the prime Wisdom; what is more, is fume, / Or emptiness, or fond impertinence" (8.191-95). Raphael has already tagged as "matters hid" (8.167) those unrevealed decrees of God that Adam should neither ask nor "invent" ideas about: "Nor let thine own inventions hope / Things not reveal'd, which th' in- visible King, / Only Omniscient, hath supprest in Night, / To none com- municable in Earth or Heaven" (7.121-24). What are these unrevealed quiddities tucked away safely in the Night? While some are clearly cos- 39 The distinction between the Calvinist and Dionysian modes of accommodation aligns to a certain extent with Hugh MacCallum's differentiation between "epistemologi- ca!" and "social accommodation/' at least regarding the pedagogical function of the latter. See his "Milton and Figurative Interpretation of the Bible/' University of Toronto Quarterly 31 (1962): 402-3. See also Kathleen M. Swain's use of such a distinction, in "The Mimesis of Accommodation in Book 3 of Paradise Lost," Philological Quarterly 63 (1983): 463.</page><page sequence="21">2i8 Rethinking Divine Accommodation in Paradise Lost mological, such as whether the Sun "predominates" Earth or vice versa, most are related to God's divine, internal decrees, including not only divine foreknowledge and the divine names, but also the reasons be- hind God's creaturely decrees, especially the nature of the prohibition. The distinction between theory and practice most often amounts to a distinction between "why" God has done something and "how" his creatures can best give him praise and thanks for what he has done. To question the reasoning of God or the "why" of his decrees is to ques- tion his intentions or motives, the latter of which are clearly not within bounds for Adam and Eve. And this further implies, although it goes unstated in any of Raphael's warnings, that Adam and Eve should avoid anthropomorphizing God, because to ascribe and then attempt to fer- ret out hidden intentions is to attribute mindedness to God, a sure way to render him humanlike. But the continuing question before us is why Milton's God, despite Milton's embrace of accommodation in De Doc- trina Christiana, severely limits the extent to which he accommodates himself and/or limits the ability of Adam and Eve to anthropomorphize and hence accommodate him for themselves. One answer is that, by its very nature, accommodation will typically encourage a degree of further questioning in the auditor. To have one level of conversation with God, either directly or through angelic emis- saries, is to want another such conversation: accommodation clarifies doctrine but inevitably invites curiosity and further exegesis. Each time Raphael translates one of God's mysteries to Adam, Adam chomps at the bit for more. Once Raphael has finished his labored exposition of the war in heaven, having measured, at Adam's request, "things in Heav'n by things on Earth" (6.893), Adam is "led on, yet sinless, with desire to know / What nearer might concern him ... as one whose drouth / Yet scarce allay 'd still eyes the current stream, / Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites" (7.61-68). The qualifier "yet sinless" antici- pates the narrator's exact phrasing about Eve, also designated as "yet sinless," even though at such a point she arguably has already become ensnared by the serpent's logic during the temptation scene (9.659). And the "liquid murmur" recalls Eve's earlier episode at the lake, in which she indulges her "vain desire" (4.466) to consummate her reflec- tion. Raphael's metaphoric narratives to Adam run the risk of enticing dangerous curiosity even as they clarify fateful events and doctrine out of reach. In terms of the effects of such accommodating figurations, they differ little from the prohibition itself. It is as if, in Milton's hands, ac- commodation functions after the manner of the Mosaic law in Pauline</page><page sequence="22">Paul Cefalu 219 theology: not so much to instruct and guide behavior but to remind one precisely of one's inability to uphold the law, to remind one of the very limits of creaturely ability and, most important, the need for some inter- cessor on the communicant's behalf. If accommodation from material things (what I have been describing as the Dionysian way) is productive and permissibly used in Raphael's exposition, that form of accommo- dation turns out to be limited, even self-negating, for Adam and Eve, both upon and following the temptation scene, will indeed indulge the very roving fancies (8.188) and "perplexing thoughts (8.183) that, by the close of Raphael's narrative in book 8, Adam has promised to keep in check. One way of reading Milton's account of accommodation in De Doctrina Christiana into Paradise Lost is to say that the poetic treat- ment of the topic tests the limits of accommodation as established in the treatise: the whole point of accommodation, Milton remarks in De Doc- trina Christiana, is to keep at bay our human tendency toward "vague thoughts and sophistries" regarding God's ways, the very cogitations that Satan will incite in Eve during the temptation scene (29). Indeed the function of such accommodation in Raphael's several nar- ratives is not simply to help Adam and Eve bind themselves to God but also to introduce the pair to the intercessory and meritorious actions of the Son (although at this point they understandably have no conception of the Incarnation). As many Miltonists agree, God's allowance of the protracted war in heaven is designed to exalt the Son's power, epically illustrated for the humble Adam and Eve, an orchestrated military pre- lude that prompted William Empson to claim that the war is enabled so that the Son can "win his spurs."40 Raphael's response to Adam's subse- quent question as to what motivated God to create the world provides occasion for Raphael to continue to represent the Son's extensive power as God's Word: "And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee / This I per- form, speak thou, and be it done" (7.163-64). The creation is followed in the text by Adam's retrospective account of his own creation dur- ing which Adam speaks with a "shape Divine" (8.295), the reference of which might refer to the Son even as it does the Father.41 Soon after the 40 See Empson, Milton's God (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1961), 95-97. Russell M. Hillier has convincingly argued that Raphael's narration of the three-day war in heaven functions "on the inside" as both a temporal and spatial Passion allegory (Milton's Messiah: The Son of God in the Works of John Milton [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011], espe- cially chap. 4). On the role of the Son in the war in heaven, see Stella Puree Revard, The War in Heaven: Paradise Lost and the Tradition of Satan's Rebellion (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1980), chap. 7, passim. 41 See Hillier, "Milton's 'Genial Angel,"' 366-400.</page><page sequence="23">220 Rethinking Divine Accommodation in Paradise Lost Fall, before the Son administers prevenient grace, Adam tells Eve that he vaguely recalls hearing of what will issue into the protevengelium: "I have in view, calling to mind with heed / Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise / The Serpent's head" (10.1030-32). The important point is that the apophatic instruction via accommodation undergone by Adam and Eve- Raphael's tutelage from material and created things- is designed not to instruct Adam and Eve on the mysterious nature of God as such but to introduce them to the meritorious actions of the Son and what will become for them the Atonement.42 But before attempting to explain how Milton's negative theology can be reconciled with his Christocentrism, we should turn to the various ways in which the Son is accommodated in the text. THE SON IN THE PLACE OF ACCOMMODATION Traditional accounts of divine accommodation, especially the Calvin- ist, assume two separate but related modes of revelation. The first en- compasses general revelation in which God descends to the level of human understanding in order to reveal otherwise hidden aspects of his being. The second covers special or historical revelation in which God's redemptive activities are mediated through the works of Christ. 'Accommodation is of two varieties," writes Dowey, "(a) the univer- sal and necessary accommodation of the infinite mysteries of God to finite comprehension, which embraces all revelation, and (b) the spe- cial gracious accommodation to human sinfulness which is connected with the work of redemption."43 So the names of God, the nature of his substance/essence, and, as we have begun to see, his decrees regarding creation, predestination, and foreknowledge, fall under general revela- tion, but the mediatorial offices of Christ and the very Incarnation and (economic) Trinity fall under special or historical accommodation: "The Redeeming Word, like the Creative Word, is spoken by the Eternal Wis- dom of God through the created order, but in a special language accom- modated to the aggravated condition of sinful creatureliness."44 The Son does seem to function as the apotheosis of special, redemp- 42 Which is to say that Raphael's extended metaphor does not fail to bind their obedi- ence as much as leads them, both accommodatively and typologically, to Christ. In his otherwise brilliant exposition of the Miltonie versus Romantic notions of accommodation, Geoffrey Hartman neglects both the Christology and felix culpa theme of Raphael's nar- ration. See his "Adam on the Grass with Balsamum," ELH 36 (1969): especially 178-84. 43 Dowey, The Knowledge of God in Calvin's Theology, 4. 44 Ibid., 9.</page><page sequence="24">Paul Cefalu 221 tive accommodation in Paradise Lost : not simply chosen by God to re- deem humankind, he voluntarily submits to serve as mediator and ran- som for human sinfulness: "Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life / 1 offer, on mee let thine anger fall; / Account mee man" (3.236-3 8). To have the Son prove his merit by his self-ransoming is a powerful accommo- dative stroke: it renders any obscure mysteries of the Incarnation dra- matically available to the heavenly host, reader, and, as we have seen, Adam and Eve through the means of Raphael's accommodative narra- tive. But the Son's role is of course not limited to his redemptive activi- ties in the text, Milton endowing him with the unassailable power to rout the rebel army and later create the world as God's Word. In the lan- guage of the more systematic theology of De Doctrina Christiana , the Son also enjoys the unrivaled power to intuit God's otherwise hidden ideas, and his access to God's mind is not limited to God's redemptive plans or external efficiency; it also penetrates into the subtleties of God's inter- nal efficiency. An important example centers on the question of God's glory. Because the Son understands why Adam and Eve are created, he likewise knows that God would never destroy the means by which the latter are glorified: "Wilt thou thyself / Abolish thy Creation, and un- make, / For him, what for thy glory thou hast made? / So should thy goodness and thy greatness both / Be question'd and blasphem'd with- out defense" (3.162-66). God ceremonially rejoices that only the Son is able to access his true intentions: "O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight, / Son of my bosom, Son who art alone / My word, my wisdom, and effectual might, / All hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all / As my Eternal purpose hath decreed" (3.168-72). The Son's intuitiveness, again much appreciated by his Father, is reiterated when God marvels that the Son understands so well his affection for creaturely life: "My sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear / To me are all my works, nor Man the least / Though last created" (3.276-78). Not simply the accom- modated manifestation of God's redemptive activity, the co-substantial entity through whom God can carry out his external efficiency, the Son actively reads God's mind and then translates the contents of God's mind to the assembly and the reader, after which God praises him for being so divinely attuned. As both divine vehicle and agent, the Son achieves a very humanlike task but one of which only he is meritoriously capable. And in anticipating and then interpreting the contents of God's thoughts or mind, the Son is the one who, in his several exchanges with God, most typically anthropomorphizes God, as if Milton suggests that the right to such an anthropomorphism is reserved for the Son himself.</page><page sequence="25">222 Rethinking Divine Accommodation in Paradise Lost Milton thus does not disappoint our expectation that the Son would be the ultimate accommodation of God at least with respect to special revelation and his mediatorial role. But with respect to the otherwise concealed preexisting reasons as to why God creates humankind and what God gains precisely from such a creation, Milton might have had God or one of the archangels offer approximate explanations, which would then be seen as accommodations to human sensibility. Milton's tendency to reserve this sort of general accommodation for the Son again serves to bolster the Son's exceptionalism: as a separate, not co- essential agent, the Son is humanlike in his active attunement to the hid- den intentions of God, but he is divine in being the only one who is per- mitted and able to understand and articulate such intentions.45 Can we say, then, that the very existence of the Son in the text ex- emplifies a thoroughgoing accommodation of God on Milton's part? I would argue that, if we understand accommodation in the traditional concealing-revealing sense described earlier, we should not see the Son as carrying out such a role. Accommodation was not a means by which God's mind would be emptied to the faithful: it was simply a rhetorical strategy by which the nature of God's revelatory ways might be made accessible to the limits of human understanding. The reason that accom- modated talk was typically described as divine "lisping" is that such talk did not penetrate to the truth or essence of God. When the Son transcribes God's ideas to his auditors, those crystalline articulations are obviously not pitched as baby-talk: they are transmissions of the genuine articles of God's otherwise unrevealed decrees. Rather than see the Son as the ultimate accommodation of God, we should see the Son as the very reason that the sustained use of accommodation is unneces- sary in the text. Consider further the Son's explanation as to why God created man- kind: "Wilt thou thyself / Abolish thy Creation, and unmake, / For him, what for thy glory thou hast made?" (3.162-64). The Son seems to have penetrated to the quick of God's motivational psychology (and pro- vided to the reader a proleptic answer to Adam's question to Raphael 45 I have been assuming that Milton's supposed Arianism needs to be qualified, given the Son's exceptional divine attunement, even omniscience throughout Paradise Lost. Pa- trides convincingly remarks that Milton adjusted the divinity of the Son for dramatic effects: "Milton achieved the proper balance between matter and manner by preserving the unity of the Godhead even when, for dramatic purposes, he differentiated between the Father and the Son" (Patrides, Milton and the Christian Tradition, 25). Pallister extends this view in his discussion of divine rhetoric (Between Worlds, 124-26). For a good critique of the traditional Arian school of Paradise Lost, see Hillier, Milton's Messiah, chap. 1.</page><page sequence="26">Paul Cefalu 223 as to what cause moved God to further withdraw from chaos) (7.90- 93). Given God's exclamation that the Son has spoken as his (God's) "thoughts are," we have to assume that the Son has gotten the nature of divine glory right, that he has revealed God's will. But this manifestly strays from Raphael's accommodated answer to Adam, described by Patrides, for example, as the erroneous repopulation theory, according to which God's decision to create a new world was the result of "God's desire to repair the 'detriment' caused by the expulsion of the rebellious angels."46 For Patrides, the decisive reason why God creates the world is exposed in the angelic hymn, which praises God's desire to "diffuse / His good to Worlds and Ages infinite" (7.190-91). Patrides does not at- tempt to explain why Raphael would provide the wrong explanation to Adam, and when it comes to integrating the dissemination of divine goodness with divine glory, Patrides turns to De Doctrina Christiana to note that the former actually implies the latter: "This statement does not contradict the Son's declaration in Paradise Lost that man was made for the glory of God (3.164). Milton in De doctrina Christiana observes that God created the world 'for the manifestation of the glory of his power and goodness' . . . implying that we may not distinguish between the diffusive goodness and the glory of God."47 One feels that this yoking of De Doctrina Christiana to Paradise Lost glosses over the poem's ambi- guity on the topic: glory might include diffusive goodness, but it also might entail more than such a benevolent dissemination. And we get something like a fourth explanation of why God created the world in Paradise Regained when the Son fervently replies to Satan's charge of divine selfishness that God created "Though chiefly not for glory as prime end, / But to show forth his goodness" (3.123-24). Glory here is not strictly identified with diffusive goodness; it might be a secondary, if not primary, end of God's designs. What does the crux of divine glory (and the very fact of such compet- ing explanations) suggest about Milton's use of special accommodation in Paradise Lost ? Given that Raphael's repopulation theory is not at all included in the Son's explanation, the Son serves to render implausible or even negate Raphael's explanation. Yet the Son's explanation from glory is still not easily reconciled with the choir's explanation from divine goodness, the latter of which would seem to be more in keeping with traditional Reformed explanations of divine psychology. Since the 46 Patrides, Milton and the Christian Tradition, 37. 47 Ibid., 39.</page><page sequence="27">224 Rethinking Divine Accommodation in Paradise Lost Son has the sole capacity to intuit God's ideas and express his will, we have to assume that glory is the chief reason, which in turn discredits the choir's explanation as just another erroneous form of accommoda- tion. Now it may be true that there are creative ways in which glory can be reconciled with divine goodness and that such an integration would approach the more essential, fundamentally irreducible nature of God's glory, but the Son's brief explanation does not admit of such subtleties. The Son's dÃ©mystification of God's concealed nature closes the field of possible explanations regarding one of God's fundamental mysteries- why he creates humankind- and in so doing, the Son works to render any accommodated explanation null and void. When Raphael remarks to Adam that "Things not reveal'd" (7.122) are "To none communicable in Earth or Heaven" (7.124), he somewhat poignantly fails to appreciate the Son's exceptionalism. Should we extend to Paradise Lost Graves's view that, with respect to De Doctrina Christiana , Milton relies on a synecdochal mode of ac- commodation, providing us with just a part of a larger whole of God's decision to create the world? Given that the Son executively settles on one explanation among three presented in the poem, that he espouses a simplified truth, I would argue that we are not getting one aspect of God's reasoning that might stand for a larger whole; rather, the whole has been shrunk and contracted such that a partial explanation has to be accepted in place of a more entire explanation. For dramatic pur- poses and to exalt the Son, the Son's expression of God's will ought to be forthright, logical, and overriding, yet for those very reasons we get a reduction of subtlety rather than a synecdochal rendering. Graves's capital example of Milton's synecdochal use of accommodation is the Mosaic image of seeing God's hind parts, which for Graves suggests that God is much more than the partial figure. But on the subject of divine glory, I would suggest that the Son has analogously reduced God to his hind parts and then assured us that there is little more to be said on the matter.48 MILTON'S INCARNATION AL APOPHATIC How, finally, can we integrate the negative theology described earlier with the evident (even overriding) Christology just outlined? Is there a particular theological and historical tradition of relating the negative or 48 See Graves, "Milton and the Theory of Accommodation/' 261-62.</page><page sequence="28">Paul Cefalu 225 apophatic way with a theology of the cross on which Milton might have drawn? Bryson has done Miltonists a great service by underscoring the importance of the negative way in Paradise Lost , pointing out the un- certainty and contradictoriness in relation to the invocation of light in book 3, the overall qualifying role of the narrator, and the bifurcated nature of Milton's dark God who mingles destruction with creation.49 In each of these instances, Milton's positive constructions are system- atically negated such that, in keeping with Dionysian theology, "to each and every image that is raised, to each and every definition that is offered, the poem's response is not this"50 Bryson makes a compelling ar- gument that, in Paradise Lost, the images attached to God are not this ; yet because Bryson stops short of any attempt to account for Milton's Chris- tology, he does not consider that the Son is the one image and figure about which the poem's resounding response is that God is indeed this. This is not to say that negative theology cannot be reconciled with Christocentrism, but it is to say that the more familiar versions of the negative way as handed down to us from the pseudo-Dionysius pro- vide only a partial explanation as to Milton's approach to these matters in Paradise Lost. Dionysian negative theology is typically described as a "complete apophatic," meaning that affirmative theology (the interpre- tation of scriptural images) gradually gives way to negations through a rigorous process of illumination and purgation; eventually a peda- gogy of learned ignorance instructs the penitent to negate even all such negations, after which he or she can ideally unite with God. The Diony- sian exemplar is Moses, who "plunges into the truly mysterious dark- ness of unknowing. . . . Here, being neither oneself nor someone else, one is supremely united to the wholly Unknown by an inactivity of all knowledge."51 Dionysian apophatic completes itself because union with even an "unknown" God is theoretically achievable. This sort of com- plete apophatic should be distinguished from the "progressive apo- phatic" of early theologians like Gregory of Nyssa (a fourth-century Cappadocian Father), for whom the process of illumination and purga- tion is never completed, with God always receding from view. Despite the subtle differences, neither the complete nor the progressive negative way figures Christ or the Incarnation as central to the movement of the initiate. Indeed, Dionysius posited that the God accessed through pur- 49 Bryson, "The Mysterious Darkness of Unknowing/' 183-212. so Ibid., 198. 51 See Rorem, "Negative Theologies and the Cross/' 319.</page><page sequence="29">22Ã Rethinking Divine Accommodation in Paradise Lost gation negates even the Trinitarian hypostasis: "not wisdom nor one nor oneness, divinity nor goodness; it is not spirit or son or fatherhood/'52 But there is a version of negative theology that historically was inte- grated with Christology, and that is an alternative tradition running from John of Scythopolis and Maximus the Confessor (sixth-century Byzantine theologians) through Bonaventure and medieval scholasti- cism and eventually achieving full expression in Luther's Christology. This incarnational apophatic, scripturally based in Johannine theology (for example, "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared 'him'" [John 1.18]), 53 assumes that the way of negation leads not to an otherwise transcen- dent God, but to the revealed (although still contradictory and hidden) God of the cross. In such a theology, the way of negation leads to the In- carnation, the divine Word, and the immanence of Christ. Luther's well- known critique of Dionysius in the Bondage of the Will and The Babylo- nian Captivity rests on his view that Dionysius neglected the hiddenness of God in Christ: "Dionysius, who wrote about 'negative theology' and 'affirmative theology/ deserves to be ridiculed. ... He defines 'affirma- tive theology' as 'God is being.' 'Negative theology' he defines as 'God is nonbeing.' But, if we wish to give a true definition of 'negative the- ology,' we should say that it is the holy cross and the afflictions [attend- ing it]."54 This brings us back to Luther's earlier distinction between the two wills of God, which sits uneasily with his incarnational apophatic.55 An extended discussion of this tension in Luther's writing is beyond our scope here, but suffice it to say that Luther had trouble reconciling his notion that God's mysteries are emptied in Christ, on the one hand, with his sense that God remains a pre-incarnated deus absconditus, on the other hand. 56 52 Ibid., 320.

In so doing, the Son unfolds whatever mysteries God might traditionally retain over and above his special accommodation via the creation of the Son and the Incarnation of Christ. If traditional Lutheran, Calvinist, and Arminian accounts of special accommodation assume that God abases himself for humankind through the transfigured Word, in Milton's extension the Son in turn empties whatever remains of God's pre-incarnational mysteries. Milton does not merely yoke the negative apophatic to his Christology: he does both the cataphatic and apophatic traditions one better by having the Son/ Christ consistently expose God's otherwise uncommunicated aspects.58 This is narratively achieved in the text through the very prising apart and then elevation of anthropomorphism over accommodation: God emerges as most anthropomorphic when he converses with the Son, since the latter, understandably anthropomorphized, has the special privilege of reading God's mind and hence rendering his father human- like. We have seen the ways in which God loses majesty in the pro- cess, not least because the clarity of what we see (his passibility, for ex- ample), is not always matched with the clarity of what he says. To have an anthropomorphic God define in such a delimited way his internal decrees regarding predestination, his motives for creation, and the na- 57 Traditional accounts of the Platonic and Neo-Platonic pedigree of Raphael's presen- tation of the scale of nature overlook the mingling of Milton's theology of ascent with his Christocentrism. See, for an early example, Irene Samuel's Plato and Milton, which makes scant reference to the Son/Christ in an otherwise exemplary Platonist interpretation of Raphael's extended metaphor ([Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1947] 109-30). 58 Keenly alert to the limits and dangers of the use of theological accommodation, Vic- toria Silver remarks that the "correspondence theory of accommodation can result in a sort of emanation scheme," or "doctrine of likeness," in which "accommodation can dan- gerously expect real continuities." See her Imperfect Sense: The Predicament of Milton's Irony (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2001), 49-50. The issue, though, is not that Paradise Lost indulges or rejects such a correspondence theory of accommodation (which overlaps with the Dionysian account of accommodation) but that Milton's correspon- dence theory leads to God through the Son, who, while he reveals aspects of God's hid- denness, does not thereby reinstate an emanationist or analogical relationship between God and Adam and Eve.</page><page sequence="31">228 Rethinking Divine Accommodation in Paradise Lost ture of the prohibition is inevitably to truncate and obfuscate such de- crees even while they are made available to inspection. When the Son reveals God to the various diegetic and extra-diegetic auditors of Para- dise Lost, he ends up contracting rather than expanding the Father of which he is a part. If we are finally to understand Milton's approach to theological ac- commodation in Paradise Lost , we should say that he uses it skeptically and even tests its effectiveness and capaciousness as an exegetical de- vice that might be of use in mimetic poetry, rather than that he unquali- fiedly applies it according to any traditional acceptation or even accord- ing to the scripturalist manner in which he redefines it in De Doctrina Christiana. The limits rather than virtues of accommodation are on dis- play throughout the epic: God cannot both anthropomorphize and ac- commodate himself, for to do so would require him to wink at his audi- tors, assuring them that there is an "other behind the other." Raphael's bid at measuring the heavenly in accordance with the earthly rivets Adam's attention, but it points up the danger of the enticing and provok- ing nature of accommodated discourse. The Son would seem to be the apotheosis of accommodation in the text, and indeed Milton reserves this role for him, yet his keen ability to read the mind of the divine for his auditors and the reader flouts the fundamental concealing-revealing purpose of accommodation. Rather than put accommodation to prac- tice, Paradise Lost emerges as fictional proof text against the poetical ap- plication of such a widely used exegetical principle.
