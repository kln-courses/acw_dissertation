No full scale work on the history of ancient wines has been published, in English, since the early part of the last century. The account then written by Henderson preceded the era of far-reaching archaeological discoveries which have greatly increased our knowledge of many aspects of the ancient world. The present book is an expanded ver sion of the author's essay 'The Wine Trade in Ancient Greece* (History Today, 5, 12, 86oif) and is also reproduced in his 'Riot at Ephesus', 153-161 (this journal 31, *959&gt; 368 ff): to this has been added ma terial from 'Delphi II: The other God' (History Today, 1, 9, 13 ff). Generously illustrated with figures and with plates, it contains a series of topics related to the broad theme of 'Wine' rather than a de velopment of one particular aspect. The key to the character of the work is given by the author himself. ?It has been a plea sing diversion to write this little book, even in the knowledge that much has been left unsaid and that many a gap is left unfilled. The topic is one which could have been made burdensome with piled stati stics and given the savour of heavy sweet wine or the aridity of wine turned to vine gar. Better to let gaiety reign about this gladdening subject? (181). The late Charles Seltman wrote about wine with feeling, authority and as a con noisseur (cf. 72 and 143). In the opening chapter he sets the scene at a Greek sym posium basing his graphic description partly on the text of Xenophon's 'Sympo sium* and partly on the evidence of vase painting which during the Red-figured period was rich in 'banquet scenes'. Illu strations are drawn from Epiktetos, Bry gos and the Foundry painter. Here, how ever, as elsewhere, not always the best choi ce has been made and one feels that an opportunity has been missed. The wild grape-vine flourished from Turkestan to Thrace and the Caucasus ap pears to have been its original home. This is supported by the evidence of language and of tradition. ?At least as far back as</page><page sequence="2">J. F. Healy: Seltman, Wine in the ancient world 165 1500 B. C. the Hittites whose language was dominant in Asia Minor and adjoining regions, referred to it in their cuneiform script as 'uiian-', in hieroglyphic as 'ui?nas' and in Luwian as 'yin-'? (15). A kind of wine had probably been produced in Mesopotamia before 3000 B. C. (17). Its spread from Asia Minor and its associa tion with a god, or gods, is described to gether with the processes of assimilation involved. Dionysos' followers are Pan, Seilenos and the half-Greek Priapos (equa ted with the Anatolian god of corn and wine). There seems little or no evidence, however, for the view that ?sublimated desire caused the Greeks, and others in the ancient world to interpret deity as a god dess? (22). Nor is the anthropomorphic nature of Greek religion solely the result of ?sublimated ambition? (23). Wine was extensively known in the heroic age as numerous references in the Iliad and Odyssey show (32 if). In par ticular Iliad 18 gives a commentary on the life which the civilised Mycenaean Greeks led. Wine has a variety of uses, for liba tions, as an aperitif, or as a drink with meals. Its effect, however, is not always to produce happiness and the reader is re minded of the fate of the Cyclops (Odyssey 9) and of the subject of the tondo of the cup by Brygos (Pfuhl, 'Masterpie ces of Greek Drawing and Painting', 1955, 54). The earliest mention of the name Diony sos occurs on a linear B fragment from Pylos and Seltman considers the possi bility that he was already a god of wine by that time (50). It is perhaps not irrele vant to point out that Ventris and Chad wick, in their comment on the name (which appears in the genitive case di-wo-nu-so jo), stated that ?there is no evidence to prove that it is divine? (Documents in Mycenaean Greek, 127). But although Dionysos, described as the thirteenth god, played a small part in Homeric epic, he accumulated a fantastic repertoire of myth (cf. Graves, 'Greek Myths' 1, 103 ff). For the Classical period Euripides' 'Bacchae' is summarised and the evidence used to illustrate Dionysos' power. By the time of the Parthenon (432 B. C.) Dionysos was an Olympian and Hestia had retired so that the Greek pantheon might keep its canonical complement. In chapter 5, entitled 'Vintage', the reader is introduced to what is, perhaps, the central part of the book. Again some of the material is not new although cross references do not always make this clear (cf. History Today, 5,12, 860-861 and 865 866). The method of wine production is described and illustrated from scenes on Black-figured vases. The author shows how some indication of the nature of Greek wine may be obtained in the absence of any direct evidence. Some wines were clearly heavy and this necessitated their dilution in the proportion of three parts of water to one of wine. The story also of Timaeus of Tauromenium is significant (92). Much of the chapter (73-78) is devo ted to a reprint of Henderson's account of ancient Greek wines. Many Greek vases were made ?for the complex ceremonials of drinking at the banquets of aristocrats, or for the simple use of less opulent wine-lovers? (82). There were two main categories (a) vases used in the preparation, or serving, of wine and (b) cups and beakers: examples are described and illustrated by figures (after Richter and Milne, 'Shapes and Names of Athenian Vases'). Although utilitarian in purpose the vases carry scenes from every day life and are a valuable and interesting source of information about the Greeks. Inevitably, one feels, two further chap ters are entitled Wine, Women . . . (95 ff) . . . and Song (noff). Certain of the author's views were made clear in his 'Women in Antiquity' but in the present book the drinking habits of Greek women are examined. The substance of the chap ter is directly derived from an earlier essay (History Today, 1, 9, 17-21) which served also as the basis of the account of Dionysos in 'The Twelve Olympians' and was subsequently republished in 'Riot at Ephesus'. Songs, or 'skolia', are of many kinds - political, patriotic, drinking, or amorous. A selection is given in transla tion particular attention being drawn to one of the most famous the 'Harmodios' described as the 'National Anthem of the Athenians' (116). The Trade (chapter 9) is based on the essay already mentioned: to this has been added a map of Southern Italy and Sicily and a list of the coin types of wine-produc ing states in Western Greek regions (140).</page><page sequence="3">i66 Gnomon i960 An interesting attempt is made to assess the price of wine in terms of the hire of an unskilled labourer and it appears that this commodity has always been inexpensive in the Mediterranean and Aegean areas. Seltman next comments on the taste of the Etruscans and of the Romans - one questions the judgement that the Etrus cans were none the worse for their licence (142)-and this forms a transition to the subject matter of the last two short chapters (10 and 11). In 186 B. C. the Romans had a specta cular encounter with the Greek Dionysos Bacchos which led to the famous senatorial decree 'de Bacchanalibus'. The description of events is taken directly from Livy 39 and, apart from this compact episode, the author treats the whole subject of Roman wine in a rather haphazard manner. There were three main types, Caecubum, Falernum and Albanum in addition to many lesser varieties. As Italian wines generally declined in quality those from Gaul increased in reputation. Excerpts from Petronius' 'Satyricon' provide the evidence for a striking contrast between Roman and Greek banquets (chapter 11). The 'Cena Trimalchionis' reflects a totally different mode of life and cultural atmo sphere. The final chapter, which could, with advantage, have been omitted, begins with a deceptively promising question ?how much of the ancient world - and especially of the ancient Greek world - still survives ? ? (the author, it should be noted, refers to the element of religious emotion). Some personal experiences in pre-war Greece are related: there is an alleged encounter with a Satyr (179 f) and a little-boy Pan (i8of). The account can hardly fail to remind one of a more famous traveller! There is a useful, short bibliography (183 f) and a comprehensive index (185 to 196). Misprints are of a minor nature and not likely to mislead. The present account admittedly repub lishes some material available elsewhere but has one merit, at least, namely that it has brought together most of the author's views on 'Wine' within the convenient com pass of one volume. It is entertainingly written with a light touch. Manchester John F. Healy</page></plain_text>
