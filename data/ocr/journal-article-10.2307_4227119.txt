<plain_text><page sequence="1">J JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Vol. XXX No. 4 December 1996 Holism and Collectivism in the Work of J. R. Commons Clive Lawson Recent years have witnessed a considerable resurgence of interest in institutional economics, much of which has been generated by contributions going under the heading of "new institutional economics."1 Although it is difficult to impose any precise programmatic unity upon these contributions [Coates 1986; Maki 1987], it is certainly possible to discern various important commonalities. Most significantly, as other commentators have already pointed out [e.g., Hodgson 1989; Rutherford 1989, 1994], new institutionalist writers share an adherence to some form of indi- vidualism. That being the case, however, it warrants emphasis that the precise form of the individualism at work in new institutionalist contributions is rarely spelled out. Rather, the usual strategy is to distinguish and criticize positions understood to be alternatives to individualism such as holism and collectivism. Of particular inter- est here is the fact that when examples of such supposedly untenable alternatives to individualism are cited, the work of J. R. Commons is frequently referred to. Com- mons's work is referred to because it is held to exemplify certain errors that are to be transcended. Thus, although new institutionalists often incorporate or express sympathy toward some of Commons's specific ideas (an obvious example being Williamson's [1975; 1985] use of the "transaction" as the basic unit of analysis), their main objective is to define their own general methods and concerns as being in direct opposition to those of Commons. The purpose of this paper is basically twofold. First, I want to argue that the new institutionalist contributions misrepresent Commons's actual writings. That is, they tend to set up a "straw-person" interpretation of Commons.2 Second, I wish to offer some explanation of the identified misrepresentations. More specifically, in the The author is Research Fellow of the Centre for Business Research, Department of Applied Economics, University of Cambridge, and Fellow of Girton College, Cambridge.

I then identify those aspects of Commons's writings that appear most to encourage the critical interpretations noted, especially Commons's use of concepts such as the "collective will," and draw out the disparities between interpre- tations of Commons's work and his actual writings. Last, some attempt is made to account for these disparities by focusing on underlying perspectives or, more pre- cisely, on ontological presuppositions that have been largely ignored in the relevant literature. Here, I use the interwar work of Hayek to support and illustrate the argu- ment that the sorts of mischaracterizations made of Commons's position indicate a problem that is internal to individualist positions in general. Commons's Critics One especially revealing criticism of Commons's work is provided by Olson [1965]. Although writing before the emergence of the new institutionalism, Olson has been very influential upon new institutionalist writers and, I suggest, shares their intentions in referring to Commons's work. Olson attempts to defend the ideas he puts forward concerning collective action. In particular, Olson objects to the view that: groups of individuals with common interests are expected to act on behalf of their common interests much as single individuals are often expected to act on behalf of their personal interests [Olson 1965, 1]. It is in discussing adherents to this view that Olson refers to the work of Commons. Specifically, Olson outlines and critiques various theories of pressure groups (in- cluding that of Commons), referring to the commonalities in these as "analytical pluralism." What is distinctive (but inadequate) about analytical pluralism, Olson claims, is that it cannot (or does not attempt to) show why the individual member of a large group will voluntarily support the group goal or act in the collective interest "when his support will be decisive in achieving the goal and when he would be as likely to get the benefits of the goal whether he contributes to its attainment or not " [Olson 1965, 1]. This criticism, Olson argues, can be made of Commons's often cited idea that pressure groups' lobbies are more representative than the territorially elected congress. Olson argues that although there may indeed be advantages to hav- ing a parliament elected by economic groups, the problem with the argument is its presupposition that groups simply act in their own interests. In his own work, Olson focuses upon the incentives for individuals to free-ride and the consequent problems of securing collective action (especially in large groups) even when there exists a collective interest. For Olson, this line of reasoning "destroys [Commons's] corpo- ratist idea that occupational groups naturally tend to form corporate organizations</page><page sequence="3">Holism and Collectivism in the Work of J. R. Commons 969 because of some spontaneous unity within them" [Olson 1965, 129]. Olson's claim, put differently, is that Commons's work neglects the issue of how institutional or group phenomena occur. Rather, it appears to suppose some natural, non-analyzable unity or coherence allowing the group to be treated in explanatory analyses in much the same way as is the individual. Olson's proposed alternative to this apparently untenable position is that collective, group, or holistic phenomena are to be some- how "built up" from statements about individuals. More recently, Schotter [1986] makes criticisms of Commons that, although ex- pressed differently, are clearly related to those of Olson. Schotter's starting point is Menger's distinction between "organic" and "pragmatic" institutions. For Menger, an organic institution is one that was not planned, but has developed out of, or as an unintended consequence of, agents pursuing their own purposes or plans. A prag- matic institution, in contrast, is simply designed to be as it is-an institution that re- flects the planner's intentions. For Menger, the former is the main concern of the social scientist, the aim being to explain how: institutions which serve the common welfare and are extremely significant for its development came into being without a common will directed towards establishing them [Menger 1985, 147]. If Schotter associates Menger with the organic conception, it is Commons who is saddled with the pragmatic, or "collectivist," alternative: there have been, historically, two distinct interpretations of the rise of social institutions in economics. One explanation, put forward [by] John Commons . . . may be called the "collectivist" explanation. The other explanation, given [by] Carl Menger . . . may be termed the "organic" theory [Schotter 1986, 3]. Schotter continues: "The difference between these two approaches is simple. Com- mons saw social institutions as the expression of the conscious collective action of rational economic agents." For Schotter, Commons's concern with the outcomes of (what Menger terms) the "common will" is viewed as acting as some kind of under- lying principle: "For Commons . . . the universal principle behind institutional be- haviour is the collective and purposeful action enforcing it" [Schotter 1986, 3]. Although left undeveloped in Schotter's work, the implication once more is that Commons conceives of a level of analysis (the collective) that need not be built up from, or related back to, individuals. These issues are more thoroughly discussed by Langlois [1989]. In this contribution, Langlois singles out those aspects of the old institutionalism that he believes contain the most serious problems (are most in con- tradiction with the new institutionalism), notably methodological holism, using Commons's work as his exemplar. Langlois first explains that what is distinctive about the form of holism he wishes to criticise is not the view that "theory must deal with various societies and collectives 'as a whole"' [1989, 285]. Here Langlois is</page><page sequence="4">970 Clive Lawson drawing upon the earlier work of Agassi [1975] and his conception of "institutional individualism," claiming that the concerns [of the holist] come into conflict with the individualist only when one makes the further assertion that "if 'wholes' exist then they have distinct aims and purposes of their own" [Agassi 1975, 147]. That is to say what is distinctive about holism is only the claim that wholes are a sufficient level of analysis-that one need not build up wholes from individuals and refer back to individuals-and that such wholes possess human-like properties of intention and motivation [Langlois 1989, 285]. Thus, Langlois is not attempting to argue against such claims as "society is more than the sum of its parts" or "society affects the individual's aims" or that "the so- cial set up influences or constrains the individual's behaviour" [see Agassi 1975, 145]. Rather, he is rejecting the supposition, attributed to Commons and others, that wholes have intentions and motivations and, as such, constitute a sufficient level of analysis. It seems that the fundamental issue here, at least for those such as Langlois and Agassi, is that social explanation can only be in terms of entities with inten- tions, purposes, etc. Any meaningful debate then turns on what sort of entities have intentions and purposes. The individualist inclination to "build-up" all social phe- nomena from statements in terms of individuals can be undermined on this view only if viable alternative conceptions of intentional agencies can be sustained. In this light, the new institutionalism seeks to distinguish itself by its contention that wholes do not have intentions and purposes. The counter-view, that wholes have intentions, is attributed to the old institutionalists in general and Commons in particular. First, Langlois quotes Gruchy's characterization of Commons's general position as one where the "dynamic and purposive qualities of an economic system are empha- sised," where "individual wills are congealed into a form of collective voliciency or will to action" [Gruchy 1972, 41]. In truth, Langlois is ultimately ambiguous about whether this "congealing into a form of collective voliciency" implies that Com- mons is a holist in the strong (Agassi) sense. But he clearly feels that Commons adopts a position that is very much related to it. To clarify his position, Langlois, like Schotter, invokes Menger's distinction between organic and pragmatic institu- tions. Commons is then criticized for "preferring to blur [not make] the distinction" between organic and pragmatic institutions, or more accurately, he is criticized be- cause he focuses almost exclusively upon the latter: the weakness of Commons' approach is arguably that he tended to see most- if not all-institutions as pragmatic rather than organic. The real debate is about the proper domain of "pragmatic" explanations. And to misread a com- plex organic institution as pragmatic is effectively to engage in an undesir- able sort of holism [Langlois 1989, 287].</page><page sequence="5">Holism and Collectivism in the Work of J. R. Commons 971 Thus, what is undesirable about holism, as Langlois sees it, is the idea that institu- tions can be explained simply in terms of the reasons for planning or designing them. Now the propositions that wholes have intentions and purposes (the claim that distinguishes holism in Langlois and Agassi's accounts) and the proposition that in- stitutions arise because of, and can be explained by reference to, intentions or pur- poses (particular plans) on the part of some (sets of) individuals (the specific criticism that Langlois ends up making) are clearly not the same. And it is not clear whether Langlois attributes both claims to Commons. However, what is common to both, and clearly is attributed to Commons, is the idea that the "whole" is a suffi- cient level of analysis, i.e., it constitutes a level of investigation of its own. Whether it is being argued that wholes have intentions or whether the functioning of some whole simply reflects some particular intention or plan, no disaggregation is neces- sary-explanation can be exclusively couched at the level of the whole. There are important similarities then between the interpretations of Commons noted above. Although the explicit target for criticism is different in each case (for Olson, it is "some corporatist idea"; for Schotter, it is collectivism; and for Lan- glois, it is holism), what is common to all three is a concern to criticize the idea that aggregates of individuals, whether defined as wholes, collectives, groups, etc., con- stitute a distinct level of analysis. In making this criticism, each writer attempts to gain distance from old institutionalist writings in general, and those of Commons in particular, as part of a move to defend their own methods and concerns. The first point I want to investigate is the accuracy of the various interpretations of Com- mons. Although a comprehensive account of his position would be impossible here, it is feasible to outline those concepts developed by Commons that appear most to encourage the characterizations noted. In particular, I refer to Commons's various concepts and ideas that relate to his notion of the group. Commons, Groups, and the "Collective Will" In order to express his ideas about groups, Commons utilizes and refines the concept of the "going concern"--a notion (characteristically) taken over from the courts. Moreover, this concept is elaborated in a number of different ways and is certainly nowhere defined in an abstract or neat manner. More specifically, Com- mons develops his ideas about the going concern in relation to three major themes, namely, collective action, the transaction, and artificial selection. These are consid- ered briefly in turn. For Commons, the distinction between collective action and individual action lies at the very heart of social explanation. Part of what he is attempting to capture by the notion of collective action is simply the idea that individuals are constrained and enabled by the formal or informal rules and relationships that they encounter in their pursuit of earning a living. This accounts for Commons's often quoted defini-</page><page sequence="6">972 Clive Lawson tion of an institution as "collective action in control, liberation and expansion of in- dividual action " [Commons 1990, 73]- in virtue of the social position occupied, and the particular nature of the working rules that define such positions, some ac- tions are prevented and some are made possible, some of which are possible only because constraints are placed on others. Thus, working rules: say what each member of the concern may, can, cannot and must or must not do, in so far as the combined power of the concern is deemed to cover his conduct. They give the individual power (right) to act as representing the concern; they give him liberty to act in that the concern will prevent others from interfering. They limit his power to act for the concern by exposing him beyond that limit to damages that the concern disregards, and they re- quire him to not act in certain directions of the sanction of a penalty (duty) if he disregards the rule [Commons 1924, 1481. Of course, those features that restrain or enable action can be unorganized or organ- ized, more or less enduring, etc. As Rutherford [1983] notes, one of the ways that Commons conceives of a going concern is simply as "an organised form of collec- tive action . . . within this category he places the state, political parties, courts, un- ions, firms, churches and the like." Alternatively, Commons defines a going concern as a "succession of transac- tions" [1990, 620]. The concept of a transaction, like that of collective action, is central to Commons's whole system of thought. Indeed, Commons usually refers to the transaction as the "fundamental unit of analysis" [Commons 1990, 58; Ruther- ford 1990, xxv]. Commons is predominantly concerned with the exchange of prop- erty (and property rights) and the institutional framework of rights, duties, sanctioning mechanisms, etc., that facilitate it. Once Commons distinguishes the different types of transactions (i.e., the bargaining, managerial, and rationing trans- actions), it is clear that the transaction is the concept used by Commons to convey the essential relationships between those taking part in exchange [Commons 1990, 59-69; see also Lawson 1994]. Thus, to view the going concern as a succession of transactions is to view it as constituted by relationships. Indeed, Commons argues that it is necessary to view the going concern as constituted by sets of relationships in order to transcend other (faulty) conceptions of the group that he terms "passive or static" conceptions [Commons 1990, 69]. Typically these conceptions involve either an atomic notion of aggregated individuals or of society as a single "unit" of investigation [Commons 1970, 188]. Commons attempts to elaborate his alternative "active and dynamic" conception via the use of various metaphors, drawing atten- tion to similarities and differences: the going concern is itself . . . analogous to that which, in biology, is Fil- mer s "organism," or in physics is Locke's "mechanism." But its compo-</page><page sequence="7">Holism and Collectivism in the Work of J. R. Commons 973 nents are not living cells, nor electrons, nor atoms-they are Transactions [Commons 1990, 58-59]. The similarity to a mechanism is that a going concern will typically continue even though its parts "come and go," much as, say, a car when its parts are replaced [Commons 1970, 341. It is similar to an organism (in Whitehead's sense) in that it can adapt to changing circumstances and has parts that are interconnected such that they could not exist, or be what they essentially are, but for their relation to other parts (i.e., they consist in internal relations). What distinguishes the going concern from the organism (and the mechanism) is the mode of existence of the former and the role of human intentions and purposes in the processes in which replacement or adaption occur. These ideas are most fully articulated by Commons in his discus- sions of the evolution of going concerns as a process of artificial selection. This process: is "artificial" simply because it is Purpose, Futurity, Planning, injected into greatly controlling the struggle for life. Darwin admitted that his term "natu- ral selection" was a misnomer, and regretted his resort to metaphor. It is more properly blind selection, while the artificial kind is purposeful selec- tion. Natural selection, which is natural survival of the "fit," produces wolves, snakes, poisons, destructive microbes; but artificial selection con- verts wolves into dogs, natures poisons into medicines, eliminates the wicked microbes, and multiplies the good microbes. A Holstein cow could not sur- vive if left to natural selection-she is a monstrosity created by artificial selec- tion for the sake of the good she can do for man in the future [Commons 1990, 636]. Now, passages such as that above are often used by critics as evidence that Com- mons is preoccupied with the merits of human intervention [especially see Seckler 1975]. However, on closer inspection, it is apparent that the significance of the above is the attempt to combine two central features of Commons's ideas: his trans- formational and volitional conception of institutional change. These points are elaborated in turn. The Transformational Element in Artificial Selection The first point to note is that dogs, medicines, and Holstein cows are not created by human design, only that these would not take the form that they do but for the in- tervention of the breeder, chemist, etc. Breeders do not create cows-cows exist due to (perhaps purely) natural selection, i.e., artificial selection is still selection and not construction. What the breeder does is to select "good" mutations or strains of cow and intervene to have some effect upon the conditions for reproduction of such fea- tures. In other words, existing breeds or materials are actively (intentionally) trans-</page><page sequence="8">974 Clive Lawson formed rather than created. In applying the idea of artificial selection to going con- cerns, working rules, which define the nature of the relationships that constitute go- ing concerns, are the result of human intentions and purposes without ever being the creation of them.4 The working rules that exist can only be seen to result from the skilled activities of human agents with intentions and purposes (even though the out- comes may be unintended), not the inevitable, purely mechanical result of some an- tecedent state. At the same time, individuals as citizens, negotiators, officials, etc., must continually draw upon, and in so doing necessarily help reproduce, some set of working rules in order to change others. That is, they must compromise and fulfill obligations and duties (definitive of their positions and capabilities) in order to pur- sue their own aims, etc. Moreover, it is in focusing upon working rules in this way that it becomes clear that the conceptions of a going concern as an incidence of col- lective action and as a succession of transactions are really the same, elaborated from different starting points. Working rules will tend to come into existence through various means but must be reproduced (often tacitly) through the (trans-) actions of agents in positions. Once in existence, they define the positions in which agents act in terms of rights and duties (i.e., the types of collective action that are possible) and thus provide the focus of attention when conflicts of interest occur. At this stage, various working rules will be (discursively) selected for (or against) by representatives in various positions reproducing some rules in order to transform others. The Volitional Element in Artificial Selection To return to the breeder analogy, the main distinguishing feature of artificial, rather than natural, selection is the presence of the breeder's purposes and inten- tions. In translating the analogy to the social world, the immediate problem is that there is no clear analogue to the breeder. Commons often talks of a "lawgiver" (or perhaps more accurately a law finder-see Ramstad [1990]), especially in his discus- sion of the courts. But the situations with which Commons is most concerned con- tain representatives of various groups, as well as arbitrators or sanctioning author- ities, and to translate the breeder analogy involves taking into account the intentions and purposes of all of these. It is in this regard that Commons develops the notion of the "collective will." Talk of collective voliciency or will tends to encourage the sorts of criticisms noted above. However, as should become clear, there is no no- tion of reified purpose or intention external to individuals in Commons's work. In elaborating these ideas, Commons further breaks down his ideas into those of the "institutionalized mind" and of the "public purpose." When Commons uses the concept of the institutionalized mind, he is presuppos- ing a conception of individuals that is explicitly in opposition to the "globules of de-</page><page sequence="9">Holism and Collectivism in the Work of J. R. Commons 975 sire"-a conception that Veblen famously identifies in orthodox, non-institutionalist conceptions. Instead, for Commons, individuals are prepared more or less by habit, induced by the pressure of custom, to engage in those highly artificial transactions created by the collective human will . . . . found where conflict, interdependence, and order among human beings are preliminary to getting a living [Commons 1990, 74]. Given this conception of the human agent, the institutionalized mind is an attempt to capture, at a quite general level, the socialization of individuals through their re- peated participation in the transactions of social life. Socialization is understood here to be vital in both allowing capable action to occur at all and in so doing ac- counting for "order" within some concern: the mind becomes institutionally habituated to the dominant ways of doing things in the concem ... if it were not so, as is well known, the mind could not have a free field for dealing with what is unexpected [Commons 1990, 6981. Moreover, through this process of socialization individuals voluntarily come to be- have in a "mutually consistent, or orderly fashion" [Commons 1990, 45].6 How- ever, socialization does not determine the purposes or intentions of particular agents. This is significant in that, for Commons, it is conflict (rather than harmony or abundance) that is fundamental- any order that exists is actively secured by agents acting to resolve disputes and seek compromises between conflicting transac- tors with conflicting purposes. It is in this regard, or more generally to understand how such intentions and purposes interpenetrate, that the notion of the "public pur- pose" is developed. This concept involves two essentially distinct processes that are centered around the notion of sovereignty in the transaction. The first process is that in which the intentions and purposes of the authoritative or sanctioning group effects those of the transactors; the second is where the desires, purposes, etc., of the trans- actors have some effect upon the working rules, and so the constitution, of the rul- ing authority. In transacting, agents enter into a relationship with sovereignty (the state, fac- tory owner, etc.), which ultimately sanctions the agreed terms of the transaction [see especially Chasse 1986]. On the one hand, the working rules that are of rele- vance to the transactors must at least be compatible with, or tolerated by, the ruling authorities. When conflicts arise and are settled by the transactors or their repre- sentatives, the purposes, desires, etc., of the transactors not only must be (become) compatible with each other to find a settlement, but must be at least tolerated by the sovereign agency. Sovereignty, in some form, given its crucial role in sanctioning the terms of a transaction, judges some purposes, desires, etc., good and others bad. Those judged "good" are referred to by Commons as public purposes. Such pur- poses then become the basis for what is considered to be legitimate, fair, natural,</page><page sequence="10">976 Clive Lawson right, etc., in the ensuing negotiations and disputes between transactors. On the other hand, however, the transacting individuals can act together, perhaps "with- holding from the sovereign power what it wants but cannot command" and in so do- ing can force adjustment to the working rules that determine the powers of the sovereign concern. In this way, the public purpose is always being broadened to in- clude interests, desires, etc., of more concerns as they discover and struggle to se- cure "fair" or "reasonable" agreements at a multitude of different "transactional" levels. There is, then, no notion of a "will" pertaining simply to a group that is external to individuals. Instead, "individual wills" are always constrained and enabled by so- cial circumstances. Commons develops his concept of a collective will as institution- alized mind and as public purpose in an endeavor both to describe the actual processes by which agents' intentions and purposes, through transacting, form and interpenetrate and to develop a system of concepts suitable for discussing and ena- bling intervention in such processes. Commons's ideas about intervention are also relevant here as they involve an- other notion of "purpose," which critics have found objectionable. More specifi- cally, the processes referred to above in which officials or representatives select "good" rules in favor of "bad" ones exemplify for Commons the practices that economists should follow. Commons stressed that no fixed set of criteria for select- ing some working rules over others were brought to such situations. Instead: a volitional or economic theory starts with the purpose for which the artifi- cial mechanism in question was designed, fashioned and remodelled, and in- quires, first, whether that purpose is useful or useless, legitimate, ethical or unethical, right or wrong. Then it inquires whether the artificial mechanism in question accomplishes that purpose in an efficient or economical way, and, if not, what is the limiting factor, out of the thousands of cooperating factors, that obstructs the operation, and to what extent that limiting factor can be, and requires to be, controlled in order to facilitate the mechanism and accomplish its purpose [Commons 1924, 377]. However, the idea that all "theory starts with a purpose" needs to be qualified here. Commons clearly believes his own analytical starting point to be the existence of scarcity [see Lawson 1994]. The point Commons is making here is that any form of practical intervention on the part of economists must begin with an investigation of the purposes that some institutional feature is supposed to have. Commons, contrary to the usual inferences, vehemently objected to the idea of designed institutions [Ramstad 1990]. If such design is out of the question, Commons believes, social theorists may only contribute to or mimic the role of the officials selecting "good" from "bad" working rules7-with such selection of course having to start somewhere. What distinguishes situations of dispute is that the conflicting parties constantly go through a process of reflecting upon their circumstances, making discursive what</page><page sequence="11">Holism and Collectivism in the Work of J. R. Commons 977 was previously tacit, "reducing the custom to precision" [1990, 75]. Thus, although the situation relevant to some dispute may be complex, consisting in "all manner of interconnection," the conceptions that agents have, and in particular the conceptions they have of the purposes that existing institutional forms may serve, appear, to Commons at least, to be an obvious point of entry.8 To take stock, groups or wholes are nowhere conceived by Commons to consti- tute a sufficient level of analysis. In fact, Commons is not really concerned with groups at all and is certainly at pains to avoid the ideas of "atomic aggregates" or "single units." Instead, Commons focuses upon the social relationships that consti- tute such groups. What is more, Commons does not conceive of such relationships as reified or external to individuals. Instead, in elaborating his ideas about institu- tional change (artificial selection), Commons develops, on the one hand, a transfor- mational conception whereby relations are reproduced through the transacting activity of agents and, on the other hand, a framework of concepts in which pur- poses and intentions appear not as some reified "will" outside of, or foreign to, indi- viduals, but just as the purposes of individual agents that (1) depend upon their social (transactional) position, (2) interpenetrate with other transactors, and (3) act as important points of entry for practical research. No explicit defense has been pro- vided here either of Commons's conceptualizations of groups, institutions, etc., or of his understanding of the nature of social research. The aim has been simply to in- dicate that Commons's work does not constitute an example of the kind of holism and/or collectivism of the sort that is usually attributed to him, i.e., which depends ultimately upon a conception of groups or wholes as constituting a sufficient level of analysis. Given all this, an obvious question to ask is why is it that the criticisms reported in the previous section are so prominent? In response, it is tempting to attribute this state of affairs either to an overly casual reading of Commons's work by his critics or (as many sympathizers suggest-e.g., Ramstad [1986] and Rutherford [1983]) to Commons's own poor style of presentation. However, while both of these factors may contribute to the problem, it seems unlikely that they can fully explain it since the particular criticisms detailed above of Commons's work, i.e., the interpretation of it as attributing intentions and purposes to wholes, are also found in prominent contributions by individualists throughout social science whoever's work is being discussed.9 Indeed, I will argue that the misinterpretations of Commons noted above actually stem from a failure or limitation of the individualist position itself. Making Sense of the Misinterpretations of Commons The argument I wish to make here is that although the rhetoric of social struc- ture, relationships and rules, etc., is sometimes deployed, the reality of such entities is never really or adequately accepted by individualists- at the end of the day, the</page><page sequence="12">978 Clive Lawson only sort of entities considered to be real are individuals or groups of individuals. In consequence, if economists such as Commons and other old institutionalists fail to adopt a methodological individualist framework, in which everything is explained in terms of individuals, then the only alternative recognized is to explain everything in terms of groups or collections of individuals. If this is perceived as the only alterna- tive, it is then easy enough to impute to the authors concerned a view that any such collectives have purposes or intentions especially when, as with Commons, they use terms such as "collective will" that are easily misconstrued. In this regard, the inter- war work of Hayek is of particular significance and can be usefully focused upon in order to support and illustrate this argument. Apart from anything else, Hayek's work carries the advantage that it is particularly explicit and clear on these matters. But in addition, Hayek's work has been particularly influential upon new institution- alists' work10-drawing too upon the work of Menger (and perhaps more consis- tently so)-and, at the same time, has enjoyed the respect of individualists throughout social science [see especially Langlois 1989, 285]. As should be clear from the above, for Commons, social research is crucially concerned with rules, relations, customs, etc. For Hayek, however, to suppose that talk of such items as society, etc., refers to real structures is to commit what he calls the fallacy of "conceptual realism": The naive realism which uncritically assumes that where there are commonly used concepts there must also be definite "given" things which they describe is so deeply embedded in current thought about social phenomena that it re- quires a deliberate effort of will to free ourselves from it. While most people will readily admit that in this field there may exist special difficulties in rec- ognizing definite wholes because we have never many specimens of a kind before us and therefore cannot readily distinguish their constant from their merely accidental attributes, few are aware that there is a much more funda- mental obstacle: that the wholes as such are never given to our observation but are without exception constructions of our mind [Hayek 1979, 96]. And the reason that non-individualists fail to realize that wholes are merely con- structions, according to Hayek, is that the only alternative to accepting methodologi- cal individualism is to postulate something like a supermind in the image of the individual mind: The mistake of treating as definite objects wholes that are no more than con- structions, and that can have no properties except those which follow from the way in which we have constructed them from the elements, has probably appeared most frequently in the form of the various theories about a "social" or "collective" mind and has in this connection raised all sorts of pseudo- problems. The same idea is frequently but imperfectly concealed under the attributes of personality or individuality which are ascribed to society. What-</page><page sequence="13">Holism and Collectivism in the Work of J. R. Commons 979 ever the name, these terms always mean that, instead of reconstructing the wholes from the relations between individual minds which we directly know, a vaguely apprehended whole is treated as something akin to the individual mind. It is in this form that in the social sciences an illegitimate use of an- thropomorphic concepts has had as harmful an effect as the use of such con- cepts in the natural sciences. The remarkable thing here is, again, that it should so frequently be the empiricism of the positivists, the archenemies of any anthropomorphic concepts even when they are in place, which leads them to postulate such metaphysical entities and to treat humanity, as for in- stance Comte does, as one "social being," a kind of superperson. But as there is no other possibility than either to compose the whole from the indi- vidual minds or to postulate a supermind in the image of the individual mind, and as positivists reject the first of these alternatives, they are necessarily driven to the second [1979, 100-102]. Now I do not want to suggest that Langlois et al. set out this position identically to, or as explicitly as, Hayek. But it amounts to the same thing. Thus, we find Lan- glois, for example, talking, as Hayek does, of the need to build up wholes from in- dividuals. This only applies if there are but individuals and wholes. I am claiming that there is, and that Commons recognizes that there is, a realm of social reality other than individuals and groups. It consists of items such as social relationships and rules and customs, etc. On this conception, social structure is as much a condi- tion for human action as it is a consequence. Thus, there can be no question of building up anything from individuals or individual actions alone. Actions can be explained in terms of structure and vice versa. The nature of the explanans will de- pend on what really produced the explanandum. However, on closer inspection, as with Langlois's contribution, Hayek is mak- ing two separate criticisms of non-individualists. Specifically, Hayek also interprets non-individualists as preoccupied with pragmatic (in Menger's sense) institutions, i.e., not only are non-individualists attributed with the view that wholes exist and have purposes, but also that all institutional outcomes simply reflect the designs of some individual or group of individuals. Now, in most accounts that draw upon Menger's distinction between organic and pragmatic institutions, any preoccupation with the latter is regarded as unimpressive or inferior.11 For Hayek, however, such a preoccupation is simply a mistake: a "pragmatic" interpretation of social institutions [is one] which treats all so- cial structures which serve human purposes as the result of deliberate design and which denies the possibility of an orderly or purposeful arrangement in anything which is not thus constructed [1979, 141-2]. This mistake results, in Hayek's view, from the "inability . . . to grasp how the in- dependent action of many men can produce coherent wholes" [1979, 141]. Pre-</page><page sequence="14">980 Clive Lawson sented in this way, it is clear that the existence and significance of unintended con- sequences of action are of central importance here. However, as can be seen from the previous section, Commons, at least, does not deny or ignore the possibility of unintended consequences [see especially Commons 1990, 163; Biddle 1990]. For Commons, institutional forms, such as rules, will come into being for various rea- sons, but once in existence they may (especially in times of conflict) become the ob- jects for investigation and attempted change. In the process of such change, as noted in the previous section, the purposes or intentions of the sides in the dispute do have effects upon the forms of the resulting institutional arrangements and may indeed, under certain circumstances, simply reflect one individual's intentions. But if this is so, this is not to do with some researchers' inability to "grasp how the independent action of many men can produce coherent wholes." Rather it stems from the real ex- istence of individuals' powers and capabilities to so influence outcomes given their particular social position or, in Commons's terms, the nature of the relationships in which the transactors stand. Now of course, if there are in reality no such relation- ships, no such positions, etc., then it is easy to see how there could be simply the two alternatives Hayek describes. Additionally, it is easy to see how unintended consequences acquire the significance afforded by those such as Hayek. Again, the issues revolve around the status and nature of elements of (Commons's) social on- tology such as social relationships. But how do we establish that items such as social relationships are real? Science employs not only a perceptual, but also a causal criterion for ascribing reality to ob- jects. It is because gravity and magnetic fields affect or make a difference to other observable objects or individuals that we can assert their reality. The same, of course, is true of social structures. They make a difference to observable activities that can and do occur. Consider Commons again: The business man who declines to use the banking system which has grown up in the past, the laborer who refuses to come to work when others come, may be industrious, but he cannot live in industrial society. This is familiar enough and therefore not investigated. But when customs change, or when judges and arbitrators enforce a custom by deciding a dispute, or when labor- ers or farmers strike in order to modify a custom of business, or when a revolution confiscates slaves or other property of capitalists, or when a stat- ute prohibits a customary mode of living, or when a holding company ex- tends an old custom into new fields-then it is realized that the compulsion of custom has been there all along, but unquestioned and undisturbed [Com- mons 1990, 701]. Social structures then are real; their ability to make a difference, to constrain, and to enable establishes this. Of course, social structures are different from natural structures in that they depend upon human agency. Thus, any longevity of social structure, as well as change in them, depends on human doings. Social structure, in</page><page sequence="15">Holism and Collectivism in the Work of J. R. Commons 981 short, is both condition and consequence of action, and social reproduction or trans- formation is always accomplished through some human doings, albeit ones wherein social reproduction and change is an unintended consequence. Much of Commons's writing (e.g., on the "transaction") is an attempt to indicate how definite structures endure and change and how human intentions and purposes influence such proc- esses. This will be a mystery for individualists who, ultimately, do not accept the reality of structures. From this perspective, any such endeavors by Commons and others (to show how structures are reproduced, how they relate to individual agency) must then be some or other manifestation of the naive presence of methodo- logical holism-of supposing that explanations, if not couched in terms of individu- als, must be couched in terms of groups or aggregates instead. Conclusion The work of J. R. Commons has acquired an important position in relation to re- cent writings in institutionalist economics. In this paper, I have focused upon the negative interpretations of Commons's work as some form of holism or collectiv- ism, interpretations that have then been used by recent writers to define and defend their own concerns and methods. On closer inspection, it can be seen that Com- mons's work is not a good example of the sort of conceptions of holism and collec- tivism that these writers have in mind and, more generally, bears little relation to these criticisms at all. However, the sorts of criticisms raised are not only promi- nent in the literature concerning Commons's work, but throughout the literature in which individualists consider alternative positions. Thus, in addition to identifying the quite clear discrepancies between these criticisms and Commons's actual writ- ings, some attempt has been made to explain them. The main argument put forward here has been that such misplaced criticisms follow from the limitations of the indi- vidualist position itself. In particular, they arise from the fact that, despite certain rhetoric to the contrary, much of Commons's social ontology cannot be consistently or adequately accommodated within the individualist position. Notes 1. Prominent examples include contributions on collective action [Olson 1965, 1982; Sandler 1992]; law [Posner,1973]; property rights [Coase 1937, 1960; Furubotn and Pejovich 1974]; economic history [North and Thomas 1973; North 1981]; theory of the firm [Al- chian and Demetz 1972; Williamson 1975, 1985; Aoki et al. 1990]; modern Austrian school [Kirzner 1981, especially as influenced by Hayek, e.g., 1948, 19671; game theoretic approaches [Schotter 1981, 1986; Sugden 1986]; and evolutionary approaches [Nelson and Winter 1982]. 2. It has been argued elsewhere, notably in Rutherford [1983; 1994], that Commons's posi- tion is not well captured by such notions of collectivism or holism. While the present pa-</page><page sequence="16">982 Clive Lawson per is largely in agreement with Rutherford's characterization of Commons's position, several differences follow from the focus upon social relations in the rest of this paper. In particular, Rutherford appears to accept a basic symmetry between individualism and ho- lism and so, like many other commentators, attempts to find a "reasonable third way" that incorporates the less extreme versions of each. However, a basic component of the follow- ing argument is that there is no such symmetry. First, any form of individualistic explana- tion seems to be, at best, quite arbitrary (for a development of this point in relation to the specific work of Vanberg, North, Langlois, and Csontos, see Lawson et al. [1996] and in relation to the work of Agassi, see Hodgson [1988]). Second, any form of holistic expla- nation remains contingent; it is a substantive issue whether or not some set of relations are internal or external, the former necessitating holistic explanation but not the latter. Third, it is the omission (or an inadequate conception) of social relations that leads to the idea that individualism and collectivism/holism (as attributed to Commons) are exhaustive alter- natives. 3. Internal relations exist where some entity would not be what it essentially is, or act in the way that it does, were it not for the relationship in which it stands to something else, i.e., the relationship is constitutive of the things related. 4. That Commons's ideas about evolution of working rules (within the transaction) can be viewed as an example of what more recently has become known as a Transformation Model of Social Activity is a point dealt with in some detail in Lawson [1994]. For other accounts sympathetic to this view, see Pratten [1994] and Atkinson and Reed [1992]. 5. It is important to note the limits to the metaphor here. In particular, Commons emphasizes that custom and working rules exist only in that they are reproduced through the trans-ac- tions of agents and do not exist independently of those actions in the way that Holstein cows exist independently of breeders [Commons 1924, 300]. 6. "Moreover, as mandated patterns are repeated again and again they gradually become so familiar as to be perceived by the individual as natural or right . . . in this fashion the indi- vidual comes willingly to acquiesce in-indeed, generally endorse accustomed to patterns" [Ramstad 1990, 67]. 7. It should be pointed out that, in reality, the role of the official is more complex than sim- ply that of the "selector" of working rules. This point is brought out if we consider Com- mons's ideas about legislatures. Here the role of the official is best understood by weaving together this idea of selecting working rules with the idea that officials are also constantly "seeking out" the strategic transactions among the routine transactions [see Lawson 1994]. However, inclusion of this more complex notion does not detract from the main points be- ing emphasized here, i.e., that, on the one hand, Commons works with a transformational conception of social activity and that, on the other, Commons's conception of purpose has nothing at all to do with the idea that wholes have purposes or aims of their own in the way that individuals do. 8. That such purposes constitute an important point of entry, especially in the face of an in- terconnected (or internally related) social world, is a point elaborated more fully else- where, e.g., in the pattern modeling literature (see especially Diesing's [1971] discussion of the participant observer method; and as applied specifically to Commons, see Ramstad [1986]). 9. Although there is not space to substantiate this argument here, I would also contend that these criticisms are no more true of apparent "arch-" holists or collectivists such as Marx or Durkheim. 10. Hodgson, in fact, uses Hayek as a prime example of new institutionalism along with Schotter and Williamson [Hodgson 1989]. 11. For Menger, the study of pragmatic institutions causes no "special difficulties" and does not "challenge the sagacity of the scholar unduly" [1985, 223], but they do exist and are legitimate objects for the (presumably non-theoretical) scientist. Vanberg has taken such</page><page sequence="17">Holism and Collectivism in the Work of J. R. Commons 983 comments to indicate that the organic and pragmatic "approaches" to the study of institu- tions may thus be complementary [Vanberg 1989]. References Agassi, J.
