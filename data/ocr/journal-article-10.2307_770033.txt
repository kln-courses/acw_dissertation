<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLIAM VALENTINE MAYNEORD 14 February 1902-10 August 1988 Elected ER.S. 1965 BY E W. SPIERS WILLIAM VALETINE MAYNEORD was born 14 February 1902, the last child of Walter and Elizabeth Mayneord, in Redditch, Worcestershire. Walter Mayneord, who worked first in a fishing-tackle factory in Redditch and later as agent for the Pearl Assurance Company, was clearly a man of many parts. As a youth he was an enthusiastic amateur runner, a very able chess player, playing for Worcestershire, and a well-known figure riding his bicycle aged over 80 and singing in the choir at 90, the year of his death. He was a devoted Gladstonian Liberal and a founder of the Liberal Club in Redditch. Walter and Elizabeth had two older children, Ewart and Gilbert. Ewart the eldest, though largely self-educated, had a great facility for languages and served as an interpreter on the Western Front in World War I. After the war he taught himself Russian and became foreign correspondent for a firm trading with Russia, which he visited on business. Unfortunately Ewart died from a brain tumour at about the age of 34. The other brother, Gilbert, was to some degree mentally deficient and worked as a labourer. But clearly, despite the meagre educational opportunities of the time, the Mayneord family had talent and ability: still earlier, grandfather William Mayneord had been a well-known local preacher. The family books also showed that they were surprisingly well read. Sadly, however, in 1905 when Val, as he was always known, was two and a half years old his mother died. He was then legally adopted by an aunt, his mother's sister, and her husband in Evesham and it was here that he lived for the rest of his childhood and adolescent life. His aunt 'Polly' and uncle William Watkins brought up Val with love and care as their own child in a most comfortable home, but he never lost touch with his Redditch family. Indeed that family had increased, for Walter Mayneord remarried in 1906 and there were four more children. Val's father, brothers and the new family knew of his life and activities, were proud of his successes and Val visited them throughout his life. Like many others in the small market town of Evesham, William Watkins was a fruit grower and market gardener, although formerly he had been in the army, the Worcestershire Volunteers, and had served and been wounded in the Boer War. Indeed it was said at one time that 'he was the only man in Evesham who had known powder and shot used in anger'; a distinction which, sadly, was not to last.</page><page sequence="2">Co L- /V)-)</page><page sequence="3">Biographical Memoirs Uncle William and Aunt Polly sent Val to the nearby St Mary's Roman Catholic school for his primary education, said by Val to have provided a sound scholastic foundation, and from there he gained a Worcestershire scholarship to Prince Henry's Grammar School at the age of 11 in 1913. His education there was not much more than ordinary, with the teaching staff so depleted by the needs of the forces in World War I, but he had a little 'science' and became interested in history, particularly that of Evesham, its former abbey and the last battle of Simon de Montfort, which took place just outside the town in 1265. From the Grammar School he won a Willis Bund school scholarship to the University of Birmingham. He also read widely at the public library in Evesham, including works by Dante, Milton and Williamson and, more particularly, taught himself the rudiments of calculus from the article in the Encyclopaedia Brittanica. At this point I should add that I knew Val when I was about 11 years old and we were both servers at All Saints Church, Evesham, although he was then soon to go to Birmingham. We were both greatly influenced at that time by the wise and erudite vicar of Evesham, the Reverend W.A. Walker, D.D., who worked tirelessly for the youths of his parish. Another common influence was the organist at All Saints Church, Mr A.M. Slatter, F.R.C.O., a man of musical talent beyond the expectations of a small country market town, who was also Val's piano teacher. One of my earliest recollections is of Val playing for me the last movement of Beethoven's sonata number 18, played as marked 'con fuoco', and I could recognize that here was not only talent, but a mind equal to the challenge of this sonata. In a very different context of youth, Val, like most of the young in Evesham at that time, lived close to the business of fruit growing and I can recall in later life comparing notes with him on the safe placing of a ladder in a fruit tree, for to do otherwise endangered limb and even life. Perhaps here were the beginnings of his concern for occupational hazards which, in another field, were to be an important part of his later work. Val went to the University of Birmingham in 1918 at the early age of 16 and lodged with a Quaker family who were at first a little unsure of taking him because he was so young. In the Evesham days he had formed a wish to become a scientist and hence read physics under Professor S.W.J. Smith, F.R.S., mathematics under Professor G.N. Watson, F.R.S., and chemistry, in which subject he gained the university prize and scholarship each year. He was a brilliant student who made a great impression on his mentors and fellow students at Birmingham alike. He graduated with honours in physics, in 1922, and went on to do postgraduate research with Professor Smith on the magnetism of annealed carbon steels (1)* for which he gained his M.Sc. in 1924. He left the Birmingham Department having had a very thorough education in the classical physics of the early part of this century and in mathematics and chemistry, but before the impact of modern physical theory and experiment had become manifest in undergraduate teaching. That was to come later. He was awarded his D.Sc. in 1933 on the basis of researches we shall consider later. * Numbers in this form refer to entries in bibliography on the accompanying microfiche. 344</page><page sequence="4">William Valentine Mayneord APPOINTMENT TO ST BARTHOLOMEW'S HOSPITAL In 1924 the still-young Val Mayneord took up an appointment as Demonstrator in Physics at the Medical School of Bart's Hospital under Professor F.L. Hopwood. This move was received unenthusiastically by his professor and colleagues in the Birmingham Physics Department, for doubtless they regretted the loss to pure science of their best student. But they could not have known, of course, any more than the world then knew, of the astonishing course of future science and especially of their own subject. Indeed, despite the earlier pioneering work of scientists like Hopwood and Russ, the move of this young physicist from academia into the borderline aspects of medical science can justifiably be regarded as one of eventual immense importance, alike to the development of radiation physics and atomic energy. The results also soon began to impress his former teachers, for they later recommended the subject of medical physics to their students as an employment option where required, which was only occasionally. Part of the demonstrator's work lay in teaching physics to 1st M.B. medical students and partly in researches which reflected Hopwood's wide and rather catholic scientific interests, such as the study of the X-ray fluorescence of silica (2) and the X-ray analysis of the crystal structure of some biological materials (3). But of much greater significance during his period at Bart's was the association Val Mayneord began to have with clinicians, including Sir Geoffrey Keynes, who were pioneering the use of radium and X-rays in the treatment of human cancer. Val was very impressed with the difficulties of using these radiations therapeutically and was convinced that their physical actions needed to be studied and their dosimetry quantified if their medical use was to be effective. This was to be the task to which he was to devote so much of his future career. In 1927 he again left the security of an academic post for the uncertainty of a one-year fellowship of the British Empire Cancer Campaign at the Cancer Hospital (Free) to study the effects of X-rays on the blood. At the end of the year, however, a wise Board of Governors of the Hospital offered him a permanent appointment as their first full-time physicist and his real life's work began. THE CANCER HOSPITAL, 1927 ONWARDS There can be little doubt that the appointment of Val Mayneord to the Cancer Hospital (later to be the Royal Cancer Hospital and then the Royal Marsden Hospital) began, in the modern sense, what Dr Alex Comfort later called the 'irruption of physics into medicine'. It was the appointment of a physicist, not originally to a teaching post, but to a post of front-line collaboration with the doctor in the radiation treatment of cancer. Fortunately this example of the Cancer Hospital was followed in a few years by other hospitals in London and the rest of the country, and there grew up a rapport between physicists and radiotherapists, anxious to make their treatments quantitative, that was to put British radiotherapy in the forefront of radiation work internationally. Before considering the immense contribution made by Val Mayneord's researches in the field of radiation, other fundamental researches in a different direction, that of 345</page><page sequence="5">Biographical Memoirs chemical carcinogenesis, must be considered. THE SPECTROGRAPHIC INVESTIGATION OF CARCINOGENIC SUBSTANCES Soon after he arrived at the Cancer Hospital, Val Mayneord became involved in investigations by Sir Ernest Kennaway and his colleagues into the carcinogenic properties of various higher-boiling fractions of coal tar. According to Kennaway himself (Kennaway 1955): 'the conspicuous fluorescence of these materials caused him [Mayneord], without any encouragement from me [Kennaway], to examine this property spectroscopically'. Val examined the fluorescence spectra excited by UV light, and discovered fluorescent bands associated with substances shown to be carcinogenic to mouse skin, an enormous advance in the analysis of potential carcinogenic materials. Several papers on the production of cancer by identified polycyclic hydrocarbons followed, with Mayneord as a coauthor (16, 22, 26, 29), but the attribution to him of the original method, strangely, was not made in the first publications of 1930. This was rectified, however, by Hieger in 1937 and later by Kennaway as quoted above. Hieger (1937) wrote: That these remarkable compounds are available is due to the fruitful pioneer work of Mayneord on the fluorescence spectrum of tar ... Mayneord made the fundamental observation - namely, that the same characteristic bands were to be found in the spectra of tars and other carcinogenic substances such as 'Schroeter mixture'. Together with Kennaway, Cook, Hewett and Hieger, Mayneord received the first Anna Fuller Memorial Prize (U.S.A.) in 1939 'in recognition of their notable accomplishments in the fields of Cancer Research, specifically for their isolation and synthesis of cancer-producing hydrocarbons from coal tar, the identification by fluorescence spectroscopy, and for the study of the biological effects of these substances'. Further work on chemical compounds as carcinogenic agents continued beyond the researches referred to above, partly with Mayneord collaborating with Kennaway and his colleagues (36, 39), and also in association with Dr Roe in using the more quantitative ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy to study some complex aromatic hydrocarbons (32, 38). Further papers followed by Mayneord and Roe on the fluorescence relating to the possible carcinogenic action of irradiated cholesterol. RADIATION WORK This period of research covers the time up to about the end of World War II, although the significance of much of it extends far beyond that point. It is best considered in sections, mainly on ionizing radiations, which link together and to some extent overlap but which together provide an insight into the history of radiation dosimetry in the 20th century, of which they form a very considerable part. At the same time it is an account of the development of the Physics Department of the Cancer Hospital to the point at which it was recognized as one of the world's foremost medical radiation laboratories. 346</page><page sequence="6">William Valentine Mayneord 1. X-ray researches On moving to the Cancer Hospital, Val Mayneord immediately set about his aim to apply physics to the therapeutic use of X-rays and, as a first step, to convince his medical colleagues that the use of an ionization method for the measurement of X-ray dose was essential. Before the internationally agreed definition of the 'roentgen' as the unit of X-ray measurement in 1928, he had set up what is known as a parallel-plate ionization chamber and had evaluated the pastille dose in an absolute unit (4), i.e. effectively in roentgens; (the pastille dose was an early unit of radiation dose based on the change of colour induced by X-rays in a pastille of barium platinocyanide; it remained in use, surprisingly, over many years, particularly in dermatological practice). Mayneord was soon to be using a small ionization chamber to study the distribution of dose in a water bath, water being effectively the equivalent of soft tissue in respect of the absorption and scattering of X-rays (7). Within a year Val Mayneord was directing attention to the necessity of considering energy absorption in tissues themselves and the extent to which measurement of ionization in air could be regarded as a measurement of energy absorption in soft tissues. A paper, 'The true absorption of the energy of electro-magnetic radiation in light substances', dealt in detail with this subject (8), calculating the proportions of the absorption taking place by the photoelectric process and the Compton recoil process as the wavelength of radiation changed. He also considered the energies of the secondary electrons and their ranges and related the necessary dimensions of the parallel plate ionization chamber to them. A further paper (10) dealt theoretically and experimentally with the secondary electronic emissions from metal foils and animal tissues including bone, although the full analysis had to await later work which followed on Gray's restatement and elucidation of the 'Bragg-Gray law' of cavity ionization (Gray 1937). Nevertheless these researches on secondary electrons had a great influence on the concepts of radiation dose and enabled Mayneord to deal with the problem of 'secondary radiation therapy', which proposed that incorporating heavy elements into tissues would increase X-ray absorption and therefore raise the therapeutic effect (12). It was shown that not much more than modest gains could be expected under rather stringent conditions which were difficult to meet in practice. That Mayneord's researches and concepts were gaining acceptance among radiotherapists was evident in a discussion on some physical and medical aspects of X-ray dosage in malignant disease at the Section of Radiology of the Royal Society of Medicine, in 1932 (14). At this point mention must be made of Val Mayneord's first book, The physics of X-ray therapy, published in 1929. It was a landmark in the X-ray literature of the time, was very lucidly written and contained an understandable account of the substance of much of the research considered above. It was quantitative and useful alike to radiologists, to students and to the expert. Dosemeters using small ionization chambers and electrical recording were becoming commercially available at about that time, and there is no doubt that the book promoted good practice in their use and greatly helped to establish a new era of quantitative X-ray therapy. 347</page><page sequence="7">Biographical Memoirs Significant developments in physics at the Cancer Hospital took place in the early 1930s when a separate Physics Department was established and Dr J.E. Roberts was appointed as an assistant physicist to Val Mayneord. The Department had for some time enjoyed the help of a mechanical workshop, under the direction of Mr H.C. Hodt, a skilled instrument maker, later to be joined by his son Henry; father and son served the Department extraordinarily well throughout their entire working lives. Father Hodt was a colourful character and many are his stories, doubtless apochryphal, that are said to have circulated round the hostelries of the Fulham Road of the days when 'me and Mayneord cured cancer!'. Another development about this time was the installation of a 400 kV X-ray apparatus for the physical investigation of the properties of X-rays generated at potentials greater than 200 kV, for there were general expectations of therapeutic advantage from the use of higher-voltage radiations. Mayneord and Roberts made a series of important investigations of the dose-rates, quality in terms of absorptions in various metals and depth doses in water attainable with these higher-voltage X-rays (19, 24, 27). Their results, unique in this country, showed clearly the limitations of the use of 400 kV X-rays in terms of the dominance of scattered radiation at depths in water, and that a leap to megavoltage X-rays would be required if considerable increases in percentage depth dose were to be realized. On the purely physical side they provided good experimental evidence of agreement between the measured absorption coefficients of light elements at the short wavelengths and those calculated by the Klein-Nishina formula (31). Other work followed, on the physical properties of low-voltage X-ray therapy that became available at that time, with specially constructed X-ray tubes operating at 50-60 kV (30, 33) and, earlier, there were accurately measured dosage investigations of the effect of X-rays on the blood of rats (5). Two more of Val Mayneord's papers should be mentioned which appeared in these early years. In 1934 he made calculations of the total path length of all the electrons set free by the photoelectric and Compton recoil processes per unit energy absorption of X-rays of different wavelengths and then studied the survival curves to be expected in a mass of cells according to the energy absorption required per cell for a given biological change (25). Another concerned a law of growth of Jensen's rat sarcoma depending on whether the volume of cells were growing or only a peripheral layer, the latter giving a growth curve like that observed. The effect of irradiation was also observed and the paper attracted much attention (15). Lastly a paper by Clarkson &amp; Mayneord (50), explored two experimental methods of investigating the quality of X-radiation in a scattering medium, based respectively on differential electron emission and differential absorption in copper and carbon ionization chambers, and produced results of practical clinical value. Further, an analytical review of great thoroughness by Mayneord &amp; Lamerton (59), resulted in empirical formulae from which standard depth dose tables could be prepared and these proved of lasting value to clinicians and physicists over very many years. 348</page><page sequence="8">William Valentine Mayneord 2. Radium researches In parallel with the X-ray researches, and of equal importance, were the researches connected with the therapeutic use of radium, and these were at first done almost single-handed by Mayneord himself. In a paper in 1931 (13), measurements were made 'in r units', i.e. ionization in air, of the dose near a radium needle. The ionization chamber, having dimensions of only a few millimetres, was small enough to explore the radiation field around the needle and to construct the first 'iso-intensity' lines reported for a radium appliance. The chamber was calibrated by reference to a beam of hard X-rays, itself calibrated in terms of a free-air ionization chamber. A very important result was the experimental determination of the dose rate at 1 cm from 1 mg 226Ra in a 0.5 mm Pt shield as 8.7 r h-1 and a comparison with a theoretical value of about 9 r h-1 based on the Gray 'principle of equivalence' of 1929: later the 'Bragg-Gray law' (Gray 1937). The importance of these early measurements can be judged by the discussions that continued for some years, both nationally and internationally over the exact value of this radium constant and indeed over the use of the roentgen as a unit suitable for y-ray dose. Two other papers from the Cancer Hospital bear on this question. Researches by Mayneord and Roberts (21), on the y-ray ionization in a parallel plate chamber showed that the low experimental value then found of only 3.06 for the r mg-1 h-1 was attributable mainly to the inadequate plate separation and the near-impossibility of achieving an apparatus of suitable dimensions in air at atmospheric pressure. A further paper (40), on the precision measurement of y rays investigated the effects of wall thickness and size of precisely constructed small ionization chambers of different light elements and deduced an experimental value for the c. mg.h unit as 8.3 ? 0.2 compared with a value 8.4 by Gray and a later value of 8.16 obtained with a parallel plate chamber at ten atmospheres pressure by Taylor &amp; Singer (1940). Much of this work underpinned the final decision of the International Commission on Radiation Units in 1937 to redefine the roentgen in a manner suitable for use with y rays. Coincident with these researches on the absolute dose rates to be expected from radium sources, a series of calculations were done by Val Mayneord of the distribution of radiation doses around radioactive sources of various shapes, following the earlier fundamental work of Sievert in the early 1920s (Sievert 1932), and which, as an editorial in the British Journal of Radiology in 1932 pointed out, marked the beginning of a scientific system of dosage for radium therapy. Source shapes such as the line (needle), the ring, flat plate, spherical shell and some combinations of sources were considered and dose contours plotted (17, 18); some of these problems were returned to at a much later date when the dosimetry of radionuclides in the human body was under consideration. A further development in which finite sources were broken up into a series of point sources to which simple inverse square law data could be assembled and applied proved to be very practical under clinical circumstances (49, 58, 66). Coupled with this, mention must be made of the invention by Mayneord of a dose contour projector which enabled three-dimensional dose distributions to be 349</page><page sequence="9">Biographical Memoirs plotted fairly easily for both radium sources and X-ray beams. This represented a very considerable and popular step forward in clinical dosimetry (53, 54). 3. Energy absorption and integral dose The absorption of radiation energy in tissues was discussed in many of the earliest papers of Mayneord but began to receive quantitative consideration by him in the later 1930s, and especially relevant was the discussion in a paper on the significance of the roentgen (44), with its definition of 'effective atomic number' of compounds and tissues and calculations of the consequent energy absorption per roentgen. Two papers that followed introduced new concepts in radiation dosage and gave preliminary quantitative means of their realization (56, 57). An 'integral dose' was defined as the integral of dose x mass over the mass of tissue irradiated by a beam, and was therefore a measure of the total energy absorbed by the tissues and its unit defined as a 'gram-roentgen'. A somewhat similar development of integrating dose x volume was published by Happey (1940) but with rather less precision and a unit labelled 'cc.roentgen' was introduced but it was Mayneord's concept of integral dose, measured in gram-roentgen that held the field and led to developments by himself and others over subsequent years. A novel graphical method for determining the integral dose was based on the isodose curves of a radiation beam and simple approximate numerical formulae were also developed. These concepts gained the interest of clinicians both in relation to the more systemic effects of radiation (62), and in connection with radiation protection. Subsequent experimental work by Mayneord &amp; Clarkson (74, 75) used multiple condenser ionization chambers to measure the integral dose in a specially constructed model patient under conditions of clinical irradiations, both with X-rays of various energies and with y rays from radium. Considerations were also given to the integral dose in relation to the then accepted value of the 'tolerance dose' laid down in protection regulations. The next paper gave the mathematical theory of integral dose (by now an accepted function) and its applications in practice (76), and put integral dose calculations on a generalized basis to meet various clinical circumstances. In the last of this series of researches (77), Mayneord applied integral dose calculations to radium sources, again with practical examples, but by far the most important feature of the whole series of these researches on integral dose was his restatement of the reciprocal relation between source and absorber. Although this kind of reciprocity had been noted in the very early years of radioactivity work, Mayneord generalized the concept as the reciprocity theorem and applied it to find the integral dose in finite geometrical volumes from the formulae that he and others had developed to determine the dose at points distant from similar radium configurations. These principles were later to be fundamental to radionuclide dosimetry. Meanwhile collaboration with medical and other colleagues have been recorded on the effects of radiation on animals and humans, all of which have included aspects of X-ray and radium dosimetry discussed in these sections (42, 43, 47, 58, 62, 66, 73, 85). 350</page><page sequence="10">William Valentine Mayneord 4. Radionuclide dosimetry When man-made radionuclides became available it was evident that their dosimetry was almost ready to hand in the researches that Val Mayneord and others had already done. Some of the early radium calculations on the doses near simple geometrical sources could be used directly with due allowance for the y-ray emissions from the new radionuclides but much followed from the integral dose work together with the use of the reciprocity theorem. The concept of integral dose and its calculation stimulated further quite extensive calculations, especially by Bush (1946, 1949) of the integral dose for anthropomorphic models like the one used by Mayneord and Clarkson in their experimental work on integral dose. This meant that the integral dose calculations could yield directly the doses at points near or within body sections or the whole body, when filled with various y-emitting radionuclides and, via the calculations of 'auto-integral dose', the average dose to the whole body. This work, together with the simpler calculation of the P-particle dose, provided the methods underlying most of the subsequent protection dosimetry of the nuclear age. This was all expounded with great clarity in two publications. The first was in a large section on the 'Dosimetry of artificial radioactive isotopes' in a book entitled Some applications of nuclearphysics to medicine (1950) by Mayneord himself and the second by Mayneord &amp; Sinclair on The dosimetry of artificial radioisotopes (102), the latter discussing certain clinical techniques with radioiodine and radiophosphorus in great detail. 5. Non-ionizing radiation Although only two papers by Mayneord &amp; Tulley deal with this subject (68,69) they represent what is probably the first attempt in this country to investigate infrared radiation from a clinical standpoint. As might be expected, the significant quantity to be used and the distribution of radiation intensity from various sources were carefully measured with results that were invaluable (and in cases surprising) to the clinician. An attempt was also made to compare the total energy absorbed by the body with that from typical X-ray, infra-red and UV treatments. This episode illustrates Val Mayneord's breadth of vision and his continued ability to sense where physics could be of use and significance in medicine. THE NUCLEAR AGE The advent of the nuclear age found the Royal Cancer Hospital, and especially its physics department, in a strong position to take advantage of the new sources and medical possibilities that were to become available, and much of the work in physics was ready for extension to the new developments. Already by 1943, when the Hospital Physicists' Association was formed and the whereabouts of its members documented, the Royal Cancer Hospital had five or six physicist assistants to Val Mayneord, with only two other hospitals having comparable physics teams in London or elsewhere in the country. During the years following the end of World War II, Val Mayneord's 351</page><page sequence="11">Biographical Memoirs department grew extensively with, additionally, postgraduate medical students and many visiting scientists and his commitments too began to change. He led a large department with insight and originality, despite his load of national and international commitments. Accounts of the important researches he did with his staff and collaborators are given in the following sections. 1. The synchrotron in medical use In 1949 The Medical Research Council installed a 30 MeV synchrotron at the Royal Cancer Hospital for the exploration of its capabilities for medical use. This followed Mayneord's interest and researches in X-rays generated at potentials up to 1 MeV (19, 27, 50) but more particularly followed on his work with Dr Martin on betatrons, synchrotrons and linear accelerators in both this country and the U.S.A. and reported in his book Some applications of nuclear physics to medicine. This meant that much useful information was available to underpin the researches on the physical properties of the synchrotron radiation preliminary to its clinical application (87). The possible production of radioactivity in tissues irradiated by the synchrotron was also investigated (88) but shown to contribute negligibly to the total energy absorption of the radiation beam. Finally a clinical example of the synchrotron's use was given in the treatment of cerebral gliomas with 24 MeV X-rays (100). 2. Nuclear medicine Val Mayneord was very active in the field of nuclear medicine and a considerable section of his post-war work lay in researches related to it. Some of the first of these concerned the new radioisotope 6Co, a powerful y-ray source. At the laboratories of the National Research Council at Chalk River, Ontario, Canada, very careful measurements were made in collaboration with Dr Cipriani (82) of the absorption of 60Co y-rays in a series of elements from low to high atomic number, and the electronic absorption coefficients were shown to be in agreement with modern theories and consistent with an average y-ray energy of 1.22 MeV: important results for the future use of 6Co. Another important clinical investigation by Mayneord in collaboration with Dr Nickson and Dr Lamerton showed that 6Co was absorbed from bare metallic implants (in animals) and that encapsulation would be required if 60Co was used parenterally in humans (86). When scintillation counting methods became available considerable work was done, in collaboration with Dr Belcher, on the physical properties of the phosphors themselves and their associated photomultipliers and electronic circuits. Other investigations followed on the properties and clinical use of small 'needle' Geiger counters and on the possibilities of making 'needle' scintillation counters, though these proved to have lower sensitivities than the Geiger instruments (89, 101, 103, 104). A comprehensive account of these researches on scintillation counting is included as a separate chapter by Mayneord and Belcher in the book Some applications of nuclear physics to medicine. 352</page><page sequence="12">William Valentine Mayneord 3. The scanning of isotope activity In many ways the most original and important contribution Val Mayneord made to nuclear medicine was to produce the first scanner for making visible the distribution of activity of an isotope in the body. It was done against expressed doubts as to its feasibility and, in various forms, operated for a decade before being eventually overtaken by the y camera. It was the combined work of several hands (at first in collaboration with Dr R.C. Turner and Messrs S.P. Newbury and H.J. Hodt and later with Dr H. Evans), but chiefly that of Mayneord himself. The scanning was performed by ingenious mechanical movement and the radiation detector was at first a Geiger counter, but later a scintillation counter, which was used with recording on an image-storage tube. Some of the work on collimation had already been considered by Mayneord and Belcher but questions of sensitivity and resolution were investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The scanner was used clinically, mainly in providing excellent images of 131I taken up by the thyroid (93, 95, 98, 108). 4. Radiography with radioactive isotopes Although the direction of Val Mayneord's researches had been in the application of physics in cancer research and radiotherapy, the possibilities of the nuclear age and the kind of physical problems encountered in scanning turned his attention to diagnostic radiology and its problems concerning the X-ray image. Thoughts on this were expressed in his opening address to the Annual Congress of the British Institute of Radiology in 1953 (106). One of the new possibilities then received considerable experimental and theoretical attention, that of exploring the use of two man-made radioisotopes as sources of medium voltage radiations in radiography. The physical properties of these radioisotopes were investigated, including the quality and output of radiation, and finally small compressed sources were made which could produce radiographs from within the body as well as externally in the conventional manner. The rather limited possibilities were explored but with good examples in dentistry, with the small source within the mouth and externally as radiographs of the hand and elbow (96, 97, 113, 114). The investigations illustrate well Mayneord's original mind and his continued awareness of the potential of physics to aid and improve medical procedures. RADIATION PROTECTION Ritchie Calder in his book Living with the atom headed its first chapter with a quotation: 'The peaceful development of atomic energy is humanity's greatest adventure and, like all adventure, it must involve risks' (W.V. Mayneord, Geneva, 1955). In fact the risks associated with the use of ionizing radiation, from the early use of radium and X-rays to those of the nuclear age, were a great concern of Val Mayneord for the whole of his professional life. His medical physics work began only a few years after the first recommendations for safe practice had been made by the British X-ray and Radium Protection Committee in 1921. His work on the 353</page><page sequence="13">Biographical Memoirs measurement of X and y rays and the adoption of the roentgen did much to quantify the problems of radiation protection, though in the early days measurement of ambient dose levels and of the doses to personnel were made mainly for the assurance that the 'tolerance dose limit' was being met. Eventually, as described in Mayneord's Sylvanus Thompson Memorial Lecture (92), he had a thorough film badge protection service in operation; who but Mayneord, however, would regard the Hospital Padre who 'sits and talks to patients having radium inside them' as qualifying for a film badge! In 1945-46 Val Mayneord was seconded to the Joint French-Canadian-British Atomic Energy Project at Chalk River, Canada, where he helped to set up their medical and biological division. It was here that his earlier mathematical and experimental work came enormously to fruition in the new problems of radiation protection. Besides examining the potential of the new artificial radionuclides for medical use, he was able to convert the former dosimetry of radium sources to that of the y rays from the new sources. Moreover his concept and calculations of integral dose together with his reciprocal theorem enabled settings to be made of levels of dose in the body or organs containing radioisotopes. On returning to this country a series of lectures at the British Institute of Radiology expounded this work and led to the all-important book, Some applications of nuclearphysics to medicine (1950), referred to above. His experience in radiation protection in the nuclear age led to Mayneord's extensive work for both national and international committees. The earliest post-war British committee, and in many ways the most seminal in its influence, was the Tolerance Doses Panel of which Mayneord was chairman. This panel, ultimately responsible via its Protection Committee, to the Medical Research Council's Committee on Medical and Biological Applications of Nuclear Physics, first met on 29 November 1946 to prepare recommendations on tolerance doses for ionizing radiations. These were eventually transmitted via the MRC Protection Committee to the International Commission on Radiological Protection, which met in London in 1950, and without doubt played a large part in shaping the final decisions of this International Commission. After this the Medical Research Council set up its Committee on Protection against Ionizing Radiations (PIRC) of which Mayneord was the first chairman. He was a member, frequently chairman, of many committees connected with radiation hazards which are listed later though a few should be mentioned here. In this country, the MRC Committee on Hazards to Man of Nuclear and Allied Radiations, the Joint MRC/ARC Monitoring Committee on Nuclear Fallout and the Ministry of Health Committee on Radiological Hazards to Patients. He was chairman of the first U.K. delegation to the U.N. Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. He was sometime a member of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and of the International Commission on Radiation Units and chairman of the latter when an energy unit, the rad, was adopted in place of the roentgen. Together with Professor Mitchell, F.R.S., he made 'An attempt to estimate the hazard from the ingestion of strontium 90' for the MRC Hazards to Man Committee (112). In 1964 Val Mayneord held the Rock Carling Fellowship of the Nuffield Provincial 354</page><page sequence="14">William Valentine Mayneord Hospitals Trust and wrote the monograph, Radiation and Health, his third book, the subject matter of which was expounded in the Rock Carling Memorial Lecture at the University of Birmingham Medical School. The book, written not only for the specialist, but having a general appeal and usefulness for those in medicine, biology and the physical sciences, gives a succinct account of radiation hazards and their impact on society. The nature of ionizing radiations and their origins are described, together with their biological effects on man. Questions of harm and benefit are discussed and the whole book and its philosophy are as pertinent today as when it was written in 1964. Mayneord worked effectively throughout his career on problems associated with radiation protection (90, 92, 99, 105, 132, 133, 142, 144, 158) and often, as in his assessment with Dr R.H. Clarke of the carcinogenic risks associated with 'hot particles', with great influence on national and international debate (154). The most fitting recognition of his work in this field was his Sievert Award (1977) of the International Radiological Protection Association (155). ALPHA RADIOACTIVITY IN NATURE Over the decade from 1954, a very extensive series of investigations of the a activity of man and his environment were made by Mayneord and his colleagues (initially Dr R.C. Turner and Mr J.M. Radley and later Dr C.R. Hill and Dr R.V. Osborne). Although this environmental work began with an investigation of radon in the atmosphere in 1954 (107), the measurement of a activity in human and animal tissues came a few years later and were based on the development of new low-level techniques for the extremely weak natural activities encountered. The reduction of background counts by the necessary factors of 30 or more were achieved by the use of plastics instead of metals and of materials generally of very low a contamination. A simple system for total a counting was devised (117, 118) and a sophisticated a spectrometer was developed for radionuclide identification (126, 139). The counting of 'fast pairs' in the total a apparatus was also developed to identify the thorium content. The results covered a wide range of human, animal, foods and environmental substances with some important general results. The specific activity in human bone was shown not to vary with age and to be some ten times less than in cow bone and to be orders of magnitude less than in many environmental materials. About 100 different foodstuffs were examined, and rather more different samples of drinking water, so that an appropriate figure could be given for average dietary intake (121, 124, 128, 130). The total list contained the surprising example of Brazil nuts with a very anomalous activity some 30 times higher than its nearest rival and 200 or more times the rest. The data allowed metabolic consideration to be given to the uptake of radium in human tissues, especially in bone, and to certain biological consequences. In relation to the water data a solution was given to the dosimetry of a source of radioactivity diffusing in water, for instance the diffusion of 222Rn in water. The investigations of a activity in man and the environment done by Mayneord and his colleagues represent the most extensive so far available (120, 125, 140). Mayneord was invited to speak generally on the subject of environmental radioactivity and its biological significance 355</page><page sequence="15">Biographical Memoirs (129, 135, 141) and in his review in the Scientific basis of medicine annual review of 1966 (143), in the second 'Hazards to man' Report of the MRC, and also at the second U.N. International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy (120), he was able to give the most authoritative accounts then possible of the radioactivity in the environment and its potential consequences. RADIATION CARCINOGENESIS Although Val Mayneord had been actively concerned with both chemical and radiation carcinogenesis throughout his whole professional life, it was in retirement that his experiences and ideas over half a century of activity flowered and were crystallized in mathematical expression. After all, his first major research was the spectrographic identification of the carcinogenic hydrocarbons and he was an active participant in some 12 papers on chemical carcinogenesis. Of his early experience in radiation carcinogenesis (5, 39, 45), a work that clearly influenced his thought was that with Burrows and Roberts (42) on neoplasia following the application of X-rays to inflammatory lesions. A comprehensive review on the 'Carcinogenic effects of radiation' written in collaboration with Glucksman &amp; Lamerton (116) emphasized the same point, that observed radiation-induced cancers appeared to arise from a tissue environment that has suffered severe disorganization either from the radiation itself or from other cause. In his Mackenzie Davidson Memorial Lecture of the British Institute of Radiology (149) he began to draw together his ideas on cancer induction as a two-stage 'model', in which a first stage, initiation in a cell, is followed by a development period in which other nearby tissues play an important part, possibly influenced also by irradiation. Indeed cancer induction permeated Mayneord's work on radiation protection. In retirement Val Mayneord became a consultant to the CEGB Research Laboratories at Berkeley in Gloucestershire and here there came about a most fortunate association with a former colleague Dr B.M. Wheatley, then Head of Health Physics Research, and Dr R.H. Clarke. Mayneord and Clarke considered several problems related to radiation carcinogenesis and formulated them in equations susceptible to computer methods of solution. This enabled the consequences of various biological assumptions to be followed up and their dependence on various parameters to be determined numerically. Initially developed as reports to the CEGB these were finally combined into a joint book, Carcinogenesis and radiation risk; a biomathematical reconnaissance. This was Mayneord's fourth and last book, probably the most seminal and certainly extremely important. A mathematical theory of cellular and tissue response was developed and applied to such problems as the uniform and non-uniform irradiation of tissues, with both linear and non-linear forms of tissue response, point sources, moving sources, including diffusion in the case of internal emitters, and relative biological effectiveness. In a foreword, the late Sir Edward Pochin has written: What is achieved is an impressively close analysis of the significance of existing data, the implication of different hypotheses, and the kind of effect that any given model of carcinogenic action would have under different conditions of dose distribution in space or time ... As 356</page><page sequence="16">William Valentine Mayneord machinery for critical analysis, it should be of great and lasting value. And indeed so it has proved, as subsequent correspondence between Val and other scientists here and abroad has shown. Dr Hermann Lisco from Harvard has written of the stimulating and rewarding reading provided by the book and of the precision given to many questions that are applicable to all types of carcinogenesis and Dr Newell Stannard, in his immense volume, Radioactivity and health (1988), quotes the Mayneord &amp; Clarke work on point sources in his discussion of the 'hot particle' problem. More importantly in the years following the publication of Biomathematical reconnaissance in 1976, Val was still developing his ideas of radiation carcinogenesis in the early 1980s. Unfortunately the most forward-looking and innovative ideas in this direction remain at present unpublished. THE ROYAL MARSDEN HOSPITAL PHYSICS DEPARTMENT Of all the facets of Val Mayneord's life's work, probably the most far-reaching in importance has been the building up of his own Physics Department. Early on it was recognized internationally among the few scientists in America, Sweden, Germany and France seeking to establish a unit for the definition of X-ray dose, and became the most influential and possibly the largest in this country and one of the most important world centres. Professor L.F. Lamerton has provided a succinct account of the Department as he has known it since 1938 which he has kindly allowed me to reproduce below and Professor J.E. Roberts has given me some interesting comments on the Department's very early days. Professor Lamerton writes: There were two events during the first few years of Val's work at the Cancer Hospital that contributed greatly to the subsequent success of the Physics Department. The first was the establishment of Val's university connection when, in 1931 he was appointed a Teacher of London University in 'Physics Applied to Medical Radiology' (and later Reader in 1933, and Professor in Physics Applied to Medicine in 1940). The second was the grant of independence to his Department by the Hospital in 1936. Both were a consequence of his personal qualities and the recognition of his stature by those with whom he worked and by the members of the governing body. At this time the Department consisted just of himself and J.E. Roberts, who had joined him in 1932, together with H.C. Hodt, an instrument maker. He was also the Ph.D. supervisor of Miss Edna Roe, who was on the staff of the Hospital's Research Institute, directed by Professor Kennaway. Val's work had already covered a remarkable range, in radiological physics and in the biological field in association with the Research Institute. However, though still much concerned with problems of energy absorption in relation to the definition of the unit of radiation dose he was recognizing the need for much more in the way of individual assessment of dose in patients, and had little difficulty in persuading his radiological colleagues of this and of the need for more staff. Roberts left to go to the Middlesex Hospital in 1936 but in the same year Joan Honeyburne joined him, followed by J.R. Clarkson in 1937 and L.F. Lamerton in 1938. This was the time of much work on establishment of physical data, and with this an intense clinical involvement in X-ray and radium therapy. Also, at the beginning 357</page><page sequence="17">Biographical Memoirs of 1937 he was given a secretary, Audrey Morrell, who had arrived at the Hospital expecting to work as an almoner but was offered instead the post of Val's secretary. It says a great deal for her prescience and flexibility that she took this post, and with such advantage to the Department. These were now the war years. Joan Honeyburne left for war service followed by Lamerton, and later in the war Clarkson left to take over Hospital Physics in Southampton. Val was able to recruit some more staff, including Gottfried Spiegler, a refugee physicist from Austria with much experience in the field of diagnostic radiology. It was an extremely difficult time for everybody in the Department, not least in maintaining radium and radon therapy in the face of the bombing. However, it did not stop Val from starting some new lines, particularly concerning the concept of 'integral dose' and its measurement. Immediately after the War, Val was invited by the Government to take a year's consultancy in Canada in connection with the radiobiological aspects of atomic energy development. This was agreed by the Board of the Hospital who also recognized that it could be eventually to the Hospital's advantage, which indeed proved the case. The Board successfully obtained the early release of Joan Honeyburne from her war service, and of Lamerton, who took charge of the Department during Val's absence. This period was one of development of radiation techniques and of extension of the teaching courses which had become an important part of the Department's activities. The following year Val returned from his secondment brimming with new ideas, both technically and in relation to the scope of physics in medicine. In particular, he saw that the work had to be broadened to take advantage of all the new developments in electronics and to exploit the exciting medical possibilities of nuclear physics. Dr Smithers, now the Head of Radiotherapy, was in full agreement with him, and the Hospital was prepared to provide the Department with a considerable increase in accommodation. Val also saw the need for development of the more biological aspects of radiation work, and when Lamerton, on return from the International Cancer Congress in St Louis, U.S.A., said that he wanted to move over to radiobiology, Val said to him, 'Well, you can do what you like for three years and I won't ask you what you are doing', a response which illustrates clearly why his staff had such loyalty to him. The radiobiological work began with applications of the new techniques of autoradiography and with studies of the irradiation of transplanted animal tumours in collaboration with the Research Institute (now designated the Chester Beatty Research Institute) and a little later experimental studies of bone marrow function using radioactive tracers. This developed into a recognized radiobiological section, and in 1960 Lamerton was appointed to a Chair in Biophysics Applied to Medicine. Within two years of Val's return from Canada, the Department, in addition to its radiotherapy physics, was working on problems and applications of isotopes in therapy and diagnosis, on electronics and scanning systems, on radiobiology, and on high energy radiations. There were increases in staff, but also there were now a substantial number of visiting workers, some seconded from departments in Canada following Val's visit. In addition, the Department had studentships supported by the Associated 358</page><page sequence="18">William Valentine Mayneord Electrical Industries (AEI), whom Val had been able to interest through the good offices of his old friend Sir Ernest Rock Carling, F.R.C.S. Until the National Health Service was introduced the Physics Department and the Chester Beatty Research Institute were financed by the Hospital Board, helped by grants from the British Empire Cancer Campaign, the MRC and certain other sources. Under the NHS, the Government would take over the financing of clinical work but other arrangements had to be made for research work. It took several years to settle the arrangements. It was finally agreed that the research sides should be incorporated into an Institute of Cancer Research, to be part of London University's Postgraduate Medical Federation. The University provided no financial support, the sources for which would now be the BECC, the MRC, the Institute itself and initially a contribution from the Department of Health to take account of direct clinical applications of the work of the Institute. No overall director for the Institute was appointed but, like all Gaul, it was divided into three parts, with Val, Professor Haddow and Professor Smithers as three independent directors. Val was not happy with this seeming divorce between the clinical and research sides, and was not one of the signatories of the Articles of Association of the Institute of Cancer Research, finally signed in 1954. In fact, however, there was no adverse effect on relations; administratively Hospital and Institute were well represented on both governing bodies, there were several shared appointments and of course the work of the Physics Department spanned both. On his return from Canada Val felt that the necessary developments in nuclear medicine could in no way be accommodated within the existing facilities of the Hospital, and Professor Smithers was equally convinced. Together they drew up a scheme for a new centre in London for the application of nuclear physics in medicine and the Board put this to the Ministry of Health in September 1947. Agreement was eventually reached to commence such a centre, not in London but on the site of the old Downs Hospital near Sutton in Surrey. An important factor in the Government's acceptance of the plan was the need they saw for programmes of training in nuclear medicine and the provision of facilities in case of nuclear accident or war, and insisted that the new centre had to be outside London. The first contingent of staff from the Physics and Radiotherapy Departments moved to Sutton in late 1956, using and adapting existing buildings. The building of the new hospital itself was commenced in 1960 and opened by H.M. the Queen in 1963. Val, who, of course, for many years had been very active in the field of radiation hazard, nationally and internationally, saw the opportunities at Sutton for the development of a national service related to radiation protection. Before the move to Sutton, and in consultation with the MRC, he invited into the Department in London two workers from the National Physical Laboratory, W. Binks and E.E. Smith, who were already engaged in radiation protection work, and they were afterwards able to move to Sutton to develop the Radiological Protection Service under the aegis of the MRC and the Ministry of Health, operating effectively a national service. There was one great advantage in the Sutton site; it was on a chalk subsoil which, because of its 359</page><page sequence="19">Biographical Memoirs low natural radioactivity, was ideal for measurement of very-low-level radiation. By digging into the chalk a laboratory was constructed in the basement of a building taken over by the Physics Department and Val was able to initiate his major programme on measurement of natural radioactivity. Later a major low background facility was also established in the Hospital, financed by the King Edward's Hospital Fund and developed by Dr N.G. Trott. Sutton also provided the opportunity for the growth of other more biological areas, particularly concerning the effects on animals of protracted and continuous irradiation and in the related field of cell-population kinetics, under Lamerton. During the period of planning of the new hospital much advance had been made in the field of cancer chemotherapy and this was included in the final plans, so that the hospital now covered a wider range of activity than at first envisaged. However, this was no disadvantage; new opportunities for the application of physics in medicine were offered and taken. In the new hospital the areas covered by the Physics Department included radiological diagnosis, particularly in the development and application of scanning systems, diagnostic and therapeutic applications in nuclear medicine, ultrasonics, computer applications in radiotherapy and more generally, and an extension of the biological work to include studies in chemotherapy. Val saw the completion of the new hospital two years before his retirement, and his contribution to its concept was perpetuated in the hospital by the naming of a ward after him. Professor Roberts comments on the esteem and scientific standing in which Val Mayneord was held when he joined the department in 1932. He also comments on how well the Department was accommodated on a whole floor of the radiotherapy wing, administratively under Dr J.M. Woodburn Morrison, Head of Radiology who, however, gave Val a very free hand. The Department had a fine mechanical instrument shop, 'our pride and joy', in charge of Mr H.C. Hodt, fulfilling all the Department's needs for experimental equipment, and possessed a new 400 kV X-ray machine for purely experimental purposes; a unique facility for those days. For researches Roberts writes, the measuring instruments were various forms of the still-used and versatile gold leaf electroscope, home made in Hodt's workshop. Professor Roberts points to a most important feature of that early laboratory; it possessed a large and well-equipped teaching laboratory. The teaching was at first for the radiological diplomas but later expanded to all the facets of radiation physics, radiobiological and nuclear medicine studies, with students and postgraduate fellows on a national and international scale, who subsequently carried the Department's teaching and ideas to practically all quarters of the world. In those early days, too, Val Mayneord's international reputation brought many visitors from overseas to discuss radiation measurement and the roentgen, including Sievert from Sweden, Lauriston Taylor and Failla from the U.S.A. and many others. PERSONAL LIFE AND CHARACTERISTICS Val, as he was almost universally known, was a most sensitive and considerate man with an outgoing personality and an attractive slightly Edwardian courtesy. One of his 360</page><page sequence="20">William Valentine Mayneord outstanding characteristics was his ability to inspire those around him with enthusiasm for whatever aspect of his own work he was discussing and with a generous consideration for that of others, although this did not inhibit his courteous criticism of work or ideas without merit. He was a source of real encouragement to the young and to his students. Professor Lamerton has written of his wise influence in respect of the subject of radiobiology and to me personally I must record and gratefully acknowledge his inspiration in relation to medical physics as a career. One of his staff, Dr Nigel Trott, has referred to Val's preference to sit side-by-side with a colleague, confronting problems together, rather than sitting at a desk facing him. It is small wonder then that one of his greatest achievements was the accord he developed between himself and his medical colleagues; indeed his example contributed much to the general collaboration that has developed between the physicist and the medical man, at first in radiotherapy and then more generally in medicine. Professor Sir David Smithers has expressed in a letter to me the essence of much that I have attempted to convey in this biographical memoir: On arriving at the Royal Marsden in October 1936 to take a Radiological Diploma, meaning to return to the Heart Hospital as a cardiologist with a specialty, I was interviewed by a young physicist who became a life-long friend and inspiration. I stayed to see if radiotherapy could be developed, which, without his help, could not have been done. In 1948 Val and I went on a trip to America and in San Francisco, after seeing a class of 180 in nuclear physics at Berkley (more than there were in the whole of Britain), sat on a balcony having breakfast and planned a hospital for the application of physics in medicine. Fourteen years later, after overcoming many difficul- ties, we built the Sutton branch of the R.M.H. It was much changed in outlook since the original plan, but without us it would never have happened. There are two hospital wards, Mayneord and Smithers, to mark the occasion and a stream of physicists and radiotherapists emerged to add their achievements to the original concept. Val was an original, ideas sprouted out of him and, always quiet, his influence was enormous. We started the first clinical hospital unit of nuclear medicine and made the first attempt at the localization of tumours by ultrasonics. Val put precision into radiotherapy so that we could place high doses at a depth with greater accuracy than we could locate the tumours. Always he had radiobiology in mind and saw our problems in the round. He was a lovely man. Many are those in medicine and science who regarded him with equal esteem. Val's science was very widely based but so were other aspects of his life, in particular his music, art and literature. He had an abiding love of Italy, could read and speak Italian and had a deep interest in the works of Dante. He was widely read in the history of science and particularly in the parallel developments in science and medicine over the centuries. As the President of the First Conference of the International Organization of Medical Physics, his opening address contained a remarkable account of the history of science applied to medicine, a tour de force of allusions going back in time to 450 BC and to the atoms of Democritus. Val's interest in art led to work on the X-ray examination of paintings and to becoming a member and, later, chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the National Gallery, and to being a National Gallery Trustee for five years from 1966. Val published four books, fewer perhaps than might have been expected considering the influence of his contributions to the literature on the application of radiation 361</page><page sequence="21">Biographical Memoirs science to medicine. But the four were all very exceptional books, highly relevant to the problems of the times when they were written, and I have described them at places in this memoir where they were central to subjects under discussion. Nevertheless it should be recalled that the first book, The physics of X-ray therapy (1929), was a very early and pioneer writing which did much to put British radiotherapy on a quantitative basis and the second, after World War II, was the definitive treatise on nuclear medicine and internal radiation dosimetry for a generation. His book, Radiation and health, expounded lucidly and deeply his ideas on radiation and man and his last, Radiation carcinogenesis, probably the most important, has left a scientific legacy to future investigators. Many honours and awards deservedly came to Val throughout his life, and some of these have already been mentioned where they fell naturally as part of the narrative. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1965 and he received all the honours the British Institute of Radiology could offer, namely the Roentgen Prize and Barclay Medal, the Silvanus Thompson and Mackenzie Davidson Memorial Medals, Honorary Membership in 1967, and in 1984 the Mayneord Lecture was inaugurated, under the sponsorship of the 3M United Kingdom plc. It must be mentioned here that Val was devoted to the BIR throughout his life, being an honorary secretary, an editor of its journal and in 1942 its president at a time when a risk of breakdown between the medical and non-medical sections looked possible, before a permanent and fruitful relationship was finally established. Val received Honorary Doctorates of the Universities of Aberdeen and Surrey, the Gold Medals of the Royal College of Radiologists, the Royal Swedish Academy of Science and the University of Arizona; also the Sievert Award of the International Radiation Protection Association and the Antoine Beclere Prize of the International Society of Radiology. A complete list of his awards and major appointments is given later. Although generally it can be said that the sun shone on Val's life and career, he had his darker and difficult times. The loss of his mother at an early age and the removal from his family to Evesham could not have been easy for a sentient child and, though he had the love and care of his aunt Polly and uncle in a comfortable home, his upbringing was essentially that of an only child. I believe this partly contributed to the ability he developed to read so widely and so deeply, and, indeed later to enjoy the life and culture of the capital. In 1929 Val married Joan Eaton, a former pupil of Prince Henry's Grammar School, Evesham, and at that time a graduate in arts of Durham University, though later she took a medical degree in Newcastle. The marriage at first was happy but later became very unhappy and ended in separation and later divorce. In the 1950s Val's health was not good and he had several episodes in hospital, the most alarming being with detached retinae which were eventually completely cured. In 1963 Val married Audrey Morrell, who had previously been his secretary and a considerable partner in the work of the Physics Department. They had 25 years of happy companionship and, as this biography shows, Val was enabled to undertake further scientific work and responsibilities such as his researches on radiation carcinogenesis and his visit to India and Sri Lanka on behalf of the World Health 362</page><page sequence="22">William Valentine Mayneord Organization. As Professor Kit Hill, Professor of Medical Physics at the Royal Marsden Hospital, has written: 'their marriage has been a joy to all who have known them'. Finally it can be said of Val Mayneord's career that it began at a time when his talents were sorely needed by doctors attempting to use radiation to treat cancer, and continued into the modern age, when his wisdom and experience were still most relevant to the problems of radiation use on a global scale. We can only be grateful that he chose to devote his life's work to the application of physics to medicine.

I am particularly indebted to Professor L.E. Lamerton for writing a section on the development of the Royal Marsden Physics Department and for kindly reading the typescript. My thanks are due to Professor Sir David Smithers and to Professor J.E. Roberts for sending me personal material about the early days in the Physics Department of the Cancer Hospital and also to Dr Nigel Trott and Professor C.R. Hill for the use of material they had written in other contexts about Val Mayneord. Most especially, however, I am grateful to Mrs Audrey Mayneord for her invaluable and continued help throughout the preparation of this memoir. She was able to let me have a complete list of all Val's publications and copies of the publications themselves, an enormously helpful contribution. She also made available the few notes Val had himself written about his father and family. The photograph reproduced with this memoir is one Mrs Mayneord liked very much and we both felt to be one that would be equally appreciated by others. It was taken by Walter Bird of Knightsbridge, London, a few years ago. The portrait photograph was taken by Walter Bird in 1965.
