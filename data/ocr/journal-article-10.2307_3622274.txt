We are not concerned here with the question as to how much history Maimonides knew or how accurate was the historical information he was able to obtain. It would be wholly pre- sumptuous to judge the amount of knowledge of any medieval writer from the point of vantage of modern historical scholarship based upon centuries of untiring critical research and the applica- tion of historical methods unknown to the medieval mind. Neither is it a question as to how much relevant information for the history of Maimonides' own time we may be able to gather from his writings. Especially his responsa and epistles contain numerous incidents of historical value which have not been fully utilized by modern research. A careful examination or reexamination of these incidents in connection with other sources available today would throw new light on certain phases of twelfth century Jewish history. But this task, however allur- ing, has been excluded from the scope of the present investigation. Nor is its objective to inquire into the extent to which history and dogma appeared as conflicting entities in the mind of Mai- monides. The entire problem of Glaube und Geschichte, so trouble- some to many modern Protestant theologians, loses much of its acuteness in Judaism through the absence of the conflict between the historical and the eternal Christ. The comparatively slight 5</page><page sequence="2">BARON antinomy between the historical Torah, given to the Israelitic people at a particular historical juncture, and its eternal validity -even if one failed to subscribe to the aggadic doctrine of its preexistence'-caused no misgivings to the medieval Jew, steeped in the tradition of the sudden revelation on Mt. Sinai.2 Our main concern here is to find out from the innumerable, mostly incidental, utterances of Maimonides what were his general as well as specific views on the past of mankind and of the Jewish people. These utterances naturally render only a fraction of what he really thought about human and Jewish history. But they happen to cover such a variety of episodes extending over so vast a range of generations that one may really regard them as a cross-section of all of Maimonides' his- torical views. At any rate, they appear sufficiently comprehensive and meaningful to allow for a reconstruction of their author's ' It is noteworthy that, although the doctrine of the Torah's preexistence had found a counterpart in the orthodox Muslim's belief in the primordial nature of the Koran, Maimuni maintains silence on the subject.

Seeberg and others, and clearly shows how little germane this subject is to Jewish theology. A. Weiser's Glaube und Geschichte im Allen Testament, Stuttgart 1931, is a typical endeavor to treat the Old Testament under the aspect of New Testament difficulties. 6</page><page sequence="3">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES historical Weltbild. If we shall discover that the Maimonidean outlook on history was but typical of that of a twelfth century educated Jew, this will be no reflection upon the profundity of the contributions of the jurist and philosopher, but serve as an even more illuminating example of the basic attitudes of medieval men.3 I. JEWISH AND ARABIAN HISTORIOGRAPHY. Maimonides was not an historian. The logical bent of his mind was frequently impatient with the accidental turns of historical events. Even his philosophic master, Aristotle, had not developed a philosophy of history and had claimed that epic poetry "is more philosophical and earnest than history." Nevertheless, Aristotle himself could not refrain from applying the historical method to his investigations in the field of political theory. As is well known, he collected constitutions enacted in various Greek city states over a period of several generations and examined them critically before proceeding to derive there- from general conclusions. For Maimonides the urge to engage in similar researches existed in an even higher degree. His most significant contribution consisted in the recodification of tradi- tional law. Such law being bound up with tradition and tradition being a primary historical factor, the nexus between law and history was easily given. Indeed, the Arab chronicler Tabari, for one example, devoted his prolific literary output to the two major fields, his interpretation of the Koran in the light of tradi- tion and his famous historical work. That is why Maimuni's general repudiation of historical literature as found in the follow- ing statement: "It is sheer waste of time; as in the case of books found among the Arabs describing historical events, the govern- ment of kings and Arab genealogy, or books of songs and similar 3 This lack of "originality" in Maimuni's historical approach explains also the total absence of studies on this subject in the vast literature on the medieval sage. A few general remarks and more or less incidental references will be found, especially, in BB and Bacher, Die Agada in Maimunis Werken in MbM II, 131-97. 7</page><page sequence="4">BARON works which neither possess wisdom nor yield profit for the body, but are merely a waste of time,"4 calls for a specific explanation. We can no longer be satisfied with the reason advanced by Geiger that "Arabian historiography of that time with its anec- dotes and tales appeared to him as worthless." Geiger, writing in 1850, was familiar with only a few, rather inferior Arabian historical writings, and shared the general prejudice against them voiced by European scholars from the days of Gibbon. It was after 1850 that most of the significant historical contribu- tions of the Arabs before and after Maimonides have become available to the western public in editions and translations. Maimonides may have looked down with contempt upon the anecdotal type of history which filled many volumes with lurid tales of intrigues and love affairs of prominent caliphs and vizirs, such as were included even in Ibn Miskaiwaihi's The Experiences of Nations. But he must have recognized the profound quest for truth and honest philosophic attitude of an all-embracing historian such as Al-Mas'udi. He must also have known of Al-Biruni's attempt to develop a scientific, almost "mathematical method of historiography." Neither could he have wished to deprecate the works of the great Arabian historians of religion, beginning with Al-Mas'udi's disciple Mutahdar al-Maqdasi who around 966 wrote his Book of Creation and of History. It is not unlikely that Maimuni knew of the Spaniard Ibn Hazm and of his own older contemporary Al-Shahrastani.5 4 C.M. to Sanh.

This juxtaposition of history, public law, government, genealogy and poetry is truly characteristic of the Arabic letters of the period. For Maimuni's sharp antagonism even to Hebrew poetry modelled after Arabic patterns, cf. especially his Resp. No. 370. He also rebuked the superficiality of a reader who, in his opinion, glanced over the contents of Scripture as if he "were reading an historical work or some poetic composition." M. N. I, 2. Cf. also ibid. III, 8 and 39. s Among recent surveys cf. especially D. S. Margoliouth, Lectures on Arabic Historians, Calcutta 1930 and the stimulating methodological discussion in M. K. Ayad, Geschichts- und Gesellschaftslehre Ibn Halduns, Stuttgart 1930. Unfortunately our knowledge of Maimunis Arabic readings is extremely 8</page><page sequence="5">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES Nor were Jewish historians altogether lacking. In Abraham ibn Daud, his distinguished philosophical predecessor, he could have found a guide also to historical investigations. While by no means measuring up to the standards of the classical Arabian historians, the Book of Tradition furnished a careful historical survey of the literary leaders of the people. In Abraham bar Hiyya and Yehudah Halevi, whose works he undoubtedly knew, Maimuni also had before him significant attempts at reshaping the Jewish conception of history in accordance with the new demands. Abraham bar Hiyya especially, confronted in Spain not only with Arabian but Christian historical reconstructions, developed a theory of Jewish history which adapted Augustinian and Isidorian teachings to Jewish needs. His philosophy of history might have stimulated further historical thinking were it not perhaps for the transcending influence of the "unhistorical" Maimonidean thought.6 limited. His direct citations are even fewer than those from Jewish sources The available investigations, moreover, of the affinities of Maimonidean philosophy to that of the Kalam, Avicenna, Alfarabi or Averrois, however meritorious in themselves, throw little light on the question of Maimuni's direct indebtedness to the works of his predecessors. The literary output of the Arabs had become so enormous that Samau'al ibn Yahya rightly asserted that it was impossible for a man to master all that was written in a single branch of science. Cf. M. Schreiner, Samau'al ben Yahja al-Magribi und seine Schrift "Ifham al-Yahud" MGWJ XLII (1898) p. 172. In view also of the far-reaching specialization, one may readily assume that Maimuni, like every other educated person in his day, read not only the famous classics, but many less substantial writings (cf. e. g., his statement quoted in note 14), of which only a small part has come down to us. Only a minute expert exami- nation of the few direct and the many indirect references in his works may yield valuable clues to his intellectual background. 6 Maimonides' familiarity with Abraham bar Hiyya's Megillat ha-Megalle, was deduced from a reference to a messianic computation in I. T. by A. Geiger, Moses ben Maimon I, Breslau 1850 (=Nachgel. Schriften III, 34-96), note 53 and Jacob Guttmann, Uber Abraham bar Chijas "Buch der Enthiil- lung" MGWJ XLVII (1903) p. 453. This reference as well as the similarity of the Maimonidean doctrine concerning the degrees in prophecy with that of Bar Hiyya may be inconclusive, as pointed out by Jul. Guttmann in his introduction to the edition of the Megillat ha-Megalle pp. XXIII ff., but one may perhaps find more convincing evidence in another passage. In I. T. pp. 18 ff. (Kobes II, 2a), Maimuni sketches the history of three religions</page><page sequence="6">BARON It is the peculiarity of Abraham bar Hiyya's method which may offer us a partial explanation for Maimonides' ret- icence. Abraham bar Hiyya, following numerous Arabian his- torians, combined the study of astrology with that of history and tried to explain many historical developments through the positive or negative influence of stars.7 Maimonides, a harsh opponent of that "lie against reason," sharply condemned all attempts not only to prognosticate the future, but also to project such astrological prognostications into the past.8 He may also have felt a certain aversion to the Arabic historical writings, because, no matter how universalist in compass, they were dogmatically restricted by the teachings of Islam and contained many a derogatory utterance on the subject of Judaism. In some instances the glowing descriptions of the lives of Muhammed and the other heroes of Islam and the glorification of Muslim political and cultural power undermined the belief of Jewish which arose after Judaism, namely Christianity, Manichaeism and Islam, in a fashion strikingly similar to that of Bar Hiyya. The singling out of these three creeds (although Mani is not mentioned by name in I. T.) as repre- senting three important historical movements; the interpretation of Dan. 11.14 as referring to Jesus (Meg. ha-Meg. p. 136); the acceptance of Jesus' execution as a fact and the explanation that it was merely the result of his transgressions (ibid.: ulyl lsn=r no rin z'); the emphasis upon the inefficacy of Mani's preachment (ibid. p. 145: 'o, iitN mhi '' lRu 13Din N' i) and that upon Muhammed's seizure of power through lies and the force of arms (ibid.: nvnSl a-in nnl nrT mp5pSn= m5n niri n p,'rnn nrl mraln: yiPn)-are all resem- blances too close to be merely accidental. Cf. also note 8. 7 Cf. especially his justification of that method ibid. p. 115. Apart from Muslim historians and astrologers, such as Yakubi and Abu Maashar (the likely influence of the latter on Bar Hiyya is emphasized by M. Steinschneider, Hebrdische ibersetzungen, p. 572), a curious Latin epistle, apparently written in Spain by Bar Hiyya's contemporary, John Avendeath, the famous trans- lator (a professing or baptized Jew), offers interesting parallels. Cf. F. Baer, Eine jiidische Messiasprophetie auf das Jahr 1186 und der dritte Kreuzzug MGWJ LXX (1926) pp. 113-22 and 155-65. 8 For Maimonides' views on astrology cf. especially A. Marx, The Corre- spondence between the Rabbis of Southern France and Maimonides about Astrology HUC Annual III (1926) pp. 311-58. In I. T. pp. 39 ff. (Kobeq II, 5b) he specifically repudiated astral influences on history, as assumed by his Yemenite correspondents. It is not impossible, however, that he also had Bar Hiyya in mind. 10</page><page sequence="7">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES youth. Samau'al ibn Yabya al-Maghribi actually tells us that in his early youth he had first read many historical novels and then proceeded to study the more reliable historical chronicles of Al-Miskaiwaihi and Tabari which eventually led him to apostasy. We have reason to believe that Maimonides was familiar with the polemical work of this his older contemporary.9 Other more fundamental factors contributed to checking the influence of the Arabian historians on the Jews. True to the basically political orientation of Islam and the needs of the Caliphate the Arab historical literature was essentially political. Not only those works which dealt with political history as such -and these were the majority-but also the various biographical collections or those dealing with the history of philosophers, physicians and sectarians had a decidedly political tinge. Careful genealogical investigations were imperative under the system of state grants extended to the descendants of Muhammed and his closest companions. Since Omar I the subsidies varied in accordance with the degree of relationship. Not until Ibn Khaldun's sociological interpretation of history, moreover, did Arab historiography fully emancipate itself from the tradition of the early chroniclers to write history in terms of the deeds of individual monarchs, generals and religious leaders. Non- political Judaism lacked such incentives. It, too, was prone to record a few acts of outstanding individuals, but these were so deeply imbedded in the general flow of tradition that they hardly lent themselves to extensive biographical and still less to comprehensive historical treatment. Although on the whole still as insistent upon family purity and noble descent (yihus) as it had been in the Sassanian age, Judaism under Islam had few vested interests in genealogy. Neither did it have the stimuli given by the dynastic-religious struggle over the legitimacy of succession to the prophet, which so long dominated all public affairs of the Muslim world. Whatever the reasons, Maimonides undoubtedly was con- sciously "unhistorical." Unconsciously, however, he could not help referring to the history of his people when he wished to 9 Cf. Schreiner, op. cit., pp. 127 and 412. 11</page><page sequence="8">BARON explain certain contemporary phenomena. Sometimes he con- strued new historical hypotheses, in order to elucidate obscure phases in Jewish law, the oppressed position of his people or perplexing features in the outside world. The following summary of his historical views and opinions, arranged in a more or less chronological order, may give us an inkling of his type of his- torical approach.I1 II. THE EARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND. The early days of humanity before Abraham were of interest to Maimonides only from the point of view of the origins of the various religions and their influence on the subsequent legislation in ancient Israel. Although he acknowledged, as is well known, that by strictly philosophic arguments the creation of the world can neither be proved nor disproved, he believed that creation ex nihilo at a certain date was an indubitable historical fact. He even followed the rabbinic chronology that about 2500 years elapsed from Adam to Moses. It is characteristic that the personality of the first man attracted his attention only to a slight degree. He pays little attention to the innumerable legends found in the Talmud and the Midrashim concerning Adam and Eve. He only mentions the court's injunction to witnesses in the case of capital prosecu- tion concerning the purpose of the creation of a single man and the continuous basic similarity of the shape of all men, which nevertheless leaves room to endless facial variations. God wanted to demonstrate that he who destroys one person should be placed IO It is needless to say that only the significant references in Maimuni's works to a person or event in the past will be listed here. In checking up the sources of his information attention will be paid primarily to the Baby- lonian Talmud which had for him great, almost "canonical" authority. On the other hand, it has long been recognized that Maimuni had greater famili- arity with and appreciated more deeply the older tannaitic sources and the Palestinian Talmud than the majority of his halakic contemporaries and successors. Cf. now, especially, L. Finkelstein, Maimonides and the Tannaitic Midrashim JQR N. S. XXV (1935) pp. 469-517 and J. N. Epstein, Mechilta and Sifre in the Works of Maimonides Tarbiz VI (1934-5) pp. 99-138. 12</page><page sequence="9">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES on a par with one who destroys the entire world and that every- one should be entitled to claim that the world was created for his sake." Maimuni also gives the following very interesting explanation for the sanctity of the Temple in Jerusalem. "It is a tradition accepted by everyone," he states, "that the place where David and Solomon built the altar in the threshing floor of Araunah is the place on which Abraham had erected his altar and offered Isaac, and where Noah had built when he left the ark. This is the very altar on which Cain and Abel had offered and on which Adam, too, had brought a sacrifice when he was created; and this was precisely the spot from which he was created. As the sages said, Adam was created from the place of his atonement."12 It is evident that Maimonides believed that Adam was a monotheist worshiping the God of Israel. He speaks in another connection of the six commandments which God imposed upon Adam, namely the five prohibitions of idolatry, blasphemy, murder, incest, robbery and the obligation to preserve law and order. Thereafter Noah received the additional commandment forbidding the consumption of a part cut off from a living animal (,nn 1]D in2). Through this historical hypothesis Maimonides, following the Aggadah,I3 evades the difficulty arising from the frequently contradictory talmudic computations concerning the six or seven commandments of the sons of Noah. " M. T. Sanhedrin 12, 3, closely following the text in M. Sanh. IV, 5. Maimuni, however, not only characteristically omits the other purposes enumerated in the Mishnah, but also changes: niDl' m ' n rnami irn 5i: l=' 01yn .Nr 3 ',',=m into uDri l 3' which lends it a different emphasis. It is possible that he stresses a l ynl n nnK v9 in order to oppose certain texts limiting it to: 5tnv'w. Cf. o'NmD 'pplpi p. 100 n. '. The chronological basis of Maimuni's date will be discussed later on. For various Arab computations of the period which elapsed between Noah and Abraham, cf. e. g., Maqdasi, Le livre de la creation et de l'histoire, ed. and transl. by Cl. Huart, 6 vols. Paris 1899-1919 III, 47. 12 M. T. Bet ha-Behirah 2, 2. The general source is Pesikta r. 31 and Palestinian Targum to Gen. 22.9. Cf. also Pirke R. Eliezer 12. The last quotation is from Gen. r. 14, 9 (ed. Theodor-Albeck p. 132) based upon the Aggadah in j. Nazir VII, 2, 56b. 13 Cf. the long list in GL V, 92 n. 55. 13</page><page sequence="10">BARON If idolatry was thus outlawed from the very beginning, how can we explain the rise of the pagan religions? This question engaged Maimonides' attention throughout his life and he tried to obtain as much information as possible on the early history of religion. "I have also read," he says, "on the subject of all idolatry; it seems to me that there has not remained a work on this topic written in Arabic [or] translated from other languages, which I have not read, examined its contents and grasped its full meaning."'4 Unfortunately, he does not seem to have read this literature very critically and most of his assumptions seem to be based upon spurious or otherwise unreliable writings. Among these the Nabatean Agriculture occupies a most prominent place. In his systematic fashion he sifted the data supplied by these sources and organized them into a full theory concerning the origin of paganism, which he repeated in various formulations in his Commentary on the Mishnah, his Code and most extensively in his Guide.'s In its briefest form, as given in the introduction to the laws pertaining to idolaters, this theory runs as follows: In the days of Enosh'6 people have committed a grievous error. Enosh and 14 1-1pv it ,ivnn n 'm n-7iw n- ninnl -mn-n It D'-im-7u nwn KvW 'mnln ipT noD 1K it nlr := 1 t i&lt; 61P2n3 y n1K r mrn -nny nn Dun n3DD Ypt' ID)m D 01 D P'3D1 nn r nm=n am t3 hi ', nmD1 nl i nr nm.=t ,l,yp 5 'nnip Ona .I',' i: nT ,6c' ns,' rnn 33 l niy =n-i ini t nwnpw Ty nl:i6 mwHnD inli ip,nynvt =~vy l1I62- ri 1"Yn ?ly1 iny7 liD rTy. Marx, op. cit., p. 351 (with slight variations Kobes II, 25ab). The juxtaposition of astrology with idolatry is characteristic of Maimuni's views on the history of religion. If the works quoted in M. N. III, 29 ff. should serve as a sample of these readings, he seems to have been rather uncritical in the selection of authentic documents revealing the early growth of pagan cults. There is a real need of a fresh reexamination of the influence of works, such as the Nabatean Agriculture and the Book Tomtom, on Maimuni in the light of our present day knowledge, to supplement the investigations of D. Chwolson, Die Ssabier and der Ssabismus, 2 vols., St. Petersburg 1856. Cf. also notes 5 and 20. I5 Cf. especially C. M. to 'Abodah Zarah IV, 7; M. T. 'Abodat Kokabim 1, 1.2; M. N. III, 29-49. 16 This date is obviously derived from the numerous aggadic interpretations of Gen. 4.26.

GL V, 151 assumes that Maim- 14</page><page sequence="11">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES his associates among the sages of that generation reasoned that, since God had created the stars and the spheres to guide the world and placed them in a high position as servants doing his will, they must be worthy of praise and reverence. It undoubtedly is his will that people pay homage to those whom He had elevated, just as an earthly king regards it as a tribute to himself when his counselors are honored. Thereupon they began building temples to the stars, offered to them and exalted them in prayers, all in order to comply with what they erroneously thought to be the will of God. "And this was the very core of idolatry." After a time there arose among them false prophets, who demanded in the name of God that there be erected an image and that the entire people with its women and children worship in front of it. So they invented images of stars, caused their erection in temples, under trees and on mountain tops, and persuaded the people that these idols were capable of helping or harming them. Still later, there began arising other liars who announced that onides referred to some older sources, although Hekalot 6, 173 and Shab 118b: vi~= (rather than Bmt -nt~ cf. D',1iD 'pvTp~) are somewhat dubious. Cf. also ibid. p. 153. It is not unlikely, however, that this emphasis was due to an intentional rejection of the theory of the hereditary transfer of the pro- phetic soul. This theory, evolved by the Shiya to legitimize the Alides' dynastic aspirations, contended that Enosh received the light from Seth and bequeathed it to a prophet or imam of each subsequent generation until Muhammed. Cf. Mas'udi, Les prairies d'or, 2 vols., Paris 1861-3, I, 69-71. Although rejected by most other Muslim schools (Tabari, for example, empha- sizes in his Chronique, French transl. H. Zotenberg I, Paris 1867, p. 88, "Know ye that both Enosh and Kenan were kings of the whole earth, but were not prophets."), this doctrine found its way into Jewish philosophy through Bar Hiyya and Halevi (Meg. ha-Meg.'p.'72: nmrnin nrinm nmIn nrn l'mn yiY1 ... rp, m13Nlm vuma nrn; Al-Khazari I, 95, etc. Cf. B. Ziemlich, Abr. b. Chija und Jehuda Halevi MGWJ XXIX, 1880, pp. 366-74; Jac. Guttmann, op. cit., pp. 465f. and Jul. Guttmann, Introduction to Meg. ha-Meg., pp. XXIf.), but had no place in the comprehensive Maimonidean theory of prophecy. Maimuni also ridicules the "Sabean" assumption that it was Seth who began worshiping the moon against the wish of his father, Adam (M. N. III, 29). Cf. also further on note 19. The general interpretation, however, that the images were the second stage evolved out of the wish plastically to represent the stars and the rest of the theory concerning the rise of the astral cults appears to be largely his own. 15</page><page sequence="12">BARON that very star, sphere or angel'7 had spoken to them and asked that it be worshiped in such and such a fashion. In the course of time different rituals devoted to the worship of many such idols originated in various parts of the world. Soon the name of God himself was forgotten and the populace knew only those images of wood and stone and those temples built of stone in whose worship it had grown up. Their scholars and priests finally believed that there actually was no god but the stars and spheres for whose sake those images had been made. There remained but a few select individuals, such as Enoch,'8 Methuselah, Noah, Shem and Eber, who still recognized the one and only God. These men, although not prophets in the technical sense, because never recipients of direct orders from God, served as teachers and guides for their few associates.'9 The idolatrous majority, in Maimonides' opinion, was greatly steeped in magic and astrology. Its entire worship was based upon magically conjuring the celestial bodies to comply with its will. Magic rites and astrology were widespread among the Sabeans, Chaldeans, Egyptians, Canaanites and the other nations, but found place neither in the works of the Greek philosophers, "who were unquestionably wise men," nor in those of the Persians.20 Sabean worship frequently included orgiastic I7 This identification of stars with spheres and angels (for the meaning of this term cf. especially M. N. II, 6) is here, of course, an anachronism. 18 Maimonides rationalistically insists that Enoch's ascension, like that of Elijah later, meant death (Kobe, II, 34c; cf. n. 29). Whether the brevity of the assertion concerning Enoch in contrast with the full discussion about Elijah was accidental or else had a polemical slant against the Sabean glorifi- cation of Enoch-Hermes, is an open question. 19 M. N. III, 39. Here, as often throughout his writings, Maimuni anachron- istically ascribes a ]'rT n' or rvUrn to these and other ancient leaders to reconcile history with his legal requirement of collegiate action for certain legislative measures. Cf. Bacher in MbM II, 145. This insistence upon the infinite supremacy of Moses as a prophet is incidentally also in line with his rejection of continuous prophetic leadership in the pre-Mosaic age. 20 C. M. to 'Ab. Zarah IV, 7; M. N. III, 37 and Kobes II, 25ab. The name Sabeans is frequently used by Maimuni in a wider sense, i.e., the entire pagan world before Abraham; but, when placed along with names of other nations, it represents a specific ethnic-religious group (Munk III, 217 n. 1 fails to draw this distinction). It is questionable, however, whether Maimuni had 16</page><page sequence="13">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES cults, sacrifices of children and special prerogatives as well as costumes for their priests, all of which were found objectionable by the restorers of purified monotheism from Abraham to Moses. It is especially the Sabean cult which prevailed in the environ- ment of both the patriarch and the lawgiver and against which both of them took a firm stand.2I In fact, Maimonides thinks that this opposition of the founders of Judaism to the Sabean ritual explains many obscure points in Jewish law. In his daring attempt to find rational explanations for each and every detail of Mosaic law, Maimonides frequently refers to that intentional contrast. For example, shaving the ends of one's head and beard was prohibited because the idolatrous priests used to do so. Also the biblical taboos of kilaim and sha'atnez arose from the suppression of both Sabean priestly costumes and orgiastic rites which accompanied the grafting of one plant upon another. The distasteful sensuous cults, such as hinted at in the Bible in connection with the worship of Baal Peor, influenced the lawgiver to insist upon the wearing of trousers by officiating priests and certain requirements of abstinence.22 The Sabeans also had an unholy reverence for blood. On the one hand, they regarded it as extremely impure and on the other, they consumed at all in mind the pre-Islamic inhabitants of southern Arabia, of whose history and religion the Muslim world (except for a few natives, such as Hamdani) had very faint notions. For him the Sabeans were a distinct religio-philo- sophical trend which, tolerated by the successive Muslim governments, com- bined crude and primitive with advanced philosophical ideas. This unhistorical estimate of the Sabean religion was shared even by such Arab experts as Shahrastani. Cf. vol. II part I and the remarks of the translator, Haarbruecker, in his preface to that volume. Cf. also Al-Biruni, The Chronology of Ancient Nations, Engl. transl. E.

Thus when he tries to explain the otherwise irrational prohibition of mixing meat with milk, he advances first the medical reason that it causes overfulness, then immediately reverts to his general theory that it was intended to counteract a Sabean custom and adds significantly: "This I consider the best reason for this prohibition, although in the books on Sabean rites which I have read there is no men- tion of this custom."24 He justifies such assumptions on the ground that the pagan priests of the pre-Abrahamic days com- posed many writings which were known to the early Jewish legislators but have since largely been lost. "If we knew all the particulars of this [the Sabean] worship and were informed of all the details of those doctrines, we would clearly see the wisdom of every detail in the sacrificial service, in the laws concerning impurity and in other laws the objective of which I am unable to state."2s 23 They stressed the impurity of blood to the extreme of isolating completely a menstruating woman and declaring impure any person that spoke to her or was touched by a wind that passed over her. For their sacrifices of wild animals and their ritualistic consumption of blood Maimuni quotes as his source the allegedly Indian book Tomtom. Cf. M. N. III, 41 and 46 and Munk III, 240 n. 1. BB p. 137 n. 1 points out that this interpretation of Lev. 3.26 is found already in Ibn Ezra and that Maimuni himself in his halakic writings prefers to follow the hermeneutic application of this verse to a rebellious son. Cf. S. M. Prohibition 165 and M. T. Mamrim 7, 1. 24 M. N. III, 48. The only substantiation he offers is the propinquity of two of the three verses prohibiting the seething of a kid in its mother's milk with those enjoining the three annual pilgrimages to Jerusalem. 25 M. N. III, 49. Like everybody else at that time Maimuni believed in the early spread of writing, although he did not mention the legends current among the Arabs (e.g., Mas'udi, op. cit., p. 73) concerning the thirty-one, twenty-nine and thirty leaves handed by God to Adam, Seth and Enoch respectively. Tabari (Chronique, p. 86) records a tradition going back to Muhammed that God sent down altogether 114 books: 50 to Adam and Seth, 30 to Noah, 20 to Abraham and 10 to various other prophets. Among these 10 books were the Pentateuch, the Gospels, the Psalms and The Koran. Maimuni may have seen therein a reflection on the uniqueness of the Torah which was given in full to Moses (see further on note 75), although some Arabs 18</page><page sequence="15">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES The change came when Abraham, the "pillar of the world," arose among the Sabeans. Hardly weaned from the breast, he began speculating day and night on the motions of the spheres and the necessary existence of a supreme power determining those motions. Maimonides finds evidence for the story of Abraham not only in the biblical records and the Aggadah, but also in the distorted accounts contained in the Sabean writings. Eventually, at the age of forty the patriarch, inspired by God's word and distinguished by excellent qualities of mind and char- acter, arose against the superstitious creed of his environment and destroyed the idols.26 He soon began propagandizing his faith with great success.27 After enduring severe persecutions on the part of the king (Nimrod), he went to Palestine where were ready to concede that, in contrast to those stray leaves, the Pentateuch was the first real book. Cf. e.g., Shahrastani-Haarbruecker, op. cit., I, 48. He admits, however, in speaking of Abraham w'nsD 1= inm. M. T. 'Abodat Kokabim 1, 3. He probably refers to the book on idolatry which according to 'Ab. Zarah 14b was written by Abraham and consisted of 400 chapters. 26 M. T. ibid.; M. N. III, 29. Cf. also Bacher's comments, MbM II, 148 ff. The alleged Sabean tradition that Abraham was born in Kutha =Ur is found also in B. B. 91a and in non-Sabean Arabic sources. Cf. Munk III, 219 n. 6 and GL V, 211 n. 20. Maqdasi, op. cit. III, 53 calls it Kutha Rabba in the cultivated territory of Kufa. Cf. also Huart, ibid., n. 1. The non-commital, nnrt lp,, is evidently due to the contradictory rabbinic legends, listed by Ginzberg p. 209 n. 13 which seem to have escaped the attention of RABD ad loc. The date of forty years instead of the forty-eight given in Gen. r. 30, 8 which greatly troubled the medieval commentators (Maimuni Glosses and Kesef Mishneh; cf. Zacuto, Yuhasin 5a: nrwn KDti npv) seems to have been Maimonides' own correction perhaps on the basis of m;rn 'synm 1I (Abot V), as suggested by Bacher, p. 149 n. 1. Maqdasi III, 49 speaks of fifteen years as the age at which Abraham left the cave and, coming among men, began to reflect on religious problems. Tabari (Chronique, pp. 128 ff.) asserts that Abraham at the age of fifteen months was as tall as a boy of fifteen, and that in his day the whole world was steeped in astrology. 27 Resp.

In this respect he simply followed a custom prevalent among the pagans of his day. However, to counteract the prevailing worship of the sun in which the worshippers usually turned east, he placed his altar in the western direction, thus adumbrating the position of the future Holy of Holies in the Temple of Jerusalem.28 In his very death he exemplified the doctrine of immortality, inasmuch as his soul joined the righteous ones among his forefathers, while his body was buried with those of his descendants.29 On the whole, he was an outstanding prophet in his own right, although he did not appear, as did Moses after him, with an express message from God. One can easily perceive the Maimonidean emphasis upon the superiority of Moses over Abraham as against the notions current among the Muslims concerning the fuller revelation in the days of "Ibrahim." Nevertheless, as the first believer in the one and only God, Abraham really deserves that "most people, as we see at present, agree in praising him and in being proud of him; so that even those who are not his descendants call themselves by his name."30 28 M. N. III, 45. Cf. Munk III, 468 f. The Muslims, too, generally believed that Abraham, after the "sacrifice" of Isaac, built the Temple on that moun- tain. Cf. Koran II, 121; Mas'udi, op. cit. I, 87, etc. Only few preferred to leave the question open as to whether Ishmael or Isaac were the"sacrifice." Cf. Tabari, Chronique, p. 171. According to Abraham Maimuni, his father rejected the computation of the Aggadah (cf. the passages listed in Theodor- Albeck, op. cit., pp. 587 f. note), that Isaac was then thirty-seven years old, because this would have shifted the burden of the sacrifice from Abraham to him. Cf. S. Eppenstein, Beitrage zur Pentateuchexegese Maimunis in MbM I, 414. 29 Kobes II, 34a. For a defense of the authenticity of the ;nnn;in 'pjn written in the late years of Maimuni's life cf. Bacher, The Treatise of Eternal Bliss attributed to Moses Maimuni, JQR IX (1896-7) pp. 270-89. 30 M. N. III, 29. While Maimuni allows here for certain exceptions, Maq- dasi, op. cit., III, 51 recklessly asserts that "there is now no one of whatever creed who denies Abraham (may peace rest upon him) and who does not follow him in his prayers."

For instance, when he enjoins his readers to be reticent in matters of sex and wherever possible not to speak of them at all, he quotes the aggadic reference to the extreme innocence of Jacob.3I In another connection, in trying to prove that a prophet must be of a serene mind and mood, he quotes the example of Jacob who at the time when he feared the encounter with Esau or when he mourned for Joseph was abandoned by the spirit of prophecy.32 Jacob is also held up as a shining example of a conscientious laborer who devotes all his energy to the task assigned to him by his employer.33 At the same time Esau, generally pictured as an evildoer, was nevertheless rewarded for honoring his father. That is why he not only became the founder of the kingdom of Edom, but his descendants were to hold a high position in the world thereafter. In part, as Amalekites, they were to be destroyed and their name blotted out, but other sections were to survive in Edom and later to achieve greatness through Rome and the Catholic Church much more frequent in the Aggadah and even has scriptural backing in II Chr. 20.7. Cf. GL V, 207 n. 4. In the Arabic S. M. Comm. 3, however, perhaps under the impact of prevalent Muslim usuage, he uses the term anim rendered by the Hebrew translator by otn mnl of the Chronicles, but he quotes Is. 41.8. C. M. to Abot V, 3 enumerates the ten "trials" of Abraham. Discarding all the supernatural features of the well-known ancient legends (for their var- iations cf. Schechter's note to his edition of Ab. R.N. 34, 94 f. and GL V, 218 n. 52), Maimuni gives a full list of human tribulations, all recorded in Scripture. 31 M. N. III, 8, quoting a variation of the statement of Yeb. 76a; Gen. r. 98, 4 and 99, 3 (Theodor-Albeck, pp. 1253 and 1257); Agadat Bereschit 82, etc. Another example is adduced from Elisha, in accordance with the homilet- ical explanation of mvip in II Kings 4.9 Ber. lOb, etc. 32 C.

It also intends to illustrate by a specific example the precarious position of a people which chooses to be governed by kings of alien stock.35 In the days of Jacob and his sons the claim of the Jews to Palestine was already well established. Setting an example for a later custom, Jacob and Joseph, at their death in Egypt, com- manded that their bones be buried in the sacred soil of Palestine.36 More, Jacob and his sons, while occupying Canaanite territories could already demand from the natives, as did their successors in the days of Joshua, not only complete submission and annual 34 I.

Krauss, Die hebraischen Benennungen der fremden V6lker, Jewish Studies in Memory of G. A. Kohut, N. Y. 1935, pp. 379-412. This identification, although denied by Saadia (Saadia's Polemic against Hivvi al-Balkhi, ed. by I. Davidson, N. Y. 1915, p. 76), was widely accepted in medieval Jewry and penetrated even the Muslim world. Cf. e.g., Mas'udi, op. cit., I, 89 f., where the 550 years of Roman domination over the Jews (approximately 70-620 C. E.) are explained as the result of Jacob's fear of Esau. Also the belief that Esau-Rome will be given dominion until the days of the Messiah is widespread in the Aggadah. Cf. e.g., Pesikta r. ed. Friedmann p. 50a and the editor's remarks and Bacher, Pal. Amorder I, 525 n. 7. Cf. also GL V, 272 n. 19, 278 n. 51, 304 n. 246, etc. That this admission comes also from Maimuni, however, despite his con- siderable anti-Christian animus is quite remarkable. 35 M. N. III, 50.

With the violation of one such commandment, namely the prohibition of robbery by Shechem, Maimonides motivates the punitive measures taken by Simon and Levi, since according to the law, as codified by himself, the conquered natives who violate one of the commandments are subject to extinction by the force of arms.37 In the meantime the body of commandments imposed upon the Jews was steadily growing. To the seven Noahide command- ments was added in the days of Abraham that of circumcision. Abraham was particularly fit to be the initiator of that custom, because he was a man of great moral restraint, and the major aim of circumcision consisted in counteracting the sexual appe- tite. From that time on this commandment became obligatory for all true descendants of Abraham which excluded Ishmael and Esau, but included the sons of Keturah. As the descendants of Keturah, Maimonides argues, had since been absorbed by the other Arabic tribes, the Arabs are likewise bound to observe this rite on the eighth day after birth-evidently a recognition of contemporary practice with a polemical point in regard to the age.38 Abraham has also added the morning prayer as an obliga- 37 M. T. Melakim 9, 14 in connection with ibid. 6, 1 and 9, 9. Maimuni seems to attempt here a new historical justification, unsupported by the Aggadah, incidentally provoking also Nabmanides' opposition on juridical grounds. Cf. the latter's Commentary on Gen. 34.13. 38 M. N. III, 49, following the old interpretation of Gen. 12.11 (Pal. Targum, B. B. 16a, etc.) concerning Abraham's chastity. (In C. M. to Abot V, 19 he renders against the general view the ,r6i w s of the Mishnah by ni-nr = sexual self-control and declares it to have been along with moderation and humility the outstanding virtue of the patriarch, while the opposite was true of Balaam). The theory concerning the purpose of circumcision, however, seems to be Maimonides' own contribution, since he scarcely had any knowl- edge of Philo's similar assumption, quoted by Munk, III, 417 n. 4. It is of interest to note that the theory combated here is found not only in Saadia (see Munk n. 2), but also in the Aggadah. Cf. e.g., Gen. r. 43, 7 (Theodor- Albeck, p. 420) about Melchizedek 5imno -rlW inlI ,:an pnx, "ti ' v I n and Gen. r. 46, 1 (p. 458) concerning Abraham himself.

Isaac followed his example by imposing the segregation of the tithe and an afternoon prayer. Jacob finally added the prohibition of the nervus ischiadicus (gid ha-nasheh) and instituted an evening prayer.39 On his deathbed he spe- cifically enjoined his sons to adhere strictly to the unity of God.40 He also appointed one of them, Levi, head of an academy to teach the way of God and the observance of the Abrahamitic law.4I In the following generations the Israelites, then in Egyptian bondage, were nonetheless frequently derelict in the observance of the laws. The majority abandoned even the practice of cir- cumcision and wholly relapsed into idolatry by adopting the Egyptian mode of life. Only the tribe of Levi maintained the M. T.

That the children of Keturah lived, at least in part, on the Arabian Peninsula is a widely accepted tradition in the Aggadah. Cf. the numerous, often contra- dictory views expressed in the sources, listed in GL V, 264 f. n. 309 ff. The Arabs themselves, although generally claiming descent from Ishmael, conceded a certain relationship to the sons of Keturah. Cf. e.g., Mas'udi, op. cit. I, 80. They also contended that they ought to follow Ishmael's example and perform the rite of circumcision at the age of thirteen. It is partly against such claims that Maimuni somewhat forcedly interprets Gen. 21.13 in I. T. Kobes II, 3d (ed. Holub p. 29 mutilated). 39 M. T. Melakim 9, 1, primarily based upon Ber. 16b. For the other sources cf. Bacher, MbM II, 150 n. 7. The pleasing symmetry in Maimuni's arrangements evoked the opposition of RABD who, on the basis of Gen. 14.20, ascribed the introduction of tithes to Abraham rather than Isaac.

III. THE LAW OF MOSES. In Moses the history of Israel and of mankind reaches its climactic achievement. Moses was not only a great leader- Maimonides calls him "king"43-and lawgiver from whom the entire system of written and oral law had sprung, but most of all a great prophet. In the well-known Maimonidean theory of prophecy there are eleven degrees of prophetic gifts, the lowest of which were occasionally shared by non-Jews, but the highest being reserved for the ancient Israelitic prophets. Above all these, however, stood Moses who has come nearer the divine presence than any mortal before or after. In four fundamental aspects the prophetic gifts of Moses so radically differed from those of other prophets that we apply the term prophet to him only as a homonym. Moses was also the only man who performed miracles and received the revelation "publicly in the presence of 42 I. S. 7a; M. T. 'Abodat Kokabim 1, 3 and Melakim 9, 1; M. N. III, 46.

Bacher, MbM II, 150 n. 7 suggests that Maimuni had in mind Sotah 12a where Amram is called nrin bln (in the parallel passages Ex. r. 1, 13 and 19 this title is used interchangeably with 1'n'mD WiN cf. also GL V, 394 n. 27 and 396 n. 37) which seems to intimate that he was the recipient of divine commandments concerning marriage and divorce. Apart from the arbitrariness of this assumption, it is wholly disproved by Maimonides' views concerning the great freedom of sex relationships before the Mosaic legislation.

In this sense he was the true "seal of prophecy."46 Little wonder that the Jewish people swears in the name of Moses to the present day.47 Personally Moses was distinguished by many traits of char- acter. Most of all he was extremely humble. Like his talmudic predecessors, Maimonides takes pains to point to Moses' humility -the only virtue whose very exaggeration is meritorious-as a shining example for all judges and leaders of Israel.48 Moses was also ready to take the part of an oppressed against his oppressor regardless of personal danger. He and his brother Aaron were early forewarned by God that they were chosen 44 Especially C. M. to Sanh. X Introd.; M. T. Yesode ha-Torah 7, 6; M. N. II, 31.

Maimuni uses the expression DDtU 1i nrnitn , (Tibbon: wwn 1 1 t n oyn) for Joshua's miracle, which strikingly resembles the ration- alization of Ibn Chiquitilla to Joshua 10.12. Cf. S.

When Moses occasionally lost his patience he was severely rebuked by God. In his inter- esting polemic with the radical condemnation of mass conversion under compulsion in his Epistle on Conversion he cites the example of Moses who was severely reprimanded by God for doubting that the people of Israel would believe in his mission. This reprimand is the more remarkable the lower the Israelites had sunk in Egyptian bondage. In retaliation he was himself to be found guilty of disbelief in God's power to produce water out of a stone. Apart from being thereafter forced to abandon his leadership before the conquest of Palestine, he was temporarily stricken with leprosy at the time of uttering his doubts.49 As a leader he proceeded to reform his coreligionists while still in Egypt. In the first place, the masses of the non-Levitical Israelites had to undergo circumcision which Moses, assisted by Aaron and Joshua, personally performed. To complete the requirements established by law for the adoption of Judaism by proselytes, the Israelites after entering the desert had also to go through the ritual of baptism and to offer sacrifices.50 Through 49 M.

The emphasis inn'I rwynl may have been intended to counteract those aggadic statements which denied Moses' affliction with leprosy. Cf. GL V, 421 n. 132. He may also have considered the Muslim tradition that the Israelites suspected Moses of having been stricken with leprosy, but that God speedily rehabilitated him. Cf. Al-Bukhari, Le traditions islamiques, French transl. II (Paris 1906), p. 482. In another connection (C. M. Eight Chapters 4) Maimuni explains Moses' transgression at the waters of Meribah with his impatience in scolding the Israelite "rebels" (Num. 20.10).

The entire period of Egyptian bondage lasted, in Maimuni's opinion, 210 years. Some Israelites mistook, however, the original calculation of the 400 years and, anxious to leave Egypt, began marching ahead of time. This attempt ended disastrously. I.

M. to Abot V, 4 describes in great detail the "ten miracles" during the cross- ing of the Red Sea, and states that the Egyptians suffered there many more plagues than in Egypt proper, but that all these plagues belonged to the same ten kinds, as those originally inflicted. For the rabbinic sources cf. GL VI, 6 f. Although insisting that our knowledge of these events is based merely upon tradition, Maimuni tries to furnish from frequently very far-fetched passages biblical substantiation for all of them. 52 M.

In the first place, he separated the general group of Israelites from that of the Levites placing the sanctuary in the vanguard of the marchers.53 In constructing the Tabernacle he laid the foundations and established a prototype for the subsequent temples in Jerusalem. Indeed, his ultimate goal was the Temple in Zion whose location, previously selected by Abraham, was known to him and toward which he enjoined the Israelites to turn in their prayers.54 Fearing to impose upon the Jews a ritual made no attempt to explain the obvious conflict between theory and practice. Among his successors, Elijah Mizrahi suggested that the biblical prohibition referred exclusively to reimmigration from Palestine, but not from other countries. Cf. Glosses on Maimuni M. T. 1. c. The geographic boundaries are specifically given as bordering on Ethiopia and the desert. The size of 160,000 square parasangs is naturally not exact. 53 C. M. to Kelim I, 8 referring to Num. 1.50. This idea is amplified in Num. r. 1, 12 end. M. N. III, 50 gives the reason for the detailed biblical descriptions of Israel's journeys before they reached the Holy Land. The Torah thereby anticipated the incredulity of subsequent generations (as suggested by Munk IV, 431, n. 1, this is perhaps a dig at Hivi al-Balkhi whose rationalist explanation of the Manna is attacked by Ibn Ezra to Ex. 16.13; unfortunately the extant fragment of Saadia's Polemic does not contain queries on Exodus) and forewarned that the legends concerning Jewish aim- less wanderings in the desert were altogether baseless. Cf. BB p. 118. Maimuni does not hesitate, however, to declare that the "forty years" of the desert migration Num. 32.13 were in fact only thirty-eight years (Eppenstein, MbM I, 416: there is an apparent contradiction in the figures: 38 and t'). If this text is authentic, one may perceive Maimuni's compunction to count the first year which preceded the sending of spies and the last year which followed after Aaron's death. He may well have been familiar with the com- ments of not only Ibn Ezra but also R. Moses ha-Darshan quoted by Rashi to Num. 33.1. 54 M. T. Bet ha-Behirah 1, 1 emphasizing the temporary character of the Tabernacle, according to Deut. 12, 9 as explained in Sifre Deut. 66, Magillah 10a, etc. Cf. also Rashi ad loc. The idea that Moses introduced the Kibla M. T. Tefillah 1, 3 is derived, according to Karo, from a statement in the Baraita of R. Eliezer son of R. Jose the Galilean (possibly referring to The Mishnah of R. Eliezer, ed. H. G. Enelow, N. Y. 1933, p. 150, interpreting Ex. 20.18). However, Karo's reference to S. M. (probably Commandment 21) has no bearing on this subject. Neither is his doubt as to whether the 5:3 r',n mpo refers to the various locations of the sanctuary or to the place of the worshipers justified in view of the singular form. 29</page><page sequence="26">BARON whose exalted purity they could not possibly grasp, he included animal sacrifices in the worship at the tabernacle. Only to counteract the Egyptian reverence for the ram and the Sabean "preference" for sacrificing beasts of prey, he instituted the sacrifice of household cattle and, for the sake of the poor, of certain domesticated birds. On account of the bad odors con- nected with the slaughtering of numerous animals he added the various forms of incense and the oil of ointment.55 He was also the only one to prepare the sacred oil which was afterwards deposited in the containers held throughout the period of the first Temple. No oil other than that prepared by Moses himself was ever used for anointing kings and high priests. Once the original Mosaic oil was gone, the Second Commonwealth had to get along without ointment even for the high priests who had to substitute special vestments as an outward form of consecra- tion. The first vessels in the tabernacle were prepared for sacred use through that consecrated oil, but this practice was not repeated thereafter in the Temple.56 Moses erected an altar whose dimensions remained exemplary for the subsequent altars erected by Solomon and the returning Babylonian exiles, and which will serve as a model also for the fourth altar to be erected in the days of the Messiah. However, the material was different: "hollow" instead of "beaten work." Among the decorative arts employed by Moses the use of "cherubim" is especially worthy of notice because thereby "Moses clearly proclaimed the theory of the existence of a number of angels" which leads us to believe in prophecy and in the law and opposes idolatry. Maimonides 55 M. N. III, 45-46. This much debated theory seems to be Maimonides' original contribution to the "rational" explanation of biblical ceremonies. That the argument is essentially historical makes it doubly relevant to our discussion. 56 M. T. Kle ha-Mikdash 1, 1-12, based primarily on Ker. 5; Hor. lib; Shebuot 15a; Yoma 12b.

He, as the head of the council, was not included in that number. From that time on such a "sanhedrin" was a permanent feature of Jewish public law and every chairman, called nasi, was a deputy of the lawgiver himself.58 Moses also laid down for all future generations the fundamentals of warfare which, under God's direction, he had tried to humanize. For example, when he laid siege on Midian he was told to leave a path open for refugees that they might escape from the city.59 While he was ordered ruthlessly to exterminate the seven Pal- estinian nations and to swear vengeance to Amalek, he could deal more mildly with the Ammonites and Moabites. Although the Israelites were not to offer them peace-the legal preliminary of a declaration of war against other peoples-a spontaneous offer on their part was to be readily accepted.6o Moses was so 57 C.

In the first place, there were the six hundred and thirteen commandments of the written law. Of these six hundred and eleven were transmitted to Israel through Moses, while the first two of the ten commandments were addressed directly to the people. Even in the Decalogue, however, although it was proclaimed in the presence of the entire people, Moses was apostrophized as the main recipient. That is why the singular form is used. As a matter of fact, Moses alone heard the created voice distinctly, whereas to the rest of the people it was an attempts in vain to interpret M. T. as referring merely to an historical fact, that they actually refused to surrender. This theory appears untenable in the face of the tense of l'n,u and the very inclusion of this statement in the Code. It is more plausible that Maimuni again gave preference to the Mekilta on Deut. over the Sifre, as suggested by Finkelstein, op. cit., p. 492. This contravention of the most authoritative halakic sources is apparently due to Maimuni's views concerning the reasons for this harsh treatment. In M. T. I. c. and still more in M. N. III, 41 he transforms the historic hatred of the Israelites and the natives (including Amalek) into an ethical-religious safe- guard to prevent contamination through idolatry. It is evident that this aim could be fully accomplished through the surrender of these nations and their acceptance of the Noahide commandments, the first of which enjoins absten- tion from pagan beliefs and observances. 6I C. M. to Abot IV, 2 emphasizing that even a man so greatly endowed with pious achievement as Moses did not disdain to fulfill half a commandment, when the opportunity offered itself. Maimuni quotes to this effect a statement in Makkot 10a. Cf. also ibid. 9b; Sifre Num. 160; Tos. Makkot II, 1 and j. Makkot II, 7, 31d. M. T. Ro?eab u-Shemirat Nefesh 8, 2-4 adds the informa- tion that in the days of the Messiah nine cities of refuge will be allotted in the territory of the Kenizite, the Kenite and the Kadmoni which had been promised to Abraham, but were never incorporated into ancient Palestine.

Moses in turn ordained Joshua and his associates and instructed them in all these oral command- ments. From that time on an unbroken chain of tradition has brought down this oral law to the days of the Mishnah and Talmud.63 Some of these oral instructions are exemplified by occurrences in Moses' own lifetime. For example, family life, that "basic unit of society," was not thoroughly organized before Moses. In that primitive age "one met a woman in the market; if both agreed to marry, he took her into his house and informally made her his wife," or else "if they both agreed, he paid her a certain amount, cohabited with her on the road and went away." With the giving of the Torah marriage has been attached to a ceremony of acquisition in the presence of witnesses, while free intercourse without marriage was outlawed under the sanction of flagellation.64 The Israelites, present during the Sinaitic 62 S. M. Introd. 3 and Comm. 1; M. N. II, 33. The number 613 for the commandments, although perhaps not of tannaitic origin, was widely accepted in the talmudic and geonic period. The entire S. M. referring to the statement in Makkot 23b was devoted to their detailed enumeration. That only two of the Ten Commandments were heard by the entire people has the backing of some aggadic sources, as against others which maintain that all the nations could hear their annunciation on Sinai. Cf. GL VI, 30 n. 181 and 45 n. 243. In general, however, Maimuni extols the ,',D in IDyn (so used also in the Arabic context of M. N. II, 33) as a unique event in history, because of the participation in it of an entire nation as witnessed by friend and enemy. Especially in I. T. he waxes enthusiastic in the description of that glorious event. He pacified his philosophic conscience by the assumption of a "created voice" (Kobes II, 23d and M. N. I, 65; cf. Munk I, 290 n. 2). That there was a qualitative difference between Moses and the people even in the perception of this voice appears to Maimuni clearly indicated in the nuance of Onkelos' version, which for him has the indirect authority of a tannaitic source. 63 C. M. Introd.; M. T. Introd. and Sanh. 4, 1. For the details of this historic development underlying all Pharisaic and Rabbanite Judaism cf. further on. 64 S. M. Prohib. 365; M. T. Ishut 1, 1-4 and M. N. III, 49. Cf. also the extensive discussion in C. M. to Sanh. VII, 4. The primary source for the pre-Mosaic situation is the story of Judah and Tamar, from which Maimuni 33</page><page sequence="30">BARON revelation, realized the far-reaching effects of this transformation and, aware of the peculiar human weaknesses in all matters of sex, greeted it with plaints and wails.6s In fact, intercourse with a Gentile woman (with the exception of a single sexual act with a prisoner of war for which not even a priest was to be punished) was altogether prohibited. Although not encouraged, popular lynching rather than regular court procedure was to dispose of such offenders. That this is true Mosaic law, Maimonides argues, is proved by the incident of Zimri whose assassination by Phinehas was countenanced by the great leader himself.66 Maimonides admits, however, that such confirmatory evidence of Mosaic traditions is rarely available. In discussing, for exam- ple, the law permitting formal release from oaths and vows he admits that "this matter has no foundation at all in the written law. But Moses our teacher learned it from tradition."67 Realiz- derives the moral lessons that one should be reticent in divulging sex relation- ships and also keep his financial pledges to his wife in the same degree as an indebtedness for wages to an employee. The expression DmN ,T, nP n iln onp p 1 rw 3 mri ' y has a quaint anachronistic sound, especially when applied to Tamar. Cf. also Eppenstein, MbM I, 415. 65 M. T.

In accordance with the talmudic interpretation, however, Maimuni limits this procedure to immediate action against the shameless transgressors who perform their intercourse in the presence of at least ten Israelites and thus duplicate the sin of Zimri. RABD wishes to add even the requirement of a preceding warning which reflects the wavering attitudes of the rabbis in b. and j. Cf. Migdal 'Oz ad loc. The historicity of such a public performance, however, is doubted by neither scholar in view of its numerous descriptions in the Aggadah. Cf. the notes to GL III, 380 ff.

Other historically significant examples of oral traditions going back to Moses 34</page><page sequence="31">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES 35 ing the arbitrariness of such a statement and fearing that it might vitiate the much controverted claim to authenticity of the oral law, Maimonides tries to lay down a rule whereby true Mosaic traditions might be distinguished. He bars from that category all matters subjected to controversy in the talmudic literature, as well as those derived through logical reasoning or introduced later by special enactments and the force of custom. True traditions are only those which are so designated expressly in the authoritative documents of Judaism.68 On the other hand, not all laws given to Moses, even if recorded in Scripture, are to be regarded as permanent legislation. Some of them were intended to meet only temporary emergencies. Maimonides counts more than three hundred laws in addition to the six are: 1) The offering of the 'Omer which, according to an unwritten Mosaic ordinance, is to be a measure of barley. M. T. Temidin u-Musafin 7, 11; S. M. Comm. 44, referring to Mekilta, Jethro, Bahodesh ch. XI; Sifra Lev. section 13, 2.4 and Men. 68b. The quotation of the full verse Lev. 2.14 may imply the acceptance of R. Eliezer's motivation. Cf. Rashi ad loc. Also the date of the sixteenth of Nisan is Mosaic: D'w',ln T'Dn iN 1 1p . . ?. ?1D i nylI 'Do immn mi 5n i'7nnimm;l, and Maimuni describes at great length the anti-Sadducean ceremony in accordance with M. Men. VI, 3 and b. 65a. 2) The segregation of the high priest seven days before the Day of Atonement. M. T. 'Abodat Yom ha-Kippurim 1, 3. In C. M. to Yoma I, 1 the scriptural backing is adduced from Lev. 8. 33-4, according to R. Ishmael's interpretation Yoma 3b. Cf. also Mekilta Sav end; Rashi ad loc. 3) The institution of seven days of mourning for a deceased relative and seven days of feasting a bridegroom M. T. 'Ebel 1, 1: it4W'z amh ]pn lm-I u-Dm evidently referring to j. Ket. I, 1, 25a. In regard to mourning he merely renewed an older custom (Gen. 50.10) which was abolished by the Torah. (This is perhaps a harmonization of b. M. K. 21a and j. M.K. III, 5, 82c which appears to favor the obligatory biblical character of a seven day mourning). In S. M. Comm. 37, Maimuni quotes many indirect sources, including the historical illustration by the case of Joseph ha-Kohen. Cf. Zeb. 100a and M. Higger, Treatise Sema4ot, N. Y. 1931, pp. 30 f., 117 and 126. The wedding week, too, had pre-Mosaic antecedents. In regard to Jacob cf. Pirke R. Eliezer 36 and the Pal. Targum to Gen. 29.27. For Samson cf. Jud. 14.17 and Yalkut Shim'oni 70. 68 Although not stated in as many words this distinction is clearly implied in M. T.

Non-Jews need observe only the seven Noahide command- ments which would make them "the pious ones of the Gentile nations" and as such eligible for the world to come. Neither can Gentiles attain the higher degrees of prophecy. Even Balaam, Moses' contemporary, who had succeeded in foretelling both the advent of the house of David and the final redemption by the messiah, reached only to the second of the eleven degrees of prophecy.70 Although generally deprecating Balaam as an evil- 69 S.

Among the other adversaries of Israel in the Mosaic age, Sihon and Og engage Maimuni's special attention, because of the diffi- culty of reconciling the biblical narrative with his own philosophic views. That God should have hardened the spirit of Sihon (Deut. 2.30) had puzzled "many commentators" who saw therein a contradiction to the doctrine of free will. But as in the case of Pharaoh and the Israelite transgressors in the days of Elijah, Maimuni asserts, such affliction connotes only Sihon's deserved punishment on account of his previous sins and his inability to repent.

Like Joshua and the seventy elders Eleazar and Phinehas were specially ordained to help him instruct the people in the oral interpretations of Scipture. The number of priests was at first very small so that during the desert migrations also non-priestly Levites had to be drafted to carry the tabernacle. For the subsequent generations, how- ever, the law demanded that only full-fledged priests should bear the sanctuary upon their shoulders. To adumbrate the future divisions Moses organized the priestly class into eight groups, selecting four each from the descendants of Eleazar and Ittamar. This number was later increased by King David in co6peration with Samuel to twenty-four posts (ma'amadot) which were to be permanently in charge of the services in the sanctuary.72 Since the leadership of Moses and Aaron was the 71 I.

Marx in nmsi^ V (1921) p. 195 and n. 199. 72 In C. M. Introd. Maimuni picturesquely describes the successive stages in the instruction given by Moses to Aaron, Eleazar, Ittamar, the seventy elders and the rest of the people which allowed everyone to hear the lesson four times; he slightly amplifies the tannaitic story narrated in 'Er. 54b. In M. T. Introd. and Sanh. 4, 1 he speaks briefly of the instruction given to the elders, Eleazar and Phinehas, but stresses the transmission to Joshua above all others. S. M. Introd. Root 3 and Commandment 34 emphasizes on the basis of numerous biblical passages the temporary nature of Num. 7.9, thus evoking the protest of, e.g., Nahmanides. M. T.

Maimonides describes a psychological subterfuge frequently used by the first high priest to reform sinners. As soon as Aaron recognized that a man was naturally evil-minded, he began treating him like a decent and honorable citizen, thus inducing him to justify this attitude.74 Only toward the end of his life did Moses begin writing down the Torah for posterity. He used the square Hebrew characters, because of their sacred nature, leaving the "Transjordan" (old Hebrew) alphabet for profane usage, such as inscribing coins. He prepared thirteen different copies on scrolls and gave a copy each to every tribe including the Levites. Only through their inclusion in the Law of Moses did even the pre-Mosaic com- mandments (e. g., circumcision) become obligatory for later generations.75 Moses died at noon of the seventh day of Adar.76 is the wish to fit it into the theory that for every such major change in the constitution the co6peration of a king, prophet and seventy elders is necessary.

Comm. 209, Prohib. 45, referring to Sanh. 109bf. and the homilet- ical interpretations of Num. 21.5, etc. in Num. r. 18,20. The story of Korah (Qarun) has found its way also into the Koran and Arabian historical litera- ture. Cf. e. g., Maqdasi III, 88 f. 74 C. M. to Abot 1, 12 referring to the legend in Ab. R. N., ibid. ed. Schechter pp. 48 ff. Maimuni also tries to explain the "golden calf" with the contagious influence of astrology at that time which induced many Israelites to worship therein a symbol of the constellation, under which they had been delivered from Egypt.

Cf. also Num. r. 4, 20. The emphasis that the scrolls contained the Pentateuch to the very end is in agreement with R. Simon, B. B. 15a, etc.; the story of the thirteen scrolls is evidently taken from Deut. r. 9, 9 (cf. the interesting note of Z. W. Einhorn). C. M.

The major task of Moses' disciple, Joshua, was to conquer Palestine, to destroy the seven peoples and to distribute the land among the Israelites. Like his master he, too, tried to proceed as humanely as was possible under the divine injunctions to eliminate the Palestinian natives. Before entering the country, says Maimonides, Joshua despatched three messages to the natives. In the first he told them that anyone wishing to escape may do so by leaving Palestine instantly. In the second he offered peace after complete surrender. In the third he declared war upon those who would resist. How then is it to be explained, one may ask, that the Gibeonites took recourse to a subterfuge? Maimonides ascribes it to their unfamiliarity with Jewish legal procedure. They thought that after rejecting the terms of Joshua's first message they had no alternative but war. Their Bagdad (Kobes II, 15c ff.) Maimuni rigorously defends the Mosaic origin of the entire Torah against the "great foolishness" of those who think that Moses merely reproduced those laws which had been previously given, e.g., circum- cision. Even today their binding force is derived from God's revelation to Moses and not from that to Abraham, etc. In Resp. No. 5 he follows the opinion of Eleazar of Modi'in and Judah the Patriarch, against that of the others in Sanh. 21b f. (also Tos. Sanh. IV, 7; j. Meg. I, 11, 71b), that the square script served as the divine medium in giving the Torah (he adds also: the two tables of the Covenant). Of historical interest is the remark: l:pi 'nry n I: lin tr ,n:' 1 n2pn , py by 'n n n m-in matn. which raises the question whether Maimuni actually saw many Maccabean coins. Cf., also the editor's notes pp. 5 f. and Pseudo-Hai's comments on M. Yadaim IV, 5 (ed. J. N. Epstein, Berlin 1924, p. 135). In C. M. to IV, 6 Maimuni glorifies the square script on account of the diversity of its letters and discontinuity of writing and applies to it homiletically Gen. 30.13. 76 C. M. Introd. Maimuni graphically describes the scenes before Moses' death, how on the first day of Shebat Moses gathered the entire people and day after day elucidated to them the obscure points in law, quoting Sifre Deut. 4 in reference to Deut. 1.3-5. For the date he quotes the well-known tradition Tos. Sotah XI, 2; Kid. 38a; Meg. 13b, etc. That it was at noon is quoted from Sifre Deut. 337. He finally quotes the tradition (Sotah 13b; more succinctly Sifre Deut. 357) that Moses like Elijah did not die a normal human death. 39</page><page sequence="36">BARON ruse, although in itself unnecessary, aroused the ire of the Jewish commanders who refrained from exterminating them only because of the fear of desecrating the name of God.77 Since, according to Mosaic law, converts from among the indigenous seven peoples were to be admitted to the community of the Lord, Joshua decreed the exclusion of the. Gibeonites only for the duration of the Temple. David, however, in punishment of their pitiless thirst for revenge on the family of Saul, excluded them forever, and this injunction was later upheld by Ezra.78 Neither did Joshua succeed in eradicating completely the other natives. This being a divine injunction valid as long as there remained a single member of the seven tribes, the completion of this task, too, was left to David. The few who had survived David's reign mingled with the rest of the population and totally lost their identity.79 In distributing the land Joshua assigned a portion to every male that participated in the Exodus. Since both Zelophehad and his father Hepher were among those who left Egypt, Zelo- phehad was entitled to his own portion and, as first-born son, to two-thirds of his father's portion. All that was the patrimony 77 M. T. Melakim 6, 5 (for the text cf. Kesef Mishneh) on the basis of j. Sheb. VI, 1, 36c and Git. 46a. Cf. also GL VI, 177 f. n. 33-35. While Maimuni derives from that story the moral that all wars must be preceded by an exhor- tation to surrender, RABD interprets literally the y?nt Dm3' bWv -ly in j. 1. c. So do Tosafot Git. 46a s.v. ]'l,, although the talmudic text there obviously favors Maimuni's explanation. 78 M. T. Issure Biah 12, 22-24, on the basis of Kid. 78b f.; Yeb. 79a; j. Kid. IV, 1, 65c; Ex. r. 8, 4, etc. For other references cf. GL VI, 178 n. 36 and 269 n. 114. Instead of j's quotation from Neh. 3.20, Maimuni cites Ezra 8.20 which helps him explain the different nature of Joshua's and David's punitive measures. 79 S. M. Comm. 187. This view which, on the face, appears quite modern is evidently based upon the biblical narrative, especially that concerning the Jebusites whose territory was conquered by David. Among the events during the war the conquest of Jericho looms large in Maimonides' mind, especially since, according to tradition, it took place on a Sabbath, thus proving that in war the Sabbath rest commandment may be violated. Cf. M. T. Shabbat 2, 25 on the basis of j. Shab. I, 3, 4a f., Seder'Olam 11, etc. Maimuni ignores here completely the Christian and Karaite polemics which had prompted Saadia to deny the capture of Jericho on Sabbath. Cf. GL VI, 174 n. 22. 40</page><page sequence="37">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES of his daughters.8o More significantly, from the outset Joshua made certain reservations which curtailed the unrestricted private ownership of Palestinian land. According to tradition, he and his court imposed ten conditions upon the recipients of the land grants and their future heirs. He insisted, for example, that everyone be allowed to pasture sheep and goats in forests with large trees, but for the pasturage of oxen and cows there, or of sheep and goats in a young forest the permission of the owner was to be required. The water supply of a newly arisen spring was to belong to the city regardless of the position of its main artery, and the neighbors were forbidden to interfere with the city's use thereof. Everybody was to be allowed to fish in the lake of Tiberias by hook, while only the adjacent tribe [of Naphtali] was entitled to spread out large nets obstructing navigation. Travelers finding the road impassable on account of mud were to be permitted to walk alongside the roads even though they had to trespass on private grounds. These and similar reservations were enacted from the outset in order to safeguard the rights of society and its members against unre- stricted private ownership.8' Joshua also surrounded certain 8o C.

V, 1, 15a (see the remarks in Yefeh Eynaim to b. ad loc.). Like Alfasi, Maimuni regards only these ten ordinances as having been issued by Joshua, but not the others mentioned in the talmudic discussion on that Baraita. He interprets some of these ordinances in his own fashion. p'Di n130 DpsnD 1'yn; 'n ,rnn txnr evidently wishes to emphasize communal use of a spring against the exclusive rights of the landowner. The Talmud adds, against the opinion of Rabbah b. R. Huna, that the landowner cannot even demand compensation. Cf. also Asheri ad loc. The reason for Maimuni's preference for the limitation of the rights of the neighboring community to which the main source of the water might be traced back, is not clear. Neither does he explain whether the local landowner is entitled to a compensation by his own community. The text yip iDni' 6 H -35':1 I'I-D ?I ,' 1' pnDm m3'Dnr n n Voy'l, particularly if combined with the Baraita mIrlvn2, etc. quoted here by b. from Tos.

Cf. Tosafot s.v. p'nml, Asheri, etc. Maimuni wishes to see the right of the neigh- boring landowners extended much further. It is likely, moreover, that his tv u'sDD r'Dy'l has the meaning of sending out rather than hindering the 41</page><page sequence="38">BARON cities with walls, and down to the fall of Jerusalem only those cities enjoyed the specific privileges granted by the Bible to walled cities; they enjoyed them even if they no longer had any walls. But cities subsequently built or enlarged so as to require walls were not legally recognized. The same procedure was repeated immediately after the return from the Exile and will be repeated once more in the messianic era.82 The conquest of Palestine by Joshua and again its occupancy by the returning exiles lent a certain sanctity to the territories occupied by them. From the legal point of view every conquest similar to that of Joshua, i. e., accomplished by a prophet or king with the concurrence of a sanhedrin, sanctified the con- quered territory, provided all of Palestine had already been boats (cf. e. g., int nlin 1 'Tny, B. K. 116b), thus allowing the fishermen on the shore to send out boats into the lake for fishing purposes, a right withheld from strangers. This interpretation, evidently supported by the text of the Tosefta 1. c.: inm,9D *rDy, in-n vrlD DmH 1'K, undoubtedly squares more closely the historical situation and Maimuni, while in Palestine, might have himself observed such practice. Maimuni's explanation of ,ln';r nl m'n as equivalent to soft mud is likewise both more logical and in closer accordance with M. Milkvaot IX, 2 than that of Rashi ad loc. The inversion of the order of ordi- nances 8 and 9 by Maimuni was perhaps intended to add emphasis to the elimination of the preceding n,:w ny3in rnnip y nimnn ,,a lA ]'inDl from the list of Joshua's enactments. In accordance with the Talmud and Alfasi (on the basis of Prov. 3.27), he regards this enactment as superimposed by King Solomon. Ibid. ?4.

The inconsistency in the Maimonidean interpretation was immediately pointed out by RABD and Karo. If one were to accept the latter's strained explana- tion, it would merely furnish a striking illustration for Maimuni's method of postulating, without further evidence, certain historical situations, in order to straighten out halakic contradictions. 42</page><page sequence="39">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES under Jewish domination. David's memorable conquests in Syria did not establish the same degree of sanctity, because he had acted improperly in not waiting with this expansion beyond Palestine's natural boundaries until after his occupation of Jerusalem. Forever after, Syria was to remain in Jewish law the "conquest of an individual" as against Palestine which belonged to the people as a whole. Syria thus occupied an intermediate position between the full sanctity of Palestine and the non-sanctity of foreign lands. Neither was, on the other hand, the sanctity of Palestinian soil of equal permanence in all respects. Insofar as it was connected with the Temple and its worship, it has had eternal validity, because God's presence has been continuous. In other aspects, such as the obligatory payment of tithes, priestly dues and the observance of the year of fallowness, all of which were based upon the Jewish character of Palestinian agriculture, the underlying sanctity depended upon Jewish domination. After the first fall of Jerusalem it ceased, and was renewed by the returning exiles only for such territories as were occupied by them. After the second fall of Jerusalem, however, it continued unabated, because the second occupation, not having been accomplished by the force of arms, could not be stamped out by sheer loss of political power. At the same time the sanctity of the Palestinian regions which were not resettled by Ezra remained in abeyance throughout the Second Commonwealth, and is not to be restored until their reoccupancy by the messianic hosts.83 83 This ramified semi-historical and semi-halakic problem looms very large in Maimuni's writings. Following the talmudic sources he tries to furnish historical reasons for often contradictory customs and observances, which had developed in the period around the second fall of Jerusalem. The amplest discussion is to be found in M. T. Terumot 1, 1-9, where the following five geographic divisions are established, each of which has a distinctive position in Jewish law: 1) Palestine of the early Second Commonwealth; 2) The remainder of the Holy Land; 3) Syria; 4) Ammon, Moab, Egypt and Baby- lonia; 5) the rest of the world.

Under the stress of war, to be sure, Joshua himself had to take recourse to certain extralegal actions. For example, in his prosecution of Achan he disregarded the legal requirements of evidence and accepted the confession of the defendant as suf- ficient ground for condemnation. But this was an extraordinary measure, not intended to change the law but to meet a temporary emergency. He may also have acted in conformity with his special royal prerogatives. The same holds true of David's Resp. 136, quoting Sifre Deut. 51, the Mishnahs commented upon, etc. Of greatest interest from the historical point of view is the distinction drawn in M. T. Bet ha-Bebirah 6, 16 between Joshua and Ezra. Because the latter mli i,p'rnnP vptnp rn i 6 1 mi ntp Hi the sanctity thus established had permanent force. This theory ran counter the ideas of not only those who, like RABD, denied the eternality of the Temple's own sanctity, but even of those who tried to defend the Maimonidean position. Cf. Kesef Mishneh ibid. who asks: {m1 DPy pnD nr m Hi: ,prn sa-y ,' ir. The basis of this distinction is obvi- ously the statement in Seder 'Olam 30 (with the homiletical interpretation of Deut. 30.5), quoted Yeb. 82b and Niddah 46b. But while Rashi on the latter passage declares it to be a mnon, nrn, Maimuni looks for a rational explanation. What he had in mind was most likely the difference between military conquest which can be nullified by another military act (Nebuchadnezzar against Joshua), whereas pacific occupation and usucapio, which establish civil law ownership and cannot be abolished by a victory in war, wherefore Titus' war- like exploits could not abrogate the effects of Ezra's pacific penetration. Cf. also SeMaG Commandment 163. Maimuni's personal opinion (,I ni') that, in contrast to the Palestinian conquest, the priests and Levites are entitled to a share in the land and the booty during warfare in other lands (M. T. Shemittah ve-Yobel 13, 11), is likewise of considerable historical interest. This decision can hardly be defended on the basis of the sources, as pointed out by RABD, but appears justifiable on the ground of the assumed motivation of the law (ibid. ?12), since in foreign lands neither the priests nor the Levites would have to perform any particular sanctuary functions. Characteristically, Maimuni fails to mention, as does, e. g., Moses of Coucy who quotes him (SeMaG Prohib. 266-7), that in the messianic age both priests and Levites will be eligible to a share even in Palestine. Cf. B. B. 122a. The author's failure, here as well as in other instances, to indicate the law of the messianic era militates against the assumption that M. T. "was prepared as a Jewish Constitution for a future Jewish State" (S. Zeitlin, Maimonides, N. Y. 1935, p. 88). 44</page><page sequence="41">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES execution of the Amalekite slave.84 In the early days of mourning after Moses, moreover, oblivion began to engulf many of his oral interpretations. Fortunately the first judge to follow Joshua, Othniel the son of Kenaz, was a very ingenious dialectician and succeeded in restoring them to their pristine glory.85 Maimonides has little to say about the Judges. He realizes that theirs was a very long period. According to the chronology accepted by him, the Tabernacle brought from the desert was first placed in Gilgal during the fourteen years of conquest and land distribution. Afterwards it was erected in Shilo where it remained for three hundred and sixty-nine years until the death of Eli. Then it was transferred to Nob and finally to Gideon, in which localities it remained for fifty-seven years until the erection of the Temple in Jerusalem.86 In his occasional remarks concerning the events during these four centuries Maimonides mentions Mahlon and Chilion as instances of divine wrath affecting those who leave the Holy Land. Even though they were among the "great men of their generation" and had emigrated under the stress of a great famine, they deserved to perish on this score. Ruth, on the other hand, is an illustration of divine rewards coming even to unbelievers. Through her and her descendants, the royal house of David, her father Eglon, king 84 C. M. to Sanh.

This is in line with the Maimonidean theory concerning the royal power over the life of the subject, as developed in S. M. Commandment 173 and M. T. Melakim 3, 8.10. It is noteworthy that, although twice stressing t'nl mnoi nn,r and ,'n 1in nnm, Maimuni nevertheless tries to rationalize this principle.

Maimonides on more than one occasion takes pains to explain that neither he nor Solomon, a king of Israel, could have been guilty of the grievous sin of intermarriage. What they actually did was only to dismiss lightly certain legal requirements for proselytism. According to law, no one is to be allowed to adopt Judaism for a wordly purpose such as marrying a Jew or because of fear. Under Samson and, more, under David and Solomon, Israel's power inspired fear and the prosperity of the country opened vast opportunities. Consequently many joined the Jewish creed not out of conviction but for the sake of safety or other wordly advantages. Samson and Solomon accepted some of these converts as thoroughgoing proselytes and married them. As was to be expected these insincere newcomers frequently relapsed into their idolatrous practices, so that the biblical historian felt justified in ascribing to Solomon himself the erection of temples of foreign gods.88 Samuel finally is held out as an example of a pious, learned, truly prophetic leader. Unlike Samson who was 87 M. 7. Melakim 5, 9 evidently on the basis of B. B. 91a. Maimuni's omission of Elimelech (Tos. 'Ab.

Ruth r. 2, 5: inimllmnn 6lyin 1 liW l'Smv ,iY;i' 1Lo). It is also possible that Maimuni considered the different reason of Elimelech's death, advanced in Ruth r. 1, 4.-I. S. p. 9a is based on Ruth r. 2, 9 (cf. also Seder'Olam 12). It is noteworthy that Maimuni chooses this illustration rather than that frequently referred to in the Talmud (Nazir 23b which Maimuni seems to quote; Sotah 47a; Sanh. 105b and Hor. 10b) that Ruth's distinguished progeny was really a reward for the reverent act of Balak, the supposed grandfather of Eglon. In these sources the texts vary as to whether Ruth was the daughter or the grand- daughter of Eglon. 88 M. T. Issure Biah 13, 14-16. Maimuni makes use of the talmudic defence of Solomon (cf. Yeb. 76a f., 24b and Shab. 56b) to exonerate also Samson "who saved Israel" (reference to Jud. 13.5). The mere fact that he married the Gentile women only after their conversion to Judaism is indicated in the reply of one of them: 'm nmn', as reported in Sotah 10a. This view is also shared by various commentators on Jud. 14.2, such as Gersonides. In j. Sotah I, 8, 17b even this excuse is dropped. In C. M. to Sotah I, 8 Maimuni makes no pertinent observation.

Even his sons, who were less scrupulous, were blamed only because they had tried unlawfully to increase the revenue of their scribes and court sergeants rather than to derive profit for themselves.89 The period of the first kings looms large in Maimonides' mind. He believes that upon their entry into Palestine the Israelites assumed three basic obligations in the following succession: to elect a king, to exterminate Amalek and to build a temple. He also tries to interpret away the anti-monarchical passages in the narrative of I Samuel, by stating that the great "Seer" did not object to the wish of the people to have a king, but to the way in which it was expressed and also because of his legitimate suspicion that their major objective was not to fulfill the com- mandment but to get rid of his leadership.90 89 C.

Modern biblical scholarship generally finds in I Sam. a compilation of pro- and anti-monarchical sources, due to divergent attitudes, which found their counterparts in the Tannaitic age. That Maimuni adopts only those talmudic interpretations which favor monarchy is fully in line with his general political theory advocating strong monarchical govern- ment. This attitude could but be fostered by the realities of the Muslim state (especially the Egypt of Saladdin) and the prevalent political doctrines under Islam. M. N. III, 45 adds the logical reason for the precedence of the establishment of monarchy to the building of the Temple, namely that a strong centralized power was needed to prevent quarrels between the tribes as to the place where the structure should be erected. 47</page><page sequence="44">BARON David appears to Maimuni as the ideal Jewish king. He was not only a powerful king and a poet by grace divine, but also an inspired prophet and the greatest teacher among the seventy elders of his generation. He had been preordained by Moses as the star that shall step forth out of Jacob.9' As the author of the Psalms he expressed many fundamental teachings of Judaism. He stood out, for instance, through his desire to achieve the world to come. He also meditated on the meaning of the par- ticular historical experience of Israel and of its survival under so many foreign rulers.92 His wars were mostly of the kind classified as "holy wars," and the soldiers participating therein may all be assumed to have been righteous persons.93 To increase the study of the law he personally ordained numerous students; once, indeed, as many as thirty thousand in a single day. He frequently defended the law against the attacks and importunities of skeptics and Gentiles, and the more he was annoyed by them, 9' C. M. to Abot IV, 4 gives this general characteristic, in order to emphasize the great humility of the poet-king, so eloquently expressed in Ps. 51.19. For the Davidic interpretation of Num. 24.17 cf. above n. 70. As a prophet David belonged only to those endowed with this gift in the first (the lowest) degree. M. N. II, 45, quoting I Sam. 16.13 in accordance with the inter- pretation of the Targum. Kimbi ad loc. is obviously influenced by Maimuni.

Although the context does not warrant it, Maimuni assumes as a matter of course that this was a regular ordination of the kind practiced in the tannaitic age. He seems, however, to have some compunction with regard to the large number. His reduction to 30,000 is hardly due to a different text of j., as suggested by Kesef Mishneh and Lehem Mishneh ad loc., since that would nullify the entire exposition of II Sam. 6.1. It is more likely that he preferred to adopt the biblical figure, abandoning the strained homily of mly D.'l. He obviates the physical difficulty of one man's conferring an ordination upon such a multi- tude in the short span of a day by stating that every ordained teacher may simultaneously ordain an unlimited number of persons by uttering a brief formula.

Only in controversial cases, such as at the accession of Solomon, Joash, Jehoahaz, the oil conferred an outward sign distinguishing the legitimate from the illegitimate ruler. On the other hand, Elisha, while anointing Jehu in North- ern Israel, did not use the sacred oil originally prepared by Moses, but oil of a balsam tree. The consecration of a Davidic king took place in front of a spring and followed a prescribed ritual of spreading oil, in the shape of a wreath, upon his forehead, whereas the high priest was anointed upon his brow with oil forming a Greek X.97 96 The exclusive right to sit in the 'azarah is stressed S.

In contrast to e.g., the Tosafists, ibid. s.v. 5Nb, Maimuni extends the jurisdiction of the Davidic dynasty also to capital crimes. Karo to Mel. 3, 7 raises a number of pertinent historical as well as legal objections. Although his answer is quite unsatisfactory (cf. also Mishneh le-Melek ad loc.), the responsibility for the historical inconsistency rests with the redactor of the Talmud rather than with Maimuni, who cautiously avoids referring to the trial of Alexander Jannaeus. For him most likely this trial merely revealed the weakness cf the court in the face of a lawless ruler, and he needed no further proofs for the frequent lawlessness of the North Israelitic kings. It may be mentioned that the phrase IwNv ',5u, here contrasted with n-T n',, has in Maimuni's writings the more inclusive connotation embracing both the northern and the southern kings. Cf. e. g., M.

As a lawgiver he enacted various laws with the assistance of his sanhedrin.

N. III, 54 the significant rabbinic qualification of I Kings 5.11 that he was not wiser than Moses (R. H. 21b) and adds, on his own part, that the biblical narrator merely wanted to indicate that Solomon was wiser than any man in his generation, which included a number of celebrated sages, as is, indeed, the ordinary meaning of the biblical verse. He does not mention I Kings 3.12, but there is hardly any doubt that he could dismiss this objection as arising merely from a dream. Cf. M. N. II, 36. True to his general exaltation of Moses as the greatest of all men, he takes cognizance neither of the Aggadot which equated Heman in I Kings 5.11 with Moses (Pesikta r. 14, 60a; Num. r. 19, 3, etc.) nor of the controversy between Rab and Samuel in R.

The Second Commonwealth merely followed the Solomonic model with a few amplifications in the prophecy of Ezekiel. As soon as the Temple was erected all other places of sacrificial worship were outlawed.'02 In building the Temple Solomon knew in advance that it was going to be destroyed in the future. To save the ark he constructed a special hiding place deep under ground where it could be preserved in such an emer- gency. Indeed, King Josiah realizing the approaching downfall ordered the ark to be removed to that secret chamber. Along with it he also put away Aaron's rod, the bottle of the manna and the oil of ointment.'03 The size of the Temple and its precincts was also definitely laid down and any extension beyond its original confines was contingent upon a joint decision of a king, prophet and sanhedrin and the concurrence of the divine oracles.Io4 Solomon's administration appeared to Maimonides in many ways as the ideal type of monarchy. Much of what is recorded about its acts of government furnishes substantial elements to his codification of the laws governing kings in all ages. He glosses over the shortcomings of that reign, especially with 102 C. M. to Zeb. XIV, 8; S. M. Comm. 20-21; M. T. Bet ha-Bebirah 1, 3-4 and 2, 2.5; M. N.

Solomon's successors on the thrones of Jerusalem and Samaria offer less opportunity for comments. The kings of Israel are frequently pointed out as high-handed sinners with few redeem- ing features. Maimuni does not dispute the legitimacy of their reign. Since Jeroboam I had been duly appointed by the prophet Ahijah, he and his successors would have ruled over Israel for a very long time, although their dynasty could not rival that of David in either significance or permanence.105 To emphasize the cumulative effect of major and minor sins, Maimonides cites the example of Jeroboam. Although the earthly court inflicts punishment only for the major crimes (kim lei bideraba minei), before God even the slightest transgressions add their weight to the balance. That is why Jeroboam was punished not only for the basic offense of voluntarily worshiping calves and inciting Israel to accept his idolatrous practice, but also for his neglect in the observance of the Feast of Taber- nacles.1?6 King Ahab was another typical sinner who misled the entire people, with the exception of only 7000 Israelites, to the worship of Baal. Nevertheless, his greatest transgression and one which loomed largest in the denunciations of the prophet consisted in his lawless appropriation of Naboth's vineyard. He os0 M. T.

Jehoshaphat's reverence for Jewish learning was so great that whenever he received a scholar he disregarded the court etiquette, descended from his throne and embraced the learned man.I?8 Hezekiah did all in his power to purify the Jewish religion. Sensing that a popular medical work of the day was based upon older magic rites and the invoca- tion of astral powers, he decided to suppress its public circulation. This move met with the approval of the scholars of that genera- tion. They disapproved, however, of Hezekiah's declaration of a leap year on Adar 30, because the month of Adar preceding Nisan ought to have only twenty-nine days, and with the thir- tieth, consequently, Nisan had already begun.I09 Manasseh appeared to Maimonides as a forerunner of the radical Bible critics of his own time who had especially assailed the inclusion of the allegedly inconsequential narratives in Scripture. He 107 I. S. pp. 7b and 9a; M. T. Roseah u-Shemirat Nefesh 4, 9, on the basis of I Kings 19.18; 22.21-2 (in the homiletical interpretation of Sanh. 89a) and Ta'anit 25b. Cf. also M. T.

His assault on those who believed that Solomon had been the author of this medical treatise (which is not stated explicitly in any of the rabbinic sources; cf. GL VI, 369 n. 90) and that Hezekiah suppressed it only because people had placed all their reliance in it and neglected to pray to God for help (cf. e. g., Rashi ad loc.) is wholly in line with Maimuni's rational attitude toward medicine. His own explanation that it had contained magical formulae and that "undoubtedly" it had been written by Sabeans is likewise in keeping with his general Sabean bogey. Cf. also Munk III, 292 n. 1.

Throughout the period of the kings there appeared the great prophets of Israel. The records of their lives and utterances serve as primary material for the Maimonidean theory of proph- ecy. Speaking, for example, of the characterological prerequisites for prophecy he emphasizes the shortcomings of even the greatest among prophets. Elijah sinned because of his short temper and was punished therefore. Elisha, although undoubtedly innocent of the offense of accepting "gifts" from the Shunammite woman, frequently ascribed to him by judges and teachers who thereby wished to exonerate their own acceptance of remuneration for public service, was likewise guilty of excessive irascibility. Their punishment-like that of Jacob when he had temporarily failed on account of his fear of Esau or his mourning for Joseph, that of Samuel when he was afraid of Saul or of Solomon when he committed acts of cruelty-consisted in the suspension of their prophetic calling. Isaiah, too, was severely punished, because of his wholesale condemnation of the entire people of Israel, even though it really happened to be plunged in idolatry.T" In addition to being prophets these great masters were also the main transmitters of Jewish law. The chain of tradition was maintained by them in unbroken continuity to the days of Jeremiah who handed it over to his disciple Baruch-a typically potential but not actual prophet-and through him to the leaders in Exile, especially Ezra. As prophets these men were entitled to alter temporarily the Mosaic law, with the under- standing that, with the passing of the particular emergency, the old law would be automatically restored. So we may understand "lo C. M. to Sanh. X Introd., on the basis of Sanh. 99b. Cf. also above n. 36 and 53. Uzziah is mentioned S. M.

Azzur, plagiarized others to whom the true will of God had been revealed. A major characteristic of these false prophets is their sensuality, particularly in matters of sex."3 On the other hand, there are true prophets among the Gentiles, such as Job and his friends. But the Israelites have been fore- warned to give credence only to prophets who arise from their own midst.I4 112 C. M. Introd. and M. T.

In this reasoning he is followed by both Kimbi and Gersonides ad. loc. (Cf. also the latter's long discussion in his Commentary on Deut. 18). Of particular interest is Maimuni's dating of a prophecy of Habakkuk after Nebuchadnezzar's massacres (M. N. III, 17) which contradicts the prevailing rabbinic chronology placing that prophet under the reign of Manasseh. Cf. e. g., Seder'Olam 20. Maimuni must have been familiar with the legend, taken over by Yosippon (ed. Giinzburg, pp. 25 f.) from the Apocrypha, that Habakkuk was transferred from Palestine to Babylonia to feed and comfort Daniel in the lions' den. The Hebrew original of the apocryphal work Bel and the Dragon, where this story first appears-if such an original ever existed-was no longer known to Origen and the Church Fathers, but the story itself was known to many medieval rabbis, such as the author of Yerahmeel (72, 220 f.), Moses ha-Darshan (cf. the excerpts of his Bereshit Rabbete, quoted by Raymond Martinus in Pugio Fidei, Leipzig 1687, p. 957 and A.

With respect to Job and his associates we may pursue the following development: In I. T. p. 33 (Kobes II, 4c) he declares 57</page><page sequence="54">BARON The Assyro-Babylonian invasions into Palestine had many lasting effects. Sennacherib's conquest of all adjoining territories caused a general amalgamation of the peoples and tribes adjoin- ing Israel. The Egyptians, Edomites, Ammonites and Moabites, in particular, lost their identity, and the biblical regulations concerning the endogamous exclusion of these races could no longer be applied.Is In the days of Sennacherib there also arose the Samaritan sect. The Cutheans, settled by the Assyrians in the cities of Samaria, gradually learned the Torah and began interpreting it in a literal sense. Although this literalism naturally led to the denial of oral law, the Samaritans were long regarded as true believers in all other respects. In fact, the rabbis acknowl- edged that they strictly observed all commandments accepted by them. At one time, however, the Jewish leaders grew sus- picious of their worship at Mt. Gerizim and a thorough investiga- tion brought to light that they had worshiped there an idol in the shape of a dove. All the passages in the Mishnah, says Maimonides, which declare the Samaritans to be inferior to Israel but superior to the Gentiles belong to a period before that investigation. Since that time they ought to be treated much worse than sheer idolaters."6 that, although heathens, they are generally recognized by Jews as true pro- phets. In C. M. to Sanh.

His hypothesis that all pro-Cuthean statements antedated the so-called investigation cannot, of course, stand the test of a critical examination of the sources. 58</page><page sequence="55">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES The destruction of the Temple and the ensuing Exile brought about mass apostasy. In fact all the exiles in Babylonia, with the exception of a few individuals, began worshiping foreign gods. Even "the craftsmen and the smiths," before Jerusalem's fall distinguished in their piety, now apparently surrendered to the general forces of assimilation. Among the individuals who pre- served staunch orthodoxy stand out the three youngsters, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.I17 Daniel, otherwise a distin- guished martyr committed the grievous error of giving uncalled- for advice to Nebuchadnezzar to distribute charity."8 The Chaldean king, on the other hand, through a few acts of piety, such as placing the name of God before that of the Jewish king, deserved great reward. Although guilty of the burning of the Temple and the massacre of a multitude of Israelites "like the sand of the sea," he was rewarded by God with a long reign of forty years, similar in duration to that of king Solomon."9 V. FROM EZRA TO THE TALMUD. The return from the Exile is always associated in Maimonides' mind with Ezra. The preceding developments under Zerubbabel appeared to him as essentially belonging to the Exilic age. Ezra was for him the recipient of the whole body of tradition from Baruch the son of Neriah, the rebuilder of the Temple and the initiator of the work of the Great Synagogue and its successors among the sages. 117 S.

Fearing that without a supreme court, such as was to be reestab- lished in Jerusalem, the Babylonian sector could not permanently stave off the danger of mixing with ethnically suspicious elements, he took along with him all the ten categories enumerated in the Mishnah, including the seven lower ones, trusting that in Pal- estine the great court will prevent them from mingling with the rest of the people. In this fashion there remained in Babylonia only members of the first three groups, i. e., priests, Levites and Israelites of good stock.120 Those who returned to Palestine occupied a territory smaller than that held by the first conquerors. The sacred character of the reoccupied territories, however, exceeded in many ways that of the previous occupation. As mentioned above, the sanctitity of the Second Commonwealth, because established without force, was to last forever. With respect to the Sabbatical year, for example, its full observance was imposed only upon the country up to Kezib. Between Kezib and the River or Omna one must not perform any work during that year but the plants which grew up by themselves could be consumed by their rightful owners. Beyond these boundaries even work was permitted. In Transjordan the observance of the year of fallow- ness was introduced later by the rabbis without scriptural authority. But there as well as in Syria they prohibited only work, but not the consumption of spontaneous growths. On the other hand, they insisted upon the payment of the Levitical and the poor man's tithes during that year from the adjacent regions of Ammon and Moab, which were allowed to cultivate their soil. The sages were mainly prompted by the desire to see the poor man's tithe forthcoming from these less severely taxed regions to support the suffering masses of the Jewish settlement around Jerusalem during the difficult years of fallowness. This 120 C. M. to Kid. IV, 1 referring to the discussion b. 69b ff. Maimuni's general pro-Palestinian orientation prevents him, however, from fully accepting the Babylonian biases concerning Palestine's inferiority in family purity, as have come to the fore in that talmudic discussion. For this reason he intro- duces a new element: the supervision by the Palestinian supreme court. 60</page><page sequence="57">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES obligation was soon extended to all neighboring districts includ- ing Egypt, but did not apply to the more distant Babylonia, where the seventh year differed in no respect from all other years. Since Maimonides regarded the Sabbatical year as obliga- tory also after the loss of national independence he went into great detail to delineate the boundaries of the reoccupation as against those of the First Commonwealth.12 Three prophets accompanied the returning Exiles. One gave testimony concerning the place for the erection of an altar, another added its dimensions and the third testified that they may offer sacrifices on that altar, although the Temple had not yet been reirected.I22 Soon after they proceeded to build a 121 M. T. Matnot 'Aniyim 6, 5 on the basis of M. Yadaim IV, 3, Yeb. 16a, etc. Cf. also note 83. Curiously C. M. to Yadaim 1. c. Maimuni defines Ammon and Moab as identical with the cities of Sihon and Og. By this historical inex- actitude he probably wished to indicate that all of Transjordan, insofar as it was not reoccupied by the Jews, was free from the Sabbatical observance, but subjected to the poor man's tithe. Maimuni, following the Mishnaic phrase- ology, calls this regulation a Sinaitic tradition-which has annoyed his com- mentators, such as Karo. But he evidently did not mean to convey the idea that this actually was Mosaic law. In another connection, M. T. Terumot 1, 26 he states expressly that even in the days of Ezra in the Jerusalem district the very terumah was no longer a biblical obligation, because the latter was contingent upon the settlement of all Jewry in Palestine. Such condition prevailed under the First Commonwealth and will reoccur in the messianic era, but failed to materialize under the Second Temple. Cf. Yeb. 82a, RABD and the commentaries. Karo's explanation that Maimuni's usage of ?'?n3 was inaccurate (Simon of Sens uses the same phrase tp1N i&amp;4 with respect to the Mishnah) is controverted by Maimuni's citation of this passage among the Sinaitic traditions in his Introd. to C. M. Karo simply overlooked Mai- muni's distinction between biblical law and Sinaitic tradition. Cf. also Tchernowitz, op. cit. pp. 29 ff. I22 C. M. to Middot III, 1 and M. T.

T., logically reverses the order of both the Baraita and R. Johanan's utterance. He does not mention, however, the names of the three prophets, although he must have accepted the general understanding that those were Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi whom, in another connection, he calls the "latter prophets" in contrast to the '31n w,i Dw's who included all those who appeared under the first Temple.

This temple lasted throughout the Second Commonwealth. Maimonides tries to reconstruct the blueprint of the sanctuary, as described in the Mishnah Middot, without realizing that there was a substantial difference between the magnificent Herodian structure described in that tractate and the much humbler house of worship erected by the poor resettlers from Babylonia. Among the noteworthy innovations he mentions the image of Susa, the Persian capital, which was engraved on the eastern gate under the government's strict orders. This engraving was to impress upon the mind of the Jewish subjects the power of their Persian sovereign and help hold them in perpetual submission.123 In this Temple the priests achieved preeminence even over their Levitical confreres. The Levites, having refused to join in large numbers Ezra's expedition, were 123 C. M. to Middot and Tamid passim and M. T. Bet ha-Behirah passim, where he describes the architecture of the Temple with a wealth of detail. The reference to Susa is in C. M. to Middot I, 3, on the basis of that Mishnah and Men. 98a.-Maimuni mentions in another connection the eastern entrance to the Temple court, the so-called Gate of Nicanor and explains the name by relating the well-known legend, only stripping it of some of its supernatural accretions. C. M. to Yoma III, 10 on the basis of Tos. Yoma II, 4; b. 38a, etc. It is characteristic that, in contrast to his sources, he regards Nicanor as a Palestinian Jew who proceeded to Alexandria in order to obtain there the sacred gate rather than as the Temple's Egyptian Jewish benefactor.-C. M. to Middot V, 3 explains the name mrn1; nDt1 as given on account of a Persian ('mDi), Parva, who was apprehended while attempting to bore through the wall in order to see the high priest officiating. His source is the venturesome explanation of R. Joseph in Yoma 35a which has given rise to various com- ments. Cf. Arukh s.v. (similar to Maimuni's), Rashi on Yoma 1. c., Bartenora on Middot 1. c.-M.

Apart from renewing the age-old prohibition of intermarriage he decreed that for purposes of chastity even at home every Jewish woman should constantly wear a sinar (a kind of petticoat). More significantly, Ezra and his court inalterably laid down for all future generations the formulae of the various benedictions and the reading of the Torah in the Synagogue, and instituted that it be followed by a 124 C. M. to Ma'aser Sheni V, 15 (repeated by the translator in C. M. to Sotah IX, 10) on the basis of the discussion in Yeb. 86b which quotes Ezra 8.15 125 C. M. Introd. and M. T. Introd. on the basis of various talmudic and geonic sources discussed in GL VI, 447 n. 56. Maimonides did neither hesitate to include in the list practically all the prophets and leaders of the early post-exilic age, mentioned anywhere in the Bible, nor to place them all in a single generation. This was in agreement with his acceptance of the talmudic chronology concerning the short duration of the Persian period. He omits, however, Joshua, the high priest, probably because he regards Ezra as his successor in office, which is in accordance with the Aggadah in Cant. r. 5, 5. On the other hand, when C. M. to Shek. I, 1 accepts the Mishnah's identifica- tion of one of the Temple's supervisors, Petahiah, with the returning exile, Mordecai-Bilshan, it is with the understanding that these supervisors were the most distinguished men in their particular function irrespective of the period of their activity. Nevertheless Maimuni apparently did not hesitate to place the story told in j. Shelk. I, 1, 48d in the name of Petahiah and in b. Men. 64b in the name of Mordecai in the Maccabean age, some two centuries after Ezra. Cf. Rashi on Men. 1. c. s. v.

T. may perhaps be due to apprehension, lest Muslim readers find therein confirmation, however far-fetched, for the widespread accusation that the Jews worshiped Ezra as a son of God. This accusation, originating with Muhammed, achieved canonical authority by its inclusion in the Koran (9.30) and was reinforced by tradition. Cf.

M. T. Issure Biah 12, 1.-The final formulation of all benedictions by "Ezra and his court" (M. T. Berakot 1, 5) is the equivalent of R.

Tefillah 12, 10) became necessary, as did the fixation of the Eighteen Benedictions, because the Jews, as a result of Nebuchadnezzar's Exile, mixed with "the Persians, the Greeks and other nations" and began speaking a jargon of many linguistic components. Ibid. 1, 4.-The regulation of the sinar was one of the ten ordinances ascribed to Ezra in B. K. 82a (cf. also j. Meg. IV, 1, 75a) most of which Maimuni records. His omissions are likewise significant. 1) The Torah reading on Sabbath afternoo nM. T.

Ibid.-3) The public sessions of the courts on Monday and Thursday are not recorded as a matter of law by Maimuni. Seeing the courts' functioning on all week days in his own time, he reverses even the talmudic phrase mN',N;1 ,ympT 'I" N3 :, ' Ket. 3a into the complementary assumption 'm; '= i' l:= 1ru ' -t: l,'w ovip M.

III, 10 he mentions it merely as a custom of bygone days), because it militated against his medical conscience. In fact, in M. T. Deot 4, 9 he enumerates garlic among the bad foodstuffs which ought to be taken very rarely and only in Winter.-6) The early hour for baking bread for the benefit of the poor is mentioned M. T. Ishut 21, 5 in connection with the wife's duty to perform that service personally, if the family is poor. But there is no reason to believe that Maimuni wished to exclude the application of this ordinance to servants baking the bread for well-to-do families.-7) The sinar (probably = 'wvaipiov).

T. Shekenim 6, 9. In the light of B. B. 22a, Maimuni qualifies this right to peddling, but not to permanent shopkeeping which may cause detriment to local merchants.-10) The obligatory ritual bath after a nocturnal pollution extended to all who wish to study the Torah is mentioned M. T. Keri'at Shema' 4, 8 negatively as having fallen into desuetude, because the mass of the people could not stand the strain. This is based upon Ber. 22a, reformu- lated so as to fit into the Maimonidean theory of the mode of abrogation of ordinances. Cf. Kesef Mishneh ad. loc. Cf. also M. Bloch, op. cit. I, 107-38; S.

The later years of the Persian domination seem to have almost completely disap- peared from his historical vision. Neither has he much to say about Alexander's conquest except to identify the reign of Alexander with the beginning of the Seleucid era. The spread of Hellenism and the establishment of large hellenistic com- munities in the dispersion as well as the growth of hellenistic literature are hardly referred to at all.127 At most he is concerned with the talmudic laws relating to the Greek language and science. He seeks an explanation for the enactment that Scripture may not be written in foreign languages except in Greek. He finds in the Septuagint the main reason for this exceptional position of Greek, which had also found expression in the well-known exclamation of Judah the Patriarch concerning the use of either Hebrew or Greek. Prepared in order to explain the Torah to king Ptolemy, he states, the Greek translation soon became very popular among "them," so that the Greek language occupied for them the position of ashurit. On the other hand, the prohibi- tion of studying Greek "science"-which he explains to connote a certain type of Greek mystery and allegory-had merely the accidental origin of a ruse used by a contemporary to mislead the Jews in their sacrificial worship in Jerusalem. Evidently this student of Aristotle could not simply reconcile himself with the idea of complete suppression of Greek science.I28 127 M. T.

The vagueness of the stories concerning the origin and spread of the Septuagint and the erection of the Onias Temple, discussed later on, seems sufficiently conclusive. 128 C. M. to Meg.

M. to Yadaim 65</page><page sequence="62">BARON The Maccabean revolt is likewise completely shrouded for him in the mist of legends. He has some information concerning the persecutions under Antiochus Epiphanes and the restoration of a Jewish Kingdom under the Hasmoneans which, he says, lasted for two hundred years until the destruction of the Second Temple. "Similarly during the Second Commonwealth," he relates, "when the wicked Greek kingdom gained control of Pales- tine, they instituted severe persecutions against Israel in order to abolish the Torah. The Jews were compelled to profane the Sabbath, and were forbidden to observe the rite of circumcision. Every Jew was forced to write on his garment the words, 'we have no portion in the Lord God of Israel,' and to engrave upon his ox before he ploughed with it, the words, 'we have no portion in Israel.' This state of affairs lasted about fifty-two years. Finally, God brought to an end simultaneously their empire and their laws." In order to prevent secret observance of Jewish law, he reports in another connection, the Greeks forbade the Jews to shut the doors of their houses.129 At the same time he relates the story of the miraculous inexhaustibility of the oil which, in the opinion of IV, 6: DTn,r ,nsD~) confirm the otherwise well-known fact that Maimuni himself -like the overwhelming majority of his Jewish and non-Jewish contemporaries under both Islam and Western Christendom-had not the slightest knowledge of Greek. M. T. Tefillin u-Mezuzah 1, 19 he remarks: ailyn l 'n ypwm n:1l -n=l trntnmi. (Cf., however, n. 194). That is very likely why he fails to mention the Greek Bible among the Scriptures which are to be saved from fire. Cf. Kesef Mishneh on M. T. Shabbat 23, 26. He may have known, however, of Ibn Ishak's Arabic translation of the Septuagint for use in Christian churches which certainly did not enhance in his eyes the necessity of continuing the exceptional protection, granted to it by talmudic law. More significantly, the numerous textual divergences between LXX and the masoretic text lent themselves to polemical exploitation (e. g., by Ibn Hazm) as proofs of the alleged "forgeries" of Scripture by the Jews. Cf. G. Vajda, La version des Septante dans la litterature musulmane REJ XC (1931) pp. 65-70. I29 M. T. Megillah ve-jHanukkah 3, 1; I. T. pp. 22 f. (Kobes II, 2c; here quoted from B. Cohen's unpublished translation) and I. S. p. 8b. Cf. also next note. Maimuni's description of the Syrian persecutions is evidently based upon aggadic sources and, especially, the Megillat Ta'anit, but has also many new and perplexing features. The enforced engraving of a denial of Judaism is a commonplace in the Aggadah. Cf. Meg. Ta'an. 2, 7, 11, 12; 66</page><page sequence="63">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES the rabbis, was the real reason for the celebration of Hanukkah.I30 Also the story of Onias; his appointment to high priestly office, although he was the younger son of Simon the Pious, Ezra's immediate successor; his intrigue to instigate the assassination of his brother Shimi; its complete failure; his subsequent flight to Egypt and the ensuing erection of the Onias temple there- are all narrated in accordance with the talmudic legends amplified by several noteworthy details. He knows that that temple lasted for two centuries.I3I Gen. r. 2, 4 (Theodor pp. 16f.; see further references there). Whether Mainiuni had a reading which included the inscription upon a garment is doubtful. He may merely have amplified the aggadic statement by a reference to the reality of a Jewish badge under Islam and the undoubtedly still vivid recollection of caliph Hakim bi'Amr-Illah's excesses in tenth century Egypt. The prohibition of closing the doors, mentioned only in the generally hasty and frequently ill-considered I. S., may have been a misreading of Meg. Ta'an. 2 and 7: xi4 m~'~= biN D1m =lt nK~ 1'}1i' ri,' r,n. The period of about fifty-two years appears likewise dubious. The terminus ad quem probably is 141 B. C., the usual basis for the rabbinic computation of the establishment of the Has- monean dynasty. Cf. e. g., S. Zeitlin, Megillat Ta'anit, Philad. 1922, p. 84 n. 235. But why should the persecution have started in 193 B. C.? It is possible that he knew the correct date of Antiochus' spoliation of the Jeru- salem temple in 170 B. C. and that he followed the chronology recorded, e. g., in Megillat Antiochos that this event took place in the twenty-third year of the Syrian king's reign. 130 M.

But according to the Halakah he follows chiefly the latter. Of course, he shares the con- fusion of the talmudic sources concerning Onias II, III and IV and aggravates it further by referring back to his Introduction where he had bluntly declared that Simon the Pious, although the youngest, was a member of the original Great Synagogue of one hundred and twenty. Cf. also M. T. Introd. He also stresses that the Onias temple was built for a special sect which he calls n-isp and that Egyptians (evidently non-Jews) worshiped there the God of Israel. He may have heard of certain confused Coptic traditions claiming descent from Egyptian Jewish ancestry originally associated with the worship at that temple. 67</page><page sequence="64">BARON Neither has he much to say about the individual Maccabean and Herodian rulers. He speaks of a Johanan the high priest in whose day an investigation was made in regard to the obser- vance of the laws of the heave-offering and the various tithes, but classifies him vaguely as holding office some time after Simon the Pious. Since that investigation discovered, he says, that in contrast to the scrupulously observed great terumah the segrega- tion of the first, second and the poor man's tithes was taken lightly, a regulation was enacted that only reliable persons were entitled to testify that such segregation had taken place, whereas the fruits of an 'Am ha-Ares had the dubious character of demai.132 King Agrippa was for Maimuni a noble and powerful, but nonetheless illegitimate ruler. Being a descendant of proselytes and having had no Jewish mother, he was under no circumstances eligible to royal office in Israel. Maimuni dismisses briefly the talmudic story concerning the fraternization of the king with an assembly of Jews as a gesture for the sake of peace.133 In general, 132 M. T. Ma'aser 9, 1-2. Cf. also C. M. to Ma'aser Sheni V, 15 (repeated by the translator to Sotah IX, 10). These two Mishnahs and the discussion Sotah 48a are the main sources. Maimuni's historical qualification: nirin n;r, p'n xr lyv was hardly intended to draw a distinction between this Jobanan the high priest and his heretical namesake John Hyrcanus, as suggested by Karo ad loc. Evidently both lived after Simon the Pious who, according to Maimuni, succeeded Ezra and, even as Onias' father, died at least two hundred years before the fall of Jerusalem. This characterization evidently was to convey to the reader the notion that this measure, like that concerning the abolition of the declaration of tithe by the same high priest (see n. 124), was enacted in the early days of the Second Commonwealth in modification of Ezra's reform of the entire system of tithes.-In C. M. Introd. ch. IV and VI, however, Johanan the High Priest is identified as "Jobanan, son of Mata- tiah mentioned in the prayers in connection with the wars against the Greek kings" and placed in the fourth generation after Ezra alongside Joshua b. Perabia and Nittai of Arbela. I33 C. M. to Bik. III, 4 and to Sotah VII, 6 on the basis of the talmudic reversal of the friendly attitude of the Mishnah in Sotah 41b (=Tos. VII, 16) and B. B. 3b.

Cf. also Rashi's comment on the Mishnah (Sotah 41a s.v. ln,n) and the objection raised by the Tosafists (B. B. 3b s.v. i:). It is questionable, nevertheless, whether Maimuni knew that Agrippa's mother was Glaphyra, a non-Jewess. His partial Jewish descent through his grandmother, the Hasmonean Mariamne, if at all legally significant, could be disregarded in the light of B. B. 3b. 68</page><page sequence="65">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES he says, "it is well known that the state of affairs under the Second Temple was unsatisfactory, that the kings did not go the right way and appointed high priests by force, regardless of personal merits."I34 He knows that at that age came to the fore various religious currents, which called for specific emergency measures. For example, when Simon ben Shetah executed in Ascalon eighty women in one day without due process of law, he did not mean to establish thereby a legal precedent, but merely to meet a temporary emergency. Similarly a man was stoned for riding on horseback on the Sabbath, otherwise a minor transgression rather than a capital crime.I35 It was also the period of the rise of Sadduceeism. In accordance with the well-known talmudic narrative, Maimuni relates how Zadok and Boethus, two students of Antigonus, misunderstood their master's apophthegm that one must not serve God because of an expected reward. These disciples understood this to be an implied denial of a world to come. They soon proceeded to organize sects of their own and, in order to justify themselves before public opinion, declared that they believed in scriptural law but not in tradition. Through this subterfuge they got rid of many accepted commandments.I36 134 C. M. to Yoma I, 3, generalizing the statement concerning Joshua ben Gamala Yoma 18a and Yeb. 61a. 135 M. T.

Maimuni's description is partly colored by his knowledge of contemporary Karaism, with which he fully identifes that ancient sect. When he speaks of its numerous divisions and of the tendency to arbitrary inter- pretation of Scripture he reflects Karaite realities and their insistence, since the days of Anan, on "search well in the Torah." Notwithstanding the equivocal statement in Resp. No. 46 concerning the Karaites: oniN iKip' mKm , n D D n D n D'Din,l ,'p'ix it is likely that Maimuni knew the difference 69</page><page sequence="66">BARON They also added an erroneous interpretation of the biblical injunction concerning the observance of the Feast of Weeks "from the morrow after the day of rest" (Lev. 23.15), and differed in many other detailed regulations. In contrast to the traditional observance, for example, to place the incense on fire before the Ark in the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement, they demanded that it be prepared on the fire before. That is why the rabbis introduced an elaborate annual ceremony to test the orthodoxy of the officiating high priest. Sadducees dif- fered also in the ritual of burning the red heifer.137 Notwithstand- ing their numerous divisions, they found successors throughout the ages, such as those known under the name Karaites in Egypt. Maimuni insists that these sectarians be strictly segregated from the Jews and that the majority of rabbis rightly dissented from between the Samaritans and the Sadducees and Karaites.-The Pharisees, on the other hand, are for him, as they usually are in the Aggadah, not a sect, but a group of exceedingly pious Jews who go beyond the letter of the law in fulfilling certain commandments. They eat, for example, even ordinary food in a state of purity. C. M. to IHag. II, 7 and Tohorot IV, 12, on the basis of the latter Mishnah. 137 The following doctrinal and legal deviations of the Sadducees are men- tioned in Maimuni's writings: 1) The denial of a world to come, C. M. to Abot I, 3; Ber' IX, 1, etc.-2) The repudiation of tradition, ibid.; M. T. Teshubah 3, 8, etc.-3) The date of the Feast of Weeks. M. T. Temidin u-Musafin 7, 11 on the basis of Men. 65 f.

Parah 'Adumah 1, 14 on the basis of M. Parah III, 7; Yoma 2a, etc. In C. M. to Parah ibid. he mentions briefly this opinion of 'pl'nr nxp, a qualification which was probably due to his knowledge of Karaite opinion on the subject.--6) The prostration before an idol need not be performed by the stretching of arms and legs in order to fall under that biblical prohibition. C. M. to Hor. I, 3 (includes the two other illustrations of the Mishnah); M. T. Shegagot 14, 2 (without naming the Sadducees); Resp. No. 365 on the basis of Hor. 4a. Cf. also M. T.

Jose when he taught that a Sadokite woman usually observed the laws of menstrual impurity on a par with a Jewess.I38 Another sectarian leader was Jesus. He is to be regarded as a Jew because his mother was a Jewess. He contended that he was sent by God to clarify perplexities in the Torah and that he was the Messiah predicted by all preceding prophets.

Issure Biah 15, 3.-Maimuni frequently refers to Christians in his writings. He mentions their belief in the abrogation of the old dispensation M. T. Teshubah 3, 8; discusses their well-known homiletical derivation of the trinitarian creed from 'n urnm 'n in the Shema' (Kobes II, 7c, cf. also M. N. I, 50); accepts the Christian tradition that the rabbis were instrumental in the crucifixion of Jesus I. T. 1. c.; and declares that even if one were to believe in Jesus' miracles, there would still be a thousand proofs from Scripture even from the Christian point of view that Jesus was not the Messiah, ibid. p. 48 (Kobes II, 7a). Neverthe- less, Maimuni's information concerning early Christianity seems to have come exclusively from Jewish and Muslim sources. His unfamiliarity with the gospels is also attested by his assumption that the paraclete mentioned in John 14.26; 16.7, etc. was the equivalent of the Arabic Ahmed rather than Muhammed. I. T. p. 30 (Kobes II, 4a). Otherwise he does not seem to oppose the strange gematria, apparently first advanced by Tabari, that paraclet numerically equals Muhammad bin 'Abdallah an-Nabbiyul-Hadi (M. son of Abd., the rightly guiding prophet) or in the Syriac form paracleta = M. Rasulun .Habibun Tayyibun (M. is a beloved and good apostle). Cf. his The Book of Religion and Empire, Engl. transl. A. Mingana, Manchester 1922, pp. 140-42.- Maimuni knows that the Minim in the Talmud are not Sadducees (cf. Resp. No. 46), but he also fails to identify them with the Christians. He comes close to such identification, however, when with reference to Sanh. 99a, Ber. 12a and j. Ber. I, 8, 3c he mentions that some Minim acknowledged the divine authority of the Decalogue alone and that therefore the sages discontinued its daily recitation, or when in discussing the new benediction instituted in the days of R.

Historically, Maimuni identifies them with the heretics of various ages, such as the disciples of Doeg, Achitophel, Gehazi and Elisha Aher. Cf. also n. 152. 71</page><page sequence="68">BARON On account of their trinitarian doctrine the Christians are legally in the category of heathens with whom one must not have any dealings on Sunday or, in Palestine, even during the preceding three days. Evidently living in a Muslim environment Maimuni could indulge in the luxury of prohibiting commercial intercourse with the Christian minority during one to four days of each week. On the other hand, in view of their qualified approval of Jewish Scripture, they may be given instruction in its Jewish interpretation, in the hope that they may realize their error and join the ranks of full-fledged Jews.140 After Jesus there appeared another reformer, a descendant of Esau. Because of his glaring inconsistencies, however, he turned out to be much less harmful.I41 The orthodox majority was throughout that period secure under the leadership of its rabbinic teachers. At first there was a Sanhedrin in Jerusalem consisting of seventy-one distinguished members of noble descent. The selection was very rigid, inas- much as representatives of this highest tribunal traversed all of Palestine, selected the best members of every community and appointed them to serve as local judges. (From among these 140 M. T. 'Abodat Kokabim 9, 4 and C. M. to 'Ab. Zarah I, 3 referring to the talmudic discussion A. Z. 8a ff. The rabbis in Christian lands naturally had to find excuses for trading with Christians on Sunday. Cf. e. g., Maimuni Glosses ad. loc. quoting R. Samuel b. Meir and R. Baruch b. Isaac.-For the permission of instruction cf. Resp. No. 364, with reference to Sanh. 59a. Cf. also Abraham Maimuni's remark quoted by Eppenstein, MbM II, 87. 141 I. T. p. 19 (Kobes II, 2a). It has long been suggested that Maimuni refers here to Mani. Although his statements are so vague that no definite conclusion may be drawn, it appears that he accepted the usual succession of religious reformers as found among his Jewish predecessors and successors. For Abraham bar Hiyya, for example, cf. above n. 6. The major difficulty consists in Maimuni's characterization: ivy '3: (which incidentally is omitted in Nahum Ma'arabi's translation), while the most reliable sources agree that he was a Babylonian (of Persian origin). It seems, however, that among the Jews the notion was current that he had first been a Christian, and Barhe- braeus' statement to this effect (Historia compendiosa dynastiarum, ed. Pococke, Oxford 1663, p. 82) a few decades later may well have been derived from his Jewish ancestors. That Jews contributed to his execution, however, is nowhere recorded. The more common story of his death, such as reported by Bar Hiyya, is essentially related by Al-Biruni, Chronology pp. 207-9 (Engl. transl. pp. 189-92) and others. 72</page><page sequence="69">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES were very likely selected the members of the little sanhedrins placed in cities of one hundred and twenty adult male Jews or over.) The best were drafted successively for service in the two little sanhedrins in Jerusalem, placed at the entrance of the Temple mountain and that of the Temple court, until finally they appeared as candidates for office in the Great Sanhedrin itself. The wisest among them served as chairman and was called by the sages nasi (patriarch), taking the place of Moses.I42 The lineage of each member appears so much above any possibility of doubt that even today, by merely tracing a priest's descent through a series of pure-blooded ancestors to a member of the Sanhedrin, one proves conclusively his indubitable Aaronide extraction.143 This Sanhedrin was first placed in the chamber Gazit of the Temple itself until, under the stress of foreign domination, it had to go through ten migrations. After the fall of Jerusalem it was transferred to Yabne and, ultimately, to Tiberias.I44 As long as this high court existed, says Maimonides, 142 M. T. Sanh. 1 and 2 on the basis of the well-known discussions in b. Sanh., etc. With respect to the selection of candidates in the provinces Maimuni follows the reading of Tos. Sanh. VIII, 1; Hag. II, 9, etc.: l'nSr' DcDi 1'p-lln rather than that of Sanh. 88b: 1'nmilt l'mni DoD which seems to indicate appointment by correspondence. Following strictly the talmudic sources Maimuni is not even aware of the problem, which has puzzled modern scholars, as to whether the high priest or the rabbinic nasi was the presiding officer, the former being intimated by extra-talmudic sources, such as Josephus and the New Testament. Cf. e. g., Z. Taubes, Ha-Nasi ba-Sanhedrin ha-Gedolah, Vienna 1925. In describing the seating arrangement (1, 3) Maimuni follows Tos. Sanh. VIII, 1. He reads with certain Mss. in the testimony of R. Eleazar b. R. Zadok: ,ir', N3N omitting n-in. Cf. also Kesef Mishneh ad. loc. In C. M. Introd., however, in describing Moses' instruction of the seventy elders he places Aaron and one of his sons to Moses' right. 43 M. T. Issure Biah 20, 2 and C. M. to Kid. IV, 5, on the basis of that Mishnah; b. Kid. 76b; Sanh. 36b. In C. M. he refers to M. Middot V, 4, where the Sanhedrin's function in probing priestly lineage is described. He also promises more extensive comments on the subject in C. M. to Sanh., but none are found in our editions, not even to IV, 2 where the Talmud 36b repeats its remarks of Kid. 76b with the citation of Num. 11.16 which Maimuni likewise quotes. 144 M. T.

A court could reverse an action of its predecessors only if it was "larger in wisdom and numbers," even in cases, when the cause underlying the original decision had disappeared. To meet the objection that all the high tribunals were of equal size and consisted of seventy-one judges-which was incidentally also true of the geonic court-Maimuni introduces the characteristic distinction that a court supported by a more numerous sector of enlightened public opinion is to be regarded as superior in numbers.145 Apart from civil matters the sanhedrins enjoyed also the privilege of criminal jurisdiction. Capital punishment, however, was restricted to the time when the sanhedrins were stationed in the Temple, i. e., until forty years before its destruction.I46 partment could be assigned to the meetings of the Sanhedrin with its numerous non-priestly members. Maimuni follows the source concerning the ten migra- tions in R. H. 31, including the messianic prediction that Tiberias will also be the starting point at the end of days. By using the term high court rather than Sanhedrin, he avoids the difficulties inherent in the often contradictory use of the latter designation in the talmudic sources. He stresses, however, specifically: nny 'y lrn 51a -Irny t6 DBDni. This has a decidedly polemical sound, probably directed against the use of this high-sounding title by the Academy in Bagdad. Cf. the passages listed by V. Aptowitzer, Formularies of Decrees and Documents from a Gaonic Court JQR N. S. IV (1913-4) pp. 35 ff. and J.

Makkot as the source for the decision by public opinion, but I have not been able to locate any such passage in our text of j. 146 M. T. Sanh. 14, 11-14 combining the two talmudic prerequisites for capital jurisdiction: the existence of an officiating priest and the functioning of the Sanhedrin in its own original location in the Temple, on the basis of Sanh. 52b and'Ab. Zarah 8b. Once these two prerequisites were met, a little sanhedrin consisting of members ordained in Jerusalem could and did exercise capital jurisdiction even in the diaspora. Cf. Tos. Sanh.

Maimonides mentions the five generations of Jose b. Yoezer and Jose b. Johanan; Joshua b. Perahiah and Nittai of Arbela; Judah b. Tabbai and Simon b. Shetah; Shemaiah and Abtalion; Hillel and Shammai.147 The number of the adherents of the two schools of Hillel and Shammai varied from time to time. During the meeting in the upper chamber of Hananiah b. Hez- ekiah, a profound student of Ezekiel, there were assembled all the ordained students of Jewish law in that generation. It happened that the Shammaites were then in the majority and so they passed the so-called eighteen (controversial) enact- ments.I48 On the whole, however, Hillel's authority was superior. He was both through learning and Davidic descent so widely and ;n,innz lP'1i in Tos. Maimuni does not seem to object, nonetheless, to the infliction of capital punishment on informers as practiced already in his day in Spain. Cf. n. 170. M.

Feigenbaum] nimn nrw 'oD nlmDail nlmnDi3 ",1,, Frankfort 1889, p. 140. Maimuni seems to have given preference to the interpretation in Midrash Tannaim on Deut. 16.18, ed. Hoffmann p. 197, and that is why he quotes the entire verse, deriving his interpretation from 1I lni3 rather than from i'nyw. Cf. also Nahmanides on Deut. ibid. 147 M. T. Introd. and C. M. Introd.

The assumption that all the scholars of the generation were present is necessary in order to explain the meaning of the majority in such an accidental gathering. This assumption seems to underlie the venturesome narrative about the use of brutal force by the Shammaites in j. Shab. I, 4, 3b, which is otherwise ignored by Maimuni. His enumeration of the eighteen enactments conflicts in part with both b. and j. Cf. Zerahiah ha-Levi, Ha-Maor ha-Gadol on Alfasi's reproduction of M. Shab.

Under his authority, the prosbol was instituted, which had permanent validity because it abrogated merely a rabbinic regulation. With the revival of the full Sabbatical law according to the Torah in the Messianic age, the prosbol will no longer be practiced.149 In the days of R. Gamaliel the Elder it became customary to study the Torah standing, but after his death the bodies grew weaker and they reverted to sitting during the study of the law.s15 After the fall of Jerusalem the rabbis gathered under R.

Maimuni possibly understood the nr n,m -nil lprm 1rtn which obviously refers to the house of Hillel as implying the restoration of a procedure prevalent in the years between Hillel and Johanan b. Zakkai. He also assumes that the second rather than the first change restored fully the original prerogative and that ny3n m'm -T' meant the co6peration of the vice-president.-C. M. to Sheb. X, 3 and M. T. Shemitta ve-Yobel 9, 16-17 referring to Git. 35a ff. In C. M. he enjoins the courts to protect a poor debtor by accepting his claim that the Sabbatical year had annulled his debt and to advance this argument for the sake of the debtor's heirs, while in Mf. T. he stresses that only a high tribunal, such as that headed by R. Ammi and R. Assi, was entitled to issue a prosbol. In other words, the prosbol is a necessary evil, enacted for social reasons, and should be dispensed with wherever possible. That it was, nevertheless, a necessity under the advanced economy of early Islam, may be seen in the inclusion of the writ in the formularies of R. Judah al-Barceloni. Cf. his Sefer ha-Shetarof, ed. Halberstam, Berlin 1898, No. 48. The absence of this document in Hai's similar collection is undoubtedly due to its general incompleteness. Cf. S.

He believed in Bar Kokeba as the king-messiah and suffered death with the innumerable thousands killed after the fall of Bethar.

Tarfon lived after the destruction of the Temple, and that 153 That R. Akiba was mainly R. Eliezer's disciple is emphasized C. M. Introd.; to Sheb. VIII, 9 and M. T. Introd., although in the first passage the testimony of the Talmud (Ket. 84b) is invoked, according to which he had received some instruction also from R. Tarfon. Maimuni does not men- tion, however, his study under R. Joshua (from whom he received his ordina- tion) and Nahum of Gimzo. Cf. Ab. R. N. VI (ed. Schechter p. 29); j. Sanh. I, 3, 19a; Ber. 22a. Cf. also Zacuto, YuFasin, p. 37b. In C. M. to Sotah V, 2 he denies specifically any direct instruction by R. Johanan b. Zakkai. M. T. Melakim II, 3 cites on the basis of j. Ta'anit IV, 8, 68d R. Akiba's support of Bar Kokeba as an illustration for the doctrine that no outward signs or miracles are necessary to identify the Messiah. Maimuni overstates the case not only when he calls R. Akiba lInn 'rtnri l Iw rl, twn (cf. the objections of Zacuto, 1. c. and Karo ad. loc.), but he says that all the scholars of the generation saw in Bar Kokeba a king-messiah. (Cf. also M. T. Ta'aniot 5, 3 on the basis of Ta'an. 26b, 29a, etc.). He may have discarded the legend of the execution of the pretender by the rabbis themselves (Sanh. 93b, cited by RABD ad. loc.), because it was controverted by the legally and historically more defendable tradition of his death at the hands of the enemy (Lam. r. 2, 2; cf. Migdal 'Oz and Kesef Mishneh ad. loc.). He should have thought, however, of the opposition of R. Eleazar of Modi'in, Bar Kokeba's uncle, and R. Jobanan b. Toreta, recorded in j. Ta'anit 1. c. The martyrdom of R. Akiba and his associates as well as of the martyrs of Lydda is cited I. S. p. la quoting Pes. 50a as one which vouchsafes the world to come to the victim, regardless of other merits.-S. MA. Commandment 153 refers to R. Akiba's proclamation of a leap year in Nehardea, recorded in M. Yeb. XVI, 7. Maimuni explains this as having occurred during the absence of authorized scholars in Palestine, which can only mean to say, during some sort of upheaval. Modern scholars, however, usually date R. Akiba's journey around 110 C. E., i. e., even before the outbreak of the revolt against Trajan which caused minor disturbances in Palestine. 154 M. T. Kiddush ha-Hodesh 5, 3, on the basis of R.

Meir may serve as a living illustra- tion of one who paid lip service to non-Jewish beliefs under con- straint without in the slightest betraying his staunch orthodoxy.I55 Throughout that period the process of progressive interpreta- tion of the law was steadily going on. Maimuni enumerates ninety-one rabbis in whose name traditions are handed down in the Mishnah, in addition to twenty-seven others, recorded there in conjunction with some historical illustration.'56 Finally Judah the Patriarch, whose authority was such as to enable him, for example, to exempt Scythopolis (Bet Shan) from the obligation of paying tithes, compiled the Mishnah,1s7 which was followed I55 C. M. to Neg. XIV, 13 quoting Sifra. I. S. p. 8a referring to 'Ab. Zarah 18a f.-As in the case of R. Akiba M. T. Introd. emphasizes R.

I57 M. T. Terumot 1, 5 on the basis of Hul. 6b. In contrast to Rashi, Tosafot and RABD, Maimuni regards this liberation from tithes as extending over all grains and not only vegetables, since he regards the entire system of tithes after the Restoration under Ezra as based upon a rabbinic regulation rather than binding Mosaic law. Cf. M. T. ibid. ?26.-On the basis of j. Sheb. VI, 1, 36c and Yeb. VII, 3, 8a, Maimuni ascribes to R. Judah also the liberation of Ascalon. Both texts contain the name Rabbi, against Kesef Mishneh ad loc. (Cf. also Tos. Ohalot XVIII, 18.) The latter's query why Maimuni failed to mention the three other cities included by j. Demai II, 1, 22c in the patriarch's reform, may perhaps be answered by the example set to this effect in b. Ijul. 6b. Although realizing that R. Akiba and R. Ishmael had already composed their respective Mekiltas, Maimuni states, almost in the same breath, that from the days of Moses to those of R. Judah the Patriarch no work was written to instruct the public in oral law and that the leaders of the intervening generations wrote down notes of what they had heard from their teachers for their own use, but gave only oral instruction to others. M. T. Introd. Perhaps he regarded the two Mekiltas as such personal notes. As to the other Tannaitic collections, he states that they were assembled in the generation following R. Judah's by R. HIiyya (Tosefta); R. Hoshaya (a tannaitic collection on Genesis=Gen. r.) and Abba Arika (various Baraitot, such as Sifra and Sifre). Ibid and C. M. Introd. Notwithstanding the well- known statement in Sanh. 86a, 'Er. 96b, etc. concerning the major trend in Sifra and Sifre (-niD onD), the name debe-Rab and the citation of authorities later than R. Judah has induced many medieval and modern scholars to 79</page><page sequence="76">BARON by similar compilations of Baraitot. All these collections, how- ever, are merely part of a vaster body of tannaitic tradition. For example, a controversy between R. Judah and R. Simon cannot be traced back to any of the tannaitic sources, and must have originally been part of such an unwritten Baraita. Both Hai Gaon and Rabenu Nissim failed to locate the source of that controversy.1'8 Later on R. Johanan compiled the Palestinian, R. Ashi and Rabina the Babylonian Talmud about three and four hundred years, respectively, after the fall of Jerusalem. Around that time other sages compiled various Midrashim.159 The center of gravity gradually moved to Babylonia. To be sure, down to the days of Rabbah and Abaye Palestinian law reigned supreme. But this was due to the persecutions suffered at that time by Babylonian Jewry.160 Otherwise the Babylonian exilarchs were the legitimate substitutes for the ancient Judean kings to exercise dominion over all Israel. That is why an authorization obtained by a judge from the exilarch frees him ascribe their redaction to Rab. Maimuni is also a great admirer of R. Judah's style. Not only does he praise the expert knowledge of all shades of the Hebrew language manifested by the author of the Mishnah (C. M. Introd.: even R. Judah's servants were frequently consulted in linguistic matters; cf. R. H. 26b), but wishes to emulate this style in his own great legal compilation. Cf. S. M. Introd. 158 Resp. No. 58, quoting R. Nissim's Mafteaiz (cf. his Commentary on Shab. 105b). As illustrations he cites the Mishnah of Bar Kappara or R. Hoshaya, evidently neither of which he had seen. Cf. I. Halevy, Dorot ha-Rishonim II, 123-5. Cf. also n. 157. s59 M. T. Introd. The chronology is, of course, not very exact. He has probably in mind the large midrashic collections, such as the Rabbot. He must have known of many younger aggadic compilations, since this type of literary creativity was continued long beyond his own day. 160 Resp. No. 349 commenting on an uncomplimentary utterance of R. Jere- miah on the subject of Babylonian scholarship in Yoma 57a. He quotes another similar utterance of R. Jeremiah from Sanh. 24a and an anecdote concerning R. Ze'era's attempt to forget his Babylonian training from B. M. 85a, but explains them all as referring to the temporary decline of Jewish learning there on account of severe persecutions which occurred during the two generations of Rabbah, R. Joseph, Abaye and Raba. He quotes B. M. 86a and Uul. 46a. Soon afterwards, however, and especially in the days of R. Ashi, Babylonian learning reached a high degree of fruition, as is seen Git. 59a and Sanh. 36a. 80</page><page sequence="77">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES from personal liability for misjudgment in any Jewish com- munity, whereas the same authorization by the Palestinian patriarch has this effect only with respect to the Holy Land. On the other hand, Maimuni realizes that the exilarchs of the talmudic period frequently failed to live up to the requirements of righteous government. Some of them were, in fact, such ruthless despots that, in contrast to the ordinary citizens, their possession of a certain piece of property over a period of years was no proof of its legal acquisition.161 In that period appeared also many translations of Scripture. Maimonides speaks of Syriac, Greek, Persian and Latin (Arabic) versions in existence a long time before Muhammed. He seems personally to have been familiar only with the Aramaic versions, especially with that of Onkelos whom, following tradition, he revered as the disciple of R. Eliezer and R. Joshua.162 i6I C. M. to Bek. IV, 4 and M. T. Sanh. 4, 12-13 and 6, 2, on the basis of the Babylonian orientation of Sanh. 5a, etc. However, in C. M. ibid IV, 3, referring back to C. M. to Hor. (especially I, 5 on the basis of Hor. 5a ff.) and in M. T. Bek. 3, 1 he admits, as does his talmudic source, that an authoriza- tion of the Palestinian patriarch and not one of the exilarch enabled a scholar to declare a first-born animal as being without blemish. More significantly M. T. Sanh. 5, 8 admits, on the basis of B. IK. 84a f., etc. that the very founda- tion of Jewish administration of justice in the dispersion rests upon a general mandate of the only legitimate Palestinian court, to which alone the title Elohim of Ex. 22.7-8 may be applied.-M. T. To'en ve-Nit'an 13, 2.10 classifies on the basis of B. B. 36a the talmudic exilarchs on a par with robbers and Gentiles as men of violence. Out of deference to the contemporary exilarchs Maimuni stresses in both passage: lDr iiN 5w nm,' rvn and onzn r ' , r. 162 I. T. p. 28 (Kobes II, 3d). In his defence against the accusation of Jewish forgeries of Scripture Maimuni adduces the existence of several ancient trans- lations for the Gentile public. The Syriac version refers obviously to the Peshitta, as the Greek refers to the Septuagint. The ry7 of the Hebrew trans- lations of I. T. (in the Arabic Mss. no equivalent is found) can hardly refer to an Arabic version existent before Muhammed. It is much rather the equivalent of Latin. Cf. BB p. 175. Nothing is known of the existence of an ancient or medieval Persian version of the Bible.-Onkelos is frequently referred to in Maimonides' writings. Cf. especially M. N. II, 33 quoting Meg. 3a; C. M. Eight Chapters 7; S. M. Prohib. 128; M. T. Ishut 8, 4 and Issure Biah 12, 13. In the latter passage he invokes the translation of Deut. 23.18 as testimony of the severity of the sin committed by cohabiting with a slave, but in the face of contradictory biblical and talmudic evidence he refuses to follow the translator in declaring it a direct legal prohibition. 81</page><page sequence="78">BARON VI. UNDER ISLAM. Maimonides has little to say about the five centuries which had elapsed from the rise of Muhammed to his own birth. Fol- lowing an apparently prevalent usage he calls the founder of Islam a "madman," with both religious and political aspirations, who failed to formulate any new religious idea, but merely restated well-known concepts. Nevertheless, he attracted a large following and inflicted many wrongs upon the Jews, being himself responsible for the massacre of 24,000.163 Following his example the Muslims of the subsequent generations oppressed the Jews and debased them even more harshly than any other nation. This statement is an obvious reflection of Maimuni's own earlier experiences in Spain and Morocco. He admits, 163 I. T. pp. 19 f. (Kobes II, 2a) and I. S. p. 8b, where the figure of victims quoted by Maimuni from his opponent without contradiction is given as 52,000. The lower figure is found in ed. Geiger, op. cit., p. 3a and Kobe, II, 13b. The bloody suppression of the Jews of Yathrib and Khaibar (some twenty tribes are recorded) by Muhammed and Omar I is a well-known historical fact, but the two figures seem, nonetheless, decidedly exaggerated. They are undoubtedly based upon old Muslim traditions, such as that con- cerning the 10,000 Jewish warriors in Khaibar. The Jews themselves were interested in overemphasizing their strength so as to discourage attacks. Cf. R. Leszynsky, Die Juden in Arabien zur Zeit Mohammeds, Berlin 1910, pp. 86 ff. The epithet ylwn for Muhammed is used also by R. Sherira Gaon and others.-Maimuni argues against the veracity of Muhammed's preachment or that of Omar and Zeid on objective rather than national grounds. He specifically stresses in this connection I. T. p. 33 (Kobes II, 4c), as he does more elaborately in his theories of prophecy C. M. Introd. and M. N. II, that non-Jews, such as Job and his friends, may be true prophets just as born Jews may turn out to be false prophets.-Maimuni's effort comprehensively to disprove alleged biblical forebodings of the appearance of Muhammed (I. T. pp. 27 ff.; Kobes II, 3c ff.) is understandable in view of the great weight carried by such argu- ments at that time. No lesser an historian than Tabari actually quotes Deut. 18.15; 33.2-3 as early biblical references to the founder of Islam, curiously arguing from the text of 18.15 that it cannot refer to Jesus. Cf. his The Book of Religion and Empire, Engl. transl., London 1922, pp. 85 ff. Cf. also H. Hirschfeld, Mohammedan Criticism of the Bible JQRO. S. XIII (1901) pp. 222- 40. Maimuni in disputing these and similar interpretations is right in saying that they had long "been controverted after having gained widespread popu- larity" and that the enlightened Muslims themselves no longer believed in such "proofs." 82</page><page sequence="79">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES however, that the persecution to which he had fallen victim had no parallel in history inasmuch as the enforced profession of faith consisted exclusively in lip service. The Almohades were perfectly aware of the insincerity of these professions, and did not mind it. But we hear from Maimonides himself what dangers were attached to such a verbal declaration, if one returned publicly to Judaism in a more tolerant country. He also mentions that the Christians resisted more staunchly than the Jews, and more frequently chose the alternative of martyr- dom. In this rebuke to his coreligionists, he fails to take cog- nizance of the mass conversions of the Christian peoples of western Asia and northern Africa which in the preceding cen- turies had been the main cause of Islam's rapid expansion. At that time, at least, the Jews must have been more persevering.'64 The bitter experiences of his youth failed to nurture in Maimonides rabid anti-Muslim feelings. Although frequently reiterating that the Arabs, as descendants of Ishmael are not 164 I. S. passim and I. T. passim. The danger which threatened Maimuni on account of an Arab's accusation in Egypt that he, previously a convert to Islam, had relapsed into Judaism (recorded in Al-Kifti ed. Lipper p. 113) is referred to in his remark to Jephet ben Elijah: yin3 nri1' nlni niv ',lynt Dm nni,l D n'y D 1 D n -i y1i 1 n' m 33n1 ,'Xnn o'n (ed. Geiger, op. cit., p. 6b and Kobes II, 37d). That this remark should refer to his Jewish oppon- ents, as suggested by Eppenstein, MbM II, 39n. 3, is not supported by any evidence. On what other grounds than alleged apostasy, moreover, could even Jewish informers expect to bring about the condemnation to death of a highly esteemed physician and rabbi? This leaves, of course, in abeyance the moot question as to whether Maimon's family outwardly professed Islam under the Almohades or merely refrained from publicly adhering to Judaism. Cf. the literature cited in A. Berliner, MbM II, 104-30. In any case it would have been merely lip service, as stressed in I. S.-The stauncher resistance of the Christians to the Almohade persecutions, partly attested also through Arabic sources (cf. S. Munk, Notice sur Joseph Ben-Iehouda, pp. 44 f.), need not have had any further stimulus, but the greater dependance of the Catholic Church upon public worship than that of Judaism.-It also appears that the persecutions were much less severe in Morocco than in Spain, which may have been the reason for Maimon's family emigrating to Africa. We hear that at least in 1170 Yakub Almanzur, while still intolerant in his European possessions, permitted some of his "mozarab" subjects to erect churches in Morocco. Cf. Fr. Javier Simonet, Historia de los Mozdrabes de Espana, Madrid 1897-1903, p. 770. 83</page><page sequence="80">BARON really "the seed of Abraham" referred to in Scripture, because only in Isaac and Jacob "shall seed be called to thee" (Gen. 21.12), he consistently declines to classify Islam as a pagan religion. Even the heathen memories and practices connected with the Kaba stone in Mecca did not in his opinion detract from the essentially monotheistic doctrine. This contention is put into bolder relief when one considers Maimuni's acceptance of the notions prevalent among the Muslims concerning Christian trinitarianism as equivalent with polytheism.165 This moderate attitude finds expression also with respect to the Karaites. Viewing the Karaite schism as a direct continua- tion of Sadduceeism he, nevertheless, enjoins his coreligionists to treat them in a friendly fashion and to persuade them to return to Judaism. Such toleration is to be extended only to those who refrain from abusing the rabbinic sages, however.'66 As long as they profess their heresy, they must not be invited to join the quorum of three or ten Jews for benedictions and prayers, nor are their divorces legally valid. Nonetheless a woman married in accordance with the Karaite ritual requires a regular Jewish writ of divorce.'67 i65 Cf. I. T. p. 28 (Kobes II 3d) and, especially, Resp. No. 369. The identi- fication of certain elements of Islamic ritual (a continuation of pre-Islamic Arabic practices) with the heathen worship of Pe'or, Kemosh and Mercury as described in 'Ab. Zarah 64a, belongs to the class of those facile identifica- tions so prevalent in Greek and Arabian historiography. Maimuni stresses that the Arabs themselves were clearly aware of their pagan origin. For his attitude to Christianity, cf. above n. 139-40. i66 M. T. Mamrim 3, 3, Resp. No. 371, which quotes numerous talmudic passages, as well as R. Judah and R. Hai Gaon (for the identity of the former cf. the references in the editor's note to p. 341). It refers specifically to the Karaites of Egypt, Damascus and the other Muslim countries. The friendly attitude of both Hai and Maimuni may perhaps have come from their appre- hension that otherwise many of these sectarians would adopt Islam. At least, Ibn Yahya reports such mass desertion from Karaism to the dominant creed. Cf. Schreiner MGWJ XLII, 260. That Maimuni's friendliness bore fruit in helping induce numerous Karaites in 1213 to embrace rabbanite Judaism is suggested by Eppenstein, MbM II, 44. I67 Resp. Nos. 14 and 162. The attempt to impugn the authenticity of the latter responsum (cf. Ohale Ya'akob quoted in the editor's note), is altogether baseless. The non-validity of Karaite acts in all cases where they do not acknowledge rabbanite law is frequently stressed by Maimuni. C. M. to 84</page><page sequence="81">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES Among his geonic predecessors Maimonides mentions only Saadia and Hai by name. In one connection he even speaks of the philacteries used by the latter gaon, about which he had heard from a reliable source. His references to Saadia are mostly of a philosophical nature. Only with respect to Saadia's com- putation of the date of the Messiah he cites extenuating personal circumstances. More frequently he refers to Alfasi and Isaac ibn Migash. But in general he names an author primarily when he wishes to combat that author's opinion, whereas in the case of agreement he confines himself to such generic terms as "the geonim have taught," "the geonim have enacted," "the majority of the geonim think so and so," etc. Occasionally he distinguishes between the "former" and the "latter" geonim. But even under 'Er. VI, 2 (quoting 'Er. 68b f.) and M. T. Erubin 2, 16 prohibit association with "Sadducees, Boethuseans and all who deny the oral law" in erecting an 'Erub. inim l'n'YD 1' lnr'y nlmn ;n 1mi ,, 5iw ' i: n- r 1i : is the same motiva- tion as that offered in the two responsa. C. M. to Hul. I, 2 goes further and not only excludes these heretics from the class of o-nmD whose slaughteringis declared valid by the Talmud (3a and 17a), but postulates their complete annihilation, in order to prevent the contamination of rabbanite Jewry. "Know ye, that we have a tradition from our teachers" (this term, at least in the Hebrew usage of M. T., may also refer to a single teacher; cf. D"'DIn ', D No. 13 and A. Schwarz, Der Mishneh Torah, ein System der mosaisch-talm. Gesetzeslehre, Vienna 1905, p. 137), that the discontinuation of capital juris- diction in the diaspora applies only to Jews committing a capital crime, but not to Epicureans, Sadducees and Boethuseans who should be given no quarter. "Numerous legal precedents to this effect have been established in the western lands." It is possible that this harsh animosity carried over from Spain, where Karaism had been ruthlessly suppressed in the Jewish communities, was later toned down in the light of Egyptian realities. Cf. J. Mann, Jews in Egypt and Palestine under the Fatimid Caliphs, London 1920-22, passim. Maimuni's enactments in his adopted country, if animated by anti- Karaite bias as interpreted by Eppenstein, MbM II, 40 ff. (cf. Resp. No. 99: ',inpn 1rwD -nN D',im n, ,n '-i'T o'im omnl irx Do'nxn ,m3 I7N), are of a purely defensive character. Neither are his brief references to Kalam's influence on Karaite (and also rabbanite) thinkers (M. N. I, 71) or, for that matter, to the individualistic divergences of Karaite Bible commentators (implied in C. M. to Abot I, 3) more than mildly polemical. It is to be regretted that Maimuni (Resp. No. 14) has refrained from answering the broader question concerning the differences between rabbanism and Karaism submitted to him by his inquirers. Cf. ibid. p. 43 n. 4. Cf. also Assaf, op. cit., p. 58 and above n. 136-7. 85</page><page sequence="82">BARON the first geonim, the decline in learning was very marked, because "Israel's dispersion was greatly increased and they reached to the distant corners and islands; wars ravaged the world, armed bands obstructed the roads and the study of the Torah diminished; no longer did the Jews enter their academies in thousands and myriads, as they used to do before, but a small remnant of indi- viduals, with God's call in their hearts, gathered in every city and country to expound the Torah."'68 I68 M.

A. Schwarz, Das Verhaltnis Maimuni's zu den Geonen MbM I, 332-410 has assembled sixty- eight passages in M. T. where Maimuni expressly quotes the geonim, fre- quently (in 22 cases) rejecting their opinion. (It is to be noted that no less than 27 of these passages are to be found in those two sections of M. T. [books XII and XIII] which deal with civil law, thus illustrating the numerous adjustments of the law necessitated by the commercial civilization during the "Renaissance of Islam"). A similar number could easily be culled from Resp. and his other writings. But far more numerous are his tacit acceptances or rejections of geonic interpretations. Sometimes he even changes his mind and, after having followed the interpretation of a geonic predecessor, he reconsiders it after a more searching inquiry. Cf. especially, Resp. No. 240, where he explains on this score a contradiction between an early edition of C. M. and M. T.

Such benefit of doubt must not extend to a practical decision, however.-Among his numerous references to individual predecessors are especially noteworthy: 1) His exoneration of Saadia's messianic computation on the ground of the exceptional dangers threatening Judaism in his time. Were it not for his deeds and writings the heretical trends would almost have submerged the Torah. I. T. p. 39 (Kobes II, 5b). 2) His reference to Hai's phylacteries Resp. No. 7, in defence of the order of biblical passages as taught in M. T. Tefillin 3, 6. In the same connection Maimuni relates a story of how Moses Dar'ai, after arriving in Palestine from Morocco, discarded his phylacteries, because he recognized the validity of the proofs produced by the elder geonim. 3) Hefes b. Yasliab is quoted very rarely. In Resp. No. 240 he is cited merely to explain Maimuni's own 86</page><page sequence="83">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES The title "gaon" had by that time lost its technical meaning as due only to the heads of the two Babylonian academies, and is here used freely with respect to any outstanding scholar. Maimuni frequently speaks of the "western geonim," referring principally to those of Morocco and Kairowan. In fact, his relations to the contemporary Babylonian gaon, Samuel b. Ali of Bagdad, although outwardly courteous, were frequently strained. At the same time, he voices deep admiration for the learning of the younger communities of Christian France.'69 On the whole, he gives precedence to teachings and customs prevalent in Spain and Morocco to those of his adopted country, Egypt. However, he has few direct references to Spanish Jewish letters. In many of these he is decidedly polemical, as when he mentions a monograph on tefillin composed by Moses of Cordova erroneous interpretation. Nevertheless, B. Z. Halper, A Volume of the Book of Precepts of H. b. Y., Philad. 1915, pp. 59-88, has demonstrated that that work exerted a decisive influence on the early Halakic writings of Maimuni. 4) Alfasi looms large in Maimuni's mind. In C. M. Introd. he asserts that one may object only to few of the RIF's legal decisions, the total of such passages by no means exceeding ten. In a later Resp. (No. 353) he raises the number to thirty or more. This figure seems to be more or less accurate, since Maimuni, according to that communication, happened to be engaged at that time in the preparation of special scholia to Alfasi's Halakot. He also says that in part he followed Alfasi's own student Ibn Migash, and that in some cases he succeeded in tracing the error back to R. Ijananel. 169 Cf. e. g., M. T.

T. Malveh ve-Loveh 11, 11 acknowledges that "this is the practice in all Jewish courts in the world." Maimuni adds, nevertheless, that in the West special clauses in loan contracts provide that the creditor may obtain payment from the movable and immovable property both in the lifetime and after the death of the debtor, and highly commends this usage (nn=m iry 5vun )"m1) which obviates the frequent necessity of collecting from orphaned minors in the defiance of talmudic law. Although less specific, some such clauses appear in a few extant early Spanish contracts. Cf. e.g., U. Gonzalez Palencia, Los Mozdrabes de Toledo III, Madrid 1927, No. 1145 which, although concerning a gift, is referred to as iDv= mm1n =In, in which the donor pledges all her present and future fortune. They are not included in the loan contract published in Meir Abulafia's responsum in 'Or la-Saddikim, Salonica 1799, No. 262, nor in No. 3 of the early Spanish Shetarot, published by R. J. H.

Once asked as to whether this work contained true mysteries of the sages, he replied sharply, "God beware that such a matter should have come out of their hands. It is merely the work of one of the Greek preachers without any doubt. In short, the scrapping of this book and the blotting out of its subject matter is a mer- itorious deed."172 Sometimes he adduces contemporary usage in explanation of historical developments. Speaking, for example, of the talmudic legislation concerning the recitation of hallel on Hanukkah he states, "In these days I have observed totally divergent customs in different places with respect to its reading and congregational response." In discussing the laws of charity he declares that he had never heard of a Jewish community which punishment of informers, here intimated, directly executed or at least pro- nounced by Jewish courts (as is possibly intimated also in C. M. to H.ul. I, 2), or do the Jews merely hand over the criminal to the general courts for both condemnation and execution? 2) Do the :nynn ,ny include, as is usual, both Muslim Spain and Morocco, or do they refer here exclusively to Christian Spain, where at least in the later middle ages capital jurisdiction over informers was well established. More information about the Jewish judicial autonomy in Muslim Spain is needed before a definite answer to these questions may be given. J.

The prevalent custom today, he continues, is that the officers of the kuppah collect the dona- tions every day and distribute them on Friday. Taking cog- nizance of the numerous conversions of Jews to Islam (and also Christianity) he mentions the daily practice and theory of both the eastern and western geonim to allow the wife of a convert to collect her marriage settlement from his property. Although such practice is evidently against talmudic law, he approves of it as a legitimate penalty for apostasy. The contemporary usage of calling a Kohen to the Torah first, regardless of the superior learning or piety of an "Israelite" present, has, in his opinion, no historical foundation in either the biblical or talmudic legisla- tion. It has merely arisen out of the wish to avoid controversies in the community. "It has been daily practice in Spain," he asserts, "to force a defendant to follow the plaintiff to a higher court of distinguished scholars in another city, although we have no Great Tribunal similar to that of the talmudic age." The Sabbatical year is to be observed today and "the judge who, knowing of its binding force, fails to apply the law does not fear the Lord and robs the poor."I73 '73 M. T.

Commenting on the talmudic law which allowed the reading of the Book of Esther between the 11th and 15th of Adar and stated that the people of Susa used to read it on the fifteenth in commemoration of their own miracle, he insists that this applied only "to the time when we were powerful enough to observe the commandments in their fullness, but nowadays, i. e., from the redaction of the Talmud to the coming of the Messiah (speedily in our days), one reads it only in the regular days of the 14th and 15th." The reading on the fifteenth is restricted to the inhabitants of those Palestinian cities which had been walled in in the days of Joshua (cf. n. 82) and of Susa.

I74 M. T. Nizke Mamon 8, 5. Maimuni substitutes this rational and rela- tively humane motivation for the rigidly nationalistic ones given in B. K. 38a. Cf. also Mishneh le-Melek ad. loc. In C. M. to B. K. IV, 3 he had followed the anti-Gentile orientation of the two talmudic sages and stated that, in cases of damages, the Jew has the choice to apply either the Jewish or the Gentile law in question, dependent on which is more favorable to himself. "You need not be astounded by that as you are not perturbed over the slaugh- tering of innocent animals, because he who does not possess the full measure of human qualities is not really a full-fledged man, but the purpose of his existence is to satisfy the needs of real men. A discussion of this subject would require special treatment, however." In offering the argument of reciprocity, on the other hand, Maimuni pays no attention to the historical aspect of whether such practice existed in the Roman law of the time of R. Johanan and R. Abahu. As to Muslim law it may suffice to state here that even homicide and mayhem committed by a Muslim on a dhimmi was not punished by full retaliation. For the opinion of the Shiyites, e. g., cf. the thirteenth century compilation of Al-Muhakkik, transl. by A. Querry, Recueil des lois concernant les Musulmans schyites III, 11.137; 317-21 in Vol. II, Paris 1872, pp. 565 ff. and in general W. Heffening, Das islamische Fremden- recht, Hanover 1925, pp. 37-44. It is little wonder that RABD, no less unhis- torically, generalizes what apparently was Provengal usage in his time, and states that Gentile courts in such cases seize the animal in question. This in turn evoked the humorous reply of Vidal of Tolosa who pointed out that Spanish (probably = Catalan) law gave the right to the guilty man to remove his animal and thus escape punishment. Cf. Migdal' Oz ad. loc. Notwithstand- ing the possibility, however, that Maimuni spent some time in Christian Almeria (cf. Lebrecht-Berliner, MbM II, 114), his familiarity with the Chris- tian law of Spain is rather dubious. 91</page><page sequence="88">BARON Among the reasons for the prohibition of the use of pigs, Maimuni enumerates also the native uncleanliness of that animal. "Should pork be permitted for consumption, the market places and the houses would be dirtier than privies, as you may see it today in the Frankish countries." In other words, the superiority of the Islamic civilization over that of medieval Europe also in respect to order and tidiness appears to Maimuni as beyond any doubt.175 He also believes that there are primitive tribes possessing no religion whatsoever. Among these he enumerates "the extreme Turks that wander about in the north, the Kushites who live in the south and those in our clime who are like these.' 76 At the end of his Epistle to Yemen, Maimuni gives a brief sketch of several messianic movements, mostly within the living memory of his generation. This sketch is historically remarkable not only because it supplies historical information, otherwise unavail- able, but also because it shows Maimuni's attempt to dissuade his Yemenite correspondents from believing in their messianic pretender by arguments taken from history. Little wonder that to his wholly non-historically-minded Hebrew translators these 175 M. N.

This movement which had apparently begun in the Persian age, had assumed such proportions under the Caliphate, that in tenth century Sura it became proverbial that "he who goes to India gets rich." Cf. Saadia, Beliefs and Opinions, Introd. Characteristically, I.

HISTORICAL CHRONOLOGY. In all historical considerations Maimuni shows a decidedly chronological bent. 'Not only does he place personalities and events in their proper historical sequence and carefully avoids confusing dates, but he has frequent discussions on the topic of chronology. Of course, this is not detached historical curiosity; in each case, he attempts primarily to clarify some legal or moral issue involved. Nevertheless, he sifts all available sources of information with the view of establishing a proper chronological order.I78 177 This material has been first published in Hebrew translation and inter- preted by J. Mann at the end of his comprehensive Hebrew study of the Messianic Movements during the first Crusades in Hatekufah XXIII (1925) pp. 243-61 and XXIV (1928) pp. 335-58. I78 Interest in chronology was generally very vivid under Islam, where the accuracy of a tradition was frequently checked by chronological details. This applied not only to controversial literary and theological problems, but also to political and economic privileges claimed by various groups in the popula- tion. It is reported, for example, that a document produced by a Jew of Khai- bar, in which allegedly 'Ali b. Abi Talib at Muhammed's order granted the Jews of that region a remission of the poll tax, was proved to be forged by certain anachronisms in the names of witnesses: one had died two years before the taking of Khaibar, another became a Muslim a year later. Cf. Margoliouth, Arabic Historians, p. 149. Some Arabs took pains to establish even the chronologies of the unbelievers. For a contemporary of Saadia cf. M. Stein- schneider, Die Jiidische Chronik nach Hamza el-Isfahani in Zeitschriftfiir die religiosen Interessen des Judentums II (1845) pp. 271-78 and 321-28. With the work of Al-Biruni, particularly, chronology in the mathematical as well as historical sense, became a highly developed science.-For the mathematical aspects of Maimuni's chronological work, especially important where he discusses the Jewish calendar, cf. E. Baneth, Maimonides als Chronologe und Astronom MbM II, 243-79.-Maimuni's chronological sense is frequently revealed by such incidental remarks as when, after enumerating the Tannaim quoted as the bearers of one or more traditions in the Mishnah, he states, "We have not followed the chronological order in this list of names." C. M. Introd. ch. I. 93</page><page sequence="90">BARON Such occasion arose especially in connection with the year of fallowness which even today, Maimuni insists, ought to be fully observed in Palestine and, with respect to the Sabbatical cancellation of debts, also everywhere else. In order to establish the actual seventh year during which the law is to be enforced, he developes a computation of his own. The beginning of the shemittah series is to be dated back to the fifteenth year after Joshua's conquest of Palestine which corresponds to the year 2504 in the era of Creation.179 Every fiftieth year they celebrated a jubilee which thus followed closely upon every seventh sab- batical year. Each fifty-first year they started both a new jubilee and sabbatical cycle. There were altogether seventeen jubilee cycles from the entrance to Palestine to the Fall of Jerusalem. These 850 years were about evenly divided into 440 years from Joshua to the construction of the Temple and 410 years, the period of the Temple's duration. Discounting the first fourteen years of conquest and distribution, the fall of the first Temple occurred in the thirty-sixth year of the seven- teenth jubilee cycle.18? During the seventy years of the Babylonian Exile no sabbatical year was observed, whereas the actual observance of the jubilee was permanently discontinued after the fall of Samaria, since its observance was contingent upon the settlement of all the tribes of Israel in Palestine.'8' The second Temple lasted for 420 years, but it was not before the seventh year of its existence that Ezra arrived from the Exile. In that year the series of sabbatical and jubilee cycles was '79 There are two detailed chronological statements of Maimuni which are in many ways complementary, especially since they were written only one year apart (1175-6): Resp. No. 234 and M. T. Shemittah ve-Yobel 10, 2-8. Schwarz, MbM I, 369 ff. commenting on the latter failed to take sufficient account of the responsum. The figure in M.

T. ?8 on the basis of 'Ar. 32b. 94</page><page sequence="91">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES resumed, although the jubilee as such was never observed again. Hence the second fall of Jerusalem (counting the year of the Tishre following that eventful ninth of Ab) was the first year of the fourth sabbatical cycle of the ninth jubilee. Computing it on the basis of the Seleucid era it suffices to add thirty-four years to the Seleucid date and divide it by fifty to find the corresponding jubilee cycle. This computation is based upon the rabbinical chronology that the Seleucid era began in the forty-first year after the return from the Exile.I82 That is why, says Maimonides, the date 1486 Sel. era (1175 C. E.) should have been the sixth in the sabbatical and the twentieth in the jubilee cycle, but the geonim, especially Hai, have a different computation, buttressed by tradition. They contend that during the Second Commonwealth the jubilee year was not counted separately, since it was not observed. The eighth sabbatical cycle consequently began in the fiftieth and not in the fifty-first year. This would also account for their different dating with regard to the actual shemittah. In 1175, for instance, the Jews were to observe the year of fallowness according to the Maimon- idean computation, whereas according to both geonic theory and actual practice this was the first year of a subsequent sab- batical cycle. Maimonides, although theoretically adhering to his own chronology, bowed before the authority of the age-old tradition.'83 When asked many years later, about the date of the I82 Resp. ibid., based upon the well-known rabbinic chronology of 'Ab Zarah 9a: rw yn'nm o,t ' n ',n ,S i Dnvnlm=n and that the Seleucid era began with the first year of Alexander's conquest. Whether or not this was the original meaning of that passage (cf. A. Z. Lauterbach, Misunderstood Chrono- logical Statements in the Talmudical Literature Proceedings V, 77-84), Maimuni and all medieval rabbis so understood it. Cf. above n. 127.

Cf. also Schwarz . c. The geonic "tradition" dating back to 95</page><page sequence="92">BARON Sabbatical observance, he repudiated the opinion of one of his students who tried to follow his computation, and decided in accordance with the geonim.184 Chronologically even more remarkable is his famous enumera- tion of forty generations of teachers from Moses to R. Ashi, who had carried the burden of tradition from the days of the Sinaitic revelation of the Oral Law to the conclusion of the Babylonian Talmud. While basically an elaboration of the well-known chain of tradition in M. Abot I, it contains so many new links, independently and sometimes arbitrarily derived by Maimuni from scattered rabbinic sources, that it has ever since perplexed numerous interpreters. The difficulty begins with the very first generations. Moses taught the oral law, says Maimonides, to the elders and especially to Eleazar, Phinehas and Joshua, "all three of whom received it from Moses." Many elders received it from Joshua until Eli received it from the elders and Phinehas. Considering that in Maimuni's view at least three and a half centuries must have passed between Joshua's death and Eli's assumption of the high priestly office, one intervening link seems very disturbing. He evidently bridges over the gap by suggesting several generations the talmudic age is borne out also by recent excavations which show that, long after the fall of Jerusalem, the era of destruction was combined with that of Sabbatical cycles. On the other hand, the tombstone inscription of Kasr et-Tuba dated " on the first day of Marbeshvan of the first year of the shemittah in the year 364 since the destruction of the Temple" (cf. L. H. Vincent, Une colonie juive oubliee Revue biblique LXXXV, 1927, pp. 401-7 and Th. Reinach, Inscriptions de Touba REJ LXXXV, 1928, pp. 1-10) is inconclusive with respect to our main controversy as to whether the jubilee cycles continued to count in 50 or only in 49 year ranges. 364 happens to be either 7 x 50+14 or 7 x 49+21. In any case, it confirms the talmudic-Maimonidean statement that the destruction took place in the first year of the cycle or at least that the computation linn6 began in such a year. Cf. also, in general, H. J. Born- stein, -ntis' ,tinn in Hatekufah VIII (1920) pp. 281-338 and IX (1921) pp. 202-64 and E.

Maimuni does not hesitate to include the king in his list of "prophets," because he always regarded David as endowed with the gift of prophecy in a lower degree. Solomon, although also a prophet, did not continue this series, but the task fell to Ahijah the Shilonite whom Maimuni, parenthetically, calls one of Moses' direct students, who in his childhood had known the great lawgiver while still in Egypt.'86 Elijah, Ahijah's successor, is the eighth in the series. He is fol- lowed by Elisha, Jehoiada and (his son) Zechariah. Hosea, Amos 185 While C. M. Introd. is limited to the series of Abot: Joshua-elders- prophets-men of the Great Synagogue, M. T. Introd. enumerates nineteen names between Joshua and Ezra. Eleazar as Moses' student is mentioned 'Er. 54b. (Incidentally, C. M.'s preference for R. Judah's theory concerning Aaron's seat to the right rather than the left of Moses evidently comes from the later seating order in the Sanhedrin, where the vice-chairman is placedto the right of the president; cf. above n. 142). Both Eleazar and Phinehas are mentioned as authors of the final section of the book Joshua B. B. 15b, whence may be inferred that both survived the great conqueror. Among the other "elders" Maimuni undoubtedly counted Othniel, the son of Kenaz. Since he accepted the period of 369 years for the tabernacle at Shiloh, whose transfer there after fourteen years in Gilgal must have more or less coincided with the death of Joshua, and allowing for Eli's pontificate of forty years (cf. Seder 'Olam 13 and Zacuto, Yumasin, p. 7a), he had to accept Phinehas' longevity, although he nowhere refers to the well-known identification of Phinehas with Elijah, accepted, e. g., by Gersonides. Cf. GL VI, 138 n. 803; 214 n. 140; 220 n. 25; 316 n. 3 and Yutasin p. 9a. In fact, they appear as the third and the eighth member of the group respectively. Cf. next note. i86 For David's prophetic gifts cf. above n. 91. The assumption that Ahijah was among those redeemed from Egypt and that he had lived through the 40 years of the desert migration, the 400 years that elapsed between the settlement and the building of the Solomonian Temple and the remainder of Solomon's reign (36 years) until the anointment of Jeroboam I (cf. n. 105) seems to Maimuni no more impossible than Phinehas' long life. He uncritically takes over the statement of B. B. 121b (like Rashi s. v. ni,n, he may have seen therein a refusal to accept the equation of Phinehas and Elijah) and Seder 'Olam 1. He refrains from mentioning, however, Ahijah's birth 60 years before the Exodus and his martyr's death under Abijah. The purpose of this historical excursus which evoked the opposition of RABD (this seems to be the meaning of his note rather than the difference between David and David's court, as suggested by Karo ad. loc.) was perhaps to forestall the more orthodox objection that Ahijah might appear as a direct continuator of Moses. 97</page><page sequence="94">BARON Isaiah, and Micah hold the twelfth to the fifteenth places, fol- lowed by Joel, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah and, finally, Jeremiah. Through the latter's disciple, Baruch, the chain reaches Ezra, the twenty-second in the series.187 I87 For Elijah as Ahijah's successor see 'Er. I. c. His disciple was Elisha, which ruled out Obadiah, the prophet, whom the Aggadah identified with king Ahab's official bearing that name and made one of Elijah's prominent pupils. Besides, his allegedly Edomite descent, although far from preventing him from becoming a prophet of doom for Edom, certainly did not enhance his eligibility in the eyes of Maimuni. Cf. Sanh. 39b and other sources listed in GL VI, 344 f. n. 6-7. Elisha's successor was Jehoiada rather than Jonah, very likely in view of the glowing description of the former's restoration of the worship in Jerusalem in II Chr. 23.16 ff. Incidentally when M. T. Kle ha-Mikdash 5, 10 somewhat modifies the rigid prohibition for the high priest to marry two wives stated in M. T. Issure Biah 17, 13 by giving him the choice to divorce one wife before the Day of Atonement, Maimuni may have had compunctions over II Chr. 24.3, although he might have interpreted it, as did Josephus and the Vulgate, as referring to Joash or, like Vidal of Tolosa, as meaning two wives succeeding one another. Cf. RABD and Maggid Mishneh Issure Biah 1. c. and GL VI, 354 n. 11. Jonah was discarded because of his preachment to a foreign city only, the frequently unfavorable comments of the Aggadah and, perhaps, because after leaving the country he had no direct successor. Zechariah lent himself to serve as another link because of the characterization l"l K',:an1 n in j. Ta'anit IV, 5, 69a. The chronological difficulty that Jehoiada and his son were southern contemporaries of the Northern Israelite, Elisha, if it came at all to Maimuni's mind, would have troubled him little, since contemporaries may well serve as successive trans- mitters to later generations. Cf. e. g., Zacuto, Yulasin, p. 9a who following closely Maimuni's list, nevertheless, admits the possibility that Jehoiada died before Elisha and Zechariah only two years after him.-A similar succession of contemporaries, due to seniority, is the following group of Hosea, Amos, Isaiah and Micah. Cf. Seder 'Olam 20; Pes. 87a, etc. Hosea's precedence before Amos is based upon the arrangement of the redactor of the Minor Prophets and, perhaps, also upon Hos. 1.2 ynvi; 'n "n= n%nn, quoted to this effect in Yumasin p. 9b.-In the date of Joel, Nahum and Habakkuk Maimuni follows Seder'Olam 20, where they are all placed under the reign of Manasseh, as against other rabbinic chronologies. Cf. GL VI, 314 f. n. 98 and above n. 112. Their relative position is indicated by the redactor of Minor Prophets. Cf. also Yu4asin 1. c.-Zephaniah is the natural transition to Jeremiah and his disciple Baruch. The failure to mention Ezekiel is due not only to the precedence given to Baruch who was both a student of Jeremiah and a teacher of Ezra, as suggested by Bacher, MbM II, 147, but, possibly, also because of 98</page><page sequence="95">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES Ezra's court (the men of the Great Synagogue) included, as we have seen, the post-exilic prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi and Daniel, and in the brief span of one generation we reach Simon the Just. From now on Maimuni follows the list in Abot by counting: 24) Antigonus; 25) Jose b. Yoezer and Joseph b. Johanan; 26) Joshua b. Perahiah and Nittai of Arbela; 27) Judah b. Tabbai and Simon b. Shetah; 28) Shemaiah and Abtalion; 29) Hillel and Shammai.'88 Here Maimuni inserts 30) Simon, Hillel's son and Jobanan b. Zakkai and reverts in part to the list in Abot by enumerating 31) Gamaliel the Elder; 32) his son Simon; 33) his son Gamaliel [II]; 34) Simon b. Gamaliel [II]; 35) Judah the Patriarch.'89 The following genera- tion was divided between 36) R. Johanan, the Palestinian and certain dubious points in the exilic prophet's Halakah.

Cf. above n. 125 and 147. 189 This list of two Gamaliels and three Simons is stated in the main section of M. T. Introd. and C. M. Introd. ch. III, but is shortened in the subsequent summary of forty generations in M. T. and the general survey in C. M., both of which speak only of one Gamaliel and two Simons. Although partly supported by M. Abot I (where, however, the first Simon is missing), the latter reading is evidently a copyist's mistake, because it would furnish thirty-eight instead of forty generations. In C. M. ch. IV he fails to mention R. Gamaliel of Yabneh and his son, Simon, in the second and third generation after the fall of Jerusalem, but he must have realized that there was a gap between R. Simon b. Gamaliel of the first and R. Judah of the fourth genera- tion. The historical situation is too obvious, the sources too outspoken for Maimuni to have overlooked them completely. The listing of R. Joblanan b. Zakkai directly after Hillel is due to the well-known Aggadah that he was his youngest disciple. Cf. j. Ned. V, 6, 39b. But apparently Maimuni agreed that he did nor serve as nasi until after Gamaliel the Elder. Cf. Zacuto, Yu4zasin, p. 19b. Zacuto's attempt (p. 21a) to explain Maimonides' enumera- tion as substituting 30) R. Johanan; 31) R. Eliezer and R. Joshua; 32) R. Akiba for the three Hillelites is untenable. His objections, however, to Mai- muni's artificial classification, that the greatest Tannaim, such as Hillel, Shammai, Shemaia and Abtalion were cited without a prefix by the redactor of the Mishnah, the next greatest quoted with the title "Rabban," and all the others with that of "Rabbi" (C. M. Introd. ch. VII) are undoubtedly valid.

The round number, forty, which always fascinated the Oriental mind, is here divided into equal halves for the periods before and after the first fall of Jerusalem. Jeremiah, the twen- tieth, concludes the first; his disciple, Baruch, opens the second series. This corresponds to the approximately equal length of the two periods in Maimuni's view. The concentration of the first five centuries in the hands of six bearers, as against fourteen (many of them contemporaries) for the following four hundred years, is undoubtedly due to the author's wish to enumerate all the great pre-exilic prophets, with the exception of Obadiah l90 That Palestine's amoraic scholarship was discontinued after R. Jobanan is in accordance with Maimuni's conviction that R. Jobanan was the redactor of the Palestinian Talmud, although the date of three hundred years after the destruction is obviously an overstatement. It is even more clearly so, when one realizes that Maimuni assigns only one hundred years more for the compilation of the Babylonian Talmud under R. Ashi four generations later. Had Maimuni interpreted the statement in IKid. 72b to mean that R. Ashi was not born until after Raba's death, he would have had to insert another generation of R. Papa. But he evidently read with Alfasi: m 5 w 'y 'i 'n nn Kuni i1 which not only emphasizes the workings of Providence much better, but also corresponds more closely to the parallel of Eli and Samuel. Cf. Yuhasin, pp. 117b and 203b.-Maimuni realizes, however, that R. Ashi did not complete the redaction of the Babylonian Talmud. He qualifies his n,ann nimn 'wnv wn ' '1n by adding not only Rabina, but also R. Ashi's son to the list of transmitters, sums up nwi' =, n n Po 1D'w '11 M'm n: M= ns yWnv mrrln D'p'nynn and adds: un 'n inni nn Nmi nnnw n '-i 5 -V -inni. I9I It would transcend the bounds of the present paper to enumerate all these "contemporaries," although a fresh reexamination of Maimuni's selection and dating in the light of present day knowledge would undoubtedly clarify certain details in his historical approach. 100</page><page sequence="97">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES and Jonah, against whose inclusion special reasons could be advanced. The post-exilic prophets, on the other hand, had to give way to the men of the Great Synagogue, to whom they also belonged, because these were the official bearers of tradition, according to M. Abot I. This second period is about evenly divided into two periods of 445 years each, if Simon b. Hillel and his son, Gamaliel the Elder, are to be dated at approximately fifty years before the second fall of Jerusalem. A generation thus averages forty-five years which makes the contraction of the Babylonian Amoraim to five generations less strained.192 VIII. GENERAL VIEWS AND METHOD. Into this general chronological scheme of Jewish history Maimuni fits the entire history of mankind. He realizes, of course, that the Jews were in his day and probably also that they had always been a minority. In a remarkable passage of his Code he invokes Jer. 10.7-8 to proclaim the fundamental unity of mankind even in matters of belief. Speaking of the origin of idolatrous practices, he declares, "All the nations know that Thou art alone, and it is only their error and foolishness to believe that this vanity springs from Thy will."I93 On many occasions he professes admiration for cultures and languages other than Hebrew. In quoting, for example, Alfarabi's theory of the intellectual and physical superiority of the peoples inhabit- ing the middle climates, as against the Nordics and Southerners, 192 The entire period of forty generations covered some 1780 years. It included: 40 years of desert migration, 440 years from the settlement to the building of the Temple, 410 under the first Temple=890 years; 70 years of the Babylonian Exile, 420 of the Second Commonwealth and 400 between the destruction and R. Ashi =890 years. It is this sense of symmetry very likely which influenced his late dating of R. Ashi, as compared with Sherira's 738 Sel. era=359 after the destruction.-This average of 45 years is also borne out by the ten generations from Ezra to R. Eleazar b. Azariah over a period of approximately 450 years. 193 M. T. 'Abodat Kokabim 1, 1. A similar thought had been expressed by Gabirol, "Yet is not Thy glory diminished by reason of those that worship aught besides Thee, for the yearning of them all is to draw nigh Thee" (Keter Malkut in Selected Religious Poems, ed. by I. Davidson and transl. by I. Zang- will, p. 86). 101</page><page sequence="98">BARON he not only approves of these racial distinctions, which then seemed to be fully borne out by the previous history of the Mediterranean world, but also finds that the languages spoken by these nations are physiologically and logically more perfect. Among the five main languages of this group Arabic is almost identical with Hebrew, of which it is but a slight corruption, Aramean closely related to either, while Greek is related to Aramean. Only Persian is further apart. Maimuni also takes pains to defend the beauty of the Greek speech against the facile generalizations of those who listen to the distorted Greek spoken in Muslim countries far from Byzantium by pointing out the dialectical corruptions of Hebrews and Arabs settled in distant regions of the North and South (the Yemen?).I94 194 Pirke Mosheh in Kobes II, 22d f. and Epistle to Samuel ibn Tibbon ibid. p. 27c. For Maimuni's general theory of the conventional origin of languages cf. M. N. II, 30 and the comments as well as parallels in BB pp. 163 f. It appears likely that Maimuni's racial theory is based on the assumption of Al-Maqdasi (op. cit. III, 33) and others that the Persians as well as the Greeks were descendants of Shem, although the Jews generally associated the Greeks with the Japhethite group. For the Semitic origin of the Persians, cf. also Mas'udi, op. cit., I, 78.-It is interesting that in that discussion of human cultures both China and India completely escape Maimuni's vision. He does not seem to know anything about China, although among his Arabian predeces- sors and contemporaries some travellers' reports concerning the great eastern civilization were fairly current. Even Benjamin of Tudela has a faint notion of it. India is frequently referred to in Maimonides' writings (cf. n. 175), but he fails to draw it into the orbit of the general history of civilization, probably because its influence upon Arabian thought was rather indirect. Shahrastani (op. cit., I, 3), on the other hand, counts the Indians, along with the Arabs, Persians and Greeks among the four leading nations of history.-- It is also noteworthy that on all occasions he paraphrases "the seventy lan- guages" of the Talmud by "most languages," thus revealing the enormous impact of Arabic in his day. C. M. to Sotah VII and M. T. Sanh. 2, 6. For practical purposes, he decides in Resp. No. 102, it is sufficient when a judge understands the language of the parties concerned, without having a speaking knowledge of it. Notwithstanding his admiration for Hebrew Maimuni insists, against the opinion of his "teachers" (probably Ibn Migash), that an oath administered in the courts may be sworn in any language known to the party or witness and that, although the general practice is to recite the oath in Hebrew, the person concerned should at least be made to understand the content of the oath in his own language. M. T. Shebuot 11, 14. Cf. also Schwarz, MbM I, 363 f. 102</page><page sequence="99">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES Nevertheless, world history is for him primarily the history of the Jewish people, with the other nations furnishing, so to say, the general background. This will appear less astonishing, when one realizes that Christian historiography from Eusebius and Augustine to the days of the Renaissance treated ancient history before Jesus as an adjunct to the "sacred" history of the Hebrews, and that even Muslim historiography could not fully escape the impact of the Bible's particularist historical outlook. Of course, for Maimuni, the Jew, not even the appear- ance of Jesus or Muhammed caused any break in the historical continuity of the perennial dialogue between the Jews and the "nations of the world." For him the great periods of history run: 1) from Adam to Abraham and the establishment of mon- otheism; 2) from Abraham to Moses and the "giving of the Torah"; 3) from Moses to the building of the Solomonian Temple; 4) the duration of that Temple; 5) The Exile and Second Com- monwealth; 6) the full-fledged Galut. The latter two periods are not sharply distinguished, because only a minority of Jews returned to Palestine under Ezra and because of the continuity of the talmudic tradition from Ezra to R. Ashi. The greatest event of all these was the "giving of the Torah," and the period preceding it represents a kind of human pre-history. On the other hand, Maimuni fails to draw any conclusions (except, as we shall see, indirectly through Balaam) from the coincidence that, according to his chronological views, the pre- and post- Sinaitic periods to his own day were of about equal length (of less than 2500 years each.)I95 In this historical dialogue between Israel and the nations, which will not be concluded until the arrival of the Messiah, there arises the great problem of, one may call it, the national theodicy: the sufferings of the Jews and the relative prosperity of the other nations. The general course of Jewish history appears to Maimonides as to all medieval writers as an uninterrupted series of persecutions. When Israel received the Torah, he says, not through its own merit, but by divine grace and in recognition of the good deeds of its forefathers, all the nations became very 19s Cf. above n. 180-82. 103</page><page sequence="100">BARON envious and sought a quarrel with it and its God. "In every period from the time of the Sinaitic Revelation to the present there arose tyrannical and despotic Gentile Kings, such as Amalek, Sisera, Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar, Titus, Hadrian and many others whose first intention and purpose was to destroy our Law and suppress our religion at sword's point." The answer to this national theodicy is not only like that to the individual theodicy, namely that Israel will eventually reap the reward both in the hereafter and in the messianiac age, but also in its indestructibility in this world. In reference to Is. 66.22 Maimuni emphasizes that-in contrast to such great nations as the Greeks and Persians, whose descendants, though physically undoubtedly still in existence, have lost their national identity-,Israel's seed and name have both survived. In fulfillment of God's blessing to Jacob, Israel has always been like "the dust of the earth," treaded upon by everybody, but like the dust it has also out- lasted them all. That is why, in admitting a proselyte to the Jewish fold, one ought to teach him, "Know ye, that the world to come is preserved only for the pious ones, i.e., Israel. If thou seest Israel's suffering in this world, it is for the sake of the future good, for they cannot receive much well-being in this world as do the other nations, because they may become haughty, err and lose the reward of the hereafter . .. However the Holy blessed be He does not bring upon them too severe punishment, lest they completely disappear. But the other nations vanish, while they last forever."'96 Notwithstanding the 196 I. T. pp. 22 ff. (KobeS II, ld and 2d), M. N. II, 29 and M. T. Issure Biah 14, 4-5.-Of course, Jewish sufferings have been intensified through the dispersion. I.

Israel is nevertheless bound to praise God 104</page><page sequence="101">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES endless persecutions, foreseen already by king David, moreover, the Jewish people remains a "Kingdom of priests," leader and pace-setter for all nations. It is, in fact, so beloved by God that even warranted criticism thereof may bring upon the critic dire punishment. Maimonides invokes Moses, Elijah, Isaiah and the angel who addressed Joshua, son of Jehozadak, as examples of preachers who, however justified were their reprimands of the idolatrous practices of the entire people or the marital trans- gressions of the priesthood, nevertheless provoked God's anger by the harshness of their condemnation.'97 In this his apologia for the destiny of his people Maimuni merely carried on a tradition well laid down in the talmudic age and reinforced in the constant Judeo-Muslim polemics, where the inferiority of contemporary Jewry in political power was frequently stressed. This argument, so plausible under Islam's political orientation and fully in consonance with a deep-rooted conviction, carried over from the ancient Orient, that a victorious country is in itself a proof for the superiority of its god, had to be disproved by reference to another type of "success" in Israel's historic career. Another argument which had to be met by Jewish apologists was the evident superiority, in quantity even more than in quality, of the Muslim scientific and literary achievements. Samau'al ibn Yahia, for one exam- ple, attaches great significance to this line of reasoning. Maimo- nides replies with the increasingly standardized argument that the most distinguished writings of ancient Jewry, the fountain- head of ancient Greek and, consequently, also of Arabian wisdom, had been lost in the process of exile and migration. Especially the highly developed philosophic studies, which had been restricted for his manifold benefactions, especially in the various benedictions, such as were recited during the first offerings or still are being read when one sees a place where miracles were once performed for Jews. Cf. e. g., S. H. Com- mandment 132 and M. T. Berakot 10, 9. '97 I. T. p. 22 (Kobes II, 2c) referring to Ps. 129.1-2; Maimuni's inter- pretation of Ex. 19.6, as quoted by his son Abraham, in Eppenstein MbM I, 117 f. and I. S. p. 7b. Cf. n. 49 and 111. According to Bahya b. Asher, Maimuni stressed, with reference to Deut. 7.7, that God in choosing Israel disregarded its small number, whereas an earthly king normally prefers a large retinue. Cf. Eppenstein, pp. 119 f. 105</page><page sequence="102">BARON to an intellectual minority in ancient Israel and carried on in oral tradition for generations, suffered great decline under the rule of ignorant nations.'98 All that will be remedied, however, in the future messianic age. The past as well as the future history of the Jews within the framework of human history is well prefigured in Daniel's vision concerning the image and the beasts. The four beasts as well as the four words "return" are allusions to the four empires of Greece, Rome, Persia and Islam which were to exercise domination over the Jews before the advent of the Messiah. The comparatively long duration of the fourth empire indicates that the day of redemption is speedily approaching. This interpretation of Daniel's vision, Maimonides reiterates, cannot be controverted. While he refuses to derive therefrom an actual date and frowns upon all those who had tried "to hasten the end," he cannot refrain from referring to the above mentioned old family tradition.'99 I98 M. N. I, 71 beg., repeating a contention widespread among Maimuni's Jewish and non-Jewish predecessors and contemporaries. Cf. Munk I, 332 n. 3.-For Ibn Yahya cf. n. 5. That many Jews were so impressed by the power of Islam and the political impotence of Jewry as to abandon their ancestral creed is intimated by Maimuni himself I. T. p. 16 (Kobes II, Ic). '99 I. T., especially pp. 21 and 44 ff. (Kobes II, ld f. and 6b), supporting the messianic implications of Dan. 7.17 ff. by many other Scriptural passages. The interpretation of Daniel's vision, which naturally varied with the ages, was under Islam usually given in an historic succession of empires with Islam as the fourth or last, to be superseded by the advent of the Messiah. The Muslim view, on the other hand, is best expressed in the following passage of Tabari (Book of Religion and Empire, p. 136): "The fourth beast... is the image of this Arab kingdom, about which God said that it shall be the greatest and the highest of all kingdoms, and that it shall dominate all the earth, tread it down under its feet and devour it completely. It is also the latest kingdom; and this testifies to the fact that the Prophet.... is the last prophet; that all prophecies were realized through him, ended with him and did not go beyond him. To this all the preceding prophecies pointed and referred." Maimuni appears, however, to combine the idea of succession with that of simultaneity, inasmuch as he sees in the Arabian expansion the victory of the fourth Empire over the preceding three of Greece (Byzantium), Rome-Edom (western Europe) and Sassanian Persia. For various older interpretations cf. e.g., the sources listed in GL VI, 63 n. 323. The basis of the family tradition evidently was Balaam's date and the statement in j. Shab. VI, 9, 8d xn3z 'nly yvwn inlH ;in iyly vw 1,'o. Cf. n. 71.

Indeed, shortly before the actual advent of the Redeemer, the Sanhedrin will be reestablished. The Messiah will not abrogate any of the existing laws, but on the contrary renew the entire biblical and tannaitic legislation and reinforce all those laws which had been discarded after the destruction of the Temple. In many details the final lawgiver will even surpass his predecessors as, for example, in the case of the cities of refuge. Only six such cities were founded by Moses and Joshua, whereas the messianic king will set apart nine. Apparently Maimuni did not believe even in a miraculous elimination of accidental manslaughter in the messianic age! Perhaps the greatest achievement of that age may be seen in the possibilities it will offer Israel to devote itself wholeheartedly and without outside interference to the study and practice of Jewish law.200 "computers of the end." Christians and Muslims had to use the suspicious method of gematria to find in 1335 the equivalent of either Jesus or Muhammed. E. g., for Tabari, pp. 137 ff. it is equal to the numerical value of the Arabic letters of "Muhammed, the last prophet, the Mahdi, the illustrious." 200 Here is not the place to discuss the full implications of Maimuni's mes- sianic doctrine, as laid down, especially, in C. M. to Sanh X Introd. and Principle 12; M. T. Melakim 11-12 and I. T. passim. It suffices for us to realize that the messianic hope was the true culmination of Maimuni's histor- ical outlook. It was a humanitarian, pacifist and intellectual hope, best characterized in the concluding sentences of his code, "The sages and prophets did not yearn for the days of the Messiah, in order to rule the world, tyrannize the heathens and receive homage from the nations, nor in order to eat and drink and enjoy life, but that they be free to devote themselves to the study of the Torah and its wisdom, without oppression and interference, and that they gain the world to come.... At that time, there will be neither hunger, nor war, nor envy and rivalry, because there will be an abundance of every- thing, and everybody's concern will only be to know God, so that the Jews will be great sages, who will understand the hidden things and achieve the knowledge of their Creator to the limit of human capacity." Cf. also M. T. Teshubah 9, 3 and, for the reerection of the Sanhedrin, C. M. to Sanh. I, 3 and M. T. Sanh. 4, 11. Maimuni's theory that an agreement of all Palestinian rabbis to ordain a group of scholars would reinstall the chain of ordination led to the well-known controversy between Jacob Berab and Levi ibn Iabib in the sixteenth century. 107</page><page sequence="104">BARON This optimistic view of the ultimate future should not be mistaken for a belief in the idea of progress, even in its moderate, medieval form, such as found expression in the writings of Hugo of St. Victor, Thomas Aquinas and, especially, Roger Bacon. There were enough elements of scientific and cultural progress in Maimuni's Muslim environment to stimulate the belief in the constant forward procession of humanity. But there were at that time also sufficiently serious signs of political and social decay to tone down exuberant hopes and to produce, within two centuries, an historic thinker of Ibn Khaldun's calibre possess- ing the full realization of the ups and downs in human history. For Maimonides, the Jew, the contemporary situation of his people must have appeared the less encouraging, the more it was contrasted with the splendor of ancient Israel-which appeared to him in an exaggerated light-and the glory of the messianic future, to be brought about by a sudden, miraculous redemption. In the distant past, there was Moses, the greatest of all past and future men-including even the Messiah-indeed, a man of his own kind, a true superman. Neither were the other Israelitic prophets ever since rivalled in divine inspiration. Out of these conflicting impulses grew Maimuni's somewhat hazy conception that "there has never been a time in which speculation and the discovery of new matters were amiss; the sages of every generation placed great stock in the words of their predecessors and learned from them, and then discovered new things. Only in the basic principles of tradition opinions were never divided." Although speaking in connection with the early transmission of Oral Law, he undoubtedly had also the subsequent ages in mind. After all such a combination of unreserved adherence to the basic elements of Jewish tradition and of independent original variation in many details was the main characteristic of his own work. This combination-fairly typical of the medieval mind- made it possible for him, when he undertook the writing of his most daring work, to assert almost in one breath, "I adjure any reader of this book by God the Most High not to comment on a single word nor to explain to another any portion of it except such passages as are found clearly explained in the words of my predecessors among the illus- 108</page><page sequence="105">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES trious teachers of our Law," and, "God the Most High knows that I have always been very much afraid to deal with the subjects which I propose to treat in this work, because they are profound mysteries which have not been treated in any extant work during the period of this captivity.20I From the traditional outlook on history as well as from Maimuni's own systematic-ethical bent of mind springs also his frequent reference to the history of Israel as a moral lesson for the intelligent observer. It was not without purpose, he asserts, that the Bible devoted so many chapters to the discussion of historical events and episodes. The genealogies recorded in Genesis, for example, have the advantage of eradicating doubts concerning the distribution of the peoples and the division of languages in the pre-Mosaic age. The stories of the deluge and Sodom point to the obvious moral that God is a judge. The struggle of the nine kings in Gen. 14 demonstrates the victory of a minority without a king, if assisted by God, and also serves as an example of family love (Abraham's for Lot) and of depre- cation of money.202 In his critical attitude Maimonides reminds us distinctly of the limitations of scholastic philosophy. He realizes that facts cannot be derived through sheer reason. In fact, he bitterly reproaches those Christianized Syrians and Muslims who first develop a theory and then try to force reality to agree with it. Neither does he fully accept the testimony of majority opinion. Although in his legal writings he frequently invokes the adop- tion of a certain law by all Israel as an argument in favor of its validity and insists that a court which had issued an enactment, subsequently disregarded by the people, may not try to enforce its acceptance, he limits this principle-which incidentally reveals many analogies to the Islamic ijma-to the application of legal precepts. In questions of scientific fact the truth does not cease to be truth even if all men should happen unanimously to dis- agree with it. This argument was the more important for 201 C. M. Introd. and M. N. Introd. 202 M. N. III, 50 and C. M. to Sanh. X Principle 8. Cf. also above n. 35 and 110. 109</page><page sequence="106">BARON Maimonides, the more both Islam and Christendom invoked the acceptance by large majorities as a conclusive proof for the truth of their respective religions.203 However, the truth of an historical fact is for him, as for every true scholastic, based chiefly upon reasoning rather than documentary evidence. While in problems of natural science he always gives a certain consid- eration to empirical evidence as against logical derivation and to either against opinions voiced by the Aggadah, in point of history he leans heavily upon the authority of the legendary sources. His respect for tradition goes so far that he does not even attempt to disprove the contentions of Christian and Muslim opponents, inasmuch as they are based upon their own traditions. He merely argues against what, he thinks, are false conclusions derived from these traditional premises. For example, he does not deny the historical fact of Jesus' crucifixion by Jews, but is satisfied with the contention that the Jews simply exercised their legal right to punish an instigator to heresy.204 203 M. N. I, 71 in his polemic with the early Mutakallimun, Syriac as well as Arabic.-II, 15 argument against majority opinion is paralleled by similar utterances of Halevi, Albo, etc., as pointed out by Schreiner MGWJ XLII, 132 n. 1. The likely influence of the Muslim ijma upon the reiterated Maimo- nidean emphasis upon winr' i: ouy lD'Dun Aw,5 t' im 1PID M. T. Introd., etc. has been pointed out by L. Blau MbM II, 351 ff. It must be realized, however, that this method of reconciling a general binding law with divergent local customs and social needs became such an urgent necessity in both the vast caliphate and the still vaster Jewish dispersion that it undoubtedly would have been invented in full independence of one another. 204 In his epistle to Ibn Aknin 1190 Maimuni defines the task of the consci- encious man as one "who does not want to state anything which he cannot support by argument and without knowing where it has been said and how it can be demonstrated." (Munk, Notice, p. 31). For his basic acceptance of Christian and Muslim traditions cf., in particular, his polemic against both in I. T. His rejection of the authority of the Aggadah, when it contradicts his logical or theological convictions is well illustrated by his defense of his own doctrine of free will and retribution, "He who sets aside my statements built upon authoritative foundations and searches in some Aggadah, Midrash or utterance of one of the geonim until he finds there a passage to impugn our words, which are words of knowledge and wisdom, is but committing intellectual suicide" Resp. No. 345. His historical outlook, however, is wholly determined by the aggadic elaborations of past events. Here, too, he rejects all legends which appear rationally impossible, but not those which lack confirmation in 110</page><page sequence="107">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES Among the other methodical problems stands out his rejection of the astrological method. Generally an opponent of astrology as a science, he objects to the utilization of horoscopes for the explanation of past events, such as applied by many Muslims and Abraham bar Hiyya. Even when he tries to prove that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and David lived during the so-called earthly Trigon, he does it for the purpose of disproving the general misconception that such trigons exercise influence on historical events. He is, of course, particularly wrought up over those non-Jewish astrologers who denied, on astrological grounds, the future restoration of Israel.205 IX. SUMMARY. Viewing the Maimonidean outlook on history as a whole, one easily perceives that his major interests center around the Old Testament history from Moses to Ezra, and the Talmudic his- tory from Hillel to R. Ashi. The pre-Mosaic age, to which he concedes one-half of human history in point of time, is for him little more than the world's pre-history, of real interest only with respect to the origin of the pagan religions and the restora- tion of monotheism by Abraham. The centuries from Ezra to the original sources. Only occasionally he shelves the responsibility by a cau- tious remark, such as :31 by 1',y ir-I that he had never been seen going four ells without Torah, show-fringes and philacteries. M. T. Tefillin u-Mezuzah 4, 25 on the basis of Meg. 28a where, however, our texts read R. Ze'era. As to the minutiae of textual criticism one need refer merely to his ceaseless efforts to secure reliable manuscripts, his numerous textual emendations and his objections to hasty conclusions from a passage without considering its context (cf. I. T. p. 32; Kobes II, 4b) to see how "modern" in many ways was his scientific approach. So is the remark in his narrative at the end of I. T. concerning his "verification" of a messianic incident which had occurred not long before. 205 I. T. pp. 39 f. (Kobes II, 5b f.), where the futility of astrological predic- tions is demonstrated by the example of the Egyptian and Chaldean astrologers in the days of Moses and the Exile who foretold the perpetual prosperity of their nations and the eternal subjection of Israel. Similarly God will disprove this contention today that the Jewish people will never be redeemed by speedily sending the Messiah. 11</page><page sequence="108">BARON Hillel not only shrink in duration, because pre-Maccabean Juda- ism had failed to preserve lasting records of the Persian and early Hellenistic periods, but seem to Maimuni practically meaning- less, as far as Palestinian Jewry is concerned, and almost non- existent in regard to the Persian-Parthian-Hellenistic dispersion. The half millenium from R. Ashi to Sherira Gaon appears to him of significance only through the rise of the "fourth" empire (Islam), the intensification of anti-Jewish persecutions and a few geonic modifications of talmudic law. Only his own period (from about 1000 C. E.) arouses more frequently his curiosity, but this is hardly historical curiosity even in the limited sense revealed by his interest in biblical and talmudic developments. This limitation is easily understandable in view of his main preoccupation with Scripture and Talmud, these two basic sources of Judaism. They blend in his mind into one undis- tinguishable whole, and he views, as a matter of course, biblical history through the spectacles of rabbinic legend. To be sure, his mind revolts against rationally incongruous and logically untenable aggadic amplifications of scriptural narratives. Not- withstanding his frequently accentuated belief in "miracles," he often removes the edge of supernaturalism from otherwise accepted aggadic records. But the fundamental historicity of the events, so recorded, appears to him indubitable. This is not merely an "uncritical" historical approach-shared with minor variations by all his Jewish and non-Jewish contemporaries-but it is based upon a premise, legitimate in itself, that the Aggadah has retained many traditions of historical events and develop- ments which undoubtedly took place, but which for some reason happened not to be recorded in any older source, or rather in any of those which had been earlier divulged to the public. Once this premise is accepted, one may only admire Maimuni's discretion and his, one may style it, historical instinct in selecting as a rule only such traditions which could not be controverted on chrono- logical or other objective grounds. From this belief in the general reliability of the ancient his- torical records springs also the harmonistic method of Maimuni's approach. In fact, some of his most "original" historical contri- butions consist in attempts to systematize and reconcile the widely 112</page><page sequence="109">HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF MAIMONIDES scattered and frequently contradictory records. He sometimes takes recourse to a new historical hypothesis to elucidate obscure or controversial points, and, especially, in order to satisfy his own desire for an orderly, well-balanced succession of historical events. A most famous instance may be found in his theory of the transmission of tradition through forty generations, in two or four periods of almost equal duration. In this and other such instances one may perceive the meaningful guidance of human and Jewish destinies by the Creator of all. Maimuni's historical outlook thus fits well into his general geo-, anthropo-, Judeocentric outlook on life. With all its evident shortcomings it is a well-rounded entity, fairly consistent in itself and truly representative of the outlook of the medieval Jew. Although in many details dependent on the Muslim environ- ment and the social needs of the struggling Jewish minority, it has so well preserved the general continuity of rabbinic historical thought that, buttressed by Maimonides' growing authority in law and philosophy, it has exercised considerable influence even on the European thinkers, Kimhi, Gersonides, Meiri, Zacuto, and a host of others.206 206 Cf. above n. 50, 84, 88, 91, 103, 112, and 187 ff. The influence of Mai- muni's historical views on the subsequent writers deserves special monographic treatment. 113</page></plain_text>
