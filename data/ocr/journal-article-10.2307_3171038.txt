Juan Gris, Verre etjournal (Glass and Journal), 1917 You know these joys: to feel the generous tummy of a vase, to stroke its delicate neck, to explore the subtleties of its lines ... letting oneself be gently seduced by the fascinating enamels, by the splendor of the yellows, and by the velvetlike blues; to witness the lively struggle of the brutal black masses and victorious white elements. Le Corbusier, letter to Perrin, 11 June 1911 The painting PHYSICALLY is a masterly massage appliance. Ozenfant and Jeanneret, Apr6s le cubisme, 1918 Verre et journal, a little-known Juan Gris still life of 1917, now in the storage racks of the Kunstmuseum in Basel, offers the opportunity to open yet another discourse be- tween Cubist and Purist aesthetics. The latter first took issue with the former in a manifesto entitled Apres le cub- isme, coauthored by Amdde Ozenfant and Le Corbusier (then still Charles-Edouard Jeanneret) in 1918. In this doc- ument, general praise of Cubist geometries is dimmed by sharp criticism: the Cubist distortion of objects, wrote the authors, had the effect of diminishing the "credibility" of still-life painting; presumably taking to task Picasso, Braque, and perhaps Gris, they cited the "fallacies" of tri- angular pipes and square guitars. The two collaborators proposed to rescue such objets-types from pictorial misrep- resentation by accentuating their inherent architectonic qualities, depicting them through the more "honest" and universal definitions of plan, section, and elevation. Within ths idealized image, a happy mariage des contours was to take place, the interaction of concavities, convexi- ties, and orthogonalities engendering a dynamic unfolding 95</page><page sequence="2">L - - - ?a ...L~~~ui~. -PLLrlRi|C ~ ~ Tti;~ - , " . i, . : . . ) . ... ,i ... . .. 4 -   ,i,~ ~ ~ ~ I r -!.. i  .

To guarantee the preservation of ob- ject identities, Ozenfant and Jeanneret prescribed a palette derived from academic painting. What this systematic vision of the external world entailed was a rather Protestant notion of aesthetics. The mass-pro- duced object of daily use was to be elevated to the highest order of representational importance: mundane utensils were to occupy a place formerly reserved, in still-life paint- ings of the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries, for the nobler elements of nature, and earlier, before the inven- tion of the still-life genre, for gods and persons of highest standing. Whereas the Cubists had sought to invigorate in- ert bottles and guitars with the presences of daily life - fruits, bread, newspapers, household patterns and textures - the Purists undertook to ban such pictorial stuff from the canvas, celebrating instead the refinement and ele- gance of containers of machined shape. Yet if one looks closely at Le Corbusier's own paintings of this period, one sees how transparency and contour acquire a figural presence not really consonant with the Purist pro- gram. It does not require much imagination to suggest that Apres le cubisme is more the polemic of Ozenfant than Jeanneret. A comparison between the still lifes of both painters reveals that whereas the former hones his canvases closely to the prescribed rules of composition and palette, the latter tends immediately toward the subjective and ar- cane, suggesting, even if in ever so muted a way, the an- thropomorphic characteristics latent in the products of a rational technology. Thus pitchers, glasses, bottles, carafes, siphons, pots, dishes, dice, boxes, lanterns, architectural moldings, books, violins, and guitars become actors on the stage of a still-life theater (notwithstanding the curious in- clusion of musical instruments in the repertory of mass production). Reclining guitars become surrogate odalisques; bottles and jugs double as orators and statesmen. The "noun" definitions proclaimed in the manifesto give way, in effect, to a syntax nuanced by "adverbial" modifications and "adjectival" qualifiers. These early Purist efforts of Le Corbusier, often perfuncto- rily included in the pantheon of modernist art and only recently reexamined within the canon of the architect's work, frequently amount to energetic and complex formal and chromatic cadenzas. They not only expose a painterly originality, but also recall, in strong metaphors, the history and culture of Western painting. But before looking at a few of these works, we must return to the small but monu- mental Gris still life in the Basel museum's repertory. In doing so, we should recall Le Corbusier's praise of Gris: "the strongest of the Cubists." In the Gris painting we have a seemingly typical Synthetic Cubist still-life arrangement that upon first glance suggests a traditional foreground-middleground-background schema. The orange-browns are appropriately deployed to configu- rate a table leg in the lower left corner, a tableau in the center supports an unclear cluster of objects, while a piece of wall paneling in the upper right corner completes the flattened but essentially Renaissance recessional reading of objects in space. The style of rendering is peculiarly Cub- ist, but it is imbued with a disturbing quality of predeter- mined diagonal symmetries. A pair of opposing and reversed dark shapes in the upper left and lower right cor- ners folds the rest of the composition back into the paint- ing's center, illuminating other sets of complementary shape oppositions that also draw attention to the first and last two letters of the newspaper banner, LE JOURNAL. This syntax of mirror symmetries triggers a revelatory new reading: gender, hinted at by the concavity and convexity of various object-shapes, now surfaces linguistically. Thus in the black-on-white LE diagonally concluded by the gray-on-black AL, a seemingly innocent play of meto- nymic fragments opens up the possibility of assigning gen- der to the painting's pictorialized nouns. LE remains a masculine article (French), but now stimulates the reversal of AL to LA, the feminine article (French). This sudden dialogue of gender reverberates back to LE, causing its re- versal to read EL, masculine (Spanish). And so a sublimi- nal game of gender interchange, one that Gris will employ much more consciously in his later paintings (for example, Le Canigou, where an overt play of Freudian readings overlays a "conventional" still-life composition), becomes an added, witty investment into presumably "dumb" objets. At the same time the reversal of French to Spanish sug- gests the painter's own relation to Paris, a rather significant layer of autobiographical reference. 96</page><page sequence="4">Slutzky 2. Le Corbusier, Nature morte a la cruche blanche sur fond bleu (Still Life with a White Pitcher on a Blue Field), 1920 I have undertaken this somewhat extended reading of a lit- erary-visual pun in the Gris painting to dramatize the po- tency of Cubist abstraction to generate new meaning. In the canvases of painters like Picasso and Gris, all manner of anthropomorphic and sexual references disguise them- selves within a highly organized pattern of innocent geo- metries. The Euclidean object definitions, nouns of traditional representationalism, are transmogrified by their displacements and reconstructions into poetically allusive roles. Tellingly, a mass-produced object like the daily newspaper, a favored point of departure for the Cubist lit- erary-transformational game, is excluded from the Purist vocabulary. One can only speculate why this and other ty- pographical material are so thorougly banished: perhaps words and letters in themselves were seen as too culturally determined to be "primary" enough for the universal com- prehension to which Ozenfant and Le Corbusier polemi- cally aspired. In Cubism, metaphor functions as the subversive and emancipatory instrument of a pictorial system in which precise geometries work to fragment objects into alchemi- cal othernesses. The oscillation between surface and depth definitions, between two-dimensional infrastructures and il- lusionistic representation, provides a friction of contradic- tion that radically extends the duration of aesthetic time. It is no accident that Cubism attracted the attention of the poets. It no doubt attracted a side of Le Corbusier as well, despite his and Ozenfant's categorical demotion of Cubist idiosyncrasies. If it was the academically trained young ar- chitect from a Swiss watchmaking town who would natu- rally have gravitated toward the technical rationalism and pictorial precisions of the Purist program, then it was the traveler to the East, exposed to the exoticisms and sensory seductions of an altogether other culture, then immersed in the intoxicating expansiveness of a Parisian milieu with its attendant cast of luminaries, who would have been sus- ceptible to the pull of a much more liberating aesthetic. Three Purist-period paintings by Le Corbusier in the La Roche collection in Basel prompt an elaboration of this hypothesis. In Nature morte a la cruche blanche sur fond bleu (1920), we are struck by the refinement of interpene- trating and overlapping forms that, in sharing either con- 97</page><page sequence="5">assemblage 4 tiguous contours or common color values, disintegrate the literal spatial emplacements of the objects being repre- sented. Thus, for example, the circularity of the mouth of the goblet in the lower left foreground seems to be inex- tricably bound to the hemicircular motif of the red-topped architectural molding (open book?), which, in its shared relation to a darker red, flat-axonometric upper half of a guitar lying behind, completes a triadic relationship of ex- panding hemicircles. The same goblet's transparent adhe- sion to the dark bottle behind it to the left, and its sharing of the gray value in its right-hand portion with a second bottle above it to the right, dematerializes the prominent stage position of this frontal actor so that it gets subsumed by its taller "parents." What emerges is a metaphor of fam- ily - embodied by the goblet and both tall glass contain- ers, the one to the right most anthropomorphic of all by virtue of the strange convexity of its neck/head, the three- some proudly posing in what finally reads as an architected interior space composed by a rescaled vision of ordinary subjects. Meanwhile the pitcher on the right is attempting to escape its compressed imprisonment. It is checked, however, by the thin surrounding field at its right, by its alliterating bottom curvature completing the half-guitar above, by its adhesion to the suggested half-guitar to its left, and by its circular handle, which triangulates with the round mouth of the goblet at lower left. At the same time, the pitcher's spout nudging the painting's right-hand edge is almost symmetrically countered by a wedge-shaped fascia on the left, a form seeming to belong to the tuning-neck of the guitar and located a hair's breadth from puncturing the left-hand edge of the canvas. These two projective ele- ments, the pitcher's spout and the trapezoidal wedge, cre- ate a state of extreme middleground tension by their counterpoint with the compressive vertical elements. The title conveys further ambiguities. The blue field is almost totally obscured by the coulisse arrangement of objects in front of it, while the white pitcher is nearly mirrored diagonally by a shaped lantern(?) face, which through its echoing scale and color value effects a contra- diction between a background element and one in a more prominent fore- or middleground position. The coloration of the whole speaks mysteriously of complementarity - not a typically Purist device - with a predominant red- green-gray interplay inflected by bleached yellows and shaded blues. One also notes the way the offset "navel" of the canvas is stated by a shift of the mouth of the fluted drinking glass diagonally upward to the left of the paint- ing's actual center. This latter pictorial device is also seen in Composition ac la lanterne et a la guitare (1920), where the circular opening of the fluted bottle is shifted to the upper right, and in the later Verres, pipes et bouteilles sur fond clair (1922), where the eye-level rim of the central goblet splits the painting into equal top and bottom halves. This perfectly centered horizontal anticipates Le Corbusier's predilection to estab- lish a reflective center line or oculus in his architectural and urban elevations, for example the middle-rise housing blocks of the Ville Contemporaine.1 In the Composition a la lanterne et d la guitare, a palette reminiscent of Gris - red-browns, orange-browns, pale ocher-grays, and blue- grays - organizes a decidedly asymmetrical composition in which a sparse area of light color and chunky elements on the left counterpoints a dense, dark-brown field on the right characterized by compressed verticals. This counter- point between left and right enframes the two nearly sym- metrically aligned main figures, which shift rightward and constitute an intermediary section of light-on-dark and dark-on-light articulations, thus weaving the left-hand side of the canvas through the right side. What is striking about the two central actors is the interchange of figural mean- ings: the guitar is cropped at the top so as to leave out its tuning board and thus reads as a fat, flat flask; the bottle in turn pirates the guitar's sounding hole, fretboard, and string parts, becoming less a container of liquid and more one of sound. Thus liquidities and acoustics reverse their respective vessels, completing a surrealistic exchange of subject and object. The highly articulated fluting on the front bottle also suggests the hand of the sculptor/musician/ painter/architect - multiple roles that Le Corbusier would aspire to embody. Nor is such a painting all that far from the metaphysical atmosphere of a De Chirico. And in light of Le Corbu- sier's own affirmation of the role of his painting in the 98</page><page sequence="6">Slutzky iiiii-ii ii _-iiiiiii iiisi,::-iii ::-;--ii-ii-i-:i ;iiiiii~i-:;ii ii:sl ii~~i-i ;-~:ii~i~-i;::l~-:;i-~: i-: iiMiiiiiiiWiiiiiil, !iiiii;i~i-i ili-il!iiiiiiirliiii?--a!iiiiii!ii!ii- ppgkiiaiiii:- i? . .... . .... . ...... ...... ~iiii iii~iiii--:l-:~ii:i-ii :~i~:-:- p ~ :_-i-iii~-::- ::-:-:::::-g:::'::::-:-: ..... .....~;ai~?:i-~;e ??~~?i-?l:li:i:-i:i~i:i-i-ii-i~iiiii-i:-i-:iii _ Zk iiiiiii~iii-ii_ ii-ii: -~-i--ia-'i-iii::iiii~~l:i .......................................: _:__:::_:i:_iii __ ~ji/: __: _ : :_: _: l: i :::::::-::::::: : :: :::_: :: : .:- ::___::_:: _Ij::;:~l ;_:?-~::~~::i~ ~I:I: :i:- --:I-- :----~ii:-j -i- il ..

The Purist surface manipulations of plan-section-elevation, intended to elucidate the con- cealed structures of presumably ordinary objects, now in fact have just the opposite effect: that of engendering am- biguously related animistic subjects, trapped within a gar- den of delights rather more mechanistically inspired than that of Bosch. In the case of the 1922 still life, there is an attempt to infuse translucency into earthy opacities; ocher- orange-green-grays tinted and shaded within a compressed range of values work to release the central black modeling of the fluted goblet, thereby minimally yet powerfully as- serting its paradoxical presence. This curious overlapping distortion in what should have been a polemically clear representation recalls the figural excesses of the Gris paint- ing discussed earlier and definitively signifies Le Corbu- sier's transition from the Purist vocabulary of reasonably clear tectonic projections to a painterly repertory with dis- tortive and enigmatic characteristics. Taken together, these four paintings - three by Le Corbu- sier, one by Gris - offer more than a glimpse of the new poetics of modernist still-life painting. With Gris, the wed- ding of Euclidean and Orphic impulses will be consum- mated in his late works of the 1920s. With Le Corbusier, the constraints of Purist aesthetics, of compositional literal- ness, will be radically loosened, giving way to more ambig- uous space and content and allowing the artist's psychic energies to overflow into his work - not only from the containers being represented, but also from the larger, more metaphorical ones that become the canvases and architectural projects themselves. Just as the Dom-ino is succeeded by the subtler and darker intricacies of the Jean- neret-La Roche house and villas Savoye and Garches, so these, in turn, will be replaced by the more outward ener- gies of the Pavillon Suisse, the Palace of the Soviets, and the Algiers Obus, and, still later, by the poetic imagination of Ronchamp and La Tourette, two structures that encap- sulate the subliminal and the sublime. What could you not find contained in a canvas if you could obtain the painter's confession? But the canvas goes out alone, making or not making its way, bearing its message. There is a world in a painting or a building as there is also in a work of city planning. Seek, and you shall find. Look into the depths of the work and ask yourself questions. There are illuminations and scenes; there are hours of fullness, agonies, radiant or menacing skies, houses and mountains, seas and lagoons, suns and moons. And there are besides all the cries of the subconscious, sensual or chaste, and everything you can imagine. Le Corbusier, New World of Space, 1948 "Tout calice est demeure."
