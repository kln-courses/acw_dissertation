<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEAUTIFUL GATE: VLADIMIR NABOKOV AND ORTHODOX ICONOGRAPHY Samuel Schuman As a final question, do you believe in God? To be quite candid - and what I am going to say now is something I never said before, and I hope it provokes a salutary little chill -lnow more than I can express in words, and the little I can express would not have been expressed, had I not known more. Vladimir Nabokov, from a 1 964 interview with Alvin Toffler (Strong Opinions 45) /. Aesthetic Escapism The first book to be written about Vladimir Nabokov, Page Stegner's Escape Into Aesthetics reflected accurately the widespread assessment of Nabokov's art in the mid 1960's. When Stegner wrote, Lolita was still a rather scandalous title, Pale Fire a. fairly recent addition to the canon. Ada and the later novels were yet to come, and the translations of the early Russian works were also not widely available. The book, which was an important and valuable contribution to Nabokov studies, is fairly repre- sented by its title. Stegner focuses upon the puzzles in Nabokov's works, the games played in his novels, his glittering and self-referential prose style. Nabokov's life of loss and exile led Stegner and others to a sense that the author's real roots were to be found in art. He was able to "escape" from R&amp;L32A (Spring 2000) 47</page><page sequence="2">48 Religion &amp; Literature an inevitably tragic view of human life and the geopolitical world into a self-contained aesthetic universe. Although criticism of Nabokov in the following thirty years has moved beyond Stegner's thesis, much that he observed was accurately seen, and his work was an important advance. That Nabokov would be regarded as one of the twentieth-century's prime advocates of "art for art's sake" was perhaps not to be avoided, for two reasons. The first is that glittering prose style. Any artist who so consis- tently and so delightfully calls attention to the medium in which he or she creates should expect to be labeled an aesthete. Nabokov is like the oil painter who invites us to focus upon brush strokes, the sculptor who reminds us of the block of rock from which the created form emerges. But, of course, no one would today think of Van Gogh or Rodin as interested only in form, and not in substance, nor suggest that it is possible to dissect the aesthetic practices of the painter and sculptor from theme or meaning or the non-superficial. It is certainly true that Nabokov has, in the words of his creation Humbert Humbert, a "fancy prose style" (Lolita 9). It is to the unique play of his words that our attention is first drawn. It does not, however, stop there. The second reason that Nabokov was considered little more than an interesting aesthete was his oft-repeated, passionate, and apparently sin- cere affirmation that his work did not have some sort of social message, that it was not carrying a symbolic burden, that he did not see the purpose of art as political reformation. It has never been suggested that Nabokov wasn't serious about his writing, but it has struck readers, particularly in the mid years of the last, solemn, century, that he was serious about little else. A more reflective contemporary overview of Nabokov's life and works gives the lie to such an impression: it is very evident that he was very deeply serious about a great many things. Still, those sardonic disavowals were certainly discouraging to any critic who might have looked with interest at Nabokov's works from a non-aesthetic perspective: There exist few things more tedious than a discussion of general ideas inflicted by author or reader upon a work of fiction. The purpose of this foreword is not to show that Bend Sinister belongs or does not belong to "serious literature" (which is a euphemism for the hollow profundity and the ever- welcome commonplace). I have never been interested in what is called the literature of social comment (in journalistic and commercial parlance: "great books"). I am not "sincere," I am not "provocative," I am not "satirical." I am neither a didacticist nor an allegorizer. Politics and economics, atomic bombs, primitive and abstract art forms, the entire Orient, symptoms of "thaw" in Soviet Russia, the Future of Mankind, and so on leave me supremely indifferent. (Bend Sinister xii)</page><page sequence="3">SAMUEL SCHUMAN 49 Nor did it help that some of the authors for whom Nabokov reserved his sharpest barbs were the most conspicuously serious about non-artistic issues in their works: I happen to find second-rate and ephemeral the works of a number of puffed-up writers - such as Camus, Lorca, Kazantzakis, D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann, Thomas Wolfe, and literally hundreds of other "great" second raters. (Strong Opinions 54) So the image of Nabokov the aesthete, the escapist, the game-player flourished. The negative aspect of this image is obvious. It suggests that Nabokov is somehow trivial, that he is (to use his own image of another writer) all porch and no house. For example, an anonymous review of Pale Fire in Time suggests that Nabokov should be classed as a "clever" writer. Pale Fire is filled with tricky verbal allusions which lead nowhere. While Nabokov is "the greatest verbal prestidigitator of his time," this novel is at best highly skillful, but not "significant" (Time 84). //. Otherworldliness In the 1980's a radically different cluster of readings emerged. Begin- ning with Vera Nabokov's assertion in 1979 that the "otherworld" (potustoronnost) was the central theme in her late husband's work, and culminating in Vladimir E. Alexandrov's 1991 Nabokov's Otherworld, there has been a sharp rise in the attention paid to theological themes and motifs in Nabokov's fiction, poetry and non-fiction writings. W. W. Rowe, for example, devotes an entire, albeit short, book {Nabokov's Spectral Dimension) to evidence of the pervasiveness of ghosts in most of Nabokov's major works. (Other important contributions to this new direction of investiga- tion are Ellen Pifer's Nabokov and the Novel, and Brian Boyd's two volume biography.) Alexandrov defines this motif splendidly, describing "Nabokov's faith in the apparent existence of a transcendent, nonmaterial, timeless and beneficent, ordering and ordered realm of being that seems to provide for personal immortality and that affects everything that exists in the mun- dane world" (Garland 568). It seems clear that an objective reading of Pale Fire, for example, reveals a preoccupation of John Shade, and Charles Kinbote, and their creator, with life after death, voices from beyond the grave, what Shade, in grieving and hurt wit calls the "great Maybe . . . big if" (36).</page><page sequence="4">50 Religion &amp; Literature Similarly, and more intriguingly, Invitation to a Beheading concludes with the dissolution of the stage props and set of "reality" in the world of the protagonist, Cincinnatus C: Little was left of the square. The platform had long since collapsed in a cloud of reddish dust. The last to rush past was a woman in a black shawl, carrying the tiny executioner like a larva in her arms. The fallen trees lay flat and reliefless, while those that were still standing, also two-dimensional, with a lateral shading of the trunk to suggest roundness, barely held on with their branches to the ripping mesh of the sky. Everything was coming apart. Everything was falling. A spinning wind was picking up and whirling: dust, rags, chips of painted wood, bits of gilded plaster, pasteboard bricks, posters; an arid gloom fleeted; and amidst the dust, and the falling things, and the flapping scenery, Cincinnatus made his way in that direction where, to judge by the voices, stood beings akin to him. (223) Who are these "beings?" From within the fictive cosmos of the novel, they are obviously "otherworldly" creatures. But from the perspective of the "real" world, which is shared by the author and readers of Invitation to a Beheading, this is less clear. One might ask, "Is Cincinnatus going to heaven ... or is he coming to us?" Is the other world, which appears behind the artificial set of the novel, our world? Such a resolution would be entirely in keeping with the curious endings of other works by Nabokov, perhaps most spectacularly Bend Sinister. III. Nabokov as God; God as Nabokov This moves us another step closer to the synthesis between the aes- thete/metaphysician thesis and antithesis. As Alexandrov argues convinc- ingly, Nabokov's focus upon the artistic process is not an act of disengage- ment from theological concerns, but rather an embodiment of those otherworldly issues. When Nabokov steps forth as the creator of his fictive characters at the conclusions of Bend Sinister, Lolita, or Invitation to a Behead- ing, he is overtly invoking the parallel between the creative artist and the creative Deity. The Lord is a creative artist, and the world is his creation; the poet is, in his/her smaller world, a god, and the work of art his/her created universe. D. Barton Johnson argues that Nabokov's "concern with the 'hereafter,' with the other world, "has been well established, and it seems possible that the cosmology we have outlined for his novels may provide a personal cosmology .... Nabokov saw himself and his world in much the same way some of his fictional favorites come to see their own" (2). As Alexandrov suggests, "Nabokov's characteristic aesthetic practices resurrect the Romantic idea that the artist is God's rival, and that man's</page><page sequence="5">SAMUEL SCHUMAN 5 1 artistic creations are analogues to God's natural world" (18). "A creative writer," Nabokov proclaims in Strong Opinions, "must study carefully the works of his rivals, including the Almighty." Like the Almighty, "he must possess the inborn capacity not only of recombining but of re-creating the given world" (32). So, in Bend Sinister, the narrative voice arranges and rearranges the materials of the novel - godlike - in front of the readers' eyes: "The rest sighed and signed, or did not sigh and signed, or signed - and sighed afterward, or did neither the one nor the other ..." (48). In W. W. Rowe's rather memorable words, this is "the author, as a Creator who can turn backwards and forwards at will the file cards upon which he composes . . . [and who thus] transcends the time of his unsuspecting characters' world" (108). At the end of the novel the narrator informs his readers that he takes pity on his (created) protagonist, and, in a kind of stylistic knight's move, veers the novel into a new and unpredicted direction by touching his main character with the blissful anesthesia of madness: It was at this moment, just after Krug had fallen through the bottom of a confused dream and sat up on the straw with a gasp - and just before his reality, his remembered hideous misfortune could pounce upon him - it was then that I felt a pang of pity for Adam and slid towards him along an inclined beam of pale light-causing instantaneous madness, but at least saving him from the senseless agony of his logical fate. (210) Nabokov is explicit about his role here: [Krug] realizes suddenly the presence of the Author [caps, sic] of things, the Author of him and of his life and of all the lives round him, - the Author is myself, the man who writes the book of his life. This singular apotheosis (a device never yet attempted in literature) is, if you like, a kind of symbol of the Divine power. {Letters 49-50) The image of Nabokov as a puppet master, manipulating his wooden creations, has been much utilized, often in an unadmiring or ambivalent tone. But puppet masters do not slide down beams of light or confer immortality; gods do. Moreover, the puppet analogy suggests a simplistic dualism between the "real" world of author and reader, and the artificial cosmos inhabited by characters - Krug or Cincinnatus. But Nabokov always insists that "real" wear its thorny crown of quotation marks, and his model of reality is much more a graduated series of transparent layers than a digitalized on/off switch (a scheme which is both central and titular in Transparent Things). Such a view, like the mirror reflecting a mirror, suggests an infinite regression (thus, the title of D. Barton Johnson's study, Worlds in Regression). The effect is like that at the conclusion of A Midsummer</page><page sequence="6">52 Religion &amp; Literature Night's Dream: as the actors playing the Theseus, Hippolyta and Athenian court sit and chuckle at the acting being done by the rude mechanicals, we, in the second audience, chuckle at them . . . but might wonder what audiences is amused by our antics. Nabokov's non-fictional writings also speak to the theme of the artist as God, God as an artist. In the preface to the Time edition of Bend Sinister, he refers to "an anthropomorphic deity impersonated by me" and de- scribes the novel's finale in similar theological terminology: "Krug returns to the bosom of his maker" (xviii). I agree with Alexandrov that, for Nabokov, "the metaliterary is camouflage for, and a model of, the meta- physical" (18). Aesthetics and religion are one, not because the author is a worshipper at the hollow shrine of "pure" art, but because aesthetic acts mimic divine actions, and vice versa. Nabokov's compulsive creation of, and seeking for, patterns is a textual pointer signaling the controlling artistic intelligence of the creator. As he proclaims so eloquently in Speak, Memory, Nabokov seeks in life, especially his own life, the patterns he created in art: "The following of such thematic designs through one's life should be, I think, the true purpose of autobiography" (27). We are wise to recall the writer's charming description of his childhood as an embryonic artist: "I used to be a little conjurer when I was a boy. I loved doing simple tricks - turning water into wine, that sort of thing" {Strong Opinions 1 1). IV Moments of Faith We have seen a progression, then, from a critical image of Nabokov as gifted but essentially trivial aesthete, to an author who focuses upon the otherworldly, to a synthesis in which we can recognize that the aesthetic consciousness and the metaphysical concerns are inseparably bound to- gether into a coherent artistic and philosophical stance. Given, then, that contemporary Nabokov studies are ready to accept the importance of religious motifs and themes in his work, I suggest that a next question is: what is the connection between Nabokov's religion . . . and Religion? It is one thing to speak of intuitions of a realm of timeless transcendence; it is another thing to investigate the degree to which the otherworldliness of Nabokov's art is connected to formal faith systems. Is Nabokov, in some sense, a Christian? Is he influenced by overtly Christian materials? What role might other faiths, particularly the proud Judiasm of Vera Slonim's background, (a faith which his father courageously defended in anti- semitic pogrom-prone old Russia) play in Nabokov's aesthetic theology? In her biography of Vera Nabokov, Stacy Schiff recounts:</page><page sequence="7">SAMUEL SCHUMAN 53 Great numbers of inaccurate things were written about her over the years, but the single one she found it incumbent upon herself to correct was a line in the New York Post that made her a Russian aristocrat. "In your article you describe me as an emigre of the Russian aristocratic class. I am very proud of my ancestry which actually is Jewish." (26) More theologically and less biographically, Maxim Shrayer finds in The Gift a Judaic concept of death, as well as themes of religious conver- sion and anti-Semitism, and in Pnin, an extended consideration of the Holocaust (77-87). This is a promising line of inquiry, which I believe merits serious further investigation. It would be interesting to expand consideration both of the range of Jewish themes and the breadth of literary works examined. In this essay, though, my focus is more narrowly on aspects of Nabokov's Russian Orthodox Christianity. There certainly are strong pointers which suggest that Nabokov was serious about institutionalized, formal Christianity. Here are three rather dramatic instances: 1 . Kinbote's faith. Charles Kinbote in Pale Fire is certainly not to be confused for his creator, indeed, he is in many ways a ludicrous parody of Nabokov himself. (There are, though, autobiographical connections; at the very end of the novel, Kinbote, its narrator, declares: "I may turn up yet, on another campus, as an old, happy, healthy, heterosexual Russian, a writer in exile, sans fame, sans future, sans audience, sans anything but his art" [2 1 2] .) But there are undeniably moments in Kinbote's lunatic twichings where he seems not comic but pathetic, and even, in a very few instances, genuinely tragic and noble. Frequently, those moments are the ones where Kinbote reveals his apparent deeply held, powerful, faith. Speaking of Shade's poetic inspiration, for example, he tells of seeing a priest "in the act of making contact with God." He affirms that "there is no bound to the measure of grace which man may be able to achieve," and says of Shade, "I knew. . .at that moment Our Lord was with him" (63-65). A few pages later, feeling his sanity slipping away from him, Kinbote keens, "Dear Jesus, do something" (67). Kinbote discusses suicide in overtly Christian terms: "When the soul adores Him Who guides it through mortal life, when it distinguishes His sign at every turn of the trail, printed on the boulder and notched in the fir trunk, when every page in the book of one's personal fate bears His watermark, how can one doubt that He will also preserve us through all eternity?" (158). This passage is particularly noteworthy in that Kinbote is repeating, but with the addition of an overt deity, a very similar passage from Nabokov's autobiography: "Neither in environment nor in heredity</page><page sequence="8">54 Religion &amp; Literature can I find the exact instrument that fashioned me, the anonymous roller that pressed upon my life a certain intricate watermark whose unique design becomes visible when the lamp of art is made to shine through life's foolscap" (Speak, Memory 25). Shade and Kinbote argue about religion, with Kinbote contending, How much more intelligent it is, - even from a proud infidel's point of view! - to accept God's Presence - a faint phosphorescence at first, a pale light in the dimness of bodily life, and a dazzling radiance after it .... I know that the world could not have occurred fortuitously and that somehow Mind is involved as a main factor in the making of the universe. In trying to find the right name for that Universal Mind, or First Cause, or the Absolute, or Nature, I submit that the Name of God has priority. (161-62) This description of "God's Presence" echoes Fyodor (a more palatable autobiographical double than Kinbote) in The Gift: "there is no time, that everything is the present situated like a radiance outside our blindness" (354). Too, it is difficult to ignore entirely the description of god as a "pale light" in a novel entitled Pale Fire. 2. "Christmas." The short story "Christmas," first appeared, in Rus- sian, in 1924, and is reprinted, in English translation by Dmitri Nabokov in details of a Sunset (1976) and The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov (and is not to be confused with "The Christmas Story," also in the collected stories). This is an odd work. It tells of one Sleptsov, who returns to his country manor in midwinter to mourn the recent death of his young son. Sinking further and further into morbid depression, he "had a fleeting sensation that earthly life lay before him, totally bared and comprehensible - and ghastly in its sadness, humiliatingly pointless, sterile, devoid of miracles . . " when suddenly, a miracle occurs. The cocoon of an Attacus moth his son had saved, reinvigorated by the new rewarmed country house, hatches: Gradually, the wrinkled tissues, the velvety fringes unfurled ; the fan- pleated veins grew firmer as they filled with air. It became a winged thing imperceptible, as a maturing face imperceptibly becomes beautiful. And its wings - still feeble, still moist - kept growing and unfolding and now they were developed to the limit set for them by God .... And then those thick black wings, with a glazy eyespot on each and a purplish bloom dusting their hooked foretips, took a full breath under the impulse of tender, ravishing, almost human happiness. (Stories 1 36) This story is in some ways very "Nabokovian": certainly, the appear- ance of the moth at the crucial moment of the narration is typical. On the other hand, the shape of this story, with its conclusionary moment of hope and resurrection seems strikingly simple in its piety. The story is, in my</page><page sequence="9">SAMUEL SCHUMAN 55 reading, without irony, without ambivalence. It is a Christmas story about the power of love, about the triumph of birth over death. 3. An autobiographical vision. Speak, Memory is certainly not a reli- gious chronicle, but it is interesting that at an emotional high point of the autobiography (and perhaps, thanks to Brian Boyd, its most famous pas- sage) the narration literally ascends into the realm of formal religion. Watching peasants fling his father skyward, Nabokov recalls: Thrice, to the mighty heave-ho of his invisible tossers, he would fly up in this fashion, and the second time he would go higher than the first and then there he would be, on his last and loftiest flight, reclining, as if for good, against the cobalt blue of the summer noon, like one of those paradisiac personages who comfort- ably soar, with such a wealth of folds in their garments, on the vaulted ceilings of a church while below, one by one, the wax tapers in mortal hands light up to make a swarm of minute flames in the mist of incense, and the priest chants of eternal repose, and funeral lilies conceal the face of whoever lies there, among the swimming lights, in the open coffin. (31-32) There are certainly other instances of overt religiosity in Nabokov's works, but these three seem particularly striking examples, not just of a mysterious "otherworld," but of a serious focus on explicitly Christian material. The passage above from Speak, Memory, with its movement through the dim, incense-filled interior of an Orthodox church offers a handy transition. I wish now to focus more narrowly on a particular aspect of Nabokov's works, in which he shows a remarkable link to a crucial aspect of the religion of his homeland, Russian Orthodoxy. I believe Nabokov's works are, in a pervasive and deep way, iconic: that they partake of the unique and mystic nature of Church icons. V Icons Byzantine icons, including the iconography of Russian Orthodoxy, are a form of art which "seemed to reach out towards the other world" (Gerhard 204). In the world of the icons, "the appearances of visible objects and the three-dimensional world is altered and adapted so that, as in a dream, another reality is discovered in which the logic of sense perception is suspended" (Grove 76). This is an accurate description of the conclusions of several of Nabokov's novels, including Invitation to a Beheading, Bend Sinister, and to some extent Ada, The Eye, Lolita and Transpar- ent Things. This aesthetic perspective is not a familiar nor a comfortable one for most of us. We are used to a tidy bipolar distinction between reality and representation. The first task facing a Westerner (particularly, per-</page><page sequence="10">56 Religion &amp; Literature haps, a Western non-Christian) is realizing some of the things icons in the Eastern church are not. Icons are not church "decoration." "An icon is not an end in itself; it is not merely an aesthetic object to be enjoyed for whatever artistic merits it possesses ..." (Cavarnos 32). It is certainly possible for a Western European Christian, even a very traditional Roman Catholic Christian, to imagine houses of worship, and patterns of worship, wholly free of religious pictorial imagery. Indeed, one of the defining acts of the Protes- tant reformation was the uprooting and destruction of much of the imagery which filled Roman churches. The architecture and design of Scandinavian Lutheran or Swiss Calvinist houses of worship celebrate austerity, for example. While pictures, stained glass, statuary, and even objects such as monstrances continue to play a significant role in Catholi- cism, that role is, ultimately, optional. The monastic ideal, for example, certainly stresses starkness of surroundings and physical simplicity as an aid to religiosity. But in Russia, by way of contrast: Every Orthodox church has an iconostasis, a wooden or marble screen supporting panel icons and separating the bema or sanctuary from the main body of the church, the nave. Also, there are proskynetaria or icon stands, on which special icons are placed for veneration .... The lower series [ tier of the iconostasis ] always includes at least the following three icons: that of Christ, that of the Theotokos [Virgin Mary] and that of the sacred person, persons or event specially celebrated by the particular church. The icon of Christ is invariably placed immediately to the south of the door which is at the middle of the iconostasis and is known as the Beautiful Gate (Horaia Pyle), while that of the Theotokos is always placed immedi- ately to the north of the Beautiful Gate. (Cavarnos 22-23) Icons are not an optional decorative element in Orthodox Christian- ity, but an essential and integrated central element of faith. Too, icons are not in any conventional Western sense "symbolic." While it is certainly true that the painted image on an icon "stands for" or "represents" something, to say that an icon "symbolizes" its subject is to impoverish it. Rather, in a true - that is, spiritually beautiful - icon, we see embodied the "belief that the image and the person represented by it were one and the same" (Gerhard 204). Thus, in an iconic portrait of the Theotokos, we do not see simply a "symbol" of the Virgin Mother, but, shining through the work of art, some aspect of her essence. It is fascinating to compare even the simplest icon to a highly complex, western symbolic painting, such as Vermeer's "The Allegory of Faith." The latter, while far more complex and ambivalent in interpretation is, nonetheless, far less mysterious. With the Vermeer, we need to figure out what that snake with blood oozing from</page><page sequence="11">SAMUEL SCHUMAN 57 its mouth "stands for." With the icon, we somehow penetrate into the very essence of Christ or His Mother or the Saints. Cavarnos catalogs several functions of icons. These include their "anagogic function": "to lift us to the prototypes, to a higher level of consciousness of thought and feeling"; they "transform our character, our whole being, to help sanctify us"; and they have a liturgical role "as a means of worship and veneration. This is one of its primary functions, more important than the first . . . leading the soul from the visible to the invisible, from the material to the spiritual" (32-33). (Again, an exact description of the conclusion of Bend Sinister discussed earlier.) Orthodox Christians "venerate" icons. That is, they do not "worship" them, but worship their prototypes "in" them. The Seventh Ecumenical Synod of 787 affirms "For the honor which is paid to the icon passes on to that which the icon represents, and he who reveres the icon reveres in it the person who is represented" (54; italics mine). The crucial phrase here is "in it" as contrasted to "through it." Icons, thus, participate in the holiness of their subjects; they do not simply symbolize it. This is surely one reason why orthodoxy devised very strict guidelines for what icons were, what aesthetic standards they must fulfill, and what sort of lives must be led by those who painted them (a bad person could not paint a good icon). A survey of the history of icons, their evolution in Russia, the issue of iconoclasm, and the like is way beyond the scope of this discussion. What is essential here is a kind of rudimentary grasp of a kind of iconic consciousness which seems to me essentially without any real analogs in Western art. An icon painting is, clearly, a highly stylized, formalistic aesthetic work; it makes absolutely no pretensions to naturalism or realism, indeed, much of its value lies in its ability to transcend the "real." And, it is, on the one hand, "just" a painting: pigments applied in an artistic pattern to an undisguised two dimensional surface; and something much holier, deeper and more mysterious, without existing in a kind of one-to- one "symbolic" relationship with what it depicts. It is not that the surface of the icon stands for its subject, but partakes of it; it is just a surface, but it is infinitely deep, like the surfaces in Transparent Things (see below). For all his Cornell University / Swiss-Western sophistication, we need to recall that Vladimir Nabokov grew to adulthood in pre-Revolutionary Russia. Even in its most secularized and Westernized manifestations, that was a culture which was permeated by Orthodoxy. The Nevsky Prospekt in Nabokov's St. Petersburg - perhaps the most Western street in all of Russia - has as its centerpiece the rather overwhelming and icon-filled Kazan Cathedral, perhaps a brisk fifteen-minute walk from the Nabokovs'</page><page sequence="12">58 Religion &amp; Literature Petersburg townhouse. In his autobiography, Nabokov mentions the inter- esting role a household icon played in his nightly going-to-sleep ritual: Closed inside shutters, a lighted candle, Gentle Jesus, meek and mild something- something little child, the child kneeling on the pillow that presently would engulf his humming head. English prayers and the little icon featuring a sun-tanned Greek Catholic saint formed an innocent association upon which I look back with pleasure; and above the icon ... a framed aquarelle showed a dusky path .... While I knelt on my pillow in a mist of drowsiness and talc-powdered well-being . . . I imagined the motion of climbing into the picture above my bed and plunging into that enchanted beechwood - which I did visit in due time. (85-86) Russian Orthodoxy cannot be separated from its icons. It should not be a surprise, then, that Nabokov's unique aesthetic consciousness would in- clude, to some extent, the distinctive iconic perspective. VI. Nabokov's Iconography First and most obviously, Nabokov's visual imagery reflects an iconic impulse. "I see in images, not words," Nabokov asserts (Appel 195), and he elaborates "I think I was born a painter - really! - and up to my four- teenth year, perhaps, I used to spend most of the day drawing and painting and I was supposed to become a painter in due time" (Strong Opinions 1 7). (But it is important to keep in mind that my thesis is that Nabokov's use of the iconic mode is not limited to visual imagery, but extends to thematic motifs as well.) Some of the most visually gripping scenes in Nabokov's works seem to catch the flavor of the icons. Consider, for example, the "stereoscopic dreamland" found at the end of Chapter Five, section 1 of Speak, Memory. The autobiographer imagines the arrival in Russia of "Mademoiselle," his new French governess. She comes from Switzerland to Vyra, the Nabokov family country estate, in the dead of winter 1905-06. The description of her arrival at the rural train station and the start of her journey by sled to the Nabokov estate is a tour-de-force of verbal landscape painting. As the horses begin the sleigh ride with a jerk, Nabokov introduces a shadow effect: "thanks to the sudden radiance of a lone lamp ... a grossly exaggerated shadow, also holding a muff, races beside the sleigh, climbs a billow of snow, and is gone " The light of the station square is replaced by the darkness of what the overweight French governess calls "with awe . and gusto . . . le steppe." In that darkness we spot the "changeable twinkle of remote village lights," lights which seem to Mademoiselle to be the eyes of wolves. A second sled, carrying her baggage follows, and it appears "like</page><page sequence="13">SAMUEL SCHUMAN 59 those companionable phantoms of ships in polar waters." Next Nabokov begins to wave his verbal magic wand: "And let me not leave out the moon - for surely there must be a moon ... so there it comes, steering out of a flock of small dappled clouds, which it tinges with vague iridescence." Not content with making the moon appear, Nabokov then makes Russia, and sixty years of sad history, vanish: But what am I doing in this stereoscopic dreamland? How did I get here? Somehow, the two sleighs have slipped away, leaving behind a passportless spy standing on the blue-white road in his New England snowboots and stormcoat... The snow is real, though, and as I bend to it and scoop up a handful, sixty years crumble to glittering frost-dust between my fingers. (98-100) This is certainly a scene which those who imagine Nabokov to be a cold and feelingless aesthete might well reread. And yet, the effect of this powerful visual image is surely artful: the power derives from the artistic manipulation of the medium, language. The scene is at once fiercely emotional and highly contrived. Like an icon, the artifice of the art is dominant and self-conscious. The iconographer does not seek to be con- fused with the photographer; the highly stylized, conventional, non-realis- tic visual style of icon painting is exactly matched by the self-consciously artistic, "made" flavor of this passage: "let me not leave out the moon " Nabokov makes very sure we understand that he is creating, not reproduc- ing this scene - which, of course, he makes it clear he could not have actually seen to begin with. And, just as in a great icon, the emotional force of the image is intensified by its obvious artificiality. An important differ- ence, of course, is that while Nabokov's visual imagery points to Nabokov as an individual artist, the icons present themselves as self-consciously artificial, but anonymous, creations. An icon says, in effect, "I was made"; a passage in Nabokov says "Nabokov made me." And yet, this scene is, as an icon, just "superficial." It does not "symbolize" anything. The snow that the author conjures up is snow, not a symbol of Old Rus. The sleigh is a sled, not an emblem of the passage of time; the darkness is night, not grim history; the governness is a fat lady, not a symbol of the influence of French culture in pre-Revolutionary enlightened Westernized Russian life. The picture is laden with meaning, but the meaning is embedded within the surface, not "below" it. The surface itself is two dimensional, but deep. That, exactly, is the paradox of the icon. And, of course, that is the paradox of much of Nabokov's writing. And of religion. The meaning is not "below the surface," it is on the surface, but the surface is anything but simple.</page><page sequence="14">60 Religion &amp; Literature In the first chapter of Transparent Things (a work which argues that all things are, finally, "transparent") Nabokov suggests that below the "sur- face" of material objects lurks not some allegorical meaning, but a kind of temporal expansion: When we concentrate on a material object, whatever its situation, the very act of attention may lead to our involuntarily sinking into the history of that object. Novices must learn to skim over matter if they want matter to stay at the exact level of the moment. Transparent things, through which the past shines! .... A thin veneer of immediate reality is spread over natural and artificial matter, and whoever wishes to remain in the now, with the now, on the now, should please not break its tension film. Otherwise the inexperienced miracle-worker will find himself no longer walking on water but descending upright among staring fish. (10-11) In the next chapter, Nabokov gives a demonstration of exactly how this iconic understanding of sub-surface but non-symbolic layering works. His hero casually spots an old pencil, and then follow three pages tracing the ancestry of that humble implement, including "old Elias Borrowdale" who cut the graphite in the pencil, the plump sheep in whose fat the lead is boiled and that sheep's shepherd, and that shepherd's Mexican father, and the pine tree from which comes the log from which the wood of the pencil is hewn. Shining through the transparent current reality of the modest writing implement is its entire history, and the history of everything in its history. The pencil "is" the sheep and the graphite cutter and the pine tree, just as the Theotokos "is" the Virgin Mary. Perhaps the best-known and tidiest illustration of Nabokov's icono- graphic consciousness is the conclusion of his autobiography, Speak, Memory. In this passage, we have a nearly perfect illustration of the way in which, in Nabokov and in an icon, the surface of a thing can have a profound meaning, embody an important mystery, and be not at all symbolic. Nabokov and his wife Vera and son Dmitri, six years old in 1940, prepare to flee Europe for the United States. They look out over the jumbled skyline of St. Nazaire and, suddenly, as we came to the end of its path, you and I saw something that we did not immediately point out to our child, so as to enjoy in full the blissful shock, the enchantment and glee he would experience on discovering ahead the ungenuinely gigantic, the unrealistically real prototype of the various toy vessels he had doddled about in his bath. There, in front of us, where a broken row of houses stood between us and the harbor, and where the eye encountered all sorts of stratagems, such as pale-blue and pink underwear cakewalking, or a lady's bicycle and a striped cat oddly sharing a rudimentary balcony of cast iron, it was most satisfying to make out among the jumbled angles of roofs and walls, a splendid</page><page sequence="15">SAMUEL SCHUMAN 6 1 ship's funnel, showing from behind the clothesline as something in a scrambled picture - Find What the Sailor Has Hidden - that the finder cannot unsee once it has been seen. (309-10) The blissful shock; the enchantment and glee; the seemingly unrealis- tically vision, which turns out to be real; and the picture which cannot be unseen once recognized: this is exactly the language in which believers describe orthodox icons. It is my thesis that Nabokov's artful, literary treatment of visual imagery, his complicated understanding of the relationship between sur- face and depth, and his distaste for "symbolism" all embody an "iconic consciousness." It is not clear to me that Nabokov understood this con- sciousness in just these terms: he certainly never argues that his art is iconic. Indeed, it may well be that this kind of subtle and complex grasp of the iconic connection between representation and essence is some kind of unselfconscious cultural predilection (although it is difficult to imagine that any characteristic of Nabokov's prose is "unselfconscious"). It would certainly be interesting to know if Nabokov saw any of the connections between his literary aesthetics and the icons, but, of course, that is a question which is now impossible to answer. In the final (new critical) analysis, it is irrelevant to ask if an artist explicitly and rationally grasps the strategies and techniques of his art. Rather, it is to the works themselves we must turn to discover what the writer has fashioned. VII An Iconographic Reading of Pale Fire It is rewarding to examine one of Vladimir Nabokov's major works of fiction from a perspective informed by icons and iconography. Pale Fire is a challenging and multi-faceted novel which rewards such a reading, one in which we approach the work of art seeking an essence which shines through the novel, without "symbolizing" anything. It offers an excellent opportunity to study Nabokov's iconic strategy at the thematic, more than the imagistic, level. At the core of this work is an iconostasis of sorts, a gallery of icons, many of which are figures of Shakespeare. That Shakespeare is a constant presence in Pale Fire is clear even to a careful first time reader. His presence grows clearer the more we study the novel. Pale Fire is a four-part novel: a "foreword," a poem entitled "Pale Fire" purportedly by one John Shade (a fictional character created by Nabokov), a commentary upon that poem, and an index. The foreword, commentary and index are the work of another fictional character, Charles Kinbote. Kinbote actually twists the scholarly apparatus into telling what might or</page><page sequence="16">62 Religion &amp; Literature might not be his own story: that he is the disguised and exiled King Charles of Nova Zembla. The complex and challenging relationship between these three authors - Nabokov, Shade, Kinbote - has been much discussed, and has generated several interesting theories (e.g., Kinbote is a character created by Shade, who is in turn a character created by Nabokov; Kinbote is actually a deranged American academic named "Botkin," etc.). Kinbote evokes Shakespeare by comparing himself, in the foreword and the commentary, to the exiled and bitter Timon of Athens: "Having no library in the desolate log cabin where I live like Timon in his Cave ..." (57); "Instead of answering a month-old letter from my cave in Cedarn. . ."(1 1); "... his Timonian cave" (Index 218). These innocuous references are actually a portal to an extensive set of variations on the Timon theme. The title phrase, "pale fire," for example, is taken from Timon of Athens. Amusingly, Kinbote cannot identify the exact source of John Shade's Shakespearean citation for the poem's title, yet he unwittingly quotes the actual passage which contains these words, but in a maladroit Zemblan translation which turns "pale fire" into "silvery light" (58). Moreover, it turns out that the Zemblan translation of the play is the only book in his possession as he frantically tries to annotate Shade's "Pale Fire." This very book is omnipresent throughout Kinbote 's (unreal?) young life and his commentary. Kinbote also evokes Hamlet often, and some readers of Pale Fire believe that "Kinbote" is actually a pseudonym for a mad American scholar named "Botkin." This reading is reinforced by a note in the Index: "Botkin, V American scholar of Russian descent, 894; kingbot, maggot of extinct fly that once bred in mammoths . . . ; botkin or bodkin, a Danish stiletto" (216). Kinbote links his name to a reference to the "bare bodkin" Hamlet contemplates as an instrument of suicide, a connection he has also made earlier: "There are purists [considering suicide] who maintain that a gentleman should use a brace of pistols, one for each temple, or a bare botkin (note the correct spelling) ..." (157). A score of references to and citations of the Bard further enrich the Shakespearean motif. For example, there is "clumsy Ophelia" and "shuffled off" in the discussion of suicide, again evoking Hamlet (157). There is a "Coriolanus lane" and a "Timon alley" (55, 91) in the town where Kinbote lives as well as an avenue lined with trees mentioned by Shakespeare (66, 68, 205). A minor character in the novel is the ludicrous Zemblan transla- tor of Shakespeare, Conmal, who is actually responsible for the mis- translation of Timon cited by Kinbote (Schuman, "Comment"). There is a tutor who "could reel off Macbeth from beginning to end during hikes"</page><page sequence="17">SAMUEL SCHUMAN 63 (76). Kinbote and Shade have a conversation on "the subject of teaching Shakespeare at college" (112). Shade wrote a poem on the curious subject of the return of the dead in the form of electricity, which Kinbote quotes, one stanza of which reads: "And maybe Shakespeare floods a whole/ Town with innumerable lights,/ And Shelley's incandescent soul/ Lures the pale moths of starless nights" (138). A Zemblan nobleman is Harfar, Baron of Shalksbore, whose family name, Kinbote speculates, is "derivative of Shakespeare" (149). This sampling of Shakespeare citations in Pale Fire, while perhaps long enough to be tedious, is very far from exhaustive. It is nearly impossible to scan any random section of the novel without finding at least a possible Shakespeare allusion within a page or two. And yet, there is clearly no obvious logical or convincing connection between Pale Fire and the works of William Shakespeare: the novel is most definitely not some modernized version of Timon of Athens. It does not stand in the same relation to that, or any work of Shakespeare as, for example, Ulysses stands to The Odyssey. Nor do Pale Fire's multiple Shakespeareanisms symbolize anything. Timon Lane or the avenue of Shakespearean trees do not somehow stand for the presence of Shakespeare in a college town, or some such. Pale Fire is not an allegorical work, in which the constant references to Shakespeare and his art repre- sent anything. Nor is this incessant motif in the novel "just" a game - Find What the Sailor Has Hidden - Nabokov invites the reader to play with him, although this reading seems closer to the truth than a symbolic interpretation. Rather, the very pervasiveness of the Shakespearean allusions infuses the modern, largely comic novel, with an essence which somehow partakes of Timon and Hamlet. Pale Fire is certainly no Shakespearean tragedy, but it is permeated by a tragic essence: Shakespeare "shines through" the pages of the novel. Of course, there are important distinctions between an icon of the Virgin and a pervasive sense of the Shakespearean in a modern novel. For one, Nabokov does not in any overtly religious way "worship" Shakespeare, although he certainly was for Nabokov, as for most of us, the quintessence of the literary artist, and therefore surprisingly apt in this most literary of novels. To Nabokov, who finds in coincidence "not flimsy nonsense, but a web of sense" {Pale Fire 44), it is clearly important that Shakespeare's birth date is his own, April 23 {Speak, Memory 13-14). Like icons, though, the multiple allusions to Shakespeare in this novel are an essential feature in its "deep surface."</page><page sequence="18">64 Religion &amp; Literature Pale Fire is a "mystery" novel: as the reader peels away one set of questions, another even more challenging is revealed. It is "mysterious" in the sense of popular mystery novels: there are puzzles and clues about identity, about which characters actually did what, and so forth. But more challenging, at its core, the "heart of its mystery" {Hamlet 3.2. 366), it is a religious work: its "mystery" is that of the "Mystery Plays," of John 4:1 1: "Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God." The iconic use of Shakespeare in the novel is an important part of that mystery. John Shade's poem "Pale Fire" is a poem about death and the afterlife. Its central episode is the suicide of Shade's misfit daughter, and the poet's search for answers to the mystery of the hereafter, the "great Maybe" (36). At one point, humorously, Shade describes his stint at the Institute of Preparation for the Hereafter ("I.P.H." or "big if"). His search for clues about life after death leads to an epiphany. He reads a story in a magazine about a woman who, in one of those operating room/temporary death situations, thought she saw a "tall white fountain" during the moments her heart had stopped, before her surgical revivification. This reminded Shade of a remarkably similar vision he had had when, during a speech, he had collapsed into unconsciousness. Seeing in this congruity a possible answer to his quest, Shade visits the woman from the magazine article, only to discover that what she saw was a "mountain," not a "fountain," and that the presumed congruity was the result of a spelling error: "Life Everlast- ing - based on a misprint!" (9. 44). What dawns on Shade is that the "accident" of the misprint is a better clue than the shared vision: But all at once it dawned on me that this Was the real point, the contrapuntal theme; Just this: not text, but texture; not the dream But topsy-turvical coincidence, Not flimsy nonsense, but a web of sense. Yes! It sufficed that I in life could find Some kind of link-and-bobolink, some kind Of correlated pattern in the game Plexed artistry, and something of the same Pleasure in it as they who played it found. It did not matter who they were. No sound, No furtive light came from their involute Abode, but there they were, aloof and mute, playing a game of worlds . . . (44-45) As we have seen above, Nabokov, speaking as himself, asserts in Speak, Memory that the seeking of such patterns in one's life is the highest purpose of autobiography. And, as we have also seen, he finds them. The search for</page><page sequence="19">SAMUEL SCHUMAN 65 hidden patterns of connections, for divine mysteries which link seemingly unrelated things, is actually the source of the Shakespearean title of the novel (and poem). The passage from Timon of Athens (which Kinbote never actually grasps) reads: "the moon's an arrant thief,/And her pale fire she snatches from the sun" (4.3.443-44). The pale light which shines from the moon is actually a reflection of the sun's light. In Pale Fire, Kinbote seeks to illuminate himself and his story in the reflected light of Shade's poem. In Pale Fire, Nabokov, too, plays the moon to Shakespeare's sun. Some of what seems to be the internal shine of this work of art is, in fact, the iconic reflection of the Shakespearean fire which Nabokov so thoroughly ad- mired throughout his life. Given the relatively "flat," game-playing literary strategy of Pale Fire, with its parody of poem and commentary, the web of Shakespearean allusions, props and citations enriches the texture of mys- tery in the novel. They provide a different kind of "depth." Like the icons, each Shakespeare citation in the novel opens a doorway into another, higher, world which seems somehow inexplicably but compellingly spiri- tual. Taken together, they help turn a novel which might seem to some a sterile exercise in literary gamesmanship into a rich and mysterious experi- ence. Through the iconographic use of Shakespeare, Pale Fire undergoes "a sea change, into something rich and strange" (The Tempest 1.2. 401-2). VIII Vladimir Nabokov IS an aesthete, if by that term we mean someone who places an exceptionally high value on works of art and the life of the artist. At the same time, the "otherworld" is a constant and important aspect of his writing. These preoccupations are reconciled through the parallelism which permeates much of Nabokov's work, in which the creative artist is seen as a type of the Divine, and in which God is understood as a creative artist. Formal religion, as well as intimations of a world beyond our everyday reality, figures importantly in Nabokov's art. And the unique understanding of the mystery of a deep surface, essential to the icons of Russian Orthodox Christianity, governs not just his imag- ery, but Nabokov's world - and otherworld - of art and life. Like the iconographer, Nabokov has made a Beautiful Gate into the mysterious realm of the sacred.
