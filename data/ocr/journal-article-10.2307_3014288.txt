[Read May 9th, 1865.] In a little work on the Origin of Language, published some years ago, I ventured to say that, whatever may be the other arguments for the unity of the human race, Philology, so far as it has yet proceeded, adds no contribution to the probability of such a belief. Expressing for the present no opinion upon those other arguments, or upon the general question, I will now endeavour to offer a few reason s for believing that Philology, considered alone, leads us to a distinct impression that the diver? sity of languages was primordial, and that the languages of the globe originated, like its plants and animals, at different geo? graphical centres. Now, first of all, it is a very significant fact, that the search for the primitive language has come to be regarded as a vagary, to be ranked with the attempts to discover the quadrature of the circle, or the prim,um mobile. Obviously, if all languages were derived from one, that one must have been the primitive lan? guage, and ought therefore, with our present philological know? ledge to be easily discoverable. Accordingly whole volumes have been written on the subject, and, among many languages, Low Dutch, Swedish, Basque, Irish, and Polynesian, have all been claimants for the honour of having been the language of Paradise. Hebrew, however, has been the most persistent candi- date, and nothing was easier than the proof of its pretensions, which indeed formed a sort of Procrustean bed out of which no linguistic heretic would escape with impunity. It was simply this : " All men descend from Adam and Eve; Adam and Eve spoke Hebrew; therefore Hebrew is the primitive language." Unhappily this little syllogism in biblical philology lost sight of the fact that the Hebrews were among the very few nations who had considered the problem of the diversity of tongues; and that in the passage which deals with the subject?a passage so pecu- liarly simple in its anthropomorphism, as to show that it was intended for allegorical and not for literal history?they attributed the fact to direct confusion, miraculously introduced into all human speech, Hebrew itself being made no exception. It would, how? ever, be an undeserved condescension to stop before a scientific assembly to refute a theory which was given up so far back as the</page><page sequence="2">F. W. Farrar?Language and Ethnology, 197 times of Grotius,* of Alexanderf- Natalis, nay even of DanteJ him- self, and which for years did as much harm to Philology as a per- sistence in the Ptolemaic hypothesis would have done to astronomy, and which found its natural support in such vast repertories of monstrous etymology as (for instance) the once celebrated Hebrew lexicon of Parkhurst. Suffice it to say, that so far from being the primitive language, Hebrew, in anything like its present condition, could not ever have been a primitive language at all; that it does not even belong to the first stage or floor of language ; that there are whole realms of languages to which it does not present the faintest analogy; and that "Hebrew, in its internal development, the poorest member of the least expensive class, is the most un- promising candidate which any one could set up for the honour of a universal progenitor." Noting it then as an important and significant fact that the very search for a primitive language has come to be regarded as a chimera, let us glance at the present condition of human languages, and what bearing it has on the great questions of Ethnology. Many eminent Ethnologists have been jealous of the encroachment of Philology on their domain; but it is surely clear that Philology and Ethnology ought to be sister studies, and that though they work separately, their conclusions should be combined. That there is one small family of languages, united by the closest affinities?Hebrew, Phcenician, Chaldee, Samaritan, Syriac, and Arabic?has always been recognised ; and to this family the faulty, and conventional but not inconvenient, name of Semitic has been given. It was left to this century, and to those eminent scholars of whom England may well be proud, to discover and to demonstrate the unity of the great Aryan family of languages. The discovery of Sanskrit brought to our notice a language coeval with if not anterior to the Hebrew, and, utterly distinct from it, a language which bound together into a glorious unity the dialects of Hindoostan and of Persia, with those European tongues of which some, like the Greek and Latin, shew the outgrowth of human intelligence in its richest and brightest bloom. So far then we have two families of language, and two only, the Semitic, consisting of some half dozen Syro-Arabian dialects, and the Aryan, embracing in its wide and noble circle eight im? portant historical families, Celtic, Teutonic, Lithuanian, Slavonic, Hellenic, Italic, Thracian, Armenian, and Iranian. So far we have only accounted for the languages of four peninsulas, India, Arabia, Asia Minor, and Europe.? To this we may perhaps add a * Grotius, Annott. in Gen., xi, 1. t Hist. Eccl., i, 298.

Farrar?Language and Ethnology. third northern group, whose affinities have been established by the labours of Klaproth, Schott, Castren, von de Gabelentz, and others, and which consists of five " quite respectable" families, viz., Tungusic, Mongolian, Turkic, Finnic, and Samoiedic. Tothis group has been assigned what we cannot but regard as the un- fortunate name Turanian. This name was, I believe, first used by M. Omalius d'Halloy, and by him applied to the actual Tartars of Touran; but, with a moclesty rare in the first proposer of a word, he has himself abandoned it, because of the wide extension of meaning it has received from other hands, and substituted for it (in his last edition of his Elemens d'Ethnographie) the name Alatyan, a name which the Tartars of Siberia apply to them? selves.* We know then of three linguistic families, Semitic, Aryan, and, to avoid the unlucky and indistinct term Turanian, let us say Alatyan. How small a distance then have we gone in classifying or separating into groups the some thousand living languages of the world?to say nothing of the innumerable languages that are dead?from that vast number displaced by the Romans in their conquests, to those of North America, of which not long ago a few aged parrots were the only surviving speakers ! What then are we to say respecting the languages of the Caucasus, Basque, Malay, Polynesian, North and South American, Chinese, African, Australian? They are all clearly non-Semitic, and clearly non-Aryan; what then must be done? Only the name Turanian remains ; why not extend it inordinately, open it wide, as Professor Pott-f* says, "as though it were a great convenient bag," and throw all remaining languages into it, putting Chinese, apolo- getically, at the bottom, as an inorganic structure, underlying all the rest. This is practically what has been done by Bunsen; and although Professor Max Muller]; is much more cautious in his language, and only speaks of Turanian as comprising " all lan? guages spoken in Asia or Europe, not included under the Aryan or Semitic, with the exception perhaps of Chinese and its dialects," yet he takes care to remind us that "the extension of the Turanian family to Africa and America has been hinted at by several scholars," and there runs through his writings a kind of tacit assumption that they are Turanian in character ; and even Chinese is vaguely connected with the same so-called family, although it is supposed to have been arrested at a "radical" stage.? * Omal. d'Halloy, " Elem. d'Ethnographie", p. 52. f Pott, " M.

Faeeae?Language and Ethnology. 199 Now if it were in any degree established that all non-Aryan and non-Semitic languages fall into one Turanian group, it would throw the great discovery of the Aryan unity completely into the shade. But I believe that the name Turanian, so applied, is only a dangerous chimera, and that if, after admitting the unity of the Semitie, Aryan, and Alatyan families, a third name is wanting to conceal our ignorance of any true principle of unity pervading, or supposed to pervade, the remaining languages ofthe world, we had much better adhere to the purely negative name Allophylian, suggested by Dr. Pritchard, a name which asserts nothing and assumes nothing, and which is therefore well-suited to express the purely negative fact that these languages are not known to be otherwise than sporadic in their character. A deep note of discontent has risen from many quarters at this unlimited extension of a term originally defective. Professor Pott,* perhaps the first of all living philologists, says that his whole scientific conscience revolts against the recognition of any real relationship between the members of this so-called family. Eenan,f the greatest philologist of France, looks upon it as in? tended to represent a mere ingenious hypothesis, rather than a demonstrated proposition. Maury, and Broca,J and, in America, Drs. Nott and Gliddon,? have all protested against it. "Touran," says Maury,|| "possesses no historical sense but that of non-Persian ethnologically, none but that of Turkestan geographically. It were as reasonable to divide Asiatic and European humanity into Semitie, British, and non-British, as to classify all these multi- form nations into Semitie, Aryan, and Turanian, when this last adjective suits, strictly speaking, no human group of families but the Turkish;" and he adds that to class under one omnific name the transplanted and now prodigiously intermixed descendants of various indigenous races, merely because agglutination happens to be their linguistic attribute, is an aberration from common sense, which naturally arose from Bunsen's unguarded language, but which Max Muller himself can never have intended. Yet Max Muller, creating for himself a modern mythos, talks of the wild descendants of Tur, and says that " through all periods of history, down to the present day, by far the largest share of the earth belongs. to Tur." But who, in the name of all that is wonderful, is Tur ? Who is this ancestor of Turks and Samoyedes, and perhaps even of Polynesians, Americans, and Malays ?

Farrar?Language and Ethnology. are nothing to him ; he is an ethnographic fable developed with astounding rapidity out of a vague expression. "Behold," says M. Broca, " a venerable personage, who was forgotten by Moses, and who now begins to seat himself by the sons of Noah! Who is this Tur, who has found no place in the tenth chapter of Genesis ? No doubt another Noah, perhaps another Adam, whom we are soon going to impose on the Chinese! Ought anthropologists to accord their hospitality to this fictitious personage ?" Professor Muller himself admits that these languages " do not descend from one common parent," and that " much still remains to be done before the mutual relations of all these branches can be considered as finally settled;" that the characteristic marks of union between them " are as yet very vague and general," and that " the very absence of that close family likeness, which holds the Aryan and Semitic languages together, seems to form a dis- tinguishing mark of these nomadic dialects." To this last sentence I call special attention, as emphatically proving how purely negative is the tie which binds together these languages in the "Turanian sandrope." Here are a number of languages which we may call, A, Semitic, B, Aryan, C, Alatyan, D, E,.X, Y, Z, not Aryan, and not Semitic; these languages are not A, ancl not B, and they have no close family likeness, which is one of the dis- tinguishing marks, that they are all of them C. But, it will be asked, has no attempt been made to prove a connexion between the members of the so-called Turanian family? Undoubtedly there has. It has been pointed out that one prin- ciple?agglutination?is common to them all. Now, be it observed that agglutination " consists in the mere juxtaposition of material and formal elements ;" and, as Professor Muller observes, it may well at first sight " seem so simple and purely mechanical as hardly to offer a distinctive attribute on which to establish a family of languages/' Now it must indeed be a wide term which is supposed by many scholars to apply equally well to the voluminous, holophrastic, polysynthetic lan? guages of America, in which a long sentence is treated as a single word "in a violent state of fusion and apocope;" and to the Turkish, in which, however long the compound, the root always remains intact. It must indeed be a wide term which embraces a language like the Athabascan language?Tlatskanai, which has interminable bizarre words like -xptschot-ltscit-ltsha and tlatlatlal- pistitcutli for such common things as " tongue" and " fagot," and also embraces Chinese, in which even a common plural like " trees" must be expressed by " tree, tree," and " us" by two monosylla- bles, "me, another." "Chinese," says Duponceau, "is the very opposite of the American languages; it is the poorest in words and grammatical forms, while these languages are the richest in</page><page sequence="6">F. W. Faeeae?Language and Ethnology. 201 both. These two kinds of languages stand, so far as their organis- ation is concerned, in direct contrast to one another?they form the two ends of a scale of human idiom." Yet we are to regard them as both, " perhaps," Turanian; both, though in different stages,* agglutinative ; and Japanese, with its specific numerals for men, for animals, for birds, for ships, for long objects, for flat objects, for hats, umbrellas, and parasols, for inanimate objects with four legs, for sealed letters, for patent letters,*J* etc, extending up to 100,000, has a family connexion with Australian and African languages, some of which have only two ordinals, and cannot get beyond three ! Surely, then, such a term as this can only describe some element common to many human languages, merely in virtue of their being human languages, and can hardly serve to esta? blish any real, much less any genealogical, connection between them. Even when taken in connection with the few " illusory homonyms" which have been urged, as yet only in the slightest and sketchiest manner, to point out any etymological identity of roots between one or two members of this so-called family, they no more prove a common origin than the general resemblance of structure in the mammalia proves that a horse, a whale, a cow, a lion, and a man, all spring from one common parentage.J But now, even if we admit most fully, instead of denying abso- lutely, that there is any real principle of unity between the non- Semitic and non-Aryan languages, will anybody, not shackled by some deeply-seated foregone conclusion, assert that anything even plausible has been offered in favour of even a possible common descent for Hebrew and Sanskrit, for Sanskrit and Chinese, for Chinese and Ojibbeway ? If a mere general grammatical resem? blance, coupled with a few coincidences of sound, the first due to the universal laws of thought, and the second partly to onomatopceia, and partly to the structure of the organs of speech, be insufficient to establish any connexion between the widely-spread Allophylian languages, how shall we establish any between those different families whose grammatical systems and radical sounds are funda- mentally and irreconcilably distinct ??whose dissimilarity, both in ideas, in structure, and in roots, is so obvious and profound ? For instance, if we compare any of the so-called Turanian lan? guages with Semitie or Aryan, we are at once struck with the shifting, evanescent, unstable character of the one, and the inex- tinguishable vitality of the others.

To this day the Aryan or Indo-European languages have the great majority of their roots in common, and their system of declensions, of conjugations, and of composition, is after thousands of years identical, so that both by etymology and by grammar their relationship is indisputably proved. Their numerical system, for instance, is everywhere the same. " In the long peregrination of tribes," says M. Benloew,? " from the foot of the Himalayas to the borders of the Mississippi, from 2,000 years before our era down to the present day, not one of these names has perished in any icliom/' Though they belong to a truly primordial antiquity, when the ancestors of Celts, and Saxons, and Eussians, and Norwegians, and Hindoos were still living under the roofs of the same huts, and though their origin is only known to a few scholars, they are all preserved as though they were fossil?preserved in the minutest particulars?even in the singular mutilation|| of the tens, even in the curious aphoeresis of the hundreds?altered indeed, but plainly recognisable?" the same in Sanskrit and in English, among the Ossetes and among the Germans, among the Gipseys and among the Sclaves." Eea- lise this single fact, and then ask whether languages so permanent, so undying, can be of a common parentage with those which are, as Professor Max Muller admits, shifting as the desert sands, which seem to have no single principle of stability or life, and in which, as for instance in the language of Tahiti, ^ve out of the ten numerals can be displaced and lost in less than a hundred years!

Farrar?Language and Ethnology. 203 by M. Chavee, in a very able and valuable pamphlet,* and what clo we find ? The radical difference, for instance, of their verbal system is summecl up by him in a few words. The primitive Aryan verb "never" has a metaphysical or metaphorical meaning, but expresses always a material iclea, an observable fact. It is originally monosyllabic, and consists generally of a consonant, followed by a vowel, i.e., it is an open syllable like Dd, " to give," or Std, " to establish." On the other hand, the elementary Semitic verb, when not triliteral, is always composed of two consonants of different organs, of which one very frequently doubles itself, i. e., it is a close syllable. Again, whereas in the Aryan vocabulary nine- tenths of the words are compound words or their derivatives, in Semitic languages, on the other hand, by the admission of all orientalists, there is not such a thing as a compound verb at all. Is it not, then, evident that the Semitic and Aryan systems are different worlds of conception, different worlds of expression? Their simple irreducible words, their syllabic constitution, have nothing in common, and the laws which preside over their earliest combinations are also absolutely different. What, then, is the only possible inference, if it be not that these languages are two vast spontaneous creations, the instinctive product of two different intellectual and artistic organisations ? In conclusion, let us look at Chinese. Between Chinese and the Semitic and Aryan systems there is, not a mere rift, but a broad, unfathomable, and never-bridged abyss. "Postremo Si- nenses," says Leibnitz,-}* in his letter to Ohamberlayne, " tamquam alterius orbis homines, et linguam habent et scripturam toto ccelo a nostris diversas," or, as M. Renan expresses it, Chinese differs from other languages as widely as though it belongecl to the in? habitants of another planet. It has not now, and it has not had for at least four thousand years, any principle of true grammar at all. It cannot even pronounce compound consonants by one emission of the voice, so that Christus in Chinese becomes Ki-li-su-tu-su, and Brahmah becomes Fan-lan-mo ; and among all its thirty-six consonants, it does not possess either b, or d, or r. It is absolutely flexionless ; it shews none, or next to none, of the otherwise in- variable linguistic process from synthesis to analysis; it is so curiously and intensely analytic, that it cannot even express the conception of virtue, except by such a mixture of words as Tsun hyan tsye i,?i. e., fidelity, reverence, temperance, uprightness ; or pleasure, except by phyan tu tshi tshwen,?i. e., luxury, play, food, clothes ! And yet we are to suppose that this language was identical in origin with the African, the Polynesian, the holo- phrastic American, the nearly unknown tongues of Dokos and Les Langues et les Races. Paris, 1862. t Opp., vi, 2.</page><page sequence="9">204 F. W. Fareae?Language and Ethnology. Andamaners, as well as with Hebrew, Greek, and French. If this be so?even in the astonishingly unorthodox term of years which the advocates of this theory are forced to demand to render it even conceivable?then Mr. Darwin's theory is nothing to it. I agree with Professor Pott,* that to suppose a development from Chinese to Greek is to suppose a miracle far more astounding than the growth of a silk worm into an elephant, or the sublim- ation of an infusorium into a man. The grammar of a language is its unalterable individuality ; it may be cultivated and polished, but it can no more alter its organisation than " a gardener can change an onion into a potatoe." A people under stress of con? quest may exchange its own language for another; but to believe, with the advocates of a primitive language, that any nation could or would of its own accord alter its own mother-speech into one radically different and etymologically new, and retaining no traces of its origin, is to believef a metamorphosis more strange than any in Ovid. A nation could not do it if it would, and would not if it could. The scriptural tradition which referred the diversity of language to a direct miracle shews a recognition of the fact. Unless we theorise in the teeth of observation, we are led to conclude that every language at its creation received one ineffaceable stamp. The monosyllabic, agglutinating, and inflec- tional languages were monosyllabic, agglutinating, and inflectional at a period as far back as the gaze of man can reach, even at the very dawn of human history and human tradition. These facts will speak for themselves. If the facts are incontrovertible, the conclusion is obvious. * Ubi supra, p. 414. t Du Ponceau, " Lenni Lenape Grammar", Eng. trans., p. 187.</page></plain_text>
