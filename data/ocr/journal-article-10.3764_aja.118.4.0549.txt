However, what is uniquely informative is the central  place afforded to what appear to have been more se- cretive rites focused on managing risks by diagnosing  present conditions and prognosticating futures. The  sequestering of technologies of divination within the  fortified citadel—itself the critical new technology of  Late Bronze Age sovereignty—suggests that esoteric  ritual practice was fundamental to the emergent South  Caucasian political tradition.29  the shrines at gegharot The three Gegharot shrines each consisted of a sin- gle room. Where the surrounding walls had survived,  they were rectilinear, constructed of worked granite  blocks or shaped bedrock. In the center of the upslope  wall of each shrine was a circular packed-clay basin  filled with ash and ceramic vessels. The spaces are thus  immediately recognizable as hosting broadly similar so- cial practices, even as each presents distinctive features. The West Terrace shrine, excavated in 2003, was the  largest and most architecturally complex of the three  shrines at Gegharot, yet it has the same basic layout  and features as the other two (fig. 3).30 The interior  space of the room was organized around a large, semi- circular, packed-clay basin situated toward the back of  the room and set atop a clay platform.

In addition to sharing analogous architectural orga- nizations, the shrines at Gegharot contained compa- rable material assemblages, indicating formalization,  if not standardization, of activities surrounding mys- tical practices. The hieratic nature of these spaces is  most demonstrably indicated by the presence of clay  idols, three of which were found in the West Terrace  shrine and two more of which were discovered in the  basin in the East Citadel shrine. Although not iden- tical, these sculpted clay figures share several formal  traits, including the presence of vaguely anthropo- morphic shapes and hornlike protrusions (fig. 8a, b).  The idols were found in close proximity to ceramic  forms that are most clearly linked to the combustion  of aromatic or other substances. Indeed, the burning  of substances—perhaps as an element of the trance,  or Platonic “madness,” often described as critical to  divination33—appears to have been an important ac- tivity associated with the shrines at Gegharot. It is in- dicated by the presence of both simple and elaborate  ceramic censers within or adjacent to the basins. The Fig. 7.

LEON [AJA 118 osteomancy (specifically, astragalomancy using knuck- lebones of quadrupeds), lithomancy (divination by  stones), and aleuromancy (divination with flour).  Evidence for osteomancy was found in all three  shrines, where caches of cattle and ovicaprid astragali  included “dice” that were polished, burned, and of- ten incised with regular patterns of linear striations  on one side. Bos (cattle) astragali are more numer- ous than ovicaprid (sheep/goat) astragali in all three  shrine contexts (table 1). The 97 total cattle astragali  represent at least 61 individual animals (minimum  number of individuals [MNI] calculated based on left  astragali), while the 62 total ovicaprid astragali repre- sent at least 31 animals (MNI calculated based on left  and right astragali). Ovicaprid astragali occur in per- fect symmetry across the whole site, with 31 left and 31  right astragali present, and this 1:1 left-to-right ratio  is roughly preserved in both the West Terrace shrine  (15, or 48.4%, left astragali to 16, or 51.6%, right  astragali) and East Citadel shrine (11, or 45.8%, left  astragali to 13, or 54.2%, right astragali). The West  Citadel shrine contained more left (5, or 71.4%) than  right (2, or 28.6%) ovicaprid astragali; however, the  small sample size in this shrine (only 7 total) may ac- count for this offset. Overall, there does not appear  to be a preference for curating left or right ovicaprid  astragali. There does, however, appear to be a pref- erence for left cattle astragali within each individual  shrine. In the West Terrace shrine, 48 cattle astragali  were recovered, 30 (62.5%) of which were from the  left side of the animal, while the remaining 18 (37.5%)  were from the right side. The East Citadel shrine con- tained 36 cattle astragali, with 23 (63.9%) left and 13  (36.1%) right. A similar propensity for left astragali  is found in the West Citadel shrine, where 8 out of 13  (61.5%) astragali were left astragali. In all three cases,  Fig. 8.
