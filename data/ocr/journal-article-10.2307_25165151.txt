RICHEY INTRODUCTION Anyone acquainted with traditional Chinese culture is familiar with the con ventional view of premodern Chinese attitudes toward law (fa &amp;).2 According to this view, ancient and medieval Chinese intellectuals regarded sagely rule by moral exemplars and their vertical influence as sufficient for good government, disdaining law as an instrument of power in itself or as a vehicle for the pro mulgation of morality. This attitude is enshrined in a passage from the Lunyu Ifrffi , or Confucian Analects: Direct them [the people] by laws, regulate them with punishments?the people will seek to avoid [punishments] and will be without shame. Direct them [the people] with moral force, regulate them with ritual?the people will possess shame, and moreover will be righteous.3 Nonetheless, it is clear that generations of Chinese scholar-officials who adopted this attitude made effective use of law even as they wrote about it in disapproving tones?"cloaking of the use of law within a rhetoric that dispar aged it as a social instrument," as William P. Alford has described what Ch'? Tsung-ts? memorably labeled "the Confucianization of legalism."4 This apparent ambivalence in the attitudes of traditional Chinese literati toward law represents a kind of fault line in premodern Chinese intellectual cul ture. It functions as a point of tension between some views of law, which have become dominant features of the visible intellectual landscape, and other views of law, which have been forced beneath the surface by various pressures, but can be discovered by tracing their force and impact above ground. What often is characterized as "the Chinese view of law" is but one among many ways of understanding law in early China. Early Chinese thinkers held remarkably var ied views of law?its origins in nature or culture, its relationship to the sacred, and its connection with sagehood. Whereas Confucian (Ru If ) texts such as the 2 The translation of fa as "law" will be discussed later in this essay. 3 Lunyu 2.3, which I suspect dates to the fourth century BCE.

(Mencius) tend to present law as an artificial and ineffective instrument for the promotion of moral order (i.e., the amoral product of mere culture), Mohist (Mojia I?M ) and Huang-Lao jt^ texts consistently view law as a natural and effective tool for the moral rectification of society when wielded by the sagely ruler (i.e., the outgrowth of a moral cosmos). Mohist and Huang-Lao texts differ, however, in their conceptions of the sacred and the nature of the cosmic order. This essay will explore these two non-Confucian accounts of law, their underlying views of the sacred and the cosmic order, and their legacies in later Chinese thought. First, however, what is meant by fa ("law") in early China must be clarified. Defining Fa ("Law") The most basic meaning of fa is "model" or "standard," and thus suggests an example for emulation or a principle for implementation.5 For this reason, most English translators render the term as "law." Although it is most famously asso ciated with the Fajia y?M ("Legalist") movement of the fourth through the sec ond centuries BCE, the term fa and its synonyms appear in a wide variety of early Chinese texts. Chapter 35 (Feiming I?qp , "Against Fatalism") of the Mozi ?? (c. fifth or fourth century BCE) identifies Tianzhi ^;? ("Heaven's Will") as the source of fa (juridical standards for human communities), while chapters 40-43 (Jing $? , "Canons") use fa to describe a general standard, such as using the mental idea or image of a circle to identify circles everywhere.6 Mengzi 4A1 (fourth century BCE) describes the fa of former kings (5fe?S) and proclaims that: As for one who followed the fa of the former kings and made mistakes?no such per son has ever existed! Lunyu 20.1, which may date to the third century BCE, attributes ze Ml) ("laws") to the legendary sage-ruler Yao % and describes how the introduction of such laws by the sage-rulers of antiquity brought peace to the world.7 In spite 5 On fa and its historical range of meanings, see Roger T. Ames, "Fa: Model, Law, Doctrine," in Antonio S. Cua, ed., Encyclopedia of Chinese Philosophy (New York and London: Routledge, 2003), 247-248. 6 These passages are discussed by A. C. Graham in his Disputers of the Tao: Philo sophical Argument in Ancient China (La Salle, IL: Open Court, 1989), 47-51, 148.

RICHEY of Marcel Granet's claim that "Chinese wisdom has no need of the idea of God," allusions to the ze of the ancient Chinese deities Shangdi ?S: ("The Lord on High") and Tian ^ ("Heaven") can be found in Zhou M poetry.8 Laozi ^i 69 (third century BCE) describes the harmonious fa ("modeling") of the cosmic order, in linked sequence from humanity to the Dao jl (Way): Humanity models itself on Earth, Earth models itself on Heaven, Heaven models itself on the Way, and the Way models itself on that which is so on its own.9 Finally, two other texts, the Guanzi If ? (third century BCE) and the Huai nanzi MWT (second century BCE), correlate fa with // S ("cosmic pattern") and ze, respectively.10 The Huainanzi also ascribes fa to Shangdi.11 Thus, there is abundant evidence in Warring States (481-221 BCE) and early Han 31 (206 BCE-8 CE) texts for understanding fa as a term meaning "law" in both juridical (applying to human communities, as in the laws of kings and states) and physical, even metaphysical (applying to the pattern of the cosmos, as in the laws of deities or the spontaneously-generated universe) senses of the word. Understanding fa in these broadly linked senses, however, does not fully address the question of how Mohist and Huang-Lao thinkers viewed fa. MOHIST THEORIES OF LAW Whoever the historical figure called Mozi may have been, the text known by his name appears to date from sometime between the death of Kongzi ?li (Confucius) in 479 BCE and the third century BCE.12 It stands out in the early Chinese corpus by virtue of its theistic conception of the sacred, its universal istic vision of moral community, and its rejection of Confucian flf (Confucian) standards of sagehood.13 Within the Mozi, discussions of fa arise in relation 8 Granet, La pens?e chinoise (Paris: A.

Clearly, the concept of Tian is central to the Mohist understanding of fa. What is Tian! Originally, Tian ("Sky" or "Heaven") was the name of the "high god" of the Zhou J3 people, who invaded territory previously held by the Shang ?5, the earliest historical polity verified by archaeology and paleography to date, around 1040 BCE. The conquering Zhou immediately identified the high god of the Shang royal house, Shangdi ("the Lord on High"), with Tian (much as the ancient Greeks and Romans identified Egyptian and West Asian deities with their own pantheons) and used this identification to make theological pro nouncements about the deity.14 This identification and redefinition of the high god represented "a clear elevation of Heaven or the high god to a central and transcendent position in the cosmos and in the ethical life of society."15 Regular public worship of Tian as a supreme god by the Zhou rulers carried on until the final and complete collapse of Zhou power in 249 BCE, and evidently was a component of Confucian piety throughout the Warring States.16 Thus, one may assume that these transcendent cosmological and moral qualities with which Tian was invested in the early Zhou period endured through the late Warring States, when the texts examined here seem to have originated. In the Mozi, Tian is moral, knowable, and predictable in its will (zhi M ) and laws (fa). The locus classicus of this Mohist claim about Tian can be found in chapter 26: How do I know that Heaven desires justice and hates injustice? In the world, where there is justice, there is life; where there is injustice, there is death . . . Where there is justice, there is order; where there is injustice, there is chaos. This claim contrasts strikingly with presentations of Tian in Confucian texts such as the Mengzi, in which "knowing Tian" (zhi Tian $o^ ) is equated with a fatalistic posture (liming ilnp).17 For the Mencian author, although Tian deter 14 See Benjamin I.

RICHEY mines matters as momentous as the duration of one's lifespan and the rise and fall of rulers, its will cannot be known; hence one must resign oneself to one's fate (ming np ) and strive to "serve Tian" (shi Tian S5^ ).18 As for success, that lies with Tian . .. Just do your best?that's all you can do!19 The Mohist author scoffs at such misdirected piety, because he knows that Tian is moral, knowable, and predictable in its will for the world, which is to impose a just social order on the model of a just cosmic order. Moreover, he regards the inscrutable Tian and concomitant fatalism of the Mencians as both absurd, because they claim that Tian is moral but absolve Tian from moral responsibility for punishment and reward, and dangerous, because (from the Mohist perspective) they offer no incentive for moral behavior to human beings.20 The Mohist account of law gains strength from its correlation with Tian. Because Mohists are certain that Tian is responsible for moral order in the world, they are confident that laws derived from Tian will perpetuate and safe guard that same moral order: When just persons are placed above the rest, the world necessarily will be ordered; the Lord on High, the mountains and rivers, and the ghosts and spirits necessarily will receive proper sacrifice; and the people will enjoy great benefit. . . . This is why the ancient sage kings issued statutes and promulgated laws. . . .21 From this and other passages, it becomes clear that the "epistemological opti mism" present in Mohist claims about the know ability of Tian's will has an elit ist edge, in spite of the egalitarian tone found throughout the Mozi.22 Tian, 18 Ibid. It must be acknowledged that, as a heterogeneous work, the Mengzi contains more than view of this and other issues, and thus, here I have singled out one view among others in the text. 19 Mengzi IB 14. 20 I am indebted to Erica F. Brindley, whose unpublished manuscript, "Universal Conform ity in Early Mohist Thought," helped to shape my understanding of these issues in the Mozi. 21 Mozi 35. 22 I owe this evocative phrase to Thomas Metzger's "Some Ancient Roots of Modern Chinese Thought: This-Worldliness, Epistemological Optimism, Doctrinality and the Emer gence of Reflexivity in the Eastern Chou," Early China 11-12 (1987): 61-117.</page><page sequence="7">LOST AND FOUND THEORIES OF LAW IN EARLY CHINA 335 although moral and powerful, relies upon just persons (yiren HA)?examples of which may be located in the past, in the form of sage-kings (shengwang Ii)? in positions of power in order to execute its will and thus transform an unjust world into a just one. This feat may be accomplished, according to the Mozi, by "taking the clearest standard [fa] in the world" (W^Ti.W? )?the will of Tian?as the basis of one's sagely rule.23 Thus, an understanding of Mohist theories of law is impossible without a grasp of the interdependence between Tian, moral order, and the sage-king in Mohist thought. For the Mohists, Tian functions as what Josef Fuchs calls an "ethical absolutum."24 The knowability of Tian as a natural force for moral order in the universe translates into the practicability of fa and the efficacy of the sage-king for imposing and maintaining that order. Unlike Confucian dis cussions of the relationship between fa and de H (magical-moral power)25?as in Lunyu 2.3, quoted earlier?in the Mozi one finds no conflict between rule by law and rule by moral force, because both law and moral goodness proceed from the same transcendent, natural source (Tian) and are combined in the ideal ruler (shengwang). Obviously, the Mohist natural law theory represents an alter native to the Confucian account of law often seen as dominant in early China. To what extent is the Mohist vision shared by the Huang-Lao tradition, and in what ways do they differ? Huang-Lao Theories of Law It is dangerous to utter the phrase "Huang-Lao" in the presence of early China specialists, as the character and the coherence of this movement are the subject of much Sinological debate.26 For the purposes of this essay, the third 23 Mozi 26. 24 See Fuchs, Moral Demands and Personal Obligations, trans. Brian McNeil (Washing ton, DC: Georgetown University Press, 1993), 15-17. 25 The translation of the term de is notoriously controversial. Its appearances in Eastern Zhou (ca. 771-600 BCE) texts suggest both magical power and moral force, and later appear ances in Warring States texts simply perpetuate such nuance. Therefore, I prefer to empha size its dual, possibly integrated or related, meanings by rendering it as "magical-moral power." For discussions of this perennial Sinological challenge, see Peter A. Boodberg, "The Semasiology of Some Primary Confucian Concepts," in Selected Works of Peter A. Boodberg, ed. Alvin P. Cohen (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979), 32, and David S.

RICHEY century BCE27 text known as the Jingfa ?S ("Normative Standards")28 will be taken as representative of this early Chinese school of thought, which appears to have flourished in multiple forms between the fourth century BCE and the reign of Han Wudi ?BES (140-87 BCE). The Jingfa is concerned with the cos mic origins of fa and its relationship to the sage (shengren WX ), but differs from the Mozi in that it roots fa in Dao rather than Tian. What is the sig nificance of this difference? To answer this question, one must first clarify the meanings associated with the term Dao. Prior to the Warring States (475-221 BCE), Dao in its nominal sense originally meant nothing more than "road," "way," or "method."29 By the late Warring States, the meaning of Dao had expanded to the point that it could be interpreted narrowly as the distinct "path" intended for a person by virtue of attainment or profession, or which could be construed broadly as the course, creative intention, or purpose of the entire cosmos.30 Hence, its frequent trans lation into English as "the Way."31 Although infused with metaphysical content, Dao does not seem to carry any theistic baggage, in the sense of suggesting a Mohist Tian with a human-like personality or will. In striking contrast with the Mozi, the Jingfa appears to use Tian, Dao, and Tianzhi Dao ^?.il (the Way of Heaven) interchangeably as cognate terms. Here, Tian seems to have been drained of its personal, theistic 27 More than thirty years of scholarship on this text has failed to produce a scholarly con sensus regarding its precise date. The text was discovered in 1972 at Mawangdui M?ti?., Hunan f?f?, in a tomb dated to 168 BCE, but may be a copy of a much earlier original.

Chapter 1 identifies Dao as the ultimate source of being and intellect as well as law (fa): The Way gives birth to law.. .. [The Way] is that which gives birth to all things.. . . The Way is the source of divine intellect [shenming #B?].32 For the Jingfa author, Dao provides the sagely ruler with a cosmic model (fa) for numerically reproducing its "formlessness" (weixu nti?) and "non-being" (wuyou ?&amp;W), thereby enabling him to "rectify the world" (S^TIE).33 Harmonizing the affairs of the state with the patterns and processes of the cosmos is said to bring about order in the political realm: Heaven and Earth have their constant patterns, the people have their constant affairs, superior and inferior have their constant positions, and [the ruler] has his constant Way of overseeing officials and putting the people to some use.34 Outer and inner [affairs of state] both being in order?this is called "being in accord with Heaven."35 The order derived from DaolTian is not so much moral as it is aesthetic, however.36 Here, there is no explicit link between order and justice ( yi ?), as 32 Jingfa 1.1, 1.2, 1.9. The translation of shenming is difficult, in part because of the mul tivalence of the term shen ft in early China. According to chapter 47 of the Liji ?tiB (an admittedly late work, dating to the later Han era), shen is that part of the human spirit (gui %, described as having two components by many early Chinese sources) that corresponds to the celestial realm and thus enjoys divine status after death, having been separated from the po ?&amp; or earthly spiritual component, which remains underground with the corpse. For this reason, Poo Mu-chou argues that "there is little difference between the nature of gods (shen) and ghosts (kuei [gui]). . . . Thus, the word [shen] is sometimes better rendered as 'spirit' rather than 'god'. . . . Shen and kuei are interchangeable terms."

Ames, "The Common</page><page sequence="10">338 JEFFREY L. RICHEY in the Mozi. In the Jingfa, order qua order is constant (heng H) or consistent harmonious relations within a hierarchical system. While the Jingfa rarely invokes the term xing tt (conventionally translated as "nature"),37 it correlates the "constant law" (US) (1.10) of the sagely ruler "who has grasped [Dao]" (0SSl#) (1.11) with the activity of "Heaven [Tian] and Earth [which] have their constant patterns" (^JftWE?) (1.10): The Way of one who rules the world has three elements: Heaven, humanity, and Earth. Use these three together and one will possess the world.38 If, as the Jingfa claims, law exists from beginningless time, grounded in the transcendent absolute, seamlessly correlated with nature, and brought to com pletion in human activity, does it follow that all human beings have equal access to this source of law? Just as in the case of the Mozi, the answer to this question is negative and helps explain the significance of the sage (shengren WX) in early Chinese thought. The Jingfa emphatically rejects egalitarian notions of universal human access to the transcendent natural law. Instead, the text establishes a hierarchy of human value, in which altruism, wisdom, and achievement are correlated posi tively with one another: Those who are public-minded are wise, and those who excel in wisdom achieve the most. Those who excel in correctness are tranquil, and those who excel in tranquility are sages.39 What is more, the function of the sage is explicitly political: Heaven and Earth are selfless; the four seasons are endless. When Heaven and Earth are established, the sage then comes to rule.40 Ground of Self-Cultivation in Classical Taoism and Confucianism," Taoist Resources 1/1 (Autumn 1988): 28. 37 On the translation of xing, see Roger T.

This is called the achievement of Heaven.41 The sage's presence coincides with the foundation of the cosmos; his reign parallels Heaven and Earth in its selfless concern for the common good and its cyclical continuity; and for these reasons, he is a unique figure: the ideological fulfillment of the natural order. In this sense, the correlation of the cosmic to the human is limited to one human exemplar?the sage?rather than applying the human species as a whole. As in Plato's imaginary Republic, so also in the vision of sagely rule adumbrated in the Jingfa.42 The Jingfa bolsters its endorse ments of sagely rule by explaining that, although the transcendent natural law embodied and executed by the wise is immanent in humanity, not all human beings pursue the path of sagehood, and thus the enforcement of laws through coercion is necessary: By birth, one possesses faults, called desires and insatiability.43 Thus, sage-rulers are necessary, because human beings necessarily deviate from the straight path to goodness and wisdom?a path that also happens to lead to power over the mass of one's fellow human beings. Therefore, sages func tion as guarantors that group-spiritedness will prevail over self-determination. Legacies of Mohism and Huang-Lao Natural law is . . . [a] concept. . . that is nearly worldwide in its distribution. .. and that has a continuous history from ancient to modern times. The idea that recurrent human behaviors and beliefs are part of some natural or divinely created order is found, in one guise or another, in just about every human society.44 In Chinese political theory natural law aimed to preserve social and natural order by delineating the ruler's duties; in the West it ideally safeguarded the natural rights of individuals against arbitrary interference from above. But we do find in both early tra ditions the argument that the exercise of authority was justified by how closely it adhered to principles of natural law and that the laws of the state should not be sepa rated from higher principles.45 41 Jingfa 2.6. 42 See Plato, Republic 7.473d. 43 Jingfa 1.3. 44 William Y.

RICHEY In their shared view of human law as naturally given, expressive of cosmic order, transcendently endowed, and effective as a means of promoting sagely rule, the Mohist and Huang-Lao traditions present the most fully developed ac counts of "natural law" in early China.46 Moreover, these accounts both conform to and deviate from what have become normative expectations of early Chinese thought, as well as correspond to and diverge from one another. Both the Mozi and the Jingfa posit the "naturalness" of law while asserting the unique role of human beings in promulgating it as part of an orderly regime. By doing so, they demonstrate features of what David E. Aune has identified as characteristics of Hellenistic thought in the West: "anthropocentricity" (the cosmological centrality of humans and the human realm, Earth) and "intercon nectedness" (the unitary linkage between all things within the cosmos).47 At the same time, the texts embody the classical Chinese assumption. .. that personal, societal, political, and natural orders are immanental, coterminous, and mutually entailing. Thus, to the extent we understand order in any one aspect of the human experience, we have a direct insight into other areas of experience as well.48 The rise of anthropocentric, interconnective, and correlative themes in early Chinese thought may correspond to what Mircea Eliade calls a certain stage of culture [at which] man conceives of himself as a microcosm. He forms part of the gods' creation; in other words, he finds in himself the same sanctity that he recognizes in the cosmos. It follows that his life is homologized to cosmic life; as a divine work, the cosmos becomes the paradigmatic image of human existence.. . . It is not merely human, it is at the same time cosmic, since it has a transhuman structure. It could be termed an open existence, for it is not strictly confined to man's mode of being.. .. Openness to the world enables religious man to know himself in knowing the world?and this knowledge is precious to him because it is religious, because it pertains to being.49 This "homologization" of the human to the cosmic is characteristic of both the Mozi and the Jingfa.

Homology establishes a tight conceptual link between law and the cosmic order. It should come as no surprise, of course, to learn that the Mozi and the Jingfa espouse what certainly seem to be elitist sentiments. Not only these texts, but the majority of other early Chinese political writings concentrate solely on king ship (or emperorship) as the model for government par excellence. Most early Chinese thinkers are sophocrats, for whom the ideal king is the sage-king: [T]he Chinese from the beginnings of their history assumed that the ideal order rested on a large-scale inclusive system that unified all people under one ruler. And because kingship was always considered the best means to order the world in China, political theorists refined their thinking about the qualities of a good king to a degree not matched in the West until the early Middle Ages, when kingship became accepted as the normal form of governing.50 Although the Mohists, the Huang-Laoists, and the Confucians assume that sages are necessary for the moral and social rectification of the human com munity, they disagree about the relationship between law and the sacred as well as about the efficacy of law as an instrument of sagely rule. However, the difference in the conceptualization of the sacred source of order that occurs between the Mozi and the Jingfa must not be overlooked. In the Mozi, one encounters the sacred as Tian, a moral being distinguished by its will (zhi ?&amp; ), which can be known and fulfilled by sagely human agents. In the Jingfa, both Dao and Tian signify the impersonal, extrahuman power of the cos mic order, adopting the noumenal aura of sacred terms without importing per sonalized or anthropomorphic conceptual content. Here, Michael J. Puett's argu ment that the depersonalization of the divine represents a late doctrinal development in early China comes to mind.51 This conceptual transition?from personal the ism to impersonal pantheism?may be compared with the shift from regarding the sacred as a capricious being with an unpredictable will (Zeus, Athena, et al.) to seeing it as a knowable, predictable, moral force for cosmic order (the Stoic Logos ?oyo?) in ancient Greece.52 Thus, the Mohist Tian and the Huang-Laoist Dao are alike insofar as they are knowable, predictable, and moral; the Dao of the Jingfa merely lacks the will that distinguishes the Mozi's Tian. Is this an important distinction? 50 See Karen Turner, "Sage kings and laws in the Chinese and Greek traditions," in Heritage of China: Contemporary Perspectives on Chinese Civilization, ed. Paul Ropp (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990), 108. 51 See his To Become a God: Cosmology, Sacrifice, and Self-Divinization in Early China (Cambridge, MA, and London: Harvard University Asia Center, 2002), 21-23 and passim. 52 On the shift from personalized deities to pantheism in Greek thought, see E. R. Dodds, The Greeks and The Irrational (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951), 240-243.</page><page sequence="14">342 JEFFREY L. RICHEY Regarding the Huang-Laoist conception of Dao, Karen Turner has noted that such an entity "serves as a valuable standard precisely because it is . . . free of the fickle personality traits of an anthropomorphic deity."53 The force offa increases with the depersonalization of the sacred from which it emanates, and an imper sonal sacred relieves human beings from the intellectual burden of theodicy. Like the Biblical God, the Mohists' Tian could be defended from human criti cism only by accusing its critics of "sin by charging God with wrongdoing."54 The Huang-Laoists' Dao has no will to be interpreted; the entire cosmos is imbued with its regulating pattern, and given its vast scope, only the sage can claim to understand it, thus further insulating its moral dictates from human scrutiny and criticism. At best, it seems that Granet was partially right about Chinese wisdom's lack of "need of the idea of God"; had he specified "Confucian," rather than "Chinese," he would have been closer to the truth. Confucian thinkers so suc cessfully marginalized the Mohist and Huang-Lao traditions that their brands of theism are altogether absent from many standard treatments of early Chinese thought.55 Nonetheless, the legacies of this "unnecessary" idea are evident in later Chinese, even Confucian, thought. For example, one need only consider the case of a later Confucian figure such as Dong Zhongshu Hft fF (c. 195-105 BCE). Dong appears to combine the Confucian interest in sagely rule by virtue with the Mohist and Huang-Laoist correlation of social norms with a sacred cosmic order and positioning the sage as the wielder and guarantor of those norms. Moreover, Dong's impersonal, pantheistic Tian seems closer to the Jingfa's Dao than to the personal, theistic Tian of the Mozi, not to mention that of the Lunyu and the Mengzi: The norms [fa] of the people are derived from and modeled on Heaven.. .. For this reason Heaven clings to the Way and acts as the master of all living things. The ruler maintains constant norms and acts as the master of a single state.56 53 Turner, 102. 54 Job 1:22 (New International Version). 55 See Graham, Disputer s of the Tao, 222; Joseph Needham, "Human Laws and the Laws of Nature in China and the West (I)," Journal of the History of Ideas 12/1 (January 1951): 3-30; Nathan Sivin, Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in Ancient China: Researches and Reflections (Brookfield, VT: Variorum, 1995), 3; Chad Hansen, A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought: A Philosophical Interpretation (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992), 215; and N.

Just as fragments of the European lithospheric plate may be found in south eastern Staten Island, long after the separation imposed by plate tectonics, one may look for traces of long-dead views deep within the strata of Chinese intel lectual history.60 In this sense, such views are almost never lost. They merely await discovery. They are not dead, but live on. 57 See Jerry H.
