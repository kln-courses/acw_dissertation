Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1990. xxii+ 122 pp. The idea that the Bible is a form of imaginative literature, not just a vehicle of theology or a repository of history, is an ancient one, and it has been promoted as effectively by poets over the ages as by literary critics. In its recent manifestations, the 'literary hypothesis,' as it might be called, still derives some of its impetus from the Romantic example of William Blake, who proclaimed in his first published work that 'the Jewish and Christian Testaments are An original derivation from the Poetic Genius.' Northrop Frye's The Great Code: The Bible and Literature (1981) takes its title as well as its ingenious systematics of biblical myth from Blake. The two books under review here are likewise informed by Blake's poetic wrestling with Scripture. Bloom several times reiterates Blake's aphorism that religious people are simply 'choosing forms of worship from poetic tales,' and both he and Brisman are concerned with the imaginative 'sublime of the Bible,' as Blake called it, rather than its narrative structures, rhetorical techniques or literary genres. Subscribing to the venerable Documentary Hypothesis of historical scholarship, an approach often scorned in recent literary criticism of the Bible, The Book of J and The Voice of Jacob subject the beginning of the Hebrew Bible to ironic reconstructions, brilliant and unsettling. Their literary revisions recall Blake's prophetic assault on religious orthodoxy in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Where Blake's antagonist was the Christianity—Deist and Calvinist as well as Anglican—of late eighteenth-century England, Bloom, Rosenberg and Brisman take aim at the 'normative Judaism,' as Bloom calls it, of the late twentieth century United States. They impose the Documentary Hypothesis, developed by German Protestantism and widely accepted, to one degree or another, in Catholic and Protestant notions of the Pentateuch, on the Torah of Judaism, which has been less hospitable to historical analysis of what it has traditionally regarded as the most sacred and meaningful part of the biblical canon. But the bold speculation of both these books, in which Bloom 'imagines' that the author of the Yahwist or J source was a disaffected woman of the royal family in the kingdoms of Solomon and Rehoboam, and in which Brisman conflates the Elohist and Priestly sources into an earlier 'Eisaccic' author, whom a later J or 'Jacobic' author struggles against, is as likely to scandalize orthodox historical scholars as it is to offend observant Jews. Oxford University Press 1992</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 87 Readers with other scholarly investments and other religious commitments will find much that is provocative in both books, but much that is stimulating as well. Bloom's thesis is simple: concealed within the pious, ethical and religious text of Torah is an irreverent literary masterpiece whose imaginative energies have been repressed by later biblical writers, by editors and by commentators, Christian as well as Jewish. Nevertheless, Bloom argues, it is the power and originality of this occluded masterpiece which accounts for the Bible's astonishing influence on later culture, literary and otherwise. 'The Book of J,' long identified by the Higher Criticism as the Yahwist source of a composite Pentateuch, celebrates the strength or 'heroic vitalism' of the patriarchs—and matriarchs—of Israel, even as it evokes, at an ironic distance, a God who is 'uncanny' and 'impish.' The Yahweh whom J presents is a 'lively fellow, dynamic in the extreme' (31), a being the author regards as personal and real but not as someone to be feared, revered or trusted, even though as God he is profoundly 'incommensurate' with the human creatures he has made. Instead of calling the God of J 'anthropomorphic,' as traditional historical critics have done, Bloom prefers to call the human characters of her text 'theomorphic.' It is the godlike qualities of Abram (not yet Abraham in J), Jacob and Joseph and the even more lively and tough-minded characteristics of Eve, Sarai, Rachel, Rebecca, and Tamar in J's share of Genesis that Bloom is particularly concerned to bring out, rather than the all-too-human qualities, as he regards them, of Yahweh. In Bloom's view, it was the heroic figure of David, J's immediate ancestor, that J was commemorating in her telling, or retelling, of the stories of Israel's earliest heroes and heroines. Her aristocratic sensibility, 'élitist' and 'individualist,' as Bloom describes it, was much less impressed with the embattled leadership of Moses and was positively offended by the multitude or masses of Israel, characters who come on the scene in J's contributions to the first half of Exodus, selected chapters of Numbers and a few verses of Deuteronomy. In these later figures J dramatizes her disillusionment with Solomon and the first kings, Jeroboam and Rehoboam, of the Divided Monarchy in which she wrote. This is a reductive synopsis of a tendentious argument, an argument Bloom offers with a hyperbolic irony reminiscent of Nietzsche as well as Blake. But the critical wit and rhetorical force of the case Bloom makes solicit the reader's willing suspension of disbelief for the moment that Coleridge called 'poetic faith'. One need not accept as dogmatic doctrine or objective truth what Bloom cheerfully acknowledges is his own 'surmise' about J's separate authorial identity and inten tions, but one can gain from his numerous interpretive insights a much deeper appreciation of the undeniable ironies of the biblical characterization of Yahweh and his favourites, the dynamic shifts of attitude and mood within their personalities and the ironic contrasts between their actions as the episodic stories unfold. One also gains from Bloom's commentary a new awareness of the integrity and resource fulness of the women in this supposedly arch-patriarchal narrative; feminists have much to mull over in Bloom's surprising evocation of J's matriarchal art. Finally, literary readers will find in the numerous comparisons of the biblical author 'J' to Kafka, Thomas Mann, Tolstoy, and above all to Shakespeare, a provocative recon</page><page sequence="3">88 BOOK REVIEWS struction of the much-contested literary canon of the West, a brave new literary world Bloom now envisions after his long preoccupation with Milton and that poet's tormented Romantic posterity in his previous works of criticism. David Rosenberg's translation in The Book of J deserves a whole review to itself, but limitations of space and lack of Hebrew confine me to a few observations from the side of biblical and literary English. The ironic and jarring effects of what Rosenberg claims as a faithful reproduction of the pervasive word-play of the Hebrew text unfortunately work against the 'sublime' narrative that Bloom tries to establish in his commentary. There is something inevitably smart-aleck and parodie about an English translation of the Bible (or part of the Bible) that turns its back as resolutely on the idioms and rhythms of the Authorized Version as Rosenberg's does. But Rosenberg heightens this sense of the ridiculous by peculiar diction ('the earthling,' 'cleansed from your vow,' 'jaywalk,' 'tattletale') which mixes the archaic and the contemporary, by awkward English constructions ('I knew I was smooth-skinned,' 'The days turned into the past,' 'I have been hurt on behalf of you') which sound as though they came from a non-native speaker of the language, and by puns of flatfooted insistence rather than nimble indirection. (Lot speaks of 'my chosen lot' and is told by the angel 'I pity your lot'; Ishmael is named because 'Yahweh heard your punishment: you will hear a male'; 'Don't turn to returning,' Abram tells his servant.) Rosenberg is an experienced literary trans lator of biblical Hebrew and these solecisms appear to be deliberate, but the Modernist alienation of the language he gives to J, to give it a charitable interpreta tion, is mismatched with Bloom's Romantic vision of her hero-worship. It is as if a commentary by Thomas Carlyle were furnished with a text by Gertrude Stein. Brisman's reading of the whole of Genesis as a struggle between two authors steers a brilliant middle course between Bloom's claims for sublime originality and Rosenberg's insistence on impertinent modernity. Less sensational than The Book of J and aimed at a scholarly readership rather than the general audience already engaged by Bloom's immediate bestseller, The Voice of Jacob is a more convincing, more closely reasoned, and more insightful literary shifting of much the same biblical terrain. Without explicit mention of Bloom, his colleague at Yale, Brisman adapts Bloom's earlier theory of an 'anxiety of influence,' a creative agon in which poetic sons attempt to outdo their literary fathers, to a remarkably subtle reading of the interaction of J and the other documentary sources in Genesis. In a seriously playful fashion, Brisman uses the story of the younger Jacob stealing the blessing from the older Esau as an alternative, fraternal model of conflict; he describes a normatively religious 'Eisaacic' author who has already had his say and a rebelliously humanistic 'Jacobic' author who keeps getting his own word in edgewise. In the terms of Jewish canons of interpretation, Brisman reads the text of J as midrash, sustained and discontinuous, on the rest of Genesis, not a 'book' but a 'haggadah within Scripture,' in a phrase Brisman takes (and considerably expands) from Samuel Sandmel. The subtly evocative word-play of Brisman himself, which conjures up Freudian analysis and the major poets of English literature as well as the Hebrew word-play of the Bible itself, does not make for quick comprehension and will undoubtedly tax some readers' patience. And his personalizing of the J</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 89 text as 'the voice of Jacob,' while less blatant than Bloom's hypothetical Jewish princess, may strike literary critics persuaded by poststructuralists of the 'death of the author' as a retrograde notion. Nevertheless, there is a lucidity and a penetration in Brisman's close reading of episode after episode in Genesis which rewards the reader who surrenders the reins of his critical imagination to Brisman's interpretive virtuosity. Brisman's challenge to normative piety is subtler than Bloom's, but it is also less easily dismissed as an imposition on the text. If Bloom reminds one of Blake in the 'terrific numbers' of his prophetic books, full of authoritative assertion, Brisman recalls Blake's 'mild and gentle parts,' as he called them, in which he insinuates poetic vision into biblical text instead of denouncing biblical errors. After the normative Angel has shown the irreverent antagonist of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell his place of eternal punishment, full of fire and monsters, the speaker reports: 'I remain'd alone, &amp; then this appearance was no more, but I found myself sitting on a pleasant bank beside a river by moon light hearing a harper who sung to his harp. &amp; his theme was, The man who never alters his opinion is like standing water, &amp; breeds reptiles of the mind.' Brisman and Bloom extend Blake's Romantic project of renewing biblical vision through literary revision; there is more than a touch of the poet in both these critics. But they do the dialogue of God and his people in rather different voices. WALTER L. REED Emory University</page></plain_text>
