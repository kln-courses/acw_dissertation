<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ARTICLE PARADISE LOST "INTRODUCED" AND "STRUCTURED IN SPACE" AMONG the most recent products of the resurgence of critical interest in Milton are two new studies of Paradise Lost by Professors Summers1 and Cope.2 They share many of the same concerns: to indicate the availability of Paradise Lost to the methods of close textual analysis, to illuminate the aesthetic structure and texture of the poem, to reveal the complexity and "modernity" of Milton's attitudes. They also share the con- viction that the key to the structure and meaning of the poem is, in Summers' words, its "creation of movements in a world of space and time." Yet the two studies diverge sharply in method and approach, each representing a significant trend in contemporary Milton criticism. Summers' book places itself by title among the numerous "introductions" to Milton which sometimes seem, like Satan's fallen legions, to be strewn thick as autumnal leaves over the sea of Milton studies. Though one may perhaps lament the kind, wondering how often Milton has to be "introduced" to the general reader before a nodding acquaintance might reasonably be assumed, this introduction offers very much more than might have been expected. The author meets his responsibility to the general reader by deftly and systemati- cally guiding him to the central problems of the poem and by alluding to much of the significant critical literature regarding it; unfortunately the absence of footnotes (in deference perhaps to the general reader's supposed preference for an unencumbered text) will make it difficult for that reader to follow up any scholarly interests he might develop. Summers adopts an unembarrassed traditional approach, wisely eschewing the temptation to translate the poem into the modern idiom and endeavoring rather to clear away some of the obstacles to an understanding of the poem in its own terms. And in addition to these services the study offers an unexpected bonus to the scholar in the form of several exciting suggestions about the poem, often cogently and persuasively argued. Throughout his book Summers confronts effectively the stereotypes and the wandering fires which are likely to mislead the inexpe- rienced. He meets the deterrent of Milton's massive learning by the arresting if perhaps exaggerated claim that Paradise Lost can more adequately be read in isolation than any other major non-dramatic poem, since it is "big enough almost to create its own world" (p. 18) and can teach the reader as he goes along what he needs to know to read it. He lays the ghost of the "organ voice" by demon- strating the variety, frequent asperity, and constant frustration of expectation in Milton's verse. He prepares the reader to encounter Miltonic complexity in several ways. In the first place, by relating the "Muse's method" to the anthropomorphism of the Bible he points up the ambiguities introduced by Milton's conviction that the divine reality is imaged in the Bible (and so in the poem) not as it is but only as human beings can perceive it. He points to the multiple and shifting per- spectives which control the poem, and the attendant fusion of modes: a given action such as the war in heaven is thus seen as comic from God's perspective, as tragic from that of the rebel angels, and as heroic from that of God's loyal forces, while the reader must experience all modes at once, sitting in judg- ment upon, and gradually correcting, his guilty sympathies and faulty understandings. Most timely of all, perhaps, is his caveat against simplistic archetypal reading of 1 The Muse's Method: An Introduction to "Paradise Lost." By Joseph Summers.

Even the usually reliable light and dark are treated with the utmost complexity: physical and spiritual light and dark may have a paradoxical relationship .... And the complexity of the imagery is directly related to the complexity of the judgments we are asked to make. Milton, in some respects the most moral of English poets, is the despair of conventional moralists, for he refuses to establish abstract categories, classical, medieval, Renaissance, or Puritan, of virtues and vices, of human qualities which are always good or evil, which can always clearly identify our heroes and villains . . . Every emotion except the pure love of God can be corrupted, and almost every one except the desire to be totally self-sufficient can be ennobled and made divine. Parodies and distortions of most of the theological and cardinal virtues can be found in Hell ....Similarly, the emotions which, in another context, might be the essence of most of the Seven Deadly Sins are apparent in Heaven, in man and woman in Paradise, and in the poet writing the poem [pp. 28-29]. Among those aspects of the work which address the literary scholar as well as the general reader, perhaps the most interesting is the chapter entitled "Grateful Vicissitude," deriving from an earlier PMLA article. Summers sees this Miltonic phrase (VI, 8) as central to Milton's aesthetics and to his thought-indicating the change, variety, pleni- tude, motion, constant growth, patterned multiplicity which both God and Milton appear to regard as the chief good in the created universe. This principle of multiplicity within harmony Summers shows by an illu- minating poetic analysis to constitute the theme of the morning hymn of Adam and Eve (V, 153-208) and also to dictate its form. He points, moreover, to Milton's description of the whirling dance of angels and planets (V, 618-27) in "mazes intricate / Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular / Then most, when most irregular they seem" as providing "the appropriate image for what Milton saw as most glorious in the ways of God as well as for what he intended and achieved within his own poem" (p. 85). In such a universe human freedom and even the Fall are merely variations within the total provi- dential harmony. There are other illuminating commentaries on particular points. Summers analyses perceptively the "serious mock-heroic" quality in the encounter between Satan, Sin and Death, pointing to Satan's sudden reduction from heroic monarch to a man with domestic entanglements, to Sin's adoption of the incongruously noble tone of a forsaken Dido or a raped Sabine standing between Father and Son-Husband; and to the obvious bathos in Sin's parody of Christ: "Where I shall Reign / At thy right hand voluptuous" (II, 868-69). He offers an impressive answer to the strictures of Addison and Johnson by suggesting the vital connection between the "real" and "allegorical" characters in the poem, in that the "real" characters through sin pervert and deny their proper being and so progress toward the pole of Non-Being occupied by the prototypical allegorical figures. He suggests, persuasively, that Milton recast his poem into twelve books in order to shift the center from the heroism of Abdiel to the War in Heaven and the Creation, realizing that for his poem "the true centre was not the angelic exemplum of man's ways at their most heroic, but the divine image of God's ways at their most providential" (p. 113). Finally, his long, analytic treatment of the last two books points up the skilful interweaving of horror and consolation as well as the subtle treatment of Adam's advance in spiritual wisdom. The book manifests some of the weaknesses of an "introduction." At times it seems to belabor the obvious. At times it treats con- troversial issues too superficially: for example, Summers warns against "distorting Milton's details into our own mythic meanings" by reading Eve's apparent narcissism as evidence of natural depravity or of an already fallen condition, but present confusions on this issue being what they are, truth cannot merely be stated but must be argued and demonstrated. Such almost inevitable simplifications aside, however, this intelligent and balanced intro- duction must prove a boon for students as well as a source of pleasure and profit to specialists. In contrast, Professor Cope is decidedly</page><page sequence="3">124 BARBARA KIEFER LEWALSKI untraditional in method. Bypassing many of the standard critical questions about the poem as well as what he considers the now out- moded, time-oriented, psychologically based New Critical approach, he addresses the poem through a spatially oriented, metaphoric, "newer" criticism. His lengthy, argumentative footnotes and elliptical style indicate that his book is written primarily for Miltonists. Here, the significant terms for analyzing Paradise Lost are "myth," "metaphor," and "space." "Myth" Cope defines somewhat obscurely as "man's practice of becoming the symbol of his own spiritual experience through projection of inner states into certain recurring narrative and scenic images," and observes that "so understood, myth functions as a species of extended metaphor" (p. 16). Invoking Joseph Frank's terms,3 he sees myth as "a timeless world ... which finds its appropriate aesthetic expression in a spatial form" (p. 15). In Cope's treatment of Paradise Lost myth appears to have lost all connection with mythos as story; the mythic content of the poem inheres in certain scenic or spatial images which he reads as metaphors. "Metaphor" in Cope's definition has lost all connection with analogy or comparison. He declares that metaphor "does not function as analogy" but rather as the "immediate structural clarification . .. of experience"; its mode is inherently paradoxical; its purpose is "the conquest of temporal limitation, as is that of myth." The physical elements of the poem -light, dark, heights, depths-he does not consider under the general rubric of "imagery" or "image pattern" as many critics do, but regards them specifically as metaphors on the ground that they are themselves the embodi- ment of the theme of the poem, that they are "themselves the affective articulation of the myth" (pp. 5-6, 24). "Space" is seen as directly antithetical to Time. The author is concerned not only to suggest that the great regions, the spatial perspectives, the fall-rise verbal patterns create for the poem a milieu of mythic space as opposed to historical time, but also that the S"Spatial Form in Modern Literature," Sewanee Review, LIII (1945), 221-40, 433-56, 643-53. poem itself is a "vertical spatial organization" which constantly subsumes the temporal aspect of narrative (p. 76). This last assertion goes far beyond the familiar concern with the architectonics of the poem, resulting in the declaration that the poem shares with Finne- gans Wake the nearly unique distinction of being composed not as narrative but "in the manner of a painting . .. utilizing spatial line (the basic movement upward and downward within a given area) and the interplay of light and dark tones as both the formal and the meaning pattern" (p. 75). This is ut pictura poesis with a vengeance, but in a form which the Renaissance would hardly have under- stood. A measure of the novelty of Cope's ap- proach is provided by the disparity between his treatment of myth, metaphor, and space in Milton, and that of three critics whose studies he recognizes as seminal to his own. He builds upon Professor Northrup Frye's description of Paradise Lost as a cyclic, encyclopedic myth in which "the beginning and end are the same point, the presence of God, renewed and transformed by the heroic quest of Christ.4 He takes exception, however, to Frye's description as merging cyclic form with the quest form-"a form lineally ex- panded and therefore possessing the 'crisis' development which preoccupies a criticism nurtured by the Aristotelian principle of the beginning, middle, and end"-observing that "Milton's epic certainly cannot offer its richest rewards to a critic who seeks its 'sequential and processive form' " (p. 75). He also finds important precedent for his work in Professor Isabel MacCaffrey's treat- ment of fall-rise, light-dark image patterns in Paradise Lost,5 but dismisses her distressing conclusion that the style of Paradise Lost is unmetaphoric on the ground that metaphor is not analogy as she supposes, and that in fact she reads her image patterns as metaphor without knowing it. Her position further con- trasts with Cope's in that she regards myth and history, as closely related (not as opposed): she points out that Milton considered his 4 Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton, N.J., 1957), p. 320. 6 "Paradise Lost" as 'Myth' (Cambridge, Mass., 1959).</page><page sequence="4">PARADISE LOST "INTRODUCED" AND "STRUCTURED IN SPACE" 125 myth to be "the one true history," that Milton, like St. Augustine, combined "a mythic aware- ness of the timeless City of God with a vision of the flux of centuries," and that the mythic, spatial, cyclic structure of the poem is a background for, not a denial of "the most violent and most delicate action and move- ment" of history.6 Cope finds an additional precedent in Professor Rosemond Tuve's discussion of some shorter Milton poems as containing central, structural figures which embody the themes of the poems.' Miss Tuve, however, sees her "central figures" not as metaphor monads in a spatial structure but as protean forms in which "personifications change into allegories, and mythological narratives contract into meta- phors, stand still and become emblems, and deepen into symbols," in order to project pre- cisely the nuances of meaning intended. She also insists that "the factor of genre is of extreme importance to the imagery's nature and way of working."" Unlike Cope these critics show concern for narrative and for genre as well as for myth or metaphor or spatial structure. And indeed it seems questionable whether an epic poem by that great master of decorum, John Milton, can "yield its richest rewards" to a critic for whom considerations of narrative and of genre appear to be all but meaningless. At the level of practical criticism, Cope is sometimes excellent. His discussion of the paradoxical light-dark, fall-rise patterns is often illuminating, and he makes a positive contribution to knowledge in the suggestion that "Siloa's Brook" (I, 11) alludes to Christ's cure of the blind man by means of the waters of Siloam, thus figuring the relation of Christ as "Muse" to the blinded poet. But all too often Cope's theory seems to have led him to incomplete, strained, or erroneous readings, and to some distortion of Milton's thought. Several difficulties spring from the overriding concern with verbal patterns. Given such a concern, crucial narrative issues such as Tillyard's suggestion about the "center" or 6 Ibid., pp. 15, 51. 7 Images and Themes in Five Poems by Milton (Cambridge, Mass., 1957). 8 Ibid., pp. 10-11, 12. "crisis" of the poem can be lightly dismissed by the assertion that the poem has a "center- less" structure. Also the verbal emphasis has made of the poem's language a tissue of puns, many of which seem so unlikely that one can scarcely believe them to have been seriously suggested: for example, the final word of the passage describing Satan's flight to earth, "Nor stay'd, till on Niphates' top he lights" (III, 742) is read as a pun contributing to the light-dark metaphoric pattern. In addition, the concern with verbal patterns has unfortunately led to inattention to other aspects of the poem, and consequent error. Cope's evident desire to contrast speeches by Satan and Raphael on the paradoxical fall-rise motif has led him to attribute to Raphael the words, "Therefore from this high pitch let us descend / A lower flight, and speak of things at hand / Useful, whence haply mention may arise / Of some- thing not unseasonable to ask" (VIII, 189-201). The speech is of course Adam's, and it marks an important stage in his comprehension of himself and his situation, as the reader sensi- tive to the development of narrative and character must realize. Furthermore, Cope's effort to demonstrate that a recurring, cyclic pattern of fall and resurrection is adumbrated through certain paradox-laden metaphors has resulted in some unfortunate distortion of basic Miltonic attitudes. The sex act is considered as one of the structural metaphors presenting a micro- cosmic version of the Fall and containing also an implication of resurrection. Accordingly, all sexuality in the poem is regarded as containing connotations of evil-it is "the chief image of evil at crucial points in Paradise Lost"; or again it is "the obscene, awkward means by which Satan and the material world can ape God's creative fiat"; or yet again it is termed "a symbol of death but of death as it fits into the paradoxical fortunate-fall pattern" (pp. 80, 82, 84). If all this sounds a far cry from Adam and Eve's bower, that is because it is. And the appear- ances are not saved by Cope's statement that sexuality is "condoned in the bower scenes of Book IV" although as an "unrealizable symbol of innocence" already implying the</page><page sequence="5">126 BARBARA KIEFER LEWALSKI imperfection of the fallen world (p. 82). "Con- doned" must seem a flagrantly misleading term for Milton's reiterative insistence in image and statement upon the glory of unfallen sexuality. Cope makes of Milton a virtual Manichaean in this treatment of the sexual motif, as he does also in his discussion of space and matter as vehicles of evil and pain called into being by the fall of Satan. The book shows also an unfortunate tendency to argue by non sequitur and to criticize by metaphor. The first practice may be illustrated in the following passage: "At the ideational crisis of Paradise Lost time becomes space; at the ideational crisis of Paradise Regained space becomes time. This suggests to me that there is no real temptation in Paradise Regained... but only the exfoliation of the eternally given into time" (pp. 68-69). I do not pause here to explain that the "ideation- al crises" of the two poems are nowhere explicitly designated, or to argue my own view that there is quite "space" enough in Paradise Regained in the vastness of that desert where wild beasts roam, in that shady grove with arching branches, in the views from that mountain and that temple, yet surely the argument as stated demonstrates nothing: why may not temptations be "real" in a temporal or historical frame as well as a spatial one ? A similar argument states that the dialogue in heaven is necessarily non-dramatic since the Father's speeches contain a number of rhetorical schemes of words: "Father. and Son are acting out.. . a rhetorical and nondramatic ritual" (p. 173). How then is one to regard most Elizabethan drama if "rhetori- cal" and "dramatic" must be seen as neces- sarily antithetical terms ? In addition to the passages cited above, the following may serve to illustrate the tendency to "metaphoric" criticism: "I suggest that chaos is the great sea of fortune in which Satan thrashes his Icarian wings to cast up the world's first pair of star-crossed lovers and that vast space across which they pursue the passage of their death-marked love" (p. 56). Cope's own comment on the way in which metaphoric language-"Light," "Candle of the Lord," etc.-frustrated discursive theology in the seventeenth century and turned it into a kind of incantation, may help explain the incantatory effect created in his own prose by the constant reiteration of terms such as "Space," "Time," "Myth." But metaphor is not criticism any more than it is theology, and despite my sympathy for the critic's desire to reflect something of what he takes to be the nature of the work he discusses, he can usually serve the work better by eschewing quasi-poetic display and fulfilling the less spectacular functions of careful analysis, elucidation, and argument.
