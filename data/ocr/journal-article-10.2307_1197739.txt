<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL REVIEWS lapses into carelessness, as when the author says that the world of nature is "precisely the one thing he (man) does not and cannot know all about" (p. o16); or when reference is made to Jacob selling his birthright (p. 54); or when, after making human freedom the locus of con- flict and of sin, we hear of man's "heritage from the jungle" (p. 260). The closing chapter on the church deserves wide and careful reading, and the call for Chris- tian "irregulars" is superb. J. HARRY COTTON Wabash College The Political Community: A Study of Anomie. By SEBASTIAN DE GRAZIA. Chicago: Univer- sity of Chicago Press, I948. xx+258 pages. $4.00. This book, written by a talented young Chi- cago professor of sociology, will be of interest not only to fellow-sociologists. It covers a wide range of problems, though its main concern is to investigate social disintegration. It draws from a multitude of sources: theological, historical, an- thropological, psychological, and medical. It is not a ponderous tome; written fluidly, occasion- ally in a conversational tone, this study is more than just another sociological monograph. Re- flecting very clearly the state of mind in which the social sciences in this country, and, more es- pecially, in one of the citadels of this field, find themselves at this time and hour, it possesses a symptomatical value. It is comprehensive, sometimes penetrating, discerning, and in parts subtle in its analysis. But it is lacking in vision and in constructive suggestions as to how to overcome the difficulties and to heal the wounds of which a society threatened by disintegration is suffering. The diagnosis is made, but we miss indications of a therapy. Is that asking too much? Certainly it would be unfair to expect the author to spell out a systematic philosophy of society or even a series of propositions as to pol- icy. The question is rather: Does the author go deep enough in his analysis of the sources of anomie so as to be able to point out potentially available remedies? While the writer's information is vast as far as work in the empirical disciplines is concerned, there is less in evidence when it comes to norms and principles (ethics, philosophy, theology). Especially the theologian, conversant with the discussion in this field in the last twenty-five years, will regret the lack of reference to a great variety of fruitful investigations and sugges- tions to be found in Protestant and Catholic writings on the Good-and the Bad-Society. To be more specific, here is an important in- stance. The author rightly makes a great deal of the "belief-systems" which underlie and direct attitudes and actions of the members of any community (cf. the Introduction). Yet nowhere is there an attempt made to examine the nature of these "beliefs." The very pertinent inquiry into their intrinsic character as over against a purely pragmatic interpretation to which an- thropologists and sociologists are so prone, car- ried on by numerous theologians and philoso- phers, should have been of interest to the au- thor. There is also no hint that at the beginning of the last century the French "ideologues" and, more recently, the sociologists of knowledge have shed a great deal of light on the problems that are involved here. Before outlining briefly the modus proceden- di followed in De Grazia's book, I should like to point to one more methodological question. The author is firmly convinced of the legitimacy of the genetic method, according to which knowledge of their origin gives us insight into the nature of phenomena; he is deeply indebted to psychopathology, especially psychoanalysis. Though a great deal can actually be learned about the life of an adult from an investigation of that of the infant and child, De Grazia seems not to have always avoided the dangers lurking in what William James used to call the "genetic fallacy" (chaps. iii-v) (cf. p. 79). It seems to the reviewer that he presses the analogies existing between child and adult situations and reactions and does not take seriously enough the objection quoted by him: "A man is not a child" (p. 79). In his Introduction (p. x) the author asks: What makes a group of people a community? His answer is: "their religious and political be- liefs." He points to their "close psychological connection and mutual support" (p. xviii) with- out attempting to define more definitely their relation. The "Great Community" is defined as the political community held together by be- lief-systems, which fill a universal need (p. x). Where they become disturbed, "anomie" (in contrast to solidarity) arises (the term was in- troduced by t. Durkheim in 1893; cf. p. I95). De Grazia distinguishes "simple" and "acute" anomie. The investigation of the causes (and I57</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION their implications) and the conseque] two kinds of anomie are central topi( means a disturbance in the relation and ruled.
