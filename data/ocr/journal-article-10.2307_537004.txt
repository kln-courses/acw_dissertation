<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSIFICATION AND DESCRIP- TION OF AINU FOLKLORE By RICHARD W. HOWELL D ESIGNED PRIMARILY as a jumping-off place for the further study of Ainu folklore, this paper does not purport to be definitive even within its limited scope. It does, however, attempt to survey the more pertinent literature and perhaps throw some light on a thoroughly muddled problem: the degree of sophistication of the Ainu. Probably the occurrence of epic poetry in a given culture is unexpected approximately in proportion as that culture is considered primitive. If this attitude is justified, it raises a two- fold question. First, whether the Ainu actually have epic poetry, and second, whether the Ainu are so primitive as we generally think. The case for the Ainu is strong; two noteworthy students (Pilsudski and Kindaichi) have claimed this literary form for them. Why others have not recognized epic forms among the Ainu is perhaps easily explained. Relatively little field work has been done on the Ainu; Kindaichi usually wrote in Japanese; Batchelor is the primary non-Japanese source. Had Batchelor considered equal in importance to the content of a given bit of lore the method of its delivery, it is probable he would never have sloughed off yukara simply as "songs." In 1912 Bronislaw Pilsudskil distinguished twelve classes of folklore among the Saghalien Ainu, based partially, at least, on the distinctions the Ainu them- selves make. A similar study was published twenty years later (1933) by Kindaichi Kyosuke2 for the Yezo, or Hokkaid6, Ainu. Although the Yezo and Saghalien Ainu are dialectically discrete, the types of folklore in the two groups seem to correspond quite well. That is, the style, or delivery, as well as the content of the several classes is extremely close. It is unfortunate that examples of most of the types are not available, for the correspondence between the two main groups, however close, is not exact, and even within one of the groups just where to draw the line between two given types is not always clear. The four of his twelve categories which Pilsudski calls epic will be discussed first in the order that they seem most "epic." Most interesting, significant, and ancient of the Ainu literature forms is that termed yukara ("songs") on Hokkaido, and hauki ("make-voice") on Saghalien. These are heroic narra- tives varying in length from a few hundred to ten thousand and more lines of approximately five syllables each, often requiring a whole night for the relating. They are delivered in archaic language, intelligible only to the old people and those with a special talent for language. There was once a special class of people 1 A bibliography will be found at the end of this paper; all references to it will simply be made by author, date, and page number, in that order unless the necessary data are otherwise obvious. 2 Kindaichi is the family name: throughout this paper Japanese names are given in this, the Japanese, style. 361</page><page sequence="2">Journal of American Folklore who went about from house to house, on Saghalien at least, in the evenings singing the yukara and other epic forms. The performers were popular and some were locally famous. But they had all taken up more civilized pursuits by Pilsudski's time.3 There is no intentional rhyme, but a strong rhythmical beat is marked either with the hand (on Saghalien) or with a short stick (on Hokkaido). The style has been likened to the Kowaka no Mai of Japan, a type of dance in which time is kept by beating a fan.4 The last syllable of each line is invariably lengthened with a shake or trill, not unlike the final syllables in certain anthems of the Gregorian plain chant in Catholic churches.5 When fatigued, the narrator sometimes drops into a sort of recitative. Pil- sudski suggests this may be why, on Hokkaid6, this form is also called sa koro ita, "speech having intervals."6 Kindaichi mentions as a kind of yukara sakorobe,7 "things having intervals," but in either case details are lacking. As might be expected from a group of once fierce warriors, yukara involve the heroes, frequently assisted actively by women, in numerous battles, often between clans. The hero is usually raised by his elder sister or aunt8 from whom he learns his obligation to avenge the destruction of his family. Following is an abstract of one of the shorter yukara recorded by Batchelor: I was brought up by my elder sister. Each night pictures of arms (swords, etc.) would come to life and flash about. Now, I had heard that the people of Kunashiri and Shuma- shiri were brave beyond measure, and this troubled me so much I was unable to sleep. One night I slipped out of the house quietly, while my sister was asleep. On my way (to wage battle) I ran into the younger sister of the wolf god. She warned me of the bravery of the Kunashiri and Shumashiri people, and promised me her younger sister in marriage plus some gifts, if only I would return home. This angered me so greatly that I rose up and slew her. Then the wolf god himself appeared, displeased at my having killed his younger sister. If it were killing I wanted, why then, he said, he might give me some of that! Then he attacked me, but I managed finally to slay him also. After that I waged war single-handed against Kunashiri and Shumashiri until the gods from home (i.e., the pictures of the weapons again come to life) came to my assistance. After waging the war (successfully) I returned home. On the way, the voice of a god explained to me that I was the son of Okikurumi9 and that war against Kunashiri and Shumashiri was proper.

The existence of clans among the Ainu is by no means established. 9 Okikurumi is generally conceded to be Yoshitsune, the famous Japanese general of the 12th Century, who was supposedly chased north to Ainu country by his brother Yoritomo when that worthy finally got control of the country as number one power in the dominant Minamoto clan. Kindaichi tends not to believe Okikurumi and Yoshitsune are one; probably, he suggests, early Japanese travellers among the Ainu heard tales of Okikurumi and were reminded of similar tales told of Yoshitsune, cemented the association, and gave rise to the myth of their identity. See Kindaichi, I933, p. 3. 362</page><page sequence="3">The Classification and Description of Ainu Folklore 363 the gods were highly angered by my killing the wolf god and his sister. In retribution my sister had been taken away. Alas, it was true; both she and her belongings were gone. I grieved, but to no avail. Then one day the wolf god appeared,10 and I finally married his younger sister. In the evenings the pictures would come to life, exercise, and talk of old times.11 This type of yukara when handed down by the ancestors is called hengi-hauki on Saghalien, and means "songs of the forefathers," but there is another type, called chitara-hauki, "dream songs," which are composed by modern poets in imitation of the forms of ancient speech and life.'2 The oldest mention of yukara is in the Yezo Dan Hikki, written, according to Kindaichi,l3 in I709 by Matsumiya Kansan, in which is related Yoshitsune's theft of the treasured scroll of Yezo.14 The tale was "sung like the joruri of Japan."15 In 1737 there came the Yezo Zuihitsul6 of Sakakura Gen-uemon. "Reaching the height of their drinking they sang songs and related the j6ruri. The sound was like voices reciting a proclamation .... It is related slowly, with the sound of the Sendai j6ruri," which form it then describes in some detail.l7 Another description is found in Tatematsu T6m6's Toyuki of I784. The yukara "is sung lying on the back while drunk, beating the chest with both hands."'8 Since the 10 It was not uncommon for a man or god to live again after having been killed.

Since the text is set up as straight prose, its essentially poetic construction cannot be seen. Kindaichi points out this flaw and in the same place (op. cit., p. io) says Batchelor's imperfect understanding of grammatical person led to some deception, and that some sections of the legends are inconsistent. I noticed nothing serious in these last two respects for this example of yukara, but Kindaichi was referring to all four yukara recorded (No. 7 in Batchelor, i888; Nos. 8 and 9 in Batchelor, I889; and No. 10 in Batchelor, 1892). 12 Pilsudski, op. cit., p. xviii. 13 Op. cit., p. 3. The famous statesman-writer Arai Hakuseki wrote a volume between 1704- I7II with the same title (see Chamberlain's bibliography, I877, p. I44) treating of the produc- tions of Yezo, the Ainu language, and the Ainu revolt of I669 under Shagushamu. Whether these are the same work, somehow or other, I have been unable to ascertain. 14 Since this was the only writing the Ainu had, the theft of the scroll explains to the Ainu their non-literacy. See Batchelor, I90I, pp. 265-268 and Chamberlain, 1888, pp. 51-52. 16 Joruri are a class of metrical romances, tales chanted to a measure, as had been the old military romances like the Heike Monogatari (ca. 13th Century) and the Taiheiki (ca. 14th Century). They were recited by a single person, usually a professional, accompanied by taps of a fan to mark time or to give emphasis. The name is derived from the story Joruri Ju-ni Dansoshi (ca. i6th Century), which relates the loves of Yoshitsune and a legendary heroine, Joruri. Jo6ruri perhaps reached their greatest development around the Genroku Period (i688- 1703), when they were used as narratives to accompany the puppet or marionette dances. The beginning of the I9th Century, however, saw the nearly complete cessation of the writing of Joruri. See Aston, 1937, pp. 274-312; Chamberlain, 1905, p. 464; and Sansome, 1943, pp. 483- 484. 16 Two years later another edition with minor changes and a supplement came out under the title Hokkai Zuihitsu. 17 Kindaichi, op. cit., p. 4. 18 Ibid.</page><page sequence="4">Journal of American Folklore time of Mogami Tokunai the yukara have been known in Japan as "Yezo j6ruri," "Yezo no nagauta," and "saimon."19 In Tokunai's Yezo Soshi of 1789 short specimen passages are given, while in the Watarishima Hikki by the same author under a different name, in I8o8, more detail is found. It is here that the language of yukara can be seen for the first time, and it was recog- nized by Tokunai as primarily "ancient classical language."20 The first real Ainu language text to be recorded in the Japanese syllabary, however, was "Yugari, Joruri no Koto," found in the Moshiogusa of I804 by Uehara Kumajiro.21 The text runs about five hundred lines in thirteen pages. But the language is completely Japonized for the first page and a half, and for this section only is there appended a translation. The untranslated remainder is in the northern dialect and, while there are errors, it is pure Ainu.22 Apparently the last authentic record of Ainu literature before the Restora- tion23 was a small manuscript entitled Yezo-gon, Charanke, narabi ni Joruri, issued by the Shoko Kanshozo, but neither the writers nor the dates are clear. Its one hundred and fifty-six lines represent a fairly precise and unadulterated Ainu song, but there is no translation, and the content is the same as one of the yukara in the above-mentioned Watarishima Hikki.24 About 1883 or 1884 a rather brief example of yukara was translated into Japanese by Nagata Hosei in the Toyo Gakugei Zassii.25 John Batchelor recorded several specimens of yukara in a series published in the Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan for 1888, I889, I892. Kindaichi says the four numbers from seven to ten are yukara while the preceding are examples of Yezo no nagauta or saimon.26 Probably the best single work of this sort is Kindaichi Kyosuke's two-volume Yukara no Kenkyu of I93I. The first volume contains a general discussion of Ainu literature, while the second is devoted solely to yukara. There is a lengthy discussion of the Ainu epic language followed by two rather distinct versions of a single yukara, the "Kutune Shirka." The first version is in 7,035 five-syl- lable lines, and is divided into nine sections, approximately one per battle. The other version is in but four sections, although it runs to 8,220 five-syllable lines. 19 The nagauta is a poem of indefinite length, unrhymed, with a syllabic line pattern of 5-7 . . . 5-7-7. Salmon are usually Shinto prayers. 20 Kindaichi, op. cit., p. 5. 21 As co-author, Batchelor adds the name of Abe Chozabur5 (1926, p. I). It was from this work, an Ainu vocabulary, that Dr. A. Pfitzmaier of Vienna attempted in 185I to submit Ainu to a grammatical analysis, the first effort of its kind. For a good critique of Pfitzmaier's work see Chamberlain, I877, p. 2. A second, two-volume edition of the Moshiogusa was entitled Yezo Hogen Moshiogusa, date of publication unknown. 22 Kindaichi, op. cit., p. 7. 23 868, when the reins of government in Japan were formally handed back to the Emperor by the Feudal Lords. 24 Kindaichi, op. cit., p. 8. 25 Kindaichi, op. cit., p. 9. No details given and, as usual, the original work was not available. 26 See notes I and 19, above. The distinction between yukara, Yezo no nagauta, and saimon is not apparent. 364</page><page sequence="5">The Classification and Description of Ainu Folklore Several yukara (hauki) of Saghalien have been recorded in the Japanese syllabary with an annotated translation in the work called the Kita Yezo Koyoki Hen, published some time after the Restoration.27 The above covers the bulk of important work on yukara. While there may be other material, it is either inaccessible or unknown to me-as is most of the work in Russian, for example-or else it is presented in such a fashion as to be stylistically unrecognizable: most of the work by Batchelor and Chamberlain fits into this category. Neither of these men really attempts to classify Ainu literature, and it is often impossible to distinguish the several types simply on the basis of content. Second of the epic forms, and from the Ainu standpoint perhaps the most important, is the oina, "ancient [legends]." Pilsudski remarks that on Hokkaid6 they are known also as kamui yukara, "god-yukara" or "divine yukara."28 Kindaichi, however, considers the oina as an intermediate type developed from the kamui yukara, and one which has become a guide for the composition of ordinary or hero-yukara. He admits this is a more or less experimental attempt at a new point of view, but whether or not he thinks in terms of an evolution from religious to secular yukara is not certain.29 Nor is the exact distinction between the forms clear. But it would seem the oina are the teachings of the gods,30 while the kamui yukara are more the adventures of the gods. Local variations tend to complicate a clear analysis. In the Iburi region, for instance, there are Poro oina ("Great oina") and Pon oina ("Lesser oina"), but in the Hidaka region the two are not considered discrete.31 A similar example is in the oina which relates at some length the biography of Oina kamui. It is specifically called Kamui oina ("god-legend") over many parts of Hokkaido, but there are districts where it is simply "oina."32 Oina, says Pilsudski,33 are usually sung, in sitting posture, with an appropri- ate burden34-often equivalent to a title-by either men or women with a good memory, musical talent, and a good voice. Like the yukara, each line generally has five syllables, no rhyme, but a strong rhythmical beat. Most of the oina 27 Kindaichi, op. cit., p. 14. 28 Pilsudski, op. cit., p. xvii. 29 See Kindaichi, op. cit., p. I6. 30 Particularly Oina kamui, the most important deity and culture hero. He is variously called Ainu Rakkuru and Aeoina. Sometimes he is also confused with Okikurumi (see note 9, above). Okikurumi has taught the Ainu many arts, but respect for Yoshitsune (assuming him to be Okikurumi) is secular, while for Aeoina it is religious. 31 Kindaichi, op. cit., p. I6. 32 Ibid., p. 12. 33 Op. cit., p. xvii. 34 An example of this would seem to be the first of the series mentioned on page 364 above (Batchelor, i888). See also note II, above. It is called Inusa-Inusa, and is given by Batchelor as an example of a legend in verse. But Kindaichi, as also noted on page 364, remarks it is one of the Yezo no nagauta, and apparently by definition not oina. An outline and discussion of the same tale is found in Kindaichi, op. cit., pp. 103-IO8. Batchelor repeats the item, this time without any text, in 1901: 256-257. 365</page><page sequence="6">Journal of American Folklore concern the first Ainu,35 a demigod, and his conflicts with supernatural foes and wild beasts. He is usually accompanied by his sister and elder brother36 but they do not possess his magic powers. Of the yukara of the gods-presumably kamui yukara, which Pilsudski equates with oina-Kindaichi says they are "explanatory narratives which include, among other things, the origin of the gods, religious festivities, and the beginnings of customary rites."37 Oina show about the same variety in length as the ordinary yukara and are also divided into sections. The third type, uwepekere ("a tale," or "conversation," or "news"), Pil- sudski also lists as epic.38 Whether this is justified seems questionable. In the first place the medium of expression for these narratives is prose. Then, the tales do not seem describable as heroic in proportion. Uwepekere have their origin in dreams and are afterwards told and repeated from mouth to mouth. The narrators are usually women and children; appa- rently there is no particular group of people whose specialty it is to pass these along. Pilsudski includes a great variety of subjects under this head:39 all tales of animals that act like men; stories of mutual love and sexual relations between animals on the one hand, and men on the other; narratives of molestations on the part of goblins or ogres of all sorts; fantasies of the general Cinderella type; and anecdotes of the Pen and Pan pattern typified in the following abstract: Pen wanted to get rich so he made his tail stretch to the court of the Lord of Matomai. The Lord of Matomai then ordered his servants to hang all his best garments on the beautiful pole.40 When all was quiet Pen gently withdrew his tail with the treasures. Pan heard of his neighbor's success, found out the trick, and tried the same thing himself. Again the best garments were hung on the beautiful pole, but Pan, in his eagerness to get rich, withdrew his tail too quickly. The Lord of Matomai, seeing these treasures about to go the way of the last, ordered the pole cut. Thus Pan ended up not only without the treasures, but without half his tail.41 Kindaichi has relatively little to say about this form, but he does distinguish between Kamui uwepekere, "ancient tales of the gods,"42 and Ainu uwepekere, 53 Probably Aeoina (Oina kamui), although Pilsudski, op. cit., p. xx, says the name of the hero varies in each area. In the Saru River district the hero is stated to be none other than Okikurumi! 36 Why the elder brother is not the first Ainu and hero is perhaps explained by a pattern common to most of the Ainu tales: the younger brother, the sickly and despised one, is always triumphant over the elder brothers. Sometimes the younger brother rescues his elder brothers from dire peril, other times, especially in animal tales, he thwarts them in some scheme. 37 Op. cit., p. I6. 38 Op. cit., p. xvi. On Saghalien uwepekere are usually called tuita, "two [people] speaking," or hushko uwepekere, "old news." 39 Op. cit., pp. xvi ff. 40 In other versions, perhaps more common, the beautiful pole is a penis. This version is found in Chamberlain, I888, along with several other tales not to be found in the good Reverend Batchelor's works. 41 Batchelor, I927, pp. 240-241. 42Since kamui signifies not only anthropomorphic deities but a myriad of other kinds- many animals, for example-these gods are probably not the same as those in the kamui 366</page><page sequence="7">The Classification and Description of Ainu Folklore "ancient tales of mankind." The language differs, at least, from the usual colloquial, possibly because many of the tales have become stereotyped.43 Though the author and dates are not clear, there was recorded in the nine- teen-volume Yezo Kembunki44 one uwepekere. Unfortunately the Ainu was patched together in Japanese sentences instead of being written down as it came from the mouth of the speaker. Only the salient features of the production furnished the basis for the Japanese translation and the re-translation. The appended Ainu words serve simply as a vocabulary, and the work is not com- pletely reliable. Moreover, the tale was called yukara, definitely a mistake, since it is prose throughout.45 Last of the groups to be classed as epic by Pilsudski46 is uchaskoma. These are tales handed down by oral tradition, told usually by men. Two groups are distinguished on Saghalien: the first, called either sonno yai ainu uchaskoma, "true Ainu tales," or ainu shikat uchaskoma, "stories of the rise of the Ainu," contain the history. The second group, Rurupun nishpa uchaskoma, "tales about the rich men of Rurupa," Pilsudski found nowhere but among the Ainu of Saghalien. These are said to be extremely old, and are held by the Ainu themselves to be fabulous. Any male youngster with the proper interest, a good memory, and an inclina- tion to question his elders is willingly entrusted with these traditions. Twenty-seven uchaskoma were recorded by Pilsudski.47 It is interesting to note that many "legends" Batchelor passes along are of this variety, and that though he does not attempt to be particularly academic, his versions coincide almost exactly with the more painstaking translations of Pilsudski. In the following chart I give the number of each uchaskoma in Pilsudski that has also been told by Batchelor, and the place where it is to be found in Batchelor, 1927 in order that they may be compared by anyone interested: No. in Pilsudski Corresponding place in Batchelor, I927 I 222-225 2 287-289 3 124-126 4 29-33 10 280-285 12 I33-I40 14 203 yukara.

First of the so-called lyric forms are the love songs, yaikatekara, sung both by male and female lovers, though especially by girls, when they are alone. The themes are notably weaker than those found in Gilyak amatory lyrics, possibly because severe marriage laws-often causing a conflict with passion among the Gilyaks-are non-existent among the Ainu.49 Next are the shinotcha, recreative songs, short and of a light, jovial nature.50 They are usually improvised at drinking bouts, and random kakeai5l are per- formed. They contain many meaningless sound patterns,62 often of an onoma- topoetic character. Ihunki are cradle songs; literally "to make a noise," they are for the most part rhythmical babblings, without words except for an occasional improvisa- tion made to the child about its future, and asking it to sleep soundly.53 Yaiyukara, "aimless songs," were sung to while away the time on a journey or while fishing, but have fallen into disuse.4 Chibo hau, "boating songs," are simply short outbursts, inspired by the occasion and circumstances of the journey.55 Shinot itak, "funny sayings," are short verses containing a joke or quaint saying to create amusement.56 Urexreku are riddles.57 48 Pilsudski, op. cit., p. xviii. 49 Ibid. 60 Ibid. 61 Kakeai is a Japanese diversion in which one person makes up one line (of poetry, for example), a second person makes up the next line, and so forth. " Kindaichi, op. cit., pp. I2-I4, suggests the possibility these sounds once had meaning. For example, the sound heard as wewe in the drinking songs is actually the same as the wewe of the bear-god in the tales related autobiographically in the voice of a bear. 6a Pilsudski, op. cit., p. xviii.

The Saghalien "x" (a voiceless velar fricative) corresponds to p, t, or k among the southern dialects. 368</page><page sequence="9">The Classification and Description of Ainu Folklore The last category is the miscellany. Speeches, either on receiving or on part- ing from guests, prayers, shaman incantations, etc., form a not unimportant part of the prose literature.58 Probably the iso-itak, tales of a real experience, fall into this group somewhere. It is customary on visiting or returning from somewhere to relate one's adventures. Unfortunately, I do not know the name of this custom. There was an iso-itak recorded in the above-mentioned Yezo Kembunki,59 but other than that there seems to be little information on this type. Batchelor's more popular works are riddled with various Ainu prayers, but probably Shaman incantations are hard, if not impossible, to obtain.
