<plain_text><page sequence="1">Claude-Nicolas Ledoux: Architecture and Social Reform at the End of the Ancien Regime by Anthony Vidier MIT Press, 1990 446 pp., ?49.95 0-262-22032-6 Anthony Vidier's fully and carefully illustrated Ledoux is perhaps the least biased monograph yet published on this architect of the French Enlightenment. As in his previous works,1 Vidier 's chief concern is to explicate the theory behind the architecture, and to interpret its sym? bolism. He thus opens up rich fields for explor? ation. But at the same time we are faced with a critical method which is still immature, applied to an oeuvre which, since it is known largely through engravings, is inevitably insubstantial.2 Critical studies of Ledoux are a comparatively recent phenomenon, dating from the early 1930s with the work of Genevieve Levallet-Haug, and with Emil Kaufmann's 'invention' of the archi 106 tect as a hero of modernism. Since then there have been numerous articles and books ? and as many different interpretations. However, the recent discovery of about a hundred unpublished graphic works serves as a reminder that the quan? tity of material which is missing (some of it documented as such) is as large as the available material.3 Superimposed on Vidier's chronological ac? count of the life and work of Ledoux is an attempt to trace the continuity of certain basic themes: the 'language of character', the impact of tech? nology ? the 'architecture of production', 'the urban typology', and the social and political im? plications of his 'utopia in the countryside'. The conclusion affirms the hypothesis around which the book is constructed: Ledoux reveals himself as 'more typically an architect of the late Enlight? enment than many have wished to admit'. The most novel aspect of Vidier's approach seems to concern Ledoux's interest in multiple means of communication. But the new emphasis given to this phenomenon still does not enable us to assess precisely the nature of the information that Ledoux conveyed by these same means. Consider, for example, the words T awaken like Epimenides' in the exergue of the Prospectus of L'Architecture consideree sous le rapport de Vart, des moeurs et de la legislation (1802).4 This, as Vidier observes, is a reference to the Epimenides of Knossos, and it hints at Orphic revelation. The entire text of L'Architecture... (1804) must be situated within Ledoux's rhetoric, which justified a boldness in the writings, re? inforced by elements of contemporary Roman? ticism but structured in accordance with the prophetic genre. As Ledoux's commentary on the Director's Building at Chaux indicates, he saw himself as a new Epimenides, imparting the laws of a new Athens to a new Solon, in an ancient and unbroken ritual of initiation: 'Solon, according to Plato, discovered in Egypt an ancient Athens [whose] ruined monuments dated from 9,000 years before the Flood' (Ledoux, I, p. 139). Historians have always been uncom? fortable with such an explicit reference (dis? guised as Athens) to the myth of Atlantis, and have therefore tended to marginalize its signifi? cance for Ledoux's work or, worse, to dismiss it as pathological dreaming, or relegate it to the sphere of the autonomous genius (Vautonomie). Vidier, by resituating Ledoux's typologies within the context of Enlightenment architectural theory, is able to trace their origins in the teach? ings of Blondel and in the contemporary debate on the transparency of function. The concept of 'truth in architecture', if it be fundamental to Ledoux's typologies, nevertheless retains some of the ambiguity of d'Alembert's 'ornamental facade' (masque embelli). However, such 'truth', as in theatre, is justified only by the morality of the intentions. This morality, inscribed in the 'truth' of monuments, has much in common with the ideas of the encyclopedistes, but there is no disguising its function as a didactic instrument of a social, religious and monarchical feudal order, the legitimacy ? indeed the universal validity ? of which was embedded in the myths of Nature and History, and in the works Ledoux was reinforced by the myth of the Architect. After the success of Ledoux's first commission (the interior of the Cafe Militaire), his creden? tials as a fashionable architect were established by the hotels and chateaux he designed for private clients between 1766 and 1780.5 In these early works the young architect displayed an ability to generate elevations and plans (Tes de hors et les dedans') which corresponded 'em? blematically to the nature of his clients'. The Tangages de caractere' which Ledoux formu? lated in these private commissions found their full expression in his later projects for 'insti? tutions of public order'. The opportunity of creating or redefining the programmes of such institutions, as exemplified by the change from manufactory to factory at the Saline de Chaux, allowed him to make a definite break with the rules of convenance (suitability), a break which in this case was made easier by the absence of immediate precedents within the academic tradition. Obliged to invent a new language for buildings of such novelty, Ledoux drew on a wide variety of models. But his references to antiquity ? whether biblical ('Chaldea, the Orient, Egypt . . . cradle of the arts' (p. 211)), Greek, Roman, Gallic or Gallo-Roman ? al? ways remained 'at the level of general allusions rather than precise quotations',6 and were blended with a classicism of a generalized kind, adapted to a geometric system (essentially the nine-square Palladian grid7). These served as the foundations of his new typological method. Thus Ledoux was able to develop a 'generic classicism', a new language of 'character', free of convention and enriched with sculptural effects and historical allusions, which appeared truly 'synonymous with communication'. Vidier suggests that it was the idea of the Sublime, as propounded by Burke and others, which enabled Ledoux to achieve this. Beyond the question of specific types, it was the concept of the 'public Sublime' ? its capacity to communicate ideas through the agency of the eyes and of the other senses ? which established the universal quality of building and defined it as 'architecture'. For Ledoux the notion of the Sub? lime provided a means of establishing the archi? tect's universal role and of establishing his authority over every type of building, from the dwelling of the pauper to the palace of the prince. This contributed to the formulation of an insti? tutional genre, the 'public genre', which reached maturity in the work of the 1780s (the Hotel des Fermes, the Marche de la rue Saint-Denis, the Bourses, etc.) no less than in the detailed proposals for the Palais de Justice and prisons of Aix-en-Provence. The propylaea, or barrieres, of Paris joined AA FILES 24</page><page sequence="2">Portrait of Claude-Nicolas Ledoux by Marguerite Gerard. The drawing on the table shows the Barriere de Reuilly. (Musee Cognacq-Jay, Paris) together all the elements of a public programme ? commissioned by the Ferme G6n6rale as the agent of royal power; adopting a mythical role, that of encircling a 'new Athens'; and acting as a means of social, political and aesthetic indoc? trination. The formal unity of the 'repertory of models' was here derived not only from their common structure, but from references to his? torical 'types' which lay outside the conventional models of 'neoclassical historicism'; the 'style of the Ferme' was linked with the 'style of 1785' to create a 'primitivist' grammar ? the 'personal invention of Ledoux'. Vidier notes that Ledoux, as well as intending that the barrier es should serve as a 'museum of types', or 'object lessons for the architect and the citizen', hoped that they would stir the spirit of the public, raise them and bond them (niveler was the verb the architect himself used); more? over, they embodied a 'transformational gram? mar', inspired by Locke and Condillac, that was 'calculated to produce the effect of a chain of association'. The experimentation with forms (here some of Ledoux's contemporaries were not deceived) went beyond the limits of stylistic ex? pression or urban function, to achieve the status of 'talismans'.8 Ledoux's education at the College de Beauvais and his receptivity to both the cultural and the rhetorical content of his training is documented at length by Vidier. This could well have been complemented by a similarly thorough investi? gation of Ledoux's training as an engraver, for this introduced him to the relation between visual illustration and text, which finds its natural extension in the fictions of the theatre. It was the programme for the saltworks of Chaux which allowed Ledoux to give concrete form to his pedagogic ideas. It was not only his first opportunity to create a 'regenerated typo? logy', but also his first 'theatrical' production. The semicircular form of the saltworks echoed that of an antique theatre: it was to be a 'theatre AA FILES 24 of production', developed between 1773 and 1774 in tandem with the 'social theatre' of Besancon. The ambiguity between function and form was zealously maintained by Ledoux himself.9 Vid? ier, who distils from previous interpretations a definition of this 'theatrical vision of reality', rightiy points out the intimate links between the two projects, evident not only in the theory and symbolism behind them, but in the very binding of the book in which they were published.10 In this attempt to locate the foundation of Le? doux's creative thought within his typologies, and to trace the influence of theatrical theory on his work as a whole, Vidier advances a theory of Ledoux's creative thought, but seems unable to supply a convincing context for it. His approach seems unable to overcome a problem facing all critical studies of Ledoux: how to interpret the most complex image the architect ever created, that of his own career ? his oeuvre ? trans? mitted to posterity for the most part through his own efforts. In many cases the built work may intervene, but the images it embodies are none the less most clearly legible in the principal 'mirror' ? his L 'Architecture of 1804. Thus the metaphor most closely approximating to Ledoux's system would be a labyrinth of mirrors, where each surface reflects a fragment of the work, together with the image of the spectator. To provide an accurate account of this process it would be necessary to incorporate such notions as the interactions of the observer with the object observed. This 'total monument' is exemplified in the view of the Theatre of Besancon, as seen through the pupil of the eye (plate 113)11 ? a mirror which encompasses both the auditorium and the stage. The spectator and the actor ? or in this case the reader and the architect ? each play a part in the same drama, directed by a 'progres? sive system' which superimposes and confuses the place of illusion and the image of reality. But the mirror is fractured when the engraved work ? reflecting the remains of an 'intellectual world' ? is confronted with the remains of the built work, the reconstruction of a buried archetype.12 Historians find it difficult to make a detached analysis of this body of work which is both 'fictive' and 'active'. Even putting L 'Architecture and the Utopian towns to one side would not help much, for it is more than likely that the whole of Ledoux's built work, from his first buildings around the forest of Chaux on? wards, was rooted in this theatrical production, in the same way that his 'Utopian' work was rooted in a place and a time.13 The principal task facing the critic of Ledoux, therefore, is perhaps not one of documenting the sources of the architect's work, either built or on paper, but rather one of defining the true nature of the objects he has left to posterity. As Vidier rightiy observes, Ledoux's practice and dis? course ? even the substance of his thought ? were shaped by a whole range of identifiable techniques. Any analysis must take these into ac? count and systematically interpret the 'writings' and the 'figures' in the texts and images, in order to transcend the obvious and achieve a critical interpretation of the work. This is a matter of revealing not merely the rules governing a career or an ideology, the proportional lines, the geo? metric or anthropomorphic patterns,14 or the combinations of Platonic forms, but the intel? lectual method which suffused Ledoux's work as a whole and which cannot be confused with the conventions of this or that genre. The text of L'Architecture belongs to the 'initiatory' genre ? a form of storytelling or drama which would have been familiar to both Ledoux and the 'uninitiated' in the late eight? eenth century, and which may have had an important relationship with Freemasonry. Ledoux's philosophy and iconography corres? ponded in many ways to the early Freemasonry of the Englightenment ? the 'revaluation des realites' and its related physiocracy and agro? nomic reformism with which the whole project of the Encyclopedic was associated. Although such influences may shed some light on Ledoux's thought and on his projects, they were for the most part shared by his contemporaries. It is known that a large number of Ledoux's patrons (for example Montesquiou, Haudry, Montmorency), close friends (Cellerier, Brogni art, De Wailly) and pupils (Sobre) were Free? masons, and it is plausible to suggest, accepting William Beckford's account, that well before 1784 Ledoux was himself a member of a 'mili? tary and religious order' ? a 'non-Masonic lodge' which nevertheless shared the same 'motifs and allegorical references'. The amply documented ritual links with the 'Freemasonry of the Wood' (at Bourneville and at Chaux) could have been further developed in Vidler's book. The 'Freemasons of the Woods' enacted their rites of initiation in the name of 'Alexander the Great', founder of Pharos, a city of 'circular form . . . whose roundness was completed by two rectilinear plinths . . . which enclosed its grandeur like a Macedonian cloak'.15 These rites are alluded to in the dedi? cation of L 'Architecture, which was addressed to another royal, Alexander, the reigning tsar of Russia, as well as in the 'theoretical' form of Chaux or the hieroglyphic connotations of its plan. This might have been the best occasion to connect the world of Ledoux with the circle of the Duke of Aiguillon, a circle which opposed the Duke de Choiseul, was allied to the Jesuits, and had Madame Du Barry16 as its political representative ? that same Madame Du Barry who was said by Beckford to be the 'soleil initiatique' of Ledoux himself.17 Ledoux sought to anchor his claims for uni? versality in formal, moral and mystical arche? types, passing beyond a stylistic primitivism and seeking validation in the constants of the mechanics and psychology of perception, which 107</page><page sequence="3">The Shelter of the Poor, p/ate 33 ofC.-N. Ledoux's L'Architecture... (1804), and detail showing the gods and the muses assembled in the clouds. he believed were inseparable from the dynamic of the Imagination. His willingness to transgress the rules enabled him to embody his theories as buildings, and at the same time to obscure both the meaning of the mythical discourse and his methods: would-be followers have been side? tracked (as illustrated by the formal obsessions of Lequeux), and historians deceived, by super? ficial appearances. Without the 'eye of the Imagination', the blind architect and the handicapped scholar will be unable to recognize in the massing of the Saline (plate 14) the three-dimensional representation of a drop of water (even though this is explicitiy mentioned in the accompanying commentary on p. 69), nor will they penetrate the optical wall around Ledoux's work and thought. Vidier observes that the visual demonstrations favoured in contemporary archaeological publi? cations ? such as Le Roy's views of Athens and Piranesi's of Rome18 ? would have provided 108 Ledoux with a semantic and structural model for his analytical approach to architecture, as if he were reassembling a whole out of its geometrical components. It would be tempting to extend the reference to the whole of his work, the projection of a dream city, reconstructed out of fragments from a place eroded by time, with its schematic structure barely visible on the surface, where it is defined only by axial markers. The line that links these scattered elements also links the spectator to the objects, resolving the differences of scale by means of an optical device ? the telescope in the case of the buildings, the magnifying glass in the case of the engravings. A closer look at one of the engravings, The Shelter of the Poor, plate 33 of LyArchitecture, will clarify such an approach to Ledoux's method. Vidier discusses this engraving within the con? text of 'moral' architecture, the 'primitive hut' and Ledoux's social typologies; and this indeed is the direction in which the commentary points, with its two linked inscriptions: 'The House of the Poor' (the tide of the text), and 'The Shelter of the Poor' (the allegorical engraving). His inter? pretation does not, however, take into account Ledoux's reference to an 'architect who built only for the poor', namely the alchemist Nicolas Flamel. At the time the text was written, one of FlameFs 'houses for the poor' still stood at 51 rue de Montmorency in Paris.19 A close examination of the engraving confirms this connection. Above Mercury's navel, the engraver (equipped with a magnifying glass) has placed the alchemical sign for Mercury. On the thigh there is an even smaller 'tattoo' which shows a crescent moon entwined with a heart, a symbol of the alchemical alliance of Eros and Psyche, achieved through the intervention of Mercury. In the hand of Jupiter, which is extended towards the couple, the number three confirms this new Trinity.20 Once we have focused on this sort of detail it is possible to discover a number of complementary clues. On the ground underneath the seated fig? ure on the island is inscribed the sequence '35 N 49 O'. These are the geographical co-ordinates of Mount Olympus on the island of Cyprus, if calculated in accordance with the lie de Fer ? then established as the prime meridian. Ledoux's choice of Olympus on the island of Venus as the setting for the marriage of Eros and Psyche con? firms not only an alchemical reading of the plate but also the unity of the discourse in the book. The inscription in the exergue, 'Omnia vincit amor', recalls the words spoken to Poliphilus21 just before he reached the island of Cythera, and here the island of Venus appears, immediately preceding the Entrance to the Saline de Chaux (plate 34), situated in the 'liquid plain', the double of another island, for another Prospero.22 It is also quite evident that Jupiter, who is drawn in more detail than any of the other gods, has the profile of King Henry IV of France, with his unmistakable Bourbon nose, a reference which is not surprising, given the widespread interest in Henry IV during the last years of the ancien regime : Ledoux himself kept a medallion portrait of the king in his room. In addition, the figures '1605' appear on the earth of the island below a cube of stone. Simon Studion, author of the 'Naometria', places around this very date a secret triple alliance between Henry IV, James I of Great Britain and Frederick of W?rttem? berg.23 It would seem reasonable to suppose that Ledoux had at some time had access to the manuscript cited by Frances Yates as 'describing the foundation stones of the Rosicrucian move? ment' . Some of the proofs of his plate 33 clearly show ? some years before the publication of the Fama by Christian R. C. Pourtant ? the in? scription 'ROI RC in the shading on Jupiter/ Henry IV's thigh. This coincidence is explained if we look closely at the bust of Ledoux in the frontispiece to UArchitecture and discover, hidden in the shading of the architect's lower lip, the inscription: '1768 ROSA'. AA FILES 24</page><page sequence="4">Ledoux's work should be read as a visual di? alogue. As he wrote (with reference to the eyes), we need only 'subdue distance in order to con? verse with the immortals'.24 Vidier relates The Shelter of the Poor to the ideas of Laugier and to economic typologies. This may be a valuable approach, but it neglects the layers of meaning in the engraving and thus he fails to attach its more specific meaning to topical developments. Moreover, Vidler's analysis of the 'influence of the milieu' might have incorporated an investi? gation of Ledoux's membership of a Hermetic order. However, this does not mean merely sub? stituting one symbolic context (the Rosicrucians) for another (the Masons). The tactic should be altogether different. It must attend to the fact that, beyond the well-documented place of Ledoux in the history of Rosicrucian illuminism and in the history of the Enlightenment, there is his precocious intellectual attachment to a universe ? mythical, historical and 'psychan thropic' ? which must radically alter our view of his engraved and built work. Not only would this universe, once revealed, disclose elements of a method which could play a part in bringing Le? doux's architecture to life from a formal and typological point of view, but it would also enable the reunification of an apparently hetero? geneous body of work. The revelation of Ledoux's work as the ex? pression of a constant 'setting' determined by a matrix of myths25 has certain critical conse? quences. First, historians will no longer be able to ignore certain problems relating to the work which was actually built, such as their plani metric and technical solutions so artfully pre? sented by Ledoux that they in fact emerge as highly abstruse or, in the engraved buildings, the obvious discrepancy between ground plan and function. It will become obvious that the crucial role of 'meaning' in Ledoux's work cannot be encompassed within the limits imposed by historians in their attempt to resituate him within the context of his profession and times. By tracing the sources of Ledoux's thought in the 'influence of the milieu', Vidier supplies an accurate account of the architect in his times and of the encounter between his ideas and those of the Enlightenment. But further work will be necessary to do justice to the architect's 'real method' ? of his thinking on technique and myth, on which this method was based and by which it was fertilized. And further work is needed to do justice to his contribution to the history of architecture no less than to the history of attitudes. Vidler's Ledoux therefore seems to be a tran? sitional work, lying somewhere between the first generation of criticism on Ledoux and the pre? misses of a new criticism, which is more con? cerned with presenting the 'artistic' dimension of the 'architect-painter' of a une realite futurible.

At present there is no single book which contains all of the architect's known graphic works, and no catalogue raisonne of the engravings ? some of which exist in six or more versions. However, re? prints and facsimile editions have made much of the work easily accessible. De Nobelle's compil? ation of drawings of 1962 was followed after a long interval by facsimiles of L'Architecture, vol. 1 (New York, 1980; N?rdlingen, 1981), Ramee's Paris edition of 1847 (Princeton, 1984), and a (very mediocre) version of the second volume of L'Architecture (N?rdlingen, 1984). In the past few years there have been several new compilations which contain the Theatre of Besancon, the projects in Aix-en-Provence and the barrier es of Paris. 3. The dossier of unknown works, now in the collec? tion of the Bibliotheque historique de la ville de Paris, was published in December 1991: M. Gallet and M. Mosser, Architecture de Ledoux: Inedits pour un tome III (Paris, 1992). D. Rabreau's long-awaited book on Ledoux may be published later this year, around the same time as the French version of the Vidier book. Both authors will have to take into account the recently discovered drawings and engravings, in particular the series of 'tetrapyle' country houses and the project for the Opera. These provide new information not only on Ledoux's later pro? grammes and typologies, but on certain published works, namely the reprints of the engravings, the French/English editions of 1846 and 1847, and the organization of the second volume, which was sold in 1806/7. The title page to a 'third volume' in the proposed series also confirms that L'Architec? ture represents a reworking of an existing concept. One day we may even see the 272 drawings in Russian collections, or the text of the second vol? ume, which was printed in 1807. 4. See S. Conard, Ledoux et le soleil, Arc et Senans (1979). 5. To facilitate a thematic reading of the chronology, Vidier separates Ledoux's private commissions during the ancien regime from his post Revolutionary projects, such as the development at Hosten. 6. 'In the distant lands of the Persians and Assyrians shall we seek the style that will be revived after twenty centuries. Invoke the powers of your soul ... for they will serve you better than the old tra? ditions' (p. 161, note). 7. Vidier refers to the 'Palladian' cube of 27 mod? ules, but a more profound analysis of Ledoux's work as a whole shows that he in fact used the three Pythagorean cubes (3, 4, 5) commonly found in Masonic and Hermetic symbolism. In the plans, he often used the 5x5 square: see, for example, the Rural School of Meillant or the Palace at Aix. 8. The barrier es were placed, with symbolic coher? ence, around a common ditch created by resituat ing the Cimetiere des Innocents ? as shown by J. F. Seznec's topographical study (compare Le? doux et le soleil, op. cit., chapter 5). Their design was in keeping with Ledoux's earlier work (such as the gatehouses to the Hallwyl, Uzes and Thelus son hotels) and with the monuments of Henry IV s reign (such as the Place des Vosges, the first square in Paris). Thus the barrieres might appear to exemplify an attempt to regulate the city, which was more closely tied to historical myths than to the policy of 'embellishment'. 9. The Director's Building, a 'temple of surveil? lance', is often compared with Bentham's Pan? opticon of fifteen years later. According to Vidier it was 'less a machine ? surveiller than a symbol of such surveillance'. But for Ledoux ? architect, painter and image-maker ? the crucial element was not the mechanism of surveillance, but rather its source, the Director. By placing an enormous globe in the hall of the Director's Building several years before the completion of the works, he sug? gested that the Director's 'universal surveillance' extended far beyond the walls of the factory. 10. For example, the suggested link between the three symbolic plates (33, 100 and 114) and the Theatre of Besancon would confirm the book's geographi? cal course between the two constructed buildings of the 'town of Chaux' (the factory and the theatre). 11. The graphic relation between the eye and the the? atre formed part of the iconography of texts on geometry (for example 'The theatre of Petitot in the form of an eye, observed through the crystal? line lens of the geometer', Parma, 1758). 12. Most historians now refute Ledoux's claim that the majority of the 'Utopian' houses were designed after 1773. None the less, a semicircular prototype for the Saline could be seen in the village of Arc, before 1745. Evidence of the first 'true' project for the Saline is provided by a site plan which shows the roads and the factory in a preliminary orient? ation ('Carte de la Foret de Chaux', B. B. Cartes et Plans, GE C9779). The proposed 'circular' Saline has the same diameter as the shaded circle around the village of Senans. With knowledge of the site, it is possible to reconstruct numerous other 'submerged' models for the 'Utopian' typologies: the engraving of the Coopers' Build? ing, for example, combines the plan and elevation of the circular village of Rennes sur Lo?e. These models were inscribed both in Ledoux's history of the 'valley of Love' and in the myths of the central site of the town of Chaux. They appear to suggest that Ledoux's formulation of types started much earlier than is generally supposed. 13. In this respect Vidier's bibliography is pointillist. 14. The projects for Aix provided Ledoux with the opportunity to emphasize the relation between 'character and physiognomy', or the human body and the architectural image. The facades of the prisons of Aix were endowed with personality: 'For the 'tetes parlantes' of the executed criminals, 109</page><page sequence="5">[Ledoux] substituted 'murs parlants'. The 'sci? ence' of physiognomy had been elaborated by J. C. Lavater in the 1770s. Its basic premise was that not only character but also destiny was re? vealed in the form or features of the body. Thus the grounds for the condemnation of a criminal would be legible in his cranium. 15. Plutarch, quoted by J. Brengues in La Franc maqonnerie du bois (Rennes, 1973), pp. 223-4. 16. Brengues (ibid. p. 185) suggests that around 1774 the Duke of Aiguillon may have been 'one of the founders of a new rite, la Fenderie, which harked back to the sylvan origins' of the Masons. 17. J. and E. De Goncourt, La Du Barry (Paris, 1926). 18. Although less accessible than the archaeological engravings, certain groups of drawings may have had an important documentary role. One example is the set of drawings of the megalithic cities of Malta that Houel prepared for William Beckford before the latter's journey to Aix-en-Provence. 19. The section through the salt-workers' building, paired with the section through the gatehouse to the Saline on plate 36, may be seen as the super imposition of the plan and the elevation of Flamel's 'house for the poor', engraved by Ledoux around the middle of the century. Vidier points out several examples of the same technique of develop? ing an image by superimposition: the drawing of the eye on plate 114, for instance, shows the plan of the Theatre of Besancon, reconstructed as a three-dimensional image and superimposed on the perspective view of the reflected auditorium. The tone of the commentary on this building ? 'A meeting place . . . [where] a fire that never cools embraces ... those whom Providence has brought together' ? is the same as that on the Shelter of the Poor (the preceding plate), where 'happiness . . . [is] offered at little expense ... [to men who] earn only six sous a day' (p. 110). 20. The figures representing the plate number are rounded at the top, in contrast to those in the rest of the book. This would have attracted the atten? tion of readers, and prepared them for the discov? ery of the flat-topped '3' in Jupiter's hand. 21. At the end of the eigtheenth century the architect J.-G. Legrand made a French translation, and Hermetic exegesis, of the Poliphili Hypneroto machia. 22. The emphasis on antique or Palladian models in in? terpretations of the theatre of Ledoux has over? shadowed his links with the world of Shakespeare. The frontispiece to Robert Fludd's Ars memoriae (quoted by F. Yates, see note 23) might have prompted Ledoux to reconstruct the oculus imaginationis with reference not only to Hermetic architecture but to the Globe Theatre and its first production after the fire of 1613 ? The Tempest. In Fludd's engraving, the rays issuing from the 'eye' of the imagination illuminate Prospero's ship ? thus the theatrical text of 1804 may have been based on an archetype documented in the books of the magician from Milan. 23. F. Yates, TheRosicrucianEnlightenment(London, 1972). 110 24. The Rosicrucian fraternity designated its members as 'Invisible' or 'Immortal'. 25. This mythical matrix, which has well-documented origins in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, may shed new light on the 'pre-Romantic', 'chi valric nostalgia' of the architect's patrons or the 'primitivism' of his forms.
