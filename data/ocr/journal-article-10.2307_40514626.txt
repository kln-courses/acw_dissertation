LABELLE PRUSSIN We made the iron supple unto [David], Saying: "Make thou long coats of mail." - Koran xxxiv, io - 13 [David is identified with Malkut, the base of Kabbalah's Sephirotic Tree. David is frequently invoked in the prayers and genealogies of West African blacksmiths.] In 1970, while doing architectural fieldwork in Jenne, Mali, I was received in the Sorko (Bozo) village of Kolenze on the Upper Niger Delta by the local chief. Leaning against one of the earthen walls of his court- yard was this truly remarkable rust-covered iron oil lamp, distinguished from humbler neighbors elsewhere by the exquisite intri- cacy of its workmanship and design (frontis- piece). Called &amp; fitula, it was lit once a year for the Tabaski feast.1 Having effected its transport back to Jenne, I followed local instructions given for its conservation and spent endless evening hours cleaning off the rust with detergent and straw, marveling at the complexity of its three-dimensional armature, the multitude of precisely arranged oil containers, the proliferation of terminal volutes, and the thin, leaf-like "foliage" stemming from it. I imagined the fitula set outside against a dark blue sky, in a Sahelian landscape of honey-colored sand devoid of vegetation, conjuring images from the Arabian desert. Lit in the darkness of night, it evoked the imagery of a flaming bush. Exploring research materials back home, I came across photographs of two similar lamps in situ. One almost identical lamp {culta fini nanchorì) was photographed in 1964 in the Kolenze courtyard of the "Numu" blacksmith Souri Tenentao (fig. 2). Another more modest fitula was attributed to the Songhay-speaking Bozo who traverse the Delta waterways, and it was used to argue the Islamic presence in West African design.2 Years later, it occurred to me that the fitula might serve admirably as a Christmas tree, and my first thought was that a box of Hanukkah candles would be more than adequate. I quickly discovered, however, that the pre-packed Hanukkah candle boxes contain precisely forty-four candles (related to the eight-day ritual of lighting them sequentially), whereas the oil lamp required forty-six, perhaps a reference to the prophet Mohamed's dreams and prophesies. My recent incursions into the realm of Judaic Africa have led me to expand on the Islamic inspiration initially implied by this reference.3 Oil Lamp, Mali, 19th century. Iron, h. 142 cm.

Drawing by Barbara Paxson. The lamp is constructed of a central ver- tical shaft from which four secondary stems branch out from below (defining four cardi- nal directions) and converge above into a pair of ornate volutes that define its front and back (fig. 3a- b). On the main axis, just below the four expanding stems, are two hemispherical cups, and above the four con- verging stems is a similar set of three pairs. Three pairs of similar size are welded to the central stem, four smaller cups are welded to two of the secondary stems, and six pairs of even smaller cups are attached to the other two. The total sum is thus organized into a numerical combination of three, four, seven, ten, fourteen, and twenty-two, all numbers that figure in indigenous African myths of origin, in Islamic Sufism, and, as I recently discovered, in Judaic Kabbalah - a revealing testimony to the complex interfaces and interstices among these various belief systems. Although I could not discern a signature on the lamp (there may be one), there is an abundance of inscribed geometric designs b. Diagrammatic plan, Yale Oil Lamp. Drawing by Barbara Paxson. c.

These designs, symmetrically repeated on each side of the lamp, are partic- ularly evocative of the patterning commonly inscribed and/or engraved on contemporary metalwork of the Tuareg people to the north, and of the straight-line quality of Tuareg tifinar script. What could be the inspiration, the genesis, and the odyssey of this remarkably conceived, skillfully executed, three-dimensional, moving iron sculpture ? Until quite recently, the Sahara Desert was presumed to be an impenetrable barrier to cultural exchange between West Africa and its neighbors in both North Africa and on the European continent, and studies of material culture and artistic creativity among cultures, both sedentary and itinerant, were tightly circumscribed by linguistic definition and cultural affiliation. And yet the Sahara has been a sea of social and economic dis- course, intercourse, and exchange over at least two millennia- a bridge and a highway that linked north and south not only polit- ically, commercially, and economically, but culturally as well (fig. 1). These trans- Saharan links involved strategies that often depended on a set of respected, mutually reinforcing, concurrent roles as traders- cum- scholars- cum -artisans, whose multifunctional implications have rarely, if ever, been consid- ered.4 Traversing the Saharan routes in war and peace within the context of- and often dependent upon - indigenous itinerancy, nomadic Berber and Judeo-Berber popula- tions, Muslims, and Jews were all a conduit not only for the transmission of belief sys- tems and literacy but also for conceptual design processes and the technological skills of select artisanries. The complexity of these multidimensional roles had far-reaching consequences for innovative aesthetic expres- sion, but there is an almost complete lacuna in the archival and archaeological resources on their roles as artisans. Although there is considerable archaeo- logical and archaeo-epigraphic evidence for a Jewish presence during the Punic and Roman periods in North Africa, and tradi- tions and traces of Jewish origin and prac- tices among Berber tribes of the Sahara have been addressed and documented by scholars in various disciplines, the very nature of the corpus of Jewish literature has left the his- toric Jewish presence and influence south of the Sahara shrouded in obscurity. Islamic sources are equally silent on the Jewish presence: their position under Islam (that is, their dhimmi condition), the enforced recruiting/transfer of Jewish craftsmen under the various caliphs, and their forced conver- sion to Islam all militated against references that might shed light not only on their pres- ence but on their artisanal roles: throughout the Muslim world, Judaic contributions were often subsumed under the generic term "Islamic" art.5 Similar difficulties exist in the historic European accounts of the West African coast, where vagaries about the spe- cific services fulfilled by artisans in indige- nous societies where issues of identity, migration patterns, the nature of conversion, and demise were exacerbated by a deteriorat- ing climate and impermanent materials. How then is one to trace the genealogy of the lamp when the scarcity of field study and historic sources is compounded by the diminution and distancing of inherent meaning in time and space? For me, its historic reconstruction involved piecing together and reinterpreting seemingly unre- lated and sometimes questionable written sources, then interweaving them with tech- nological analogy and style in technology, visual imagery, conceptual vocabularies, and multivalent collective memories and experiences, much like an archaeological jigsaw puzzle. 3d.

The historic reconstruction of ironworking on the African continent has evoked much speculation and controversy, but its early spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa is clearly evident from ancient sites stretching from northern Nige- ria to the Middle Senegal Valley. While many of these smelter sites remain in situ and in the collective memory, however, archeologi- cal evidence for the forged end products are rare. Smelting implies a sedentary lifestyle, whereas forging, which requires few, easily transportable tools, often accompanies an itinerant lifestyle. In West African cultures, there is a clear distinction between those who mine, extract, and smelt the iron and those who forge it. Critical cultural and styl- istic differences also emerge when forging and casting processes are considered in tandem: wrought iron, a handcrafted, highly individual creation, is easily forged or welded, its end product resulting in an elegant quality that combines geometry and curved structural forms, whereas cast-iron technology, equally ancient in the historical record, involves an additional set of related skills that produce a hard, brittle, nonmal- leable product. The interface between fur- nace and forge and its cultural complexities have been dealt with at great length by schol- ars of African art history, but the aesthetic consequences of these various iron technolo- gies-style in technology- have rarely been considered. Forging, at the foundation of all cultures and all times, is a versatile process of creating volumetric forms by pushing or hammering heated, malleable metal on an anvil or a wooden block, front and back, and it is appropriate to any scale. The forging tech- niques used to create the fitula are "sinking and raising," riveting and engraving, ancient techniques that require only a hammer and a solid form against which the metal is bent. Riveting consists of sliding a rod through a small hole in order to lock two flat surfaces together. In contrast to casting (used else- where in West Africa), the stems, the volutes, the hemispheric containers, the simulated leaves, and the engraved surface patterns of the fitula were all created on the forge.7 THE VOCABULARY OF THE FITULA: LITERACY, SECRECY, AND G EM ATRI A The shape and form of the functional hemi- spherical oil containers of the fitula can be found on a range of other ironwork prod- ucts, from domestic containers to jewelry components, from elements of armor to an array of structural and decorative architec- tural details. A unique feature is its multiple volutes, all reminiscent of rams' horns as well as the classic stance of Dogon sculptural forms. Another unique feature, projecting in abundance on all sides, is the delicate, skill- fully worked arabesque "leaves" and "stems" so suggestive of vegetation. In wrought-iron technology, the volute termini that emerge from the forge are both a structural requisite and an aesthetic enhancement, but spirals and arabesques are also universally symbolic: like the cross, the square, the triangle, and the circle, the spiral, underlying the foundation of not only con- cept, ritual, and performance throughout history, finds expression in both graphic and spatial design.8 Equally ubiquitous in both West African archaeology and contemporary life, the use of spirals on hair combs and pins evokes the figurai association with the geo- anthropomorphic symbolism that pervades the sub-Saharan African aesthetic (fig. 4). And yet, the ram that is traditionally slaugh- tered for the Tabaski feast tempts one to ponder the iconic association with the rams' horns of African mythology.9 The multiple role of trader- o/ra-scholar- a/ra-artisan that unfolded in the trans- Saharan world depended upon literacy and often involved secrecy, and the introduction 94</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 4a.

Many of the graphic systems that constitute the written languages of Africa are, to this day, enveloped in a spirit of secretiveness that governed the very conditions of their creation.10 By con- sidering geometry as a graphic representation of number and space, the shape and form of the fitula can also be interpreted as a design construct: numbers have been translated into three dimensions, eloquently communicat- ing the symbolic space of cosmogony, much like the elegance of medieval cathedrals, which also rest, to a great extent, on the elo- quence of number, space, time, and place. In both Islamic Sufism and Judaic Kab- balah, these graphic systems (derivative of Pythagorean symbolism and Euclidean b-d. Hairpins, 20th century, from Koa and Kolenze.

The script from archaeo-epigraphic finds near Tegdaoust, Mauritania, Hebraic Kabbalistic syllabaries such as ibranniya (" characteres à lunettes') on magic squares and amulets, and letters from an early Muslim treatise on alchemy all end in ringlets and spirals that evoke both a visual and conceptual association with the hemispheric oil cups on the fitula. It is the suggested Muslim borrowing of ibranniya letters from the earliest Kabbalah literature that invites an extended interpretation of the design concept underlying the fitulas construct.12 The numbers three, four, and seven are commonly found throughout a wide range of West African rituals and genealogies,13 but the number twenty-two, equally ubiquitous in their mythologies, is unusual in tradi- tional Muslim numerology. The mythic itin- erary of the nomadic Peul migrations include references to the first twenty-two cows who accompanied their ancestor Tyanaba and the twenty-two stages of their westward route. The Mande myth of creation enumerates the twenty-two villages associated with the ritual of Faro, while among the ancestral Dogon smiths, the twenty-two main families of cat- egories became known as the "twenty-two teeth of Nommo," and the Tuareg black- smiths enumerate twenty-two generations in their lineages.14 To be sure, the oil containers of the fitula are arranged on the various stems in very clearly defined twin clusters of three, four, and seven, but it is the sum of their combinations - ten, fourteen, and twenty- two, the sacred letters -a/ra-numbers 96</page><page sequence="10">of the Hebrew alphabet particularly specific to the Kabbalistic tradition - that is reflected, above its base, on each side of the lamp (fig. 3a). cosmic tree: tree of life, tree of knowledge, tree of light When the lantern shaft is planted in the ground and all its wicks are lit, the delicately worked arabesque iron "leaves" and "stems" projecting on all four sides create an image remarkably evocative of what has variously been referred to as a Cosmic Tree - a Tree of Life, a Tree of Knowledge, a Tree of Light. It has been suggested that the earliest symbolic representations of these various Trees (which may have reached Christianity and Islam through Jewish sepulchral art during the late Hellenistic period) unfolded during the Middle Ages, particularly in North Africa, with the widespread proliferation of a "practical" Kabbalah.15 In Zohar, the basic Kabbalah text, the divine act and attributes of creation and their ten distinct stages of emanation (Sefirot) are often rendered as a Tree of Life or a Tree of Light, whose Sefirot are its stem, its branches, leaves and blossoms, and root. Its crown is Keter {Ein Sofi infinity; nothing- ness) and its base is Malkhut (kingdom; asso- ciation with David and the lower world). Illustrative diagrams of this concept have varied over time, but their geometry always preserves a similar armature (fig. 6). Cosmic trees, growing in the Garden of Paradise, are equally a part of the Islamic tradition. Stemming from the late classical candelabra tree motifs found further east, similar classical candelabra trees, rendered in multiple ways on both secular and religious architecture, were particularly popular in al-Andalus and equally prevalent in North Africa. Rendered naturally on the wall behind the mihrab of the ninth-century Great Mosque of Kairouan, Tunisia, and on the mihrab ana. minbar of the twelfth- century Almoravid mosque in Tlemsen, Algeria, they continue to be woven into f EIN-SOF I f KETER J Í RINAH j ÍhOKHMAHJ (gEVURAhJ f HESED J TtiferetJ ( HOD j ÍNETZAHJ T YESOD j (malkhutJ Fig. 6.

Much as an architect might use a two-dimensional representation on paper as a building guide, the ingenious anonymous blacksmith may well have done the same, transforming a visual model into a three- dimensional icon. THE BLACKSMITH CREATORS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA Ancient indigenous African traditions attribute the descent of the various black- smith castes from Abraham, David, or Noah - or from Yemen and Egypt - who would have spread in the course of their ongoing exodus through Egypt and the Sudan and across the continent.18 Reputedly of Jewish origin, they were historically sub- sumed under the aegis and auspices of diverse ruling polities. As a Jewish metal- smith from the Atlas mountains once noted, "We traveled through different memshalot (governments) and for us craftsmen there were no borders."19 Among the Maures and the Tuareg, metalworking - and its corollary leatherworking - are the only arti- sanal activities restricted to endogamous groups, and in West Africa, among the Senufo, the Songhay, and the Dogon, vir- tually all the terms used to designate these castes are of foreign origin.20 Iron has mighty power, and historically, the blacksmiths throughout the world con- currently invoked fear and awe via the power of alchemy and secrecy that was attributed to them.21 Throughout North and West Africa, the blacksmiths also lie at the base of many indigenous primordial cosmogonie myths that reflect the conceptual association between blacksmithing castes and the djinn. The djinn are a special race of subterranean human beings, generally evil, sometimes benevolent, believed to be in constant con- tact with mankind. In North Africa, they were not infrequently associated with the gnaoua (black musicians), Satan, David, and the Jews. According to Islamic tradition, the metiers of the forge, of metals and minerals, are in rapport with subterranean fire, thus with hell, since the subterranean region is peopled by the djinn.22 Iron was a powerful protection against the djinn, but paradoxi- cally, the blacksmiths were also considered to be in league with them. The Upper Niger Delta, where the fitula was found, was for many centuries under Songhay rule, and in its history there are extensive references to the former Bani Israel inhabitants of the region and to the help of the djinn in the investiture of Cheik Askia Muhamed in the late fifteenth century, via the agency of Chamharouch, the king of the djinn.23 A suggested nineteenth-century revi- sion of the same account also enumerated a set of "servile artisan castes" taken by the Askia Mohamed and attached to Songhay rule, among whom were the sames e ko and the diam-ouali (goldsmiths), the diam-tene and the diam-kiria (blacksmiths), and the komé, a caste of praise-singers or griots usu- ally associated with the metalworking arti- sans. All five castes attributed their origin to the same progenitor. There is also a host of references to the places inhabited by the djinn in Mauritania, and some decades ago, a detailed study recorded a centuries-old (1830s) belief that there was still a djinn called bennani living in Tichit, Mauritania. The many amulets (djedwat) examined all involved a divination system of gematria that permitted correspon- dence with the djinn and contained verses 98</page><page sequence="12">from the Koran, Hebrew words and num- bers, as well as the secret ibranniya script above.24 And yet, paradoxically, the blacksmith's art was traditionally respected, and its practi- tioners were often poets and men of letters. The honorific mallam (both a Muslim and Hebraic term) was, and continues to be, used in both worlds, as well as in Islamized sub-Saharan Africa, to designate a patron, a scholar, a linguist, an interpreter, a political or religious leader, as well as a fine artisan. In Spanish Morocco and Mauritania, the members of the blacksmith caste who make the simulated damascene coffers mentioned below (fig. 7a- b) are also addressed by the honorific mallam. There are abundant tradi- tions that attribute an Israelite origin to the blacksmiths, and the term mallam was at one time used synonymously with the majarrero, a close cognate of mehadjeria, the derogatory Arabic term for converts to Islam. This synonymous use of the terms mu allem and muhadjerin assumes historic import in the light of another paradox and enigma, the association of the term Muallim with the much-scorned legendary Bafour in an Ara- bised Mauritania. According to an indige- nous interpreter, Malamine Tandia, "The Mallams, who descended from the Bafours, are the Yaouds. They make and have always made, the works of art; one calls them Yaouds because, according to legend, only the Jews in Mauritania were the artisans. The Mallams have neither birthplace nor tribe. ... It is they who taught the autochthonous Berbers iron working; they were Jews of race," reflecting, it would seem, the reproachful attitude toward metalwork- ing in Islamic North Africa.25 Arriving in Mauritania from the Mzab region in North Africa via a long halt in the Moroccan oases, the Mallams became attached to notable Maurish families, formed the caste of muallemiriy and in a slow migration trans- mitted their skills, father to son, to regions that roughly correspond to present-day northern Mali.

There is another tradition, equally rele- vant, albeit questionable, that also attributes to the Bafours the "introduction of music" into the Maurish Sahara. Their descendants were the professional musicians called iggawan- that is, the griots, similarly lowly and despised, whose association with the blacksmithing castes is echoed to this day.2 A tantalizing historic reference to the tradi- tion of shared ancestry, paralleling Songhay society above, can be found not only in the early sixteenth-century account of Johao Rodriguez, a Portuguese visitor to the city of Wadan in 1493, but in various subsequent accounts of European visitors, including Rene Caillié, who noted the guehuesy "whose song, music, and jugglery enlivened the Tabaski feast among the Maures."27 In the Ahaggar in northern Mali and in Niger, the Tuareg, blacksmiths (enaden), many of whom claim to originally have come from these very regions, and who I thought of as I initially cleaned the fitula, were also often addressed with the honorific muallim, and in a text recorded in 1922, the head of the Tuareg Kel- An tassar clan referred back to the Beni Israel.2 These itinerant blacksmiths were feared and respected, renowned as interpreters and intermediaries in local court adjudication and as praise singers; their much-discussed Judaic heritage has been accepted, albeit cautiously, by almost all scholars. As Dominique Casajus notes, many enaden claim descent from King David and some even produce genealogies that trace their families to him.29 Other more reliable tradi- tions depict them as descendants of Moroc- can Jews who fled to the Sahara following Almohad persecution. Although despised by other Tuareg, they speak a more refined tamachek, are highly versed in the group s culture, are talented poets, storytellers, singers, and dancers - and demarcate their genealogy in twenty- two categories. 100</page><page sequence="14">GENESIS By viewing the fitula as a deliberate manipu- lation of space and materials into a visual construct (a moving three-dimensional, cere- monial, architectural construct) reflecting ideas, related examples that involve spatial discourse (anthropomorphism, mobility, and enclosure) invite comparison. By exten- sion, the vocabulary elements used to create the fitula in West Africa can be found in a number of related spatial contexts extending across the Sahara and throughout the North African Magreb. The association between architecture and the human body is universal, and architec- ture is like clothing: enveloping and protect- ing space, the design of both is all about entrances and exits. Until recently, fibulae were used by women in Africa to fasten a wrapped cloth around their bodies, much as they were once used to secure enveloping Roman togas, performing both a functional and apotropaic role. A recently acquired archeological collection of "fibulae" with traces of gold damascene from Aoudaghost, Mauritania, whose design was obviously based on the extension of volutes into a pair of matching spirals, was obviously the equivalent of amulets (fig. 7c). Similar gold fibulae, made by the diam (goldsmiths), were recorded in Timbuktu at the turn of the twentieth century, and silver ones were still being worn by Mauritanian women at mid-century. Conceptually related in the spatial context, the fibulae bear a close resemblance to the locks and hasps (sarsar) on the portable wooden chests and coffers (sanduq) in which one's valuables are secreted and stored, and which itinerant blacksmiths (muallemin-cum-majarreros) continue to create in the Western Sahara and Mauritania (figs. 7a-b).30 The architecture of nomadism provides the setting for another design parallel. As itinerants, blacksmithing families lived "under the tent," and their endogamous wives (the muallima) continue to create the various leather furnishings associated with their lifestyle, such as pillows and leather sacks. Identical terms are used in reference to the design motifs on both coffers and pillows, so it is equally no surprise that the central motifs on the pieces created in the nomadic architectural context replicate a floor plan projection or layout of the fitula (fig. 7d). The North African and Saharan ksars, where the enclosed spaces of the closely linked residential compounds are announced by massive wooden doors, offer the most fertile field of comparison: door planks are secured and reinforced with wrought-iron fluted discs, protective hasps, knockers, sturdy ornate hinges, and bold rivets. These applied accoutrements, concurrently per- forming a structural and an iconographie role in the daily life of compound occupants, suggest another source of inspiration for the elements that constitute the fibulas technol- ogy and vocabulary. Nowhere in medieval Europe did the Jews develop their arts and crafts to such a degree as on the Iberian Peninsula- during both its Islamic and its Christian history. The blacksmiths (haddads and ferraros) were particularly renowned among the various metalworking artisanries, and the cast-iron door escutcheons, pulls, and knockers on late fifteenth-century Hispanic doors may have come from their hands (fig. 8a). In the wake of the Sephardic diasporas, many migrated to North Africa and the Mediter- ranean Basin, carrying a design template in their heads and a literate familiarity with then-current Kabbalistic thought. Inge- niously they would have transformed the iron escutcheons, pulls, and knockers from the Iberian Peninsula into the forged and wrought-iron counterparts that form the hallmark of doors at the main entrances of walled ksars, family residences, and mosques on the North African coast (figs. 8b -c). The fitulas oil containers are forged in precisely the same way. These massive doors were often sup- ported by, and swung on, intricately worked 101</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 8a.

The fingers of these hinges, both functioning and nonfunctioning, are particularly evocative of the ubiquitous North African hamsa- the hand-shaped amulet-pendants worn to ward off the evil eye.32 The fitulas leaves, easily recognized as a curved version of these door-hinge "fingers," seem to have been integrated into the context of a Tree of Life. Logic suggests that the remarkable wrought-iron appliqué work on the doors of the ancient cities of Walata, Tichit, and Wadan in Mauritania, so similar to those in North Africa, may have come from the hands of the haddads-cum-muallims-cum- majarreros above, in the wake of the Moroc- can invasion of 1591 (figs. 9a-b). The strik- ing similarity between the door latches and those used on the coffers is further empha- sized by the similarity of the entirety of the door design with the pendants- c#?ra-amulets 102</page><page sequence="16">Fig. 9a.

The composite door design can be viewed as a prophylactic amulet writ large, protecting interior, private space from the outside world of strangers. Because he was also a maker of armor and arms, the blacksmith was indispensable in times of war. Jewish warriors and armorers participated in the Almoravid army of conquest that moved north into the Iberian Peninsula, and there are a number of centuries-old references to Jewish arms purveyors and producers in North Africa, whose reputation persisted into the twenti- eth century.33 Ironworking - as well as literacy and the gold trade - also traveled south hand in hand with Moroccan military expansion across the Sahara.

Timbuktu and the Upper Niger Delta- undoubtedly contributed to its success.34 Participants in the invasion, many of whom were "renegades" from Spain and Portugal, presumably carried protective, shell-like sword and rapier hilts similar to those used in near-contemporary Iberian military operations elsewhere.35 The adaptation of wrought-iron armor remnants to door escutcheons (fig. 9c) suggests another step in the genesis of the fitulas oil containers. The sheaths of such swords and rapiers were sometimes damascened in gold and silver, a process that involved a close working relationship between blacksmiths and gold- smiths, much like the famous sword of the Sultan Beobdil (on display at the Generalife in the Alhambra), who fled Granada to Morocco in 1492. In Islamic North Africa, it was the Jewish blacksmiths -ram-goldsmiths who, until recently, maintained a virtual monopoly over these techniques.3 The extension of this interface into sub-Saharan Africa is reflected in the mid-nineteenth- century plate of a Maurish "goldsmith" who is referred to as a "blacksmith from whom the Wolof goldsmiths learned their skills" in an accompanying commentary (fig. 9d).37 Like the fibulae above, an archaeological prototype for the well-known iron Tuareg locks, keys, and knives (which now use brass and copper) also had traces of gold dama- scene on it.3 In an Islamized cultural envi- ronment that frowned on the usurious impli- cations of gold, the substitution of so-called base metals suggests a rationale for the use of more readily available, affordable, and acceptable materials such as brass and copper, the development of a substitute technology, appliqué, for the wooden coffers above, and the acceptable involvement by Islamic blacksmiths. An intriguing contemporary end product of the genesis are the qarqalla (clappers) used by the gnaoua musicians, who trace their genealogies to the black slaves brought north across the Sahara under Muslim rule, but who, in North Africa, are paradoxically also 104</page><page sequence="18">considered expert at expelling the djinn (fig. io).39 Their design, identical to the escutcheon- a/w-flanges used in other con- texts, places in context the historic references to the Judaic origin of blacksmiths and iggaouen and the well-documented ethno- graphic record of the endogamous relation- ship between blacksmiths and praise-singers. The visual expression of space has been dra- matically transformed into the aural and verbal expression of performance. How convincing is the evidence, both docu- mented and implied, for a Judaic contribu- tion to the odyssey of a design vocabulary and its related technology from Andalusia to North Africa, and across the Sahara to Kolenze in the West African northern savan- nah ? Its persuasiveness lies, I believe, in the historic sociocultural diversity and lifestyle of the castes of itinerant blacksmiths who traversed this vast terrain tools in hand, forg- ing the iron obtained from sedentary smelt- ing neighbors along the way. It is from their hands that these related shapes and images emerged - images that they carried down in long-extinct written sources or their heads, and translated into a technological style and design realities - and which in time perme- ated their peripatetic ateliers. Judeo-Berber and/or Jewish itinerants, they were, like the gnaoua, primarily strangers in the societies they served, often attached as endogamous castes to their ruling hosts, both peripatetic and sedentary. Decades ago, while sharing thoughts on Islamic design in sub-Saharan Africa with a colleague, I was told: "You see and hear what you want to." True, solutions to problems often depend on how they are defined: any line of inquiry, whether in fieldwork, the literature, or the archives, is equally and selectively conditioned by one's personal perspective. By exploring a construct that involved a complex panoply of richness grounded in an African convivencia of indigenous culture, Judaica and Islam, the lamp reflects a complex mnemonic wealth Fig. io. Gnaoua in performance using wrought iron clappers (qarqalla), Ouarzazate, Morocco. Photo: Cynthia Becker. 105</page><page sequence="19">of iconography and cosmogony. Once a cultural practice is transplanted, it changes by the very fact of its introduction into a new context, but change does not preclude the persistence of unique attributes. Its origi- nal meaning has not been lost, but rather transformed. The concept of historic distance suggests an appropriate ending to this tale of "no more forever." "New meaning cannot be made of the past unless the patterns dis- cerned there can be reworked in the context of the present. ... Yet the value of the new pattern will be revealed only if those earlier traces can still be brought to mind."40 Like every creative work, the fitula, as a multi- lingual metaphor, is a paradigm of process. Forged from the working house of thought, revealing the transformation of past into present, its multifaceted iconographie testi- mony to the complex and creative interfaces, interstices, and symbioses that characterize African cultures and concepts invites a broader historic perspective of the African process of artistic creativity. I would like to thank Mary Jo Arnoldi for help in obtaining a photograph of the lamp from Tervuren, John Shoup and Cynthia Becker for updated field information from Mauritania and Morocco, the librarians in the Jewish Division of the New York Public Library, and the many readers who suggested revisions to this paper. The map is by Eric Ross and line drawings are by Barbara Paxson. i. For the broad geocultural distribution of simpler versions of this lamp, see Patrick R. McNaughton, The Mande Blacksmiths (Bloomington: Indiana Uni- versity Press, 1988). This type of lamp has previously been documented zs fitinew or Jutenaw among the Bamana; fetila, firine, fitinew, and fitinaw among the Soninke, the Khassonke, and the Mandinka; and fetinew among the Senufo. They were also found in use among the Sorko, the Bobo, the Dogon, the Nupe, and the Yoruba. Well into the mid-twentieth century, the Songhay term for lamp was alfunar (of Arabic derivation) and the term for the wick itself was fitila korfo. See R. E Haquard and R. P Dupuis, Manuel de la langue sonay (Paris: Maisonneuve, 1897), and P A. Prost, La langue Sonay et ses dialectes (Dakar: IFAN, 1956). In Morocco, the term qendil is used for similar oil lamps; a related term, meqass del-fiila (archaic Spanish filete, the delicate arabesque on archi- tectural moldings) evokes an etymological origin. See A. Delpy, "Note sur la ferronerie marocaine," Cahiers des Arts et Techniques d'Afrique du Nord 6 (Toulouse: Editions Privat, 1960-61). The Tabaski fete (Feast of Abraham) is observed during the last month of the Muslim lunar year. The Berber term tabaski (rams' horns), whose suggested derivation is from the Hebrew for 'spring' {pesalo), was absorbed into African usage; the Tuareg terms (afasko or tafisko) and the Soninke and Wolof terms (tabaski dya) are related.

Numu refers to the specialized blacksmith caste of artisan clans (nyamakala) in the Manding world. 3. In its formative stages, Islam incorporated many religious, legal, and moral conceptions from the Abrahamic tradition, and even after the boundaries between Islam and Judaism were drawn, Jews and Muslims, particularly in Africa, continued to share many beliefs and practices.

Medieval Hebrew sayings such as "A craft is a kingdom" and "Great is labor, for it honors its practicers" are reflected in Maimonides' commentaries that included descriptions of building technology and architectural drawings.

Repousse and damascene, while related to the forge, require more malleable metals and thinner sheets, and finer techniques. Damascene is a form of inlay in which areas of a metal surface are chiseled away and contrasting metals are soldered in place. Overlay or appliqué, in which sheet brass, copper, and silver (or "white" metal) is affixed with rivets to the incised recesses of a wooden base, involves far less skill and labor time. 8.

In Jewish folklore, popular superstition, and magic, three is the most favored and potent mystical number. The number five is a symbol of the Tetragrammaton, the number ten is equated with the Ten Sephiroth of Kabbalah, the number fourteen is equated with Shad- dai (God), and the number twenty- two is associated with the sacred letters of the Hebrew alphabet. See Louis Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews (Baltimore: The John Hopkins University Press, 1998). For the translation of Sufi belief into geometry and architecture see Nader Ardalan and Laleh Bakhtiar, The Sense of Unity (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1973). The Sufi "science of letters" also sees the origin of Divine Expression in Arabic let- ters and their numeric equivalents: three reflects the fundamental conception of spirit, soul, and body that makes up creation; four relates to the four elements - directions, winds, quarters of the universe, and gate- ways to heaven; and the number seven (the four quar- ters of the twenty-eight-letter Arabic alphabet) also has great cosmological significance. 12.
