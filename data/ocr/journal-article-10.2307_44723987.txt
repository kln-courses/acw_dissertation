Neathery General Motors Research Laboratories NUMEROUS PAPERS on the response of the human chest to blunt frontal impact have been presented at previous Stapp Car Crash Conferences and elsewhere. Patrick, Kroell, and Mertz (1)* presented a paper in 1965 describing the re- sponse of embalmed cadavers when their chests were sub- jected to simulated car crash conditions. In this early study, the cadavers were allowed to impact an instrumented chest load surface as a crash simulation sled was decelerated. Addi- tional results were reported by the same authors (2) in 1967. Nahum, et al. (3), reported on studies in which fresh and em- balmed cadavers were stationary while an instrumented mass impacted the chest. Kroell, Schneider, and Nahum (4) re- ported additional results using this same technique in 1971. In these last two studies, a 6 in (152 mm) diameter impactor with masses of 3.6-52 lb (1.63-23.6 kg) impacted the cadavers at velocities ranging from 9-32 mph (4.02-14.3 m/s). The data of Refs. 3 and 4 will be referred to as Kroell data in this ♦Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. paper. Stalnaker, et al. (5), used a similar test arrangement in which the impact velocity varied from 12-15 mph (5.35- 6.71 m/s), but the impacting mass was only 22 lb (10.0 kg). A major difference between this study and the others was that the impacting mass was stopped after some fixed displace- ment of the impactor. The data of Ref. 5 will be referred to as Stalnaker data in this paper. RESPONSE CORRIDORS - In Lobdell, Kroell, et al. (6), Kroell proposed performance requirements, in the form of response corridors, for anthropometric test dummies when they are impacted in a manner similar to the impacts in his cadaver studies. Low-speed, 43 lb (19.5 kg), 1 1 mph (4.92 m/s) tests and high-speed, 51 lb (23.1 kg), 16 mph (7.15 m/s) tests were specified. The basis of the response corridors was an "eyeball average" of the collected response data. The load levels were uniformly increased 150 lb (667 N) to estimate the probable muscle tensing of a car occupant exposed to a collision environment. The adjusted averaged cadaver re- sponse data and the resulting corridors are shown in Fig. 1. In the low-speed data, skeletal deflection had been measured, ABSTRACT The chest impact data of Kroell, et al., and Stalnaker, et al., were examined to determine the relationships that might exist between the physical characteristics of cadavers, impact con- ditions, and responses. It was found that while the Kroell male, Kroell female, and Stalnaker data had similar physical characteristics, their responses were not related to their phy- sical characteristics and impact conditions in the same man- ner. Regression equations were found that fit the Kroell male data extremely well. Based on a regression analysis of the Kroell male data, scaling rules were developed that allowed performance requirements for chest response to be defined for 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile dummies. Previous res- ponse requirements were for 50th percentile dummies only and were based on averaged responses from subjects whose average characteristics differed widely from 50th percentile characteristics. Currently recommended response corridors based on an ex- tended data base are presented in the Addendum. The ex- tended data base includes new data being concurrently pub- lished. These additional data produce a few minor changes in the response corridors, while improving their statistical signi- ficance. 3763</page><page sequence="2">3764 R. F.

This corridor was based on the response of three male cadavers whose average mass was 176 lb (79.8 kg). The corridor was developed by taking a ±15% data band around the averaged adjusted cadaver response. To aid in codifying the require- ment, data points connected by straightline segments were used to approximate the data band. The deflection data for the high-speed corridor were the penetrations of the impactor into the cadavers. One-half in (12.7 mm) was subtracted from the penetration to account for tissue thickness, oblique- ness of impact, etc., yielding an estimated sternal deflection. The high-speed corridor was based on data from six male and two female cadavers whose average mass was 141 lb (64.0 kg). Meeting these requirements has been considered necessary, but not sufficient, for biofldelity of dummy chests. In the paper (6) in which the corridors were presented, it was shown that none of the test dummies used at that time satisfied the recommendations. There have been several attempts by dummy manufacturers and dummy users to develop dummy chests to satisfy these corridors. Foster (7) discussed a prototype by Sierra Engineering that appeared promising, but production models did not prove satisfactory. Neathery and Lobdell (8) reported on a chest structure that satisfied a modified form of the testç. Haslegrave and Croker (9) reported the performance of the chest in the OPAT dummy, developed by David Ogle Limited of England, which ap- proached the corridors in a slightly modified test. Tennant (10) discussed a complete dummy development program that had the Kroell corridors as the objective for the chest design. In addition to these uses of the recommended requirements in the design and development of test dummies, the National Highway Traffic Safety Admin. (NHTSA) has designated a slightly modified form of the test conditions as requirements in certifying the NHTSA-approved Hybrid II test dummy (1 1). However, the responses required by NHTSA in the tests are the responses that happen to be typical of this dummy. They have no biomechanical significance and differ markedly from the recommendations of Kroell. The NHTSA requirements have become known as "Part 572 requirements." The data of Stalnaker (5) have not been formally codified into performance requirements for test dummies. However, they were used by McElhaney (12) as design criteria in the development of a crash test dummy by the Highway Safety Research Institute (HSRI) for the Motor Vehicle Manufac- turers Assoc. (MVMA). McElhaney's criterion was to have the dummy response fall within the data band of cadaver re- sponses obtained by Stalnaker and shown in Fig. 2. The 10 unemb aimed cadavers used in this study had an average mass of 121 lb (54.9 kg). There were eight males and two females. There was no adjustment of the response for muscle tensing, and the abscissa represents impactor penetration. There are several significant differences, in addition to the impact conditions, in the data band of Stalnaker and the corridors recommended by Kroell. These differences should be remembered when these data and corridors are compared: 1 . The Kroell corridors were adjusted for muscle tensing and represent a tensed individual; the Stalnaker band was not and represents a relaxed individual. 2. The Kroell corridors are for sternal deflection, while the Stalnaker band represents impactor penetration. Kroell used 0.500 in (12.7 mm) as the difference in defining his 16 mph (7.15 m/s) corridors, while the actual sternal de- flection was measured for his 1 1 mph (4.92 m/s) corridor. 3. The probe was mechanically stopped after a fixed translation in the Stalnaker data. The probe was nor- mally stopped completely by the cadaver in the Kroell data. 4. Kroell clipped early load spikes from his data when they occurred, not being sure what was cadaver response and what was instrumentation artifact. Stalnaker's load cell was inertially compensated to eliminate resonant arti- facts, and therefore he included the early loading. 5. Both the Kroell corridors and the data band of Stalnaker have been used by various investigators to define</page><page sequence="3">ANALYSIS OF CHEST IMPACT RESPONSE 3765 the response of a 50th percentile adult male, with a body mass of 164 lb (74.4 kg). As was mentioned, the Kroell data were based on average masses of 176 (79.8) and 141 lb (64.0 kg), while the Stalnaker cadavers had an average mass of 121 lb (54.9 kg). PURPOSE OF STUDY - The fifth point mentioned above was the basic motivation of this study. It is of academic in- terest, of course, to understand the influences of the physical characteristics of the cadaver and the impact conditions. However, since available cadaver subjects are so often non- typical in physical characteristics, it would be most useful in developing dummies with representative human response to be able to predict average 50th percentile response from non- 50th percentile cadaver responses. Further, such prediction capability might also be extended to other portions of the population; namely, 5th and 95th percentiles. The main objective of this study was to develop appropri- ately scaled Kroell-type chest response corridors for 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile test dummies. Concomitant objectives addressed by the study were: 1 . To find functional relationships between cadaver antro- pometrie characteristics, their chest responses, and the various impact conditions used. 2. To determine if male and female cadaver responses in the data base could be described by the same functional re- lationships. 3. To determine if the Stalnaker data and the Kroell data could be described by the same functional relationships. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS Dimensional analysis has proved to be a very useful tool in organizing large multivariable experiments and in simplifying the analysis of the resulting data. It is foundational to mode- ling and scaling techniques and therefore seemed appropriate for this study. Dimensional analysis is based upon Fourier's principle of dimensional homogeneity, which requires that any equation expressing a physical relationship be dimension- ally homogeneous. Its theoretical background is based on Buckingham's II theorem. A thorough treatment of dimen- sional analysis and similitude can be found in Ref. 12. SELECTION OF VARIABLES - The first and one of the most important steps in a dimensional analysis is the selec- tion of the variables to be considered in the problem. Un- fortunately, dimensional analysis techniques offer no assis- tance in this area, and relevant variables are chosen based on the experience, intuition, and judgment of the analyst. Ideally, the variables can be classified as dependent or inde- pendent. When dealing with human or cadaver subjects, characteristics, which may be important independent vari- ables, are in fact coupled together. Further, in the Kroell study, there was a correlation between the impact mass and velocity. (This correlation could have been designed out of the experiments, had this type of study been the objective of the original work.) Thus, the variables do not fit the ideal, dependent -independent variable concept. The variables were divided into three categories. First, there were the physical characteristics of the cadavers. These vari- ables were treated as independent variables, although they were interrelated. In this group were cadaver mass W , height H, chest depth D, and age at death A. Chest girth was also initially considered, but a preliminary study (which will be discussed in the Results section) indicated that this variable was highly correlated with chest depth and mass. It was there- fore eliminated. Age was taken as a dimensionless indicator of cadaver condition, rather than as a variable with the dimen- sions of time to avoid nonsensical combinations of age with velocity or acceleration in the dimensional analysis. Since it was a dimensionless term, it constituted a II term by itself. The second category of variables included the input vari- ables: mass of impactor Wj and velocity V. These variables were controllable and therefore potentially independent. It was necessary to include the acceleration due to gravity G as well in order to relate mass and force in the dimensionless II terms. The final category of terms was the dependent response of the cadavers. This group included a characteristic force F and a characteristic deflection P. The peak plateau force, which had been tabulated by Kroell, was taken as the characteristic force in the Kroell data. The character of the Stalnaker data was slightly different from that of Kroell. For it, a represen- tative plateau load was selected. The characteristic deflection was taken as the maximum impactor penetration for both the Kroell and Stalnaker data sets. In some of the Kroell data, the sternal deflection had been measured. In these cases, the maximum penetration was estimated by adding 0.5 in (12.7 mm) to the sternal deflection. DEVELOPMENT OF II TERMS - The above categories re- sulted in eight variables: Wc, H, D, Wp V, G, F, and P, in three basic dimensions- force, length, and time. According to the Buckingham II theorem, the eight variables should be reducible to Ave dimensionless II terms. In addition, there was the dimensionless age term for a total of six II terms. The number of possible sets of II terms in infinite. Any set of II terms that satisfies the following conditions is valid: 1 . It has the correct number of II terms. 2. It has no dependent terms; that is, no one II term in the set may be formed by any combination of other II terms in the set. 3. It includes each variable. A set of II terms was selected that would have a degree of physical significance and that would maintain as far as pos- sible the earlier grouping of variables. These were: 1. Physical characteristics: A, D/H. 2. Input: Wj/Wc, V2/D · G 3. Response: P/D, F/Wc. MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS Functional relations between the dependent and independent variables were sought using a stepwise multiple linear regres-</page><page sequence="4">3766 R. F. NEATHERY sion analysis. Nonlinear relations were also examined by tak- ing logarithms of the variables. DESCRIPTION OF COMPUTER PROGRAM - The data were analyzed using the Honeywell Series 400 time-sharing library stepwise multiple linear regression program "SMLRP***" (13). This program computes the least- squares best-fit linear regression line between the specified dependent and independent variables. The program allows the user to specify a minimum confidence level of accept- ance of independent variables and provides additional sta- tistical measures of the reliability and goodness of fit of the resulting equation. The program examines each independent variable in turn and selects the one that minimizes the deviation of the de- pendent variable from its observed value. A statistical test of the coefficient for the variable is then made. If the test is passed, the variable is kept in the relation. The remaining variables are reexamined in the same manner. After each new variable is added, the previously added variables are reexam- ined to see if their contributions are still significant. If not, they are deleted. This process continues until no more vari- ables can be added or deleted at the given statistical signifi- cance level. The program also provides a correlation matrix of all the variables in the data file. DATA HANDLING - A preliminary study of the physical characteristics of the cadavers in the Kroell data was made. This study used all of the specimens listed in Table 1 (6), except specimen 1 IFF which had two dimensions missing. The height and weight of specimen 19FM, which had been decapitated, were estimated based on actual shoulder height and weight of the decapitated body. The chest depth was not taken in the Stalnaker study. This eliminated these data from the preliminary study and restricted its use overall. This point will be discussed further in the Results section. For the study of responses, the four embalmed cadavers were eliminated. Also eliminated were the tests where the mass or velocity was so different from the rest of the tests that they produced a significantly different load deflection response curve; namely, specimens 25FM, 26FM, and 28FM. In these cases, it was not possible to select an equivalent characteristic force. The previously mentioned specimen, 1 IFF, was also not included.

Table 3 gives the Stalnaker data with the chest depth calculated as discussed in the Results. The Kroell data were divided into two files: male and female. A third file contained the combined data. For each file, four different relationships were sought: 1 . A linear relation between basic variables. 2. A linear relation between II terms. 3. A linear relation between the logarithms of the basic vari- ables. 4. A linear relation between the logarithms of the II terms. The third and fourth relations can, of course, be reduced to nonlinear expressions in the basic variables or II terms. RESULTS The first step in the analysis was to examine the physical characteristics of the cadavers. If the characteristics were drastically different, it would suggest that the response would also be different.

The equations indicated on the graph are at the 99% confidence level for the men and combined files and 90% for the women file. It can be seen that the coefficients vary little between the data files. The largest error between an observed value of girth using the combined file and the pre- dicted value using the regression equation is 7.2%. When the three additional variables were also included, the differences were reduced further. Also shown in Fig. 3 are the data points for a 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile dummy. It is interesting that they very closely follow the trend indicated by the Kroell data. Since the girth could be predicted from the other physical charac- teristics, it was decided to delete this variable from the re- sponse study. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF STALNAKER DATA - It has been mentioned that the depth was not available for the Stalnaker data. In order to examine the response data and compare them with the response data of Kroell, chest depth was predicted based on the regression equation D = 0.9197 + 0.01 175 A + 0.01376 Wc + 0.02029 Η + 0.1006 girth (1) where the units are as in Table 2. This equation gives a stand- ard error of 0.589 in (15.0 mm) and a maximum error of , 10.4% for the combined Kroell data. The values of depth in Table 3 were calculated using this equation. Fig. 4 shows a girth versus weight plot of the Stalnaker data and the regression line for the combined Kroell data from Fig. 3. The good fit of these data and the regression line suggests that the differences in the physical characteristics of the Stal- naker and Kroell samples were in mean value only and that Eq. 1 should give reasonable values for chest depths of the Stalnaker sample. GENERAL RESPONSE - Table 5 gives the correlation mat- rices for the basic variables for the male, female, and com- bined data files of Kroell. Table 6 gives the correlation mat- rices for the II terms. From either of these tables, it is evi- dent that large differences exist between correlation coeffi- cients for many of the variable pairs for the men and women. For example, for the 15 correlation coefficients in the II terms (Table 6), there is a difference of 0.500 or more in 10 of the coefficients. The differences in the male and female data files are further</page><page sequence="8">3770 R. p.

Fig. 5 is a log-log plot of the II terms F/Wc versus V2/D · G. Also plotted are the regression lines from the analysis. Large differences in coefficients exist. Fig. 6 is a similar plot for P/D and V2/D · G. The same observations apply. Based on the above tables and figures and additional analysis which gave results consistent with the above, it was concluded that the two data files were governed by different functional relations and that they should be analyzed separately. Figs. 5 and 6 also illustrate the accuracy that can be obtained in pre- dicting the responses in the male file using only one independ- ent II term. Because of this better fit and because there were more male data available, the remaining analysis is based upon the male data file. (Note: the additional data in the Adden- dum allow the male and female files to be combined.) PEAK PLATEAU FORCE - It was found that the peak plateau force could be determined very accurately from the Kroell male data. The relation that minimizes the error is F = 1635 + 1.745 A + 4.233 Wc - 7.860 H - 219.7 D - 14.17 W, + 114.4 V (2) where the units are as given in Table 2. This relation explains virtually all of the variation in the force in the data from which it was derived. It has a coefficient of multiple deter- mination of 0.999 (1 .000 is perfect). This indicates that 99.9% of the squared variation from the mean was explained by the equation. This accuracy is graphically illustrated in Fig. 7, in which the observed values are plotted against the calculated values. The standard error of the estimate is 19.4 lb (86.3 N). An exponential relation involving the II terms would pro- bably be more universally applicable.

DISCUSSION OF EMPIRICAL EQUATIONS - Eqs. 2-5 are empirical equations derived from a regression analysis of the data; that is, for the form of equation used, they best explain the variation in the data. Empirical equations have been widely and successfully used in engineering where problems are experimentally studied. Such equations are often used to infer cause-effect relation- ships, and such inferences may occasionally be valid. How- ever, if the independent variables are correlated, as they are in these data, such inferences can be very misleading. To illustrate the point, Eq. 4, which fits the data very well, would predict that an increase in impactor velocity of 10 mph (4.47 m/s) would decrease the penetration by 0.006 in (0.152 mm), which is unlikely. The true effect of velocity upon penetra- tion is masked in the impactor weight term in this equation, since velocity and impactor weight have a correlation coeffi- 127.

Eq. 5 indicates that penetra- tion varies directly with Vo *6 5 2 . Eq. 5, which does not fit the data as well as Eq. 4, would be preferred as a general prediction equation, because it tends to reduce cross-correlation between the variables. For example, the influence of the relatively high correlation between im- pactor mass and cadaver weight, -0.595, is eliminated when the terms are combined. Even though there is less coupling influence in Eq. 5 and the indicated effect of velocity on penetration seems more likely from a mechanical analysis, extreme care should be exercised in implying any cause-effect relationship. Another advantage of using equations of the form of Eqs. 3 and 5 is that the resulting relationship is independent of the particular II terms selected in the dimensional analysis. Given the same set of data, regardless of which of the infinite num- ber of valid sets of II terms might be selected, the resulting regression equations would be derivable from Eqs. 3 and 5. Being equations of dimensionless terms, the only dimensional convention required is consistency within each term. A common misuse of empirical equations is applying them to situations that differ widely from the data base. Gener- ally, they should be applied within or near the range of data upon which they were based; that is, they should not be widely extrapolated. COMPARISON OF STALNAKER DATA WITH KROELL DATA The Stalnaker chest impact data are given in Table 3. Of the data presented by Stalnaker (5), subjects CI 4 and C19 were omitted from Table 2 because of a lack of complete data. These chest impact studies were conducted under con- ditions similar to those used by Kroell. In order to make a quantitative comparison between the Stalnaker data and the Kroell data, the responses in the Stalnaker data were pre- dicted from Eqs. 3 and 5. There were several difficulties and subjective decisions in doing this. The lack of chest depth data and subsequent calculation of chest depth from Eq. 1 were discussed in the Results section. The II terms D/H, V2/D · G, and P/D were calculated based on the predicted D. The general shape of the force-penetration response curve found by Stalnaker has some qualitative differences from that found by Kroell. Kroell generally had an easily defined peak plateau force, which was generally not the case with Stalnaker. The values for peak plateau force in Table 2 were subjectively determined. Of the four independent variables in Eqs. 3 and 5, only Wj/Wc differs widely from the range of data upon which the equations were based. Its minimum value in the Stalnaker study was 0.142 compared with a minimum of 0.224 in the Kroell data. So the extrapolation of Eqs. 3 and 5 here in- volve only one variable, but this extrapolation may contri- bute to the differences found. The values predicted from Eqs. 3 and 5 for the Stalnaker data are given in Table 7. The observed forces averaged 176 lb (783 N) more than the calculated forces.

The results are graphically illus- trated in Figs. 9 and 10, plots of the observed versus calcu- lated values. Also shown in these figures are the standard errors of the estimate based on the Kroell data. The Kroell data would fit predominantly within this band. It would appear that neither the force nor penetration in the Stalnaker data is related to the other variables in the same manner as in the Kroell data. This could be due to the dif- ferent range of Wj/Wc and other factors. Since the Stalnaker data spanned a relatively small range of input conditions and responses, they were not analyzed further. RESPONSE CORRIDORS (Also see Addendum) The main objective of this study was to develop response corridors scaled to account for variation in cadaver charac- teristics. Up to this point, it has been determined that the physical characteristics of the three data files, Kroell male and female and Stalnaker, are common. It further appears that neither the Kroell female nor the Stalnaker response data can be considered common with the Kroell male data. Thus, there existed three possible data banks upon which re- sponse corridors might be based. The Kroell male data were preferred over the female data, since there were more data (ten and six), and the male response data could be more accu- rately predicted. The Kroell male data were chosen over the Stalnaker data because they contained a greater range of cadaver characteristics, impact conditions, and responses. Thus, the following response corridors are based only on the Kroell male data cpntaining 10 subjects. The ranges of characteristics, impact conditions, and responses of the data are as follows: Age, years 19-83 Mass, lb (kg) 117-190 (53.1-86.2)' Height, in (m) 65-77 (1 .65-1 .96) Depth, in (mm) 7.88-10.1 (200-256) Impact mass, lb (kg) 42.5-52.0 (19.3-23.6) Velocity, mph (m/s) 1 1.5-21.6 (5.14-9.66) Plateau force, lb (kN) 453-1530 (2.02-6.8 1) Penetration, in (mm) 2.54*4.2 (64.5-106.7)</page><page sequence="12">3774 R. F. NEATHERY RATIONALE - This study accepts the basic rationale of the response corridors as originally developed by Kroell. Pertinent points were: 1. Adjustment of load levels by adding 150 lb (667 N) to account for muscle tensing. 2. Adjustment of penetration by subtracting 0.5 in (12.7 mm) to indicate sternal deflection. 3. Determination of general shape of the response from en- velope of the responses. 4. Dummy response restricted to ±15% of average response as defined by straightline segments of response corridors. Since the postulation of the Kroell corridors based on im- pacts of a 43 lb (19.5 kg) mass at 1 1 mph (4.92 m/s) and a 51 lb (23.1 kg) mass at 16 mph (7.15 m/s), NHTSA has de- fined similar tests for certifying Hybrid II dummies. Their impact conditions are based on a single mass 51.5 lb (23.5 kg) at 9.55 (4.27) and 15 mph (6.71 m/s). These conditions are dynamically very similar to those prescribed by Kroell and have been widely used by dummy users. Further, they have the advantage of employing a single mass. Because the anal- ysis here allows for variation of the mass, it was decided to use the single-mass, Part 572, impact conditions in defining the recommended response. Sizes of 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile dummies, specified by NHTSA, are given in Table 8. No characteristic ages for dummies are specified. This required that the data be remani- pulated giving prediction equations that did not include age. The heights of dummies are not specified by NHTSA. The values for height given in Table 8 were taken from Ref. 14, which was a primary source for the NHTSA specifications.

Linear rela- tions of the independent variables that fit the data better were also obtained. However, those linear relations suffer from the influence of cross-correlation of the independent variables. Eqs. 6 and 7 were developed for male data only, female data being specifically excluded. Because of a lack of additional female data, these equations will be used for the 5 th percen- tile female. It should be understood that this is an extrapo- lation of the data and subject to correction by additional data and analysis. ADJUSTED AVERAGED CADAVER RESPONSES - The adjusted averaged data of Kroell are familiar to many readers. To illustrate the effect of the scaling techniques, the aver- aged data are produced in Fig. 1 1 and Table 9. By compar- ing the averaged cadaver characteristics from the two corri- dors by Kroell, it can be seen that average cadaver height in the high-speed corridor is the only parameter that comes very close to the 50th percentile dummy characteristics. Fig. 1 1 graphically indicates the effect of the scaling techniques de- veloped here. Shown on the plot, with the original responses developed by Kroell, are the predicted responses for 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile dummies under the impact con- ditions specified by Kroell. The curves were generated by scaling the ordinate by the ratio of the predicted peak plateau force to the peak plateau force in the original Kroell curve. The abscissa was scaled by the ratio of the predicted pene- tration to the penetration in the Kroell curve. A number of points were plotted for each curve, and the curves were drawn in by free hand, attempting to maintain the shape of the original curves. For the 50th percentile high-speed response, it can be seen that the load is higher and the deflection greater than origi- nally recommended by Kroell. Fifth percentile responses have a load about 100 lb (445 N) greater at the peak and have slightly less deflection. The deflection is nearly 0.5 in (12.7 mm) more and the load slightly less for the 95th per- centile response. For the 50th percentile low-speed response, the load is slightly less and the deflection 0.2 in (5.08 mm) less than the original. The 5th percentile response has a higher load and considerably less deflection. The 95th percentile has a lower load and greater deflection.

An empirical equation was developed by multiple linear regression analysis to describe this relationship, and it was used to determine the chest depths for the Stalnaker data. A dimensional analysis of the cadaver and impact para- meters led to two dependent dimensionless terms and four independent dimensionless terms, which included the cadaver characteristics and the impact conditions. A study of the response to impact of the male and female cadavers indicated that the relationships of their responses to the independent variables were not the same. Because there were more male than female data, empirical equations re- lating the responses to the other variables were developed, based on the male data. The maximum deviation of the data base from the regression line was 2.4% for force and 5.4% for penetration. The chest response data of Stalnaker were examined by these empirical relations. The loads observed by Stalnaker were found to be higher than predicted by this study. The penetration of the chest impactor was considerably less than predicted. A major reason for this was probably due to the chest impactor being arrested after some predetermined total displacement in the Stalnaker study. The impactor was generally stopped wholly by the cadaver in the Kroell study. It was concluded that the Stalnaker and Kroell data could not be considered a common data bank. Using the Kroell male data base, empirical equations were also developed for predicting the responses of humans cor- responding to various sizes of crash test dummies. Response corridors similar to those proposed by Kroell, but scaled by the equations developed in this study, were proposed for 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile test dummies under the impact con- ditions specified by Part 572 of the NHTSA standard for test dummies.

Particular attention needs to be given to uncoup- ling the highly correlated independent variables as new data are collected (see the Addendum). To develop dummies that have sufficient biofidelity to allow reasonable confidence in predicting injury potential of various restraint systems will require additional knowledge of chest response and tolerance under various loading intensi- ties, patterns, and durations.

Following the writing of this paper, their data have been added to the data bank from which predictive equations were developed. Presented here, without detail, are the predictive equations and resulting dummy perfor- mance criteria based on the larger data base. 5th PERCENTILE RESPONSE CHARACTERISTICS 5 34 (Z.25, 1220) (1*200) ' 4.45 (U 1020^^î^080)^-X ' 1000&gt; (1000) " - - ' ' (0.25,980) - - ' ' ' 3.56 t (1.5, 800) ' ' ' Ξ (800) (0.25. 740) (1-0, 760)__ - - ^Λ800)' οο ' ~ '' *700) Y3.05.700) ? .

The impact masses varied from 42.5-52.0 lb (19.3-23.6 kg), and the impact velocities varied from 1 1.5-21.6 mph (5.14-9.66 m/s). The impact mass and velocity had a high cross-correlation, the coefficient being 0.669. The expanded data, the bases of Figs. A-l, A-2, and A-3, included 19 males and 5 females with a combined average of 148 lb (67.1 kg). The impact masses varied from 22-52 lb (10.0 -23.6 kg), and the impact velocities varied from 9.7- 22.8 mph (4.34-10.10 m/s). In addition to more than doubling the data base, the combined data have the impact mass and velocity virtually uncoupled with a correlation coefficient of 0.011. Because of the larger data base, Eqs. A-l and A-2 can be shown to be statistically more reliable than Eqs. 6 and 7. They are further improved by the un- coupling of impact mass and velocity. However, some cross-correlation still exists between variables, particularly physical characteristics.

The resulting peak plateau loads and maximum penetrations are given in Table A-l along with the results from Eqs. 6 and 7. Figs. A-l- A-3 are response corridors based on Eqs. A-l and A-2. Eqs. 7 and A-2 give deflection values very close for these conditions, the maximum difference being 3.2%. Larger dif- ferences exist between values predicted by Eqs. 6 and A-l. Eq. A-l indicates smaller differences in peak plateau loads than Eq. 6 for 5th and 95th percentile dummies. Further, the values predicted by Eq. A-l average about 8 % higher for the low-speed test than those predicted by Eq. 6. Figs. A-l- A-3 are recommended response corridors based on a sizeable data base. Dummies meeting these criteria will have significant human fidelity in response to blunt frontal impact. However, satisfying these criteria is not sufficient to assure total human fidelity of the thorax in all important aspects.</page></plain_text>
