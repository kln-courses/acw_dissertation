The African Origin and American Life of a Statue from Cote d'lvoire Monica Blackmun Visona A work of art is a challenge; we do not explain it, we adjust ourselves to it. In interpreting it we draw upon our own aims and endeavours, inform it with a meaning that has its origin in our own ways of life and thought. . . . the meaning that a work of art assumes for a later generation is the result of the whole range of previous interpretations.—Arnold Hauser, The Philosophy of Art History (1959)' Over the past century, a robust female figure has participated in a series of dramatic events. Sculpted in the territory known as the Ivory Coast (or Cote d'lvoire) as the region was being explored by the French, the statue left the African continent during France's colonial conquests of West Africa. After ar riving in Paris, she was purchased by a young art dealer named Paul Guillaume. Soon afterward, in the war-torn sum mer of 1914, Guillaume gave the statue to Marius de Zayas, an artist and entrepreneur, who shipped her to his partner, Alfred Stieglitz, in the United States. The sculpture was one of approximately fifteen African works displayed that fall in the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession, also known as the 291 Gallery. De Zayas claimed that this small exhibition was the very first in the United States to present African works as art rather than as ethnographic objects. A photograph of the statue was reproduced in de Zayas's 1916 publication African Negro Art: Its Influence on Modern Art (Fig. 1). That illustration was reprinted and discussed in the 1984 catalog of the noto rious exhibition "Primitivism" in 20th Century Art organized by the Museum of Modern Art, New York. In 1949, Georgia O'Keeffe donated the statue (together with four other Afri can works and ninety-six works by American modernists) to Fisk University, in Nashville. A new photograph of the figure was prominently displayed in the catalog for the ground breaking Black Art—Ancestral Legacy exhibition of 1989 orga nized for the Dallas Museum of Art. Fifty years after O'Keeffe's donation, when this historically black university (HBCU) was facing significant financial difficulties, it agreed to share the donated artworks with the Crystal Bridges Mu seum of Bentonville, Arkansas, in exchange for a substan tial infusion of funds. In the fall of 2010, the statue was on permanent display in the Carl Van Vechten Gallery of Fisk University, awaiting final legal rulings on her future (Fig. 2). As all information on the artist, the personal name, and the place of origin of this female figure was lost when she left Cote d'lvoire, the sculpture is here titled the Fisk Figure. Tracing the history of this specific object enables us to examine the changing nature of the relationships that have inserted the Fisk Figure into the lives of its owners for more than a century. Inspired by the short but evocative fictional narrative constructed by the art historian Susan Vogel for a Fang sculpture now in the collection of Yale University, New Haven,2 my investigations into the remarkable "biography" of the statue provide a counterpoint to Vogel's hypothetical scenarios in setting forth a sequential account of several pivotal periods in the documented history of this African art object.3 Following the lead of Aijun Appadurai and Igor Kopytoff, whose influential sociological approach to the lay ers of values embedded in objects has encouraged a wealth of interdisciplinary inquiry,4 we can observe changes in the identity of the statue as she moved across cultures, time, and space. The unfolding "social life" of the Fisk Figure, as de scribed here, reveals the sculpture's impact on the art and the human beings she encountered, "entangling" her creator, her original patrons, her modernist owners, and her Ameri can viewers in a complex web of curiosity, desire, pride, pleasure, and profit.5 As Alfred Gell has argued, art objects are efficacious, bringing about major and minor changes through multiple interactions, and we will see that the art object herself was an active "agent," "enchanting" her owners on multiple levels.6 While Cell's analysis of the mechanisms of such transactions are not referenced here, the focus of the narrative is indeed on what the Fisk Figure has "done" in a diverse array of social situations and cultural milieus rather than what she has "meant" to observers and critics. Such an approach challenges a basic tenet of primitivism: the estab lished notion that "non-western objects [were] reduced to convenient props and triggers" in the development of twen tieth-century modernism.' From this perspective, we can ob serve how a single African statue has created transformations in European and American culture. The first key events in the social life of the Fisk Figure—the transactions involved in her creation and original use—were not recorded in written documents. The next phase of her existence—the events leading up to her departure for France— took place in settings that have only recently begun to attract the attention of art historians. Yet once the figure arrived in France and entered the realm of modernist artists, she con tributed to a cultural context that has been exhaustively studied by generations of art historians. When she came to the United States, the statue moved into a setting where she would become familiar to African American artists, partici pating in a period and a context chronicled by a smaller number of art historical studies. The most recent stages of her social life, marked by legal maneuvers and commercial appraisals, have not yet entered the domain of art historians, although they have been described by journalists and have been the subject of reports and blogs posted to the Internet. Various conceptions of history, and diverse forms for tran scribing memory, are thus involved in this construction of the statue's biography.8 While fact and supposition jostle for position in many segments of this biographical account, it is the earliest years in the life of the Fisk Figure that leave the most room for speculation.</page><page sequence="2">100 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 1 1 "Statuette—fetish, Ivory Coast, private collection, New York," from Marius de Zayas, African Negro Art: Its Influence on Modern Art, New York: published by the author, 1916, 60 (artwork and photograph in the public domain) Cote d'lvoire: Grand Lahou, circa 1912 The Fisk Figure left the western coast of Africa a few years prior to 1914. As is the case for most works of art exported from the continent during the last two decades of the nine teenth century and the first four or five decades of the twentieth (the "classical" art of colonized Africa), any assump tions regarding her provenience can only be speculative. However, a tentative reconstruction of the original contexts for this particular statue (based on both the physical proper ties of the work herself and circumstantial historical evi dence) enables us to forge a plausible account of where, why, by whom, and for whom the statue may have been created. The proportions of the statue—her large head, cylindrical torso, and short, thick legs—characterize figures that have been traced to the Lagoon region of Cote d'lvoire.9 The dozen populations known collectively as the Lagoon peoples, or lagunaires, live along the coastal waterways and in the inland hills that stretch across the southeastern shores of the country (Fig. 3). The lagunaires identify themselves as Akan, and, indeed, it appears that they have very old connections to populations in Cote d'lvoire (such as those known as the Baule, Anyi, and Nzima, their neighbors to the east and north) and in Ghana (including peoples called the Nzima, Aowin, Ahanta, Fante, and Asante) all of whom speak lan guages of the Akan family.

Formal features of works documented in museum records as having come from the Lagoon region may be compared with those of the Fisk Figure. The most important public collection of Lagoon art was assembled by Paul Meraud, a French priest of the Societe des Missions Africaines, who set aside a room for "things of the ancestors" in the mission he had founded in a Lagoon (Akye) community in 1895. Meraud's small museum evidendy presented a representative sample of the material culture of the Lagoon peoples and their neighbors in the first four decades of the twentieth century.11 Other objects from the Lagoon area were donated by colonists to the National Museum of Abidjan (now the 4 "Achiyea" (Akye) Lagoon figure collected in 1905 in Grand Bassam, wood, Cote d'lvoire. World Museum, National Museums Liverpool, 8.11.1905.23 (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the World Museum, National Museums Liverpool) Musee National des Arts et Civilisations de la Cote d'lvoire) and to IFAN (the Institut Frangais d'Afrique Noire, later, the Institut Fondamentale d'Afrique Noire) in Dakar, Senegal. Many of the items donated during the 1940s and 1950s were accompanied by accession data that noted the district where they had been obtained.12 Unfortunately, records from museums in Europe and the United States rarely provide reliable information on the geo graphic origin of Lagoon works produced in the early colo nial era. Two notable exceptions are the accession notes attached to statues in the World Museum in Liverpool. One was purchased by the English engineer A. Ridyard in Grand Bassam, an early colonial capital, in 1905 (Fig. 4). The person who sold the figure to Ridyard evidently told him that this female figure was from the "Achiyea" hinterland, an indica tion that the statue's origin was in the territory of the largest Lagoon group, the Akye. A second figure, also collected by Ridyard in Grand Bassam, was given to the Liverpool mu seum in 1906. It came from Alepe, a trading post close to the communities of the Akye and of another Lagoon group, the Gwa.13 Both works, probably made at the end of the nine teenth century, show the general proportions of the Fisk Figure, including the very short legs whose knees are indi cated by a ledge at the top of particularly broad calves. Since the middle of the twentieth century, when William Fagg began to assign a geographic origin or an ethnic "iden</page><page sequence="4">102 art bulletin march 2012 volume xciv number 1 5 Woman holding a figure she inherited from her mother, Dadiaso, Aowin region of Ghana, 1972-73 (artwork in the public domain; photograph © Patricia Crane Coronel) tity" to undocumented African objects by identifying their diagnostic stylistic features, scholars and merchants alike have matched formal characteristics of specific works to clus ters of features believed to be "typical" of a place or a popu lation, just as a certain set of linguistic patterns might char acterize a language spoken by a circumscribed group of people.14 In the Lagoon region (as in much of Africa), this ostensibly tidy task of connoisseurship has been complicated by the movements of art and artists across linguistic and cultural boundaries, with the result that some stylistic traits have been found on figures made by artists of neighboring peoples as well by those of Lagoon groups.13 For instance, statues displaying the large heads and thick, bulbous legs that distinguish Lagoon works have been documented by art historian Patricia Crane Coronel in western Ghana among the Aowin, a population known in Cote d'lvoire as the Anyi or Agni (Fig. 5).lb Notations on similar statues in the collection of the former Musee d'Ethnographie du Trocadero in Paris record them as coming from Bettie, one of the Anyi kingdoms in Cote d'lvoire. Conversely, figures, masks, and gold ornaments that lagunaires had purchased from Baule artists (who live north and west of 6 Figure carved by the grandfather of the Lagoon (Alladian) owner in a Baule or Anyi style in the late 19th century in Cote d'lvoire (artwork in the public domain; photograph by the author, 1984) the Lagoon region), or created themselves in response to Baule prototypes, are Lagoon in origin but distinctively "non-Lagoon" in style. For instance, a female figure attrib uted to a Lagoon (Alladian) artist by the artist's grandson, the figure's owner, displayed the elongated, fluid limbs and delicate facial features that are hallmarks of what art histori ans consider to be a "Baule style" (Fig. 6).17 A shrine photo graphed in a Lagoon (Abidji) community was populated with statues in a variety of different styles; some figures appeared to be Baule, one appeared to be by an Anyi artist, and some were hard to categorize (Fig. 7). Given the difficulty of reconciling the stylistic range of statuary found in lagunaire communities during the 1980s with a unified and coherent "Lagoon style," we should not be surprised to note that several formal features of the Fisk Figure do not appear on other statues attributed to the Lagoon region. These include the delicate parallel and inter secting ridges visible on the sides of the statue (Fig. 8). Lagoon artists represented the cosmetic marks once worn by men and women by either carving bold raised lines on the necks and stomachs of the figures or (more typically) by inserting tiny wooden pegs for the delicate beauty marks on</page><page sequence="5">THE AMERICAN LIFE OF A STATUE FROM COTE D'lVOIRE ]Q3 7 Group of figures owned by a diviner in a Lagoon (Abidji) region of Cote d'lvoire, 1984 (artworks in the public domain; photograph by the author) a person's forehead, cheeks, chest, and arms (Fig. 9). The prominent navel of the statue, ringed by grooves, is also a non-Lagoon characteristic. The breasts, sloping slighdy so that they point downward, would have bothered Lagoon critics interviewed in the late twentieth century, who pre ferred female figures displaying upright, perfecdy conical breasts. Above all, the head and face of the statue would be highly unusual on a Lagoon sculpture. Lagoon (and Baule) artists generally place oval faces in ovoid heads, whereas here the top of the head slopes outward so that the forehead forms a rhomboid framed on three sides by the ridged hairline. Lagoon men and women spoke to me of their admiration for prominent noses, and their artists empha sized both noses and eyes. The eyes of the Fisk Figure are lost in a central crease forming the bottom of the rhom boid, and the nose is the extension of a delicate ridge bisecting the forehead. Facial features similar to those of the Fisk Figure are some times seen on statues attributed to the noncentralized popu lations who are the western and northern neighbors of the Lagoon groups, peoples known as the Godie, the Dida, and the Bete. These groups are not Akan but speak languages of the Kru family (a designation perhaps linked to the fact that Kru-speaking coastal groups once furnished expert "crews" for European ships). Their cultural ties are with peoples living to their west along the Liberian coast and with peoples of the interior forests such as the We populations (inaccu rately called the Kran or Guere). Unfortunately, the publica tions of scholars who have worked among the Kru-speaking peoples adjacent to the Lagoon region have recorded virtu ally nothing concerning their art forms. The eminent anthro pologist Denise Paulme claimed that the heterogeneous pop ulations known as the Bete had no art forms whatsoever.18 Even though her statement was contested by Bohumil Holas, 8 Fisk Figure, side view (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Vando Rogers, provided by Fisk University) Holas himself published only one reference to Bete sculpture that drew on his own held data. He photographed and briefly discussed a statue he had collected, claiming that it had been a substitute for a length of bamboo carried during a memorial ceremony by a female relative of the deceased (Fig. 10).19 Unperturbed by this lack of documentation, connoisseurs and curators began assigning numerous fig ures to the Bete as early as 1964. Their attributions were apparently based on what Vogel has called "the wisdom of the marketplace"—in other words, the oral statements of the traders who procured the statues—rather than on re corded fieldwork data.20 Statues labeled as "Bete" in museums and private collec tions tend to be more slender and cylindrical than the Fisk</page><page sequence="6">104 art bulletin march 2012 volume xciv number 1 9 Female figure (nkpasopi), attributed to an unknown Lagoon artist, wood, height 10% in.

However, some display detailed geometric patterns (reproducing the cosmetic keloids glossed in English as "scarification") that resemble those of the Fisk Figure (Fig. 12). The ridges encircling her prominent navel echo the designs highlighting the umbilical area of several statues in this stylistic cluster. Although the faces of a few of 10 Female figure documented by Bohumil Holas in Ouragahio, a town he identified as Bete, ca. 1950-66, in Holas, L'image du monde Bete, 67, pi. Ill (artwork in the public domain; photo graph provided by Presses Universitaires de France) the figures assigned to the Bete are quite naturalistic, others have eyes marked only by slits. Usually the forehead is prom inent and the hairline clearly delineated. The head of the Fisk Figure generally conforms to "Bete" stylistic parameters. Perhaps the artist who created the hybrid style of the statue at Fisk University was fully attuned to the stylistic tastes of the Lagoon area, but was reproducing part of the stylistic vocab ulary of a population now known as Bete. Or perhaps the artist usually worked for Kru-speaking patrons but admired the stance and the proportions of lagunaire works. Whatever the case, the formal characteristics of the Fisk Figure indicate that she was made by an artist who worked along and around the western border of the Lagoon region and therefore was based near (or even in) the colonial capital of Grand Lahou. That site of encounter between local Lagoon populations (Avikam trad ers, Aizi fishermen, Adjukru farmers), Kru-speaking immi grants from neighboring regions, Liberian and Ghanaian sailors, Senegalese mercenaries, and (of course) Europeans on various missions is the setting for our first vignette in this biographical sketch. To some degree, the original functions of the Fisk Figure may be reconstructed by combining basic material from a handful of publications in addition to unpublished fieldwork</page><page sequence="7">THE AMERICAN LIFE OF A STATUE FROM COTE D'lVOIRE JQ5 11 Female figure attributed to an unknown artist of the Bete region, Cote d'lvoire, wood, height 26% in.

Nevertheless, my interviews of men and women in Lagoon communities who had commissioned or inherited or observed artworks being used in the past contributed insights into the roles played by statuary in the region during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Similarities in past and present contexts often signal continuities between the spheres of influence of 12 Female figure, attributed to an unknown artist of the Bete region, Cote d'lvoire, wood, 28 in.

Statues were also employed near the end of the twentieth century to attract onlookers to dance performances (Fig. 13) or to complement displays of gold ornaments in ceremonies celebrating a woman's or a man's elevation to the status of a "rich person." As both dance performances and displays of gold were held in the early colonial era, the Fisk Figure could have been purchased as a way to bolster social status and admired primarily for aesthetic reasons. She would thus have lured viewers to a competitive exhibition of economic and aes thetic prowess, riveting the attention of those who would be forced to admire, applaud, and even offer gifts in homage to the organizers.

The sculpture was obviously "fed" by a caretaker who touched food to her mouth and then wiped it clean, a practice necessary only if the figure had housed a spiritual being. In fact, religious contexts have provided the most fascinating range of values and meanings for Lagoon statues. Elders testi fied that statues throughout the entire Lagoon region were once owned by therapists, men and women who advised clients and healed ailments because they could see or predict super natural events. Assisted by supernatural forces, these healers interpreted the past and divined what would occur in the future. Lagunaires who spoke French identified them as "clairvoyants"; Vogel calls comparable specialists of the neighboring Baule people "trance diviners."2" Significandy, even though the prac tice of divination changed dramatically in southeastern Cote d'lvoire over the course of the twentieth century, some Lagoon diviners were working with wooden figures in the 1980s, even in the face of opposition from various Christian churches. As intermediaries facilitating communication between the human therapists and the spiritual beings who inspired and guided them, Lagoon statues in use during the 1980s had a life parallel to that of their owners. Some of them shared 14 Female figure owned by a diviner in a Lagoon (Akye) region of Cote d'lvoire, 1981 (artwork in the public domain; photograph by the author) personal names with members of the diviners' families, and they were seen as intimately linked to their human partners. Anthropomorphic forms, I was told, were particularly effica cious because they could see, hear, and move through the streets and pathways of the community, and they could then report on their observations to their owners. Female figures carried trays or bowls on their heads in order to receive offerings from therapists or their clients, offerings that would be conveyed in some way to the spirits who empowered and inspired the specialist (Fig. 14). Robert Farris Thompson, who has written about the ex pressive language of gestures in African art, observes that female figures bearing objects on their heads are connected to a network of associations.23 This is certainly true in the Lagoon region. Although the only young women I witnessed in processions of the age-set ceremonies known locally as fetes de generation were in their teens and twenties, I was told by elders that they were taking the place of girls in past ceremo nies who had not yet entered puberty. Only younger girls, they argued, should carry bowls of water to quench the thirst of the men who lead the ceremonies, for only female chil dren had the purity of mind, body, and spirit to keep the water free of any rivals' poison."4 Slender female figures on the wooden or ivory finials of a ceremonial staff or spear were said to represent the granddaughter or niece who carried an</page><page sequence="9">THE AMERICAN LIFE OF A STATUE FROM COTE D'lVOIRE 107 elder's chair on official visits, and whose beauty was the pride of her family (Fig. 15). Other works of art, such as the handle of a ceremonial dagger, depict girls bearing a barrel-like container of gold, the ancestral treasury guarded by the male head of the family (Fig. 16). One gold-covered handle of a fly whisk portrays a girl carrying a pot of pure water for the elder's refreshment (Fig. 17). The iconography of this pose in the Lagoon region was closely tied to notions of service, humility, and spiritual protection, and refers to a family's deference to age and wisdom. However, at the same time that wooden sculptures both supported and honored diviners (and their guiding spirits), they also needed to project strength, even ferocity. Thera pists, their figures, and their clients, I was told, were beset by evil forces that operated in secret. Such negative fields of energy, glossed as "witchcraft" by outside observers, were due to multiple points of stress in the social and psychological relationships of lagunaires and have been countered by a variety of Christian and non-Christian religious practices in southeastern Cote d'Ivoire.2;' The muscular legs and wide hips of some figures refer to mature women, who are both hardworking and sexually attractive. Such women are bold and strong enough to combat disease and discord. Particu larly commanding Lagoon sculptures for diviners had mov able arms, attached with either metal nails or wooden pegs (Fig. 18). Their hefty limbs and mobile hands were surely related to their abilities to travel as needed in order to gather invisible materials and secret information for their owners. Other roles for sacred figures tended to be confined to specific locations within the Lagoon region.26 For example, parents and siblings of twins in Eotile and Abure communi ties (in the east of the region) owned sculpted images of a deceased twin, a portrait of a dead child. Other Eotile and Abure images (as in Anyi and Baule communities) repre sented the owner's ideal sexual partner. In both cases, a statue acted as the physical representative (as well as the idealized representation) of a being who inhabited the "other world," a spiritual dimension where our souls reside before our birth into this world, where our spirits reside after we die, and where we have parents, lovers, and spouses. These im ages of twins and soul mates were indistinguishable from those used by therapists. Yet as Eotile and Abure sculptures are usually fairly small (under 4 inches, or 10 centimeters in height), it is unlikely that the Fisk Figure incarnated a twin or spouse. In the western territories of the Lagoon region, I was told that Adjukru and Aizi families once employed tall, al most life-size statues as guardians of their compounds. Frag mentary records in museums and ethnographic reports indi cate that similar figures in the homes of their neighbors (in Kru-speaking Dida communities) represented the founders of the clan or lineage. Standing at a little over a foot in height, the Fisk Figure is too short to have served in a similar capacity. Often the life history of an African art object leaves traces in its surface, and the patina provides clues as to how the statue was handled (and, therefore, what it represented). As noted above, the wear on the mouth and teeth of the Fisk Figure attests that food was placed between her lips. Other wise, though, the color, luminosity, and smell of the sculpture 15 Finial representing a girl carrying a stool, on a staff owned by an elder in a Lagoon (Akye) community, Cote d'lvoire, wood and brass tacks, iron base, 1981 (artwork in the public domain; photograph by the author) provide little information about the roles she once played. Lagoon diviners in the 1980s claimed that directives from the spirit world determined what substances were applied to a figure's surface; some diviners rubbed kaolin, talcum powder, or perfume into their statues, while others coated the sculp tures in soot mixed with palm oil to make their surfaces dark and shiny. Statues of all categories might also be bathed and groomed as if they were human beings. Furthermore, the Fisk Figure could have lost much of her original surface after leaving Cote d'lvoire.27 Traces of an unknown material, dark and dusty with age, are still visible in the bowl the figure carries (another sign that she once received actual sacrifices), while a chip in the rim reveals that the statue has toppled</page><page sequence="10">108 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 1 16 Dagger with an iron blade and a wooden handle representing a girl carrying a container of gold nuggets, attributed to an unknown artist of the Lagoon region, length 18% in.

During some point in its history, her feet have also broken off. As Vogel has pointed out, this damage along the grain of the wood is commonly found on statues made in Cote d'lvoire, even on those that have been handled carefully.28 African artworks were rarely intended to meet the sus tained, unobstructed, and unmediated gaze of the general public, as scholars have demonstrated repeatedly.29 Multiple studies, moreover, stress the multisensory experiences em bedded in encounters with art objects, which were usually enmeshed within complex installations or performances.30 In the Lagoon region, even statues standing amid displays of gold or carried by dancers were kept out of sight in a trunk or basket until it was time for their performances. Figures im personating a twin or sexual partner from the other world would participate more fully in the life of the owner, being fed, carried, groomed, and put to bed on a regular basis. Diviners' statues, however, were usually hidden, especially in communities where Christian congregations were opposed to ancestral religious practices. They lived in shrines con 17 Gold-covered wooden handle of a fly whisk, carried during an age-set ceremony in a Lagoon (Akye) community in Cote d'lvoire, 1981 (artwork in the public domain; photograph by the author) structed inside the therapist's home, and only rarely were they brought into a reception area to meet a client or carried outdoors to participate in a public healing session. Within the shrine area (on a table or on a floor), sculptures and other items were often obscured by sheets of cloth and the accu mulation of other objects and materials (Fig. 20). Offerings in the shrine included bottles of alcoholic beverages, money, cans of talcum powder, perfume, and eggs. If the Fisk Figure worked with a trance diviner, as seems likely, such sustenance (in addition to shells, foreign coins, and other types of cur rency) would have been placed in the bowl on her head. Whatever her original function, the statue would have been modestly clothed in the hip beads and the long, red loincloth worn by most women; surface wear along the junction be tween the thigh and the torso may be attributed to the friction from these strings of beads. A hypothetical reconstruction of the work that the Fisk Figure was once expected to accomplish raises the question of who carved her, and in what circumstances this creative act occurred. Interviews with artists in Lagoon communities dur ing the 1980s also shed light on how their training, inspira tion, and professional practices compared with those of pre</page><page sequence="11">THE AMERICAN LIFE OF A STATUE FROM COTE D IVOIRE ]Q9 18 Female figure attributed to an unknown Lagoon artist, wood, height 11 in.

Lagoon sculptors, like those in the United States, usually worked alone in their studios, and only a select few could devote themselves entirely to sculpture. With some notable exceptions, almost all carvers and metalworkers were men, just as clay vessels (including those that displayed portraits) were made by women. In contrast to the artists of some other African regions, Lagoon specialists rarely supervised teams of apprentices or joined workshops. This tendency, together with the high premium placed on originality and virtuosity, may explain the stylistic variety found in sculpture made for the Lagoon peoples and their neighbors.31 Unfortunately, little data on Lagoon aesthetics has been gathered by researchers. As a consequence, there are no published studies of Lagoon art 4 19 Fisk Figure, rear view (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Vando Rogers, provided by Fisk University) that can compare with the literature on the sophisticated para digms that inform artistic criticism of cultures such as the Yo ruba.32 And while Yoruba praise poems commemorate the vir tuosity of artists long after their deaths, there exist no comparable Lagoon panegyrics that recite the achievements of artists working over a century ago. Thus, the name of the sculptor who carved the Fisk Figure has been irretrievably lost. Throughout the Lagoon region there were generic terms for "artists" (generally glossed as "a person of unusual talent" or "a person of innate creativity"), but no single word in any Lagoon language is equivalent to "art," in the twenty-first</page><page sequence="12">110 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 1 20 Female figure in a shrine setting within the bedroom of its owner, Lagoon (Akye) region of Cote d'lvoire, 1984 (artwork in the public domain; photograph by the author) century understanding of that word as an umbrella term for sculpture, painting, performance, photography, and installa tion. Furthermore, no Lagoon word corresponds to the con cept of "fine arts" or "art for art's sake" invented by eighteenth and nineteenth-century Europeans (and still in circulation to day in popular American culture). Few Lagoon languages dis tinguish between statues with religious power and statues that are valuable only as aesthetically appealing objects; both are simply called "people of wood" or "wooden women." When modernists such as William Rubin have asserted that Africans "lack a word meaning 'art,' " they have rarely acknowledged that definitions for "art" have been highly contested for over a cen tury in European and American contexts.83 However imprecise we must be about the terminology applied to the Fisk Figure, we can be assured that her sculptor was respected by his own community for his technical skills and inventive genius. How did the Fisk Figure come to lose her name, her mission, and her identity? Presumably this happened as the statue left her home in or near the Lagoon region and was transported to France. At the end of the twentieth century, artists in the Lagoon area were filling commissions for for eigners as well as for local clients. A century earlier, the statue conceivably could also have been ordered directly from the artist by a European patron.34 Had this been the case, she would never have been "activated" as a sacred object, or even displayed in a secular setting in the Lagoon region. In the eyes of most collectors and curators today, she would not have been "authentic" had she not been used. Since the mouth and hips of the figure are worn, though, this scenario is unlikely. The Fisk Figure may also have been sold to a foreign trader by her original owner. In the 1980s, it was perfectly accept able for lagunaires to dispose of sculpture they themselves had commissioned. Even sacred figures could be discarded if they had been spiritually or physically damaged or if they had been ineffective as a source of spiritual insight and power. Statues of all sorts were loaned or given as gifts to family, friends, and, in the case of therapists, apprentices. Neverthe less, owners were not entitled to sell artworks if they had inherited them from an ancestor. Of course, these social constraints must have been loosened in the years just before World War I, when most of the Lagoon area expe rienced religious, social, and political upheavals. Appar ently, the Fisk Figure left Cote d'lvoire during this turbu lent period. Unlike in neighboring Gold Coast (modern Ghana), where forts were built by Europeans as early as the sixteenth century, strong offshore currents and a lack of safe harbors discouraged permanent European settlements in the Ivory Coast until the beginning of colonial rule. A French stockade at Assinie, just west of the forts on the Gold Coast, survived for only a few years at the end of the seventeenth century, and a French military outpost at the Lagoon town of Dabou had been abandoned after a short period in the 1860s. Coastal</page><page sequence="13">THE AMERICAN LIFE OF A STATUE FROM COTE D'lVOIRE J}] populations had traded with passing ships for centuries, of course, crossing the dangerous surf in their canoes to bargain with the European sailors on board. Trade goods, in addition to circulating along the coastal lagoons, were carried inland along extensive routes that joined the Lagoon region to the Asante goldfields and to the distant mercantile states along the Niger River, but only a few French explorers had ven tured into the interior before the end of the nineteenth century. A permanent French presence was felt by populations in the region only after the French were "granted" this portion of western Africa by the Berlin Conference of 1884-85. Systematic expeditions in the 1890s mapped the entire terri tory, and by the turn of the century, administrative centers had been built at Grand Lahou (in the west), at Bingerville (in the central Lagoon area), and at Grand Bassam (in the eastern Lagoon territory closest to the Ghanaian border). Armed clashes between the French and the Lagoon popula tions were most frequent during the "rebellion" of an inland Lagoon group, the Abe, in the 1920s. However, local artworks were apparently seized by commanding officers throughout the early colonial period, and emblems connected to political and social leadership were taken as war booty.36 Colonization and "pacification" also brought new economic pressures to the Lagoon region, as communities were forced to pay the taxes and fines newly imposed by the French. Thus, the Fisk Figure was possibly sold or given to a soldier, priest, administrator, or trader in an interaction that may not have been locally sanctioned—and may even have been coerced. It is also possible that the statue was abandoned by a clairvoyant healer during the initial phases of a wave of iconoclasm that swept across the Lagoon region from 1913 to 1915. Catholic priests had established mission stations in several Lagoon areas, but the missions attracted few converts during their first decade in the colony. Churches were sud denly filled when a Liberian evangelist named William Wade Harris and his followers arrived. His preaching inspired lagu naires to rid themselves of any objects that might have been used to manipulate supernatural powers.37 Missionaries mar veled as all manner of objects connected to local religious practices were burned or thrown in the lagoons during mass conversions. Although no documentation suggests that French observers salvaged any of the sculpture jettisoned by Harris's converts, this iconoclasm may have brought some Lagoon objects into their possession.38 Whatever the transaction, or series of transactions, that took the Fisk Figure from a Lagoon community (or from a community near the Lagoon region) and brought it to Grand Lahou (or another colonial port) so that it could be put on a boat bound for Europe, the process erased her identity. The authority she had acquired during her lifetime in Cote d'lvoire because of her ability to absorb and direct super natural and social power could not accompany her to Europe. In France, this object would soon weave new social networks, intersecting webs of desire that Nicholas Thomas has characterized as "entanglement."39 One could say that in early twentieth-century Paris, the Fisk Figure developed new techniques of enchantment—in addition to a new identity. France: Paris, 1914 The Fisk Figure may already have arrived in Paris by the time an energetic artist and entrepreneur named Marius de Zayas (1880-1961) visited the French capital in 1911.40 We know from his letters that de Zayas was gathering avant-garde paint ings for American photographer Alfred Stieglitz (1864 1946).41 The men intended to sell the modernist works in the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession in New York City, also known as the 291 Gallery after one of its addresses (291 Fifth Avenue). De Zayas noted that many Parisian artists owned works of African art and that the formal qualities of modern ist paintings were clearly related to the African works. As de Zayas wrote to Stieglitz, "... I remarked more than ever the influence of the african negro art among this revolutionists. Some of the sculptors have merely copy it, without taking the trouble to translate it into french."42 In 1914, de Zayas re turned to Paris, and this time he encountered Paul Guil laume (1891-1934). One of the works in what de Zayas described as the "very important collection" of this young dealer was the Fisk Figure. It may have been Guillaume who removed the Fisk Figure's clothing. Obviously, the object could not compete with mod ernist statues if it were dressed in beads and a loincloth; it needed to be stripped to be completely accessible to the viewer's gaze. This would, of course, allow French viewers to fully evaluate what Rubin would call the "problem of plastic solutions."43 In fact, one of the artists who appears to have been enchanted by the sophisticated visual harmonies of the forms and negative spaces of this sculpture was the Romanian sculptor Constantin Brancusi, who visited Guillaume during 1913 and 1914. At least on some unconscious level, the masterful strokes of the African sculptor must have ignited a spark of recognition in the European artist. Echoes of the regular segmentation of its shapes, its striking proportions, and its distinctive pose appeared in Brancusi's wooden figure called Prodigal Son or First Step, which was exhibited by Stieg litz in the summer of 1914 but then destroyed.44 While the absorption of African visual systems and stylistic conventions by European modernists is not the subject of our narrative, Brancusi's quotation of the Fisk Figure reminds us how it could actively enter into the imagination of an artist. Yet without its original loincloth—the item of clothing that guaranteed the modesty of both women and wooden figures and that was never removed without their permission—the Fisk Figure now seems to be boldly displaying her pubic region. Undressed African statues are still misread as having a "strong emphasis on the genitalia, with slits and cracks as prominent as mouths," in the overheated words of one Eu ropean art historian.45 A similar misinterpretation on the part of French observers could have occurred because of the clearly delineated breasts. In the statue's homeland, breasts on carved female images alluded to the nurturing presence of a supernatural being. Originally a reference to the beauty and fertility of a woman capable of nursing a child, they would have been admired by viewers in a Lagoon community where women's clothing left the breasts exposed. In early twentieth-century France, where female breasts were elabo rately packaged in order to appear sexually alluring, the Fisk Figure's exposed chest was titillating. At the same time, French observers undoubtedly interpreted the precisely</page><page sequence="14">122 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 1 placed patterns on the surface of the Fisk Figure as horrific, painful scars. In her homeland, these carefully formed cos metic keloids gave women's skin a tactile appeal and erotic beauty. The original messages conveyed by the pose of the statue would also have been submerged by the visual language of early twentieth-century European renditions of the female nude. As noted above, Lagoon figures shown in this stance were meant to evoke images of girls and women whose arms were raised to support a burden balanced on the head, and who therefore exemplified the generosity, humility, and ser vice offered by young female family members to male elders. In contrast, modernist European artists frequently presented sexualized images of compliant women with bent arms and raised elbows that supported their reclining heads and lifted their breasts to the male gaze; Pablo Picasso associated such poses with the exotic odalisque.4b In the context of the cul tural traditions of early twentieth-century Paris, the figure thus communicated sexual allure. Guillaume, in the relatively few passages he actually wrote on African art,47 refers to a "mysterious sap shut within the wood" of African sculpture, and he wrote that the "power of these effigies fascinated some observers to the point of frenzy."48 While the Fisk Figure represented a sound financial investment to the young dealer, he may have also believed that its "primal energies could be metaphorically consumed."49 Guillaume presumably commissioned a craftsman (proba bly the Japanese sculptor Kichizo Inagaki) to create the pol ished wooden base that now cleverly encases the broken feet.50 A vertical crack running down the front of the Fisk Figure is surely the result of the changing levels of humidity and temperature the figure encountered after leaving the tropics. In the Lagoon region, I was told that a new and unblemished statue was preferable to an older, broken one— unless the old figure was demonstrably more efficacious as a conduit for spiritual forces.51 In Paris, the damage suffered by the statue does not seem to have lessened her value. In fact, her visible signs of age and use allowed Guillaume to present her as rare, difficult to obtain, and filled with ancient power. During the next decade, Guillaume would heighten the mystique surrounding the objects he sold by claiming they were centuries old, produced by the unknown artists of vanished cultures, and comparable to the works of pharaonic Egypt.52 As de Zayas later recollected, "Through Picabia I met Apol linaire and Max Jacob, and through Apollinaire I met Paul Guillaume, then a modest but ambitious art dealer and col lector, or rather importer, of Negro art. How he imported it will always remain a mystery but the objects he had were always genuine."53 Although it would be fascinating to inter rogate de Zayas's notions of "genuine" Negro art, he may merely have been impressed that the clever young dealer had drawn up certificates that guaranteed the authenticity of the works he sold.54 The "mystery" of Guillaume's im ports—the allegedly miraculous processes that led African arts to his gallery—lies in his very earliest experiences as a dealer. Paul Guillaume had been employed in 1912 as a clerk in a store (or garage) that sold rubber tires and automotive sup plies.55 The store's suppliers imported rubber from planta tions in French Equatorial Africa (now Gabon and Republic of Congo), and their shipments apparently included art ob jects from Central Africa that ended up in the shopwindow. Perhaps the rubber importers saw the store as a convenient outlet for the sale of the curios their employees had col lected, or perhaps the owners of the business wished to advertise the fact that the wheels of these novel vehicles were encased in a material that came from the exotic lands newly conquered by France. Whatever the case, the African art works in the vitrine caught the attention of Joseph Brummer (1883-1947) and Guillaume Apollinaire (1880-1918). Brum mer had arrived in Paris as an impoverished young Hungar ian sculptor by 1907, and by 1909 he had opened a gallery that sold a wide variety of artworks, including objects from Africa.56 Apollinaire, a charismatic Parisian poet and critic, was also a key figure in modernist enterprises. Evidently, the two men explained their interest in these African works to the young clerk, and Brummer asked if Guillaume could obtain more African imports. Inspired by the encounter, the twenty one-year-old Guillaume launched his own business selling art from the French colonies. Apollinaire became his mentor and collaborator. When de Zayas met him, Guillaume was only twenty-four years old and had been selling African art for two or three years. Guillaume's early business was seemingly conducted en tirely with Frenchmen returning from the colonies, and he placed advertisements in newsletters addressed to colonial officials. As his business expanded he purchased artworks from other Europeans who had collections of African art, and later in his career he even had direct contacts with African traders. He never traveled to Africa himself, however, and nothing in his statements (or in those of his collaborators) demonstrates that he was informed by the colonial reports on specific African cultures that administrators were publishing at the beginning of the twentieth century.57 Although Pari sians referred to Guillaume as a negrier, a term used to des ignate slave traders,58 this characterization did not imply that the art dealer had actually collected his merchandise in Af rica. Like Picasso, who also wrote that he had purchased "negres" (Negroes, Blacks) when he bought African statues from sailors and antiquarians, Guillaume and his modernist associates conflated the acquisition of artworks with the cap ture of the individuals who had made them.59 This elision of the African object and the African person may partly reflect the powerful, personalized impact of sculptures such as the Fisk Figure on French artists. Despite this tendency to personify African statues, Guil laume regarded them as generic examples of art negre rather than as the products of individual artists living in specific communities. In 1914, art negre was defined as any striking object that came from the vast, exotic areas of the world that Europeans were claiming as colonies. In the French imagina tion, objects from the Pacific Islands and parts of the Amer icas mingled with those from Africa, and terms such as art primitive ("primitive art"), or arts premiers ("primordial arts") were eventually applied to arts from all of these areas.60 The belief that all "Negro" cultures were indistinguishable derived from the noxious influence of the "Darwinist" writers of the nineteenth century, theorists who had never visited any of the cultures they described but who had written that all "primi</page><page sequence="15">THE AMERICAN LIFE OF A STATUE FROM COTE D'lVOIRE J]_3 tive" peoples exhibited the cultural traits typical of their developmental stage at the beginning of an evolutionary process that passed through the "barbarism" of Asian peoples to culminate in the "civilization" of European culture.61 There is no evidence that Guillaume questioned the soldiers, administrators, and merchants who had taken art negre out of Africa. In his letters to de Zayas, Guillaume listed examples of African sculpture as masks (masques), "statues," "statuettes," and "figurines," but also as "fetiches" and "idoles." However, these designations were not direct references to the literature of nineteenth-century ethnographers or explorers. Instead, Guillaume arbitrarily applied such "titles" to his inventory.62 As Guillaume gained more experience, he seems to have told clients which French colony had produced an object they wished to purchase. Unfortunately, that information was often wrong. While he may, perhaps, have correctly identified the Ivory Coast as the source of the Fisk Figure when he showed her to de Zayas, only three years later he exhibited a striking figure in a canonically Lagoon style (now in the Museum Rietberg in Zurich) as a "statuette from Guinea" (Fig. 21).63 Two other Lagoon figures from Guillaume's shop, sold to the noted American collector Albert Barnes (1872-1950) and illustrated in the influential 1922 publica tion that featured his collection, were also listed as coming from Guinea.64 While "Guinea" or "Guinee" could refer to the entire western coast of Africa in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, geographic designations had become more precise as European-led expeditions marched across the continent, and by the 1920s the term was used exclu sively for the colonial territory that became the modern nation of Guinea. Guillaume's misidentification of at least three of the four Lagoon figures in his possession indicates that he was probably unaware that they had come from Cote d'lvoire. Yet it was, in part, Guillaume's unfamiliarity with the "de finitive" styles of regions and peoples that allowed the Fisk Figure to enter into the collections of leading American and European modernists. As noted above, William Fagg had established precise stylistic categories for African sculpture by the early 1960s, when French dealers such as Charles Ratton were already employing similar stylistic criteria to determine whether or not specific works were exemplary representatives of an African culture. If the Fisk Figure had entered the French art market for the first time in the 1960s, she would then have been regarded as a noncanonical and atypical example of a Baule work and, therefore, of little interest to serious collectors. If she had arrived in Paris in the 1980s, when workshops throughout western and central Africa were producing sophisticated and artificially aged copies of published artworks, her unique formal qualities might even have suggested to some specialists that she was a "fake," an attempt to replicate a Baule statue by an African artist who had not fully understood or absorbed the an tique prototype. Intriguing insights into the exchanges that brought the Fisk Figure to Guillaume between 1912 and 1914 may be gleaned from her association with over a dozen other African artworks. These were the objects that accompanied her in a trunk that Guillaume gave de Zayas to ship to New York in September 1914, objects that were exhibited by Stieglitz and 21 Female figure in a Lagoon style, exhibited in Paris in 1917 by Paul Guillaume (then in the collection of Gouy d'Arsy), wood. Museum Rietberg, Zurich, Reg.2163 RAF 522 (artwork in the public domain; photograph by the author, with the permission of the Museum Rietberg) de Zayas at the 291 Gallery later that year. The precise number of objects in this shipment is difficult to recon struct.''5 Helen Shannon has identified fifteen of the objects that were in the exhibition, and she has demonstrated that all but one (a Fang reliquary from Gabon) were from Cote d'lvoire.66 She based some of her identifications on Stieglitz's photograph of the corner of the 291 Gallery, which he pub lished in Camera Work, and which shows ten objects (Fig. 22).67 Shannon and Yaelle Biro have located photographs in the archives of the de Zayas family in Seville, Spain, that show additional objects in the group.68 All are from Cote d'lvoire, including another mask and a pestlelike object (both of which may be Guro or Baule) and four more female figures. Biro identifies two of these as Baule and two of these as Lagoon.69 It would appear, then, that all but one of the works that de Zayas took from Guillaume in 1914 had been created by Baule, Lagoon, Yaure, Bete, or We artists living within a fifty-mile radius from the colonial town of Grand Lahou in Cote d'lvoire. Also striking in de Zayas's shipment of African art is the preponderance of works that defy easy stylistic classification, as well as the number of art objects that bear no obvious signs of use.70 Two masks in this group could be called Baule,</page><page sequence="16">ART BULLETIN MARCH 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 1 22 Alfred Stieglitz, African Sculpture Exhibit at 291, 1914, gelatin silver print, 7!/s X 9'A in.

Philadelphia Museum of Art, from the collection of Dorothy Norman, 1972 219-12 (artwork © Georgia O'Keeffe Museum/Artists Rights Society, New York; photograph provided by the Philadelphia Museum of Art) Yaure, or Guro. Four masks in this group could have origi nated in any of the Kru-speaking regions. The two spoons (possibly sacred objects owned by hospitable women from the We populations), the strange pestle, and the comb also have ambiguous features. The Fisk Figure is clearly not the only object in the group that is a stylistic hybrid. If Guillaume had purchased all of the objects in the shipment from a single person (such as a French colonial officer stationed in Grand Lahou), that collector could have obtained the older works of art (such as the Fisk Figure, the Baule figures, or the Lagoon staff finial) from sellers who had acquired them in the inte rior. The sculpture with no signs of wear might have been commissioned or purchased directly from artists living in or near Grand Lahou. Guillaume lent these objects to de Zayas to ship to the United States in the summer of 1914. De Zayas presents the loan as an important gesture of support for the arts during the opening months of the war,71 although the correspon dence clearly shows that the young French merchant consid ered the transaction to be a standard business arrangement.72 This first consignment was soon followed by additional ship ments, and Guillaume himself eventually visited the United States (where he was photographed on horseback "among the Negroes of New Jersey") to meet American clients.73 The Fisk Figure therefore initiated a relationship that trans formed Paul Guillaume from a relatively unknown entrepre neur to an art dealer with an international reputation. She forged a new link between the United States and the African continent, albeit a link mediated by the paradigms of French imperialism. The Fisk Figure's journey to New York estab lished networks that would bring many more African art works to the United States and that would allow Guillaume to supply African works to American collectors during the next decade. Eventually, the agency of the Fisk Figure situated Guillaume, a young man with no real credentials and with no real knowledge of Africa or Africans, as a founding member of an "elite with the expertise to pick out those works whose meaning and authenticity make them worthy of permanent consecration."74 The United States: New York, 1915 Marius de Zayas and Alfred Stieglitz exhibited the Fisk Figure and a number of other African works in their 291 Gallery during the fall of 1914 and the winter of 1915. The exhibition bore the lamentable title Statuary in Wood by African Savages: The Root of Modern Art. De Zayas proclaimed it to be the first presentation of African art as art. Several months earlier, Robert Coady had included African objects he obtained from Brummer in an exhibit in his Washington Square Gallery in New York City, and a handful of European exhibitions had displayed African works as art objects in the years before World War I, but this may indeed have been the first art exhibition to focus exclusively on African artworks.73 Stieglitz's photographs of the objects on display in the 291 Gallery show masks and smaller objects hung on walls and statues resting on a shelf with their backs against the walls (Fig. 22).76 Photographer Edward Steichen had redesigned the installation after the opening by spreading large rectan gles of brightly colored paper on the walls, and visitors en tering the room must have felt that they were stepping into a Cubist painting." In this setting, the Fisk Figure, a multidi mensional work meant to be glimpsed in motion during ceremonies filled with music and other sensual stimuli, was transformed into a static two-dimensional image. Stripped of its red loincloth, white beads, and the fragrant offerings placed on her head, she must have appeared as a mono chrome silhouette against the vibrant colors of the geometric backdrop. This conceptualization of African art objects as</page><page sequence="17">THE AMERICAN LIFE OF A STATUE FROM COTE D'lVOIRE \\§ arrangements of flat surfaces became a curiously consistent feature of European and American presentations of African works.78 The visual flattening of the Fisk Figure is directly related to her entanglements with photography. Wendy Grossman has analyzed the intersections of African sculpture and modernist photography in European art, arguing persuasively, "Occu pying an ambiguous space between object and image, fact and fiction, presentation and re-presentation, collection and commodification, the photographic reframing of African ob jects helped shape Western perceptions of African life and cultures, with far-reaching implications not yet fully grasped today."79 The Fisk Figure's photographic representation ap peared at key junctures in the history of these interrelation ships. She may have been photographed first by Marius de Zayas or his brother in the summer of 1914. De Zayas had written to Stieglitz, "I have started working at the Trocadero, taking photographs of the negro art. My brother is the one who takes them and of course they are not very good but good enough to help me."80 Guillaume then invited de Zayas to see his "negres" and to take photographs as well.81 Guillaume must have been quick to appreciate the commercial value of photographic images of African art, for he was soon mailing such photographs to prospective clients; in a letter of Novem ber 10, 1916, he apologized profusely to de Zayas for sending photographs to another gallery in New York.82 The Fisk Figure, then, made her debut in the United States in a gallery dedicated specifically to photography, in a display that was designed by photographer Edward Steichen and manipu lated for Stieglitz's own photographs as if the exhibited works were part of a still life.83 Finally, she had a close personal relationship with Stieglitz: she was one of the nine docu mented works of African art that the eminent photographer still owned at the end of his life.84 We may never know why Stieglitz decided to purchase this particular statue for his small personal collection of African art. Unlike two other objects he owned, the Fisk Figure does not appear as a prop in one of his photographic portraits. One of the spoons exhibited with the Fisk Figure in 1914 appeared in an intimate image Stieglitz produced of Georgia O'Keeffe, his lover (and future wife), in 1919. In this portrait, which was never exhibited, Stieglitz photographed O'Keeffe holding the spoon aloft with the long fingers of her left hand.85 The white drapery around O'Keeffe's shoulders opens to expose her nude torso so that both the model and the photographer (though not the viewer) would be aware that her head, breasts, and navel mirror those carved into the handle of the spoon. In the second portrait, Stieglitz placed one of the masks from the exhibition on the chest of Claudia O'Keeffe, Georgia's sister.86 Stieglitz exhibited this 1922 pho tograph at the Anderson Galleries in 1923, anticipating the similar photographs of Man Ray that juxtapose a dark mask with a pale woman.87 As only the mouth and nostrils of the woman are visible in Stieglitz's photograph, the viewer fo cuses on the similarities of the curved lines of the lips and chins in addition to the contrast of the light and dark sur faces. Did the unclothed, exposed Fisk Figure inspire Stieglitz's photography in any way? Stieglitz's photographs of Georgia and Claudia O'Keeffe demonstrate that his pronouncements on the shared qualities of art made by women and art made by Africans (art he considered to be sensual, sexually charged, emotional, and untutored) led him to see the pol ished work of an accomplished African artist as directly anal ogous to the unadorned body of an American woman. Yet since these ideas must have been deeply rooted in Stieglitz's psychological makeup (as well as in the cultural views of gender and race that were prevalent in the late nineteenth century Europe of Stieglitz's youth), we should probably not hold the Fisk Figure responsible for their expression in this context. If a photographic portrait of the Fisk Figure had not al ready been taken by de Zayas or his brother in the summer of 1914, or by Stieglitz in the winter of 1914-15, a new photo graph must have been needed for her illustration in African Negro Art: Its Influence on Modern Art, a book de Zayas pub lished privately in 1916 (Fig. 1). The style of the image is similar to Charles Sheeler's photographs of numerous other African works owned by de Zayas, photographs displayed in New York City as independent works of art in de Zayas's new venue, the Modern Gallery, in 1917 and sold in twenty-two editions of a portfolio in 1918.88 Whoever produced this photograph, the illustration itself would implicate the Fisk Figure in what appears to be the earliest publication in English on African art. De Zayas had put together a short pamphlet to accompany the 1914 exhibition,89 and his book African Negro Art was available for perusal by visitors when de Zayas exhibited African art in the Modern Gallery in November 1916. The book's short text was illustrated with thirty-three reproduc tions.911 While de Zayas himself seems to have believed that his text was based on "theories that were widely accepted in the scientific community of his day,"91 readers today are appalled by what Rubin described as its "pervasive crackpot racism."92 To situate the text within the ideas of the period,93 we must return to de Zayas's letters of 1914, when he wrote to Stieglitz that "I have been talking with several people about my studies in the Evolution of Form, among them with the conservateur of the Trocadero. They all seemed to be very interested in the theory. I will make an effort to accomplish as much as I can in this work. . . ,"94 The studies undertaken by de Zayas must have included much of the literature then available on Africa, for he quotes unconnected data from an impressive number of ethnographic accounts. Unfortu nately, he combines their observations into a tirade about African peoples. De Zayas cites the Victorian adventurer Richard Burton as a source for his absurd claim that Africans revert to a childlike state in adulthood because their brains are formed differently from those of Europe ans, and he illustrates this with a pseudoscientific graph of l • • Q5 his own invention. " The basic premise underlying de Zayas's writing appears to reflect the theories of Count (Joseph) Arthur de Gobineau (1816-1882). By the time de Zayas was composing his text, French intellectuals such as Apollinaire already considered de Gobineau's theories outdated and offensive,96 and this may account for the fact that de Zayas does not cite the nineteenth-century writer directly. De Gobineau had written "The white [man] is much less gifted than the black or the</page><page sequence="18">110 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 1 yellow in sensual understanding. . . "It is thus that artistic genius . . . has only surged up following the union of the whites with the blacks"; and "But, when it is pure from all mixing with the blood of the blacks, there is no artistic creation for the Arian race. . . ,"97 De Zayas encapsulates this argument when he reiterates, ad nauseum, that Africans are scarcely human, egregiously stating that the abstraction of African art is a consequence of the presumed stunted mental state of its makers,98 while asserting paradoxically that mod ernists have made wonderful progress by studying the art produced by these inferior beings. Evidently, for de Zayas, modernist painting exemplified de Gobineau's ideal fusion of the "organizing and intelligent faculties" of the white artists and the "essence of art" that had sprung from a source "hidden in the blood" of Africans.99 A number of authors have argued persuasively that twen tieth-century primitivism emerged from Europeans' need to locate, in colonized lands and in colonized people, the eco nomic, social, spiritual, emotional, and sexual qualities they believed to be lacking in their own existence.100 These imag inative longings, despite their racist underpinnings, some times encouraged European artists to search for positive qualities in African cultures. Regrettably, the primitivist posi tion of African Negro Art was harsher; it gave readers in the United States (where slavery had been abolished only fifty years earlier) license to declare that there was an unfathom able gulf separating irrational African artists and rational European artists, as could be "observed" in fictional biologi cal differences: "Symbolism does not exist in the art of the Negro. ... his brain is in too primitive a condition to con tribute to a thing the significance of an idea. ... He gives form only to feeling."101 Some of the reviews of the 1914 exhibition in newspaper clippings assembled by de Zayas and transcribed by Francis Naumann already showed the noxious results of the pam phlet de Zayas had provided for visitors. For instance, in the New York American, Charles H. Caffin wrote: With what motive and under what kind of inspiration did the primitive artist carve these works? Mr. de Zayas ex plains that the savage looked out upon a world that seemed full of threats; that his imagination involved no idea of good, but only one of fear of mysterious agencies whose evil purposes he must avert. . . .102 Another response in de Zayas's files, by Forbes Watson in the New York Evening Post, was even more racist: In the case of these exhibits it was not necessary to explain that they are savages. Savage indeed! The rank savor of savagery attacks the visitor the instant he enters the dimin utive room. This rude carving belongs to the black recesses of the jungle. . . . The origin of these works is somewhat obscure. . . . But to whatever period they belong, and who ever created them, there can be no doubt that they convey a sense of a race of beings infinitely alien to us.103 Reviewers of later exhibitions of African art in de Zayas's Modern Gallery referred to African Negro Art in some detail. Yet some visitors challenged at least a few of de Zayas's assertions. A critic for the New York Herald, unwilling to accept de Zayas's characterization of African artists as incapable of critical thought and innovation, wrote in 1916: Real primitive art was not intended to be primitive. Its practitioners brought to their work everything they know about art. . . . They simply hadn't the technical knowledge of art to paint or sculpt otherwise.... If the primitives could come to life today they eagerly would seize upon all technical advances that art now could place at their dis posal and the artists they would look most askance at would be their imitators.104 A correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor, visiting the Modern Gallery when de Zayas was exhibiting both modern ist and African work, also posed intelligent questions: "is there such an abyss between the Gothic image-carver and the mystic black man of a primitive race making a symbolic elephant's head in the cathedral-like solitude of a tropical forest in Gabon?"105 The statements made by de Zayas were countered by a much more reasonable commentary on the formal qualities of African arts written by Thomas Munro in 1926.106 De Zayas's assumptions concerning the existence of a "primitive" mentality were then disproved by anthropologist Franz Boas's Primitive Art, first published in 1927. This scholarly study was based on actual data gathered about art in cultures around the world rather than on theoretical speculation.107 By 1938, Robert Goldwater's seminal book on primitivism presented European appropriations of African images as a straightfor ward interest in form rather than as a mystic union of oppos ing races.108 Nevertheless, the misbegotten ideas of de Zayas's publications may have laid the foundation for dominant art historical narratives circulating in the United States much later in the twentieth century. These narratives created a framework for the dismissal of African art as a product of mankind's primeval past, a manifestation of a "primitive" artist's irrational impulses.109 In Cote d'lvoire during the 1980s, statuary employed by diviners was sometimes accused of harboring diabolical forces. Lagoon therapists were passionate in their insis tence that their figures were, instead, able to counter the effects of discord and malice. Therefore, it is perhaps fitting that the illustration of the Fisk Figure appeared in a publication whose arguments were tied to the racist legacy of slavery. Whether the statue and her image perpetrated or contradicted hateful stereotypes, she was an integral part of this document, and thereby a participant in the earliest discourse on African art that circulated in the United States. The United States: Nashville, Tennessee, 1949 For over thirty years, the Fisk Figure lived quietly with Stieg litz, possibly appearing from time to time within his gallery spaces. During this time, other European Americans of the intellectual and cultural avant-garde continued to collect African statuary and to display it in their homes. However, it is the narratives constructed for African art by African Amer ican artists, writers, and collectors in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s that form a fascinating background for the next stage in the social life of the Fisk Figure. These begin with the</page><page sequence="19">THE AMERICAN LIFE OF A STATUE FROM COTE D'lVOIRF. ]}7 founding of colleges and institutes for African Americans and Native Americans after the Civil War, when only a handful of American universities would admit anyone who was not re garded as "white." As early as the 1870s, members of the American Missionary Association who had served in Africa brought objects from the continent to Fisk University, an institution they had established in Nashville, Tennessee. These African artworks allowed African American students and faculty to gain insights into specific cultures and their artistic production.110 Other views of Africans and African art were presented to a generation of young African Americans who went to Paris during the 1920s and 1930s to work, to study, to paint, or simply to visit. Some were veterans of World War I who stayed in France after the armistice, while others were sent abroad by organizations that funded their studies. In Paris, they met Francophone members of the African diaspora, particularly those from the Caribbean, but they were also exposed to the myths of French primitivism through spectacles such as the Colonial Exposition of 1931.111 In addition to observing first hand the connections between African art and the modernist work it had inspired, African American artists—including Hale Woodruff, Palmer Hayden, Aaron Douglas, and Lois Mailou Jones—experimented with modes of depicting Afri cans and African images.112 This generation of expatriates also developed networks of personal contacts with European Americans who were visiting Europe. These relationships would influence the reception of African art in the United States. Alain Locke, educated at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and conduct ing research in Europe as the first African American to be awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, met Guillaume during his stay in France. Locke introduced Guillaume to young African American writers and scholars such as Langston Hughes, Charles S.Johnson, and W. E. B. DuBois. In turn, Guillaume presented Locke to European Americans such as Albert Barnes and Carl Van Vechten.113 Some of the relationships forged in France would endure when the Americans re turned to the more hostile climate of their homeland. After moving back to Harlem, Johnson edited the literary magazine Opportunity, which featured articles on African art by both Locke and Barnes.114 Van Vechten's extravagant parties in his New York home were attended by the African Americans he had met in Paris and by other participants in what he called the "Negro renaissance." A self-taught photographer, Van Vechten produced important portraits of these artists, writers, musicians, and scholars, many of whom shared an interest in African cultures. African Americans were also being introduced to African art in the United States. In 1935, the Museum of Modern Art in New York held a blockbuster exhibition titled African Negro Art that showcased more than six hundred objects. A selected group of African artworks from this exhibition traveled to seven other American cities. According to the Museum of Modern Art, more than thirty thousand visitors viewed the show during the first two months. In a novel step for that time, the Museum of Modern Art made a concerted attempt to attract African Americans to the exhibition, and their records show that the attendance of this targeted audience was boosted by 6 percent.115 These contacts between European Americans and African Americans, seemingly mediated by modernism and a shared interest in African art, set the stage for Georgia O'Keeffe's decision to bequeath the Fisk Figure (together with approx imately four other African artworks and ninety-six paintings and prints by prominent European and European American modernists) to Fisk University after the death of her husband in 1946.llb O'Keeffe had divided Stieglitz's sizable estate into six major bequests, five of which were entrusted to art muse ums. Stieglitz's friend Van Vechten encouraged her to give the sixth bequest (the only one that included African art) to the university in Nashville. Van Vechten chose Thomas Mabry, Lincoln Kirstein, Aaron Douglas, Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence, and Fisk University President Charles S. Johnson to serve on the committee managing the bequest.117 Each member of this group would bring a unique experience of African art into the life of the Fisk Figure. Sociologist Johnson, who had befriended Van Vechten in Paris and in Harlem, had become the first African American president of Fisk University in 1936. As a writer and editor, he had provided literary venues for the discussion of African art and the celebration of African heritage. Douglas, the distin guished chair of Fisk's art department, had carefully studied the African artworks in the collection of the American Mu seum of Natural History in New York. He had come to Fisk in 1929 to paint a series of murals in the university's library, and he had returned to the university in 1937 to launch a pro gram of instruction in art. The result of Douglas's interest in the forms and meanings of African sculpture can be clearly seen in the imagery of his own art. For example, one of Douglas's 1934 studies for the mural titled Aspects of Negro Life: The Negro in an African Setting contains an image of a generic African statue whose proportions, clarity, and commanding presence (though not its pose) recall those of the Fisk Figure (Fig. 23). The central position of the statue's silhouette within Douglas's mural gives it considerable impact in the composition. As a representative of Fisk, Douglas was a nat ural choice for the committee. In addition, he had known Van Vechten in New York, where the influential socialite had taken his photographic portrait and commissioned him to paint the walls of Van Vechten's bathroom.118 Thomas Dabney Mabry, a European American, had taught at Fisk as well as at Vanderbilt, the university across town that admitted only whites. In Nashville, Mabry "had become keenly aware of the American Negro's lack of a tangible cultural history, and he felt strongly that African sculpture should not be limited to a privileged urban audience."119 As the executive director of the Museum of Modern Art (where he also knew Van Vechten), Mabry had helped commission Walker Evans and Peter Sekaer to photograph some 477 of the objects in the museum's 1935 African Negro Art exhibition, photographs that were gathered into seventeen portfolios. With funding from the General Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation, the Museum of Modern Art donated some of the portfolios to the 135th Street branch of the New York Public Library, now the Schomberg Center for Research in Black Culture, and to the colleges and universities that, during this time of legally enforced segregation, admitted the most talented African American students in the United States: Fisk University, Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta,</page><page sequence="20">118 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 1 23 Aaron Douglas, study for Aspects of Negro Life: The Negro in an African Setting, 1934, gouache with touches of graphite on illustration board, 14% X 16 in.

Seventy-five of the photographs taken for the portfolio were then copied and mounted for a traveling display of photographs hosted by those six colleges and nine other institutions that were open to African American students. The other European American on the committee, Lincoln Kirstein, was also actively involved with the Museum of Mod ern Art. A flamboyant entrepreneur who had launched the New York City Ballet, Kirstein was a particularly close friend of Van Vechten. As an impresario, he knew dancers such as Feral Benga, who had emigrated from French West Africa to Paris in the 1930s and had made a memorable visit to New York. Like Van Vechten, Kirstein was well-to-do and seems to have moved freely in New York society as well as in the city's homosexual demimonde. Both Kirstein and Van Vechten were frequent visitors to Harlem nightclubs in the years before World War II. Two younger members on the committee, Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence, had begun their painting ca reers in Harlem. By 1949, both had produced an impressive body of work. Bearden wrote of his encounter with the exhi bition of African art that Mabry had helped organize: My interest in African art goes back to a show at the Museum of Modern art [sic] in the 1930's, when I was a young boy. . . . this African art was something that I wanted to look at and see what the philosophy was, discover what were some of the ideas that emanated from this work. I wanted to try and understand the African vision of the world—because there are so many varying African forms. . .,120 Bearden's informed use of urban, rural, African, and Amer ican references in his paintings and collages was to provide guidance for artists throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Law rence, known for his clear and forceful narratives of African American history, was less engaged with the art and cultures of the African continent until he visited Nigeria in 1964. There he worked with Nigerian artists, and he subsequently brought African subjects into his works.121 Of all the members of the committee, its chairman was the most enigmatic. Van Vechten exemplified the complexity of interracial relationships and primitivism in the mid-twentieth century. After years as a writer and critic, Van Vechten had sought guidance from Stieglitz in order to become a photog rapher, and he then produced the impressive series of por traits of prominent African Americans mentioned above. Yet his activities in Harlem would be characterized today as ho mosexual tourism, and he wrote a salacious novel in 1928 {Nigger Heaven) that drove some former friends to hang him in effigy on 135th Street. A recent book by James Smalls illustrates photographs Van Vechten took of nude men in romantic poses and suggests that he, like Stieglitz, associated African art with unfettered sexuality.122 In newly discovered photographs from the 1930s and 1940s, kept for years in a sealed box in the Beinecke Library at Yale University, Van Vechten's white friends and black models pose with African and "Africanesque" objects against backdrops of foliage. A</page><page sequence="21">THE AMERICAN LIFE OF A STATUE FROM COTE D'lVOIRE HQ very young black man, identified by Smalls as a dancer named Juante or Allen Meadows, was posed holding an African figure, just as Stieglitz had photographed Georgia O'Keeffe holding an African spoon. Van Vechten photographed this young model in color and in black-and-white, in a feathered headdress and in the nude. In one portrait, Meadows holds an oval African face mask over his genitals.123 In all of these photographs, the African American body and the African objects are clearly objects of desire rather than active agents. Each member of the committee that brought the Fisk Figure to Nashville thus had compelling ties to modernism in the United States, to African art, and to African American communities. But what were Georgia O'Keeffe's own entan glements with the Fisk Figure and with African art? In 192S, after Stieglitz had photographed her with one of his African spoons, and shortly after he photographed her sister with one of his African masks, O'Keeffe painted Mask with Golden Apple, in rich brown, yellow, and red hues.124 The mask she por trays, like the one Stieglitz used in his portrait of Claudia O'Keeffe, was included in her donation to Fisk University. Unlike Stieglitz's photographs of Georgia and Claudia O'Keeffe, the painting presents the African artwork without a human body, masculine or feminine—unless the reddish gold sphere of the apple in the foreground represents some human feature. The mask looks upward rather than hanging on a person or a wall, and both the sculpture and the apple are about twice life-size. The scale, the simplification of the forms, and the focus on the smooth planes of the mask's face encourage us to see it as a beautiful, rhythmic series of curved shapes—an approach we would expect from this renowned artist. Unfortunately, the painting gives us few clues about O'Keeffe's interaction with the Fisk Figure. Did O'Keeffe ever bring the statue to her homes in New Mexico? She kept five or six of the other African artworks that Stieglitz purchased from Guillaume in 1915 and 1916. According to at least one source, African art was a "touchstone" in her life.125 But we do not know what specific memories the Fisk Figure held for her, even though Stieglitz may have associated the statue with O'Keeffe herself. O'Keeffe's decision to place the Fisk Figure and the other African artworks in an institution accessible to African Amer icans may also have been influenced by her interest in Beau ford Delaney (1901-1979). Born and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee, in a large, loving, and devout family, Delaney left to study painting in Boston. He then worked in Paris and New York, eventually dying in a Paris asylum after struggling with a lifetime of poverty and bouts of insanity. Delaney had met Steiglitz while attending his lectures at the gallery called An American Place. He probably knew both Van Vechten and Kirstein when he lived in Greenwich Village and socialized with members of its homosexual community. He associated with other African American artists (such as Lawrence and Bearden) when he worked in Harlem. O'Keeffe had been introduced to this charismatic and talented man by a female friend, the painter Mary Callery, who had hired Delaney as a model. In comments recorded over forty years later, O'Keeffe recalled, "I found that he had no heat in his studio and needed to keep warm. He seemed a very special sort of person so I began drawing him too."126 Her extraordinary charcoal and pastel studies of Delaney's face, dated to 1943, are among the very few portraits Georgia O'Keeffe created as a mature artist.12' At least one source recounts that Delaney may have begun work the same year on a large oil painting titled Still Life with Idol}2 The "idol" of the painting is a large black-and-white female figure that almost fills the canvas, set against a background of greenish and yellowish hues. Al though Delaney gave the figure a more naturalistically ren dered body and a bulky load to carry, and one of her round eyes is blank, she is recognizable as the Fisk Figure. Delaney may have seen the Fisk Figure at Stieglitz's gallery, but the dates assigned to this painting suggest that he became en tranced by her while posing for Georgia O'Keeffe.129 If so, the strong reaction the Fisk Figure elicited in the African American painter from Tennessee may have impressed O'Keeffe. Delaney's creative response to this African artwork was perhaps responsible for O'Keeffe's decision to place the Fisk Figure on permanent display in a venue where she would be accessible to talented African Americans. Given the varied backgrounds of the individuals on the committee and her own experiences with African art, O'Keeffe may have been thinking of a variety of issues when she formally opened an exhibition of the collection at a gymnasium at Fisk University, a building that had been ren ovated and renamed as the Carl Van Vechten Gallery of Fine Arts. O'Keeffe's statement in the catalog distributed during that opening ceremony in 1949 presents only her belief in the value of art education: This part of the Stieglitz Collection goes to Fisk University with the hope that it may show that there are many ways of seeing and thinking, and possibly, through showing that there are many ways, give some one confidence in his own way, which may be different, whatever its direction.130 The catalog included an illustration of the Fisk Figure, her first new photographic portrait since 1915-16. There she is listed as "Standing Figure with Bowl on Head. Wood sculp ture, Ivory Coast, XIX Century, height 14 inches, reproduced in de Zayas, African Negro Art, 1916."131 This caption reminds the reader of the Fisk Figure's position as an early twentieth century avatar of modernism as she negotiated an important transaction across the gaping cultural fissure of American racism in 1949. The United States: New York, 1984 Seen by generations of students but far removed from the galleries and museums of New York City, the Fisk Figure entered the New York art world once again when her image appeared in the catalog of one of the era's most controversial exhibitions, the Museum of Modern Art's Primitivism in 20th Century Art. Jack Flam argues that William Rubin brought about the end of an era when he organized this huge show in the early 1980s; it certainly launched a new discourse on the relationship between European and European American art ists and the arts of Africans, Native Americans, and peoples of the Pacific.132 The photograph de Zayas had reproduced in 1916 allowed the statue from Cote d'lvoire to participate in debates of the 1980s, which would usher in new paradigms. For many scholars of modernism, the narrative of the</page><page sequence="22">120 art bulletin march 2012 volume xciv number 1 Primitivism exhibition appeared innocuous. It simply sought to illustrate patterns of appropriation that linked the great European and European American heroes of twentieth-cen tury modernism to the African, Oceanic, and Native Ameri can objects that had been their inspiration; ostensibly, it consisted of a playful search for formal similarities as well as scholarly attempts to document who saw what when. How ever, for many viewers with personal or scholarly interests in non-European cultures, the underlying assumption of the exhibition was clear: that these masterpieces—expressions of alternative universes from Africa, the Americas, and the is lands of the Pacific—had been valued only as raw material by the modernist artists who had exploited them in the most superficial ways. The passions aroused by the exhibition tes tify to the enduring powers of enchantment within artworks such as the Fisk Figure, for even though the exhibition (and the catalog) had stripped these objects of their original meanings, values, histories, identities, and even, in many cases, their intended visual impact, their collective presence (once again) transformed the field of art history. The illustration of the Fisk Figure that had been used for de Zayas's Negro African Art was reproduced in the exhibition catalog for Rubin's essay on Picasso, with this caption: "Fig ure. Ivory Coast. Wood. Published in Marius de Zayas, African Negro Art: Its Influence on Modern Art, 1916." It is interesting to note that neither the Stieglitz Collection nor Fisk University was mentioned.133 The comparison that Rubin sets up for the Fisk Figure in his essay reveals some of the basic problems in his approach to primitivism. The Fisk Figure may still have been in the Ivory Coast in 1907, when Picasso created a series of drawings and paintings related to his notorious painting of that year, Les demoiselles d'Avignon. Despite Rubin's sugges tion, the Fisk Figure is not, then, a likely source for Picasso's ideas during those pivotal years. On the other hand, a female figure from the Lagoon region in the collection of the Musee du Trocadero in 1895134 may have been studied by Picasso during his famous trip to the dusty museum (Fig. 24).135 Like the Fisk Figure, this Lagoon statue holds a platter on her head. Admittedly, she may have triggered the manifold ver sions of this pose in Picasso's artwork. However, even if such an interchange could be proved, it would offer only more insights into Picasso and his views of female sexuality;136 it would not tell us what ideas might have been shared by the African artist and his European counterpart, or how this particular African piece exerted agency in its relationship with Picasso. As previously mentioned, the Fisk Figure may have served as a model for Brancusi's Prodigal Son or First Step, a wooden figure sculpted by the artist in 1913 and 1914 and displayed at the 291 Gallery in 1914.137 But Brancusi's interest in the formal qualities of the Fisk Figure did not lead to an interest in African artistic traditions, and the connection yielded no lasting significance. A more interesting entanglement evi dently joined the Fisk Figure and the Lithuanian-born Amer ican artist William Zorach. In 1918, Zorach visited the Mod ern Gallery, where he must have at least glanced at de Zayas's African Negro Art. In response to these encounters, Zorach carved a wooden statue of his son, Tessim, standing with his arms above his head.138 Unlike Picasso's images of standing figures with upraised arms, Zorach's statue captures some thing of the monumentality, dignity, and harmony of the Fisk Figure, transposing Lagoon images of femininity into an American image of childhood. Perhaps yet another result of Zorach's engagement with African art might be his bronze portrait of the African American educator Dr. James Edward Shepard, which the artist cast in 1956 for North Carolina Central University, a historically black university (HBCU). Although this monument shares very few formal features with the Fisk Figure, the context of the commission itself reveals Zorach's professional relationships with men and women of African heritage, interactions that may have begun with his early interest in the Fisk Figure and African art. From the perspective of the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries, the Primitivism catalog is more remarkable for what was "written out" of the text than for what it included. The lack of attention to the identity, the provenance, or the original context of the Fisk Figure represents only one of its significant omissions. Gail Levin's essay on American artists who responded to African and Native American art in the 1920s and 1930s, for example, did not include a single refer ence to the ideas of Alain Locke, and she mentions none of the African American artists who were studying African art in France or the United States during those decades.139 Kirk Varnedoe's slim final chapter, "Contemporary Explorations," a discussion of African and Native American sources for environmental arts and installations of the 1970s and early 1980s, contains only two illustrations of works by African Americans. A 1977 structure by Martin Puryear is said to "evoke tribal dwellings, shrines, and implements," but no mention is made of the artist's Peace Corps service in Sierra Leone or his contact with African art.140 In fact, Puryear became acquainted with the Fisk Figure when he held his first teaching position, at Fisk University in 1971-73. Bearden's famous 1964 collage Prevalence of Ritual: Baptism allows Varnedoe to acknowledge that a "new climate of awareness has fruitfully opened the way for many artists to renew contact with their own heritages," but he concludes only that this "has produced a highly variable yield in art."141 Because he does not examine the significance of these heritages, he makes no comparison that would illuminate why and how an African American artist (such as Bearden) and a European artist (such as Hannah Hoch) could draw very different meanings from the African references in their collages. More glaring erasures are present in Rubin's introduction to the catalog. American readers whose identities were closely tied to African, Native American, and Pacific cultures were dismayed by the unexamined Eurocentrism of Rubin's pro nouncements. In a widely quoted passage, he repeatedly assumed that his views, his experience, and his very identity were shared by all readers, as may be seen in his use of the word "ours": This ethnocentrism is a function nevertheless of one of modernism's greatest virtues: its unique approbation of the arts of other cultures. Ours is the only society that has prized a whole spectrum of arts of distant and alien cul tures. Its consequent appropriation of these arts has in vested modernism with a particular vitality that is a prod uct of cultural cross-fertilization.142</page><page sequence="23">THE AMERICAN LIFE OF A STATUE FROM COTE D IVOIRE j21 This passage expresses, moreover, a particularly problematic construct: the notion that the European modernists were unique in their ability to borrow ideas from foreign popula tions. This paradigm appears more incongruous with every passing year; as modernism falls into its place in art history, it is no longer seen as a universal ideal but as one historical period among many. The appropriations of modernists can now be compared with those of artists in other times and places. Meanwhile, research into early twentieth-century primitivism is being increasingly balanced by studies of Afri can, Asian, and Latin American artists who responded to a "whole spectrum of arts of distant and alien cultures" when they adopted the media, techniques, iconographies and ide ologies of nineteenth- and twentieth-century European paint ing and sculpture in order to create their own modernist traditions.143 For example, during the years of Picasso's en gagement with African sculptural traditions, his Nigerian contemporary Aina Onabolu was experimenting with the pictorial traditions of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England, modeling his paintings on what he regarded as the novel and exciting visual language of Sir Joshua Reynolds.144 John Peffer would have us return to the interchanges that were so inadequately addressed by the Primitivism exhibition and its catalog. Writing in 2005, he argues that scholars of African art can escape the ahistorical nature of their field work data by turning to histories of African objects in di aspora—by evaluating the contributions of African artworks as if they were Africans in diaspora.143 The discourse would then shift from readings of local (African) meanings and contexts to analyses of African artworks as agents in regional, continental, and global worlds. Peffer's arguments (and the abiding interest in primitivism revealed by current art histor ical discourse) show that the issues the exhibition has gener ated have not yet been fully explored. This narration of the life history of the Fisk Figure may encourage further discus sion of the agency of specific African artworks within the context of these debates. The United States: Dallas, 1989 Five long years after Primitivism in 20th Century Art opened in New York, another exhibition, titled Black Art—Ancestral Leg acy: The African Impulse in African-American Art, was organized for the Dallas Museum of Art. This exhibition challenged some of the basic tenets of Primitivism. David Driskell, in his introductory essay, expressed his hope for "a more positive and holistic view of art and history," promising that the Dallas exhibition would help "to define new horizons in American visual culture" by showing the "ancestral bonds which still exist" and "the diversity of black American creativity."148 Sig nificantly, the catalogs of both exhibitions discussed the Fisk Figure. For Black Art—Ancestral Legacy, a new photograph of the Fisk Figure fills the page, illustrating an essay containing a brief history of the statue's life at Fisk.14' In a contribution to the catalog, Edmund Barry Gaither wrote that African art owned by historically black colleges and universities repre sented their students' "spiritual heritage."148 The appearance of the Fisk Figure in this context returns us to her history in this African American community. After being placed in the Carl Van Vechten Gallery in 1949, the Fisk Figure remained on permanent display for 24 Female figure in a Lagoon style, in the collection of the Musee du Trocadero in 1898, current location unknown (artwork in the public domain; photograph reproduced with the permission of Barry Kitnick) twenty-five years. It attracted other African works to Fisk, including an important donation in 1952 that was housed in what is now the Aaron Douglas Gallery.149 It also drew im portant art exhibitions to the university, including a display of works by noted Nigerian painter and sculptor Ben En wonwu in 1956.150 Deteriorating conditions in the Carl Van Vechten Gallery required the university to put the entire Stieglitz Collection in storage in 1974, but restora tions allowed the works to be reinstalled between 1984 and 1987.151 Driskell arrived at Fisk University in the 1960s, taking over Douglas's position when the department's founder retired. Driskell remembers that Douglas showed him Fisk's portfolio of photographs of African artworks in the Museum of Mod ern Art exhibition of 1935.152 Driskell, like Douglas, brought students and visitors into the Carl Van Vechten Gallery to interact with the African artworks, and he developed a per sonal relationship with the objects. As Driskell's office was located in the gallery, he encountered the Fisk Figure con standy.153 Douglas had been intimately acquainted with the African objects at Fisk, but Driskell approached them with a new level of understanding. Douglas had not been able to travel to Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, and Liberia until late in his career. As a result, his murals convey his youthful dreams of an ideal Africa (Fig. 23). Driskell, in contrast, visited Senegal,</page><page sequence="24">122 art bulletin march 2012 volume xciv number 1 Cote d'lvoire and Nigeria as a young man and worked with Nigerian artists at the University of Ife in 1969. As he traveled repeatedly to the continent, for much of his career his art reflected his ongoing experience of African cultures and peoples. Douglas was a friend of Locke, a champion of modernism who was introduced to Africa through primitivism and who argued that African American artists ought to express their distinctive heritage through their responses to African art.154 Driskell had studied under James Porter at Howard Univer sity, and Porter had had serious disagreements with Locke. Porter, unimpressed by the modernist works he observed in Paris in the 1930s, contended that African American artists should not be obligated to produce art that was either mod ernist or demonstrably African in its formal language. Locke had traveled to Egypt and the Sudan, witnessing Howard Carter's ceremonial opening of the tomb of Tutankhamun, but Porter was able to travel to western Africa when he participated in the First World Festival of Negro Arts, held in Dakar in 1967. In Senegal, he met African artists engaged in the challenges of inventing new forms of art using both modernist and nonmodernist conventions. Thus, his views of African artistic traditions were not necessarily mediated by European modernism, as can be seen in this address from 1962: ... it was through the eyes of white Europeans that we first learned to look at it [African art] admiringly and finally to study it to the point of saturation. I, for one, am not ashamed of knowledge thus acquired, but must aver that long ago, at the knees of my father, I learned about the black peoples of Africa, and in that way, acquired an abiding interest in them as a people and as representatives of a complex and richly endowed civilization.155 At the same conference, artist Ernest Crichlow shared his sentiments, saying, "I have come to my concern and inter est in Africa by searching and trying to understand myself," while painter John Biggers claimed that Africa and African art had "the meaning of a return to his artistic and cultural roots."156 It was Porter who inspired Driskell to travel to Africa, and it was he who encouraged him, during his ten years at Fisk University, to teach art history courses that centered on Afri can as well as African American art, referring to the African works in the Stieglitz Collection.157 In 1949, the Fisk Figure had been valued for her formal qualities and for the inspira tion she gave to art students. During the 1960s, Driskell and his students were finally able to reflect on the sophistication of her content as well as her form. For them, the figure from Cote d'lvoire was no longer a survivor of a shadowy past but a tangible connection to a living, pan-African heritage. The appropriation (or, in some cases, the retention) of African images, techniques, concepts, ideologies, and iconog raphies by artists of the African diaspora was, of course, the topic of the Black Art—Ancestral Legacy exhibition in 1989. Both the varied works in the exhibition and the biographies provided in the catalog reveal how many African American artists had made pilgrimages to the newly independent na tions of Africa. As sculptor Mel Edwards wrote in an impor tant survey of African American artists, "I go to Africa every chance I get. I've probably been there more times since 1970 than I've been to my home state of Texas."158 The importance of the insights gained by artists who had worked on the African continent is underscored by two works that did not appear in that exhibition. One is a drawing from Driskell's sketchbooks, and the other the painting taken from that sketch that he completed in about 1974.159 In the study, the Fisk Figure is surrounded by waves of energy and the hint of feathery wings, and appears to bring into view the super natural forces that the sculpture once wielded in Cote d'lvoire (Fig. 25). Driskell's comprehension of the Fisk Fig ure as a powerful, protective being reveals much more of its original life than any primitivist interpretation had done previously. Dancing Angel, the final painting, presents the central figure in a bright explosion of color (Fig. 26). It reminds us that spirits addressed by statuary in the Lagoon region were said to be gleaming and full of light. During the 1980s, French speakers in the Lagoon region often translated local terms for these guiding spirits as angels (anges). Some how, the Fisk Figure was able to communicate with the artist directly, inserting herself into one of the major themes of his oeuvre, disclosing her original "angelic" identity while con necting him to a new artistic language and a new cultural milieu. In this process, she unleashed unexpected forms of agency. United States: Nashville, 2008 Driskell left Fisk University in the 1970s, and new generations of students and professors visited the Carl Van Vechten Gal lery. By the end of the twentieth century, the aging exhibition space was suffering from structural problems that had not been alleviated by the earlier restorations of 1984-87. Fisk fell on hard times, as talented students began to be recruited by the elite colleges that had previously been reluctant to admit African Americans. Repeated financial crises brought the university to the brink of closing. In 2005, the collection was again placed in storage, this time in the safety of Nash ville's Frist Center for the Visual Arts, and the Carl Van Vechten Gallery was closed. Administrators looked into the possibility of selling selected works from the Stieglitz Collec tion, whose monetary worth in the burgeoning art market exceeded the university's fiscal deficits. At the same time, its upkeep had become prohibitively expensive.160 At this point the Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation, representing the interests of the deceased donor, laid legal claim to the Stieglitz Col lection on the grounds that Fisk was breaking the terms of the original bequest by failing to keep the works on public view. The foundation's suit proposed that the works be taken away from Fisk so that the Stieglitz Collection could be properly cared for in a New Mexico museum.161 Fisk University appeared to have found a solution to these financial and legal troubles when the Crystal Bridges Mu seum of Bentonville, Arkansas, offered to purchase two of the most famous works in the Stieglitz Collection, O'Keeffe's Radiator Building—Night, New York and Marsden Hartley's Painting No. 3.162 The Crystal Bridges Museum, established by an heir to the founder of the Walmart chain of retail stores, was generously funded. However, it needed historically and aesthetically significant artworks to display in its vast exhibi</page><page sequence="25">THE AMERICAN LIFE OF A STATUE FROM COTE D'lVOIRE 123 25 David Driskell, Study for Dancing Angel, ca. 1974, pigment on paper. Collection of David Driskell/Carter Foundation (artwork © David Driskell/Carter Foundation; photograph provided by the artist) tion spaces. For twenty-first-century cultural institutions, paintings such as the canonical work by O'Keeffe possess celebrity status. Of course, the Fisk Figure had also been treated as a celebrity in 1914 by reporters who had discov ered, thanks to the sensational Armory Show of the previous year, that art exhibitions could provide them with highly entertaining (even scandalous) material. When the outright sale of O'Keeffe's painting seemed to be legally impossible, the Crystal Bridges Museum reportedly offered Fisk thirty million dollars to share the collection on a temporary, rotating basis. This arrangement, although benefi cial to both institutions, was halted by Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle in a Nashville courtroom in February 2008. In March of that year, Chancellor Lyle ruled that the O'Keeffe Foundation could not assume ownership of the collection, but she required Fisk to place the works on public display. Fortunately, Fisk's new president, Hazel R. O'Leary, launched a successful fund raising campaign that allowed the Carl Van Vechten Gallery to be repaired and remodeled. An opening was celebrated on October 3, 2008, and a commemorative booklet composed by curator Victor Simmons notes the "special place" of the Stieg litz Collection among the approximately 3,800 artworks owned by Fisk. The five African works in the collection, together with nearly one hundred modernist works, were back on permanent display by the summer of 2009.163 26 Driskell, Dancing Angel, ca. 1974, oil, fabric, and collage on canvas, 60 X 40 in.

At one acrimonious juncture, an attorney representing Fisk showed the courtroom large illustrations of two abstract art works in the Stieglitz Collection, arguing that these modern ist works by "Caucasian" artists had "nothing to do with Fisk." He then held up a poster of a painting by Henry O. Tanner, an artist whose work is in another Fisk University collection, exclaiming, "This is a real prize. This is a prize by a black artist. This is a prize that really needs to be kept in Nash ville."164 By the summer of 2011, judicial rulings facilitated the potential transfer of the Fisk Figure, together with the rest of the Stieglitz Collection, to Bentonville on a rotating schedule.</page><page sequence="26">124 art bulletin march 2012 volume xciv number 1 In all legal proceedings relating to Fisk University's own ership of the collection, lawyers and judges scrutinized the letters and the speeches of O'Keeffe, examining the reasons for her donation. Was it true that her gift "to an African American university made a public statement and gesture to heighten the consciousness of a segregated society that Afri can-Americans and their institutions ranked equally, among and as a vital part of American society and the cultural arts," as Chancellor Lyle ruled?165 Or, as one of Fisk University's lawyers believes, did O'Keeffe merely want modernist art to be accessible in the South as well as on the East Coast and in Chicago (where the institutions that received the other five bequests were located)?166 The social history of the Fisk Figure, intertwined as it has been with the entire modernist enterprise, demonstrates that unpacking the many layers of intellectual, social, philosophical, and even sexual attitudes that inspired the donation will require lengthy investigation. So rather than attempting to ascertain the wishes of O'Keeffe or seeking to address the contemporary desires of the citizens of Nashville, perhaps the judges should ask, in W.J. T. Mitchell's phrase, what the "pictures really want."167 In fact, they should not only consult the paintings in the Stieglitz Collection, they also need to address the most cos mopolitan and influential of the artworks, the Fisk Figure.168 What does this statue really want? Although Mitchell might remind us that the Fisk Figure has been a "subaltern" (and a feminine one at that), we have seen how she has exercised considerable agency in the past. Does the Fisk Figure desire a restitution of some form of her lost authority, what Mitchell has called "mastery"?169And what would happen to the nar ratives of the history of art if this African statue were "invited to speak"?170 Clearly, the Fisk Figure is ensnared in the commodification of the Stieglitz Collection. Lawyers have passionately argued that Fisk University needs to tap into the monetary worth of the artworks donated by O'Keeffe. Unfortunately, the pres ence of African objects in the Stieglitz Collection has rarely been mentioned by the journalists covering the controversy, or by the lawyers and judges debating its fate, an omission that places African art on the margins of the legal battles. Observers may wonder whether African art is of fading inter est to the people of Tennessee. Will the handful of African artworks in the Stieglitz Collection connect someone in Ar kansas to Africa, or to an ancestral past? Will the Fisk Figure be able to interact with a generadon attuned to fleeting visual images rather than to the physical experience of an artwork's presence—possibly by appearing for the first time on the Internet? Whatever her future, it is my hope that this wooden sculpture from Cote d'lvoire will continue to confront view ers in ways that are immediate and unexpected. Monica Blackmun Visona, an associate professor at the University of Kentucky, recently published Constructing African Art Histories for the Lagoons of Cote d'lvoire and is co-editing A Blackwell Companion to Modern African Art. Her essay in that volume examines the use of European top hats by western African warriors [Department of Art, FA 207, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky. 40506-0022, m.b.visona@uky.edu]. Notes I would like to thank several reviewers who provided valuable insights and critiques of different versions of this essay, including Yaelle Biro, Richard Powell, Robert Jensen, Karen Lang, and the two anonymous readers for The Art Bulletin. I am grateful to Victor Simmons of Fisk University for his interest and assistance and to the many generous people who helped me obtain photographs and permissions for the illustrations. A Summer Research Grant from the University of Kentucky allowed me to write the first full draft, while Barbara Blackmun provided me with a research library and critical commen tary. Funding for my research in Cote d'lvoire was provided by the Fulbright Foundation (in 1983-84) and by the University of California, Santa Barbara, with the support of the Kress Foundation (in 1981); a Senior Fellowship at the National Museum of African Art (in 2004-5) allowed me to review and synthesize that material. Unless otherwise noted, all translations are mine. 1. Arnold Hauser, The Philosophy of Art History (London: Routledge, 1959), 205. 2. Susan M. Vogel, Fang: An Epic Journey (New York: Prince Street Pic tures, 2001), VHS film, was accompanied by a booklet edited by Vogel that transcribes a roundtable titled Idol Becomes Art! In the booklet, Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett is quoted as "recognizing that these [Fang] objects have lives that extend well beyond the source—and that their life [in the West] may be much longer than the time they existed before they were collected" (12-13). 3. In her recent dissertation, Yaelle Biro points out that as early as 1981 Rene Bravmann exhorted Africanists to become "biographers" of ob jects, examining their "birth, their lives (public and private) and even their deaths." See Biro, Transformation de I'objet ethnographique africain en objet d'art: Circulation, commerce et diffusion des oeuvres africaines en Europe Occidentals et aux Etats-Unis, des annees 1900 aux ann'ees 1920 (PhD diss., Universite de Paris I: La Sorbonne, 2010), 21. Unfortu nately, I do not have access to Biro's bibliography, so I do not know where Bravmann made this statement. 4. The seminal articles by Aijun Appadurai on the "social life of things" and Igor Kopytoff on the "cultural biography of things" appeared in Appadurai, ed., The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspec tive (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986). For a useful, con densed overview of some of the important contributions to the dis course they inspired, see Elizabeth Edwards, Chris Gosden, and Ruth B. Phillips, eds., Sensible Objects: Colonialism, Museums and Material Cul ture (Oxford: Berg, 2006), 11-14. 5. The concept of "entanglement" is taken from Nicholas Thomas, En tangled Objects: Exchange, Material Culture, and Colonialism in the Pacific (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991). 6. In his highly influential work Art and Agency: An Anthropological Theory (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), Alfred Gell refers to Michael Taussig's willingness to consider how the art object can act as if it had intention; see Taussig's Mimesis and Alterity (London: Routledge, 1993). As Nicholas Thomas explains, in one of his masterful summa ries of Art and Agency, Gell suggests that "iconic objects in particular can occupy positions in the networks of human social agency that are almost equivalent to the positions of humans themselves"; Thomas, introduction to Christopher Pinney and Thomas, eds., Beyond Aesthet ics: Art and the Technologies of Enchantment (Oxford: Berg, 2001), 3, 5. 7. Julia Kelly, Art, Ethnography and the Life of Objects: Paris c. 1925-1935 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2007), 18. Kelly does not seem to consider African, Oceanic, and Native American artworks to be equivalent to (or of equal status with) objects and images manipu lated by European artists. 8. Johannes Fabian has repeatedly challenged scholars to interrogate the ways time is experienced, conceptualized, and recorded cross-cultur ally. For example, many of the issues related to the reconstruction of the Fisk Figure's origins are raised in "Inquiry as Event: About En counters and the Making of Knowledge in Africa," one of the particu larly useful chapters in his volume Memory against Culture: Arguments and Reminders (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2007). 9. For discussions of the methodology involved in this art historical re search, see Monica Blackmun Visona, Constructing African Art Histories for the Lagoons of Cote d'lvoire (Burlington, Vt.: Ashgate, 2010). 10. Diverse orthographies were created when local names for groups of people (some of them pejorative terms for neighbors or enemies) were transcribed from Lagoon languages into French. Others were written using standard conventions by trained linguists. Complex local histories and shifting definitions of ethnicity also complicate the divi sion of Lagoon populations into neat categories. However, the litera ture usually categorizes the Lagoon peoples as the Abe (Abbey), Abi dji, Abure, Adjukru (Adioukrou), Ahizi (Aizi), Akye (Attie), Aladyan (Alladian), Avikam, Ega, Esuma (Assini), Mekyibo (Eotile), Gwa (Mbatto), Kyaman (Ebrie), and Krobu.

The mission was located in Memni, an Akye town not far from Kya man and Gwa communities. Some works from Pere Meraud's collec tion are now in the Musee Africain in Lyons. In 1984, the rest of the collection was being stored by Msgr. Bernard Yago, then the arch bishop of Abidjan. I am grateful to the archbishop, who was later ele vated to cardinal, for generously allowing me to study these objects at his official residence. 12. Sadly, accession records compiled by Bohumil Holas, the European director who supervised the National Museum in the 1960s and 1970s, are missing (if they ever existed). Holas also appears to have been quite casual about data on specific works that he included in his many publications. For problematic assumptions that affected the re cords of French colonial museums and their collecting practices, see Philip L. Ravenhill, "The Passive Object and the Implicit Paradigm: Colonial Museography in French West Africa," in Proceedings of the May 1988 Conference and Workshop on African Material Culture (New York: Rockefeller Foundation, 1988), 99-101. 13. The photographic files of the Goldwater Library of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, recorded this information in the cards af fixed to each photograph. I am grateful to Virginia-Lee Webb and to Nicole Jeanne Cuenot for their assistance with this archive. I thank Zoe Strother for reminding me of the importance of the collection of the Liverpool Museums. 14. For one of the many examples of William Fagg's magisterial organiza tional approach, see Fagg and Margaret Plass, African Sculpture: An Anthology (London: Studio Vista, 1970). For the persistence of this system of classification in the art market today (and the ongoing primitivist assumption that African populations are "tribes"), see the popular book by Jean-Baptiste Bacquart, The Tribal Arts of Africa (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1998). 15. The most articulate challenge to the notion that African artworks may be assigned to ethnic groups on the basis of style was written by Sid ney Littlefield Kasfir, "One Tribe, One Style? Paradigms in the Histo riography of African Art," History in Africa 11 (1984): 163-93; see also Monica Blackmun Visona, "The Limitations of Labels," African Arts 20, no. 4 (1987): 38. 16.

Denise Paulme, Une societe de Cote d'lvoire hier et aujourd'hui: Les Bete (Paris: Mouton, 1962): "aucun artisan, ils ne connaissaient ni le travail du bois, ni le tissage, ni la vannerie." This statement is referred to in Bohumil Holas, L'image du monde Bete (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1968), 345 n. 25. The anthropologist who wrote the major source on Dida culture (s) includes a similar statement on the lack of art in that Kru-speaking region, claiming that he encountered neither masks nor statues, and that the first colonial administrators in the re gion also failed to mention them. Emmanuel Terray, "L'organisation sociale des Dida de Cote d'lvoire," Annales de IVniversite dAbidjan, ser. F, 1, no. 2 (1969): 43. 19. Holas, L'image du monde BUe, 135-36. However, in all subsequent de scriptions of this piece and others in later publications, he claimed that Bete statues refer to primordial ancestors. These assertions seem to have been based on his unfounded belief that all sculpture from Cote d'lvoire was used in the veneration of ancestors. The caption to his photograph of the figure (Fig. 10) reads as follows: "Ritual repre sentation of a deceased [female] ancestor, sculpted in wood and dressed in a multicolored strip of cloth. The Bete refer to such votive figurines by the terms yousrokpo, isrokpo, and kouei. This old piece, 70 centimeters high, was found in the area of Ouragahio [Representation rituelle d'une aieule defunte, sculptee en bois et vetue d'une bande de tissue multicolore. Les Bete designent de telles figurines votives par les termes yous rokpo, isrokpo ou kouei. Cette pi&amp;ce ancienne, haute de 70 centimetres, a ete trouvee dans les environs de Ouragahio]" (67, pi. III). 20. The date "1964" is given by Monni Adams in an entry in Africa, the Art of a Continent (Munich: Prestel, 1996), 446, cat. no. 5.108, but she does not cite the 1964 publication in her references. See her catalog entry on a second Bete figure (466, cat. no. 5.131) for her well founded assertion that "for lack of research, we do not know how much variation in carving styles occurred within the Bete region." I first heard Susan Vogel refer to the "wisdom of the marketplace" in a conversation of 1979. 21. Important primary sources include publications by an ethnologist who was raised in Lagoon (Abure) communities (Georges Niangoran Bouah, La division du temps et le calendrier rituel des peuples lagunaires de Cote d'lvoire, Travaux et Memoires de l'lnstitut d'Ethnologie de l'Universite de Paris 68 [Paris: Institut d'Ethnologie, 1964]) and a mimeographed report produced by a graduate student who docu mented a statue in his Lagoon (Kyaman) hometown (Lucien Ehouo, Theme: La religion tchaman; Sujet: Recherche graphique a partir de la statu ette de fecondite Tanombie du village d'Agbo-Go-Doumin (Abobo-Doume), Me moire de Fin de Cycle [Abidjan: Institut National des Arts/ENSBA, 1986].

Accession records of the National Museum in Abidjan indicate that some of the most impressive Lagoon works in the collection were donated after World War II by expatriates who were running lumber mills or plantations. Unfortunately, they do not indicate how, when, or why those donors obtained the works of art from local owners and/or artists. 35. Visona, Constructing African Art Histories, 14-17. 36.

In discussing Picasso's reaction to a type of mask produced by a Kru speaking group, Rubin states that "the artists who invented the Grebo style .. . [still had to face] the problem of plastic solutions—even though they had no concept for what such words mean." Rubin, "Modernist Primitivism," 19. One of Rubin's flawed assumptions in this statement is unpacked in an astute comment by Mariet Wester mann: "specification of a visual aspect [as the primary form of evalua tion for an artwork] may be its most Eurocentric component. ... cul turally conditional recognition of 'beauty' is only one of numerous possible aesthetic responses." Westermann, "Introduction: The Ob jects of Art History and Anthropology," in Anthropologies of Art (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005), xii. 44. The statue appears at the center of Stieglitz's photograph of the exhi bition. For an illustration of the photograph and Brancusi's contacts with Guillaume, see Sidney Geist, "Brancusi," in Rubin, Primitivism in 20th Century Art, 344-67. However, the assumption that Brancusi was thinking of the Fisk Figure when he sculpted his wooden statue is en tirely mine. 45. See Laurence Madeline, "Picasso, Impressions of Africa," in Picasso and Africa, ed. Madeline and Marilyn Martin (Cape Town: Bell Rob erts, 2006), 27, who adds, in a wild conflation of early twentieth- and early twenty-first-century ethnocentrism, "The mouths and the genita lia incorporate the same idea of the danger of female sexuality which haunted Picasso as well as those African peoples who practice female circumcision." 46. The psychological, social, and cultural backgrounds that European artists brought to their experience of African art have been discussed in great detail by art historians examining primitivism. For example, a fascinating account of Picasso's attitudes toward women and Africans, responses drawing on his Spanish upbringing, is provided by Natasha Staller, A Sum of Destructions: Picasso's Cultures &amp; the Creation of Cubism (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001). She illustrates an impressive series of drawings and paintings by Picasso from 1907-9 that are varia tions on the theme of a female figure with upraised elbows. Some of the same works by Picasso are illustrated by Madeline and Martin, Pi casso and Africa, pis. 14-21, 24, 25, 29, 30. A postcard published in 1906 by Edmond Fortier, now in the Picasso Archives in Paris, fea tures a photograph he took in which he placed a beautiful Malinke woman from the French colonial territories of West Africa in this arti ficial posture for European delectation. It is reproduced by Peter Ste pan, Picasso's Collection of African and Oceanic Art: Masters of Metamorpho sis (Munich: Prestel, 2006), 31. 47. Christa Clarke reveals that the text of his only substantial publication, Paul Guillaume and Thomas Munro, Primitive Negro Sculpture (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1926), was actually authored by Munro: Clarke, "Defining African Art: Primitive Negro Sculpture and the Aesthetic Phi losophy of Albert Barnes," African Arts 36, no. 1 (2003): 40-51, 92. However, Guillaume did produce several short pieces, including the comments in his first catalog: Guillaume and Guillaume Apollinaire, Sculptures ntgres (Paris, 1917; reprint, New York: Hacker Art Books, 1973). 48.

This description of European modernism's response to African art was coined by Sylvester Okwundo Ogbechie, Ben Enwonwu: The Mak ing of an African Modernist (Rochester, N.Y.: University of Rochester Press, 2008), 7. 50. Knowledgeable collectors search for African art displayed on wooden bases made by Inagaki, who worked for artists and dealers such as Jo seph Brummer and Charles Ratton until the 1930s. An Inagaki stand validates the age (and hence the authenticity) of the statue it sup ports. Susan Vogel reports that some of these bases are "fakes," imita tions intended to fool collectors.

In a letter of January 1916, Guillaume wrote that he was enclosing a "garantie d'authenticite" for three African works he sold to de Zayas. I am grateful for the assistance of Kristen Leipert, assistant archivist in the Frances Mulhall Achilles Library of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, for access to the Francis M. Naumann Re search Collection and its copies of the archival material in Seville, Spain, that is owned by Rodrigo de Zayas. 55. Guillaume's early career as a dealer in African art has been investi gated by Paudrat, "From Africa," 125-75; and his influence is noted by Maureen Murphy, De Vimaginaire au musee: Les arts d'Afrique a Paris et a New York (1931-2006) (Paris: Presses du Reel, 2009), 138-41; the most complete analysis is by Biro, Transformation de I'objet ethnographique africain. 56. Brummer seems to have facilitated a 1911 exhibition in Budapest that included African art, and he supported the publication of one of the first books written on African art, Carl Einstein's Negerplastik of 1915. After he moved to New York City, his gallery became an important feature of the American art market. For example, in 1923 he sup ported Stewart Culin's plans for a display of African art at the Brook lyn Museum, New York (Brooklyn Museum archives, April 2, 1923, item no. 110, http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection /archives/image/4239). For Brummer's career in Paris, see Paudrat, "From Africa," 143-51; for his role in disseminating African art, see Biro, Transformation de I'objet ethnographique africain, chap. 2. 57. For example, in addition to consulting the dozens of volumes pub lished by Maurice Delafosse by the first decade of the twentieth cen tury, Guillaume could have gleaned information on the arts of the Ivory Coast by skimming through Francois-Joseph Clozel and Roger Villamur, Les coutumes indigenes de la Cdte d'lvoire (Paris: A. Challamel, 1902). 58. Paudrat, "From Africa," 157. 59.

In a letter to Stieglitz, de Zayas announced that he was shipping fif teen African artworks from Guillaume's collection to New York for the exhibition, but this figure may not have been correct; de Zayas, How, When and Why Modern Art Came to New York, 185. Paudrat, "From Africa," 153, believes that there were eighteen objects in the exhibi tion. 66. Helen M.

The ob jects visible in this photograph are the Fang reliquary figure, four masks from Kru-speaking areas (Shannon identifies them as either We or Bete), two spoons (which Shannon lists as Guro or Bete), a Baule mask, a Baule male figure, and a comb that may be Baule or Lagoon.</page><page sequence="29">THE AMERICAN LIFE OF A STATUE FROM COTE D'lVOIRE \&lt;£j Shannon then notes that a drawing in the New York World Magazine, January 24, 1915, 20, illustrates two additional figures, one of which she identifies as a female Baule statue. The other, a slender female figure holding a stool on her head, was probably cut from the top of a Lagoon staff or spear. The drawing is reproduced in Flam and Deutch, Primitivism and Twentieth-Century Art, 71, no. 15; and by Gail Levin, "American Art," in Rubin, Primitivism in 20th Century Art, 463. 68. Sarah Greenough, who also visited the de Zayas archive, reports that there are ten photographs of the African artworks that were exhibited in 1914; eight are by Stieglitz, one is signed by de Zayas, and one is by an unknown photographer, possibly Charles Sheeler. See Gree nough, "Gallery 291, 1905-1917; Alfred Stieglitz, Rebellious Midwife to a Thousand Ideas," in Modern Art and America, 488 n. 112. 69. Biro, Transformation de I'objet ethnographique africain, 221. Although I have been unable to view the illustrations in this dissertation, I as sume that one of figures Biro identifies as Lagoon is the Fisk Figure. This would explain why Biro, Shannon, and Naumann all claim that the Fisk Figure was included in the 1914 exhibition. For Naumann's list of the works in the exhibition, see de Zayas, How, When and Why Modern Art Came to New York, 249. 70. Rubin, "Modernist Primitivism," 21, claims that most African art that appeared in Europe in the early twentieth century had been made specifically for foreign clients, but this judgment seems to be based on his personal notions of aesthetic quality rather than on any spe cific information about collection practices. 71. De Zayas, How, When and Why Modern Art Came to New York, 65. 72.

Paudrat, "From Africa," 160. 74. Guillaume, quoted and translated in Flam and Deutch, Primitivism and Twentieth-Century Art, 154. Guillaume's successors, Charles Ratton and Pierre Matisse, followed the lead of Guillaume and Brummer in act ing as conduits for African art displayed and purchased in the United States. Today, the elite envisioned by Guillaume is firmly entrenched in Paris and Brussels, and (with some notable exceptions) its experts have gained their authority through knowledge of African art in Euro pean collections rather than from any experience of African art in its original context.

Ibid., 153; de Zayas, in a 1911 letter to Stieglitz (de Zayas, How, When and Why Modern Art Came to New York, 164), reminds him that Steichen had advocated a show of African art. Steichen's long-stand ing interest explains why he was eager to redo the installation space. 78.

Five of the works owned by Stieglitz are now at Fisk University: the Fisk Figure; a reliquary guardian from Gabon that appears in Stieg litz's 1916 photograph of the 291 Gallery; the Baule mask from the 1914 exhibition that appears in Georgia O'Keeffe's 1923 painting Mask with Golden Apple; the mask in a Baule or Yaure style that ap pears in Stieglitz's 1922 portrait of Claudia O'Keeffe; and an unusual whip with an ornamented handle. At least four additional works pur chased by Stieglitz from Guillaume or de Zayas (the two spoons and a mask in a We or Bete style that were in the 1914 exhibition and a mask that is Guro or Baule in style) were kept by Georgia O'Keeffe. See Greenough, Modern Art and America, 50. 85. The photograph is reproduced both by Greenough, Modern Art and America, fig. 156; and Wendy Grossman, Man Ray, African Art and the Modernist Lens (Washington, D.C.: International Art and Artists, 2009). Greenough, 488 n. 112, reports that there are two prints of this pho tograph. The spoon itself is illustrated by Shannon, "African Art, 1914," on 175 as pi. 45; as mentioned in n. 84 above, it was in O'Keeffe's personal collection at the time of her death. 86. This is one of the two masks in the Alfred Stieglitz Collection of Fisk University; Shannon, "African Art, 1914," 177, believes that it may have been exhibited with the Fisk Figure in 1914. 87. The photograph is reproduced and discussed by Grossman, Man Ray, African Art and the Modernist Lens, 19. There are also two prints of the photograph, and both are in the Alfred Stieglitz Collection of the Na tional Gallery of Art; see Greenough, Modern Art and America, 488 n. 112. 88.

Grossman comments on this article's assess ment of Sheeler in Man Ray, African Art, and the Modernist Lens. I was able to consult copy no. 5 of Sheeler's portfolio in the Goldwater Li brary of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and it does not include the portrait of the Fisk Figure. 89.

Grossman, "Photography at the Crossroads," 327, traces the artworks in two of the other illustrations to the American Museum of Natural History in New York and fifteen to the Trocadero in Paris; evidently, all of the Paris photographs were taken by Marius de Zayas's brother during the summer of 1914. 91.

"C'est ainsi que le genie artistique, egalement etranger aux trois grands types, n'a surgi qu'a la suite de l'hymen des blancs avec les negres. .."Mais, quand la race ariane est pure de tout melange avec le sang des noirs, pas de conception artistique pour elle." A para phrase of de Gobineau's writings appears in an essay by Robert Drey fus, an early critic of the count's work, in response to the question, "Will Arts from Remote Places Be Admitted into the Louvre?" pub lished by Felix Feneon in Bulletin de la Vie Artistique 1 (November 15, December 1, 15, 1920): "we should not look to the organizing and intelligent faculties of our nature for the cause of creativity . . . the source from which the arts have sprung is foreign to the civilization instincts. It is hidden in the blood of the Blacks... on the other hand, the absence of intellectual aptitudes render him completely unsuitable for artistic cultivation. ... To bring out his talents, he needs to ally him self with a race that is differently endowed. . . . Artistic genius . . . ap peared only as a consequence of the fusion of the Whites and the Blacks." The emphasis (by Dreyfus?) appears in the translation repro duced in Flam and Deutch, Primitivism and Twentieth-Century Art, 156— 57. 98.

I was too astonished to speak.

The accession date of this statue was documented by a photograph in the Phototheque of the Musee de l'Homme, Paris, which I was able to photocopy in 1981. A statue by the same artist, first published in a 1925 catalog, was in the Kjersmeier collection in Denmark; see the entry on "Female figure ('Alangoua')," in Grossman, Man Ray, African Art and the Modernist Lens, no. 16. 135. Security was apparently quite lax at the Musee du Trocadero until the end of World War I, and this statue was one of many African pieces that disappeared. See Rubin, "Picasso," 335, which corresponds to comments I heard from curators and art dealers in 1981. The statue surfaced briefly in a Los Angeles art gallery in 1980, but its current location is unknown.

Their reports were quickly shared on numerous blogs. According to these reports, the painting displayed was The Three Marys, painted by the devoutly Christian artist during his long exile in Paris in a style that reflects both his training under Thomas Eakins and the luminous Impressionism of nineteenth-century France. Ironically, given the at torney's argument, the models for the women in the painting were all, of course, Europeans. It also is surprising that the attorney, who is European American, would consider himself qualified to speak for the African American community of Nashville. 165.

The phrase and the challenge come from W.J. T. Mitchell, "What Do Pictures 'Really' Want?" October, no. 77 (Summer 1996): 71-82. Mitch ell did not, of course, suggest that the Fisk Figure be interrogated; the interpretation and application of the ideas he presents in the article are entirely my own. 168. I thank Richard Powell for suggesting I consult Mitchell's article. As an Africanist, I had assumed that its interrogation of "pictures" would limit its relevance to art forms that were not European paintings. I am still puzzled by the tendency of scholars such as Mitchell to assume that "pictures"—rather than "statues"—are at the heart of the human experience with art. 169.
