ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA AWARD FOR DISTINGUISHED ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT GEORGE FLETCHER BASS George Fletcher Bass entered archaeology wary of gold. His students are taught that it is the last material one wants to find because it is rarely informative and inevitably distracts from one's seriousness of purpose. Let us try to convince him otherwise. After receiving his Master's in Near Eastern Archaeology from the Johns Hopkins University, George Bass gained practical experience, while studying at the American School of Classical Studies, at the sites of Lerna and Gordion before he entered the Ph.D. program in Classical archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania. Within months his beloved mentor, Rodney S. Young, invited him to direct the excavation of a Late Bronze Age shipwreck off Cape Gelidonya in southwestern Turkey. It was a match of student to subject that would greatly benefit the course of archaeology, and Bass's prompt publication of that excavation has challenged scholars for a score of years. Since 1960 George Bass, complemented by his versatile wife, Ann Singletary, has rarely paused to catch his breath in a career of astonishing diversity. His excavations thus far range from Neolithic Italy to the American Revolutionary War. The sites are linked by his impartiality to what the material tells him, his quest for the histori- cal context of each site, and the exacting standards he sets for their timely publication. The 15-year association of George Bass with the University of Pennsylvania and its University Museum was fruitful for each. From his student assistantship through his tenure as Associate Professor he directed three major excavations. After Gelidonya came a ship of the seventh century A.C., whose hull was the first piece of ancient maritime architecture to be studied seriously and whose contents yielded a fascinating reconstruction of a Byzantine trading venture. That was followed by the excavation of a Roman ship of the fourth century A.C. The imagination of the Bronze Age specialist was captivated by the enormity of cultural information on ocean floors. It was clear to Bass that shipwrecked artifacts generally lay in greater abundance, better preserved, and in more precisely datable contexts that those found on land. He set out then to develop techniques that would make excavation under water routinely possible, safe, and as accurate as that on land. George Bass also envisaged an environment where established scholars and young graduate students of the widest possible cultural interests could be matched with submerged sites important to their spheres of study. From this vision grew the Institute of Nautical Archaeology (I.N.A.) which Bass founded in 1973 and directed as Pres- ident through its first 10 years. During that time I.N.A. established a symbiotic relationship with Texas A&amp;M University which has led to work on five continents with projects as diverse as an 11th-century shipwreck carrying a staggering array of Islamic glass and a submerged 17th-century tavern in an English colonial town. For his dedication to teaching, George Bass received his university's highest honor, being named Distinguished Professor of Anthropology in 1980, followed four years later by its Faculty Distinguished Achievement Award in Research. He has published that research in generous measure. Of the more than 100 titles already in his biblio- graphy, Bass has directed about half to his colleagues in archaeology and the other half to making discoveries American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987)</page><page sequence="2">268 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 available to lay readers. The energy he has expended in lecturing on current excavations, on technical developments and, in recent years, in pressing for legislation to preserve submerged cultural resources in U.S. waters is impossible to quantify. But the value of gold is quantified daily. Can we persuade Bass of its worth? Gold coins of Heraclius were the first clues he had to date the Byzantine ship whose sinking he was later able to pinpoint within one year. The Gold Trident for Science, awarded by an International Congress, was his very first professional honor, and the National Geographic Society awarded him its Gold Medal in 1979. Now a queen's ransom in gold objects is being found on his current excavation, a Bronze Age ship sunk off Kay, less than 50 miles west of Cape Gelidonya. The wealth of material found in this wreck reflects the rich cultural exchange that existed from the Syro-Palestinian coast across to Cyprus and Greece that was first heralded by the excavation at Gelidonya. Even George Bass must admit that gold can be precious to an archaeologist. This medal draws attention to the daring and excellence of his accomplishments. The Archaeological Institute of America, with gratitude to him for the opening of the remarkable realm of archaeology beneath the sea, awards its Gold Medal for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement to George Fletcher Bass. POMERANCE AWARD OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA FOR SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO ARCHAEOLOGY ELIZABETH K. RALPH Dr. Elizabeth K. Ralph is an internationally recognized scholar in the fields of radiocarbon dating and sub- surface archaeological exploration. As an Associate in the Department of Physics and Associate Director of the Museum Applied Science Center for Archaeology (MASCA), both at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Ralph has continued the pioneering efforts of Willard F. Libby in radiocarbon dating. The development of the "new" (5730) half-life led, more recently, to the "calibration" of C-14 measurements with the help of dendrochronology. Dr. Ralph has been a leader in these developments, being among the first to recognize the need for a correction factor in achieving a "reality" in radiocarbon dating. Under her direction, MASCA's C-14 laboratory has acquired an international reputation for excellence by processing hundreds of measurements from all over the world while constantly evaluating such methodological issues as inter-laboratory calibration and the "radiocarbon calendar." Dr. Ralph's contributions to archaeological research have gone well beyond the evaluation and refinement of the radiocarbon method, as her many publications attest. Under her direction, MASCA has played a role of leadership in the development of thermoluminescent dating, tree-ring dating, and several other chronometric techniques. At the same time, she and her colleagues have been pioneers in "archaeological prospecting" by means of geophysical techniques such as magnetometer surveying. During the 1960s and 1970s Dr. Ralph supervised the testing of in- strumentation for sub-surface archaeological exploration, which has taken her to countless sites. She ran field tests of instruments for archaeological exploration and searched for the buried city of Sybaris, Italy. Other archaeologi- cal field surveys with instruments for underground explorations include many sites from eastern Canada to Mexico in the Americas, from England to Yugoslavia in Europe, and Turkey to Egypt in the Near East. Dr. Ralph, a Wellesley graduate in chemistry, earned her advanced degrees in physics and geology at the Univer- sity of Pennsylvania and began her career in industry before she returned to academic life at the C-14 laboratory at its inception. Those who have worked with Elizabeth K. Ralph in the field, or who have benefited from her laboratory's analyses of samples, regard Dr. Ralph with the highest esteem. She is a scientist of the loftiest standards, and a human being of great patience, fairness, and good humor. With great pride and gratitude for her many contribu- tions to the growth and development of archaeology as an interdisciplinary science, we honor her today with the Pomerance Award of the Archaeological Institute of America for Scientific Contributions to Archaeology.</page><page sequence="3">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 269 ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS The abstracts of the papers appear in the order of presentation and are followed by an alphabetical index of authors. SESSION I: PLENARY AND OPENING SESSION THE BURIAL BUILDING AT LEFKANDI: EVIDENCE FOR EUBOEAN LEADERSHIP AND OVERSEAS ENTERPRISE DURING THE "DARK AGE": L.H. Sackett, British School of Archaeology at Athens In 1981 a remarkable building of the 10th century B.C. was discovered on a leveled platform of rock on the summit of Toumba Hill at Lefkandi. Excavation in 1981 and succes- sive years was directed by E. Touloupa followed by P. Kalli- gas for the Greek Archaeological Service and by M.R. Pop- ham for the British School at Athens. Constructed of mud- brick on a substantial stone socle, the building measured 48 m. long by 14 m. wide, if we include two columned side ve- randas, each 2 m. wide. The plan is of great interest as a possible forerunner to Greek peripteral buidings. The roof was of reed-thatch and was supported centrally by a row of wooden poles. There were three main internal compart- ments to the building, all interconnected. The west sector with an apsidal end appears to have been built for storage purposes. The east sector was a large rectangular antecham- ber approached through a wide doorway at the east front and leading to the main central sector. Here a large double shaft grave was found containing in the southern cutting the cre- mated remains of a warrior in a decorated bronze urn, placed beside the inhumed body of a woman, decked in gold; in the northern cutting were the bodies of four horses. There is no evidence for any length of occupation preceding the burial in the building or the neighborhood, where five other cemeteries are known. Indeed, the building may not have been finished when it was demolished, filled in, and buried under a great tumulus, partly constructed of multicolored mud-bricks. Thereafter, successive burials were made radi- ating around the east end of the building on either side of an approach road. Some 64 tombs, principally shaft graves, and 22 pyres were excavated between 1969 and 1986 and found to contain a series of offerings, including the well-known Lefkandi Centaur. The finds demonstrate the early wealth and overseas connections of the successors to the king or hero buried on the summit. Burial customs and imports show close connections with Attica, but there were also wider con- tacts, with Cyprus, the Levant, and Egypt in the east, and with Thessaly and Macedonia in the north. It seems reason- able to suppose that the Euboeans themselves took part in these early sea ventures, as they certainly did later both at Al Mina in North Syria and at Pithecoussa in the west. SESSION II A: THE HELLENISTIC WORLD HARPALOS, AGIS III, AND GRAIN FROM CYRENE: B.M. Kingsley, University of California, Santa Cruz An inscription found at Cyrene in 1922 (SEG IX 2+) records 51 shipments of grain to 41 Greek cities, a total of 805,000 medimni. The deliveries have been dated ca. 330-325 B.C. and ascribed to subsidies arranged by Alex- ander himself in Libya in 332/331. After Athens' 100,000 medimni, his mother Olympias received the second greatest quantity, 72,600 medimni. His sister Cleopatra and the cities of Argos, Corinth, and Larissa follow, each receiving 50,000, then Megara, Sicyon, and Rhodes with 30,000. The geographical pattern formed by the recipient cities suggests that strategy more than compassion guided the king and that the shipments supplemented his military response, first, to the Persian threat in 333 to invade Euboea and Macedonia and, thereafter, to the persistence after Issos of Agis III in his preparations for revolt. Alexander's treasurer Harpalos lived in the Megarid ca. 333-331, a most likely time for his gift of grain to the Athenians, the honors as a benefactor he received from them, and the formation of friendship with Phokion and Charikles. Of the Peloponne- sian cities to receive grain, only one, Elis, joined Agis' up- rising in 331. Athens' failure to support Agis was a major factor in his defeat. This had already been insured before 331 when Harpalos' reunion with the army at Tyre coin- cided with the arrival of the Paralos, bearing Athenians with a crown for Alexander. Antipater's route southward to de- feat Agis in 331/330 had likewise been secured in advance. E. Badian's thesis ("The First Flight of Harpalus," Historia 9 [1960] 245-46), accepting Arrian 3.6.7, is rejected; Alex- ander left less to luck than is suggested in "Agis III," Hermes 95 (1967) 170-92. ANTI-MACEDONIAN PROPOGANDA AND THE CHRONO- LOGY OF THE AETOLIAN LEAGUE'S GOLD AND SIL- VER COINAGE: Joseph B. Scholten, University of California, Berkeley The chronology of the Aetolian League's third-century B.C. gold and silver issues is problematic. Minting in gold is generally assumed to have come first, followed by two separate silver series, first on the Attic, later on the heavier Corcyraean standard. There is disagreement, though, on the precise dates of these two silver series, with one theory (F. Scheu, NC 1960, 37-52) placing the Attic tetradrachms ca. 260 and the Corcyraean standard issues ca. 221, and an- other (R. de Laix, CSCA 6 [1973] 47-75) placing them ca. 220 and 215, respectively. This notion of Attic before Cor- cyraean issues needs to be reconsidered, however, particu- larly because of its implications for the League's propagan- da program. The reverses of the Aetolian gold issues, silver tetra- drachms, and Corcyraean standard silver drachms all bear the figure of the goddess "Aetolia" seated atop a pile of Gal- lic shields, an allusion to the League's victory over the Gallic invasion of Greece in 279/278. Most of the tetradrachms,</page><page sequence="4">270 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 and perhaps some of the gold issues, however, also display a Macedonian shield within this stack, a clear reference to conflict between that kingdom and the League. Current theories render this blatant piece of Aetolian propaganda meaningless, inserted by the League during a period of peace with the Antigonids, and subsequently removed when relations between the two states were at their worst. A rearrangement of the order of the silver series, so that the Corcyraean standard issues begin first, ca. 245, and are followed and paralleled by a limited issue of Attic tetra- drachms in the 230s, solves this problem since it introduces the anti-Macedonian element into the reverse program of the League's coinage precisely in the period when four de- cades of peace with Macedon had ended, and permanent hostility begun. In addition, this new system better fits the meager hoard evidence, as well as the internal die- and ex- ternal issue-linkages which connect the gold and silver series. Finally, the dynamics of the Aetolian coinage in pre- cious metals under this system add numismatic support to literary evidence concerning the political and economic cris- es faced by the Aetolian League in the late third and early second centuries B.C. CISTOPHORIC COUNTERMARKS AND THE BEGINNING OF THE CISTOPHORIC COINAGE: Robert A. Bauslaugh, Emory University In F.S. Kleiner and S.P. Noe's The Early Cistophoric Coinage (New York 1977), there is no discussion of the cistophoric countermarks which appear on posthumous Alexander tetradrachms of Aspendos, Perge, and Phaselis and the autonomous tetradrachms of Side. This is a surpris- ing omission, because the countermarks seem to be evidence of a transitional period when foreign coinage was being of- ficially controlled within the Pergamene economic sphere in connection with the introduction of the cistophoric coinage. Study of the countermarks (which have the same quiver de- vice as the coinage) may therefore answer such important and controversial questions as the date of introduction of the cistophoric coinage and the identification of the original mints. From a study of some 40 countermarked issues, the fol- lowing preliminary conclusions can be offered. First, given the presence of one countermark in the Propontis 1950 hoard (Inventory of Greek Coin Hoards no. 888) dated by N. Waggoner to no later than ca. 175 B.C. (RN 1979), and another overstruck by a Seleucid anchor countermark as- signed by Morkholm (ANSMN 1978, p. 72, n. 12) to the decade of 180-170, it is possible to date the period of cisto- phoric countermarking (and by extension the introduction of the cistophoric coinage) to the early 170s. Second, the dis- puted identification of one cistophoric mint (whether Pa- rium [Morkholm, ANSMN 1979] or Apamea [Kleiner, ANSMN 1980]) is settled by the existence of countermarks which employ the regular civic initials of Apamea. Finally, a new mystery is added by the discovery of a previously un- known and as yet unidentified cistophoric mint which em- ployed a countermark inscribed with the Greek letters TOP. A SHIP FOR THE GREAT GODS: EXCAVATIONS IN SAMO- THRACE, 1986: James R. McCredie, New York University Excavation in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods in Samo- thrace, resumed in 1986 by the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, for the American School of Classical Stud- ies at Athens, has shown that much of a broad terrace north of the Hellenistic Stoa and south of the Byzantine fortifica- tion, and intermediate between them in level was occupied by a building of the first half of the third century B.C. de- signed to house the dedication of a warship to the Great Gods, doubtless the prize of a significant naval victory. The building, constructed of local porous sandstone, was ca. 27.25 m. long and 12.18 m. wide on the interior, divided longitudinally into two aisles by a colonnade and grille. The southern aisle is provided with a series of foundations to support marble props for the ship. One pair of props to sup- port the central part of the hull is upright, shifted only slightly in the destruction of the building, and another, near the end of the ship, can be restored to its position. They, together with the limits of space available for it, contribute new evidence for the reconstruction of a Hellenistic war- ship. The hypothesis that the monument represents a dedi- cation by Antigonos Gonatas is considered in the light of the role of the Antigonids in the development of the Sanctuary. Other monuments of this terrace, including a 15-couch Hestiatorion also of the third century B.C., and Byzantine structures, are discussed briefly. A THESSALIAN DEDICATION AT SAMOTHRACE: Robert L. Pounder, Vassar College In the course of excavations in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace in the summer of 1986 there was dis- covered, built into the wall of a Byzantine building, a mar- ble stele 0.80 m. in height. Its upper surface preserves two dowel cuttings, one of which still contains lead, and in- scribed on its front surface is a text 11 lines in length. The inscription records a dedication to the Great Gods made by the Thessalian League through their theoroi, two from Pherai and two from Larissa. This is the first known document linking Thessaly with Samothrace. The citation of the Samothracian eponymous archon in the final two lines is of no help in dating the inscription, since a chronology based on these officials has not been established. A plausible date, however, would be soon after 146 B.C., when the Thessalian League, long a pawn in the conflicts that fol- lowed the death of Alexander, regained its autonomy under Macedonian supervision; the letter forms support such a mid-second century date. About the dedication itself one can only speculate; it may have been a sculptured relief, for which there is at least one parallel, or perhaps an elaborate crowning molding. In any case, the existence of this dedication provides important new knowledge for our understanding of the influence and pres- tige of the Samothracian mysteries. Contingents of theoroi are known to have come to Samothrace from at least 40 Ae-</page><page sequence="5">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 271 gean islands or Ionia. With the discovery of this stone, the Thessalian League joins Elis as a second example from mainland Greece. It may be that we must begin to alter our picture of state participation in the most renowned of Hel- lenistic cults. IG 112, 1534B AND THE MID-THIRD CENTURY PRIESTS OF ASKLEPIOS AT ATHENS: Sara B. Aleshire, University of California, Berkeley Since 1906 (J. Kirchner, RhM 61 [1906] 344-51; J. Sundwall, Epigraphische Beitriige [Leipzig 1906] 78; W.S. Ferguson, The Priests of Asklepios [Berkeley 1906] 138-45), scholars have assumed that the later of the two large inven- tories of the Athenian Asklepieion, IG II2, 1534B, lists the dedications of 24 consecutive priesthoods (or exactly two tribal cycles) and that the priests listed there can thus be as- signed to specific dates in the years preceding the archonship of Diomedon. Since 1934 (W.S. Ferguson, AJP 50 [1934] 330), scholars have also assumed that these two priestly cy- cles began with the archonship of Peithidemos and that the priest of that archonship must have come from Antigonis (Tribe I). This position has recently been restated without argument by Habicht (Hypomnemata 73 [Gdttingen 1982] 64-78) and Lewis (ZPE 58 [1985] 271-74). Restudy of this and other Athenian inventories indicates that this interpretation of IG II2, 1534B is untenable for the following reasons: 1) The name beginning FE[---] in IG II2, 1534B, line 145, should be that of a priest rather than the archon Peithidemos. 2) The decree in lines 141-62 does not order an exetasmos of the Asklepieion from the priest- hood of Pe[---]. 3) The presence or absence of Antigonid tetradrachms or dedications by the Athenian demos cannot be used as an indication of the political climate at Athens in an individual priesthood. 4) The assumption that invento- ries of the Asklepieion were conducted in the initial or final years of either the priestly or the secretary cycles is entirely unjustified. The discovery that the priest of IG II2, 1534B cannot be assigned to specific dates has important, if negative, implica- tions for the chronology of mid-third-century Athens: The archonships of neither Peithidemos nor Diomedon need be placed with reference to the priestly cycle, and the demotic of the unknown priest from Xypete cannot be used to date the archon Lysiades. More positively, we can say that the priest of the archonship of Diomedon was concerned with cleaning and refurbishing the Asklepieion and set about persuading the Athenian boule and demos to help him in that task. IG II2, 1534B partially preserves the result. THE GREEKS IN CENTRAL DALMATIA. SOME NEW EVIDENCE FROM THE YUGOSLAV EXCAVATIONS AND FIELD SURVEY: Branko Kirigin, Archaeological Museum, Split The results of excavations of Greek cemeteries on the island of Vis (Issa) and of a systematic archaeological survey of the island of Hvar (Pharos) in the last decade are dis- cussed. The Martvilo cemetery at Vis has yielded 40 tombs of the Hellenistic period, each containing the same types of vessels. Most of the graves prior to ca. 200 B.C. have pro- duced offerings imported from the Italian peninsula, Sicily, and Greece, attesting to widespread trade. After the end of the third century B.C., on the other hand, mostly local fine ware was deposited inside the graves. Heaps of crushed sea shells and fragmented kitchen pottery found next to some tombs are evidence of burial rites that may have been de- rived from native custom. Another cemetery adjacent to the eastern side of the ancient city included 249 tombs, ranging in date from the mid-fourth century B.C. to late antiquity, 98 of which belong to the Hellenistic period and share af- finities with those excavated at Martvilo. Although the city of Issa occupies an area of ca. 10 ha. and represents the larg- est Greek site known in Dalmatia, only its cemeteries have been investigated. No traces of a system of land division have hitherto been detected in the fertile areas of the island of Vis, whereas an extensive survey (based on ground reconnais- sance and aerial photography) of the plain to the east of Starigrad (ancient Pharos), on the island of Hvar, has made it possible to locate a Greek cadastral grid. Its basic unit is a 5 x 1 stadia lot of 180 plethra (ca. 900 x 180 m.), possibly with further subdivisions. The city itself, whose walls are not aligned with the layout of the land division, occupied portions of two such lots. Several farmsteads, mainly of Ro- man date, have been discovered in the countryside. THE ARTEMIS TEMPLE AT SARDIS AND THE END OF THE LATE HELLENISTIC TRADITION OF TEMPLE DE- SIGN: Thomas Howe, Southwestern University Two features remain controversial about the building history of the Artemision of Sardis: the date of the subdivi- sion of the cella; and the dates of the design and execution of the pseudodipteral colonnade and the porches. Hanfmann (SardisRep I [1975] 74-87) argues that the cella was divided ca. 213 B.C. Gruben (AM 76 [1961] 155-96) argues that it dates to after Sardis' second neocorate in A.D. 139. All theories consider the pseudodipteral colonnade to be initi- ally Hellenistic. It is here argued that the pseudodipteral colonnade, porches, and cella subdivision all belong to a single coherent project begun after A.D. 139. The evidence adduced is the spatial character of the external colonnade, the technique of doweling and the use of mortared rubble in both the colon- nade and the cella division, the metrology of the colonnade, the parallels of details of the plan to Roman, not Hellenistic, pseudodipteroi, and the coherence and highly metaphorical character of the design when the colonnade and the cella division are taken together. Because of the dramatic elements introduced into the co- lonnade and the cella, this project of A.D. 139 seems to mark the end of the conservative late Hellenistic tradition of regu- lar, modular temple design. It is also tentatively proposed that the impetus to begin a colossal temple at Sardis in the early third century B.C. sprang from the desire of the Sar-</page><page sequence="6">272 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 dians to separate the cult from that at Ephesos in order to promote Artemis of Sardis as the national deity of Seleucid Asia Minor. THE HELLENISTIC SILVER COINAGE OF PAROS: Gary Reger, University of Wisconsin-Madison In the absence of a die study, the accepted dates for Pari- an coins have depended on stylistic criteria; hoard evidence has never been applied. This paper presents a die study and combines the results with the hoards, the epigraphy of Pa- ros, and style to date the coins. Their date coincides with a dark epoch in the history of the island, which the coins can help to illuminate. Dates estimated on style fluctuate over 150-200 years and often insert a long gap between the didrachms and tetra- drachms. In fact the magistrates on the tetradrachms and didrachms form two seamless series of only three years (Lambrinudakis and Wirrle, Chiron 13 [1983] 289-91; BMC Crete and Aeg. 114-115). The three hoards with Parian coins, dated by the so- called "tyrant didrachms" from Karystos, support a date for Paros' coins of about 225-210 B.C. A new Parian inscrip- tion of 200-190 B.C. mentions a Silenos, otherwise known only from the tetradrachms, as the father of an important official. Silenos was therefore active in the 220s or 210s. Polybius (4.3.2-3) notes the waning of Macedonian in- fluence after 221 B.C.; some years later Philip V garrisoned Paros (Livy 31.15.8; IG XII, 5, line 125). The coins, which coincide with this period when Paros briefly owed no alle- giance to outsiders, were perhaps issued as an advertisement of Parian independence and wealth. SESSION II B: CONTEXT POTTERY CERAMIC CHRONOLOGY AND CONTEXT: THE INTER- PRETATION OF POTTERY DEPOSITS FROM MEDI- AEVAL NUBIAN SITES: William Y. Adams, Univer- sity of Kentucky This paper is based on the excavation of more than 100 Mediaeval Nubian archaeological sites, including pottery workshops, pottery caches, houses, refuse deposits, religious buildings, and graves. Pottery collections from these differ- ent kinds of sites are not uniform in their composition, sug- gesting that pottery has a somewhat different story to tell in different archaeological contexts. This is true both in a func- tional and in a chronological sense. Although pottery is use- ful in all cases for dating, the dating of archaeological de- posits on the basis of their ceramic content is not always a simple and straightforward matter. It requires some consi- deration of how the pottery came to be included in the de- posits where it was found, and also how the deposits them- selves came to be located where they were found. It is sug- gested in conclusion that the interpretation of pottery in re- lation to its context involves a continual information feed- back, in which the pottery helps us to understand the con- texts while at the same time the contexts help us to under- stand the pottery. QUANTIFICATION, INTRA-DEPOSIT VARIATION, AND ASSEMBLAGE COMPARISON: R.S. Tomber, The Uni- versity, Southampton The collection of quantified ceramic data has become standard practice among pottery specialists, providing an important starting point for comparative analysis both with- in and between sites. Since little is known about intra-de- posit variation, however, it is problematic to generalize and make comparisons. This paper attempts first to test the de- gree of internal variability present within a large pottery as- semblage and, second, to isolate and define the parameters of variability. The data used in this study are from the 1983 excavations at the Carthage circus. One deposit was considered especial- ly suitable for examining variation: a dump containing ca. 625 kg. of pottery dug in 88 stratigraphic contexts. The pot- tery itself is primarily late fourth-early fifth century A.C., although coin evidence places its deposition in at least the late fifth century A.C. Before trying to determine the amount of variability that might be found between the different stratigraphic layers, it was necessary to test the assumption that the deposit was similar in general nature throughout. Principal components analysis provided a means to compare the total assemblage of all contexts with each other and demonstrated a high de- gree of correlation between them. Relative quantities of pottery types were then calculated for each layer, resulting in a somewhat disparate range of percentiles for individual types and indicating a high degree of internal variability. Some differences could be attributed to sample size but others could not be readily explained. This suggested that relative percentages were not necessari- ly a good measure for comparison. Other channels for assessing intra-deposit variation in- cluded cluster analysis to define the main sources of varia- tion, and experimentation with sample size to determine the level at which variability might decrease. With this under- standing of variability it may then be possible to investigate descriptive statistics which might reflect assemblage compo- sition better than percentiles, thereby refining comparison between assemblages. In summary, this study addresses the complex issue of intra-deposit variability, and how variability can be isolated and defined. On the basis of this, it is then possible to con- sider appropriate measures for inter-site comparison. POTTERY AND CONTEXT AT HALIEIS: Wolf W. Ru- dolph, Indiana University The excavations of the Lower Town of Halieis provided an opportunity to develop a model for the study of pottery in a domestic context. The primary goal was to be able to ana- lyze pottery under various aspects-vertically over time,</page><page sequence="7">19871 THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 273 horizontally within spatially defined areas (houses, rooms, etc.). Other questions concern, for example, differentiation of quality and function between areas, evidence of discard pattern and study of type-seriation. In the Halieis-system of recording and analysis the cera- mic assemblage is placed within the framework of all other finds, including floral and faunal remains. Phasing estab- lishes the historical strata to which the pottery of a given level belongs. All pottery found is recorded and classified first per excavated unit and subsequently related to a larger architectural feature where applicable. At the first level of ceramic analysis, the finds are separat- ed into two groups: identified and unidentified; at the second level, both groups are broken down into four categories: Fine Ware, Plain/Coarse Ware, Pithos Ware, Cooking Ware. The third level involves subdividing each ware into open and closed vessels. An additional "undefined" label is used to account for those fragments which defy placement within the "unidentified" portion of the assemblage. The statistics of the "unidentified" ceramics are used in the final assessment of the actual amount of pottery in a given unit at a particular time. Definition of the identified pottery is fur- ther refined. Thus, on the fourth level, use-function becomes a decisive factor in establishing logical groups for analysis. Fine Ware, for example, contains vessels for drinking, eat- ing, serving/storage, and so forth. Plain/Coarse Ware, Pithos Ware, and Cooking Ware are similarly defined. The fifth level categorizes the specific shapes. Form always su- persedes ornamentation. The latter is assigned to the lowest, sixth, level. This system, which is based upon three-dimensional re- cording in the trench, provides a productive basis for a step- by-step analysis of the ceramics in their original context. Analysis of the spatial distribution contributes to the more accurate interpretation of room functions: the examination of the frequency of individual shapes and categories estab- lishes a useful tool in following the popularity of a given type through time. Definite results for Halieis are forthcoming. But our tests have already demonstrated that the system provides a highly versatile tool to manipulate large amounts of ceramic ma- terial in a domestic setting, taking into account the full con- text of daily life and historic change. THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF COOKING POTTERY AT ANCIENT HALIEIS: Brad A. Ault, Indiana University One of the research goals of the Halieis excavations has been an in-depth study of all pottery recovered from this city-site in the southern Argolid (sixth-fourth centuries B.C.). Among the studies in progress of the cooking pottery is an examination of its spatial distribution throughout the excavated rooms and courtyards of private dwellings. In one such house, number seven, the distribution and frequency of cooking pottery suggest that two separate rooms were most likely associated with food preparation. As the first room includes the only domestic hearth known from the site, it was, accordingly, identified as a probable kitchen even be- fore the ceramic distributions were studied. Since the room is in part open to the courtyard, however, its use during in- clement weather would have been impractical. This diffi- culty resolved itself when it was noted that an adjacent, more enclosed, room actually contained a slightly greater quantity of cooking pottery. It is highly likely, then, that food preparation was carried out there during the unseasonable months. THE CERAMICS OF KISSONERGA-MOSPHILIA BUILD- ING 3: PROBLEMS OF ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETA- TION: Diane Bolger, University of Maryland, and E.J. Peltenburg, University of Edinburgh The Lemba Archaeological Project excavations at the Chalcolithic site of Kissonerga-Mosphilia in Cyprus (E.J. Peltenburg, Director) were reported at last year's Annual Meeting. The site is one of the largest and most deeply stra- tified sites in Cyprus. One of the most important achieve- ments of the 1985 season was the excavation of destroyed Building 3 with its mass of in situ storage vessels which oc- cupied at least half its floor space. Its sudden destruction provides distinctive insights into the activities of society and more precise information to achieve the ultimate aims of ar- chaeological endeavor. Preliminary analysis of the contextu- al value of this unique assemblage has posed problems of general interest to Eastern Mediterranean archaeology. The following problems of analysis and interpretation are con- sidered: 1) establishing vessel count from a surfeit of sherd material; 2) analysis of numerous similar vessels of friable handmade wares; 3) analysis of partial pots; 4) spatial con- gestion and difficulties of reconstruction; 5) vessel contents; and 6) societal organization. LERNA III POTTERY: CHRONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONTEXT: Martha Heath Wiencke, American School of Classical Studies at Athens Study of the pottery and stratification of Lerna III (Early Helladic II) confirms J.L. Caskey's basic stratigraphic framework for the Lerna III pottery (Phases A-D), as well as his well-known sequence of sauceboat types (I, II-III, IV; Hesperia 29 [1960] 290, fig. 1). Since the pottery corpus is fairly complete, further not- able changes can be documented. For example, in later Phase A, when the Type I sauceboat becomes common for the first time, a small but distinctive class of dark-on-light decorated ware with Cycladic affiliations appears, one that can easily be recognized as different from decorated ware in later phases. The most striking ceramic changes, however, take place between late Phase B and early Phase C. Phase C is rich in light-painted shapes, at least 10 of which are new introductions. Totally dark-painted (Urfirnis) pottery pre- dominates in Phases A and B, but partially painted ware becomes the rule in Phase C, and unpainted ware by the time of the House of the Tiles (D). The ceramic changes between Phases B and C seem to</page><page sequence="8">274 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 coexist with a new impetus in construction, represented by the earliest fortification walls and probably by the erection of Building BG, predecessor to the House of the Tiles. It should also be noted that the closely datable examples of potter's marks and roller impressions (banded pithoi and hearths), as well as the use of sealings, all belong to Phases C and D. This burst of economic and artistic activity occurs probably nearer the end than the middle of the EH II peri- od. Significant and interesting parallels may be drawn with similar architectural and ceramic developements elsewhere in southern Greece. THE SIZE OF THE EARLY MYCENAEAN CERAMIC SYS- TEM: Harriet Lewis Robinson, Oxford, Maine How many specialist potters provided a community with ceramics at a given time? This question is best answered by studying context pottery. The following equations have been developed to estimate the number of potters employed in a region: N x B = R Number of pots per household times breakage rate equals replacement factor; R(P/I) = D Re- placement factor times population divided by individuals per household equals demand for pottery; D/O = E De- mand divided by potter's output equals number of potters employed. In applying these equations to LH I Messenia, it is estimated that three wheelthrowing and 14 handbuilding potters may have been employed. Firm values for many of the variables in the equations have not been established. The estimates used for the Early Mycenaean period should be refined by studying context pottery. More accurate estimates require that the pottery from a given level at a given site be examined before any sherds are discarded. The number of vessels used in each household, the proportion of pottery in daily and occasional use, and the technology used in manufacturing each vessel type are crucial elements for study. The question explored in this paper is an aspect of an- cient economies. A study of context pottery would provide a greater understanding of specialization of labor and pottery production centers. CERAMIC TYPOLOGIES AND THE HISTORY OF AR- CHAEOLOGY IN CYPRUS: PROBLEMS OF INTERPRETA- TION FOR THE EARLY BRONZE AGE: Ellen Herscher, Washington Society The pioneering work of the Swedish Cyprus Expedition in the 1920s and early 1930s provided the comprehensive foundation for Cypriot archaeology. Its system of ceramic classification still serves as the principal basis for chrono- logical reconstructions of the Cypriot Bronze and Iron Ages. The Swedes and the Australian J.R. Stewart, who con- tributed to their final publication of interpretations, devel- oped the standard typologies for Early and Middle Bronze Age pottery primarily utilizing material excavated in ceme- teries at Vounous and Lapithos. Pottery from more limited excavations at other sites that did not conform to this stan- dard system was considered to be a minor regional variation of the norm. Most prominent among these anomalous ceramic groups is the pottery of the "Philia culture," whose relationship to the standard sequence has long been debated. Is it, as postu- lated by Stewart, a regional variation of the Early Cypriot culture, or is it, as first suggested by P. Dikaios, a chrono- logical antecedent to the Early Cypriot period represented at Vounous? Widespread but limited discoveries of the past 25 years have failed to resolve this controversy conclusively. Three seasons of excavation at the site of Sotira Kami- noudhia, sponsored by the American Schools of Oriental Research under the direction of S. Swiny, have provided sig- nificant new evidence from a "Philia culture" settlement and cemetery. Study of the securely stratified pottery shows tenuous links to the Vounous material, allowing firmer chronological interpretations and more accurate analysis of the development of Cypriot Bronze Age ceramics. It shows that to some extent both Stewart and Dikaios were right. Most significant from the theoretical standpoint is the way in which the Kaminoudhia material and that from the near- by site of Episkopi Phaneromeni contradicts the long-held views regarding what is "typical" for Early and Middle Bronze Age Cyprus. POTTERY CLASSIFICATION AND RELATIVE CHRONO- LOGY OF THE LC IIC-LC IIIA PERIODS: Barbara Barrett Kling, University of Pennsylvania The implicit definition of the relative chronological phas- es LC IIC and LC IIIA in present use in Cypriot archaeo- logy is a historical one, distinguished by destruction levels at major sites, which are generally assumed to correspond to similar events in the Aegean at the end of the LH IIIB peri- od (e.g., SwCyprusExp IV:1D, 775ff.). There exists at most of these sites a local imitation of Mycenaean pottery. Al- though some scholars have questioned the assumed LC IIC = LH IIIB/LC IIIA = LH IIIC equation (e.g., French and Astr6m, RDAC 1980, 267ff.; Schachermeyr, Die myken- ische Zeit [Vienna 1976] 283-303), others have maintained it by classifying this imitation Mycenaean pottery as "IIIB" in LC IIC contexts and "IIIC" in LC IIIA (e.g., Karageor- ghis and Demas, Pyla-Kokkinokremos [Nicosia 1984]). Sty- listic distinctions in the two principal shapes which have been used for dating, the skyphos and the shallow bowl, however, are not clearcut in either Cyprus or the Aegean, and the LC IIC = LH IIIB/LC IIIA = LH IIIC equation cannot be regarded as proven. This paper regards the defini- tion of relative chronological phases in historical terms (ob- served stratigraphically at many sites) as useful but holds that the ceramic definition of these phases ought not to rely on the classification of these problematic Mycenaean cera- mic forms but should be based on the total ceramic reper- toire, with LC IIC settlement contexts represented by a va- riety of local Cypriot wares and a small quantity of imita- tion Mycenaean ware, and LC IIIA settlements showing a dramatic increase in this ceramic material. The classifica-</page><page sequence="9">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 275 tion of the imitation Mycenaean pottery as "IIIB" or "IIIC" and the chronological correlation of the Cypriot phases vis- A-vis the Aegean are separate questions which must not be based on assumed historical associations but on a fuller as- sessment of all shapes and motifs represented. EARLY ARCHAIC GREEK POTTERY FROM TELL BATA- SHI (TIMNAH), ISRAEL: Jodi Magness, University of Pennsylvania Nine pieces of Early Archaic Greek pottery-one whole vessel and eight sherds-have been found in the excavations at Tell Batashi (Biblical Timnah), Israel, under the direc- tion of G.L. Kelm of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and A. Mazar of the Hebrew University of Jeru- salem. The pottery comes from the destruction debris of the last Iron Age stratum at Tell Batashi, dated by historical evidence to ca. 590 B.C. Of the nine pieces, only one example is of mainland ori- gin. This is a tiny (max. diam. 3.3 cm.) fragment of a Co- rinthian vessel incised with part of a wing and the upper portion of the hindquarters of an animal. The figure is al- most identical to the griffin on an Early Corinthian arybal- los of ca. 620 B.C. from Taranto (F.G. Lo Porto, Les cera- miques de la Grece de l'Est et leur diffusion en Occident [Naples 1978] pl. 64, fig. 5). Aside from its significance for the chronology of Early Archaic Corinthian pottery, this piece represents only the third recorded example of this ware from an excavated site in Israel. The other eight pieces of Early Archaic Greek pottery from Tell Batashi are of East Greek origin. The single whole vessel is a Samian amphora of micaceous red-brown ware virtually identical with a Samian amphora assigned by V. Grace to ca. 600 B.C. (Hesperia [1971] pl. 15.1). Also represented are fragments of Ionian cups, a piece of a wave- line amphora, and the double handle of an oenochoe prob- ably related to Wild Goat Ware. The corpus of Early Archaic Greek pottery from Tell Batashi is important because of its presence in a well-dated Late Iron Age level. The context in which this pottery was found confirms the accepted dates for the wares represented. In addition, the discovery of this pottery at Tell Batashi is important because of the rarity of Early Archaic Greek pot- tery at excavated sites in Israel, and it attests to the commer- cial ties of the site with the Aegean world at the end of the seventh century B.C. AMPHORAS ON AMPHORAS: THE EVIDENCE FROM CAR- THAGE: Samuel R. Wolff, Chicago Society In a recent article ("Amphoras on Amphoras," Hesperia 51 [1982] 284-92), C. Koehler presented a catalogue of the images of Corinthian amphoras on the amphoras them- selves. The subject of this paper is the representation of am- phoras on stamped amphora handles, terracotta animal figurines, and votive stelae from Carthage. The evidence is limited but it provides us with interesting comparisons to the Corinthian material. Only stamps with the image of Corin- thian amphoras, for example, are found on Corinthian am- phoras. In contrast, only non-Punic amphoras are depicted at Carthage. An image of a Greco-Italic amphora on a votive stele is the most significant piece discussed. Jars of that type (Will Form a,) are dated within about a quarter of a cen- tury (late fourth/first quarter of the third century). Thus, by dating the amphora, a secure chronological peg (at least a terminus post quem) for studying the palaeography, icono- graphy, and stratigraphy of that stele, and thousands like it, is obtained. Another article by Koehler on the lining, stoppering, and handling of Greek amphoras appeared recently ("Handling of Greek Transport Amphoras," in J.-Y. Empereur and Y. Garlan eds., Recherches sur les amphores grecques, BCH- Suppl. 13 [Paris 1986] 49-67). The Punic evidence for the same practices is presented here. It is probable that at least two of the lids from the Athenian Agora originally stoppered Punic amphoras such as those published by V. Grace ("The Canaanite Jar," in S.S. Weinberg ed., The Aegean and the Near East. Studies Presented to Hetty Goldman [New York 1956] pl. XII.1-4, 6) from the same site. SESSION II C: AMERICAN CENTER OF ORI- ENTAL RESEARCH SESSION ON JORDANI- AN ARCHAEOLOGY THE AMERICAN CENTER OF ORIENTAL RESEARCH, AMMAN, JORDAN: David McCreery, The American Center of Oriental Research This paper describes the facilities available to scholars at the American Center of Oriental Research (ACOR) in the Jordanian capital of Amman (P.O. Box 2470, Jebel Am- man, Amman, Jordan). RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES BEARING ON THE EARLY BRONZE IV PERIOD IN JORDAN: Wil- liam G. Dever, University of Arizona This paper reviews recent progress in the study of the Early Bronze IV horizon in Jordan, ca. 2400-2000 B.C. This has been until recently a "Dark Age" between the urban Early Bronze and Middle Bronze eras, but archaeo- logical discoveries now being made, primarily in Jordan, are rapidly clarifying it. This paper summarizes new evidence from the excava- tions of K. Prag at the small village of Iktinu, at the north- ern end of the Dead Sea, and of E. Olivarri at the encamp- ment at 'Ar6e'r, on the north rim of the Arnon Gorge. The excavations of W.E. Rast and R.T. Shaub at Bib edh- Dhri', on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, are particularly important for both the cemetery and village. Most striking at the moment are the domestic remains and the city walls and gate being investigated by S. Richard at Khirbet Iskan-</page><page sequence="10">276 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 der, on the Wadi Wala, the latter being unique in the whole of Palestine in this period. In the Jordan Valley, two recent sites are especially sig- nificant. The first is the University of Arizona's excavation under S. Falconer and B. Magness-Gardiner at Tell el- Hayyat and Tell en-Neaj, near Pella, both permanent agri- cultural villages. Further south, S. Helms is bringing to light a large village and cemetery at Tell Umm Hamad esh- Sharqi. These recent excavations are shedding much light not only on EB IV settlement types and patterns, but also on economy, technology, social structure, and foreign relations. THE KATARET ES-SAMRA PROJECT: 1985: Albert Leo- nard, Jr., University of Arizona The 1985 excavations at Kataret es-Samra, located in the eastern Jordan Valley ca. 25 miles northwest of Amman, at- tempted to answer two major questions. 1) Was the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1550-1200 B.C.) tomb, previously cleared by the Department of Antiquities, an isolated occurrence or part of a major cemetery? The 1985 season of work pro- duced a vertical shaft filled with over 50 restorable vessels, and a burial chamber holding a dozen skeletons, a small de- posit of pots, glass beads, an Egyptian scarab, and a few fragments of bronze. The ceramic material would be espe- cially at home in the 13th century B.C. and suggests that we do, in fact, have an LB cemetery here. 2) Was the scatter of fourth-millennium artifacts (pottery and flints) discovered on the plateau above the LB tomb to be associated with a settled or transhumant society? Our small 1985 probe pro- duced evidence of mudbrick walls and detritus together with major pottery types of the Early Bronze I period, suggesting occupation here during that time. Below the EB I stratum we encountered a handmade pottery which in fabric and form relates to that of the Chalcolithic period, but which is decorated with red and/or black paint. This discovery must represent an even earlier occupation at the site and further exposure of this early horizon will be a major goal of future excavation seasons. TELL EL-MAZAR: THE EXCAVATION OF CEMETERY A: Khair N. Yassine, University of Jordan Tell el-Mazar, a classically shaped tell that dates predom- inantly to the first millennium B.C., is located ca. 3 km. east of the Jordan River and ca. 3 km. north-northwest of the im- portant Bronze Age site of Deir 'Alla. Excavations in Ceme- tery A, situated ca. 200 m. north of the tell itself were begun in 1977 when the area was threatened by the expansion of lo- cal farms. Since then, 84 graves have been excavated, ranging from simple pit interments to jar and larnax burials. All seem to date to the Iron IIC/Persian period (ca. 539-332 B.C.). Burials of males and females were represented and both seem to have been equally supplied with grave goods, indicating that the status of women was not inferior to that of men. Social distinctions among members of the same sex, however, are evident from the type and distribution of grave goods, which consist of local and imported pottery, bronze, alabaster and glass vessels, as well as stamp seals, cylinder seals, and scarabs. Analysis of the individual artifacts associated with the graves of Cemetery A reveals that the funerary furniture represents a homogeneous assemblage of the Iron IIC/Persian (Late Ammonite) era, roughly from the time of Cyrus to that of Alexander the Great. PELLA OF THE DECAPOLIS: Robert H. Smith, College of Wooster Pella is situated in the foothills of the northern Jordan Valley, east of the Jordan River. Its central feature is an oval mound, at the base of which is a strong spring that flows into a small valley; immediately to the south of the valley is a large natural hill which figured in the city's history. Settlement was made near the spring as early as the Neolithic Age; during the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Ages there was also notable occupation, though perhaps not continuous. The city is named in Egyptian texts at several times in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, which were pe- riods of prosperity for the city. Pella was occupied during the Iron Age, but there was a decline in population around 1100-800 B.C., and again during the Persian period (mid- sixth through late fourth centuries). In the second century B.C., perhaps after a refounding by the Seleucids, the city grew rapidly in population, and Semitic cultural influences gave way to Hellenistic ones, at least superficially. Hasmo- nean rulers of Palestine destroyed the city in 83/82 B.C. It was not until the following century that Pella began a fresh resurgence. In the latter part of that century the city became a refuge for Christians fleeing the Roman army in the First Jewish Revolt. The Roman period has left relatively few traces at Pella, apart from the remains of some public build- ings (an Odeum, Baths, and remains of temples). The city reached its greatest expansion during the period from Con- stantine to the Islamic conquest. After the Islamic victory at the Battle of Fihl (Pella) in A.D. 635, the city began a grad- ual decline that was only partly offset by increasing partici- pation in caravan trade from Arabia. An earthquake de- stroyed Pella in A.D. 747, and the inhabitants never rebuilt the city. Much of what is known about Pella comes from excavations conducted in recent years by the College of Wooster, Ohio, and the University of Sydney, Australia. 1986 EXCAVATIONS AT AQABA (AYLA): Donald Whit- comb, Oriental Institute, University of Chicago During the spring of 1986 the Oriental Institute con- ducted a brief three-week trial excavation at Aqaba which produced significant evidence for this important port city, including the city wall and intramural buildings surviving to a height of 4 m. In addition, a good stratigraphical se- quence was exposed covering the Late Byzantine and Early Islamic periods. A full season of work is planned for the spring of 1987.</page><page sequence="11">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 277 SESSION II D: COLLOQUIUM: RECENT AD- VANCES IN TEXAS ARCHAEOLOGY REFLECTIONS ON THE HISTORY OF TEXAS ARCHAEO- LOGY: E. Mott Davis, University of Texas at Austin In some states of the United States the earliest systematic archaeological activities were primarily avocational, in oth- ers professional, and in others a combination of the two. The early development of Texas archaeology saw an unusual mixture of avocational and academic effort. At The Univer- sity of Texas at Austin, J.E. Pearce organized scholarly studies. In Abilene, C. Ray, an osteopathic surgeon, created and maintained the Texas Archeological Society and its an- nual Bulletin. Elsewhere in the state, college faculty and others, mostly without formal archaeological training, un- dertook to apply themselves to the recovery and documenta- tion of local antiquities. These efforts were in large measure home grown and were of interest largely within the state. Texas archaeologists did not become part of the national ar- chaeological community until the time of J.G. McAllister in the late 1930s, and Texas archaeological research did not begin to make an impact on the national scene until A.D. Krieger's publications appeared after World War II. It was only in the 1960s and later, with the establishment of ar- chaeology in institutions throughout the state and the crea- tion of the Texas Antiquities Committee, that archaeologists in Texas became truly part of the national and international scene. Nonetheless, the heritage of pioneers such as Ray and Pearce can still be seen in the archaeological work that is done in Texas today. METHOD AND THEORY IN TEXAS ARCHAEOLOGY: A LOOK BACK: Harry J. Shafer, Texas A&amp;M Univer- sity Method and theory in Texas archaeology have been in- fluenced to varying degrees by national trends. This paper traces the development of archaeological method and theory in the state from 1920 to 1986. Until the 1940s, Texas was a theoretical backwater. The theoretical position changed in the 1940s and 1950s with the broad applications of the Mid- western Taxonomic System, ceramic and projectile point typologies, cross-dating, and Early Man studies. The advent of radiocarbon dating led to a shift toward chronology- building but the research remained largely descriptive in na- ture. Uses of these various approaches continued well into the 1970s as Texas again slipped out of the theoretical mainstream. American archaeology in the meantime moved beyond description into the realm of human ecology and cul- tural materialism, defining and explaining cultural varia- bility. Ecological studies caught on briefly in the 1970s and led to some of the better anthropological studies in Texas archaeology. Variable approaches have been applied since the 1960s with the expansion in the number of academic institutions doing archaeology. Some Texas archaeologists leaned in the direction of the explanatory trends in the mid- 1970s and in the 1980s with the rise of competition in con- tract archaeology. None were on the cutting edge of theory, however, and they were generally following the popular na- tional trends. At present, the methods and theoretical ap- proaches used by Texas archaeologists are eclectic. NEW PERSPECTIVES ON THE PALEO-INDIAN ERA IN TEXAS: DATA FROM THE WILSON-LEONARD SITE: Frank A. Weir, State Department of Highways and Public Transportation The Wilson-Leonard site in central Texas has provided a cultural record that covers the prehistoric periods for this area from 10,000 to 1,000 years ago. Examination of the data enlarges our knowledge of the Archaic in general. However, the components from the Early Archaic and Late Paleo-Indian periods are the most interesting. The data move the Early Archaic of central Texas in line with the Early Archaic of the southeastern United States, raise ques- tions on the concept of Paleo-Indian as it relates to the cul- tures in Texas, and suggest cultural affiliations with the southern Plains, the Midwest, and the southeastern United States. CLIMATIC CHANGE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON PREHISTOR- Ic TEXAS CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT: Joel Gunn, University of Texas at San Antonio In the 1940s and 1950s researchers into culture change in Texas suggested specific instances in which climate changes appeared to have influenced culture change. These re- searchers included A.D. Krieger in his work on the Ante- lope Creek focus in the Panhandle and J.C. Kelley in the Rio Grande valley of western Texas. Since that time, partic- ularly in central Texas, the idea of a climatically induced component as part of culture change has largely been aban- doned. The reasons for this are not entirely clear. It is prob- ably in part due to a scarcity of direct evidence of climate change in the region and in part due to an explicity stated assumption of the static nature of culture change by Texas archaeologists. Several new lines of evidence suggest that climate changes radically and regularly in Texas, especially in the Early and Late Holocene, and that the consequences of those changes are substantial and radical culture changes. The evidence for climate change is historical and linguistic, and the pre- historic record lends itself to such an interpretation. In short, cultural and climatic change in prehistoric Texas is more likely to fit a punctuated equilibrium model than a gradualistic or static model. PREHISTORIC ECONOMICS AT BAKER CAVE: Kenneth M. Brown, University of Texas at San Antonio The Lower Pecos, with its dry shelters, is one of the few areas in Texas offering opportunities for precise definition of</page><page sequence="12">278 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 prehistoric food economies. Most previous work on diet and nutrition has been based on just four sites: Hinds Cave, Co- nejo Shelter, Parida Cave, and Baker Cave. The data consist of plant macrofossil studies in some cases and coprolite stud- ies in others. A few other studies in surrounding areas (Cald- well Cave and Granado Cave, Culberson County; and Gob- bler Shelter, Crockett County) provide comparative data. Most of these studies have emphasized the extreme stability of prehistoric diet throughout the Holocene. Most studies have been qualitative in nature, however, looking at pres- ence-absence rather than shifts in frequency, or have been quantitative only to the point of listing counts or weights. Few have integrated studies of plant and animal remains. None of these studies have been embedded in a theoretical framework. Because the Lower Pecos is an area with margi- nal rainfall, it presumably has been subject to periodic envi- ronmental stress throughout the Holocene, and we can now at least roughly model an environmental stress curve for comparison with economic behavior. I propose that in stress- free periods an optimal foraging (minimax) model of eco- nomic behavior is appropriate, but in stressful periods a least-risk strategy may be more appropriate. Harvesting of lecheguilla and sotol, which seems to have first been pursued intensively at Baker Cave about 5000 years ago, is probably such a least-risk, but labor-intensive strategy. THE LOMA SANDIA PREHISTORIC CEMETERY, SOUTH- ERN TEXAS: Anna J. Taylor, University of Texas at San Antonio Archaeological excavations conducted in 1977-1978 at the Loma Sandia site (41LK28) in Live Oak County of southern Texas resulted in the discovery of an intensively used prehistoric cemetery. Within the cemetery were ap- proximately 180 burials with numerous associated features such as caches with antler, marine shell, and lithic artifacts; hearths and charcoal stains; and ocher stains and caches. By far the predominant lithic tool type found with the burials was the triangular Tortugas point, though a small number of Lange and Morhiss points, and also various types of gouges, cores, ground stone, and other lithic tool forms were recovered. Radiocarbon dates obtained thus far and diag- nostic artifacts from the mortuary features indicate that the cemetery was used during the Middle Archaic period (ca. 2500 B.C.-400 B.C.). Though the length of time the ceme- tery was used is not yet known, the location of the numerous burials and associated features within a limited area, and similarities in burial position and grave goods, may indicate relatively short-term utilization. The ongoing analysis of the Loma Sandia site data is adding to what is known about mortuary behavior in southern Texas during the Middle Archaic period, when cemeteries are first known to have ap- peared. On a broader scale, the Loma Sandia cemetery and other prehistoric cemeteries in southern, central, and south- eastern Texas are providing clues about social and economic processes in these regions through time. THE GEORGE C. DAVIS SITE: AN EARLY CADDOAN MOUND CENTER: Dee Ann Story, University of Texas at Austin The George C. Davis site lies in the central part of east- ern Texas, on a fertile alluvial terrace of the Neches River. The site is marked surficially by three earthen mounds, and village debris which is unevenly distributed over almost a half mile. Excavations carried out intermittently since 1939 have revealed a long and complex history of prehistoric use, with the main occupation occurring between A.D. 800- 1300. All of the mounds and most of the village remains (structures and artifacts) dating to this 500-year period re- late to a widespread and vigorous cultural tradition known as Caddoan and believed to be ancestral to the historic Cad- doan-speaking Indians of southeastern Oklahoma, south- western Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana, and northeast- ern Texas. Prehistoric mound centers such as the Davis Site occur throughout the area once occupied by Caddoan groups. Davis, however, stands out in several respects: 1) it lies on the southwestern frontier of the territory dominated by the early Caddo; 2) it has, for a Caddoan center, an ex- ceptionally large associated village; and 3) it is one of the few intensively excavated Caddoan centers. Because of the na- ture of the site and the archaeological investigations, it is possible to characterize in better-than-usual detail the cul- tural behavior that produced the mounds and to relate this behavior to a community integrated by a social and political organization based on differential ranking of individuals or groups of individuals. THE TEXAS STEWARDS PROGRAM: VOLUNTEERISM IN TEXAS ARCHAEOLOGY: Jimmy L. Mitchell, South- ern Texas Archaeological Association The Texas Stewards Program was established in 1984 by the Office of the State Archaeologist and is designed to en- hance the identification and protection of Texas' rapidly dis- appearing archaeological and historical resources. A coordi- nating committee of professional and senior avocational ar- chaeologists has identified key local avocationalists to be en- trusted with the responsibility of acting as the eyes and ears of the State Archaeologist. These local stewards have investi- gated reports of endangered sites, reviewed and documented local collections, recorded a number of new sites, and helped to educate the public about the needs of archaeological con- servation. In some instances, stewards have personally inter- vened to stop the looting of sites and have called in local law enforcement officers. A pilot project of the Stewards Pro- gram has been the sponsorship of a "Texas Coastal Bend Ar- chaeological Palaver," an unstructured forum aimed at drawing professional and avocational archaeologists togeth- er to consider the cultural resources of the Texas coast. This group has met annually for the last three years to help as- semble data for a regional synthesis, to define major problem areas, and to identify sites in need of study and protection. Such volunteerism has taken on added significance in Texas as budgets have been trimmed and the staff of the Texas His- torical Commission reduced. Indeed, with the prospect of</page><page sequence="13">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 279 shrinking budgets in the future, the Texas Stewards Pro- gram may take on new importance in the development of re- source protection plans in the State's archaeology. This structured volunteer network may well be the wave of the future for archaeology across the United States. THE OPEN CHAPEL OF SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO MIS- SION AT SAN ANTONIO: AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTER- PRETATION: Miguel Celorio, Universidad de las Americas Current scholarship on Spanish colonial archaeology re- quires close collaboration with architecture and history. The San Juan Capistrano mission church in San Antonio, Tex- as, illustrates this need. Its eastern facade with five blinded arches strongly suggests the presence of an open chapel. Due to lack of familiarity with this type of building, archaeolo- gical work in 1967 and 1968 did not explore the possibility of the arches once being open to the ample front space: a 19th-century engraving shows a clear difference between structural and filling material of arches; the number of arches and their particular dimensions determine an axial symmetry with respect to the central arch; the stone frame of the main doorway is of a later epoch and its lateral position is too unusual to be part of the original design; the two large windows are not of the colonial period, implying that, ori- ginally, people as well as light entered through the open arches; there are no arches on the west wall and pilasters alone mark the east side of the nave. Further archaeological research was undertaken by the author in 1975 in collabora- tion with the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas Historical Commission Probings in the wall under two of the arches showed that the intrados continued for 1 ft. inside the wall. The mortar is smooth and in relatively good condi- tion. It was applied from underneath and hardened from exposure. In the one probing through the blinding wall, re- mains were found of the original inner facing of the arch. These findings disagree with published interpretations of the 1967 and 1968 excavations. New research has been un- dertaken by the author on reports and inventories submitted by Franciscans who visited San Juan from 1745 to 1824. This paper presents a fresh interpretation of the architec- tural history of the church, based on a review of the friar's documents and taking into critical consideration the succes- sive archaeological campaigns. Until recently it was gener- ally accepted that open chapels were an architectural solu- tion to a specific problem of 16th-century Central Mexico and the Yucatan. Recent research has revealed in the Sierra Gorda of Queretaro a number of elaborate late 18th-century open chapels. These were built by the friars of the same Col- lege of Santa Cruz that erected the San Antonio missions. The open chapel can now be seen as a missionary device created in New Spain and very likely used under certain circumstances throughout its vast territories. If the earlier 18th-century mission church of San Juan Capistrano was originally an open chapel, it may be considered as one of the first examples of the revival of this great tradition. SESSION II E: AMERICAN ACADEMY IN ROME, PANEL: SHAPING PUBLIC OPIN- ION: PROPAGANDA AND EXEMPLA IN THE CITY OF ROME PALLADIS ARTES: THE ARACHNE MYTH AND THE FRIEZE FROM THE FORUM TRANSITORIUM: Eve D'Ambra, Yale University The sculptural decoration of Domitian's Forum Transi- torium is extant in the form of a frieze and an attic relief on one bay of a semi-engaged colonnade known as Le Colon- nacce. It is the significance of the frieze's rare depiction of an episode from the Arachne myth as well as its flanking scenes of women spinning, weaving, and carrying wool in the con- text of one of the imperial fora in Rome which provides the subject of this paper. Furthermore, the subsidiary sections of the frieze depart from these illustrations of the craft of weav- ing by depicting river deities, nymphs, and goddesses in landscape settings. Despite the attempts by scholars such as von Blanckenhagen (Flavische Architektur und ihre Dekora- tion [Berlin 1940] 118-27) who interpreted the frieze as commemorating the weavers' participation in Minerva's fes- tival, the Quinquatrus, and M. Picard-Schmitter (Latomus 24 [1965] 296-321) who recognized various weaving tech- niques in the more genre-like panels of the frieze, it is diffi- cult to read the frieze either as enfolding in a coherent con- tinuous narrative or as describing the weaving process. Al- though von Blanckenhagen's thesis concerning the frieze's topographical symbolism is masterful, he fails to explain ful- ly the presence of the ubertas imagery, the river gods, nymphs, and goddesses in the sacred sites, in his correlation of the frieze's deities with local craftsmen's shrines and cults. Rather than indicating a profession, the weaving motif alludes to the traditional duty of the Roman matron and, in fact, evokes the ideal of feminine virtue as attested in in- numerable funerary inscriptions and in historical writing. I propose that the seemingly disparate scenes depicted in this work are assembled thematically to form a series of moraliz- ing exempla involving some of the same issues of Domitian's program of moral reform, particularly through his revival of the lex Julia with its strengthening of the institution of mar- riage and proclaimed return to the revered mos maiorum. On the basis of comparative material from contemporary coin types, from the laudatory poetry of Martial and Statius, and from Hellenistic genre statuary, I attempt to show how the frieze is composed of a series of emblems demonstrating an ideal code of conduct. EKKLESIASTERION AND COMITIUM: ANOTHER ROMAN DEBT TO MAGNA GRAECIA: James Russell, Univer- sity of British Columbia In the form of a circular theatral area with adjacent curia, the Republican comitium has been recognized as a distinc- tive genre of Roman architecture for over a generation (L. Richardson, Archaeology 10[1957] 49-55; J. Russell, Phoe-</page><page sequence="14">280 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 nix 22 [1968] 307-308). Examples dating probably from the third century B.C. are known from the colonies of Alba Fu- cens, Cosa, and Paestum. At Rome itself, while the archaeo- logical evidence for the Comitium in its various Republican phases is confusing, Krause (RM 83 [1976] 51-61) has con- vincingly restored the mid-Republican Comitium in a form similar to the colonial examples. Even before the recognition of the comitium-curia as a distinctive category, E. Sj6qvist had argued for Greek in- fluence in the design of the Comitium at Rome (Studies Pre- sented to D.M. Robinson 1 [St. Louis 1951] 400-11), deriv- ing it from the fifth-century Pnyx at Athens. While the spe- cifics of his theory command little support today, his belief in a Greek source for the comitium as an architectural form has been dramatically vindicated in recent years by the dis- covery of a circular theatral assembly-place in certain Greek cities of southern Italy (Agrigentum, Metapontum, Paes- tum). Variously described as ekklesiasterion or bouleuterion, these structures must have provided the model for the comi- tium as it developed in Rome and its colonies. The date and circumstances of the borrowing of this form are still subject to debate. Coarelli, for example, argues that the circular ar- rangement of the Comitium at Rome was introduced from Sicily during the First Punic War (II Foro Romano: periodo repubblicano e augusteo [Rome 1985] 19-21). A strong case based on literary and numismatic evidence, however, may be made for a somewhat earlier date. Rome's deep involvement in Magna Graecia both during and immediately after the campaigns against Pyrrhus (280-274) supplies a probable context for Rome's adaptation of the Greek ekklesiasterion to its own requirements. PRINCES AND BARBARIANS ON THE ARA PACIS: C. Brian Rose, Columbia University Attempts to identify Gaius Caesar, natural son of Agrip- pa and adopted son of Augustus, on the processional frieze of the Ara Pacis have traditionally focused on a boy in East- ern dress situated next to Marcus Agrippa on the south side. In spite of the unusual and thoroughly non-Roman costume worn by the youth, scholars have insisted that this identifi- cation is one of the safest, since Gaius would have been placed next to his father. As a result of this attribution, a boy in barbarian garb on the northern side has been associated with Gaius' younger brother, Lucius. Yet both Gaius and Lucius had been legally adopted by Augustus eight years prior to the dedication of the altar and were, consequently, no longer the children of Agrippa. In monuments erected to the Agrippan family in Greece and Asia Minor, one detects a consistent effort to avoid the grouping of Gaius and Lucius with Agrippa after the adoption of 17 B.C. Thus the Ara Pacis would mark the first and only instance in which the two boys appeared with both their natural and adoptive fa- thers, an eccentricity which this paper shows is at odds with the historical and ideological content of the monument. Two youths on the north frieze are in fact readily identi- fiable as Gaius and Lucius, and it seems as if the designers of the altar deliberately placed Augustus and Agrippa on the south side and Gaius and Lucius on the north in order to avoid the problems entailed in grouping them with either their biological or legal father. The two barbarian children on the north and south sides of the altar, traditionally identi- fied as Gaius and Lucius, are clad in costumes indicative of Gaul and Asia Minor, respectively. These two foreign children seem to function as illustrations of the peace estab- lished in both East and West by Augustus and Agrippa in 13 B.C. THE MARRIAGE OF OCTAVIAN AND LIVIA: PROPA- GANDA AND TRUTH: Marleen B. Flory, Gustavus Adolphus College There are two different historical traditions about the marriage of Octavian and Livia. In one (Tac. Ann. 1.10.5, 5.1.2, 12.6.2; Suet. Aug. 62.2) Octavian is accused of for- cibly removing Livia from her husband, Tiberius Nero. In the second (Vell. Pat. 2.79.2, 2.94.1; Dio Cass. 48.44.3), Ti- berius Nero willingly betroths and gives his ex-wife in mar- riage. This paper argues that propaganda of Antony is re- sponsible for the account hostile to Octavian. Suetonius reports that Antony charged Octavian with the rape of another man's wife (Aug. 69.1) and also attacked him (Aug. 70.1-2) for playing the role of Apollo at a cena where the entertainment was a mime of the adulteria of the gods. My interpretation of a lampoon about the cena, quot- ed by Suetonius (Aug. 70.1-2), shows that Tiberius Nero and Livia were also actors and a mock theft of Livia from her husband, both in roles as deities, took place. The charge of a rape of an unspecified woman in Suet. Aug. 69.1 refers to the burlesque. My identification and analysis of an imi- tatio by Caligula of this cena (Suet. Calig. 25) also confirms this interpretation of Antony's propaganda. Tacitus undoubtedly preferred the hostile version for its portrayal of Octavian as a typical tyrant who exercised vis against other mens' wives. Analysis of the three passages in Tacitus which refer to the marriage shows that the tyrant type is key to Tacitus' portrait of Octavian. The paper ends with a discussion of how Augustus tried to blot out the scan- dal surrounding the beginning of his married life by creating a public image of Livia as a chaste, old-fashioned Roman matrona. PRO MIRACULO: AUGUSTUS' DEDICATION OF FOUR OBSIDIAN ELEPHANTS IN THE TEMPLE OF CONCORD: Barbara A. Kellum, Smith College The four obsidian elephants Augustus placed pro mira- culo in the temple of Concord (Pliny HN 36.196) belong to a neglected category of dedications in Rome. Such marvels, al- though they may appear anomalous to modern eyes, were, as will be demonstrated, integral to the Augustan program of display and often the objects most attuned to the popular imagination. The wonder and empathy the Roman populace felt for elephants is well documented (Cic. Fam. 7.1.3; Hor. Epist. 2.1.196). Prior to the dedication at the Temple of Concord</page><page sequence="15">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 281 they had already been associated with the emperor in honor- ific and triumphal contexts on coins and in other monu- ments. Their presence in the aedes Concordiae Augustae, however, served a more specific purpose. The temple's ideo- logical program revolved around the harmony of the gods, members of the imperial family, and by extension that of the entire social order. In this program the emperor's dedica- tions played a key role. Although the erudite may have rec- ognized a sly allusion to a Hellenistic precedent (Ael. NA 7.44; Plut. De soll. an. 17.972 BC), for most viewers it was very likely the nature of elephants themselves that came to mind in this context: peace-loving, obedient, monogamous, and war-like only when necessary (Pliny HN 8.1-15). Ele- phants, like the good citizen, flourished in the reign of pax, concordia, and salus publica (Dio Cass. 54.35.2; cf. Pliny HN 8.5). Like Concordia Augusta, elephants were appropriated by the princeps and transformed from war machines to im- perial property (Juv. 12.102). Not coincidentally, it was to be four living specimens of the breed which would bear the yoke of Divus Augustus in the pompa circensis (BMCRE I, 134, no. 102; cf. Anth. Pal. 9.285). SESSION III A: COLLOQUIUM: TIME AND CHRONOLOGY: CONTRASTING VIEWS OF CREATIONISTS AND EVOLUTIONISTS TIME AND CHRONOLOGY: CONTRASTING VIEWS OF CREATIONISTS AND EVOLUTIONISTS: INTRODUCTION: Charles A. Reed, University of Illinois at Chicago The recent attempts to make legal, where required by local statute, the principle of "equal time" for teaching of creationist and evolutionist interpretations of astronomy, geology, biology, sociology, etc., in American public schools may well have a profound influence on the public's under- standing of archaeology. Of these factors most archaeologists seem unaware, so a discussion has been thought important. The creationists, believing in the infallibility of the Bible, present as truth: the universe was created in six days of 24 hours each, ca. 6000 years ago (some would admit to pos- sibly 8000); a worldwide catastrophe, the Noachian Flood, occurred at about 2350 B.C. and destroyed all traces of prior cultures, drowned all terrestrial creatures which did not en- ter the Ark, and rearranged the topography so that the pre- Flood geography is not necessarily reconstructable. The Geologic Column was deposited during that single year of the Flood; the mountains were formed, and the oceanic bas- ins established during or immediately following that year. The present distribution of terrestrial life is a post-Flood phenomenon. According to the creationists, studies of astro- nomy, geology, biology, etc. confirm the Biblical story as to events, their sequence, and their chronology. Evolutionists first gather data and then interpret them to the best of their abilities, ignoring the supernatural (if existing) as not providing verifiable evidence for scientific study and conclusions. Using these techniques, the solar system is considered to have formed ca. 4.5 billion years ago; life on earth to have begun ca. 3.8 billion years ago; a good fossil record (the beginning of the Paleozoic era) to have begun ca. 550 million years ago; earliest evidence of Hominidae to be ca. 4 million years ago; and the earliest archaeological record, that of the first stone tools, to date to ca. 2 million years ago. The U.S. Supreme Court has accepted consideration of the problem of the constitutionality of requirements for "equal time," hitherto declared by Federal judges to be in conflict with the principle of separation of Church and State. THE FOSSIL RECORD: Nicholas Hotton III, Smithsoni- an Institution The fossil record covers more than two billion years of history, of which three areas are treated here: increasing complexity of the biota through time; conditions of fossiliza- tion, including catastrophic burial; and status of organisms transitional between major taxonomic groups. Data are most effectively interpreted in uniformitarian terms. The sequence of first record of major groups (procary- otes, eucaryotes and soft-bodied metazoans, shelly meta- zoans, and vertebrates) reflects increasingly complex ana- tomy. Within the vertebrates, classes follow one another in strict succession of increasing complexity. The record also shows increasing diversity and complexity of ecological in- terrelationships, as each new major taxon joins the preced- ing ones which have not become extinct. In no lineage iden- tified on anatomical grounds does the descendent group ap- pear before its putative ancestor. The record shows repeated alternation of marine and nonmarine conditions, and indicates that burial, which is necessary for fossilization, ranges from gradual to cata- strophic. Most catastrophes reflect local effects of seasonal droughts and floods, a few, regional effects of volcanic erup- tions, but none indicate worldwide effects. Local cata- strophes are commonly indicated by "bone beds," deposits of large numbers of bones, some articulated and some not. Bone beds are of very limited lateral extent and include but one or a few kinds of animals, and in none of them are ani- mals of different ages associated. Fossil organisms transitional between major taxa may not be as scarce as is claimed by conventional wisdom. To be po- tentially a transitional form, an organism need only embody structures that serve multiple functions simultaneously, and this condition is probably met more commonly than not. Syn- apsid reptiles illustrate in profound detail the transition be- tween reptilian and mammalian levels of organization. GEOLOGY AND THE AGE OF THE EARTH: John D. Mor- ris, Institute for Creation Research Most evolutionists assume that things have been rather uniform throughout history, that the past must be explained and understood in light of present processes. Creationists as-</page><page sequence="16">282 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 sume that there have been episodes in history quite different from anything possible in the present world. While scien- tists cannot prove a view of the past, they can compare two or more competing models and determine which model han- dles the data better than the others. Consider the fossil record. Evolution (that all life came from a common ancestor) implies that multitudes of transi- tional life forms must have lived and died. Creation (sudden appearance and stasis) implies that life forms would appear fully formed with no transitional links to other life forms. Today's evolutionary paleontologists lament the complete lack of transitional forms in the fossil record. This and many other aspects of the fossil record invalidate its use in dating the earth. Consider the geologic record. In recent years many lead- ing geologists have espoused "neo-catastrophism," claiming that nearly all geologic formations were formed rapidly and catastrophically, with great lengths of time passing at the interface between the layers (i.e., where there is little or no data). Creationists ascribe the majority of the geologic re- cord to one major catastrophe, with no major time breaks between the beds. A careful look at the rocks better supports the idea of rapid and continuous processes, thereby under- mining the radiometric dates which seem to indicate widely separate events. RADIOMETRIC DATING AND THE MEASUREMENT OF GEOLOGIC TIME: Marvin A. Lanphere, U.S. Geo- logical Survey The geologic time scale is a chronologic arrangement of geologic events and is based on layered rock sequences that contain fossils. Radiometric dating methods, which are tech- niques of age measurement based on principles of physics, have been used successfully to verify independently the geo- logic time scale and to quantify its subdivisions and duration. Radiometric dating methods utilize the decay of long- lived radioactive isotopes that occur naturally in rocks and minerals. These radioactive parent isotopes decay to stable daughter isotopes; the amounts of both isotopes can be mea- sured and the rate of decay can be determined experimental- ly. Several different parent-daughter pairs have been used to determine the ages of rocks and minerals. Agreement of ages measured by different dating methods on the same material provides strong verification for the fundamentals of radio- metric dating. Geologists over the past two centuries have used strati- graphic and paleontologic evidence to construct a relative geologic time scale for Phanerozoic rocks, those that were deposited over about the past 600 million years, which con- stitute about 13 percent of the Earth's history. Fossils are rare in rocks formed during pre-Phanerozoic time, and the geological record for most of the Earth's early history de- pends heavily on radiometric dating. The oldest rocks on the Earth occur in Greenland, North America, southern Africa, and Australia; the ages of these rocks range from 3500 to 3800 million years. Evidence of even older rocks is provided by ages of 4100-4200 million years for detrital zircons de- posited in sedimentary rocks in western Australia. The ear- liest part of the Earth's history has not yet been completely deciphered, but extensive radiometric dating of meteorites and Moon rocks indicates that meteorites and planets, in- cluding the Earth, formed about 4550 million years ago. GEOCHRONOLOGY, ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE GENESIS RECORD: Henry M. Morris, Institute for Creation Research The scientific case for creation is not dependent on the Biblical chronology. Nevertheless, conservative monotheists have accepted the Genesis record as the divinely revealed account of the true origin and history of the earth and its earliest inhabitants. This acceptance has been based on sound evidence, and it can be shown that the factual data of the various sciences can be correlated at least as well within this Genesis record as they can within the uniformitarian framework of the geological-ages system. Neither model can be proven, since both lie outside the scope of experimental observation and reproducibility. The models, however, can be compared in terms of their ability to correlate the maxi- mum amount of data with fewer secondary explanations. In the Genesis chronology practically all data of archaeo- logy are regarded as post-Flood, with the Flood itself re- corded in the fossiliferous sedimentary rocks of the geologic column. Acceptance of the Biblical model would entail no essential change in archaeological methodology except for a reduction in the "absolute" dates assigned to certain ar- chaeological events, most of which are currently based on ra- diometric dating (e.g., radiocarbon). All such methods of chronometry are highly dependent on the assumptions behind them (e.g., constant rates, closed sys- tems, initial boundary conditions), which can be shown in most cases to be unrealistic. Since there are numerous other methods and processes which, even with these same assump- tions, will yield a much shorter chronology, it may be that evolutionary presuppositions (which, by their very nature, demand a long chronology) are dictating which methods and which assumptions are acceptable, and which are not. It would seem that a genuinely scientific search for truth would favor an open-minded, two-model approach in the evaluation and interpretation of geological and archaeo- logical data. SESSION III B: COLLOQUIUM: NEW DIREC- TIONS IN IMPERIAL ROMAN ARCHITEC- TURE THE ORGANIZATION OF ROMAN BUILDING: THE EVI- DENCE OF THE JURISTS: Susan Martin, University of Tennessee, Knoxville A number of texts preserved in Digesta 19.2 and 45.1 dis- cuss the contractual relationship between landowner and building contractor, offering considerable insight into the</page><page sequence="17">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 283 use of contracting as a way of organizing private building projects. In this paper, I consider the organization of Roman construction in the light of this evidence. The first part of the paper summarizes the development of Roman jurisprudence in regard to the two commonly used contractual forms, loca- tio conductio operis and stipulatio. Several texts suggest that the Roman jurists increasingly encouraged the use of stan- dards and practices current in the building trade as yard- sticks for deciding disputes in construction contracts. This technique is evident in three texts which seem specifically to advocate using "standards in the trade" as a technique for judging the builder's performance (Dig. 19.2.24 pr.; 45.1.137.3; 19.2.58.1). Other texts demonstrate a consider- able diminution and differentiation in the builder's overall liability for his work under the contract (Dig. 19.2.62; 19.2.59). This body of law implies a significant amount of participation in the legal system by building contractors who had at least the bare minimum of legal and financial sophis- tication necessary to undertake lawsuits. The assumption underlying these texts is that a recognizable group of profes- sional builders existed from whom information about stan- dard practices could be obtained. The second part of the pa- per attempts to reconstruct from the meager evidence pre- viously collected (e.g., H. Loane, Industry and Commerce in the City of Rome [1938] 79-86; J.L.D. Pearse (The Organi- sation of Roman Building during the Late Republic and Early Empire [Diss. Cambridge Univ. 1974]) a model for understanding the organization of construction at Rome. THE MAUSOLEUM OF AUGUSTUS AND ITALIAN TUMULI OF THE IMPERIAL PERIOD: Ian M. Sutherland, Duke University While the dynastic tomb of Augustus, built in Rome in 29 B.C., owed much of its form and symbolism to the Mauso- leum in Halicarnassos and other splendid Hellenistic royal tombs, its complex masonry infrastructure and outward ar- chitectonic embellishment significantly altered the history of tumuli in Italy by creating a new pattern, divergent from the traditional Etruscan model, and by giving new meaning to the tumulus form. In the early years of the Empire, sup- porters of Augustus and the new political order, by choosing tumuli for their own monuments and reflecting the innova- tions of the Augustan mausoleum in their construction, could project the image of the tumuli occupants, present or future, as standing firmly by the political ideology of the princeps. Until the time of Trajan periodic imperial addi- tions to the occupants of the Mausoleum of Augustus en- sured the importance of the Mausoleum as a model for tombs through the first century. Hadrian found it necessary to build a new imperial tomb when the Mausoleum of Augustus was filled, and his choice of type, with the addition of a square base, continued to ad- here to the Augustan precedent. His Mausoleum eventually housed all of the Antonines, yet proved to be the last notable expression of its kind. For important Roman citizens outside the royal family, funerary architecture was less commonly employed as a symbol of support for the regime, and prob- ably in deference to the imperial purple, the tumulus evolved into other forms and passed out of use in Italy in the second century. THE GENESIS OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES AT ROME: T. Keith Dix, College of William and Mary The first century B.C. sees the first public libraries in the city of Rome, projected by Julius Caesar and carried out by Asinius Pollio and Augustus. The public library becomes the architectural expression of two new phenomena, the idea of literature as "public property" and the role of the emperor as literary patron. In an examination of the surviving evidence for the earliest state libraries (in the Atrium Libertatis, the sanctuary of Palatine Apollo, and the Porticus Octaviae), I trace the evolution of the library building from private to public patronage. In particular, I discuss the architectural forebears of the Roman public library in the Greek world and in Italy, the development of a standard decorative pro- gram for public libraries, including the use of authors' por- traits, and the use of libraries as public recitation halls to en- courage and reward literary merit. This use clearly affects the architectural form of the library: provisions made for rec- itations in the Palatine library, for example, probably also made it suitable for the Senate meetings which took place there (see D. Thompson, AJA 85 [1981] 335-39). At the same time, the need for a large open space to accommodate an audience, as well as the monumentalization of the library, may actually have rendered the main hall of library build- ings less suitable for one important library function, the stor- age of books. In this connection, I will briefly consider the issue raised by L. Johnson (Diss. Brown Univ. 1984) of the suitability of niches for book storage. IMPERIAL ORATORY AND THE ROMAN TEMPLUM-Ros- TRATUM: Roger B. Ulrich, Rice University A platform built into the steps of the Temple of Castor and Pollux provided the setting for some of the Late Re- public's most emotionally charged orations. Julius Caesar himself spoke from this spot. When a broad rostra was built on to the podium of the Temple of Venus Genetrix (dedicat- ed in 46 B.C.), the relationship between temple and speak- er's platform was formalized. Here, on the northern boun- dary of the Forum lulium, stairways built into the sides of the shrine's podium freed the entire facade of the temple to accommodate the broad rostra. The novel plan of the Temple of Venus Genetrix evident- ly appealed to the architects of Augustus and his successors. Augustus redefined the east boundary of the Forum Roma- num with a temple dedicated to the Deified Caesar; the shrine shared not only the proportional system but also the facade rostra and lateral stairs introduced by the nearby Temple of Venus Genetrix. By the mid-first century A.C., such "templa-rostrata" had appeared in the fora of other provincial towns. Scattered literary sources, epigraphic and numismatic evidence indicate that such rostra were used pri- marily by members of the imperial family, their provincial</page><page sequence="18">284 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 civic representatives, or priests. The temples themselves were often dedicated to a deified emperor, the goddess Roma, or a combination of the two. The popular adaptation of the Roman temple plan in this way tangibly illustrates the in- fluence of the new political order on traditional architectural forms. Here the imperial orator occupies physical space sus- pended between the realm of the mortal and the god. THE "ARCH OF GALLIENUS": EVIDENCE FOR CHANG- ING ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS IN THIRD-CEN- TURY ROME: Laetitia La Follette, Princeton Univer- sity The conspicuous display of architectural elements reused from earlier monuments (spolia) is widely recognized as a major change in aesthetic standards in late Roman building. First found in Rome in monuments of the latter part of the third century (e.g., in the Arcus Novus, 293-294) and per- haps best known from the Arch of Constantine (312-315), the precise origins of spolia are still debated, although the practice seems clearly linked to the diminished supply of suitable raw material, and perhaps also to the lack of skilled artisans in the capital. This paper argues that the "Arch of Gallienus" is the earliest known monument to reflect a new attitude towards the reuse of Roman architecture. The pap- er surveys briefly those third-century public monuments in Rome which incorporate reused material, showing that be- fore the time of Gallienus architectural spolia tended to be hidden rather than prominently displayed. In contrast, the "Arch of Gallienus" conspicuously reuses an earlier public monument, the Augustan Porta Esquilina, transforming it by the addition of a double inscription (CIL VI.1106) into a new monument dedicated by a Roman equestrian to the Emperor Gallienus and his wife Salonina (260-268). The paper suggests that the choice of the Augustan construction for the Gallienic monument was a deliberate one and relates it to other recent discussion of spolia in Roman monuments constructed in Gallienus' reign. The significance of the "Arch of Gallienus" in the light of the controversy over the meaning of spolia is briefly explored in conclusion. SESSION III C: COLLOQUIUM: ARCHAEO- METALLURGICAL PERSPECTIVES: CHAL- LENGING THE OLD PICTURE WITH RE- CENT FINDINGS EARLY CYCLADIC COPPER METALLURGY: SOME Evi- DENCE FOR RESOURCES AND ORIGINS: N.H. Gale, University of Oxford The sudden expansion of Aegean metallurgy in the Early Bronze Age has been described by Schachermeyr as a "Me- tallschock" and by Renfrew as a metallurgical revolution; it certainly had important social consequences for warfare, craft specialization, and the hierarchical development of so- cieties. It is of some importance to have evidence to decide be- tween the view of Schachermeyr and Buchholz that the EB II Metallschock was largely the result of the import of met- als produced in Anatolia or the view of Renfrew that, while the concept of metallurgy may have come from outside, its Cycladic manifestation was a local, independent innovation. Some support for Renfrew's view is found in the evidence for EC II working of the lead-silver mines on Siphnos and at Lavrion, and the proof using lead isotope analyses that the majority of EC lead and silver artifacts were made from ores from these two mines (Gale and Stos-Gale, BSA 76 [1981] 169-224). Scientific and archaeological evidence is presented in this paper for the existence on the Cycladic island of Kythnos of an EC II copper smelting site at which arsenical copper was accidentally produced from arsenical copper ores. Lead ana- lyses show that a majority of the EC II tools and weapons found at Amorgos and Kythnos are consistent with produc- tion from local ores on Kythnos. Analysis shows that EC II/IIIA objects are made either of copper or arsenical cop- per. The objects excavated at the EC IIIA site of Kastri on Syros are anomalous, being largely of tin-bronze; scientific and archaeological evidence suggests that they were brought in by Anatolian refugees from the northwest Aegean and have no significance for indigenous Cycladic metallurgy. LEAD ISOTOPE ANALYSIS AND ANATOLIAN SILVER SOURCES: K. Ashhan Yener, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and L. Barnes, National Bureau of Stan- dards A veritable revolution is in progress in applying science in archaeology. Our approach has been to utilize lead iso- tope ratios and trace element analyses to answer questions about the nature of technological development, its effect on the emerging polities of Anatolia, and the exchange of pro- cessed metal especially in the critical Middle Bronze Age. A cooperative program of analytical research in lead isotope and trace element studies was implemented to generate data for the understanding of the interregional silver-gold-tin trade of Ktiltepe-Kanesh. An attempt will be made to syn- thesize information on the possible sources of silver for this period. The success of cooperative research in previous years is manifested by the discovery of stannite tin in Bolkardag in appreciable quantities. As a result, an important new di- mension has been added to the potentials of future lead iso- tope studies of Turkish ores. The isotope studies have been undertaken by the Inor- ganic Analytical Research Division of the National Bureau of Standards in collaboration with the Scientific Research Department of the Corning Museum of Glass. The basic assumptions of lead isotope analysis are discussed, and po- tential problem areas and limitations of the analyses are pointed out. The results of the new Anatolian silver-lead</page><page sequence="19">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 285 isotope ratios for Bolkardag and Aladag in the Taurus and the Keban mines are also presented. UR AND TEPE GAWRA: THE MESOPOTAMIAN METALS PROJECT: J.D. Muhly, University of Pennsylvania In 1977 Sir Max Mallowan, who as a young man had excavated with Woolley at Ur, remarked that ".. .it is as- tonishing to see recent illustrations of the implements dis- covered in the Royal Cemetery of Ur and still bearing the caption 'Copper or Bronze.' Analysis of the metallurgy should be a requirement demanding the highest priority" (Expedition 20:1 [1977] 4). Obviously if anything was going to be done in the United States about meeting that priority it could only be done at the University of Pennsylvania whose University Museum was co-sponsor of Sir Leonard Wool- ley's excavations at Ur and therefore has in its collections the only material from the Royal Cemetery to be found in this country. In 1981 the author helped to organize the Mesopotamian Metals Project at the University of Pennsylvania, working closely with R. Dyson, Director of the University Museum, and with S. Fleming, Scientific Director of the Museum's Applied Science Center for Archaeology (MASCA). The Project has been generously supported by two research grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). We are grateful to the NEH for this support which has made it possible to carry out a broadly based analytical program. To date we have examined about 350 copper and copper- based artifacts from Mesopotamia. Most of the objects came from the collections of the University Museum save for those from the site of Kish, now held by the Field Museum in Chicago. The sites of Ur (in the south) and Tepe Gawra (in the north) supplied most of the material, with smaller num- bers of objects from Fara, Nippur, Kish, Tell Billa, and sites in the region of the Diyala. For every one the objects studied we have an elemental or chemical analysis obtained by PIXE (Proton-Induced-X-ray-Emission), done together with C. Swann at the University of Delaware. In addition, roughly one-fourth of the corpus has been studied by metal- lography, under the supervision of R. Maddin, now of Har- vard University. This paper gives a general overview of the Project, con- centrating upon material from Ur and Tepe Gawra. These two sites present interesting contrasts and comparisons, both geographically and technologically. In general the metal in- dustry at Gawra appears to be both traditional and conser- vative while that at Ur presents considerable variation com- bined with an ability to innovate. COPPER, IRON, TIN, WOOD: THE START OF THE IRON AGE IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN: Jane C. Waldbaum, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Since 1971, the prevailing theory for increasing use of iron vis-A-vis bronze in the eastern Mediterranean has been a shortage in the ingredients for making bronze (Snodgrass, Dark Age of Greece [Edinburgh 1971] 231, 237-39). Ac- cording to this hypothesis, the political upheavals of the late 13th and 12th centuries B.C. in the eastern Mediterranean were also responsible for a disruption in the supply of essen- tial raw materials, especially tin. Diminution in the tin sup- ply caused a decrease in the quality of bronzes and this forced metal workers to turn to the more locally abundant iron ores to produce necessary metal artifacts. Recent analyses, however, of bronze objects from several widely scattered sites dating to the 12th century B.C. and thereafter (e.g., Lefkandi, Nichoria, the Baq'ah Valley) have shown no diminution in the tin contents (cf. Popham and Sackett, Lefkandi I [London 1980] 447-59; Rapp and Aschenbrenner eds., Excavations at Nichoria I [Minnea- polis 1978] 171-76; McGovern et al., Late Bronze/Early Iron Age Transjordan: The Baq'ah Valley Project, 1977- 1981 [forthcoming]). On the contrary, most of the bronzes tested contain tin well within the normal range. On the basis of these data, the tin shortage theory is ques- tioned and other proposals for the introduction of iron are assessed. In particular, Wertime's suggestion (JFA 10 [1983] 445-52) that the greater fuel efficiency of iron over copper production played a major role, especially in view of possible extensive deforestation at the end of the Late Bronze Age, is examined. DAMASCUS STEEL: ORIGINS AND TECHNOLOGY: Mark Edward Hall, University of California, Berkeley Using data from the archaeological record, literary sourc- es, and materials science, this paper examines the techno- logy required to manufacture Damascus steel. By under- standing the technology, a better idea of when Damascus steel first appeared can be gained. IRON SMELTING IN ANCIENT CHINA: William Rostoker, University of Illinois at Chicago Iron-making was a major industry in China by about 500 B.C. Rather than producing the solid, highly pure iron pro- duct characteristic of early iron smelting in the rest of the world, Chinese technology followed a route of smelting to a liquid cast iron (pig iron). Of necessity the solid (bloom) iron product channeled manufacturing techniques to forg- ing and forming, whereas the liquid iron product directed Chinese fabrication technology to casting which had already been well developed by at least 1000 years of prior experi- ence. From about 200 B.C. onwards, the Chinese pioneered a number of mass-production techniques for casting many millions of units of implements, tools, and weapons. The cast iron plough tip, for example, was a major factor in ex- panding agricultural land use, mining, canal, and road building. In the course of time, the processing of cast iron to wrought iron was developed. So also was a unique and re-</page><page sequence="20">286 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 markably simple process for crucible smelting to either a solid or liquid iron product. The Chinese facility for smelting to cast iron was a short shaft furnace, probably no more than 3 m. high. The fur- nace height was limited for a number of technical reasons. China is endowed with large surface deposits of good qual- ity iron ore suitable for smelting in small furnaces. At one time their forests were adequate for a large and continuing demand for charcoal. By 1000 A.C. the use of coal for smelt- ing began to dominate the industry. A unique air pumping system, crucial to high temperature smelting, was devised by the Chinese at some early but undefined date. SESSION III D: GREEK VASE PAINTING AND ICONOGRAPHY ATTIC POTTERY WORKSHOP SIZE, SIXTH-FIFTH CEN- TURIES B.C.: Michael M. Eisman, Temple Univer- sity There has been a continuing discussion of the size and distribution of tasks in the various pottery workshops in Athens in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. In a recent study, I. Scheibler ("Zum mutmasslichen gr6sse Tipfereien des 6. Jahrhunderts v. Chr.," in Bridjer ed., Ancient Greek and Related Pottery, [1984] 130-34) has attacked the idea that there were large-scale workshops. This paper refutes Scheibler's position, showing that there must have been a number of large-scale workshops employing between 30 and 40 workers at the same time. The production of painted pot- tery must have been a vital industry with 100-200 employ- ees (including slaves and management personnel) active in close proximity at any given time. The evidence for this is drawn not only from the well- known shop of Nikosthenes upon which most previous dis- cussions have been based, but on the workshops connected with the White Heron Group, the Leagros Group, and An- dokides. This analysis considers both different painters us- ing vases by the same potters and vice versa as well as rela- tions of contemporary painters and groups of painters as de- veloped by Beazley and others. Further, distribution of tasks within the workshop are used to determine minimum work- shop size. A discussion of the Amasis and Berlin Painter shops will show that the number of workers involved in somewhat smaller operations was still large by pre-industri- al standards. THE LARGE CIRCULAR PIT AT ISTHMIA AND THE HIS- TORY OF FIFTH-CENTURY CORINTHIAN PAINTING: Julie L. Bentz, Gustavus Adolphus College, and Helga Butzer Felleisen, Indiana University The Large Circular Pit near the Temenos of Poseidon is the largest deposit yet found at Isthmia. It is unstratified, with late disturbances in the upper 5 m. (O. Broneer, Isth- mia II [Princeton 1973] 135-36). Many objects were da- maged by fire during the destruction of the Archaic temple. The latest such pieces, both Corinthian and Attic, date to the second quarter of the fifth century B.C. A few vases, includ- ing Corinthian kotylai and Attic Pheidias mugs, date to mid- fifth century or just beyond, but none show any sign of burn- ing. The Pit was undoubtedly filled with destruction debris during the landscaping of the Classical Temenos. Its con- tents differ from Corinthian domestic deposits in the virtual absence of cooking ware and Attic stemmed kylikes, and the presence of unusual numbers of Attic mugs, cylinder leky- thoi, Corinthian trefoil olpai, mortars, and perirrhanteria. One perirrhanterion is outstanding for its painted and in- cised decoration. Its most spectacular feature, a chariot race painted on white ground, adorns the upper surface of the rim. The paint is largely fugitive, but the fluidly incised lines suggest that this race was executed in black-figure technique. Although the realism of motion and detail finds parallels in Attic vase-painting of the later fifth century, this perirrhanterion numbers among the heavily burned objects from the Pit and thus cannot postdate ca. 460 B.C. Given the strong evidence for dating, the chariot race provides an important example of the development and style of contem- porary Corinthian painting. IDENTIFICATION OF A SCENE BY THE BRYGOS PAINTER: D.M. O'Higgins, Ohio State University Three fifth-century cups depict on exterior surfaces scenes from Ajax's life-the quarrel with Odysseus, and the voting. One, by Douris, (Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Mu- seum IV 3695) presents in the tondo a "denouement." Odys- seus hands the disputed armor to Neoptolemos. The two others are by the Brygos Painter (New York, Metropolitan Museum L 69-11.35, from the Bareiss Collection; London, British Museum E.69). The Bareiss cup's tondo has been variously interpreted. M. Davies argues persuasively for Tecmessa shrouding the dead Ajax ("Ajax and Tecmessa. A Cup by the Brygos Painter in the Bareiss Collection," AntK 16 [1973]). The figures depicted in the tondo of the third cup-a man leading a woman by the wrist-also have been variously in- terpreted, as Agamemnon and Briseis, or, more likely, ac- cording to D. Robertson, Odysseus and Chryseis (AR V 369.2), M. Davies (p. 67, n. 40) mentions M. Robertson's suggestion that the scene depicts Ajax leading Tecmessa captive. Sophocles provides a clue. In Ajax, lines 496-504, Tec- messa anticipates humiliating transference to another chief after Ajax's death. The literature is otherwise silent about her fate. Whether the Brygos Painter followed literary sources, now lost, or created his own "trilogy," the scene is unusually interesting. Tecmessa, veiled-in mourning, like Thetis in Iliad 24.93-94?-is led away, probably by Odys- seus (wearing the characteristic petasos) or, less likely, by Agamemnon. As on the Bareiss cup, emphasis shifts from Ajax in this final scene, and his widow expresses the tragedy brought about by the events on the exterior surfaces.</page><page sequence="21">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 287 EROS AS ARCHER: Karl Kilinski II, Southern Metho- dist University Eros with a bow and an arrow is common in Greek art from the fourth century B.C. Prior to this time his appear- ance in art as an archer has been known only rarely in the fifth century: on a bronze ring from Epirus (BCH 80 [1956] 305) considered to be of the second quarter of the century, on metope East 11 of the Parthenon, and on an Attic red-figure neck-amphora by the Suessula Painter (Arias, Hirmer, and Shefton, History of Greek Vase Painting, no. 221) datable to the end of the century. To this list can be added an Attic red- figure lekythos attributable to the Brygos Painter and now in the Kimbell Art Museum (AP 84.16) in Fort Worth. On this vase Eros is a handsome youth with wings, shawl, and quiver, who draws back his bow in preparation to shoot an arrow at an unseen victim. Flanking the isolated figure of Eros is a dipinto which appears to be HO PAIS KALOS. Other vases by the Brygos Painter (AR V2 384.218-20, all lekythoi) depict Eros but none show him with a bow and arrow. In other Greek artworks of the fifth century, Eros can be found holding a whip, an ax, or a razor in his role as instigator of violent physical passion. The bow and arrow ultimately become the canonical replacements of these wea- pons in art. In literature, Euripides (Heracl. 1090, Hipp. 392, IA 546ff., Med. 530f., 632) is the first to bestow the bow and arrow on Eros. Being a work by the Brygos Painter, the Kimbell lekythos can be dated on stylistic grounds to the years around 480 B.C. It is, therefore, earlier than any of the artworks depict- ing Eros with a bow mentioned above. The significance of the Kimbell lekythos is that it bears the earliest representa- tion of Eros as an archer in Western art. THE EUANDRIA RECONSIDERED: Nancy B. Reed, Tex- as Tech University Among the lesser events at the Greater Panathenaic Fes- tival was the Euandria, a contest so vaguely alluded to in literary and inscriptional references that, beyond requiring "large size and strength" and being organized on a team bas- is (Xen. Mem. 3.3, 12), we know little else. By the fourth century, its victors received 100 drachmas and an ox or, ac- cording to Aristotle (Ath. Pol. 60, 3), shields. Three Pan- athenaic amphoras, however, may serve to illuminate this contest. In Paris is an example already tentatively identified as showing some portion of the Euandria, illustrated on the reverse with a man carrying two shields and apparently dancing on the backs of two horses (J.A. Davidson, "Notes on the Panathenaea," JHS 77 [1958] 23-43). A hoploma- chia scene in Madrid (ca. 530 B.C.) may suggest another portion of the event; the hoplomachia is known neither as a separate event during sixth-century Panathenaic Festivals, nor as one deserving the famous amphoras at any time. The third example, in the Hunt Collection (Ft. Worth, Tex.), shows a nude figure carrying two shields (ca. 500-490 B.C.). Rather than illustrating some portion of the Pyrrhic Dance as has been proposed (D. von Bothmer, in J.F. Tompkins ed., Wealth of the Ancient World [Ft. Worth 1983] 66-67), it should be associated with the other two am- phoras. The three together provide at last some glimpse of this otherwise elusive competition. KOUROI AND MODERN OLYMPIC ATHLETES: Eleanor Guralnick, Loyola University of Chicago Visual analysis of Archaic Greek sculpture as well as analyses of proportions based on measurements have en- hanced our understanding of the individuality of each kour- os statue. Why are these statues so strongly individualized even as they represent thoroughly idealized non-portraits? These distinctive types are generally understood in the con- text of style. Differences have been thought to represent the local ideal of a particular place or workshop, or the broadly accepted ideal of a particular time. This descriptive associ- ation does not explain the source for the style or the reasons for change from earlier ideals to later ones. It is generally accepted that Greek ideals were based on the study of the human body and that nude athletes served as models for sculptured figures, but without reference to specific indivi- duals. Comparisons between kouroi and modern Olympic athletes, using published standard anthropometric photo- graphs of 137 track and field athletes at the 17th Olympic Games (Rome 1960), reveals that the physique or body type of a successful athlete relates directly to the event in which he competes. Athletes of different body types compete suc- cessfully in different events. Certain of these body types or physiques may be recognized in certain kouroi. For in- stance, the Anavysos and Munich kouroi are obvious repre- sentations of discus or hammer throwers; Kritios, a short distance runner; and Aristodikos, a middle distance runner. The visual comparisons offer persuasive information on the ideal physical types used as models for specific kouroi as they simultaneously highlight proportional differences be- tween statues and real men. THE ANCIENT IMAGE AND NAISKOS OF ATHENA POLI- AS: THE RITUAL SETTING ON A LATE FIFTH-CEN- TURY ACROPOLIS RELIEF: Ira S. Mark, University of Chicago The ritual setting on a votive relief, long known in the collection of the Acropolis Museum, is seen to depict the Sanctuary of Athena Polias around 420 B.C., soon before construction of the Erechtheion. Mended from several frag- ments (0. Walter, Beschreibung der Reliefs im Kleinen Ak- ropolismuseum in Athen [Vienna 1923] no. 76), the relief shows left a standing cult image in a naiskos, seated near it the goddess Athena, and approaching from the right, more fragmentary, a line of worshippers. The iconography of the scene is largely traditional, fami- liar from vases and numerous other late fifth-century reliefs, with the exception only of the naiskos and statue, a rare ad- dition. Examination shows the statue to be an unusual ex- ample of early archaism, conversant with but independent of</page><page sequence="22">288 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 traditional pre-Alkamenean usages. It combines familiar archaisms, the polos and long pendent locks, with distinctive aspects of pose and dress. Intriguing in particular are the arms, held in a manner specific to such pre-Archaic cult statues as the Artemis of Ephesos and the Hera of Samos, elbows close to the body, forearms diagonally outward on a level. The relief figure departs from these early models in but one substantial respect. It holds attributes, an icono- graphic subtlety foreign to early cult statuary: a bird or fruit in the right hand, a phiale, more battered, in the left. The clothing of the figure is equally notable. Archaistic images are routinely clothed and draped in an antiquated fashion. The dress of the relief statue is distinctly contemporary. Of the two pre-Classical cult statues of Athena attested on the Acropolis, the olivewood image of Athena Polias and the image of Athena Nike, past scholarship has associated the relief rather with the second (L. Beschi, ASAtene 29-30 [1967-1968] 531-36). The recent discovery of the base for the cult statue of Athena Nike, however, shows that image to have been seated (I. Mark, XIIe Congres International d'Archeologie Classique, Athens 1983), ruling out the iden- tification, while there are new indications that the olivewood image stood (J. Kroll, Studies in Athenian Architecture, Sculpture, and Topography Presented to H.A. Thompson [Princeton 1982] 65-76). The association of the relief with the Polias cult, promising on such general criteria, finds confirmation in the attested appearance of the olivewood image, that it was dressed in real garments, and that its hands were reworked to hold attributes. The relief is a rare and important complement to the written sources on this re- nowned ancient image and, as well, confirms the modest na- ture of its Periclean setting. THE YOUTH IN THE GREAT ELEUSINIAN RELIEF: Kevin Clinton, Cornell University Recently scholars have found reason to doubt the tradi- tional identification of the youth in the Great Eleusinian Relief (now in the Athens National Museum) as Tripto- lemus. A. Raubitschek found this scene quite unlike any other Triptolemus scene. B. Ridgway rejected the identifica- tion with Triptolemus, because of the lack of a chariot and the boy's age and stature relative to Demeter and Kore; she proposed instead the Eleusinian pais aph' hestias. The youth's nakedness, however, militates against a mor- tal cult official; it suggests a divine figure. It is generally as- sumed that the hand gestures of Demeter and the boy some- how involve wheat stalks. The wheat and nakedness are at- tributes of the god Ploutos, son of Demeter. In Classical vase painting Ploutos appears as a boy and is always naked, often carrying a cornucopia; sometimes he has a wreath of grain in his hair. In one painting he stands between Demeter and Kore, next to a stalk of grain, and grain is emerging from his cornucopia. Examination of the remains of the boy's hand in the relief shows that he could have held a bronze cornucopia. Ploutos is not unknown to Eleusinian sculpture. On the Lacrateides relief a small boy, standing next to Demeter and holding stalks of grain, has to be, by a process of elimi- nation, the god Ploutos. He appears also on a relief with Demeter, Kore, and Eubouleus (ploutodotes) from the City Eleusinion. Ploutos is of the greatest significance to Eleusinian reli- gion, personifying agrarian regeneration and as child the eternal regeneration of the genos. A NEW INTERPRETATION OF THE ORPHEUS RELIEF: L.-A. Touchette, Princeton University; St. Hugh's College, Oxford The three-figure Orpheus relief represents the earliest extant artistic evidence of the myth of Orpheus and Eury- dice. At least seven Roman copies exist of the late fifth-cen- tury B.C. Greek original. Modern scholarship almost over- whelmingly ascribes to the scene the moment of the final separation of Orpheus and Eurydice as narrated in Virgil's Fourth Georgic. This later version of the tale of the famous musician and his beloved has colored modern interpretation of the iconography of the Orpheus relief-obscuring the in- tent of the Greek Classical original by overlaying it with a poetic vision of the Augustan age. A different interpretation is put forward here, based on a full analysis of the literary and artistic traditions of the Orpheus and Eurydice story dating from the fifth century B.C. to the fourth century A.C. Insight into the iconography of the scene is also gained through an examination of the gestures of the figures within their art historical context. From the first appearance of Orpheus and his beloved in Euripides' Alcestis, Orpheus' descent to the underworld to retrieve his lost spouse served as the archetypal myth of suc- cessful return in Greek literature. It is not until Virgil that the tragic second death of Eurydice appears. Not even the mastery of Virgil's passage, however, was capable of obliter- ating all memory of the successful version of the myth, which resurfaces in several later authors. The artistic evi- dence testifies as well to the potency of the earlier version with its happy ending of Orpheus' mission. There is a close association between representations of the tale of the two lovers and of other myths of descent and successful return. The gestures of the figures also support the interpretation of the three-figure Orpheus relief as a depiction of the reunion and rebirth of Orpheus and Eurydice, overseen by Hermes in his role as mediator between the worlds above and below. PEACOCKS AND TRYPHtE IN CLASSICAL ATHENS: Mar- garet C. Miller, McMaster University It is traditional to accept ancient speculation that the pea- cock came to the Greek world via Samos, where it was as- sociated with Hera (Menodotos ap. Ath. 14.655A). There is, however, no literary or archaeological evidence to support this belief. The earliest reference to peacocks in the Greek world relates specifically to the Athenian Pyrilampes, who went on "numerous" embassies to the Great King, and who showed peacocks from ca. 440 B.C. A gem in the British Museum, apparently the earliest representation of the pea- cock in Greek art, dates from the same period (Walters 554).</page><page sequence="23">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 289 References to the bird in the late fifth and fourth centuries suggest first that the peacock came to symbolize the kind of exotic gift that could be gained when on embassy to Persia, and that in Athens "pavoniculture" was suspiciously regard- ed as an elitist luxury. Depictions in Attic red figure vase- painting provide evidence for adoption by fashionable Athe- nians of other Oriental luxuries and even elements of life- style after the Persian Wars. Alongside these, the display of peacocks should take its place to testify to aristocratic eager- ness for Oriental tryphe. Appreciation of this tendency as reflected in this body of material can elucidate modern un- derstanding of the social and political implications of Athe- nian contact with the Achaemenid Empire. CERAMIC EVIDENCE FOR THE RELIGIOUS CHARACTER OF THE SANCTUARY OF POSEIDON ON THE ISTHMUS DURING THE ROMAN IMPERIAL PERIOD: Jeanne Marty, Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, excava- tions at scattered Roman sites along the Rhine in Germany, and in Austria and Hungary along the Danube, yielded examples of a terracotta vase type which has come to be as- sociated especially with the cult of Mithras. Although the style of these vases may differ considerably, the character- istic common to all is the presence of one or more applique' snakes in relief. In 1937, E. Swoboda (OJh 30 [1937] 1-27) made the first in-depth study of "Die Schlange in Mithras- kult," citing the examples known to him and establishing a typology which today is the basis for further study of the snake-vase. In the last 50 years several hundred new vases or vase fragments have been noted at sites across the Roman Empire from Britain to Egypt, including examples from the Sanctu- ary of Poseidon in the Isthmus of Corinth. When one exa- mines this broader corpus of snake-vases, their archaeolo- gical contexts, and the evidence for the dating, it becomes apparent that not all are Mithraic. This is almost certainly the case for those found in the Corinthia. This paper at- tempts to place the snake-entwined vases from Isthmia in the religious life of the Sanctuary during the Roman period through an examination of the archaeological context and of the relationship of the vessels in style and decoration to examples from other sites. SESSION III E: POSTER SESSION I APPLICATION OF XERORADIOGRAPHY TO THE STUDY OF BRONZE COINS: Giraud V. Foster and John Mac- Isaac, The Johns Hopkins University Studies were carried out to demonstrate the usefulness of xeroradiography in the identification of heavily corroded bronze coins. It was found that the method was best applied to coins 1-3 mm. thick. Details useful both in dating and identifying marks could be detected that might otherwise be lost during conservation. It is concluded that the method is a useful technique applicable to the study of excavated coins. AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF 150 YEARS OF HOUSTON COMMERCE: Roger G. Moore, Rice University The Diverse Works/Market Square Archaeological Pro- ject represents an important contribution to the increasingly significant body of data on the historical archaeology of American cities. The project examined an unbroken ar- chaeological record of the commercial growth of the City of Houston extending from its initial settlement in the months following Texas Independence in 1836 to the present day. The excavations took place within a preserved rear court- yard of several 19th-century buildings in the oldest portion of the Houston business district. The courtyard provided se- cure, undisturbed access to archaeological remains related to both these existing structures, and to the earlier Republic of Texas period, the formative years of the City. Excavation results provide insight into general urban site formation processes, and the living conditions, diet, and external trade connections of the earliest settlers. Materials such as Con- federate armaments recovered will answer questions re- garding known later functions and incidents in the history of the City. In addition to its substantive contributions, the excava- tion served to focus the attention of Houston citizens and local governmental officials on the presence of important, endangered archaeological resources in the City. The pro- ject functioned as a public awareness vehicle for the recently created Houston Archaeological and Historical Commission through a well-attended open house, and the excavation re- mained accessible to casual visitors throughout the field sea- son. It further marked another fruitful Texas collaboration between professional and avocational archaeologists, with both field and laboratory work conducted with the assistance of members of the Houston Archaeological Society. THE CONSERVATION AND PRESENTATION OF URBAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES: Thomas C. Roby, Univer- sity of York Archaeological sites are a finite cultural resource to which can be attributed all the preservation values more fre- quently used to characterize architectural and landscape re- sources. These values are artistic/aesthetic, historic/infor- mational, associative/symbolic, and economic/utilitarian. The past 30 years have witnessed an appalling rate of destruction of archaeological sites worldwide. The problem is most acute in cities where modern redevelopment with its deep foundation systems makes site conservation extremely difficult and expensive. Therefore, there is a need for im- proved planning and legislative protection to ensure that some material evidence of a city's history and underground urban fabric is preserved. The best way to conserve urban archaeological remains is</page><page sequence="24">290 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 not to excavate them. If this is impossible, special attention must be given to the preparation for the moment of excava- tion-the most critical time for the conservation of archaeo- logical materials. Conservation during excavation, or pre- ventive conservation, requires creating a microclimate for the site in order to minimize the deterioration of remains due to the environmental shock of going from a buried to uncovered state. Using the preservation values described above to evaluate an excavated site, certain sites will warrant conservation and presentation to the public after excavation. A variety of options are available for long-term site conservation. The best conservation option for the site is that which does not detract from or compromise the important values attributed to the site, nor detract from the existing urban setting. The decision to leave a site open to public viewing, rather than conserve by backfilling, brings with it the responsibility to interpret and present the site so that it is intelligible to the public. The essential principle of site interpretation is com- munication of the site's preservation values. Two examples of urban site conservation are discussed, one in London and one in Rome, to show the difficulties of successful urban site conservation, the problems to be avoid- ed, and the potential for enhancing our cities by conserving and presenting selected archaeological features and inte- grating them into the contemporary urban fabric. DOMESTIC DRINKING WATER SUPPLY AND WATER QUALITY CONTROL IN THE NEAR EAST FROM THE NEOLITHIC TO THE IRON AGE: Robert Miller, American Center of Oriental Research, Amman The importance to public health of providing households with access to good quality drinking water appears to have been recognized at an early date in ancient western Asia. Archaeological, historical, and epidemiological perspectives can be combined to reconstruct effective complementary strategies of limiting the incidence and severity of water- borne diseases. As appropriate technologies applied to water catchment and storage facilities were developed from ca. 7000-500 B.C., households were able to avoid, reduce, or eliminate pathogens from polluted water. Some communities from Early Neolithic times on used surface water supplies located at some distance from settle- ments as one way of obtaining water unpolluted by domestic wastes. The effectiveness of sediments in filtering out micro- bial pathogens may have been understood by the Halaf peri- od when permanent wells with a depth of 15 m. (which would meet recommended WHO standards) occur (cf. Wagner and Lanoix, Water Supply for Rural Areas and Small Communities [Geneva 1959]). Limiting wastewater backflow and seepage by constructing wellhead copings and well linings can be documented in Mesopotamia from ca. 2500-500 B.C. Shallow artificial reservoirs, known in the Levant from the late fourth millennium B.C. on, could have been cleared by aerobic and anaerobic processes during ponding, as long as fresh inputs of waste were avoided. Ex- posing polluted water to sunlight in reservoirs and shallow courtyard basins could also have taken advantage of the ability of solar ultraviolet radiation to eliminate pathogens within a few hours (Acra et al., Lancet 2 [1980] 1257-58). PIXE ANALYSIS AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL CERAMICS: F. Winter, E. Williams, G. Cadet, N. Guardala, E. Huang, Brooklyn College, City University of New York Proton-induced x-ray emission or PIXE analysis, a re- cently developed method for atomic component identifica- tion, has been conducted on archaeological ceramics by Brooklyn College of the City University of New York uti- lizing the college's Dynametron accelerator. The technique of PIXE analysis has proven itself to be an efficient and ac- curate method for the identification of trace and major com- ponent elements in ancient pottery. PIXE analysis has been used at Brooklyn College to ana- lyze ceramics from both the Old and New Worlds. Old World studies have focused on Hellenistic ceramics from the eastern Mediterranean region (cf. AJA 90 [1986] 185). New World samples have included kaolin pipes and 19th-century American red wares found in the New York metropolitan area. The process of PIXE analysis, from sample collection and preparation through the evaluation of the research data using computer-assisted cluster analysis programs, is repre- sented and demonstrated in the poster exhibit. It is hoped that this poster program will encourage the utilization of PIXE analysis as a complementary or alternative technique to the more commonly used, but more time-consuming and costly, method of neutron activation analysis. OUR WEALTH OF PALM-LEAF MANUSCRIPTS: K. Gun- da Jois, Keladi Museum In the history of India, Keladi, presently a small village in Karnataka state, was the capital of the Keladi kingdom dur- ing the Mediaeval period. In 1656, King 'Sriranga of Vijayanagar lost his kingdom and led a miserable life. At this critical hour, 'Sivappa Navaka of Keladi not only of- fered asylum to 'Sriranga but also gave him a part of his own kingdom to rule. Queen 'Cennammaji of Keladi gave shelter to Rajaram, the Maratha ruler against Aurangazeb, the Moghul Emperor of Delhi. In the war that ensued, Auran- gazebs' forces were defeated by 'Cennammaji. The area of Keladi comprised the present nine districts of Karnataka and Kerala. Its contribution to cultural develop- ment has been immense. The archaeological remains and literature in palm-leaf manuscripts left by these rulers are abundant. P. Della Valle, an Italian traveler in 1623, and P. Mundi, an English traveler in 1637, visited Keladi and not- ed the significance of the palm-leaf manuscripts from these regional states. The wealth of knowledge contained in the palm-leaf manuscripts is a boon to the nation. Many of these manuscripts are now in the Keladi Museum and are</page><page sequence="25">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 291 awaiting research. I have carefully studied them and have prepared a scientific catalogue. Efforts have been made to decipher the regional Vedic script Tigal4ri which existed in the rural parts of the country. THE HUMAYMA HYDRAULIC SURVEY: REPORT OF THE FIRST SEASON, 1986: Andrew N. Sherwood, Prince- ton University, and John P. Oleson, University of Victoria The first of three projected seasons of the Humayma Hy- draulic Survey took place in May and June 1986. Humay- ma, ancient Avara, was the major Nabataean habitation center in what is now Jordan's southern desert. This survey has as its objective the analysis of the character and evolu- tion of the water-supply system of Avara during the Naba- taean, Roman, and Byzantine periods, with careful consi- deration of both the technical and social ramifications. This will be the first integrated study of Nabataean skills in a technology critical to survival in a desert environment. In 1986, Avara's catchment area, 240 km.2 in size, was searched for hydraulic structures: four weeks of work yield- ed 51 cisterns, four springs, one aqueduct, one dam, two wa- di barriers, and six sites with terraces or cleared fields. The aqueduct, 27 km. in length, is by far the longest such Naba- taean structure known and among the longest in the entire ancient Near East. The dam and some of the cisterns are virtually undamaged. The character and distribution of these structures provide new evidence for the social and eco- nomic organization of a Nabataean desert community. The 1987 campaign will concentrate on excavation of cisterns, reservoirs, and water channels within the settlement. THE GREEK TRIREME PROJECT: A PROGRESS REPORT: N.B.

SESSION IV A: COLLOQUIUM: ROME AND INDIA: THE SEA TRADE ANCIENT NAVAL TECHNOLOGY AND THE ROUTE TO INDIA: Lionel Casson, New York University Rome's trade with India was made possible by the behav- ior of the prevailing winds over the waters concerned, the so- called monsoon winds. During the summer, these winds blow from the southwest and during the winter from the northeast. This meant that Rome's shipping was assured of a favorable wind on both legs, outbound in summer and homeward at any other time. Although the northeast monsoon is mild and pleasant, the southwest is just the opposite, frequently rising to gale force. Arab lateeners, which can make some headway against un- favorable winds, crowd both legs into the period of the mild northeast monsoon. Ancient square-riggers, able to sail only before the wind, had no such option. What made sailing with the violent southwest monsoon possible for them was the very special way in which Graeco- Roman shipwrights constructed a ship. They did not nail a skin of planking to a skeleton of keel and frames (ribs) in the fashion that has been current in Europe and America for centuries. What they did was to create a shell of planks with each plank made fast to its neighbors by mortise and tenon joints set cheek by jowl; it was more cabinet work than car- pentry. Then, into this tightly fastened shell, they inserted a full set of frames. The result was a hull of massive strength, one that could easily stand up to the rigors of the southwest monsoon. Moreover, the standard rig, consisting chiefly of a wide mainsail as driver, was extremely conservative, well suited to meet the hard blows of the southwest monsoon with minimum risk. PORTS OF THE RED SEA AND THE INDIA TRADE: Steven E. Sidebotham, University of Delaware Commercial contact between the Mediterranean basin and India existed, indirectly, long before the advent of the Ptolemies, Nabataeans, and Romans, but it was these latter governments, especially the Roman, which promoted mari- time commerce with the Indian subcontinent. In order to facilitate this trade, the Ptolemaic, Nabataean, and Roman governments founded and/or enlarged ports on both coasts of the Red Sea as far south as the Bab el Mandeb (entrance to the Indian Ocean). This paper concentrates on those ports located in Egypt. The six major Egyptian Red Sea ports active in the Ptole- maic-Roman period were, from north to south: 1) Clysma- Cleopatris-Arsinoc, 2) Myos Hormos, 3) Philoteras, 4) Leukos Limen, 5) Nechesia, and 6) Berenice. Archaeologi- cal investigations at some of these ports (and the roads and canals connecting them to the Nile), combined with accounts in ostraca, inscriptions and ancient authors (e.g., Agathar- chides [in Diodorus Siculus], Artemidorus [in Strabo], Stra- bo, Pliny the Elder, the Periplus Maris Erythraei and Clau- dius Ptolemy), reveal a great deal about this commerce. We learn, among other things, about the types of goods traded, the "nationality" and social status of the entrepreneurs and the various methods by which the governments facilitated and profited from the trade. All the evidence studied in its entirety reveals something about the political-economic- military policies of these states vis-fi-vis this commerce. It is evident that a study of this trade and the government policies which promoted it leaves many intriguing, unan- swered questions which only additional archaeological in- vestigations can hope to answer. RED POLISHED WARE IN WESTERN INDIA: Nancy Pin- to Orton, University of Pennsylvania</page><page sequence="26">292 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 In this paper I discuss the distribution of Red Polished Ware (RPW) and associated wares in the state of Gujarat. RPW has been considered an Indian imitation of the highly polished, finely levigated table ware of Rome known as Ar- retine. The appearance of Arretine Ware and RPW in In- dia dates to the first century A.C., at a time of trading activ- ity between the two regions of the world. I argue that RPW is not a direct imitation of the Arretine Ware but is of local origin. I suggest that RPW is part of a broader Middle Eastern tradition of highly polished, finely levigated red ce- ramics. The suggestion is based on evidence of Ring Ware from sites in Pakistan, the appearance of fine, red polished ceramics at other sites in the Middle East dating to this pe- riod, evidence within India itself, and references in Classical literature concerning the origin of Arretine Ware. In South India at this time we find the Chola, Pandya, and Chera kingdoms. Each of their inland capitals had a port for the export and import of goods. Other major cap- itals also had control of coastal areas with a major port, most notably Rome and Ostia. If one considers the political situation in Gujarat, in which we find sequential domi- nance by the Parthians, Indo-Parthians, and Western Kshatrapas, one might ask if a similar administrative model holds during the Early Historical period. One would expect to find symbols of power and influence in the local popula- tions. I hypothesized that similar pottery industries would be found in inland cities and coastal ports under their influ- ence. Based on the study of the distribution of the Early Historical pottery I examined in Gujarat, it appears that Gujarat did not have any centralized governments control- ling port cities, in spite of plentiful ports on its local coast- line. Contemporary maritime communities in Gujarat con- tinue to exhibit a highly independent stance in their social and economic organization. ROMAN TRADE: RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL Discov- ERIES IN WESTERN INDIA: S.B. Deo, Deccan College Postgraduate and Research Institute During the last few decades quite a variety of Roman ob- jects, usually small luxury items, has been recovered in the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, and allied re- gions. The imports were transported to the interior regions along well-established trade routes connecting the ports of western India with inland emporia like Ter, Junnar, Neva- sa, Paithan, and Nasik, and also other centers outside west- ern India such as Besnagar, Kanchipuram, Dharanikota, and Tripuri. The imports from the Roman world consist of pottery, glass, bronzes, gold and silver coins, carved semi-precious stones, etc. Of special interest are amphora fragments re- ported from several sites in Maharashtra and Gujarat, and a few in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Although Roman coins had been found previously, recent finds at Adam, Kun- davelli, and Vadgaon Madhavpur deserve special mention. In spite of these reported finds, there is as yet no clarity re- garding the magnitude of the trade, nor is there firm identi- fication of objects and local imitations of pottery like "Me- garian" bowls and Red Polished Ware. Due to trade con- tacts with the Roman world and settlements of yavanas in western India mentioned in epigraphical and literary sources, Indian craftsmen were inspired to imitate Roman pottery, coins, and terracottas. The paper discusses in detail both imports and imitations found at major sites like Ter and Nasik and evaluates their significance. THE ROMAN BRONZES FROM KOLHAPUR: Richard Daniel De Puma, University of Iowa This paper examines a group of ancient Roman bronzes excavated at Kolhapur in southwestern India. As early as the fourth century B.C., the West had established regular contacts with India. By Roman Imperial times these con- tacts had developed into a systematic commerce. Ancient ac- counts, especially the Periplus Maris Erythraei, document this trade with descriptions of sea routes, ports, and products exchanged. Quantities of Roman coins and pottery found in India further illuminate the situation. Thus far, relatively few Roman bronzes have been recovered. The ancient inland site at Kolhapur is not mentioned in the Periplus but this is not surprising since that guide con- centrates on coastal trading sites. Kolhapur may be identi- cal to ancient Hippokoura, the inland capital of Baleokou- ros, mentioned by Ptolemy. Among the Roman export items listed in the Periplus for this region are bronze vessels. A major cache of imported bronzes was excavated at Kolha- pur in 1945 by K. Kundangar. It was briefly published by K. Khandalavala in Lalit Kala 7 (1960) 56-62. Although other authors have illustrated some of the objects or sum- marized Khandalavala's opinions, his 1960 article remains the only treatment of this important body of Roman mate- rial in India. This paper offers a critical re-examination of the Kolha- pur bronzes from the point of view of a Classical archaeolo- gist familiar with the Roman material. Several pieces Khan- dalavala thought were indigenous products are actually Ro- man; misinterpretations of the functions of certain pieces are corrected; vague dates and possible provenances are clarified in the light of recent discoveries and scholarship. Most of the objects date to the first half of the first century A.C. and were probably manufactured in Campania rather than Alexandria, as originally proposed. The Kolhapur cache demonstrates that fine South Italian metalwork, shipped via Alexandria, found its way to the East where Roman mer- chant seamen exchanged it for India's precious but perish- able goods, TERRA SIGILLATA FROM ARIKAMEDU: Howard Com- fort, Haverford College This paper deals with the terra sigillata found at Arika- medu by Faucheux, Wheeler, and Casal prior to 1949, and</page><page sequence="27">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 293 with the commentary of Ohlenroth, and with the parallel site of Timna' in South Arabia. The date assigned by Wheeler for Arikamedu Arretine (Ancient India 2 [1946] 35) is A.D. 20-50; Ohlenroth (Germania 30 [1952] 389-92) pushes this back to a floruit of A.D. 9/16. Using somewhat different evidence, the present paper proposes A.D. 10-30. Potters' stamps are Vibi/Vibieni, Camuri, Atti retrograde, all in rectangles, and Evhodi in planta pedis. Two "marbled" sherds, on present evidence, may be either South Gaulish with implications for a later dating, or classic Arretine. Two fragments of Eastern Sigillata B are also considered. It is suggested that the users of sigillata at Arikamedu, Silchester, and Colchester were Romanized businessmen rather than local nobility. Finally, possible Mediterranean influence on native Tamil pottery is re- served for future investigation. THE ROMAN SHIPPING AMPHORAS FROM ARIKAMEDU: Elizabeth Lyding Will, University of Massachu- setts, Amherst Excavations at Arikamedu by Faucheux and others in 1943-1944, by Wheeler in 1945, and by Casal in 1947- 1950 uncovered several hundred fragments of Roman ship- ping amphoras. Photographs and drawings of some 100 fragments have been studied. About half of those pieces come from Coan-type wine amphoras produced chiefly in Campania (Dressel's Forms 3 and 4, Will Type 12a). The importation of wine occurred as early as the first half of the first century B.C. and continued during the first century A.C. Similar finds are also known from other Indian sites. In addition to wine, Arikamedu imported other Mediterra- nean products. In the early Imperial period, olive oil jars arrived from the northern Adriatic area (Dressel Form 6, Will Type 14), and garum amphoras were imported from Spain (Dressel Forms 7 and 8, Will Type 16). The am- phora finds thus reflect approximately two centuries of com- mercial contact between Arikamedu and the Roman world. ROME AND SOUTH INDIA: RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDS: K. V. Raman, University of Madras Commercial contact between Rome and South India, es- pecially the coastal area of the peninsula, is fairly well at- tested by archaeological and literary sources, but the extent of Roman influence in the interior, particularly the capitals of South Indian kingdoms, is not yet clear. This paper fo- cuses primarily on inland sites in the light of recent archaeo- logical discoveries and Tamil literary references. Although imported Arretine Ware and amphoras are found at a few sites only, Arikamedu type of Rouletted Ware is now known from several sites. The coastal sites are Vasavasamudram, Nattamedu (Karaikadu), Kaveripatti- nam, and Alangulam. The inland sites are Uraiyur, Karur, Kanchipuram, Appukallu, Adamankottai, and Kodumanal. The presence of Rouletted Ware and imports on the coast and at the capitals is understandable, but the occurrence of Rouletted Ware at Kodumanal and Appukallu calls for a discussion on the impact of the trade in the interior villages. The paper discusses the importance of these sites in the con- text of the natural and mineral resources of the region and the political and commercial interests of its rulers. At Kanchipuram a large number of piriform jars, simi- lar to those at Arikamedu and Vasavasamudram, presum- ably modeled on the Mediterranean amphoras, have been found. In addition, there are two pedestal cups (bowls) which also seem to be Western in form. The importance of these is analyzed. CERAMIC EVIDENCE FOR PRE-PERIPLUS TRADE ON THE INDIAN COASTS: Vimala Begley, University Museum, University of Pennsylvania This paper hypothesizes that up to the middle of the first century A.C., before the time to which the Periplus is cur- rently dated, there was no direct trade between the Gujarat- Maharashtra coast and the Coromandel. Furthermore, al- though both coasts received Mediterranean imports, the ce- ramics brought to the two regions were quite different, and arrived at different times. These conclusions are based upon comparison of the pottery from western and southeastern India, especially the "Megarian-like" sherds of fine red ware in the west and the "rouletted" and related gray wares of the southeast. The "Megarian-like" red ware of western India is found at several sites like Nevasa, Kondapur, and Ter, but it is still uncertain where and when it was first made. At Nevasa, however, it seems to date from approximately the early first century A.C. In shape, technique of decoration, and some floral motifs, it resembles Hellenistic-Roman moldmade bowls, some of which must have arrived in western India by the beginning of the first century A.C. In the southeast, en- tirely different techniques of decoration appear, the most well known of which is rouletting or chattering on the base of a dish, commonly known as the Rouletted Ware. This type of decoration was widely prevalent in the Classical world, from where it must have been introduced into south- eastern India in the second or early first century B.C.-the approximate time for the first occurrence of Rouletted Ware at Arikamedu. How are we to account for this dissimilarity in imported ceramic types on the two Indian coasts? The Periplus im- plies that different cargoes were shipped to the upper west- ern coast and the far south. If this pattern existed earlier also, perhaps different Mediterranean ceramic types were exported to the two coasts at different times. Since the ear- lier southeastern types do not occur on the western coast, nor the later western types on the southeastern coast, it seems probable that neither coast traded directly with the other, despite the fact that both carried on overseas trade with the Classical world. THE PORT OF MANTAI, SRI LANKA: John Carswell, The University of Chicago</page><page sequence="28">294 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 The importance of the port of Mantai is primarily in its location at the southeastern extremity of Adam's Bridge, a string of underwater reefs linking the island of Sri Lanka with the mainland. Long-distance shipping could reach only one side or other of Adam's Bridge, and this led to the devel- opment of Mantai as an emporium for goods from both east and west. Of additional significance is its location in the arid zone of the island, for it largely escapes the devastating, eroding effects of both annual monsoons. A further factor which may have been of some importance was the existence of the pearl banks near by in the Gulf of Mannar. Three seasons of excavation (1980, 1982, 1984) have re- vealed much about the outline of the site's history, and indi- cated the importance of Mantai as an international empo- rium for maritime trade. Although first occupied by a pre- historic settlement in ca. 1750 B.C., the continuous occupa- tion of the site begins in the fifth century B.C. and continues to the end of the 10th century A.C., when the Chola con- quest of northern Sri Lanka terminated the importance of Mantai as a great trading city. Although our work at the site has been mostly in the up- per levels, some earlier finds include part of a shoulder of an Indian water-sprinkler of imitation terra sigillata polished red ware, impressed with a scene of a monkey on a crocodile, and a Brahmi inscription. While stray sherds of Rouletted Ware paralleled at Arikamedu have been recovered from the site, none are from stratified contexts. Their presence is not surprising, however, for Rouletted Ware has been found at Kantarodai in the Jaffna peninsula. R. Silva and J. Bou- zek (Antiquity 59 [1985] 46-47) report the discovery of si- gillata and Roman glass at Mantai as surface finds. If Ro- man imports are encountered in our ongoing excavations, they would be significant not only for tracing Rome's trade with Sri Lanka but also for routing of the trade to the south- eastern coast of India. SESSION IV B: AEGEAN ARCHAEOLOGY I EARLY AND MIDDLE CYPRIOT TERRACOTTA FIGU- RINES: THE ALAMBRA EVIDENCE: Marcia K. Moge- lonsky, Cornell University Cypriot terracotta figurines have been notoriously diffi- cult to date, due to the paucity of examples from stratified settlement contexts. The majority of examples come instead from tombs, many of which contain multiple burials, so that specific associations between grave goods are often obscure. Other burials have been disturbed by groundwater action to the extent that the objects have "floated" to different loca- tions in the deposit. The reliability of even single-burial tombs as chronological indicators for settlement material has also been questioned. Promising new material, however, comes from the Cornell University excavation of the Early- Middle Cypriot settlement of Alambra-Mouttes. Alambra has yielded 13 figurine fragments, seven of which come from securely stratified deposits. More than half of these are of the class known as Red Polished plank-shaped figurines, which had been dated stylistically either to Early Cypriot III or more generally to Early Cypriot III-Middle Cypriot II. The evidence provided by Alambra allows a more specif- ic date to be assigned to this group of terracottas than had been possible previously. The Alambra material, excavated between 1978 and 1982 by a Cornell University team under the direction of J.E. Coleman, is currently housed in the Cyprus Museum, Nicosia. LIFE AFTER DEATH: NEW LIGHT ON THE CEMETERY AT KEPHALA, GREECE: Lauren E. Talalay, Univer- sity of Michigan While recent research in prehistoric archaeology has demonstrated that systematic analysis of burial practices has great potential for elucidating socioeconomic organization, little attention has been given to that kind of study in Neo- lithic Greece. Using current archaeological theory, this pa- per presents a new interpretation of the unusual, and as yet unexplained, burial patterns at Kephala, a small Final Neo- lithic site on the island of Keos. Kephala represents one of the rare occasions in the Greek Neolithic where the deceased are disposed in discrete, for- mal areas apart from domestic living quarters, and the only example where anthropomorphic figurines are placed in as- sociation with the dead. Anthropological investigations sug- gest that corporate groups (e.g., villages, clans) build formal cemeteries not only as an expression of local unity, but also as a way to claim scarce and crucial resources which are located close to the burial site. Local control over valued re- sources is legitimized by chartering claims to ancestral own- ership of the area, and such claims are rendered explicit by the permanent existence of a burial site. Furthermore, the ethnographic record reveals that figurines placed in and around burials often act as "ancestor images" which mark ongoing ties between the living and the dead. In light of those observations, it is suggested that the evi- dence from Kephala signals a major shift in the organiza- tional and ideational concerns of Neolithic society, which carry over into the Early Cycladic cultures of the Bronze Age. Kephala may well represent the first instance in Greece where a collective group, linked by descent, attempts to legitimize its claims to valued resources through the crea- tion of a small but quite visible cemetery. KNOssOS IN CONTEXT: COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVES ON THE LINEAR B ADMINISTRATION OF LM II-III CRETE: John Bennet, University of Wisconsin- Madison Research on the LM II-III administration of Crete has shown that Knossos was most probably the sole administra- tive center at the time of the Linear B documents, and that it dealt with a number of regions in central and western Crete which corresponded closely to the territories of major LM I sites (cf. AJA 89 [1985] 231-49).</page><page sequence="29">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 295 This paper puts this reconstruction in context by review- ing general trends in administrations operating in Crete during three other periods: the Palatial, Classical-Roman, and Venetian periods. Parallels are drawn between these systems and that attested for LM II-III Crete. The advan- tage of employing such data lies in the fact that the systems compared all operated within the same environmental con- straints, and therefore the parallels drawn have more ex- planatory power than simple formal analogies without con- textual control. Two broad conclusions emerge. Firstly, there is no natu- ral single center in Crete. In periods when a single center has existed (Roman, Venetian), it has been imposed from outside. This observation may imply that Knossos' status was externally imposed, or may simply suggest that its posi- tion was inherently unstable. Secondly, the "natural" divisions of Crete are based on topographically defined regions of varying size. When the island was autonomous, there tended to be a number of such divisions forming the upper level in the administrative hier- archy (the palaces, the city states). In periods when Crete formed part of a larger, off-island system, these same broad units were incorporated at a lower level in the administra- tive hierarchy (Roman, Venetian). Knossos seems to have conformed to this pattern in the LM II-III period, modify- ing the existing LM I administration by incorporating units which already existed then within its administrative organi- zation, but at a lower level. QUEEN NOFRETARI'S CRETO-MYCENAEAN EARRINGS: Robert B. Koehl, Florida State University The tomb of Queen Nofretari, first chief wife of Rameses II, has received the attention of Egyptologists largely due to its remarkably well preserved painted plaster reliefs, pub- lished in G. Thausig and H. Goedicke, Nofretari, A Docu- mentation of her Tomb and its Decoration (Graz 1971). The present study seeks to identify an item of Nofretari's apparel hitherto incorrectly interpreted as evidence for royal gift ex- change between the Aegean and Egypt during the 13th cen- tury B.C. Nofretari is depicted 24 times, either in the act of divine adoration, offering to one or several gods, or in an embrace with a deity. In each of the scenes her costume hardly changes. She wears a diaphanous white garment belted at the waist, a black and white bracelet on each wrist, and a wide, gold, jeweled collar. On her head she wears a gold-colored vulture crown which is sometimes surmounted by two vertical feathers. The only items which noticeably vary are her earrings. In several scenes she wears an earring in the form of a white-painted serpent whose tail hangs down behind her earlobe. More often she wears an earring which several scholars have hesitantly called a papyrus umbel (e.g., C. Aldred, The Jewels of the Pharaohs [1971] 127). In comparing the representations with actual exam- ples, however, this identification is clearly unsatisfactory. Rather, I propose that a much closer comparison could be made with a type of Creto-Mycenaean gold bead in the form of a bivalve shell, Furumark motif 25. Necklaces strung with this type of bead have been found in wealthy tombs on Crete and the mainland, dating to the later 14th and 13th centuries. The earrings that Nofretari wears may have been specially adapted from the bead form and made not from gold but from silver, as their white color suggests. Silver, a precious metal native to the Aegean but rare in Egypt, might have increased their significance and value. That earrings in general were highly regarded by the queen is suggested by the varied representations and that the bivalve earrings were significant is underscored by their frequency. The means by which Nofretari could have acquired the earrings can only be surmised. Figures identified as people from the Aegean, carrying precious vessels, appear on Egyp- tian tomb paintings during the 18th Dynasty. Actual mate- rial evidence for exchange between Egypt and the Aegean comes in the form of humbler material-pottery and faience scarabs. This form of material exchange continued into the 20th Dynasty. If the bivalve shell earrings that Nofretari appears to be wearing were the gifts of a high-ranking or royal Creto-Mycenaean, then we might point to these as evi- dence for the continuation or renewal of a long tradition of Egyptian-Aegean royal gift exchange. MARKETS AS A SECONDARY MEANS OF EXCHANGE IN THE KINGDOM OF PYLOS: Holly Morris, University of Minnesota This paper explores the existence or potential existence of markets as a secondary means of distributing goods and services within the Mycenaean kingdom of Pylos in the Late Bronze Age. Despite a growing interest among Aegean pre- historians in economic questions, the role of markets re- mains a relatively unexplored facet of research. A few rea- sons for the lack of attention are: 1) the difficulty in finding explicit indicators of markets, 2) a pervasive anti-market mentality among scholars, and 3) the convincing picture of redistribution reflected in the Linear B tablets. It is important to distinguish between market systems and peripheral markets. A market system is a modern insti- tution through which all goods and services are distributed and where the forces of supply and demand operate to set prices and production levels. Peripheral markets operate along with one or more additional modes of exchange (reci- procity or redistribution) and may distribute only a small percentage of the total goods. Supply and demand may play a role in setting prices in peripheral markets, but other fac- tors, such as societal norms, the chief's desires, etc., often determine prices. Although a market system is not expected for the Aegean Bronze Age, peripheral markets are possible and perhaps even likely. Because the peripheral market is a distinct institution, it may be visible archaeologically. The author attempted to isolate in the archaeological and Linear B evidence indicators for such peripheral markets in the Pylian kingdom. One indicator is the lack of central stor- age areas at the habitation site of Nichoria, an important town in the kingdom. The presence of central storage facili- ties is often cited as an indicator of town-organized redistri- bution, while the lack of such facilities suggests the possibil-</page><page sequence="30">296 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 ity of alternative means for local exchange. Although the in- dicators presented in the paper do not establish with certain- ty the existence of markets, they suggest that we may need to reconsider the common view of redistribution as the only significant means of distributing surplus within the Pylian kingdom. FRESCOES FROM THE THRONE ROOM AT PYLOS: A NEW INTERPRETATION: Lucinda R. McCallum, University of Pennsylvania The Pylos frescoes provide a unique opportunity to study the decorative program within a Mycenaean palace, for they constitute the best-documented corpus of Bronze Age wall paintings from the Greek mainland. This paper presents a reconstruction of the frescoes from the Throne Rooms's northeast wall, coupled with an analysis of their icono- graphy within a royal context. The reconstruction incorpo- rates several unpublished fragments, and builds upon Lang's work in The Palace of Nestor II (Princeton 1969). The northeast wall flanked the throne and was decorated with two figural groups. A griffin and lion guarded the throne's left side, but no evidence supports the popular re- construction of antithetic animals (Mirie, Das Thronraum- areal des Palkistes von Knossos [Bonn 1979] 47-49). The wall's far right section was decorated with a bull sacrifice and banquet scene with lyre player, an integrated group that was complemented by the procession fresco with bull in the adjacent vestibule. These three activities of procession, sac- rifice, and banquet probably represented highlights of a ma- jor festival, similar to those known from later Greek tradi- tion. Their interrelation is evidenced by a Pylos sealing showing a procession with lyre player moving toward an en- throned figure (CMS I, no. 361). The temporal festival scenes and supernatural guardians from the northeast wall were apparently linked by the fan- tastic bird flying from the lyre player toward the griffin. The entire wall communicated a message of political stability. The festival assured continuity of an important celebration, and the lion and griffin provided symbolic protection for the enthroned wanax of Pylos. A MYCENAEAN ORIGIN FOR THE ARGIVE GEOMETRIC HORSE-LEADER: Susan Langdon, University of Texas at Arlington The most characteristic motif of Argive Geometric vase painting, the so-called "horse-leader" figure, has given rise to various interpretations in attempts to elucidate the nature of Geometric iconography. The motif varies little from a set pattern. The male figure holds the muzzle of one or two horses, with a large fish poised beneath the horse's belly. Recent scholarship has dispensed with earlier interpreta- tions of the figure as a deity in favor of a more mundane reference to the generic Argive citizen, the horse signifying important social and economic status. Despite sound arguments in support of this secular inter- pretation, the present reconsideration of the horse-leader's identity is generated by evidence for the origin of the motif offered by two Mycenaean pictorial kraters excavated in the 1960s in the North Syrian city of Ugarit. Two panels on one krater assemble a man with horses and fish in a scene bear- ing striking resemblance to the Late Geometric Argive theme. A surprising religious dimension is added by a sec- ond krater fragment, in which the same figure stands beside an altar, holding a large fish in an apparent act of offering. Although shape, clay analysis, and painting style indicate Mycenaean manufacture, neither scene is paralleled in known Mycenaean figural art. Examination of Bronze Age artistic and religious evidence suggests an expansion of My- cenaean iconography in this late phase under the influence of the Eastern Mediterranean with its longstanding tradi- tions of cult and deity representation. It is necessary to con- sider that the transmission of the horse-leader to Argive Geometric painting may have retained elements of the reli- gious context in which it originally coalesced. EVIDENCE OF "CULTURAL EXCHANGE" IN GEOMETRIC ARCADIA: Mary E. Voyatzis, University of Arizona Votive objects found at Geometric sanctuary sites in Ar- cadia display a variety of regional influences and exchanges. The bronzes, particularly those found in eastern Arcadia, illustrate a degree of regional exchange not previously con- sidered. An examination indicates that bronze votives of Ar- give, Laconian, and Corinthian schools were being imported to and imitated in Arcadia. It also shows that distinctive types of bronze votives were created in eastern Arcadia and spread to other Peloponnesian sites. Most striking, however, is the evidence of bronzes of northern style in this region. Sanctuary sites at Tegea and Mavriki in eastern Arcadia have yielded locally produced northern-style bronzes which have no parallels in the rest of the Peloponnese (I. Kilian- Dirlmeier, Anhiinger in Griechenland von der mykenischen bis zur spiitgeometrischen Zeit [Munich 1979] 86, 116). Bronzes of northern style found at other Peloponnesian sites, such as Olympia and Perachora, are believed to have been made in a workshop based in Corinth (J. Bouzek, Graeco-Macedonian Bronzes: Analysis and Chronology [Prague 1974] 178) and are, for the most part, very different from those found in eastern Arcadia. At Gortsouli, just north of Tegea, an unpublished northern-style bronze sphere was recently found, confirming the pattern already established by the finds from Tegea and Mavriki. The abundance and variety of Macedonian/Thessalian-style bronzes found at Tegea, together with the unusual pieces found at Mavriki and Gortsouli, suggest that a second bronze-producing center with northern affinities existed in the Peloponnese and was situated in the vicinity of Tegea. Based on this fresh examination, it becomes apparent that this region, and Tegea in particular, actively contributed to the development of Geometric bronze production in the Peloponnese.</page><page sequence="31">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 297 THE MYCENAEAN TOMBS OF THE ARGOLID AND GEO- METRIC "HERO CULT": Carla M. Antonaccio, Princeton University The Argolid serves as a test case in a study of the phenom- enon at Mycenaean tombs usually defined as "hero cult" and considered characteristic of the Late Geometric period in many areas of Greece (N. Coldstream, JHS96 [1976] 8-17). This region was chosen because of the concentration of Late Bronze Age sites which are well explored, with information on succeeding chronological phases also available. It is argued that the prominence accorded to heroes' tombs and bones, so prevalent in ancient literature, is characteristic of the Archaic and later periods, not earlier. A summary of evidence from chamber and tholos tombs at seven sites is presented, including material not previously discussed in the scholarship. Re-evaluation of the known data is called for: deliberate deposits of votive material are relatively infrequent, as some examples commonly cited are clearly intrusions; attention is drawn to instances of funerary reuse of Mycenaean tombs. Intrusions, burials, and deposits from the immediate post-Bronze Age through the Protogeo- metric, Early, Middle, and Late Geometric periods demon- strate that Mycenaean tombs were not suddenly rediscov- ered and recognized only in the Late Geometric period, but known and frequented for a variety of purposes throughout antiquity. The Late Geometric deposits should be seen in a general funerary, rather than cultic context, perhaps repre- senting an effort to claim an ancestral link. Funeral feasts and offerings in contemporary Late Geometric cemeteries are part of the relevant evidence, as is the reuse of graves, indicating a concern with familial connections. Support for this standpoint is gained from the observation that identifiable Late Geometric hero shrines in the Argolid and elsewhere were not founded at Bronze Age tombs, though suitable candidates were available. The emphasis on heroes' relics, attested by archaeology and literature, is a fea- ture of the early Archaic age rather than the Late Geometric. A PHOENICIAN SHRINE AT KOMMOS: Joseph W. Shaw, University of Toronto A small, tri-pillar structure was found set on the floor of the Geometric/Archaic temple at Kommos, in south-central Crete. The four-sided, tapering stone pillars were socketed into rectangular mortises cut into a stone base placed cen- trally toward the western end of the cella. Between the pil- lars were a bronze horse figurine and Egyptian faience figu- rines. Nearby were other votive gifts. One of the basic issues in our understanding of the char- acter of the temple is the question of who was worshipped, a matter in which the role of the structure is crucial. The three pillars might reflect local custom, indicating a trinity such as that of Apollo, Leto, and Artemis. The lack of the anthro- pomorphic figurines that can reasonably be expected among the offerings, however, suggests aniconic worship, a custom not reported elsewhere in Crete. Structurally, the closest known parallels to the Kommos shrine are to be found outside Crete in the Phoenician/Pu- nic realm, in numerous reliefs, but also in freestanding shrines. The visual resemblance may not be fortuitous. Kommos's position at a likely stop-over point between the Phoenician homeland and its western colonies, and the ap- pearance of Phoenician artifacts elsewhere in Crete during a time that coincides with the lifespan of the temple strongly suggest that the tri-pillar structure was set up by Phoeni- cians or under strong Phoenician influence. The attribution is supported by the presence at Kommos of numerous frag- ments of large Phoenician transport amphoras and other vessels. SESSION IV C: JOINT SESSION OF THE AMERICAN PHILOLOGICAL ASSOCIA- TION AND THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTI- TUTE OF AMERICA LOST EPISODES IN AUGUSTAN HISTORY: THE EVI- DENCE OF THE BOSCOREALE CUPS AND THE ARA PA- CIs: Ann Kuttner, University of California, Berke- ley The two Augustan skyphoi called the Boscoreale Cups have four figured panels: Allegory of Augustus's world rule; Drusus brings Augustus a Gallic legation; Tiberius's tri- umph in 7 B.C.; Tiberius's votive sacrifice as imperator. I discuss the Drusus panel, which narrates an event that has dropped out completely from the surviving textual record, although widely advertised in its time. This new event and its Augustan depiction on the cups and in the official arts illuminate the practice and theory of Augustan imperialism and succession policy. On the cup, the young general Drusus sponsors a delega- tion of chieftains of Gallia Comata presenting to Augustus their children, who greet Augustus happily. In state coinage, the 8/7 B.C. Lugdunum series issued for Tiberius's tri- umph abbreviates this scene; the series celebrated Drusus's and Tiberius's feats in North Europe through 8 B.C. In the state monuments of Rome, one of the Boscoreale children is incorporated in the North procession frieze of the Ara Pacis. The Ara, dedicated in 9 B.C., was voted in 13 on Augustus's return from Gaul and Spain, when he left Drusus as legate over the tres Galliae to organize Gaul's first full census and to enroll its tribal elites in a cult to Augustus and Roma at Lugdunum. In 10 B.C. Augustus joined Drusus to inaugu- rate the cult; the Boscoreale scene must take place in connec- tion with this visit. (Its Gauls may be Aedui, prominent in both the imperial projects described.) The Boscoreale child "hostages" in fact are, and are shown to be, free and honored guests, transferred to the pa- tria potestas of Augustus to be educated as pro-Roman lead- ers. This Augustan practice is fully documented for the East; it is no surprise that on the Ara Pacis the Boscoreale</page><page sequence="32">298 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 child is directly opposite an Eastern prince on the South frieze following Agrippa, having accompanied Agrippa in 13 B.C. from Pontos and the Bosphoros. These children, then, symbolize Augustus's pacification of East and West through his agents Drusus and Agrippa; they locate in "reality" the message of the frieze of ethnic personifications on the Ara Pacis's inner altar, just as the Drusus panel does for the submission of a group of personifications led by Gaul on the other side of the cup. These documents of an Augustan theory of benevolent imperialism also shed new light on Augustus's aims in the Western provinces. Just as the Lugdunum cult was imposed to replicate "spontaneous" Eastern practices like the cult of the Communis Asiae, so this cup shows that Gallic leaders were encouraged to imitate a practice of Hellenistic rulers initiated in the Republic and amplified under Augustus. Fi- nally, we have more evidence for the way in which Augustus gave scope to and publicity for the virtus of his actual and potential co-rulers, documenting the hopes placed on the Claudii Nerones before Drusus's premature death in 9 B.C. and Tiberius's mysterious exile in 4 B.C. TIME, NARRATIVITY, AND DYNASTIC CONSTRUCTS IN AUGUSTAN ART AND THOUGHT: John Pollini, The Johns Hopkins University In a recent study, R. Brilliant has shown that in Roman narrative art, which often tends to abstract time and event, the observer must become more than simply a decoder of a message. He must in a sense become the narrator, supplying the narrative connectives between and among discrete images which have been brought into association with one another. Though perhaps differing in subject matter, indi- vidual images may be thematically or conceptually related in some way, thereby forming what Brilliant calls a "narrative of the interior." The establishment in this way of narrative links between different subjects is structurally similar to Ovid's narrative technique in the Metamorphoses. In the Augustan age, the seminal period in the development of Im- perial art and ideology, two important artistic creations that convey official messages in a manner analogous to a narra- tive of the interior are the Ara Pacis and the statuary pro- gram of the Forum of Augustus. The various elements of each are related by a dynastic construct in which references to the past, present, and future are interwoven as manifesta- tions of the fortune and fate of Rome and the house of Au- gustus-allusions and interests paralleling those found in Augustan literature, especially the writings of Vergil. In creating a "narrative" out of an ensemble of visual images, the educated ancient observer would have been aided by his familiarity with histories, biographies, and genealogical treatises, as well as by his training in secondary and rhetori- cal schools. In the Ara Pacis, the scenes of the two front panels bring into association great inaugural events from the legendary past of Rome and of the house of Augustus, while the two back panels and other elements of the altar allude to Augus- tus's great accomplishment of peace through victory, as well as to the peace and security which his leadership and that of his descendants guarantee for the future. The long exterior friezes celebrate Augustus as a "second founder" in the con- text of what I believe to be an augural event, which, like the augural moments of the front panels, emphasizes a new be- ginning. Though the event commemorated in the exterior friezes takes place in the present, the future also is presaged by the children of the house of Augustus-the hope of Rome-who appear with him and other members of his large, united family. In the Forum of Augustus, each "portrait" statue of the celebrated summi viri of the Julian line and of Rome's old nobility was accompanied by a text in the form of a titulus and elogium. Together, text and portrait, summarizing a man's character and career, would have evoked in the mind of the observer a series of historical images fitting into the greater story of the rise of the Imperium Romanum. In this sculptural program, the glorious Roman past and its implied future were linked to the Augustan present, sym- bolized by the statue of Augustus in the center of his Forum. Here and in the context of the Augustan complex of the Campus Martius (Ara Pacis, Solarium, Mausoleum, Ustri- num) Augustus was presented as the future archetypal hero of the State whose principal accomplishment of peace through victory guaranteed his ultimate apotheosis, thus continuing the Augustan "story" of dynasty and destiny. PLINY'S LETTERS AND THE IDEOLOGY OF FLAVIAN PORTRAIT SCULPTURE: Eleanor Winsor Leach, In- diana University In a letter to Tacitus, the younger Pliny makes a compar- ison between artistic and literary portraiture (7.33.2): "If we habitually take care that our faces should be modeled by the best artificer, should we not also desire that a writer and a herald like yourself should give form to our deeds?" The significance of this comparison within the particular context of the letter goes beyond simple tribute to Tacitus's bril- liance as an historian. Pliny writes to offer material for in- clusion in the Histories; his story concerns his own public gestures in support of his colleague Herennius Senecio who soon after became one of Domitian's victims. Although the court action in which the two senators participated is avail- able to Tacitus by public record, the record will scarcely touch upon the political "danger" to which Pliny believes he exposed himself for a public portrait; his own letter consti- tutes a private self-portrait showing himself as he devoutly hopes to be seen. Such concern for public appearances as we find here characterizes many of Pliny's letters along with a similar anxiety that the public image should constitute a genuine reflection of the private man. A comparable concern may be seen in the strategies that post-Neronian emperors adapted for self-presentation through portrait sculpture. In particu- lar one may think of the two conspicuously different faces of Vespasian which scholars have variously described as realis- tic and idealized, private and public, but which, under any name, give evidence for the Emperor's desire to provide a</page><page sequence="33">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 299 recognizably honest likeness to the people. This interest seems fundamentally opposed to the traditions of Roman rhetoric which grant to any public speaker or performer the license to strive for persuasive communication by adopting a mask (persona) or fiction of personality. That a succession of capricious or corrupt emperors had rendered imperial self- idealization an unpersuasive fiction is obvious. Less obvious is the way in which a suspicion of self-presentation could affect any member of educated society called upon to judge or stand judgment. Pliny is scarcely the only author of his time who recognized a problematic discrepancy between public action and private character. This principle colors the historical perspectives of Tacitus and Suetonius alike, but Pliny alone of these three contemporaries reflects the consequences of the problem for self-presentation. GAMES, EDUCATION IN LIBERAL ARTS, AND A UNIVER- SAL GOD IN THE NORTHERN CAMPUS MARTIUS: Robert E.A. Palmer, University of Pennsylvania The paper examines the urban development of the city of Rome in the zone now occupied by the churches of Sts. Apollinaris and Augustine. Epigraphic evidence of games given for the return of Augustus in 13 and 7 B.C. is dis- cussed in light of the supposed remains of a theatrical stage near which was presumably set up the statue of Jupiter the Tragic Player given by Augustus as a gift to a Roman neigh- borhood. The presence of a pair of statue bases for a "very great orator" of the Severan era and the carved quotation of the prayer to Pan from Plato's Phaedrus are adduced for identification of a building uncovered in the Renaissance as the Athenaeum, Hadrian's foundation for the study of the liberal arts, which had the shape of a theater. SESSION IV D: CITY OF ROME ON A FRAGMENT OF A NEW MARBLE PLAN OF ROME: "PIANTA DI VIA ANICIA": Emilio Rodriguez-Almei- da, X Ripartizione, Comune di Roma In 1983 a fragment belonging to a new marble plan of Rome was found in Via Anicia, Trastevere. This discovery is of great importance from several points of view: first, it approximately dates to the first quarter of the second cen- tury, thus preceding the Severan marble plan (Forma Urbis Marmorea) by almost a century, and second, the scale, being identical to the one used for the Severan plan, facilitates the superposition of both topographies. The same sector of the river bank appears in both the new fragment and also in a group of fragments of the forma Severiana identified in 1977. Moreover, the new document gives us the complete plan of the Templum Castorum in Circo, accurately de- scribed by Vitruvius (De Arch. 4.8.4), and this fits precisely in a gap of the Severan plan fragments. Of interest in the new document are the numeral and nominal inscriptions appearing both inside and along the outer sides of the buildings. The first group attests the meas- ures recto rigore of different sectors of the portico along the river bank. In both documents (but clearer and more com- plete in the Severan plan), an isolated building stands be- tween the lines of the low- and high-water of the river. These two important facts suggest that the new document could eventually be considered as: 1) related to the cura alvei Tiberis; 2) precisely representing the very offices of this in- stitution, i.e., the statio alvei Tiberis et riparum et cloacarum urbis (the building on the river bed); and 3) the direct result (or one of the results) of the terminatio carried out by Ti. Iulius Ferox under Trajan (between A.D. 101 and 103) or the subsequent restitutio et exaltatio of L. Messius Rusticus under Hadrian (about A.D. 123). A GARDEN ON THE SEVERAN MARBLE PLAN OF ROME: THE PORTICUS OF POMPEY: Kathryn L. Gleason, American Academy in Rome; Lincoln College, Ox- ford University The Severan marble plan depicts eight areas generally identified as gardens. (See, for example, Carettoni et al., La pianta marmorea di Roma antica [Rome 1960] 101); P. Gri- mal, Lesjardins romains3 [Paris 1984] 173-75.) The major- ity are enclosed by porticoes and are monumental in scale. As with architecture, the symbols suggesting gardens are enigmatic: simple dots, circles, lines, and rectangles are the abstract indications of complex open spaces. Reconstruc- tions have been limited in detail, as the sites have not been extensively excavated and the ancient sources only hint at the appearance of these places. The symbols become less cryptic, however, using formal methods of landscape architectural analysis. Interpretation can be limited to those solutions that are architecturally fea- sible within the constraints of scale, function, location, water supply, drainage, and other aspects of the site infrastruc- ture. A fuller picture of the structure and appearance of these gardens can be constructed by adding to this frame- work the architectural remains and sculpture noted by the Italian authorities, coin depictions, as well as comparanda from the wall paintings and architectural remains of con- temporary sites. This paper examines the Porticus of Pompey, offering re- constructions for a formal arrangement of walks shaded by plane trees, cooled by monumental pools and fountains, and embellished with imported marbles, statuary, paintings, and textiles. THE GODDESS OF PEACE ON THE ARA PACIS AUGUS- TAE: Nancy Thomson de Grummond, Florida State University For many years the most popular identification of the striking female figure on the southeast frieze of the Ara Pacis has been as Tellus (Mother Earth). A rival theory by G.K. Galinsky proposed that she is the goddess Venus. His suggestion has not been widely accepted, though his argu-</page><page sequence="34">300 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 ments have been studied with much respect. Recently M. Torelli has used Galinsky's ideas to formulate a new, com- plex theory in which the goddess is given a triple identity: Torelli believes that she is at once Venus, Tellus, and Pax (Peace). This paper pleads for a return to a single identifi- cation, arguing this time that the figure is simply Pax alone. This idea was in fact proposed by V. Gardthausen in 1908, but subsequently sank into oblivion. It is here argued that the attributes of the deity in the frieze are all appropriate for Pax. She wears the veil, as Pax does on coins. She nurtures children, as does the Greek goddess of peace, Eirene. Her lap is filled with fruits, an image that recalls the description of Pax by Tibullus (Elegies 1.10.45ff.). Beside her in the background on the relief are the poppies and grain used as emblems of Pax on coins, while at her feet are the cow and the sheep, appropriate sacrificial animals for Pax. Flanking her are two female figures who seem to hover over land and sea and who have been widely accepted as embodying the concept of Pax terra marique parta. The position of the goddess on the east side or "back" of the altar precinct need not cause embarrassment. According to H. Kahler, this side, facing the Via Flaminia, could be considered the true front of the Ara Pacis. The relief with Pax was paired on the east side with a relief representing the war goddess Roma, a most appropriate counterpart for the goddess of peace. (The attributes of Pax and the goddess Roma appear together on opposite sides of certain coin issues.) Previous scholars have expressed uneasiness over the strange fact that the goddess Pax did not seem to be repre- sented on her own altar. The identification proposed here would solve this nagging problem. NEW OBSERVATIONS ON NERO'S DOMUS AUREA: Larry F. Ball, University of Virginia The famous Octagon Suite of the Domus Aurea has been widely regarded as a major milestone in the history of Ro- man architectural design. The creative and complex combi- nation of its component volumes is well known. Its chrono- logy has been poorly understood, however, especially rela- tive to the rest of the Esquiline Wing of which it is part. Recent investigations have, in fact, demonstrated that the Esquiline Wing has a notably more complicated chronology than originally assumed, and these investigations are forcing a revision in our interpretation of the Octagon Suite. In par- ticular, an obviously two-phased development in the Nym- phaeum Suite indicates that at least one of the major design features in the Octagon Suite, the clerestory windows open- ing onto the vault haunches, was introduced in the Nym- phaeum Suite, possibly accidentally, as a result of practical revisions not related to the Octagon Suite. The Octagon Suite is reinterpreted in the light of these observations and is shown to be rather less creative and less influential than pre- viously thought. Divus CLAUDIUS: Shelley C. Stone III, California State College, Bakersfield The over-lifesize statue of Claudius as Jupiter found at Lanuvium in 1865 and now in the Vatican is today the best- known image of the Emperor. It was not a common portrait- type, and its deified iconography is unique in the types used by Claudius, according ill with his religious conservatism. Yet, the Lanuvium portrait has often been associated with a base of A.D. 42/43 once in the Vatican (e.g., Helbig4 I, 37-38, no. 45; ANRW II.16.2, 944-45). This association has been doubted (e.g., G. Hanfmann, Observations on Ro- man Portraiture [Brussels 1953] 44-45), since the dimen- sions and exact find-spot of the base are unknown. Recently, I have demonstrated that the other surviving example of the portrait-type, at Olympia, dates to the early years of Vespa- sian's reign (AM 100 [1985] 377-91). This suggests that the Lanuvium Claudius may also be Vespasianic, a dating sup- ported by its deified iconography and other evidence. Under Nero, Divus Claudius appeared only on coins of A.D. 55, and his immortality was soon annulled. Nero also destroyed the parts of the Claudianum in Rome begun by his mother. It is therefore extremely unlikely that a deified portrait-type for Claudius was evolved between A.D. 55 and 68. Vespa- sian revived Divus Claudius, and rebuilt and completed the Claudianum (Suet. Vesp. 9.1). This would have required a cult statue, and the Lanuvium type, with its deified icono- graphy, fits the needs of this cult statue admirably. A Vespa- sianic dating of the Lanuvium Claudius would also explain the stylistic affinities of its head with early portraits of Ves- pasian. The relative unpopularity of the Lanuvium type also becomes easy to explain, since Divus Claudius' popu- larity faded after the early years of the Flavian dynasty. At that time, his resuscitation as a divus had demonstrated the pietas of the new ruling family toward its predecessors who had followed Augustus' lead in good government, as well as a repudiation of Nero. When Flavian rule was secure, and the Claudianum complete, pietas and propaganda alike were satisfied. The Lanuvium Claudius, like its mate at Olympia, probably dates between A.D. 71 and 75, and like- ly reproduces the type of the cult statue of the Claudianum in Rome. This redating also illustrates anew the complex interplay of traditions operative in Roman sculpture of the second half of the first century A.C. SESSION IV E: GREEK AND ROMAN SCULP- TURE SILVER TEETH: DOCUMENTATION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Caroline Houser, Smith College In Roman times sculptors often set silver into bronze stat- ues, but little is written about silver insets in bronze sculp- ture made in Greek times. The controversy over the Riace Warriors stimulated me to consider and document specific</page><page sequence="35">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 301 examples of silver components in monumental bronze stat- ues that are well accepted as Greek originals. Silver insets define the meander and cross pattern on the Delphi Charioteer's fillet. Less well known and difficult to see under ordinary circumstances are the Charioteer's silver teeth. With special lighting I was able to see the statue's silver teeth and now can present the first photographic docu- mentation of those teeth. The "Berber" from Cyrene, anoth- er Classical Greek statue, still holds its original silver teeth, too. This documentation is part of the evidence that monu- mental Greek bronze statues were designed to be polished and colored, not made monochrome by artificial patination. These examples also indicate that Riace Warrior A's silver teeth cannot be used as an argument that the statue is of Roman date; they must be seen as another example of the way that the newly discovered sculptures fit well with the stylistic and technical characteristics of Early Classical Greek art. ARES BORGHESE: ACHILLES IN DISGUISE?: Kim J. Hartswick, George Washington University An impressive statue known as the Ares Borghese, now in the Louvre, has been recognized in a number of Roman rep- licas. The total number includes two statues with preserved heads, 10 disembodied heads, eight headless torsos, and a statuette. The Borghese statue, nude, helmeted and holding a shield (only the arm straps are preserved), has been identi- fied as Ares. This identification has led to the attribution of the original to the well-known sculptor of the fifth century, Alkamenes. Only two sculptors are mentioned in the liter- ary testimonia as having made a statue of Ares: Alkamenes (Paus. 1.8.4) and Skopas (Pliny HN 36.26). Stylistically the Borghese statue dates from the fifth century rather than the fourth, and the statue by Skopas was a colossal seated Ares; therefore, Alkamenes is the obvious choice between the two sculptors. This attribution to Alkamenes relies on the identification of the statue as Ares and on the assump- tion that the Romans copied only statues which have been mentioned in the extant literaty sources. A considerable amount of confidence in the correct identification of the statue and the completeness of the ancient sources is, there- fore, necessary to accept conclusively the attribution of the original to Alkamenes. The elaborate relief decoration on the helmet is of consid- erable interest because it includes heraldic griffins and crouching dogs. In the Classical period the griffin played a minor role save for the notable exception on the helmet of the Athena Parthenos. Griffins are not known to be asso- ciated with Ares but are common to the Roman Mars, par- ticularly Mars Ultor. The crouching dogs are unique to the decoration of the Borghese helmet type, and must have a special significance in the identification of the statue. Crouching dogs appear in the fifth century, but they are not restricted to that period and, in fact, can be more strongly associated with the typical Roman camp dog. Finally, an actual bronze helmet (now in Berlin) has the same relief decoration of griffins and dogs, and it is perhaps a Roman type. I would like to suggest that the Borghese helmet is, indeed, a Roman helmet type which has been added to a fifth-century figure in order to create a Mars. Once the helmet has been removed as a fifth-century ele- ment, the identification of the original as Ares, and the attri- bution to Alkamenes, must be abandoned. The helmetless statue can then be seen to be a long-haired youthful figure, perhaps originally carrying shield and spear, and identifi- able as Achilles. THE HEKATOMPEDON MASTER: A NEW ARTISTIC PERSONALITY IN LATE ARCHAIC SICILY: John F. Kenfield, Rutgers University Study of the architectural sculpture of Archaic Morganti- na and its connections with the greater Greek world has led to the identification of a major workshop of architectural sculpture in terracotta, apparently dominated by a single personality, and active in Late Archaic eastern Sicily. The products of the workshop have appeared most completely at Morgantina and Megara Hyblaia, but tantalizing frag- ments have lately appeared in Catania as a result of the ex- cavations conducted by the Istituto di Archeologia of the University of Catania in the cloister of the Benedictine mon- astery of San Nicolo, probably the site of Archaic Katane's citadel. When considering the revetments produced by this master from these three sites, there are several reasons for believing that the workshop was Catanese, and though little is ever likely to be known about ancient Catania (Katane), buried as it is beneath its Mediaeval and modern successors, Archaic Morgantina will probably provide the best picture of the apparently tremendous Hellenizing power which late Archaic Katane exercised on central eastern Sicily. WORKSHOPS AND SCULPTORS IN ANCIENT CYPRUS: Pamela Gaber, University of New Hampshire The existence of regional styles in the sculpture of an- cient Cyprus has been recognized for several years. It is now possible to isolate and identify the workshops of sepa- rate sites of the Archaic and Classical periods such as Pota- mia, Lefkonico, Pergamos, and others. In some cases there is more than one workshop at a single site, and within these workshops, the work of individual sculptors is sometimes clearly discernible. To isolate the work of separate hands, a series of features must be noted and compared. This entails careful recording of the shape, size, position, and relative proportions of indi- vidual traits. If consistent techniques of notation and meas- urement are employed, the art historical judgments are re- producible. Some analyses can also be handled by compu- ters. There are advantages to these procedures. In addition</page><page sequence="36">302 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 to the reproducibility already mentioned, anyone can per- form the major tasks of measurement, notation, and anal- ysis, rather than only a trained art historian. The implications of these procedures are important for cult sites in Cyprus and the Levant where offerings of votive sculpture are found in the hundreds. A methodology which can be applied to these assemblages by any careful scholar must be of use to all. In a broader context, the reproduc- ibility of results supports the validity of art historical judg- ments for archaeological inquiry. FIGURED BRONZES FROM THE SANCTUARY OF APOLLO HYLATES: P. Gregory Warden, Southern Methodist University Thirty-two bronzes from the Sanctuary of Apollo Hy- lates at Kourion are now in the University Museum, Phila- delphia, and provide a representative sample of the metal dedications from the site. These objects vary greatly in date, although the more elaborate pieces are Roman and attest to the popularity of the cult in the first century B.C. Particularly noteworthy are three figured bronzes that il- lustrate the quality of metalwork and richness of dedications from the Archaic period to Roman times. Earliest in date is a fragmentary relief which has only been briefly published (ILN 220 [5 April 1952] 589, fig. 9). The repousse decora- tion of the relief can be reconstructed as a pair of rampant antithetical felines on either side of a palmette. Iconograph- ical connections to stone reliefs from Golgoi (Cyprus) and to Cretan bronze armor of the seventh century B.C. suggest that our relief is of early Archaic date and probably of Cyp- riot manufacture. A better-known figure of a bronze stag (ILN 220 [5 April 1952] 589, fig. 5) served as a handle for the lid of a bronze vessel. It has been considered part of a group of small-scale copies of a Greek original of the fifth century B.C., but in fact our stag has no good parallels and cannot be connected closely to the other known representa- tions of stags from the Classical world. Finally, an unpub- lished figurine of Diana shows the goddess striding forward while wearing a long peplos which swirls around her legs and falls off the shoulder to bare her right breast. This fig- ure is a variant of the Versailles Artemis, but the eclectic nature of the costume and hair style, as well as the great three-dimensionality of the pose, identify her as a Roman work of the first century A.C. MAJOR TO MINOR: SOME REFLECTIONS OF CLASSICAL SCULPTURE IN HELLENISTIC AND EARLY IMPERIAL DECORATIVE RELIEF: Beryl Barr-Sharrar, New York Society Individual works of late Classical sculpture are reflected in the decorative arts at least as late as the end of the second century A.C. Indeed, one of the more easily recognized is Alexander with the Lance, a distant reflection of which ap- pears on a silver phiale medallion from the time of Marcus Aurelius. The identity of other prototypical Classical works which lent their form and iconography to small reliefs in silver, gold, and bronze is more obscure. Yet, the iconography of a series of bronze busts of Artemis used to decorate klinai and iron chests is so consistent from the third century B.C. to well into the first century A.C. that a common fourth-century model, possibly Skopas' Artemis, seems almost a certainty. Classicizing second- and first-century B.C. bronze busts of such deities as Dionysos and Hermes are clearly based on fourth-century prototypes, and the Roman counterparts of these idealized subjects are almost identical in iconography. Whether the latter are based on Classicizing Hellenistic models and therefore to be considered once removed from, though still ultimately dependent on, late Classical sculp- ture, or the fourth-century type was transmitted by the deco- rative arts alone, is a question to be considered. Early Hellenistic bronze reliefs of Alexander as Pan must have had a common sculptural prototype unknown to us, probably from the late fourth century, and small items of jewelry from the second century B.C., as well as bronze stamps used in their production, reveal repetitions in the iconography of Aphrodite with one or two Erotes which suggest at least two common models in works of large sculp- ture, also perhaps of fourth-century origin. APOLLO IN THRACE AND ASIA MINOR: SCULPTURE AND COINS: Aileen Ajootian, Bryn Mawr College For archaeologists, numismatic evidence can be vital for dating excavated contexts and for providing glimpses of the vanished sculptures of famous Greek masters. This exercise is attested by the mid-18th century, reaching a new level of specialization in the late 19th with the work of Imhoof-Blu- mer and Gardner, whose criteria for determining sculptural coin types are still employed today. The archaeological bias of their work is clear. Matching coin types with references in Pausanias, they created an illustrated version of the an- cient text. But the full potential of the numismatic record is rarely exploited. Significant coins, treated as discrete objects, are used to corroborate other evidence, while the range of information to be gleaned from mint location and geograph- ical distribution remains unexplored. Nor are the still un- solved problems of engraving conventions taken into ac- count. A prime example of this neglect occurs in the group of Greek Imperials thought to reproduce the Praxitelean Apol- lo Sauroktonos. These coins exhibit a surprising degree of variation in pose and iconography traditionally considered to be simplifications of die design. But the earliest examples, Domitianic coins of Apollonia ad Rhyndacum (Bithynia), include neither the tree trunk nor lizard so essential in the three-dimensional composition, and Apollo's pose diverges at several points from the sculptural one. Later issues from Nicopolis ad Istrum and Philippopolis have the tree but only sometimes the lizard. Also unaddressed is the problem h</page><page sequence="37">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 303 of reconciling these Asia Minor and Thracian minting au- thorities with the primarily Italian findspots of the three-di- mensional replicas. A re-evaluation of coins traditionally as- sociated with attributions to famous Greek masters reveals as much about the well-developed traditions of art on Greek Imperial coins as it does about the famous Greek sculptures they are supposed to reproduce. THE EAGLE VANQUISHING A HARE: A FLAVIAN VIC- TORY MOTIF: Richard A. Gergel, Central Michigan University Various motifs are employed as lappet decorations on Roman Imperial cuirassed statues, but the particular motif of an eagle grasping a hare occurs only on cuirassed statues of the Flavian period. On early Flavian examples from the reigns of Vespasian (A.D. 69-79) and Titus (A.D. 79-81) the eagle clutches the back of the hare. This can be seen on a cuirassed statue from Sabratha that commemorates the Ju- dean triumph of Titus. Additional examples decorate lap- pets on cuirassed statues in Frankfurt-am-Main and Saintes. On examples from the reign of Domitian (A.D. 81-96) the eagle clutches the underbelly of the hare. This motif oc- curs twice in the upper row of lappets on a cuirassed statue of Domitian acquired by The Art Museum, Princeton, in 1984 (see R. Gergel, "An Allegory of Imperial Victory on a Cuirassed Statue of Domitian," RecArtMusPrinceton 45.1 [1986] 3-15). A similar pendant arrangment of the motif appears on Domitianic cuirassed statues in the Palazzo Al- tieri, Rome, and in The J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu. Additional examples decorate lappets on late Flavian cui- rassed statues in Me'rida and in the Vatican Museum. The motif first occurs in the late fifth century B.C. as a reverse type on numismatic issues from Akragas and later can be found on Roman gems of the first century A.C. In the major arts of the first century, however, the motif appears exclusively in a Flavian context and can also be found on funerary altars of the period. The motif celebrates the mili- tary strength of the Flavian dynasty and late Flavian exam- ples may allude to the name of Legion XXI Rapax that fought in several of Domitian's northern wars. SESSION IV F: POSTER SESSION II THE FORUM OF TRAJAN IN 1986: THE CLEANING AND DOCUMENTATION: James Packer, Northwestern University With the support and cooperation of the Comune di Roma, the J. Paul Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities began in 1985, under my supervision, a project to document the Forum of Trajan. Last year we pho- tographed the principal architectural fragments of the exca- vated buildings, and in 1986, as the first steps in making a complete scientific plan, we cleaned and photographed the entire site. The cleaning revealed the large number of col- ored marbles used to execute the architectural elements and indicated that, on all four sides, a gray granite border had surrounded the nave of the Basilica Ulpia. Additionally, it showed both that the podium of the Ulpia was of solid con- crete and that some of the shafts of the columns in the West Library were of giallo antico. These discoveries will appear on the new "Plan," actual- ly, several different documents: sections of the standing re- mains and maps both of ancient and modern walls and of the Forum and of the surrounding streets after the Napoleonic excavations of 1812-1813 and the large-scale Fascist exca- vations of 1926-1933. With its completion in early 1987, this plan and the pho- tographs mentioned above-to be published in my mono- graph on the Forum of Trajan-will make the site the best documented Imperial complex in Rome. DORIC TEMPLE PROPORTIONS: AN APPLICATION OF QUANTITATIVE TECHNIQUES TO A PROBLEM IN CLASSICAL ARCHAEOLOGY: John A. Shimmin, Boul- der Society Vitruvius (De Arch. 4.3.3) wrote that he could dictate the proportional formula for constructing Doric temples. He states that these proportions were based on a modular sys- tem determined by the spaces between columns. Unfortu- nately, Vitruvius omitted the actual formula for peripteral "pycnostyle" temples. In fact, he may never have possessed this information. Nevertheless, this has not deterred others from searching for the Vitruvian Doric temple proportional module by simulating solutions for the missing formula. Unlike other attempts to establish a proportional frame- work, however, this paper ignores all prior concepts of Vi- truvian proportionality, and establishes a Doric temple pro- portional formula based on statistical modeling. The data base for this statistical modeling was conceived by first creat- ing a classification for Doric temples. Current Doric temple classifications are descriptive, and rely on subjective identifi- cations rather than quantification of the data sets. This in- tuitive method was not precise enough for statistical model- ing. Therefore, this paper establishes an objective formal taxonomy based on specific attribute sets derived from vari- ous classes of temples-it is these attributes that make up the data set. The data were then subjected to a correlation and regression statistical test. The results produce a mathematical model that is 99% accurate in predicting temple proportions. Not only do the statistical results produce a mathematically reliable model, but they imply that the progenitor of the formula was Pythagoras. This conclusion is reached since Doric temple proportionality crystallized around 490 B.C., and remained virtually unaltered throughout the tenure of the style. Addi- tionally, the statistical results produce a proportional for-</page><page sequence="38">304 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 mula based on irrational numbers-a mathematical phe- nomenon revealed first within the Pythagorian brotherhood. The practical applications are significant with regard to restoring temples from extant foundations, or establishing relative proportions from vestigial remains. ROMAN COMMERCIAL FOREST MANAGEMENT: AN Ex- AMPLE IN CENTRAL ITALY: Pamela Hemphill, West Chester University Within the Civitella Cesi Survey area lies a 30-km.2 tract of rugged, mixed-limestone hills. The hills are not arable, even with terracing, and today are almost completely unoc- cupied and covered with oak forests. Within this hilly ter- rain 55 Roman sites have been found, 49 of which lie on ridge-tops, peaks, or saddles, or are strung along the sides of the hills. A network of roads linked these sites with one an- other and with a paved road leading to the Via Clodia in the vicinity of Veiano. The sites are too numerous, in some cases too substantial, too isolated from farms and villas, and too methodically strung out along roads to be livestock tenders' cottages. Such a well-organized and systematic use of these hills can only point to lumbering operations, still a feature of the area today. Indeed, the enormous amount of wood, especially firewood, needed by the city of Rome, must have provided a ready market to any area within shipping, floating, or cart- ing distance, and this area was only a three-day ox-cart journey from Rome. Yet, in this area, the use of the forests in Roman times has not led to total deforestation as in so many parts of the Mediterranean basin. The regeneration of the forests, once human interference was removed, was only possible because soil conditions were not changed. The lack of change or de- struction of the soil, so easy in limestone hills, means that in this area the Romans had to have been using controlled for- est management. This is known to have included the copsing of trees to produce a crop of logs every 12 to 20 years, ideal for firewood among other uses. This evidence appears to illustrate an active local com- merce, profitable yet not exploitative, known in literature but rarely demonstrated on the ground. A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE "ARA PIETATIS AUGUS- TAE"/ARA GENTIS IULIAE: Paul Rehak, The Uni- versity of Kansas This paper presents a new reconstruction of the early Im- perial reliefs in Rome which have been attributed to a mon- umental altar: the so-called "Ara Pietatis Augustae" or- more probably-the Ara Gentis Iuliae. Each previously attributed block has been examined as far as possible in terms of size, evidence of workmanship, and the composition and style of the carved surfaces. Accu- rate scale drawings made of each piece have been used in the proposed reconstruction. The corpus of fragments accepted for the reconstruction excludes several traditional attributions (e.g., the block showing Vestals at banquet and the fragment with female, camillus and popa). Most of the remaining pieces are as- signed to one of two long friezes, which show processions culminating in sacrifices in the Forum Augusti and on the Palatine hill. The scenes thus cannot "record" the founda- tion rites at the site of the altar, in the sense that is usually argued for the long friezes of the Ara Pacis Augustae. The iconography of the scenes, including references ap- propriate to the cult of a divus (probably Augustus), and to gods linked with the Julian family, make it likely that our monument is indeed the Ara Gentis Iuliae. An examination of related historical and epigraphic sources, however, makes it likely that such a project was completed by Tiberius rath- er than by Claudius, a conclusion which has important im- plications for the dating of the reliefs. PROGRESS IN THE PROSOPOGRAPHIA VASORUM ATTICO- RUM: R.D. Cromey, Virginia Commonwealth Uni- versity The PVA undertaken by R. Cromey and H.A. Shapiro is intended as a catalogue of all names of living men and women taken from Athenian ware of ca. 600-150 B.C. En- tries generally now include: location (by museum inventory no.), vessel type, iconography, all inscriptions on the vase in original letter-forms when available, attribution and date given by others, and bibliography. The collection already doubles the number of personal names beyond Beazley's lists of kalos-names and artists' signatures. The collection's value when published will be to allow better attribution and dating, to assist the study of interrela- tionships of clientele and ateliers, to set the study of social affinity groups on a firmer basis (e.g., of coevals), and to help the study of Attic onomatology upon which prosopo- graphy rests. An original 1100 individual vase entries were taken from the vase inscriptions collected from the 1930s to ca. 1970 by Prof. H. Immerwahr. Five hundred new entries have thus far been contributed to this data base; still to be collated are many CVA fascicles and the lists of kalos-names and artists' signatures given by Beazley (these were not duplicated from Immerwahr's slips when those came only from Beazley). The editors further encourage the submission of new or al- tered readings, from unpublished or newly cleaned material. The final collection should contain about 2500 individual vases, with many hundred new names contributing to the study of Attic society and its artistic evolution. THE 1986 EXCAVATION AT ABILA OF THE DECAPOLIS: W. Harold Mare, Covenant Seminary</page><page sequence="39">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 305 The 1986 Abila of the Decapolis Excavation, northern Jordan, conducted 21 June-8 August, had as one of its objec- tives the further delineation of the size, nature, and time span of two of the major churches on this large site. The triapsidal sixth-century Byzantine basilica on Tell Abila on the north, 18 m. wide and 32 m. long, proved to have used part of an ear- lier Roman temple, parts of whose large podium and under- ground chamber were uncovered. The seventh-century basil- ica on Umm el 'Amad (the southern tell) also proved to be tri- apsidal; it is even larger, with the nave 10 m. wide and the side aisles each 5 m. wide. The total length of the structure is 41 m. The two rows of columns on the north and south stylo- bates of the Umm el 'Amad basilica were alternately of lime- stone and basalt. Parts of the inconostasis, including the altar screen of both basilicas, were found. THE IRON AGE I SETTLEMENT OF NAHAL YATTIR, IS- RAEL: Steven Derfier, Hamline University Although many major sites have been excavated in the northern Negev in the past two decades, a major archaeo- logical survey was not carried out until 1984. The Iron Age site of Nahal Yattir 205 was first discovered in 1984 in a survey carried out by Y. Govrin (map 139, site #205, coord. 14020/07250). The site measures about 300 x 150 m. or 35 dunam. It is located on the north side of Nahal Yattir, rising from the wadi northwest to a height of 330 m. above sea level. It is situated about 2 km. before the junction of the Nahal Yattir and the Nahal Beersheva, midway between Horvat Wattan and Tel Beersheva. The first season of excavations at Nahal Yattir was car- ried out from 22 July-7 August 1986 in a joint venture be- tween the Israeli Department of Antiquities and Hamline University, directed by S. Derfiler of Hamline and Y. Govrin of the Negev Museum. Salvage excavations were carried out along the wadi where a number of grain silos 3.0 m. in dia- meter and preserved to a height of 0.80 m. were close to the surface. The major excavation centered in a large public building on the acropolis, measuring 23.50 m.2 Over 275 m.2 were cleared, revealing a structure with a series of rooms surrounding a central court. It was built of massive flint stones, all averaging 1.0 x 0.80 m. in size. In addition, a pillar wall supporting the roof separated the rooms from the courtyard. The floors were of either a hard-packed earth or stone paving. In situ were found cooking pots, lamps, store- jars and juglets dating to the 1 1th-10th century B.C. or the end of Iron I in Israel. Other finds included an alabaster bottle and stopper, as well as a wide range of lithics. THE GREEK TRIREME PROJECT: A PROGRESS REPORT: N.B. Rankov, Regent's College, London, and Cor- pus Christi College, Oxford University The abstract of this paper was unavailable for publica- tion. SESSION V A: AMERICAN SCHOOL OF CLAS- SICAL STUDIES IN ATHENS ARCHAEO- LOGICAL ACTIVITY IN GREECE INTRODUCTION AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND TO AR- CHAEOLOGY IN GREECE: Stephen G. Miller, Ameri- can School of Classical Studies at Athens The historical role and development of archaeology in Greece and of the various archaeological institutions are presented. The nature of the Archaeological Service, the Ar- chaeological Society, the universities and the foreign ar- chaeological schools is examined, and the American School will be highlighted as an example of the last. TWENTY YEARS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN WESTERN CRETE: Yannis Tzedakis, Director of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, Greek Minis- try of Culture A series of significant excavations marks the progress of research in Crete during the past 20 years: one can mention Zakros, Palaikastro, Aghia Photia, Mallia, Aghia Triada, Kommos, Knossos, Yiouchtas, Anemospelia, Archanes, the Idaian Cave, Syme of Viannos, and Vrysinas. Theories which were developed to explain discoveries at some of these sites have created agitation and confusion in international and Greek scientific circles, yet they provided an opportu- nity for discussions which, in the end, have helped the pro- gress of scientific research. For western Crete we might describe this 20 years as "an impressive beginning with a bright future." Systematic ex- cavations, some of which are continuing (e.g., the Greek- Swedish excavation at Kastelli in Chania and the Greek ex- cavation at Armenoi near Rhethymna), have provided so much material that the theory that Neolithic and Minoan civilization existed only in central and eastern Crete must be changed completely. At the same time, the archaeological map of western Crete is constantly being enriched with new sites. Western Crete has been, and is, open to all scholars. All who have worked or are working here have had the good fortune to uncover significant Neolithic and Minoan re- mains which prove that, at least culturally, the island had a unity which knew neither natural nor artificial boundaries. Near the village of Armenoi in the province of Rhethym- na a Late Minoan III cemetery with subterranean chamber tombs cut into the bedrock has been excavated since 1969. The organization which is apparent in the region, the architecture of the tombs, and their construction in groups as well as the finds (terracotta larnakes, pottery, bronze ves- sels, furnishings and jewelry, seal stones and jewelry of semiprecious stone), together with observations concerning funeral practices and customs, provide a good picture of the</page><page sequence="40">306 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 systematic excavations of these 176 tombs which, in the end, will probably number more than 220. Finally, the location of the settlement to which the ceme- tery belonged opens new avenues of research into Minoan Crete during the period after the final destruction of the pal- ace of Knossos. Two ARCHAIC STATUES FROM THE HERAION OF SA- MOS: Helmut Kyrieleis, German Archaeological In- stitute at Athens This communication deals with two important finds of Archaic sculpture which came to light during the excava- tions of the German Archaeological Institute in the Samian sanctuary of Hera in 1980 and 1984. One of these is a colos- sal kouros of about three times life-size. This outstanding masterpiece of Samian sculpture is remarkably well pre- served and can be dated to ca. 580-570 B.C. The second dis- covery is the torso of a female figure found in a late Roman wall. This figure is an almost exact twin of the famous kore, dedicated by Cheramyes, which was excavated a century ago in the same sanctuary, and which is now in the Louvre in Paris. The dedicatory inscription of the new statue is identi- cal to the inscription of the Louvre kore. It seems that the base of the two statues is preserved in a block found in the same excavation. EXCAVATION AND RESTORATION OF THE SANCTUARY OF ASKLEPIOS AT EPIDAUROS: Vassilis Lambrinou- dakis, University of Athens Intensive excavation and conservation activity in the twin Epidaurian sanctuaries of Apollo Maleatas and Asklepios during the past five years has increased our knowledge of the famous cultural center and guarantees a longer life for the remains whose didactic function will also be improved. Excavation in the earlier cult site (the sanctuary of Apol- lo) brought to light large parts of the Mycenaean shrine (main and secondary terraces, open-air altar, and sacred rooms) and elucidated its Classical form (temple, stoa, altar with baldachino, temenos of the Muses, votive monuments), and revealed its Roman transformations (temple-shaped enclosure with sacrificial place, repaired stoa, priests' mansion). An extended restoration program of the Roman mansion of the priests and its monumental cistern is now in progress. In the main Classical sanctuary of Asklepios, systematic conservation work began in the "Gymnasion" where the dis- integrated monumental orthostates of its walls are being mended. At the same time three projects of exhaustive study .and partial restoration are underway concerning the Incu- bation Hall, the Tholos, and the monumental Propylon of the "Gymnasion." During excavation important observa- tions were made with regard to: 1) the pre-Classical situa- tion (a building discovered under the foundations of the In- cubation Hall in association with the Archaic Sacred Well) and the radical reshaping of the sanctuary; 2) the construc- tion of the Incubation Hall; 3) the construction of the Tholos and the Classical arrangement of the surrounding areas; and 4) the construction, the architectural forms, the history, and the use of the "Gymnasion." In addition, interesting archi- tectural fragments and other artifacts were found. ON PRESERVING THE MONUMENTS OF THE ATHENIAN ACROPOLIS: Evi Touloupa, Acropolis Museum and Ephoreia Ever-increasing air pollution has, during the last 30 years, accelerated the rate at which the Acropolis marbles are deteriorating. This report surveys the project for saving the Acropolis monuments-achievements since 1979, work in progress, and plans for the future-and presents a short account of the difficult decisions yet to be made that require international cooperation. The Acropolis rock, in imminent danger of collapsing at various points, is being consolidated and reinforced. Emer- gency operations had to be carried out on the Propylaia, especially after the earthquakes of 1981, even before the preliminary studies for conserving the monument were completed. Parts of the frieze from the Temple of Athena Nike were recently removed to protect them from deterioration. A team of architects is inventorying and studying thou- sands of marbles scattered over the Acropolis; as a result many architectural blocks from the Parthenon have been found and will be restored to their original places in the building. The iron clamps, dowels, and reinforcements used in pre- vious restorations have rusted, expanded, and shattered the very blocks of marble they were holding together. This de- structive iron is now being removed and replaced with at- tachments of non-oxidizing metal. What should we do to save the architectural sculpture now being eaten away by acid rain? We cannot treat the surfaces with polymeric substances since experience in other countries has shown them to be harmful. The caryatids and Parthenon pediment figures have been moved to the muse- um and sealed off in cases with nitrogen. Roofing now pro- tects sculpture still in place from the deadly acid rain. Our chemists are continuing their research to find a way to pro- tect marble surfaces. There is one dilemma always in our minds and on our conscience. Although the 11th hour has come and action must be taken, how do we find the courage to dismantle and rebuild when there is always the danger, even if we do cor- rect the old mistakes, of making new mistakes for which we will be held responsible in the future? Our answer lies in thoroughly preparing every step of the way. An interdisci- plinary team of archaeologists, architects, engineers, and chemists produces documentation, analyses, and proposals that are considered by the Committee for the Preservation of the Acropolis and specialists from all over the world. Two international conferences have been convened: on the Erech- theion in 1977 and on the Parthenon in 1983. The present Acropolis Museum is too small for the Acro- polis treasures and too small for the multitudes of visitors.</page><page sequence="41">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 307 The site for a new Acropolis Museum has been chosen on the lower Acropolis south slope opposite the Theater of Dio- nysos. There finds from 5000 years of Acropolis history will, at last, be shown together. We shall be asking our Greek friends and philhellenes abroad to help us to build the new Acropolis Museum. ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE: AN OVERVIEW: John McK. Camp, American School of Classical Studies at Athens This paper presents a brief survey of recent work in Greece at sites other than those previously discussed in this session. Included are the results of new excavations and sur- face surveys, new museums, recent publications, and special projects arranged in a roughly geographical order from north to south, and covering material from Palaeolithic to Byzantine times. SESSION V B: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE NEAR EAST KHIRBET ISKANDER: A REGIONAL STUDY: Mary- Louise Mussell, Drew University Traditional theory has viewed Early Bronze Age IV (ca. 2300-2000 B.C.) in Palestine and Transjordan as a "Dark Age," characterized by "pastoral nomadism," occurring be- tween the urban periods of Early Bronze III and Middle Bronze I. It was thought that the pastoral life-style pre- cluded the existence of fortified urban centers. This theory was substantiated by the apparent lack of permanent settle- ments which could be dated to EB IV in either Palestine or Transjordan. The excavation of an extensive EB IV ceme- tery at Jericho led Kathleen Kenyon to theorize that the pas- toral nomads were drawn to a central cultic center and cemetery, but that they were not sedentary. Excavations at Khirbet Iskander in Jordan have put the long-accepted nature of EB IV in doubt. At the site, an ex- tensive cemetery is coupled with a fortified urban center, which has been securely dated to EB IV. An examination of the relationship between Khirbet Is- kander and neighboring sites, especially those on the Plain of Moab, gives us insight into the spatial and temporal rela- tionships enjoyed by the one known urban center of EB IV. The regional affinities of Khirbet Iskander suggest that it was part of a system unlike any region now identified in Palestine. It appears that the non-sedentary/pastoral so- ciety which excavations in Palestine have revealed did not exist or existed in a modified form in the region surrounding Khirbet Iskander. The dynamics of the Khirbet Iskander re- gion dictated the existence of a fortified urban center. We must now be prepared to posit a cultural milieu for Trans- jordan unlike that of Palestine which is a radical departure from accepted theory. TYPOLOGICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL COMPARISONS OF LATE THIRD-MILLENNIUM B.C. METAL IMPLE- MENTS FROM PALESTINE: William G. Dever, Uni- versity of Arizona, and John Merkel, Harvard Uni- versity This paper presents a typological and technological anal- ysis of a group of copper and bronze implements of the Pal- estinian Early Bronze IV horizon (ca. 2200-2000 B.C.), ex- cavated at Jebel Qa'aqir in the Hebron hills of the West Bank. Previous analyses of metals from the ancient Near East have suggested that true bronze (i.e., copper with an admix- ture of 8-10% tin) did not appear in Palestine before the Middle Bronze period, ca. 2000 B.C., somewhat later than in Syria and Mesopotamia. Recently, T. Stech, J.D. Muhly, and R. Maddin (1985) have shown, however, that several EB IV metal implements from 'Enan in northern Israel are indeed made from bronze alloys. They argue, nonetheless, that these bronzes are not native to Palestine but were brought by "nomadic invaders" from Anatolia, where the only sources of tin from this period are found. This hypo- thesis goes against the prevailing view, which explains the socioeconomic changes in Palestine in EB IV largely in terms of indigenous developments. This paper will attempt to advance the discussion by showing: 1) that new analytical techniques are capable of more refined analysis, in particular in the detection of mi- nute trace elements, and thus that the conclusions of Stech, Muhly, and Maddin are in need of revision; and 2) that analysis of previously unpublished metal implements from Jebel Qa'aqir, as well as Jericho, shows a consistent corre- lation of true tin-bronze alloys with certain types of daggers, which suggests that EB IV metallurgists employed the new and expensive technology only for certain weapons where greater strength was desired. THE VALUE OF THE MYCENAEAN POTTERY FROM TRANSJORDAN SITES: Albert Leonard, Jr., Univer- sity of Arizona To date, imported Mycenaean pottery has been found at eight sites located east of the Jordan River and these sites are situated in several, varied ecological zones: the northern highlands (Tell Irbid); the eastern ghor of the Jordan Val- ley (Tabaqat Fahel/Pella, Tell es-Saidiyeh and Deir 'Alla); the Beqa'a Valley (Umm ed'Dananir); and the southern highlands (Amman, Sahab, and Madeba). These imports are valuable for four major reasons: 1) They demonstrate that the demand for Mycenaean imports was not restricted to the major commercial centers of the Syro-Palestinian coast, but that these vessels and/or their contents were also valued in the hinterland; 2) They show, by comparing the Transjordan sample with the full Aegean repertoire, which kinds of products enjoyed the most demand in the inland area(s); 3) They suggest the local land routes by which these (and other) goods traveled from the coastal emporia to the</page><page sequence="42">308 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 inland markets; and 4) They give an impression of the rela- tive wealth and social stature of the inhabitants of Late Bronze Age Transjordan, people who were able to acquire commodities that had traveled, by both sea and land, from production centers over 1000 km. distant. The presence of Mycenaean imports at sites east of the Jordan River, therefore, helps to dispel many of the tradi- tional views of Transjordan as a cultural "backwater" dur- ing the Late Bronze Age, and helps us to visualize flourish- ing communities able to engage actively in the international commerce that characterized the central and eastern Medi- terranean during the 14th and 13th centuries B.C. TEL GERISA, ISRAEL-THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE YARKON BASIN: Fredric R. Brandfon, College of Charleston This paper, while briefly presenting an overall regional history of the Yarkon basin in Israel, concentrates on two problematic points in that history: the transition from the Middle to Late Bronze Age and the transition from the Bronze to the Iron Age. Both transitions are dramatically evident in the archaeological record at Tel Gerisa and at other sites located in the region (Tel Aphek, Tel Mical, Tel Qasile, Jaffa, Izbet, Sarta). Nevertheless, the Middle to Late Bronze transition appears to be evolutionary whereas the Bronze to Iron Age transition appears to be revolutionary. Using the findings (including stratigraphic sequences, settlement pattern data, technological, faunal, and agricul- tural data) from Tel Gerisa and the above-mentioned sites as a data base, the following questions are asked: 1) Do the evolutionary and revolutionary changes indicated archaeo- logically substantiate hypotheses concerning social change in the region? 2) Do such changes substantiate hypotheses concerning economic change in the region? 3) What may be the connection between the earlier evolutionary and the later revolutionary change? 4) How does this regional pat- tern of change fit into the larger geographic context of the Levant? Tentative conclusions are drawn. First, the archaeologi- cal evidence substantiates hypotheses of social change only in the later transition while substantiating economic change at both times. Second, such a pattern of change is best ex- plained by placing it within the broader Levantine context rather than by drawing historical connections between the two periods. The excavations at Tel Gerisa and in the Yar- kon region in general are significant in revealing a variety of local adaptations to more widely felt changes. The simple questions asked here point the way to future research link- ing individual sites first to their local partners and then to the archaeological history of the Levant in general. HISTORICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE TEL GERISA EXCAVATIONS: Anson F. Rainey, Tel Aviv University The four seasons of excavation at Tel Gerisa (Tell el- Jerisheh) have provided new information on the occupa- tional history of the site. These new details require a reap- praisal of some commonly held theories about the modern Yarkon River Basin (Nahr el-'Awja). First, it is now clear that the site was established as a fortified center in the Mid- dle Bronze IIA period as attested by rooms adjoining the city wall with whole MB IIA vessels sitting on the floor. This places Tel Gerisa in the line of new "sea ports" that sprang up in the early second millennium B.C. along the coast of Canaan. Second, the absence of any Iron Age occupation be- yond a small farm complex on the corner of the tell elimi- nates Tel Gerisa from consideration as a candidate for a known biblical site. The local ecology and the ancient sources show that the so-called Tribal Inheritance of Dan (Josh. 19:40-48) must be located farther to the south and that the names of the nearby streams (modern Ayalon and Yarkon) are misnomers. By correcting the false notion that Tel Gerisa could be identified with ancient Gath-rimmon, it becomes possible to make a more balanced appraisal of the settlement pattern and the ecological adaptation of the pop- ulation along the Ayalon and Sorek basins: coordination may be achieved among the soil and drainage factors, the archaeological site distribution, and the ancient written sources from the Late Bronze and Iron Ages. CANCELLI FROM PELLA OF THE DECAPOLIS: Robert Houston Smith, The College of Wooster Excavations conducted at Pella, Jordan, in recent years by the Wooster-Sydney Joint Expedition to Pella have brought to light approximately a dozen marble chancel screens dating from the fifth and sixth centuries. The screens were all undoubtedly associated with the city's churches, even though most of them were not found in their primary contexts. While some of the screens were recovered largely intact, others had survived only in isolated fragments which required careful analysis in order that their designs could be reconstructed. The quality of both the marble, which was mostly imported from Asia Minor, and the carv- ing, is excellent. The screens range in style from traditional Roman open- work imbrication to solid panels with bas-reliefs that de- picted Christian motifs or texts. Some of the designs are con- ventional for the period, such as birds, sheep, crosses, and floral motifs, but one important screen displays distinctive symbols that have already begun to be the subject of consid- erable interest. The most convincing interpretation of the design draws upon Roman mosaic motifs as well as Chris- tian theology, but not, as has been proposed, Jewish sym- bolism. The question of the interpretation of the patterns is of particular interest because of the establishment of Chris- tianity at Pella as early as A.D. 67 by refugees from Jeru- salem during the First Jewish Revolt. An interesting aspect of the late history of these screens is evidence of an early phase of the Christian iconoclastic movement which resulted</page><page sequence="43">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 309 in the mutilation of some of the designs during the late sev- enth or early eighth century. The quality and variety of designs of these screens make this relatively large corpus one of the most important yet reported in the eastern Mediterranean world. HIGHLIGHTS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH AT SAR- DIS IN 1986: Crawford H. Greenewalt, jr., Univer- sity of California, Berkeley Excavation at Sardis in 1986 focused on two regions of the city site. On a spur (sector "ByzFort") that projects from the north flank of the Acropolis, another segment of Archaic terrace wall shows that the terrace enclosed an area of 2?/2 acres; Roman features on the spur summit included what appears to be a regional castellum aquae. Further west, at the foot of the Acropolis, excavation clarified the form but not the function of a massive feature built in the late seventh or early sixth century B.C. against the coursed brick and stone of Colossal Lydian Structure: sloping layers of sand and clay 30 m. wide that still stand 9 m. high and extend more than 13 m. beyond the face of coursed construction. On the other side of the Structure was exposed more of the Lyd- ian occupation zone that had been buried ca. 550 B.C. under fallen debris from the Structure: two rooms with an inter- mediate open space. Resting on their floor surfaces were some 200 complete or nearly complete artifacts of metal and pottery (including a vase in the shape of a duck and another in the shape of a boat, richly decorated in an orientalizing style) and articulated parts of a mature human skeleton. One room yielded over 4 kg. of raw glass and a few items of worked glass (notably two intricate beads). Study of material recovered in earlier seasons led to the discovery of two more bone roundels decorated in a nomadic animal style of the seventh or sixth century B.C., and clari- fied the text of an inscription on stone recording asylum limits of the Sanctuary of Artemis of Sardis as established by Julius Caesar on 4 March 44 B.C. "MIDAS' BED" AND A ROYAL PHRYGIAN FUNERAL: Elizabeth Simpson, Metropolitan Museum of Art Tumulus MM at Gordion, Turkey, excavated by the University of Pennsylvania in 1957, covered the burial of a powerful Phrygian ruler of the eighth century B.C., very likely Midas or his predecessor. The skeleton lay on the re- mains of a deteriorated wood structure, which the tomb's excavator, R.S. Young, thought was a four-poster bed. Young's "bed" had a headboard, footboard, planks, rails, and tall posts fitted into square blocks at the corners. Young's description of the "bed" along with reconstruction drawings based on his description were published posthu- mously (R.S. Young, The Gordion Excavations Final Re- ports I [Philadelphia 1981] 187-90). In 1981, the remains of the "bed" were found at Gordion and moved to the Ankara Museum for study. The largest fragment, the "headboard," was peculiarly shaped, ending in a curved, sloping surface. The iron bar supposed to have supported it was instead an- chored to its face with nails. This fragment could not have been a headboard, and the "bed" was not a bed. But what it was was not immediately apparent; nor did a study of the pieces' arrangement in the tomb indicate how they had fit together. It was finally the shapes of the pieces themselves which suggested their proper reconstruction. The bed was in fact an uncovered log coffin: the "headboard" and "foot- board" were horizontal ledges projecting from both ends, with iron bars fastened to their faces to keep the log from splitting. The corner blocks were cut as wedges, fitting up against the coffin's rounded body for support. Rails fit into the coffin's sides. Young's corner posts were found to be chunks of wood which had broken from the coffin's body when it collapsed. The placement of the pieces in the tomb indicated that the coffin had been disassembled and its parts placed separately on the floor of the chamber. Thus, the coffin had been assembled first outside the tomb, the king lying in state in a funeral ceremony. The tomb's rich con- tents can then be viewed in this context, with the furniture, bronze vessels, and remains of food almost certainly indi- cating a funerary banquet. I have now reconstructed the cof- fin in drawings, and it is scheduled for conservation in 1987. NOTES ON IRANIAN DRESS IN THE ACHAEMENID PE- RIOD: David Stronach, University of California, Berkeley The complexities and ambiguities of Iranian dress in the Achaemenid period continue to inspire contending interpre- tations. Not the least difficulty comes from the very dispar- ate nature of the available evidence. Indigenous clues from Iran are frequently at variance with those that stem from such culturally distinct lands as Egypt, Anatolia, and Greece. In addition, the surviving evidence can be seen to derive from a remarkable range of artistic media including stone reliefs, stone sculpture, metal plaques and statuettes, glazed bricks, wall paintings, painted pottery, terracottas, seals, gems, coins, and even textiles. The inherent variables of scale, stylization and/or shorthand combine to present not a few pitfalls. The overlapping evidence from contrasting cultural con- texts and from different artistic media can be used with care, however, to advance fresh interpretations concerning the much discussed construction of the full-length, richly pleated Persian robe. New considerations make it relatively difficult, moreover, to accept an earlier proposal that there may have been a distinct, variant form of the Persian robe that was reserved expressly for use in battle. Instead, the familiar pleated Persian garb probably had but one uniform kind of skirt. Even if the Achaemenid Persians were also accustomed to wear coats, knee-length belted tunics, and trousers (a costume commonly associated with the Medes), it is likely-on the extant evidence of reliefs and sealings from Persepolis-that the elegant parade dress of the king</page><page sequence="44">310 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 and his bodyguards could have been adjusted, at need, to meet the exigencies of combat. A NEWLY DISCOVERED EGYPTIAN TEMPLE FROM QASR IBRIM, NUBIA: Nettie K. Adams, University of Kentucky Since so many of the temples in the Nile Valley were con- verted into churches after the coming of Christianity, the sacred objects and furnishings of the temples were inevitably lost. However, excavations in 1986 by the Egypt Explora- tion Society at the fortress-city of Qasr Ibrim revealed a pre- viously unknown temple which contained many of its furn- ishings. Built probably during the eighth century B.C., it remained in use until sometime in the sixth century A.C., when Christianity first came to Nubia. Found scattered throughout the several rooms of the temple were pieces of deliberately smashed statues, fragments of quality faience and glass, and remains of temple furniture as well as textile fragments of extraordinary quality. Considered together, this assemblage is so unusual that we are postulating a de- struction of the temple and its contents during a brief, vio- lent episode. This paper will examine the temple and its contents and comparisons will be made to similar objects from other areas. This unique discovery makes a significant addition to our knowledge of the sacred objects and furnishings of tem- ples of the late period. Inferences can be drawn from these discoveries about the activities and rituals which occurred within the temple. All of the objects discussed in this paper are the property of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, and are located in the Cairo Museum. "THE KEEP OF THE TOMB" NEAR THEBES IN THE EGYPTIAN RAMESSIDE PERIOD: Andrea G. McDow- ell, University of Leiden The craftsmen who built the tombs of the New Kingdom pharaohs were housed in their own walled village, now known as Deir el-Medineh, not far from the Valley of the Kings where they worked. Many of the more interesting ad- ministrative and legal incidents in the history of the village took place at the htm n p3 hr, "the keep of the Tomb," which early scholars thought to be some sort of fortified structure guarding the royal tomb itself, mainly on the basis of its name. But it has become clear in the interim that the word for "tomb" also means "necropolis," both the extensive phys- ical area itself and the administration and staff of the necro- polis, so that "the keep of the Tomb" need not have been located near the royal sepulcher. Further, many of the activ- ities recorded at the htm could hardly have taken place in the Valley of the Kings: the htm was in the first place the loca- tion to which provisions and supplies for the villagers were delivered, where these were stored, and from which they were distributed. We would expect such a supply depot to be as close as possible to the village itself. No traces which could plausibly fit such a complex have been found near Deir el-Medineh, but the meticulous excavations at the cor- responding workmen's village at Amarna have revealed just such an installation directly in front of the entrance to the village. Further, a newly published text evidently records the relative elevation of the sacred lake of the Ramesseum and the htm n p3 hr: this can plausibly be interpreted to mean that the htm was ca. 26 m. higher than the Rames- seum, or just outside the entrance to the valley in which Deir el-Medineh lies, as we would have expected. This would also have been a natural point of arrival for outside visitors, who are often said to have come to the htm. The large open area in or near the htm where the workmen could have as- sembled, its function as administrative headquarters, and the fact that it was visited by outside authorities all made it a suitable location for legal and administrative activity. SESSION V C: PRE-ROMAN ITALY THE EVOLUTION OF THE CORBELED DOME IN SAR- DINIAN NURAGHI: Lenore Gallin, University of Cali- fornia, Los Angeles A detailed architectural analysis of 105 nuraghi reveals new knowledge regarding the development and construction of corbeled domes in prehistoric Sardinia. Stylistic similari- ties between the Mycenaean tholos tombs and Sardinian nu- raghi have been attributed by some to the influence of Greece on ancient Sardinian architecture. Recent evidence regarding the different shapes of the Mycenaean tholos and the Nuragic cupola is thought by others to indicate inde- pendent invention (Cavanagh and Laxton, BAR Interna- tional Series 245 [1985] 413-33). Findings of the U.C. Sar- dinian Nuraghi Project reveal, however, that significant variation in dome shape also exists among the nuraghi themselves. These variations appear to be dependent on stone type, masonry techniques, overall size of the structure, and regional and aesthetic building traditions. Corbeling is an essentially simple technique, widely used in buildings of both simple and complex nature throughout Europe and the Mediterranean. It would therefore seem more instructive to study the development of corbeling within a specific cultural context rather than to search for the original source of the idea. Accordingly, this study has 1) documented incipient corbeling in the "corridor nuraghi," a purportedly Archaic Nuragic structure lacking a cupola; 2) identified nuraghi in which corbeled domes have been constructed on top of corri- dor-like structures; and 3) documented certain nuraghi with combined features of both the "corridor" and "cupola" types within a single, original building. Based on exhaustive field- work and extensive data collection over four consecutive field seasons, it appears that successive elaboration of indig- enous Sardinian architectural strategies was elemental in the evolution of the Nuragic cupola.</page><page sequence="45">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 311 Two MIDDLE BRONZE AGE SITES IN THE TERRITORY OF AGRIGENTO: Giuseppe Castellana and Brian E. McConnell, Soprintendenza Archeologica di Agri- gento Research by the Archaeological Superintendency of Agri- gento has brought to light two sub-coastal Middle Bronze Age sites-one in the basin of the river Salso (locality Gaffe, Licata), the other in the basin of the river Platani (locality Castello, Ribera). The first site is a settlement occupied as early as the Cop- per Age with an extensive horizon of the Early Bronze Age Castelluccian culture. To the Middle Bronze Age Thapsos culture may be attributed the erection of a circular hut al- most 5 m. in diameter. Under the collapse of the structure there were found several large ceramic vases including a large basin on a high pedestal. The second site is a vast necropolis where, along a rocky cliff in which there are also excavated oven-shaped tombs of the Copper Age, one finds a group of tholos tombs of the Middle Bronze Age. Three tombs are especially interesting for their architecture which reflects an early moment in the cultural relations between Sicily and the Minoan-Myce- naean world. The Middle Bronze Age burials are related to several settlements which also have been identified in the immediate neighborhood. The exploration of the village at Gaffe and the necropolis at Ribera enlarges our awareness of the culture of the Mid- dle Bronze Age in Sicily, known from excavations at Thap- sos (Syracuse) and from an early excavation in the locality of Cannatello near Agrigento, in the territory where tradition locates the saga of Daedalus, Minos, and Kokalos, King of the Sicans. "NEw" ETRUSCAN TEXTS FROM A 16TH-CENTURY (A.C.) MANUSCRIPT: Ingrid D. Rowland, Univer- sity of California, Los Angeles An unpublished Vatican manuscript, the Historia senen- sium of the Renaissance Italian cleric Sigismondo Tizio, be- gins with a comprehensive history of the Etruscans, the val- ue of which is immensely increased by the inclusion of sever- al genuine Etruscan texts. These in turn are accompanied by brief descriptions of their provenance. A later 16th-cen- tury apograph of this small corpus (London, Sloane MS 3524, 1552) was published by O. A. Danielsson in 1928 ("Etruskische Inschriften in handschriftlicher Uberliefer- ung," Skrifter utgivna av K. Humanistiska Vetenskaps- Samfundet i Uppsala 25:3, Uppsala/Leipzig 1928), yet se- veral of the inscriptions recorded by Tizio are still not in- cluded in the standard Etruscan lexicon. Since Danielsson's publication, the state of Etruscan studies, including under- standing of the language, has progressed appreciably, so that the great Swedish scholar's reading may now be sup- plemented-or in some cases modified-by new evidence. In light of our more extensive command of an Etruscan voca- bulary, I propose readings of inscriptions so garbled by Ti- zio as to compel Danielsson to declare them illegible. The Historia senensium also includes a lexicon of purported Etruscan words, compiled in part from ancient glosses, whose composition merits attention. THE MOVEMENT OF COINAGE IN ETRURIA CA. 400- 200 B.C.: NEW DATA: Paolo Vison&amp;i, University of Notre Dame A systematic survey of museum collections in Tuscany, Umbria, and Latium, and the numismatic evidence from the excavations at Gravisca (1969-1979) integrate the results of a recent study of distribution patterns of Etruscan and for- eign coinage in Etruria (see P. Visonfi, in W. Heckel and R. Sullivan eds., Ancient Coins of the Graeco-Roman World. The Nickle Numismatic Papers, [Waterloo 1984] 221-40). In particular, the discovery at Gravisca of an Archaic Gor- goneion fraction of Populonia, associated with fifth and fourth century B.C. pottery, supports an early dating for the beginning of Populonia's silver coinage (cf. I. Krauskopf, SNR 64 [1985] 68-69). Apart from those of Populonia, which are most frequently found thoughout the region, other Etruscan issues had a more limited circulation. The majority of all foreign coinage from Etruria and the Ager Faliscus down to the Second Punic War consists of Cam- panian silver and bronze coins (especially of Cales and Nea- polis), which arrived with the Roman conquest, and of early and pre-sextantal Roman Republican bronze issues. Finds of Roman silver currency prior to 200 B.C. remain conspic- uously rare. Carthaginian coins also reached several Etrus- can sites between the fourth and the late third centuries B.C. Nearly all of them were minted before the Second Punic War, and their presence in Etruria is unrelated to the mili- tary events of that conflict. The coin finds from Gravisca corroborate these conclusions. It is now possible to corre- late the numismatic data from different excavated sites, and to document more fully the pace of the Romanization of Etruria. EXCAVATIONS AT LA PIANA, 1974-1986: Jane K. Whitehead, Reed College The excavated area of La Piana, an Etruscan habitation of the Hellenisitc period, has more than doubled in two years, since the "lost grid" of the 1974 sounding has been found and coordinated with that of our 1982-1986 seasons. A clearly monumental structure has emerged, whose un- mortared foundation walls are a meter thick and whose rooms are up to 10 m. wide. The structure does not appear to conform fully to any of the known typologies of Etruscan buildings. Its main axis consists of at least six rooms arranged in a line running roughly east-west. Neither end of this axis of rooms has been determined, however, so that the number may not con-</page><page sequence="46">312 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 form to the Etruscan predilection for multiples of three, not- ed at Acquarossa (Ostenberg, Le case etrusche di Acquarossa [1976] 243). The axis of rooms at La Piana does not turn to form a right angle around a courtyard as occurs both at Pog- gio Civitate and in the monumental building in Zone F at Acquarossa. Instead, rooms occur in parallel fashion on both sides of the main line. On the south side, a road separates this building from another, less substantial structure or group of structures about 35 m. to the southwest. A close scrutiny of the foundation walls at La Piana has revealed how they were bonded with the a graticcio super- structure. Shallow drill holes along both edges of the foun- dation wall surface suggest that they supported two parallel wattle membranes packed with daub. The site may have been abandoned at the end of the se- cond century B.C., to judge from a silver coin of Populonia found in the building. Other finds indicate contact with Vol- terra and Chiusi. La Piana flourished exclusively in the Hellenistic period; it is thus a rarity among Etruscan habi- tation sites heretofore excavated. A REGIONAL STYLE IN ARCHAIC GREEK ARCHITEC- TURE: Barbara A. Barletta, University of Florida Doric architecture of the Archaic period exemplifies se- veral regional variations. One of these has been recognized in the Achaian colonies of South Italy, which include Paes- tum, Metapontion, Sybaris, and probably Foce del Sele. Al- ready in the late 19th century, 0. Puchstein found evidence of a local tradition in the leaf necking of Doric capitals from Paestum. Because this necking recalled the leaf decoration of some Mycenaean pieces, he suggested a derivation from Bronze Age prototypes. Since that time, the list of character- istics of this "Achaian" style has been expanded, most signi- ficantly by D. Mertens. Mertens identified distinctive fea- tures in the architecture of these South Italian colonies and noted the existence of some of the same elements in the Pelo- ponnesos. Like earlier scholars, he argued for an origin in mainland Greece. This paper expands upon previous research and offers a different interpretation. By tracing the full geographical dis- tribution of traits associated with this style, I demonstrate that they are by no means confined to the Achaian colonies and the Peloponnesian homeland. Rather, they appear as well in northwestern Greece, elsewhere in South Italy, and even in Sicily. Furthermore, the evidence from chronology suggests that most of these features originate outside the Peloponnesos. The half-column is found earlier in the West. This is true also of the prostyle building form, although that plan may be adopted from still another region. Even the leaf necking arguably appears first at Corfu. I suggest, then, that this "Achaian" style should not be viewed as a fully devel- oped importation from the Peloponnesos to a small area of western Greece. Instead, it represents a distinctive tradition which evolved in several different locations in the western part of the Greek world and became incorporated into the repertoire of cities throughout that region. THE ARCHAIC COINAGE OF SELINUS: Carmen Arnold- Biucchi, The American Numismatic Society A die study of the Archaic coinage of Selinus does not exist to this day. C. Kraay's book The Archaic Coinage of Himera (Naples 1984) can serve as a stimulus and a model. Both cities issued very similar coinages and, after Himera, Selinus was probably the most important Sicilian mint in the sixth century B.C. A corpus of its coins should reveal much of interest about the history of the city and its trade. Excavations are now being undertaken on the site and a study of the coins will complement their results. My preliminary report includes coins in major collections (New York, London, Paris, Berlin, Copenhagen, etc.) and coins published in auction and sale catalogues. New materi- al has come to light in recent years and as far as possible it will be incorporated. Enough die-linkage has already been determined to allow a tentative relative chronology. The Ar- chaic coinage consists of two main phases: the first has on the reverse an incuse square divided diagonally into 12, 10, or, more rarely, 8 triangles. The second phase adds a reverse type, the selinon or parsley leaf, which is the constant type of the obverse. The absolute chronology is not easy to establish: the terminus ante quem for the Archaic coinage is around 480 B.C. when Selinus sided mistakenly with the Cartha- ginian invader and was defeated. The hoard evidence is scant for this period; it seems to indicate that the first group with the incuse reverse came to an end around 515/510 B.C. A study of the metrology will clarify the weight standard used, which is assumed to be derived from that of Corinth. THE PANTANELLO NECROPOLIS EXCAVATIONS 1982- 1986: Joseph Coleman Carter, Jr., University of Texas at Austin The excavation of the Pantanello necropolis began in 1982 with the chance discovery of 26 tombs in a former olive grove. It has come to a successful conclusion with the inten- sive campaign of 1986. The total number of tombs stands at 359. The significance of this discovery is manifold: 1) It is the largest necropolis of the Classical period to have been ex- cavated at a major Greek colonial center, using modern cri- teria. The tombs in fact cover a 300-year span, 575 to 275 B.C. 2) The human skeletal material has been the object of intensive anthropological study. This is a rare occurrence and it has never before been undertaken in Magna Graecia with a population of this size. The excavation has aimed at completeness, and this gives the statistical study of variables such as age, sex, blood type, pathologies, and "wealth" a firm basis. 3) A surprisingly large number of the tombs con- tain works of art of the highest quality. This year's discover- ies include perhaps the single finest vase from Metaponto, a pelike by the Nikoxenos Painter (ca. 510 B.C.) from T-292. There is a lekythos by the Berlin Painter (T-206), and the only known example of an engraved Greek mirror from a Southern Italian colony. It represents the Death of Actaeon and dates about 440 B.C. (T-350). 4) The necropolis, which</page><page sequence="47">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 313 is divided into 15 family nuclei, can convincingly be associ- ated with the rural population of the chora. It lies 3.5 km. outside the city, around the intersection of a major road and a minor one serving as a "division line" of the territory. SESSION V D: COLLOQUIUM: MARBLE QUARRYING IN THE ROMAN WORLD: TRADE, TECHNOLOGY AND ARCHAEO- LOGY THE TECHNOLOGY OF QUARRYING: Tony Kozelj, Ecole Franpaise, Athens This paper covers all aspects of quarry technology: the ex- traction, preparation, and transport of blocks; the use of wooden platforms and scaffolding in quarries; cranes and other lifing devices; workshops in quarries (carpentry, black- smithing, and tool repair); the use and disposal of overburden and debris; and coping with water in the quarry. Consid- erable attention will be paid also to the disposition, housing, and cult places of the work force and of the contingents of sol- diers on guard duty. The nomenclature of buildings, places, and organizational units will also be examined. Examples and illustrations will be drawn from the fol- lowing sites: Alexandria, Mareotis, Mons Claudianus, and Assuan in Egypt; Thasos, Naxos, Paros, Euboea, Skyros, Aegina, and Delphi in Greece; and Paphos and Fontana Amorosa on Cyprus. PATTERNS OF EXTRACTION AND PRODUCTION: THE WHITE MARBLE QUARRIES OF THE MEDITERRA- NEAN: Marc Waelkens, Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research As part of a large sampling program in the white marble quarries around the Mediterranean (1984-1986) for prove- nance determination of ancient artifacts, much evidence was gathered concerning methods of extraction and all other ac- tivities in the quarries themselves. The program covered the main quarries of Italy, Greece, and Turkey. The quarries range in date from the Archaic to the Byzantine period. This paper deals with the different methods of extraction that were observed and with the problems of dating them, as well as with patterns of production and marketing which seem to have occurred all over the Mediterranean. THE CARBON AND OXYGEN ISOTOPIC DATA BASE FOR CLASSICAL MARBLE: Norman Herz, University of Georgia An isotopic data base of delta'3C and deltat8O analyses of 528 samples from 39 Classical Greek and Roman marble quarries of Turkey, Greece, Italy, and Tunisia has now been accumulated. The data base, which includes both pub- lished and unpublished information, is the most powerful tool now available for assigning provenance to Classical marble artifacts. The discriminative possibilities of the data base vary from quarry to quarry. Most quarries have a distinctive pat- tern for one or both variables, but a few have more than one grouping. The data also overlap for some quarries, prevent- ing a unique provenance assignment. If the alternatives are known so that the total pool of possible sources is reduced; then the data base can discriminate and make a provenance assignment with a high degree of confidence. Stable isotopic ratios have also proven invaluable in as- sembling broken fragments of statuary and inscriptions and in determining if a weathering patina is natural or artificial- ly produced. MARBLE ORIGINS BY ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS: RECENT WORK AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM: Susan Walker, British Museum Our data base of quarry samples has been improved by the addition of new data kindly supplied by Prof. N. Herz, and by new quarry samples submitted for analysis by Dr. M. Waelkens. We have also refined the definition of the iso- topic signatures of various quarries and the method of as- signing the results of analyses of sculptures to them, in both cases by the use of linear and/or quadratic discriminant analysis. Within the collections of the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities, work has advanced on the analysis of sculptural and architectural decoration of the Mausoleum at Halikarnassos, and upon the characterization of Roman sarcophagi. We aim to characterize the use of different mar- bles for various functions within the Mausoleum, to deter- mine where possible the origins of these marbles, and ulti- mately to assign unidentified fragments to known groups. A noteworthy distinction has emerged between the marbles used for the freestanding sculptures and the Chariot frieze, and those used for architectural elements and the Centauro- machy and Amazonomachy friezes. It would appear that Phrygian marble from Dokimeion was used for some of the large freestanding sculptures and possibly also for the Char- iot frieze. The architectural marbles appear to be from southwest Asia Minor. Although it is possible to discern groups related to architectural function, it may prove impos- sible to identify the sources of these marbles, which are iso- topically very similar. Most of the Roman sarcophagi in the collections may be assigned to one of the four main sources of marble used in the production of sarcophagi: Prokonnesos, Dokimeion, Pentelikon, and Carrara. The results support observations made on iconographical grounds of the similarity of early sarcophagi made in Athens and Phrygia. Hollowed-out and undecorated Prokonnesian sarcophagi were imported in large numbers to Rome, where they received decoration of local derivation. A Phrygian columnar sarcophagus sent to Rome was also apparently finished according to local, not Asiatic, preference.</page><page sequence="48">314 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 SCULPTURE FROM CYRENE IN ITS MEDITERRANEAN CONTEXT: Susan Kane, Oberlin College Cyrene, throughout its long history (sixth century B.C.- fourth century A.C.), imported marble for both its sculpture and, in the Roman period, for its architecture as well. Since marble is not native to the Cyrenaican region, the quality and quantity of the marble sculpture found in the city are a reflection of its prosperous economy. Identification of the provenance of the marbles used in Cyrene has been greatly aided by stable isotope analysis. In addition to the analyses of white marble from sculpture found in the extramural Sanctuary of Demeter, others have been done recently on a group of works (now in the British Museum) from 19th-century excavations in the city. These results have provided new evidence to amplify current knowledge of Cyrene's commercial connections in the an- cient Mediterranean. As might be expected, a large percentage of the marbles are from Greece and the Aegean islands. The quarries of Paros, Thasos, and Penteli especially are well represented. The frequent use of Pentelic marble in works of the second century A.C. corroborates known iconographic, stylistic, and historical connections with Athens during the Antonine period. A city of Greek character even during the Roman period, Cyrene's chief cultural and commercial ties were al- ways with the eastern Mediterranean. Hence the presence of marble from the Carrara quarry in Italy is the more sur- prising. This marble is used typically in works from the late second and third centuries A.C. and may reflect the Severan dynasty's interest in the economic revitalization of its native North Africa. ROMAN STATUARY AND THE SUPPLY OF STATUARY MARBLES: Amanda Claridge, British School at Rome A prevalent feature of marble statuary in the Late Hel- lenistic period and the Early Empire is the practice of join- ing-of making a statue out of more than one piece of stone. Various explanations have been offered for the practice, de- pending on the particular nature of the joins, but the cause appears to have been a shortage in the supply of sizeable blocks of high-quality marble. The incidence of joining in all its forms drops off towards the end of the first century A.C., and from the early second century A.C. onwards monolithic statuary becomes increasingly the norm. In addi- tion to reflecting the growing success of Roman quarrying, the rise of monolithic statuary brings into question the tradi- tional approach of modern scholarship to the history of fig- ure-types (Kopienforschung). SESSION V E: WALL PAINTING AND MO- SAICS THE INTERIOR DECORATION OF THE HOUSES OF MOR- GANTINA: Barbara Tsakirgis, Vanderbilt University Discussion of the interior decoration of Hellenistic houses in the Western Mediterranean has often been confined to examples of mosaics and wall paintings from the Campa- nian towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum. While well de- serving comment, these Italian-influenced examples of inte- rior decor can be replaced by the Hellenistic interiors from Morgantina in central Sicily. Morgantina was certainly a dependent of Syracuse in the third century B.C., and the Morgantinian architectural and decorative remains must reflect contemporaneous Syracusan models. Because of the absence of extensive excavated remains of Syracusan houses, the Morgantinian houses serve as good evidence for Western Greek decorative arts. The better pavements of the Morgantinian houses are ei- ther terrazzo or mosaic. The terrazzo floors are made of limestone chips, instead of marble, because of the absence of the latter on Sicily. The third-century mosaics are of a tran- sitional style, described by K. Phillips (ArtB 42 [1960]). The square tesserae are combined with stones cut to specific shapes. The second- and first-century mosaics are true tes- selated mosaics. A specifically western type of pavement, cocciopesto or opus signinum, is by far the most common form of flooring at Morgantina. Cocciopesto is found in ser- vice as well as in formal rooms. The cocciopesto is often en- livened by inset tesserae and, in one instance, the tesserae are cut to specific shapes, the petals of a rosette, a technique analogous to that of the transitional mosaics. Wall painting at Morgantina belongs to the First, or Ma- sonry Style (following V. Bruno, AJA 73 [1969]), and to the early Second Style. Rooms with terrazzo floors or transi- tional mosaics have associated painting of the Masonry Style. The true tesselated floors are accompanied by either First or Second Style painting. The style of painting helps to determine the date of the associated floor. A MOSAIC EMBLEMA FROM THE SITE 10 VILLA ON THE VIA GABINA: Walter M. Widrig, Rice University Although much more has been learned during the last two seasons of excavation about the economic role of the Ro- man suburban villa at Site 10 on the Via Gabina, the 1986 discovery of an extraordinary mosaic emblema in the pave- ment of the villa's andron takes precedence over all other considerations. This paper is the first public announcement of the find now undergoing meticulous cleaning at the Mu- seo Nazionale in Rome. Often works of ancient art lack an excavation context. Here the context is complete. The andron of the villa, a per- fect square in plan, dates from the villa's first phase, the early Augustan period. The mosaic emblema is also a per- fect square measuring 59.5 x 59.5 cm. without its border. We think this relationship proves that the introduction of the small panel is contemporary with the construction of the room. Pottery sherds from under the seal of the emblema</page><page sequence="49">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 315 reinforce this belief. Nevertheless, because the tesserae, often only pinhead in size, are set in an easily transportable tile tray, it is unlikely the mosaic was executed in situ. Therefore, questions of date, even origin, still remain. The subject of the emblema is the Rape of Hylas, a myth stemming from the Hellenistic period. The style of render- ing and general composition also appear Hellenistic. Per- haps we have found R. Ling's (MEFRA 91 [1979] 773- 816) hypothesized Hellenistic prototype for the several Pompeian representations of this unusual myth. A UNIQUE ALEXANDRIAN PAINTED TOMB RECONSID- ERED: Marjorie Susan Venit, University of Mary- land In 1960 a tomb with a unique series of paintings was un- covered in the western necropolis of ancient Alexandria. The decoration of the tomb includes paintings of a herm in a sacred enclosure, a shepherd and his flock, a nude male re- clining under a pergola, an Egyptian soul bird, and the sole extant ancient depiction of a sahkieh-an Egyptian water wheel. The tomb was published by H. Riad (Archaeology 17 [1964] 169-72; BSRAA 42 [1967] 89-96), who placed it in the Late Ptolemaic/Early Roman period. More recently J. Weitzmann-Fiedler (Age of Spirituality, New York 1979) and A. Barbet (Clio [1980] 391-400) have each identified the monument as a Christian tomb of fourth century A.C. date. Evidence overlooked or ignored by Weitzmann-Fiedler and Barbet is presented to discount their Christian date and context for the painted tomb. Classical subject matter (such as the herm) is virtually absent from Early Christian tombs in Alexandria and elsewhere in Egypt, and Egyptian iconogra- phy (such as the soul bird) is almost entirely unknown. In ad- dition, the reclining male and the shepherd interpreted by the authors as Christian can be shown to be entirely Classical. Without a thorough study of all the tombs of Alexandria, it is perhaps premature to date the painted tomb too closely, but is is suggested that both the style and the iconographical program of the tomb may permit an even earlier date than had hitherto been proposed. SESSION V F: COLLOQUIUM: ASPECTS OF ROMAN GLASSMAKING CLASSIFYING HELLENISTIC AND ROMAN CAST MOSAIC- GLASSES: David F. Grose, Smith College A fundamental stumbling block to the study of cast mo- saic-glass tablewares and containers of the Hellenistic and Roman periods is the difficulty in attributing specific styles to specific workshops and periods of production. This prob- lem stems in large measure from an inadequate system of describing and classifying the various cane patterns and in identifying the subtle differences present in the mosaic canes of each major period. In making these distinctions, close at- tention must be paid to the manufacturing techniques em- ployed in fabricating individual cane designs and in assem- bling canes into vessels. Based on an exhaustive study of excavated mosaic-glass from Hellenistic and Roman sites in western Asia, the Mediterranean region, and Europe, coupled with a compar- ative study of ancient mosaic glass in European and Ameri- can museum collections, it is now possible to propose a clas- sification system for most cane patterns. These include net- work (also called lace or reticelli), striped, goldband, color- band, marbled, and a rich assortment of composite mosaic designs. In creating this typology, distinctive styles of can- ing, colors, cane configurations, color combinations, and pe- culiarities of manufacturing technique have been taken into consideration. Such a system permits a tentative reconstruc- tion of the developmental history of each mosaic pattern. It also isolates the products of each principal period of mosaic production: namely, vessels manufactured in the eastern Mediterranean during the mid- and late Hellenistic Ages; wares fashioned by the prolific Romano-Italian industry under Augustus and the Julio-Claudians; and, finally, the output of a previously unknown revival of the mosaic tech- nique in late Imperial times. THE ORIGINS OF GLASSBLOWING: Mary R. DeMaine, University of Minnesota The discovery that glass can be blown revolutionized glassmaking in the ancient world. Whereas the techniques used to form glass vessels before blowing were time-consum- ing, difficult, and expensive, thus limiting the repertoire of shapes and the number of vessels produced, with the advent of glassblowing, the cost of production decreased substan- tially, while the possibilities for variation expanded corre- spondingly. As a result of these changes, the volume and repertoire of glass vessels increased after the invention of glassblowing to such a degree that, today, blown glass frag- ments often comprise a sizable percentage of the finds recov- ered from many excavations. It has long been maintained that the discovery of glass- blowing took place in Syria and Palestine in the mid- or later first century B.C., and was rapidly disseminated to Italy and other parts of the Roman Empire. This paper re- views the latest evidence for the region and period in which glassblowing was practiced first. EARLY IMPERIAL MOLD-BLOWN GLASS CIRCUS CUPS: SOME PROBLEMS OF PRODUCTION, DATING, AND DISTRIBUTION: Jennifer Price, University of Leeds The discovery that decorated vessels could be made by blowing glass into molds quickly resulted in the widespread production of vessels with identical shapes and details of de- sign in the early years of the Roman Empire. Decorated mold-blown vessels first occur in contexts dated to the early first century A.C., and a considerable range of drinking cups, amphoriskoi, jugs, unguentaria, and other forms were</page><page sequence="50">316 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 made in this way during that century. Most mold-blown vessels were probably rather cheap, mass-produced versions of more expensive objects in metal, stone or glass, although exceptionally fine pieces were also produced, some of which carried the names of their makers. These vessels are particu- larly interesting to the archaeologist, as the products of dif- ferent molds can often be identified, even from quite small fragments. This enables their patterns of distribution to be traced, and their chronology to be examined, with more pre- cision than is usually possible in the study of Roman glass. This paper examines cylindrical drinking cups showing gladiatorial contests and chariot-racing. These Circus or Sports cups have the major design in one broad or two nar- row zones below the inscribed zone which gives the names of the contestants. The gladiator cups have one decorative zone showing four pairs of fighting gladiators, and the chariot- racing cups show four racing quadrigas in either one or two zones. These vessels, which were blown into a two-part body mold with separate base mold and were finished by cracking-off and grinding the rim, belong to one of the best- known groups of early Imperial mold-blown vessels. The distribution of cylindrical Circus cups differs from that of most other groups of mold-blown vessels, as it is con- fined to the western provinces, with noticeable concentra- tions in the Rhineland, Gaul, and Britain. Many molds were used to produce these vessels, and it is becoming in- creasingly obvious that the products of different molds are not distributed uniformly throughout the area in which cy- lindrical Circus cups are found, although the center of pro- duction of the various groups is still unknown. These cups are regularly found in Neronian and Flavian contexts, and may have been in production for only a com- paratively short time during the third quarter of the first century A.C. It is probable that there are slight differences in the date of manufacture of the products of various molds, although the chronology is obscured by the survival of frag- ments as keepsakes. PAINTED AND GOLD-SANDWICH GLASS: Susan H. Auth, The Newark Museum Often in the history of ancient glass a technique of aston- ishing virtuosity apparently disappears, only to surface again centuries later in a different geographical and social context. In the case of gold-glass, a technique developed first for the Alexandrian luxury-glass industry of Hellenistic times reappears briefly at Pompeii in a somewhat different form, and then is not seen again for two centuries. A third- century variant using gold thread instead of cut gold foil is widely distributed from Portugal to Hungary, while Egypt and perhaps Italy during the same century produced gold- glass portrait gems of the finest quality. The great bulk of the material consists of gold-glass vessel bases with various motifs-pagan, Christian and Jewish-many of which were embedded in the walls of the Roman catacombs in the late third-early fifth centuries. The considerable skills of the later practitioners suggest that the gold-glass technique was kept alive rather than re- discovered. Various hypotheses (traveling groups of glass- makers, an Egyptian fine jewelry tradition, the use of gold- glass in mosaics) are discussed, and the question of the social context of the later luxury glass is briefly considered. Glass painting, a related technique, is found on relatively few examples of widely varying style, provenance and time period. Dating to the first half of the first century, bowls and other shapes decorated with sketchy multicolored bird and floral designs have been found in North Italy, Greece, the Crimea, and North Africa. Beakers and bowls of the second and third centuries, painted with animal, gladiatorial, hunt, and mythological scenes, have come from Egypt, and as Egyptian exports, from Begram, Afghanistan. Another group of beakers, exported beyond the northern Imperial frontiers, was probably made at Cologne. Cyprus produced a group of cosmetic jar lids gold-painted with Eros and Aphrodite motifs. Related finds have come from Naha- riya. A combination of pigments and gold occurs on the Daphne ewer, perhaps from Antioch, and on the extraordi- nary blue glass drinking flutes from Meroitic Sedeinga, Su- dan, which have gilt and painted Egyptian scenes combined with Greek drinking mottoes. The literature is vague and sometimes contradictory on the question of whether unfired or fired pigments (as in later Islamic glasses) were used, and there is little discussion of the composition of the paints used. The discovery of these objects far from their probable places of manufacture points to the considerable problems in establishing glass decorating cen- ters or of determining whether it was the skilled glassworkers or their finished products which moved. Analysis of the paint on existing examples is needed, and excavators are urged to save even the smallest glass scraps for the clues which they may shed on some of these as yet unsolved problems. LABORATORY STUDIES OF AN OPUS SECTILE PANEL IN THE CORNING MUSEUM OF GLASS: Robert H. Brill, The Corning Museum of Glass In the mid-1960s a remarkable group of more than 100 glass panels made in the opus sectile technique was exca- vated at Kenchreai, the ancient eastern port of Corinth. Dated to ca. A.D. 370, the panels depict Homer, Plato, Theophrastus, and numerous views of Nilotic flora and fauna. Because the panels had been under water for some 16 centuries the glass was very heavily weathered and the pan- els were badly in need of conservation treatment. Shortly after excavation, extensive laboratory studies of the panels were conducted, including chemical analyses of the glass in- lays, isotope determinations on lead extracted from the glasses, petrographic examinations of the ceramic support- ing structure, chemical analysis of the adhesive matrix ma- terial, and radiocarbon dating of the rosin in that material. Fragments of a newly acquired glass opus sectile panel in the Corning Museum of Glass show the head of a man, Greek letters spelling out the name Thomas, and pieces of gold glass forming a Chi-Rho, the monogram of Christ. The Christian motif, the use of gold glass, certain stylistic fea- tures, and the fact that the glass is only lightly weathered all</page><page sequence="51">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 317 differentiate the panel from the Kenchreai group. The panel is constructed in a similar fashion, however, and is clearly of the same general type. Laboratory studies similar to those used in earlier research are being conducted to determine whether or not the Corning piece was made in the same gen- eral region, or possibly even in the same workshop, as the Kenchreai panels. It is hoped that the combined results may shed light on the origins of both this panel and the Ken- chreai pieces. THE PROVENANCE AND DATE OF A DISTINCTIVE GROUP OF LATE ROMAN OBJECTS: David White- house, The Corning Museum of Glass In 1954, Ray Winfield Smith drew attention to a distinc- tive group of head flasks and jugs, each of which has at least three of the following characteristics: the body is blown in a mold, the rim is everted and sprung, the base consists of a solid multiple coil, the handle is of "wishbone" form, and the glass is translucent deep blue. Smith recognized that a beaker or lamp and a shallow bowl, both of translucent deep blue glass, with sprung rim and mold-blown decoration, also belong to the group. Although the head flasks had been attributed to an Alexandrian workshop of the first century A.C., Smith argued that the group was late Roman, or later. Today, at least 20 objects are known to belong to the group. The majority are without provenance, but two (per- haps three) were found or acquired in Syria, two in the Cri- mea, and one each in Lebanon, Sudan, and South Korea. Thus, although the present distribution does not allow us to attribute the group to a specific city or region, it does suggest a place of manufacture in the eastern Mediterranean. Two of the objects were found in datable contexts: a jug and a cup or lamp. The jug was excavated from Tomb Q24 at Qustul in the Sudan, where it was associated with pottery of the late fourth century. The cup or lamp was found in Tomb 98N at Kongju in South Korea, which was used at the beginning of the sixth century. The characteristic sprung rim and solid multiple coiled foot occur on other vessels of the fourth and fifth centuries. I conclude, therefore, that the group was made at a single manufactory in the eastern Mediterranean, in the late fourth and early fifth centuries. SESSION VI A: THE ROMAN PROVINCES OCTAVIAN'S VICTORY MONUMENT AT NIKOPOLIS: William M. Murray, University of South Florida The Battle of Actium played a crucial role in the early propaganda of the principate, in its literature as well as its art. Numerous studies have focused on the Actian elements of this propaganda from Tarn's rejection of the biased his- torical tradition (JRS 1931) to H6lscher's study of figural scenes recalling the war (JdI 1984 and Klio 1985). Curious- ly, the earliest architectural expression of this propaganda, a victory monument dedicated by Octavian to Neptune and Mars in 29 B.C. on the site of his command post, has gone largely unnoticed for almost 75 years. Octavian's monu- ment, located in 1913 and partially excavated in 1974 (cf. Petsas, Prakt 1974), is known mainly for the content of its dedicatory inscription (cf. Carter, ZPE 1977). Far more im- portant than the inscription is a set of complicated nose- shaped cuttings in the retaining wall supporting the poorly preserved shrine. Here, according to numerous ancient testi- monia, was once displayed a selection of rams stripped from the captured fleet of Antonius. In order to determine the di- mensions of the monument and exact nature of the cuttings, an accurate survey was carried out in May 1986 by a team from the University of South Florida with the cooperation of the excavator, P. Petsas. We identified 26 cuttings along a 45 m.-stretch of wall (more may lie buried to the east), grad- ed in size from large to small (west to east). Strabo's report (7.7.6) that ships from "ones" to "tens" fought in the battle and were dedicated afterwards from the spoils may eventu- ally help to define the difference in sizes. But, for the pre- sent, this extraoridinary monument presents a clear exam- ple of an Augustan rostra display, provides direct dimen- sions for four or more sizes of warship bows, preserves the rear profiles of some 20 rams, and may hint at the composi- tion of Antonius' fleet. As such, its stands among the most important Augustan monuments yet found in Greece. JULIUS CAESAR, AUGUSTUS, AND THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE ROMAN AGORA AT ATHENS: Michael Hof, Boston University The Roman Agora at Athens has never had a full-scale publication. Moreover, little research has been done on its early history and connections with the politics of the later first century B.C. Past studies of the dedicatory inscription (IG II2, 3175) located on the western gateway of the Roman Agora have held that Julius Caesar donated the initial funds for construction in 47 B.C. Cicero (Att. 6.1.25) implies, however, that Caesar provided 50 talents to the Athenians for the building in late 51 or early 50 B.C. This is exactly the sum that Pompey had given to the city in 62 B.C. (Plut. Pomp 13.5), part of which was used for the reconstrucion of the Deigma in the Piraeus. The Deigma is also a type of market and it may not be coincidental that Caesar provided funds for a market building as an attempt to win Athenian support away from Pompey. If so, Caesar's efforts went un- rewarded as Athens fully supported the cause of Pompey in the Civil War, and it is suggested in this paper that Caesar may have confiscated the building funds in 47 B.C. as retri- bution for Athenian support of Pompey, only four years after his donation. The same dedicatory inscription records that Augustus also provided funds, certainly in order to finish construction of the Roman Agora. I suggest that Augustus donated the funds in 19 B.C. during a visit to Athens following his vic- tory over the Parthians. That same year also occasioned the erection of the Temple of Roma and Augustus on the Acro- polis. These constructions should be considered part of a reconciliation between Augustus and the Athenians over anti-Roman demonstrations which occurred in 21 B.C. This</page><page sequence="52">318 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 civil unrest resulted in Augustus imposing economic sanc- tions on the city as well as his spending the winter on Aegina as a display of anger towards the Athenians. I propose that the Roma and Augustus temple was therefore erected by the Athenians to placate Augustus and, in turn, the Emperor provided the necessary funds for the completion of the Ro- man Agora as a sign of his renewed goodwill toward the city. The Roman Agora was then finished and dedicated ca. 10 B.C. Though Caesar and Augustus are both mentioned in the dedicatory inscription, it is likely that the construction of the Roman Agora is primarily, if not entirely, Augustan. The Caesarian phase of four years, from 51 to 47 B.C., with the Civil War in the middle, appears too short a time for much construction to have taken place. INDVLGENTIAE AVGVSTI MONETA INPE- TRATA: A FLAVIAN EPISODE: Brooks Emmons Levy, Princeton University Library Only three examples survive of an exceptionally fine ses- tertius minted by Roman Patrae: Obv.: Female bust right; around, INDVLGENTIAE AVG(VSTI) MONETA IN- PETRATA; Rev.: Triumphal quadriga right; above, CAE- SARI/AVGVSTO; below, COL.A.A.P. This issue has drawn attention since the 17th century, both for its high quality, unusual in a provincial piece, and as evidence for the process by which Roman colonies received permission to coin-apparently by direct application to the princeps. It was first thought to be Augustan, then Tiberian (the bust of "Indulgentia" seems to be based on that of Tiberius' "Pietas" dupondii). More recently M. Grant has seen it as a Cali- gulan issue, commemorating the foundation of Patrae a half-century before and the permission to coin then granted (NC 1948, 115-20). But comparison with the surely dated coinage of Julio-Claudian Patrae suggests that the issue cannot be so early. A clue to date and occasion is provided by almost equally rare sestertii struck at Corinth under Domi- tian. These have on the reverse the legend PERM IMP, evidently referring to Domitian's restoration to Corinth of the minting privilege, removed from Achaean communities by Vespasian together with the "freedom" granted by Nero. Patrae's issue fits well here, for it has recently been shown that "indulgentia" became prominent as an imperial virtue only under Domitian (H. Cotton, Chiron 14 [1984] 245- 66). The reuse of Julio-Claudian coin designs is also typi- cally Flavian: both "Pietas" and the triumphal quadriga ap- pear on Flavian coinage struck at Rome. Redating Patrae's "Indulgentia" sestertius removes an important piece of evi- dence for the procedure by which Augustan colonies re- ceived their original permission to coin. It now seems un- likely that each one required specific authorization from the princeps. THE FINES OF ACHAIA AND MACEDONIA, CLAUDIUS PTOLEMAEUS, AND THAPEDON: W.J. Cherf, Kom- mission fUir Alte Geschichte und Epigraphik, Munich Much speculation has surrounded the location of the se- cond-century Roman provincial boundary between Mace- donia and Achaia. Current research in the Malian basin, however, has plausibly established it along the formidable Gorgop6tamos gorge. Such natural features that so constrict overland communications were usually crossed by roads with toll stations. Literary, topographical, and archaeologi- cal evidence suggest the identification of such a toll station near the gorge. Although the cartographical data within Ptolemy's Geo- graphia is generally inaccurate, the above boundary can still be divined by first noting the geographical features and cities that he assigned to Macedonia and Achaia (Geog. 3.12-14), and second, by locating between them a topographically sta- ble and unambiguous reference point. Given the continuous topographical alteration of the Malian basin, the Roman provincial administration apparently decided that the east- ern slopes of Mt. Oite could provide a suitable datum, which was relatively immutable and easily discernible by both land and sea-the Gorgop6tamos gorge. Ptolemy (Geog. 3.12.4) seems to have merely recorded this practical wisdom. In the ancient itineraries (Tab. Peut., Ravenna Geog., Guido), mention is made of an obscure road-station named Thapedon, located on the main north-south highway that coursed through the region. Road-stations for the collection of the portorium, or toll tax, were typically located at pro- vincial borders. In 1977, A.R. Burn speculated (in K.H. Kinzl, Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean, 98) that there could have been an ancient road in the vicinity of Gor- gop6tamos. Roman pottery sighted nearby further supports this possible location for Thapedon and thus the Gorgop6ta- mos gorge as a provincial boundary. THE SALUTARIS ENDOWMENT: IE Ia, 27 RECONSID- ERED: Guy M. Rogers, Wellesley College C. Vibius Salutaris (H. Devijver, Prosopographia mili- tiarum equestrium quae fuerunt ab Augusto ad Gallienum [Louvain 1977] U 106) endowed yearly distributions and lotteries during the celebration of the mysteries of Artemis at Ephesos and also a procession of 31 statues through the streets of the city in A.D. 104 (Die Inschriften von Ephesos Ia [Bonn 1979] 27). Topographical studies (especially W. Alzinger, "Koressos," Festschrift Eichler [Vienna 1967] 1-9) and publication of the epigraphical corpus of the city now clarify the purpose and significance of the endowment. A breakdown of the allotments to the groups of benefici- aries reveals the creation of a contemporary social hierarchy implicitly ratified by the boule, the demos, and the Roman proconsul. Youth associations occupied a prominent posi- tion in this hierarchy which validated Greek civic institu- tions above all. The procession of statues dramatized an identity of the city. According to the narrative theme of the procession, the identity of the city derived from successive foundation leg-</page><page sequence="53">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 319 ends, walked in reverse chronological order by the Ephebes. The procession taught the Ephebes that Ephesian identity began with Artemis, led to Augustus, Lysimachus, Andro- klos, and back to Artemis. The birth of Artemis at Ephesos remained central to the Ephesians' sense of their place in the Roman world. The link between the representations of a contemporary social hierarchy and a historical identity was the local and Greek perspective. Essentially, representations of the Ionian past "framed" the interpretation of the present (F. Millar, "P. Herennius Dexippus: The Greek World and the Third- Century Invasions," JRS 59 [1969] 12-29; E. Bowie, "Greeks and Their Past in the Second Sophistic," Past and Present 46 [1970] 3-41). Salutaris' endowment shows how Ephesians wished to represent their past and present to the youth associations of the city. Such local representations il- luminate how provincials perceived their roles within the city, the province, and the Empire. THE ROMAN ROAD SYSTEM OF ARABIA PETRAEA: David F. Graf, University of Miami Since the pioneering survey of Roman Arabia by Briin- now and Domaszewski, it has generally been assumed that the major artery of the road system, the Via Nova Traiana, bypassed the old Nabataean capital at Petra in connecting the port on the Gulf of Aqaba with Bostra in southern Syria. This view was based on the discovery of milestones at Udh- ruh and Ail, 15 km. east of Petra. Although a paved road accompanied with milestones was also found north of Petra, it was felt that this route was merely a branch road, a spur from the main east-west trade route between Petra and Ga- za on the Mediterranean. The fact that the third-century A.C. Peutinger Table included Petra on the official provin- cial route through the region represents a major difficulty for this hypothesis and new evidence offers support for the traditional ancient itinerary. Recent investigation of the region during the past several years has produced evidence for at least three main north- south routes connecting Petra with Humayma in the south. The proximity of castella, mansiones, and small settlements adjacent to these routes indicates that they were utilized during the Roman period. Along the edge of the al-Shera escarpment to the west, the Darb ar-Rasif, a bordered track, led from Humayma to Petra. Another route from Humay- ma proceeded almost directly across the plateau of the al- Shera range to Petra. Finally, at Sadaqa, another route pro- ceeded east to Ail, before diverging to Petra. Milestones along the second and third of these routes attest to their offi- cial use under Roman rule. The lack of such evidence be- tween Ail and Udhruh suggests that this route should be considered an alternative route, perhaps developed at a later time. The main routes connected the major settlements of Humayma, Sadaqa, and Petra, just as the Peutinger Table indicates. THE EXCHANGE OF ARCHITECTURAL IDEAS BETWEEN THE IBERIAN PENINSULA AND NORTH AFRICA DUR- ING THE FIRST AND SECOND CENTURIES A.C.: Wil- liam E. Mierse, College of the Holy Cross The first and second centuries A.C. saw a florescence of building in the Roman cities of North Africa. Among the structures were several temples of standard Graeco-Italic type. However, the Capitolium temple at Dougga, the for- um temple at Volubilis, and the temple of Roma and Augus- tus at Leptis Magna display unusual treatments in masonry technique, temenos-temple relationship, or temple design which owe their origin to provincial experiments from else- where. Both Ward-Perkins, Roman Imperial Architecture (Harmondsworth 1981) and A. Lezine, Carthage-Utique, etudes d'architecture et d'urbanisme (Paris 1968) have pointed to earlier Punic building traditions as the sources, suggesting a provincial Roman architecture which mixed Punic and Graeco-Italic elements. The hypothesis is no longer adequate. Recent Spanish archaeological work has revealed similar parallel features from earlier sanctuaries at Munigua, Clu- nia, and Vic on the Iberian peninsula. Some of the traits have a long history on Spanish soil dating back to the first century B.C. They were the products of a Roman provincial architectural development. The Spanish temples served as the models for the North African structures. The findings are significant in that they suggest a greater artistic interaction among the Western provincials during the first decades of the second century A.C. than had been assumed. They also give reason to suspect that the prestige of Greek and Italian models did not hold complete sway in the West. There was local provincial architectural creativity which was shared among the Western provincials without the involvement of the central government. THE FORTRESS AT ISTHMIA AT THE END OF ANTIQUI- TY: Timothy E. Gregory, Ohio State University The Fortress at Isthmia was the primary anchor on the Hexamilion, the early Byzantine wall across the Isthmus of Corinth. Excavations carried out by P.A. Clement between 1967 and 1978 revealed many details about the Hexamilion, inluding its original date of construction, in the early years of the fifth century A.C. Subsequent study of the Fortress has answered many questions about what is probably the most important fortification in early Byzantine Greece and one of the most ambitious engineering feats of the ancient world. One of the more interesting aspects of this study is the fate of the Fortress at the very end of antiquity, in the sixth and seventh centuries. The Fortress was the primary line of defense for the Peloponnesos against the invasions of the age and its success will have largely determined the fate of civili- zation in southern Greece for several centuries. It is signifi- cant, therefore, that important new evidence has recently come to light in the Fortress, partially illuminating the years of the Byzantine "Dark Ages." This evidence shows, for example, that the Fortress was apparently abandoned for military purposes at a time when it was perhaps most need- ed and it includes the discovery of so-called Slavic pottery, suggesting that invaders from the north either occupied the</page><page sequence="54">320 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 Fortress or lived close to it. This paper analyzes this new evidence and suggests that earlier studies of the problem have been far too simplistic in their analysis and that they have dated the collapse of the frontier in Greece as much as a century too early. THE DISTRIBUTION OF COINAGE AND THE DEFENSE OF THE EASTERN ROMAN/BYZANTINE EMPIRES: John W. Betlyon, Smith College Archaeological excavations at Near Eastern sites such as Umm al-Jimal and el-Lejjun have illuminated the legionary fortresses constructed by Rome to guard the eastern boun- daries of the Empire. Coins found there usually come from eastern mints, such as Antiochia and Alexandria. But issues from European mints like Trier and Lyons, known from Lejjun, reflect the western origin of the troops which first garrisoned the Limes Arabicus. Literary sources say little about the army in the eastern Empire. The archaeological record is now filling in our knowledge. Excavations reveal a lacuna in the numismatic record between A.D. 455 and 491. Of the 215 coins found at Lejjun, none date to the late fifth century. Of 116 coins from Umm al-Jimal, only one Vandalic coin of North Africa is known from this period. At Jerash, only 10 of 1,700 coins date to the second half of the fifth century. Inflation de- creased the value of the coinage in the Early Byzantine peri- od. Coin flans of the Aes coinages diminished. There may have been shortages of precious metals since Rome had been sacked by the Vandals. In conclusion, coins provide important new evidence for Late Roman and Early Byzantine history in the East. Dio- cletian's fear that the Empire would fall if the army was not well cared for came to fruition under Justinian I. For three years he failed to pay the army, and the desert peoples- initially perceived to be the enemy-became mercernaries who guarded the frontier until they became conquerors in the name of Islam. SESSION VI B: AEGEAN ARCHAEOLOGY II EXCAVATIONS AT CHAERONEIA, 1986: Hara Tzavella- Evjen, University of Colorado, Boulder The site at Touba Balomenou provided enough stratified materials of late Early Neolithic through the early phase of Late Neolithic that we are able to compare and organize Soteriaides' finds (Prakt [1902] 55-58; [1904] 40-45; [1909] 123-25) from the same site for publication. The finds from the 1986 season include pottery of monochrome wares, early painted and "rainbow" wares, "Chaeroneia" ware, black burnished and polychrome types. Figurines, bone and stone tools, pendants, beads, spools, and bullets were also com- mon. The finds were in context with human and animal bones within layers of ashes mixed with dirt, carbonized and organic materials. Between these layers were strata of dirt with heavy clay content. It must be stressed that neither the human nor the animal bones were burnt. Their condition thus suggests the practice of secondary burial. THE NEMEA VALLEY ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT, 1986: James C. Wright, Bryn Mawr College, John F. Cherry, Cambridge University, Jack L. Davis, University of Illinois at Chicago, Eleni Mantzou- rani, University of Athens, Susan B. Sutton, In- diana University-Purdue University at Indiana- polis In 1986 the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project com- pleted its three years of fieldwork. Activities concentrated on finishing data-gathering for the archaeological survey, the ethnographic study of modern settlement, excavation on Tsoungiza Hill, and defining the geomorphological setting of the valley. Excavation on Tsoungiza finished exposure of the main areas of Early and Late Helladic settlements and tested for habitation and bedrock levels around the hill. Principal dis- coveries were several deposits of EH I and early EH II, a double-megaron complex with many phases of use during LH I, a long building of LH III date, and a major deposit of LH IIIA:2 date which included a large terracotta Myce- naean figurine. Archaeological survey covered ca. 18 km.2 and once again finds of Byzantine date were most abundant. Special studies included investigation of two well-preserved Middle Neo- lithic sites and the important Mediaeval center of Polyfengi, and mapping the distribution of scattered architectural members and the large-scale systematic collection of arti- facts at and near the ancient site of Phlious. A program of geophysical prospection continued with magnetometry sur- vey at Phlious and other sites. Geomorphological mapping greatly enhanced interpretation of artifact distribution in different parts of the study area. Ethnographic research concentrated on intensive inter- views with many local inhabitants, researching demograph- ic and land-use records, and studying traditional houses and building techniques in the area. EXCAVATIONS AT PSEIRA, 1986: P.P. Betancourt, Temple University; C. Davaras, Archaeological In- stitute of Crete; and J. McEnroe, Hamilton College The joint American/Greek excavations at Pseira, Crete, took place from 28 June to 1 August 1986, under the direc- tion of P. Betancourt and C. Davaras. J. McEnroe was ar- chitect. The season was largely exploratory, with several small trenches opened at various points on the site in order to learn the extent of the Bronze Age remains and the char- acter of the material in areas left unexcavated by R. Seager's excavations of 1906-1907. For the Minoan period, an open court ca. 20 x 16 m. in size was found near the center of the town. A Minoan house facing on this court was partly ex- cavated. A large pottery dump was discovered, with sherds and stone vase fragments of great interest. Other work in the</page><page sequence="55">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 321 Minoan strata included the cleaning of the House of the Buttresses and the excavation of several small soundings be- neath floors. A reoccupation period house was discovered at the edge of the Minoan town. On its floor were complete vases from LM IIIA:2. The cemetery was located, and two small funerary clusters were excavated. A Byzantine church was found, built above the Minoan town. It was constructed of dry stone masonry with a basilica plan, forming a part of a large complex with several buildings. EXCAVATIONS AT MIDEA IN THE ARGOLID, 1983- 1985: Gisela Walberg, University of Cincinnati Midea is one of the three great Mycenaean citadels in the Argolid along with Mycenae and Tiryns. It is located east of Argos and southeast of Mycenae. The cemetery site to the north in the village of Dendra, including the Tholos Tomb and the Cuirass Tomb, are well known. Trial trenches were excavated on the citadel in 1939 by A.W. Persson, but the work was interrupted by World War II. In 1963, another trial trench was opened by P. Xstr6m to locate an ash layer (now datable to LH IIIB:2) that Persson had reported. In 1983, a Swedish excavation directed by Astr6m was again begun on top of the citadel, and a Greek excavation, directed by K. Demakopoulou, was started at the West Gate in an ongoing effort to reveal the history of the site. In the summer of 1985, trial trenches were excavated by the author on the lower terraces inside the Cyclopean Wall (the Unter- stadt). Here deep deposits of mixed material suggest the pre- sence of a settlement going back to the EBA. The material includes Mycenaean rooftiles from LH IIIB:2 houses and fragments of an advanced LH IIIC krater, which indicates that the citadel was reoccupied after the major LH IIIB:2 catastrophe that left the ash layer on top of the citadel. Future excavations are planned in all three areas of Mi- dea. The goal of the Cincinnati excavation is to establish an early pottery sequence to compare with those of Korakou and Lerna and to reveal the early history of one of the major citadels. THE LATE BRONZE AGE SHIPWRECK AT ULU BURUN: 1986: George F. Bass and Cemal Pulak, Texas A&amp;M University The Institute of Nautical Archaeology in 1986 completed its third excavation campaign at Ulu Burun, near Kay, Tur- key (G.F. Bass, "A Bronze Age Shipwreck at Ulu Burun [Kay]: 1984 Campaign," AJA 90 [1986] 269-96). New finds are tentatively identified as a possibly unique gold scarab of Nefertiti; a gold medallion of a nude goddess with a gazelle in each hand, as well as other typically Canaanite gold medallions; a crystal cylinder seal with gold caps on its ends, probably Kassite; an Old Babylonian hematite cylinder seal, recut in, perhaps, the Amarna period; and, in a pithos, the earliest known "book," a hinged wooden diptych of the type which held wax mixed with orpiment for writing (M.E.L. Mallowan, "The Excavations at Nimrud [Kalhu], 1953," Iraq 16 [1954] 98-107; D.J. Wiseman, "Assyrian Writing- Boards," Iraq 17 [1955] 3-6). More tin and copper ingots, weights, tools, weapons, and pottery also came to light, as did another faience ram's head rhyton. At the deeper end of the site, several more stone anchors were uncovered, bring- ing the total on board to 11. The site's ultimate contribu- tions to the history of trade, international relations, and technology must await complete excavation. SOUTHERN EUBOEA EXPLORATION PROJECT: PRO- GRESS REPORT: Donald R. Keller, Indiana Univer- sity In 1984 M. Wallace and I began to investigate historical and archaeological questions raised by our previous inde- pendent research in southern Euboea. This work has been sponsored by the Canadian Archaeological Institute in Athens. Our initial concern was the hypothesis that a num- ber of Classical sites discovered on the Paximadhi penin- sula, west of Karystos, represent the remains of an Athenian cleruchy. In our first three seasons we have conducted an intensive survey of the entire Paximadhi peninsula and reconnais- sance survey in other areas of southern Euboea. The results of this research suggest that the Paximadhi peninsula is the most probable candidate for an Athenian cleruchy. In 1985 and 1986 we undertook test excavations at a fortified settle- ment and at a farmstead on the Paximadhi peninsula. Evi- dence of late fifth-century B.C. occupation at both sites is in agreement with the cleruchy hypothesis, but more informa- tion is needed. Our first three seasons of limited archaeological research in southern Euboea have been encouraging. We have re- corded 70 new sites of various periods in the region and have recovered new information concerning the size and charac- ter of fifth-century B.C. agricultural sites. We have also enlisted the aid of Belgian geologists in the study of the en- vironment of the region. CYPRIOT HOOK-TANG SPEARHEADS AND RIVETED DAGGERS: MANUFACTURE AND USE: Judy Wein- stein Balthazar, University of Pennsylvania Two types of stabbing or thrusting weapons were used during the Early and Middle Cypriot periods, one with hook-tangs and the other with rivets. Although the two arti- facts are clearly distinguishable to archaeologists, no prior discussion has fully examined the distinctions ancient Cyp- riots may have made between them. A recent study both of the weapons themselves and of related compositional and metallographic data suggests that the two implements were used and made differently. Most previous studies classified both as hand-held thrust- ing weapons (J.R. Stewart, SwCyprusExp IV:1A [1962]; P. Xstrim, SwCyprusExp IV:1B [1972]; H. Catling, Cypriot Bronzes in the Mycenaean World [1964]). In fact, hook- tang "swords and daggers" were thought to have inspired the clay models of daggers found at Vounous (G.B. Gard-</page><page sequence="56">322 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 ner, "Le problkme de la garde de l'epbe cypriote de l'Age du Bronze," BSPF 12 [1937] 546-50). Yet, remains of hafting on the metal objects themselves suggest that the hook-tang weapons were actually used as spearheads as Schaeffer pro- posed (Missions en Chypre [1936]) and that the Vounous model daggers really represent the riveted blades. When hafted, hook-tang spearheads and riveted daggers would have looked very different from each other and fulfilled separate functions. Ancient Cypriots must have thought of them as completely different implements. The two types of weapons also seem to have been treated differently by the Middle Cypriot smiths, who learned to cast riveted daggers of a new alloy-tin bronze-while con- tinuing to fashion hook-tang spearheads of unalloyed or ar- senical copper in a more traditonal manner. Cultural factors as well as technological considerations may have prohibited the smiths from experimenting with hook-tang spearheads. In short, the distinction between riveted daggers and hook- tang spearheads may have transcended appearance and function. A HYDROCHOLORIC ACID FIELD TEST FOR Low-FIRED POTTERY: Jane A. Barlow, Higgins Armory Mu- seum, and Phillip Idziak, Cornell University Technical studies of potsherds have revealed selective use of low-fired clays for decorative and utilitarian purposes at the Middle Bronze Age site of Alambra in Cyprus. A petro- graphic analysis of Red Polished and White Painted wares suggested that variations within each ware were related to clays originating in sedimentary or igneous geological for- mations. A simple field test using hydrochloric acid proved to be diagnostic for different pastes. After a chemical ana- lysis by scanning electron microprobe confirmed the discri- minatory value of the field test, the test was used on a sample of some 500 sherds of identifiable shapes from floor levels within the single-period Alambra settlement. For the finer wares, the results show that potters were using well-levigated calcareous pastes and a non-calcareous slip fired below 800' C. The nature of the decoration can be related to the properties of the clay, and the relationship of the Black Polished, fine Red Polished and early White Painted wares can be clarified. In the coarser red ware, variations in the pastes are shown to correlate with certain shapes. The clay properties that affect porosity or resistance to thermal shock apparently determined the materials used. In addition to the implications for the classification of EB and MB Cypriot pottery, the study suggests that the hydro- choloric-acid field test yields information about low-fired pottery technology that is generally assumed to be obtain- able only in the laboratory. GLASS PRODUCTION IN ANCIENT CYPRUS: Murray C. McClellan, Stevens Institute of Technology A study of the typology of glass vessels found in Cyprus has revealed three distinct periods during which glass ob- jects were produced on the island. Within each of these peri- ods (Late Cypriot III; Late Hellenistic-Early Roman; Late Roman-Early Byzantine) the types of glass vessels produced on Cyprus can be clearly distinguished from those made elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean. This new characterization of the Cypriot glass industry has wider implications for our understanding of the nature of Cypriot society and trade. The relationship between Late Cypriot III and New Kingdom Egyptian glass argues against a complete rupture of trade between Cyprus and Egypt at that time. The glass from the Hellenistic and Ro- man periods shows a greater participation by Cypriots in technological innovations than heretofore suspected. In addition to presenting a revised typology of Cypriot glass, this study utilizes recent archaeological finds to refine the chronology of Cypriot glass. Further, recent geological research in Cyprus has challenged the notion that Cyprus did not have silica resources sufficient for glass production. This study will report on a new series of chemical analyses of both Cypriot geological samples and of Cypriot glass sam- ples and will relate these analyses to the corpus of glass analyses. SESSION VI C: REMOTE SENSING AN INTRODUCTION TO REMOTE SENSING IN ARCHAEO- LOGY: James R. Wiseman, Boston University A brief, non-technical explanation is presented of the fun- damentals of remote sensing and computer-assisted analysis, a technology that has only recently begun to be applied in archaeological research. Emphasis is placed on the signifi- cance of the technology for archaeology, especially with re- gard to large-scale regional survey, predictive modeling, the integration of various types of digitized information to pro- duce informative visual displays of large or small land areas, and prospects for the detection of various types of ancient sites. The problems of making the technology widely avail- able to archaeologists are discussed. In connection with those problems, the aims and activities of the newly created Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University are discussed. VERTICAL BALLOON PHOTOGRAPHY FOR RECORDING AND DISCOVERY: J. Wilson Myers, Boston Univer- sity Though systematic archaeological recording by tethered balloon-camera was first done by P. Guy at the fortress tell of Megiddo in 1930 ("Balloon Photography and Archaeo- logical Excavation," Antiquity 6 [1932] 148-55), this early form of remote sensing by vertical photography still offers benefits not to be found in the better known aerial photo- graphy by planes. Aside from the convenience of being able to inflate and fly a balloon at an archaeological site, and de- velop negatives for proofing on the spot, the balloon camera system offers a unique opportunity to make high-resolution photographs at very low altitudes. Large mosaics, temple</page><page sequence="57">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 323 foundations, tomb complexes, Minoan palaces, or details of submerged harbor works can be recorded from as low as 5 m.-impossible by plane and difficult by helicopter, which ruffles water surfaces and disturbs fragile sites. In true verti- cal photography, as distinguished from oblique, a level sur- face, necessarily parallel to the recording film, is rendered as an orthographic projection, the dimensional equivalent of a drawn plan. Such a "photo-plan" can be scaled and used to generate drawn plans or to check for the errors in earlier drawings. For purposes of discovery, the balloon shares with all aerial platforms the advantage that it can reveal signi- ficant archaeological patterns which may be quite invisible at ground level. Our own aerial system includes twin radio- controlled cameras suspended vertically in a gimbal from a 10-m. blimp which can rise as high as 800 m., recording a square kilometer. Recent experiments have shown that in- struments for archaeological remote sensing other than film cameras can also be suspended in the balloon's gimbal. REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS IN A REGIONAL AR- CHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY: BURGUNDY, FRANCE: Scott Madry, Institute for Technology Development, Space Remote Sensing Center, NSTL, Mississippi, and Carole L. Crumley, University of North Caro- lina, Chapel Hill A multi-year, multidisciplinary regional archaeological settlement and land-use study was conducted in the Bur- gundy region of France. The purpose of this research was to investigate factors determining regional settlement pat- terns from the Iron Age and Gallo-Roman periods to the present. Extensive bibliographical research was conducted, field transects were surveyed on foot, and excavations undertaken. Extensive aerial survey and photography were conduct- ed. Several sites identified in the land survey were relocated and new sites were discovered from the air. Modern and archival vertical mapping photos were studied. LANDSAT satellite data were obtained, and (digital) current land-use/ land-cover maps were produced. An attempt was made to correlate Gallo-Roman age site locations and modern land- use, but results were inconclusive. A discussion of the natural factors affecting the discovery of archaeological sites from the air will be presented, as well as a discussion of future techniques and sensor systems that will provide archaeologists with improved capabilities. INTEGRATING DATABASE AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMA- TION SYSTEMS FOR ARCHAEOLOGISTS: W. Frederick Limp, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville Analysis of remote-sensed data has demonstrated benefit for archaeological study on the site and regional level. It be- comes even more productive when integrated with compu- terized databases and geographic information systems (GIS). Concerted conceptual effort must be applied early in the design stages of all these systems to insure their com- patibility. Computer hardware/software allowing flexible queries and rapid re-evaluation of alternatives is also essen- tial. Recent developments in these areas now make such large-scale integration possible. Specific benefits of such in- tegration are presented, focusing on the discovery and expli- cation of regional settlement patterning. The process of site discovery is enhanced by correlating currently known site location data stored in a regional automated database, with the distribution of related environmental factors throughout the environment derived from a GIS. Both inductive pattern recognition and deductive modeling of settlement selection processes are presented. Remote-sensed data serve as alter- native data for confirmation purposes as well as initial pat- tern recognition. Remote-sensed data may be inferentially correlated to particular environmental features, but the pat- terns derived from such data cannot be directly compared to human settlement selection processes. Integration of remote- sensed data directly with environmental data from a GIS permits a much more complete linkage with the pattern and the human process. A MULTISPECTRAL CAMERA FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH: Frederick P. Hemans, Boston Univer- sity Multispectral imaging has created a revolution in the methodology of researchers who study the earth's resources. The first two generations of LANDSAT instrumentation have allowed us to map biological and mineralogical re- sources efficiently and have provided archaeologists with the capability of evaluating, on a very large scale, the ecological setting of archaeological sites. There is a rapidly growing list of projects that are using LANDSAT data to help ex- plain settlement systems, to guide archaeological survey, and to quantitatively measure the natural resources of various regions of the world. In addition, new sensors, such as Shut- tle Imaging Radar and the Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner developed by NASA, are expanding the knowledge of present and past ecological systems. In the past year Boston University's Center for Remote Sensing, with the aid of electrical and optical engineers, has adapted the current technological capabilities of silicon- based sensors, bandpass filters, and microcomputers to put together a multispectral camera capable of operating from a balloon, small aircraft, or even a tripod. This gives us the ability to collect multispectral data, in visible and near-in- frared wavelengths, at resolutions as small as a few centi- meters, i.e., at an appropriate scale to study variations with- in archaeological sites as well as their surrounding regions. In June 1986 a team from Boston University consisting of W. and E. Myers, J. Wiseman, and myself took the sys- tem to Corinth, Greece, to test its capabilities at a variety of unexcavated and excavated areas of the Corinthia. On se- parate days the camera was flown over Acrocorinth, the for- um area, and the harbor at Lechaion. Each area presented different conditions and potential uses of the data. At Lechaion, for example, the data is being used to map sub- surface walls beneath the sand. On Acrocorinth, the images</page><page sequence="58">324 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 present some interesting possibilities for the study of Turk- ish settlement and the various phases of the circuit wall. This report explains the methodology of multispectral re- mote sensing and the technology of our system, offers pre- liminary evaluation of the results from the Corinth trials, and suggests future applications. REMOTE SENSING IN CHACO CANYON, POVERTY POINT, AND COSTA RICA: Thomas L. Sever, Earth Resources Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration This paper reviews advanced digital remote sensing anal- ysis in three separate areas representing different environ- mental settings. Using NASA remote sensing instruments such as the Thematic Mapper Simulator (TMS), the Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS), and li- dar, archaeological features that cannot be seen with the naked eye have been extracted from the data with computer- implemented analysis. These features have been substanti- ated with ground reconnaissance and excavation. Specific discussion centers upon the detection of road- ways in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico; corridors, ramps, fill- areas, and other historic and prehistoric features at Poverty Point, Louisiana; and roadway and pathway systems as well as the development of a geo-based information system at Arenal, Costa Rica, for predictive analysis and an under- standing of environmental adaptation. Concurrent with the discussion is an explanation of re- mote sensing methodology and the development of statistical techniques that reveal linear and curvilinear patterns not visible in aerial photographs. Finally, mention is made of recent developments in remote sensing technology available to the archaeologist in a cost-effective and affordable man- ner such as ground-based survey instruments that can ren- der the latitude, longitude, and elevation of any position on earth to within 3 cm. SESSION VI D: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE HOUSE AND HOUSEHOLD THE EARLY BRONZE AGE HOUSE IN NORTHEAST GREECE AT SITAGROI: Ernestine S. Elster, Univer- sity of California, Los Angeles The excavation at the prehistoric settlement mound of Sitagroi in northeast Greece has given us a large body of data for the reconstruction of the economy, subsistence, and environment for close to 3000 years--from ca. 5400-2400 B.C. in calibrated years (C. Renfrew, M. Gimbutas, and E.S. Elster, Excavations at Sitagroi I (Monumenta Archaeo- logica 13, Los Angeles 1986). Many settlement horizons have been exposed through excavation and, with the mate- rial remains, allow us to recognize five phases: Sitagroi I and II are Middle Neolithic; Sitagroi III is Late Neolithic in Greek terms and Chalcolithic in terms of Balkan chrono- logy; Sitagroi IV and V are representative of the Early Bronze Age. The Burnt House at Sitagroi belongs to the Early Bronze Age; according to our calibrated dates, it was built in the late third millennium. The conflagration which burned the house preserved its plan, construction, and contents. Fortu- itously, it was spared destruction during activity of later oc- cupation. The house is presented clearly: size, floor area, architecture, number of rooms, features, and possessions. The material attributes, activity areas, and size of this demographic unit are examined and projected against the changing pattern of the economy and subsistence before, during, and after this period of the Early Bronze Age. What emerges is a dwelling unit which reflects ties north across the Rhodope Mountains (e.g., Baden and Ezero) in terms of material culture, along with evidence of household adapta- tion from the florescent Chalcolithic phase to the much transformed Early Bronze Age society. ROOM FUNCTION IN THE LATE BRONZE AGE HOUSES AT KALAVASOS-AYIOS DHIMITRIOS, CYPRUS: Pam- ela Russell, New York Society An examination of the pottery from four buildings at the Late Cypriot site of Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios has re- vealed marked distribution patterns which may reflect vari- ations in room functions. These patterns emerged after an analysis of the total sherd material which was divided into seven ware categories. The proportions of fine wares to uti- litarian wares can be used to suggest which rooms were used mainly for eating and drinking and which were used mainly for food preparation and storage. In one example, a seven-roomed structure (Building II) had a bench-lined front room that contained the highest proportion of fine wares from the building, suggesting that its function was one of dining. Within the same structure, three smaller back rooms appear to be work and cooking areas, judging from the predominance of coarse wares found in them. A close examination of room function of the houses in one well-excavated Late Bronze Age Cypriot settlement greatly increased our knowledge of daily life and society during this critical period in Cypriot history and serves as a model for further studies at other Cypriot sites. EARLY PUEBLO HOUSEHOLD ORGANIZATION IN SOUTH- WESTERN COLORADO: Ricky R. Lightfoot, Crow Canyon Archaeological Center Reconstruction of Puebloan social organization from ar- chaeological evidence has long been of interest in the Four Corners area of the American Southwest. Studies have fo- cused on architectural evidence for the definition of house- holds and higher-order social units. Recent work at the Duckfoot Site in southwest Colorado provides data for testing architecturally based models of household structure and function using the types and spatial</page><page sequence="59">1987] THE 88TH GENERAL MEETING 325 patterning of features and artifacts. The Duckfoot Site is a small hamlet consisting of 18 rooms and three pit structures. It dates to the late 800s, in the Pueblo I period of the Anasazi tradition. Apparent rapid abandonment of the settlement left numerous artifacts on use surfaces, facilitating inference of room and use-area function. Architecturally based models of Pueblo I organization postulate a nested hierarchy of social units ranging from sub-household through community levels. Portions of this model are tested with Duckfoot data. Feature and use-context artifactual evidence are examined for the predicted functional complementarity of activities in the pit structure, plaza, living and storage-room areas that comprise the architecturally defined joint household com- plex. Also, the presumed joint household complexes at Duck- foot are compared with one another for the predicted be- tween-unit redundancy in activities. A second approach to testing the architecturally derived model is analysis of artifact storage and disposal patterns as indicators of interaction within and among architecturally defined social units. Plotting the disposal of sherds from se- lected pottery vessels provides one such source of informa- tion. A promising new technique developed by Crow Can- yon researchers involves matching portable grinding stones (manos) with the troughed nether stones (metates) upon which they were used. Preliminary results indicate some de- partures from the expected pattern of storing manos in the same households as the metates on which they were used. A PUNIC KITCHEN IN NURAGHE ORTU COMIDU (SAR- DARA-CA) IN SARDINIA: Miriam S. Balmuth, Tufts University In 1918, A. Taramelli published in MonAnt the results of his soundings at Nuraghe Ortu C6midu (Sardara-CA) in Sardinia. He concluded that the traces of ovens he had found were assoicated with some kinds of the metallurgical activity that characterize the Nuragic cultures of the island. Excava- tions by Tufts University were begun at Ortu C6midu in 1975 and have alternated with study seasons for work on the material excavated, and island-wide metallurgical surveys. The ovens, described by Taramelli as Nuragic smelters, are now interpreted as Carthaginian baking ovens. Two Punic coins, and the existence in Carthage of counterparts to the ovens, strengthen this interpretation. In addition, finds of charred grain (Wetterstrom, NSc 1986) and vessels for food, oil and wine (Will, SSA II, 1986) were found in the area of the ovens, suggesting a kitchen rather than any kind of workshop. The ruins of the nuraghe show that it had a cen- tral tower and four subsidiary towers. The tower on the east can now be called a kitchen; the tower on the south is the only known example from a nuraghe that is paved with blocks, suggesting that it was more ceremonial than func- tional. The nuraghi are now being studied intensively for chronology, function, and variation to explain the presence of 7000 examples on an island 150 x 75 miles in area. The kitchen and paved area (guest dining room?) at Ortu C6mi- du show that even within a nuraghe differing functions can be identified in a domestic context. DOMESTIC SPACE IN THE GREEK CITY-STATE: Michael H. Jameson, Stanford University In the social study of the Greek house conclusions have generally been drawn from the evidence of texts and then applied to that of archaeology. Emphasis has been placed on the importance of the hearth and on the strict separation of male and female areas. A significantly different picture emerges from the archaeological evidence viewed without prior assumptions, one that is consistent with the social val- ues and economic patterns seen in the layout of Greek towns and the relationship of town and country. The Classical Greek town house is a closed unit, immediately adjacent to a street but with its interior invisible from it, and sharing par- ty walls with other houses from which it is equally invisible. It consists of a group of adjoining rectangular rooms open- ing off a rectangular courtyard which is itself one of the principal living spaces of the house. Though in practice separate working and sleeping areas may have been used by women and men, slave and free, no such divisions are in- herent in the architecture; flexible use of the spaces is con- firmed by the textual evidence. The only major exception is the frequent provision of a distinctive room (the andron) for the entertainment of visitors, presumably primarily male. A fixed, central hearth is the exception rather than the rule but the conception of the hearth as the focus of the household's religious life remains strong, employing whatever fireplace was actually in use. The dominant ideology served by such houses was that of the independent nuclear family, constant- ly reconstituted by every marriage and both cohesive inter- nally and suspicious of the outside world. This is the same unit that constitutes the basic element of the city-state, so- cially and economically, and whose essentially egalitarian conception results in the uniform land division of new towns. The characteristic house of the towns may also be said to prevail in the countryside, if allowance is made for isolation and preponderant agricultural activity. THE SARNO COMPLEX AT POMPEII: PRECURSOR OF THE OSTIAN INSULA?: Ann Olga Koloski-Ostrow, Bran- deis University The Sarno complex is a multistoried building along the southern cliff at Pompeii (VIII.2.17-23) in which the top three floors were private quarters for a number of families, while the two lowest levels were occupied by an elaborate small bathing establishment. In its final phase the Sarno complex exhibits several cha- racteristics which are common to the well-built insula. Since there are no close parallels for the complex on the Bay of Naples and since the building seems to foreshadow some of the forms seen fully developed at Ostia, examples from Ostia best illuminate its special features. In order to place this uni- que Pompeian building within its appropriate architectural context, the Ostian evidence is analyzed for dimensions of rooms on upper floors, the nature of staircases, mezzanine levels, and balconies, systems of lighting, and other ameni-</page><page sequence="60">326 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 91 ties. These features are then compared to the findings in the Sarno complex. The paper attempts to prove that the room arrangements in the apartments of the Sarno complex may represent the Ostian medianum plan in embryo. Important research by Hermansen (Ostia [1982]) is highlighted, focusing on the "medianum apartment" at Ostia, an apartment consisting of small rooms opening onto three sides of a large central room, the medianum proper. It is concluded that the Sarno com- plex anticipates the design of the finer Ostian insulae. The lack of detailed publication of the complex to date is there- fore no measure of its significance in the history of Roman domestic housing. EXCAVATIONS AT StTIF: THE ISLAMIC HOUSES: Eliza- beth Fentress, University of Siena The excavations of the town of Setif (Roman Sitifis, Arab Satif) in Algeria were carried out between 1981 and 1984 under the auspices of the Algerian Department of Antiqui- ties. This is the first time that the transition from a Roman to an Islamic city has been studied archaeologically in North Africa, and the results give us a unique picture of the eco- nomic and social changes which resulted from the conquest. One of the most important aspects of these excavations is the light they shed on the nature of the 11th-century town, and in particular on its housing. The Islamic houses were ex- cavated, and a stratigraphic sequence established. This pap- er presents a typological study of these houses, with particu- lar attention to the functional and social arrangement of their rooms. It concludes with some tentative suggestions on the origins and development of the house type. POWER AND PARTIES: HOW THE ROMAN ARISTOCRAT APPEARED TO HIS GUESTS: Simon P. Ellis, Univer- sity of Cambridge The starting point for this paper is a fourth-century su- burban villa at Nis (first reported in Arh Pregled 11, 185-86). A three-apsed hall, originally seen as a "nym- phaeum," is reinterpreted as a dining room, comparable to those in the "Palace of Theodoric" at Ravenna, the House of the Triapsidal Hall at Ptolemais, the House of Bacchus at Djemila, and palaces in Rome and Constantinople. The vil- la at Nis has produced a deposit of 12 sculptures. Similar late Roman collections are known from Antioch, Ostia, Athens, Ptolemais, and Constantinople. This material and texts such as Ammianus' Histories 28.4.12-13, and Sidonius' Letters 1.11.11-15, are used to consider the message that the architecture and art of the house conveyed to guests. The interpretation can be on pag- an, Christian, or more neutral lines. Formal dinners were highly structured occasions, and seating was in order of rank, from the honored guest to the "parasite," who acted like a Mediaeval "fool." This can be judged from texts and manu- script illuminations. Themes expressed in the iconography of the dining room were luxury, hunting, feasting, heroism, ideals of beauty and art. Secular and imperial portraits could be seen as ancestors or role models. Mosaics illustrate rich estates and patronage. The dining room made a strong politi- cal statement about the power of the owner. This supports textual evidence which records highly charged dinner con- versations, as diners sought to score political and intellectual points at the expense of others. It is very hard to see these rooms as settings for a regular family meal. INDEX OF AUTHORS Each author's name is followed by the page number(s) in this issue on which his or her abstract is printed.
