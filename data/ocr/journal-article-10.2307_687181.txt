WILKES x Philosophers working on the mind-body problem have always interested themselves primarily in the relations that hold, or fail to hold, between the mental and the physical. Their theories are, indeed, identified in terms of the relation for which they argue; so we find identity theories (of several different varieties), interactionism, eliminative materialism, functionalism, parallelism, epiphenomenalism-and the list continues. Strangely enough a prior question is usually ignored, namely just what are these mental and physical relata, the items that provide the two terms of the relation? It is true that the mental relata tend to receive some notice; for instance, 'the mental' is often divided into two broad categories-the category of the occurrent, incorrigibly-known sensation-type phenomena, like pains, on the one hand, and on the other the category of the intensional pro- positional attitudes, such as beliefs and desires; but details of the member- ship of either of these categories are rarely provided, and discussion of the mental relata stops there. The physical relata are hardly discussed at all. This latter neglect, the neglect of the physical relata, is presumably due to a laudable enough desire not to meddle with scientific matters lying beyond the philosophical horizon. However, there is a body of fact and theory, readily accessible to the layman, that deserves and repays attention; it can shed a fascinating light upon the whole mind-body debate. (E.g., Dimond [1972], Gardner [1977], Geschwind [I974], Hinshelwood [I 9o00], Luria [1973], Valenstein [19731)- In this paper I discuss some of the implications for the mind-body problem of recent work in neuropsychology. There is one essential preliminary caveat: the argument touches upon only such theses as concern themselves with the possibility of finding lawlike correlations between mental states and physical states. I am assuming that these are the most interesting theses, using 'interesting' in a sense that betrays a bias in favour of the scientific concern with the mind-body problem; for the question of the viability of lawlike correlations between mental and physical lies at the heart of future research into the psychophysiology of human experience and action, and is presupposed by any discussion of the reducibilityx in principle or practice of mental states to physical 1 Any interpretation of 'reduce'-and there are very many in the literature--will fit the argument. Received 26 February i979 H</page><page sequence="2">112 Kathleen V. Wilkes processes in the brain and central nervous system. Hence, for example, Davidson's 'anomalous monism' (Davidson [1970]) has a positive thesis that is not interesting in this sense, for it argues for only particular identities between mental and physical, rather than for lawgoverned general links; but it has an interesting negative thesis, in that it claims that there can in principle be no genuine laws between the two sets of relata. My concern, then, is with lawlike correlations, and with how certain facts about brain states affect not only their form and content but their very viability. 2 If it is agreed that a scientifically interesting theory about the relation of mind and body presupposes that there can be lawgoverned links forged between the two, or else proved to be impossible in principle to forge, then instantly there appear some obvious but nonetheless powerful constraints upon the relata. The first constraint is that the two domains-of mental and neurophysiological phenomena-must each comprise clear and explicit taxonomies of items, such that within each domain the conditions for their identification are apparent and effective, or are thought to be capable of becoming so.1 (For example, the theoretical concept of an 'engram' is at present vastly obscure, but can still be used so long as it is believed that one of the competing theories of learning will manage to specify it precisely within the terms and postulates of the theory, declaring it to be a matter of changes in the structure of the cell membrane, or of functional changes in synaptic chemistry, or of structural changes in intracellular macromolecules, or of some combinatory compromise between these three theoretical approaches (see Dunham [1977], PP- 158-79). The notion of an engram would be worse than useless, indeed positively misleading, unless scientists thought that it held the promise of ultimate precise specification.) Second, the domains in question must be worthwhile domains. By 'worthwhile' in this connection I mean that they must be such as to contribute to the theory of which they form the ontology (thus, for example, neurons with axons of eactly 8- mm long, or the bumps of the phrenologists, would presumably not belong to a worthwhile domain); the mental items and properties must be those in terms of which human behaviour and experience can be satisfactorily described and explained, and the neurophysiological items and properties must be 1 As will become clear later on (section 4) the creation of these taxonomies in each of the two sciences is and must be heavily dependent upon the work in progress in the other science; for example, psychologists hope to postulate processes that are capable of neurophysiological realisation, and neurophysiologists try to identify just those cerebral events and structures that meet the psychologists' demands.</page><page sequence="3">Brain States i 13 capable of providing the same service for the understanding of central nervous system functioning. In short, the conceptual apparatus of each investigation should be the best (or one of the best, since the profusion of both psychological and neurophysiological theories shows that at least at present there is gross underdetermination of theory by data) for the descriptive and explanatory purposes of the science. More could be said about the constraints that any lawgoverned relation- ship must impose upon its relata, but these are indisputable and will suffice for present purposes. It is worth investigating how they affect one fairly prevalent bunch of theories (less prevalent, perhaps, than it used to be) about the mind-body relation: that is, that individual mental states, such as the thought that one must buy more toothpaste, or the recognition that the object on the horizon is a windmill, may be correlated-whether through identity, parallelism, interactionism, functionalism, or what you will-in a lawlike fashion with cerebral states. I shall discuss presently whether such states as these are suitable for membership of the mental ontology; we shall first consider the nature of their neurophysiological correlates. We are searching for a description of a brain state (or, more leniently and plausibly, of brain states; there is nothing to prevent lawlike relations between mental and physical being one:many rather than one:one) such that the cerebral processes in question may be identified and reidentified, such that the description picks out brain states that would be worthwhile members of the neurophysiological ontology, and such that we have reason to believe that one of the set of correlated states will recur whenever anyone remembers his need for toothpaste or recognizes a windmill. What seems absolutely clear from the scientific evidence is that there could be no such states. To see this, consider how just one state of the necessary kind might be identified. It is now generally acknowledged that any mental phenomenon (whether it be a cognitive state, a simple sensation, an emotion, or feelings of hunger and thirst) will be embodied by or grounded inI a variety of processes in distinct and dissimilar areas of the neocortex and/or limbic system. In each such area the neurons may be of two or more different kinds, and will be capable of firing at varying speeds and in different combinatory patterns. If we were to take just one of these brain areas, the activity of just one type of neuron in it, and somehow contrived to sort out the neural activity relevant to our interests 1 'Embodied by or grounded in' is left deliberately vague, so that as many as possible of the rival monistic theories may be covered. Dualists are free to substitute 'regularly correlated with'.</page><page sequence="4">114 Kathleen V. Wilkes from the background 'noise' of unrelated neural discharge, then we could attempt to specify this small locus of cerebral activity by (let us suppose) observing neurons a, b, c, ..., n to be active, neurons x, y, z, ..., m to be inhibited, the speed and the pattern of neural firing to be thus-and-so (synchronous, sequential, waltz-time, etc.), and the duration of the activity to be D. To achieve this description we would need, of course, to do more than merely examine the facts of neural firing. For to discover whether neuron x is inhibited or simply inactive we should probably have to go into the question of how much of which neurotransmitter-substance was being released in what areas, and maybe would have to go into yet more details of cellular chemistry. However, let us suppose it done. Then we would repeat the process with the other sorts of neuron in the same area (if any); then would add that completed description to similarly complete descriptions of the activity in the other relevantly-active brain areas and of the activity in the connecting neural links between them. The finished description would pick out 'the' brain state that correlates with the thought that one must buy more toothpaste, or that the object on the horizon is a windmill. It is patently obvious that such identity-conditions for brain states are wholly unrealistic in their stringency. The description-schema outlined would pick out a brain state that would never, and probably could never, recur, and hence a brain state that could not be a worthwhile member of the ontology of a science of neurophysiology; there are a number of reasons for this. First, many of the individual neurons listed may have decayed-they do not replace themselves, and after one's late teens several hundred decay each day. Second, the neurons involved may not be free the next time that the individual thinks that he must buy more toothpaste. Neurons are not 'toothpaste specific'; they do not lie idle in the interim, waiting until toothpaste is again considered. Most of the cells involved in the activity outlined above will be activated again and again, in different patterns and combinations, for different cerebral functions; so when the subject thinks a second time that he must buy more toothpaste, an enormous number of the neurons involved in his first thought will be otherwise engaged, or inactive in their refractory rest period. Third, the micro-organisation of the brain changes with time and experience. A pattern of neural firing may be triggered off, repeated, and established; but it is all the time liable to mutation, and will be modified by new but related inputs, or may become 'coded' for reasons of efficiency into a more economical pattern (it is unlikely, for example, that the visual cortex of the ordinary toothpaste-buyer will need to generate the cerebral correlate of a mental image of a tube of toothpaste as he remembers his</page><page sequence="5">Brain States 15 need for it; and even if it does,1 such an image may be more or less schematic on any given occasion). Every new input modifies, even if only fractionally, the neural organisation upon which it impinges. There is good evidence for this from temporal lobe stimulation. Such stimulation may evoke the same memory or hallucination on more than one occasion, but usually only if there is a very short time (up to a minute or two) between stimulations; if a longer time elapses between stimulations of the same area by the same (unmoved) electrode, a new memory or hallucination tends to be reported (see Valenstein [i973], pp. 110-4). Nothing is less static than the nervous system. That there should be cross-brain identity of brain states picked out by the above description-schema is, evidently, even more implausible. Not only do brains differ considerably in size and hence, presumably, in the total number of cells they contain (Anatole France's brain weighed I,Ioo grams, half the weight of Byron's at 2,zoo (Sagan [1977], p. 35 f.)), but they differ also in functional organisation. There are conclusive proofs of this. Left hemisphere dominance (by which I mean dominance for certain functions only, primarily linguistic and analytic ones; the right hemisphere is dominant for others) is totally absent in about a tenth of the population, and the degree of its dominance varies widely in the remaining nine-tenths. Since linguistic processes seem to play a large part in a great many cognitive abilities (see Bruner, Goodnow, and Austin [1956], passim; Luria [1973], chs. 12 and 13), the variation in the degree of cerebral dominance will carry with it a corresponding variability in the organisation of cognitive processes from person to person. The evidence of electrical and chemical stimulation of the unanaesthetised brain, and the evidence of lesions to the brain, strongly suggest the same conclusion. For example: stimulation of the septal region of the brain may in some people provoke pleasurable sexual sensations, but in others can arouse terror or anxiety (Valenstein [1973], p. 105 f.); no reliable correlations can be drawn between stimulation to the amygdala and the behavioural responses (see Heath, Monroe, and Mickle [1955]); patients with very similar lesions to the same areas of the prefrontal lobes may become either hyperactive or apathetic, there is no predicting which (see Teuber [1972]); there is a marked disagreement on whether psychosurgical operations on the anterior cingulum of the brain relieve extreme anxiety and depression or not (contrast Foltz and White [1962] with Scoville [197I]). If there is 1 There is some evidence that the visual cortex is involved in many more 'purely cognitive' activities than one might at first suppose; it perhaps does form the cerebral correlate of a mental image of a tube of toothpaste when we think about toothpaste, even if we are aware of no such image. See Luria [1973], PP. 315 ff., and Posner [1969].</page><page sequence="6">ix 6 Kathleen V. Wilkes so much difficulty in correlating broad and unspecific phenomena, such as moods, with stimulation of or damage to areas of the brain, it will clearly be yet more impracticable to hope to correlate cerebral processes with fine-grained events like thoughts about toothpaste. Even more important: the micro-functioning of brains will be as unique to the individual as are his fingerprints. Every stimulus has some effect on the brain, modifying, reinforcing, or disrupting both the existing neural patterns and the laying-down of new patterns-and evidently no two people have the same histories of sensory input. How each input is coded will be determined by a great number of factors, including the past history and neural patterning of the relevant cerebral areas and by the familiarity of the input (the brain finds 'short-cut' codings for recurrent, and hence familiar, inputs). In sum, brain states such as those suggested could play no role at all in the study of the organisation of the brain; hence they will not belong to the ontology of neurophysiology. There can be no worthwhile correlations between specific thoughts and brain states. This is, in fact, a conclusion that could have been reached without benefit of science, simply by considering what kind of mental ontology any systematic study of human experience and behaviour would require. Specific thoughts could have no part in this. Thoughts are intensional, and are therefore difficult to identify or reidentify-we do not know whether Joe's thought about Cicero is a thought about Tully or not, still less whether it is the same thought as Jim's thought about Tully. Moreover, since the mental realm is holistic, to attribute any specific thought to an agent presupposes that one is already tacitly ascribing to him a host of other thoughts (beliefs, desires, etc.), in terms of which the explicitly ascribed thought makes sense. This means that what thought we ascribe to anyone will depend as much, if not more, on what we already know and do not know about him-our implicit theory of his behaviour-as upon what thoughts, if any, are currently and consciously passing through his mind. In short, the mental realm, the ontology expressed in ordinary language, is not an ontology that purports to explain human experience and behaviour in any systematic way. It is admirably tailored to fit our non-scientific demand to predict or explain what a given individual, about whom we already know a certain amount, may do at a particular time and in a given set of circumstances, but is of little help in accounting for the behaviour of human beings in general. For that we need science. Many will think that I have spent too long flogging an already moribund horse; several philosophers have pointed out that the enterprise of correlating individual propositional attitudes with states of the brain is implausible in the extreme (e.g. Nagel [1965], part iv; Taylor (I967]).</page><page sequence="7">Brain States I 17 But the time spent has not been wasted. It has told us something about what brain states are not; and has incidentally shown that the hypothesis of 'brain reading' (the spy with the cerebroscope) is not a threatening one. If God could look into our brains he would not know what we were thinking. We can now pass from the negative thesis to a more positive one, and consider just what God-or the cerebroscopist-might be able to discover from a study of cerebral activity. 3 To see what brain states might be, it will be profitable to describe in outline some of the various brain processes that correlate with one kind of mental activity, the activity of seeing. Perception is a good example to take, as scientists have recently made great strides in understanding much of the process, even though a good deal remains dark. It is, for instance, much better known than are the processes of auditory perception. Moreover perceiving, although it undoubtedly has its 'purely sensory' side, touches upon cognitive abilities in so far as perceptual recognition is essential for full seeing, so that a study of perceiving cannot fail to shed some light upon the mysteries of thinking. The optic nerves travelling from each eye terminate (with one relay in the lateral geniculate nucleus of each hemisphere) in the primary areas of the occipital cortex, right at the back of the brain. Fibres from those cells that have received input from the right half of each eye's visual field end up in the occipital cortex of the left hemisphere, while those dealing with the left half-field end up in that of the right; so approximately half the fibres from each eye have to cross over each other on their way to the occipital lobes. When they reach the primary visual cortex the fibres fan out (the optic radiation) in such a way that the visual field is projected in a strictly somatotopical manner: the upper half of the field is projected at the base of the optic radiation, and the lower half at the top-thus, simply, the optic radiation of the left hemisphere encodes the right half of the visual field upside-down. The neurons of the primary visual cortex are highly specialised. Practically all of them are specific to vision; nearly all of them, like the retinal cells, react only to determinate features of the input-some reacting to colour or shade contrast, others only to convex or concave edges, others only to bar shapes, others only to bars on a particular alignment, and so on. This first stage of the visual process, therefore, preserves the discrete and detailed cues into which the retinal cells have broken-up the visual field, and locates those cues in one: one correspondence with their place in the visual field. Hence, as we would expect, stimulation of cells in this area evokes simple hallucinations-of spots, flashes, lines, or flames (Luria [1973], p. I14). Localised damage</page><page sequence="8">x 18 Kathleen V. Wilkes causes blind spots in the visual field; so long as the lesion is not extensive the rapid alteration of eye movements in the saccadic jumps can usually (although not invariably1) compensate for these spots so effectively that the individual may not even realise that he has them. Of this area, then, we can say that God, or the cerebroscopist, once they had worked out which neurons were specific to which sorts of input-features, could tell from the patterns of neural activity what the raw data of the perceptual field were. Above and overlapping the primary occipital zones lie the secondary zones, deeper in the brain, which receive input from the primary zones.2 Neurons in this area are still almost exclusively specific to sight, but are much less specific than are the cells of the primary cortex to features. They have shorter axons and are known as 'associative neurons', for associating is precisely their function: they arrange and synthesise the raw elements of perception transmitted from the primary visual cortex into complex and organised wholes. Good evidence for this comes from experiments upon commissurotomy patients; when presented with a stimulus (for example a photograph of a face) of which only one half has been shown, these patients will say unhesitatingly that they have seen the whole object (Trevarthen [1974], p. 254 f.); perception always 'goes beyond the information given'. That it is the secondary visual cortex that is primarily responsible for composing these Gestalts is supported, albeit indirectly, by the findings from both stimulation to, and lesions of, this cortical area. If the secondary visual cortex is stimulated the subject usually experiences complex visual hallucinations-of people, or of animals, trees, or buildings-in other words, the stimulation evokes patterns of neural activity that are fairly well-established patterns in that individual's history, whole complex patterns that get triggered off by an initial stimulation of a small subset of the cells involved. Lesions, on the other hand, can destroy the ability to see, draw, or picture whole complex objects. Luria tells of a patient who could look at a picture of a pair of spectacles and note the individual components (two circles, a cross-bar, projecting flanges), but who then asserted that it was a picture of a bicycle; and of another who saw a telephone with its dial but identified it as a clock (Luria [19731, 1 Some lesions to this area in the right hemisphere go unregarded and there is no compensatory activity; see Brain [1941]. 2 One should insert a caveat here that will apply both to the distinction now drawn between primary and secondary visual areas and to that shortly to be drawn between the secondary areas and the parieto-occipital region. The boundaries-whether of structure or of function-are neither sharp of themselves nor, predictably, do all neuropsychologists agree on where they should lie (see Teuber [1955], especially p. 278). I am in general following Luria's [1973] description of the functional organisation of the visual system.</page><page sequence="9">Brain States I 19 p. 116 f.). When these patients attempted to draw a complex object, they tended to draw a 'visual list' of the components-so that, for example, a patient might depict the four legs, head, body, trunk, and tail of an elephant, but in no sensible relation one with another; and the capacity to visualise, unless the visualised object is extremely simple, vanishes entirely. A further interesting feature of these secondary zones is that the two hemispheres begin to divide the labour. The left hemisphere (LH), as is well known, is in most people dominant for speech and all language-related abilities1; the secondary visual cortex of the LH seems, therefore, to be largely in charge of the recognition of letters and words. A lesion here, even though it may leave unscathed the ability to perceive Gestalts, can disrupt the recognition of letters while leaving untouched the recognition of objects; lesions to the right hemisphere (RH) very rarely have this effect. On the other hand a lesion to the secondary zone of the RH, while also leaving unimpaired the perception of complexes, may produce the fascinating phenomenon of prosopagnosia-the inability to recognise faces. The patient knows that a face is a face; but whose face it is, even if it is the face of a friend or relative, or his own in a mirror, he is unable to say (Bornstein [1963]; Gardner [i977], pp. I53-6). Other lesions to this area of the RH may disrupt the recognition of familiarity, when patients fail to recognise some object as their own-although once they handle it, it is soon enough recognised. Lesions to the corresponding part of the LH do not have this effect. There seems to be little that God or the cerebroscopist could discover from a study of activity in the secondary visual cortex. It is the unique micro-organisation of the individual brain that determines just what neural activity in the secondary visual cortex correlates with the synthesising of circles and lines into a pair of spectacles; it is the unique history of the individual's experience that determines what neural activity underlies the recognition of familiar people or objects. All that could be inferred from the study of micro-processes in the secondary visual areas would be that some fairly complex perceiving (or visualising or hallucinating) was going on; but no more. Full-blooded perception requires yet more than this; but for part of the extra we have to turn to the highly complex and still highly mysterious area of the angular gyrus. This area borders on, and overlaps, the occipital, 1 To say that it is dominant for linguistic functions is neither to assert that the RH has negligible linguistic capacities nor that it is not heavily involved in language processing. The linguistic capacities of the RH are explored in Hecaen [1978] and Zaidel [1978]; that it is as active as the LH during linguistic processing is indicated by measuring the blood-flow by radioactive isotopes; see Lassen, Ingvar and Skinhoj [1978].</page><page sequence="10">120 Kathleen V. Wilkes parietal, and temporal regions, and so its visual functions mesh with other sensory abilities and with linguistic processes. The nearer we are to the parieto-occipital part of the angular gyrus area the more, generally speaking, we will find complex but still primarily or distinctively visual functions; but even then they tend to be infused by contributions from other sensory modalities, and by the language systems. For example, it would seem that the parieto-occipital area is largely responsible for the ability to organise perceived objects in visual space, so that the position of objects in relation to one another on the frontal, sagittal, and horizontal planes can be accurately detected. Moreover, it seems to be required for 'simultaneous synthesis'-an activity whereby a whole situation, of which the individual items have been processed serially by the occipital cortex, may be perceived as a single whole at a single time. Evidence for these conjectures again comes from patients with damage to this area; such people are often unable to tell the time from the position of the hands on a clock, cannot say which elements of a visual array are above, below, behind, or to the left or right of, other elements; they fail to see a group of objects, and are frequently unable to work out the theme of a moderately complex narrative picture (Luria [19731, p. 234). These same lesions disrupt not only the visual functions mentioned, but also interfere with a host of other abilities that we do not tend to regard as particularly 'visual'. If the lesion is to the dominant hemisphere, for example, then not only spatial relations but also logical, grammatical, mathematical, and temporal ones may be hard to grasp. Sentences con- taining words like 'before', 'under', 'therefore', 'afterwards', or in- corporating relative or propositional clauses, passive verb forms, or the possessive (e.g. 'father's brother') are rarely understood; and operations of addition and subtraction are performed badly (Luria [19731, PP- 151-6). Although, then, we can legitimately say that this area is involved in complex visual processing, it may prove more perspicuous to describe the disrupted ability as the recognition of relations in general-an ability that includes inter alia visuo-spatial relations. Another LH function where vision merges with non-visual capacities is reading. The clearest evidence for this comes from patients with a rather specific lesion to the parieto-occipital zone of the LH.1 Such patients are those with pure alexia-a condition that disturbs the recognition of words, 1 The lesion is one that destroys the visual cortex of the LH and penetrates deep into the white matter of the parieto-occipital junction, thus cutting off the visual data of the visual cortex of the RH from the language centres of the LH (Geschwind [19741, P. 384). In fact the parieto-occipital area can be spared and the same pure alexia produced by a lesion that damages the splenium (the lower end of the corpus callosum), for this too cuts off the RH's visual cortex from the LH (Geschwind [19741, PP. 4-15).</page><page sequence="11">Brain States z21 or of letters, or both; sometimes with, but often without, preventing the recognition of objects and people, of printed numbers (Hinshelwood [1900], p. 12), or (perhaps) of musical notation.' The only other capacity that is regularly disturbed along with reading is the capacity to name colours on sight (Geshwind [1974], ch. IX). It is difficult to know whether such difficulties should be called 'visual' or not. The pure alexic clearly sees the symbols 'DIX' when he reads them as '509' rather than as the syllable 'diks' (Gardner [1977], p. i6); besides, he can copy letters (although, since he treats them as shapes rather than as letters, the product is less fluent than is his spontaneous writing (Geschwind [19741, p. 395 f.); and some patients are alexic for letters but not words, or words but not letters (Hinshelwood [900oo], passim), or English but not French words (Gardner [1977], p. I21), all of which augurs normal visual acuity. Even if he cannot name colours on sight, he remains able to match and sort them accurately enough (unless he has an independent defect in colour vision (Geschwind [1974], ch. IX). So, in a sense there is 'nothing wrong with' his sight; however, in as much as something very odd is going on with the processing of verbal materials of a certain type,2 the phenomenon should be included in our account. The contribution of the parieto-occipital zone of the RH is even less well understood; it may indeed be that its functional organisation is not differentiated to the same extent as is that of the LH (Luria [1973], p. 164). It seems safe to say that it plays a larger part than the corresponding area of the LH in many visuo-spatial activities: finding one's way around a familiar locale or building, detecting line-orientation and perceiving depth -in general, organising three-dimensional space-and there is some evidence that it is required for the individual to relate visual stimuli to his own past experience: a patient of Luria's with a right-sided lesion, when looking at a photograph of a group of soldiers sitting on a tank, described it as a picture of her father, sisters, and children (Luria [x9731, p. 126 f.). But the scope and powers of the RH are as yet largely unknown. The last important cerebral area to mention in a discussion of the cerebral basis of perception is the region of the frontal lobes. It is impossible to exaggerate the range and diversity of the functions of these lobes; but one of their many tasks is to control the activity of perceiving, stamping upon it its directed and purposive character. This area, by controlling the saccadic eye movements, ensures that a complex visual object is 1 See Hinshelwood [I9oo], p. zo. Geschwind, however, finds alexia without amusia to be a rare and probably non-existent condition (Geschwind 1[974], PP. 396-7); and it has to be admitted that Hinshelwood cites no cases of it. 2 I examine this oddity in 'Brain Lesions' (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="12">122 Kathleen V. Wilkes scanned efficiently and economically, and is actively searched for clues to its identity; it forms hypotheses' about what the object might be (so, to go back to the patient mentioned earlier with damage to the secondary visual cortex who guessed that a picture depicted a bicycle rather than a pair of spectacles, he was at least able to form an intelligent conjecture based on inference from what he saw, as his frontal lobes were undamaged) and in terms of these hypotheses it guides the searching movements; in short, it makes perception a goal-directed activity. Thus, lesions to the relevant parts of the frontal lobes will not disturb simple perception; the patient is probably able to perceive and recognise elementary pictures, to read short and easy sentences, to read numbers, and to recognise faces and familiar objects. But difficult visual objects, that require some interpreta- tion, might not be recognized or understood. A hat upside-down might be seen as a plate; an ambiguous picture, like that of the duck-rabbit, may be seen either as a duck or as a rabbit, but once it has been seen as one can- not be seen as the other; complex narrative pictures are not understood; and it often proves difficult if not impossible to perform such actions as tracing with a finger the outline of a cross on the black and white squares of a chessboard (Luria [1973], pp. 240-2). Experiments have shown that the eye movements of these patients, when they are studying a picture, do not display the controlled and economical searching movements of the normal perceiver but instead wander about at random, failing to pick out or concentrate upon the significant features of the display (Luria [9731], pp. 216-I8). Were it not for the frontal lobes, it is clear that perception would be a vastly impoverished matter. We have mentioned four distinguishable areas of the cortex that are involved in perception (four if the corresponding areas of LH and RH are counted as one), and have touched upon a few of the very diverse activities in which the brain must engage if its owner is to see and recognise items of heterogeneous types. Using this as a model, we can go on to consider what descriptions of what brain states might be expected to correlate in lawlike fashion with what descriptions of what mental states. 4 It is evident at once that we can rule out the notion that any single brain area is 'the' locus for any mental state, event, or process. Localisation had its heyday in the early nineteenth century, when Gall and Spurzheim drew their maps of the brain, in which they would allocate one clearly defined and discrete region to 'amativeness', others to 'veneration', 'mirthfulness', 'firmness', 'secretiveness', 'self-esteem', 'hope', and even 1 The use of this apparently anthropomorphic description will be defended shortly.</page><page sequence="13">Brain States 123 'marvellousness' (Gall and Spurzheim [i81o-I8]). Neuropsychologists can indeed draw what may well be described as 'functional maps' of the brain, filled out in greater or lesser detail; but in such a map what will correspond to 'perceiving' will be a complex series of processes, involving at least four brain masses that are functionally and topologically distinguishable, a series within which each contributory structure has its own essential roles. Even the cerebral correlates of the mental events that seem intuitively most simple-i.e. minimally cognitive-such as the experiencing of hunger, thirst, and pain,' cannot begin to be localised in just one area. The next obvious point to make is that the battery of ordinary language mental terms cannot all be correlated with distinct series of cerebral processes, no matter how complicated such processes may be. This should be evident; nothing in the brain can distinguish seeing from looking at, knowing from believing, wanting from desiring, intending from purposing, remembering from recalling, and the like; such distinctions, which the richness of ordinary language mental terms allows, could not be captured in neurophysiological terms. It is easy to see why this must be so: the diversity and wealth of ordinary language provide not only for the purposes that the vernacular shares with science (description and explanation), but also provide for countless non-scientific purposes. We say, for example, 'X knows that p' if we want to endorse his belief, but may choose 'X thinks that p' if we are sneering at him; by means of a careful selection of terms we can applaud, condemn, blame, correct, deprecate, urge, compliment, condole, plead, grade, and do many other things far too numerous to list. The choice of terms is just as much a matter of our attitude to the agent as it is a matter of what (if anything) we conjecture to be passing through his mind at the time. Any mental state that we might realistically expect to relate in lawlike fashion with a series of processes in the brain must be distinct and distinguishable from any other such state; hence the vast majority of ordinary language mental terms will not enter into the laws relating mental to physical except indirectly--except, that is, insofar as they can be understood in terms of the concepts that are to be related to neurophysiological descriptions. A third obvious point, related to the last, is that the members of the privileged set of mental concepts that remain as explananda must be freed of many of the conceptual links with which vernacular usage endows them. For example, 'see' is usually taken to be an achievement ('got-it') verb, and hence, it is sometimes said, cannot be a time-taking process; and many 1The philosopher reluctant to plough through the scientific literature on pain will find its complex structure described in Dennett [1978].</page><page sequence="14">124 Kathleen V. Wilkes would claim that it is inapplicable unless there is a public object that is seen. Similarly 'remember', as strictly used, implies that what is re- membered is indeed the case. One could cite many more of these common implications. Evidently, though, such linguistic conventions will not do for the purposes of psychology or neuropsychology. For their purposes, seeing has to be considered to be a complex and highly intricate constel- lation of processes, a constellation that is active with only minor variations whether what is 'seen' is a public object, an illusion, a dream, an image, or a hallucination; while remembering will correlate with the same sorts of processes whether what is remembered did indeed happen or not. The next point, again closely related to the last, is that (neuro)psychology needs a vocabulary to describe more kinds of entity than the mental concepts of the vernacular need to do. For ordinary language mental concepts are, almost by definition, ascribable only to whole sentient organisms; whereas psychologists and neuropsychologists, as we have seen, need to describe the capacities and operations of various areas of the brain as well as the behaviour of the individual person. Crudely, it is necessary to describe what the angular gyrus region does when one is analysing the capacity of the person to see. What psychology does when confronted with this problem is exactly what all other sciences do; it borrows terms from the vernacular, but having adopted them, will then adapt them to fit its descriptive and explanatory tasks-freeing them from overlap with other concepts, freeing them from the network of semantic implication that everyday usage has bestowed upon them, and trying to delimit their new sphere of operations more explicitly than is common or necessary in our day-to-day vocabulary. (Compare the way that physics has handled 'force', 'mass', and 'energy'.) One of the implications that this process of denaturalisation may have for at least some of the borrowed concepts is that their subject need no longer be a whole organism; one can unashamedly describe the operations of, say, the parieto-occipital area by means of terms which, qua ordinary language terms, are misused or metaphorical, but qua scientific terms are legitimately literal (in a well- developed conceptual structure1). Hence, brain structures may be said to 'code' information without the scare-quotes; or may be characterised as analysing, interpreting, synthesising, grouping together, checking, correcting, scanning, and so forth, without criticism.2 (It goes without 1 There is, of course, no such consistent and generally-accepted conceptual system at present. I am talking in a hortatory rather than a descriptive manner about the conceptual structure at which neuropsychologists should aim. 2 I have discussed this point elsewhere in greater detail (Wilkes [1974]). A similar line is taken by D. C. Dennett (Dennett [1978]), and, more explicitly, in Dennett [9751].</page><page sequence="15">Brain States 125 saying, of course, that the more complicated the functions ascribed to complicated brain structures, the more it is clear that we need still to do; a complex function performed by a complex structure is something which in its turn demands analysis and dissection into less and less intricate functions performed by less and less intricate structures. It is a sign that we are getting close to the nitty-gritty neural level when we can talk in terms of the functions of identifiable groups of cells-the primary visual cortex will presumably be the first of the cortical areas involved in vision to permit such understanding of its microstructure.) It is vital, then, to note the distinction between 'the mental' (the vernacular) and 'the psychological' (the scientific); failure to do so is to forget that psychology is a science. These four considerations suffice for the first conclusion: that the 'mind' relata of the mind-body problem are not the events, states, and processes picked out by ordinary language mental terms, but are rather those events, states, and processes that are discovered or postulated by the science of psychology, and are articulated in the conceptual apparatus of that science. Terms to describe the behaviour of an individual organism at the global level have to be denaturalised just as much as the terms adapted for the purpose of describing the functions of, say, the frontal lobes; seeing, writing, reading, calculating etc. all have to be stripped of more or less of the baggage of grammatical-conceptual implication (baggage that is essential, of course, for their everyday roles) if they are to be adequate as concepts that (a) can describe and explain human behaviour per- spicuously and systematically-that is, scientifically; and (b) are tolerant of their dissection and analysis into the contributory functions that mesh to realise them. Their use in psychology seems at first so close to the ordinary language use-the layman and the psychologist will almost always agree on whether or not someone is seeing or reading something-that the real and important distinctions get overlooked; but the mental and the psychological differ substantially (as is only to be expected when one reflects upon their very distinct functions) and the difference emerges clearly enough on any close examination. If this is true, then a second conclusion follows, giving a completely different twist to the question of whether the mind can be related in lawlike fashion to the body: it is no longer, for scientists, an open question at all. For we no longer have, in advance, all the items on one side of the disputed relation, the 'mind' side; we have at best a very few of them- 'seeing', 'hearing', 'remembering', 'experiencing pain', 'hungering', 'thirsting', and a few more. As for the rest of the 'mind' relata, we discover just what they will have to be (and the 'body' relata as well) as a result of</page><page sequence="16">x26 Kathleen V. Wilkes studying the links that can be shown to hold between psychological and neurophysiological events, states and processes. Put another way, the development of both psychological and neurophysiological theories will be bound by two constraints: first, that they suffice to explain the facts of human and cerebral behaviour, respectively; and second, that they can be connected in lawlike fashion with one another. The reason for this second constraint is not however mere optimism that psychological theory can indeed be grounded in neurophysiological theory. It is rather that psychological theory needs neurophysiological theory as much as, if not more than, neurophysiology needs psychology. The discussion of the cerebral basis of perception bears out this contention. Electrical and chemical stimulation of the brain, the suppression by sodium amytal injections of the functioning of some areas, and the study of brain damage, have produced evidence enabling us to discover what the functions are- the psychological functions-that various structures of the brain fulfil, and by fulfilling which they enable the person to see and recognise a complex object; findings like these unfold much of the hitherto concealed psycho- logical structure of concepts such as 'seeing', 'calculating', 'reading', 'hearing', 'remembering', or 'experiencing pain'. We have seen how the neuropsychological data have enabled scientists to conjecture that perception involves, inter alia, that parts of the brain analyse the visual input into the raw data of edges, colour contrasts, concavity, and so forth, that other regions synthesise this into an organised and structured whole, while yet other parts position it in a visuo-spatial array and classify and code it, often under the categories of language; while still another region guides the whole process by purpose and conjecture. Psychology alone might have guessed at this structure, but there could be several rival theories other than the conjectured one that sufficed to explain the observed behaviour; neuropsychological data can often cut down the number of competing theories to a manageable minimum, and hence reveal the concealed psychological structure of these global processes more effectively than can sciences that do not go inside the brain. Neuro- psychology has revealed some unexpected things about the structure of psychological processes, facts that would be virtually unobtainable without it: for instance, that the reading of words has a different structure from the reading of numbers; that linguistic competence is probably much more heavily involved in recognition than one might have guessed; that the hearing of melodic tones requires a rather different analysis from the hearing of non-melodic materials; and that apparently distinct abilities, such as reading a clock, telling left from right, identifying one's fingers, grasping grammatical and logical relations, finding one's way around a</page><page sequence="17">Brain States 127 building, and arithmetical calculation, must share a largely similar structure. Conversely, where neuropsychological data remain as yet inadequate or inconclusive-as seems to be the case with the study of memory-there psychological theory runs riot and is notable chiefly for an abundance of conflicting and often implausible hypotheses; a recent treatise on human memory postulates no fewer than twenty-five types of memory storage (Dunham [1977], p. 142 f.), and it would probably be possible to find psychologists who were prepared to argue for each of the options one to twenty-four. In short, psychology relies upon neuro- physiology whenever it goes into secure psychological detail; small wonder, then, that these two sciences beg the question of the mind-body problem in advance. Indeed, the observant reader may have noticed that I have often used 'neuropsychology' where one might have sometimes expected 'psychology' and sometimes 'neurophysiology'. This was deliberate, and encapsulates the dissolution of the mind-body problem; no longer do we have two sciences which must somehow be forced to fit each other, but instead a single study, neuropsychology (or 'psycho- physiology') whose molar level we can if we wish term 'psychology', and whose micro level we can call 'neurophysiology', and which straddles comfortably what was thought to be the no-man's-land of the intermediate region. Itself being neither psychology nor neurophysiology but over- lapping both, its concepts, similarly, are neither; so it tolerates no psychological-physical dichotomy. The final conclusion to draw from this discussion of brain states has been mentioned in passing already, but it may as well be explicitly restated now. It is the point that individual psychological occurrences, whether or not classified into types by the ordinary language criterion of 'same content' cannot and should not be thought of as entering into lawlike relations with brain processes. Indeed, the point is obvious; but few philosophers (Aristotle excepted) seem to have acted on it. It is, of course, the psycho- logical capacities of human beings with which psychology is concerned, those capacities by means of which human experience and behaviour can most readily be explained. Similarly, the medical researcher is not primarily concerned with how and why Fred 'caught a cold' at time t; he wants to know how best to classify the illnesses of which the vernacular term 'a cold' is the common lay description, and, having done that, seeks to discover how and why anyone can contract each of these diseases, at any time. Fred is interesting to him, if at all, as one more piece of evidence for an illness in one of his categories, a piece of evidence which his theory needs to find room for. So it is with all the sciences; and so much for the yearning to get neurophysiologists to tell us what process in the brain I</page><page sequence="18">128 Kathleen V. Wilkes correlates with X's thought at t that he must buy more toothpaste, or with anyone's thought at any time that he or she must buy more toothpaste. In sum: the mental (by which I mean the ordinary language mental ontology) is at two removes from the physical (by which I mean the referents of neurophysiological descriptions of sequences of cerebral processes). To discuss the relation of everyday concepts with physical ones, we have first to give up talking about an individual occurrence of b-ing at time t, and turn to talk instead about the capacity to 0; then we must specify in the alternative and scientific vocabulary of psychology what state or states we are asking about. For example, the original question 'How did John remember my telephone number?' will be transmuted, via 'How do people remember telephone numbers?' into 'How is it that people can store a string of numbers in medium-term memory?' The next stage is to learn about the psychological-physical correlation by learning how the psychological process (for it is now a process) can be unfolded into a structure, each element of which-or the constituents of each element of which-is embodied in some complex neural processes. Above all, the step of translating from the mental to the psychological cannot be omitted. To suppose that it could be omitted would be as gross a mistake as it would be to wonder why particle physics cannot provide lawlike correlations between the entities and processes of its domain and objects like cuckoo-clocks, cameras, or copies of Candide.1 1 Earlier versions of this paper were read at Oxford and MacMaster, and it has been much improved by the criticisms it received at both places.
