Lesure, Aleksander Borejsza, Jennifer Carballo, Charles Frederick, Virginia Popper, and Thomas A. Wake We propose that pottery-using villages did not appear in the upland Apizaco region of central Tlaxcala, Mexico, until after 1000 B.C., centuries after such developments in choice locations for maize agriculture. We excavated at two of the earliest known Formative sites in the region. That work revealed abundant intact refuse deposits, allowing us to evaluate an exist ing ceramic chronology with new radiocarbon dates as well as characterize Formative subsistence. Our results support a more general model of emerging sedentism in central Mexico involving population dispersions from prime agricultural areas to zones of higher elevation. The earliest pottery-using agriculturalists in Apizaco were probably migrants from adjacent regions.

Research into the origins of food production in Mesoamerica encompasses a variety of problem foci, from the domestication and diffusion of crops to the development of agricul tural systems and the establishment of permanent villages. The last of these?the emergence of vil lage life?is routinely linked to the appearance of ceramics and thus a "Formative" lifestyle. Although there is no necessary connection between village life and pottery, the rarity of claims for preceramic villages (e.g., Wilkerson 1975) suggests that the two were associated in ancient Mesoamerica. Important questions remain, though, about the For mative transition, including the degree to which local cases were independent and the extent to which the transition itself was founded on agricul tural subsistence. The issue of independence concerns the texture of the emergence of sedentary communities. Were there numerous independent shifts to sedentism, or did certain centers of development generate popu lation expansion and colonization of neighboring regions? Mesoamericanists emphasize indepen dence, but they also, with less fanfare, identify pop Richard G.

For example, Sanders et al. (1979:95-97) argue that agriculturalists moved into the Basin of Mexico from lower-lying areas to the south. Recently, population expansions among early agriculturalists have received new theoretical attention on a worldwide basis (Bellwood 2005), and further work on Mesoamerican patterns is in order. Hill's (2001) reconstruction of Uto-Aztecan expansion implies large-scale movements of agri culturalists in western and northern Mexico. Fur ther to the south, linguistic diversity and the widespread, contemporaneous appearance of ceramics by the mid-second millennium B.C. sug gest, instead, a number of independent develop ments (see Clark and Cheetham 2002:Figure 2), with the potential for population movement being relegated to intervening areas. The transition to agricultural lifeways in Mesoamerica likely involved both migrations and independent shifts, with the interrelations between the two involving questions of scale. A second domain of inquiry is variation in the relation between subsistence and early sedentism. Hunter-gatherer subsistence systems can provide a basis for sedentism and complexity (Arnold 1996), particularly in situations of resource abundance (Hayden 1990). For Mesoamerica, such work raises questions about subsistence in the earliest Forma tive. Was a "Mesoamerican" emphasis on maize, beans, and squash in place at the Formative transi tion, or was there variation over time (Smalley and Blake 2003:684) or from region to region? There are indications in both the highlands and the low lands that certain resource-rich environments pro vided settings for sedentism based primarily on wild foods (Blake et al. 1992; Niederberger 1979). These two domains of inquiry?population expansions versus independent developments and the importance of domesticated as opposed to wild foods?appear to be loosely related. Formative transitions triggered by the in-migration of farm ers should be associated with developed agricul tural systems, whereas transitions based on wild foods would imply considerable local indepen dence. Of course, the two issues should not be col lapsed. Transitions to an agricultural Formative generated by local processes (and thus "indepen dent") are perfectly plausible, as in Flannery's (1986:26-27) model for Oaxaca. Any understand ing of the interplay of these processes will there fore require empirical input, the sorting out of occu pation sequences and subsistence evidence at mul tiple temporal and geographical scales. Fieldwork in the State of Tlaxcala, Mexico, allows us to contribute incrementally to such a pro ject. Previous researchers report a ceramic occu pation in Tlaxcala from 1700 B.C., placing it among the earliest such developments in the central high lands (all B.C. dates are in calendar years). Because our study region in central Tlaxcala is marginal to the best settings for agriculture, a sedentary, maize focused occupation in the area from 1700 B.C. would have implications for understandings of the interplay between independent transitions versus population movements in the central highlands. Specifically, it would imply widespread, indepen dent shifts to agriculture irrespective of the suit ability of local environments. By implication, such a model would leave little possible role for popu lation expansion. But was there really an early, agriculture-based Formative in central Tlaxcala? We examined two possibilities: that there are problems with the cur rent chronology or that subsistence diverged from maize agriculture. Our results indicate that the ear liest Formative of central Tlaxcala was fully agri cultural but that it emerged after 1000 B.C., centuries after such developments in choice loca tions. These results bring Tlaxcala more in line with what is known from the rest of the central high lands and provide some support for a model of emerging sedentism involving population disper sions at a regional scale from prime agricultural areas during the late second to early first millen nium B.C. Study Area and Specific Research Questions The Late Archaic and initial Formative of the cen tral highlands of Mexico are still poorly under stood. Niederberger (1976, 1979) found evidence for year-round exploitation of the lake environment at Tlapacoya-Zohapilco around 2500-2000 B.C., suggestive of early sedentism tied to abundant nat ural resources. There is not, however, evidence for large Late Archaic populations, sedentary or oth erwise, and indeed, the Formative is likewise poorly known before approximately 1400 B.C. The Nevada phase in the basin is identified primarily from Zohapilco. The best record of pre-1400 B.C.</page><page sequence="3">476 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 17, No. 4, 2006 settlement comes from lower-lying areas of More los and Puebla (Aviles 1997; Cyphers Guillen and Grove 1987; Grove 1974; Hirth 1987). It is only with Manantial and related phases beginning circa 1150 B.C. (2950 B.P. in radiocarbon years) that occupation is documented across much of central Mexico (e.g., Aufdermauer 1973; Niederberger 1987; Ramirez et al. 2000; Tolstoy 1989). In this light, the early settlement beginning 1700/1600 B.C. reported by Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion for Tlaxcala takes on considerable interest (Garcia Cook 1981; Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion 1997a, 1997b). Those authors iden tify four Formative ceramic complexes and assign them to sequential phases from 1700 B.C. through A.D. 100 (a distinction between complexes and phases proves useful). The complexes and dates assigned by Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion are Tzompantepec (1700/1600-1200 B.C.), Tlatempa (1200-800 B.C.), Texoloc (800-350 B.C.), and Tezoquipan (350 B.C.-A.D. 100). The earliest complex, Tzompantepec, is identified at 13 sites in Tlaxcala, plus another 14 in adjacent parts of Puebla (Garc?a Cook and Merino Carrion 1997a:307, Fig ure 5). Central Tlaxcala is well represented, with six sites; surveys immediately to the north suggest that they form a northern limit of this early occu pation (Merino Carrion 1989; Snow 1966). Central Tlaxcala was chosen as a focus of our work in part because two reported Tzompante pec/Tlatempa sites were identifiable and, despite destruction through erosion and modern agricul ture, contained intact areas amenable to excavation. The study region centers on the Apizaco Basin of central Tlaxcala (Figure 1) and includes the Upper Zahuapan River, which flows into the adjacent Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley. Also included are the lower northwestern slopes of the La Malinche volcano. This region overlaps with the southernmost part of Snow's (1966) survey, but the most ambitious pre vious research in the area was directed by Garcia Cook in the 1970s and identified hundreds of sites across much of Tlaxcala (Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion 1997a). Apizaco is not a choice area for growing maize. Frost and hail are common, though damage is erratic. The frequency of frosts generally increases with elevation (much of the region lies above 2,400 m), but on a local scale cold air settles in topo graphic lows, such as slopes adjacent to barran cas. There is significant variation in yearly rainfall, but it is difficult to mitigate with wells or canals. The Zahuapan is the only river that carries water all year. Most streams witness only summer flash floods and flow in deeply incised valleys. The groundwater table is several tens of meters deep in most locations. It is unclear, however, how far back the modern hydrography can be retrodicted. Despite such lingering uncertainties, the Puebla Tlaxcala Basin, immediately southwest of our study region, provides important contrasts. It is blessed with a lower elevation, two large perma nent rivers, and high water tables that sustained a patchwork of wetlands until the early twentieth century (Luna Morales 1993). Why would some of the earliest settled villages in Mexico appear in a comparatively marginal area such as Apizaco? One possibility was that the estab lished dating was incorrect. However, inspired by Niederberger's claims for year-round Archaic occu pation at Zohapilco, we identified a second possi bility. Although the suggestion had not previously been made for the Apizaco area, we postulated that shallow lakes could have provided a resource base conducive of early sedentism. We derived the idea from paleoclimatic and geological studies by Lauer (1979) and Erffa et al. (1977). Also relevant were the historical existence of a lake to the southwest of the study region near the large Formative site of Xochit?catl (Espinoza 1998; Serra Puche 1998:20) and an apparent vacant spot in Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion's (1997a: figs. 6-11) Formative site distributions near Apizaco that appeared to cor respond with a lake postulated by Lauer. Plausibly, a different hydrography 3,000 years ago could have provided abundant lacustrine resources to offset the agricultural marginality and promote early sedentism. With this "lacustrine hypothesis" in hand, we joined subsistence studies to our evaluation of chronology. Since 2000, we have conducted archaeological investigations at Formative village sites (directed by Lesure) as well as more wide ranging geomorphological studies (supervised by Frederick). Two of our specific research questions were (1) Can Garcia Cook's Formative ceramic complexes and chronology be verified in the Apizaco region? and (2) What did Formative vil lagers eat? Were abundant aquatic resources avail able, and if so, were they eaten?</page><page sequence="4">Lesure et al.] CHRONOLOGY, SUBSISTENCE, AND THE FORMATION OF CENTRAL TLAXCALA 477 Figure 1.

The Formative Sequence in Apizaco We have excavated at four Formative sites, but we report here only on the two identified by Garcia Cook (1972) as having Early Formative (Tzom pantepec) occupation. Tetel, on a small cinder cone near the Zahuapan River, was a Middle Formative village of 2 ha (Garcia Cook's T-26). Amomoloc, 9 km to the southeast toward the lower slopes of La Malinche, had a Formative occupation cover ing several ha (Garcia Cook's T-79, subject of reports by Abascal [1976, 1996]).

Chronological pottery analyses conducted by Lesure and Carballo substantiate the first three of Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion's (1997b) For mative pottery complexes. Features at Tetel and Amomoloc can easily be assigned to one of those complexes. Our Tzompantepec sample derives from the fill of a single bell-shaped pit (Feature 46) at Amo moloc (Figure 2).

Tlatempa ollas have burnished exteriors, scraped interiors, and outcurving necks, like the Tzom pantepec ollas, but over 95 percent have direct rims. The most common figurine is Cl defined by Vail lant (193 lb) at Zacatenco; C10 also appears, appar ently in later Tlatempa features (Figure 3b-c). Our Texoloc sample derives primarily from Tetel (Figure 5). In the service ware, white (14-31 percent of all rims) and red-on-white (3-7 percent) are less prominent, and decoration tends toward incising rather than excising.

The predominant figurine form is E2, described by Vaillant (1931a) from Ticom?n (Figure 3d). An important consideration is the degree to which we have replicated Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion's complexes. We are confident of the match with Tlatempa and Texoloc. The validity of our identification of Tzompantepec is particularly important. There appear to be three bases on which it could be challenged: our sample is small (110 rims); we report a greater variety of forms than do Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion (1997b); and the coffee bean eyes of Feature 46 figurines are not illustrated by those authors or described by Trejo (1997). We address those challenges as follows. First, the contents of Feature 46 form a coherent collection that differs from those we assign to Tlatempa in several artifact categories. Second, although we find a greater variety of vessel forms than appears in Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion's brief description of the complex, the general char acteristics of our assemblage are consistent with their account. Third, Garcia Cook's sample of</page><page sequence="9">482 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 17, No. 4, 2006 Tzompantepec figurines appears to be similar in size to ours. We found 17 anthropomorphic heads and torsos; Trejo (1997:28) mentions 16. There are also some matches (Cl and Tzompantepec 1), despite the lack of coffee bean eyes among the six heads illustrated by Trejo or Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion. We cannot rule out the possibility that Feature 46?with its variety of forms, includ ing dishes with rounded bases that differ from Tlatempa only in rim form?represents a "late" Tzompantepec in comparison to materials described by Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion. However, we would be skeptical of such a claim, based on the high frequency of Cl figurines, a Tlatempa diagnostic, in their sample: 50 percent, according to Trejo (1997:31). The balance of evi dence favors identification of Feature 46 as legiti mately "Tzompantepec." We obtained five radiocarbon dates from pit fea tures at Amomoloc and eight from Tetel (Table 1). One Amomoloc sample (AA-43607) yielded a sur prisingly late date and is rejected. All other dates are Formative but younger than expected based on Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion's chronology. The Tzompantepec dates are oldest, falling between 1000 and 800 B.C. Both dates are from the same pit, most likely filled between 910 and 830 B.C. (the overlap of the 2-sigma calibrated ranges for the dates). Tlatempa and Texoloc dates are younger than Tzompantepec, but they entirely overlap with each other, falling between 800 and 400 B.C. We do not believe that Tlatempa and Texoloc were contemporary. They can be distinguished by a variety of traits, including figurine styles and, in the pottery, surface finish, decoration, and vessel form. Features within a couple of meters of each other can be readily classified as Tlatempa or Tex oloc with no evidence of mixing. At Tetel, one Tex oloc pit cuts into a Tlatempa feature, but we have no other definite stratigraphie relations. The overlapping of dates for these two sequen tial phases is probably to be expected given mul tiple reversals in the calibration curve corresponding to radiocarbon years 2550-2400 B.P. Any date with a substantial portion of its prob ability distribution in this interval is likely to have multiple intercepts on the calibration curve and a calibrated range that includes much of the span 800-400 B.C. With the calibration curve effec tively flat for this era, radiocarbon simply cannot be used to distinguish events within this span (Bowman 1994:842). Given these problems, pottery and figurine com parisons are crucial to the temporal placement of the Apizaco complexes. There are strong cross ties with the Basin of Mexico. In particular, the Tlatempa/Texoloc transition replicates changes in both pottery and figurines in the Zacatenco/ Ticom?n transition of the Basin. Thus, Texoloc, with red, brown, and red-on-brown pottery, a greater frequency of composite silhouette bowls, and E2 figurines, can be correlated with Ticom?n 1 (Tolstoy 1978:258-259). Tlatempa, with its post slip incised or excised white pottery, rounded bottom bowls, and C1/C10 figurines, can be correlated in a general way with Zacatenco as used by various investigators (Niederberger 1976,1987; Ramirez et al. 2000; Tolstoy 1975, 1978; Tolstoy et al. 1977) and with the later Cantera phase at Chalcatzingo (Cyphers Guillen 1987; Cyphers Guillen and Grove 1987). Its most common diag nostic, the interior-ledge rim dish (Figure 4c-f), is reported from the Basin of Mexico and the Puebla Tlaxcala Valley with chronological placements hovering around the mid-first millennium B.C. (Aufdermauer 1973; McBride 1974; McCafferty 1996:302-304; Ramirez et al. 2000; Serra Puche et al. 2004). For Tzompantepec, radiocarbon dates suggest a post-Manantial, Tetelpan (Niederberger 1976, 1987) placement. Artifact analyses support such an interpretation. The white slips immediately suggest the late second or early first millennium. In the Basin of Mexico, white slips before about 900 B.C. are associated with flat-based bowls with outslop ing walls and direct, unmodified rims (Niederberger 1987:636; Tolstoy 1978:253-256). The pattern seems less clear at Chalcatzingo (Cyphers Guillen 1987), but it characterizes assemblages as far away as Oaxaca (Flannery and Marcus 1994) and? significantly?as close to Apizaco as Moyotzingo (Aufdermauer 1973). The assemblage of Feature 46, with several flat but mostly rounded bases among the open vessels, is plausibly on the cusp of the change in base form. It would thus corre spond to Tetelpan in Niederberger's terminology. Characteristic Manantial figurines (Dl-2) are absent from F.46 and indeed all other collections from Apizaco.

Trejo (1997) reports 50 percent Cl figurines for Tzompantepec, and we have one from Feature 46. Nothing from our feature matches the C7 fig ures illustrated by Niederberger (1987), but the facial features of our coffee bean-eye figurines (Figure 3a) resemble those illustrated in her figure 361, a figurine from the junction of the Manantial and Tetelpan levels. They also look like the "high turban slit-eye heads" of the early Santa Maria Phase in Tehuacan (MacNeish et al. 1970:Figure 57). In sum, our work supports the validity of Gar cia Cook and Merino Carrion's Formative ceramic complexes for Tlaxcala, including identification of those as sequential phases. However, we propose redating the phases. If we are right that Tzompan tepec is post-Manantial and correlated with Tetel pan or Bomba/El Arbolillo, then it should not start before 900 B.C. (we propose 900-800 B.C.). Tlatempa correlates with Zacatenco (Niederberger 1976) or LaPastora/Cuautepec (Tolstoy 1978) from 800 to circa 600 B.C. Texoloc correlates with Ticom?n 1 from circa 600 to 400 B.C.

They are easily amenable to our proposed chronology in their 2-sigma ranges. It is worth not</page><page sequence="12">Lesure et al.] CHRONOLOGY, SUBSISTENCE, AND THE FORMATION OF CENTRAL TLAXCALA 485 ing, however, that Garcia Cook (e.g., 1976:Figure 4 n.) mentions the existence of other dates. We have not been able to locate those. Middle Formative Subsistence We collected three sources of evidence to test our "lacustrine hypothesis" and, more generally, to characterize subsistence in the Apizaco area dur ing the first millennium B.C. Geomorphological studies by Borejsza and Frederick evaluated the extent of local lakes during this period. Subsistence remains from Amomoloc and Tetel include animal bone and carbonized plant remains from screened deposits and flotation samples. Faunal remains (analyzed by Wake) and botanical remains (ana lyzed by Popper) span the Tzompantepec through Texoloc phases. The Search for Holocene Lakes Our lacustrine hypothesis was stimulated by Lauer's (1979) claim for the presence of extensive lakes near Apizaco at different times of the Holocene and particularly in the 2000-2500 B.P. interval. Erff a et al. ( 1977:43^6) had mapped Late Pleistocene lake sediments in that area, which made Lauer's claim seem plausible. The lake sediments are shown to cover the Mu?oz Plain at the north west foot of Tetel, the cinder cone where one of the Formative sites excavated by the project is located. The type section of this mapping unit is 3.5 km from the archaeological site, in an exposure created by Barranca Horcasitas. A visit to the type section and exploration along the stream revealed that the units interpreted by Erffa et al. as lacustrine have the hallmarks of fluvial deposits. They are for the most part coarse grained, with little organic matter, often normally graded, and sometimes cross-bedded and contain in-filled paleochannels. They include some fine-grained faci?s, possibly associated with back water areas on the floodplain, but nothing that would substantiate the existence of extensive Late Pleistocene wetlands. Further reconnaissance targeted the other areas of the study region that could potentially have har bored lakes of significant size. There are some iso lated depressions on the Mu?oz Plain that hold water for some time after heavy rains, but they are few and less than 100 m in diameter. The only sub stantial body of water, Laguna de Zacatepec, cov ers 35 ha, and its maximum dry season depth is less than 1 m. Deltaic deposits of a small stream spread over 25 ha on the northeastern edge of the lake. The stream drains a range of eroded hills littered with Postclassic ceramics. Test pits on the opposite shore of the lake revealed colluvium burying a hydro morphic soil. Postclassic sherds appeared at the contact of these two stratigraphie units. We thus posit a larger lake and higher water table in that period and possibly in earlier epochs. Tests pits in the deltaic sands and silts confirmed that they bury mostly autigenic lake mud. The calibrated 2-sigma range of a date on the bulk organic matter of this mud is 1520-1130 B.C., suggesting the existence of a larger lake in Formative times (3100?80B.P, 513C = -16.3%o, Beta-157068). The surface topog raphy of the area, however, makes a lake of more than 60 ha impossible. No traces of the Formative have been reported from the vicinity of Laguna de Zacatepec by pre vious researchers. We conducted surface recon naissance, walked several kilometers of stream courses in the drainage, and excavated five widely separated test pits. We were unable to identify evi dence of human occupation from earlier than the Postclassic, though if there was a settlement on the northeastern side of the lake it would be buried by deltaic deposits. In sum, although there was probably at least one lake in the study region during the second millen nium B.C., the area covered by water was minus cule in comparison to what we originally thought possible based on the work of Lauer (1979) and Erffa et al. (1977). A Lake Zacatepec even twice its current size would not, in our opinion, have been sufficient to support a regionwide transition to sedentism, and, indeed, neither our work nor that of previous researchers has produced any evidence of Formative-era human activities in the vicinity of the lake. Fauna! Remains The 2001 and 2003 excavations yielded a relatively large faunal sample from Tetel (1,380 number of identified specimens [NISP]) and a smaller col lection from Amomoloc (664 NISP). Bone from the 2004 season is still being analyzed. Much of the Tetel sample comes from deposits that were dis turbed or which for other reasons are inappropri ate for the investigation of Middle Formative</page><page sequence="13">486 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 17, No. 4, 2006 subsistence. For that reason we report here on a reduced sample of bones (196 NISP) from Exca vation Area A, which comprised features bearing secondary refuse from the Tlatempa and Texoloc phases. The sample from Amomoloc is more directly usable for the current analysis. It includes the Tzompantepec-phase Feature 46 (235 NISP) and numerous Tlatempa features (413 NISP). Excavation mesh size was .5 cm. Identifications are primarily based on comparative collections housed in the Zooarchaeology Laboratory of the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), the UCLA Department of Biology, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. Table 3 pre sents NISP and minimum number of individuals (MNI), split by site and, at Amomoloc, by phase. MNI determinations are based on counts of the greatest number of paired (left or right) elements or unique skeletal elements represented in a given taxon. Size difference among skeletal elements that might indicate multiple individuals was also con sidered, as was chronological information. Still, our MNI estimates are probably overly conserva tive, particularly for deer and rabbit, the bones of which appeared in small numbers in most trash pits. In the combined samples from the two sites, four vertebrate classes are represented: amphib ians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. No fish were present. The most common and diverse class is mammals. Amphibians and reptiles (Herps) are rare; in five instances indicated in Table 3 numer ous bones of what were probably single individu als were recovered. These likely represent animals that either fell into an open bell-shaped pit or intruded into the archaeological deposits after the pit had been filled. Birds are the least common ver tebrate class. The Tzompantepec-phase sample is broadly comparable to that of the later phases. Although some amphibians and turtles are present in the col lection (mainly from Tetel), the lack of any fish or waterfowl argues against any significant exploita tion of aquatic resources. All amphibians and tur tles identified at Tetel collections could have been supported by the local rivers and seasonal ponds. The bones of deer or unidentified large mammals make up approximately 40 percent of the total NISP but constitute 75 percent of bones bearing evidence of burning. Deer, jackrabbits, and dogs were prob ably the most important animal protein sources at both sites. Botanical Remains Twenty-two flotation samples from Tetel (totaling 981 of sediment) and 20 samples from Amomoloc (totaling 781) were analyzed, along with carbonized maize fragments recovered from the screen or in situ. The Amomoloc samples include 12 from the Tzompantepec-phase Feature 46, totaling 49.5 1. Both the density of the remains and the species rep resented in Feature 46 are similar to patterns observed in the Tlatempa and Texoloc samples. Preservation is low to moderate, with charcoal densities in flotation samples ranging from &lt; .01 to 0.64 g/1. Plant taxa diversity is also low. Identi fications are based on publications and compara tive plant collections in the Paleoethnobotany Laboratory in the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at UCLA. In selected samples, a grab of 20 pieces of wood charcoal, if available, was selected for identification. Specimens were fractured to give a clean transverse section and examined under a binocular microscope at 60x. None of the remains points to exploitation of riparian or lakeshore resources. Maize (Zea mays) cob fragments and kernels predominate (in flota tion samples: 14 embryos, 286 whole and part ker nels, one cob, one cob fragment, 284 cupules). Other cultivated plants include two possible bean fragments and possible squash (Cuc?rbita sp.) rind (n = 5). Nondomesticated species are useful plants that may have been manipulated, transplanted, or protected to provide resources. Chenopodium sp. (quelite, n = 166), Opuntia sp. (prickly pear/nopal, n = 1), Salvia sp. (wild chia, n = 1), and Solanum sp. (nightshade, n = 58) could fall into this cate gory and could have provided edible greens, fruits, and other resources. Carbonized wood, bark, nut shell (some probably from pine), and thorns (including one Agave sp. thorn) were also recov ered. Woods include Pinus sp. (pine), Quercus sp. (oak), conifer (too small or distorted to see resin ducts), monocotyledon (not maize but too distorted to identify), and a dicotyledon with wide rays. Charcoal provides evidence on the local envi ronment. Pine and oak predominate at Tetel, with a relatively even distribution of the two.

Three cob fragments were recovered, with 16,14, and 14 rows. Rachis diameters are 8.6, 8.4, and 7.3 mm, respectively; average cupule depth is 1.7, 1.8, and 1.2 mm; average cupule width is 3.1, 3.1, and 2.9 mm. Formative cobs from the Basin of Mexico are reported with 12 to 16 rows; from F?brica San Jos? in Oaxaca, with 6 to 14 (half with 12); and from Quachilco in Oaxaca, with 10 to 16 (majority with 10 rows [Benz 1994b; Ford 1976; Smith 1979; Smith and Tolstoy 1981]). Numerous kernels were recovered in Feature 4 at Tetel. Cupules were found there and in three pits at Amomoloc (including Feature 46). Measure ments on those are provided in Table 4 along with comparable data (the Feature 4 kernels were sam pled). The correspondence between the Apizaco kernel dimensions and those of El Arbolillo and Santa Catarina (Manantial and Bomba phases) is striking, and it is tempting to suggest that they derive from the same population (though there is greater divergence among the corresponding cupules). Any such comparison must nevertheless be taken with a grain of salt because many of the kernels we measured appear to have "popped" in the fire, and Smith and Tolstoy's (1981) measure ments (to the nearest 0.5 mm) are rather crude. We conclude simply that it is worth exploring the pos sibility that metric comparison of maize remains might help in sorting out human interactions and even population movements during the Early to Middle Formative (see Benz 1994b: 158). Synthesis of Results Excavations at two sites reported to be among the earliest Formative occupations in central Tlaxcala verify ceramic complexes described by Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion (1997b) and support interpre tation of those complexes as sequential phases. Radiocarbon dates and correlations with other regions, however, suggest that the phase boundaries need to be moved forward in time. We propose that the earliest phase, Tzompantepec, postdates 1000 B.C. If there was a ceramic horizon earlier than Tzompantepec in the Apizaco area, we would expect it to be Manantial-like, based on Aufdermauer's finds at Moyotzingo. We have seen no convincing evidence of anything so early in Apizaco. We found no evidence to support a "lacustrine hypothesis" that would see the Apizaco region as a choice area for early sedentism based on abun</page><page sequence="16">Lesure et al.] CHRONOLOGY, SUBSISTENCE, AND THE FORMATION OF CENTRAL TLAXCALA 489 dant wild resources. Although we were unable to locate Late Archaic settlements, our data on For mative subsistence include a sample from what we consider the earliest Formative occupation of the region (Tzompantepec). Inhabitants of Amomoloc and Tetel during the Tzompantepec through Tex oloc phases had a maize-focused diet typical of the semiarid highlands of central Mexico during the first millennium B.C. Villagers ate maize, beans, and squash and exploited wild plants such as quelite, prickly pear, wild chia, and nightshade. Deer were probably the primary source of animal protein, with rabbit and dog also important. These findings would fit comfortably with a relatively late Formative transition in the region. Maize-based farming could be an effective subsistence system in the Apizaco area, but this would not have been a choice location. Given our evidence on timing as well as what appears to be a well-established agricultural diet in the Tzompantepec phase, we suspect that the appearance of the Formative in central Tlaxcala involved not an in situ, independent transforma tion of lifeways by hunting and gathering peoples but, instead, an in-migration of groups of estab lished agriculturalists during the early first mil lennium B.C. A motivating force for the in-filling of places like Apizaco at this time could have been rising population in choice locations leading to group fissioning. A similar process appears to have been under way in the northern Basin of Mexico during the early first millennium (Niederberger 2000:171; Sanders et al. 1979:95-97). Still, our case for migration should be regarded as tentative until we can identify the point of origin of the migrants. The proximity of the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley, where late-second-millennium B.C. set tlement is known (Moyotzingo), makes this the most likely source. During Tlatempa, strong styl istic ties in ceramics and figurines linked central Tlaxcala to the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley (Serra Puche et al. 2004) and the Basin of Mexico. There were cross ties between the same areas in the pre ceding Tzompantepec phase, but they may have been less extensive than in Tlatempa. Still, a post Manantial, pre-Zacatenco horizon is not well worked out in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley, and our own Tzompantepec sample is too small for any definitive pronouncement on the source area of our proposed migrants. Larger Implications Our work contributes to larger understandings of the transition to the Formative in Mesoamerica. Two issues of recent theoretical interest are varia tion in subsistence among early sedentary com munities and the importance of independent transitions to sedentism versus a spread of agri culture through population expansion and migra tion. Our results support long-standing understandings of the central highlands, in relation to which the settlement history of Tlaxcala has seemed anomalous. Formative subsistence patterns in Apizaco contribute to a picture of considerable uniformity in subsistence across the central high lands in the first millennium B .C. They are also con sistent with a balance between the models of independent transitions and population radiations from core areas of development. A limited number of independent Formative transitions centered on choice areas across Mesoamerica could have gen erated demographic ripple effects on a regional level. A comparatively late Formative transition in Apizaco helps clarify the spatial and temporal scales of the latter process in central Mexico. We posit an independent transition to Formative life ways during the early to mid-second millennium B.C. in the southern Basin of Mexico, southern Puebla, and Morelos. Over the following seven centuries or so, populations in this area grew rapidly, and groups of fully agricultural migrants moved northward into more marginal areas of the northern basin and the uplands surrounding the northern Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley. In this sense, the Formative transition in Apizaco was not an inde pendent development. Instead, it was historically linked to events that took place to the south several centuries earlier.
