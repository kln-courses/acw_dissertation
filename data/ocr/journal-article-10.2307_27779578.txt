She reviews poetry for Booklist and other publications. This essay is taken from a booklength study, Gerald Stern: Making the Light Come, to be published in Fall 1989 by Wayne State University Press. The poetry of Gerald Stern is defined and governed by its flamboyant speaker, a stagey hero whose life story is the poet's, but enlarged and mythicized. This eloquent spokesman holds the line between the unconditional authority of narration and the contingency of character; in these we recognize the two positions we constantly hold as speakers and actors. He is onstage throughout the entire canon and constantly de mands our attention. He does not react passively to events; he wrestles with them and shapes, even invents, the world he moves in. He trans forms himself endlessly, playing whatever parts appeal to him, yet his identity never changes: whether he takes the mask of a friendly gar dener, a wandering hero, a rabbinical figure, a fallen angel, a god?even a tree or bird?he is still the same whimsical guy, a fantastic prophet and favorite uncle who, though full of wisdom, permits himself all manner of weakness, readily admits to his own foolishness, indulges in spates of sentiment, suffers endlessly, and overcomes suffering through imagina tion. In the gap between his vast proportions and his foolishness we recognize the human condition; in his capacity for transformation he becomes a metaphor for imagination. This first person narrator can of course be taken for the poet himself. But I prefer to see him as an actor, playing a part like that of a character in fiction who is said to "represent" the author. The distinction is subtle, but crucial. This view encourages us to notice the performative nature of Stern's poems. By focusing on the roles encapsulated in the protean speaker, we gain a framework in which to examine the complexities of the canon. This view also helps us to probe the distinction between the speaker and Stern himself. Stern's leading character does seem to create an impression somewhat different from that of the typical lyric speaker. We are likely to think of the lyric speaker as sheer voice, as statement devised through certain strategies, in traditional or open form, in tone serious or ironic, in lan guage plain or ornate. Identification tends to be scenic rather than dra matic. We seldom picture the lyric speaker or identify with him as a dramatic character, a "someone" who seems to be physically present and even seems to have an existence beyond the work, as do some fic tional characters. When we think of Huckleberry Finn or Gatsby or the Consul in Under the Volcano, for instance, we imagine a person who seems to have a material existence. Such a character dominates the work he's in to such an extent that his entire world seems a function of himself. The meaning of the work is his meaning and cannot be separated from him; in this sense he is meaning itself. It is something of this quality, which combines independence, control, and irreducible meaning, that the Stern speaker conveys. There are a number of other poets' narrators who share a similar kind of character status or, to put it another way, encourage the reader to invent a "living" character. The reader of Frost, for instance, may do so. But the country philosopher we imagine in Frost is a type, not an individ- ! ual, a function of the kinds of experience recounted rather than the idiosyncrasies of a unique personality. In some cases, a character emerges in a single poem or poem cycle, but does not persist through the whole canon, as does the Stern speaker. A good example is Alfred J. Prufrock. The Henry of Berryman'sDream Songs is another; like Stern's narrator, he's a shape-shifter, but I'm not convinced that readers can picture him. Both Prufrock and Henry contrast with the Stern narrator in that they are anti-heroic characters controlled by circumstance. The strongest comparison is between Stern's work and Leaves of Grass; the Whitman persona is an imperative figure, magnified, heroized, and mythicized, as is Stern's spokesman. Both are flashy exhibitionists. But Whitman's character is played straight, while Stern's is not. The Stern speaker is comic as well as grand; his heroics are undermined by irreverance, ironies and jestful self-mockery. The dramatic significance of Stern's speaker is in part a function of sheer presence: his high visibility through the whole course of the work gives the canon a novelistic consistency. Beyond this, significance coheres in the character himself, in a blend of elements that add up to a strong sense of dasein and agency. For one thing, he is odd, quirky, conspicuous. He presents a striking combination of opposites: he is wild yet homey, heroic but clumsy, extreme yet down to earth, intimate yet distant. His lyricism is so overextended that it doubles back on itself, becoming unlyrical. His verbal audacity is surprising, especially when compared with the safe, dull humming that characterizes so much of today's poetry. Our most audacious and startling work is that of the lan guage poets who, inspired by structuralist theory, surprise by trying to deny their own presence in the poem and indeed to deny the purpose of language itself, which is not just to say but to say something. Stern's surprise rests on the opposite assertion, a cocky, half-kidding, rowdy display of idiosyncrasy and a conviction that there is still something to be said about the oldest subjects. Not since Stevens has there been a voice so quirky and original yet large and universal. Stevens, too, used his peculiar voice to reinvigorate classic themes. Surprise for its own sake is of questionable merit. But the Stern speaker doesn't seem to be straining for effect; he appears really to be that way. At least, he does for many readers; to accept Stern on his own terms, the reader must be willing to identify with this character as an authentic voice. If he does not, he may prefer those poems where the speaker is least himself. Louis Simpson exemplifies this kind of reading. In a review of Lovesick, he faults the poet for oversentimentality and strained emotion, which becomes "a performance." In short poems, he says, Stern "can be very likable" (158-59).1 However, the longer poem is Stern's metier, precisely because it provides breathing space for the extremity of his speaker. The extremity and individuality of the speaker actually enhance his authenticity: we tend to believe that he's sincere because he is so recog nizable and distinctive. We are also convinced by his vigor, another quality that is unusual today, among so many slack, attenuated voices. His strength and authenticity rely on one another and are induced by a combination of frank emotion, sincere yet idiosyncratic speech, mixed tone, intimate voice, hyperactive syntax, and largesse. All these are qualities not of a statement alone but of a person, a character we accept as honest because of his oddity, his boldness, his warmth, his admitted weakness, and his robust confidence. We accept him also because he answers a need for strength and authenticity and brings it in a form we can accept; he is not the severe, commanding patriarch but the good father or comforting uncle. The distinction between this invention and the poet himself is a sim plistic and literal one: the speaker is not Gerald Stern because the poet does not do, in real life, what the speaker does, and the things that hap pen to the speaker don't literally happen to Stern. The life events from which the poems spring are transformed in a manner much more extreme than the usual change when a poet's life becomes a semantic entity. The real Gerald Stern goes down to the store to get a loaf of bread; the speaker embarks on a fabular quest that leaves the loaf of bread behind, that overwhelms, buries, or destroys mundane reality. Another poet would invest the actual trip to the grocery with signifi cance. Stern's poem rarely insists that Gerald Stern's wanderings on the city streets, his well-known restaurant stops, his backyard gardening or his travels abroad have, in themselves, universal significance. Actual events in the poet's life often become mere vestiges in the enlarged experience of the poem. The distinction between the autobiographical Stern and his spokesman is more extreme in some poems than in others. In his major work, he escapes the limitations of biography through self mythicization: he invents an ultraself that shares his biography but is able to enact a range of mythic roles. In fact, his entire poetic realm is enveloped by the speaker. The people?even the plants and animals have the stamp of his personality, which is that of Gerald Stern, but magnified: the corpus is an anthropomorphic universe full of this multi plied presence. The ultraself is at once self-magnifying and self-effacing, egocentric yet possessed of a certain humility that says, "It is not my particular circumstances that warrant attention; I am not a hero in my self but as a representative of human nobility." The hazard is the risk of hybris, acknowledged and countered in Stern's self-deflating foolishness and clumsiness. In the most literal and obvious sense, it is not the poet who constantly changes form, but his creature: Gerald Stern does not become a tree, a squirrel or a god. Transformation permits the poet to experience himself as if he were another. It allows him to look at things from a range of extreme perspectives. He is able to explore possibilities not of the self alone but of the human. And it provides the opportunity to put himself at risk imaginatively. Transformation is perilous; it always implies the fear of disappearing. But the Stern speaker absorbs the threatening aspects of transformation with gallant confidence. He depicts his po tential for regeneration and fruition by describing himself as "a flower ing figure" (PP 61).2 His capacity for transformation is the crux of Stern, the machinery of the poem and also its goal. The oddity and authority of this spokesman derive in part from Stern's early isolation, his late development as a poet and his lack of quick success. Born in 1925, he grew up in what he has called "inhos NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 1988 PAGE 11</page><page sequence="2">pi table and merciless Pittsburgh/' registered at the University of Pitts burgh almost by accident, was not even an English major: The idea of going to a school and studying under a poet never occurred to me. I didn't know yet who the poets were, and later, when I did, I had no idea where they worked?or that they did work. ... I lived and studied without direction, and if anything was going to he a permanent influence on me it was that. ("Some Secrets" 258-60)3 * Through his private study, Stern "pieced together the story of modern poetry." But he did not attach himself to a dominant precursor. He says he did not have "one great influence, one master, but a number, even an endless number. ..." Among them were Yeats and Auden in the mid forties, Pound and early Eliot by the late forties, MacLeish, Cummings, Crane, Auden, Marlowe, Thomas and Dickinson in the early fifties. By the mid-fifties, he was "most involved with Wallace Stevens." Lowell was "useful," but early Roethke was more so, because of "the mystery, the strangeness, the loss, the love of small animals and plants, the sense of justice." Wilhams was important for the way he combined "health and madness, domesticity and wildness" ("Some Secrets" 256-62; Glaser 10).4 In Emerson, Stern found a source for the poet's role in "the very making of the American vision," though he obviously disputes Emerson's rejection of tradition ("What Is This Poet?" 153).5 He has also identified any number of more distant sources; for instance, in a lengthy poetic tribute he takes Ovid's "books of sorrow" as a model (PP21). Stern is irritated by the tendency of reviewers to link him with Whit man. He says he's "a Whitmanian who doesn't like to be called a Whit manian." He recognizes his "obsession against the very idea of having someone as a teacher or guide." Though he admits to similarities in style and finds much to admire in "Song of Myself," he dislikes Whitman's "pat optimism," "chest-thumping," "shrill voice," and?most of all? his "preaching" (Glaser 11; "Some Secrets" 265; "What Is This Poet" 153). Needless to say, Harold Bloom would call this denial of Whitman a repression of the precursor. Perhaps Peter Stitt does go too far when he calls Stern "almost a spiritual reincarnation of Whitman" (188),6 but there are strong ties in attitude as well as manner. However, this influence is mixed with others, in particular with that of Stevens. The odd conjunction of Stevensian gaudiness and intricacy with Whit manian openness and emotionality is one of the sources of Stern's tensile strength. Stern does not see himself as "accountable," except in very obvious ways, to apparent influences. He is less inclined to identify literary antecedents than aspects of his "personal, accidental history," such as Judaism, the depression, the political Left, the crucial childhood loss of his sister?even being lefthanded. Ultimately, he believes his own loss and failure became his subject ("Some Secrets" 256-57, 263). Ina sense, his failed self became the master he had to vanquish. He says he knows nothing about "the psychology of masterhood." It may have been "a certain shyness and a certain secrecy, coupled with a kind of arrogance" that made him "unwilling to submit," to become a protege like Lowell of T?te or "Allen Ginsberg on W.C.W.'s side porch, or Pound in the Provencal room or Whitman in the Emerson room. ..." He did make one attempt to connect with the poetry establishment. He showed an early, epic poem called "Ishmael's Dream" to Auden, and was ignored ("Some Secrets" 256-58, 261). "In Memory of W.H. Auden" (PP 9) re-imagines this crucial rejection without explaining what hap pened: . . . it was cold and brutal outside on Fourth Street as I walked back to the Seventh Avenue subway, knowing, as I reached the crowded stairway, that I would have to wait for ten more years or maybe twenty more years for the first riches to come my way, and knowing that the stick of that old Prospero would never rest on my poor head, dear as he was with his robes and his books of magic, good and wise as he was in his wrinkled suit and his battered slippers. The poem is a coming-to-terms wherein the poet pictures himself "waving goodbye" to "that magician/who could release me now, whom I release and remember." In another poem, Stern describes what it was like to be an outsider, to hope he wouldn't always be "out there" with only his odd thoughts and his own speech, his "lips alone," to guide him: hoping I don't have to spend the rest of my life out there staring through the trees, hoping that my odd mind will keep me going if nothing else does and hoping my lips alone can carry me from place to place and tremble when they have to, and sing when they have to, without help, or interference. (LL 30) He came to see himself as "staking out a place that no one else wanted because it was abandoned or overlooked" ("Some Secrets" 264). Clearly he was aware that he was writing against the grain.

PAGE 12 THE AMERICAN POETRY REVIEW</page><page sequence="3">be self-originating, while it stems in part from failure, can be seen as a signal of the strong poet. The only overarching background for his work, both in terms of style and in a much broader sense, is Biblical literature, in particular the Kab balistic and Hassidic reinterpretations of the Talmud and the Mid rashim. He puts these to his own uses ("Some Secrets" 257). In fact, the major roles played by his speaker are appropriations of Biblical figures and concepts. Implicit in his thought, for instance, is a usurped or recon stituted concept of Jesus that replaces the typical, Christian image. Thus the Bible?and more importantly the commentaries that readjust and even reverse Biblical material?can be taken as his precursor. In 1958, Stern began work on a book-length poem called "The Pineys," which was published in 1969 in The Journal of the Rutgers University Library.1 A treatise on the people of a Southern New Jersey wilderness known as the Pine Barrens, the poem illustrates the experimentation that preceded Stern's realized style.8 Some parts are written in rather strict iambic pentameter, with formal diction; at its worst, it sounds clogged and pretentious: . . . in the one place hylic, in the next A limp platonic; stony luminous; heartless; Each a plighting, a plashing, on the ripe occasion, A raging, of those that rage, and less of it those That rage less, all with their own inculpable quavers . . . ("Pineys" 58) Two sections play on the relationship between metaphors and algebraic formulas, or poetry and logic; they bristle with lines like "And x pre vailed only, and always, as z, ... Or the state without x since x and z are the same. ..." Another part consists of a list of 298 numbered items defining "what the starved and beaten Pineys were symbols of. . ." ("Pineys" 66-71). The segment dealing with the actual history of the Pineys (Part Two) is spoken in a voice closer to the one we know in later Stern. There are hints of this voice throughout the melange of the poem; it also contains many of Stern's themes and displays the tragi-comic flavor that will later be invested in his speaker. After completing "The Pineys," Stern underwent a crise de quarante: "I realized the poem was a failure. ... I had been a practicing poet for almost two decades and I had nothing to show. ... I had reached the bottom." His failure became a liberation: "I was able to let go and finally become myself and lose my shame and my pride." His work changed suddenly, "as if I had been preparing for this all my life . . . and now I was ready" ("Some Secrets" 262-64). He abandoned formal rhythms and high-flown diction. He relinquished spatiotemporal coherence. He gave up adherence to a comprehensible literal situation in the poem. He began to rely on an idiosyncratic speaker, a voice and personage that would be himself-in-art. A new Stern poem emerges in Rejoicings, published in 1973. The book got little notice, but it contains several important poems and announces virtually all of Stern's themes and motifs as well as key words and images. His stubborn refusal to follow the rules is also in evidence: un suppressed emotion, sentimentality, classical allusion, the flaunting of abstractions, the unpopular happy outlook suggested somewhat falla ciously by his titles?all these go against the dogma of poetry writing that has been dominant for decades in the classroom and beyond. Yet he has clung persistently, in the decade-and-a-half since Rejoicings, to his aberrations. If he gets by with all this, it is not because the complex ambivalences of his work have been taken into account. The credit goes to his speaker, who is already clearly defined in Rejoicings, though he is not so consistently at ease as he will be later and sometimes veers off into silliness. The few poems from which he is absent, such as "Goodbye Morbid Bear," 4'No Succour!" and "The Heat Rises in Gusts," demon strate how crucial he is to Stern's originality. In the weakest of these, "Two American Haikus," drops of rain fall "like heads/dropping into the waste basket" (R 60). Without the mediation of the speaker, this surreal image seems lifted from a film by Jean Cocteau or Maya Deren. It was not until Lucky Life, which won the Lamont Poetry Prize for 1977, that Stern began to succeed: he was fifty-two years old. He later came to value the years of alienation, to believe, as he says in a poem from The Red Coal, that "nothing was wasted, that the freezing nights/ were not a waste, that the long dull walks and/the boredom, and the secret pity, were/not a waste" (RC 71). He believes that his poetry resulted from his isolation: "I went where I did go because I didn't have a guide and I became what I am for that reason . . . ("Some Secrets" 265). By Lucky Life, most of the fumblings and inconsistencies visible in Rejoicings have gone. Stern is already, with his first widely received book, in the mature period of his work; the radical shifts we often observe in the early part of a poet's career have passed without notice. The eccen tricity and strength that grow in isolation are portrayed through the speaker, who can almost be called a stand-in for the master Stern lacked, an Adamic offshot of his own will made to rule in his invented realm. When the Stern speaker first appeared in Rejoicings, the poetry schools of the fifties, reactions against academicized modernism, were a decade old. Ginsberg, born only a year after Stern, had long since chal lenged the academy. Stern remembers his reaction to "beat vs. feet" as ambiguous: he cursed the academics, "with their wit and elegance and politeness and forms," yet he could not accept the anti-intellectual 1 MFA Writing Program at Vermont College Intensive 12-Day residencies July and January on the Vermont campus.

His speaker is, on one level, an attempt to reconcile the ex tremes of intellect and emotion, mind and body. His reverence for learn edness is a strong presence throughout the corpus, but his respect for the physical/emotional is just as serious, as he says in a poem where the squirrel represents body and feeling: / need a squirrel, his clawed feet spread, his whole soul quivering, the hot wind rushing through his hair, the loud noise shaking him from head to tail O philosophical mind, O mind of paper, I need a squirrel finishing his wild dash across the highway, rushing up his green ungovemed hillside. (RC 23) Throughout his career, Stern has never participated in the shared aesthetic of any cluster of poets; he cannot be placed in any school or group. But he does share common ground with various modes, and I hope to clarify his position through comparison. Needless to say, such comparisons are inherently sketchy and generic; they overlook the extreme differences between poets in any group, not to mention the dif ferences within the canon of a single poet. My purpose is only to propose some similarities and distinctions between Stern and certain modes; hopefully, this brief discussion will set the stage for closer comparisons. Stern has something in common with both sides of a broad yet signifi cant dichotomy in postmodern poetry between the sincere and the ironic. In the first case, he has similar goals but a different style; in the second, his style is similar but his goals are quite distinct. The sincere poem, or the "scenic style" as Altieri calls it, blurs into the "deep image poem" and is seen in major poets as different as Kunitz, Merwin, Stafford and Bly. It is often said to be the dominant mode of recent decades. The sincere poem presents a resolutely quotidian world invested in some cases with surreal and archetypal significance. It is serious, direct and unaffected, quietly emotional, often passive. Paul Hoover labels it "moral poetry." Its chief ingredients, he says, are ecstasy and grief, its role prophetic (14).9 At its best, it achieves a severe clairvoyance. At its worst, it takes itself too seriously. Stern shares the ecstatic and grieving postures of this mode and its impulse toward prophecy, but in an opposite style. His speaker is much too flamboyant and comic a fellow?and too much a trickster?to appear in the sincere poem. And the adventures of this speaker are anything but quotidian. They range out into history: / am in a certain century again going from city to city. I am in a window with Berlioz on my left and Czerny on my right; Liszt is looking into the clouds, his wrists seem to be waiting. (L 10) His adventures also become mythic, enlarged by ancestral memory: "Always I am in the middle of everything./My voice is in the woods;/my hands are in the water;/my face is in the clouds, like a hot sun" (RC 7). The ironic poem has aristocratic roots; it is seen in the New York School and epitomized by Ashbery. We think of it as witty, subtle and cool. Stern's ardent humanism seems quite at odds with its brittle, dis connected posture, though his respect for high culture and intellect can be called aristocratic. Stylistically, Stern has much in common with Ash bery: a whimsical air, playfulness, elision, a combination of abstractness and conversational directness, accessible moments dissolved in con voluted syntax, rejection of logic, invention of an alternative realm. Stern is more emotional, Ashbery more detached. The surface similari ties between these poets tend to go unnoticed because they are so different at heart. Ashbery's stance toward meaning is definitively ironic in its rejection of wholeness, but Stern's is not. Stern's irony is occasional, soft, often hidden and ambivalent: the Stern speaker is wildly sincere; at the same time, he smiles at the irony of his own seriousness, recognizing the finitude of his experience. Stern has remarked on his attitude toward irony versus seriousness: . . . though I love irony and playfulness and roles and symbolic behavior and indirect action and irony itself (and lying and concealing and masquerie and buffoonerie)?at bottom I believe my life and the life of the universe is deeply serious, even unforgettable. ("Life Is Not a River" 9)10 Overriding irony doesn't suit Stern, because it denies the reconciliation of real and ideal that is one of his goals. Occasional, playful irony, how ever, is a way out of the impasse that irony creates; it is a way of being ironic and naive at almost the same time. It avoids both the self-absorp tion of romantic irony, which aims to distance and reverse alienation, and the pretensions of hand-over-heart seriousness. Stern is most often associated with the accumulative or discursive poem that comes out of Whitman, through Ginsberg, and, in modified form, into poets like Pinsky or Dorn. His long, profuse lines, parallel structures, and digressive strategies identify him with this full kind of poem. The main difference here is a subtle distinction in subject and pur pose. These poets are ordinarily thought of as representatives of Ameri can society or prophets of American experience. Stern can certainly be read in this vein, and reviewers often do so. However, he places Ameri can issues in distant and mythic contexts. He is concerned with explica hS 41 INFORMATION William Logan Director of Creative Writing Department of English University of Florida Gainesville, Florida 32611 (904-392-0777) POETRY DONALD JUSTICE Winner of the Pulitzer Prize.

In this he resembles the version of sincere poetry called deep image; what is the deep image if not an archetype? But he encounters the archetype as drama, not image; his impulse is verbal, not adjectival. He has noted his attraction to the deep image, which he says is central to all poetry, but not to the bare, minimal work that we think of in connection with deep image poets: "I want the poem to have resonance in several places at once. ... I want it to be arduous, yet simple. ... I don't want to say the 'gray gray' and let it go at that. I want to live in a number of worlds" (Hillringhouse 30).11 He accomplishes this multiform poem through his speaker, whose dramatized sensibility pulls in and unifies diverse elements. Stern has a tangential relationship with the kind of poem we call con fessional, a kind hard to discuss because it is not a style but an impulse that appears widely. Obviously, the confessional tendency of Lowell assumes a vastly different form from that of Berryman, Plath or Bishop. Yet they all share an unprecedented overt expression of obsessive self fascination. Historically, we can point to a reaction against modernist impersonality, a renewed, radicalized and inward-facing romanticism wherein self-expression and emotionality focus not on the response of self to world but on the psychology of self. In the most general terms, we can speak of a poetry in which self-expression becomes self-exposure. We might go so far as to call the confessional poem an endgame of the self as subject. Stern questions the prevailing emphasis on the self in poetry as a whole; he posits a time when "perhaps the pain in the life of the poet will stop being the main subject. . ." ("Notes from the River" 19).12 Yet he sees the stress on self as an inevitable consequence of the fact that "we don't have a common history in this country, a common culture." It reflects "the fact that we're all separate from each other" (Glaser 27). There's a surface resemblance between Stern's work and the confes sional stance that turns out to be false. The Stern speaker displays him self flagrantly, almost shamelessly. We feel that we know not only his personality but his character; yet, like a person we see often around town, we know him from the outside in?not from the inside out. This i? the opposite of our response to the psychological emphasis that typifies the confessional poem. At one point Stern offers a half-mocking confes sion that may be taken partly as a joke on confessional poets and partly as a joke on himself: I ate my sandwich and waited for a signal, then I began my own confession; I walked on the stones, I sighed under a hemlock, I whistled under a pine, and reached my own house almost out of breath from walking too fast?from talking too loud? from waving my arms and beating my palms; I was, for five or ten minutes, one of those madmen you see forcing their way down Broadway, reasoning with themselves the way a squirrel does. . . . (L23) If there is a poet among the diverse group of confessionals with whom Stern has an affinity, it is Berryman. Both use a strained syntax, though Berryman's is jumpy while Stern's is evasive, so smooth and flowing that its transmutations tend to go unnoticed. More central is the rela tionship between Stern's multiplied speaker and Berryman's Henry, "a human American man" with many names who enacts a multiplicity of "sad wild riffs." Both are suffering yet comic. But Henry's world is diminished, etiolated, finally unredeemable; he sums it up when he says, "All human pleas/are headed for the night." The concept of the confessional poem is undermined by the fact that the word itself is a misnomer. The word confession implies admission of guilt and need for forgiveness. The confessional poem, on the other hand, has strong roots in Freudian blame: "Look what they've done to me." Stern's poem is closer to the word confess than the misnamed confes sional poem, because he makes a habit of pleading for forgiveness. He does so, often comically, throughout the corpus: "Please forgive me, my old friends" (R 40); "Forgive me ten times, but this is what I did" (LL 87); "... dreaming of my weaknesses/and praying to the ducks for forgive ness" (RC 64); "forgive me/for turning into a tree, forgive me, you lovers/of life for leaving you suddenly" (PP 61); "I sit in the sun forgiv ing myself" (L 52); "I have to be forgiven" (L 74). These entreaties sound like lighthearted, formal courtesies, yet they surely point to the unrea sonable childhood guilt Stern felt at his sister's early death. If we want to take guilt as a psychological motive in the confessional poem, we can propose a similar possibility in Stern, though not as a crucial element. A major distinction between Stern and the confessionals is one of tone. For one thing, the rage that typifies some of thesepoets, notably Plath and Bishop, is missing from his work. So is the overriding negativity, not just an acknowledgement of suffering but an embrace of it, a sometimes potent one: If Lowell can say, at one point, "I myself am hell," Stern is more likely to see his projected self as the potential for paradise. Suf fering is a central concept in Stern; however, it is the transformative suffering of the hero. And, like other "high" aspects of Stern's work, it is leavened by comedy. Stern's acknowledged self-pity does seem to find an echo in confes BLACK WARRIOR RE VIE W 15 th Anniversary Fiction by Rand Bishop John Kenny Crane Tom Crawford James P. Girard Jean R.

Confessional poets, though they sometimes seem absorbed by self pity, don't state it directly. Stern, on the other hand, kids openly about it, acknowledging human weakness. At one point, the speaker is looking for his kidney along the road: / want to see it weeping with pure self-pity, wringing its hands the way a kidney wrings its hands, much better than the liver, much better than the heart. . . . (PP 70) In the largest sense, his self-pity is part of the encompassing tragic pity central in his work. Stern shares the intense emotionality of the typical confessional poem, but not its frank disclosure. In Stern, sources of effusive feeling are often eclipsed. Crucial personal material is visible here and there: his early failure, the central incident of his sister's death, his relationship with his father. But the poem is never imprisoned by its fact. He never writes a poem about these subjects; references to them are immersed in historic, mythic or fantastic encounters. Often, only an embedded nugget of the literal situation which instigated a poem is left in, as if one were to recall a passionate sexual interlude, for instance, or a scene of anguish, but write down only one or two details of the scene. At one point, he denies such hidden meaning: here is my yellow tablet, there are no magic thumb prints, nothing that is not there, only the hum, and I have buried that on the piece of paper. (L40) A few lines later, he almost takes back this denial when he says his words are made to be hidden away in a hip pocket or wallet, "and there are broken words,/or torn, hanging onto the threads, the deep ones/under neath the flap, the dark ones forever creased" (L 41). These "dark ones" may be remnants of private material; they also point to Stern's interest in mystical Judaism and in what he calls "the secret text" ("What Is This Poet?" 153). References to secrets appear throughout Stern. This stealthiness plays against the overt, passionate outbursts that mark the canon. The opposition between concealment and disclosure, inside and outside, subconscious and conscious, is one of many dualisms in Stern. Secrecy is at odds with the whole religio-Freudian workings of confes sion, which requires laying bare of the most intimate problems?prob lems which may seem trivial or infantile when seen in the shadow of the killing grounds. It is also at odds with the postmodern preference for openness. A secretive poem is inaccessible and therefore undemocratic. Concealed meaning does have value, though: it creates a substratum that puts pressure on the poem's compressed surface; the surface is intensified beyond its apparent meaning, as ordinary events are intensi fied by hidden meanings in dreams. Secrecy encourages the old-fashioned, formalist approach to reading, which may be called the quest reading: initial impenetrability or con fusion, an engagement like wrestling with an angel, and final illumina tion. This reading style is out of favor, because it traditionally looked for a single meaning supported by every aspect of the text. Stern's canon does not answer this demand for consistency. There are even irreducibles in the text whose presence must be accepted on its own terms, or on faith. But the quest reading can be used to open multiple possibilities. Formalism is out of favor also because it seems to value the poem's surface only for what it conceals. But in fact the process itself, like any quest, is valuable. In Stern's case, the poem has an equally strong tendency to pull the reader in the other direction, away from interpreta tion, to keep her poised on the poem's gaudy surface. Though we don't see a lot of private material in Stern, we are con stantly looking at the speaker as he moves about on the stage of the poem and listening to his distinctive descriptions of his own actions. The speaker often says / am here or here I am again, insisting in present tense that we acknowledge the physicality of his presence. And as scene setter, he often begins a poem with this is, asserting the actuality of the setting as well. His continual self-description creates the effect of dra matic presence. It works to establish the kind of sympathy or identifica tion we give to a fictional character, not, on the surface at least, the kind demanded by confessional. Yet it cannot be denied that Stern's early need for recognition survives under the surface; the speaker says, in effect, here I am, please accept me. He wants to be seen; detailed descrip tions of his movements and gestures as well as what he sees?or will see or might see?from his exact perspective serve to make him visible: In my left hand is a bottle of Tango. In my right hand are the old weeds and power lines. (R23) / can relax in the broken glass and the old pile of chair legs. (R 32) / am so exhausted I can barely lift my arms over my head to pull the vines down.

(L 70) As seen in these typical selections, gestural notations are present as early as Rejoicings, But they become more profuse and unusual later. They are never superficial. Themes and ideas are bound up in the very gestures of the speaker, as they are in the theater. For instance, the major theme of waste and ruin is embodied in the first two quotations above. These gestures seem irreducible; they insist on a collaboration between signifier and signified, a reunion of word and world. Struc turalist thinking sometimes calls such union a romantic delusion, and so it is; it's the kind of belief we used to innocently hold about art. It is experienced and, therefore, though it can be dismissed in meta discourse, it is true on its own level. It is in this sense that Stern's odd ball character with his funny, often ritualized behavior is not just a speaker of meaning but meaning itself. The confessional poem, in its self-absorbed focus on one life, tends to differentiate that life, to set it off from others, in spite of the fact that it may stand as an example. In Stern, on the other hand, the poet's experience is not the main subject of the work. Stern's invented self is, in spite of its oddness, a representative figure: the poet or the man. In Stern, it is not, finally, "look how I have suffered" but "look how we suffer." The underlying impulse is the longing to connect, to make one self part of the whole?a need fostered in Stern by alienation. This move ment toward union is an ancient function of literature, often lost in con temporary writing that is centered in the effort to separate, to dis tinguish between rather than unite. The intimacy of confessional poetry led inevitably to a reaction against self-portrayal seen in the so-called persona poem, a recent mode where the subject?at least ostensibly?is an historical figure. In another, re lated reaction, private life is still the subject, but the poet disavows the /, distancing himself as a he, a she or even a you. Stern's relationship to these kinds of poems is complicated. In his predominant first-person poems, the speaker often creates an impression like that of poems where the self is pushed into third person. The speaker makes himself an object of scrutiny: "I will look at my greenish eyes in the mirror/and touch my graying hair and twist my hat" (LL 35); "I study my red hand under the faucet, the left one" (RC 68). Stern's preoccupation with hands stems from his being left-handed, which labeled him early on as an alien, and also from Biblical influence. Continual reference to right and left hands manifests the text's bipolar or dualistic nature. The two hands also have to do with two kinds of ges turing and two selves: the right is potent and magisterial, the left has im plications of imperfection and insincerity. In the mirror, the speaker becomes whole, "a mirror right-hander,/not a crazy twisted left-handed cripple,/trying to live in this world . . ." (L 52). In this sense, the speaker is a reflected self, perfected in the mirror of the work. "I stare at myself," he says: "the trick is finally to do it/without a mirror" (L 80). The closest Stern comes to the persona poem is "Father Guzman," a book-length dramatic piece which appeared in Paris Review but has not been collected.13 Here he gives up first person, focuses on fictional char acters, and even sacrifices the evasions of narration. The priest Guzman and Boy, his ephebe, are self-projections who both sound much like Stern's first-person speaker, but they are onstage without the convolu tions of tense and syntax that mystify his usual appearance. Stern often writes poems that are ostensibly about or addressed to historic figures, especially in The Red Coal and Paradise Poems: "Magritte Dancing" (RC 26-27), "Thinking about Shelley" (RC 34-35), The National Poetry Series ELEVENTH ANNUAL OPEN COMPETITION The National Poetry Series was established in 1978 to recognize and promote excellence in contemporary American poetry by subsidizing the publication of five manuscripts each year.

But these are nominal or partial subjects, or taking-off points; the poems are really about the speaker's thoughts, and he often says so: "My mind is on Hobbes" (L 55); "I started . . . thinking about Shelley" (RC 34). When he praises Villa Lobos or imagines Spinoza "saying something perfect and sweet and exact/as always" (PP 64), it sounds as if he's really talking about himself but wants to avoid self-aggrandizement. These can't really be called persona poems, since the speaker doesn't stay out of them. In fact, he often gets right into the imagined scene. "Bela" (L 12-14), for instance, starts off as a "version" of Bartok composing his last con certo on his deathbed. In a typical Sternian double-scene, the speaker is also playing a record of the music. A rehearsal is pictured?or rather, the speaker recalls a photograph of a rehearsal?and he begins to partici pate: "I lift/my own right hand, naturally I do that;/I listen to my blood, I touch my wrist." By the end of the poem, the speaker has forced his way into a sentence with Bart?k's wife: ". . . she waits in agony,/she goes to the telephone; I turn to the window,/I stare at my palm, I draw a heart in the dust,/I put the arrow through it, I place the letters/one inside the other." The / asserts his authority as controlling consciousness and maker of the poem, the one who "places the letters." He also asserts his right to make sentimental gestures. In other poems, Stern merges with the subject figure in complex, nested scenarios. In "The Same Moon Above Us" (PP 19-22), the speaker sees a vagrant "sleeping over the grilles" and thinks "he must be Ovid dreaming/again of Rome." The I goes on to describe the thoughts of he, an Ovid metamorphosed on Prince Street "at the long bar/across the street from New York Kitchen." The bum becomes Ovid, Ovid becomes Stern, Stern assumes the role of the representative poet, all are distanced by the voice of the speaker, who is also Stern. In this typical pattern, it seems that the speaker absorbs various roles, rather than to change into them; all remain simultaneously present. At the end of the poem, the speaker leaves Ovid and finds himself "in the middle of nowhere," as Stern was in his early career, with no audience for his virtuoso performance: "no one to see/his gorgeous retrieval, no one to shake the air/with loud applause and no one to turn and bow to. . . ." Another Sternian strategy that bears some resemblance to use of persona is his identification with a plant or animal. Sometimes he takes the form of a bird: "I am just that one pigeon/limping over towards that one sycamore tree/with my left leg swollen and my left claw bent" (L 31); "I move thoughtfully from branch to branch,/... I think of my own legs as breaking off/or my wings coming loose in the wind/or my blossoms dropping onto the ground" (LL 21). Here he drops the bird to become the tree in bloom. The speaker usually winds into and out of these masks briefly and with such a display of legerdemain that he's hard to catch. In one atypical poem, the narrator throughout is a dead dog who waits for the "lover of dead things" to "come back/with his pencil sharpened and his piece of white paper" (L 34-35). He's waiting for Stern?that is, for the Stern speaker, who is seen in many poems with a stub of pencil and who often professes his love for dead things. The dog observes him: "his mouth is open and his glasses are slipping." The ironic relationship between the dog and this "great loving stranger" is like the one between an unfortu nate and a tyrant?or between man and god. The dog hopes he won't be kicked aside; he cries for pity. He has traded his "wildness"; he waits for "the cookie," snaps his teeth "as you have taught me, oh distant and brilliant and lonely." Like all Stern's characters, the dog sounds like his \ master; he isn't a foil for the speaker but an extension of him. The poem isn't about the dog, it's about the man?or Man. Stern's use of persona is more like that of the high moderns than that of the recent persona poem. A similar pantheon of shifting and merging personae is definitive in Joyce, Eliot, Stevens and others. The conven tional notion is that it stems from loss of identity and reflects the fragmented modern self. This rings true for Eliot and Joyce, where char acters without strong boundaries merge into other characters and, as Leopold Bloom says, "no one is anything." It does not ring true for Stevens, where the personae are enchanting and heroic. And it does not ring true for Stern. We don't feel ennui in Stern, or absence of will. Instead, we sense an expansive self that swells to fill robustly all its presences, each of which is added to the possibilities for enactment of a willed destiny. In a Whitmanesque passage where he addresses himself in the second person, the Stern speaker becomes everyone: "... you see yourself out there, you are a swimmer/in an old wool suit, you are an angry cabbie,/you are a jeweler, you are a whore . . ." (L 67). The passage continues in a tour de force chain of associations that levels and connects virtually everything: "when nothing is lost, when I can go forth and forth,/when the chain does not break off, that is paradise." The experi ence of metamorphosis at the heart of Stern acts as a signal not of division but of connection. Though Stern doesn't fit easily into any of the schools or groups of poets that have waxed and waned during his career, he can be placed in the broad, diffuse category of the neo-romantic: a modern or postmodern poet who shares certain motives of the romantics, not innocently but from a retrospective distance. Sanford Pinsker suggests the romantic label in a Missouri Review interview taped in 1979;14 he calls Stern "that rarest of creatures?a likeable Romantic," and compounds his sins, as he says, by suggesting "Jewish Romantic" and "Semi-Urban Romantic." He points to Stern's "high intensities" and his "prophetic quality" (56, Sarah Lawrence College MFA IN WRITING An intensive program combining small seminar workshops and bi-weekly private conferences with faculty.

PAGE 18 THE AMERICAN POETRY REVIEW</page><page sequence="9">59-60, 63). Many of the preferences we associate with textbook concepts of romanticism are evident in Stern: subjectivity, improbability, emo tionality, spontaneity, the dynamic, the infinite. His boldness under lined by melancholy is typically romantic, as is his reverence for a natu ral world infused with feeling and spirit. The most obvious distinction between Stern and the broad concept of romanticism is the high value he places on history, civilization and culture. His relationship with nature?or the world?can be defined in tradi tional romantic terms as a reunion, or in the later view epitomized by Harold Bloom, where nature is usurped by imagination. Or it can be examined in relation to a more complex view of romanticism as the paradox of consciousness. This view is still most convincingly put by Robert Pinsky. He sees Keats's relationship with the nightingale as an approach-avoidance mechanism that regrets the burden of conscious ness, yet recognizes that without it we do not exist (47-52).15 The paradox of consciousness and the effort to overcome it through willful imagination is in Stern serious, comic, ironic, and ultimately tragic, a romanticism conditioned by the modern. Two distinctions between Stern's performance and the romantic plot combine to establish his genre: the comic and the tragic. Stern's own definition of tragicomedy is "going through the motions of prayer without prayer/'16 He might have said "going through the emotions of prayer without an object of belief," a response to the modern dilemma that Stevens described by substituting the verb believe for the noun belief. Modern tragedy always has comic undertones because it is heroism cut off from absolutes. The hero whose tragic fall is not from some great height but from a curbstone is ludicrous; this is the basis of the absurd. Stern's speaker-hero is a tragicomic character whose closest relatives can be found in drama and fiction rather than among the poets. He sometimes calls to mind Chaplin's resourceful tramp, a forerunner of the absurd hero, whose life is accidental yet hopeful. His zany jeremiad comes closer to Beckett or Pinter, and even closer to Saul Bellow's Henderson the Rain King. Like those of the Stern speaker, Henderson's lavish adventures are fabular and fantastic. Both characters have the same kind of bizarre vitality. Both are rambling and impulsive. Both contain charged oppo sites; they are pathetic and heroic, serious and ironic, comic and godlike. Both are obsessed by suffering and transcendence. And their voices are strikingly similar. Here's Henderson: The left hand shakes with the right hand, . . . the hands play patty-cake, and the feet dance with each other. And the seasons. And the stars, and all of that. (276) As he waited to achieve his heart's desire, he was telling me that suffering was the closest thing to worship that I knew anything about. ... I was mon strously proud of my suffering. I thought there was nobody in the world that could suffer quite like me. (255)17 Here's the Stern speaker, talking about himself: The truth is he has become his own sad poem, he walks and eats and sleeps in total sadness, sadness is even what he calls his life, he is the teacher of sadness. . . . (PP 20) and [it is] his own sorrow that saves him?he is saved by his own sorrow?it is his victory? (PP 21) two great masters of suffering and sadness singing songs about love and regeneration. (PP 18) The similarity between Stern and Bellow is partly a function of their sim ilar responses to Jewish tradition. Jewish and Biblical influence is appar ent in the joyful sadness of both writers, in their language and phrasing, their emphasis on suffering, and their respect for tradition and learning. Rabbinical tendencies can be seen in both; in fact, the Stern speaker often assumes a rabbinical mask. Behind all the masks and ruses of Stern's spokesman stands a single character who, like the traditional tragicomic protagonist, is known for his passionate outbursts and the surprising turns of plot in which he is immersed. He reminds us of the buffoon, an archetypal character defined by Suzanne Langer as "the indomitable living creature fending for itself, tumbling and stumbling" like a clown, caught up in "absurd expecta tions and disappointments," living through "an improvised existence" (342).18 Though his outlandish performance sometimes borders on burlesque, he enacts all the characteristics of the tragic hero. He sometimes be comes almost godlike; with overweening pride, he imagines himself as the creator: "I put the clouds in their place and start the ocean/on its daily journey up the sand ..." (R 11). He crowns himself with the gar land of the classical hero: "I make a garland for my head, it is/a garland of pity?I won't say glory ... it is the terror" (L 33). The experience he embodies and creates is suffused with tragic terror and pity: pity is for this life, pity is the worm inside the meat, pity is the meat, pity is the shaking pencil, pity is the shaking voice? not enough money, not enough love?pity for all of us?it is our grace, walking down the ramp or on the moving sidewalk, sitting in a chair, reading the paper, pity, turning a leaf to the light, arranging a thorn. (L 33) Stern's goal, like that of tragedy, is to '4convert/death and sadness into beautiful singing" (PP 42). "There is a point," he writes, "where even Yiddish/becomes a tragic tongue" (PP 78). Suffering opens into cathar sis, spiritual enlargement, and the encounter with transcendence. The Stern speaker is at once a comedian and a hero: a clumsy uncle full of pranks and hocus-pocus whose glasses are always falling off and a figure of mythic dimensions who, like an old god, changes form at will. In all his guises, he is a "man of the heart": all alone in the darkness, a man of the heart making plans to the end, a screen for the terror, a dish for the blood, a little love for strangers, a little kindness for insects, a little pity for the dead.
