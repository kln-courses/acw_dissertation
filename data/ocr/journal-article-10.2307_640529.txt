<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Ferocious Is the Centipede": A Study of the Significance of Eating and Speaking in Samoa JEANNETTE MARIE MAGEO Polynesia was long imagined as a realm of easy satisfactions. Al- though this fantasy largely concerned sexual behavior, it extended to eating as well. Early mariners returning from Tahiti, Hawaii, and Samoa pictured these isles as gardens of Eden where-rather than toiling for one's daily bread-one merely plucked it from the trees in the form the early wayfarers donned breadfruit. As elsewhere in Polynesia, in Samoa food is easily acquired. However, contrary to expectation, one does not find any dearth of anxiety about the issue of oral gratification. For Samoans, eating, as a symbolic activity, is fraught with conflicting meanings and emotions. The question "What are you doing that for?" is expressed in Sa- moan as "E fai fua lava, e 'aina?," which actually means "Why bother, is it edible?" As Samoans link intrinsic value to edibility, JEANNETTE MARIE MAGEO is a Post-Doctoral Fellow in Anthropology at the Univer- sity of California at San Diego, La Jolla. 387</page><page sequence="2">388 ETHOS they also communicate love, respect, and even political fealty through the cooking and serving of food.' Children prepare and serve their elders food. Commoners likewise serve their chiefs. To tautua a chief normally means to bring a basket of prepared food for his (or very infrequently her) Sunday lunch; however, tautua can sig- nify any service that demonstrates fealty. Kraemer even reports that the last paramount chief of Samoa (Tafa'ifja), attained his position through his excellent services to the former Tafa'ifa, "particularly in the kitchen" ([1902] 1978:16).2 Conversely, the 19th-century missionary Stair tells us that, when one village defeated another in war, "Mere boys from the dominate party were accustomed to affect the airs of their elders, and order old greyheaded men [from the los- ing village] to cook food for them" (Stair 1897:249). As the child's filial duties are conceived of through an alimentary metaphor, it seems apt that threats which parents use to curtail mis- behavior often involve metaphorical ingestion. When threatening a coconut-frond beating, mothers say "Vd'ai 'oe 'id 'e 'aia le salu," which means "You better watch out or you are going to eat the fronds." Alternatively, a punitive parent might say "Toeitiiti o'u alu atu lea pa'agugu ind lou ulu," meaning "I am almost coming over there to crunch your head." The word pa'agugu is also used in reference to the mastication of bones by dogs (Milner [1966] 1979:171). Recently I heard a child, who would not follow his mother homeward, told "Vd'ai le lo'omatua lae i lalo 'o le pulu e sau nei 'ai 'oe," "Watch that old lady underneath the Pulu tree, she's coming now to eat you." This is a typical remark to the way- ward child. On the civic level, the traditional punishments that were used to curtail adult misbehavior often involved literal ingestion. Most vi- olations of village regulations were punished by a levy of foodstuffs. However, the most severe of ancient punishments involved eating as well. In the traditional ceremony of apology (ifoga), the wrongdoers brought the necessary materials whereby those they had offended might cook and eat them if they so chose (Brown [1910] 1972:290). C. Stuebel says those who sinned against the pre-Christian gods were sometimes cooked and eaten (1976:84). Criminals might be forced to chew the teve (Amorphophallus), a poisonous plant that causes severe irritation of the mouth and internal organs and often death (0. Stuebel [1896] 1973:60-61; Stair 1897:95; Turner [1861]</page><page sequence="3">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 389 1986:192; Brown [1910] 1972:291; Herman [1944] 1954:3; Freeman 1983:195). Troublemakers could be bound hand and foot and cast into a pigsty to eat with the pigs until they died, or they could be trussed up like a pig, with excrement then packed into their mouths (Herman [1944] 1954:4; Freeman 1983:193). Self-punishment followed a similar pattern. In traditional times, should the younger brother of a high chief (ali'i) feel ill-treated, he would signal his intent to leave that ali'i by biting off his little fin- ger, " '0 le lima 'ua atieseina," and throwing it at the brother (C. Stuebel 1976:140-141). More recently, when Western Samoa sus- tained a suicide epidemic in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the most prevalent method was the ingestion of paraquat (Bowles 1985). The antinomic significance of eating in Samoan semiology is par- alleled in the significance of speech. Many Samoans have told me that fa'aaloalo is the primary value of their society. Normally the word is glossed as "respect," but in a newspaper letter to the editor, one Samoan (Salu Reed) gives the term a more behavioral defini- tion: "Fa'aaloalo . . . means to hold your tongue, even when the di- rections given you by your elders are wrong" (Reed 1989:4). Never- theless, the most renowned, powerful, and wealthy persons in Sa- moa are orators, whose eloquent rhetoric commands the respect of all. Fa'aleo, which literally means "to make voice," is glossed as "to pronounce" or "to articulate"-but it also means to hold in high esteem (Milner [1966] 1979:106). Antisocial behavior, too, is conceived of as a manner of speaking. Samoa is an intensely hierarchical society. In hierarchical societies insubordination is tantamount to lawlessness. The most common of Samoan childhood delinquencies is to be tautalaitiiti. The term ac- tually means "to talk above one's age," but it is commonly glossed as "cheeky" and is used in reference to any form of insubordination. Even in adulthood, unrestrained speech is a primary metaphor for uncivil conduct. Fialeolagona literally means "to want to make one- self heard," but it can refer to anyone who is presuming above his or her proper status. Thus it is not surprising that there is an old Samoan proverb which says, " '0 le sala e tau'ave i lefofoga," "Sin is carried in the mouth" (Sutter 1975:57). Nonetheless, it is at least mildly astonish- ing to the Western ear that " 'Ai tae!" ("Eat excrement!") is not only the most common Samoan expletive (Freeman 1983:208), but</page><page sequence="4">390 ETHOS also the first thing Samoan infants learn to say (Schoeffel 1979:126- 127; Ochs 1982:91).3 The centrality of eating and speaking in Samoan symbolism in- vites scrutiny. One possible explanation is provided by Erik Erik- son. Erikson believes that cultures shape character by the style in which they manage the successive stages of child development. Each of the stages is characterized by a psychosocial issue and, as in Freud's model, linked to a bodily zone (Erikson [1950] 1963:73-97). If all goes placidly during a given stage, the psychosocial issue, and the bodily area associated with this issue, fade from significance at the conclusion of the phase. However, if the period is marked by a traumatic event, the issue, the zone, and its functions are likely to retain special symbolic importance in adulthood. For example, the psychosocial issue which Erikson associates with the first phase of development is trust; the highlighted area is the mouth. The infant's primary activity is oral, that is, it nurses. As it is entirely dependent upon others for sustenance, the infant must be able to feel trust in their willingness and ability to care. If the first stage of a child's life is traumatic, trust remains an issue of paramount importance and the functioning of the mouth, be it in eating or talking or in other oral activities, remains cathexed. It is well known that in traditional Polynesian societies the first phase of the baby's existence ended in a dramatic transition (Bea- glehole and Beaglehole 1938, 1946; Jane Ritchie 1957; James Rit- chie 1956, 1963; Gardner 1965; Levy 1973; Gallimore, Boggs, and Jordan 1974; Howard 1974; Sutter 1980; Martini and Kirkpatrick 1981). Having been accustomed to solicitous care by adult women, the child was handed over to a slightly older sibling, usually a sister. The Beagleholes were first to speculate about the psychological and social consequences of this early fall from parental grace. In line with Erikson, they suggest that the crisis that concludes babyhood in Polynesia affects basic trust, turning the child "into an uncon- sciously insecure adult" (1946:144). Later students of Polynesian psychology have questioned the sweeping consequences that the Beagleholes attribute to this tran- sition.4 This article does not concern Polynesian character in gen- eral, but only Samoan character. Neither does it attempt to deline- ate the full psychological effects of this transition, but only its influ- ence on the construction of moral categories. I intend to argue that</page><page sequence="5">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 391 the timing and character of the Samoan shift from maternal to sib- ling care not only determines, but is also determined by, the ethical significance Samoans ascribe to different uses of the mouth. How- ever, this significance is confounded, as Erikson and perhaps also the Beagleholes might predict, with the issue of trust. Ethnographers are in agreement that Samoa is a highly com- munal society. In an earlier article I argued that, as a result of this orientation, what Samoans call the loto (most adequately glossed as "subjectivity") is an excluded and suspect element of the self (1989). Here I hope to show that unchecked orality is the Samoan intaglio, both of a subjective orientation and of uncivil conduct. Virtue, on the other hand, is equated with a communal orientation and signed by oral restraint. But more particularly, the duplicitous use of the mouth in speech-the persuasive tongue that invites the trust of the community but betrays its listeners for personal gain-is a primary Samoan metaphor for evil itself. In this manner the essay attempts to construct a bridge between Samoan moral categories and child- rearing practices, clarifying how cognitive structures and those dy- namics that are internalized in childhood are congruent. Little has been done in Samoan ethnology to connect the two. Our vehicle for this analysis of Samoan character is a song called "Ferocious Is the Centipede." Taufe' ai le Atualoa E taufe'ai le atualoa, 'Ae leaga epala'ai i le moa. E tamdli'i le tufanua 'Ae iloa ia ona fiua. Efa'apend Satani, I lonafiapoto i le lalolagi. 'A o'o mai le i'uga, 'Ua susunu i le afi. Ferocious is the centipede, But scared of the chicken. This low life has noble manners But know him by his fruits. Just like Satan, He acts like the smartest thing on earth, But when the end comes, He'll be burnt in the fire.5 The song is typically sung during the taualuga. The taualuga is a dance that concludes any occasion involving dancing and singing in</page><page sequence="6">392 ETHOS Samoa-from ceremonies to feasts, to festivals. Samoans, yesterday and still today, enjoy a plenitude of song and dance, which means one hears taualuga songs frequently. What Levi-Strauss and Radcliffe-Brown say about certain aborig- inal tales can be said of this little Samoan lyric as well. The song appears to be naively anthropomorphic. However, it is really a jux- taposition of the social world with the animal world for the purpose of developing a set of ideas about contrasting forms of social behav- ior (Levi-Strauss 1963; Radcliffe-Brown 1951). The subject is repre- hensible action, signified by the centipede, and the proper behavior which serves as its foil, signified by the chicken. Through a series of images in which the significance of the cen- tipede is first articulated and then repeatedly reversed, the verse frames successive models of delinquency, Samoan style. However, this essay intends to show that "Taufe'ai le Atualoa" is not so much a tableau of peccancy, as a process of thought about it. By meta- phorically elaborating the significance of the centipede, the song traces the steps through which evil, as a Samoan social category, is constructed. The first two lines will be considered at great length, since they will be used to introduce the reader to the world of Sa- moan meanings. The remaining lines will be dealt with in larger units and more briefly. ANALYSIS: LINE 1 E Taufe'ai le atualoa Ferocious is the centipede Because the song is about the centipede, its major concern is the form of social behavior for which this creature stands. The first ad- jective describing the animal is taufe'ai. Milner's Samoan/English dictionary defines taufe'ai as "fierce" or "savage." It is an intensi- fied version of the word fe'ai. Taufe'ai and fe'ai specifically denote a kind of savageness associated with biting. 'Ai means "to eat." Fe'ai typically refers to something that bites, wild dogs or lions, for example. Centipedes-because their bite is extremely painful-are likewise called taufe'ai. However, the word has associations with more than mere oral aggressiveness. Taufe'ai is also used to de- scribe cannibals. Cannibals not only signify oral aggressiveness to Samoans, but also their own dark past. Even before the advent of</page><page sequence="7">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 393 Christianity, cannibalism had been abandoned and was an inclu- sive symbol for libertine impulses and savagery (Henry 1980:50-51; C. Stuebel 1976:66-69; Powell and Pratt 1891:128-129).6 AGGRESSIVE ORALITY AS A SYMBOL FOR IMPULSIVENESS The equation between oral aggressiveness and license-evident in the figure of the cannibal-is laced throughout Samoan social discourse and Samoan imaginings. For example, a good little Sa- moan girl is thought to remain at the beck and call of her elders. However, some girls go ta'a, running about and being found where they should not be.7 Such a girl, especially if she does not return home before dark, is called taufe'ai. Adults will say of her, "Tajfef 'ai a se taufe'ai pe'a matua." This sentence glosses as "I am afraid she will be promiscuous when she grows up." Or they will say to her, " 'Ai a sou taufe'ai pe'a 'e matua," meaning "You will prob- ably be wanton when you grow up." A young unmarried woman who goes out by herself at all, but especially at night, is seen as aggressive in Samoan culture. She is brave in too bold a manner, a manner that bespeaks a lack of the fear of God. My Samoan husband is a mild and gentle man. None- theless, when he sees a lass drifting about alone at night, I have heard him say she is "looking for sex." People will assume she is licentious and will call her taufe'ai. Thus, oral aggressiveness is a synonym for "wild" behavior, per se. There is other evidence of the equation between eating and a more general instinctuality in the Samoan vocabulary. For example, "Fai dmio" is a phrase that refers both to stealing food at night and to sexual behavior (Shore 1982:195).8 Amiolilo literally means "a hidden behavior" but actually refers to sneaking either food or sex. Many songs also equate the pleasures of eating and lovemaking. One of my favorites compares the beloved to a can of corn beef, to crackers from Fiji, and to chop suey with tomatoes and peas.9 In fantasy, Shore's informants imagine a world lacking law and order as one of unshackled dining. There would be no thought given to planting and to doing useful chores, but only to living it up, having a good time. People would move about [alu solo] and contin- ually eat here and there ['ai'ai solo]. Behavior would be very evil [leaga]. If someone wanted to eat he would just walk into a house, and if man and woman [i.e., the residents] were there, he'd take over the house. The whole village would be broken apart. [Shore 1982:157-158]</page><page sequence="8">394 ETHOS Aggressive Speech as Taufe'ai. Not only is aggressive eating an in- clusive symbol for wild, uncivilized conduct in Samoa, so, also, is belligerent speech. We will soon see that those who speak without restraint, just as those who bite, turn out to be taufe'ai. Therefore, understanding those terms through which Samoans condemn im- proper speech can help us understand both what it means to be fe- rocious within the Samoan social cosmos and the significance of the centipede. Perhaps the most important, and certainly the most common, pe- jorative term used to censor improper talk is tautalaitiiti. We saw ear- lier that tautalaitiiti literally means "to talk when little" and is the standard condemnation of juvenile affrontery. However, like tau- fe'ai, tautalaitiiti also refers to sexual brazenness. I teach a Samoan- Pacific Studies class in which students conduct interviews in the vil- lages. Recently an old woman told us that, in past times, when a young girl did not show up for evening prayers, she was thought to be tautalaitiiti. What the old woman meant was that the girl was sus- pected of having a boyfriend and, thus, was guilty of an indiscretion. Whenever young people in Samoa are discovered to have had sex outside of marriage, or even when they express a desire to marry young, Samoans call them tautalaiti.1? Tautalaitiiti not only connotes a lack of modesty, it also indicates a positive pleasure in showing what should be hidden. Shortly after I arrived in American Samoa seven years ago, I visited Western Sa- moa. As I drove through back villages, young boys would practi- cally hurl themselves at my car, smiling broadly and shouting words which I later discovered were grossly sexual and aggressive. These boys were tautalaiti. Normally Samoan children are circumspect with an adult, but as I was obviously an outsider, these youngsters realized I lacked the power to punish them for their behavior. When Samoan elders are absent, children often take the occasion to show normally hidden things. For example, tautalaiti little boys sometimes expose themselves to little girls in order to make the girl md (shy, embarrassed). I know some fellows who, when they were tautalaiti youngsters, would get up late at night and wrap their heads and shoulders in their lavalava instead of their genitals. In this state they would run laughing in front of cars on the main road. However, tautalaitiiti not only connotes sexual brazenness, but so- cial brazenness as well, and is really a catchall for those behaviors</page><page sequence="9">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 395 and attitudes that are perceived to be at odds with proper deference. Willfulness, but also the open expression of personal thoughts and feelings, is so perceived. For example, children are thought to be tautalaiti should they follow their own wills rather than obediently serving their elders, but also if they ask adults too many questions or come forth too readily with their own opinion. When I first began teaching college in Samoa my polite students would no more have revealed an idea than a thigh. Either would have been regarded as unseemly. In summary, taufe'ai refers to illicit sexual and aggressive behav- ior which, in childhood, would commonly be condemned as tauta- laitiiti. Tautalaitiiti, however, refers to more than mere sexual and aggressive impulsiveness. Primarily it connotes the flaunting of the subjective elements of the self (impulses included) in the face of au- thority, the signature of which is an improper use of speech. Show- ing off anything personal, be it a thought or one's privates, espe- cially in the face of authority-especially in speech-is a fundamen- tal Samoan sign both for presuming above one's proper status and for unbridled impulse. An Enduring Patternfor Misbehavior. The word tautalaitiiti, itself, im- plies one has no status or authority and, therefore, no right to ex- press oneself. However, when one becomes an adult, the presump- tion is that one has some degree of status. Sisters have a place above their brothers and younger relatives. Men enjoy authority over their wives; wives, over their children. Men, and very occasionally women, may acquire a title, giving them power over a wider group of relatives. In acknowledgment of these positions, the actual term tautalaitiiti is not used. Nonetheless, the flaunting of elements of the subjective self, evident in "speaking above one's age," remains an idiom for the expression of rebellion against authority. It surfaces whatever one's age, when respectful behavior fails and self-mastery becomes tenuous or nonexistent. The following passage from Albert Wendt's Leaves of the Banyan Tree catches the flavor of this pattern as it endures in the adult. In Wendt's tale, women from two rival 'diga (extended family groups) have begun to fight. Samoan women are supposed to be models of gracious and dignified conduct. Thus, their brawling lends a little electric shock to the scene. The women are grappling with one an- other in the village malae, which functions as the village center and</page><page sequence="10">396 ETHOS which Shore calls the "sacred political meeting ground" (1977:30). Rank behavior in the bush at night is one thing, but such behavior on the malae is a kind of social sacrilege. To make it more so, the village pastor, Filipo, rushes to the scene. In Samoa the pastor, like the high chief, is taken to be a personification of social virtue. Fili- po's intervention represents a wonderfully pitiful attempt to reassert propriety in a situation where it has crumbled before the onslaught of personal feelings. "Quick Filipo. They're fighting!" "What now?" Filipo sighed. Grabbing his arm, Taulua cried, "They're clawing and tearing and killing one another!" She steered him out of the house towards the church, weeping about a vicious fight, an evil, Satan-inspired brawl. Filipo was now wide awake and he rehitched his lavalava, the only garment he was wearing. "There they are, the evil things!" Taulua wailed, releasing his arm and pushing him towards the crowd milling on the road. Filipo hesitated. Taulua pushed him again. "It's Filipo!" someone called. The crowd parted and left a clear lane for him. At the end of that narrow lane Filipo could see long hair being grasped and pulled by clawing hands, nude sweating breasts and torsos, arms and fists pummelling at faces twisted into obscene masks. "You fatherless whore!" He heard the words clearly, precisely, above the general roar of spitting obscenities, slaps, and ripping. "Your father was born in a shit- house!" Filipo stopped. The spectators watched him. "Here, see this, you pig," screamed one Amazon, baring her backside, "it's as fresh as the day you were born!" Filipo trembled, gulped. "Fresh? Touch your arse!" Filipo forced himself down the lane. The crowd closed in behind him. There before him was one of the worst evils of all: brawling, near-naked women-an obscene battalion of them- on the road and in the ditches, tearing out one another's hair, ripping at one an- other's faces and eyes and skins and clothes, kicking, biting, and-most unforgiv- able of all-shattering God's peaceful afternoon with foul, very unchristian lan- guage. "Stop!" he shouted. "Stop, I tell you!" The brawling Amazons took no notice of him. A massive woman of the Aiga Tauilopepe, right in front of Filipo, hiked up her lavalava, and baring her naked backside in the face of Malo's house shouted, "There, take that, you motherless, fatherless shit-eaters!" Two of Malo's Amazons jumped on her, toppled her to the road, and clawed and struck at her. Filipo grabbed one of them round the waist and tried to pull her back. She elbowed him in the right eye and pushed him into the ditch. Filipo bounced up, his stinging eye turning blue already, grabbed at his waist, found no lavalava, desperately covered his genitals with his hands, ducked down into the ditch, cursed "Whore!," hitched on his lavalava again, and sprang out of the ditch and into the midst of the brawlers, slapping out at any Amazon who was near him, shouting: "That's enough. I'll tell your fathers. I'll tell!" His blows and threats had no effect. So Filipo wept.</page><page sequence="11">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 397 His tears didn't touch the brawlers but they elicited aid from the spectators who converged on the grappling Amazons and pushed and carried them towards their homes. Some of the crowd were disappointed that the most colorful fight in years was over, so they encouraged the brawlers to hurl stones and obscenities at one another. [Wendt 1979:110-111] These Amazons, like the centipede, are nothing if not taufe'ai. Wendt's scene-with its claws and elbows and bare torsos and in- securely fastened lavalava-is violent and voluptuous, if comically so. Nonetheless, this display of "savage" impulses is for a purpose. It is meant as a put-down both to the other 'diga and to all author- ities, who-like poor Filipo-call for greater restraint in the expres- sion of subjective sentiments. Thus, like the tautalaitiiti child, what these women lack is respect. Sigo (baring one's backside) is analo- gous to tautalaitiiti behavior in the sense that it also signifies the wan- ton brandishing of one's personal opinions.1l Remarkably, how- ever, what Filipo thinks "most unforgivable of all" in the whole de- lirious scene are the women's biting words. Thus, language run amuck is the central metaphor, both for shedding the trappings of civilization and for brazening what any polite Samoan would cloak. SOCIALIZING A JUMPING MOUTH Let us retrace the ground covered thus far. The atualoa (cen- tipede) is a symbol of oral aggressiveness. Oral aggressiveness- whether it has to do with eating or speaking-is fused, in Samoa, with the idea of uncivilized behavior and, also, with behavior in which the personal or subjective self is blazoned forth, rather than being politely put aside. These three elements-oral aggressiveness, savagery, and the unfiltered expression of subjectivity-are equated in Samoan semiology. All are savage. All are taufe'ai. All are the concern of the centipede song. This equation is established in childhood through the manner in which Samoans manage the transition that marks the conclusion of the first phase of the child's life. The two periods bridged by this transition are differentiated by divergent parental attitudes toward eating and speech. An examination of this difference in regard will clarify why the aggressive use of the mouth is such an important metaphor for antisocial conduct-in Samoan childhood, in Samoan social consciousness, and in the centipede song. Infancy. In traditional times the baby was nursed, for comfort as well as for hunger, whenever it cried. The change from parental to</page><page sequence="12">398 ETHOS sibling care, while beginning early, became pronounced at weaning. Weaning took place between the first and second year.12 The sibling who carried the babe about thereafter was apt to feed it less solici- tously than the mother once had. Thus began a long transition, from being lavishly fed, to feeding and caring for others. Tots started practicing to serve their parents (Gardner 1965:153). By three or four, children ate only after their elders had taken their share (Ger- ber 1975:39, 45-46; Keesing and Keesing [1956] 1973:79). By the age of five, youngsters could make and serve their elders food, and the transition was complete. At age five my Samoan husband often cooked and carried his parents their meals. Then, should children try to sit beside their parents at meals rather than eat last, parents would say " 'Ese mo lou fia laui'a." One might gloss this phrase as "You want to be a big fish, rather than a small fish." Actually, a laui'a is a large fish prepared for cooking in the umu (earth oven) by weaving it in coconut leaves. Fish may also be prepared by placing a bunch of small fish (afi) in a breadfruit leaf. The motif of the child as a laui'a has a significant place in Sa- moan lore. It can be found in the story of the most fabled proponent of cannibalism in old Samoa, Malietoa Uilamatutu Faiga. Young people were sent from various tributary villages for his feasts until, in sympathy for two of the victims, his son had himself trussed as a laui'a and presented to his father (C. Stuebel 1976:66-70). In both the word laui'a and its history lie a vague, funny, but also threat- ening innuendo that the child is the stuff of which meals are made. However, the expression fialaui'a was used, not only in relation to importunate table manners, but also when children asked their parents too many questions. Thus, this early transition was not merely from maternal to sibling care, and from being fed to feeding others; it also signaled a shift in orientation toward the child's self- expression. In Samoa, infantile tears are attended to with alacrity and concern. Penelope Schoeffel is an ethnographer who is also the wife of a Samoan. During her residence in her husband's village, someone in her 'diga picked up her infant whenever it cried (Schoeffel 1979:101).13 The attitude toward those tears that accom- pany early frustration is still evident in Samoan mothers today. I know of one 40-year-old mother who used to feed her two-year-old Bongos and Mountain Dew for breakfast. When asked why she gave</page><page sequence="13">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 399 her daughter such unhealthy food, the woman replied helplessly, "She cries if I give her anything else." This child was often taken to work with her mother because she sobbed when her mother stepped out of the family car. Service versus Speech. Traditionally, when the child passed into the care of an older sibling, a modulation in attitude, at first subtle, took place. The older sibling's primary responsibility was to keep the baby quiet so that it did not disturb adults (Mead [1928] 1961:23- 24). Sometimes this rubric meant that the infant's needs had to be appeased, but it also meant that the elder child was often telling the younger one to hush. Parents began to withdraw from close rela- tionships with a child, and most physical and verbal demonstrations of affection ceased, when the child was about two years of age (Ger- ber 1975:51). Gardner says that orders, sternly delivered, gradually replaced the earlier intimacy between parent and child (1965:145- 146). In Samoan, to carry out commands is to fa'alogo, which means both "to obey" and "to listen." Service, as a form of listening, is the opposite of expressing oneself. Thus, demanding service from the child constitutes a reversal of the former attentiveness to the child's tears.14 The intent of this imperious style of communication- which is still typical today-is to teach children their proper place in the Samoan hierarchy. In Samoa, deference to those above one in the hierarchy is tantamount to a communal orientation, for au- thority figures represent the interests and claims of the groups for which they officiate. What stands in the way of this deference is the child's own will (loto) and the personal thoughts and feeling that fuel the will: in a word, subjectivity.15 Service, therefore, particularly the serving of food, is a symbol for the subservience of the self-as-subject to the larger community. Sutter tells a story that illustrates this symbol- ism. A child who fails to share voluntarily and spontaneously is criticized and consid- ered bad. This value is embedded in the vocabulary itself. Not to share is to be without love, tiliva'agoto, and to eat alone is to be greedy, fa'aumu'umua. The village pastor elaborated on this theme while discussing his own upbringing. When a child, he caught a turtle which he kept and fed for years. His father noticed his attention to and delight in his possession and used this as the basis for a never- forgotten lesson. One day his father announced that the time had come to kill the</page><page sequence="14">400 ETHOS turtle and share it with the village by giving it to the council of chiefs for their feast.... [Sutter 1980:39-40] This beloved turtle embodies the boy's personal feelings and, more generally, his subjective self. 16 Sanctions and Jumping Mouths. While those in authority expend a great deal of energy trying to transform their children into ready servants, parents say that children are all too often fa'alogogatd. Fa'alogogatd means "disobedient," but literally translates as "hard to make listen." The counterpoint to listening is talking back. Chil- dren who disagree with what they are told to do may stamp their feet or frown, and this level of insurrection will usually be tolerated, as long as it is silent and followed by compliance. However, once the child is verbal, even those tears that are so anxiously attended to in infants come to be treated as a reprehensible complaint against le- gitimate authority. Children are not even to cry when they are beaten. Freeman provides a graphic description. Despite the severity of the punishment the child is not permitted to show emotion. Thus, if a child persists in crying aloud the parent continues to punish him, shout- ing Uma! Uma! ("Have done! Have done!"). Not until the child sits stock still with his legs crossed and head bowed, and suppresses his emotions by not overtly crying, does his punishment cease. This treatment is meted out to young children of both sexes from as young as three or four years of age. [Freeman 1983:206] When children wail, they are accused of acting above their station and called fiafa'ali'i. Fa'ali'i means "to act like a high chief." In Samoanfia means "to want to do." So, for example,fia'ai means "to want to eat," or "to be hungry." Fiamoe means "to want to sleep," or "to be sleepy." Inasmuch as fia denotes wanting rather than being, it can, when applied to roles, connote pretension. Thus fiasili, which literally means "to want to be the best," actually im- plies that the person, while acting like a snob, only pretends to real distinction (Mead [1928] 1961:128). In the case of fiafa'ali'i, fia signifies an imitation both presumptuous and false.17 Structurally speaking, the posture predicated as appropriate for receiving parental punishment is the counterpoint to fiafa'ali'i. By sitting down and bowing their heads, children place themselves be- neath their superiors.18 By being silent, they demonstrate their readiness to listen and to suppress their own subjective reaction to the dictates of their elders. 9</page><page sequence="15">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 401 When children actually do talk back they are called gutuoso, which means "jumping mouth."20 Jumping mouths provoke the most ex- treme punishments. Freeman again provides a dramatic example. The youngest child I have observed being subjected to this kind of discipline was eighteen months old: a female infant named Sasa, born on 2 October 1965, was punished by her mother on 18 April 1967 for going out in the sun after having been told not to do so. After hitting her daughter heavily and repeatedly about the head and body with her open hand, the mother shouted angrily: "Have done! Have done! Shut your mouth!" When the child continued to cry, the mother clamped her hand over the child's mouth to stifle all expression of emotion. At the outset of this encounter, when she was first smacked, Sasa had shouted angrily at her mother the most common of all Samoan expletives, "Eat shit!" [Free- man 1983:207-208]21 Only those in charge have the right to speak, and then only in re- lation to their underlings. Malietoa, who in the complex politics of Western Samoa was once something like a king, was called "Le e Fa'alogo 'i ai Sdmoa," meaning "the one to whom Samoa lis- tens" (Henry 1980:49). LINKS: MORAL CATEGORIES AND CHILD-REARING Melanie Klein might attribute the Samoan symbolism evident in the atualoa song to the timing of the child's descent from ready in- dulgence to silent service. Klein believes that our first antisocial im- pulse occurs during nursing and that it is a taufe'ai impulse to bite the breast. Subsequent withdrawal on the mother's part enrages the baby. The infant projects this feeling back upon the mother. In con- sequence, its image of the mother is split into a Good Mother and Bad Mother, that is, into the mother who satisfies and the mother who is the projected form of the child's own rage (Klein 1984).22 Traditionally, the Samoan child not only lost the breast at the time of weaning, but had to endure a fair degree of parental distanc- ing simultaneously. Perhaps for this reason those motifs that Klein delineates are intensified, and the aggressive use of the mouth re- mains the Samoan archetype of reprobate behavior. However, this explanation, while highly credible, is insufficient, since it fails to ac- count for the fact that the principal emblem of all those other be- haviors the Samoan child must learn to control is speech. One might argue that speech acquires special import because the period of its initial acquisition coincides both with the transference of the Samoan child's care from mother to sibling and with the end</page><page sequence="16">402 ETHOS of two-directional communication between the parents and the child. The psychologistJacques Lacan would offer an additional ex- planation. Initially, Lacan says, infants feel an undifferentiated and total need for the mother. As they learn to talk, they will attempt to satisfy this need by verbal demands for specific things. This trans- lation of need into concrete demands is part of children's first at- tempt to exert their personal will upon the environment. According to Lacan, speech is a primary metaphor for the subjective self be- cause language is its original instrument (Coward and Ellis 1977:105-121). Samoan socialization, as it aims at the cultivation of a communal self, is directed toward throttling this loquacious and demanding self-as-subject and, therefore, censors speech. Language is the primary medium through which we mold our worlds in light of personal thoughts, feelings, and desires. Because speech is the first version of language for all of us, free expression is a fundamental metaphor for personal freedom. Certainly, this is one reason why a nation like America (which seeks, at least in theory, to provide maximum freedom for the individual subject) makes free- dom of speech the first tenet of the Bill of Rights. Because Samoan culture seeks to promote a communal self and to curtail the subject, unruly speech becomes a symbol of antisocial behavior and "listen- ing," the epitome of civil conduct. ANALYSIS: LINE 2 'Ae leage epala'ai ile moa But scared of the chicken The song begins to deal with the problem of taufe'ai behavior by showing the atualoa in relation to the moa (chicken). In the animal world, the centipede is fear-inspiring. Ordinarily, chickens are not frightening beasts. However, in Samoan songs and tales the chicken is a brave creature. Thus the Samoan word for the male moa is toa. Toa is also the word for those warriors who served the high chiefs of ancient times (Goldman 1970:13-14, 258-259; Kirch 1984:64). Here is an old song that refers to the fighting cock as a species of moa. 'Oi Moa e Na ou sau outefa'atau moa Moa uli, moa sina '0 le moa 'ua ita 'ilefiafa' amisa</page><page sequence="17">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 403 Oh chicken i I came to buy some chicken Black chicken, white chicken The moa is angry and wants to fight.23 Moa are particularly brave when it comes to atualoa. Upon seeing a centipede, the moa will chase it, pecking briskly after it (to'i to'i). Upon catching the centipede, the chicken will eat it. In relation to the chicken, therefore, all is reversed. Although not ferocious, the chicken turns out to be brave, while the centipede turns tail and runs. Line 2 of the song under study says that, despite his fierce ap- pearance, the centipede is pala'ai. When used as an adjective pala'ai means "scared," but as a noun pala'ai signifies "coward." Pala'ai, like taufe'ai, is built upon the word 'ai, "to eat." Pala means "dirt" or "decaying things"; rotten fruit or old leaves pala in the forest, thereby becoming dirt. Thus, cowards are those who eat dirt, or its facsimile, presumably at the feet of those who they fear. The song's formula for misbehavior appears to be taufe'ai action plus a pala'ai nature. In this manner the song inverts the signifi- cance of the centipede. The frightening animal turns out to be the frightened animal. The ferocious one turns out to be a coward. The biter turns out to be a dirt-eater. The song also builds a polarity between the centipede and the chicken. Whereas the centipede rep- resents aggression, which might be mistaken for bravery but which is not, the chicken is the real thing. However, the song not only builds a polarity (both aural and sym- bolic) between the pecking moa and the dirt-eating atualoa. It also uncovers their commonality or relationship. Both animals assert power through their mouths. The implication is that the moa rep- resents a use of the mouth antithetical to the atualoa and, also, a par- allel mode of sociality that serves as the antidote to centipede-like incivility. In order to determine what that use of the mouth might be, a deeper investigation of the symbolic significance of the moa is needed. SA-MOA: SACRED CENTER The word moa has a number of other meanings, meanings that lend a symbolic backdrop to the significance of the chicken. In Sa- moan medicine the moa is a quasi-organ, which Samoans define as the body's center, for moa also means "center." The moa normally</page><page sequence="18">404 ETHOS rests above the navel, in the general area of the stomach. Native healers diagnose many of the diseases they treat as sicknesses of the moa.24 The belief in the importance of the center is characteristic of Samoan perspectives, not only on the body, but also on the body politic. Samoa: A Social Ideogram. The Samoan polis is riddled with sacred centers. Most prominent are thefaletele and the malae, which are the two locations where formal gatherings take place. Thefaletele is a large, round house with a tall roof, set on wooden posts. There are no walls. The malae is the large open space that marks the center of every village. The faletele is most often used for village fono (meetings). J. W. Davidson aptly says that the underlying concern of mostfono is "the mitigation of friction between families making up the village com- munity" (1967:20). In other words, the fundamental issue is main- taining the bond between 'diga. At fono the participating matai (chiefs) sit at the posts of the faletele (Mead [1928] 1961:34-35). Each matai serves as the delegate of an 'diga. The post accorded to each signs the family's relative position in the assembly. Thus the seating arrangement is a spatial icon of the relationship between 'diga within the village. Mead calls it the symbol of their unity (1937:282). In Samoa the word vd means both a "space between" and a "relationship." Thus the space within thefaletele represents the vd between 'diga. In the faletele, this vd is also the architectural and social center of a circle. As the matai at afono sit around the periphery of thefaletele, so also the faletele that belong to those 'diga that compose the village are arranged-at least in the ideal village plan-in a circular pattern around the malae.25 Each 'diga's faletele faces the malae, while their more profane buildings spread back toward the bush.26 Thus the malae-like space within thefaletele-is both the vd between families and the center of a circle. This concentric sense of space also characterizes the 'diga, itself. 'Aiga is the general term both for the group that eats together as a family and for all those who count themselves as members of one kin group. The more precise term for the latter group is, however, 'digapotopoto. The word potopoto means a "gathering" or "assem- bly," but it also connotes a gathering around a circle. Thus fa'aldpotopoto, literally "to make a potopoto," means "to make a cir-</page><page sequence="19">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 405 cle." Ldpotopoto means "round." Metaphorically speaking, the va be- tween members of the 'digapotopoto is also the center of a circle. In Samoa, society consists in commerce between 'digapotopoto. Within the village this relationship is geographically represented by the vd within thefaletele and by the malae, and these spaces also func- tion as village centers and, thus, moa. One of the many meanings one might attribute to the word "Samoa" is that it signifies this sacred space between 'diga which is both a relationship and a center. The word "Samoa" is composed of two smaller words, sd and moa. While moa means both "chicken" and "center," sd means "prohib- ited" or "taboo." Where we would post a "Do Not Enter" sign, Sa- moans post signs reading "'Ua Sd." Despite its secular uses in modern-day Samoa, the word sd is associated in traditional thought with the presence of a spiritual charge, that is with mana (Shore, 1989). Thus a church is called afalesd (literally, sd house) and the period of evening prayers, during which all movement in the village, all traffic on roads and paths, must cease, is called the Sd. In Samoan politesse one tends to treat vd as if they are sd. When passing between two people, Samoans duck down and say tulou. To us tulou sounds like "Excuse me," but it is really an attempt to repair a minor, but nonetheless felt, violation of the vd between two people. Likewise, when addressing a titled person in ceremony, speakers be- gin by saying "Tulouna," a variation on the word tulou. This open- ing is an apology for verbal intrusion into what is clearly sacred space. Every vd is a restricted area, taboo ground, upon which one tries not to intrude. However, if the vd between ordinary persons in mundane circumstances is also carefully skirted, it is because they, too, are regarded as representatives of their 'diga. Failure to honor them is taken as an insult to their family.27 Thus, it is really the vd between 'diga, rather than between the individuals per se, which is regarded as sad. Because of the sacredness of the vd between families, those spaces within the village that instantiate this relationship-namely thefale- tele and the malae-are emphatically sd. Except during ceremonies, their sacred character is delitescent. However, in the more spiritu- ally potent villages this spiritual charge remains evident in daily life. The faletele is set upon a raised stone foundation. In Polynesia, elevation is a visible token of respect. The floor of the village's high- est chief'sfaletele is supposed to be the highest in the village. In Vai-</page><page sequence="20">406 ETHOS loa (a village in American Samoa) the pastor recently built a two- story house. The floor of the second story was clearly higher than that of the high chief'sfaletele, and villagers have said that they ex- pected the new structure to suffer ill consequences. The sd character of the malae is conspicuous when the village is the home of a famous aitu (spirit). For example, in Letelesa's village (Lepea), or that of Sauma'eafe (Sale'imoa) or Letuiatua (Futiga), no woman can walk across the malae with a red flower behind her ear or the resident spirit will visit misfortune upon her.28 At the vil- lage currently called Faga'itua (formerly Fagaaitu, or Bay of Ghosts), sometimes at night a ghost girl is said to drag her hair across the malae.29 Then boys who have been roaming about to other families must stay the night with them, rather than cross the malae back to their own homes. 'Ava. The symbolic equation that has emerged thus far is as fol- lows: Samoan society is equal to the relationship between 'diga. The va within thefaletele and the va that is the malae are spatial ideo- grams for this relationship. These va are each the center of a circle and are scared. Thus, they are sd moa.30 However, this relationship between 'diga is not only statically portrayed in Samoan architec- ture and in the ideal village plan. 'Aiga actively recreate this vd by joining in ceremony. "Teu le vd" is an exhortation that expresses the ethos of the Sa- moan way of life.3l Teu means both to order and to decorate. One of my informants, John Kneubuhl, says it means "to tend," as one might tend a garden. In Samoa, ritual exists to "teu le vd," that is, both to set in order and to decorate the relationship or space be- tween families. Ritual and the 'ava (kava) ceremony are virtually synonymous in Samoan custom, as all ceremonial events begin, and usually end, with the serving of 'ava. The 'ava ceremony symbolically recon- stitutes the vd between 'diga by a joining-which is both rhetorical and enacted-in a circle.32 Making a circle is making an aloft, and so central is this concept of aloft to the serving of 'ava that the kava ceremony, itself, is sometimes called '0 le alofi (Mead [1930] 1969:102-109). This word is also used as a synonym for the various elements of the event. Both the assembled chiefs and the 'ava itself can be referred to as aloft (Mead [1930] 1969:102).33</page><page sequence="21">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 407 When the kava is clear, the kava announcer says " 'Ua usi le alo- fi," meaning "The kava is ready." This begins the ceremony. Usi means "to be ready," as in the case of kava, but, also, "to be melded together," as the assembled chiefs are melded together in one circle. Usi also means "to make a covenant" in which each party looks after and attends to the other. The end of the ceremony is declared in these terms, "'Ua moto le alofi," indicating that the circle is bro- ken. Thus, to make an 'ava ceremony is to form a circle of those who, as chiefs, represent their 'diga. The space within the circle made by this melding is a vd or relationship between 'adiga, and also a center.34 The moa (chicken) is the animal representative of this Sd moa (cen- ter). Even apart from social semiotics, there are myths in which Sa- moa is named after sacred chickens belonging to the god Lu (Turner 1884:10-15). Whether Samoa is taken to mean "Sacred Center" or "Holy Chickens" or something else altogether, linguistic coinci- dence makes the moa a mascot and emblem of the Fa'aSdmoa (the Samoan Way).35 Furthermore, it is the mode represented by the atu- aloa, in counterpoint to the moa, which the song condemns. By im- plication, the moa is an ambassador of Samoan ideals. FA 'A TAMALI'I What, then, is this style of action signed by the humble chicken and characterized, presumably, by a more civilized style of orality? It is that manner which complies with the exhortation, "Teu le vd," and which thereby tends the relationship between families. Sa- moans call itfa'atamali'i. Fa'atamdli'i literally translates as "the way of chiefs," and it is synonymous in Samoa with the manners of gentility.36 These gen- teel manners are characterized by oral restraint. Traditionally, ali'i left a bit of food on their serving mat at the conclusion of the meal. Ali'i did not speak in formal gatherings, but were spoken for by talking chiefs (tuldfale). This restrained manner of eating and speaking signs an attitude in which the interests of the community take precedence over privatistic urges. Once again the community is conceived of as a relationship between 'diga. If Samoan society consists in commerce between 'diga, Samoan politics consists in competition between 'diga for dominance. This competition is, of course, potentially disruptive to the rapport be- tween them. Those who are fa'atamdli'i reassert this sacred vd by</page><page sequence="22">408 ETHOS speaking in a manner aimed at compensating for the tendency to- ward contention. Their speech exalts the person to whom they speak. Because of the hierarchical nature of Samoan society, re- spectful behavior places the other above oneself, but it also symbol- ically confers sovereignty upon them. Because persons act as agents of their 'diga, to elevate another is to pay respect to his or her fam- ily. Therefore, this behavioral style succeeds in smoothing over the perpetual struggle for ascendancy which is endemic to the Samoan social cosmos. In fa'atamali'i manners, the sovereignty conferred through def- erence is only symbolic. Nonetheless, the behavior of fa'atamdli'i adults shows a superficial resemblance to that of the obedient Sa- moan child who is silent about personal thoughts, feelings, and de- sires in deference to authority. The result of this deference is that courteous adults hesitate to say "No," even when they mean it. One must at least make a show of accommodating the other person, even if one has no real intention of following through. For example, I asked a Samoan relative of mine to participate in a panel discussion. He said "Yes," even though-unbeknownst to me-he had another commitment for the afternoon that the discus- sion was to take place. He even assured me that morning he was coming, although he never did show up. The man simply could not bring himself to be so disrespectful to me as to actually refuse. Some- times this mode of discourse can, however, have real consequences for the actor. Young women, if they are asked to dance, cannot de- cline. I have even heard a girl explain that she married a man be- cause he begged her so often that she became ashamed to rebuff him. ANALYSIS: LINES 3-6 E tamali'i le tufanua 'Ae iloa ia onafua. Efa'apend Satani, I lonafiapoto i le lalolagi. This low life has a noble manner But know him by his fruits. Just like Satan, He acts like the smartest thing on earth.</page><page sequence="23">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 409 The song delineates an image of evil in the person of the centipede by a series of reversals, both of image and of expectation. The first line of the song presents a taufe'ai centipede. In the second line this image is reversed, as the centipede turns out to be pala'ai. The sec- ond line also establishes a polarity between the centipede and the chicken, which is really an opposition of two types of Samoans. Al- bert Wendt, the Samoan novelist, describes the two types like this: Our public face is nearly always placid, obedient, courtly, orderly, generous, hos- pitable, considerate, impassive. ... [I]t is the tu-faatamalii, the way of the true aris- tocrat, the ideal on which all human behavior must be modeled.... There is also the opposite way, the way of the tu-fanua, he who transgresses, who does not behave like a tamalii, and brings shame to his aiga, village, country. [Wendt 1983:14, quoted in Shore 1984:256] However, after setting up this polarity in the first two lines, in the third line the song again reverses the image of the centipede. Con- trary to expectation, the centipede is called tamdli'i. Tamdli'i is a shortened version of the word fa'atamdli'i, that form of behavior which Wendt says betokens Samoan nobility and which this analysis has linked to the chicken. If the adjective used to signify the centipede is tamdli'i, the noun the song employs for our toxic friend is tufanua, which means something on the order of a low life. What is the meaning of this second reversal in the signifi- cance of the centipede? Up to this point we have seen that Samoan childhood establishes a dichotomy between behavior that is fa'atamdli'i and behavior that is fiafa'ali'i. Both types of behavior are evident in youngsters; sometimes Samoan children are wonderfully polite, sometimes cheeky. Insubordinate behavior, however, is largely ineffective in the Samoan social cosmos because it is so ubiquitously censored. Consequently-except under pressure from extreme emotion- adults seldom use this avenue for the expression of personal needs. Inasmuch as the centipede song is focused on the problem of anti- social behavior, it must address more than the taufe'ai manners of the naughty child and the frenzied adult; it must also address the problem of evil. Evidently the centipede, as a Samoan archetype of evil, partakes of the personalistic and importunate behavior of im- maturity, but is careful to resemble its mirror opposite. If the centipede has a gracious mien, the fourth line is quick to reassure us that its tamdli'i manners are belied by its 'fua" (fruits). This line is a biblical reference in which "fruits" stand for</page><page sequence="24">410 ETHOS deeds or works. An arguable implication of the word "fruit" is that a person's deeds should, like fruit, nurture society. Evidently, rather than nourishing the Samoan social cosmos, centipede-like Samoans poison it.37 The song also hastens to add that these centipede types are smooth characters, who-like Satan-appear to be smart. But ac- tually, just as they have the appearance, but lack the substance, of nobility, so, also, they pretend to intellect rather than exemplify it. Rather than being smart (poto), they arefiapoto (pretending to smart- ness), for the song will later inform us that the logical consequences of their actions are most unpleasant. Thus, in relation to intellect the centipede's real nature, again, turns out to be in diametrical op- position to its appearance. FA'ALA TA This repeated lack of congruence between the centipede's manner and his character is meant to indicate that he stands for more than mere barbarity; he also represents duplicity. In Samoan terms this means that he isfa'alata. Fa'alata is derived from the word latalata, which means "near." The prefixfa'a means "to make" or "to do." Fa'alata, therefore, means "to make someone come near" or "to lure." "Fa'alata lefuia i le esi" is a traditional proverb which means "Thefuia bird is lured by the papaya."38 When applied to humans the wordfa'alata refers to the capturing of affection.39 Samoans say that the child, like a small animal, must initially be lured or tamed (lata). Chief Lei'ataua was an adopted son. His foster father wanted the boy, Vaiao, to become attached to him, so he wasfa'alata to Vaiao. He gave the boy whatever he de- sired and saw to it that his natural children did the same. While "Fa'alata le pua'a" means "To tame a pig," the parallel sentence, "Fa'alata mai si ou atali'i," means "To lure a son," as the Lei'ataua's adopted father did. Most commonly, however, the word fa'alata is translated as "to betray." Judas Iscariot is known in Sa- moa as "luta Le Fa'alata," literally "Judas the Betrayer."40 As a form of betrayal the word refers to someone who treats you with deference, but for an ulterior motive. Thus, a child who is friendly with another because the other child has some food is fa'alata. Fa'alata persons assume a pleasant manner, but do not sincerely respect the object of their ministrations, and will often act to hurt the other, through gossip perhaps, or even through more di-</page><page sequence="25">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 411 rect means, if they get the chance. A boy who lures a girl through respectful treatment, the giving of gifts, and so forth, and, when he has secured her, brags about it to his friends, is very fa'alata. He has played a part that does not reflect the verities of his subjective self. Fa'alata is a common term in Samoan parlance because role playing is an integral element in Samoan personhood. Samoans are extremely social in orientation. Samoan identity is, therefore, based on the persona rather than the ego.41 The ego, as a form of identity, focuses attention on the actor as separate and distinct from others (Freud 1961:13-14). The persona, like the dramatis personae from which the word derives, means both a mask and the role implied by the mask (Hobbes 1950:133-134;Jung 1966:156-159). It focuses on the actor's place in the ongoing social drama as a means of identi- fication and, thus, is communal in nature. As their identities are role-based, Samoans have definite ideas about their roles vis-a-vis other people and believe that one must, above all else, play the appropriate part. However, this penchant for social acting does not necessarily mean that behavior is insincere. Samoans recognize that, given the authoritarian rigors of their own society, sometimes one must play a role that belies inner feelings. However, ideally, one's emotions are aligned with one's role. If an inauthentic representation of the self is understandable under cer- tain circumstances, the Machiavellian exploitation of role playing is as disreputable in Samoa as in Western society. Nonetheless, the fact that the individual is acting provides distance on emotion. It is this distance that those who are fa'alata-the centipede being the case in point-are wont to exploit.42 The implication of the song is that the atualoa type plays the tamdli'i role but is, in fact, doing so out of base motives. In short, his behavior, although cloaked in a tamdli'i style, is no true expression of that respect for relationships that it is meant to express, and which is the very sig- nature of the Fa'aSdmoa. The song's equation for evil is: a tamdli'i manner plus a tifanua nature equals Satan.43 If the centipede's deceptive ways make him kin to Satan, it must be admitted that his fa'alata approach provides a mediation be- tween the disparate norms that beset the Samoan self. In Samoa there are really two ethoses.44 The predicated attitude between 'diga is respect, expressed in the phrase "Teu le vd." Respect im-</page><page sequence="26">412 ETHOS plies putting the other family first. In relation to one's own 'diga, the attitude assumed is that of loyalty. Loyalty spurs the individual to forwarding the concerns of his or her family above those of other families, in a word, competition. The word for competition in Sa- moan is tauva, which literally means "war between." Thus these two postures, to "teu le va" and to "tauvd," are precisely antithetical. The centipede type's success lies in his ability to persuade you that he is giving respect to your 'diga, when actually he is putting the bite on you and yours for the greater good of his own. ANALYSIS: LINES 7-8 'A o'o mai le i'uga, 'Ua susunu i le aft. But when the end comes, He will be burnt in the fire. The early mariners attest that Samoa once bore at least a resem- blance to our fantasies of The Garden. Unlike Eden, however, most of the Samoan islands lack snakes. Therefore, Satan's Samoan rep- resentative is the centipede. The song is an attempted exorcism. The tamdli'i centipede-apparently gentlemanly, fundamentally sav- age-stands for a worm at the heart of social being and for a wild and raw element hidden within it. The last line, therefore, tries to cook the atualoa in the fires of hell. Susunu-the term used to describe the centipede's future incineration-is today most commonly em- ployed for the burning of trash, but is also used to describe the prep- aration of certain foods. For example, Samoans say " 'Ua susunu le pua'a," meaning "The pig is scorched." Unfortunately, the centipede's scorching comes at "the end." I'uga connotes a logical consequence, a final outcome, and an un- avoidable fate. This reference to futurity in the song's final line is an indirect admission that the Samoan centipede type is, like Satan, prince of the present. In this sense the centipede, while lacking the nature of the ali'i, seems to have appropriated not only the ali'i's manner, but also the ali'i's place. Throughout, the song is attempting to correct a chronic imbal- ance in the Samoan social cosmos. Like the Samoan moral princi- ples it articulates, the song puts down the social actor who is, in fact, all too often one-up. Samoa is, above all else, a politically oriented</page><page sequence="27">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 413 society. Those who learn to use the false tamdli'i manners of the centipede type to manipulate various parties to their advantage may be condemned in verse, but they are likely to succeed in reality. This tilting of the scales ofjustice is both ancient and modern. Therefore, fathoming it requires a brief investigation of the problem of cen- tipedes in Samoan history and in Samoa today. YESTERDAY Originally, 'diga were ruled by their ali'i, who were hereditary chiefs (Kirch 1984). During the course of Samoan prehistory, how- ever, a new and distinctly Samoan type of chief began to appear, the tuldfale or talking chief.45 The tuldfale role was to represent the chief in the making of treaties and in the negotiations between districts (Gilson 1970:56). Acting in this administrative capacity was origi- nally conceived of as "talking" for the chief, and this the new species of chief did also. In any formal ceremony, being spoken for by a tu- ldfale became the prerequisite of dignity. The tuldfale ensured the dignity of the occasion by knowing the fa'alupega (village-specific titles) and genealogy of all those who were to participate in the ceremony and by addressing each with appropriate courtesy and homage. By displaying their ability to art- fully pay respect, tuldfale won it for their ali'i. By slanting geneal- ogies and ancient tales for their ali'i's benefit, the tuldfale aug- mented the ali'i's status. The Keesings say of the tuldfale, "Delib- erate manipulation by orators .. . of information to the advantage of their chiefs and adherent groups approaches the character of being a norm" (Keesing and Keesing [1956]1973:102). The tuldfale's machinations, normative though they may have been, were not always employed for the benefit of the ali'i but, sometimes, to further their own power, wealth, and prestige and that of their close relatives. Just as in Nietzsche's genealogy of Greek morals ([1887] 1967), in Samoa, persons of guile and craft began to replace those who originally represented nobility. Shore draws the distinction: The more highly ranked ali'i are sa'o which literally means "straight one" or "correct one," while orators are described (although never formally or publicly) as pi'opi'o "devious/meandering" and kuluku (from the English "crooked"). As one informant volunteered, "If a tuldfale isn't crooked, he isn't a good orator." By "crooked" is meant "cunning" or skillfully manipulative and orators are generally held to be not simply the repositories of genealogical and historical knowledge, but</page><page sequence="28">414 ETHOS par excellence the professional manipulators of tradition with an eye to local or self interest. [1977:437] Through "talking" for the chief, the political power of the tuldfale gradually increased, while the power of the ali'i was tempered. Eventually the new chiefs gained independence from the ali'i and began to rival them in power. Writing of Western Samoa, J. W. Davidson says that the tuldfale "constituted the dominant influence in Samoan politics at the higher levels. [G]roups of orators manip- ulated the elections to the most important chiefly titles and ... [t]heir political influence was constant and pervasive" (1967:26- 27). While the great ali'i had political sway in times of war, the orator groups called Tumua and Pule controlled Samoan politics under normal conditions (J. W. Davidson 1967:176). It should be added, however, that certain tuldfale families were reported to have special access to the war deities and the oracular power to consult them (Williamson [1924] 1967:110; Gilson 1970:56; Henry 1983:46, 95). Therefore, through divination, even in war the tuldfale might sidestep the preemptory powers of the ali'i. There is an old saying that the wealth of the ali'i decays into the hands of the tuldfale, "0 mea a ali'i e pala 'i le tuldfale." Political power in Samoa has likewise decayed.46 Brother Herman says that the tuldfale are "the real rulers of the family and the village" ([1944] 1954:13). [H]e is respected for he is the guardian of tradition and the manager of public pol- icy. On him devolves the administration of justice and the government of the vil- lage .... The high chief has really little authority in municipal affairs; it is the or- ators who are the real rulers .... The mutual relationship between chiefs and or- ators is a difficult one. The orators have authority over the chiefs and discuss their affairs freely in accordance with the peculiar social organization. The chief will never refuse what is required by his orator. [Herman (1944) 1954:14-16] Robert Louis Stevenson, when writing of the relationship between the ali'i and the tuldfale, describes the ali'i as a "gagged audience" (1892:3-4). Perhaps both Herman's and Stevenson's statements are a bit ex- treme. In fact, the relative power of chiefs and orators differed, de- pending on the historical circumstances and the personalities in- volved. However, in many cases the ali'i retained their titular po- sition but lost its substance. At feasts they kept the place of honor but lost much of the claim to the oral satisfaction that once accom- panied it.</page><page sequence="29">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 415 At a public dinner the high chief will be served with everything that is best, but custom forbids him to eat too much or to tarry over his meal.... He will not only eat sparingly but leave the best morsels for his talking chief. [Stevenson 1892:16] One of Shore's informants, an elderly lady form Savai'i, chuckled as she told him about the division of the pig at a feast, "The part that has all the meat [dalaga], that goes to the tildfale. The bone, the tuala, that's very thin and hardly has any meat on it. But we take it to the ali'i" (1977:448). I certainly do not mean to imply that every tuldfale is a centipede. After all, it is the talking chief, beyond all others, who has made an art of respect. Furthermore, this Samoan style of social improbity- assuming a pleasing and flattering manner, especially in speech, es- pecially for the purpose of social manipulation-is employed by many besides those with a tuldfale title. Nonetheless, it was the tuld- fale who opened the opportunity for politic wheeling and dealing for personal gain.47 TODAY Samoans, like all of us who are modern or becoming so, are full of laments for bygone simplicity and virtue. An example of such a lament about the all-too-successful centipedes is Albert Wendt's Pouliuli. In Wendt's tale the protagonist, Faleasa Osovae, is a per- sonification of Samoan culture. Like the culture for which he stands, Faleasa has one noble and fearless son, who has more brawn than brains. He has the personality of the toa, with all the loyalty and heroism which that implied in ancient Samoa. This tamdli'i son is aptly called Moaula, "Red Chicken." 'Ula (red) is a royal color in Samoa.48 Red feathers were relatively rare and were used to deco- rate the finest mats. The most sacred of all faletele was called the Fale'ula (literally, "Red House"), which some say had a roof of bril- liant red parrot feathers (Shore 1977:434-435n).49 Furthermore, throughout Polynesian lore, the color red is the mark of the sacred chief (Luomala [1955] 1986:139-158). Faleasa, also like Samoan culture, has a second son who is dis- loyal, intelligent, and politically crafty. He has the personality which Samoans call kuluku or pi'opi'o and which Shore links to the tuldfale (1977:437). This son's name is Elefane, meaning "Ele- phant." One might surmise his name has to do with a lack of oral restraint.</page><page sequence="30">416 ETHOS Faleasa does his best to see that his title, and the political power that goes with it, is conferred on Moaula. However, Moaula fights bravely when he would have done better to think deeply. Faleasa's political enemies bring a shotgun and attack him. Fearless Moaula single-handedly assaults them with a bushknife, kills two men, and is sentenced to life imprisonment. In consequence, despite Faleasa's efforts, Elefane secures the title. When the old chief-his efforts foiled-goes mad, his closest friend grieves: Look at you now, my friend. Just gristle and suffering and weeping sores. We lost out a long time ago, my beloved friend. The new world is for creatures like . . . Elefane; they're everywhere because they're of the times.... Sleep on, my most precious friend, safe in the embrace of Pouliuli, the Great Darkness out of which we came and to which we must all return. . . . [Wendt 1983:14] In the new Samoa one finds creatures like the cunning centipede in the dark interstices of government, influencing much, taking what they can. Their voracious appetite for power, for privilege, and for money is the favorite subject of modern Samoan journalism.50 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THINGS ORAL IN SAMOA First, our toothy centipede appears as ferocious, but is revealed to be a coward. Next, he appears wearing a winsome smile, yet we discover he is false. These shifting images refer to the series of sym- bolic equations through which Samoans construct the concept of perfidy. These equations are complex but may be synopsized as fol- lows: Integrity is illustrated by oral restraint. Oral restraint in turn indicates the subordination of the subjective self, with all its selfish urges, to the interests and values of the community. Moral turpitude is shown by oral aggressiveness, which represents a lack of this sub- ordination and, therefore, the dominance of personalistic elements in speech and behavior. Evil, in Samoa, mediates between the two through the mechanism of betrayal. The Samoan incarnation of Sa- tan wears the mantle of communal virtue over the fact of selfish con- cern. This set of associations is first established in childhood through practices that aim at the eradication of the subjective self. As a re- sult, adults seldom appear to be self-seeking and are careful to ap- pear deferential and cooperative. These latter characteristics have, in fact, long been seen as typifying Samoan character by ethnogra- phers. For example, Lowell Holmes conducted personality tests</page><page sequence="31">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 417 which showed that Samoans have strong tendencies toward abase- ment, toward doing what is expected, and toward accepting the leadership of others (1987:133). However, this appearance is not comprehensive, for while it describes the tamdli'i Samoan, it fails to take into account both the cheeky opposite and the poisonous in- version of this cultural ideal. All three are essential to an under- standing of the dynamics of Samoan social reality. NOTES Acknowledgments. I would like to thank Judge Joseph Rees, Jill Makagon, and Caroline B. Crenna for their editorial advice. I thank John Kneubuhl, Chief Lei'ataua Vaio Ala'ilima, Chief Lesa Fa'asisina Ropeti, Loretta Tarrant, Ruth Uelese, Ave Sualoa, Ameko Pato, and all my Samoan students, friends, and relatives for their contributions to my understanding of the Fa'aSdmoa. And most especially I thank my husband Sanele Mageo for his invaluable contributions throughout. 'See, for example, Gerber (1975:38-39, 93). Howard and Kirkpatrick (1989) suggest that the regular sharing of food is the most important index of relationship throughout Polynesia. 2There are two traditions as to how Malietoa Vainu'up6 (the last Tafa'ija) attained his position. See Meleisea and Meleisea (1987:74). 3Abnormal behavior, too, is a matter of speech in Samoa. Thus Shore points out that the primary feature of Samoan spirit possession is "speaking in a voice not one's own" (1978:177). "The Beagleholes attribute Maori generosity, friendliness, and cooperativeness to this in- security (1946:143-144). James Ritchie later attributes fear of social isolation and rejection, as well as attempts to mediate this loss through a heightened attentiveness to social signaling, to this transition. However, more recently Jane and James Ritchie argue that these conse- quences are mitigated by other factors (1979, 1989). As evidence for the Beagleholes' and James Ritchie's ideas about the consequences of this transition, one might look to the trans-Polynesian tales of Tahaki and Rata. For accounts see Luomala ([1955] 1986). These two figures are archetypal Polynesian heroes and models of noble conduct. The stories concerning both figures involve a loss of their parents at an early age. When the heroes approach adulthood, each rescues his parents from degradation or death or both and regains their love. Psychologically, this scenario could be seen as a metaphor for the Polynesian child's belief that, when care is turned over to a sibling, it has "lost" parental love. The legend is also a wish-fulfillment fantasy for regaining that love through deeds that command a recognition of the child's worth (and, thus, right to be loved). The tale also indicates that a drive for personal recognition results from this loss. In Samoa this need for recognition is expressed in a quest for titles. 5This translation was done jointly by my husband, Sanele Mageo, and myself, with assis- tance from Judge Joseph Rees. One reviewer questioned our rendering of the line "E tamdli'i le ttifanua," suggesting that the line is actually sung as "Tamdli'i Ie ttfanua." In fact the line is sometimes sung without the "E" and sometimes with it, and its absence or presence does not change the meaning of the line. However, "li" is the negative in Samoan and, in this respect, the reviewer's version of the line would substantially change its meaning. The reviewer suggested that the line really meant "Noblemen are not low-lifes." My Samoan husband and I very much disagree with this transcription of the line. First,</page><page sequence="32">418 ETHOS the sentence "Tamdli'i le tuifanua" does not make much sense in Samoan. Second, my hus- band has both heard and sung this song since childhood and both he and his mother render the song as given in the text. Finally, in order to be entirely objective, I conducted a fresh series of interviews after receiving the reviewer's comments. I would approach a Samoan I knew to be fluent in English and Samoan. I would then ask them to write down the song, adding all vowel markers. Samoans sometimes leave out the vowel markers that linguists and anthropologists use for clarity in pronunciation. However, they seldom leave out a marker that would make the meaning of a sentence unclear. All my interviewees wrote down the song without the long vowel marker. Nonetheless, to be abso- lutely sure of their meaning, I pointed to the "le" in question and asked the informant if the line should be translated as "the" tiifanua or "not" tifanua. All my informants said "the" tui- fanua. The Samoan head of the English Department at American Samoa Community College (Chief Lesa Fa'asisina Ropeti) put it even more precisely. "It is the article, not the negative," he said. He also reported that the song was written in his village, Satitoa, in Aleipata Western Samoa when his grandfather had the Lesa title, around 1953 or 1954. The song was composed during a religious controversy by the song master and composer Talitimu of Savai'i. Lesa further explained that the line meant that the tufanua tries to appear like the ali'i but is not successful. 6In Samoan legend, creatures who are half-human and half-demonic are also characterized by voracious appetites. For example, Tinilau and Sina are a kind of Samoan Romeo and Ju- liet. In many versions of their tale, Sina is blamed for a crime committed by one of Tinilau's other wives, who is half-demonic. This wife eats nine baskets of fish, which had been caught by the village, including the baskets and the leaf sweep upon which they sat, and blames the theft on Sina (Luomala [1955] 1986:109-110). 7The word ta'a often has sexual connotations. Ta'a can refer to a sweetheart. "Mdnaia lau ta'a" means "Your sweetheart looks good." Faita'aga (literally, "to make ta'a") can be glossed as "fornication." 8Shore renders this phrase as "Fai le dmio," but it would normally be said more simply as just "Fai dmio." 9 Oka Oka La'u Hani Oka, Oka, la 'u Hani, la'u Hanifa 'asilisili.

Having an affair is unworthy, it is Satan's thing, You might get a baby, a baby of the night. Oh, oh, my heart, my heart is weak; My innards turn to juice. Carry me to the hospital, the medicine is no use, Having seen love is the cause. Hellaby is the corn beef referred to in the song's third line. This song was originally tran- scribed by Brother Herman in an unpublished collection made in 1939 and is currently stored in the Pacific Collection at the American Samoa Community College library. However, slight corrections have been made in light of Ueta Solomora's 1973 transcription, which is stored in the Museum of American Samoa. My husband, Sanele Mageo, and myself have supplied the translation. Like Taufe'ai le Atualoa, the song is a common taualuga melody and often heard. For further examples of Samoan songs in which the pleasure of eating and lovemaking are equated see Mageo (1988:47-48, 1989:197). In traditional courtship, similar symbolism pre- vailed. The girl signaled her acceptance of a suitor through the taking of his food gift. See, for example, Kraemer ([1902] 1978:36) and Moyle (1981:121-123). '?Tautalaiti is the plural form of tautalaitiiti. Mead also notes that Samoans refer to preco- cious sexual behavior as tautalaitiiti. See, further, Mead ([1928] 1961:88, 137, 140). llWhen someone makes a sigo gesture, Samoans are apt to say "A fa'apend uma muli o moa oute le toefia'ai moa." This means "If the chicken's behind was like that I would never want to eat a chicken." From a structuralist perspective this sentence makes a binary contrast be- tween those whose behavior is highly palatable to the community (the moa type) and those whose behavior is socially indigestible (the taufe'ai type). 12Mead reports weaning between 15 and 20 months after birth ([1930] 1969:90), Schoeffel, at 14 to 15 months of age (1979:126). Mead says that care by the child nurse begins at six or seven months ([1928] 1961:22). Schoeffel says that in the traditional Samoan house, the baby required constant supervision by other children after about six months of age. Infants were often left on mats which covered a pebbled floor. They dug up and ate the pebbles if not watched (Schoeffel 1979:102). Sutter places care by the older sibling as beginning at the age of two (1980:31). "3In general, the Polynesian infant's personal desires are catered to and indulged (Ritchie and Ritchie 1979). There are, however, prescribed exceptions to this rule in Samoa. From time to time Samoans purposefully leave an infant to cry "because it will make the child strong." 14The same idiom is used in Tahiti, where the child undergoes a similar transition. Thus the Tahitian word fa'aro'o, like fa'alogo, means both "to listen" and "to obey." "L" in Samoan is cognate with "r" in Tahitian; the "g" is replaced by a glottal stop. See Levy (1973:449). The linguist Elinor Ochs (1982) characterizes this shift-from the child's being listened to, to the child's "listening"-in illuminating terms. In Western parent-child communication, Ochs says, parents de-center, trying to interpret the intention of the child's verbal utterances and to respond appropriately. While Samoan parents will, initially, try to interpret and re- spond to the infant's inarticulate needs, once the child becomes verbal, they insist that the child de-center. Samoan parents ignore the child's nonsensical utterances and instruct the child to imitate parental utterances. "sSutter believes that the "unpredictable, frequent, and often arbitrary orders" that replace the indulgences of infancy are aimed at breaking the child's "individually oriented will" and</page><page sequence="34">420 ETHOS encouraging group identification (Sutter 1980:31). Again, the term for "will," as well as for the whole inner world of the subject, is loto. For a fuller characterization of the term loto, and Samoan attitudes towards it, see Mageo (1989). 16In Wendt's Pouliuli the protagonist is a middle-aged matai named Faleasa. At the opening of the tale he experiences an illumination in which he realizes that "For seventy-six years I ... was easy meat for all the cannibals; and the worst, the most rapacious of all, were my own aiga and village" (Wendt 1977:17). What Faleasa means is that his family and village, before his renunciation of them, had been nurtured by his sacrifice of his personal self to the group. 17Both fa'ali'i and fiafa'ali'i mean "to be willful" or "headstrong," or "to throw a tan- trum." Parents consider tears and tantrums as symptoms of willfulness and, therefore, as a protest against carrying out their dictates. l8Because relative physical elevation is a Polynesian metaphor for relative social elevation, Samoan children are not allowed to address seated elders while standing but must sit down themselves and bow, so that their head is beneath that of their superior. If elders are sitting and young people walk before them, the youngsters will say "Tulou." 19For children, the most special day of the year is White Sunday. White Sunday is a day of reversal, for on this day parents serve their children rather than vice versa. The family goes to church and the children, rather than sitting quietly as usual, give little speeches out of the Bible while their parents listen. White Sunday is, in Bateson's terms, a safety valve for a com- plementary schismogenesis between Samoan parents and children. See, further, Bateson (1958:193). See, also, Shore on complementary schismogenesis in Samoa (1982:193-220). Likewise, in the dance, children are allowed to show off and to call attention to themselves (Mead [1928] 1961:110-121). Making noise is very much a part of the event, especially for boys. Boys will punctuate dancing with loud shouts of "Schohohoo!" and everyone enjoys both the show and the commotion. 20Gutuoso andfiafa'ali'i are both tautalaiti behaviors. 21Coincidentally, the child's name (Sasa) is the word for beat. Adults are treated as chil- dren vis-a-vis their parents. Freeman tells a tale of a 30-year-old daughter who is beaten for her tautalaitiiti attitude. An extreme case of this occurred on a Sunday in March 1967, when a 54-year-old talking chief began beating his 30-year-old daughter because she had not obeyed his instruction to have food ready at the close of the afternoon church service. So severe was this beating that others of the family intervened to lead the father away, while his daughter, who was in an advanced stage of pregnancy (she gave birth to her seventh child some twelve days later) wailed aloud in distress. The response of her 54-year-old mother was to shout at her daugh- ter, just as though she were still a child: "Have done! Have done! Don't open your mouth so!" [Freeman 1983:209] 22According to Klein (1984), children also project their desire to eat the mother onto her. These projections can be seen in children's tales in the figures of cannibalistic stepmothers and witches. Thus, Snow White's stepmother wants to eat her stepdaughter's heart. Hansel and Gretel's witch intends to eat Hansel. See, further, Bettelheim (1977). Inasmuch as the mother is our first "Other," our experience with her is a prototype for later experiences. Therefore, intensifying this projection through child-rearing practices might well lead, as Er- ikson suggests ([1950] 1963), to difficulties with trust. For examples of Samoan tales with mother figures who are also ogresses, see Moyle (1981) or Kraemer ([1923] 1949:51). 23The chicken, in cock fights, represents a form of aggression that has been brought under control and functions in the service of humankind, unlike that of the centipede. For another example of the chicken as a Samoan symbol of bravery, see Sio (1984:46-47).</page><page sequence="35">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 421 24In Samoan jokes, the several significances of the word moa may be confounded. For ex- ample, in one joke a boy comes to school after having been absent and, when asked for an excuse, tells his palagi (Caucasian) teacher that "My chicken was hurting." Offended by the apparently absurd answer, she sends him to the principal, who scolds the boy for being cheeky. The boy says, "I'm sorry sir, but how do I tell her 'Na tigd lo'u moa.' " Literally, this phrase means "I had a pain in my moa." The principal sits and thinks, finally replying, "You better tell her you had a sick chicken." I originally heard this joke from Dr. Paul Cox. One legend associates the origins of the name Samoa with this quasi-organ. In the tale, the highest Samoan god, Tagaloalagi, notices a pregnant woman. The movement of the child in her womb causes a rippling on her belly in the area of her moa while she sleeps. Tagaloalagi tells her to name the child Moa. The day the baby is born a spirit appears and reminds the parents of Tagaloalagi's words. At midnight the cocks crow and are named moa along with the boy. The couple is further instructed to bathe the child in a pool, which is then called Sd moa, "Sacred to Moa." Moa becomes the first Tui Manu'a (Sio 1984:1-3). In another tradi- tion the name comes from birthing problems of one of the children of Night and Day. Initially the child could not be born because he was Sd-tia-i-le-moa, that is, "Restricted in the moa" (Fraser 1891:271). 25Charles Ala'ilima, a Samoan lawyer and formerjudge in American Samoa, has suggested that the present-day disintegration of Samoan culture can be seen in the decay of the malae as a village center. Today individual householders often build up in the mountains, rather than down around the malae. They do so in order to escape the sway of the village and the chiefs. When one lives around the malae, everyone knows what you are doing and the mores of the village are strongly felt. 26Shore presents a model of the Samoan village (1977:30-32, 1982:48-51). Its center is the malae and is symbolically affiliated with high culture. Its periphery falls off into the bush and the sea and is associated with nature and profane behavior. Shore, however, does not argue that these centers are symbols of the relationship between families and, thus, spatial icons for the culture and its name. 27See, further, Mageo (1988:55-56) on the representative nature of individual Samoans in interactions with nonrelatives. 28For further information about these spirits see Mead (1929:269), Goodman (1971:470- 471), Holmes (1974:63), Cain (1979:229-241). For another example of the sacred character of the malae in ancient Samoa, see Fa'aSamoa Pea (1982:44-45). 29Goodman, in his account of the spirit Letelesa, mentions a similar motif (1971:470-471). 30In Wendt's Pouliuli, the central mystical symbol of the novel (which I believe to be Wendt's icon for Samoan culture) is a ring of white stones, with a black stone in the center. 31Shore believes that this saying is a "clue to the Samoan notion of the person" (1982:136). 32Because the vd between families is symbolically celebrated in the 'Ava ceremony, and because this relationship is the essence of the Fa'aSdmoa, the performance of this ceremony was considered highly propitious. A certain type of 'Ava ceremony was conducted whenever ill fortune befell the community from without and whenever antisocial behavior threatened it from within (Mead [1930] 1969:109). 33For example, Holmes (1967:107-118) tells us that when the assembled chiefs look to see if the kava has sufficient water, it is called "sila alofi," literally, "Watch the kava." 34The spinning top is also called a moa, as it is a circulation around a center. One of my informants, John Kneubuhl, in a talk he gave for one of my Samoan Studies classes, charac- terized the social pattern of the 'Ava ceremony as a circulation around a center in a more or less circular hut where the social weight of the person occupying this post is balanced by the social weight of the person occupying the post directly opposite him on the other side of the hut's periphery. In an 'ava ceremony the order of the cup-service begins</page><page sequence="36">422 ETHOS at the top of the social scale, moves down and out, and then curves back again to end at the top where it began-a roughly circular set of social gestures. In this talk Kneubuhl also pointed to the symbolic significance of the use of the word alofi in the 'ava ceremony. He translates aloft as an "arch," and says that the ceremony begins with the joining of two arches to form a circle. 35Another possible interpretation of the name Samoa is "Family of Moa," for a sd can also be a family. See, for example, Fraser (1892:265) where Fraser refers to the family of the god Tagaloa as Sa Tagaloa. There are many such examples. The family of the historical figure Levalasi is called SaLevalasi (Henry 1980:94). Samoa would then have been named after a central family and its descendants, possibly the family of the Tui Manu'a mentioned in Note 24. See, further, Fraser (1891:116, 133-138). Although this interpretation of the word is also highly credible, it is historical rather than symbolic. As a different order of explanation, it does not conflict with my own. Kraemer attempts to unite the "sacred chickens" account with the "family of Moa" account ([1902] 1978:8-9). 36In order to test my reasoning here, I asked my Samoan students, "What is the opposite of taufe'ai?" They said, "Fflemu, " which means calm and passive. I then asked them, "Who typically behaves in this manner in Samoa?" They said, "The ali'i." I said, "And what is the word for the way in which the ali'i acts?" They said, "Fa'atama-li'i." For an excellent example of these manners, see Shore (1977:436). 37For another example of this particular oral motif in the depiction of evil in Samoa, see Shore (1982:27-28). 38Such luring was a kingly sport in ancient Samoa. Today one of the favorite digs of ar- chaeologists are the star-shaped mounds that high-status Samoans used for this enterprise. See, further, Janet Davidson (1974:225-244). 39Boys and girls, when they desire a relationship, may say "Fa'alatalata mai lou agdga," which means "Make your spirit closer." 4?To test my reasoning here I asked my Samoan students, "Who acts in a tamdli'i style but is really tzfanua?" They said, "Politicians," "television evangelists," and "Judas." Then I asked for another Samoan word for Judas. They said, "Le Fa'alata." 41For a more lengthy argument concerning the persona and identity in Samoa, see Mageo (1989). 42The suspicion that respectful behavior isfa'alata is very common. In Samoan cosmology, suspicion is generated at the same time as humankind, evolving along with heart, will (loto), and spirit. These four qualities are further said to be the source of human intelligence (Mead [1930] 1969:156-161). 43Like the centipede, Satan himself is conceived of as taufe'ai. One of the major yearly events in American Samoa is an annual long-boat (fautasi) race. Many of the villages in Tu- tuila, and sometimes in Western Samoa as well, sponsor a boat. In 1988 a boat called Satani won. Its supporters composed and chanted this limerick after the race: Au 'oi 'aua le so'onafai Leaga 'o Satani e taufe'ai. Oh don't overdo it Because Satan is taufe'ai. 44See, further, Shore (1977, 1982) on "complementary" and "symmetrical" relations in Samoa. '5John Kneubuhl, an informant mentioned earlier (Note 34), believes that tuldfale were originally the toa (warriors) affiliated with ali'i. This might explain why certain tuldfale fam- ilies had special access to war deities. Thus Gilson (1970:56) notes that "leading tuldfale of</page><page sequence="37">EATING AND SPEAKING IN SAMOA 423 Safata, together with Li'o of Si'umu, were once thought to have oracular powers to consult the war gods." The only deity worshiped by all Samoa was Nafanua (Stair 1897:220), who was a war goddess. She was said to reside with the Tonumaipe'a family in Savai'i. The Tonu- maipe'a title is an orator's title. It might be added that the first paramount ruler of Western Samoa was a high-born lady named Salamasina. Salamasina became the Tafa'ifj (monarch) because she was given all the pdpd (paramount titles) by Nafanua. Nafanua had appropriated these titles through the military services of the Sa Tonumaipe'a (Henry 1983:47-52). In his dissertation, Shore relates a Manu'an legend concerning the origin of tuldfale titles. The legend implies that originally tuldfale were toa of the ali'i. In the legend a group of men were sent to regain the Fale'ula (a famous red house, see Note 49), which had been stolen by the Atuafu-mea people of Tokelau. Purportedly, these warriors swam back to Manu'a with the poles of the house resting on their necks and were named for this fact. In this legend tuldfale is said to be short for ttlaga-o-le-fale, that is, "resting place of the house" (Shore 1977:434- 435n). However, if talking chiefs were once toa, they soon became a distinct class of chiefs, one that was more closely associated with manipulation of a political and verbal nature than with war- fare, per se. Even during Salamasina's time (the 16th century), tulafale were feared primarily for their machinations. Notably, like the centipede, the more famous tuladfale often carried out their political intrigues through assassination by poison. (See Henry 1983:63,67-68.) Indeed, sometimes when these poisonings occurred, they were, at least initially, attributed to the bite of a centipede (Kraemer [1923] 1949:28-29, 34-38, 74). Goldman (1970:259) points out that the qualities of the Samoan toa were "simply aspects of being a chief, of being a mature male." Indeed, identity as a warrior was often part of the ali'i's title. For example, the last Tafa'ija (paramount chief) of Samoa held the Malietoa title. The term Malietoa, that is, malie toa, means "pleasing" warrior (Stair 1897:241). In Samoa the role of the toa was a definitive element of the institution of the 'aumaga. In traditional Samoa, chiefs of stature had an 'aumaga. Thus, Malietoa's henchmen are the Sal- elesi. For another interesting example, see Stair (1897:81). Normally a chief's 'aumdga con- sisted of all the taulele'a (untitled young men) of the 'diga or of the village over which the chief in question held sovereignty. One of the most important of the 'aumdga's functions was to serve as a standing army. The ali'i's son, the manaia, was the titular head of this organi- zation (Mead [1930] 1969:10). The social identity of the taule'ale'a (singular for taulele'a) lay in their membership in the 'aumdga (Mead [1930] 1969:92; Gilson 1970:73; J. W. Davidson 1967:18; Holmes 1987:42). Today the 'aumdga no longer functions as an army, but merely as a village police force. How- ever, despite its illegality, chiefs still tend to use their village 'aumdga in hostilities between villages. In any case, as this group once functioned as an army, the personality type associated with it, and therefore predicated for its members, is that of the toa. Toa is still a commonly used term today and refers to someone who is strong, brave, and loyal to his 'diga and matai, that is, to someone bearing the qualities of a retainer. In this sense, the figure of the warrior re- mained affiliated with the chief in Samoa, and the qualities of the toa remained those of his adherents. The subtle, dissimulative tuldfale represents an antipode to the direct manners and tactics of the toa. 4See Stair (1897:70-71) and Meleisea and Meleisea (1987:32) for further evidence. See Shore (1977:439-444) on the shift of political power to the tulafale. There is evidence that oratory is a focal element in the political equations of Polynesian societies in general. See the subsection entitled "Unity through Consensus" in Ritchie and Ritchie (1989). Machiavelli- anism represents a potential inherent in the persona-type personality, just as the crass ego- centrism of the gangster represents the negative potentiality of the ego.</page><page sequence="38">424 ETHOS 47Samoans themselves have been known to refer to the tulafale as a "Machiavelli." See, for example, the quote of Napoleoni Tuileteleapaga in Keesing and Keesing ([1956] 1973:41). Whatever the drawbacks of this machiavel, John Kneubuhl has suggested to me that the tu- lafale has been a democratizing force in Samoa. By draining and diffusing the traditional pow- ers of the ali'i, the tuldfale is responsible for the transfer of power to a wider group. I would also speculate that the political sophistication represented in the figure of the tuladfale had much to do with the fact that both Western and American Samoa have maintained a degree of political control and integrity which many other Polynesian societies have lost. Western Samoa is an independent country. American Samoa is an American territory. However, it is governed by local people of Samoan ancestry. The role of the American government is largely to fund this local government. See also Keesing and Keesing ([1956] 1973:42). 48I surmise that Moaula's name refers to "chicken" rather than to "center," as Wendt sets up a polarity between Elefane and Moaula. The evil son is named after one kind of animal; it would then be logical for the good son to be named after another. Actually 'ula with the glottal stop means "red"; without the glottal stop the word means "to tease." However, in the passage on page 10, on page 23, and in Note 16, the reader will notice that, like many modern Samoan writers, Wendt deletes all glottal stops. Thus, "red chicken" is as possible a meaning as "teasing chicken" and, inasmuch as Moaula is a serious young man, more likely. 49The Fale'ula was originally the palace of the Samoan gods (Powell and Pratt 1891:107, 113). For other explanations of the name of the Fale'ula, see Kraemer ([1923] 1949:54), Henry (1980:57), Schoeffel (1987:175), and Meleisea and Meleisea (1987:10). 50For specific examples I refer the reader to back issues of the Samoan Journal, the Samoa News, and the Observer, especially the column called "Tailo" in the Samoan Journal. The Observer is published in Apia. The Samoan Journal and the Samoa News are published in American Sa- moa, and back issues have been collected at the Feliti Library in downtown Fagatogo.
