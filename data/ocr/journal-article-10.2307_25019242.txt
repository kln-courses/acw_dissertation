<plain_text><page sequence="1">Calvinism and the Amyraut Heresy: Protestant Scholasticism and Human ism in Seventeenth-Century France. By Brian G. Armstrong. (Madi son: University of Wisconsin Press. 1969. Pp. xx, 330. $12.50.) The relations between Reformed theology, John Calvin, and Calvinism constitute a complex problem for the understanding of Protestant theology. The term "Reformed" customarily refers to the Reformation in Switzer land and its transplants in the Low Countries, Britain, and elsewhere. Calvin was not the founder of the movement but through the force of his theology and his churchmanship he assumed its leadership. After Calvin, it was often assumed that his writings were normative for Re formed thought, but in the half-century after his death the Reformed con fessions of faith were often at the center of the stage. In the interpretation of these confessions there developed variant forms of theology called "Calvinism." In later years, particularly in the twentieth century, Calvin himself has come to the fore, and it becomes a question as to how much the "Calvinists" reveal or distort the position of their master. Because</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 83 the Calvinism of the epigones usually made a big point of predestination, that doctrine stands at the center of the question. Brian G. Armstrong has made an extremely important contribution to the understanding of Calvin and Calvinism by investigating the theology of a French Calvinist, Mo?se Amyraut (Moses Amyraldus), who taught at Saumur from 1626 to 1664. Amyraut was accused of heresy because his doctrine of predestination did not agree with what Armstrong calls the "orthodoxy of international Calvinism," that is, the scholastic Calvinism of Theodore Beza, Franciscus Gomarus, and Pierre du Moulin, among others. Instead, he took his cue from the incipient covenant theology of John Cameron. It was assumed that he thereby deviated from Calvin. Armstrong sets out to show that he understood Calvin very well, used Calvin's writings copiously, and adhered to Calvin more faithfully than did the so-called orthodox Calvinists. He brings to this task careful and thorough use of sources and a lucid style. He finds the clue to Amyraut's thought in his use of Calvin's distinction between the hidden, absolute will of God (to save or to damn certain persons) and the revealed, conditional will of God (to save believers). Amyraut believed that the stress of the gospel is on the revealed will, expressed in anthropomorphic terms, and that the truth of the hidden will should be left in the background but without being eliminated. This way of getting past the predestinarian emphasis of orthodoxy, Armstrong suggests, is closely allied to Amyraut's Ramism. I would point out that this alliance is by no means clear. An earlier Reformed theologian, Jacobus Arminius, an ardent Ramist, denied the duality of wills. Furthermore, unless one is willing to settle for sheer paradox in theology, the doctrine of two wills creates as many problems as it solves. Granted the use of this theological device, however, Amyraut did well to stress the evangelical covenant over the absolute decree.
