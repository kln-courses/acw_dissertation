Düring August and September, 1993 approximately 250 Tzotzils were expelled from the Indian Community of San Juan Chamula, Chiapas, Mexico. In September, having lost their homes and lacking food and warm clothing, the exiles appealed to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) for humanitarian aid and an investigation of their situation. For the time being, the Tzotzils are staying in the auditorium and the patio of the Department of Indian Affairs of the State government of Chiapas in San Cristóbal de Las Casas. The majority of the expelled are women and children. In a document signed by Domingo López Angel, président of the Consejo de Represen tantes Indígenas de los Altos de Chiapas (Council of Indige nous Représentatives forthe Chiapas Highlands), an Organiza tion made up of several thousand expellees, the Catholic and Protestant Indians affected by the action State that, starting in the 1970s, "the caciques and authorities of San Juan Chamula began expelling people from their homes and lands for alleg edly religious reasons". In another document addressed to the regional représentatives of the UNHCR, the exiles report that Chamula authorities justified the expulsion of members of their Community on the grounds that the latter "act contrary to indigenous customs" e.g. by being sympathetic to political</page><page sequence="2">parties in opposition to the ruling PRI or by openly professing in our understanding of polychrome ceramics in regard both to their support for Protestant evangelism. The exiles testify that their function and use and to their areas of production.

The stelae were first taken to various locations in Guatemalan refugees. In so doing, he has roused the ire of Melchior de Meneos. About five years ago, all stelae that had Mexican civil authorities and thus increasingly embarrassed been brought to Melchior de Meneos were transferred to a the Catholic Church ' s hierarchy, which is eager to improve its small "Parque" of the Comisaria of the Instituto de Antropología newly restored relations with the govemment of Mexico. e Historia in "Barrio Suchitan" in the northern part of the city.

In addition to the stelae from rights groups, who are petitioning the Vatican to retain him in Naranjo, there is also an anthropomorphic statue of unknown his présent office.

Alarmed by such reports, the direc- irreplaceable monuments, tor of the German charitable Organization Misereor appealed recently to the Mexican président Sahnas de Gortari for the protection of Bishop Ruiz. The bishop's removal has not yet been officially an nounced, since the Vatican has been attempting to pressure Don Ruiz to relinquish his post voluntarily. The bishop was summoned to appear before the Apostolic Nuntius, Archbish op Prigione, who read him a letter from the Vatican ' s B ishops ' Congrégation (Don Ruiz' request for a copy was flatly reject ed). In the letter the Bishop of Chiapas, a former participant in the 2nd Vatican Council, was accused of having "a simplified view of the Gospels influenced by Marxism". Furthermore, unspecified charges of "errors" in his teaching, pastoral work, and administration of the diocese were levelled against him. Perhaps tellingly, the Mexican Bishops' Conference has so far limited its response to confirming the Pope's right to name, transfer, and remove bishops as he sees fit. Painting the Maya universe: Royal ceramics of the Classic Period DURHAM (D.Reents-Budet). Under the title "Painting the Maya universe: Royal ceramics of the Classic Period" an exhibition of almost a hundred polychrome Maya ceramics from the Classic Period will be shown at the Duke University Museum of Art between January 15 and March 27,1994. The exhibition has been designed and arranged by Dorie Reents Budet. It is the first exhibition that focuses on Maya poly- Fig. 1.

The Maya ruins of Itzan are located approximately 50 km by river to the west of Sayaxche, Peten, Guatemala, and 3 km north of the Cooperativa La Palma, near the PasionRiver. Itzan was first explored by Gair Tourtellot III, Norman Hammond and Richard M. Rose of the Peabody Museum in March of 1968. Their findings were published ten years later. The Peabody Museum field party recorded many carved stone monu ments with figural and textual images, most of them severe ly eroded and broken. Since 1968 Ian Graham of the Pea body Museum has visited the site a number of times and dis covered several more stelae. Until recently, 17 carved ste lae, 1 carved altar, 4 carved panels, and 2 hieroglyphic stairways were known from Itzan, the latter with a total of 343 glyph blocks. One of the most important of Graham's discoveries was Stela 17, an all-glyphic monument bear ing 156 glyph blocks (Al L13), broken unfortunately in more than a dozen fragments.
