Bio-political philosophy can today confront the perennial questions of philosophy in the light of a wide range of evidence from the natural sciences. Observation seems to verify that humans are normative animals; although this characteristic of our nature is often traced to ratio- nality, a reconsideration of Hume's critique in the light of biology suggests that the ultimate origin of our "normativeness" is far more primordial and less calculated. This suggests that the content of human value systems might be more constant and consistent than they at first appear. I bluntly contend that the Ten Commandments are an example of a moral regimen, not of how human believers can win salvation and eternal life, but rather of how human beings have thus far successfully guaranteed their earthly existence. In short, what we call our human normative systems spring from that same selective biology that sees us as the evolved creatures we are today. They are at one and the same time a cause and an effect of our human condition. The Science of human nature is, like all other sciences, reduced to a few clear points: there are not many certain truths in this world. ALEXANDER POPE, An Essay on Man-"The Design" I The past four decades have witnessed an explosion of knowledge in the natural sciences, especially in biology and the related life sciences. The effects of this new knowledge have been increasingly felt among social scientists and humanists of all perspectives who recognize that they can no longer remain insulated from data and theories which may so profoundly determine our future definitions of ourselves. One measure of this new awareness is the establishment of a new area of study within the discipline of political science, the subfield of bio-politics. As the name implies, it is a study of the traditionally accepted themes of "the political" from the broader 0192-5121 94/04 327-19 ? 1994 International Political Science Association</page><page sequence="2">Of Facts and Values: A Bio-political Perspective perspective of evolutionary biology and other relevant life sciences. The goal is a synthesis of knowledge which will provide a more accurate, holistic picture of our species, a more complete profile of ourselves in all our dimensions. The heart of this integrative effort is a rebirth of interest in human nature theorizing. Long shunned because of its sometime misuse as a handmaid to one ideology or another, human nature has again emerged as a crucial focus of study. Scholars are becoming aware that the biological revolution of today may produce a radically refined definition of human nature tomorrow, through a truly empirical and scientifically based philosophy. In pursuit of this aim a bio-political philosophy is prepared to confront the peren- nial questions of philosophy that have been asked afresh in each new era. What is different about the re-posing of these queries today is that the natural sciences are increasingly able to provide guides to answers from a wide range of empirical evidence that was never previously available. Thus, for example, the question of the naturalness of human aggression, a phenomenon that has been theorized about since ancient times, can now be examined in the light of data and evidence gleaned from sciences as seemingly disparate as animal ethology and psychopharmacology. If it can be determined that aggression, even violence, is a natural part of our evolutionary baggage as human beings, then that becomes the empirical basis upon which normative or evaluative discourse can proceed. If human aggression is a fact of the species' evolution and existence, then the human values in terms of which control of that aggression is sought are the grist for the contemporary normative philosopher. Akin to this type of inquiry has been my own interest in the nature of human value systems, specifically their source and their purpose. Since observation seems to verify that Homo sapiens sapiens is uniquely a normative animal, it can be inferred that the source of those norms would be in part at least some equally unique charac- teristic of our nature. A likely candidate as such a source is obviously that product of our unique brain which we call our reason or rationality. Yet rationality implies conscious choice and deliberation, factors that do not always seem to be part of the human value-making process. Is it possible that the ultimate origin of our "norma- tiveness" is far more primordial and far less calculated than we have yet realized and that it may be as fundamental to our biological programming as our linguistic ability, and in fact far more ancient than that rather recent acquisition? If this were the case then might it also be possible that the content of human value systems might be more constant and consistent than they at first appear, since they would be the product of our biology first and our culture second? And then, finally, might it also be possible that the either/or dichotomy between moral absolutism and moral relativism-an opposition as old as Plato in Western philosophy-might just in reality be a fictitious polarity after all? The following essay is an exploration of these questions. It is my feeling that an empirico-historical approach, employing materials and evidence from all relevant scientific sources, will eventually provide an a posteriori basis for understanding how and why we are the normative creatures we seem to be. In this short space, however, I will touch only on the necessity to understand the logical limitations of empirical (scientific) epistemology, and the ramifications which such a clarification can have in assessing the nature of human value systems. Before we consider the nature of values then, we must examine the realm of facts. This in turn requires a review of that most formidable and still relevant epistemological purgative, David Hume's (1711-76) critique of Rationalist Philosophy. 328</page><page sequence="3">RICHARD SHELLY HARTIGAN II Hume's critique is so crucial to an understanding of the limits of human knowledge that it must be the starting point for any modern discussion of human nature in scientific terms. The reason for this is quite simple: If philosophy is to profit from the new knowledge of the natural sciences, its practitioners must take full account of the nature of scientific method and particularly the empirical theory of knowl- edge. Hume still provides the best guide for this journey.' At bottom, Hume's work may be summarized as an attempt to disentangle three skeins which had been confusedly woven together. He himself referred to them as the misuse of the term "Reason," which had become by his time a catch-all concept that included virtually anything which the Rationalists wished to discuss or prove. To correct this misuse he proposed arguments which are critical to my inquiry and can be outlined as follows. Hume's analysis is tripartite. He contended that knowledge and its truth deriva- tives (or verifiability) involve three levels, the first of which is the mathematical proposition. For example, if A = B, and if B = C, then A = C. The essential element in this proposition is the conditional "if." No knowledge of the factors' relationship to reality is necessary; the factors are symbols, constructs of the mind; their individual verifiability is extraneous to the truth-value of the proposition. The "truth" of the proposition's conclusion (A = C) lies in the relationship between the conditional propositions. The conclusion is "absolute truth," in the sense that the mind cannot logically conceive of an alternative or contradiction to the conclusion. This is Hume's "litmus test," a test which only mathematical knowledge can pass. The second category of truth lies in "fact." The material involved here is concrete, objective reality. Since the Rationalists, following Descartes, had rejected innate ideas as a source of truth a priori, knowledge had become a sensory derivative-the mind comes to knowledge through the senses. Hume said that such knowledge can yield only probable truth since, by definition, its source is sensory and as such poten- tially in error. Since the senses can deceive, knowledge derived from them cannot be presumed to be infallible or absolutely true. This does not mean that this knowl- edge is necessarily inaccurate, only that it cannot logically be asserted without doubt. What the mind asserts as fact, therefore, is an impression of reality, and no matter how widely held by how many minds, it remains subject to the test of absolute incontrovertibility, a test which it cannot logically pass. Knowledge derived from the senses, therefore, can only be probably true. Finally, the realm of value assertion is, according to Hume, precisely that, asser- tion. That a thing or a person possesses a quality (rectitude, beauty, justice) is purely a subjective determination of the viewer or subject. It is a matter of prefer- ence of the viewer and, as such, has its source in "emotion." It is irrelevant to detail subsequent attempts to cope with Hume's critique: they have either failed (Kant), or have circumvented the problem which he raised (Hegel et al.). A metaphysical approach to the problem of knowledge such as Hegel's may be a valid alternative, but it is one which does not address itself to the necessity of examining human nature through the observable data of that nature's existence and behavior. Hume forces us to observe and to be skeptical of what we conclude from our observations. Hume's analysis called into question that most sacred of scientific cows, the notion of cause and effect. Let us picture a scientist who feeds "x" amount of poison to ninety-nine mice, after which they all die. The "obvious" conclusion is that the 329</page><page sequence="4">Of Facts and Values: A Bio-political Perspective poison has killed the mice. But the obvious workaday common sense conclusion is not necessarily true, in the strict, logical sense. Logically, such a cause and effect relationship is only possible if one possesses absolutely certain knowledge of the essence of the elements involved and has taken into account all possible variables. This, of course, is physically impossible as it is beyond the capacity of empirical investigation and verification. An empirical theory of knowledge relies on what can be observed. A soul, an essence, an urstuff, or nature cannot be measured, weighed, or examined. It may exist, but it cannot be quantified or catalogued. What exists is that which can be verified by the senses. To see and taste, smell and feel and hear-these are the means by which we self-described knowing animals come to knowledge. What Hume said, therefore, to the natural scientists of his time was that cause and effect may exist, but it cannot be logically proven; all that can be demonstrated is a sequence of events. For example, if water vaporizes over heat at 100?C, has the heat caused the change? Perhaps so-but perhaps no. Logically something else may have caused it. Not surprisingly, the natural scientists of his day were nonplused by Hume's criti- cal skepticism. If there was one thing which these scholars were certain of, it was the absolute truth of their conclusions, based as they supposedly were on discov- ered, incontrovertible, universal principles. But their truth were derivable from sense-perceived data or experience. As such, according to Hume's logic, this knowl- edge and its derived conclusions, might be true-but then again, they might not be. The group most devastated by Hume's analysis, however, were the moral philoso- phers. His separation of fact from value, of what we would term today as the separa- tion of the objective from the subjective, meant that all human values or judgments about quality must be considered relative to time, place, and circumstance-or, in Hume's parlance, "convention." Goodness, badness, beauty, justice could not be seen as inherent qualities of things, innate characteristics which could be discov- ered, but rather as attributes awarded to objects by those objects' subjective observers. Hume was challenging the existence of absolute qualities, of standards of ethical behavior rooted in some sort of transcendental existence, of ideal truths or rules to be approximated to or attained. No longer could philosophers of ethics refer to concepts such as inherent goodness or absolute justice with confidence of logical acceptance. These value-laden terms would have to be recognized for the subjective opinions that they were. Hume was not destroying ethics, as many of his critics contended. He was provid- ing a great service to ethical thought by cleansing normative speculation of its previ- ous false reliances or presumptions. If properly viewed, he placed the art (or science) of human evaluation on a more honest, less arrogant basis, what I would call a non-ideological foundation. Hume's critique could not be ignored, nor was it. He synthesized and criticized the prevailing philosophy of his time so thoroughly that no one who approached the questions of truth and certainty could dismiss his analysis. He left us a number of options and consequences: (1) If we concede that all of human knowledge is the result of sense experience, then we must admit the possibility that our knowledge might be in error. (2) As such, even the "hard" evidences of the natural sciences cannot be asserted as though either they or the conclusions derived from them are irrefutably certain-Hume's litmus test of the logical possibility, no matter how remote, of contradictions or alternatives, forces investigators to assert only the probability of their conclusions' truth. (3) In the matter of values, one must concede 330</page><page sequence="5">RICHARD SHELLY HARTIGAN their relativity and subjective origins; that they are held or adhered to is an objec- tive fact, but they remain the construct of the persons who constructed them and therefore have even less claim to being demonstrably true than conclusions based on empirical evidence. This does not mean that there is no absolute standard or set of moral principles; it does mean that if such do exist, they cannot be known or proven empirically. This, in turn, does not mean that there is no universal (though ultimately still relative) set of moral standards, for there may be norms which, while subjective in their origin are so widely held that they are the common moral fund of all, or nearly all, human societies. Hume then leaves us with uncertainty (or at least only high degrees of proba- bility) in the realm of natural science, but also with extreme concern as to whether our individual moral choices have any relevance beyond our own opinion. If this were not enough to make us uneasy, he forces us to consider the relativity of communal value systems, or what I will later call and define as "public moralities." Moral relativity at the communal level means that the norms or values of a society (and their resulting institutions) will vary according to the perceived needs and desires of the society at a given time and under particular circumstances. In this line of thinking, standards of justice, beauty, goodness, excellence, and so forth, are in the minds of the beholders, subject to change even within communities, and identifiable with other societies' value systems only by coincidental extension. If the phrase "different strokes for different folks" has any significance it does so in this instance. I must stress again, however, that Hume's skepticism is purifying. It forces one to use care and precision in one's own thought and statements while reserving too ready acceptance of what others claim to be true. In short, it provides a perfect intellectual defense mechanism against the idealogue. This in no respect means that the search for truth is a futile quest, nor that we must accept moral relativity to the point of anarchy. On the contrary, as the natural sciences daily demonstrate, probable (as opposed to logically "absolute") truth is perfectly compatible with scientific inquiry and conclusions, while, as I hope to demonstrate, human normative systems and beliefs can be shown to possess a primary, empirical base which underlies their secondary, subjective articulations. Ironically, Hume's skepticism will prove to be the catalyst for the discovery of a scientific basis for human morality. This is the conclusion which the following discussion should reveal. III All human moral systems or codes are held by their adherents to be derived from, or based upon, the authority of a deity. As God or the gods are the author of these dicta, they must be viewed as absolutes, as a priori dicta allowing for no exceptions. But as Hume so devastatingly demonstrated, a priori moral principles cannot be found in nature, nor their truth demonstrated by scientific method. On the contrary, observation and comparative analysis of human cultures reveals a plethora of variation in human normative systems. Relativity, not consistency, would seem to be the best characterization of human public moralities, those bodies of rules which guide human behavior. There may, however, be a third alternative to the either/or opposition of absolute versus relative in the matter of human morality. If one takes Hume seriously, then the absolutist position must be rejected as nondiscoverable and nonverifiable. This does not mean though that the moral relativity so dear to the 331</page><page sequence="6">Of Facts and Values: A Bio-political Perspective hearts of past generations of cultural anthropologists is any more empirically demonstrable.2 On the contrary, on closer examination what becomes evident is that all human normative systems are fundamentally and consistently alike in their few, basic principles, and that this consistency obtains regardless of time (epoch) or place (environment). If this is the case we would be dealing with universal (not absolute, since they might admit of exceptions), human (not deity-derived) norms, rigid at their base and plastic in their application, giving the appearance of being either absolute or relative, yet being neither. The validity of this statement requires nothing more than a comparative analy- sis of human value systems.3 Such a comparison reveals that the several funda- mental principles from which all normative variations of human morality evolve are alike in all human communities and can be reduced to the single proposition: "Do that which will promote life, avoid that which will cause death." To save ourselves a culture-by-culture comparison, we can verify this observation by examining a long- standing and familiar moral code, the Decalogue of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Its fundamental identity with other moral codes will be obvious. I bluntly contend that the Decalogue, the Ten Commandments, is an example of a moral regimen, not of how human believers can win salvation and eternal life, but rather of how human beings have thus far successfully guaranteed their earthly existence. It is, in fact, an articulated survival mechanism for this life. Stripped of rhetoric, interpolation, and in some instances, faulty translation, it states clearly and simply the "do's and don'ts" which, when followed, have assured human cooper- ation, communal stability and predictability of behavior-the basic ingredients for survival and propagation. Consider its injunctions.4 The first three commandments deal exclusively with our notion of, and relation- ship to, the idea of a supreme being. One obvious, observable, and verifiable insti- tutional constant in human culture is the species' practice of religious rite and ritual, and its members' belief in the hereafter. From simple burial sites of neolithic times, through the pyramids of the Pharoahs to contemporary "memory gardens," humans have made the statement of their belief in life after death, of the existence of beings or forces which surpassed their own perceived puny ability to foreover forestall the coming of that grim reaper, Death. Feuerbach and Freud,3 among many others, have offered interesting arguments on the origins of religious belief. The former saw humanity as the creator of divin- ity, not vice versa. The creature, abject in material misery, created an unobtainable ideal which it called god, which it then worshipped from afar as subject to object and from which it was permanently alienated. For Freud, the notion of god was also a human illusion of an almighty, all-powerful being, belief in which comforts us in our realization of our own vulnerability. These and other theories view the human predilection for religion as the result of pragmatic necessity. In its dawning awareness, the species recognized the existence of forces and phenomena which escaped its understanding and control, but which it also perceived as having a life or death effect upon it. The sun with its warmth, the moon and the tides, the refreshment of nature provided by rain, the security of fire-these and other evidences of nature were beyond human expla- nation, much less susceptible of human intervention. What else could this creature do in the face of such obviously crucial features in its existence but objectify them as beings or entities infinitely removed from itself, yet minimally comprehensible in somewhat human terms. Anthropomorphism of these deities would naturally follow, and sun-god, rain-god, and others would require their worshipful due. Be the 332</page><page sequence="7">RICHARD SHELLY HARTIGAN deity conceived of as one or several, the duty to appease or propitiate it was obvious. Their survival, in their own minds, depended upon it. This scenario of the origin of religious belief and practice makes eminent good sense. Awe, even fear, and reverence in the face of the unknown are typical human responses, and it is instructive that as our knowledge of natural forces has increased, along with our ability to control the environment and protect ourselves from nature's whimsy, so too has our notion of the supernatural become less anthro- pomorphic, less personal, and more abstract. But what of the yearning for an after-life, for an existence beyond the visible and obviously temporal? It is a view, a passion, distinct from, yet connected to, the belief in deity and the supernatural, and may be understood in part from the species' sexuality. Long ago our organic predecessors forsook parthenogenic reproduction. Unlike the amoeba, which reproduces ad infinitum, one cell simply dividing again and again, our species is sexual and requires the union, fusion, of two genetically incomplete cells. When they are joined, the new zygote or fertilized cell, the now pregnant product of two otherwise cellular throwaways, can become a unique member of the species. Sexual reproduction, therefore, means individuality. But the price paid for this individuation is a reduction of the organism's existence to a specific time span; it has a beginning and an end. Among sexually reproducing animals a profound recognition of "end things" must be a peculiar ability for us, the reasoning beings. Other animals sing or howl, moan or low a seeming funereal dirge for their own. It quickly passes as the corpse remains unburied, soon to be food in the life chain, and the life of its kin goes on. Given our innate cleverness in dispatching means to ends, and our loathing to become only a rotting mass of flesh and fluid, is it surprising that we should yearn to transcend this vale, to picture our often less than pleasant sojourn on this planet as a temporary trip in time to be followed by an infinitely extended bliss? In fact, we create for ourselves an afterlife. When our ancestors became conscious of their mortality, we shall never know. One fact is more than likely, however: when that awareness dawned, it was surely accompanied by a fear of the unknown and a regret that life must come to an end. It is further likely that at this point, our ancestors set their wits and imaginations to the task of overcoming the finality of biological extinction. Thus was born the idea of an afterlife, a transcendence of mortality, a continuation of life if only in an altered form. And with this idea, we created religion, to offset and rationalize our innate fear of the unknown. This hypothesis of the origin of mystic faith and its enshrinement in religious rite and ritual is too convincing to be ignored because it offers a natural explanation for that which has long been rationalized only in supernatural terms. What must be added to this picture, to complete it, is a recognition of the biochemical origins of the animal fear reaction. Other animals sense danger and react with flight or fight; only we, faced with the danger of death, can cerebrate that fear and assuage it as religion. The ubiquity of belief in superior beings and afterlife is hardly surpris- ing in a species so singularly equipped with the mental power to escape that danger which only it can so clearly see. Neuro-scientists describe certain animal reactions as the result of what they call "hard-wiring," that is the neural response mechanism which will spontaneously function if triggered by appropriate circumstances.6 Such a hard-wired reaction is fear. As humans we are not instinctively, genetically programmed to religious belief. That is the aftermath of our inherited biochemical equipment. It is the means by 333</page><page sequence="8">Of Facts and Values: A Bio-political Perspective which our ancestors rationalized, dealt with, and escaped from a recognized termi- nal fate. Planted in the species' dawn, belief in the supernatural was conventional- ized for dozens of millennia, and still serves the same function as it did eons ago. From the primal fear of death, religious response arose, but the content and form of that response have evolved with enormous variation. This, too, is to be expected from a creature who, in the course of millions of years, has encountered nearly as many differing environments. But with an increasing reliance on science in general, and a greater control over the environment in particular, notions of an anthropo- morphic deity or deities have receded along with confidence in life beyond biologi- cal death. At least this is true for some, while for many, one form or another of religious belief continues to provide comfort and escape. It is not my intent to disparage belief in immortality nor to deny deistic faith. However, it is imperative to distinguish the provable from the unprovable, the more likely from the less likely, or as Thomas Aquinas put it, the realms of reason and faith. What I am proposing is a natural explanation for a universally verifiable fact-Homo sapiens has long believed in the existence of an order of being greater than itself, and in a life after physical death. Human beings are linked in a phylo- genetic continuum with all organic existence and, as such, experience fear. Our unique biological apparatus, the neo-cortex, enables us to both perceive and under- stand death, and to imagine the means to mitigate or escape its finality. Thus, in time, we elaborated religion as one of several survival devices, have pragmatically fashioned it in different forms, and continue to adhere to it in varying degrees as a palliative and an underpinning for other values which also serve a survival function. Viewed from this perspective, faith in the supernatural can be seen as a perfectly "rational" (that is, intellectually reasoned) human contrivance, to some degree promoting the end of self and group preservation. The truth of that faith, however, remains unverifiable. Belief in and worship of the supernatural as a means of coping with innate fear of the unknown is not so readily recognizable as a survival mechanism as are the other tenets of the Decalogue. In this Judeo-Christian expression of the first three tenets it is identical to that of other cultures in other places at other times in invok- ing belief, respect, and reverence for a being or beings, supposed superior to our own. Not even in its arguable monotheism is this tradition unique.7 Nor is the remainder of its prescriptions and prohibitions, what Aquinas called the social commandments, any different from the fundamental precepts of other human moral codes.8 IV The fourth commandment directs persons to honor their fathers and mothers. This is simple and straightforward. But it is far more than an exhortation to pay parental tribute or acknowledge filial piety to one's immediate forbears. To fully appreciate this instruction it should be understood as advice to give respect and support to all of our older kin, and by extension, pay attention to all who have preceded us on our temporal journey through biological life. Such an extension of the command- ment does not dilute but rather enriches it and makes comprehensible why we as a species generally revere and willingly provide for our elders whether related to us or not. But why should we concern ourselves with those who are a generation or two or three beyond our age? If we have survived to independence we are our own movers 334</page><page sequence="9">RICHARD SHELLY HARTIGAN and shakers of the environment with our own problems of survival and propaga- tion. We no longer require the nurture of mother's milk or our father's oft-repeated litany of survival skills. We have become our own person and as such presumably need no other. In our condition of ambiversion-seeking our individual goals and desires to the maximum, yet always failing that and settling for less, because every- one else is doing and striving for the same-we recognize our inability to survive alone or even with just a consort and our progeny. We need others as they need us. It is our human condition. We enter life at the bottom of our species' life spectrum-"mewling and puking babes," as Shakespeare describes us. We mature, live, and die, but our lives from the initial moment to the final gasp are enriched by those who have gone before. And, in deference to them, we pay our homage. In a simple society, the hierarchy of generational deference is obvious, and its relationship to biological survival clear. The father, mother, grandparents, aunts, and uncles-as survivors-possess a wisdom to be shared, a knowledge to be learned, and values to be passed on. They are, in fact, our cultural survival vehicles because they are our knowledge banks, our value repositories. It is the older one who instructs the younger how to shape the spear, how to track the game, how to ambush the enemy, how to gather and prepare the food, make ready for menses, conceive, bear, and care for the next generation. It is simply a case of stored knowl- edge, and that is reason enough to respect and listen to those who have avoided or survived the dangers of life-threateners, and lived to enjoy the chorus of life's sound, light, touch, taste, and smell. To fail to pay attention to or take care of his or her own in their dotage not only represents a posture of ingratitude but is an act of potential fundamental damage to the species. It constitutes a break in the continuity of human, that is, political life in which sharing and mutual aid are not just "nice things to do," but are the- basic necessities of survival, for the individual and, by extension, for the group as a whole. The younger generation not only is paying back what it owes to those older ones who helped it to survive, but in its turn is setting an example for the next generation to follow. Thus, the polity is reinforced by a continual vertical and horizontal repetition of aid and respect, initiated from the past and extended to the foreseeable future. In fact, this uninterrupted flow of bonding goes a long way toward guaranteeing that there will be a future for the species. No one in the distant beginnings of our species held a formal class in child nurturing, parenting, or care and concern for those past their prime. How then can we explain the ubiquity of these phenomena in every human culture, at all times? The obvious answer, which does not stretch the imagination, is that they are of the very nature of the being, and as such are instinctive. The fact that they manifest themselves differently, take different forms in different contexts at different times, in no way mitigates the existence of the underlying general principle: "Take care of and respect those older than you, as they have done, and as you wish it done to you." Are there and have there been exceptions to the rule? No doubt, but that is precisely what they are, exceptions to the rule, which if it were not a rule, our species would not have become as successful as it has proved to be. The next commandment deals with a subject matter so patently obvious for its survival virtue that it is almost banal to consider it at any length. The prohibition "Thou shalt not steal" clearly and simply states that one and all are forbidden to arbitrarily help themselves to goods which are not acknowledged to be theirs. In a sense, it may be argued that this provides an implicit recognition of private property or ownership, but the implications are broader. Certainly it can be read as "Don't 335</page><page sequence="10">Of Facts and Values: A Bio-political Perspective take for private use, without permission, that which is designated the private property of someone else." But it also means, "Don't take from what is agreed upon as the public fund of possession." In a highly communalized society, in which the sphere of private ownership of anything is minimal, but the public use is extensive, (animals, crops, weapons), arbitrary allocation and use by the individual is consid- ered stealing, taking what does not belong to one. Even in our own highly priva- tized societies of America and Europe, the notion of public property prevails. Hence, the selling of public lands to private corporations for their own exploitation and profit is roundly condemned as tantamount to theft from society at large. The moral outrage that runs through the writings of Marx is precisely to this point. For him, and those relying on this criterion, the capitalist system provided the means by which the property of the vast majority, defined as the proletariat, was stolen from it. Whether one agrees with his specific analysis or not, the general accuracy of his insight was correct-what is defined as mine or thine or ours ought not to be taken from us without our acquiescence. Human societies universally accept the general principle that theft, when defined and discerned, is an act deserving of punishment under the laws of the group. To allow it to go unpunished literally provides a license for stealing, something no human society can afford, again for the most obvious of reasons: it would create chaos, competition run wild, strife, and generally the kind of unstable situation in which safety and security have vanished, replaced by unpredictability and danger- not conditions conducive to the success of a group or, ultimately, its species. Each society decides for itself what constitutes private and public property, what act or actions shall be considered violations as theft, and what punishments shall be proper for those deemed as violators. But all societies which survive hold to the value that theft, however defined, shall not be tolerated. The last commandment, prohibiting the "coveting" of one's neighbor's goods, can be seen as a kind of gloss or reinforcement of the ban on stealing; not only don't do it, but don't even consider doing it! Another commandment, closely related to these two, is the injunction not to bear false witness against one's neighbor. Taken literally, this requirement has a distinc- tively legalistic tone about it, implying trials and courtrooms. This is hardly surpris- ing given the juristic persuasion of the Israelites. Read again in a broader sense, however, it can be seen as a general prohibition against lying, spreading or abetting the spread of falsehood and deceit. In other words, "tell the truth in all of your dealings with your conspecifics." Once again, at the dawning of our species' bonding in the primitive origins of communal living, it is impossible to picture a condition of consistent and widespread deceit. Those prime requisites for survival and propa- gation-security and stability-were and remain difficult to obtain and retain. Without mutual trust and confidence not even the smallest and most primitive policy could have survived. It is difficult to imagine a community composed of Cretan liars or the likes of Baron Munchausen lasting a day. In many instances, however, truth-telling may not always appear to be advantageous, just as not taking what one wants, whenever one wants to, may seem to be disadvantageous. But let us recall our ambivert nature. One part of us is the individual, seeking to maximize private goals and desires at every turn, as is everyone else whom one encounters. Our public selves, that part of us constantly dealing with others who are dealing with us and each other, must compromise or perish in our selfish pursuit. Hence, we do not, cannot, always or even very often gain all that we wish, and if we try to, we must acknowledge others' license to do the same. But such an acknowledgment 336</page><page sequence="11">RICHARD SHELLY HARTIGAN on our or others' parts is self-destructive. Whatever all our norms of behavior limita- tion are, in the final analysis, they constitute a body of self-protective mechanisms that, if adhered to generally, will guarantee us (and others) part of what we need and desire. We play politics. Why is it to our long-term advantage to tell the truth, though in the short term it may leave us with less than if we had lied? Because the lie cannot remain forever consistent with the observable facts and eventually one's deceit will be discovered exactly for what was intended-an attempt to gain unfair advantage in the compe- tition to survive. For such an attempt, one could pay a fearful price. Lincoln's obser- vation that you can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time, but not all of the people all of the time was precisely to the mark. Consistent falsehood can rarely go undetected forever since the lie by definition involves a false statement of fact. When the facts are available for others to judge, they will, in effect, speak for themselves. Even the most elaborate deceits, purposely foisted by leaders on their followers, and believed by many of the latter, are usually revealed for what they are. Here a distinction must be made between sincere misunderstanding of the proba- ble truth and conscious distortion of it. So ingrained in the human response system is the necessity to be truthful and to expect truth from others that our lives are led on a day-to-day basis with the expectation that our intercommunication with others involves an exchange of truth, that is, discernible facts, reported honestly, to the best ability of the communicator. Students may suspect that their professor's inter- pretation is in error, but they do not usually suspect the teacher of purposely deceiv- ing them. We read a train schedule and assume it to be accurate and well-intended, even when the train arrives late due to unforeseen factors. And we take with a grain of salt the nightly weather report, not because we distrust the intent of the reporters to tell the truth, but because both they and we know that they are working with only partial knowledge. In fact, we live day by day on the assumption that what we see, read, and hear is communicated to us by others as truthfully as it is possi- ble for them to do so. An ordered, stable, and secure existence would be impossi- ble without such confidence. It is precisely because of this assumption of honesty in others' dealings with us and our tendency to usually respond in kind that discovery of conscious deceit is so repulsive to us, the same kind of response engendered in us when we discover a theft. Truth-telling is therefore a natural expectation. We account for the mistake in judgment, excuse the unintentioned error, are skeptical of the source if that source has been wrong before, but we are far less likely to forgive the intentioned lie, perpetrated for personal gain or advancement. When we move to the commandment dealing with sexuality, we encounter again a rather straightforward prohibition that complexly operates at a number of levels in the way that it enjoins human behavior. It is perhaps the most interesting for what it says, implies, and does not say. "Thou shalt not commit adultery" means "Do not engage in illicit sex," which is sexual activity of a particular kind, namely, sex with someone else's mate. This is very important, for what is being explicitly protected is what I call "procreative integrity," that is, the sexual honesty and loyalty which is necessary to guarantee the lineage of offspring. King David sinned, not for lusting after Bathsheba, but because his lust was directed at a then other man's wife. The rule is clear in this respect: a male-female bond with the intent of procreation ought not to be intruded 337</page><page sequence="12">Of Facts and Values: A Bio-political Perspective upon from without. Chauvinistic as it may appear, it remains an undeniable truth- a male is only certain that his mate's offspring are his, if he is certain of her sexual fidelity to him. And why, in the great name of survival, is it necessary that a male be so assured? Because he will be ill-disposed, especially under conditions of hardship, to expend his energy and expose himself to danger in order to provide for offspring other than his own. The interesting, though not surprising, point of this commandment is that it is worded as it is. It does not say, "Do not have sex outside of the marriage bond," nor "Have sex only within the marriage bond with the intent of procreation." In this respect it is clear-husband and wife, be faithful to each other, while you are of the age, condition, and intent to have progeny by each other. At its core the commandment makes sense only when viewed in terms of procre- ative integrity, and then it makes great sense. Through adherence to it, the male receives assurance that his labor as provider is not sqandered on any but his own. But what does the female receive as a reward for her fidelity? Her offspring are hers, no matter who the father is. Again, we need not look too far. She gains from her loyalty the trust of her male consort and with that come protection and proven- der for herself and her offspring. She and they are vulnerable and her fertile span limited by comparison with the male. She needs precisely those things which he can provide and she knows that he will provide them if he trusts her. The family, then, is the natural and primary polity and interweaves with the necessities of truth-telling and not stealing, for a violation of sexual fidelity in marriage involves both theft and deceit. The female in her turn demands fidelity from her mate since his extramarital sexual activity may diminish his role as husband and father. Not only may he be killed by an irate cuckold, but he may produce offspring by another female, thereby diluting his concern for her and hers. Hence, the bigamist is not usually well tolerated in monogamous societies, unless he can provide equally for his additional family or families. In Islam, where the Prophet allows multiple wives, the rules to be followed are very clear: a man may have no more than four wives at any one time, and all must be treated with equal respect and provision. Mohammed recognized that these conditions would be difficult to meet by any but a wealthy man, and so it would not (as has become the case) be the common condition. In fact, polygamy is typically allowed only in those human societies in which underpopulation is the norm and where a prior- ity is placed on having as many male children as possible, again for survival purposes. The matter of male promiscuity raises some other interesting points, however, directly related here. Why should virtually every society, past and present, tolerate to some degree a form of female prostitution? Even in those societies where it has not been openly sanctioned it has continued to exist covertly, stubbornly resisting all attempts to eliminate it. Is it possible that prostitution has evolved as a formal or informal convention acting as a safeguard to the integrity of the family unit? Could it be that it has provided a kind of natural sexual safety valve, especially in predominantly monogamous societies? Available temporary sexual partners for the male would actually be advantageous to the entire group in several ways. Unbonded males would be diverted from seducing already claimed females; married males' promiscuity could be indulged without disruption of the family bond's material provision; and the bonded female could be relieved of unwanted sexual activity during times of pregnancy and offspring nurturing. Hence, the male is temporar- ily released from his bonds of fidelity to the relief of both parties, without fear that 338</page><page sequence="13">RICHARD SHELLY HARTIGAN his sexual activity will result in new children to be supported. If a prostitute should conceive, she could hardly identify the father even if she cared to, while her customers would feel no continued obligation toward her. Our sensitivity to the material and psychological exploitation of women, and the danger and misery which they often bear as temporary sexual partners in our society, should not blind us to the fact that prostitution is indeed the world's oldest profession and its presence and longevity have obviously proven to be not destructive of the family. Indeed, its very existence may stem from the need to redirect, temporarily, the sexual drive of the male, thus actually sustaining the family as the context for acknowledged offsprings' nurturing. It is absurd to contend that such an institution could be the result of male dominance, perpetuated since time immemorial, over unwilling victims. The odds do not favor such a conclusion when our species' record is one of institutions retained or discarded in direct proportion to their survival value. Prostitution will only disappear when it poses a threat to human society-a condi- tion which it has obviously thus far not posed-or ceases to provide some value, which it apparently has continued so to do.9 What this commandment relates to, therefore, is not human sexuality in general but rather to a specific instance of sexual activity--marriage. This must be viewed for precisely what it is-a public ritual in which the participants pledge at least temporary sexual exclusivity for the purpose of the easy identification of offspring, should they appear. In most societies sexual experimentation before public bonding has been the norm, being not only tolerated but encouraged. So, too, dissolution of the union when its procreative purpose has been served is a common practice. One minor but instructive example of how deep-seated is this urge for public, formal recognition of the sexual bond when offspring are intended can be seen in the contemporary fad of "trial" marriages. Offspring rarely result, and if they do the trial abruptly ends with traditional nuptials. It may be argued that many persons do not marry, and many who do choose not to have offspring. The species' record, however, is clear; enough humans have done so over time that we now count ourselves in the billions. The principle contained in this commandment is far from a gloomy anti-sexual prohibition despite attempts by religious puritans to make it so. On the contrary, it can and should be seen as an exhortation to maintain and continue that already natural institution of the family with all that that entails, in recognition and support of one's direct and indirect lineage. That human society has evolved from extended families through kin-clans to ethnic groups with specialized beliefs and language systems is testament enough to the degree of human adherence to this principle. The forms of procreative bonding may and do differ, sometimes radically, but the principle remains constant. I realize that these observations may appear to disregard the fullness of the human male-female relationship, what we call "love." This is not so, for how could anyone dispute the existence of the vast array and profound depth of emotions that characterize human sexual bonding within and without marriage. What must be grasped, however, is that the complexities and sophistication of human intercourse in all areas of interaction is a matter of degree and not a difference in kind. The life-long bonding which we observe among so many animals in disparate species is not accidental or totally unrelated to ourselves. The eagle, goose, wolf, and African wild dog, to name only a few, mate for life, share the tasks of parenting, and evidence affection for and protection of each other. Though a fundamental purpose for these animals is procreation, it is hard to conceive of their behavior as devoid 339</page><page sequence="14">Of Facts and Values: A Bio-political Perspective of the extra dimensions of solace, comfort, and pleasure beyond this primary need. And so too for us, albeit in more extended and intricate ways. But if a necessary reason for our sexuality, as for other animals, is propagation of a new generation, it must also be remembered that we humans possess an enhanced sexuality far in excess of that enjoyed by any other animal. Our biologi- cal equipment allows us to add the dimension of recreation to procreation as an aspect of our sexuality, a freedom for extended passion and pleasure that is unique to our species. What must be recognized is the inseparability of these sexual functions. One is not "primary" (procreation) and the other "secondary" (recre- ation) as some traditional "natural law" views of human sexuality would have it. Quite the contrary, the two dimensions are parts of an integrated whole and it is the entire package that partially accounts for the evolutionary success of the species. The vulnerability of Homo sapiens in competition with other predators is often noted: a lengthy gestation period, an even longer nurturing span, a soft skin, the lack of fang or claw, smallness of size, and slowness of gait-all of these charac- teristics and others have placed us at great disadvantage in the struggle for survival. But a unique form of sexuality, creative of a specially improved context of bonding, and with this, greater protection for the pregnable female and her offspring, coupled and integrated with an enlarging brain-all of these together could and did offset the species' deficiencies. In the truest sense, our distinctive sexuality is an integrated cause of our evolutionary success. Predictably, then, as our intellects expanded to a greater awareness of the relationship of ourselves to our conspecifics, and to the rest of nature, we articu- lated norms of behavior that would promote our survival and procreation. One of these norms was procreative integrity, that is, sexual fidelity to the mate responsi- ble for our offspring. And with greater complexity of our cerebral cortex there evolved a more complex awareness of the speciality of our bond, an enhanced range of passion and response, in short, what we now call love. I have saved for final consideration that commandment which at first reading seems to contradict the pattern which I have developed in the others, namely, that they all refer to general principles, applied or formulated differently in time and context. I refer to the prohibition, "Thou shalt not kill." In this form or translation the injunction appears to be an absolute prohibition against the taking of human life, and as extended by some, any life at all. Read in this literal sense there could be no exception or qualification, and certainly this has been the interpretation of Christian pacifism for many centuries, an echo of the pacifism preached and practiced by various groups and religions in the East. But as is often the case, things are not always as they appear. When I began my analysis of the Decalogue from a bio-political perspective, I was struck by the obvious inconsistency that this one commandment, perhaps the most important one since it dealt specifically and in no uncertain terms with human existence, should unequivocally deny the permissibility of ever taking life. It seemed radically different from the other normative principles. "Don't steal" begs to be further defined by raising the question, "What constitutes stealing?-Tell me what 'it' is that I may not arbitrarily take to my own, and I will not do it." And so with all the other commandments. In fact, there really is no inconsistency. The commandment as it has come down to us has simply been mistranslated. When the injunction was rendered from the original Aramaic into its first translation, Greek, there were two Greek meanings 340</page><page sequence="15">RICHARD SHELLY HARTIGAN available: "Do not kill," and "Do not murder." The former was chosen over the latter, and a fateful choice was made. From the Greek to the Latin to English, in our case, Christians have been exhorted not to kill; and from St. Augustine on, Christian writers have attempted to reconcile this injunction with the reality of everyday life. Augustine's theory of a "just war," and its later elaborations, stemmed from an uncomfortable guilt, a nagging tic, to justify what appeared to be part of the human condition-killing-with the prohibition of the Mosaic Law and the apparent exhortations of Jesus to forbear, to forgive, even to sacrifice one's own existence in the face of a lethal threat. But if the prohibition is rendered as it could have been, and I venture for logic's sake, should have been, as "Do not murder," then the inconsistency with the other survival norms disappears. "Do not murder" is fundamentally different from a blanket prohibition against killing because the former means "Do not commit unjust homicide." All human societies possess such a norm, and for the most obvious of reasons, namely, individual and group survival. Unjust killing of another human being is to be avoided at all costs, and a violation of this rule is inevitably the most severely punished, often with the taking of the murderer's life. But what is murder, that is, unjust killing? Again, time and circumstance-the society's ethos or public morality-will make this definition. Different circum- stances, needs, preferences, will dictate what a society can tolerate from its members (more accurately, what society's members can tolerate from each other) in terms of homicide. Defense of the group's integrity, territory, lifestyle, or values, is universally recognized as necessary, and if this requires the killing of outsiders, it is accepted without blush or qualm.10 Even Augustine and subsequent Christian just-war theorists found no problem with a "defensive" war. Within the human group, however, extensive adjustment rather than an even pattern is found with regard to when a member or members may kill each other without onus. These various patterns will change as the mores of the group change, which, in turn, will depend upon the group's evaluation of danger. As societies determine their inter- nal norms of justice, so too will they judge the appropriateness of homicide. Once again, we encounter a universal human norm, in this case a prohibition of homicide outside the prescribed limits, with the limits themselves determined by circum- stantial, that is, particular, societal judgment. It is ironic that, but for an ancient mistranslation, the entire tradition of Christian pacifism might not have occurred. Yet that tradition has served to sharpen our sensitivity to cruelty that can be avoided, the truly "senseless" killing of our conspecifics, the needless destruction of human life. But the necessity still remains: under certain circumstances of perceived threat to the group, either from within (the "criminal") or from without (the "enemy"), life must be taken but only if the prescribed norms of the society allow it. In the New Testament there are recorded the words of Jesus, pronounced in his Sermon on the Mount; they are generally referred to as "counsels of perfection." They are ideals that are romanti- cally attractive, but which bear little if any coincidence with reality. To continually turn the other cheek, or to expect the meek to inherit the earth, is to believe that in the short span of two thousand years the species can voluntarily jettison reactions that natural selection has, over eons, "wired" into it. Of course, by means of our neo-cortex, our reasoning organ, we can choose to mute, even temporarily overcome, the triggered responses of our older organs. But our godlike brain remains a tyro when compared with them. Competition, struggle, even violence, have marked our species' evolutionary progress. This is a fact. 341</page><page sequence="16">Of Facts and Values: A Bio-political Perspective v The Decalogue (and its corresponding images in all other human societies) is an adequate guide for human behavior simply because it is a reflection of human nature. It recognizes implicitly the urges and needs of the ambivert and states the general principles that underlie human and humane existence. Understood in its broader interpretation, it can be seen as a synoptic statement of what our species has been doing as a means of evolving to its present state. The Ten Commandments, therefore, so dear to our very short span as humans, in our own singular historical tradition, serve as a reminder of what we have been doing as a species-individually and in groups-all along. It is a reinforcing statement made when we in the West had become more sophisticated in our techniques of commu- nication, more settled than our distant ancestors in providing for daily and seasonal requirements of food and shelter, and generally more comfortable with ourselves in our confrontation with our environment. It is, therefore, a recital of principles, shared and articulated by contemporary literate societies in the non-Western world, and intuited by all other human societies, past and present." One characteristic of these norms is readily apparent but deserves an additional stress: they are expressions of the negative. Don't steal, don't lie-to your neigh- bor or your mate-don't murder, and don't commit sacrilege of the deity. These are the minimal prohibitions or limitations on human activity within a polity that must be observed if the polity is to survive. These are sine qua nons of human existence and as such tell us nothing about the quality or substance of life, the "good life" of the poets and philosophers. It is the adaptation, the specifications, the varied elaborations of these basic principles that are the next steps in human value systems. These are the conventionalized rites and customs that make explicit and concrete the primary "don'ts" of the species' life. These secondary expressions are the means by which varied societies identify their peculiar and quite relative understanding of their "good lives." And it is these secondary mores which have so fascinated students of culture and led them to the erroneous conclusion that there is no consistent and fundamental urstuffin human nature, or more specifically, in human value systems. What we see, then, is that the primary biological direction of human behavioral evolution has been survival and procreation. This has expressed itself in a handful of general, universal principles relating to lineage, property, and truth. These principles, in their turn, have been and are expressed customarily or convention- ally in the public moralities of human societies. I am arguing that human norma- tive systems contain a basic root-survival of the individual as one of many (the ambivert)-which proceeds ineluctably to include the group, and hence, the species; that in this truly political (because it is actually or potentially confrontational) setting, the human group operates, conducts its business on a day-to-day basis, with this ultimate norm or preference or value as its uppermost priority; and that human value systems in their variety ultimately rest on this. An inquiry into our species' history reveals that we seek to maintain our biolog- ical existence, that we seek to extend that existence, and that we recognize its inevitable end, that we mediate our disputes over property, and that the safest and most economical use of our energies in perpetuating our genes is by truthful communication with each other. What is left? Variations on these sub-themes may be and are made, but the roots remain. No human society which has survived has been without these norms. 342</page><page sequence="17">RICHARD SHELLY HARTIGAN Since this seems to be the case, the question may be asked, "Why should these norms constantly recur, from time immemorial, in all human societies, regardless of civilizational level?" The probability factor is too high to be accounted for by accident. Since it is obvious that these norms do serve a species-preserving function, the answer to the question can only be that the species has evolved to its present point because of the species' adherence to them. They must, therefore, be viewed as vital factors in our evolution, no less significant than bipedalism, language, and our large neo-cortex. And as with these characteristics, which we had nothing to do with consciously, so too, our values evolved in spontaneous reaction to our physical evolution. How could it have been otherwise? The alter- native conclusion would have to be that human beings, at some specified time, consciously decided to adopt these norms as life-preserving means, and that they did so in all of their groups, at approximately the same time and with the same conscious result. And such a conclusion again demands the question "But if so, then who taught the teacher?" Once again we enter the realm of fantasy when we conjure up such a picture. Our species' technological development has been uneven, which simply records that some groups, for example, invented and used the wheel and others did not. But regardless of civilizational level, all human groups abide by these general norms. How did they come by them, just as all members of the species are bipedal, communicate complexly in languages that vary greatly but which all share a univer- sal syntactic core, and possess brains, which mark them as different from any other animal? The primary principles of human behavior control must be as natural to our species as our physical characteristics. In short, what we call our human norma- tive systems spring from that same selective biology that sees us as the evolved creatures we are today. They are at one and the same time a cause and an effect of our human condition. Notes 1. See Hume (1939, 1953), Descartes (1980) and Locke (1956). On the methodology of epistemology and a lengthy discussion of the "is"-"ought" problem and its relationship to moral discourse, see Taylor (1961). 2. For the story of American cultural determinism and the Boas, Benedict, Mead connec- tion, see Freeman (1983). An example of the degree to which Mead's biases live on can be seen in the work of a contemporary cultural anthropologist, Colin Turnbull. He, too, has been seduced by the Liberal state-of-nature fantasy of natural man-this time symbolized by the Pygmies of the Ituri rain forest in Central Africa-while he is repelled by the disintegration of the human polity of the Ik in East Africa, (Turnbull, 1962, 1972). 3. The coincidence of human value systems at the primary level is evident from all the anthropological literature, as is their base for and incorporation into religious belief. The definitive work to date (and for the foreseeable future) on this subject is LaBarre (1972). On the origins of the Old Testament, see also, Heidel (1963), and Lenowitz and Doria (1976). A classic of this literature remains Frazer (1963). 4. Recalling my discussion of Hume's critique, the following discussion of the Decalogue should not be misunderstood as an attempt to derive "ought" from "is." Quite the contrary, I am in no way implying that its principles ought to be complied with (or carry any prescrip- tive weight) merely because they have been so in the past. They are viewed here as strictly functional means to achieving an end. If human preference (self-preservation) remains the same, they may still serve their past purpose. My contention here and following is that the more we appreciate how and why we have arrived at our present moral paradigm, the greater will be our understanding of the limits of our future moral choices. 343</page><page sequence="18">Of Facts and Values: A Bio-political Perspective 5. Feuerbach (1957); Freud (1964). "Naturalistically approached, human religion turns out to be an entirely human phenomenon, and entirely derived from the nature of human nature. Religion has never been explainable in the terms provided by religion, and the long search for knowledge of the gods or of God has given us no knowledge whatever that is acceptable to all men. Why not then look carefully at man himself for an under- standing of this human phenomenon? It may startle those who would find God to be asked first to look at Australopithecine ape-men" (LaBarre, 1972, author's emphasis). 6. One of the best syntheses on the biological bases of human behavior and emotions is Melvin Konner, The Tangled Wing (1982). Konner's thoroughly dispassionate approach and elegant argumentation should be viewed as the foundation for an "interactionist" position on the relationship of biology and human nature theory. The nature-nurture dichotomy should now die a natural death. But see Wilson (1978: chap. 8). 7. It is obvious that, despite protestations to the contrary, the Christian notion of a triune deity is perilously close to polytheism, while belief in a virgin mother echoes the Bona Dea or Good Goddess of the Romans, itself a derivative of more ancient Mediterranean "Earth Mother" belief. 8. The naturalistic ethic developed here has some precedence in the thought of Darwin and Herbert Spenser, but should not be confused with them, especially the latter (see, for example, Wilson). More recent work which supports my view in whole or in part includes, in addition to Wilson, Fisher, and Konner, already cited, the following: Huxley (1947); Waddington (1960); Flew (1967); Fox (1980); Harris (1977); Pugh (1977); and Mackie (1985). Alexander's recent work (1987) is a state-of-the-art argument for the biological bases of human normative systems. An evolutionary biologist, he provides supportive evidence for many of the conclusions that I draw, as well as providing different emphases on issues which we both consider to be crucial. 9. Traditionally, even acknowledged children of concubines had no claim to the name or inheritance of their fathers, though those like King Solomon or a Turkish sultan were wealthy enough to support the additional mothers and children. In this vein, the fact that harems were guarded by eunuchs guaranteed that no specious pregnancies could take place among the sultan's wives or concubines-though sexual activity most assuredly could and did. 10. Two now-dated but still useful studies of warfare are Davie (1968), and Wright (1965). Also useful as a literature guide is Divale (1973). The single most important work in recent years for the purpose of my discussion is Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1979). For an example of historical attempt to normatively control the violence of warfare, see Hartigan (1982). 11. Every so-called capital sin (lust, greed, etc.,) is nothing more than an extreme of a perfectly natural inclination; it becomes reprehensible when considered dangerous to the community.
