A life t£ . % on canvas Margarita Cappock</page><page sequence="2">Bacon always described himself as a late starter when it came to paint ing. Having been expelled from the family home aged 16, he travelled to London, Berlin and then Paris where in June or July 1927 he saw the Exposition de Cent dessins par Pablo Picasso' at Chez Paul Rosenberg, Paris. This was an epiphany and inspired him to become a painter. Many of his early works demonstrate a debt to Picasso although he is also trying to find his own idiom. Before Bacon became a painter, he was a furniture and interior designer, something he was to play down later in life. One of his items of furniture, a tripartite painted screen, c. 1930 (30-01) is included in the catalogue raisonne because it is his earliest surviving large-scale work and anticipates the triptych format that he was to make his own. There are only 15 extant works and 2 destroyed works from 1929 to 1936 and then nothing from 1936 to 1944. He saw Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, 1944 (44-01) as his opus one, although Harrison notes it was in gestation for the pre vious seven years and of the fifteen surviving paintings made before it, six are essentially crucifixion subjects (Fig 4). Significantly, x-rays have revealed that underneath the right panel is the head of a man, possibly Eric Hall, his older lover whom he was close to from 1932 to 1949. This shocking trip tych has become Bacon's most famous painting and established him as a unique figure in British art. When first exhibited in April 1945 these anthropomorphic figures, blindfolded and baying in distress, were interpreted as evocations of war. Bacon was a member of the Stretcher Party in the Chelsea Branch of Air Raid Precautions and may have driven an ambulance for the Red Cross so must have been fully aware of the horrific injuries inflicted during the Blitz. However, his first Crucifixion dated from 1933. The crucifixion, an act of extreme violence, depicts the pain that can be inflicted on a human, the body is treated like a carcass in a slaughterhouse - splayed open, dehu manized and this relates to Bacon's view that 'we are meat, we are potential carcasses'. Nowhere is this more apparent than in a later crucifixion, Three Studies for a Crucifixion, 1962 (62 04). Crucially, Harrison notes that the crucifixion was a Bacon topos that he returned to at pivotal moments in his life and although a self-professed atheist who claimed that he only used the crucifixion as a metaphor for man's inhumanity to man, Bacon identified personally with the suffering. The artist's curiosity about injury and disease stems from earlier in his life - while in Paris in the late 1920s he bought a book on diseases of the mouth and his predilection for shock ing imagery is abundantly confirmed by his cache of medical imagery in his Reece Mews studio. Bacon had already encoun tered death at an early age in life in 1927 when his brother Edward died from measles aged 12, and another brother, Harley, died from tetanus two years later. Undoubtedly, the early encounters with illness and sudden death in his immediate family must have influenced Bacon's views of mortality. Death and the shadow of death were to become obsessive themes in his art. Bacon himself was afflicted with asthma all his life and his younger sister Ianthe related: 'My earliest memories of Francis are of him in my grandmother's bed, on a feathered mattress with the blinds down, gasping for breath. And the smell of Stramonium powder, which they burned all the time.' Stramonium was a powerful hallucinogen which for a child must have resulted in disturbed thoughts and distorted memories and the origin of the curved space that appears in his pivotal work, Painting, 1946 (46-03) was confirmed to both David Sylvester and Hugh Davies as triggered by the memory of three tall windows with velvet curtains in a bow-windowed curved room in his grandmother's Georgian house, 'Farmleigh', County Laois. Anthony Cronin recalled Bacon telling him a story about a maid or nanny who locked him in a cupboard at the top of the stairs when her boyfriend arrived so that he would not interrupt them. In the darkness of the cupboard - sometimes for several hours at a time - Bacon screamed in vain but later claimed that he owed a great deal to that cupboard and when 1 John Deakin (1912-1972] PORTRAIT OF FRANCIS BACON, c. 1962 gelatine silver print 30x25.4cm ©The Estate of Francis Bacon.

One wonders if this terrifying experience of confine ment or entrapment led to his series of paintings of scream ing in silence. From 1944, the disturbing and gruesome nature of Bacon's subject matter was the hallmark of his work. The first Bacon painting to enter a museum was Painting, 1946 bought by Alfred Barr, Director of Collections at MoMa, New York on 27 October 1948. The acquisitions committee had 'some misgivings because of its violent, disquieting subject matter.' An early work, Landscape with Pope/Dictator, c. 1946 (46 05), has never been reproduced before and may be the first Pope that Bacon painted (Fig 2). Harrison does not elabo rate on how it received its title but the conflation of Pope and FROM 1944, THE DISTURBING AND GRUESOME NATURE OF BACON'S SUBJECT MATTER WAS THE HALLMARK OF HIS WORK Dictator is telling as Bacon's obsession with the Pope as a figure of power and authority relates closely to his abiding interest in political leaders. Their political beliefs were of far less concern to him than their iconic status, and their occasional physical isolation as they are presented with a cluster of microphones before them. Bacon's obsession with the Pope resulted in several paintings in 1951, 1953 and then the series of works, some of which the artist intended be displayed together as an entity, such as the six paintings of Popes from 1961. Bacon's obsession extended beyond Velazquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X and there are several variations on Pope Pius XII which confirms that his obsession was with the figure of the Pope as a powerful male leader. Despite this apparent early success, Bacon removed himself to Monaco from 1946 to 1949 and whilst he painted regularly he destroyed almost everything that he produced. There are no works at all catalogued for 1947. Bacon became a great painter of the human body and in 1949 and he found his real subject - a figure isolated in a room, or within a geometrical structure. From 1957 to 1962 Bacon was rethinking his prac tice and explored a much wider range of poses and spatial arrangements in his works. Works such as Lying Figure, 1959 (59-02) serve to demonstrate this change (Fig 3). Although Bacon painted some nudes prior to 1959, from then onwards, nudes became one of his main subjects. In September 1959 he moved to St Ives, Cornwall and worked at Porthmeor Studios and this was a fertile period when he produced portraits, Popes and nude studies; the hallmark of which is his use of viridian green. His companion in St Ives was Ron Belton who is the subject of a number of these St Ives paintings for example, Walking Figure, 1960 (60-04). In 1961 he moved into 7 Reece Mews where he was to live and work until his death. The first painting Bacon completed after relocating to Reece Mews was Seated Figure, 1961 (61-16). Portrait, 1962 (62-01), is an important painting and is less well-known because it is seldom exhibited. It marks the beginning of Bacon's incorporation in both male and female nudes of the internal organs bursting through the skin at the surface. Since his childhood in Ireland, Bacon had been obsessed with hanging carcasses in butchers shop windows. Without question there is a strong psychological dimension to Bacon's paintings and this came from his own life and expe riences and Harrison has rightly invoked these details where applicable. The artist's relationships with two of his lovers, Peter Lacy (1916-1962) and George Dyer (1934-1971), were turbulent affairs and laden with conflict. Both ended in tragedy 402 AUTUMN 2016 VOLUME 33 NUMBER 3</page><page sequence="4">and both Lacy and Dyer had problems with alcohol and died prematurely. These relationships are omnipresent in Bacon's paintings and reflect the fact that his art came from his own life and experiences. Bacon met Peter Lacy in 1952 and he became his muse for the next decade. This complex, dysfunc tional and sadomasochistic relationship was at its most intense from 1952 to 1954 although they were close until Lacy's death in 1962. Paintings of Lacy range from Two Figures, 1953 (53 24), where the two lovers on the bed are conflated with Eadweard Muybridge's photographs of wrestlers, to the acutely tender Two Figures at a Window, 1953 (53-25). Those people who knew Bacon said that Lacy was the love of his life. Lucian Freud could not understand the sexual violence between the two and recalled being shocked by the injuries Bacon had sus tained at Lacy's hand and retaliated by twisting Lacy's collar around his neck.1 As an aside, Harrison raises the suggestion made by the journalist and editor Geordie Greig, that the rela tionship between Bacon and Freud had once been sexual which would place their closeness and the subsequent rupture in their relationship in a different light.2 Despite the fact that a high pro portion of Bacon's paintings from this time were motivated by his relationship with Lacy, in turn, Lacy disliked Bacon's art and suggested that he should give it up and 'live in a corner of my cottage on straw. You could sleep and shit there.'3 Harrison sur mises that Seated Figure, 1954 (54-04) is a direct evocation of this suggestion although the work is not identified as a self-por trait. Later works such as Sleeping Figure, 1959 (59-09) show a more vulnerable side to Lacy and the same pertains to Lying Figure, 1961 (61-17) done shortly after Bacon had returned from visiting Lacy in Tangier in August 1961. This was the first recurrence of the curved wall with three window blinds since Painting, 1946 and was a reminiscence of the curved bay window of his childhood home at Farmleigh, Abbeyleix. Lacy died a year later, overcome by his alcoholism, and Bacon received this news on the evening of the opening of his exhi bition at Tate in 1962. Bacon met George Dyer, a petty crook from the East End, in October 1963. Dyer is portrayed in no less than 10 mas terpieces of Dyer that Bacon painted between 1966 and 1968. Dyer was a destructive alcoholic but unlike Lacy, relished being Bacon's muse and for a time, was proud of the paint ings in which he was the subject showing them to visitors at exhibitions in London, New York or Paris. Relations soured and Dyer's worsening alcoholism, his sporadic suicide bids and frequent, savage rows with Bacon all eventually told. The destructive aspect of their relationship led to Dyer ransacking the Reece Mews Studio and setting fire to it, ripping up paint ings, throwing them in the bath and pouring wine over them causing serious damage. In September 1970 Dyer became more vindictive and planted cannabis in 7 Reece Mews and informed the police. It resulted in a court case for Bacon although he was acquitted. Even though the affair had ended, Dyer travelled with Bacon to Paris in October 1971 for the opening of Bacon's retrospective at the Grand Palais but before the exhibition opened, Dyer was found dead from an overdose in a bathroom at the Hotel des Saints-Peres. The sequence of paintings that followed, the so-called Black triptychs, were a true reflection of Bacon's grief and guilt. Bacon survived this tragedy and turned to himself as subject and ten of the fifteen paintings from 1972 are self-portraits. For the next two decades he continued to produce portraits and triptychs, travelled extensively and typically rejected any accolades or honours offered. One of his final paintings is of his lover, Jose Capello, whom Bacon was visiting in Madrid when he died of a heart attack. The final painting Study of a Bull, 1991 (91-04) is a majestic work, exquisitely painted and containing copious amounts of dust, its subject calling to mind Picasso with whom it all began in 1927 (Fig 5). Bacon wanted his paintings to act directly on the nerves and denied that he was saying anything stating that his paintings were 'concerned with my kind of psyche...my exhilarated despair.'4 It is diffi cult to penetrate Bacon's psychology and imagination because of the diverse range of his sources and the way his paintings evolved and were often transformed by chance but this pub lication will certainly become the essential reference on the artist's paintings for years to come. ■ Martin Harrison, Francis Bacon: Catalogue Raisonne (5 Vols) The Estate of Francis Bacon (2016). £1,000/€1,400 ISBN 978-0-9569273-1-6.
