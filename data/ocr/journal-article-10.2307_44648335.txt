Culver Biomedical Science Department General Motors Research Laboratories Warren, Ml OVERVIEW A series of barrier crash simulations were conducted with unembalmed human cadavers re- strained by a two-point shoulder belt. During frontal deceleration the cadaver's lower extremi- ty interacted with an experimental knee bolster to assess the performance of the restraint system in well-controlled laboratory experiments. The impact interaction of the lower extremity with various configured bolsters was of parti- cular interest in our continuing investigation of factors influencing lower torso restraint in occupant protection systems. A previous experimental investigation (1)* involved stationary seated unembalmed human cadavers exposed to lower leg and knee impacts with a bolster padded pendulum. Results from the experiments indicated that restraining loads applied to the lower leg could produce posterior tibial-f ibular displacement with respect to the ^Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. femur in the knee joint. The posterior cruciate ligament was noted to provide primary resistance to this type of knee joint shearing load and was vulnerable to acute injury. A central tear or tibial plateau avulsion was frequently observed in human cadaver experiments at relatively low levels of joint load. As a result of that study, it was recommended that restraint loads to the knee be directed primarily at the femur, thus minimizing potential joint shear and load- ing of the posterior cruciate ligament. A recent analytical study (2) further investigated factors which influence the func- tion of lower torso restraint via a knee bolster. In particular, the seating posture and size of the occupant were shown to influence the prefer- red location and orientation of the bolster, as well as the primary axis of bolster resistance. This theoretical investigation provided a practi- cal design methodology to study the interactive ABSTRACT Previous pendulum impact tests have shown that knee joint injuries and tibial-f ibular fractures may occur when loads are directed against the lower leg rather than directly against the femur in the knee. In order to further improve our understanding of lower extremity restraint mechanics, simulated frontal barrier crash experiments were conducted with unembalmed human cadavers and an anthropomorphic dummy restrained by a two-point shoulder belt. In the first test, an experimental bolster was specifically positioned so that the cadaver's lower leg would strike the bolster, thus induc- ing restraining loads entirely below the knee joint. The analysis of occupant kinematics showed that the flexed knee rode over and for- ward of the low-positioned bolster. Restraint induced considerable shearing load across the knee joint. Bolster measurements indicated a peak load of approximately 4.0 kN per leg which resulted in a contralateral central tear of the posterior cruciate ligaments. Factors influencing the performance of a shoulder belt and knee restraint system were studied in the remaining experiments. Posi- tioning the bolster to provide full knee contact and early femoral loading, and orienting the bolster face to reduce knee joint shear loads 38.5° from horizontal) were identified as impor- tant parameters for improved performance of the knee restraint in these tests. The reaction force vector of the deforming bolster structure 32.5° from horizontal) represented an addi- tional independent factor in minimizing contact loads and in controlling occupant kinematics. Under these knee restraint conditions, an aver- age peak bolster reaction force of 6.2 kN per leg (compared with a dummy femur load of 5.9 kN) did not result in injury to the lower extremity of four cadavers. The experiments indicated that a two-point shoulder belt and knee re- straint system can control occupant kinematics and attenuate potential lower extremity injury during a 13.4 m/s frontal crash simulation. 3358 0096-736X/80/8804-3358$02.50 Copyright © 1980 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">effects of various factors on the potential function of a knee restraint. However, it was felt that actual occupant crash kinematics should be experimentally evaluated to corrobor- ate these theoretical predictions, since a padded bolster or lower instrument panel is expected to play a role in occupant protection by passive restraint. Therefore, a series of well-controlled frontal barrier crash simula- tions with un embalmed human cadavers and a GM Hybrid III anthropomorphic dummy were conducted to assess the performance of a two-point shoulder belt and various configured lower extremity bolsters. METHODOLOGY Cadaver specimens* were obtained through the gross anatomy program of the Department of Anatomy at the University of Michigan Medical School and were tested under a collaborative program with the Highway Safety Research Insti- tute (HSRI) of the University of Michigan. Prior to an experiment, the lower extremities of the unembalmed specimen were carefully examined by palpation of the knee-joint and by a series of radiographs. This examination was performed to establish the condition of the specimens' skeleton prior to sled deceleration experi- mentation. The cadaver specimens were generally from a population with considerably advanced age (averaging 65.6 ± 11.9 years, Table 1) and with varying degrees of pathological and geronto- logical changes (particularly advanced degrees of osteoporosis and osteoarthrosis) . In addi- tion, it must be emphasized that the impact response and potential injury to skeletal and ligamentous structures of the cadaver represent only a passive reaction of postmortem tissue with completely atonic musculature. The test subject was placed on an idealized hard mockup seat guided for low-friction forward motion and was restrained by a fixed anchored two-point shoulder belt in driver's side con- figuration with 5.0 cm of slack from a preloaded 45 N snug-belt adjustment (Fig. 1). Upper and lower belt anchor loads were measured. The subject's feet were fixed to the toeboard to prevent slipping during deceleration. The barrier crash simulation on the HSRI sled facili- ty involved a nominal square-wave sled accelera- tion profile of approximately 16 g for 90 ms resulting in a 13.4 m/s velocity change. An experimental bolster structure was assembled for the sled testing and was placed with 10 cm of initial clearance from the subject's lower extremity. In the first experiment, a full-width bolster (91 cm wide, 15 cm high and 7.6 cm thick) was constructed of 80 kg/m3 density foam covered with 1.2 mm thick vinyl. The bolster was attached to a 7.6 cm thick backing of 6.35 mm cell size aluminum Hexcell prepared for a Table 1 Description of Human Cadaver Specimens Exposed to a Barrier Crash Simulation at the Highway Safety Research Institute of the University of Michigan Characteristics Test Identification Sex Age Mass Stature No. No. Yr kg m Probable Cause of Death 14 20889 M 81 54 1.61 Coronary Thrombosis 54 21033 M 66 85 1.77 55 21030 M 67 61 1.81 Brainstem Infarction 56 21045 M 47 45 1.78 Craniotomy 57 21059 F 55 65 1.68 Chronic Respiratory Disease 69 21076 M 65 79 1.73 Acute Myocardial Infarction 70 21118 F 78 71 1.60 Cardiac Arrest Average: 65.6 65.7 1.71 (St. Dev.)

C. VIANO AND C. C. CULVER constant 5.3 kN crush force. The experimental bolster was fixed to the rigid sled structure through a pair of biaxial load cells positioned in line with the anticipated trajectory of the knees. The face of the bolster was aligned at 38.5° to horizontal and the crush vector of the Hexcell backing was at 51.5 to horizontal (i.e., normal to the bolster face). The bolster assembly was positioned specifically to interact with the lower leg, thus inducing restraining loads entirely below the knee joint (Fig. 2a). In the remaining experiments, individual bolsters (15 cm wide, 15 cm high, and 7.6 cm thick) were constructed in a similar fashion as previously described and attached to the sled structure through individual biaxial load cells to better monitor the bolster interaction with each leg. The bolster assemblies were position- ed to insure full knee contact and primarily femoral loading in the knee joint by selecting a face alignment angle of 38.5 to horizontal (refer to Fig. 8 of Reference (2)). In PfiCLAZ I experiments, the orientation of the Hexcell crush was at 51.5 to horizontal (again normal to the bolster face, Fig. 2b); whereas, in Pkciòe, II experiments, the crush vector was oriented at 32.5° to horizontal. This orientation was more coaxial with the trajectory of the knee motion and applied load (Fig. 2c, also refer to Fig. 12 of Reference (2)). Because of the individual knee bolster constructions, symmetric triangular wedges were taped to the lateral face of the bolster to assist in guiding the knees into the center of the bolster should a splaying action occur during forward motion of the knees (refer m C- ~P »1 A =90 cm F =38.5° B = 22.5 cm G = 51.5° phase I C= 103.5 cm 32.5° phase II D = 77.5 cm H = 30.5 cm E = 12 cm I = 36.5 cm Fig. 1 - Experimental configuration for frontal barrier crash simulations involving human cada- vers and an anthropomorphic test dummy restrain- ed by a two-point shoulder belt. A vinyl cover- ed foam bolster was positioned to interact with the lower extremity after 10 cm of forward lower extremity excursion. Kinematic analysis indi- cated lower extremity contact against the bolster at approximately 6.0 m/s to the 0 ms, 20 ms, and 40 ms overhead views in Figs. 5, 8, and 9). High-speed photographic coverage was taken from close up and wide angle lateral views and an overhead view at 1000 frames per second. At the culmination of a human cadaver experiment, the lower extremity was re-examined by palpation of the knee joint and by radiography. A necropsy was subsequently performed to identify potential acute injuries specifically to knee-joint ligaments and/or to the lower-extremity skeleton. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION LOWER LEG RESTRAINT - An unembalmed cadaver was exposed (Table 2) to sled deceleration while restrained by a shoulder belt. The subject's lower extremity interacted with a lower leg bolster. The cadaver's kinematics (Fig. 3) revealed that lower extremity restraining loads applied entirely below the knee joint allowed the femur to ride over the upper edge of the bolster. These kinematics induced excessive shear load across the knee joint and excessive posterior tibial-fibular displacement (subluxa- tion) between the femur and tibia- fibula. The knee joint shear resulted in stretching and a contralateral central tear of the posterior cruciate ligaments in both knees as well as a tear of the medial collateral ligament in the subject's left knee. The peak resultant bolster force was only 4.0 kN/lower leg and was oriented at 34° to horizontal. The lower extremity kinematics and the level of vector resultant bolster force (Fig. 4) indicated a particular vulnerability of the soft tissues in the knee joint when posterior tibial- fibular subluxation is induced in atonic gerontological cadavers. Although this is but an isolated cadaver test, the biomechanical response of the knee joints to tibial-f ibular restraining loads clearly corro- borates the previous experimental results from pendulum impact tests (1) . The posterior cruci- ate ligament appears to be susceptible to acute injury in the unembalmed cadaver at a level of applied lower leg load (equivalent to approxi- mately 4.2 kN of dummy femur load, Table 4 of Reference (1) that is substantially below the currently accepted tolerable level of femoral loading. However, it must again be cautioned that the postmortem atonic musculature of the cadaver constitutes a significant model defici- ency which confounds any attempt to directly extrapolate these data to real-life situations. KNEE RESTRAINT (PHASE I) - Two unembalmed cadavers and a GM Hybrid III dummy were exposed (Table 3) to sled deceleration while restrained by a two-point shoulder belt and knee bolster. The bolster structure was designed to crush along an axis oriented at 51.5 to horizontal. Comparative cadaver (Fig. 5) and dummy (Fig. 6) kinematics and force responses (Fig. 7) reveal an acceptable level of control of whole body motions and loads during the crash simulation. However, a tendency was detected for the knees to crush the lower edge of the bolster structure during load interaction.

A peak resultant bolster contact load of approximately 6.7 kN per knee in the cadaver tests corres- ponded to an average Hybrid III dummy femur load of 8.6 kN, which is 14% below the current femoral tolerance level. A detailed necropsy evaluation of the cadaver1 s lower extremities indicated no acute ligamentous or skeletal injury as a result of the knee bolster restraint. KNEE RESTRAINT (PHASE II) - Four unembalmed cadavers and a GM Hybrid III dummy were next exposed (Table 4) to sled deceleration while restrained by a shoulder belt and a differently supported knee bolster. In this case the bolster backing was constructed to crush along an axis oriented at 32.5 to horizontal. Com- parative cadaver (Fig. 8) and dummy (Fig. 9) kinematics and force responses (Fig. 10) reveal an improved, quite acceptable control of whole body motions and restraint loads. A peak resultant bolster contact load of approximately 6.2 kN per knee in the cadaver tests resulted in no acute lower extremity injury and corresponded to an average Hybrid III dummy femur load of 5.9 kN. The improved orientation of the bolster crush at 32.5 to horizontal produced (Table 5) a slight reduction in the average cadaver contact load (7.5% lower) but a significant reduction in the average dummy femur load (31.4% lower) over that obtained with the previous bolster crush orientation of 51.5 to horizontal. Incidently, the average bolster contact load in the GM Hybrid III dummy tests was reduced from 10.2 kN in PflOAC I to 7.0 kN in Phcu&gt;£ II (31.4% lower) experiments. The improvement is a direct result of an alignment of the bolster reaction force which is more closely coaxial with the applied loading vector of the knee during interaction with the bolster. Theoretically, the applied knee load is physically oriented (Fig. 11) between the axis of the femoral shaft and the tangent to the knee joint displacement (i.e., trajectory of the tibial plateau which rotates about the ankle joint). Analytical analysis of the lower extrem- ity kinematics (2) for this particular initial occupant position led to the development of an envelope of favorable bolster reaction force vectors. An orientation of 20 -25 to horizontal appears reasonable for the range of H-point displacements from initial bolster contact (^10 cm) to peak bolster loading (^30 cm) . It is clear that a steeper reaction orientation, as used in the P/iOAG I study, would require a greater magnitude force to produce an equivalent level of resistance along the bolster loading vector, which is aligned at approximately 20 - 25 to horizontal. COMPARATIVE HYBRID III DUMMY experiments were conducted for the two knee bolster config- urations. For the PkciòQ, I bolster orientation, the dummy knee/bolster interaction developed (Table 5) a significantly greater bolster re- action force (approximately 10.2 kN per knee - 52.2% higher - oriented at 44.4 to horizontal) than in comparable Phctte, I cadaver tests. The peak dummy femur force averaged 8.6 kN which corresponded to no acute skeletal or ligamentous lower extremity injury in two cadaver tests. For the PhcL&amp;e. II bolster orientation, the dummy knee/bolster interaction developed a signifi- cantly lower relative bolster reaction force (approximately 7.6 kN per knee - 12.9% higher - oriented at 27.3 to horizontal) than in com- parable Phcióe II cadaver tests. The peak dummy femur force averaged 5.9 kN which also corre- sponded to no acute lower extremity injury in fo,ur cadaver tests. In both phases gross dummy kinematics were very similar to those of the human cadaver (refer to Figs. 5-6 and 8-9). However, the greater (17.4% higher) mass of the dummy com- pared to the average cadaver specimen in Phctt&gt;£ II experiments and structural dissimilarities, such as the heavy metal skeleton and pinned joints of the dummy, resulted in predictably larger inertial responses and greater penetra- tion and crush of the vinyl covered bolster in dummy experiments.

Peak upper shoulder belt loads ranging from 6.5 kN to 8.6 kN and lower shoulder belt loads ranging from 4.7 kN to 6.5 kN resulted in extensive bilateral fractures of the ribs in all test specimens. However, previous investigators have noted that skeletal damage to human cadavers is excessive when thoracic injuries are compared between belt- restrained cadavers in laboratory tests and car occupants in field accident exposures. SUMMARY Barrier crash simulations were conducted with human cadavers and a GM Hybrid III dummy restrained by a two-point shoulder belt. Three configurations of lower extremity restraint were investigated by controlling the position, align- ment, and reaction force orientations of an experimental lower extremity bolster. a. Lower leg restraint resulted in force directed entirely below the knee joint. A peak bolster force of 4.0 kN per lower leg resulted in contralateral knee ligament tears. As in previous pendulum impact experiments, the lower leg translated posteriorly with respect to the femur producing a substantial joint shear load and excessive stretching of the posterior cruci- ate ligament. It is concluded that lower extrem- ity restraining loads should be directed at the femur in the knee and not at the lower leg, which must load the femur through soft tissues in the knee joint. b. Knee restraint resulted in bolster force directed entirely at the cadaver's kneeQ joint. With a bolster face alignment of 38.5 , forces were also directed primarily at the femur in the joint. The orientation of the bolster reaction force (crush direction) was shown to have an inportant influence on knee joint kine- matics and peak knee loads. In Phase, I cadaver experiments, a 51.5 orientation (i.e., normal to the bolster face) resulted in a peak load of 6.7 kN per knee; whereas, in Phase, II a 32.5° orientation (i.e., more collinear with the applied knee load) resulted in a peak load of 6.2 kN per knee (7.5% lower). Six cadaver knee restraint experiments did not result in acute injury to lower extremity ligamentous or skele- tal structures. Although both bolster crush configurations produced acceptable control over occupant kinematics, Phase, II kinematics were superior by eliminating a knee underride tendency and by more uniformly loading and deforming the experimental bolster. c. Theoretical Analysis indicated that the orientation of applied knee load varies with forward displacement of the H-point. However, a fixed bolster reaction angle of approximately 20 -25 and a bolster face alignment of approxi- mately 38 would provide an appropriate knee restraint configuration for this set of initial occupant-vehicle geometries, which result in full knee contact with the bolster. d. Comparative GM Hybrid III dummy experi- ments resulted in very similar crash kinematics to that of the unembalmed cadaver. The dummy's rigid lower extremity skeleton, pinned joints, and greater mass than the average cadaver resulted in greater peak forces. The average peak Phase, I dummy femur load was 8.6 kN. Peak bolster reaction force was 10.2 kN as compared to 6.7 kN (52.2% higher) from the average cadaver test. The average peak Phase, II dummy femur load was 5.9 kN. Peak bolster reaction force was 7.0 kN as compared to 6.2 kN (12.9% higher) from the average cadaver test. The reduced angular orientation of the bolster crush vector in Phase, II experiments resulted in significantly lower bolster resultant and dummy femur force (31.4% lower) in the GM Hybrid III dummy experi- ments. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Human specimen experiments were conducted at the Highway Safety Research Institute at the University of Michigan under a research contract with the Biomedical Science Department of General Motors Research Laboratories. The timely co- operation and diligent effort of Dr. John Melvin, Mssr. Max Bender, Roger Culver, and Guy Nusholtz are greatly appreciated in the completion of the sled tests, which formed the basis for this study.</page><page sequence="13">3370 D. C. VIANO AND C. C. CULVER Fig. 11 - Variation in angular orientation of the femoral axis and tangent to the trajectory of the knee joint motion during forward dis- placement of the occupant's H-point (derived from the analytical model discussed in (2)). For these barrier crash simulations, bolster contact occurs after 10 cm of H-point excursion (based on 10 cm of knee to bolster clearance) and the peak bolster reaction force is developed after 30 cm of forward H-point displacement (based on a low-friction guided mockup seat assembly) . Since the minimum bolster reaction force is possible when the reaction vector is oriented coaxial with the applied lower extremi- ty force, an envelope of bolster reaction force orientations is shown which approximates the probable physical orientation. Note that the optimum orientation depends on occupant kine- matics so that it varies with H-point displace- ment. For these laboratory experiments a fixed bolster reaction force orientation of approxi- mately 20 -25 would provide appropriate restra- int performance, especially near peak bolster loading. Interestingly, the actual peak bolster reaction force vector was oriented at about 27 to horizontal for the bolster crush orientation of 32.5° in PhcLóe II experiments REFERENCES (1) D. C. Viano, C.
