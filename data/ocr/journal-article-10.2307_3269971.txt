The Christian presence in China Four principal stages may be discerned in the introduction of dif- ferent forms of Christianity to China. The Nestorians of the early centuries were followed by a few friars and other travellers of the Middle Ages; the sixteenth century saw determined efforts of the Roman Catholic Orders, and it is with that stage that this paper is principally concerned. Finally the eighteenth and nineteenth cen- turies were marked by the major impact of the protestant mis- sionaries. These stages or series of incidents should be regarded as independent. Nestorians monks who were in flight from the west had found their way to Ch'ang-an, capital of the T'ang dynasty, from the seventh century. Material testimony of their presence may be seen even now in the 'Nestorian Monument', engraved with inscriptions in Chinese and Syriac in 781;' but it can hardly be claimed that these few travellers exerted much influence on Chinese culture or society, where they were but one of several groups who were pro- pagating foreign faiths in China at the time. Buddhism had already experienced several centuries of integration in Chinese culture, alternately enjoying imperial patronage or suffering official pro- scription.2 But at the time when the Nestorians arrived, the Bud- dhist faith and its institutions were in a comparatively flourishing state, and a project was being undertaken to translate lengthy newly received Sanskrit scriptures into Chinese. Simultaneously Muslim Arabs had been penetrating into China, and although as yet we hear little of their religious activities, by the second half of the ninth century they had given rise to considerable commercial * This article is based on a lecture given at St Edmund's College Cambridge on 30 April 1986, in the series Catholicism and Culture: translations and adaptations.</page><page sequence="2">180 Michael Loewe activity and settlements in the south.3 In addition the imperial court and capital city countenanced the presence of Manichee and Zoroastrian teachers; there are some hints that imperial China saw no reason to reject any support for the material betterment of the population that might arise from their prayers and services.4 The emissaries from Roman Catholic Europe of the thirteenth century included well known figures such as Giovanni dal Piano dei Carpini (?1182-1252), William of Rubruck (in Karakorum 1245- 47) and, as is more generally known, Marco Polo of Venice, who was in China between 1271 and 1295.5 By contrast with the days of the strong native empire of T'ang, this was a period when Chinese weakness and instability had given way in face of alien conquerors, in this case the Mongols. There is little to show that attempts to propagate Christian doctrine at the courts of Khubilai Khan (reigned in China 1260-1294) and his successors were partic- ularly effective or of sufficient strength to stimulate a significant intellectual reaction. Possibly this picture might be changed or clarified, if more direct evidence were to be forthcoming.6 The third principal advance took place as a result of the Counter Reformation, in the form of an active, militant missionary policy, which led to the arrival of Jesuits, Dominicans and others in India, Japan and China. When Matteo Ricci reached China in 1583 he brought with him some new, forceful ideas for the accomplishment of his task, and he laid the foundations for a long-term strategy and the work of his successors. Particular interest attaches to this stage of Christian activity in China for a number of reasons. Ricci and his colleagues were able to penetrate to well-known men of letters of the day and high-ranking officials, and even proceed to personal discussion with some of the emperors; in this way they managed to exert a far stronger influence in China than their predecessors. Secondly, the work and attitudes ofJesuits, Dominicans and Fran- ciscans raised intellectual controversies that affected not only the work of missionaries in China, but also aspects of the Church's efforts elsewhere. In addition, the methods that Ricci adopted led to some long-lasting results, albeit not necessarily those that he would have wished or predicted. Finally there is a wealth of documentary records for this stage both in Chinese writings and in the reports submitted by the missionaries to their superiors.' In this</page><page sequence="3">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 181 respect it may be noted that at the time in question, printing was being practised more extensively and effectively in China than in Europe. In intellectual, political and dynastic terms the period from the late sixteenth to the end of the eighteenth century is of particular interest in Chinese history. It saw the final decades of a weakened native dynasty (Ming), which was eventually brought to an end by internal dissension, loss of confidence and foreign pressure; and it saw the establishment of one of the strongest imperical houses ever to arise (Ch'ing), whose administrative grasp was starting to falter at the time when the main activity of the Jesuits was drawing towards its close. As a result Ricci and his successors were faced with completely different political situations. Sometimes they might be able to exploit a contemporary loss of confidence by the Chinese in favour of their own mission; sometimes they encountered a strong and ruthless government, intent of preserving its own integrity and taking steps to control and contain the missionary effort. It was in such differing circumstances that Chinese and western intellects first confronted one another in depth. The fourth stage in which Christian missionaries were active in China followed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as a result of Protestant and Non-conformist initiative. Owing to historical developments, it is possible that this stage brought an even more forceful impact to bear on the majority of the Chinese population than had been felt in the earlier stages, the attention now being placed on the charitable work of hospitals and schools. These achievements, however, are not our concern here. II. The religious and intellectual background of sixteenth century China Early in his memoirs, Ricci wrote: Of all the pagan nations that are known to our Europe, I know of none which has made fewer errors contrary to the things of Religion than the nation of China in its early Antiquity!8 On inspection, however, it would seem that Ricci was perhaps being over-optimistic, and that the characteristics of China's tradi- tional beliefs that survived in an active way in the sixteenth century</page><page sequence="4">182 Michael Loewe were not necessarily as favourably inclined towards Christianity as was being hoped. Had Ricci and his colleagues been able to appreciate some of these features more precisely, it is possible that some misunderstandings and controversies could have been avoided. Primaeval Chinese religious belief and practice had included ser- vice to a multiplicity of minor deities, often each with his or her pre- scribed sphere of influence. There were spirits with jurisdiction over specified sites of hill or river; there were others who supervised the growth of the grain or the fertility of the soil; and there were the gods who presided over the skills and equipment, such as the oven, with which daily life was sustained. Early Chinese religion also comprised a belief in the powers of shamans who acted as intermediaries between this world and other realms, and who could effect cures, interpret dreams or exorcise evil. Similarly there was a pervasive trust in oracles and divination as a means of ascertain- ing the will of superior beings and determining the appropriate time and place for the principal actions of a lifetime, such as the time of marriage, choice of residence, and site of burial. In this last respect geomancy, orfeng-shui, should perhaps be mentioned as an activity upon which Father Verbiest (1623-88) was to comment, and which was to arouse the scorn of some of the Protestant mis- sionaries of the nineteenth century.9 Other religious observances which can be traced back to the earliest days of Chinese civilisation and which certainly influenced Chinese practice in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries included a variety of means of seeking deathlessness or attaining a place in the life of the world to come alongside the immortals (hsien). Similarly, offerings and prayers had been maintained for centuries to ensure the continuity and identity of clan and family in the some- what volatile form of existence that was China's lot. Along with these general beliefs and acts of worship, the imperial family of the Ming dynasty practised cults of state whose origins reached back for well over 3000 years. The kings of Shang (c. 2000- 1100 BCE) had worshipped ti, or Shang-ti, a supreme deity, and the use of this term will feature below in connection with highly critical controversies of the 17th and 18th centuries.'0 In the imperial age (i.e. from 221 BCE onwards) the cults of state had at first been</page><page sequence="5">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 183 addressed to this godhead or his derivatives; later they were transferred to the service of Heaven (T'ien) in the hope of acquiring cosmic blessing on the dispensation over which the emperor presided. In Ricci's time this rite was carried out regularly at one of the most numinous sites that still survive in China, whose qualities and virtues still contrive to reduce recent innovations of concrete and laicisation to their true size." This cult features as an essential element of imperial structure, both justifying the emperor's authority to rule and obliging him to do so according to certain ideals. Part of the significance of the cult lay in its link between spiritual and temporal authority. The officials and men of learning with whom Ricci made most of his contacts had all been trained in the Confucian tradition. Since about 500 BCE Confucius and his followers had propounded the view of a universe that was man-centered, each individual being obliged to serve his fellow men and to educate himself to the best of his capacity. Confucian thought saw an inescapable difference in the values and qualities of individual men and women, depending on the type of service that they could render. A community of men and women is governed, ideally, in hierarchies, in such a way that relationships with and duties towards a kinsman or a neighbour are regulated to the greatest advantage of family, clan or state, rather than that of the individual; such relationships are shaped by a com- mon recognition of ethical ideals. Confucian thought looked back to a golden age of the past in which these ideals had been achieved by blessed monarchs and their wise advisers; supreme happiness had been brought about then, and could be brought about again, by adherence to those ideals under the beneficent rule of such supermen. 12 In the society that he saw around him and with whose members he was hoping to come to terms, Ricci would have witnessed a variety of beliefs and concepts that are sometimes included, rather loosely, under the general term of 'Taoism'. The term embraces several types of mystical, intellectual and religious activities. There is the search for the eternal mysteries of the universe, which is usually associated with the names of Lao Tzu (4th century BCE) and Chuang Chou (c. 370-300 BCE) and involves a rejection of man-made, subjective values, such as those that are included in the</page><page sequence="6">184 Michael Loewe Confucian ethic.'3 While this approach to life was not marked by specifically religious rituals, its teachers and aphorisms were later hailed as the forerunners and the authority for certain religious practices to be mentioned immediately. Taoism is a term which also includes a nature-centred philoso- phy, as described in a work known as the Huai-nan-tzu, and com- pleted in 139 BCE. This mode of thought saw the universe as operating spontaneously according to its appropriate rhythms; within this universe man constitutes no more than one of a myriad creatures, being intrinsically of no greater value, better or worse, than other creatures such as rocks and stones and trees.14 Belief in the underlying, or inbuilt, intelligence (tao) of this universe which assures the retention of a balance and harmony in nature, and which regulates creation, could stand in contrast with the view of nature and creation that Roman Catholic doctrine would soon be preaching. In addition 'Taoism', or more properly 'Taoist religion' which had grown up since the second century of the present era included a variety of disciplines and exercises, spiritual and physical, which were designed to sublimate human desires, ameliorate human suf- fering and eliminate human fears. Such rituals, over which a clergy would preside, called on primaeval myth and the intermediacy of a number of practictioners. They were maintained in temple and monastery with their own sacred scriptures; and they gave rise to a number of practices which may have had a superficial resemblance to some Christian activities and which were due to be dismissed as superstition.'5 When Matteo Ricci first set about his task in China he dressed himself as a Buddhist priest, in the belief that he would thereby gain recognition for his vocation and respect for his mission. In time he was to find that such a garb brought with it scorn rather than the veneration that he sought from the leaders of Chinese thought whom he wished to impress, and he abandoned that guise in favour of the dress of a Chinese man of letters. However, his initial choice revealed that he had immediately observed that it was Buddhism that exerted the most conspicuous influence in China as an organised religion, with its priests, monks, scriptures and temples, and attention will be given below to the relations and attitudes that</page><page sequence="7">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 185 arose between Buddhist priest and Catholic missionary. Mahayana Buddhism had in fact been established in China for some 1500 years before Ricci's arrival, bringing with it a sophisticated metaphysic and ideas that were alien to existing Christian tradition. It seems that the Jesuits of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries may not have had full opportunity to appreciate the subtlety and value of some of these concepts, such as the abnegation of self, the path to individual enlightenment, the search for union with the absolute or the attainment of happiness through the renunciation of desire. In viewing this world as a mere transitory stage of existence, and in according higher priority to the achievement of merit than to service to family or state, Buddhism had long since come into sharp conflict with orthodox Confucian thought; and its relation- ship with the secular authority of Chinese government had varied considerably over the centuries. The Jesuits brought European ideas of science to a civilisation which had long been engaged in seeking an explanation of the universe that would be intellectually satisfying. The philosophers of the late Ming court thought and wrote with a heritage of ideas that could be traced to the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, and which had led to the intense metaphysical speculation of the Neo- Confucianists from the eleventh century onwards.16 In intellectual terms the missionaries would be exchanging views with men whose thinking had been largely coloured by this development in one of two ways. One school concentrated on the observation of external phenomena as a key to understanding reality; one saw a path to ultimate truth by way of meditation and immediate insight. When Ricci reached China in the latter part of the sixteenth cen- tury, the government of the Ming dynasty was marked by growing administrative weakness and political instability. There was a con- spicuous lack of confidence between the emperor and high-ranking officials, and there were cases of notorious injustice in public life." As the decades passed there developed a fear that the prevailing social and political disquiet would breed dissidence, as indeed it did. At the time there was considerable evidence from China's earlier dynastic history to show that such divisive tendencies could easily grow from China's secret societies and their Messianic move- ments; before now dynasties had been threatened and disrupted by</page><page sequence="8">186 Michael Loewe self-styled masters of truth, armed with an understanding of the secrets of divine power."8 For this reason suspicion could well be the first reaction to greet newcomers from distant lands and cultures who proclaimed themselves to be propagators of the one and only true faith. Indeed, from the Chinese point of view, such fears were to be by no means dismissed as groundless. The revolutionary movement that all but destroyed the Ch'ing dynasty in the 1850s was mounted by a Messianic leader who claimed to be the brother incarnate of Jesus of Nazareth; the Boxer Uprising of 1900 stemmed from the enthusiasm of one of the secret societies.19 III. Matteo Ricci's methods and immediate points of conflict It was no fault of Ricci and his colleagues that they were necessarily ignorant of much of the cultural, religious and intellec- tual background of the Chinese onto whose soil they stepped. What distinguished the Jesuits from other groups is their willingness to take a long-term view of their mission, measuring its success in terms of decades rather than years, and their realisation that it would be necessary to argue with some of the Chinese whom they met on their own terms, and in the light of their own beliefs, literature and history. Ricci determined to win the respect of Chinese scholars and officials in intellectual terms in two ways. He set out to acquire a familarity with those aspects of Chinese culture in which they had been professionally trained, so that he could bring references to traditional Chinese literature to bear in his arguments. At the same time he strove to impress his Chinese friends with the achievements of the western intellect. He would first win the minds of the Chinese; he would then proceed to win their hearts and their souls. In addition to his highly successful study of Chinese language and the Confucian classics, he and his successors laid considerable store in demonstrating the results of European astronomy and mathematics and the value of the instruments, maps and clocks which they presented to the Chinese court. Once he had gained the intellectual respect of the Chinese, Ricci would start to preach his doctrines, avoiding unnecessary conflict with Chinese tradition and questions of dogma that would spark off</page><page sequence="9">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 187 controversy. He would interpret the terms used in Chinese classical texts as elements of Christian doctrine where this would be appropriate; and he would hope to refrain from discussion of Chinese expressions that might give offence to Chinese men of let- ters. By this means he was hoping to show an identity of basic Christian ideas with those of Confucianism, before native Chinese thought had been perverted by Buddhism or debilitated by undue reliance on meditation as the most sure path to truth. Ricci achieved a limited success in converting some high-ranking officials20 and he hoped that he could proceed therefrom, given time, to win the souls of many more who would have profited from their example. However, some intellectuals reacted critically in a hostile manner against his new teachings;21 some distrusted the claims made on behalf of European science; and particular dif- ficulties gave rise to conflict in three basic respects: the maintenance of the traditional Chinese observances, or Rites; Chinese concepts of the principle of being; and the choice of a Chinese term to render the term 'Deus'. (a) The Rites. The point at issue here was whether Chinese con- verts to Catholicism should still be allowed to maintain their tradi- tional observances to their ancestral shrines or to specially venerated or even 'sanctified' figures such as Confucius. These rites, which could include the presentation of offerings, constituted an essential part in the mourning ceremonies of Chinese families and fulfilled the social function of perpetuating the clan and the family's identity. It was in this respect that the Jesuits were perhaps at their most tolerant or accomodating, They held that these prac- tices were permissible as they did not imply the worship of a deity in a spiritual sense, or a belief that the souls of the deceased ancestors inhabited the wooden tablets on which their names had been inscribed and which were reverently preserved in the family shrine. Ricci was prepared to accept these rites as a recognition of social origins and obligations, in terms of the respect due to human beings. This view met with a direct challenge from Dominican and Franciscan missionaries and gave rise to a long drawn out con- troversy that lasted until 1742 (see the Appendix below). (b) The principle of being. The expression T'ai-chi, which is translated as 'Great Ultimate' or 'Supreme Ultimate' appears in</page><page sequence="10">188 Michael Loewe Chinese philosophy to connote the source of activity and being. The term has an ancient origin, being found in writings that date perhaps before the start of the Christian era, but it was in the system of the Neo-Confucians, of the eleventh century and later, that T'ai-chi features specifically, in metaphysical terms, as the single principle of reality. Ricci perceived a danger here, in the sense that the 'Supreme Ultimate' could be regarded as equivalent to some aspects of the creative deity of his own faith. He sought to avert this danger by showing that T'ai-chi was a comparatively new expression in Chinese, corresponding to 'prime matter', and in no sense to a spirit or being that possessed its own power of under- standing.22 Ricci explains that he was taking care to avoid this issue becoming a bone of contention with the Chinese whom he met. (c) The rendering of 'Deus'. As part of his strategy, Ricci adopted the policy of taking over or even exploiting the ideas and expres- sions of Chinese classical tradition, so as to demonstrate that Chinese culture had originally included a belief in ideas that were Christian.23 It was in this way that he fastened on the two expres- sions Shang-ti, or 'Sovereign on High', and T'ien, 'Heaven' as evidence of Chinese belief in a single deity; both of these terms recur in early literature, in connection with the religious rites per- formed by some of China's earliest monarchs, before the imperial period had started (i.e. before 221 BCE). At the outset of his mis- sion, in 1583, Ricci chose the term T'ien chu, 'Master of Heaven' to render 'God'.24 But at the suggestion of some friendly Chinese he later tended to use the term Shang-ti, believing the two terms to be synonymous for his purposes. The question, however, was far from being settled. A conference of missionaries of various orders which was held in 1628 proscribed the use of Shang-ti except where it had occurred in Ricci's own writings, and determined that T'ien chu should be used by the Catholic church. Later on the Protestants would be settling in favour of Shang-ti. In the meantime the Jewish community of K'ai- feng had made use of both expressions in their inscriptions.25 But whatever terms were adopted for this highly important pur- pose, there was room for misunderstanding on both sides. In equating the concept of Shang-ti or T'ien with that of the Christian deity, Ricci and his colleagues were prudently refraining from</page><page sequence="11">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 189 theological implications or arguments. But by doing so, and by securing Chinese acceptance of Christian ideas thereby, the mis- sionaries probably did not appreciate how far the Chinese under- standing of a Christian God was at variance with the principle of monotheism. In time, as the missionaries became more sophisticated, they may have realised that Ricci's solution was not free of hazard; and some of the Chinese who wished to attack the Christian mission could accuse Ricci of sailing under false colours or practising a deliberate act of deception. The reasons for this confusion are not far to seek. When Ricci used the terms 'Master of Heaven' or 'Sovereign on high', he had in mind the idea of a single, omnipotent and omniscient God, with whom each individual soul could establish a relationship, thanks to the intermediacy of Jesus. For the Chinese there could be no such implication of singularity. For them there was the age-old tradi- tional worship of ti or Shang-ti as the superior member of a group of spirits; he was the arbiter and leader of a company in which the souls of deceased kings came to take part as equals. At a later stage the term ti was used in reference to five specific powers whose spheres of influence were limited to particular periods of time, or areas or phases of existence. Similarly, the Chinese concept of T'ien could hardly correspond with the God of Christianity. T'ien had started as a personified anthropomorphic godhead worshipped by some of the people of the west. In the hands of the philosophers, T'ien perhaps signified the mind that lay behind one of the three co- existing powers or estates of the universe, the other two being earth and man. While in such a context T'ien could sometimes seem to be the source of creative processes, it had no personal relationship with the great majority of mankind. Finally, however, T'ien had assumed a central part in the imperial state cult, being a deity to whom the emperor alone was entitled to address communications. T'ien stood now in a specific relationship to the emperor, and was capable of authorising his exercise of rule, or, alternatively, of withdrawing such support. The annual services performed at the majestic site of the Temple of Heaven served to strengthen the link between spiritual and temporal authority. Thus, while to Chris- tians the worship of God was a duty imposed on all mankind, a relationship with T'ien was strictly reserved for one individual alone.</page><page sequence="12">190 Michael Loewe IV. Conflict with the Chinese traditions It is evident that Ricci was fully alive to the danger of insisting on a series of points of dogma which allowed no room for com- promise. For this reason he made no deliberate attempts to define the differences between the Christian and the Chinese views of the universe, despite the risk of confusion and perplexity. That such dangers could exist was only too apparent, at least to those who are able to look on the question with hindsight. As has been observed, Ti, as seen in the expression Shang-ti, was to the Chinese one of the multiplicity of powers that were linked with temporal matters. Thus the age-old precept 'Serve Shang-ti, the sovereign on high with respect', seen in some of the earliest Chinese literature and venerated in Confucian thought,26 bore this worldly connotations, as well as implications for the service of king and later emperor; in Christian hands the precept would be a command to serve one unseen God. Similarly confusion would arise in respect of ideas of salvation, which meant very different things to the catholic mind and to those nurtured in the Buddhist faith. Moreover there was a deep gulf between a Christian idea of sin and moral iniquities, and the Chinese concept of the guilt that accompanied crime. Unrestricted use of Chinese vocabulary could unwittingly carry with it implications that were at variance with Christian belief. It was perhaps in realisation of the attendant risks that the early missionaries refrained from explaining certain basic characteristics and principles, such as that of the divine creation, a personal rela- tionship between God and man, and the distinction between spirit and substance. Had they not so refrained they might well have encountered the full force of Chinese philosophical and religious tradition in its various forms. There may be a hint of Ricci's recognition of these difficulties in the shock that he evidently felt at the absence in Chinese thought of the concept of a single path to truth, and at the failure of Chinese to distinguish between spiritual and temporal in a manner that was basic to Christianity. One further fundamental difference needs brief attention. Euro- pean theology and philosophy could hardly have started without a clear distinction between faith and reason. Ricci preached with a whole history of conflict on this point behind him, together with the reconciliation effected by St Thomas Aquinas. In the Chinese</page><page sequence="13">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 191 framework, however, if one may generalise, there was no such basic confrontation, faith and reason being accorded full scope to complement one another. Much of the Chinese intellect had been nurtured on the need to balance the demands of human discipline and organisation with a personal, mystical search for tao, the unseen but pervasive order of the universe. Tensions certainly did arise; but when they did so they did not carry doctrinal implications. For some matters Ricci could not refuse to offer explanation and teaching; the unavoidable necessity of discussing the nature and characteristics of God encountered difficulties, however hard the missionaries tried to avoid abstractions. The Confucian attitude to life was essentially this-worldly, and their intellectual efforts were directed towards the improvement of man's lot on earth. While it would be agreed that due service should be rendered to the spirits, whose existence could not be ignored in Chinese mythology, it was not thought necessary, or even possible, to identify those powers, let alone the all important concept of Heaven, with any precision. Those Chinese who favoured a Taoist approach to life would cer- tainly acknowledge the profound impact made by unseen powers of the universe; but they would also hold that ordinary human beings are incapable of penetrating to a comprehension of their nature; only a few specially gifted persons, who had attained a mastery of ultimate realities, might be able to do so. In such circumstances Ricci would be obliged to discourse on the nature of God and the concept of the Trinity, and it is hardly sur- prising that confusion crept in together with a failure to distinguish between God the father and his son. There was also a further dif- ficulty in explaining Christian concepts to Chinese who had been educated in the sophisticated tems of Neo-Confucian thought of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Neither the Chinese ideas of reality not the Buddhist ideals of permanency could conceive how a Christian God, invested with the particular qualities and charac- teristics of the present relative world, could be regarded as partak- ing of an absolute existence. Similarly the idea of incarnation presented fundamental dif- ficulties, in reconciling an eternal absolute being of perfection with personal experiences and passions that were of a transitory nature.</page><page sequence="14">192 Michael Loewe In the prevailing confusion in the Chinese mind between the figures of God and Jesus, there was room to doubt whether the eternal experience of God could be compatible with a single historical and temporary incident. The idea of birth from a virgin mother pro- voked sarcastic comment, even though Chinese tradition included in its own repertoire tales of miraculous pregnancies that resulted in the birth of the progenitors of two famous dynasties.27 Taoist tradition and Chinese mythology could certainly accept the idea of the interchange of material and spiritual elements. Incarnation of a godhead would be explicable in Buddhist terms as part of the universal process of rebirth and existence in different forms, but not as a single and exceptional incident, charged with a purpose that was to effect all mankind. To the more practically minded Chinese of a Confucian upbringing, the Passion could not be acceptable as part of religious truth. The figure of Jesus was por- trayed as omnipotent, but this concept was limited by his transitory appearance on earth for a few years from the reign of Han Ai-ti (reigned 7-1 BCE). In addition, Confucian scholars were first and foremost officials of state, whose prime duty lay in maintaining the peace and security of the empire. They could well understand how a provincial official was justified in punishing or eliminating a potential threat to the realm, and reference has been made above to the distrust that they had learnt to harbour for any Messianic movement. To some extent the Confucian scholars and officials might regard the missionaries as deceptive, in their attempt to display a justifiable punishment of a criminal as a manifestation of divine powers. The idea of an incarnate god willingly submitting himself to crucifixion was unthinkable. Similarly the idea of an intermediary engaged in supplicating a supreme deity on behalf of man would not have fitted any traditional Chinese concept of Con- fucian or Taoist origin. The Christian view of the nature of man and his relation to morality was at variance with Confucian, or more precisely Neo- Confucian, ideas. As against the assertion that man is distinguished from other creatures by his faculty of reasoning, the Confucian teachers fastened on the evolution and practice of ethical virtues as the hall-mark that separated human beings from animal creatures. Ricci however made it clear that standards of behaviour take</page><page sequence="15">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 193 second place to adherence to faith. A further obvious and deep dif- ference concerned the source of ethical values; for Ricci this came from God, by way of revelation, whereas in traditional Confucian teaching the rules of conduct were imparted by the sages, or supermen, as a means of regulating and organising mankind; as Chinese thought developed, greater stress came to be laid on the human origin of the rules of behaviour. From the Taoist point of view, such rules and means of guidance were in any case not to be trusted; for they could only be of a subjective nature, and if abused they could run counter to the principles that should be allowed to operate throughout the universe without human interference. Similarly the sharp distinction that is drawn in Christianity between spiritual and temporal, sacred and profane, could not fit the Chinese view of a pantheist universe, wherein all matter could be informed by elements of the sacred. In Neo-Confucian metaphysics there was an essential complementarity between li (order, pattern, form) and ch'i (energy, substance) which could be discerned thoughout the created world; tao, natural order, exists in many forms and is to be perceived in material manifestation. Some of the Chinese with whom Ricci came into contact would probably have believed in the moral value of spontaneous action rather than that of action determined after a deliberate decision. Ricci however insisted on the importance of intention, when judg- ing the morality of a particular action. Confucians thought in terms of the constant duty of the individual to improve his standards of behaviour, extending his relations with his fellow men so as to reach the most noble and generous pitch that would be possible. Even more clearly, Chinese Buddhists interpreted daily life and its activities in the terms of a progress towards higher forms. It is how- ever questionable whether Ricci would have seen self-perfection as an aim in itself. Christian moral austerities were designed to seek a pardon from God and the salvation of the soul; Chinese moral exercises were intended to achieve self-improvement along ascen- ding stages. A further distinction may be seen in ethical priorities; to Confucian thought, service to parents and family was constantly being stressed as one of the cardinal duties of man; to a Catholic missionary, service to God must always come first.</page><page sequence="16">194 Michael Loewe The attitude towards creation was fundamentally different. The Judaeo-Christian tradition started by asserting the single act or pro- cess of creation, and went on to draw a distinction for all time between creator and created. As against this principle, Chinese thought fastened on the explanation of matter as proceeding through the eternal cycle of birth, death and rebirth; creation was seen as a continuous evolutionary process, with no purposeful act of creation being involved.28 The Christian view was coloured by the Aristotelian idea of the static nature of the universe; the Chinese view rested on belief in a constantly operating dynamic process and movement of matter. Ideas of immortality had long exercised the minds of both cultures. In the certainty with which it held out a promise of individual immortality of the soul, Christianity was making a new departure; and with this there was bound up the distinction between human beings who are endowed with immortal souls and are open to salvation, and animals who enjoy no such endowment. Chinese attitudes towards immortality were somewhat different; and whereas some of the ideas that had emerged from even before the Christian era were possible contradictory, many Chinese were able to retain a respect for different paths to a future life without apparent difficulty. There was however a deep gulf between the Christian essential separation of soul and body, and the Taoist belief in the unitary nature of man, comprising soul and body together. The Huai-nan-tzu, which is one of the earliest writings that sprang from Taoist natural philosophy, was completed by 139 BCE. The work takes the view that man is but one of the myriad objects of creation, and that there is no fundamental difference with animals such as would affect possibility of a life in the world to come. The question did not obtrude vitally in the different concepts of a paradise that were taking shape, and which provided the symbols that recur in a high proportion of pre-Buddhist Chinese art. Tradi- tionally Chinese looked to a paradise either of the west or of the east, in which the non-material parts of an individual could take part. There was also an idea of a life spent in the company of immortal beings, portrayed sometimes in human, or in animal or in hybrid form. In addition to the beliefs traced back to early</page><page sequence="17">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 195 Chinese mythology, a number of exercises or disciplines had been devised in order to ensure life everlasting, or sometimes to preserve the body intact for the soul's inhabitation.29 Some of these practices were taken over by the Taoist religious communities, whose visions of a hereafter and of appropriate measures to secure happiness were extended in a variety of ways. Taoist thought included ideas of hell that may have borne a super- ficial affinity to some Christian ideas. However a notable difference may be observed. Usually it is Chinese thought which tends to evolve hierarchies and classification somewhat more rigidly or mechanically than the west. In this respect, however, we find the missionaries writing of five different types of fate that await the human soul, ranging from the prison of hell to the paradise of heaven. Hell was the destination of wicked men, past and present, and of the devils, and between the two extremes there was room for souls of the saints who had reached their destination thanks to the intervention of Jesus.30 For Chinese officials and writers such a scheme was essentially flawed. It necessarily relegated to severe punishment some of the notable leaders of China's mythology and history, who were regarded as paragons of ethical behaviour. There was no reason, in Chinese thought, why king Wen of the blessed house of Chou should be sent to hell for the sin of keeping con- cubines; such behaviour was in no way sinful in Chinese eyes. The doctrine of the fall of man and original sin gave rise to dif- ficulties. In Taoist writings3' about the state of the universe there was a counterpart of a sort, but this was by no means completely applicable. It referred to the disruption that might occur in the balance and processes of nature; this would be due to human greed in making excessive demands on the resources of the world and fail- ing to respect the integral part that each type of creature plays in the world; as a result there would arise a loss of harmony, and natural catastrophes. But according to Taoist thought, there would be no question of condemning unborn generations of the future to punishment on account of acts committed by their unidentified ancestors. The Christian view of Adam's fall runs counter to the Confucian view of the gradual development of human capacity, brought about by man's own efforts and the guidance of his culture heroes.</page><page sequence="18">196 Michael Loewe Just as Chinese thought had no concept of the perfection of God, so, except for a few individual philosophers, it was not prepared to accept that man is essentially corrupt.32 As against the Confucian view that man is endowed from birth with the capacity of spon- taneous goodness, there was the Christian belief that goodness could be achieved by some mortals thanks to divine grace and the mastery of their own weaknesses. The Confucian stress on the improvement of character and behaviour by means of precept and training cannot assume an ineradicable state of human evil. There were in fact basic differences in the views of wickedness. To Ricci, sin consisted of faults committed against God; to Chinese officials, guilt was the lot of those who committed crimes against humanity in defiance of the canons of Confucian convention, imperal guidance and the laws of the state. To Buddhists, an individual's inadequacies would accumulate to the point of con- stituting bad kharma. In such circumstances, there were some Chinese who were quick to question Christian teaching in regard to evil; they could not understand how the idea of an omniscient God could be reconciled with freedom for his created beings to commit eternally damning sins. There was an obvious apparent contrast with the eternal compassion ascribed to the Buddha, and it was not possible to accept the justice of the punishment of all mankind in return for a single act of disobedience. There was a further, practical dimension to this problem, in the promise of forgiveness for the repentant sinner. To Chinese officials this possibility could spell the upset of the moral and social order of which they stood as guardians. For, if taken to all lengths, the practice of confession and absolution could lead to a toleration of banditry; officials who failed to preserve the Chinese people from such malevolence were themselves failing in their duties and could be liable to the punishments of state. This danger was by no means theoretical only. There are cases in Chinese history of protests which were made against the too frequent promulgation of imperial amnesties, for the very reason that they were provocative of crime.33 It has been noted that it was part of Ricci's strategy to impress his Chinese hosts with the skill attained in European, and therefore Christian, science and technology. The missionaries' gifts of</page><page sequence="19">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 197 instruments, their solution of problems and their accurate predic- tion of eclipses produced results that were highly gratifying, as well as some sceptical criticism or perhaps professional jealousy.34 But here again there were conflicts with some aspects of Chinese theory and practice. Ricci arrived in China in 1583. At that time the European attitude to scientific observation was that of a study that would verify God's word, as revealed in Holy Scripture, and as manifested in the world about us. The purpose of astronomy was thus to elucidate the workings and powers of the Almighty; while for a time it was possible for the Jesuits to accept and even pro- pagate the Copernican theory, eventually they were obliged to revert to the orthodox geocentric view of the universe.35 For Chinese officials the function of astronomy was to indicate the cur- rent relationship between the three Estates of Heaven, Earth and Man, and to expose any loss of harmony in the universe; for them, there was an intimate association between the movements of the heavenly bodies and the organisation and destiny of man. There was a further difference in the concept of time. To the mis- sionaries this was linear, with all events leading up to the Passion, and thereafter moving away from it; to Chinese scholars versed in their own tradition, events and processes were seen to follow one another in ever-repeating cyclical fashion.36 In addition the Jesuits' idea of time was probably more circumscribed than that of Chinese historians and philosophers. Living shortly before the time of Bishop Ussher (1581-1656), Ricci may well have viewed time as bounded by the statements of Genesis; some of his colleagues were to put forward the view that China had been populated by the descendants of Noah after the flood, which Bishop Ussher was to date at 2348 BCE.37 The Chinese however were accustomed to look back to the remote mists of antiquity, without necessarily being bothered about the niceties of chronology. To them, the appearance of a saviour of the world in the reign of the last but one emperor of Former Han was a comparatively recent event, long after the most glorious days of Chinese history, and not capable of universal, paramount significance. The Chinese view of the cosmos was not that of a system deliberately created by an omniscient and omnipotent God; it was</page><page sequence="20">198 Michael Loewe rather that of infinite space within which activities were regulated by permanent cyclical processes; alternate rhythms were at work, each with its own source and exertion of energy, the fount of such energy being impersonal.38 The Chinese were delighted to welcome the Jesuits' instruments and methods of calculation, in so far as these would be a more accurate means of measuring space and time. But a possible source of conflict existed when questions of the calendar arose. As regulation of the calendar had been a jealously guarded imperial monopoly for up to 2000 years, there was naturally a fundamental resentment at the pretensions of others, particularly foreigners, to question this privilege.39 There was also room for argument on the practical side. The Jesuits worked with a professional, scientific approach to accuracy, intent on producing a regulated solar calendar; the Chinese tradi- tion of a lunisolar calendar was bound up with the attempts to reconcile several different cycles of being thought to inform the cosmos (i.e., those of 5, 12, 28 and 64); and the calendar was intimately associated with the expression of imperial authority and the management of the daily working lives of the population. V. The attitude towards Buddhism Like Christianity, Buddhism was a faith brought to China from another culture; unlike Christianity, by the sixteenth century it had already sojourned there for long. There had been times when Bud- dhism had thrived under imperial patronage, times when it had faced proscription owing to the jealousies that it had aroused. Although there were some conflicts with other religions in matters of belief and with the Confucian emphasis on certain modes of behaviour, on the whole Buddhism had been accepted as a religious society with its own ethical ideals. Chinese imperial governments were generally well-disposed and ready to tolerate the faith, pro- vided that it did not pose a threat to the emperor's legitimate authority or exercise of power. The Buddhist monasteries faced criticism if they appeared to be accumulating undue wealth; their practices were tolerated as long as they did not preclude the religious rites of Chinese clan and kinship. On the face of it there appeared to be considerable affinity between the Christian and the</page><page sequence="21">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 199 Buddhist outlook; both faiths set their eyes on otherworldly values; both sought individual salvation; and the moral injunctions of the two religions were, if not identical, largely similar. As has been mentioned, Ricci had started by posing as a Bud- dhist priest, in the hope of gaining recognition of his mission as a man of religion. But he soon abandoned this guise, when he realized that Buddhist priests as such had little influence among the court or the men of letters whose souls he wished to win. The inci- dent brings out two characteristics of Ricci's grand strategy: his willingness to compromise or accommodate so as to meet the pre- conceptions of those whom he wished to convert; and his accept- ance that, in certain circumstances, the end justified the means. Both of these attitudes were apparent in the Jesuits' attitude towards the question of the Rites. But we soon hear of Ricci's active antagonism to Buddhism. This was at a time when there were strong anti-Buddhist feelings at the court, and Ricci was doubtless aware of the favourable impression that he would create if he were to show himself as being on the court's side in this respect. His knowledge of Buddhism was prob- ably restricted to what he had observed in his travels in the temples or monasteries of the provinces; it is unlikely that he had had opportunity to acquire an understanding of Buddhist metaphysics or an appreciation of the depth of Buddhist principles. Shortly he was propagating the view that it was ancient Chinese religion that had borne a number of features identical with those of Christianity; but this original purity had been lost thanks to the perversion intro- duced by Buddhism; and this should be categorised as idolatry. He further maintained that the apparent resemblances between Chris- tian and Buddhist belief were illusory, being the invention of the devil.40 The Buddhist reaction to the arrival and activities of Catholic missionaries was not altogether different. They castigated the mis- sionaries for arrogance, in their belief that they stood possessed of the only way towards and salvation.4' Such arrogance was underlined by their failure to answer the metaphysical arguments that Buddhist priests put forward; and it was clear that they pos- sessed no knowledge of the elementary principles of the faith. On a different plane, Buddhist priests found a marked difficulty in</page><page sequence="22">200 Michael Loewe comprehending the idea of a personal God, when so much of their own discipline was aimed at the abnegation or elimination of self. They could not see how the Christian God possessed any attributes of transcendence, in so far as there were always explained in relative terms. To the Buddhist, the Christian had little under- standing of reality and unreality. On a somewhat lower level, the charge was raised that the Chris- tians had deliberately adopted and perverted some doctrines that were fundamentally Buddhist; and an official view that was some- times expressed saw Christianity as no more than a perverted form of Buddhism. In this respect it is of interest to note a pertinent ques- tion which the Yung-cheng emperor (reigned 1723 to 1735) put to one of Ricci's successors. He asked what sort of reception would await any propagators of Buddhism that he might care to send to spread their faith in the royal courts of Europe's eighteenth century.42 VI. Popular practices There were occasions when the holy fathers, so far from finding themselves in comfortable discourse with men of letters or listening to an expose of the Confucian tradition, were brought face to face with the realities of popular religion. Ricci himself must have witnessed much of this in the course of his long journeyings up and down the length of China.43 In such circumstances they could hardly have shut their eyes to some of the practices of village, hovel and slum that lay open before them; and these could hardly be regarded as part of that pure original religion that they claimed had been polluted by Buddhism. Had they looked far, they would have seen living evidence of beliefs in miracles, rites and exorcism, wor- ship of images, practice of divination and acts of healing performed by holy men. In such practices there was no insistence on dogmatic belief such as characterised their own religion; and the missionaries would have seen for themselves the absence in popular religion of any thought that there can be one and only one way to truth and purity. The Jesuits and others may well have been mystified by the popular Chinese concept of their gods and the treatment to which</page><page sequence="23">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 201 they subjected them. These were the images of a polytheistic system, retained in the home to be supplicated in time of need; and should they fail to provide the relief or the protection that was required, or to assure the success that was desired, they would be castigated; or they could be punished physically, and finally expelled or smashed. Such gods had hardly been invested with a spiritual nature; worshippers sought to exploit any powers that they were thought to possess over material objects and considerations. They were treated almost on terms of equality with human beings, and replaced by other objects if they were tried and found wanting. To the popular Chinese mind the powers of these gods were strictly limited to particular spheres of activity; there was no com- prehension of a monotheist point of view, or idea of a jealous god unable to tolerate the thought of other deities. Possibly the Jesuits failed to appreciate the difficulty of substituting a single Christian God to replace all these objects of worship, arrayed, in typical Chinese fashion in their hierarchies.44 Certain instruments of religion such as relics, holy paintings and holy water had their own place within Catholic practice. The mis- sionaries then can hardly have been surprised to observe a Chinese addiction to ceremonies and a trust in the efficacy of material objects, or the recitation of formulae, to achieve miraculous results. For their part they realised that such practices could help their own cause, and we hear of the use that the missionaries made of Italian religious paintings, or the recitation of Latin formulae to show evidence of their own powers. On occasion they would point to the incorrupt state of the bodies of some of the deceased Church fathers, the cure of diseases or the intervention of the virgin to ease childbirth.45 In so doing, however, the missionaries were laying themselves open to misinterpretation; for they were making precisely the same sort of claims that were being made by the leaders of the popular cults, and the Chinese regarded Christian undertakings of this sort as being no different from those of other masters of the occult. The success of the Catholic mission was sometimes measured in terms of the number of those who had accepted baptism and thereby undergone conversion. However there is some reason to doubt whether such converts had necessarily accepted the fun-</page><page sequence="24">202 Michael Loewe damental principles of Christianity and whether the conversion was due to conscience or convenience. There were cases when baptism took place after a convert's recitation of what he had learnt of Christian doctrine, and there may be reason to show that such ideas were at times gravely and irredeemably confused.46 There were also cases wherein baptism was administered to a group rather than individually, e.g., to all members of a family or village. Such a pro- cedure was well suited to the traditional solidarity of the Chinese clan and its stress on the community rather than the individual; but it did not necessarily guarantee that the converts had awaited a spiritual experience and conviction before accepting baptism. Sometimes conversion may have occurred after a miracle which was ascribed to the intervention of Christian powers; to Chinese eyes such events were little different from similar activities over which other masters, priests or intermediaries had presided. There were also aspects of popular religion to which both Confu- cian teachers and Christian missionaries took grave exception. Confucian thought frowned on practices that savoured of the uncontrollable impulses of a community that had not been subject of the civilising influence of Chinese society; the Catholic reaction to such practices, e.g. exorcism, or certain forms of geomancy was appropriate to what was regarded as superstition.47 There was how- ever some danger that the orthodox Confucian reaction to some of the Christian rites (e.g., baptism itself, confession, absolution or the repetition of prayers) would have been little different from the reaction to some of the rites performed by the unassimilated peoples of China's hinterland. VII. Concluding summary All credit is due to Father Matteo Ricci, his colleagues and their successors, for their determination to understand the nature of Chinese civilisation and the religious and intellectual climate of those whose souls they were hoping to save. Their initiative in appreciating that Chinese culture had its own achievements which could not be dismissed as the aberrations of a savage paganism stands in marked contrast to the attitude of some of the other orders.48 However the Jesuits' attempts to plumb the depth and</page><page sequence="25">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 203 subtleties of Chinese civilisation were severely hampered, to some extent for reasons which they could not possibly foresee or counter. The Chinese teachers and informants to whom they turned and the officials with whom they conversed were mainly officials of govern- ment and denizens of the court. They had been born and bred in the orthodox tradition of Chinese culture; and while they were most erudite in this respect, they had received no training in some of the intellectual habits that were second nature to educated Europeans of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In some ways, then, no meeting of minds could have been possible. In addition the infor- mants on whom the Catholic missionaries depended would not have been over generous in their assessment or description of Bud- dhist practice, or able to comprehend all the arcane mysteries of Buddhist doctrine. Their instinct was to conceal from the prying eyes of the foreigner the less reputable legacies of popular religion and folklore. The Chinese toleration of missionary activity depended much on the visitors' skills as scientists and on the assurance that they could give that Christian doctrine did not militate against Chinese morals or Chinese claims for sovereignty. The success that the missionaries could claim in these respects varied; the criticism that they encountered was sometimes bitter. At best, the holy fathers were able to exchange arguments with distinguished Chinese scholars or even to convert high ranking officials; and on occasion they would converse with emperors." If they won the trust of their hosts, they might be invited to serve in high places in Chinese government, and in this way Father Schall served as Director of the Astronomical Bureau in the Ch'ing court (1645-66). A different reception could await them, however, if their calculations of an eclipse proved to be faulty, or if their teachings were judged likely to stir up dissidence in the provinces. An interesting contrast may be seen in these relations in two incidents. Father Schall saw nothing un-Christian in directing the manufacture of cannon on behalf of a Ming emperor; Fabian Fucan, a Japanese convert to Catholicism who later turned apostate, and violently anti-Catholic, saw the remission of sins as an instigation to crime and banditry.50 Despite the varied fate that it had suffered over the centuries, and the criticism that it was facing in high places at the time, Buddhism</page><page sequence="26">204 Michael Loewe was of greater importance in the sixteenth century and later than the missionaries were willing to recognise; their characterisation of this faith as superstitious idolatry was unworthy and arrogant, understandable as it may have been. In their attempts to show that some of the discernible good points of Buddhist teaching had been borrowed from Christianity, the Jesuits should have taken warning from considerations of history. It is understandable that they could not contemplate the existence of another and an older faith that claimed an equally valid path to an understanding of ultimate reality; but it was inappropriate and ungenerous. After their preliminary attempts to pass themselves off as Buddhist priests, the Jesuits could hardly complain if they were sometimes regarded in identical terms, as leaders of a minor sect of the same ilk. If judgement has to be passed, it would have to be concluded that in general terms the grand strategy of the Jesuit missionaries was not successful, despite some notable cases of conversion and the considerable contribution that they made to Chinese culture. The failure was due mainly to irreconcilable differences of intellectual outlook and to the inherent dangers of the tactics that were adopted. The missionaries could not realise that monotheism is a very peculiar idea in Chinese eyes, and that in the sophisticated state of Chinese civilisation which confronted them it was bound to remain exceptional. They were misled, or misled themselves, into thinking that the common people of China would be willing to sacrifice their traditional objects of worship in favour of a single omnipotent God. However much they sought to show that the basic ideas of Christianity were to be found in classical Chinese literature, such references could not stand against the age-old wor- ship, cajolery and punishment of localized deities, who were treated almost as members of the family. By their tactics of accommodation, their tolerance of Chinese rites and their deliberate search for evidence of Christian principles in traditional pre-Christian texts, the Jesuits may well have made a grave long-term error; in the medium term these policies may have formed reason for the charge which came to be levelled against them, that they accepted that the end can justify the means. Although the adoption of Chinese terms to express their ideas could not be avoided, it was also hazardous, as it would lead to a</page><page sequence="27">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 205 restricted or a confused idea of Catholic doctrine; the terms which were used to explain the new faith could not help but evoke some of the well-seated beliefs of Chinese tradition. Some of the conversions that the fathers achieved undoubtedly sincere; the validity of some must remain open to question. It can- not be claimed that the Jesuits filled a void in Chinese religion; nor did they affect China's destiny or policies. One permanent result of the missions was the introduction of Chinese culture to the eyes and ears of the west with a new depth of knowledge; this is exemplified in the publication in Amsterdam, in 1655, of the Novus Atlas Sinensis, by Father Martino Martini, S. J. Appendix: The Rites controversy Both doctrinal and professional elements may be detected in this controversy which raged for about a century, raising doubts and suspicions from both the Catholic and the Chinese sides. The Chinese were not vitally concerned over the principle of accom- modation for reasons of intellectual integrity; for it had long been possible for men of letters to accept elements of a variety of faiths and to retain room for conflicting beliefs, without necessarily being racked by conscience. Their concern sprang from the potential threat to the imperial and social order. There was a marked refusal to tolerate any limitation of imperial sovereignty; any challenge to traditional Chinese ethical concepts and practices likewise provoked resentment. On the Christian side, the main objections to Ricci's strategy came from the Dominican and Franciscan orders, who could not tolerate a compromise of this magnitude, and referred the question to their superiors. Possibly in so doing they misrepresented the Jesuits as being more ready to tolerate certain practices than they actually were. It is also likely that the Jesuits' impression of some of the rites, as seen in the rarified atmosphere of the capital city, was somewhat different from that of the Dominicans who may have witnessed more crude and vulgarised performances at a popular level. In professional terms the controversy involved questions of the jurisdiction and control of missionary activity, as between the rival ambitions of different orders. Rome was anxious to assert its own</page><page sequence="28">206 Michael Loewe power of jurisdiction, as against that of the Portuguese Padroado; this had been exercised through the Bishop of Macao, to the advan- tage of the Jesuits. The long story of move and counter-move may be summarised as follows:51 1645 Pope Innocent X endorsed the Franciscan and Dominican point of view, refusing to accept the degree of accomodation that the rites and the use of terms for 'Deus' implied. 1656 This decision was reversed, with Rome approving the continuation of the rites. This change was due to the presentation of the Jesuits' case by Martino Martini (1614-61), despite the efforts made by the Franciscan Antonio de Santa Maria Caballero (1602-69) and the Dominican Domingo Navarette. 1669 Excellent relations were being enjoyed between the K'ang-hsi emperor (acceded 1662) and the Jesuit Father Verbiest (1623-88), with the Chinese adopting a pro- nounced policy of tolerance. 1692 K'ang-hsi's edict of toleration, declaring that Chris- tianity should not be prohibited, not being regarded as heretical. 1693 Charles Maigrot, French Vicar-Apostolic of Fukien, re- opened the controversy on doctrinal grounds. 1697-1704 A commission of cardinals sat to consider the rites' issue. Rome took the view, despite some hesitation, that accommodation could not be tolerated, thereby arous- ing angry resentment on the part of the K'ang-hsi emperor. In 1707 the emperor ordered that the right to preach according to Ricci's methods should be con- trolled by the issue of licences (p 'iao) to do so. Open con- flict was thus apparent between the papacy and K'ang- hsi's authorities. 1717 Chinese re-affirmation of restrictions and control on the right to preach. 1722 With the death of the K'ang-hsi emperor, his successors (the Yung-cheng emperor, reigned 1723-1735, and the Ch'ien-lung emperor reigned 1736-1795) did not share the basic tolerance that had marked the earlier years of</page><page sequence="29">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 207 the K'ang-hsi reign. Some measure of persecution took place by confining missionaries either to named centres in the provinces or to Peking, with the imposition of a ban on preaching elsewhere. Some churches were con- fiscated. 1742 In his papal decree Ex quo singulari, Benecit XIV con- demned the Rites: 'The Rites are not evil because they are prohibited; they are prohibited because they are evil'. 1773 Suppression of the Jesuit order marked a distinct break in Catholic missionary activity in China. 1939 Roman decree allowed for Christian participation in rituals honouring ancestors and Confucius.

See, e.g., Bernhard Karlgren, The Book of Odes; Stockholm: Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 1950, pp. 187-88; and 'The Book of Documents', in Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 22 (1950), 78; see also Gernet, op. cit., p. 193 27 See Gernet, op. cit., p. 228; for the miraculous conceptions of the progeni- tions of the royal houses of Yin and Chou, see Shih-chi 3, p. 91 and 4, p. 111 (Pek- ing: Chung-hua shu-chti, 1959); translated in Edouard Chavannes, Les Mimoires Historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien; Paris: Ernest Leroux, 1895-1905; reprinted Paris: Adrien Maisonneuve, 1967, vol.

The orthodox Confucian view tended to follow that expressed in the Meng-tzu (fourth century BCE) to the effect that human nature is basically good, in contrast with the opposite view, as expounded in the Hsiin-tzu (third century BCE); see Wing- tsit Chan, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, pp. 54, 128-33. 33 E.g., see Wang Fu (90-165), Ch'ien-fu lun 4 (16) 'Shu she'. 34 See Joseph Needham, Science and Civilisation in China, vol. 3; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1959,pp. 442f.; for the work of Fathers Schall and Verbiest and their relations with the Chinese court, see Jonathan Spence, The China Helpers,; Western Advisers in China 1620-1960; London: The Bodley Head, 1969; pp. 3f.</page><page sequence="33">China's Reactions to the Catholic Missions 211 35 For the Jesuits' astronomy, see Needham, op. cit., vol. 3, pp. 445f. 36 With great deference I venture to differ here from the view expressed by Joseph Needham in 'Time and Eastern Man' (Henry Myers Lecture, Royal Anthropological Institute, 1964; in Joseph Needham, The Grand Titration, Science and Society in East and West; London: George Allen and Unwin Ltd, 1969). 37 Gernet, op. cit., p. 129.

The Wise Man from the West. 44 Some of these gods were thought to control human activities of a limited and particular type. In this connection, there may be cited the ironic, or tragi-comic, case in which Ricci himself became adopted as the patron saint, or even god, of clock-makers, with the subsequent display of his portrait for veneration; see Gernet, op. cit., p. 83. 45 See E. Zurcher, 'The Lord of Heaven and the demons; strange stories from a late Ming Christian manuscript' (in Religion und Philosophie in Ostasien, Festschrift fiir Hans Steininger zum 65. Geburtstag, eds.
