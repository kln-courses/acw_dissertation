Schneirla, curator in the Department of Animal Behavior of the American Museum of Natural History and adjunct professor of com- parative psychology at New York University, died in New York City on August 19, 1968, at the age of 66. Schneirla was born on July 23, 1902 in modest economic circumstances. His father ran a celery farm in Michigan, and Theodore and his brothers worked on the farm after school and during summers selling and delivering celery in town. While in high school, he learned to play the trumpet, and he played in the band at the University of Michigan throughout his undergrad- uate and graduate career, eventually becoming its president. He also studied typing and shorthand and made good use of the shorthand in his field work, leaving many notes in that form. He conducted his dissertation experiments on maze learning in ants under the direction of Dr. John F. Shepard, with whom he had studied compara- tive psychology. He kept the course notebook, and the title page carried the "A" given by Shepard. It is a leatherbound book of some 400 pages, with many original, beautifully drawn illustrations, and is similar in many re- spects to the book he eventually wrote with Norman Maier. Schneirla and Leone Warner, who was also a student at Michigan, were married in 1926. In 1927 Schneirla started teaching at New York Univer- sity, and in 1929 he spent a year in the laboratory of Karl Lashley as a Na- tional Research Council Fellow. While there, the Schneirlas made lifelong friends with another young couple, Norman and Ayesha Maier. From this friendship came the classic book Principles of Animal Psychology, published in 1935. Schneirla returned to New York University and remained on the faculty until his death. During their stay in Chicago, their daughter Janet was born; their son Donn was born in New York in 1933. In 1932, Schneirla made his first field trip to the Canal Zone Biological Area on Barro Colorado Island in Gatun Lake, Panama. There he devel- oped the hypothesis that the migratory behavior of the army ant colonies was related to the condition of the brood. Later he demonstrated that the changes in migratory behavior reflect developmental changes in the colony. This stood in sharp contrast to the then prevalent explanations of migra- tion as "innate" or a response to a lack of food. He was not only an inspiring and demanding teacher whose detailed lectures were legendary, but he also found time to participate in socially 355</page><page sequence="2">356 TOBACH responsible activities, which he believed to be a significant aspect of scien- tific life. In 1935 he signed a resolution presented to the American Psycho- logical Association to "approach the Federal government immediately with a request that money be made available from the works-relief fund" to un- employed psychologists so that they might carry out research and practice their profession. Schneirla also participated in organizing the faculty of New York University and supported the legitimate government of Spain against the Falangists. In 1943, Frank A. Beach, chairman of the Department of Animal Be- havior of The American Museum of Natural History invited Schneirla to spend time in the department. When Beach left, the new chairman, L. R. Aronson, asked Schneirla to become a regular member of the staff. Schneirla always emphasized the use of the inductive method, the law of parsimony, and Morgan's canon. Above all, he criticized the widely ac- cepted fallacies of anthropomorphism and zoomorphism (attributing ani- mal-like qualities to human beings) by applying the concept of levels of integration to evolutionary and ontogenetic phenomena. The concept of levels of integration organizes matter hierarchically in levels of increasing complexity of structure, function, and integration. Each level has its own characteristics, methods of analysis, principles, and laws. Schneirla contributed to the understanding of social behavior by apply- ing the levels concept and broadening Wheeler's concept of trophallaxis, which emphasizes the exchange. of nutriments. Schneirla postulated that bonds are formed through interactive exchange of stimulation (reciprocal stimulation). Reciprocal stimulation varies according to phyletic levels; it also changes during the development of the individual, in accordance with experience. He analyzed motivational phenomena by conceptualizing ap- proach and withdrawal behavior as a biphasic process related to the state of the organism and to the intensity of the effective stimuli. He considered the biphasic approach-withdrawal process a fundamental feature of all species, seen in the behavior of simpler animals, such as protozoa through- out their development, and in early developmental stages of more complex animals, such as humans. The developmental process was conceived as a fusion of growth, experi- ence, and maturation. Experience was defined as the effects of all effective stimulation to which the organism is exposed during all stages of develop- ment. This formulation resolves the apparent dilemma of "heredity vs. en- vironment" by integrating the biochemical (e.g., genetic) level of stimula- tion with other levels of stimulation, such as social interaction and training, in the developmental history of the organism. He found making a "choice" between "instinct" and "learning" unnecessary to explain behavioral phe- nomena. Although Schneirla appreciated the field and laboratory observations and experiments of the traditional ethologists, he questioned the aims, premises, and assumptions underlying their research and the interpreta- tions of the results of their investigations. He was especially opposed to such ethological concepts as innate releasing mechanism, vacuum and dis- placement reactions, fixed action potential, and action specific energy, which he considered to be reifications of behavioral phenomena derived from the basic assumption of instinctive behavior.</page><page sequence="3">THEODORE C. SCHNEIRLA: 1902-1968 357 Schneirla saw the invalidity of the concept of instinct as it applied to the evolution of behavior, particularly when it was applied to human behavior. Among his last writings was a sharp denunciation of such theorizing about "aggression" and of the application of ethological theory to complex hu- man social behavior, such as international politics, war, and conflict within a nation. He found that the uncritical extrapolation of questionable conclu- sions from research with infrahuman species to solutions of the problems of humanity was specious and the result of zoomorphism and anthropo- morphism, as well as a disregard of the law of parsimony and of Morgan's canon. Schneirla countered the pessimism of such fallacious thinking by relying on the highly evolved plasticity of human behavior for solutions to the problems of aggression and violence. Above all, he was concerned about human progress as it came to control the environment, about the welfare of all, and for the preservation of the human quality.
