<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Examination of Share Price Behavior Surrounding the 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita Partha Gangopadhyay1, Joseph D. Haley2, and Li Zhang3 Abstract: Natural disasters can affect insurer share prices in two counterbalancing ways: (1) through the uncertainty regarding an insurer's ability to handle loss claims and (2) through a potential increase in demand for insurance and /or increase in insurance rates. Given the historically catastrophic damage inflicted by hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the close geographic and temporal occurrence of hurricane Rita, an evaluation of insurer share price response is warranted. Our analysis shows that statistically significant reactions did occur. Insurer share prices reacted negatively to hurricane Katrina. The reaction of insurer share prices to Rita was significant, though mixed, with positive /negative results being influenced by Rita's changing circum- stances. Our study also reveals the level of underwriting exposure to be a significant determinant in the magnitude of the insurer share price reactions.

These decisions are based on continuous analysis of information and a continuous forming (and re-forming) of expectations regarding the prospects of companies whose shares are traded in the stock market. For a market to be considered efficient, share prices must respond quickly to new (and relevant) information. This paper is an event study that attempts to determine whether the occurrence of back-to-back 2005 hurricanes, Katrina and Rita, caused inves- tors' perceptions of insurance company stocks to be blown to and fro like many of the objects that were in the hurricanes' paths. This study includes information on the pre-landfall projected tracks and intensities of these two hurricanes and evaluates if, and how quickly, insurer share prices responded to changes in these projections. Share prices in the days follow- ing the landfalls of Katrina and Rita are also evaluated as information on the amount of damage inflicted became known. Investors analyzing catastrophe events and insurance company share prices are largely concerned with two counterbalancing hypotheses: (1) the ability of an insurer's loss reserves to absorb the damage claims from the catastrophe, i.e., the damage hypothesis, and (2) the possibility that insur- ers, in the aftermath of the event, experience an increase in demand for insurance and/ or increase in premium rates, i.e., the revenue hypothesis. A priori , it cannot be predicted which of these two hypotheses will prevail in a given catastrophe. The evidence in the literature is mixed. The catastrophic damage inflicted by hurricane Katrina and the arrival of hurricane Rita just three weeks later provide ideal circumstances to empir- ically re-examine the damage and revenue hypotheses. Our empirical results for Katrina unequivocally support the damage hypothesis. The Rita results do not provide clear support for either hypothesis. However, we find share prices responding to the changing circumstances and news about both hurricanes in an efficient manner. Our study adds to the research on catastrophic natural disasters and to the accumulating empir- ical evidence indicating efficient reaction of insurer stock prices to the arrival of new information. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. Background information on hurricanes Katrina and Rita is reported in section 3. Section 4 describes our sample and discusses the methodology. Empirical results are presented in section 5. The final section summarizes and concludes the paper. LITERATURE REVIEW Previous studies have evaluated the responses of property-liability insurer share prices to large unexpected disasters. Some studies support</page><page sequence="3">134 GANGOPADHYAY, HALEY, AND ZHANG the damage hypothesis. Ewing, Hein, and Kruse (2006) found an overall cumulative negative effect of hurricane Floyd on insurer stock prices. Their results also show significant market reaction to the news concerning the path and strength of the storm prior to landfall. Cummins and Lewis (2003) examined the reaction of the U.S. Property-Casualty insurers' stock prices to the World Trade Center terrorist attack of September 11, 2001. Their empirical findings show insurer stock prices generally declined following the WTC attack. Yanase and Yasuda (2010) also analyzed the impact of the WTC attack. They found a (delayed) negative response in the share prices of Japanese property-casualty insurers. The response was transmitted via the reinsurance market and did not occur until after a mid-sized Japanese insurer, TAISEI Fire and Marine Insurance, became bankrupt due to mas- sive reinsurance claims.4 Yamori and Kabayashi (2002) investigated the reaction of Japanese insurers' stock value in response to the 1995 Hanshin- Awaji earthquake and found a negative stock price reaction. Lamb (1995, 1998) and Angbazo and Narayanan (1996) found that 1992's hurricane Andrew had a negative impact on the share prices of the property-liability insurance companies that held significant exposure in Florida and Louisi- ana. Cagle's (1996) empirical results indicate that hurricane Hugo had a negative impact on the stock price of insurers with high exposure, with no significant influence on less-exposed insurers. Some studies support the revenue hypotheses. Born and Viscusi (2006) studied homeowners' insurance coverage by state, by firm, and by year for 1984-2004. Their results show that insurers adapt to catastrophic risk by raising insurance rates, and that catastrophes reduce the supply of insur- ance in the influenced states. Lamb and Kennedy (1997) found that the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake increased the share prices of exposed insurers. Shelor, Anderson, and Cross (1992) and Aiuppa, Carney, and Krueger (1993) found that the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California increased the share prices of property-liability insurers. On a more general note regarding the revenue hypothesis and the corporate demand for insurance, Lai, McNamara, and Oppenheimer (2002) provided evidence of investors viewing corporate insurance purchases in a positive light. Their study evaluated the share price response of (nonin- surance) firms that experienced large, nonoperating losses. The share price of firms whose loss was not covered by an insurance contract had a significant, negative response. The share price response of firms whose loss was covered by an insurance contract was statistically insignificant. These 4The TAISEI Fire and Marine bankruptcy occurred on November 22, 2001, roughly two months after the WTC attacks.</page><page sequence="4">SHARE PRICE BEHAVIOR SURROUNDING HURRICANES 135 results support Mayers and Smith's (1982) comments on the value of corporate insurance purchases. Some studies show catastrophic events having no significant effects on insurers' stock price. Aiuppa and Krueger (1995) indicated that exposed insurers maintained their stock value following the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake. Lamb (1995, 1998) found that hurricane Hugo in 1989 had little effect on property-liability insurers regardless of their exposure in the hurricane-affected areas (North and South Carolina). These mixed empirical results are not at odds with financial theory. Theory does not provide a clear answer to whether insurer share prices, overall, should respond positively or negatively to catastrophic loss events. A positive, negative, or neutral price reaction to a catastrophic loss event is determined by the counterbalancing forces of the damage and revenue hypotheses. THE TALES OF TWO HURRICANES After passing over the southern tip of Florida on August 25, 2005 as a Category 1 hurricane, Katrina traveled across the Gulf of Mexico, making a second landfall on August 29 (initially) near Buras, LA. It then continued on to hit near the Louisiana /Mississippi border. When it made landfall, Katrina was at the " upper end of Category 3 intensity" (Knabb, Rhome, and Brown, 2005: 3) and had maximum sustained winds of 125 mph. The damage inflicted by Katrina was catastrophic. Some 1,833 individuals lost their lives and total damage cost was estimated at $81 billion (Knabb, Rhome, and Brown, 2005). Less than a month after hurricane Katrina blasted its way onto the Gulf Coast near the Louisiana/Mississippi border, hurricane Rita came ashore near the Louisiana /Texas border. At the time of landfall on September 24, Rita was a Category 3 hurricane with maximum winds of 120 mph. The death toll directly attributable to Rita was seven, while 55 other deaths were considered an indirect result of Rita (Knabb, Brown, and Rhome, 2006: 8). The total property damage of Rita was estimated to be roughly $10 billion. Track Forecasts Of key importance to investors establishing expectations about the ultimate effects of a hurricane are the assorted predictions leading up to landfall, namely, announcements regarding expected track and expected intensity of the hurricane. According to the National Hurricane Center Tropical Cyclone Reports for Katrina and Rita, the "average official track forecast errors" for both hurricanes were considerably smaller than the</page><page sequence="5">136 GANGOPADHYAY, HALEY, AND ZHANG Fig. 1.

The white cone-shaped area represents the probability distribution of the potential landfall. average official (Atlantic) track errors for the preceding 10-year period, 1995-2004. However, a comparison of the track forecasts of Katrina and Rita reveals some differences. From late in the day August 26 until landfall in the early morning hours of August 29, the official track forecasts for hurricane Katrina were "excep- tionally accurate and consistent" (Knabb, Rhome, and Brown, 2005: 14). Figure 1 displays the accurate landfall prediction made on August 26. Subsequent predictions correctly maintained this landfall point. The track forecasts for hurricane Rita, on the other hand, varied over the days preceding landfall. The track forecasts on September 20-21 were "biased to the south" of the ultimate landfall (Knabb, Brown, and Rhome, 2006: 9). Figure 2 shows the landfall forecast track to be considerably southwest of Galveston Bay near Matagorda Bay, whereas just 12 hours later, the forecast track was almost directly on Galveston Bay (see Figure 3). Rita ultimately made landfall near the Louisiana/Texas border.</page><page sequence="6">SHARE PRICE BEHAVIOR SURROUNDING HURRICANES 137 Fig. 2. Prediction of hurricane Rita landfall on September 21, Wednesday, 4 pm. Intensity Forecasts The story of intensity forecasts is similar for both Katrina and Rita. Both hurricanes were correctly predicted, approximately three days in advance, to be at least Category 3 intensity upon landfall. Both hurricanes also had a period of unanticipated increased intensity (Category 5) a couple of days before landfall and then rapidly lost their intensity. The National Hurricane Center describes the forecasting of "such rapid intensity changes" as an "operational challenge" (Knabb, Brown, and Rhome, 2006: 9). With Rita, this period of rapid intensification occurred on September 20-22 while landfall was forecast to be on Galveston Bay, which put the city of Houston in the hurricane's path. Figure 3 shows expected landfall at Galveston Bay with maximum wind speeds of 175 mph. SAMPLE AND METHODOLOGY Our data contains 58 property-liability insurers for which daily return data, covering 2002-2005, could be retrieved from the Center for Research</page><page sequence="7">138 GANGOPADHYAY, HALEY, AND ZHANG Fig. 3. Prediction of hurricane Rita landfall on September 22, Thursday, 4 am. in Security Prices (CRSP). Of these firms, 28 had some insured exposure in Louisiana, Mississippi, or Texas in 2005. Table 1 contains a listing of the "exposed" firms and "unexposed" firms. Insured exposure should be an important determinant in how an insurer's share price will respond to the hurricane track and intensity projections as well as the post-landfall dam- age reports. This does not, however, rule out the possibility of industry- wide contagion (Angbazo and Narayanan, 1996). Stock prices of unex- posed insurers may also be affected to some extent. The daily CRSP returns for each of these 58 firms are used to calculate the market model parameters for three different quiet periods. Quiet period #1 is from January 1, 2002 through July 31, 2004. September and October 2003 are excluded from quiet period #1 because at Category 5 hurricane, Isabel, made landfall in North Carolina on September 18, 2003. Quiet period #2 includes all of quiet period #1 plus the eight-month period from November 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005. August through October 2004 are excluded in quiet period #2 because several Atlantic hurricanes (Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne) made landfall during that time.

The empirical results for all three quiet periods are very similar. Because of this, only the results from quiet period #1 are reported. The market model parameters are estimated from the following time- series regression: Rit = ai+^(MKTt)+Bu (1) where Rit is the (quiet period) stock return of firm / on day t, and MKT t is the market return on day t . The daily abnormal return for day t, ARit, during the event periods is computed for each firm i as follows: ARh = Rit-(ãi+fr(MKTt)). (2) The cumulative abnormal return (CAR) for firm i, over an event window (tl,t2) are computed by summing the daily abnormal returns over each day in the event window. Z-statistics for the CARs are computed using the method outlined in Liu, Smith, and Syed (1992).

Katrina's daily abnormal returns are reported for the (-4, +10) window, with day 0 being August 29, the day of landfall.5 All of the daily abnormal returns, for both exposed and unexposed firms, are either significantly negative or insignif- icant except on day +10, when the exposed firms experienced significant, positive results. The exposed firms experienced significantly negative returns on days -3, 0, +1, +2, +4, and +7, whereas the unexposed firms experienced significantly negative returns only on days 0 and +1. All other days' results for the unexposed firms are insignificant. The significantly negative returns for days -3, 0, +1, and +2 (exposed and unexposed firms) can reasonably be explained as investors anticipat- ing and responding negatively to the events in New Orleans. The signifi- cantly negative results for days +4 and +7 (exposed firms) coincide closely with Risk Management Solutions revised insured loss estimates. Risk Management Solutions made a preliminary estimate, on August 29 (day 0), of $10-$25 billion in insured losses. On September 2 (day +4), this estimate was revised upward to $20-$35 billion, and on September 9 (day +8) revised upward again to $40-$60 billion (Risk Management Solutions, 2005a, 2005b, 2005c). The only day with a significantly positive return is September 13 (day +10) and occurs with only the exposed firms. This result can possibly be explained as an optimistic reaction to a series of September 8-12 news reports detailing a Congressional appropriation of an additional $51.8 billion in relief funding as well as changes in FEMA leadership (Think Progress). Table 3 reports the average C ARs6 for firms with and without exposure to Katrina and Rita. The equal-weighted and exposure-weighted CAR_ļ +1 results for Katrina all reveal a negative response over the three-day event window surrounding the August 29 landfall. The equal-weighted CARs show a larger negative response for the exposed firms, possibly indicating that while investors believed all property-liability insurers were negatively affected by Katrina, the exposed insurers were more severely affected. 5This window is four days prior to landfall through 10 days after landfall. 6Two versions of CAR values are reported in Table 3, equal-weighted and weighted by degree of exposure.</page><page sequence="11">142 GANGOPADHYAY, HALEY, AND ZHANG The exposure-weighted CARs are larger in absolute value than their equal- weighted counterparts, also implicating the degree of exposure as an important factor to investors. Katrina's consistently negative empirical results, daily and CAR_1/+1, give strong support for the damage hypothesis. The daily share price reactions closely mirror the release of new (more severe) loss estimates. The day 0 insured loss estimates were as high as $25 billion. These estimates grew to as large as $60 billion by day 8. As Katrina approached Louisiana and made landfall, the reports started out bad and became worse. It appears investor uncertainty increased with regard to insurer loss reserves being large enough to absorb the damage claims. Rita: Daily and Cumulative Abnormal Returns The daily abnormal returns window for Rita (as reported in Table 2) is (-5, +10). The exposed firms experienced significantly negative daily abnormal returns on days -5, -3, -2, and +7, but these same firms experi- enced significantly positive returns on days -4, -1, and +3. These oscillating results can be explained by press releases detailing the changing features of Rita. On September 21 (day -3) Rita intensified from Category 2 to Category 5 and early on September 22 reached a peak intensity of 180 mph, with Galveston and Houston in its predicted path (Figure 3). The negative abnormal returns on days -3 and -2 probably reflect heightened investor anxiety over the intensification of the hurricane on September 21 and 22. Later in the day on September 22, Rita began to weaken and continued to do so after landfall on September 24. The positive abnormal returns on September 23 (day -1) reflect the investors' adjustment on their previous reaction to the expected potential loss. The unexposed firms had signifi- cantly negative returns only on September 22 (day -2), and significantly positive results on days -1, 0, and +3. Compared with hurricane Katrina, which produced only one positive daily abnormal return, Rita resulted in four days with positive abnormal returns (for all firms). The estimated $5.97 billion in insured losses caused by Rita were much less than the $43.6 billion in insured losses for Katrina. The equal-weighted CAR_1/+1 results for Rita (Table 3) reveal a positive cumulative return for all firms, with a larger positive result for the exposed firms. Since Rita became weaker on day -1, the positive accumulated abnormal return over days -1 to 1 is consistent with an efficient market and investors' making a quick adjustment to changing news. As with Katrina, the exposure-weighted CAR_j +1 results (exposed firms) concur with the equal-weighted results and provide evidence that investors consider the degree of exposure an important factor.</page><page sequence="12">SHARE PRICE BEHAVIOR SURROUNDING HURRICANES 143 The oscillating empirical results for Rita do not clearly support the damage or the revenue hypothesis. These results do, however, demonstrate efficient market reactions to the changing features of Rita. The negative returns for days -3 and -2 provide some initial support for the damage hypothesis, especially considering that Galveston and Houston were (tem- porarily) in Rita's path. The weakening and altering of Rita's path, and the subsequent positive abnormal daily returns, as well as the positive CAR_ļ +1, is probably, in part, indicative of investors' reassessment of Rita's potential damage. The share prices simply bounced back as damage pro- jections became smaller. A Closer Look at the CARs Table 4 reports the estimation results of equations 3a and 3b.7 These estimates provide additional evidence indicating that investors recognized the importance of an insurer's degree of exposure to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. For Katrina the mere existence of exposure (the EXP variable) is significant at the 1% level, whereas for Rita it is significant at the 10% level. The reaction based on the insurer's degree of exposure (the DEXP variable) is significant at the 1% level for both hurricanes. The negative DEXP coefficient for Katrina (-.213) reveals that as the degree of insurance expo- sure increased, the CAR.j +1 decreased, i.e., became more negative. The positive DEXP coefficient (.175) for Rita indicates that investors reacted positively to the weakening and track change of Rita just prior to landfall. The SIZE variable in equations 3a and 3b is insignificant for both Katrina and Rita. The estimated coefficients on the MB variable are positive and significant for both Katrina and Rita, indicating that investors had a stronger response to firms that had high market-to-book ratios. Robustness Checks We perform a number of exercises to examine the robustness of our results. We conclude that our main results are robust to reasonable varia- tions in the methodology used to estimate the CARs. These results are summarized as follows. CARs weighted by degree of exposure: Table 3 reports CAR estimates for three different event windows. The results for the exposure-weighted CARs are very similar to the results for the equally-weighted CARs. The event-window CARs are significantly negative for the exposed firms dur- ing Katrina and significantly positive during Rita. 7Due to limited availability of market-to-book ratio and market capitalization data, only 47 companies are used in this analysis. The 47 companies are noted in Table 1 by asterisks.</page><page sequence="13">144 GANGOPA DH YA Y, HALEY, AND ZHANG Table 2.

These regression results are based on equations (3a) and (3b), where the dependent variable is CAR for days (-1, 0, +1); the independent variable EXP-, is a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 if firm j has direct premiums written in the affected states, and 0 otherwise; DEXP; is the ratio of the dollar amount of direct premiums written in the affected states and the total direct premiums written for firm;; S1ZE; is the logarithm of market capitalization of firm j in June 2005 and MB; is the market-to-book ratio of firm j in June 2005. t-ratios are reported in parentheses. Due to limited availability of market- to-book ratio and market capitalization data, only 47 companies are used in this analysis. The 47 companies are noted in Table 1 by asterisks. June 30, 2005. Return data for August-October 2004 are excluded from " quiet period" #2 because several major Atlantic hurricanes (Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne) made landfall during that time. "Quiet period"#3 includes the 250 trading days before hurricane Katrina (April 2004-June 2005). We exclude data for August, September, and October 2004 (the 2004 hurricane season) and July 2005 from "quiet period" #3. July 2005 is excluded because hurricane Dennis (a Category 4 hurricane) hit the coast of Florida in July 2005. We find that our results are robust to using different estimation peri- ods. We report the results for "quiet period" #3 in panel A of Table A of the appendix. As can be seen, the results are very similar to those reported in Table 3 for "quiet period" #1.</page><page sequence="16">SHARE PRICE BEHAVIOR SURROUNDING HURRICANES 147 Using a different estimation model: We re-estimate the CARs using the popular four-factor Carhart model (1997). The Carhart model adds a momentum factor to the three well-known Fama and French factors (1995). Thus the four factors are SMB (small minus big), HML (high minus low), the excess market return (Rm - Rj)f and MOM (momentum factor).8 The CARs from the Carhart model (1997) are reported in panel B of Table A. Again, the results are qualitatively similar to the results reported in Table 3. All the conclusions remain the same whether we use the single- factor market model or the four-factor Carhart model (1997). Size-weighted CARs : We compute the CARs by weighting the abnormal returns by the relative market value of each firm in the sample. The results are in panel C in Table A. A comparison with the results in Table 3 shows that the size-weighted CARs are generally smaller than the equally- weighted CARs. However, as in Table 3, the CARs are significantly negative for Katrina and significantly positive for Rita. Thus the results hold both for the big firms and the small firms in the sample. SUMMARY The effects of natural disasters on insurer share prices reflect the two counterbalancing forces of the damage and revenue hypotheses. The damage hypothesis is tied to uncertainty whether an insurer's loss reserves are large enough to absorb loss claims, while the revenue hypothesis is tied to a post-disaster potential increase in demand for insurance and /or increase in insurance rates. The event study presented here reveals a reasonable and consistent connection between events, investor uncertainty, and share prices. The results of this study add to the accumulating empir- ical evidence indicating efficient adjustment of stock prices to the arrival of new information. The historic and catastrophic damage inflicted by hurricane Katrina resulted in negative returns on share prices for the property-liability insur- ance industry. These negative returns grew worse in the days following the hurricane as the information coming out of New Orleans grew worse. These one-sided, negative results are consistent with the damage hypothesis, indi- cating investor uncertainty regarding the ability of insurers' loss reserves to absorb the damage claims from Katrina. The timing of the negative abnor- mal returns coincides closely with press releases announcing higher damage estimates, thereby giving support to notion of efficient markets. 8The data for the four factors are available from Professor Kenneth French's data library at mba.tuck.ciartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html.</page><page sequence="17">148 GANGOPADHYAY, HALEY, AND ZHANG The abnormal returns found in our evaluation of hurricane Rita also show the market adjusting quickly to press releases covering the hurricane. The positive cumulative return surrounding landfall is consistent with the weakening of hurricane Rita, the actual landfall shifting away from a populated area, and investors recovering from the negative price reaction prior to landfall. Just prior to landfall, Rita appeared to be headed for the Galveston and Houston area. Given the fact that Katrina blew into New Orleans only three weeks earlier, a negative response to the possibility of a hurricane hitting a populated and developed area, on days -3 and -2, is certainly reasonable. While the oscillating behavior of the results from hurricane Rita does not provide clear support for either the damage hypoth- esis or the revenue hypothesis, these results do show efficient market reactions to the changing features of the hurricane's intensity and track. When the cumulative abnormal return results are evaluated as a function of the degree of insured exposure, the results are significant, indicating that market investors do make a distinction between a low level of exposure and a larger degree of exposure. We do find some impact on the share prices of unexposed firms, indicating some contagion effects.

Hurricane Isabel (a Category 5 hurri- cane) hit the coast of North Carolina on September 18, 2003. Thus we exclude the data for September and October 2003 from our model estimation period. The CARs reported in Panel C are estimated from market model regressions using daily stock return data over the "quiet period" of January 2002 through July 2004 (same estimation period as in Panel B).
