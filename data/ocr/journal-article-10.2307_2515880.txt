Conqueror and missionary turned to individuals among the native elites to seek sup- port for their goals in exchange for patronage and alliance that would en- sure the elites' survival under the ruthless colonial regime. For the native elites, this demanded a subtle application of diverse strategies and skills in an ongoing process of negotiation with the Spaniard. The ability of native elite members to maneuver within the newly established order of the colonial regime and their access to independent initiatives were very much determined, however, by the social and politi- cal structures of their society prior to the Spanish conquest. In areas like the province of Chiapa, on the southern edge of the Mexica empire, and in Yucatan, the fall of the major centers had long since left its impact on local hierarchies. Under Spanish rule in Yucatan, for example, territorial rulers (halach vinic) were swiftly reduced to the status of lords governing much smaller units. Local traditional hierarchies in civil and religious mat- ters remained basically unchanged by the conquest, but their authority shrank to the sphere of the community.' In these areas, responses to the challenges of conquest and Christianization were likely to take the form An earlier version of this paper was read at a seminar, "Late Medieval and Early Modern Social and Cultural History," directed by P. Burke, M. Rubin, and R. W. Scribner, Clare College, Cambridge, England, on November 24, 1987. I am indebted to David A. Brading, Serge Gruzinski, Nancy M. Farriss, J. H. Elliott, A. R.

Where fragmentation into more independent units had cre- ated a vacuum, there was also more room for an intermediate stratum- merchants, interpreters, and others-not part of the hereditary nobility, to rise to power through direct ties with the Spaniards. Such was the case of the Zoque and the Maya territorial units in the postconquest province of Chiapa in southern Mesoamerica, which will be the focus of this essay. How apt were different native elites in their interaction with Spanish colonial institutions, with individual Spanish patrons, and with the agents of Christianization? Did patterns of exchange between native elites and the Hispanic-Catholic world in areas that were part of the great, pre- Columbian empires vary noticeably from those in the remote areas of the periphery? These questions have repeatedly arisen in recent research on Indian-Spanish relationships during the entire colonial period. On the periphery of the great centers, as the case of the province of Chiapa demonstrates, Indian elites were selective in their accommodation of the material and spiritual worlds of the invader, preserving (as Farriss sug- gested for Yucatan) "what was essential of the past."2 What was preserved and how far the native elites sought to adapt to Hispanic culture during the early colonial period remain open questions. Strategies of cooperation varied from region to region and particularly in relation to the distance from the Spanish towns, the administrative centers of the colonial regime. Taylor and Chance have shown how during the early seventeenth century an entire segment of the native elites in the area of Oaxaca-Antequera mi- grated to the Spanish town, where they could better defend their position and property. And the one characteristic that elite members of differ- ent ethnic affiliation shared was that they all "for one reason or another, severed their ties with their native communities and cast their lot with Spanish society."3 But on the whole, and especially during the sixteenth century, the solution for the overwhelming majority of elite members lay in creating changes within their own society. What was the basis for reciprocity between individuals or groups from the Indian elites and the Spaniard on the periphery? How intense were the contacts established? What were the responses on the part of those involved? In a recent article on the southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico, Judith Zeitlin has commented that "an enormous social distance would have limited opportunities for mutual observation and understand- 2.

Through a case study of the colonial district of the audiencia of Guate- mala and the province of Chiapa in particular, I seek to establish how strategies of cooperation with the new colonial rulers and the new reli- gion affected the lives and career patterns of individuals from among the Indian elites. I will further explore the attitudinal and behavioral patterns that characterized these elites, and the social and religious frameworks that emerged as a result of the transition they underwent following the conquest. The policies adopted by the church hierarchy and colonial gov- ernment as well as the regular orders in charge of the Indian parishes and their role in the overall power struggle over Indian lands are, to my mind, also central to understanding the developments that affected the native world. The Initial Contacts: Reciprocity Under Constraints The first twenty-five years of Spanish colonial rule in Chiapa, from 1522 to 1547, were an important transitional period. Indian society was granted a short term in which to reestablish itself after the initial trauma of the conquest and the epidemics that followed, and to reaffirm the socioeco- nomic pre-Columbian patterns of control thrown into disarray by the colo- nial campaigns of resettlement (reducciones) and Christianization. At the end of 1529, a violent measles epidemic ravaged the entire region of Chiapa for about a hundred days, taking a heavy death toll. Many Indians abandoned their communities and scattered in the woods or in other less affected communities, leaving their dead behind and un- wittingly carrying death with them.5 Between 1540 and 1582, it has been estimated that around two-thirds of the indigenous population of Chiapa and Guatemala was wiped out by pandemics, mainly the infamous Guca- matz, pneumonic plague, smallpox, and bubonic plague, not to mention drought and famine.6 By the midsixteenth century, major territorial units had gradually disintegrated. 4.

The only communities left untouched by re- settlement campaigns were the major cabeceras, such as Chiapa de Indios, Comitain, Ocosingo, Tecpatlan, and Zinacantlan. Thus it is in these major Indian centers that one is able to identify, during the 1540s, the rise of the smaller, semiautonomous, traditional framework of the calpulli7 in place of the former great territorial unit of the city-state. The structure and social organization of the calpulli were to become the basis of power and stability in Indian society during most of the colonial period, a frame- work from which the local lords derived their power and legitimacy. Their ability or inability to sustain the traditional social order and resist changes pressed upon them by the new Spanish subordinator, I believe, relied on the support they received in the calpulli as much as in the cabecera of their community. Furthermore, it was on this level that initial contacts and patron-client relations were established between "lesser elite" members belonging to the cabeceras and Spanish dignitaries. Throughout the early colonial period, the relationship between the native population and the local Spanish community in the district of the Audiencia of Guatemala was generally reflected in the strict legal barriers prohibiting the settlement of Spaniards among the Indian communities. The creation of Spanish-style townships away from the dispersed Indian hamlets and settlements was followed by legislation restricting the move- ments of Spanish colonists within the Indian communities.8 Nevertheless, town Spaniards settled in lands on the outskirts of dense Indian popula- tion centers in the district. At first, they established rural properties close to the main trade routes leading to the towns, mainly in the valleys of Petapa and Canales near Santiago de Guatemala and north of Chiapa de Indios in the province of Chiapa.9 Later, they extended their settlements ci6n de la poblaci6n indigent en Totonicapdn, Guatemala," Mesoamerica, 3:3 (June 1982), 26-66, Demographic recuperation in the Indian communities in the area probably began only in the second decade of the seventeenth century. 7, The Nahuatl term calpuilli refers here to a semiautonomous territorial unit with its own political and religious hierarchy. The Aztec calpulli, adopted throughout Mesoamerica, were organized as wards within Indian towns and were allocated lands around them. 8.

The degree of native support given to the Spaniards in the province of Chiapa depended mainly on conditions in a specific community at the time of the conquest. However, beginning in 1546-47, when coopera- tion between Spaniard and Indian emerged in political alliances between some of the Indian hereditary lords of the province and Spanish digni- taries in charge of the district, such support became widespread among the lesser elite.'2 During the first half of the sixteenth century, the lesser elite among the different Indian ethnic groups of Chiapa consisted pre- dominantly of young merchants, petty tradesmen, public notaries, and interpreters (naguatates), most of whom were in their midtwenties. Be- sides their native languages, they spoke Nahuatl, the lingua franca, as well as Spanish, and their occupational background was partly hereditary, as their fathers were priests, merchants-dignitaries, and councillors.13 Un- like central Mexico, where in pre-Columbian times the merchant class (pochtecas) traditionally filled the role of political intermediary, the Mayas (and probably also the Chiapanecs and Zoques) lacked a distinct group that could function in this unique capacity."

In contemporary Spanish colonial documentation, all elite members of Indian soci- ety in the province, apart from caciques and gobernadores of the communities, are usually termed principales, with no distinction between higher and kesser elite. 13. Colonial court records from 1547 and 1548 bring to light some of these individu- als. Among them were thirty-year-old Juan Mendonal, a principal from Chiapa de Indios, who spoke both Chiapanec and Nahuatl; Juan Omnya, a young merchant from the same community, who spoke both Chiapanec and Spanish; and Pedro Tlalicah, naguatate from Copanahuastla, who was able to communicate in three languages-Maya Tzeltal, Nahuatl, and Spanish.

During the late 1540s, the introduction of the Spanish-style cabildo in the forcibly resettled Indian communities in Chiapa contributed to the rise of the lesser elite at the expense of the hereditary lords. They often collected tribute for the encomendero, oversaw the weekly recruitment of labor from the barrios for the Spanish town residents, participated in court cases as interpreters and notaries, and served as catechists and aids (teu- pantlecas) to the local parish priest.'5 Colonial court records and a variety of other sources, including probanzas de meritos, identify some of these early intermediaries as thirty-year-old Domingo Nambino, a Chiapanec merchant, Juan Mendonal, a Chiapanec dignitary of the same age, and Antonio Mobo, a local interpreter for the Spaniards.'16 Among the most prominent was Juan Atonal, a merchant-dignitary from the community of Chiapa de Indios. Although the data are insufficient for a group profile, he appears to exemplify some more general currents of native society during the second half of the sixteenth century. Much the same can be said of Crist6bal Arias, a lord from the neighboring Maya-Tzotzsil community of Zinacantlin, as representing a higher level of the native elite. The Struggle for Political and Cultural Integrity Teochiapain (the preconquest Chiapa de Indios), situated on the right bank of the Rio Grijalva, was the most prominent power on the southeastern border of the Mexica confederacy. We know from testimonies of its own Indian rulers that it was a highly organized city-state with at least six towns within its territorial dominion, most of them Chiapanec and some Zoque, like Tustla. Other Zoque settlements to the northeast were forced to pay an annual tribute to the city-state, and all major trade routes of the region were under its authority."7 15.

Luis Marin, the city had a population of about ten thousand, excluding the periphery.'8 Under Nacayola, its supreme lord, Teochiapan included eight semiautonomous calpulli, each ruled by its own political and religious hierarchy. Nacayola's control was very far from solid. His pragmatic decision to surrender to the Spaniards did not prevent other local lords from offering fierce resistance.'9 Moreover, even before his final surrender, several principalities subject to Teochiapan had joined its traditional foes in the area, like Zinacantlan, to offer the Spaniard their help in delivering the final blow.20 On his death bed in 1536, Nacayola appointed Pedro Nuti, one of the local calpulli lords, to be his successor. Realizing that after his death a struggle would break out between the few lords who supported him and the majority who had resisted the Spaniards, Nacayola's choice was a con- scious concession to the latter. His only condition was that after Nuti's own death the hereditary right should return to his family, to his son Luis, who at that time was too young to rule.2' Juan Atonal first appears in the sources in 1543, when he was placed by the encomendero of Chiapa de Indios, Baltazar Guerra, in charge of the Indian slaves drafted from the encomienda to work in the encomen- dero's nearby sugar mill on land that belonged to the community holdings of Chiapa de Indios.22 It was probably then that Juan Atonal began to form his first network of patronage with Spanish men of power across the district. In 1545, when the New Laws were introduced in the province of Chiapa, Baltazar Guerra freed the Indian slaves and allowed them to settle on the land where the sugar mill stood.23 Nevertheless, Indians from 200 inhabitants; Acala, 934 inhabitants; and Suchiapa, 940 inhabitants.

This struggle was essentially over the control of the Indian population in the surrounding communities and the right to direct the local social and political transformations that were taking place under colonial rule. From the Spanish community, where the con- flict was the subject of public preaching from the pulpits in the town's cathedral, the conflict spread to the Indian communities. A close analysis of Indian responses shows that the Indians were well acquainted with the political feud, and their interpretations of the events are crucial to under- standing the changes occurring on the community level.27 Local Indian dignitaries were divided between supporters of the priests and supporters of the encomenderos and entangled in ever-growing acts of hostility that threatened to extend well beyond the boundaries of their community. The power struggle within the Indian community soon led to open conflict. On July 22, 1547, the feast day of Saint Mary Magdalene, the two Dominican friars residing in Chiapa de Indios, Fr. Pedro Calvo and Fr. Diego Calderon, challenged the Spanish encomendero oligarchy of Ciu- 24. AGI, Justicia, leg. 301, fols. 679v-68or. 25. "Pleito entre Fr.

Among the rebelling lords was Pedro Nuti, who in August 1546 had been deposed by the en- comendero oligarchy on the ground of disobedience to his encomendero, Baltazar Guerra, and to the colonial regime in general. He was sentenced to exile, all his possessions were confiscated, and the cacicazgo of Chiapa de Indios was granted, as planned, to don Juan Tegcapan, a well-known colonial sympathizer. By the end of 1546, however, Nuti was back in his community through the initiative of the two local priests.28 During the past year, a local cabildo had been established in which supporters of the colonists filled most public offices. However, the gather- ing at the church on the feast day also served as an occasion for the public condemnation of Juan Atonal and his associates within the lesser elite who openly cooperated with the Spaniards and were rapidly accumulat- ing power within the community at the expense of the hereditary lords. They were denigrated as "having made a pact with the Jews and the devils of the underworld."29 The strong Christian typology used to describe the relationship between the lesser elite and their Spanish patrons reveals more about the direct involvement of the Dominican friars in the internal conflict than about the absorption of the new faith in this community. The program of redeeming Chiapa de Indios from the colonists' rule was to be carried out in several stages. The first stage was to break away from the recently established cabildo in the cabecera of Chiapa de Indios. The second was to take place on the other side of the Rio Grijalva, where Pedro Nuti was to assume the position of the preconquest Chiapanec territorial ruler and to form alliances with the lords of the six client com- munities formally subjects of Chiapan, who would join him together with their macehuales. Emissaries were in fact sent to the six client communi- ties to secure their support, and the local macehuales of Chiapa de Indios were ordered by their lords to stop providing services to the colonists and to trust the Dominican friars only. Meanwhile, the two friars left with a delegation of two hundred Indians for Ciudad Real to proclaim their pro- gram in front of the municipal council, a step the colonists interpreted as an open act of aggression in preparation for a general uprising of the entire province.30 However, in contrast to what the testimony suggests, Nuti did not plan to rise against the colonial regime, but to maintain the relative cultural and political autonomy of the past thirty years.

The program was shattered by an armed expedition of the Spanish mu- nicipal council. Nuti was arrested and his calpulli disbanded, and one of the cooperating lords, Hernando Noyola, was nominated as the cacique.3' But in December 1547 a commission of the Audiencia of Guatemala, led by Lic. Diego Ramirez, arrived in the province of Chiapa to investigate the events that had taken place between the encomendero oligarchy and the Dominicans, recognized Nuti as the rightful ruler of Chiapa de Indios, and supported his supremacy. The occurrences in Chiapa de Indios and the province in general re- flected the growing power struggle over jurisdiction and control of the Indian population between the recently established audiencia and the en- comenderos. At least during these early years the new audiencia pursued the recommendations of the Spanish crown and the Council of the Indies, strongly opposing independent acts of reprisal initiated by the encomen- dero oligarchy and denying its rights to nominate new caciques and depose the ruling hereditary elite. Accusations brought against some of Ciudad Real's most prominent encomenderos and alcaldes had seriously injured the local oligarchy's authority and temporarily hampered its capacity to exercise power over internal affairs in the Indian communities.32 During the 1570s, the rivalry between the Dominicans and the Ciu- dad Real oligarchy over Indian lands in the province reached its peak.33 Pro-Spanish lesser-elite members in the various communities in the prov- ince of Chiapa, like Juan Atonal of Chiapa de Indios, were again mobilized by the encomenderos to preserve their interests in these communities. At the same time, the Indian communities' collective enterprise-the cofra- dias-created under the friars' guidance and until then owned and admin- istered by each community was now shared by the Dominican priories. Popular confraternities like St. Mary and Our Lady of the Rosary provided the framework for the appropriation of communal lands and estancias through "donations" to the Dominican order and for the distribution of labor by the friars and recently settled Spanish colonists. In the case of the Dominicans, earlier alliances and bonds of patronage with their local client lords and dignitaries proved most useful for this purpose. Juan Atonal during the 157os regularly provided the Spanish munici- pal authorities of Ciudad Real with information concerning the economic transactions of the friars in the Indian communities, such as their acqui- 31.

Thus, for example, in 1580, Juan Atonal and his son-in-law, Pedro Mata, sent a letter to the alcalde mayor informing him of two hundred men who had been exempted by the local Dominican priest from paying tribute.35 The struggle for Indian hearts, allegiance, and loyalty became a fierce struggle over land and income, all at a time of severe economic de- pression in the colony. The shaky economic and social situation in the Indian communities made it easier for colonists to purchase vacant land from the native lords, who were willing to sell, in particular, lands re- moved from their jurisdiction by the resettlement policy. The acquisition of Indian community lands, however, often met with strong opposition from the Dominican parish priests, who also interfered with encomen- deros' attempts to secure royal permission to establish cattle ranches on such lands.36 In 1581, members of the municipal council of Ciudad Real thus complained bitterly to Philip II that the friars influenced royal de- crees against them, "destroying all our estancias, letting the Indians kill our cattle and occupy our land."37 Zinacantlan: The Case of the Higher Elite If Juan Atonal represented the alliance between Spaniards and the lesser elite, Cristobal Arias, a lord from the Maya-Tzotzil community of Zinacan- tlan, represented reciprocity between the Spaniards and the higher elite of the hereditary lords and their descendants in the province.

In 1584, the requests were still under consideration by the Council of the Indies in Madrid. We have no indication that they were ever granted. In 1581 Arias was sixty years old, the legitimate son of Cuzcacuatl, the pre-Columbian supreme lord of Zinacantlan. In Arias's family, coopera- tion with the Spaniards began with the conquest. In December 1522, his father, Cuzcacuatl, came to Villa de Espiritu Santo, together with another lord, Macuychiche, to offer his submission and cooperation in the conquest of neighboring city-states. The offer was made before Fran- cisco Marmolejo, one of the younger captains of Sandoval's men, who re- ceived the important encomienda of Zinacantlain through Cortes's personal orders.39 The offering of submission to the foreign invader was carried out in accordance with the rigid and highly ritualized set of norms established by pre-Columbian Maya and Mexica traditions, of which we possess a com- pelling account in Marmolejo's legal proceedings for the reinstatement of his encomienda.0 During Easter 1523, Cuzcacuatl participated in the final pacification of the Zoque, Chiapanec, Maya-Tzotzil, and Tzeltal centers of Coapilla, Solochiapa, Chiapan, Chamula, Huistlan, and Comitain by the Spanish Capt. Luis Marin. In 1528 he led Diego de Mazariegos into the valley of Huehezacatlan where the Spanish capital was established.4' Motivated by traditional regional rivalries, this cooperation later seriously endangered Cuzeacuatl's supremacy in Zinacantlan as well as his personal safety, and he had to seek the protection of his new encomendero, Pedro de Estrada, and other leading Spaniards in Ciudad Real. It was then that the basis for a future alliance between Arias and his father's protectors was formed.42 Arias's father was one of the wealthiest men among the native popu- 38.

During the fifteenth century, Zinacantlan served as an important trading post on the route from the Valley of Mexico to the Pacific coast of Soconusco as well as from Acalan and Xicalango through the Zoque area. Besides Zinacantlain itself, its territory included six sub- ject settlements. Zinacantlain's center had in 1522 i8o houses and 400 "vecinos"-possibly referring to able men (warriors)-and the entire Zinacantec territory had 781 vecinos.43 The specialty of Zinacantlain was the production of blue and black tint, with which the Indians dyed clay objects, feathers, and cotton fabrics, valued commodities in the highland and lowland trade barter in the Coatzacoalcos-Xicalango markets.44 Two decades before the Spanish conquest, when Zinacantlan was a subject of the Aztecs, its market served Aztec pochtecas, and by 1545, Zinacan- tlan's weekly market (tianguis) had regained its status as the largest in the province after that of Ciudad Real.45 His prosperity from trading with the neighboring Indian communi- ties, with Spaniards in Zinacantlain's market, in Ciudad Real, and even with the distant Valley of Mexico enabled Cuzcacuatl to repay his Spanish patrons for their protection. In times of agricultural shortages, he offered them scarce provisions and even money; during major Catholic feasts, he presented them with gifts.46 Thus, Cuzcacuatl, as would later generations of Hispanicized Indians, tried to reinforce his posture as an ally of the Spaniards rather than as their inferior dependent.47 43. The six subject towns were: Chiacitepeque, 2o houses and 6o vecinos; Maycuchute- peque, 40 houses and 8o vecinos; Xicaltenango, 25 houses and 83 vecinos; Anqueytepeque, 4o houses and 6o vecinos; Tultepeque, 2i houses and 38 vecinos; Ochiatulita, io houses and 10 vecinos.

The major prestige items traded in Zinacantldn's market were amber from Simajovel, the commerce of which was exclusively in the hands of Zinacantec and Zoque merchants, and salt. The salt works to the north of the community, near Ixtapa, were shared at the time with mer- chants from Chiapa de Indios, one of whom was possibly Juan Atonal. Other principal items traded by Zinacantldn were cotton cloth (mantas) and cacao beans from the Pacific slopes.

The conflict that erupted between the friars and the encomendero resulted in a Spanish raid on the community on Christmas Day 1546.49 Confronted with continuous opposition inside Zinacantlan, Arias was obliged to extend his political and social alliances with the Spaniards. By 1580, three of his closest Spanish patrons in Ciudad Real, besides his encomendero, were Lorenzo de Menzes, one of the first conquerors and settlers in the town; Diego de Trejo, one of the town's regidores; and Sancho Solorzano, an honorary resident of the town and a regular visitor to Zinacantlan, who had trade contacts with Arias.i0 Like Juan Atonal of Chiapa de Indios, Arias also kept close working relations with the munici- pal council of Ciudad Real. Thus, for example, on January 13, 1580, he paid 561 tostones for eleven horses offered at public auction by the council in the town's main square; these were divided between the alcalde mayor and Lic. Antonio de Collecos, the town's prosecutor.5' Arias's involvement with the Spanish community no doubt required a greater commitment than that required of the lesser elite members such as Juan Atonal. In 1556, he was asked by his Spanish patrons to participate together with an army of Indians in the first expedition of the oidor Pedro Ramirez de Quifiones to the still unsubjugated Lacandon and Pochutla re- gions. Testimonies given on his behalf stressed his military initiative and ability, yet only in 1573, seventeen years after his participation in the mili- tary expedition, was Arias exempted by his encomendero and Cristobal de Axcoeta, an oidor of the Audiencia of Guatemala, from paying tribute, and by then he was in any case close to reservado status.52 Indios, who in December 1590 had been granted full liberties to exercise his authority and powers over all the community's calpulli and its estancias.

Such accommodation and the adoption of Spanish cultural paradigms alienated the bulk of the native population from the Hispani- cized Indians and strongly affected their access to power within their own communities. This alienation, however, was soon to serve as catalyst for the molding of a group identity among members of the Hispanicized elite in the province of Chiapa that crossed geographical and ethnic lines. The Religious Facet of Accommodation Strategies of reciprocity with the Spanish colonial rulers adopted by mem- bers of the Indian elites in the province of Chiapa on the political, eco- nomic, and social levels during this period also resonated in the religious sphere, where the degree of assimilation of Catholicism depended signifi- cantly on local needs and traditional structures. The religious organization and practices of Indian communities in the province provide numerous examples of the conflict that typically accompanied the process of accom- modation among the native elites. During the 1570s and 158os, within Indian parishes, the constant shift of traditional practices from the limits of the calpulli to the community's center, the cabecera, meant that these practices often remained insepa- rable from the living reality of the native society. The reading of the sacred books of the community, the recitation of traditional chants, and the performance of ritual dances accompanied by the wearing of masks and feathers during major Catholic feast days rivaled the celebration of mass and participation in the Eucharist. The miracle of the Host was challenged by the miracles of the principal deities still venerated in hid- den locations, where they spoke through the deity impersonators. The performance of healing ceremonies by the patrilineal group elders and the efficacy of their sorcery continually tempted the Indians away from the miraculous powers of the saints in the local church.53 The ability of the parish priest to confront this deviance was weak, since he could seldom distinguish between mere popular practices or superstitions and outright la dicha puente."

Incantations, divinations, the wearing of masks on feast days, the blessing of the fields, the enacting of popular myths and legends, and the practice of sorcery were often perceived by the inexperienced parish priest as popular practices that could be understood within the penumbra of lay piety. The constant crisis within the Indian community and the conflictive nature of reciprocity with the Spaniards led many among the local elites to seek a common ritual framework as answer to the personal distress of those caught between two worlds. Pious devotion to the powerful Catholic saints of their patrons could provide neither the sense of protection nor the solidarity that they sought. Moreover, the solution no longer lay in follow- ing pre-Columbian traditions. They turned instead to a syncretist practice within the recently established framework of the Indian cofradia.54 The Indian Cofradia in Early Colonial Perspective What we know of the nature of the Indian cofradia in the district of the audiencia of Guatemala comes primarily from sources related to the first and second decades of the seventeenth century, when cofradfas became especially widespread in the Indian communities. A few dispersed ac- counts from the last decades of the sixteenth century indicate that when the first cofradias were founded in the Indian parishes during the 156os, the church considered them not only effective social and religious mecha- nisms to control idolatry and superstition, but also catalysts for the de- velopment of communal property such as livestock ranches, cotton fields, and other means by which the Indian community increased its economic independence. The cofradias soon proved to be particularly useful for the institutionalization of charity and welfare, for financing public offices and feasts, for burying the dead, and for recruiting men for collective labor.55 54. On the dual religious practice in the Maya communities during the colonial period, see Farriss, Maya Society, 317-318, and Francisco de Solano y Perez-Lila, Los mayas del siglo XVIII: Pervivencia y transformaci6n de la sociedad indigena guatemalteca durante la administraci6n borb6nica (Madrid, 1974), 372-376. 55. Early in i6i6, Fr. Juan Zapata, the bishop of Chiapa, published a decree calling for the establishment of cofradias in every Indian community in the bishopric to augment the Indians' knowledge of the sacraments. During Lent of 1617, the decree was approved by the Dominican provincial chapter in Chiapa. Fr. Juan Zapata to the crown, Apr. 28, 1617, AGI, Guatemala, leg. 173.

By the middle of the seventeenth century, at least some offices had become hereditary, lim- ited to the wealthy and prestigious members of the community and their sons. Offices in the cofradia, especially the office of the patron, became a source of wealth as well as of social and political status. In the lowlands of Chiapa and Guatemala, the patrons would often allocate lands for the cul- tivation of maize and cacao, the harvests being distributed to the cofradia members, the community, and the patron himself.56 According to Thomas Gage, the patrons of the cofradfas manufactured images of their favorite saints and founded shrines in their houses that attracted a local clientele, whose donations would be transferred to the parish priest. However, the patron kept fees charged for particular family services, such as the burial of the dead or masses for the souls of the deceased.57 As early as the 1570s, the church and the colonial government in the district of the audiencia of Guatemala became increasingly concerned over indications of the improper use of the cofradias and the spread of heresy within them. As a result, both the ecclesiastical and the secular arms moved to limit the relative independence of the cofradifas through ordinances that confined the number of annual feasts celebrated by the cofradias to the feast of the local patron saint, Easter, and vespers on the day of Corpus Christi.58 The Elite Cofradia of the Twelve Apostles: Group Identity and Ritual The elite Cofradia of the Twelve Apostles in the province of Chiapa was probably founded by Juan Atonal during the mid-L57os in Chiapa de Indios. Preliminary contacts for the establishment of this cofradia were made between Juan Atonal and Cristobal Arias and the latter's associ- Several scholars have questioned the role of the cofradia, for it served both as a purely religious institution and as an economic mechanism for the promotion of the Indian com- munity's self-subsistence.

By 1584, the Cofradia of the Twelve Apostles included between fif- teen and twenty active members in Chiapa de Indios alone, besides Juan Atonal's son, Cristobal; elite members from the six client communities of Chiapa de Indios; dignitaries from the Maya-Tzotzil community of Zinacantlan and Zoque community of Ocotepeque, from the Maya-Tzeltal community of Ocosingo, and from the Maya-Tzeltal communities of the tierra caliente.60 In structure and essence the Cofradia of the Twelve Apostles was a Hispanic framework for group identity that strengthened existing ties between closely related individuals of the Indian higher and lesser elites of diverse ethno-linguistic affiliations in the province of Chiapa. It also created a new form of alliance among its members, based on the ritual kinship of compadrazgo. The brotherhood lodge was founded by Juan Atonal in one of his households in the client community of Suchiapa, possibly to avoid con- stant surveillance by the Dominican priests who resided in Chiapa de Indios. In Suchiapa, a shrine was erected in honor of the Chiapanec high god, Maviti, whose anthropomorphic figure was worshipped along with such popular Catholic images as Our Lady of the Rosary, venerated in Chiapa de Indios.6' In the cofradia Juan Atonal nominated ten of the mem- bers, besides himself and his son, to officiate as priestly mayordomos, each named after one of the Apostles. These twelve embodied the sky gods of the Chiapanec cosmology. Apart from the twelve men, a ritualistic role was also given to two women priests, who were named after the venerated St. Mary and St. Mary Magdalene and acted as earth goddesses in charge of fecundity.62 59.

After they had studied the native languages and oral traditions, the mendicant parish priests labored to replace characteristics intrinsic to local deities with virtues attributed to the patron saints who were introduced in each of the parishes. But the friars' teachings frequently assumed another form, shape, and mean- ing when translated into local cosmology. A Maya myth from the Tzeltal community of Oxchuc in the province of Chiapa, for example, relates how the old terrestrial deity, impersonated by Antichrist, was defeated by the patron saint of the community, St. Thomas, and left in a remote vol- cano tied to one of the four pillars of the earth. The patron saint is later described emerging from the volcano accompanied by Ku Ch'ul Chan, the Maya Tzeltal version of Quetzalcoatl, the benevolent sky deity, who showed him the way to the community church. This myth suggests a com- promise reached by the Maya deities and the patron saints, rather than the superimposition of the latter upon the former.63 In most of the Indian parishes in the province of Chiapa, the grad- ual transformation and fusion led at first to the emergence of two parallel religious systems: the autochthonous ritual, with its regional high god and patrilineage and calpulli deities, venerated in the traditional caves, moun- tain tops, and water holes, and the public cult of the Catholic saints in the local church.64 In comparison, the ritual of the Cofradia of the Twelve Apostles transcended the obvious demarcation between the two religious spheres, and therefore may represent a more advanced stage of fusion of the two religious systems. The cofradia's unique development caught the attention of the church and the colonial government. The Bishop's Visitation: The Response of the Church. Early in Feb- ruary 1585, Fr. Pedro de Feria, the Dominican bishop of Chiapa, sent a memorial to the third Mexican provincial synod in Mexico City in which he described a visitation he had made the previous September to the Indian parishes of Chiapa de Indios and Suchiapa, where a hereti- cal cofradia known as the Twelve Apostles was unearthed. The heresy of this particular cofradia, according to the bishop, "was spreading fast, like 63. On the Dominican friars' influence over religious change in Chiapa de Indios during this period, see, for example, Ximenez, Historia, book 1, chapter 49. The myth of Antichrist is told in the communities of Oxchuc, Cancuc, and Chanal in Chiapa (my own fieldwork, 1980-82). 64.

The second generation to be Christianized, they were brought up by the church. Some of them had even served as cate- chists and aids to the priests, and they had been administered the sacra- ments of confirmation, communion, and confession for the past thirty-nine years, as the bishop noted in his memorial. In short, they were the most prestigious group to emerge as a product of evangelization in the district of Guatemala. The discovery of their deviance therefore aroused disbelief and indignation among the parish priests and the bishop. Bishop Feria's memorial emphasizes acts of blasphemy against Chris- tianity and a deliberate subversion of the new faith that derived not from ignorance, as was usually the case with Indian idolaters, but from spite and malice.66 The bishop had been well aware for some time of the ambiva- lence and inconsistency present in his own order and among the Mexican bishops regarding the measures that should be adopted against Indian religious deviance. The need for a firm hand and stricter measures had been acknowledged four years earlier by Fr. Alfonso de Vargas, the parish priest of the Maya-Tzeltal community of Ocosingo, who warned in a letter of the spread of heresy in the bishopric and placed the blame directly on his Dominican predecessors who had done little to combat deviance in their parishes.67 The unique case of the Cofradia of the Twelve Apostles was an oppor- tunity for the bishop and other hardline Dominicans to initiate new debate on the neophytic status enjoyed by the Indians until then. In order to corroborate his case of heresy before the Mexican synod, Bishop Feria in his memorial applied the typology used during that period in Spain to de- 65.

He spoke Spanish, was well acquainted with Hispanic culture, and as a consequence was well assimilated into Christianity. By the second half of the seventeenth century, the designation ladino applied to all castes. 66.

He therefore remarked in his memorial that the ritual contexts of this particular cofradia "seem to resemble those of the Alumbrado sects." The denial of confession, the be- lief in an alternative, direct form of divine revelation, the rejection of the sacrament of communion, and "simple fornication" were the most substan- tial accusations presented against the cofradia's leaders, similar to those found in contemporaneous Inquisitorial court records concerning the sects of the Alumbrados.68 When he wrote his memorial, Bishop Feria also had in mind the resolutions of the first Mexican provincial council of 1555, which recommended punitive actions against Indian idolaters similar to those forced upon heretics and apostates in Europe.69 He was convinced that the case of this elite cofradia would influence the synod to revive the policy of 1555. In the middle of September 1584, when Bishop Feria visited Chiapa de Indios and the neighboring communities, Juan Atonal and his son had been away in the town of Santiago de Guatemala. Anticipating the grave results that might arise once the bishop's visitation ended and the exis- tence of the syncretist cofradia was revealed, Juan Atonal provided the president of the audiencia, Garcia Valverde, with a full report in justi- fication of his and his associates' activities. Like other members of the cofradia, Juan Atonal was well aware of the strong protection he enjoyed from the secular arm of the district and was fully prepared to use it. Only a few months earlier, the alcalde mayor of Chiapa instructed the corregi- dor of Chiapa de Indios to pressure the local cabildo to elect Pedro Mata, Atonal's son-in-law, the next alcalde of the community-an event de- layed by the developments of September 1584. Following the bishop's visitation (and Atonal's report), President Valverde issued a special order prohibiting Fr. Pedro Barrientos, the parish priest, and his fellow friars from proceeding against the accused. In so doing the president quoted a bull of Pope Gregory XIII declaring that "in the New World, the bishops retained the duty to absolve the Indian neophytes of any sins committed against the Christian faith."70 68.

Soon afterward members of the cofradia were arrested by the Dominican friars, put in stocks, and prepared to stand trial in Santiago de Guatemala. In Chiapa de Indios and Suchiapa the cofradia members were placed in stocks facing a crowd in the commu- nity square and forced to make public penance. The cofradia's principal image of Maviti was then broken into small pieces by the parish priest, Barrientos, and cast into the fire where it turned to ashes.7' One reason for the eagerness with which many among the native popu- lation collaborated with the friars against the cofradia can doubtless be found in the hostility stretching back to the 1540s between the Hispani- cized Indians of the cofradia, Juan Atonal in particular, and the traditional hierarchy of the community. The Indian community was willing to sacrifice its unfavored members to protect the entire community from the persecu- tion of the church. Very similar responses had been recorded during the campaign of Diego de Landa and the Franciscans to extirpate idolatry in Yucatan.72 The Response of the Colonial Government and the Issue of Assimila- tion. The trial in Santiago de Guatemala never took place, for the cofradia's leaders were released through a decree of the Audiencia and sent back to their communities. Five months later, on January i, 1585, the day of the New Year's elections for the local cabildo of Chiapa de Indios, Juan Atonal was elected alcalde and his son, Cristobal, regidor through the direct intervention of the Spanish encomendero oligarchy in Ciudad Real and the corregidor of Chiapa de Indios.7 In the rest of the Indian commu- nities in the province, leaders and members of the cofradia also took their places in the local political scene. The way in which the Audiencia of Guatemala chose to treat the cofra- dia's leaders can be understood only if we take into consideration the ongoing power struggle between church and state-the mendicant orders and the colonial government-for hegemony over the Indians. In this con- flict, which went on until the 1590s, Hispanicized Indian elites in the province, as we have seen, played a major part as guardians of the interests 71.

Furthermore, President Valverde and other members of the Audiencia regarded the Hispanicized elites as the vanguard in the process of assimilating Indians into a homoge- nized Hispanic colonial society. Contemporary programs for this assimi- lation drawn up by members of the Audiencia of Guatemala had existed for some time. According to them, Indian society would become His- panic only when the Spanish language and Spanish material culture were adopted, and ultimately through marriage between the two races.74 In 1582, President Valverde himself presented a similar program to Philip II in which he described how educating the Indians alongside the Spaniards would allow them to partake in a society of "proper human discipline" and eventually would lead to the mixing of the two races.75 In 1640, the Audiencia of Guatemala was still applying a variety of means to persuade the Indians to assimilate Spanish into every aspect of community life, especially by associating it with social and political mo- bility. Those who spoke Spanish, even macehuales, were to be allowed to wear a cloak, until then restricted to Spaniards and Hispanicized Indians only, to mount horses, and to own mules. The Audiencia also emphasized that only those among the local population acquainted with Spanish should be allowed to hold public office in their communities.76 By the middle of the seventeenth century, when the "caste system" was established in the district, programs for assimilation were temporarily abandoned. They were resumed by later generations, although all efforts through the end of the seventeenth century to enforce Spanish on the Indian population failed.77 The case of the province of Chiapa in early colonial Mesoamerica dem- onstrates, in any event, how adaptation to the colonial situation took a variety of forms among the native elites.

Between 1671 and i685, for example, the church of Guatemala was able to per- suade the Audiencia to let it levy tithes on Hispanicized Indians who already owned cattle ranches, cultivated wheat, and manufactured valuable products that they sold in the towns' markets. The tithe was obviously employed to prevent this able social group from becoming an economic (as well as social) threat to creole society.

Some hereditary lords found in the Dominican friars their best allies against the Spanish intrusion and its threat to the political and cultural integrity of the Indian community, a cooperation that in extreme cases led to far-fetched attempts to retain their political and cultural autonomy of the first thirty years after the conquest. Others, pre- dominantly though not exclusively among the lesser elite, found their best allies in powerful Spanish patrons who could provide them with politi- cal and economic advantages within the community and outside it. Fierce conflict between these factions soon came to prevail in many Indian com- munities of the province. In a parallel conflict that erupted between the Dominicans and the powerful encomendero oligarchy of Ciudad Real over control of the Indian communities' lands and resources, the native elites played an important role. The personal histories and career patterns of Juan Atonal and Cristobal Arias, the first representing the lesser elite and the second a somewhat higher stratum of hereditary lords, illustrate the high degree of coopera- tion between native elites and powerful Spanish lay patrons. Their case studies also provide an example of how these strategies of reciprocity and the tensions that accompanied them could lay the basis for molding a new group identity in the religious sphere among Hispanicized elites. In the face of constant conflict between Catholicism and pre-Columbian native traditions and practices, the Cofradia of the Twelve Apostles became a unique example of how these elites coped with the cultural constraints of the colonial situation through a syncretist ritual practice. The responses of the colonial church and government to the deviance of the Cofradia of the Twelve Apostles demonstrated once again their con- trasting interests. For the colonial church this heretic cofradia presented an opportunity to initiate a policy of stricter measures against Indian idola- try and heresy in general. For the colonial government, the Hispanicized elite leaders and members of the cofradia embodied the vanguard in the process of assimilation of Indians into a homogenized Hispanic colonial society. The upper hand of the audiencia in the affairs of the Indians in the district finally secured the relegitimation of the political status of these members of the Hispanicized native elites.</page></plain_text>
