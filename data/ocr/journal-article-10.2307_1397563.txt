The author believes that "it is better to restrict the use of the term instinct to those which man shares with the animals (p. 18). Since it is evident that "the animal are not religious" (p. 19), the idea of a religious instinct is rejected. But man has a tendency to believe in Unseen Powers around him, to be conscious of duties toward such powers, and to feel awe and reverence as well as trust. This "tendency to be religious is all but universal" (p. 20). Murphy decries the study of religions from a single point of view, such as that of Christianity, and refers to the discipline of Comparative Religion as a "science" (p. 5), as are "Comparative Anatomy, Comparative Psychology and the like" (p. 1). In this work he has attempted to give an objective account of the latest research on the different major types of religion, and on "the evolution of religion as a whole from such a primitive form as the dim belief in a future life which can be guessed from the burials of Palaeolithic or Old Stone Age Man to the complex beliefs and rituals of civilized people (p. 5). In the first part of the book, the author explains in detail the close connection of divergent forms of religion with divergent ways of life or cultural horizons. Five such correlations are clearly distinguished. First, there is the early Mana religion of the primitive savage who lives in a loosely knit social structure dominated primarily by instinctive action and imagination. Man, first of all, worships the mysterious impersonal forces of surrounding nature. Since he does not sharply distinguish him- self from the other animals, he is peculiarly sensitive to these powers as they are expressed in animal forms and motions. This earliest type of religion culminates in totemism. Next, there is the animistic religion of tribes devoted to food-gathering and rudi- mentary agriculture. At this level there is some time for reflection, at least on the part of the older men, who prevent all innovation and maintain the rigid structure of custom and taboo. The individual is more dearly aware of himself as a conscious agent in fulfilling his tribal functions. This ruling agency or spirit of man survives death, and similar anthropomorphic agencies control all natural beings and events. Animism is the worship of the most powerful and most mysterious agencies of this kind. It is the religion of the tribal horizon. Third, there is the agricultural horizon, which follows upon the domestication of food-plants, especially cereals, and of animals, especially cattle. This brings forth a large increase in population. Clans become tribes, and tribes become hordes which are forced to leave their earlier environment and to break away from their rigid taboos in migratory conquests of other lands and peoples. There is a sharper aware- ness of the fertility of the soil, and water is now conceived of as the Earth-mother, and the heavenly powers of sun, moon, stars, and lightning are now worshipped as anthropomorphic deities. Each spirit of tribal animism is rendered more personal and is assigned a definite sphere of activity. This polytheistic religion is characteristic of those migrant hordes who established the first nations and empires from which grew the civilizations of the Nile, the Euphrates, and the Indus. This brings us to "the civilized horizon," where vast numbers of people are united in the performance of complex common.enterprises under a single political control The division of labor becomes more accentuated; the need for understanding of com-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 277 mon purposes becomes acute; and leisure is provided for ruling classes. These changes are reflected in religion by a strong tendency toward monotheism, abstract generaliza- tion, a universal moral law, and a priestly class maintaining an elaborate "externalized" ritual (p. 135). This is the religion of the first great human civilizations. The fifth and last stage is "the prophetic horizon," which comes with the advance of civilization. This is contributed by creative individuals who usually appear at times of cultural confusion and crisis, such as the period from the ninth to the fourth century B.C. In this period of world turmoil came those great philosophers and prophets such as the Greek dramatists, Plato and Aristotle, the Hebrew prophets, the early sages and mystics of India including the Buddha, and the early ethical thinkers of China associated with the name and time of Confucius whose creative ideas have guided the course of civilized culture down to modern history. In spite of many differences, their habits of thought show certain common features: wide and sweeping generalization, a profound concern for moral principles, and a deep sense of the unique importance of the individual person. These traits point the way toward future advance. This first part of the book (pp. 1-170) is interesting and in many ways an original synthesis. The author is well-informed concerning recent anthropological research, and his arguments in defense of his scheme of classification are illuminating and cogent. But the second part (pp. 171-450) is far less interesting. It contains certain exceptional passages, such as the discussion of the origin of the caste system in India (pp. 240-247) and the account of Mandaean religion (pp. 435-445), but on the whole it is a rather pedestrian account of well-known features of civilized religions, Hebrew, Greek, Roman, Chinese, Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, and Zoroastrian. Christianity is not considered, but the author writes from a Western naturalistic point of view, which is never defended or even explicitly stated. He prefers to conceal it behind a cloak of supposed scientific objectivity (pp. 1-5). Nevertheless, it is constantly presupposed by his whole account, and in certain passages, as in the vehe- meat denunciation of Vedanta philosophy (pp. 286-291), it is expressed with a certain uncritical violence. This is not science speaking here but a half-concealed philosophy. Even when the reader agrees with some of these vague judgments, he is repelled by the lack of self-explanation and critical defense. Science certainly has its limits, and these are dearly laid bare in the second part of this work. It shows with poignant clarity the insignificance of any non-philosophical attempt to present the "facts" about philosophy and religion. There is no areligious approach to high religion.-JOHN WILD, Harvard University.</page></plain_text>
