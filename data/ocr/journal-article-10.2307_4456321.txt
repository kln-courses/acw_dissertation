Moore Center for AIDS Prevention, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California Epidemic group A meningococcal meningitis follows a unique and distinctive pattern in sub- Saharan Africa. Advances in molecular and field epidemiology have begun to elucidate the mech- anisms of meningococcal meningitis epidemics. Epidemics result from a complex combination of host, organism, and environmental risk factors. Recent studies suggest that "antigenic shifts" in group A meningococcal clones may trigger an outbreak of disease by suddenly decreasing herd immunity within a population. Although the introduction of new group A meningococcal strains into a susceptible population contributes to the likelihood of an epidemic, the presence of addi- tional environmental factors, such as low humidity and coincident respiratory tract infections, are also necessary for an epidemic to occur. Despite the unique behavior of group A meningococ- cal disease in sub-Saharan Africa, the application of similar methods of epidemiological analysis may be useful for determining epidemic processes for other diseases. The factors that cause the transition of a communicable disease from an endemic steady-state to a rapidly evolving epidemic are not well understood. Epidemics are difficult to study because they are unpredictable and occur infrequently. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, epidemics of group A me- ningococcal meningitis have a regular cyclic pattern that provides an unusual opportunity to study the factors leading to the emergence of a communicable disease epidemic. Epidemiology of Epidemic Meningococcal Disease Neisseria meningitidis, the bacterium that causes meningo- coccal meningitis, can be classified into at least 13 distinct serogroups based on the antigenicity of the outer polysaccha- ride capsule [1, 2]. Although various meningococcal sero- groups are responsible for sporadic cases of meningitis, major epidemics are caused primarily by group A [2] and, to a lesser extent, by group C meningococci [3-5]. Meningococcal men- ingitis has a case-fatality ratio of5%-25% [6, 7] and neurologi- cal sequelae are common among survivors [8]. N. meningitidis is also a common commensal of humans: 2%-10% of healthy persons are nasopharyngeal carriers of potentially pathogenic meningococci [9-11]. Meningococci are spread by person-to-person respiratory transmission, and Received 5 February 1991; revised 14 May 1991.

Meningococcal trans- mission often occurs in the absence of a corresponding in- crease in the rate of meningococcal disease [13], a circum- stance indicating that transmission alone is not sufficient to trigger an epidemic [14]. Since World War II, group A meningococcal epidemics have been rare in industrialized nations, and attack rates for all serogroups combined generally do not exceed 5 cases/ 100,000 per year [2, 15, 16]. Limited outbreaks of group A meningococcal disease that primarily affect lower socioeco- nomic groups have taken place in Finland [17], New Zea- land [18, 19], and the U.S. Pacific Northwest [20] over the last 15 years. These outbreaks, as well as outbreaks that oc- curred in the United States before the 1940s [21], had rela- tively low overall incidence rates (&lt;15 cases/100,000 per year). In contrast, intense meningococcal epidemics have been reported in a number of developing countries, includ- ing Brazil [2], Nepal [22], China [23], and various sub- Saharan African nations [24-26]. Attack rates during these epidemics can approach 1% of the population; as many as 3 million cases occurred during the group A meningococcal epidemic in China in 1967 [23]. Health facilities in develop- ing countries can be paralyzed during epidemics by the rapid and prolonged influx of patients with meningitis. A broad savannah region in Africa extending from The Gambia to Ethiopia is known as the "meningitis belt" (figure 1). This region is uniquely susceptible to intense group A meningococcal epidemics that occur in 8- to 14-year cycles [7, 27-29]; each epidemic wave follows a multiyear, cre- scendo-decrescendo pattern (figure 2). Rates of disease are also seasonally dependent, peaking during the dry season (December-May) and declining rapidly with the onset of rains (figure 3). Even during major epidemic waves, menin-</page><page sequence="2">516 Moore CID 1992;14 (February) TUNISIAn,. gMOROCCO ^^ L ALGERIA I " / ---- ^. &lt; LIBYA EGYT \ MAURITANIA .-. \ . . .. MALI 1.

Similar epidemic patterns occurred in the United States before World War II [21, 32, 33] and occur in present-day China [23]. In addition to the unique temporal pattern ofmeningococ- cal disease in Africa, there is a marked shift in the age of patients with meningitis during epidemics.

During group A menin- gococcal epidemics, however, older groups are often af- fected, with the age-specific attack rates among 5- to 10-year olds being higher than the rates among younger groups [2, 5, 24, 34].

However, recent developments in the quantitative and descriptive epi- demiology of this disease suggest that epidemics result from a complex interaction of multiple factors. Interactions be- tween the host, the organism, and the environment may ex- plain the periodic and seasonal patterns of epidemics, as well as the unusual age distribution among persons who contract meningitis during an epidemic. The Host Humoral immunity is the most important host factor in the prevention of meningococcal meningitis [35], but little is known about population-based immunity (herd immunity) in the meningitis belt. The role of humoral immunity in pre- venting meningococcal disease was largely determined through a series of studies of military recruits conducted by Goldschneider et al. in the 1960s [33, 36, 37]. These authors showed that the risk of meningococcal disease was inversely related to a patient's preexisting bactericidal antibody titers against the causative serogroup: Only 6% of army recruits who became ill had preexistent bactericidal antibody titers &gt; 1:4 compared with 82% of recruits who remained healthy. These findings were extended to the civilian population of the United States, where age-specific attack rates were corre- lated with bactericidal antibody levels among different age groups. Meningococcal attack rates in the United States are highest for children aged 9-12 months, the age at which ma- ternally derived antibodies are lost; these rates decrease with increasing age, a finding that correlates with an increased proportion of older persons who have elevated bactericidal titers [33]. These studies also helped to clarify a seeming paradox concerning natural protection against invasion by N. menin- gitidis. Although meningococcal carriage is common in most populations, relatively few persons actually contract invasive disease. How, then, do individuals become protected from invasive meningococcal disease on first exposure to a patho- genic strain of N. meningitidis? The presumed answer lies in the fact that childhood carriage of nonpathogenic Neisseria species, such as Neisseria lactamica, stimulates the formation of cross-protective antibodies [9, 35, 36]. These antibodies appear to be protective during the critical period between infection and development of a specific immune response against a pathogenic meningococcal strain [36]. Little is known about which cellular components of a meningococcus contribute to natural immunity. Most menin- gococcal capsular polysaccharides (except for the group B polysaccharide) are highly immunogenic [37]. Serogroup- specific antibodies develop in patients who are recuperating from meningitis [38], and purified meningococcal polysac- charide vaccines confer high levels of protective immunity [37, 39]. Natural immunity, however, may also be directed against nonpolysaccharide antigens shared between Neisseria spe- cies. N. lactamica is probably nonencapsulated [40]. There- fore, cross-protective immunity induced by N. lactamica carriage is probably directed against nonpolysaccharide anti- gens. In addition, healthy persons are significantly more likely than patients with meningitis to have protective bacte- ricidal antibody levels against a variety of meningococcal serogroups [33]. This is not due to an intrinsic inability of patients with meningitis to develop antipolysaccharide anti- bodies since recuperating patients develop high homologous bactericidal titers [33, 38]. This is consistent, however, with the possibility that bactericidal assays actually measure anti- bodies directed against nonpolysaccharide antigens shared among different meningococcal serogroups and different Neisseria species. Low premorbid bactericidal titers in pa- tients with meningitis may be due to lack of previous carriage of Neisseria species. The development of cross-protective im- munity against nonpolysaccharide epitopes would explain why many healthy American adults have high bactericidal titers against relatively rare meningococcal serogroups [33]. Shared antigens that might stimulate cross-protective anti- bodies include the lipooligosaccharide [40, 41] and various outer membrane proteins [42, 43]. The duration, efficacy, and specificity of immunity induced against nonpolysaccha- ride antigens has not been well characterized. Loss of herd immunity against group A meningococci may contribute to the regularity of epidemic cycles in sub-Sa- haran Africa [24]. Carriage rates of 20%-30% occur during epidemics in Africa [44], and the half-life of carriage is -4 weeks [45, 46]. Carriage of group A meningococci can cause transient meningococcemia [47] and fever [14, 47]. Under these conditions, most persons in a population can be ex- pected to become meningococcal carriers and develop pro- tective antibody titers [45]. Although immunization with pu- rified group A polysaccharide vaccine does not prevent carriage [14, 48], natural immunity induced by whole group A meningococci appears to effectively reduce transmission [48]. Rising herd immunity due to widespread carriage would then limit meningococcal transmission, ending the ep- idemic wave [48]. A population's susceptibility to epidemic disease might re- turn as antibody levels decline and herd immunity is diluted by new birth cohorts. In adults, protection afforded by the group A polysaccharide vaccine declines to 67% within 3 years of vaccination [39]. Vaccinees develop a rapid T cell- independent antibody response, but &lt;10% of children &lt;4 years of age have protective antibodies 3 years after vaccina- tion [39, 49]. If the results of vaccination trials can be ex- tended to infection with the whole organism, then natural immunity against the group A polysaccharide may be short- lived as well. Additional decrements in herd immunity would occur as new birth cohorts ( 25% of the population) are born between epidemic cycles.</page><page sequence="4">518 Moore CID 1992;14 (February) Although serogroup-specific protection may decline over time, little direct information is available about immunity against other outer-membrane antigens in African popula- tions. No long-term studies of population-based immunity over several successive epidemic waves have been con- ducted. Long-term studies of natural immunity are needed to clarify the role of herd immunity in preventing outbreaks of epidemic disease. Host factors other than herd immunity may influence the intensity of epidemic disease but probably do not determine whether or not epidemics occur. Various host factors [50, 51], including complement deficiencies [52], predispose to meningococcal disease in developed countries. However, studies in Africa have not found complement deficiencies or genetic susceptibility to be major risk factors for epidemic meningococcal disease [30, 53]. Nutritional status, which varies with the growing season, could conceivably play a role in the seasonal expression of meningococcal disease. Studies of both humans [54] and ani- mals [55] indicate that nutritional deficiencies result in a decrease in the immune response to meningococcal polysac- charides and potentially could blunt immune responses to nonpolysaccharide antigens as well. During an epidemic in The Gambia, however, no differences in height or weight between case patients and matched control patients were found [30]. Anthropomorphic measurements may be insen- sitive for detecting subtle nutritional deficiencies, or wide- spread nutritional deficiencies may put the entire population at higher risk for disease. The Organism Variation in virulence between strains of N. meningitidis may also contribute to an epidemic. Differences exist among meningococcal serogroups with regard to their potential to cause epidemics. Outbreaks ofserogroup B disease, for exam- ple, occur in developed countries [56, 57], but attack rates during these outbreaks are one to two orders of magnitude less than rates during corresponding serogroup A epidemics in the African meningitis belt. Different strains within serogroup A may also have differ- ent potentials for causing an epidemic. Recent technological advances have made it possible to classify meningococcal strains on the basis of genetic relatedness [58], including ser- otyping of outer membrane protein and lipooligosaccharide antigens [59], DNA restriction fragment analysis [60], and multilocus electrophoretic enzyme (MLE) typing [61]. The latter technique is based on electrophoretic variation of in- tracellular enzymes between strains and correlates with DNA restriction fragment analysis [60] and serological typ- ing [62]. MLE typing has been particularly useful in tracing the origins of individual serogroup A meningococcal clones. In an important study of serogroup A population genetics, Olyhoek and colleagues [61] used a combination of MLE and outer membrane protein typing to classify 423 group A meningococcal strains collected during various epidemics and outbreaks around the world. These strains were classi- fied into four large subgroups that were designated I-IV and consisted of 21 genetically distinct clones. A strain belonging to an additional clonal subgroup, V, has been isolated re- cently from patients in China [63]. Two clones, designated I-1 and III-1, have caused widespread outbreaks of disease. Clonal virulence within serogroup A appears to be an im- portant determinant for epidemic disease. A recent study of a series of epidemics has shown the utility of clonal typing in investigating the descriptive epidemiology of meningococcal epidemics [25]. In 1983-1984, an epidemic began in Nepal, centered in the Kathmandu Valley [22]. This epidemic may have been imported from China [61] after the opening of roadways between Tibet and Nepal. Subsequently, major epi- demics due to group A strains erupted in India and Pakistan in 1985. A third epidemic began during the 1987 Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia [45]. South Asian pil- grims probably imported the strain, which quickly spread among all other nationalities, as the epidemic began among South Asians, who also had the highest attack rates. Al- though the meningococcal carriage rates were high among pilgrims returning to industrialized countries, widespread outbreaks did not occur in developed nations [14, 64, 65]. Intense secondary epidemics, however, did occur the follow- ing year in N'Djamena, Chad, and Khartoum, Sudan, in the meningitis belt. Clonal typing of strains from these epi- demics revealed that one clone, designated III-1, was respon- sible for these epidemics [25, 66] (figure 4). This clone was not found during previous surveys of African strains [66, 67], and the detection of this newly introduced clone resulted in warnings being sent to other nations in the meningitis belt [25]. Additional epidemics due to the clone III-1 group A strain occurred in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania [26], and there is concern that this clone may cause future epidemics in the western regions of the meningitis belt. The introduc- tion of the I-1 clone into the U.S. Pacific Northwest in the 1970s [20, 61] and into New Zealand in the 1980s [18, 31] resulted in comparatively smaller outbreaks of disease, a situ- ation suggesting that the same mechanism, although modi- fied by environmental or host factors, may apply to indus- trialized countries. The results of these studies indicate that the introduction of new group A meningococcal clones rather than the resur- gence of old resident strains is integral to the epidemic pro- cess. Epidemics are generally due to a single clone [68, 69]. Recurrence of epidemics caused by a single clone can take place, but generally only after a prolonged period (-20 years) between epidemics [61, 70]. Differences in epidemic potential among clones could be due to intrinsic, nonimmunologic virulence factors or to the escape from immunologic surveillance of an antigenically distinct clone [25]. Proteins that enhance virulence occur in</page><page sequence="5">CID 1992;14 (February) Epidemic Meningococcal Meningitis 519 / NEPAL /:i:::::::: 71987 L/( &gt; ?1985 V^/&lt;~~ ^?^INDIAN OCEAN ATLANTIC OCEAN \ j ) Figure 4. Intercontinental spread of the clone III- 1 group A meningococcus (from [25, 26]). other gram-negative bacteria [71, 72], and differences in epi- demic potential between meningococcal clones could be due to similar factors. Phenotypic variation among meningo- cocci, such as piliation in group B strains, correlates with in vitro assays of pathogenicity [73, 74]. Epidemic potential, however, is not measured by these assays because it is a func- tion of both transmissibility and invasiveness. Alternatively, antigenic variation between N. meningitidis group A clones could be responsible for a sudden loss of herd immunity. If population-based levels of immunity against the group A polysaccharide are low and a new clone express- ing novel outer membrane epitopes is introduced into that population, an epidemic might be triggered by an "antigenic shift" in nonpolysaccharide antigens [70]. Mass migrations of populations, which are a risk factor for epidemic disease [75], could trigger epidemics either by introducing antigeni- cally novel clones or by diluting herd immunity in the resi- dent population. If epidemics result from antigenic shifts in meningococcal clones, it is of prime importance to correlate outer mem- brane antigen expression and clonal type with protective im- munity. By definition, all group A meningococci share com- mon group A polysaccharide epitopes. Class 3 and 4 outer membrane proteins also show limited electrophoretic and serological variation among serogroup A meningococcal clones [70]. Class 1 outer membrane proteins vary antigeni- cally between clonal subgroups and tend to be uniform for isolates from a given clone [62, 68]. Although class 1 pro- teins between clones might contribute to an antigenic shift in herd immunity, the uniformity of this protein within a given clone may be artifactual because electrophoretic variation of class 1 proteins is used in some clonal typing schemes [70]. In contrast to class 1, 3, and 4 proteins, lipooligosaccharides and class 5 outer membrane proteins show substantial intra- clonal antigenic variation [68, 70, 76]. Some pilin epitopes also vary within a single group A clone [70], while others are conserved among several meningococcal serogroups [77]. Even highly variable antigens such as the class 5 outer mem- brane protein may have stable domains within a given clone that could potentially stimulate protective immunity and contribute to an antigenic shift between group A clones. The Environment In addition to herd immunity and clonal virulence, appro- priate environmental conditions are clearly necessary for ini- tiation of an epidemic [24]. Clone III-1 was exported world- wide after the 1987 epidemic in Mecca. Meningococcal carriers returned to numerous countries, both in- and outside the meningitis belt, that did not experience outbreaks. Even</page><page sequence="6">520 Moore CID 1992;14 (February) though the attack rate was high for American pilgrims in Saudi Arabia and - 11% of returning pilgrims were clone III-1 carriers, no subsequent outbreaks of disease were de- tected in the United States [14]. Because American pilgrims were ostensibly well-nourished and secondary disease among family members was limited, it is unlikely that nutritional or genetic risk factors played a significant role in their sus- ceptibility to disease. Apparently, pilgrims were transiently placed at risk by local environmental factors during the epi- demic in Saudi Arabia. Additional evidence for the importance of transient envi- ronmental factors is the seasonal pattern of meningococcal disease in the meningitis belt during epidemic and hyperen- demic periods [13, 27]. Temporal trends in the incidence of meningitis reflect patterns of absolute humidity and maxi- mum seasonal temperatures [13]. The seasonality of menin- gococcal disease is probably due to increased invasiveness rather than to transmission of meningococci during the dry season. Survival of the organism during airborne transmis- sion is not enhanced during the dry season [24, 78]; meningo- coccal transmission occurs year-round and carriage rates do not vary seasonally in either developing or developed coun- tries [13, 45, 79, 80]. It is appealing to speculate that under "normal" circum- stances, group A meningococci rarely cause invasive menin- gococcal disease. During an epidemic, however, changes in environmental factors may temporarily enhance meningo- coccal invasiveness, thereby increasing the ratio of persons with meningococcal disease to those who are meningococcal carriers [13, 79]. Low humidity, temperature, and dust storms are examples of seasonal environmental factors that might enhance successful meningococcal invasion by damag- ing the host's mucosal barrier directly or by inhibiting muco- sal immune defenses. In addition to climatic conditions, upper respiratory tract infections may be important "environmental" factors con- tributing to an epidemic. An association between respiratory infections and meningococcal disease has long been sus- pected from simultaneous outbreaks of sporadic meningococ- cal disease and respiratory infections [81-83]. A strong sea- sonal correlation also exists between sporadic outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis and respiratory infections in in- dustrialized countries [84]. Although a direct association be- tween coincident respiratory infections and sporadic out- breaks of meningococcal disease has been found by several investigators [85, 86], the results of these studies have not been widely accepted because of methodological problems [87-89]. The epidemic in Chad in 1988 due to clone III-1 allowed investigation of coincident respiratory infections using a strict matched case-control design [44, 90]. In this study, patients with group A meningococcal meningitis were -'23 times more likely than were matched control patients to have nasopharyngeal shedding of respiratory pathogens, including Mycoplasma hominis, adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. Because a vari- ety of respiratory pathogens were recovered from patients with meningococcal infection, it can be inferred that respira- tory infections probably increase susceptibility to meningo- coccal disease through a nonspecific mechanism, such as damage to the pharyngeal mucosa. Symptomatic respiratory infections that cause coughing and sneezing could also po- tentially enhance transmission of meningococci during an epidemic. One implication of this finding is that upper respiratory tract infections contribute to the seasonality of meningococ- cal meningitis in Africa. The occurrence of respiratory infec- tions and otitis media (another illness associated with upper respiratory tract infections) peaks during the dry season in Chad (T. Lippeveld, personal communication). While the presence of respiratory infections may be responsible in part for the seasonality of meningococcal disease, the reasons for the seasonality of respiratory infections remain poorly un- derstood [91]. Respiratory infections may also play a role in the upward shift in age-specific attack rates that occurs during epidemics. Specimens from adolescents and adults with meningitis were significantly more likely to be positive for a respiratory pathogen than were those from younger patients with menin- gitis in Chad [44]. This finding is consistent with the possibil- ity that a coincident upper respiratory tract infection is neces- sary to overcome protection afforded by cross-protective antibodies. Infants and younger children with low antibody titers may be highly susceptible to disease on first encounter with a pathogenic N. meningitidis strain, and coincident respi- ratory infections would not appreciably increase their risk of disease. For adults, however, the additional insult of a respira- tory infection may be necessary to overcome host defenses against invasive disease. If an older, previously resistant por- tion of the population suddenly becomes susceptible because of coincident respiratory infections, there would be a rapid enlargement of the population at risk, resulting in an upward shift in age-specific attack rates [34]. Other coinfections may also cause susceptibility to inva- sive meningococcal disease. One intriguing possibility in- volves the induction of blocking IgA antibodies by cross- reacting antigens on other bacteria [35, 92]. According to this hypothesis, enteric bacteria possessing capsular epitopes that cross-react with meningococcal polysaccharides might stimulate circulating anticapsular IgA antibodies. In persons who become meningococcal carriers, cross-reactive IgA could coat capsular polysaccharides on meningococci that enter the bloodstream from the mucosa. This would prevent IgG or IgM binding to the meningococcal polysaccharide, in turn preventing complement-mediated killing and enhanc- ing survival of the organism. Epidemic meningococcal dis-</page><page sequence="7">CID 1992;14 (February) Epidemic Meningococcal Meningitis 521 ease would then primarily result from the spread of enteric coinfections rather than the spread of meningococci [92]. IgA alone, however, can activate complement-mediated killing of meningococci [93], and noncapsular as well as cap- sular antigens probably provoke a protective immune re- sponse. Because meningococcal carriage is itself a mucosal infection, it is also difficult to explain why, on the basis of this hypothesis, meningococci do not generate their own blocking IgA antibodies, allowing any pathogenic meningo- coccal strain to disseminate. Since epidemiological investiga- tions have been inconclusive [94], additional studies are needed to evaluate the contribution of blocking IgA to me- ningococcal epidemics. Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may also become a significant factor in African outbreaks of meningitis because of the high seroprevalence of HIV in some African cities. Meningococcal disease has been re- ported in a patient with AIDS [95], and disseminated disease due to encapsulated bacteria occurs more frequently in per- sons infected with HIV [96]. The present AIDS epidemic in the East African meningitis belt could significantly change the behavior of group A meningococcal epidemics in this region. A recent meningococcal epidemic in Nairobi, Kenya, was characterized by unusually high attack rates among adults and changes in the usual seasonal pattern of epidemic disease [97]. Socioeconomic status is another poorly understood but important environmental risk factor. Major group A menin- gococcal epidemics occur exclusively in developing coun- tries, a circumstance that suggests that socioeconomic status may modulate the intensity if not the occurrence of epi- demics. Within susceptible populations in Africa, however, socioeconomic status is only marginally related to the risk of disease [30], perhaps because of the widespread nature of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. Household crowding may in- crease the risk of meningococcal disease by resulting in in- creased exposure to meningococci or to coinfecting upper respiratory tract infections [44]. Crowding has been asso- ciated with a higher risk of disease in some studies [44, 45, 48] but not in others [30]. Although socioeconomic status does not clearly account for susceptibility to disease within a given African population, it may contribute to the suscepti- bility of developing countries to meningococcal epidemics. Other environmental factors may predispose persons to meningococcal disease during an epidemic but, like nonim- munologic host factors, are unlikely to vary dramatically over time. In studies conducted during cluster outbreaks of group B meningococcal disease in Europe, passive and active smoking were associated with meningococcal disease [98, 99] and meningococcal carriage [100]. Smoking was not found to be a risk factor for group A meningococcal carriage during the outbreak in Mecca [14] or for invasive disease during an epidemic in The Gambia [30]. Role of Host, Organism, and Environmental Risk Factors in the Emergence of an Epidemic As the preceding discussion indicates, epidemics are dy- namic processes and some risk factors, such as population movements [23, 75], may be understood better with use of a dynamic model [31]. Nonetheless, the epidemiological para- digm that consists of interactions between the host, the organ- ism, and the environment is useful for understanding the emergence of an epidemic and, more importantly, may point to areas where further studies are needed. Interactions between the host, the organism, and environ- mental risk factors suggest a mechanistic outline for the oc- currence ofmeningococcal epidemics (figure 5). A necessary precondition for an epidemic appears to be the new intro- duction of a group A meningococcal clone into a susceptible population. Although intrinsic virulence factors have not been ruled out, differences in epidemic potential between group A meningococcal clones probably depend at least in part on antigenic variation of nonpolysaccharide epitopes. During an epidemic, widespread meningococcal carriage immunizes the population against both group A polysaccha- ride and clone-specific outer membrane antigens, halting transmission of the clone [48, 68]. Resurgence of disease during the subsequent interepidemic period may be pre- vented by both antipolysaccharide and clone-specific immu- nity. If immunity against nonpolysaccharide antigens is pro- longed compared with antipolysaccharide immunity, the population would become susceptible again to newly intro- duced clones as cross-protective antipolysaccharide immu- nity is lost. The interepidemic period, therefore, results from the time required for loss of antipolysaccharide immunity plus the average time required for the new introduction of a sufficiently distinct group A meningococcal clone. Repeated epidemics due to a single clone would require longer periods between the epidemics so that clone-specific, nonpolysac- charide herd immunity is also lost. The introduction of novel clones alone during periods of susceptibility, however, is insufficient to start an epidemic. Low levels of residual immunity probably prevent epidemics from occurring during the nonpermissive rainy season. Be- cause transmission is not seasonally dependent, spread of a meningococcal clone during the rainy season may induce widespread immunity without apparent disease [79]. During the dry season, however, a combination of climatic condi- tions and widespread respiratory infections may promote me- ningococcal invasion over carriage. In the setting of low herd immunity and decreased mucosal protection, new acquisi- tion ofmeningococcal carriage would then have a high proba- bility of resulting in invasive disease. The uneven geographic distribution of cases that occur during an epidemic [30] may reflect the necessity for the presence of all of these factors for invasive disease to occur.</page><page sequence="8">522 Moore CID 1992;14 (February) 'f~~~^ ' A,~~~~ A,~ ^Figure 5.

Individ- ual epidemics could vary markedly from this model depend- ing on the extent of herd immunity in the population, the prevalence of various meningococcal clones, and the geo- graphic setting of the population. It is not clear why epi- demics tend to be limited to the meningitis belt since upper respiratory tract infections are common in other parts of Africa and the rest of the world. Unique environmental con- ditions or novel coinfecting respiratory agents could place this geographic area at risk, but there is no clear evidence that this is the case. In addition, carriage of N. lactamica is com- mon in the meningitis belt [45], and it is unclear why African carriers do not develop long-lasting immunity against group A meningococci. Potentially, immunosuppressive factors, such as poor nutrition [54] or coincident malarial infections [101], could limit the duration or extent of cross-protection induced by nonpathogenic Neisseria species. It is also unclear why group A meningococcal carriage [9] and invasive disease [15] have declined in industrialized countries since World War II. Widespread use of antibiotics does not account for this phenomenon since other patho- genic serogroups are still common. Mortality in industrial- ized countries due to a wide variety of infectious diseases, including meningococcal meningitis, declined earlier in this century before the introduction of effective medical inter- ventions [102]. This circumstance suggests that a combina- tion of poorly characterized social and hygienic factors may be protective against meningococcal meningitis and other infectious diseases. Long-term studies of herd immunity and its relationship to group A clonal antigenic variation are needed. This will re- quire observing a population through at least one complete epidemic cycle and measuring population-based immune re- sponses to a group A meningococcal clone before, during, and after a meningococcal epidemic. Unfortunately, deter- mining which antigens contribute to natural immunity against group A meningococci remains a major obstacle. Prospects for Future Control of Epidemics Since precise prediction of meningococcal epidemics is currently not possible, immediate efforts should be directed toward early detection and rapid response to outbreaks of epidemic disease. These efforts require a commitment by de- veloped and developing countries to enhance efforts at controlling epidemics. Control strategies have been devised [103], but their effective implementation requires prompt coordination between national and international agencies. The development of new vaccines to control meningococ- cal disease should be a major priority. New generations of polysaccharide-conjugate [104] or antiidiotype vaccines [105] against the polysaccharide have potential for promot- ing long-lasting immunity against all group A meningococ- cal clones. New vaccines will have to be inexpensive and effective to be useful in developing countries. If the compo- nents of the epidemic process become more fully known, accurate prediction of the timing and location of epidemics eventually may be possible. At some time in the future, risk indicators for epidemics may be determined, such as the carriage rates of novel clones, which can be combined with surveillance data to provide a reasonable estimate of the risk of an epidemic. Mathematical modeling techniques may also prove useful for predicting impending epidemics [75, 103]. Despite the complex behavior of epidemic meningococcal</page><page sequence="9">CID 1992;14 (February) Epidemic Meningococcal Meningitis 523 disease, the factors leading to an epidemic can be ap- proached using the classical epidemiological triangle of in- teractions between the host, the organism, and the environ- ment. Although the epidemiology of this disease is unique, understanding the mechanisms behind a meningococcal epi- demic may stimulate new insights into the behavior of other epidemic diseases as well.
