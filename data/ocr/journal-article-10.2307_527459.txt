<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PENTATEUGHAL QUESTION.* I. GEN. 1:1--12:5.t BY PROFESSOR 'WILLIAM R. HARPER, PH. D., Yale University. A. INTRODUCTORY. In presenting and criticising the alleged Pentateuchal (more strictly Hexa- teuchal) Analysis, the writers have agreed upon the following points: 1. The first paper of each writer will cover Gen. 1-12:5; the second and third papers, Gen. 12 : 6-50; the remaining papers, later portions of the Hexa- teuch according to the circumstances of the case. 2. There will first be given the presentation of the facts and considerations urged in favor of the analysis (i. e. the more commonly accepted analysis which finds four distinct works combined by one or more editors or Redactors). This will be followed by a counter-statement or criticism. 3. Since the work has for its purpose to place the essential material and the most important considerations relating to the question to be discussed in a form which will enable the biblical students of America to grasp most easily the true merits of the case, the plan of presentation will be made strictly to conform to this purpose. 4. The material will be examined chapter by chapter, section by section; the facts will thus be collected step by step. Conclusions will not be advanced until the facts have been duly considered. 5. In the nature of the case, both writers will be restricted as to the space which may be used; yet an earnest effort will be made to introduce everything that is really important. 6. The question at issue is not, (1) What are the particular details of the analysis of the Hexateuch ? or, (2) Granting the existence of documents, what relations do these documents sustain to each other ? but, (3) Are there really distinct documents ? i. e. such as the analysis of critics of the present generation presents ? As a matter of course, material belonging itrictly to the first and second questions will come up for consideration; still the discussion itself is upon the third ques- tion. * THE ALLEGED PACTS AND CONSIDERATIONS Of THE PENTATEUCHAL ANALYSIS PRE- SENTED AND CRITICIZED BY Profe880sr Harper (of Yale) and Green (of Princeton). ? The consideration of this same material by Professor Green will appear in the January HEBRAIcA.</page><page sequence="2">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 19 7. The article by Rev. B. W. Bacon on "The Pentateuchal Analysis" in July HEBRAICA, with its continuation in the present number, will be found to contain a very accurate statement of the various views relating to the exact material of each document. In view of the publication of this article the writers will be enabled to present the case within a much shorter compass than would otherwise have been possible. B. THE FACTS AND CONSIDERATIONS URGED IN FAVOR OF THE ANALYSIS OF GENESIS 1:1-12:5.*t I. The Material as a whole. 1. To a priestly writer (hereafter referred to as P) critics assign the following portions: 1) The tP1dhath (generations) of the heavens and earth (creation, Sabbath), chs. 1:1-2:4a (the original title 2:4a having been removed by the Redactor from before 1:1, or from before 1:2, in which case 1:1 was substituted for it). 2) The t8l1dhath of Adam (genealogical table of ten generations, the tenth branching into three), ch. 5:1-32 (exc. v. 29). 3) The tal'dh8th of Noah (deluge (365 days), covenant with Noah, Noachic legislation), chs. 6:9-22; 7:6,11,13-16a,18-21,23b,24; 8:1,2a,3b-5,13a,14-19; 9:1- 17,28,29. 4) The t8Pdh8th of the sons of Noah (ethnological table deriving the nations of the world from Noah's sons), ch. 10:1-7,20,22,23,31,32. 5) The t8Pdh6th of Shem (genealogical table of ten generations branching into three, Abram, Nahor and Haran), ch. 11:10-26. 6) The tPldhath of Terah (migration of Terah, settlement of Abram and Lot in Canaan), chs. 11:27,31 (worked over by R), 32; 12:4b,5; [13:6,11b,12a, etc., to be taken up in another article]. * In the following presentation I have made a free use of the material furnished by all the leading writers upon the subject; cf. the list of works mentioned in HEBRAICA, Vol. IV., pp. 218, 219. I do not in each case name the writers who, before me, have presented the same matter, (1) because in most cases it would be necessary to name several writers: (2) because the great mass of the material has now become common property; (3) because to have done this would have required more space than could under any circumstances have been accorded the article; and chiefly (4) because, from the stand-point of the discussion, it is a matter of no consequence what a given critic thinks, the real question being whether, in the opinion of the student, the text under examination furnishes the fact stated; our work has to do with the text of Genesis and not with the critics of that text. W. R. H. t In this presentation, many statements will be made, especially under the heads of "mate- rial" and "theology," which to the student who for the first time considers this question may seem wholly inconsistent with any proper estimate of the contents of Scripture. Such a student will find it advantageous, thus from the very beginning of his work, to learn what is involved in an acceptance of the analysis. It is not, as is so often asserted, a merely literary question. Its decision carries with it the decision of many and important questions relating to the meaning and value of the sacred writings, W. IR. H.</page><page sequence="3">20 HEBRAICA. 2. To a prophetic writer (hereafter referred to as J) critics assign the follow- ing portions: 1) Beginning of the world, paradise, sin and curse, ch. 2:4b-8:24 (except (1) the word t which regularly follows fllt; (2) 3:20 which was either mis- placed or inserted by R; and perhaps (3) 2:10-15). 2) Adam's descendants, Cain and Abel, genealogy of seven generations branching into three, song of Lamech, ch. 4:1-15 ((1) probably out of its original place, (2) f1l (v. 1) by R), 17-24,25,26; 5:29 (the material of 4:17-24 being from an earlier source. 3) Sons of God and daughters of men, corruption, ch. 6:1-8 (except (1) f~~ i 01) v. 4; (2) 0ty0 .... ' and t*f' v. 7, which are by R); but compare what is said later (p. 39) concerning this passage. 4) Deluge of forty days; rescue of Noah; Noah's sacrifice; Yahwehss prom- ise, ch. 7:1,2,3 (in part), 4,5,7 (in part), 10,12,16b,17,22.23 (in part); 8:2b,3a,6-12,13b, 20-22 (R being responsible for 7:3a,7 in part, 8,9,22,23 in part). 5) Noah's husbandry, prophetic song, peopling of the earth from Noah's sons, ch. 9:20-27,18,19; 10:8,10-12,13-19,21,24-30 (of which (1) 9:20-27 is from a special source, (2) 10:9,24,14 in part(?) and D~31 n91 (v. 19) are by R). 6) Tower of Babel, dispersion, Abram and his family, ch. 11:1-9 (see, how- ever, p. 56),28-30 (exc. O''tf "I) = R). 7) Abram called; journey with Lot, ch. 12:1-4a. 3. The differences of opinion between the chief critics have been minutely indicated by Mr. Bacon in the article already referred to. These variations may be classified as follows : 1) Cases in which some critics enter into a more minute analysis and find traces in-a single document of two or three strata (called pi, P2, J, J2, etc.), e. g. the entire J portion of Gen.1-12, which by Wellhausen, Budde, Kuenen and Kit- tel is supposed to have come into its present form from a combination of two sources (see pp. 59-62). 2) Cases in which (a) critics differ as to the particular document to which a given verse should be assigned; e. g. (1) Gen. 7:23b (= P) is given to J by Bud., Kuen., Del., and Kautzsch and Socin; * (2) 7:6a (-- P) is given to R by Well.; (3) 11:28 and 30 (-- J) is given to P by Well. and K. and Soc.; (b) the variations are very minute, the evidence either way being so slight as to make it difficult to determine the real place; e. g. (1) 11:31 b)tV "9 , given by Dil. to R, by Bud. to J2, but by Del. and Kitt. regarded as P; (2) 'ZK O7 (9:22) = R (not J) by Well., Bud., Kuen.; so (3) ,ji 53 (10:21) = R (not J) by same; (4) 10:16f,18b = Rd (not J) by same; (5) 10:9 = J (not R) by Bud. and Kuen.(?); etc. * Die Genesis, mit Aeusserer Unterscheidung der Quellenschriften. 1888.</page><page sequence="4">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 21 3) Cases in which evidence is by some thought to exist of the employment of earlier sources, which, however, have been so thoroughly worked over as to become hardly recognizable; e. g. (1) 1:2-2:4a (= P) is supposed by Well., Bud., Kuen. to contain such material, some even supposing that this earlier source is J2, a view consistent only with the theory that J is older than P; (2) 5:22-24 (= P) is claimed by Budde to be from some such earlier source; etc. RBemarks. Touching these variations the following points deserve consideration: 1. In view of the remarkable degree of unanimity which exists, too much emphasis should not be laid upon the comparatively few cases in which there is a difference of opinion. Omitting the cases under 1) and 3) above in which, while recognizing a particular passage as, e. g. J, cer- tain critics still more minutely analyze the material, or suppose the existence of earlier sources, no longer distinguishable, we find that out of a total of 304 verses, there are not more than twenty in reference to which critics differ. 2. The character of the differences shows that they are due largely to the writers' views of the relation of the various documents to each other. In this way, at all events, many of them may be accounted for. 3. The chief difficulty exists in reference to the work of the Redactor. This, in the nature of the case, must always remain more or less indefinite, although thedocuments themselves may be distinguished from each other with much satisfaction. It is to be observed, however, that, handy as it may seem to credit to the account of the Redactor whatever causes trouble by its presence elsewhere, it cannot well be denied that the work attributed to him is exactly what would have been expected under all the circumstances. II. The Analysis of Gen. 1-3 (Creation, Paradise, the Sin and Curse). The first three chapters contain two distinct accounts of creation,-(1) that of P, Gen. 1:1-2:4a (see above); (2) that of J, Gen. 2:4b-3:24. The evidence of this distinction is four-fold, viz. the language, the style, the material, and the theol- ogy. This evidence will be considered in order. In general, the points presented will be only those furnished by the particular chapter under consideration. Some- times, however, it will be necessary to include material belonging to subsequent chapters, in order to show the harmony of that which is being considered with the later matter; and because the chapter in question may present matter which, although in harmony with what follows, when taken by itself is hardly sufficient in amount to exhibit clearly the point under consideration. 1. The Language.-Each of the two sections, as divided above, is seen to have certain words which are not found, or are rarely found, in the other. It is conceded that considerable difference may exist between two passages in respect to vocabulary, without furnishing an argument for different authorship, since such variations may often be accounted for on the ground of different subject, different circumstances, etc. Still, when they are so many and so marked, when they occur in what purports to be a treatment of the same subject, and when, moreover, the differences of vocabulary coincide in a most remarkable manner with differences of style, material, etc., it is believed that the explanations usually given upon the supposition of a single author are insufficient.</page><page sequence="5">22 HEBRAICA. 1) LANG UAGE OF P. To save space, the general usage of each word is given when it is taken up for the first time. (1) l'tUK3 (1:1): probably in construct rela- tion with following clause; if used absolutely, it is peculiar, J (also E*) using flnrfi (cf. Gen, 18:3; 48:18,20; Jud. 1:1). (2) KS) (1:1): occurs ten times in 1:1-2:4a; 5: 1 (P); the only word used by P when creation proper is spoken of; found in Hex. outside of P only in Gen. 6:7 (J); Ex. 84:10; Dt. 4:32; Num. 16:30, in all of which there are evident traces of the work of R or Rd (but used largely in later prophets; e. g., twenty-one times in the second Isaiah); J uses flWy and Y', words more general, or implying manipulation. (3) D'ftlE (1:1): thirty-six times in this pas- sage; relatively as frequent in P up to Ex. 6:3, after which it is used only in certain formulas, e. g. 'K f11", or as a common noun; before Ex. 6:3, P never uses 1nfl' (the ' in Gen. 17:1; 21:lb being due to R, as proved by Ex. 6: 2-4, and accounted for by the use of '" in immedi- ate proximity), but after Ex. 6:3, always. [Cf. use of ,11' by J (below).] (4) 1fl , );3 (1:2): only here in Pent., the latter elsewhere only in Is. 84:11; Jer. 4:23. (5) Dt1U (1:2): also in 7:11;8:2; cf.theexpr. in 49:25; Dt. 33:13.

(9) K 1l (1:11): not in J or E; in all fourteen times, Dt. 32:2; 2 Sam., 2 Kgs., Job, Ps., etc. (10) 'r (1:11): in P, 1, nine times; 6: 20, three times; 7:14, four times; Lev. 11, nine times; elsewhere only Dt. 14, which corresponds to Lev. 11. (11) 1VDK (1:14,15,16): only in this passage in this sense; in Ex. 25:6; 27:20; 35:8,14,28; Lev. 24:2; Num. 4:9,16 (all P) with reference to golden candlestick. (12) 1nl (1:17): this loose and general sense, instead of D1O or 'W~ , is claimed to be pecul- liar to P, as compared with J. (13) f'I (1:20 verb and noun): outside of P only once, viz., Dt. 14:19, which corresponds to Lev. 11; Gen. 1 three times; 7:21 twice; 8:17; 9:7; Ex. 1:7; 7:28; Lev. 5:2; 11, (fifteen times); 22:5; Jand E use j or fl3 ; cf.6:1 andEx. 1:7 with Ex. 1:10,20.

(15) 190nW1 (1:21): in 6:7; 7:23 (J), but this is work of R (see above); elsewhere in Hex. (exe.

The contrast is no less striking be- tween 'K in ch. 1 and ' '" in chs. 2 and 3, than it would have been between 'K and '. The use of " by J is very regular. Exceptions may easily be classified and explained, e. g., (1) when a foreigner speaks who is not supposed to have known the personal name of Israel's God, as in Gen. 39; (2) when there is a special reason for concealment of the name, as in the case of Joseph, Gen. 44; (3) when the use of '" would be inappropriate, as in the mouth of the serpent, Gen. 3:1; 9:27; a few other cases might be cited, but this will suffice here.

Of the 396 forms in Gen. 1:1-2:4a, 135 occur chiefly in P, while over 100 are entirely unknown to J as here used; this calculation does not include formulas like $1- 'K 4 ty ; 7l-ti , etc. 2. Of the 499 forms in Gen. 2:4b-3:24, 119 are of words peculiar to J. 3. It is of course evident that not all the different words thus cited may be called characteristic. In many cases the words referred to occur but a few times. It is true, however, that after making allowance for this element, there still remains a certain amount of material which in a strict sense may be called charac- teristic. This is seen most clearly in those cases where each writer uses a differ- ent word to express practically the same thought; e. g., tg*) and 014; 4 ) and YI, OP; I'O and p'J); ~iKr ( and rtv1 ntf, etc. 4. The argument from language, while at one time supposed to be the most important, is now regarded by critics as of least value, compared with other argu- ments. In weighing the value of such evidence, there must always be considered the question whether the writer, who has not used a given word, ever had occasion to make use of it. d. The Style.--The first chapter of Genesis is supposed by most critics not to be original with P, but to have been incorporated by him in his work from some</page><page sequence="8">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 25 outside source.* If this is true, it should not be cited as a specimen of P's style. The sublimity and stateliness which characterize it are not to be found in so striking a degree in other portions of P's work. Still, whatever its source, the chapter has been thoroughly worked over and may fairly represent P, while ch. 2: 1-4a, which is eminently characteristic of P, plentifully supplies anything that may be lacking. Ch. 2:4b-3:25, on the other hand, is an excellent specimen of J. In what follows, the word" style" will be understood to include not only "' form of expression," but "mode of conception."t 1) THE STYLE OF P. (1) Is characterized by a systematic (perhaps artificial) arrangement of material; this is seen in (a) the division into sections, of which this chapter, originally introduced by 1"1 f* Tg, is the first of ten (all with the same introduction), five in one period (creation to Shem), and five in another (Terah to Jacob); (b) the structure of the cosmogony according to the days of the week, each marked by ",.1 '"Y ;7,) ; (c) the gradual leading up of the whole story to the institu- tion of the Sabbath; (d) the progressive (really numerical) order of the material. (2) Is chronological, statistical, perhaps mechanical; this is seen in (a) the ten- fold division into sections; (b) the seven-fold division of the cosmogony; (c) the order of creation, e. g., man depending upon and following the animal world, the animal world following the vegetable, the vegetable world following the appear- ance of "dry land," etc.; compare the lists of names and figures given in the genealogical tables of ch. 5, etc., and the enumeration of census, etc. (see later). (3) Is minute, precise, scientific; this is seen in (a) the way in which the differ- ent species of the vegetables and animals are classified, cf. vs. 11,12; 24,25 (note the three classes); 29,30; (b) the repetition of the full description every time the thing is mentioned (cf. the same verses, and also 2:2,3); (c) the separation of each class from every other by the addition of jt or j,~* ; (d) the enumeration of the horological functions of the heavenly bodies in v. 14b. (4) Is rigid, stereotyped, condensed; this is seen in (a) such phrases as  g ~ t 9!'; (j) entire absence of the poetical, or even of the descriptive element, there being no metaphors or figures; (k) lack of the perspective in nar- rative (cf. especially what is to follow); (1) the ability to reduce so much material to so Small space; (m) in the condensed framework which is found everywhere except in the case of a very few particular points (to be noted later) to which he gives special attention. * There are some indications which point to the Assyrian account of creation as this source; but as yet little can be said with definiteness. + References are not inserted except where absolutely necessary, because (1) space is limited, (2) the matter is familiar to all, (3) subsequent cases will be cited where they come up.</page><page sequence="9">26 HEBRAICA. (5) is verbose and repetitious; this is seen in (a) the stereotyped formulas already referred to; (b) the repetition of v. 11 by 12; of 14,15, by 17,18; of 20 by 21; of 22 by 28; of 24 by 25; of 26 by 28; (c) the fullness of vs. 28-30; (d) still greater fullness of 2:1-3 (if the unnecessary words were omitted, how much would remain ?); (e) the particularity of details with which the different species of the vegetable and animal world are classified, vs. 11,12,24,25,29,30; (f) the use (1)t7~'Y in each specification, etc. This characteristic is so marked indeed as to render the material (especially in later passages, e. g. Num. 7:1-89, which is filled out by the repetition twelve times over of the same formula of seven verses), really wearisome. (6) Is generic, dealing with the class rather than the individual; this is seen in (a) the creation of the race male and female; (b) the creation of the world, the heaven and earth, every tree, every herb "after its kind," etc., etc.; (c) the formal institution of law which is the climax of every representation (see below on the other hand the peculiarly "individual " style of J's representation). Remark.-The examination of the material shows that this verbose and repeti- tious character is not inconsistent, as at first thought might be supposed, with its stereotyped and condensed character. The two features work well together, the first characterizing the form of expression, the second, the mode of conception. 2) THE STYLE OF J. (1) Is free and flowoing, even from the beginning, (2:4b); the writer has no order marked by characteristic phrases, but passes gradually and almost imper- ceptibly from the description of one event to that of another. There is no classi- fication. Man, the important figure, is taken up first, everything else grouped around him. (2) Is characterized by an abundance of stories and traditions; since it is to this writer we are indebted for the great number of those pleasing narratives Wvhich have made the patriarchal history so attractive; compare the stories of the ser- pent and the fall, the ejection from Eden, the cherubim and flaming sword, and later, of Cain and Abel, etc., etc., while no figures or dates are found, except those of a most general character. (3) is picturesque, poetical; the opening words depicting a scene for the imag- ination. Instead of a carefully tabulated enumeration of the different orders of created beings in regular graduation, the simpler first, the more complex after- ward, there is given a picture, the central figure of which is the first man, the back- ground being formed by a few hasty but masterly touches. Not "in the begin- ning," but before there was any plant of the field, or any herb, or any rain, or any man, was the time when Yahweh made earth and heaven. The scene was an arid waste, dry earth, because Yahweh had not yet caused rain to fall; there was no vegetation, because as yet there was no man to till the ground. But a mist arises</page><page sequence="10">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 27 and moistens the ground; clay is taken and moulded into the form of a man; breath is blown into his nostrils; a garden is planted, trees made to grow in it, rivers made to flow in it, while the man tends and tills it. The remainder of the scene is familiar and need not be presented. The whole is poetical in the strict- est sense. (4) Is highly anthropomorphic, abounding in the most familiar representations of God as "walking," "breathing," "taking a rib," " planting," "bringing ani- mals to man," etc., (see under "material" below). (5) is prophetic, that is, predictive and didactic; as seen in (a) the protevangel- ium, 8:15,16, the basis of all predictions; compare the fact that the predictions of the Hexateuch, as will appear, belong largely to this author; (b) the peculiar adaptability of all his material for purposes of religious instruction; (c) the strik- ingly prophetic spirit shown not only in the selection of his material, but as well in the presentation of it. (6) Is individual rather than generic, as seen in (a) the creation of a certain par- ticular first man and first woman; (b) the creation of a certain particular garden, certain river, etc.; (c) the simple and definite outcome of his representations, not in some formal institution of law, but in "therefore a man leaves his father and mother," etc. (2:24), or "therefore the name of that place was called" many times, or "therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew that shrank," etc. (32:33). 3. The Material.--The characteristics of style cited above are in some partic- ulars applicable also to "material." Here arises again the question of the origin of P's "ireation-story." But this may be set aside and the material considered just as it now stands. Space may be saved by taking the two accounts together: 1. P's account proceeds from the lower to the higher, the vegetable world-the moving world of meteoric creatures-the population of sea and air-the popula- tion of land-man. J starts with the highest; for, as he distinctly states (2:5- 7), when the first man was created there was no plant or shrub in existence. After man (cf. 2:7,8) came vegetation, which man was to maintain; then came the animals. 2. In P, vegetation appears only when the superabundance of water has been removed (1:10,11); in J, there can be no vegetation until the dry ground has received moisture (2:5,6) (and man has been created). 3. In P, man and woman are created together (1:27), and so definite is the statement as to lead some to suppose the idea of the writer to have been that man was created an hermaphrodite. In J, man is created (2:7); then vegetation comes (2:9), then animals (2:19), and only when the animals have been brought to man and named (2:20) is woman formed from a rib taken from the side of the man (2: 21,22).</page><page sequence="11">28 HEBRAICA. 4. In P, ch. 1:28 man is given at the very outset the earth to subdue and hold in subjection. In J, chs. 2, 3 he reaches this position through sin and punish- ment, is degraded to it after having occupied a higher place. Cf. 1:29, where the herb of the ground and the fruit of the tree are given him for food, with 8:13, where he is degraded from the position in which the fruit of trees is his food (here no labor was involved, cf. the legends of the Golden Age) to one in which he is obliged to labor, for "in the sweat of thy nostrils thou shalt eat the herb of the field." In 1:29 this was a part of his blessing; in 3:13 it is a part of his curse. 5. In P, the material is generic (see under style); in J, it is individual. 6. In P, man is created in God's image to rule over all the earth (1:27,28), that is, to have knowledge (for sovereignty and knowledge are the same); in J, it is sin for man to seek to be as God (8:22), to know the world. 7. In P mankind is already installed over his dominion, a populous race, with no premonition that it is necessary first to go back again to the time when there was no vegetation, and when Yahweh must take up a process of creation by personal manipulation, and man must pass through a complex tragedy to come out finally at a place very similar to that in which ch. 1:31 left him; in J, there is no reference whatever to the details of the chapter just preceding, nor to the institution of the Sabbath; the moulding of animals from the ground is narrated without a hint of the creation already related. There is no indication in either account that they stand related. 8. In P, the universe is conceived of as a diving-bell in water- 100 (1:2); the vaulted roof is the 09000 fjti (1: 6), with the Pt:) (1:10) as the floor (cf. how the flood is produced in P, by water let in from top and bottom at once (7:11; 8:2a), the sluice-gates (JVijig) in the floor (010} ) broken up, and the openings (fftig) of the heavens opened); in J, the earth is an indefinite extent of dry plain upon which water must be poured by Yahweh (cf. J's account of the flood, brought about simply by pouring rain down upon this plain (7:4,12; 8: 2b)). 9. In P, the record is full of accurate measurements, systematic chronologies (referring now to material, not to style), but all trace of color is excluded; while of J the most essential element is story. Remarks.-1.l Some say that the differences here indicated are obtained by a forced exegesis in accordance with a theory. It is claimed, however, that the forced exegesis is found rather in the commentaries which, upon the supposi- tion that these accounts were written by one author, have been compelled to recon- cile them literally to each other ? Do not the above statements rest, in every case, upon the natural meaning of the passage in its connection ? Which is the correct order ? (1) to decide that the two accounts must have been the work of one writer, and to interpret the language in such a way as to accord with this decision ? or (2) to interpret the language just as it stands, and from this inter- pretation to decide whether one man could have written both ?</page><page sequence="12">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 29 2. Differences may be contradictions, but are not necessarily such. The acceptance of the existence of these differences does not mean that the two accounts are absolutely contradictory, that, consequently, neither is of any value, and that the Redactor who placed them side by side was a fool. They represent different conceptions; and if they had not been very different, if they had been practically the same, the Redactor would never have given us both.* 3. It is not to be supposed that, in every case, the entire material of the orig- inal documents has been transmitted to us. When two documents covered the same ground in practically the same way, one was taken, the other omitted. When one document presented the material in different way from the other, either (1) that account was selected which seemed to the Redactor best to convey the truth as he understood it, or (2) as when the accounts were very different, both were given; of this latter method of procedure, viz. giving the narrative of the same event as it appeared in two or even three distinct documents, there are sup- posed to be at least twelve or fifteen cases in the Book of Genesis. 4. The theology. It will be possible only to indicate in a word the character- istic features; the development here of each idea is manifestly impracticable.t 1) THE THEOLOGY OF P. (1) The spirit is strictly monotheistic; the language of 1:26 in no way opposes this. Nothing could be more marked than the care which the writer takes to avoid any expression which might seem even to suggest a polytheistic idea. The absolute supremacy of the Creator is manifest. (2) Creation is described by "'), alternating with 9y ; but there is obvi- ous avoidance of the anthropomorphic terms of J (fyp , " 9, lnD, etc.). The simple command is ',;i, and the fulfillment, i-,t, . The divine activity is limited to command and approval. (3) So far as concerns the relations of God and man, the former is so much exalted above the latter whom he has made in his own image and blessed and appointed to dominion over all the earth, that any thought of divine jealousy, so common throughout antiquity, is entirely foreign. Man is given a divine capacity, and having received this, is assigned a divine destiny, viz. to subdue the world and to rule over it (Gen. 1:26). (4) As to attributes of God, power and benevolence are emphasized; a power which has but to speak and creation springs into existence, a benevolence which appears in the blessing pronounced upon man, and in the satisfaction with which the work, when' finished, is regarded. (Cf. the frequently recurring "and it was good.") * See a very valiable presentation of the point in HEBRAICA, Vol. I., No. I., by Prof. Her- mann L. Strack, "The Higher Criticism, a witness to the Credibility of the Biblical Narrative." t Cf. Ewald, Old and New Testament Theology. T. &amp; T. Clark, Edinburgh, 1888, pp. 113-139.</page><page sequence="13">30 IHEBRAICA. (5) A marked feature, already noted, is the progressive revelation which P presents. Here we may anticipate. The creation account is intended to reach its climax in (a) the institution of the Sabbath; a genealogy of ten generations fol- lows, and then comes (b) the institution of the Noachic covenant, the law of bloodshed (9:1-7); another genealogy of ten generations and then (c) the institution of the cir- cumeision(17); still later (d) the Mosaic ceremonial institutions (Ex. 25, Num. 10, and Num. 26-36); and finally (e) the fulfillment of the divine obligation in the covenant in the apportionment of the promised land (Josh. 14-22). This is the ground-work; the history given serves only to set forth and connect. 2) THE THEOLOGY OF J. (1) The spirit may be monotheistic, but the monotheism is not so rigidly exhib- ited as in P. There is only one supreme being, but in the representation there are other beings whose rights are threatened by the presumption of "the man " (3:22; cf. 11:6,7). The cases here cited are quite different from that in 1:26,27 (cf. above). (2) Creation is represented, however this representation may be interpreted, as the work of some one endowed with supernatural powers, but hardly as the work of an '" infinite" being. In each act, the means employed is indicated, viz., clay (2:7), or a rib (2:21), or skins (3:21). This is seen everywhere in J; cf. the plagues of Egypt, which are universally brought about by natural means, Yahweh causing a strong east wind to blow, in order to bring the locusts (Ex. 10:19), or to drive back the sea (Ex. 14:21). P .nowhere attributes to God the use of such means; but rather "he commanded and it stood fast." It is impossible to sup- pose that the author who in ch. 1 represents God as saying so majestically 11TV ';1')  '~'; p ').... 0' f)l , etc., should in ch. 2 represent this same God as laboriously gathering his materials, preparing them (e. g., "moisten- ing the clay ") and shaping them by personal manipulation. Shall we understand that the writer first prepared the account given in ch. 1 (cf. especially 1:27 which has so justly been praised for its noble simplicity and disdain of means), and then added, as his own explanation of this sublime account of the origin of the race, the details contained in 2:7,21,22 ? Granting that ch. 1 may be "reconciled" with modern science, will anyone attempt, has anyone attempted to reconcile ch. 2? And yet, why not, if the latter presents the same ideas as the former ? (3) In contrast with P, man is on free and even? confidential terms with God, as is seen throughout the narrative. Nor is this to be explained upon the ground of his innocence, for, later, it is everywhere the same in J. Cain in ch. 4 "talks back" in a manner still more free and independent, while Abraham in ch. 18 is respectful but at the same time familiar. In J the man is always nearer the level of his "Maker" than in P. (4) So far as concerns the attributes of God the representation, however inter- preted, is not so clear and distinct (see above). When man has eaten the fruit</page><page sequence="14">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 31 and thus gained one superhuman attribute, viz., wisdom (8:7), there is danger that he will gain another such attribute, viz., immortality (3:22); and that this may not happen he is driven forth from Eden (3:23). Add to this (a) the fear of Cain that he is to be sent where Jehovah cannot protect him (4:14), (b) the fear of Jehovah and those with him that man, if let alone, will become so strong as that "nothing will be withholden from them " (11:6); (c) the story of Jacob wrestling with the angel (32:22-32) and of the touching of his thigh because he was likely to prevail,-and the inference is that the attributes of Yahweh are not as definite or as strongly felt as were those of Elohim (in ch. 1). (5) While P understands the name fiT to have been revealed only in Moses' time (Ex. 6:3), and the conception of God which this name conveys to have arisen then for the first, J treats it, together with the rite of sacrifice, as primeval. Besides My , ' and ' as instances of his anthropomorphism, there may be cited pl "0 ' i ~2 ",r T~ ", and it is an open question whether bf It ") does not mean "for the breeze of the day," implying that the walk was taken preferably in the evening for climatic reasons. Here, too, belongs 2:21, in which the "deep sleep" is brought about not as a kind of anass- thetic for the surgical operation, but (cf. Gen. 19:17, "look not behind"; 3 82:27, the dread of daybreak; and the prevailing opinion that the sight of Yahweh would be followed by death) on the ground that the heavenly ones desired to be unob- served in their working. According to the natural interpretation, ch. 2:18-23 places Yahweh in the attitude of making various attempts to meet the wants of man. Just as in 11:5; 18:20-22, he is represented as resorting to personal inspection to ascertain something of which he is ignorant, so here he resorts to an experi- ment. Remarks.-1l. Reference has been made to the interpretation of ch. 2:4b-8, and similar passages. Whether these accounts be denominated "myth," "legend," "allegory," "idealized history," or "symbolical representation of real fact," it is nevertheless true that such conceptions are never found in P. 2. The question of the relative age of documents which present such differ- ent, though not necessarily contradictory, conceptions of God, does not properly come up at this time; it may, however, be referred to. While the majority of critics seem to be settling down to the idea that J's conception is that which stands nearer to polytheism, P-'s being the result of thought and spiritual develop- ment, the treatment of Ewald (cited above) is a strong presentation of the other view that P in its simplicity is the older, J being the later. 3. The Redactor found no difficulty in combining these two conceptions, for to him, as to all the world, both were true. J's ideas of God, which, regarded from one point of view, seem slightly removed from paganism, must be estimated quite differently, if studied in the light of the gradual revelation of himself which God, in his wisdom, saw fit to make.</page><page sequence="15">32 HEBRAICA. III. The Analysis of Genesis 4 and 5 (Cain and Abel, Lamech's Songj, Adam's Descendants). The fourth chapter (J) contains an account of Adam's descendants through Cain, a genealogical table of seven generations branching into three, with the stories of Cain and Abel and the song of Lamech; to this is to be added 5:29. The fifth chapter (P) except v. 29 contains an account of Adam's descendants through Seth, a genealogical table of ten generations branching into three. 1. The Language.-Only new words will be noticed except when something of special interest occurs. 1) THE LANGUAGE OF J. (1) D'0~C (4:1): cf. above under "Language of J" (13); J employs sparingly proper names, e.g. not "Deborah" (Ein 85:8), but " Rebekah's nurse" (24:59); not "Eliezer" (E in 15:2), but "Abram's servant" (24:2); not "Potiphar" (E in 37:36), but "an Egyptian," 39:2 (39:1, so far as it is identical with 37:36, is E, not J) and so, not "Adam" (see, however, 4:25, probably due to J2) (P) but "the man"; cf. 5:2,3,4,5 (P); note also that f0l1-fnl is inserted by R, cf. 3: 20; 4:17,25.

In this estimate portions of formulas and character- istics of style have not been reckoned. 2. In ch. 5 (omitting v. 29), excluding numerals (which might justly be counted as characteristic of P) and proper names, there are 181 words. Throwing out words forming part of formulas which are absolutely characteristic of P (for to include them would include the whole chapter except a few words in vs. 22, 24,32), there remain nearly fifty which are distinctly peculiar to P. ?. The Style.-It is necessary to call attention only to the more striking points. 1) THE STYLE OF P. (1) Is characterized by a systematic arrangement of material, as seen in (a) the introductory formula (the second of ten) nl1~l fi ; (b) the structure of the table, the end of each life being marked by 0091 (note exception in v. 24); (c) the ten-linked genealogy branching from Noah, aged 500 years, the tenth link, into three (cf. ch. 11, which contains another ten-linked genealogy branching with Terah, aged 70 years, the tenth from Noah, into three again). (2) Is chronological, statistical, as is seen from a mere glance at the contents of the chapter. (3) Is minute, precise, scientific, as is seen in the extreme and absolute accuracy aimed at throughout the chapter, a minuteness in striking contrast with the fabulous and grotesque traditions and mythology of other nations. (4) Is rigid, stereotyped, condensed, as is seen in (a) the exclusion of every digres- sion; (b) the reduction of the material to the dryest, barest framework possible, viz., a column of names and dates; (c) the absence of every semblance of life and color; (d) the fondness for set phrases; (e) the absence of historical perspective; (f) the use of this chapter as a thread of chronicle to connect ch. 1 with chs. 6-9, these chapters being, in the writer's opinion, the important ones; (g) the summary way in which Enoch's case, probably a long story, is expressed by the slight variation of "lived "' to "walked with God" (5:24), and of "died" to "and he was not, for God took him" (5:24). (5) Is verbose, repetitious, as seen in the monotonous "and he lived - years," "and he begat - ," "and he lived after he begat - , - years," "and he begat sons and daughters," "and all the days of - were," "and he died."</page><page sequence="17">34 HEBRAICA. (6) Is generic, as seen in the use of D mankind in 5:1,2, although by the very necessity of the genealogical method adopted, the word comes in v. 3 to be used in the individual sense of." Adam." 2) THE STYLE OF J. (1) lIs free and flowing, a feature which is better appreciated when we discover (see below under "material ") that J is using in this chapter the same material employed by P in the chapter following. (2) Is characterized by the presence of stories and traditions. Compare (a) the narrative of Cain and Abel (4:3-8); (b) the connecting of the various "arts" with Cain's descendants (4:20-22); (c) the introduction of Lamech's song (4:23,24); (d) the digressions from the genealogical list. (3) Is vivid, picturesque, poetical; as seen in (a) the absence of all sameness; (b) the several scenes pictured; (c) the care with which the fact that a genealogical table is being given is covered up, appearing in but a single verse; (d) the inser- tion of a poetical fragment (cf. later cases); (e) the conversational element introduced throughout, as in vs. 6,10,13,15; cf. 3:9,10,11. (4) is anthropomorphic in the extreme, as seen in the intercourse between Yahweh and Cain, the details of which need not be given. (5) Is prophetic in the proper sense of that word, viz., as furnishing religious instruction; note the teaching sought to be conveyed by the story of Cain and Abel, the account of the punishment of Cain, the description of the development of evil influences; but compare the lack of this element in ch. 5. (6) Is individual or localizing, as seen in (a) 4:14, where Cain is driven out of the favored region ;1ig into the unknown  ; (b) 4:16, where Cain takes up his residence in a spot definitely related to Eden, cf. 2:8; 11:3. (7) Exhibits certain peculiar marks, e. g. (a) the phrase gf t . (4:26); (b) the expression "knew his wife, and she conceived and bare" (4:1,17,25); (c) the clause t !, I1) or 949) and the name of some occupation, which follows a name of a person to introduce anything which it is desired to relate concerning that person (4:2b,17,20,21; cf. 4:26b with 9:20, ;?t* gtZ .h '2t ; and 6:4, Ot 3 r !rD , with 10:9, 13 0T0 MV), these phrases bearing wit- ness to the author's purpose of tracing the effects of eating of the tree of knowl- edge. 3. The Material. As remarked above, the material of both chapters is the same, with exactly the modifications which would be expected of two writers with the style and purpose which have been found to characterize P and J.

In reference to the material which thus forms the frame-wnork of both chap- ters and the form in which this material is given, the followwing poin~ts may? be noted :</page><page sequence="19">36 HEBRAICA. 1) Whatever was the original source of 4:17-24(cf. different views of critics), by its incorporation with J, this document, as the text now stands, comes to have a complete genealogy and also a fragmentary one, the former covering the devel- opment of the "evil "(?) line of Cain, and the latter, that of the "good "(?) line of Seth. We are to suppose that the links between Enosh (in this second geneal- ogy) and Noah were lost, 5:29 and 6:5-7 showing that there was once a more complete account of sin and of corruption. 2) The work of R in these chapters was (a) the bringing of these two lines into contrast; (b) the probable insertion of 8:20;* (c) the insertion also of 7Tf (4:25) and of ty.....n 3) J's genealogy is in the first place a seven-membered one, ending in a triple division; but in addition to this he gives three (not including Abel, who died without issue) collateral names, viz., Seth, Enosh (4:25,26) and Noah (5:29), and a second triple division. 4) P's genealogy, on the other hand, is ten-membered (another instance of his fondness for the decimal system); but examination shows the extra three mem- bers to be these same three collateral names of J's second line; while of the two triple branches, he naturally chooses the second. 5) A comparison of the two lines shows that, as for the rest, they are identical, except'that (a) there is a transposition of the names Mehujael and Enoch and (b) a slight alteration has taken place of 91 to P i), of 'N*'I2 to 2N)im, of iyi to bfi, of g Y to ', or of i to I, etc. It cannot be called a mere coincidence that the names are so nearly alike.t 6) While the two genealogies are practically the same, the differences are so great as to preclude the possibility of a single author having produced both; for granting that a writer might repeat a genealogy of ten generations in a tabular form, it is certain that he would not have altered the names and changed the order. On the other hand since the alterations are marked enough to take away the glaring character of the reduplication, the Redactor, whose work all through has been done in accordance with the custom of his times, that is, without the exhibition of a scientific purpose, would not hesitate to do here what he has done repeatedly later, viz., add the one to the other and preserve both. Here may be compared the large number of so-called duplicates in the book of Genesis, (see later). 7) Note in more detail the form and material of 5:29: (a) the sudden break in the rigid method of ch. 5; (b) the use of rwv which proves that it cannot be from the author of Ex. 6:2,3; (c) DM), in JE thirteen times, never in P; (d) * See Dillmann, Die Genesis, p. 79. t Cf. the view that these changes are due to a desire on the part of the writer to give to the descendants of Cain names with a bad meaning, and to the descendants of Seth, names with a good meaning; Lenormant's Beginnings of History, pp. 185,186.</page><page sequence="20">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 37 flOf , in JE five times (including Yy), never in P; (e) 1 (see above); (f) ilby for which P commonly employs fl ; (g) the reference in "the ground which Y. hath cursed," not to anything in ch. 1 or 5, but clearly to 8:17; (h) of "our work and toil of, etc.," to the same; (i)the reference of "comfort us.... from the ground,"' etc., to Noah's future work, viz., not the flood, but 9:20,21,22, the discovery of the vine "which maketh glad the heart of man"; (j) the pun on the name of Noah (cf. below); (k) the prediction made,-all in the highest sense characteristic of J. 8) Note, on the other hand, in more detail the form and material of 5:1-3: (a) the close connection with 2:3, without a hint as to the contents of chs. 8,4; (b) the "blessing '" (1:28) alluded to without any thought of its having been annulled by a curse (ch. 8); (c) the transmission of the "likeness of God " to his offspring as a matter of course; (d) the exclusion of all reference to Cain and Abel as Adam's sons before Seth, by the fact that (since everywhere the years enumerated before the patriarch "begat" are the years previous to the birth of his first son, the time after that in which the patriarch lives and "begets sons and daughters " is the time after the birth of his first born,) the genealogy deals only with descent through the first born (as do all of P's genealogies), Seth being conse- quently considered as Adam's first born; and if this is not the case, the 130 years have no meaning, the formula throughout the chapter is invalidated, the state- ment that Seth was born in the image and likeness of his father is meaningless (for would the writer say that Cain and Abel were born in some other image ?); (e) the words and phrases nl 1nth, r, K o, rt~'n , r1nr, 1)(, n3 ), O } 31 ; (f) the statistical, chronological, rigid style,-all in the highest sense characteristic of P. 9. Once more, in reference to the material of ch. 4, note (a) the references to domestic life, and to secular employments (vs. 2,12,16,20,22); (b) the etymologies furnished (cf. 2:23), of Cain (4:1); Nod (4:12); Seth (4:25); Noah (5:29); cf. later those of Japheth (9:27); Babel (11:1-9); Beer-lahai-roi (16:14); Ishmael (16:11); Zoar (19:22); Moab and Ammon (19:37,38) nearly fifty in Genesis alone; (c) the apparent contradiction between 4:26 (J) and Ex. 6:3 (P). 10. The fact that the genealogy gives us the origin of the arts and of the tribes as they existed in the time of the writer, viz. Cain and the nomads (cf. Num. 24:22; Judg. 4:15); Jabal, the ancestor of all who dwell (present) in tents; Jubal, of all present minstrels; Tubal, of all metal forgers of the present,-all this implies that there had been no interruption of the progress of the arts by a flood (which both P and J describe); cf. with this the parallel case of the origin given of the Nephiliin in ch. 6 and their existence still in Num. 13 at HIebron. As will be seen later, there is evidence in this of the employment in J of material from a document which did not know of a deluge.</page><page sequence="21">38 HEBRAICA. 4. The Theology.-There is space only for a bare mentrion of the more impor- tant points. 1) THEOLOGY OF P. (1) In general, the same lofty and majestic ideas of God are furnished as those seen in ch. 1. (2) Man is regarded as having been created in God's image; but there is no thought of his coming into rivalry or even into intimate relations with Deity. (3) Moral degeneration is either denoted by the numerical method (age of a 1000 years being regarded as the maximum; and every life judged by that stand- ard; or the nature of the death is a better indication, e. g., translation, of supreme goodness; perishing in flood, of wickedness) or is taken for granted until 6:11,12. (4) True piety is conceived of as a "walking with God" (5:22,24; 6:9), a phrase which in J would be meaningless, who allows everybody to walk and talk with God; the reward of goodness is escape from death, translation (5:24). 2) THEOLOGY OF J. (1) The representations of Yahweh in this chapter, e. g., as assisting in child- birth (4:1), as indicating by his look and action (therefore present in person) his pleasure and displeasure (4:4), as in heated conversation with Cain (4:6 sqq.), as one absence from whom meant loss of protection (4:14), as giving a sign that, if killed, he shall be avenged seven-fold (4:15), as one from whose presence a man may go out (4:16), are in accordance with a conception of God which, however commentators may explain these representations, P could not and never did entertain. (2) J assumes the name and conception of Yahweh to have existed from the beginning; just so the forms of sacrifice are taken for granted. Cain and Abel do nothing strange in bringing, without any instruction, a 0ffT to Yahweh. Nowhere does J prescribe sacrifice. Certain directions are given about the altar, and certain abuses are prohibited, but sacrifice is left to the discretion of the worshiper. Abram, Isaac and Jacob offer sacrifices and are blessed. In P, no patriarch ever sacrifices or builds an altar, any more than he uses the name of Yahweh. All this was yet to be revealed. It is only when the ritual is instituted at Sinai, Aaron and his sons are ordained, the altar built, and fire has descended from heaven, that men may sacrifice. (3) J seems to think that Cain should have had more knowledge than he exhibits. He should have known that Yahweh prefers a bloody offering; that he favors those who dwell in tents and have cattle, and looks with suspicion on the "man of the field" (cf. (a) Jacob, "a perfect man dwelling in tents ;" but Esau, "a man of the field" (25:27); (b) the Rechabite (Jer. 35:6-10), who is the ideal pious man, owning neither house nor field, neither sowing nor reaping, but cling- ing to the old pastoral life; agriculture and city-building being part of that ill- fated progress the beginning of which was a taste of the tree of knowledge).</page><page sequence="22">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 39 (4) J is interested in ethics, and so he presents with no uncertain significance the guilt of the murderer, against whose act even earth cries out, who is doomed to be deprived of the laws of protection, and who must, therefore, go out from the it9 and wander a prey to any man like himself who may strike him down (cf. also the institution of the blood-revenge). (5) J represents (4:26) public worship, feasts, sacrifices, etc., as now becoming general; while P (see above) places all this much later. IV. The Analysis of Genesis 6:1-9:29 (the Deluge, etc.). This section contains two entirely distinct accounts of the deluge, along with narratives of certain events immediately preceding and following the deluge. The material is analyzed as follows: (1) To P is assigned 6:9-22; 7:6,il,13-16a,18-21,23b,24; 8:1,2a,3b-5,13a,14- 19; 9:1-17,28,29. (2) To J is assigned 6:1-8; 7:1,2,3 (in part), 4,5,7 (in part), 8,9 (in part),10,12, 16b,17 (in part), 22 (in part), 23 (in part); 8:2b,3a,6-12,13b,20-22; 9:18,19 (or R), 20-27 (see below). (3) Of the material here assigned to J, the following is rather to be regarded as the work of still a third writer, incorporated by J, or joined to J by an editor: 6:1-4; 9:20-27. (4) To the Redactor who combined the accounts of P and J, the following is assigned: (1) in 6:4 I-Vfln a ; (2) in 6:7,   9 .... '! and )If;C ; (3) in 7:3, j 3 '13), perhaps the whole of 3a; (4) in 7:9, * and 0D'")3 17t; (5) in 7:23, i,-. . ... 010; (6) 9:18,19(?). (5) It is to be noted that (1) 7:23b (P) is made J by Bud., Kuen., and Del., Kautzsch and Socin; (2) 7:7-9 (J) is largely the work of R; (3) 7:17a (J) is made P by Bud. anid Kuen.(?); (4) 7:6 (P) is made R by Well.; (5) 9:18,19 (J) is made R by Kautzsch and Socin; while 9:18b is made Rd by Well., Bud., Kuen., 18a and 19 remaining J. In order that the analysis may be more easily appreciated, the text of the Revised Version is given, in which matter belonging to P is printed in this type; J's matter; in this type; the earlier source used by J, in this type; R's matter, IN THIS TYPE. 6:1. And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose. And the Lord said, My spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days be an hundred and twenty years. The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, AND ALSO AFTER THAT, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them : the same were the mighty men of old, the men of renown. And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him</page><page sequence="23">40 IHEBRAICA. at his heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man WHOM I HAVE CREATED from the face of the ground; BOTH MAN, AND BEAST, AND CREEPING THING, AND FOWL OF THE AIR; for it repenteth me that I have made them. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. 6:9. These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, perfect in his generations: Noah walked with God. And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. 6:13. And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. And this is how thou shalt make it : the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven ; every thing that is in the earth shall die. But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. Of the fowl after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall beforfoodfor thee, and for them. Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he. 7:r. And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female; of the fowl also of the air, seven and seven, MALE AND FEMALE : to keep seed alive upon the face of the earth. For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground. And Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded him. 7:6. 'And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters' was upon the earth. 3And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the ground, there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, MALE AND FEMALE, AS GOD4 commanded Noah. 'And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same 1 Well. makes this sentence R. Kautzsch and Socin make this word a gloss. s Vs. 7-9 were originally J, but have been worked over by R; this, as K. and S. say (p. 12), explains the discrepancy between the distinction of clean and unclean in v. 8, and the number two in v. 9. They are given as J. It might be better to represent as R. 4 Sam., Targ., and Vulg. have fl);p . 5 This verse has this position as a result of the Redactor's work, for it probably stood origi nally before v. 7.</page><page sequence="24">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 41 day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every fowl after its kind, every bird of every sort. And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life. And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him : and the Lord shut him in. 6AND THE FLOOD WAS FORTY DAYS UPON THE EARTH; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both fowl, and cattle, and beast, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. And every living thing was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping thing, and fowl of the heaven ; and they were destroyed from the earth : and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark. And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. 8:1. And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged; the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of an hundred and fifty days the waters decreased. And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark. And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more. And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried. And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry. 8:15. And God spake unto Noah, saying, Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. Bring forth with thee every living 6 K. and S. make "And the flood was....upon the earth," P; "forty days," R; Dillmann makes the whole of it J.</page><page sequence="25">42 HEBRAICA. thing that is with thee of all flesh, both fowl, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him : every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark. And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And the Lord smelled the sweet savour; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for that the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air; with all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered. Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all. But flesh with the life thereof, w hic h is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. And surely your blood, the b lo od of your lives, will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it : and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. 9:8. And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; and with every living creature that is with you, the fowl, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. And I will establish my covenant with you ; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood ; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud, and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth. 9:,3. And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.' These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth overspread. 9:20. And Noah began to be an husbandman, and planted a vineyard: and he drank of the wine, and was drnnken; and he was uncovered within his tent. And Ham, the father ofs Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, 7 Well., Bud., Kuen. make "and Ham is the father of Canaan" = R. 8 Well., Bud., Kuen. make "And Ham the father of" = R.</page><page sequence="26">THE: PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 43 and they saw not their father's nakedness, And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his yonngest son had done unto him.

The Style. 1) STYLE OF P.

(2) Is minute, chronological, scientific, as seen in (a) the calculation of the age of Noah 7:6,11; 9:28,29; (b) the notice of the kind of wood of which the ark was made 6:14; (c) its general fashion, 6:16; (d) its exact dimensions 6:15, cf. the details of the construction of the tabernacle by the same writer, Ex. 25, etc; (e) how it was caulked; (f) its window, door, rooms; (g) its three stories to accommo- date perhaps the threefold classification of animals; (h) the provision for food (6:21); (i) the rigid classification in 6:18; 7:13; (j) the classes of animals in 6:20; 7:14,21; 8:1,17,16; 9:2,10; (k) the use of .)3g , 3)lp r, Otp3yp3py etc.; (1) the trouble taken to declare the absolute universality of the flood;* (m) the legal plhraseology of 9:4-6. (3) Is rigid, stereotyped, as seen in (a) .'Tf  (6:9); (b) 'J-f 1f 1"n ' (6:9); (c) the regular formulas of 9:28,29; (d) the repetition of many phrases (cited below); (e) the prosaic command to Noah to leave the ark (8:15-16), as compared with the poetic representation of the dove and raven (8:6-12,13b); (f) his account of the exit (8:17) compared with that of J (8:20-22); (8) the barrenness of the symbol of the rainbow (9:14,15) as compared with its meaning and force in what was probably its original position (viz., after 8:21); (h) the lack of rhetorical perspective, the smallest detail receiving as much attention as the most important matter. (4) Is verbose and repetitious, as seen in (a) the repetition of 5:32b by 6:10; (b) of 6:11 by 6:12; (c) of 9*- ), 6:19; 7:15,21; 8:17; 9:11,15,16,17; (d) of '7V 't** * j' (or f .), 6:18; 9:9,11,12,13 (cf. 15,16,17); (e) of 193) ,09 in many passages; (f) in 9:8-17 as compared with 8:21,22; for all of 9:8-17, except vs. 13 and 15b, might be omitted and the thought be expressed (cf. the possible condensation of ch. 17); (g) similarity of 9:1-3 and 1:28-30. 2) THE STYLE OF J.

It is in every particular in contrast with that of P, since it * Now that science has demonstrated the impossibility of supposing that a universalt deluge ever took place, it is quite common for interpreters to reconcile the statements of the Bible con- cerning the deluge with science, by understanding the language of the biblical narrative to be merely oriental exaggeration. However this may be, can any one read the statement in 7:19-23 and doubt for a moment that the writer of it believed, or, at all events, was endeavoring to make others believe that the flood was absolutely universal ?</page><page sequence="29">46 HEBRAICA. (1) Isfree and flowing, as will be felt by even a hasty perusal of the material, separated from that of P. (2) Is characterized by the introduction of the ancient story of Noah's drunk- enness, 9:20-24; and the ancient song conveying Noah's blessing and curse, 9:25- 27; cf. 4:22-24. (3) Is picturesque and poetical, as seen in (a) the use of the graphic fl. instead of P's nfl ; (b) his summarization of what is unimportant, cf. 7:1 with 6:18 and 7:13; (c) his expanding the poetic, as in the story of the dove and raven, 8:6-11; 8:20-22; (d) his mention of the time of day 8:11, cf. also 15:12; 18:1; 19:23; 24:63, etc.; (e) a comparison of 7:22 (J) with 7:21 (P), of 8:2b,3a with 8:2a,3b; (f) the less scientific idea of the ark, with a D which can be lifted by the occupant. (4) ls anthropomorphic, as seen in the representation of Yahweh (a) repenting that he has created man at all (6:7); (b) closing the door after Noah has entered the ark (7:16b); (c) smelling the sweet odor of the sacrifice (8:21); (d) repent- ing that he has wrought this great destruction among men (8:2); (e) promising never to do so again (8:22). 3. The Material.--It is perhaps easier to present the essential features of the material in a series of remarks, rather than by a minutely drawn con- trast. 1. The material is throughout duplicated: (a) 6:5-8 = 6:9-22; (b) 7:7,10,12, 16b = 7:6,11,13-16a; 7:22,23 --= 7:21; (d) 8:2b,3a = 8:2a,3b; (e) 8:13b = 8:13a,14; (b) 8:20-22 = 9:1-17. A careful comparison of these passages shows the evi- dence of two distinct accounts.* 2. As to the duration of the deluge there is, however, a strong contrast in the material, and as the text now stands it is impossible to produce an orderly chron- ological succession. Follow by way of experiment the language and style of J and P as gathered from previous sections, accept the analysis which these pecul- iarities offer, and we have the following representations: (a) ACCORDING TO J. 7:4, Yahweh speaks: yet 7 days and I will cause it to rain 40 days and 40 nights ....................................

This is a total of 12 lunar months of about 29 3/5 days -- 10 intercalary days = 1 year of 365 1/5 days.*t 3. As to the form of the ark there is also a different representation: P's ark has a "window-system," "light" ('~70) all around it, and so cannot be "opened "; J's has a "window " which Noah opens and shuts; P's has a "door in the side "; J's has a "cover" apparently on top (cf. 6:16; 8:6,13b). 4. It is to be noted in reference to the passages relating to clean and unclean, that P nowhere makes any such distinction, since this would be an anachronism of which he would not be guilty; cf. what has been said of f, sacrifices, etc. In 7:15 and elsewhere it is distinctly stated that the animals were "' two and two of all flesh," "male and female." J, on the other hand, always makes the dis- tinction, and directs the clean beasts to be taken "seven by seven" (7:2,3 have been in part worked over by R; 7:8,9, thought by Dillmann to be wholly the work of R, are at all events largely by R). 5. The general conception of the flood differs: J treats it as the result of an exceptionally long and heavy rain, a freshet; P makes it something of a strangely miraculous nature, the details being consistent with his cosmological system. J makes the flood local, limited; P, being always generic rather than individual, thinks of "the whole earth," and with precision describes the rise of the waters till the tops of the highest mountains which are under the heavens are covered,-a universal deluge. In J the water runs off, dries up; in P it is reabsorbed by the t~f , cf. 8:3a with 3b, and 8:7,8,11,13b with 8:1. 6. While the contrasts between P and J are so marked, the internal consist- ency of each is just as clear, e. g. (a) in J, 6:3 (God's spirit in man) refers to 2:7,8; * Compare the exact figures for 1 mean synodical revolution of the moon, viz., 39 days 12 hrs. 44 mins., 2.87 sees., and for the year 365. 256 days. t For a discussion of the duration of the deluge, see commentaries in loco, especially Dill- man, Die Genesis; Delitzsch, A 1New Commentary on Genesis (Vol. I. just translated). Compare also the suggestion (given here with slight changes) of Lenormant, Beginnings of History, pp. 414, 415, as to the manner in which the Redactor combined the accounts of J and E: The deluge begins the 17th of 2d month (from P) ....................... J17th of Marheshvan; At the end of 40 days (from J) the waters'of the deluge have reached their greatest height, and the ark floats thereupon................ toward the beginning of the month of TIibth. The strength of the cataclysm lasts in all 150 days (from P), includ- ing the 40 days above, and on the 1ith of the 7th ;month the ark is grounded upon the top of Ar&amp;rat..................................... 17th of Nisin.

He waits 57 days longer, that the soil may have time to harden, and goes forth from the ark on the 27th of the 2d month (from P).. 27th of Marheshvan.</page><page sequence="32">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 49 6:4 (the Nephilim) to Num. 18:33 (J); 6:5 (the evil of man's heart) demands 8:21; 6:8 (Noah's acceptance by God) presupposes 5:29; 8:21 (the promise not again to curse) refers to 8:17-19; (b) in P, 6:9,10 (Noah's character and family) shows dis- tinct connection with 5:32, also 5:22,24; 6:11,12 (the wicked ones of the earth) is in agreement with the unwritten contrast of 5:21-23; 6:18a (the promise of a covenant) demands 9:8-17; 6:18b,19,20 (the directions for entering the ark) demands 7:13-16; 8:17 (the directions for leaving the ark) demands 9:1; 9:6b (man's creation in God's image) refers to 1:27 and 5:1-3. There are still other indications of this consistency. 7. The account of the m6salliance of the angelic beings (6:1-4) (this is the only interpretation which has any real ground)* is evidently foreign to P. Its usual employment to serve as an introduction to the flood story, the 120 years being the time when "the long suffering of God waited in the days of Noah," is very doubtful, in view of the reference in Num. 18:33 and of J's predilection for furnishing explanatory stories. It is evidently an explanation of the gigantic stature of the Anakim of Hebron before whom Israel's spies were as grasshoppers. As to the incompatibility of this, in common with 4:20-22, with any account of a flood, whether P or J, notice will be taken later. 8. The Noah-story in 9:20-27, when compared with P's material, is in striking contrast. Just as the priestly compiler of Chronicles passes over lightly the dark passages in David's life, where he refers to them at all, while the prophetic nar- rators in Samuel and Kings handle these passages without gloves, so P (a priest) and J (a prophet) stand related. The former knows of no strife between the herdmen of Lot and of Abram, their separation being due to lack of room (18:6). P does not understand that Jacob deceived his father, quarreled with Esau, and on this account fled to Mesopotamia; but (36:7) Esau separated from him because their possessions were too great for the land to endure them, and (27:46-28:2) Jacob went to Mesopotamia to get a wife of the family of his ancestors. Every- where an extreme degree of propriety characterizes his heroes. It is inconceivable that P's narration of the man "who was perfect in his generations" and "walked with God" should contain Gen. 9:20-27. Concerning this passage, however, more will be said. 4. The Theology.--We notice the same general conceptions of God, of man's relation to God, and of divine working in this section as in the previous sections. 1) THE THEOLOGY OF P. (1) The representation of God is lofty, dignified, and in striking contrast with that of J (see below). (2) The only man to be saved from the impending destruction, is one who is perfect and blameless (8:9), and who, like Enoch, walks with God. Noah's * The various attempts of commentators to explain this passage otherwise are as familiar as they are impossible; of. Dillmann, Die Genesis, pp. 111-119.</page><page sequence="33">50 HEBRAWCA. obedience, though mentioned by P and J, is emphasized by the former; cf. 6:22 with 7:1. (3) There is nowhere any reference to altars, sacrifice, the clean and unclean; for according to P's conception all these were revealed first to Moses. Cf. 7:15,16 with 7:2; and 9:1-17 with 8:20,21. (4) Man is destroyed because of his wickedness, but there is something still beyond; there is, in fact, a great purpose in this destruction: the establishment of a covenant and the revelation of divine law. This is the supreme end which P has always in mind. We have here both a covenant and legislation. This is the second step; the first was narrated in ch. 1, the third and fourth are still in the future. (5) In the description of events P magnifies and dignifies the supernatural. What in J is a natural event becomes in P the fiat of Almighty power. Note (a) the entrance of Noah into the ark with a pair of every kind of beast and bird (7:14-16), for which J has no corresponding miracle; (b) how, according to P, God remembered Noah and every living thing, etc., in the ark; and God made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters assuaged, etc. (8:1), and God spake unto Noah and said, Go forth, etc. (8:15,16); while, from J, we learn that when the rain had ceased, it began to dry up, and that Noah looked out and ascertained for himself the condition of things by making an ingenious, yet natural, use of his dumb companions, the raven and the dove; (c) that, in general, P's heroes never move without directions from God; that these directions are always exceedingly explicit; and that the heroes go just so far and no farther; e. g., Noah, according to P, does not experiment on the state of the weather; he does not even venture to leave the ark for two months after "the waters were dried up from off the earth" (8:13a); he remains quiet until God commands him, "Go forth"; then he "goes forth," but nothing more. This conception of history, of the events in the lives of the patriarchs is everywhere characteristic of P, as will appear when the subsequent material is examined. 2) THE THEOLOGY OF J. (1) The representation of Yahweh, as in the preceding sections, is rather that of a supernatural being than of an omnipotent God. The God who "causes it to rain upon the earth," is a somewhat different (i. e., smaller, more limited) conception, from the Creator who opens the sluices of the "expanse " and unlocks the channels of the "abyss." The intrigue of the "sons of God" with mortal women (6:1-4), together with the preconceptions on which this rests (cf. 8:22; 11:6,7), while, everything considered, not inconsistent with the conceptions of J, as gathered from his material elsewhere, is far removed from anything which P has written. The anthropomorphisms are frequent and striking, e. g., (a) repenting that he has made man (6:6); (b) closing the door of the ark (7:16b); (c) mollified</page><page sequence="34">THE PENTATEUCEAL QUESTION. 51 by the sweet smell of the sacrifice and saying in his heart (8:20-22), " I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake," etc. (2) Man sustains close relations with Yahweh, has familiar intercourse with him and with the heavenly beings: (a) the women are chosen as wives by the angels (6:1-4); (b) the door of the ark is closed by Yahweh himself (7:16b): (c) man is regarded with compassion by Yahweh, who will hereafter plan some other method of punishment. According to P, "the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence,....for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth" (6:11,12). J describes it as follows: "And God saw that the wicked- ness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually" (6:5), and yet, although because of this wicked- ness he brings upon him almost utter destruction, for this very reason, viz., the innate depravity of man (8:21), he will not again do this thing; since nothing is really to be gained by it. (3) In accordance with what might be expected from previous sections, the distinction of clean and unclean (clearly marked out, cf. 7:2 with 7:15,16; and 8:20,21 with 9;1-7), the altar, the sacrifice of the clean, the burnt-offering, the sweet smell, legitimate enough from J's point of view, who understands all these to have existed from the very beginning, are in direct conflict with P's conception of the gradual progress of revelation. (4) Compare with P's conception of the philosophy of history (see under 5) above) that of J, who represents his heroes as doing what in every case seems the most natural thing to do. Whenever possible, divine aid is dispensed with; e. g., the waters run off of themselves (8:3a); once inside the ark and the door closed, Noah is able to manage for himself; various expedients are employed; when he has learned by his own effort that the land is dry, he disembarks, makes known his safe arrival and secures the promise that in the future man shall be let alone. Remarks.-1. The bearing of the Babylonian account of the deluge referred to above is not without interest. The more important question which it raises, viz., What relation exists between it and the Hebrew accounts ? is one which lies outside of the scope of this discussion. It seems, however, to throw some light upon the question in hand, and is understood by Assyriologists to. speak emphat- ically in favor of a double authorship of the Hebrew material. 2. It is possible, perhaps, to explain away some of the facts indicated above in the interests of a theory maintaining a single authorship, e. g., (a) 6:5-8 belongs to a section which closes with a statement of the divine determination to destroy man; 6:9-13, called by critics a duplicate, is necessary to introduce an entirely new section; (b) the variation in divine names furnishes no criterion for distin- guishing documents; each word for divinity has a significant meaning; the change from Elohim to Yahweh in 7:1 is intended to show that God now appears as the covenant-God; (c) in 7:16 the use of Elohim and Yahweh presents a vivid</page><page sequence="35">62 HEBRAICA. contrast, Elohim giving command concerning the beasts; Yahweh, the covenant- God, insuring the man's safety by closing the ark; (d) there is no discrepancy in reference to the number of animals; when the command was first given, 120 years before the catastrophe, the number indicated was a general one; when the time for action arrives an additional detail is given, viz., that of the few clean beasts seven shall be taken; (e) the repeated statements concerning the entering of the ark, 7:5,13,15, only lend vividness to the narrative, and heighten its dra- matic effect. Statements of a similar character concerning other points have been put forward. These statements are found to be in most cases unnatural and forced, while in some cases they are almost wholly untenable. V. The Analysis of Gen. 10:1-12:5 (Table of Nations, Dispersion, Genealogy, Call of Abram). Of this section there is assigned to P, 1) the t8ledhath of the sons of Noah, 10:1-7,20,22,23,31,32; 2) the tSledh~th of Shem, 11:10-26; 3) the tSledhath of Terah, 11:27,31 (worked over), 32; 12:4b,5.

The Style.-The old characteristics appear. Some of the specific cases may be cited. 1) THE STYLE OF P. (1) Is characterized by a systematic arrangement of material, as seen in (a) the introductory formula -l f" (10:1; 11:10); (b) the division under ngt (vs. 2-5); fl (vs. 6,7,20); Pg? (vs. 22,23,32); (c) the order of names beginning with the youngest that he may come to the eldest last and so carry on the descent from Adam through Shem in the line of the eldest son; (d) the colophon which closes each group, cf. vs. 5,20,31; (e) the concluding colophon to the whole table (v. 32); (f) the formal genealogy of ten members (counting Noah) branching into three with the tenth member (cf. ch. 5i). (2) Is minute, chronological, scientific, as seen in (a) the ethnological classi- fication of the nations (vs. 5,20,31) "after their families," "after their tongues," "in their lands," "after their nations ;" (b) the statistical character of this table as compared with that of J in the same chapter, which contains much historical and geographical material; (c) the precise statistics of Terah's migration (11:31), cf. 21:3; 25:12,19; 28:9, etc.; (d) the statement of Terah's age and death (11:32); (e) the statement of Abram's age when he resumes the journey (12:4b,5); (b) the regular formula for moving, "took his wife, and Lot his brother's son and all the substance which he had gathered," etc., cf. 81:18; 86:6; 46:6.</page><page sequence="37">54 HEBRAICA. (3) ls rigid and stereotyped, as seen in (a) T'fl~' rT ~; (b) the repeated colophon (see above); (c) the repetition of many phrases (see below); (d) the ab- sence of all variation, feeling, poetical touch; (e) the frame-work everywhere visible, etc. (4) Is verbose and repetitious, as seen in (a) the long drawn out genealogical table of 11:10-32, ef. 5; (b) the phrases which make up the colophon; (c) "Abram, his son," "Lot, the son of Haran, his son's son;" "Sarai, his daughter- in-law, the wife of Abram, his son," etc. (11:31), cf. 21:3; 25:12,19; 28:9, etc.; (d) "to go to the land of Canaan, and they came into the land of Canaan "' (12:5); (e) the redundancy of the second part of 10:1. 21 THE STYLE OF J. (1) ls full and flowing, as in all previous sections of J. (2) Is characterized by the introduction of story and prediction, as seen in (a) the allusion to Nimrod, the hunter (10:9); (b) the reference to the beginning of the Assyrian empire (10:10); (c) the story of the conspiracy against heaven, and the dispersion (11:1-9); (d) the blessing pronounced on Abram (12:1-3). (3) Is picturesque and poetical, as seen in (a) the discursive character of J's table as compared with P's, interrupting the list to relate an anecdote in order to account for a current saying (10:9), to give scraps of historial information (10:11, 14) or geographical material (10:19,30); (b) the varied form of the material, cf. v. 15 with vs. 21,25,26; (c) the interest maintained all through by means of little reminders of history attached to their names, and descriptions of character, e. g., "Nimrod "-he was a mighty hunter; "Shem "-he was the father of Eber; "Casluhim" -the Philistines came from thence; (d) the description of the whole earth as of one speech (11:1); (e) the characteristic explanation of the name Babel (11:9); (f) the contrast between J's heading (9:18,19), and that of P (10:1). (4) is anthropomorphic, as seen in the representations of Yahweh: (a) the expression "mighty hunter before Yahweh;" (b) the descending of Yahweh to see the danger which was threatening heaven (11:5); (c) the fear that man will soon prove so strong as that nothing will be out of his reach; (d) the exhortation to those about him to go down and confound the multitude (11:7). (5) Is antiquarian, showing special interest in sacred places and connecting with these places old stories. We notice in connection with Btaran, the first instance of this interest. In the material which follows, hardly a story is related which does not attach itself to some sacred place, tree or fountain, ef. the stories connected with Bethel, Beersheba, Shechem, etc., etc. 3. The Material.-This may best be considered in a series of remarks. 1. At first sight, the whole o~f ch. 10, if the claims heretofore made for P are of any value, would seem to be from that writer. Is not the entire chapter</page><page sequence="38">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTIOi. 55 a list of names ? But if the linguistic peculiarities of P and J, noted in chs. 1-9, be followed in this ch., it is found to divide itself into two divisions; and we have here a repetition of what has met us before, viz., two treatments of the same subject. 2. The aim of the Redactor in this ch. has been to fit the two tables together, in such a way as that they shall supplement each other, rather than to give us two parallel tables. In doing this, he has of course made many omissions; yet, notwithstanding his effort to accomplish this, there still exist evidences of a double frame-work, and also of duplication of material. Here may be noticed the following points: (a) The head of P's table is 10:1, that of J's 9:18,19, and these stand in significant contrast; (b) P closes each division of his table with a colophon, 10:5,20,31, J closes each division with a description of the region occu- pied by the nations enumerated; but of these descriptions only two remain, vs. 19 and 30; (c) P introduced each division by a formula, 7b' ' (10:2), Df l (10:6), Of )93 (10:22), J introduced his divisions as in 10:21 "1`1 "Tt. .' $, but of the three headings only this one remains. It is really surprising that R retained as much of the characteristic element of each table as is found; in this connection may be noted that (d) 12:4a is duplicated in 12:4b,5; (e) 11:30 is duplicated in 16:1. 3. In 10:7 (P) we read (important words underscored): "And the sons of Cush; Seba (D), and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah; Sheba (ggy), and Dedan." In 10:28,29 (J) we read as among the sons of Joktan (v. 26): "Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba (gg9); and Ophir, and Havilahi." P makes Sheba and Havilah sons of Ham (through Cush); J makes them sons of Shem (through Joktan). It is possible that there may have been two nations for each of the names. But since the "dwelling" of those mentioned in vs. 28,29 was (v. 30) in the same general direction (S. E.) as that of the Sheba and Havilah of v. 7, and since but one Sheba and Havilah are known to the Scriptures, these being prominent Arabian tribes, there seems to be little ground for doubting the identity (cf. Gesenius, 10th edition, which recognizes the existence of two Havilah's (p. 252), but under Kg? (p. 823) remarks, "The different statements exhibit different sources "). These cannot be the names of persons, in which case there would be little objection to the other explanation. 4. There is little or no narrative in this section of P, and hence cross refer- ences cannot be expected; it may, however, be noted that (a) 10:1 fits on well to 9:17; (b) 10:32 is followed appropriately by 11:10; (c) 11:32 connects well with 11:27 (or according to Well. with 11:28); (d) 12:4b follows naturally 11:32; (e) 11:10 agrees with 10:22, because a comparison of the names with their position on the map shows that in ch. 10, P enumerates according to geographical position and not age; (f) 11:10 connects this section also with 5i:32; 7:6; 8:13,14, and P's chronology in general; it may be asked: If Noah was 500 years old (i. e., in his</page><page sequence="39">56 HEBRAICA. 501st year) when he begat Shem (5:32), and was 600 years old when the deluge came (7:6), and Arpachsad was born two years after the deluge (11:10), must not Shem have been 102,rather than 100, years old when Arpachsad was born ? But P is a close calculator. Shem and Arpachsad were "begotten" at the time mentioned, not "born," and the statement in 11:10 harmonizes exactly with the other texts cited. 5. There are several references in J to the soctions preceding: (a) 10:8,9 is an allusion to the "heroes" whose origin was given in 6:1-4; (b) 10:25b points forward to the story of the dispersion, 11:1-9; (c) 10:10 refers to the "Babel " and "Shinar " of 11:1-9. 6. Even by the superficial reader there is felt a difficulty in passing from ch. 10 to ch. 11. This difficulty with others may be stated: (a) In ch. 10 the nations of the earth are settled "after their families, after their tongues (note this ex- pression), after their nations" (10:31). But in 11, without a word of warning, we are carried back to the time when "the whole earth was of one language and of one speech;" and the whole process of diffusion and differentiation of language, which had just been accomplished in one way, is now done over again in quite a different way (concerning this difference, see later). Ch. 10 describes the peopling of the earth, anda?lludes incidentally to the differences of speech; ch. 11:1-9 gives an account of the supernatural way in which the differences in human speech arose, and the consequent scattering of what was a homogeneous mass into differ- ent parts of the earth. Is it conceivable that the same author wrote both ? (b) But to what period does 11:1 refer ? We are told that, at this time, "the whole earth was of one language and of one speech ;" also, that vast multitudes unite in an effort to build a tower which shall reach heaven; again, that the purpose of this effort is, "lest we be scattered on the face of the whole earth"; and still further, that Yahweh is so greatly impressed with the vastness of their united strength, that he himself declares that unless this united action is interrupted, there will be nothing too great for them; and so he scatters them abroad upon the whole earth. What period will cover all these statements ? (1) Certainly not that before the deluge, for the writer is evidently speaking of a present Babel, and of present peoples; besides 10:25 would seem to be a reference to this story. (2) Then it must be after the deluge, but how long after ? 10:10 says either that Nimrod founded Babel (how, then, was it built by "the whole earth " (4:3)?), or, better, that it was not built by Nimrod, but having been founded in a preceding generation, existed in his day. The preceding generation was that of Cush; but at that time the total population of the earth was only sixteen families, even sup- posing all the sons of Shem, Ham and Japheth to have lived, married and had children; while if we include as separate families those of Noah, Shem, Ham and Japheth, there were twenty. But is it so remarkable a fact, as the narrative would seem to indicate, that twenty families should speak one language ? Would twenty</page><page sequence="40">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 57 families make up the mighty multitude of the story? Would twenty families be so impressed with their vast numbers as to undertake such work with such a purpose ? Would Yahweh be represented as alarmed because of the encroach- ments of such a number ? Would not twenty families scattered over the entire earth make a very sparse population ? (3) The difficulty still exists if the position of 10:25 is adopted; for (the * -*) of v. 21 and the whole of v. 24 = R) Peleg is no further removed from Shem than was Nimrod from Ham. (4) Even grant- ing the genuineness of 10:24, and understanding the period to be that of the fifth generation, we do not find the "multitudes" demanded by the story. (c) Ch. 11: 1-9 is therefore incongruous (1) with the P-element of ch. 10, for there the differ- ences of language are already spoken of as in existence; (2) with the J-element of ch. 10, although the writer recognizes it in v. 25, at the same time adopting a different theory as to the whole matter; (3) with any deluge story whatever, for it will not stand either before or after the deluge; (d) the people described in 11: 1-9, however, seem to be related to those (1) who intrigued with the sons of God (6:1-4); (2) whose first migration was "eastward from Eden, in the land of Nod " (4:16), and who are still journeying in the East; (3) who had built a city and cul- tivated the arts (4:17-24); (4) who had begun to multiply upon the earth (6:1), and whose life was limited to 120 years to prevent their attaining too much influ- ence (6:3) (5) whose numbers are now (11:1) so great as to arouse new anxiety and compel Yahweh again to interfere or "nothing will be withholden from them" (for the connection of these various passages see pp. 62, 63). 7. The table in 11:10-26 is (a) intended to serve the same purpose as that con- tained in ch. 5, viz., to furnish a list of the names connecting two important periods; (b) arranged on the same plan as that in ch. 5, except that it is shortened by omitting, (1) the total sum of years and (2) the concluding clause "and he died"; but (c), according to the Hebrew text, consists of nine instead of ten members, unless (1) Abraham is taken as the tenth corresponding to Noah of the first table (but he corresponds to Shem, not Noah), (2) after the example of the Sept. (which has inserted  " before "L , a suspicious insertion in view of the use of Pti in the preceding table, and the fact that the numbers of Shelah (130, 330) are given to him) we suppose that one name has been omitted, a suppo- sition exceedingly probable under all the circumstances; (d) as differently repro- duced in the versions as was ch. 5 (see Dill. in toc.). 4. The Theology. 1) THE THEOLOGY OF P. (1) Since P's material in this section consists only of (a) a list of nations derived from Noah's sons (in 10); (b) a list of Shem's descendants through ten generations (11:10-26); (c) five verses relating to the migration of Terah and the journey of Abram (11:27,31,32; 12:4b,5), there is nothing which throws additional light upon the conception of God entertained by that writer.</page><page sequence="41">58 HEBRAICA. (2) In the former narratives, P has always magnified and emphasized the supernatural, while J has everywhere described events in a much more natural way (cf. pp. 50,51). Is not the method in this section reversed? Does not P furnish the naturalistic interpretation of that most wonderful fact, viz., the dif- ferences of speech, while J gives the supernatural account ? So it would seem; but note that (a) what P gives us is not one story substituted for another; he simply moves on in the rigid, stereotyped style which has characterized him from the beginning; he is limited to the *l ' n '~  , and consequently has nothing to give but a table; (b) J himself has done practically the same thing; for, as has already been indicated, 11:1-9 is not originally the work of J, but of some other writer, and either taken up by J later, or combined with J by R; (c) the representation of Yahweh in 11:1-9 is one which P would not have accepted; for the introduction of such a story by P is inconceivable; (d) it is not quite cor- rect to say that P substitutes the supernatural for the natural. His peculiarity is rather that, having accepted the miraculous in a given case, he dignifies and magnifies it; he makes his representation consistent with his conception of God. (3) P does not think it necessary to state formally the reason for God's choice of Abram (cf. on the other hand, J in 15:6). His method of presentation, how- ever, suggests the reason, viz., Abram is the eldest son of the eldest son as far back as Adam. This was reason enough. (4) The time of Terah's migration is not, in P's mind, so important a period as J makes it. There is no occasion yet for an interposition of God, for a the- ophany. The regular scheme rolls on with its bare chronology of names and dates until, when Abram is 99 years old, God appears to him, promises Isaac and ordains in the same stereotyped and redundant forms of expression, the covenant of cir- cumcision (17). 2) THE THEOLOGY OF J. (1) The representations of Yahweh are similar to those already familiar. We find him (a) connected in some way with Nimrod in the form of a popular proverb (10:9); (b) coming down to see what the children of men are doing (18:21), to see if the report concerning Sodom's wickedness is really true; (c) alarmed because of the audacious attempts of men (11:6); (d) scattering mankind lest they become too strong (11:7); with which we may compare (e) man's expulsion from Eden because of his presumption (3:22), and (f) the struggle with Jacob (32:27). The fact that some of these representations are in material which was not original with J, does not affect the question; for in accepting the material he adopts as his own the representation. (2) J holds tent-dwellers and shepherds in high esteem; city-builders and artisans are wicked men. Shamelessness (the account is so meagre as to leave the matter quite indefinite) is abhorred (9:25-27). Drunkenness is not so dis-</page><page sequence="42">THE PENTATEUCIIAL QUESTION. 59 creditable as to prevent the transmission of Yahweh's blessing and curse by the utterance of one thus overcome. If we may for a moment anticipate, we find in his material the great mass of that undesirable matter of which Gen. 19:30-38; 25:22-26; 26:8; 30:14-16,36-43; 34 (the J portion); 38; 39; 49:4; Ex. 4:24-26 are examples. This is for the most part avoided by P. (3) The prophetic statements in 12:1-3 are important in making an estimate of J's theological conceptions; they constitute a part of that most wonderful series which includes (a) 3:14,15, the struggle between mankind and sin; (b) 5:29, the help and consolation which is to come through Noah; (c) 8:21,22 the assur- ance that another deluge shall not come; (d) 9:25-27, the predictive words con- cerning Shem, Canaan and Japheth. P contains no such element. Without going into the details of this passage, it will be seen that J (a) interprets the divine purpose as to the future of Abram's family; (b) indicates the features of the future; (c) announces that the future of all other nations will be determined by their attitude toward this family. (4) In this section there has been no occasion for reference to altars, shrines, sacrifice, etc. VI. The more Detailed Analysis of the J Document. When the P-elements of 1:1-12:5 are separated, they are found to constitute a complete unity,-a systematic, consistent whole, as far as the material under consideration continues. J, though much more homogeneous after the removal of P, has already been seen to contain certain incongruous elements, the chief of which were the passages inconsistent with the story of the deluge. Thus far nothing has been lost in considering the elements of J together, for while differ- ing from each other in a most striking way in respect to "material," they are, for the most part, one in "language," "style," and "theology," and in these respects stand in the same contrast to P. The more important of the passages thus to be distinguished and the grounds for the separation may be considered briefly.* Un- derstanding, for the sake of convenience, that portion of J, as a whole, which includes the deluge-story and the material consistent with that story, to be J2, the remaining portions will be called J1. Such a terminology naturally suggests that j1 is older than J2; but leaves entirely open the question whether Jl is to be taken as the original, J2 being an interpolation; or J2 is the real J, J1 having been incorporated. * The existence of the analysis does not rest upon the question of diverse elements in J. It was not the original purpose to introduce this question; but since (1) a presentation of the sub- ject as found in Gen. 1:1-12:5 would be manifestly incomplete without this part; (2) this addi- tional analysis rests largely upon but one of the four lines of argument generally employed, viz., the argument from "material," and thus presents an opportunity for testing the value of this argument when it stands alone; (3) the detailed interpretation of Gen. 1:1-12:5, if any analy- sis is accepted, is difficult except upon a consideration of the points here involved, it seems best to make at least a brief presentation of this matter.</page><page sequence="43">60 HEBRAICA. 1. Gen. 4:17-24, upon a careful examination, presents the following difficul- ties as the text now stands: 1) The section 4:2-16 relates how Cain becomes a murderer, a fugitive, an outcast from the society of men, dreading even to meet men,--a typical nomad; 4:17-24, on the other hand, presents Cain as an agriculturist, building a city (vs. 17,18), as if there had never been an event like that narrated in vs. 2-16. 2) The present text furnishes no answer to the old question, as to where Cain obtained his wife; as it now reads, nothing could be more abrupt or difficult than v. 17, "and Cain knew his wife," etc. Evidently this is a section of some different account in which the attendant circumstances were different, and the popular query, so often ridiculed, has a critical basis. 3) Cain, we are told in v. 17 "was building a city." This implies a number of men, and for this statement the original narrative must have furnished a ground; but it is more difficult to find even a small number of men at this junc- ture, than to find for Cain a wife. 4) The writer in 4:2 calls Abel a "keeper of sheep," but in 4:20 Jabal is termed "the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle," a designation which the context shows clearly to mean "father of shepherds," "the original shepherd." 5) The whole purpose of 4:17-24 is to explain the origin of the arts and of civilization; note the references to (a) the first city; (b) polygamy; (c) tent and shepherd life; (d) music; (e) manufacture of iron and bronze instruments. Fur- thermore the civilization, the origin of which the writer here describes, is the civilization of his own times. This could have been written only by one who knew of no interruption of human history by the deluge. 6) The seeming reference in v. 24 to v. 15 would seem, in spite of all these considerations, to show a close connection; but a study of the different senses in which tny~a by is used in these passages, serves really to support the idea of different authorship.* 2. Gen. 6:1-4 presents the following difficulties: 1) Although evidently intended as an introduction to the deluge story, it does not in any satisfactory sense serve this end. And besides, it is superfluous, since 6:5-8 itself furnishes a complete introduction. 2) In its present connection, the 120 years of v. 3 are thought to indicate the time during which mankind should still be allowed to exist upon the earth, a period of respite; but (a) 6:4 shows conclusively that the writer of these words knew of no story of the deluge (see below); (b) such a respite is nowhere else referred to; (c) according to 7:4 seven days are considered sufficient for the warn- ing. The 120 years, in the mind of the writer, constituted the maximum of human life; a limit is set in order to prevent man's attaining too great power. * See Budde, Die Biblische Urgeschichte, pp. 133ff.</page><page sequence="44">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 01 3) This section (6:1-4) precedes the deluge, in which all mankind except Noah's family perished; and yet it gives us the origin of the Nephilim, who are still living at the time of the exodus (Num. 18:33), and of the b'if , of whom one was Nimrod. Its contents are therefore entirely inconsistent with the idea of a deluge, and consequently with J, who narrates the deluge. 3. Gen. 9:20-27 also presents difficulties which can only be explained upon the supposition of a separate authorship: 1) Just as in 4:17-25 the chief idea was that of the origin of arts and civiliza- tion (Cain, a city-builder; Jabal, Jubal, Tubal, each the inventor of a distinct art; Nimrod a 'l'f), so here Noah is a husbandman, a r8le quite distinct from that of a navigator. 2) The actions here ascribed to his sons are hardly what would be expected of men over one hundred years of age, or of married men. They point rather to chil- dren playing around the tent-door. It is further to be noted that there is but one tent (" the tent"), which presumably was occupied by the father and three sons. 3) It is very difficult to explain why a curse should be pronounced by Noah upon the head of an innocent party, though a child of the true offender. The various explanations suggested are entirely unsatisfactory. 4) The story cannot be assigned to a period preceding the deluge; and obvi- ously it cannot be made an introduction to the table of nations. 5) The three sons of Lamech are made the fathers of the world, classified according to types of civilization. This would seem to be sufficient; it would, at all events, be inconsistent with this to classify the world again under another triad, as is done in ch. 10. This song takes a more narrow outlook, viz., Shem (= Israel), Japheth (= Phoenicia), the one spread abroad over the earth, Canaan, the servant of servants, i. e. the Canaanite in subjection to the yoke of Israel and Phoenicia (partners in a brotherly covenant, cf. Amos 1:9). Reference is made only to the ancestry of the Palestinian nations (cf. Budde in loc.). 6) But what is the point of connection between the Shem, Japheth and Canaan of this passage and the Shem, Ham and Japheth of ch. 10. In the adjustment of history after the deluge, in which all mankind perishes, the hero of the deluge, Noah, must be made the ancestor of all races. Ji, who knew of no deluge, represented the sons of Noah as the ancestors of the IPalestinian nations; J2 takes a broader conception. Noah's sons are the ancestors of all nations: Shem represents Asia; Japheth, Europe; but Canaan will not answer for Africa. The native Egyptian word for Egypt, x r'i, is introduced, and the triad readjusted according to the order of importance, Shem, Ham, Japheth. To make as little change as possible it is added that Ham is the father of Canaan. 7) Canaan, according to vs. 25,26, is to be a "servant of servants" to his brethren; now Canaan's brethren are Cush, Mizraim, Put (10:6); but the follow- ing verses show that the "brethren" are Shem and Japheth, to whom, for their</page><page sequence="45">62 HEBRAICA. paternal regard, this honor is given over the youngest. Noah's sons in this pas- sage are therefore Shem, Japheth and Canaan. 8) Put all this together, regard the words 'fl*  of 9:22 as the insertion of R, read vs. 20-27, and the whole passage is plain and unambiguous. Canaan is punished because Canaan committed the injury. 4. Gen. 11:1-9 was fully considered above pp. 56, 57; the considerations need not be repeated. Remarks.--1. It is to be kept in mind that (a) the general question of the analysis is not concerned in this more minute analysis of the J-elements, except in so far as it is necessary, when once the work has been undertaken, to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion; (b) it is in reference to the origin and relation of these separate elements thatcritics differ from each other, and not in reference to either the portions to be assigned J as a whole, or the particular passages which are recognized as distinct from each other. 2. Wellhausen, Bud., Kuen. and Kitt. practically agree in reference to Ji, as follows : 1) As to amount. (1) Chs. 2:4b-8:24, the story of Eden, the fall, the driving forth.* (2) Ch. 4:1,2bb,16b-24, a seven-linked genealogy dividing with Lamech, the seventh, into three, viz. Jabal, Jubal, and Tubal, who (a) are the ancestors of 'the race, viewed from the stand-point of occupation or mode of life, (b) correspond to the Shem, Ham and Japheth of J2. (3) 6:1-4 ? 10:9, the story of the origin of the Nephilimt (cf. Num. 13:33). (4) (5:29) 9:20-27 (exc. )~ bf in v. 22 = R), Noah, the husbandman, who discovers the vine and takes away the curse; his drunkenness; his prophetic song of the Palestinian nations$ (Israel, Phoenicia and Canaan).

Dillmann* separates the same passages, with, however, some slight varia- tions: (1) ch. 2:4b-3:24 is J2 (as we have designated it) except 3:20 and 2:10-15 (14) (2) 4:17-24 is J2, but based entirely upon an earlier source (Dillmann, E), (4:1-16 being misplaced); (3) 6:1-4 is from an earlier source; (4) 9:20-27 from a special source to be followed by 9:18,19, while 10:9,24 and perhaps 14 are by R; (5) 11:1-9, originally in a connection which did not include a knowledge of the deluge, but adopted by J and now in a true sense J's. VII. A General Resume of the Ground Covered. We may now consider, upon the basis of the entire material, the state of the case. What are the facts and the considerations ? 1. Language.-If we, provisionally, divide chs. 1:1-12:5 into two portions, the division being based upon a difference of style (strongly marked), a difference of statement in the handling of practically the same material, a difference of theo- logical conception, does this division find any support in the linguistic phenomena presented ? Let us consider the facts as obtained from an examination of the chapters:- 1) The total vocabulary of the section is................. 485 words. 2) Of the 485, those used by P alone number............. 118 " 3) " " " " J " ............. 246 " 4) " " P's total usage is therefore ............... 239 " 5) " " J's " " ................ 367 " 6) " " P and J use in common .................. 121 " 7) The total occurrence of words in the section is......... 3727 "' 8) Of the 3727 P has................................... 1858 " 9) " " J " ................................. 1762 " 10) " " R " ................................. 107 " 11) P uses 239 words in 1858 forms, each word............. 7.77 times. 12) J uses 367 words in 1762 forms, " ..........4.8 " 13) P uses 239 words in about 150 verses, for each verse.... 1.58 new words. 14) J uses 367 words in about 140 verses, for each verse ... 2.62 " * So also. essentially.

Remarks.--1. As has before been said, the argument from language possesses the least weight. It is only when connected with the others that its real influence is exerted. It cannot be accidental that, with a change of style, matter and the- ology, there is also a change of language. 2. The fact that P uses only 239 words in 150 verses, and uses them in 1858 forms is in striking contrast with J's usage of 367 words in 140 verses, used only in 1762 forms. The additional fact that P has only 1.58 new words for each verse, while J has 2.62, accords well with P's rigid, stereotyped, verbose and repetitious style,as over against J's free and picturesque style. 3. In the consideration of this point, it must be remembered that we are not dealing with a modern language, nor even with an ancient language like Latin or Greek; but with a language remarkable for its inflexibility. When it is appre- ciated that writings acknowledged to be a thousand years apart present few more differences than are sometimes found in the work of one man in our times, these peculiarities, insignificant as they may appear, are nevertheless very note- worthy. 2.

Remark.-Can it be a mere coincidence that those same portions which have a given vocabulary, always have the same characteristics of style ? Furthermore, is it not strange that there is so close a connection between the vocabulary of each of these writers and his style ? No one would for a moment think of com- bining the vocabulary of one with the style of the other. Such a combination would at once be felt to be incongruous. 3. Material.--If we make a rough division of 1:1-12:5 into two parts, basing it upon the occurrence of characteristic words, upon differences of style, and upon differences in theological conception, what do we find as to the material of these divisions ? 1) A duplication of the same material: (a) In one division (1) an account of creation; (2) a genealogical table of ten generations to Noah; (3) a statement of the world's wickedness; (4) a great flood sent as a punishment for this wicked- ness; (5) the deliverance of one family and of representatives of all kinds of beasts; (6) covenant and promise never to inflict a similar punishment; (7) a table of nations; (8) another genealogical table, to Abram; (9) the family and migration of Abram. (b) In the second division, (1) an account of creation, with a story of the fall and expulsion from Eden; (2) a genealogical table of seven generations (with practically the same names as in the other division), together with the story of Cain and Abel; (3) a statement of the world's wickedness, with the story of the sons of God and daughters of men; (4) a great flood sent as a punishment for this wick- edness; (5) the deliverance of one family and of representatives of all kinds of beasts; (6) sacrifice and promise not to repeat the punishment; (7) a table of nations, with a story of Noah's drunkenness and Canaan's curse; (8) traces of a genealogical table to Abram; (9) the family and migration of Abram. *6</page><page sequence="49">66 HEBRAICA. 2) Digferences, discrepancies and contradictions of such a character as absolutely to forbid the supposition that they have come from one hand (space need not be taken to repeat these). Remarks.-il. It is said: If there are so many discrepancies, and contradic- tions as to make it impossible to conceive of the work as the labor of one author, how is it possible to explain it as the work of a Redactor ? Will an editor be any more likely than an author to combine contradictory matter in one piece ? This question may be answered by noting (1) that an editor has done just this thing in Samuel (e. g. the different and even contradictory stories of (1) the desire of the people for a king; (2) the appointment of Saul as king; (3) the introduction of David at court), and elsewhere; (2) that much of the roughness of the patchwork was covered up by the insertions of the Redactor; (3) that in those days among all nations, and especially among the Semitic nations, there was an utter lack of that precision and scientific disposition characteristic of the present. 2. Can it be a mere coincidence that, in one description of a given event, there should be found one vocabulary, and one style of speech, while in an- other description of this same event, the style and language are different ? Furthermore, is it not strange that there is such a harmony, as has been found, in the language, style and material of each division. Would any one think of putting P's material into J's language and style ? 3. But is not this, in itself, a consideration in favor of unity of authorship ? Every writer changes his style and language in treating of different subjects. Yet (1) does the same author use two vocabularies, and two kinds of style in succes- sive chapters ? Does he write one paragraph in a chapter with one set of words and in one style, a second paragraph with another set of words and in another style ? Does he write one verse, or half-verse, in one way, and the following verse, or half-verse, in another? Would he keep up this sort of thing verse after verse, chapter after chapter, through several volumes ? (2) Does the same writer often tell a story, or furnish a list of names, or describe an event in one vocabu- lary and with one style, and then tell the same story, or furnish the same list of events, or describe the same event with another set of words and in another style ? (3) Does the same author repeat a story or a list, or a description, immediately after having first given it, and in the repeated form furnish matter so different and contradictory that for thousands of years men have believed the second statement in every case to be not a second account of the same thing, but an account of a second and different thing ? 4. Theology.--If we separate 1:1-12:5 into two divisions on the basis of char- acteristic words and phrases, style, similarity and at the same time difference of material, we find that each division is marked also by a different conception of God (accompanied by the use of a different word*), of man's relations to God, of * The exceptions are (1) the Elohim in chs. 2,3, and (2) the few cases in which the Redactor has used Yahweh for Elohim.</page><page sequence="50">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 67 the proper modes of worship, of God's action in history. These differences may be briefly summed up: 1) In one division we find (a) a rigidly monotheistic spirit, no word or expression occurring which could possibly be interpreted otherwise; (b) a lofty, dignified conception of God as powerful and benevolent; (c) a magnifying and dignifying of the supernatural; (d) man so far beneath his Creator as to give no occasion for any divine jealousy or alarm; (e) a strict adherence to an idea of pro- gressive revelation, which shows itself in the selection of a few great legal enact- ments set forth in a skeleton of history; (f) a conscientious withholding from any reference to God as the Covenant-God (Yahweh), to sacrifice, altars, clean and unclean, or ceremonial institutions of any kind. 2) In the other we find (a) a spirit which can scarcely be called monotheistic in the strictest sense; (b) a representation of God as a supernatural being, whose rights are threatened by man's presumption, who "breathes," "walks," "comes down from heaven," etc., etc.; (c) a dispensing, so far as possible, with divine aid, the heroes doing what seems the natural thing to do; (d) man sustaining free and confidential relations with Yahweh and the heavenly beings; (e) an utter indifference to the historical development of religious ideas; (f) the existence from the beginning of a definite ceremonial system, including altars, sacrifice, dis- tinction of clean and unclean, etc. Remarks.-1. We thus see that, from whatever point of view the material of 1:1-12:5 is regarded, there are such differences as to demand the hypothesis of at least two writers. Each argument by itself, with the exception of that from language, would seem to be sufficient; but when each argument strengthens and is strengthened by all the rest, the case becomes still more clear. 2. But let us look at it in another way : (1) We divide these chapters into two divisions simply on the basis of the use of the divine names, regarding as doubt- ful chs. 2,3, which hate the double phrase Yahweh Elohim; (2) we go through each division and note the language; we discover many words and phrases which occur in one but not in the other; words and phrases, too, for which in the other division corresponding expressions are found; it seems strange that wherever Elohim is used, it is accompanied by a certain series of words, and that it is just so in the use of Yahweh; (3) we go through again, and we discover that one divis- ion has everywhere a certain style (rigid, stereotyped, etc.), and that the other has a style quite the opposite (free, flowing, poetical); (4) we examine the passages again, and this time discover that really each division takes up the same events, the same history (creation, deluge, etc.); (5) we take it up again and to our surprise notice that each division, in spite of the similarity of material, has its own pecul- iar and widely different conception of God, etc. What must be the result of this fivefold examination ? Is this the work of one man, or two ?</page><page sequence="51">68 HEBRAICA. 5. The two J-elements.-Having satisfied ourselves that there are two writers, viz., P and J (unless this is granted, it is not worth our while to consider the parts of J), we come to the consideration of J by itself. We find in J certain material (1) incongruous with certain other material, not fitting into it or with it, (2) wholly incompatible with the idea of a deluge story, (3) with a certain bond of connection running through all of it, (4) with a conception of Yahweh as in a state of alarm, sending upon them great afflictions, not so much in punishment for their sins, as to restrain them lest they become too strong. This matter, though similar in style and vocabulary, is so distinct in material that we at once declare it to have been the work of a third writer; in other words, that there are two J's. The rela- tion of these two writers to each other may be doubtful, just as is that of P and J to each other; but this does not affect the question of their separate existence. 6. The Redactor.-Manifestly if there were two writers, and the work of both is now one piece, some one must have joined the two. In doing this he acted in accordance with the spirit of his times, as regulated by his purpose in making the combination. His spirit is far from being a critical one. He did not hesitate to use his material in any way which would best subserve his aim. He inserted and omitted; changed and arranged. He handled the sources used as freely as if he had been the author. The question of the time, etc., of this Redactor does not belong here. VIII. Brief Consideration of Some General Questions. It only remains to consider in the briefest possible way some of the general questions which suggest themselves to the student who has followed up to this point the presentation of the subject. 1. The relation of this section (Gen. 1:1-12:5) to the rermaining portion of the Iexateuch. 1) It is a most important section. Its matter is of peculiar interest. One exag- gerates but little in saying that Gen. 1-12 contains as many difficult points as does the whole remaining portion of the Hexateuch. It is the basis of all that follows. Whether the work of one or of three authors, it introduces us to sacred history, and it is an introduction the influence of which is felt in all parts of the body of the work. 2) It is a representative section. In a large sense, a decision of the question as it relates to this section, is a decision of the whole question. The two great writers, granting their existence, furnish us specimens, as characteristic of their work as any which follow. All the principles of criticism come up. 3) The section stands closely connected with a large amount of material gathered from Assyrian and Babylonian sources. There are Assyrian accounts of the creation, of the deluge, which so closely resemble the biblical account as to</page><page sequence="52">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 69 employ even the same idiomatic expressions in their narration. What is the mutual relation of the Hebrew and Assyrian accounts? Does the existence of the Assyrian accounts go to prove or disprove the theory of double or triple authorship ? 4) Two of the four writers claimed to be found in the Hexateuch, viz., E, who furnishes a history of Israel running side by side with that of J after Gen. 20, and D, to whom is assigned the bulk of Deuteronomy, do not appear in this sec- tion. Dillmann, as has been noticed, identifies J1 with E. 5) Certain kinds of material, especially the legislative element, which is the great element, have not yet presented themselves. This shows how small a pro- portion of the subject, after all, we have yet touched. The argument from legis- lation, a division of the argument from material, is, of all arguments, the most complicated, and yet the most conclusive (from whichever side viewed). 6) It is, therefore, in place to say: (1) If the facts and considerations seem to be clear and conclusive in favor of a triple authorship, remember that the theory must stand the test of application to the remaining books. (2) If the facts do not seem to justify this theory, remember that there is much new material, that there are new forms of ,he old arguments which yet deserve study. 2. Difficulties raised by an acceptance of the analysis of these chapters.* The following difficulties will arise in the mind of the student; it is only proper to face them: 1) If there is an analysis, much that is said in dictionaries and books on synonyms is valueless, inasmuch as two words which have heretofore been re- garded and interpreted as expressions of different thought on the part of one author, and therefore as very significant, turn out to be merely the variant ex- pressions of the same thought on the part of two authors. 2) If there is an analysis, interpretations based upon the sudden change of style, supposing it all to be the work of one author (e. g., from a dead, rigid style to a living, vigorous style, indicative of force, or characteristic of an eye-witness), must now be dropped, since this is merely an individual characteristic. 3) If there is an analysis, the sacred record can no longer be claimed to present a perfectly accurate account of these early times; for conflicting accounts stand side by side; changes have been arbitrarily introduced into the text; inser- tions and omissions have been made; the material cannot be called in a very strict sense historical. 4) If there is an analysis, there are two very different, though perhaps not contradictory, conceptions of God, one of which seems to border closely on poly- theism. How is it possible for so low (this is the proper term) an idea of God to have been incorporated in the Sacred Scripture ? * It will be necessary, perhaps, to treat this from a somewhat broader point of view than that implied in this statement. I do not purpose, here, to answer these difficulties.</page><page sequence="53">70 HEBRAICA. 5) If there is an analysis, one is at a loss really to know whether sacrifices, altars, distinction of clean and unclean, the name of Yahweh, etc., existed from the earliest times or not. One writer represents all these things as in existence; the other does not. Both certainly cannot be right. 6) If there is an analysis, even these chapters furnish enough to show that Moses is not the author of the Pentateuch; for if Gen. 1-12 was written long after Moses' death, it is presumable that the other portions of the Hexateuch which follow and connect with these chapters belong also to a later date. 7) If there is an analysis, and Moses did not write the Pentateuch, the New Testament authorities, among others Jesus himself, who seem to say that Moses wrote the Pentateuch, or at any rate to imply this, either must have been ignorant of the facts in the case, or knowing them, must have (1) consciously taught falsely, or (2) accommodated themselves to the literary suppositions of their day. Each of these possibilities is attended with difficulties. 8) If there is an analysis, it is probable that other Old Testament books will be found to have been put together in the same way; e. g., Samuel, Kings. The discourses of the prophets, e. g., Isaiah, Zechariah, may, likewise, be found to have been thrown together without much regard to time or order by later editors. The same lack of accuracy, the same proleptic method of handling material will be found to characterize all the O. T. so-called historical and prophetical writings. 9) If all this is true, the character of the Old Testament material, whether viewed (a) from an archaeological, (b) from an historical, and especially (c) from a religious point of view, must be estimated somewhat differently from the method commonly in vogue. If it is composed of different stories of the same event, joined together by an editor who did not have insight sufficient to enable him to see that he was all the time committing grave blunders, and yet felt no hesitation in altering the originals with which he was working, it is not historical in the ordinary sense of that term. 3. Dificulties relieved by an acceptance of the analysis. While in the minds of some difficulties will arise; in the minds of others who have long been troubled, certain difficulties will be relieved. It must be noted, however, that while these twelve chapters alone suggest nearly all the difficulties which the Hexateuch as a whole raises, a study of the Hexateuch is needed to reach conclusions which will relieve all the difficulties that have been felt by stu- dents in relation to this particular division of biblical material. 1) The material having come from two or three different writers, it is easy to understand why in this chapter a certain word or phrase (e. g., K" , b,;t , ,:3 'i '"It) was employed, while the following chapter in the same connection and in expressing the same thought used an entirely different word (e. g., itY , ,"?t , ifygg 7y'). It is true, the commentators have explained all this; but</page><page sequence="54">THE PENTATEUCGAL QUESTION. 71 as a matter of fact their explanations occasion more trouble than did the original difficulty. 2) The material having come from two or three different writers, these sud- den and inexplicable changes of style, in successive chapters, in the middle of a chapter, and even in the middle of a verse, become very clear. 3) There being different writers, the small inaccuracies, which could hardly be accounted for if one writer was the author of the whole, now have an explana- tion. It is not worth while to deny the existence of these inaccuracies; only ignorance of what constitutes an inaccuracy, or a perverse prejudice will fail to detect them. It is only natural that in material collected from different sources, handled by various Redactors, such should have arisen. 4) There being two or more writers, it is easy to understand how there have come down to us, side by side, two accounts of creation, two genealogical tables, two stories of the deluge, two accounts of the peopling of the earth, etc., etc. While it would be inconceivable that one man should duplicate his own material in such a way, taking pains to change his vocabulary, style, theology, and even the material itself, there is no difficulty in explaining the material as written orig- inally by different men. The harmonizing absolutely required, and as absolutely unattainable if one writer was understood to have written all, is no longer even necessary if there are two. Besides, we have now two different accounts of the same event, in other words, double testimony; and although this testimony is not always consistent, such, under all the circumstances, could scarcely be expected. Do we expect of the early times a perfect morality ? or a morality judged by the standard of our times? Then why expect a perfect historiography ? 5) There being two or more writers, the different theological conceptions which are so evident in these chapters receive explanation. It is clear that the Israelites, from the beginning, did not have the New Testament theological con- ceptions, as most commentators have endeavored to show. Just as there was a marked imperfection in their ideas of morality, an imperfection which could only be removed by degrees, so their ideas of God, though communicated to them from heaven itself, were imperfect, far short of what they afterwards attained, far dif- ferent from the ideas taught in the New Testament. They could not comprehend the real truth. They were children in religious faith, and even God himself must deal with them as such and not as men. This removes the many "moral " diffi- culties of the Old Testament. If these people knew God as we know him, if their ideas of him were such as we to-day entertain, how could they have committed such sins as those with which they are so frequently charged ? How could they so frequently have fallen into idolatry ? Their shortcomings as a nation and as individuals are better appreciated when once we realize that they lived not in the splendor of New Testament Christianity, but at the breaking dawn of Old Tes- tament monotheism. Whatever may be said as to the relative ages of the theo-</page><page sequence="55">72 HEBRAICA. logical conceptions of P and J, the two, though apparently inconsistent, present God in aspects which were, are,and always will be true. 6) There being two or more writers in the Pentateuch, the method of com- position being therefore compilation, we have harmony as to method between this portion of Sacred Scripture and all other portions (e. g., Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and even the Gospels of the N. T.). It is true that compilation is to-day regarded as the lowest order of composition. The mere compiler is not treated as an author. It would seem to injure the character of these books, if they are declared to be compilations. Still, even the most conservative scholars have long recog- nized the existence of various documents (in an undigested form) in these and other books. Now if this was the method employed as far down as New Testa- ment times, it is difficult to believe that a higher method was employed so far back as the time in which the Pentateuch is asserted to have had its origin. We must apply the same principle here as elsewhere. We do not expect to find at this early period the highest standards of morality, or the highest conceptions of God. Why then should we look for the highest form of literary composition ? We know that it was the child-age. To find a far more perfect form of compo- sition than existed when the nation had become civilized and cultured is incon- ceivable. A great difficulty is therefore removed by this representation. In closing this presentation I desire to refer to two points: 1) An estimate of the value of the Scripture material in general, or of Genesis 1-12 in particular, from the stand-point of the analysis,-that is, a statement indi- cating the opinion which one who accepts the analysis may entertain concerning the character of this material,-is reserved for the writer's third paper (October, 1889), in which the last portions of Genesis will be treated. 2) The writer has endeavored to present not only the facts and considerations in favor of an analysis, but also the spirit of that analysis; the two are insepara- ble. Everything has been looked at from the point of view of an analyst. The delicate nature of the undertaking will be appreciated by all. In any effort to present, without reference to one's own personal opinions, the views of others, there is danger (1) that the presentation may be one unfair to the parties represented, or (2) that the writer may seem to have given his own position rather than the position of those for whom he speaks. So far as concerns the first difficulty, he freely acknowledges the short-comings of the paper. It was a question of selec- tion and arrangement. Much necessarily had to be omitted. Points demanding a page could receive only a line. It is believed, however, that, upon the whole, a correct idea has been given of the critical views so far as they relate to these chapters. In justification of the particular method employed, he need only repeat what has been said before, that the treatment is intended not for specialists but for those who desire to enter upon an investigation of the subject for the first time.</page><page sequence="56">THE PENTATEUCHAL QUESTION. 78 Touching the second difficulty, it should be remembered that, after all, it is not a question of opinion, but of fact. It matters not what any particular critic may think or say. It is the duty of every man who studies this question to take up one by one the points suggested, and to decide for himself whether or not they are true. It is certainly possible to draw a line between the personal advocacy of a given position, and a merely professional presentation of that position; and yet it is equally possible for those who are so inclined, to fail to see the line, however clearly it may have been drawn. ADDENDUM. The reader is requested to note the following addendum after the paragraph numbered 6 on p. 48: 6b. The two stories of the Deluge may be summarized as follows: E oei : Noah in his time was a mt L man; all flesh was corrupt. God reveals to Noah that he will destroy the earth by a flood, and commands him to build an ark in which he shall take his wife, his three sons, their wives, a pair of every kind of animals in order to preserve life upon the earth. In Noah's 600th year the deluge comes, in part from the subterranean depths, in part from the windows of heaven. He enters the ark with his family and the animals. The water increases; the ark swims; it reaches a height of 15 cubits above the highest mountains; everything upon the land perishes; for 150 days the water increases. Then the subter- ranean sources are restrained, the windows of heaven are closed, and after the 150 days the water begins to subside. On the 17th of the 7th month, the ark rests upon the mountains of Ararat. On the 1st of the 10th month the tops of the mountains are seen. In the 601st year, 1st month, 1st day of the month, the water has subsided; on the 27th of the 2d month the earth is dry. Noah leaves the ark. God blesses Noah (cf. 1:28), appoints him lord over the beasts of the earth, and authorizes him to eat flesh; but forbids the eating of blood, and warns against the slaying of men. God makes a covenant, promises that there shall not be another deluge, and gives the rainbow as the sign of the covenant. The covenant is the goal of the whole story. JF-abccout: [The announcement to Noah of a deluge, of a command to build the ark is omitted.] Yahweh calls Noah and his family to enter the ark, together with animals, the clean by sevens, the unclean by twos, because within seven days he will bring a forty-day rain upon the earth to destroy all life; Noah obeys. After seven days, the rain begins; it falls forty days and forty nights. Yahweh closes up Noah in the ark. In the forty days the ark rises above the earth. All living beings except Noah perish. Then the rain stops; Noah opens the window of the ark and sends a bird to ascertain the condition of the water, first a raven, then a dove, and seven days later the dove again, who this time brings an olive leaf; then, after another seven days, the dove is sent but does not return. Then he takes off the covering of the ark and finds that the earth is dry. [The statement con- cerning the departure from the ark is also omitted.] Having left the ark, he builds an altar, offers of the clean animals and fowls an offering to Yahweh, who accepts it and de- clares that, in view of the fact that man's heart is evil from his youth, he will not again interfere with nature's order and laws.</page></plain_text>
