<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BOOK OF JOB: A SHORT READING. By Roland E. Murphy. Pp. vii + 137. New York, NY: Paulist Press, 1999. Paper, $14.95. Roland Murphy explains his project to us in the preface. The idea is to provide a short commentary about a long and complicated book since, "most people will not pick up a long commentary," nor will they "read the Book of Job from beginning to end" (p. 1). This is a worthy project and one about which he is quite clear. Constrained by brevity and the effort to keep up the narrative flow, issues of history, text, language, etc. are</page><page sequence="2">Hebrew Studies 42 (2001) 354 Reviews ignored or flattened out. But these are not his task, and he is right to work with the text as literature and as the expression of an author/final editor. Murphy's methods of biblical interpretation, though not elaborated upon in this book, are form-critical and literary-critical. He identifies forms (e.g., lament, oath, hymn) when pertinent and employs literary-critical categories (e.g., metaphor and personification) throughout. At times, he seems to understand form as figuration: expressing something that is separate from, but coordinates with, the content of the piece. He also endeavors to employ reader-response criticism by introducing the question, "What does reading the Book of Job do to you?", at the beginning (p. 1) and answering it at the end (pp. 129-132). Murphy organizes this book with a preface and introduction at the beginning, which establish the constraints of the project and inform the reader of important topics of Joban scholarship (date, ancient Near Eastern context, etc.). These sections will not be discussed in detail in the current work. Chapters 2-8 are devoted to the content of the Book of Job and follow the biblical book's major sections: "Prologue (Job 1:1-2:13)," "First Cycle (Job 3:1-14:22)," "Second Cycle (Job 15:1-21:34)," "Third Cycle (Job 22:1-31:31)," "Elihu (Job 32:1-37:24)," "God and Job (Job 38:1-42:6)," and "Epilogue (Job 42:7-17)." These content chapters are divided into smaller sections that are several verses long. He identifies the chapter and verse numbers via subheadings separating the section. This adds a clumsiness to the description in that it impedes the flow of the Joban story Murphy is telling. But it is a necessity if the reader is to be able to read the biblical text alongside Murphy's description. The last two chapters are "After-Thoughts" and "Does the Book of Job Have a Theology?" "After-Thoughts" is a thorough yet concise look at the major issues of Job study: its history of interpretation, the book's main points in summary, and textual issues. "Does the Book of Job Have a Theology?" visits five theological issues (God, creation, world-view, retribution, and spirituality) dominating the study of the biblical book and provides a personal answer to the question, "What does reading the Book of Job do to you?" The author's goal in this work is pedagogical: to present the material in simple and clear terms without neglecting the complexities of the subject matter. Murphy meets this worthy goal with the skills and vast knowledge of a great teacher who also happens to be a great scholar. He does not oversimplify the material, but rather he retains much of the complexity of the arguments, theologies, and images in the text of Job. He carefully depicts the anger reflected in Job's words and the divine mystery the Joban author/editor repeatedly directs our attention to, and he describes these major aspects of the book's expression with candor and balance; he never</page><page sequence="3">Hebrew Studies 42 (2001) 355 Reviews assumes a judgmental or preachy posture. His tone is confident and measured, and his focus is sure: Job's speeches are all about his relationship with the Lord, and the author/editor's stand on traditional wisdom claims is that they are inadequate when offered as an answer to unjust suffering. Murphy's choice to treat the Book of Job as a work of literature and the figure of Job as a literary character is made clear to the reader and is consistently adhered to throughout the work. In this way, he enables the study to be kept concise and focused, and it is fitting for a poetic masterpiece like the Book of Job. His frequent references to, and comparisons with, the lament Psalms are both interesting and instructive in this literary and form-critical study. His comparison of the figure of Job to the figure of Abraham also proves interesting and informative. Though this literary emphasis is appropriate and fruitful, there is one aspect of Murphy's use of it that strikes a dissonant cord for this reviewer: his discussion of anthropomorphic descriptions of the deity. Murphy makes the point here that, when the Lord is anthropomorphized in biblical literature, it is done purely as literary expression and does not describe something that actually happened. He writes, One of the most picturesque and intriguing [anthropomorphic depictions of the deity] is the Lord's dinner with Abraham in Genesis 18. In point of fact, the Lord did not have dinner with Abraham (p. 117). I think that Murphy has crossed a line here: departing from his discussion of the literary figure and moving into the realm of historicity. It is not necessary to deny the historicity of the account for the sake of treating the work as a piece of literature. His desire to separate out a fundamentalist approach to the Bible is described elsewhere (e.g., p. 120), and it is important to keep students aware of the need to put aside any rigid stance if one is to engage the text as the product of another community. But can anyone really say that these stories did not happen? This commentary on the Book of Job is delightful to read because of its confident presentation of the material (founded on vast knowledge), which is written in deceptively simple and pleasant narrative. The Book of Job: A Short Reading makes an important contribution to the field of biblical scholarship: it is a wonderful teaching resource because of its clarity on the major textual and theological issues. This book would make an excellent text for a course on Job or Wisdom literature. M. Beth Szlos Union Theological Seminary Yonkers, NY 10701 szlos@hotmail com</page></plain_text>
