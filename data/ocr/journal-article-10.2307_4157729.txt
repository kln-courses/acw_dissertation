<plain_text><page sequence="1">December 1948 ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 253 Vol. 60, No. 4 THE FExDING AND RELATED BEHAVIOR OF HUMMINGBIRDS, WITH SPEciAL REFERENCE TO TE BLAcK-cmNI, Archilochus alexandri (Bourcier and Mulsant). By Frank Ben&amp; Memoirs of the Boston Society of Natural History, Vol. 9, No. 1, October 1946: pp. 395-478, pls. 22-33, 4 figs. Cloth, $2.50; paper, $1.50. The rather ambitious title of this paper is misleading. The publication contains detailed original work on one species of hummingbird, Archilochus alexandri, with some references to published data on feeding habits of other species. The observa- tions on which the paper is based were made in Phoenix, Arizona, during the spring and summer months, 1939 to 1942. Trapping and marking hummingbirds is admittedly difficult, and Bene felt that this difficulty was "overcome to a large extent by adopting a system of identifica- tion in which notations were made of individual differences in physiognomy and habits." However, I believe that Bene's methods of identifying individual birds cast a shadow of doubt on some of his results based on field observations. The type of reasoning that Bene used in identification of individuals is illustrated by the fol- lowing passage (pp. 419-420): "There could be no question that this bird was one of the five or six that had been visiting the feeders the previous year. But which one of them? I resorted to the rule of elimination. She made no attempt to build her nest in the yard and ignored the nasturtium of which Fl [F indicates female] was very fond. So, tentatively, she was not Fl. She spent very little time in the yard, unlike F3... . She was a fully grown adult. Apart from Fl only one female adult had been patronizing the feeders last year. Therefore, she was probably F2. She was in the habit of entering the yard from the north and leaving in the same direction, a routine which corresponded with F2's last year. Her nest was probably in an oleander across the alley where a neighbor, while trimming it, had found an old nest prior to this bird's arrival. The location of the nest corresponded with the direction of her departure from the yard. Therefore, in light of these clues I labeled her F2 ?." Bene discusses "the quest for the optimum in breeding and feeding," "selection and defense of breeding and feeding territories," "feeding routine," "food consump- tion and regulation of diet," "feeding adaptation and technique," "flower prefer- ence," "sensory perception and recognition of sources of food," and "learning to feed." There is no question that many valuable contributions are to be found in this imposing list of topics. However, Ben6's anthropomorphic treatment of the topics makes it very difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. Bene also goes into considerable detail, the value of which I question, on the behavior of sick and injured hummingbirds. Ben6 did not claim to be an expenrenced ornithologist. The present study was carried on during a period of illness preceding his death in 1943, before publication of this paper. He deserves credit for working under what must have been a tre- mendous physical handicap. Although scientific names, some incorrectly spelled, are given for most of the plants, no attempt has been made by either the author or the editor to include scientific names of all the hummingbird species mentioned. The paper is well printed but there are several typographical errors. Many of the citations in the bibliography are incomplete. Since the paper was published after Bene's death, it seems to me that much of the responsibility for these obvious faults belongs to the editor. The twelve plates in the paper reproduce some interesting photographs of hum- mingbird habitats, feeding and flight postures, and food plants.-Harrison B. Tordoff.</page></plain_text>
