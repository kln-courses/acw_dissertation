<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MODERNITY OF THE REHEARSAL: BUCKINGHAM'S THEATRE OF THE ABSURD G. JackGravitt It is hardly a matter for dispute that George Villiers, second Duke of Buckingham, and his collaborators used The Rehearsal to satirize the great heroic dramatist John Dryden, and the genre of heroic drama itself.l In re cent demonstrations of the play's satiric intent and devices, Peter Lewis tells us, " The Rehearsal is the archetype of most later Restoration and Augustan dramatic burlesques"; and Robert F. Willson, Jr., concurs, calling it a "witty and delightful act of ridicule." George McFadden has added much new and useful information as to the political satire implicit in The Rehears al, but it is Sheridan Baker who deals with what makes the play continue to fascinate today's readers. The answer, according to Baker, is "this eternal flirtation between our love of illusion and our need for reality."2 Despite the importance of all these studies, no one thus far has satisfac torily explained why the play is so attractive to modern readers who know little about the conventions of heroic drama and less about Dryden's biog raphy. There is something modern in the work's appeal, and the foundation for it lies at a level much deeper than the topical satire which inspired much of the play's initial popularity.3 The modernity of The Rehearsal results, I believe, from its anticipation of literary techniques and devices present in today's Theatre of the Absurd.4 Buckingham's use of the play-within-the play and his creation of characters who rebel against their maker prefigure not only such twentieth-century plays as Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author5 and Joseph Heller's We Bombed in New Haven6 but also such contemporary films as Fran?ois Truffaut's Day for Night1 and Frederico Fellini's 81/2.8 When a modern audience first encounters The Rehearsal, it is likely to be overwhelmed by the satire that Buckingham marshaled against the conven tions of heroic drama; however, satire will not answer all the questions elic ited by the play, and it is at this point that the conventions of the Theatre of the Absurd become important. The main elements of absurdist drama pres ent in The Rehearsal are structural involution, plotlessness, devalued lan guage, and the equivalent of what is today called "Black Humor."9 Alfred Appel in his introduction to The Annotated Lolita explains the term involution: ... an involuted work turns in upon itself, is self-referential, conscious of its status as fiction [or drama], and ... [is an] allegory of itself, to use Mai</page><page sequence="2">THEATRE OF THE ABSURD 31 larme's description of one of his own poems. An ideally involuted sentence would simply read, "I am a sentence . . . ."10 The Rehearsal's techniques of involution are the play-within-the-play, or "playness" of the play, and the "interior" playwright-director's loss of ar tistic control.11 Involution begins in The Rehearsal with Buckingham's obvious use of an internal dress rehearsal. What is not so obvious is that this play-within-the play technique not only mocks the historical figure of John Dryden but subtly assails the traditional playwright's privilege of controlling the ongo ings of his plot. The general mode of this attack emphasizes the multi-lev eled view of reality present in the play?a view that enables the reader-audi ence to perceive various layers of reality. The characters of Bayes' play are in the first layer, for they understand nothing. The actors?who are vaguely aware of some of what the inner play is about and who can see some of its deficiencies?reside in the second layer. Bayes, who has created the "drama" and presumably knows more about it than anyone else, appears in the third layer. Johnson and Smith appear here also; and they, after seeing most of the rehearsal, challenge Bayes' knowledge and decide that his play is utter nonsense. There is no doubt that Johnson and Smith are correct in their assessment if we view The Rehearsal as being merely satiric, but their challenge to Bayes' artistic integrity indirectly calls attention to the prob lems of authorship in general.12 Finally, the audience?which is, of course, outside the play?occupies the fourth level of understanding. This audience should be aware of Buckingham's implicit invitation for them to question the validity of their perceptions as they view The Rehearsal in its entirety.13 Faced with this cross section, we are more likely to be confused than en lightened by this play's reflexivity, its constant calling attention to itself as being a play. The confusion, however, is aesthetically consistent with The Rehearsal's absurdist implications.14 Specific references to the reflexivity of Buckingham's play are present throughout the work. In an early conversation with Smith, Bayes brags that he has "made a prologue and an epilogue which may both serve for either . . . [or] for any other play as well as this."15 Such references remind the audience not only that they are watching Bayes' play but also that there exists a reality outside The Rehearsal. At another point Bayes reminds his viewers of the mechanical problems in the play's production. Since he feels a long, obligatory battle scene would be too gory for the ladies and too bor ing for everyone else, he represents the entire battle with "two persons only" (V.i.185). Here again the usual audience involvement is thwarted be cause of the absurdly self-referential nature of Bayes' work. Another method of involution used by Buckingham involves Bayes' lack of aesthetic control of his language, his plot, and his actors. Of the first, Prince Pretty-man's distaste for Parthenope provides an example:</page><page sequence="3">32 COLLEGE LITERATURE I'll sooner have a passion for a whale, In whose vast bulk, though store of oil doth lie, We find more shape, more beauty, in a fly. (IV.ii.46-48) Somehow Pretty-man, in his zealous denunciation of Parthenope, is side tracked by the monetary importance of the "store of oil" (in line forty seven). Aided more by luck than wit, Pretty-man gets back to his thesis in the last line, though the transition from whale to fly via a whaling voyage is somewhat mind-boggling. Bayes' language, however, appears almost tame in comparison to his runaway plot; for he admits, when accused of making false promises to Johnson, that he no longer holds the reins of his play: JOHNSON. But, Mr. Bayes, did not you promise us, just now, to make Amaryllis speak very well? BAYES. Aye, and so she would have done but that they hindered her. SMITH. How, sir, whether you would or no? BAYES. Aye, sir; the play lay so that, I vow to gad, it was not to be avoided. SMITH. Marry, that was hard. JOHNSON. But, pray, who hindered her? BAYES. Why, the battle, sir, that's just coming in at the door. (V.i. 155-66) The actors, who had refused to act an earlier Bayesian fiasco (II.ii.31-38), put an end to Bayes' current play after reading a summary of its fifth act. The absurd "argument" reads: Cloris, at length, being sensible of Prince Pretty-man's passion, consents to marry him; but just as they are going to church, Prince Pretty-man meeting, by chance, with old Joan the chandler's widow, and rememb'ring it was she that first brought him acquainted with Cloris, out of a high point of honor breaks off his match with Cloris and marries old Joan. Upon which, Cloris, in despair, drowns herself: and Prince Pretty-man, discontentedly, walks by the river side. (V.i.380-89) Disgusted by such drivel, the rebellious players abandon Bayes' play; and their insurgency provides the real audience with a further involuted look at reality. Like Appel's sentence, "I am a sentence . . . ," The Rehearsal forces us to ponder the very basis for existence. Just as in a fun-house gal lery of trick mirrors, like that of John Barth's "Lost in the Funhouse," where one is tantalized by the illusion created in his distorted reflection, so in the play the audience looks at life in entirely new ways.16 It has seen the creator at work, but his work is fallible and often downright ludicrous. The preceding techniques of dramatic involution are reinforced by two other absurdist devices, plotlessness and devaluation of language. Martin Esslin in The Theatre of the Absurd says that plays of this nature often "have circular structure, ending exactly as they began," and cause audi ences to wonder "not so much what is going to happen next but what is hap pening."17 Buckingham confuses the "world of the play" with the "real world." So it is that the Usher and the Physician in the play-within-the-play</page><page sequence="4">THEATRE OF THE ABSURD 33 cannot openly discuss affairs of state because it would not be proper for the common people in the real audience to know about them.18 The logic used in the play-within-the-play is not the same as that which Johnson and Smith use; but it makes some sense to the external audience, even though they may laugh at the paradoxes implicit in such logic. This audience disorientation is consistent in that it forces the viewer beyond the traditional interpretations of the play. Thus Bayes describes what might well be called his dark exposi tion: Now, sir, because I'll do nothing here that ever was done before, instead of beginning with a scene that discovers something of the plot, I begin this play with a whisper. (II.i.1-4) What follows is an extended dialogue carried on in whispers by the Usher and the Physician, a conversation which stops any exposition (II.i.26-30, 43-63). So it is that neither the plot of the external play nor that of the inter nal play progresses, for the only thing of real importance which happens in The Rehearsals that Bayes' play is abandoned. Along with this plotless chaos, readers will find further evidence of ab surdity in the devalued language of Buckingham's drama. Esslin suggests that the "radical devaluation of language" present in absurdist works re flects that "what happens on the stage transcends, and often contradicts, the words spoken by the characters."19 Bayes' most famous corruption of the language comes when he gloats over his use of "antithesis" in Act IV: "Reasoning! y' gad, I love reasoning in verse" (IV.ii.19). But here Bayes ig nores the fact that reasoning and verse are antithetical themselves. Poetry is suggestive, allusive, figurative?hardly a formula for argumentation. When questioned as to the meaning of his last play, Bayes can only ask, "Do you mean the plot?" (Li.72-73). In his absurd world, a bloodless coup d'etat is enacted when the Physician and the Usher merely slip into the throne room, "draw their swords, and sit down in two great chairs" (II.iv. between 76 and 77). From then on they are referred to as "Usurpers." As if this were not enough devalued language, Bayes equates talking "bawdy" with seduc tion (I.ii.38-71). Bayes also devalues the word death by destroying the illu sion of it in his play. After Drawcansir has killed all the soldiers on both sides near the end of the play (V.i.335-40), Smith asks, "But, Mr. Bayes, how shall all these dead men go off? for I see none alive to help 'em." Bayes replies, "Go off! why, as they came on?upon their legs .... Why, do you think that the people here don't know they are dead? (V.i.354-58). Bayes' answer also provides an introduction to the final element of ab surdist theater found in The Rehearsal, Black Humor. Esslin explains its re lationship to absurd drama by saying that Black Humor mixes "laughter with horror"20 in order to help man "face reality in all its senselessness."21 Esslin continues by suggesting that it is "the nature of all gallows humor and humour noir" to release "liberating laughter at the fundamental</page><page sequence="5">34 COLLEGE LITERATURE absurdity of the universe."22 Bayes in some vague, intuitive way grasps this reality and reflects it by his preoccupation with death throughout the play. In his "first prologue" Bayes plans to "come out in a long black veil" and be followed by a great "hangman . . . with a furred cap and his sword drawn" (I.ii. 144-49) who will decapitate Bayes if the audience doesn't like the play. In Act II, Scene v, Bayes introduces the dance of the dead soldiers and then begins Act IV by announcing that after so much mirth in the previ ous act he must "make this [act] to begin with a funeral" (IV.i.3-4). Though the audience has not been apprised of the deceased's identity, the two false kings eulogize her; and Bayes then reads lines which Lardella, the loved one, has composed "just as she is dying, with design to have it pinned upon her coffin, [to be] so read by one of the usurpers, who is her cousin" (IV.i.135-37): Since death my earthly part will thus remove, I '11 come a humble-bee to your chaste love. With silent wings I'll follow you, dear couz; Or else, before you, in the sun-beams buzz. (IV.i. 163-66) We may be inclined to share literally Bayes' own assessment of Lardella's verse when he comments, "Yes, I think, for a dead person, it is good enough way of making love . . ." (IV.i. 191-92). However, the Black Humor doesn't end there; for just when the false king's grief is verging upon a twin suicide, Bayes has the goddess Pallas intercede and the "coffin opens, and a banquet is discovered" (IV.i. stage direction after line 210). Though the fun of the scene is obvious, it is instructive to examine the re sponse of the audience. In its once-removed position from the play-within the-play, it is treated not only to the enjoyment attendant upon the zany madness of these twists of fortune but also to a glimpse into the alternatives from which Bayes may choose. Lardella does not have to be either reincar nated (as a bee) or resurrected (as she is). She could just die. Bayes, being both creator and creature, is not satisfied by the latter prospect and chooses to laugh at death rather than cry about it. Once the primacy of this observa tion about him is established, we can then begin to come to terms with the essentially positive aspects of his nature. Here Bayes' statement about the accidental and incomprehensible nature of individual human destiny is clear. There are no reasons for Lardella's continuing to live; in Bayes' world the causes are just not ascertainable, so why should he try to explain them?23 To the interior audience, all Bayes' dramatic machinations are pure nonsense, for it can see only snatches of his overall plan. Of course, his play is not the same as Buckingham's, but the two are complementary at this ab surdist level of interpretation. Buckingham reveals this human madness under the rather scientifically controlled conditions of a rehearsal. Bayes, in turn, becomes the experimental guinea pig whose human reactions to Buck ingham's stimuli may be studied as anthropomorphic projections of what a</page><page sequence="6">THEATRE OF THE ABSURD 35 creator-god's own actions might be. It is an imperfect measuring device to be sure, but given the specific time and place in human history?or perhaps any time and place?where would a person find a better one? This is not to say that Bayes is merely the mouthpiece for Villiers. Rather the relationship is much like that which Swift perfects between himself and the Hack in his Tale of a Tub. Bayes is an imperfect creation who frequently disagrees with much of what his creator stands for philosophically and aesthetically. Yet in his zest for living, Bayes' attitude seems at one with his creator's.24 Bayes subconsciously fears death, openly loves life, and defiantly brings what he thinks to be order out of the chaos which surrounds him. Thus his mind can contrive such poetic paradoxes as those Amaryllis speaks: Thanks to the powers above, for this deliverance! I hope its slow beginning will portend A forward exit to all future end. (III.iii.4-7) Such an empty yet emphatic oxymoron points up the discrepancy between the reasonable assumptions of man's limited view of the world and the paradoxes arising from these limitations.25 The Rehearsal was in its day one of the few overt challenges to a particu lar world view.26 Much of the drama of the Restoration era?especially the heroic variety?is compatible with the dramatic and philosophical conven tions of Broadway theater.27 But The Rehearsal suspends all these conven tions of exposition, character development, conflict, and climax in order to have the best of two worlds at the same time. As topical satire, Villiers' play is one of the best in the English language, yet as Theatre of the Absurd it mocks the very basis for its satire, the improvement of human beings and/or their institutions. The hack-playwright is what he is and he is proud of it. There is nothing to be done for his condition. In the absurd world of his play, the only hope for salvation manifests itself in the form of his feck less use of the deus ex machina,28 certainly an unsatisfactory answer for the problems he faces. But he doesn't seem to mind too much, and, undaunted, he has a grudge against the actors to keep him warm. As he departs from the stage for the last time, he bids farewell: But I'll be revenged on them [the actors] too; for I'll lampoon 'em all. And since they will not admit of my plays, they shall know what a satirist I am. And so farewell to this stage, 'y gad, forever. (V.i.425-29) The Bayesian spirit doesn't die with The Rehearsal but lives on through the Restoration and eighteenth century, where we find it not only in Swift's A Tale of a Tub but also in the Scriblerus Club's Memoirs ofMartinus Scrib lerus, Henry Fielding's The Tragedy of Tragedies, and Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy. Nor does the tradition die there, for these works antici pate such twentieth-century examples as Flann O'Brien's At Swim Two Birds and Vladimir Nabokov's Invitation to a Beheading. Given the nature</page><page sequence="7">36 COLLEGE LITERATURE of the human condition, it is likely that these literary anomalies will con tinue to appear. NOTES 1 George H. Nettleton, "Heroic Drama," in British Dramatists from Dry den to Sheridan, eds. George H. Nettleton and Arthur E. Case (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1939), p. 5. Nettleton states, "Thomas Sprat, the Duke's chaplain, Martin Clifford, Master of the Charterhouse, and probably 'Hudibras' Butler and others shared variously in the scheme of concerted satire upon serious con temporary dramatists." Since many of the absurdist devices which are used in Hudibras may be found in The Rehearsal, it seems likely that Samuel Butler had some part in writing Buckingham's play. For a brief account of the origins of Villiers and Dryden's mutual antipathy, see John Harrington Smith, "Dryden and Buckingham: The Beginnings of the Feud," Modern Language Notes, 69 (April 1954), 242-45. 2 Lewis, "The Rehearsal: A Study of Its Satirical Methods," Durham University Journal, NS 31 (March 1970), 96; Willson, "TheirForm Confounded": Studies in the Burlesque Play from Udall to Sheridan (The Hague: Mouton, 1975), p. 110; McFadden, "Political Satire in The Rehearsal," The Yearbook of English Studies, 4 (1974), 120-28; and Baker, "Buckingham's Permanent Rehearsal," Michigan Quarterly Review, 12 (Spring 1973), 169. Though Baker here touches upon one of the most important problems in the play, he has already concluded that The Rehearsal is a "comedy of blind conceit [which] everywhere transcends the personal satire in which it originates . . ." (p. 164). 3 McFadden, p. 120. Here McFadden argues convincingly that much of the satire in Buckingham's play is aimed at one of Villiers' immediate political enemies, Henry Bennet, Earl of Arlington, who "did wear a black patch on his nose" like the paper one which Bayes wears after breaking his nose. 4 See Martin Esslin, The Theatre of the Absurd, Anchor Books ed. (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday and Co., 1961), pp. xvii-xxii, 12-13, 48, 220, 229-96, 301-5, 307-11,313-16. 5 See Philip K. Jason, "A Twentieth-Century Response to The Critic," Theatre Survey, 15 (May 1974), 51-58. Jason launches his discussion of the rehearsal for mat in The Critic with a reference to Pirandello's play and then suggests, "Once the artifices of the theatre are laid bare, and the discrepancies between life as it is represented on stage and life as we know it are brought into focus, the relative truths and realities of each may be measured and evaluated" (p. 51). Though Ja son seems to overlook the "absurdist" implications of his study, it indirectly supports my arguments for the continuing modernity of Buckingham's play. 6 Though Heller's play doesn't use the rehearsal format, it does break down the barriers between the play and its audience by having the actors speak directly to the audience, acknowledge the fact that they are actors, and refer to their ap pearances in other real plays. 7 Truffaut's film uses the rehearsal format in that the screenplay is about a di rector making a film. The device is further complicated by the fact that Truffaut plays the director of the film-within-the film. Although Truffaut doesn't vi</page><page sequence="8">THEATRE OF THE ABSURD 37 ciously satirize himself in his film, the situation there is much like that of Dry den's being lampooned in the character of Bayes. Truffaut's preoccupation with the absurdity of death may be seen in the demise of the film-within-the film's leading actor just before the end of its shooting schedule. Bayes, as I will illus trate later, shares Truffaut's anxiety. See Truffaut, Day for Night, trans, by Sam Flores (New York: Grove Press, 1975), pp. 160-61. 8 In 8V2 Fellini presents another cinematic version of this creator-within-the-crea tion technique. Here again the director in the film is making a movie; therefore, the viewer sees the device of a movie-maker, Fellini, making a movie about a movie-maker making a movie. As in Day for Night, the character of the movie director is patterned after the real director, Fellini. 9 Robert Scholes, The Fabulators (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1967), pp. 35 55. Scholes says that Black Humor "is not concerned with what to do about life but how to take it" (p. 43). Black Humorists see life as being "ridiculous?a joke" and "offer us laughter" (p. 44). 10 Vladimir Nabokov, The Annotated Lolita, ed. Alfred Appel, Jr., (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1970), p. xxi. 11 Probably the best-known example of the play-within-the-play occurs in Act III, Scene ii of Hamlet. For a discussion of the "playness" of the play, see Norman Holland, The First Modern Comedies: The Significance of Ethereget Wycherley and Congreve (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1959), p. 100. Holland dis cusses the technique as it is used in Wycherley's The Plain Dealer. The "interi or" playwright is, of course, Bayes. It is convenient to refer to his play as the in terior or "internal" play while referring to Buckingham's play and the audience watching it as being "external." In similar fashion, Valerie C. Rudolph notes the various levels of reality in Fielding's The Author's Farce. See her "People and Puppets: Fielding's Burlesque of the 'Recognition Scene' in The Author's Farce, ' ' Papers on Language and Literature, 11 ( 1975), 31 -3 8. 12 Baker, p. 161. Baker says that the play "deals with a central and dangerous truth about literature itself." As he sees it, Bayes' problem is the "dilemma of authorship?to make something ever new from the ever old forms and the ever old stuff of life . . . ." On this point I am in agreement with Baker, though I ar rive at a different conclusion about the thematic effect which this dilemma has upon the play. 13 See Appel, in The Annotated Lolita, p. xxx, where he describes "the staging of the novel" and says: Nabokov the protean impersonator is always a masked presence in his fic tion: as impresario, scenarist, director, warden, dictator, landlord, and even as a bit player ... to name only a few of the disguises he has donned as a se cret agent who moves among his own creatures like Prospero in The Tempest. Like Nabokov, Buckingham has an encroaching omnipresence in his play, being a part of every level of its conception?internal audience and playwright as well as their external correlatives. 14 The main effect of most absurdist techniques in the theater is some sort of audi ence disorientation. 15 George Villiers [second Duke of Buckingham], The Rehearsal in British Drama tists from Dryden to Sheridan, ed.

Vieth, "Divided Consciousness: The Trauma and Triumph of Restoration Culture," Tennessee Studies in Literature, 22 (1977), 62, n. 25. Vieth cites this scene for much the same purpose as I use it. 19 Esslin, p. xxi. 20 Esslin, p. 300. 21 Esslin, p. 316. 22 Esslin, p. 304. 23 Here I am reminded of the conclusion of Kingsley Amis' Lucky Jim, Compass Books ed. (New York: Viking Press, 1953). The cards are all stocked against Jim Dixon, the protagonist; but his luck miraculously changes and he gets the beauti ful girl, puts down all his detractors, and falls into a job where he can be him self, even though there are no logical reasons for any of these things happening. In Amis' novel, however, fortune rules; and she has just as illogically cost Jim his teaching position as well as enabling a plagiarist to publish clandestinely Jim's article on "a strangely neglected topic," "The economic influence of the developments in shipbuilding techniques, 1450 to 1485" (p. 16). Lardella, no doubt, could "live" in Jim's world, too. 24 See John Harold Wilson, A Rake and His Times: George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham (New York: Farrar, Straus and Young, 1954), p. 103. Wilson says, "As for his pleasures (which were always described as venereal), they were such follies as hunting, racing, chemistry, music, literature, conversation, and, of course, love." 25 We see a similar but perhaps more openly serious usage of oxymoron in the final lines of Rochester's "Upon Nothing" where the "nothings" of society "Flow swiftly into thee [Nothing], and in thee ever end" (1.51). 26 See Vieth, pp. 46-52. Here Vieth discusses the "new dichotomy of con sciousness" (p. 46) which came into being at about the time of the Restoration and explains how The Rehearsal is an example of "reversible meaning" in a work written "upon nothing" (p. 47). 27 Esslin says that this kind of play has "the suspense created in a theatre con cerned mainly with the revelation of objective character through the unfolding of a narrative plot. The pattern of exposition, conflict, and final solution mir rors a view based on a recognizable and generally accepted pattern of objective reality that can be apprehended so that the purpose of man's existence and the rules of conduct it entails can be deduced from it."
