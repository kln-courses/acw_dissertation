<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SOUTHERN EXTENT OF TOTEM POLE CARVING The practice of totem pole carving is a unique and a justly famed achievement of the Indians of coastal British Columbia and southern Alaska. Students of art, professional anthropologists, and thousands of others with a nontechnical interest in human behavior have found much to admire in the grotesque figures and the stylistic conventions incorporated in this art. Unfortunately, however, its oddity has too often im- pressed the untrained white observer, and in consequence there is much nonsense abroad respecting the purpose and the sig- nificance of totem poles for the native. Still more unfortunate is the fact that, for one reason or another, either deliberately or unwittingly, the Indian has himself contributed to the white man's misunderstanding of the custom and its aboriginal geo- graphical extent. Today it is not uncommon to meet with re- ports of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures carved or painted on house fronts, posts, and beams, as well as on de- tached exterior poles, in areas where they were aboriginally unknown, and to find Indians who are more or less willing to make them and interpret them in a manner that appeals to the white man. This, in fact, is the situation over most of south- ern British Columbia. The center of this artistic development lay to the north, in the vicinity of the Queen Charlotte Islands and the main- land opposite, among the Haida and the Tsimshian Indians. The carvings on their poles, like the paintings on their house fronts, the carvings on their wooden containers, utensils, and house posts, were the social prerogatives of members of dis- tinguished families. These emblems commemorated specific events in the traditional history of the ancestral lineage, and were in effect crests or heraldic devices with a minimum of abstract or symbolic reference.1 To the south, the Kwakiutl 1For a discussion of this, see Marius Barbeau, Totem Poles of the Gitksan, Upper Skeena River, British Columbia (National Museum of Canada, Bulletin no. 61, Anthropological Series no. 12, Ottawa, 1929), 7-12. 379</page><page sequence="2">380 PACIFIC NORTHWEST QUARTERLY [ October along the northeastern margin of Vancouver Island shared in this tradition, but the custom scarcely passed beyond the lin- guistic barrier that separated them from the Comox at Salmon River and the Homalco on Bute Inlet. These latter tribes spoke dialects of the Salishan language, as did all the rest of the peo- ple on both sides of the Georgia Strait, and even those beyond, around most of Puget Sound. The Comox, and also the Pentlatch, who lived near what is today Courtenay, had a few crude totem poles and other heraldic carvings and paintings.2 In 1936 well-informed In- dians, describing the situation as of approximately 1850, could give very little specific data on totem poles. The only precise recollection was that one Comox family had the right to raise a pole with a carved grizzly bear at the bottom and the figure of a man, a "watchman," at the top pointing seaward with one hand and shading his eyes with the other. At the same time it was well remembered that interior house posts and the pro- jecting ends of ridgepoles and horizontal beams were carved into hereditary crest figures. Specifically, the latter took the forms of sea lion and raven heads, the former of various an- thropomorphic figures. One Comox headman owned a central supporting post showing a boastful ancestor standing with his arms akimbo. The same individual had another house post in- tended to represent a slave his grandfather had captured from a despised neighboring village. Another family enjoyed the privilege of erecting a corner or center post in the form of a large-bellied being with deep-set eyes and a round protruding mouth, a monstrous conception borrowed from the Kwakiutl.8 Whales, painted but not carved, occurred on the front gables of the houses of one large and prominent Comox family. Doors were usually rectangular, but some privileged lineages had the right to make more elaborate entrances with paintings around and above them to represent human beings, animals, or other crest forms ; one was made round to form a moon ; another was 2 The information upon which this summary is based was obtained in the course of an ethnographic study of this area made in 1935 and 1936. 8 Compare Franz Boas, "The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians," Report of the U.

These influences did not extend south of Deep Bay. Where they appear they are recent, i.e., subsequent to the establish- ment of the Hudson's Bay post at Victoria in 1843, and in every authentic case their existence is attributed by trustworthy In- dians to some immediate connection with the Comox and others to the north. At Nanaimo, for example, there was one house which was painted with a thunderbird and a mythical serpent on the front, but this belonged to a man whose father came from Deep Bay. His mother was a Nanaimo woman, and when his father died he moved to Nanaimo and built the house. The father of another individual, still living in 1936, painted the posts in his house and had one carved to represent a man hold- ing a rattle and standing on a slave's head; but this was be- cause he was related by marriage to a family at Comox. Totem poles and even these few house decorations were not native to Nanaimo; and this despite the fact that a local Indian carved the pole which now stands in the public square of that city. An- other of his carvings is to be found in the yard of his brother- in-law at an old village location near Point Roberts. The same conclusions hold for villages farther south at Cowichan Bay and on the Saanich Peninsula. At the village of the West Sanetch, near Brentwood, one house contained a central supporting post carved into a series of bulges and con- strictions. That was all. More recently, some of the Sanetch people as well as the Cowichans undertook the carving of an- thropomorphic house posts with indifferent success. At the village of Quamichan, near Duncan, five of these stand today along the outside of a dilapidated building. They were made as interior roof supports of a house now gone. Curtis4 has a picture of these, and they need not be described here except to say that they reveal the characteristic style of all such carvings of a recent date from this restricted area. Conservative In- dians today repudiate them and regard their display as preten- * Edward S. Curtis, The Northern American Indian.

Thus, from the detailed accounts of living Indians it aj* pears certain that there was a decided cultural difference be-1 tween the native groups on the northern and the southern parts of Vancouver Island. There is in addition a fragment or two of documentary evidence for this cleavage. Certainly part of it dates as far back as the time of Vancouver if we accept the conclusion that the people on Cape Mudge in 1792 were Comox,0 for Menzies saw dwellings there "with large boards some of which were ornamented with rude paintings particularly those on the fronts of the houses/'6 By contrast, a contemporaneous account of some Nanaimo customs by an officer on board the Sutil or the Mexicana makes no mention of poles or decorated houses.7 This, of course, is purely negative evidence, but taking it in conjunction with the explicit state- ments by native informants we are led to the conclusion that the cultural breach between the Pentlatch and the Nanaimo existed aboriginally and was not bridged until quite recently, say the end of the nineteenth century, and then only sporadi- cally. Much the same situation existed on the eastern side of the Georgia Strait from Bute Inlet to Puget Sound. The Homalco of Bute Inlet and the Klahuse of Toba Inlet were not, by their own testimony, "salt water people," and in aboriginal times did not venture far beyond the mouths of their respective inlets. They were terrorized by the Kwakiutl, who regarded them as an inferior species and fair game. There was very little social contact between the groups and in consequence little opportu- nity for the transfer of the crest system. In fact, the Kwakiutl looked upon all of the Salish-speaking people except the Comox with contempt, and disdained to marry with them before the 5 Compare Archibald Menzies, Mensies' Journal of Vancouver's Voyage, April to October, 1792, ed. by C.

Concurrent with the development of white trade there was an easement of Kwakiutl pressure, and the Homalco, to- gether with the Klahuse, joined up with the Slaiamon (now on the reserve near Powell River) for a common winter rendez- vous at Grace Harbour on Malaspina Inlet. However, by the time white law and order was established it was too late for native patterns to be transmitted with much vitality or mean- ing. The old sanctions and value systems were already fading and the outward forms were open to misinterpretation. The Kwakiutl system of privileges and its concrete expressions were flagrantly misunderstood by the Homalco, the Klahuse, and others to the south of them. Among these Indians anyone who could afford it could have a carving or a painting made, usually by an inferior (and doubtless contemptuous) Kwakiutl artist. In consequence there was a rather brief proliferation and deca- dence of a few bleak and unesthetic crest patterns among some of the more aggressive and aspiring Homalco, Klahuse, and Slaiamon families. Of the four big houseowners at Salmon Bay (Klahuse) around the year 1800, one used no decoration at all. He was a "quiet tyhee man" ; but on the beach outside his house stood a human figure with its hands on its hips. Another important lineage head had the four corner posts of his house carved in the likeness of women, his front ridgepole support like a man pointing to the seats in welcome, and his ridgepole and project- ing beam-ends in the forms of sea lion and seal heads. This was the most important man among the Klahuse. He had mar- ried a Kwakiutl woman, and very likely some of his crests came with her. The third man had five posts in his house carved in the same way as the second, and in addition a cen- tral post representing a "greedy man." This figure was sym- bolic of plenty, and at feasts it was bathed in oil, so that it oozed and drooled the precious liquid. The same individual also painted a whale on the front of his house. From all re- ports he was a self-made man (his father had nothing) and he bought these figures, simply paying a mercenary Kwakiutl</page><page sequence="7">1942 ] BARNETT : TOTEM POLE CARVING 385 to do them for him. The fourth important Klahuse man had no decorations on his house; he was a "quiet chief" like the first. - Totem poles in commemoration of the dead were raised at the cemetery or in front of the houses in this northeastern region, but they were few and stereotyped. In 1936 the oldest informant among the Klahuse remembered these poles as "about forty feet" high with a human figure sitting at the top, one standing at the base, and a plain slender shaft con- necting the two.8 He had seen two of these at Salmon Bay and four at Grace Harbour. He insisted, however, that they and the rest of the crests were late acquisitions, taken over by the Klahuse after they began to come out of Toba Inlet and were able, because of the white man's intercession, to meet the Kwakiutl on friendly terms. As this testimony indicates, the Slaiamon, at least after they began to assemble with their northern neighbors at Grace Harbor, were acquainted with the kind of totem pole described. More characteristic were paintings and carvings on Slaiamon houses themselves. All of the six large houses owned by promi- nent lineages had some of these decorative features, but there was little variation among them. Sea lion heads appeared on the projecting ridgepoles of three houses ; painted thunderbirds on the gables of four ; anthropomorphic posts in two ; a painted mask and an eagle on the front of one. One of these house- holders had eagles carved on the ends of the vertical shafts which held the wall planks in place and projected upward beyond the roof. Finally, one man claimed the privilege of erecting in front of his house the familiar figure of a man with his hands on his hips and his mouth open, "calling the people." Among the Sechelt, who formerly congregated and built their permanent dwellings at Pender Harbour, there was even less of a display of privileges of the character under discussion. There were no freestanding posts or poles at all. One house displayed eagles carved on the projecting wall binders as in the Slaiamon instance above; another had a sea lion head at the 8 Blankets were tied on these from top to bottom, and left to disintegrate.</page><page sequence="8">386 PACIFIC NORTHWEST QUARTERLY [ October end of its ridgepole; two others had painted thunderbirds on the gable. Most distinctive was the painted figure of a man straddling the doorway of one house, and carved posts in the shapes of seals, sea lions, and blackfish in another. The Squamish were even more remote from these north- ern influences. Although they live today on a reserve on the edge of North Vancouver, this spot was aboriginally only a summer fishing location, their true home being on the Squamish River at the head of Howe Sound. They, too, were scarcely "salt water people." It is indicative that informants in 1936 were vague about carvings and paintings. It was said that the projecting wall binders were sometimes carved into a man's head (a "watchman") at the top, and that the beam-ends looked like "some kind of an animal," just what was not re- membered. There was uncertainty about the house posts, too, but a recollection of at least one representing a man and a grizzly bear. The Musquiam, with their village on Point Grey, were better situated to benefit from streams of cultural influence from all directions, and it is not unlikely that they were affected by an impulse of crest carving which moved down the interior from the north by way of the Chilcotin, the Lillooet, and the Thompson Indians. Even so, we would not expect them to be greatly stimulated by ideas moving along this route, and our expectations are borne out by the crudity of their conceptions as judged by Kwakiutl standards. Anthropomorphic house posts they did have, and at least one of these commemorated a legendary event involving an ancestor of the houseowner. It signalized the control over grizzly bears possessed by the origi- nal owner and his descendants, and showed a man standing on a bear and shaking a rattle.9 This is certainly more in line with northern ideas on the subject, but other Musquiam repre- sentations were not. House paintings and commemorative grave markers, for example, were contrived at will by an in- dividual in accordance with his estimation of himself or of his 9 The original and the first reproduction of this post no longer exist, but the informant said that the second copy, which was made for his grandfather, is at the University of British Columbia.</page><page sequence="9">1942 ] BARNETT : TOTEM POLE CARVING 387 immediate relatives. In part at least these were ideographic representations symbolizing the talents of the owner. One family, for instance, raised a slender grave pole with a thun- derbird at the top and a cross plank a little lower down. On one arm of this plank was pictured a fish, while on the other was a human figure drawing a bow. These paintings were in- tended to signalize the owner's fishing and hunting abilities. It is quite probable that in the case of the Musquiam we are dealing with a different idea, one which is very likely his- torically old and basic even to the Kwakiutl crest conception. The practice of seeking supernatural help from a guardian spirit was a widespread Indian trait, and in some localities it was customary for the individual to give some symbolic repre- sentation of the power bestowed upon him by his familiar spirit. This custom prevailed in central and western Washing- ton, and may account for the facts reported to us by early travelers on the Columbia River. In this area dance rattles, sticks, and boards were sometimes carved into anthropomor- phic figures representative of guardian spirits, and even more often they were decorated by rude paintings with the same mystic significance to the owner.10 House posts, too, were painted with bands, circles, and "various designs" symbolic of spirit protectors and assistants.11 More remarkable in the present connection, however, are the "images" and other carved and painted figures around doors and house posts mentioned by Lewis and Clark, Broughton, and other explorers of the lower Columbia.12 These, as well as the carvings on canoe prows and sterns which they also describe, may have had the same spirit sanction as the "power boards" ; or they may have been diffused up the Columbia by the Chinook, who were doubtless in either direct or indirect trading contact with the Nootkans on the western coast of Vancouver Island. In the one case we have to 10 Ronald L.

In conclusion, it can be said that our brief survey of the important village groups on the Strait of Georgia reveals a difference between the Comox (and Pentlatch) and the rest of the Salish-speaking people there. In the matter of house ornamentation, totem poles, and other heraldic devices, the Comox affiliate with the Kwakitul. By contrast, the emblems used over the rest of the area lacked both the distinctive variety and the sanction of antiquity which made them definitely family (as opposed to individual) privileges in the north. The Comox had a number of different crests - more than have been mentioned - but among the Salish groups from Vancou- ver to Bute Inlet the recurrence of the sea lion, the thunder- bird, and the eagle is their most striking characteristic. Add to this the custom of carving house posts in the likeness of men, and monotony becomes complete. By far the greater number of Comox (and certainly the Kwakiutl) house posts and decorations were acquired by in- heritance ; that is, for any given individual they already existed and had existed as treasured family possessions for some time ; they had a respectable antiquity and were enriched by numerous enviable associations. Most were obtained by a man from his father or his grandfather, either paternal or maternal. On the other hand, the rest of the Strait of Georgia Salish characteristically bought their paintings and carvings. They either thought one up and had it executed by an artist, or, more often, paid another owner for duplicating his design. Anyone could do this who could afford the asking price and, most im- portant of all, the expense of a potlatch to announce the cir- cumstances surrounding the acquisition. This last require- ment was the sine qua non and the only real deterrent to a rapid and indiscriminate spread of the practice, except that the owner could refuse to give his permission, and would refuse a person whose background did not warrant the expectation</page><page sequence="11">1942 ] BARNETT : TOTEM POLE CARVING 389 that he would carry on the feasting and potlatching tradition to the credit of the emblem which represented him. In the words of the Indian he "must not spoil it." So unrestrictive were the requirements that when informants were asked the general question, "Who had the sea lion on his house?" they invariably answered, "Anybody who wanted it." True, once acquired the privileges remained in the house and so po- tentially in the possession of all lineal descendants ; but it seems to have been only two or three generations ago that most men were in the act of acquiring them, or even more significantly, that the way was open for their doing so. This is not the nature of crests properly understood, even admitting that they must have a beginning sometime. The Salish misconceptions regarding their use suggests only a vague and recent acquaintance with them. So does the lack of a critical and distinctive variation in their forms. All things considered, it seems that the Salish attitude was decidedly parvenu. Anthropomorphic posts and carved poles were re- garded simply as the prerogatives of rich and influential men as a class, not of distinct and aristocratic family lines. The figures had no well-grounded traditional value, and had signifi- cance for the individual owner only as they testified to his wealth and ability to pay. It is for this reason that we must interpret them not as crests, but as house decorations with a social significance, on a par, let us say, with gold door knobs or hand-painted china. H. G.
