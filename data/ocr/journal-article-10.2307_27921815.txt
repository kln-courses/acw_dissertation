<plain_text><page sequence="1">A BEAUTIFUL, CRUEL COUNTRY: ANOTHER VOYAGE INTO CHICANO LITERARY SPACE Bruce-Novoa Trinity University Fifteen years ago, in my first theoretical state ment on Chicano writing, I characterized the literature as a response to the perceived threat of the disappearance of the culture (Bruce-Novoa, 1975). Each major piece at that time focused this conflict on something?a person, a family line, an object, a place, et cet.?that seems about to slip into oblivion. Since the threatened thing was also endowed with the quality of an axis mundi object, that is it served as the organizational center from which meaning is derived by the members of the social unit dependent upon it, its loss would disorient the group, producing a state of chaos. To prevent this, the work had to rescue the threatened object by encoding it into the text as an image, a representational form of the real object, that could be preserved from disappear ance through the media of print. The work, in turn, then substituted for the actual object, be coming the axis mundi itself, and in turn making the reading into a type of ritual of recall that could fulfill the orienting function of the disap peared object replaced now by literature. When the significance of the axis mundi object is summarized, it is often revealed as communal history. What is under the threat of disappear ance is the group's self knowledge necessary for continued existence. The future depends on the ability to survive in the present by applying the traditional wisdom from the past. The death or disappearance of the object in which that knowl edge is deposited deprives the community of its storehouse of survival techniques as well as its sense of place in time and space. The question arises, however, that none of this would be necessary if the culture were secure and healthy. The first response is that security is difficult for a minority subculture undergoing the pressure of assimilation into the dominant cul ture. The process demands change, often requir ing the loss or de-emphasis of identifying characteristics, such as language and ethnic cus toms. In addition, it also has traditionally implied the acceptance of the dominant version of his tory, one that emphasizes almost exclusively the Anglo-Saxon origins of the United States. This history is the written text of the country, often opposed to the familial or communal account of history preserved in the minority group's oral tradition. The assimilation process has tradition ally involved the distancing of the youth from their elders' oral tradition as they are indoctri nated into the written history of the U.S.A. taught by the schools. The inability of the minor ity group to preserve the oral tradition is the sign that it is not as healthy as it should be. The disappearing oral tradition has been a cen tral concern of much Chicano literature since the earliest contemporary writing. I have addressed this topic in the past, demonstrating that writ ing/reading is meant to replace the oral tradition ritual at a time when that ritual seems to have lost its appeal for the young (Bruce-Novoa, 1981). In this case the real threat to cultural survival is the breakdown of communication between the old and young which relegates communal knowledge to silence. By writing what ideally should be passed on by word of mouth, it is hoped that those who no longer listen will, if not immedi ately at least eventually, seek the information through reading. The texts becomes a sus pended or deferred performance of the oral tradi tional ritual. As Chicano literature has become established, this concern for documenting an 129</page><page sequence="2">endangered oral tradition has become less ex plicit because writers, working now within an established opus of Chicano writing, seem less preoccupied with the threat of silence and the loss of oral tradition. However, in some signifi cant cases, the pattern of writing as a rescue from oblivion reappears to remind us of the enduring deep pattern of Chicano literature?which, after all, is probably one of the basic patterns of all art. Eva Antonia Wilbur-Cruces A Beautiful, Cruel Country is just such an event. Wilbur-Cruce was born in 1904 on her father's ranch in Arizona fifteen miles north of the Mexican-U. S. border. Eighty-three years later she published a three hundred-page volume of autobiographical writings about her childhood up to approximately age six, with a few leaps forward into more recent events. The book could easily read as a novel about a child, and since education and initiation figure notably, it quali fies as a Bildungsroman, as I have explained in another essay (Bruce-Novoa, "Eva Antonia"). Here I will explore how it embodies the pattern of Chicano literature. The Prologue to BCC is one of the clearest expressions in Chicano literature of the motif of the impending disappearance of the past. From the beginning Wilbur-Cruce centers communal life in the family dwelling: "Our ranchito basks in the sun, rather idle now, compared to the life of turmoil it lived at the turn of the century" (vii). By contrasting a present of "idleness" to a past of "liveliness," the author immediately establishes the sense of radical difference between now and then, which by extension implies the loss of the former vitality. By juxtaposing two time periods within the sentence, the author represents well not only her situation in the present, but the difference in the character of the two periods. The exterior structure that housed life remains, but life itself is located in the second half of the sentence, that is, in the past. Note that the verb attributed to the house in the present is an in transitive, inactive one which locates life's source outside of itself in the sun. The sole adjective, "idle," reinforces this passivity and stasis. In the past, however, the house was fully active in its own right?not only did it live life, but life is intensified contextually by infusing it with move ment. The redundancy of life-lived is reinforced through "turmoil," "turn" and "century," the latter serving to hyberbolize "turn" into a significant historical moment. The entire phrase is given the feeling of turning upon itself, a whirling about, not only through the "turning" of time, but also the phonetic redundance of the allitera tions in "lived" + "life" and "turmoil" + "turn." "Turmoil" is, however, the only value-charged word she utilizes in this context, reinforcing per fectly the sense an activity turning upon itself, its primary definition being "an utterly confused, extremely agitated, or tumultuous state or condi tion." In addition, by emphasizing confusion and even distress, "turmoil" underscores the sense that this moment in the past was a true turning point, one in which something was to be de cided, thus setting life in the dwelling on a course towards the seemingly passive existence it now leads in the first part of the sentence. It is this active life of significant events that is hidden by the appearance of idle basking which typifies the present. The author goes on to emphasize her present solitude. Her parents and half of her siblings having died; she finds solace in nature and mem ories. Yet, as she states, although she had con templated the need of "holding and pondering in some more objective way" some of the thoughts evoked by her familiar surrounding, she "was never in a hurry to leave that enchanted, elo quent solitude" (viii). In the Prologue Wilbur Cruce presents herself as the archetypal wise elder, guardian of tribal oral tradition, reluctant to seek dialogue. As many others in Chicano litera ture, she has retreated to the edge of the present to reside among silent memories and passively await the coming of an interested heir to ask questions and provoke the oral ritual. In Wilbur-Cruces case, the awaited catalyst comes in the guise of the two young daughters of a close friend who asks the author to take her girls on an outing to the ranch. As in other works dealing with this subject, the oral ritual is difficult to revive, in this instance because the young are not ready to participate. They lack motivation. Wilbur-Cruce vainly tries to engage the girls in the ritual: 130</page><page sequence="3">I took them down to the creek, pointing out everything I thought of interest and telling them stories of ranch life. Back at the house we sat outside and I showed them old pictures that I thought would be interesting. I remember that one was of my brother William, thirteen years old, roping a big horn. They were not at all impressed. A young boy astride a horse, with a bighorn at the end of his rope-so what? I told them of the Papago Indian tribe. They were not interested, (viii-ix) They see the ranch in terms of the sleepy passivity of its present state, which the author herself evoked in her opening sentence, while she unsuccessfully tries to shift their attention to the dynamic memory of the second half of that same sentence. While they can see only the "dead place" where nothing seems to happen of the present, the author attempts to use oral per suasion and photographs to resuscitate the past. Yet the girls erroneously interpret everything she says. The failed interchange is worth our atten tion. "Doesn't seem," said Christine, with barely concealed boredom, "that you'd have much work to do in a dead place like this." "Back in the old days we did, though, Christine," I said. "Our little spread went clear to the Mexican border, fifteen miles south of here." I told her about bringing the horses up from the border ranch, and how the leaders would arrive here around ten in the morning, but those bringing up the rear would get here by sundown. "Well, yes," said Nadine, "I suppose, one horse walking behind the other, it'd take them forever to get here." "In the days of the open range, our horses ranged from New Mexico to the Mexican border," I told her grandly. "You should have tied them, don't you think?" she asked. "I guess we should have thought of that, Nadine." These girls were impossiblei (ix) The conflict is more fundamental than a sim ple matter of lack of interest. Although they speak the same language, the interlocutors do not share a common semantic system to enable them to truly communicate. A lack of interest, or motivation for interest, compounds the problem. Wilbur-Cruce has created another version of the situation summarized by Rudolfo Corky Gonzales twenty years ago in his / Am Joaqutn when he bemoaned the younger generation's ig norance of who the old generation was. At the same time, she emphasizes that unless the youth are motivated on their own to seek the knowl edge of the past, the transmission of history is futile. This alludes to the structural element I have often discussed in Chicano literature that the work itself must evoke the threat of disap pearance often ignored by the very community most affected by the consequences of the event. Wilbur-Cruce here depicts two youths appar ently unaffected by the lack of knowledge; they have no sense of needing what the old woman offers them because they feel no pressing use for it. Desire must be created in them before they will seek the knowledge. And as Chicano litera ture has chosen to emphasize, that desire is stim ulated by the perception of impending danger in the real world, a threat to existence in some form. Nature itself provides the stimulus in a series of three interventions, each progressively more powerful and producing an escalating reaction of inquiry by the girls. The triple repetition of ques tioning leading to a final sweeping away of all resistance to communication between elder and neophyte is itself the traditional structure of the oral tradition ritual, another sign that we are in the presence of more than a simple prologue, but rather a true introduction to a ritual experience. The first intervention barely produces an open ing. The girls call the author to see a hum mingbird. Once again the author herself falls into the dichotomy of the unexciting present versus a glorious past: "drab brown hummingbird" versus the "beautiful multi-colored hummingbirds that used to come" (ix). Yet, the girls cut off the author's attempt to introduce her memories by stating they have seen the birds in books. Com munication remains hindered because the two parties still interpret from differing semantic sources each brings to the present from their past training. The process has begun, however, for at least interest has been slightly aroused. The second intervention adds the important 131</page><page sequence="4">ingredient of menace: a "loud call of 'lospapagoi [sic]" (ix) frightens the girls. Fearing it is a man outside, they seek the author's protection. They have seen nothing, only heard the call and de coded it as the presence of a human being, spe cifically a strange man, which is further interpreted as threatening. Symbolically, this is the opening for traditional knowledge to display itself, desire having been aroused by a perceived threat to personal existence. The response comes in the form of a corrective reinterpretation of the sign according to its proper context: "los papagos" is the call of quail coming to water at the ranch's fountain. That is, the author reveals the code within which true semantic value of the call can be understood by the girls. At the des perate request of the young novitiates, the oral traditional ritual has finally begun. Their interest now stirred, the girls retrace the areas and items which the author had tried to show them before. During this process a new stimulus from nature appears: horses have en tered the corral. Again the incident is marked with fear resulting from a misreading. Upon see ing horses "stretched out full-length, motionless" (x), the girls assume that the animals are sick or dead. The author must instruct them once more, initiating them into the knowledge of cattle which she, as it turns out, had to learn as a girl from her elders. This third intervention opens the flood gates: "This brought on questions of all kinds and they now wanted to see all the pictures of horses in action that they hadn't cared to look at in the morning" (x). That the audience has been brought to the point of desiring the ancient wisdom is obvious, but more is at play here. Nature has intervened not only to convince the young of their need, but to use these girls to awaken in the author a desire to function as the purveyor of knowledge she has kept silenced. She herself must be made aware that there is a personal need, and that is exactly what happens. "It occurred to me then that my own nieces and nephews didn't appreciate the animals any more than these girls did, and I could never get them to sit still long enough to tell them about the country life. I decided, then and there, to write them a letter" (x). The oral tradition informant analyzes the situation, cor rectly realizes that there has been a fundamental change in the audience?its context of moder nity disallows long, patient attendance on the oral recounting of history?and makes the mo mentous decision to write what she knows de spite the absence of the familial audience. The introduction incident has taught the elder a les son as well: old forms of life must give way to new if the essence of the past is to survive. The oral method is replaced by writing. The author, however, envisions writing in a very traditional sense. She writes under the as sumption that the written word substitutes for the spoken word. Moreover, as Wilbur-Cruce states in a later reference to another form of inscribing highly privileged in the text?cattle branding?she believes that certain written signi fiers have the power to evoke both the presence of the signified as well the emitter of the word. "A brand was a messenger, a reminder in passing. It was the owner himself (13). Significantly, she begins writing a letter to her family, a personal communication with strong connotations of de ferred orality. Her purpose is to make the past present in a direct, personal, and material man ner. This intent is supported during the opening of the ritual when the lack of intergenerational communication, and even the lack of interest, are attributed to the negative influence of book learning. When the author inquires as to the reason for the girls' awakened interest in what earlier had only bored them, the response is significant: "We didn't know it was like this We've seen quail and horses and other animals in books, but live animals are different, aren't they? We're so lucky to see those quail and hear them!" (x). Communication is achieved through seeing and hearing the object, not by reading about it nor by seeing photographs in instructional me dia. Her writing must be the equivalent of talking and the actual presence of the evoked subjects. This seems a naive view of language and writ ing. Few critics continue to affirm the word's power to evoke real presence. Wilbur-Cruce, however, is not a post-modern writer, but a repre sentative of a traditional oral culture which she intends to preserve. Although she learns very early to read and write, she does so in part through the branding system, a type of writing that de facto made the sign and the object it was marked on into the legal extension of the emitter. 132</page><page sequence="5">That this type of writing differs from expository writing is underscored in the text when a neo phyte writes "acero" instead of making the ideo gram for A + Cero [zero]-. This ideographic writing is only for the initiated, those willing to invest time and attention in learning the code. For those who are, reading can become a radi cally different experience of presence. Yet one should not expect to have the code handed out without earning the right to it. The author learns a valuable lesson: one cannot make the young understand by lecturing them on what one thinks is important. Every time she tries it, the girls reject the attempt. However, when things are introduced to them directly, through no apparent mediator nor with any blatant mes sage, as nature seems to do in the Prologue, then the girls themselves desire more information and willingly begin to learn another form of "reading" natures signs. For the bearer of the message, this translates into the need to disguise information as something other than direct exposition. Hence, the author wisely chooses description, characterization, and narrative turning her auto biography into a novel, and more specifically a children's novel "written primarily to entertain" (xiii). She attempts to present the world not explain it. When we combine the possibility of a different type of reading which the reader must discover with the need to disguise the message in the form of narrative, we understand why the text seems to be the simple tale of a child's initiation into the adult world. Eva, as a little girl, must master certain lessons demanded of her if she is to survive. This story occupies our attention, while through it much information is laid before us. One can finish the book and still believe that it is simply a child's story, but if one is more open and inquisitive, then perhaps a special revelation will occur. The child's story is an allegory for exactly that process, in that she also must learn to read and understand her confusing surround ings, with its multiple codes of significance. She must learn to look beyond the surface of things, past first impressions, to discover the real nature of the world, often hidden in the small, unobtru sive details, like the broken rope around a bulls neck, which means nothing to the small child, but that relates to her mother a story of a failed attempt by someone to capture the animal, and by extension perhaps the presence of a threat to the ranch's livestock and well being. She also learns from her mother the ideal teacher/pupil relationship for true instruction. "Mother took up my country education seriously. She didn't point things out to me anymore; instead she made me point things out to her, and explain them in detail" (73). When she masters the dif ferent processes to which she is exposed, epiph anies of beauty and significance start to reveal themselves to her. Likewise, at some point seri ous readers should begin pointing things out and explaining them without the author's aid. Yet according to the semantic system that the author has introduced for that context. Moreover, by extension, it is hoped that readers will eventually apprehend revelations of profound significance in the apparently superficial realities placed be fore them. Much of what we garner from the text is about the mestizo society in Arizona at the turn of the century going through a period of crisis. It is an elegy to the passing of the open range, to its people, animals, and landscape. In addition, it contains a lesson about how some of the atti tudes underlying the cattle system on which that society depended also spelled its eventual de mise. The herding and corralling of the cattle prefigures restriction of the Indian to the reserva tion, narrated in the last chapters, which then, in its own right, prefigures the fencing of the range and the mechanization of ranching and farming. A way of life was ending, leaving what is now the past almost impossible to decipher, its semantic system hidden or silenced. Wilbur-Cruce at tempts, not to translate the signs, but to teach us a code that could allow us entry into a different way of reading the remaining signs of a distant time. She tries to lead us to another kind of reading, one in which presence is still possible, a sacred kind of reading in which God is the ulti mate source of meaning and the reason why nature itself knows how to represent through simulacrum. This is the oral tradition justified as a written system of presence. If we were to search for an ethnic tradition to support this belief in the presence in the signifier of an absent signified, we could refer to the Mexi can and Native American folk belief of the Na 133</page><page sequence="6">gual. Specifically, it refers to persons with magical power who can assume animal form, while in a more generalized way, it is the belief that people have an animal equivalent, like a familiar, which share the human soul. The ani mal is the extension of the human and vice versa. Those acquainted with Rudolfo Anaya's Bless Me, Ultima will recall that the character Ultima, her self a wise woman and guardian of the oral tradi tion, had a familiar in the form of an owl, and that it is through the shooting of the owl that Ultima is killed. There is a brief reference to this belief in BCC when the author recalls an incident with Toribio, a sheep shearer from Mexico. When asked why he had to return to his country if he liked it in Arizona, Toribio replied, "Don't you hear that bird calling me?" There follows the author's reaction. Then I noticed the bird singing on a branch of the hackberry tree and singing loudly, 'Toribio, Toreebiooo.' After Don Toribio left the house I asked Mother why she hadn't told me about this wonderful bird. T didn't think it was necessary,' said Mother shortly. I was not happy with her answer, and I was even unhappier when Don Toribio went back to Mexico and the bird disappeared. Here was a fascinating, marvelous thing I wanted to know about. Why did this bird who said a man's name go away when the man went? I asked and asked, but no one would tell me anything" (258). The bird is Tbribio's Nagual calling him back to his home. The author was not given an expla nation by the mother because, as we saw above, true teaching requires that the student observe and explain to the teacher. She must learn the lesson by herself. The author proves that she eventually learned the lesson of the Nagual by applying it in her own book, while also proving that she learned the lesson of serious teaching by utilizing the Nagual without explaining its function. That is, in the Prologue, Wilbur-Cruce, as author, uses Naguals to achieve what she herself cannot as a character. The three animal interventions that awaken the interest of the young girls are actually Naguals of significant characters in the book, characters which in turn represent different life styles in Arizona at the turn of the century. The hum mingbird refers to the Mexican grandfather who cultivated, in the middle of what otherwise was a desert, a rich garden. Wilbur-Cruce describes it as resembling a castle. Grandfather's island was unique. It rose several feet above the creek and the sides were too steep for larger animals to climb. In fact, there was only one entrance, by way of a narrow strip of land, that was guarded by a fence and gate that could be securely locked. A pomegranate fence along the edge of the north bank, and quince trees lined the edge of the south bank. Three peach trees and two apricot trees were staggered down the center of the island. Into this obviously Utopian realm, reminiscent of an allegorical image from a medieval tapestry, the author places her grandfather, giving him an aura of Saint Francis of Assisi, who is often de picted with animals all around him. To me it was a magical place. In the spring it was filled with the tremulous green of newly growing things and the scent of flowering shrubs and trees. Swarms of beautiful hummingbirds visited the island. There would be a whirring of wings, and then suddenly the tiny birds, working on the peach blossoms. They hovered over our heads suspended in the air or going back and forth. They were never afraid of us. When we sat to eat our lunch under the willow tree where Grandfather had built an hornilla (mud stove) and had set up a long crude table, the hummingbirds would join us, sitting at the edge of a plate with sugar water that Grandfather prepared for them. When the plate was dry, they would sit on Grandfather's shoulder and look into his face. I remember a white hummingbird with a turquoise-blue collar; it would come streaking in and suddenly stop, only inches away from Grandfather's face, its wings twirling so fast they reminded me of a dancing top. We called it the white angel of the island. (108) 134</page><page sequence="7">We need only remember that the first charac teristics mentioned when the grandfather was originally introduced were his "Blue eyes and a massive white bear" (11) to establish that the hummingbird was the grandfathers Nagual. The link to St. Francis of Assisi is supported in that the grandfather was a deeply religious man who considered all creatures his brethren and practiced something like a communal way of life in which he shared everything he had with the poor and sick. The tie to St. Francis is also important because the saint's concept of the world as a net of correspondences to the divine, in which animals, things, and even afflictions were called brothers and sisters, reinforces the folk belief in the Nagual, and ultimately the mes sage of a totally interdependent ecological sys tem ultimately dependent on God that the author conveys through her text. When the ani mals come to the ranch in the Prologue, they are actually brethren in God, signs in a mystic text in search of a worldly rereading. The remaining two animals are much easier to link to their human referent. The quail openly name the Indians, "Los Papagos." In the text the author will make numerous comparisons of Indi ans to birds, as well as to other animals, espe cially cattle. They too represented a life of brotherhood with nature, but unlike the grandfa ther's system, that retains an anthropomorphic center and is, thus, actually heirarchical order with humans at the apex, the Indians seem to degrade nature to the animal level. It is important to note, as I have explained at length elsewhere, that the Indians, because they roamed free and continually encroached on the white and mestizo land in search of water and food, were considered a threat to the well-being of civilized society. Indians are depicted as being in need of control, just as cattle was in need of herding to keep it from running amuck. Ultimately it is this need that forces them out of their homes and into a reservation, a type of human corral. Once off the land, their spirit can return only in their least offensive Nagual form, the quail. The horses represent the father, and by exten sion the cattle system itself, a way of life that continually struggled to impose a strict order on the open range. It is the father who insists that the author learn to manipulate this sytem by mastering horsemanship and the essential func tions of cattle ranching. This sytem, however, is depicted in constant conflict with nature and the Indians. It is the logical extension of the con cepts and mandates of cattle herding which eventually lead to the expulsion of the Indians, the fencing of the open range, and the demise of the way of life in which the author grew up. Thus, the Prologue introduces these elements in their representational, Nagual form. These people, long dead, appear as animals to call the author back to her home in the past, just as the Toribio bird called Toribio back to Mexico. At the same time, they introduce a different system of reading in which words supposedly are truly the object or person named, at least in spirit. They ask the reader to consider an animated, even mystical alternative to soulless reading exemplified in the textbooks the girls have al ready read. They request a "hearing" more than a reading, a revival of the oral tradition in the form of a written text, perhaps something like an ideo graphic communication infused with a faith in the ultimate brotherhood of all things based on the interdependence of all signs. This, of course, would be to indulge in the sacred ritual of world centering I have so often described as the func tion of Chicano literary space. Wilbur-Cruce s A Beautiful, Cruel Country draws from and expands that space in one of its most skillful embodi ments. WORKS CITED Anaya, Rudolfo, Bless Me, Ultima. Berkeley: Quinto Sol, 1972.
