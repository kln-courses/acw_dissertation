A RCHAEOLOGY CAPTURES PUBLIC jLJLinterest with tales of ancient tombs and lost civilizations. Recent archaeo- logical discoveries are featured on tel- evision (e.g., Time Team and The Naked Archaeologist) and in glossy magazines like National Geographic and Archaeology. Most Canadians believe that important archaeological finds are made only in exotic, faraway places of the world. Few realize that exciting archaeological dis- coveries are made in our own backyards. Roland Tremblay's The St. Lawrence Iro- quoians: Corn People demonstrates that archaeology in Canada is exciting by offering fascinating stories of ancient lives and unsolved mysteries. The book was written to accom- pany an exhibit on St. Lawrence Iro- quoian archaeology and history at the Pointe-a-Callière, Montréal Museum of Archaeology and History, in Montréal from November 2006 to May 2007. The exhibit featured 130 artifacts, accompa- nied by maps and text panels with con- tributions from 17 archaeologists and historians, to tell the story of the St. Law- rence Iroquoians. A press release issued by the museum (www.pacmuseum.qc.ca) described the exhibit and book as a set of "firsts" for North American archaeology. Prefatory remarks by Francine Lelièvre, Executive Director of the museum, char- acterize the volume as an "abundantly illustrated book, written in intentionally accessible language for a wide audience." In my opinion, the book should appeal to archaeologists as well being attractive to a broader general audience. The book has a short preface, intro- duction, and conclusion; the rest is divided into four major sections. Roland Tremblay, a consulting archaeologist in Québec with research interests and several academic publications on St. Lawrence Iroquoians to his credit, is the author of most of the book (with Claude Chapdelaine acting as co-author for the final section). Within each section, there are several box features of one or two pages, totalling 18 boxes written by 17 specialists. Chapter and figure captions and box features are highlighted in yellow. Maps, illustrations, and photo- graphs are presented in full colour with crystal-clear resolution and their attrac- tive layout is a virtual museum exhibit in book form. A comprehensive set of references for each section and box fea- tures is provided in a bibliography at the back of the book. The foldout covers act as bookmarks. The first section of the book, "The Native Americas," provides an over- view of northeastern North America in AD 1500. With the assistance of detailed maps and box features, the origins of the Iroquoian peoples, their population and distribution in the Northeast, and their physical appearance and health Canadian Journal of Archaeology/Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 31: 287-290 (2007)</page><page sequence="2">288 • WARRICK prior to European contact (presented in a box feature by bioarchaeologist Robert Larocque) are summarized. Archaeo- logical site distribution, divided into village and camp sites, is depicted on a satellite-image map of the St. Lawrence River valley as a foldout. It is the clearest presentation of Iroquoian site locations ever published. Box features (by Michel Plourde, Roland Tremblay, and Roland Viau) examine the latest evidence for the probable locations of Stadacona and Hochelaga, two of the most historically significant pre-European sites in Canada. Iroquoian origins are discussed, from both an archaeological and oral tradi- tion perspective (the latter provided by Roland Viau). Tremblay supports the in situ hypothesis of Iroquoian origins, reinforced by a box feature by Sophie Limoges on the Pointe-du-Buisson site, which demonstrates long-term, con- tinuous use of this fishing station near Montréal, along with increased seden- tism over time and a lengthy period of adaptation to maize agriculture. A new term - "Iroquoiania" - is proposed in this section to describe the area occu- pied by Iroquoian peoples in the North- east. This refers to the geographical enclave shared by all Iroquoian speak- ers in northeastern North America, a veritable island in a sea of Algonkians. Ultimately, the origins of Iroquoiania remain shrouded in mystery. The second section, entitled "Gifts from the Earth and Water," covers Iro- quoian subsistence, including maize- beans-squash agriculture; hunting, fishing, and gathering practices; and the cultivation and use of tobacco. An excellent summary of the origins and genetics of maize agriculture and its introduction to northeastern Iroquoians makes use of the latest botanical and archaeological research. A box feature by Michel Gagné presents a fascinating account of the relatively late adoption of maize-beans-squash agriculture by St. Lawrence Iroquoians in the Saint-Anicet area, south and west of Montréal, which demonstrates that Iroquoian peoples were diverse and did not universally embrace agriculture at the same time. Furthermore, insights are provided in another box feature by Michel Plourde about the dietary reliance by certain St. Lawrence Iroquoians on saltwater fish and sea mammals, with the implication of long-distance travel for subsistence purposes and the sharing of fishing and hunting territories between Iroquoians and Algonkians. Somewhat out of place in this section is the archaeological and historical evidence for the cultivation and smoking of tobacco. St. Lawrence Iroquoian smoking pipes were highly decorated, commonly with zoomorphic and anthropomorphic motifs, explained by Tremblay as a mechanism for dealing with stressful times through spiritual intervention. The next section, "Born a Woman or a Man," presents an overview of the matri-centred household and social organization and sex-specific roles of St. Lawrence Iroquoians. Except for a dis- cussion of pottery making, this is the least archaeological part of the book, instead relying heavily on 16th" and 17th-century accounts. Given that archaeologists consider St. Lawrence Iroquoian pot- tery an ethnic marker and perhaps the key to understanding the ultimate fate of these people, more attention could have been paid to the distinctiveness of St. Lawrence Iroquoian pottery and the debate over how this pottery ended up in Wendat, Mohawk, and Onondaga sites in the 16th century. The book's final (and perhaps most interesting) section, "End of an Era, Canadian Journal of Archaeology 31 (2007)</page><page sequence="3">THE ST. LAWRENCE IROQUOIANS: CORN PEOPLE • 289 Beginning of a Mystery," pulls together the most current interpretations from historians and archaeologists about contact between the French and St. Law- rence Iroquoians and the latter's disap- pearance. The story of French-Iroquoian interaction in the early 16th century is related and enhanced by box features by Sylvie Vincent, Michel Bideaux, and Yves Chrétien. The archaeology at the Cap Rouge site of the Cartier-Roberval fort is the first published account of this work in English and whets the appetite for forthcoming discoveries and publica- tions. The dispersal of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians is covered by Claude Chap- delaine, the foremost authority on the matter. Relying heavily on archaeologi- cal evidence, Chapdelaine believes that the St. Lawrence Iroquoians were victims of inter-group warfare, between St. Law- rence Iroquoian groups and both other Iroquoians (Huron-Wendat, Mohawk) and non-Iroquoians (Mi'kmaq). He attributes the motivation behind all of this warfare to ancient traditions of pris- oner capture for social reasons. I suspect that there were less ideological and more practical causes, such as insults, theft, kidnapping, witchcraft accusations, and trespass on trade routes and hunting territories. Why traditional fighting esca- lated beyond simple acts of vengeance and prisoner exchange to outright wars of dispersal is not known and this is what needs to be explored further by archaeo- logical researchers. This final section also enlightens the reader as to how St. Lawrence Iroquoian archaeology and history is relevant in the contemporary world. Jonathan C. Lainey, a Huron-Wendat historian, reminds the reader that the St. Lawrence Iroquoians did not disappear completely but were simply reincorporated into existing Iroquoian groups, and that oral traditions have survived which tie these descendants to the St. Lawrence River valley. Disputes over land claims and harvesting rights need to acknowl- edge this. Similarly, the final message of the book celebrates the survival of pre-European varieties of maize that are still grown by the Mohawk (prob- ably including St. Lawrence Iroquoian descendants) in ancestral St. Lawrence Iroquoian lands - a physical touchstone of a continuous Iroquoian presence. The message here is that the St. Lawrence Iroquoians never really vanished. Overall, this book is a gem. It is beauti- fully produced with abundant full-colour maps, artifact and site excavation photos, and historical maps and paintings. It should be on the shelf of every school and public library. In addition, univer- sity and museum archaeologists should purchase a copy to use as a template for designing exhibits and popular publica- tions of their own research. In terms of scholarly content, other than some minor differences of opinion on archaeological interpretations that I have noted, I find the book provides a comprehensive por- trait of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians and their history in line with current archaeo- logical research and historical sources. It synthesizes the technical archaeo- logical literature, including publications in French. It also presents historical accounts from Cartier 's voyages to pro- vide insights on St. Lawrence Iroquoian life, which is too often distilled from Jesuit accounts of I7th-century Huron- Wendat and Five Nations Iroquois. The book's few problems are minor: the glos- sary at the back is unnecessary as most of the terms are archaeological and could easily have been defined in the text with first usage, and the yellow highlighting of figure captions and introductory pages of the text sections is distracting.

For this, Roland Tremblay and his fellow contributors and the Pointe-a-Callière, Montréal Museum of Archaeology and History deserve a round of applause. In other parts of the world, for example Britain and South Africa, books on history and archaeology, containing museum-quality maps, illustrations, and photographs and an accompanying text that summarizes current research and complex interpretations of past events, often written by top academic research- ers in lay terms without insulting the reader's intelligence, are purchased and read by both interested members of the public and scholars. In Western societ- ies, governments and the tax-paying public are forcing accountability on academic researchers by demanding public interpretation of archaeological and historical research. Museum exhib- its, television programs, books, internet sites, magazine articles, and films are the main venues for disseminating research results to a wide audience, on which research funding in social sciences and humanities ultimately depends (Pokotylo and Guppy 1999). Perhaps if more Canadian archaeologists were committed to popularizing their work there would be increased attendance at museums and heritage tourism facilities, thus increasing funding for archaeology and heritage, and increased interest and pride in the past (Pokotylo 2002). We need more books like this one. REFERENCES CITED Pokotylo, D. 2002 Public Opinion and Canadian Archaeological Heritage: A National Perspective. Canadian Journal of Archaeology 26:88-129.
