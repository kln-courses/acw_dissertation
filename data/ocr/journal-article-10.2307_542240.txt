<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Anti-anthropomorphisms of the Greek Pentateuch. By CHARLES T. FRITSCH. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1943. Pp. v+81. $2.00. This is an edition in revised form of a Ph.D. dissertation in the department of oriental lan- guages and literatures of Princeton Univer- sity. It contains a useful survey (a) of anti- anthropomorphisms and anti-anthropopathies and (b) of other modifications of Old Testa- ment statements considered derogatory to the deity, as exhibited in the Greek versions of the Pentateuch. The former are in the technical sense found to be "disappointingly few" and inconsistently used; the latter are of sufficient frequency and consistency in the author's opinion to warrant a characterization of the God of the Septuagint as "more spiritualized" than the God of the Hebrew Old Testament. The text of Vaticanus appears to be more anti- anthropomorphic than that of Alexandrinus, and, naturally enough, the translation of Sym- machus than the other non-Septuagint Greek versions. The Jewish and Greek developments of anti-anthropomorphism are distinguished as independent, and to the latter is assigned the origin of the phenomena in the Greek versions. On the last point, however, the evi- dence presented by this study is scarcely suf- ficient to warrant any conclusions. ALLEN WIKGREN University of Chicago</page></plain_text>
