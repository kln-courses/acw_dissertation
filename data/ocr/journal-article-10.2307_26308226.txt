DIACHRONIC CERAMIC EVIDENCE AND ITS SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS IN THE CHIKINCHEL REGION, NORTHEAST YUCATAN, MEXICO Susan Kepecs Department of Anthropology, 5240 Social Science, 1180 Observatory Drive, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wl 53706, USA Abstract In this paper I present new, surface-collected ceramic data from the previously little-known Chikinchel region in northeast Yucatan. My goals are twofold: first, to expand the utility of surface-collected materials by suggesting a technological approach (paste analysis) to classify small or eroded sherds; and second, to place Chikinchel into the larger spatial and temporal framework of the northern Maya lowlands. The ceramic analyses presented here span the Late Formative through Spanish Colonial periods. Diachronic changes in the regional distributions of the different wares that compose the Chikinchel ceramic inventory are demonstrated and discussed in terms of larger processes occurring across the peninsula. The ceramic data described in this paper provide preliminary tem poral and spatial frameworks for a previously little-known area in northeastern Yucatan, where I recently carried out extensive sur veys. The native name for this region at the time of the Spanish invasion was Chikinchel1 (Figure 1). The Chikinchel ceramics re flect the fact that the largest natural salinas (salt deposits) in south ern Mesoamerica occupy its coastal estuary, the Río Lagartos. Here, a pre-Hispanic site called Emal sits amid extensive remains of an cient solar evaporation pans (Andrews 1983; Eaton 1978; Kepecs 1990, 1997; Kepecs et al. 1994). The diachronic, macroregional importance of this resource is suggested by the notable presence of prestige or extra-local ceramics here and at various other sites in the region, especially San Fernando, a large inland center 13 km south of the saltworks (Andrews 1983; Kepecs 1990, 1994, 1997; Kepecs et al. 1994). I discuss the Chikinchel ceramics within the basic chronolog ical framework set forth by Robert E. Smith of the Carnegie In stitution of Washington in 1971. Attempts to refine the gross, synchronic time periods of this sequence are under way (e.g., Bey et al. 1992:12; Boucher 1989; Boucher and Palomo 1995), but Smith's basic scheme remains useful, facilitating common dia logue between investigators working at different sites across the peninsula. Smith's sequence (based on materials excavated at Maya pan with auxiliary information from Chichen Itza and the Puuc sites) is modified for the Chikinchel analysis by incorporating as pects of George Brainerd's (1958) earlier study of Yucatan ceram ics, as well as more recent published work on the pottery of the Yucatan and Campeche coasts (Ball 1978), Coba (Robles Caste llanos 1990), Isla Cerritos (Andrews et a!. 1988; Robles Castella nos 1987; Robles Castellanos and Andrews 1986), and Chichen Itza (Lincoln 1991). This literature adds temporal and spatial di mensions that are particularly relevant to the Chikinchel sequence. In contrast to most ceramic chronologies, the Chikinchel se quence (Table 1) relies entirely on surface-collected materials. As such it is preliminary, but provides a useful heuristic picture of dia chronic change in the study region. The criteria I rely on for clas sification differ somewhat from the type-variety system traditionally used in northern Yucatan. Although I employ the same basic ce ramic groups that are used by my colleagues, standard type-variety identifications generally depend on formal characteristics—vessel form, surface finish, and decoration. Since the Chikinchel collec tions contain mostly small sherds manifesting various degrees of ero sion, certain technological attributes—changes in paste and temper— often are the the only remaining diagnostic elements. Smith (1971) and Brainerd (1958) gave some consideration to paste and temper in their type descriptions, but their treatments were neither inclusive nor systematic. As a result, northern plains ceramicists often describe ceramic pastes (excellent treatments are found in Andrews V [1989] and Robles Castellanos [1990]), but rarely rely on them as primary identifying characteristics (see also Robles Castellanos 1990:27). I focus primarily on visual criteria for paste identification in this paper, and refer the reader to Rice (1987), Rye (1981), and Shepard (1974) for related discussions of firing technology and the physical properties of different tempers. I also refer the reader to Feinman et al. (1989, 1992) for similar studies on Oaxacan ceramics, and to Ball (1978), Robles Caste ' There were many small political units in sixteenth-century Yucatan. These usually bore the names of their governors or head lineages. In sev eral cases, geographic territories containing several independent cacicaz gos also bore names; Chikinchel was one of these (others were Ecab and Chakan). Political organization in these territories fluctuated; at times some of the independent units contained therein probably allied for defense (Oko shi 1994; Quezada 1993; Marcus 1993; Roys 1957). 121</page><page sequence="2">Table 1.

The observations employed in the following descriptions were made on the entire Chikinchel sample with the aid of a hand lens. To provide positive mineralogical identifications of the tempering agents in these ceramics, 5 to 10 thin sections were made from sherds representing each of the wares discussed in this study (with the exception of Late Formative Sierra, which is too soft to cut; see later). Petrographic analysis also confirms impressions of tem per grain size, which can be temporally diagnostic. Descriptions of grain size are based on the standard geological Wentworth scale. Categories include silt (&lt; .062 mm); fine (.062-25 mm); medium (.26-50 mm); coarse (.51-1 mm); very coarse (1-2 mm); and gravel (&gt; 2 mm).

Chikinchel and other places cited in the text (Chikinchel bound aries are from Andrews [1984] and Roys [1957]). and remaining traces of slip often were noted on Chikinchel sherds. The better-identified materials helped support classifications of more eroded sherds from the same archaeological contexts. Fi nally, sherds and thin sections from the Chikinchel collections were compared to similar materials from the stratigraphic type-variety collections at the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia's Centro Regional de Yucatán (CRY-INAH) (Kepecs et al. 1995). Most of the temporally diagnostic ceramics of the northern plains were present in Chikinchel. Many of the unidentifiable sherds in my collections (about 10% overall) probably represent less diagnostic, unslipped utilitarian wares. THE CHIKINCHEL SURVEYS The Chikinchel surveys yielded a substantial amount of ceramic data. Reconnaissance was carried out on both regional and whole site scales. The regional sample consists of 72 sites (Figure 2) that were located through informant-aided road and trail survey.2 To mark geographic placement, the UTM coordinates of each site were registered on Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geográfica e Infor mación (INEGI) topographic sheets at a scale of 1:100,000. The main architectural core of each site was sketch mapped on graph paper, and individual structures in these groups were surface col lected. These surveys produced 272 collections, containing a total of 7,775 sherds. Full-coverage survey with systematic surface collection later was carried out at three of these sites (Emal, San Fernando, and Loche). These were selected for their archaeological importance throughout the Chikinchel sequence, and also because they appear in the sixteenth-century documentary record. Methods were adapted 2 The locations of Emal and Loche were pinpointed by Ralph Roys (1957) during his pioneering surveys. Thirty-nine of the sites in the Chi kinchel sample were registered previously during surveys carried out for the Atlas arqueológico del estado de Yucatan (Garza Tarazona de' Gonza les and Kurjack 1980), and several more are noted in Zonas arqueológicas Yucatán (Velázquez M. et al. 1988). However, none of these sites was mapped or surface collected and dated through ceramics prior to the Chi kinchel Project surveys.</page><page sequence="3">Ceramics and society in the Chikinchel region 123 Figure 2. Chikinchel survey sites. from the strategies of the great Mesoamerican highland surveys (Blanton et al. 1982, 1993; Kowalweski et al. 1989; Sanders et al. 1979). Modern land use is conducive to this kind of reconnais sance; most of Chikinchel has been cleared for cattle grazing or short-fallow ejido plots. Aerial photographs at a scale of 1:5000 were used as base maps. The photos covered blocks 36 km2 cen tered on the architectural core of each settlement. Pedestrian crews systematically combed the delineated areas on a field-by-field ba sis. All visible features were mapped on the aerial photographs and recorded in field notes. Surface sherds were encountered and collected at approximately 80% of the registered structures from the three survey units. This process yielded a combined total of 3,549 collections, altogether containing roughly 108,000 sherds. At each of the full-coverage sites, collections made at the main architectural cores during the first surveys proved to be effective predictors of the chronology of the rest of the settlement. What follows is a diachronic description of Chikinchel's ce ramic inventory and a discussion of some of the spatial patterns that emerge from the survey data. These patterns reveal how Chi kinchel developed in relation to neighboring areas through time. In the final section of this paper I synthesize the results of the dis tributional studies and paste analyses, contributing new insights into the ancient political and economic processes of northeast Yu catan (see also Feinman 1982; Kepecs et al. 1995; Shepard 1974). THE EARLY PERIOD: CHICANEL AND COCHUAH CERAMICS IN THE CHIKINCHEL REGION The early ceramics of Yucatan are marked by a lack of technolog ical sophistication. There is a limited repertory of vessel forms (mostly tecomates, flat-bottomed bowls, and dishes with flared sides), paste color is inconsistent, and aplastic inclusions or tem pers consist of randomly sized particles of several varieties. Di versity in paste color results from two factors: different kinds of impurities in the clay (iron or organic materials), and variation in firing atmosphere, temperature, and duration (Rice 1987:333). Much greater variability in the temper and color of Early period ceramics compared to the wares of succeeding epochs reflects the potters' increased skills in later centuries with regard to selection of materials and firing technology. Temporal and spatial distinctions among ceramics representing the first 800 years of broad-scale occupation on the peninsula (ca. 100 b.c.-a.d. 700) are still poorly understood. The pottery of the northern plains during this long span includes two principal groups of red-slipped wares (Sierra and Xanaba); various incised bi chromes (usually split into several poorly defined types, among which I do not distinguish); smooth and striated plain wares; and regional polychromes. These ceramics traditionally are divided into two sequential horizons: the Late Formative Chicanel sphere3 and its Early Classic counterpart, Cochuah. The plainwares probably span this division, and it is generally agreed that the bichromes are Cochuah. The redwares are somewhat more problematic. On strat igraphic grounds, Robles Castellanos (1987, 1990; also Andrews et al. 1988) places both red-slipped groups in Chicanel, although Xanaba is "late" within this context (Robles Castellanos 1990:71; see also Ball 1978:101). In Smith's (1971:133,138) scheme, how ever, Sierra is Chicanel, while Xanaba is part of the later, Cochuah sphere. On technological grounds, Smith's distinction makes sense. The most salient quality of Chicanel pastes in the northeast (at least in Chikinchel and at Coba) is softness4; sherds have rounded edges, and some nearly disintegrate under the pliers (see also Robles Cas tellanos 1990:60). Paste color is variable in the red, light red, red dish brown, yellowish brown, light brown, and brown Munsell ranges. Calcite temper is the rule; often this is fine-grained but punctuated by occasional large, gravel-size chunks. Cochuah ce ramics (epitomized by the bichromes) are hard and clunky by com parison. Paste is porous and friable; it fractures rather than crumbles, although some sherds break more easily than others. Sherds ex hibit diverse paste colors in the light red, reddish brown, yellow ish brown, pink, gray, and light gray ranges.5 They contain variable kinds of temper including calcite (Figure 3a), grog, and vegetable fiber (Figure 3b). These ingredients can occur separately or in the same sherd. Calcite inclusions in a single sherd can vary radically in size, although medium, coarse, and very coarse grains are more typical than fine or gravel-sized ones. Based on these qualities, what I call Sierra is Chicanel, while Xanaba belongs with the bi chromes in Cochuah. This division is an oversimplification, but it serves as a useful heuristic tool for developing a preliminary chro nology based on surface-collected materials. Local varieties of Sierra mark the Late Formative across the Maya lowlands. Xanaba is more specific to Yucatan, where it is broadly distributed (Ball 1978:101; Robles Castellanos 1990:72; Smith 1971:31). The bichromes (also specific to the northern low lands) span the coast from the northwest to Tancah on the eastern seaboard, but inland most are limited to the northeast plains, skirt ing the western area (Andrews et al. 1988; Ball 1978:110; Bey 3 Very little has been published on Formative occupations in Yucatan; Middle Formative components are reported at several sites including Kom chen (Andrews V 1989; Ringle and Andrews V 1990) and Ek Balam (Bey et al. 1998), but many regions, including Chikinchel, do not appear to have been broadly settled until the Late Formative. 4 We are only beginning to recognize the great variability in Early pe riod ceramics. At Komchen in western Yucatan, Andrews V (1989) notes both hard- and soft-paste variants of Sierra, although the former prevails. 5 Researchers report different color ranges for Sierra, Xanaba, and the bichromes; those noted by Robles Castellanos (1990) can overlap and some times vary from those I observed on the Chikinchel materials. However, reports agree that the bichromes most typically have gray pastes, although browns, reds, and pinks also occur; the reverse holds for Xanaba (see also Robles Castellanos 1990).</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3. Thin sections of diagnostic ceramics: (a) Calcite, Cochuah (40x); (b) vegetable fiber, Chochuah; rounded particle at lower left is calcite [40x]; (c) volcanic ash and clay-lump inclusions, Sotuta slate (lOOx); (d) calcite, Hocaba/Tases; Tulum red (40x). et al., 1998; Robles Castellanos 1990:82). The distribution of these ceramics suggests a Classic-period link between major interior sites in eastern Yucatan (Coba and Ek Balam) and pan-peninsular coastal developments (see also Andrews and Robles Castellanos 1985). Chikinchel's occupational sequence begins in the Late Forma tive. Collections from 70% of the sites in the regional sample con tain small amounts of Sierra. Later in the Early period occupation increased; Cochuah diagnostics are represented at 90% of the sites (Figure 4). Both Xanaba and the bichromes are abundant. The lat ter situate Chikinchel in the eastern/coastal sphere, which proba bly was involved in a growing salt trade (see also Andrews 1983). Although there are salt sources all along the north coast, the rich est are toward the east, at Emal. Archaeological evidence points to the beginnings of large-scale salt production at this time; Emal has a substantial Cochuah ceramic component, and many of its struc tures originally were built during the Early Classic (Kepecs 1990; Kepecs et al. 1994). Across Yucatan, regional polychromes mirroring the famous Classic-period Peten ceramics (see Ball 1978) coexisted with com mon Cochuah wares. The polychromes mark status as well as time. Their production required greater specialization; elaborate painted designs were the work of trained artisans, and pastes suggest tech nological innovations as well. Polychrome pastes are calcite tem pered, but particles appear to have been sorted, as most are medium in size. The paste matrix is denser and more compact than that of Xanaba and the bichromes. This distinction probably is related to Figure 4. Chikinchel sites with Cochuah ceramics.</page><page sequence="5">Ceramics and society in the Chikinchel region 125 longer firing time6 and/or the use of different clay sources. Color (at least in Chikinchel) usually is a distinctive pink (5YR 7/4), suggesting greater control over materials and firing processes. In Chikinchel, the status-marking function of polychrome ce ramics is underscorded by distribution. At two of the full-coverage sites (Loche and San Fernando), sherds were limited mostly to cen tral architecture and were collected only in small quantities. This pattern is reversed at Emal, reflecting this site's unique prosperity; the Cochuah inventory here includes more polychromes than com mon wares (Kepecs 1995). Most are local Yucatan varieties, but some are Peten imports. THE LATE CLASSIC, OR PRE-CEHPECH: THE BEGINNINGS OF GULF COAST INFLUENCE New ceramics appear toward the end of the Classic period (ca. a.d. 650). The red-slipped and incised bichrome wares of the Cochuah tradition apparently continued to provide the great majority of slipped vessels, but cream-slipped pottery, previously of minor importance, began to take on the characteristics of the distinctive Yucatan slate wares that mark the later, Terminal Classic florescence of the pen insula's most famous sites (including the Puuc centers, Chichen Itza, and Coba). Among elements that distinguish the slates from their Cochuah predecessors are denser paste and more adherent slips. This trend may have begun in the Middle Classic; the first "early slates" resemble good-quality Cochuah ceramics (George Bey and Susan Kepecs, conversations 1994-1997; Boucher 1989). Cream-slipped sherds from Late Classic contexts in the Puuc region, however, dif fer from Cochuah materials technologically; these were the direct antecedents of the full-blown northern-plains slateware tradition oc curring in the next archaeological horizon (Kepecs et al. 1995; cf. Robles Castellanos 1990:109; and see later). In addition, two technologically innovative ceramics that orig inate in the Late Classic along the southern Campeche/Tabasco Gulf Coast (Simmons and Brem 1979) show up at certain sites in the northern lowlands. These are gray fine-paste ware (Chabekal and unspecified varieties) and the ash-and-calcite tempered, red paste Celestun group. These ceramics are characterized by the ap pearance of new vessel forms and consistency in paste color and temper (or lack of temper). Fine Gray is the predecessor of the later Fine Orange wares found in the Usumacinta region and at some sites in Yucatan. Celestun can be characterized as an early slateware that in some ways foreshadows later ceramics from Chi chen (Kepecs et al. 1995); in particular, its hard red paste often is covered by opaque white or cream slips, a hallmark of Itza slates (Brainerd 1958:55). Both Celestun and Fine Gray are reported sporadically along the north coast (Ball 1978). Inland, Fine Gray is noted in very low frequencies at various sites across the northern plains (see Robles Castellanos 1990:157), and in greater quantity at Dzibilchaltun (Bey et al. 1992:16; Smith 1971:18). Celestun's range is more limited; Figure 5. Chikinchel sites with Late Classic Gulf Coast ceramics. prior to the Chikinchel surveys, this pottery was known only at Dzibilchaltun among inland centers (Ball 1978:94, 96; Simmons and Brem 1979:87). In Chikinchel, small amounts of Fine Gray and higher propor tions of Celestun were collected at several coastal sites, and were especially abundant at Emal; inland, however, these ceramics were recovered only at San Fernando (Figure 5). The presence of these southern gulf ceramics along the northern littoral suggests early interest in the rich saltworks by post-Teotihuacan Gulf Coast en trepreneurs (see Ball 1977; Kepecs et al. 1994). This picture is compatible with Eric Thompson's (1970; see also Andrews and Robles Castellanos 1985) "Putun hypothesis," in which merchant warriors from the Gulf Coast spread into Yucatan at the end of the Classic; notable among these groups were the Itza,7 who estab lished themselves eventually at Chichen. Dzibilchaltun and San Fernando, both thriving towns during the Late Classic, must have been instrumental in the growing trade networks of this period; their inland locations close to the coast were ideal for providing labor and administration for the production and distribution of high quality salt. These Late Classic developments were accompanied by an ap parent change in the links between coastal settlements and inland centers on the northeast plains. Robles Castellanos and Andrews (1986) have argued that by the Terminal Classic, the Itza effec tively had cut Coba off from the coast. Yet red-slipped, Late Clas sic horizon markers from that site (the Batres and Arena groups; Robles Castellanos 1990) are absent in Chikinchel, suggesting that this shift may have occurred slightly earlier. THE TERMINAL CLASSIC/EARLY POSTCLASSIC, a.d. 750-1150: THE CEHPECH/SOTUTA OVERLAP By the beginning of the Terminal Classic, cream-slipped ceramics predominated over reds. These majority wares were fullblown "slates," named for the chalkboard color of their finish and marked by strong, dense pastes and a variety of new, standardized vessel forms (see Brainerd 1958:93; also Smith 1971). A certain inven 6 Preliminary experiments on Yucatan ceramics from the Early Classic through the Late Postclassic (Kepecs et al. 1995) showed that firing tem perature varied little through time; pots generally were fired at 700-750°C (see also Feinman et al. 1989). This is typical of the temperature range achieved in open-pit firings, which probably were the most common means of manufacturing ancient Mesoamerican ceramics (see Rice 1987:20-21; Rye 1981:25; Shepard 1974:83-84). However, characteristics of clays also can be altered through the addition of different aplastics, as well as through changes in the duration of firing. 7 The term "Itza" is used to refer to a powerful group from the Gulf Coast that challenged Late Classic rulers in parts of Yiicatan and probably ultimately allied with them. Evidence points to a change in government in this region, but not to a replacement of local, northern plains populations (see Andrews 1990; Kepecs et al. 1994; Thompson 1970).</page><page sequence="6">tory of Late Classic forms and surface treatments evolved into the Cehpech slatewares of the gray-slipped western (Puuc) and brown slipped eastern (Coba) traditions (Bey et al. 1992; Robles Caste llanos and Andrews 1986). Formal differences, cream or stark white slips, and greater paste standardization (Kepecs et al. 1995) dis tinguish the Sotuta slates (the hallmark ceramic of Chichen Itza) from the Cehpech sphere. Smith (1971) split Cehpech and Sotuta chronologically, linking the former to the "Terminal Classic" and the latter to the "Early Postclassic." However, more recent research from projects across the peninsula indicates at least partial temporal overlap between these two spheres. Empirically, their relationship varies across space. Cehpech and Sotuta frequently occur together; but while Cehpech clearly predominates at the Puuc sites (Smith 1971), Coba (Robles Castellanos 1990), Ek Balam (Bey et al. 1992; Ringle et al. 1991), and Yaxuna (see Robles Castellanos 1990), stronger ties to the Itza-related Sotuta complex are evident in Chikinchel, at Isla Cerritos (Andrews et al. 1988; Robles Castellanos 1987), and across much of the Cupul region between Chichen and the coast (Figure 6; and see Anderson 1998; Andrews et al. 1989; Kepecs and Gallareta Negrón 1995; Kepecs et al. 1994). There is no evidence in northeast Yucatan to suggest that Ceh pech predates Sotuta. At Isla Cerritos, Sotuta slates always were present in strata containing Cehpech materials, and continued after the latter's disappearance (Andrews et al. 1988:201; Robles Caste llanos 1987:104). At Yula (a small site near Chichen), Sotuta and Ceh pech also are coeval, and in one sealed, stratigraphic context Sotuta actually preceedes Cehpech (Anderson 1998). Sotuta clearly pre vails at Chichen, but in a recent sample small amounts of Cehpech also were encountered in 17 out of 22 test pits (Lincoln 1991:229, 258). At Coba, in contrast, small numbers of Sotuta sherds were in trusive in Cehpech contexts (Robles Castellanos 1990:212-213). Thus, the slatewares appear to represent a single archaeological ho rizon spanning roughly 400 years. The old chronological terminol ogy urgently needs revision, but until researchers can agree on refinements it is expedient to refer to the Cehpech/Sotuta era by the clumsy composite term "Terminal Postclassic/Early Postclassic" (for another alternative, cf. Kepecs et al. 1994). The slatewares represent a major departure from Cochuah tech nology. Their remarkable density probably is related in part to fac tors such as longer firing duration and the selection of better clays. Additionally, many slates were tempered with volcanic ash. The presence of this microscopic, nonlocal material in Yucatan's slates has been the subject of some debate (e.g., Isphording and Wilson 1974; cf. Simmons and Brem 1979). However, four separate pet rographic studies (Chung 1993; Kepecs et al. 1995; Shepard Figure 6. Regions with principal ties to Sotuta or Cehpech ceramic spheres. 1951:242,1964:251, also cited in Smith 1971:1:269; Simmons and Brem 1979) involving a combined total of over 500 sherds each of Cehpech and Sotuta materials override any lingering doubts; these distinctive glass splinters were used abundantly as temper during the Terminal Classic/Early Postclassic. Cehpech and Sotuta slates differ somewhat in terms of overall recipe. The composition of Sotuta paste in particular is remark ably homogeneous. Ninety-nine percent of the Sotuta sherds from the combined petrographic studies contained ash, accompanied by occasional calcite and clay lump inclusions (Figure 3c). The sam pled Cehpech slates also contained calcite and clay lumps (or some times grog), but less than half contained volcanic ash. Unfortunately, all of the Cehpech samples were taken from Puuc sites; to date, comparable information from Coba and other key northeastern cen ters is not available. Ash is a superior tempering agent, adding strength to the paste by bonding with the clay particles even at the relatively low firing temperatures typical of ancient Mesoamerican ceramics (see Kepecs etal. 1995; Nelson 1984; Rice 1987:407; Rye 1981:108). The tiny particles (which range from silt sized to fine on the Wentworth scale) also leave the surface unmarred, providing improved con ditions for slip (Shepard 1974:27-29). Since ash temper is not vis ible to the naked eye, this attribute is not helpful for expediently classifying large numbers of sherds. In addition to form and slip, however, slates manufactured in different regions have distinct paste colors. Cehpech pastes from the Puuc sites tend to be gray or brown, while Sotuta paste almost always is red (Smith 1971:28). This pic ture is complicated by the Coba materials, which are formally Ceh pech but frequently have brown or reddish paste (Robles Castellanos 1990:184). Therefore, without any trace of slip or form it is difficult to distinguish "Coba" Cehpech from Sotuta sherds. Still, slatewares are the most durable of northern plains ceramics; sherds with identifying formal elements or slip are common. In addition to the slates, the Cehpech and Sotuta spheres have parallel sets of minority wares that overlap technologically but can be distinguished on formal or decorative grounds when sherds retain traces of these elements. Red-slipped, ash-tempered pot tery and Fine Orange wares belong in this category. Like the ear lier polychromes, these ceramics are prestige markers; they often are more elaborately decorated than common slipped serving vessels, and the manufacture of fine-paste pottery in particular involved special technological expertise (Kepecs 1995). Further, the distributions of these ceramics generally are limited to elite contexts. Cehpech prestigewares include Teabo red and Altar Fine Orange; the Sotuta versions are Dzibiac red and Silho Fine Orange. I focus here on Sotuta, since prestigewares identified as Ceh pech are all but absent in the Chikinchel collections. Dzibiac is similar technologically to the slates but often has finer paste. Add ing to its prestige panache, Dzibiac's formal repertory reflects the influence of Silho, which in turn suggests "foreign" (possibly Mex ican) influences (Brainerd 1958:56; Smith 1971:1:181). On the pen insular scale, Dzibiac appears limited to Chichen, Mayapan, and the sites between Chichen and the coast (see Andrews et al. 1988; Kepecs et al. 1994; Robles Castellanos 1987; Smith 1971). Silho overlaps this distribution, but also is represented at more exotic locations along the coast from Veracruz to CozumeL (Ball 1978:102). Slates were three times as common as Dzibiac in the Carnegie collections from Chichen (Smith 1971:174, 178).

It is rare, indicating restricted use; at Chichen the number of recovered Silho sherds is about one-tenth the size of the Dzibiac sample (Smith 1971:182). Cehpech and Sotuta in Chikinchel Sotuta prevails over Cehpech in Chikinchel. This is not surpris ing, since (as I have discussed in detail elsewhere) the regional settlement pattern consists of strings of secondary Itza centers run ning from Chichen to its port at Isla Cerritos (Andrews 1990; An drews et al. 1988) and the Emal saltworks (Figure 7; and see Kepecs et al. 1994; Kepecs and Gallareta Negrón 1995). Farther east there is less evidence of Itza influence. Sotuta slates are broadly distributed; they were collected at 75% of the sites in the Chikinchel sample (Figure 8), and at the intrasite level they are the most common ceramic marker of the Terminal Figure 8. Chikinchel sites with Sotuta slates. Figure 9. Chikinchel sites with Dzibiac red ceramics. Classic/Early Postclassic era.8 In contrast, Dzibiac (Figure 9) and Silho (Figure 10) are limited to the western and central portions of Chikinchel, remaining closer to Chichen than the slates. Dzibiac, however, was more broadly distributed than Silho,9 which was re covered only from the most strategic centers leading to the coast and along the littoral. Site-level data provide more context for these ce ramics. At San Fernando and Loche, Sotuta prestige sherds were col lected in small quantities and were limited almost exclusively to central architecture. Not surprisingly, at Emal generous quantities 8 Eroded, red-paste slate body sherds in the Chikinchel collections were classified as Sotuta, because most were noted in collections that included identifiable Sotuta materials. Unfortunately this method of classification probably obscures the influence of Coba in Chikinchel, but even so this must have been minimal, given the overwhelming evidence for Itza activ ity in the region. 9 As I note in earlier papers (Kepecs 1994; Kepecs et al. 1994), Silho and its successor (Late Postclassic Matillas Fine Orange) only can be dis tinguished on the basis of formal and design elements. Although many fine orange sherds in the Chikinchel collections were placed in the "Un identified Fine Orange" (UFO) category, those that could be classified show markedly different distribution patterns for the two groups. Figure 10. Chikinchel sites with Siiho Fine Orange ceramics.</page><page sequence="8">Figure II. Chikinchel sites with Cehpech slates. of both Dzibiac and Silho were recovered from over half of the site's structures. Although the Sotuta horizon prevails in Chikinchel, other ce ramic currents trace links between this territory and the broader arena of pan-peninsular interactions. Cehpech sherds have vari able pastes and slips; some may have been produced locally, while others have characteristics typical of Puuc or Coba slates. Ceh pech ceramics were recorded at only 11% of the sites in the re gional sample (Figure 11), and composed very low proportions of the overall assemblages from the full coverage sites (Figure 12). The small quantities of Cehpech mixed with abundant Sotuta sherds in Chikinchel mirror proportions at Chichen, suggesting that the latter were in common use in Itza territory, while the rare Cehpech materials were a prestige-goods overlay (Anderson 1998; Kepecs et al. 1994; Lincoln 1991:229-267). A very preliminary spatial distinction between the two Ceh pech spheres emerges at the regional level. A few brown-slipped 100 Emal San Fernando Sotuta Cehpech VNlV «&lt;* ;';V ■■■ vvv Loche Figure 12. Percentage of Late Postclassic platforms with Sotuta and Cepech ceramics at the full-coverage sites. sherds were collected at eastern sites and also at San Fernando and Emal, suggesting that Coba was not entirely cut off from the coast during this period. In contrast, sherds with characteristic Puuc col oring generally were limited to sites in the west and along the coastal strip. Two additional horizon markers of the Terminal Classic/Early Postclassic are fairly common in Chikinchel. These ceramics, Vista Alegre and Peto Cream, transcend the traditional boundaries of the Cehpech and Sotuta spheres. Below, I expand what we know about these wares by adding their Chikinchel distributions to the pan-peninsular picture. Vista Alegre: The Northeast Sphere Sherds from unslipped domestic pots are not always diagnostic, but Vista Alegre, a group of striated tecomates and jars (or drums) from this period, is identifiable by the presence of visible quartz crystals in addition to calcite inclusions in the paste (Robles Cas tellanos 1990:178). Vista is distributed almost exclusively in the northeast; it is reported from Coba, Cozumel, and other Quintana Roo sites (Ball 1978:114-115; Robles Castellanos 1990:179; Sand ers 1960). Robles Castellanos (1990) places this ware in the Ceh pech complex at Coba, but it also is present at sites slightly farther west, in contexts that are primarily Itza related. Vista does not ap pear in the ceramic literature on Chichen, and only a few sherds were recovered at Yula (Patricia K. Anderson, personal commu nication 1997). However, it is common at Isla Cerritos (Andrews et al. 1988; Robles Castellanos 1987). In Chikinchel, Vista is fairly frequent at sites toward the east and along the coast (Figure 13). Its distribution, like that of the brown-slipped, Coba-style Ceh pech slates, suggests that Classic-period connections in eastern Chi kinchel were not entirely obliterated by Itza restructuring. Where to Put Peto Cream? The problem of Peto Cream is more chronological than spatial. Various researchers have noted controversy over the temporal iden tity of this calcite-tempered slate imitation (Hanson 1991; Lincoln 1991:323-328; Ringle et al. 1991; Robles Castellanos 1990:240; Smith 1971:1: 26), and there may be some empirical variation in its placement across the peninsula. For example, at Isla Cerritos Figure 13. Chikinchel sites with Vista Alegre ceramics.</page><page sequence="9">Ceramics and society in the Chikinchel region 129 Figure 14. Chikinchel sites with Peto Cream ceramics. Peto is an integral part of the Sotuta complex (Andrews et al. 1988:201-202; Robles Castellanos 1987:105-106; cf. Ringle et al. 1991:2), while it is associated with Late Postclassic red wares at Mayapan10 (Smith 1971:1: 200, 232, 234). Peto sherds are identifiable even when eroded; their dense paste is heavily tempered with coarse black and white calcite, and their color usually is light red to light reddish brown. Peto is distributed widely across western and central Chikinchel (Figure 14). Al though this pattern follows the Itza corridor, many of the collec tions in which Peto is present contain both Terminal Classic/Early Postclassic and Late Postclassic ceramics. Therefore, its temporal affinities cannot be addressed directly from the data. The paste, however, gives the impression that this pottery may have origi nated during the Itza period as a cheap version of the better crafted, ash-tempered Sotuta slatewares it resembles. (The Cehpech sphere also has an imitation slateware, the sherd-tempered Cauich coarse cream; Smith 1971:15). At the beginning of the Late Post classic, ash temper became scarce, probably because of interrup tions in the trade routes through which it was procured (Kepecs 1994; Kepecs et al. 1994). Potters again relied on locally available materials. Peto became the sole remnant of the cream-slip tradi tion previously glorified in the ash-tempered slatewares. THE LATE POSTCLASSIC: a.d. 1150-1450: THE HOCABA/TASES COMPLEX" The Late Postclassic is marked by a complete return to calcite tempered pastes and a preference for red-slipped ceramics. How ever, this shift is not accompanied by a return to Classic-period technology. Late Postclassic, Hocaba/Tases-sphere ceramics (like Peto) differ from their Cochuah counterparts, having greater paste density and uniformity of temper (Figure 3d, and discussed in greater detail later), more consistent paste color, and a wide range of forms that continued to evolve from the Cehpech/Sotuta reper tory (see also Smith 1971:1:218). "Mayapan" and "Tulum" redwares are the most common slipped diagnostics of the period. These names, originally linked to "type sites," actually refer to similar, widely produced variants of red slipped ceramics having thicker (Mayapan) or thinner (Tulum) ves sel walls. The distinction is somewhat heuristic. In the Carnegie type collections, however, vessel walls from Mayapan pots typi cally are thicker than .5 cm (7-8 mm is common), while those from Tulum generally measure .5 cm to slightly less. The east west peninsular distributions of some of the earlier ceramics give way to more complex patterns in the Late Postclassic (see Robles Castellanos 1990:220-237, 262-263). Thicker redwares prevail at Mayapan and Coba, while thin reds predominate on the east coast. Major unslipped groups in the Hocaba/Tases sphere include Chen Mul effigy censers and related incensario types as well as utilitar ian wares. These usually can be distinguished from the unslipped materials of earlier eras by their paste, which retains the charac teristics of Late Postclassic slipped wares. Of course, with very eroded sherds the distinction between slipped and unslipped is blurred. The paste, however, remains temporally diagnostic. Other Hocaba/Tases markers include Matillas Fine Orange, and, at least in the early phase of the Late Postclassic, Peto Cream. Ma tillas, the key prestige ware of this period, is reported from sites along the Campeche and Quintana Roo coasts, but not from Isla Cerritos; inland it occurs at Dzibilchaltun, Mayapan, and (in small quantities) at Coba (Ball 1978:91; Robles Castellanos 1990:236). Settlement shifts across the peninsula indicate sweeping change. The Puuc centers and Coba declined (e.g., Robles Castellanos and Andrews 1986), along with Chichen, Isla Cerritos, and the rest of the settlements in the Cupul region adjacent to Chikinchel (An drews et al. 1989; Bey et al. 1998; Kepecs et al. 1994; Kepecs and Gallareta Negrón 1995). Hocaba/Tases ceramics are present at some of these sites, but in notably smaller quantities than the diagnos tics of the preceeding period (see Robles Castellanos 1987, 1990). Different centers reached their peaks: Mayapan in the west, and Tulum and other sites in Ecab (today Quintana Roo), Chikinchel's neighbor to the east (see Andrews 1993). A full-blown Hocaba/ Tases horizon in Chikinchel links this territory to the new growth areas rather than to the dwindling cores of the Terminal Classic/ Early Postclassic. Hocaba/Tases in Chikinchel Hocaba/Tases ceramics were recorded at 91 % of the sites in the re gional sample, an increase of 16% over the previous period. The route leading from Chichen to Emal was eclipsed (Kepecs 1994, 1997; Kepecs and Gallareta Negrón 1995). Emal and the towns on the coastal strip retained their long-standing importance, and new cen ters sprang up in the east, which the Itza had failed to incorporate (Fig ure 15). Key settlements were larger than in the preceeding period; at all three full-coverage sites Hocaba/Tases ceramics were more broadly distributed than their Sotuta predecessors. Both "thick" and "thin" redwares are well represented at most Chikinchel sites (Figure 16). These have diverse pastes, in con trast to the more homogeneous Sotuta slates (see also Smith 1971:1:203). There are five distinct paste groups; two thick ("Maya pan" and "Cancun") and three thin ("Tulum," "Local," and "San Fernando"). Distinguishing attributes include paste color and vari ation in calcite inclusions (Table 2). Apparently, this variation does not relate to vessel function, since a range of forms (jars, bowls, 10 Peto usually is considered part of the Hocaba (early facet Late Post classic) complex at Mayapan, but Smith (1971:1:234) notes that it also is present in reduced quantities in later, Tases lots. 11 In Smith's scheme, Hocaba and Tases are sequential complexes rep resenting two phases at Mayapan that supposedly postdated the Itza ep och. However, there are few real distinctions between these two facets, and recent projects at other sites have failed to clarify or support this di vision (see also Bey et al. 1998).</page><page sequence="10">130 Figure 15. The Late Postclassic (Cupul and Chikinchel regional surveys) [after Kepecs 1997:Figure 3; courtesy Plenum Press). dishes) occurs in each paste group. The five varieties are consis tent and can be identified by eye or with a hand lens. Sherds from all five groups were recovered at each of the three full-coverage sites, in different proportions (Figure 17). Chen Muí incensarios (Figure 18) and unslipped Navula ce ramics also are distributed widely across Chikinchel. In contrast, Matillas Fine Orange, like its predecessor, Silho, is highly re stricted. Like Silho, Matillas is common at Emal, but limited to central architecture at Loche and San Fernando. On the regional scale it was collected only at large sites along the coastal strip, primarily those between Emal and the eastern end of the territory (Figure 19). THE TERMINAL POSTCLASSIC/SPANISH OVERLAP: THE "TRANSITIONAL HORIZON" Much remains to be learned about the ceramics of Yucatan after the fall of Mayapan (ca. a.d. 1450; Roys 1957, 1962), since until recently archaeologists tended to rely on documentary sources for information on the Terminal Postclassic and Spanish Colonial periods. Smith (1971:1:246-249) defined two postoccupational complexes at Mayapan, but the first, dated to a.d. 1450-1550, contained only a few insecurely identified sherds of single ware; the second (a.d. 1550-1800) was composed of several poorly described ceramic groups. Red-slipped wares in Smith's second, Figure 16. Chikinchel sites wih thick ["Mayapan") and thin [Tulum] Hocaba/ Tases reds. Colonial-period complex include jars reminiscent of Mayapan red but marked by innovative new "parenthesis" rims, and thinner walled pots similar to Tulum red. In the unslipped category are vessels exhibiting several variants of "groove-hooked" rims pre viously unknown in Yucatan ceramics (for illustrations, see Ball 1978:86, Figure 5; Brainerd 1958:176-179, Figures 33-34; Smith 1971:11:84-85). Despite the temporal assignments of Smith's post-Mayapan com plexes, red-slipped jars with parenthesis rims first appeared in lots at that site that also contained typical Hocaba/Tases wares, dated to the upper end of the Mayapan occupational sequence. Parenthesis rims also occur in Tulum red (Sanders 1960:238). Groove-hooked rims are not represented in the Hocaba/Tases sphere, but they occur in the formal repertory of Cunduacan Fine Orange,12 a Terminal Post classic prestige ware from the Laguna de Términos region (Ball 1978:86-87, Figure 5; Berlin 1960; Matheny 1970). The appear ance of these new forms in pre-Spanish contexts suggests that the ceramics of Smith's Colonial complex actually began evolving from Hocaba/Tases traditions well before the advent of Spanish admin istration. Thus in place of Smith's two post-Mayapan complexes I tentatively define a single ceramic horizon marking the Terminal Postclassic through Spanish periods, which I call "Transitional." I do not mean to suggest a complete break coincident with the fall of Mayapan. Transitional ceramics evidently overlap Hocaba/Tases ma Table 2.

By the second half of the sixteenth century, the newer wares probably prevail. Transitional ceramics include various unslipped wares, among which the best known is the Yuncu group,13 and red-slipped pot tery including thin-walled Abala and thicker Sakpokana14 (see Ball 1978:Figure 5; Brainerd 1958:Figures 33-34; Smith 1971:1:247 248). Yuncu and the post-Tases reds are reported at various sites across the peninsula (Ball 1978; Bey et al. 1998; Brainerd 1958; Figure 18. Chikinchel sites with Chen muí incensarios. Figure 19. Chikinchel sites with Matiiias Fine Orange ceramics. Hanson 1991; Smith 1971). However, it is worth noting that the red-slipped wares are notably more rare than Yuncu, at least in Chikinchel and at neighboring Ek Balam (Bey et al. 1998), two areas where detailed studies of the ceramics from this period cur rently are being carried out. In Chikinchel, Cunduacan Fine Orange from southern Campeche also is part of the Transitional horizon. Cunduacan is extremely rare in Yucatan. Several possible examples were recorded at Maya pan, in postabandonment levels evidently representing the last 70 years of native rule (Smith's [1971 ±246-247] first post-Tases com plex). Yet there was no Cunduacan in Smith's Colonial complex, and this ware remains unreported in other Spanish-era contexts; thus it apparently marks only the Terminal Postclassic portion of the years spanned by the Transitional horizon. Prior to the Chikin chel surveys, there were no reported occurences of Cunduacan in northern Yucatan except at Mayapan. However, sherds were re covered in collections from Emal, San Fernando, and Survey site #46 (Figure 20), suggesting Terminal Postclassic ties between the saltworks and southern Campeche (Kepecs 1994, 1997). As with most ceramics throughout the sequence, sherds of Tran sitional wares can be distinguished from their Hocaba/Tases pre decessors on technological rather than formal grounds. Cunduacan differs from Matillas and Silho by having sandy inclusions not com mon to other fine-orange pastes (author's observations of thin sec tions; also Berlin 1960:135). Yuncu and redwares have pastes that are similar to Tases materials, although overall there is more vari ability in paste color, and in the Chikinchel samples shell and/or sand inclusions occasionally were noted in addition to calcite. Un like Tases unslipped wares, Yuncu has a plain, nondecorative sur face coat (perhaps a "self-slip"; see Rice 1987:151) that is slightly lighter than the core paste; light brushing on one or both surfaces also is a common characteristic (see also Ball 1978:100; Bey et al. 1998). Transitional redwares differ from their Tases coun terparts by having thinner, flakier slips; often they also are more heavily tempered (see also Bey et al. 1998; Smith 1971:1:248). In Chikinchel, Transitional sherds were collected at 23% of the sites in the regional sample. At the three full-coverage sites, the number of platforms marked by Transitional ceramics was slightly less than half that of the proceeding Late Postclassic period (Kepecs 1997). In contrast, Spanish ceramics are limited to the most strategic locations. These include a small colonial 13 Related to Yuncu are other undefined ceramics (sometimes incorpo rating new formal elements) that continue Tases unslipped traditions into the Colonial period (see Robles Castellanos 1990:220). 14 Ware descriptions and nomenclature for post-Tases ceramics remain poorly established in the literature. Unclear distinctions among ware, group, and type names need to be clarified, but my usage (which departs from Smith 1971) should be understandable to all researchers familiar with north ern plains ceramics.</page><page sequence="12">Gulf of Mexico Rio Lagartos t. Transitional Transitional and Spanish Transitional component includes Cunduacan Figure 20. Sites with Transitional and Spanish components (after Kepecs 1997:Figure 6; courtesy Plenum Press). port established at Río Lagartos15 sometime prior to 1579 (see López de Cogolludo 1983[1579-1581]:II:33, 249; Molina Soli's 1988:251); Loche, serving the Spaniards as a halfway point be tween Río Lagartos and a Franciscan monastery at Tizimín (Ciudad Reál 1976 [ca. 1590]:1I:320—321); Emal; and San Fernando. At these locations, European ceramics consist only of small amounts of olive-jar fragments of uncertain date and a few losa sherds postdating the sixteenth century. The small amounts of Spanish ceramics in Chikinchel are not surprising; Spanish settlement made few inroads into this terri tory. Only three examples of colonial architecture are known. These include a few very fragmentary remains of wall foundations at the port at Río Lagartos (personal observation) and two visita churches: one at Loche (López de Cogolludo 1957 ]1688]:Book 4, Capítulo 20; Gallareta Negrón et al. 1990:35; Kepecs 1990), and one at Dzonotake16 (López de Cogolludo 1983 [1579—1581 ]:II:84; Scholes 1938:11:61; and personal observation), 32 km south of Emal. East of Emal and San Fernando, surviving native towns proba bly had little sustained contact with the Spaniards. Foreign admin istration was weak this far from Merida, and the Chikinchel Maya were notoriously rebellious (Kepecs 1997). In 1543 the Spaniards founded the first short-lived Villa de Valladolid at Chauaca, a major Late Postclassic settlement in eastern Chikinchel (López de Cogo lludo 1983 [1579—1581]:II: 136, 243-250; Roys 1957:107-108). However, although two surveys were carried out at this site,17 no ol ive jar sherds were collected. This probably reflects the fact that ar chaeological horizons build up over decades if not centuries, while Spanish occupation here was very brief (less than a year). SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS The preceeding analyses are preliminary, but they contribute to both methodological and spatial/chronological problems facing re searchers in the northern Maya lowlands. Guidelines for paste anal ysis provide a simple, heuristic addition to the type-variety concept that facilitates the identification of sherds from surface contexts. This approach can yield increased proportions of classified mate rials, thereby providing larger, more reliable samples. Substantively, the preliminary ceramic data presented here place Chikinchel, formerly a blank on archaeological maps (see Bey et al. 1992; Robles Castellanos and Andrews 1986), into the larger spatial and chronological frameworks of the peninsula. Through out the pre-Hispanic sequence, Emal's salt was crucial to the re gion's development. Ceramic testimony to this phenomenon is evident in the much higher proportions of prestigewares from all periods collected here than at other Chikinchel sites. Much remains to be learned about the pan-regional interactions that occurred in the northern lowlands during the Classic period, but the northeast distribution of Cochuah incised bichromes sug gests that powerful inland centers (Coba, Ek Balam) maintained links to the coast via sites in Chikinchel. At the end of this period, new ceramics from the southern Campeche coast that appear at Emal and San Fernando are precursors of great change. Their pres ence suggests that Emal's gem-like white salt caught the attention of Gulf Coast entrepreneurs—Thompson's (1970) hypothetical Pu tun, the direct ancestors of the Itza. Multiple lines of archaeolog ical data (regional settlement distributions, architecture, and ceramics) suggest that during the succeeding, Terminal Classic/ Early Postclassic period, the Itza set up a political hierarchy in Chikinchel that was linked to their capital at Chichen and geared toward control of salt production and coastal trade. I have dis cussed the organization of this composite Itza polity in greater de tail elsewhere (Kepecs et al. 1994; see also Kepecs 1997; Kepecs and Gallareta Negrón 1995). In the context of this paper, however, it is important to note that Itza political-economic strategies are reflected in ceramic technol ogy. Since highly centralized governments control economic func tions, ceramic production in such situations might be controlled or administrated. Reduced competition, coupled with the demands of high-intensity manufacture, should be reflected in a relatively high degree of product standardization (Feinman 1982:181). The ho mogeneity of the Sotuta slates probably is a consequence of this process. In the Late Postclassic, the Itza polity broke apart. No political capital on the order of Chichen arose to coordinate another re gional state; instead, independent señoríos (or batabils) in Chikin chel occupied small territories18 (Okoshi 1994; Quezada 1993; 15 The port at Río Lagartos was built over the long-occupied native site of Holkoben (see Ball 1978; Eaton 1978; Kepecs 1990). 16 David Webster (1978, 1980) carried out some excavation at Dzono take in the 1970s, but published information on ceramics from this project is abbreviated. 17 Following documentary descriptions (Oviedo y Valdés 1853 [1535— 1547]; Roys 1957) and eighteenth-century maps in the possession of Luis Millet (CRY-INAH), several Terminal Postclassic sites in Chikinchel were identified archaeologically. Among them is Chauaca, a vast tract of pre Hispanic settlement in northeastern Chikinchel that Roys expected but failed to find in the same location (Kepecs 1990; Millet, personal communica tion 1989). This area was supposed to be included in my project as one of the full-coverage survey blocks. However, since the first three sites turned out to be much larger than expected, I ran out of time and money before this could be accomplished. Instead (in addition to first-stage, regional sur vey procedures), the architectural core was mapped onto the airphotos, and photo-aided, intensive road-and-trail surveys covered the rest of the survey block and surrounding area. This field strategy netted a preliminary sketch of the settlement's overall house-mound distribution, although be yond the core nothing was mapped formally or surface collected. 18 Groups of independent batabils probably formed fleeting alliances from time to time (Marcus 1993; Okoshi 1994; Quézada 1993; Roys 1957), but there is no historical or archaeological evidence of a consolidated, multi level polity in Late Postclassic Chikinchel.</page><page sequence="13">Ceramics and society in the Chikinchei region 133 Roys 1957). In weak political systems, independent producers are free to compete (Feinman 1982); the patterned diversity of Hocaba/ Tases pastes suggests the rise of rival potters' groups in the ab sence of centralized administration (Kepecs 1995, 1997). Late Postclassic Chikinchel settlements grew and prospered. The ceramic data indicate an increase in the number of occupied sites across the region and growth in settlement size at the three full coverage sites during this period. There was a florescence in the east, which had been on the Itza periphery. Sites in this zone fit Spanish descriptions of thriving trading ports (e.g., Diaz del Cas tillo 1984; Oviédo y Valdés 1853:111:32; also Kepecs 1994, 1997). Further (in contrast to Late Postclassic shifts in other parts of the Itza corridor), sites in west and central Chikinchel did not decline, and salt trade with southern Campeche did not end with Chichen's collapse. The presence of Cunduacan Fine Orange at Emal and San Fernando reflects ties to the Putun homeland on the eve of the Spanish invasion. Finally, the Chikinchel ceramic data reveal the eastern periph eries of Spanish administration, and show that native settlement in this region diminished but was not obliterated in the sixteenth cen tury. Transitional ceramics also suggest two economic shifts that occurred in the post-invasion period (Kepecs 1997). First, the pro duction of prestigewares apparently ended with the advent of Span ish administration, reflecting the natives' loss of control over prosperous long-distance trade routes and the production of re lated exchange goods. Second, reduced emphasis on slipped or dec orated vessels and greater variability in temper or inclusions in common ceramic pastes (compared to the clear patterns of the Late Postclassic redwares) suggests that production became less spe cialized (and more localized) when the native economy was bent to European demands. RESUMEN En este artículo se presentan nuevos datos cerámicos procedentes de una región antes poco conocida llamada Chikinchel en el noreste de Yucatán. Estos datos resultan de reconocimientos a dos niveles. A nivel regional se hicieron recolecciones de superficie en los centros arquitectónicos de 72 sitios. A nivel del sitio, se llevaron a cabo recorridos sistemáticos de "com pleta cobertura" con recoleción de superficie en tres de estos asentamien tos, escogidos por tener importancia durante la secuencia prehispánica y también porque hay descripciones de ellos en las fuentes históricas del siglo XVI. Más de 115,000 tiestos proporcionan la información utilizada en este estudio. Aquí tengo dos metas. La primera es ampliar la utilidad analítica de materiales cerámicos procedentes de la superficie. Utilizo métodos de cla sificación que además de las características tradicionalmente notadas como forma y acabado (las cuales frecuentmente no se presentan en los tiestos erosionados de superficie) incluye una consideración de atributos tecnológi cos (análisis de pasta). La segunda es situar Chikinchel dentro del marco espacial y temporal proporcionado por los arqueólogos trabajando en otras partes de la península. Los resultados del análisis presente sugieren que durante toda la época prehispánica la región participó en un próspero co mercio basado en sus blancas salinas naturales que son las más grandes del sur de mesoamérica. La secuencia temporal de Chikinchel y los grupos cerámicos que cor responden a cada período arqueológico notado en la región se presentan en Tabla 1. Durante la segunda parte del período temprano (el "clásico tem prano") la cosecha de las salinas chikincheleñas aumentó a gran escala. El sitio de Emal, ubicado en medio de estas fuentes, tiene un componente substancial de la cerámica Cochuah, y abundan tiestos de los polícromos regionales sugeriendo la prosperidad del sitio. Luego, durante el "clásico tardío" aparecen nuevos vínculos cerámicos entre Chikinchel y el golfo de Campeche, sugeriendo la "hipótesis putun" de Eric Thompson en la cual "comerciantes-guerreros" del Golfo de México entraron a Yucatán al tiempo de la caída de los grandes centros ceremoniales del Petén. Después, durante los siglos tradicionalmente señalados como los perío dos clásico terminal y postclásico temprano, los datos cerámicos parecen indicar que la región fue parte del territorio controlado por los poderosos itzas. Abundantes cantidades de la cerámica Sotuta, marcador del hori zonte itza, se reportan en todos los sitios grandes entre Chichen y Emal. Con respecto al bien conocido problema cronológico de esta época, los datos cerámicos de Chikinchel también apuntan al modelo del "traslape Cehpech/Sotuta." Aquí se apoya un traslape total. Los grandes y famosos sitios del clásico terminal/postclásico tem prano (incluyendo los del Puuc, Chichen y Coba) disminuyeron en el post clásico tardío mientras Mayapan y los sitios de la costa oriental florecían. Según los documentos españoles el florecimiento de estos lugares se debía a un próspero comercio. Los datos cerámicos indican la participación de Chikinchel en este proceso. Emal mantenía su importancia y la dis tribución regional de la cerámica Hocaba/Tases de este período indica un aumento en el número de sitios ocupados. Los datos también muestran crecimiento al nivel del sitio, ya que hay un notable incremento sobre el período anterior en el número de plataformas habitacionales marcadas por tiestos del complejo Hocaba/Tases. Chikinchel aparentemente se encontraba en las periferias lejanas de la administración española. La cerámica española está muy mal representada en toda la región. Se recolectaron algunos tiestos de jarra de olivo en ciertos sitios del poniente y también en Emal. Empero, en el oriente de Chikinchel no hay huella de la cerámica europea. Según las fuentes documentales, en el año 1543 los españoles se establecieron brevemente en el sitio indígeno de Chauaca ubicado en esta zona, pero en menos de 12 meses los extranjeros se trasladaron tierra adentro, donde se fundó el centro administrativo de Va lladolid. El breve acontecimiento en Chauaca no permitió la acumulación de vasijas europeas en cantidades suficientes para que perduren tiestos en el re gistro arqueológico. En contraste, la presencia de la cerámica indígena de este período fue notada en varios sitios en el oriente y el sur de Chikinchel, lo cual sugiere que esta región seguía como una zona libre. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This is a revised version of a paper that was presented in the symposium organized by Traci Ardren and Charles Suhler entitled "Chronological Frameworks for Ancient Maya Development: New Evidence from North eastern Yucatan," at the 93rd Annual Meeting of the American Anthropo logical Association, Atlanta. Funding for the Chikinchel Project was provided by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. Fulbright HE, National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement Grant #BNS 89-02631, and a University of Wisconsin Graduate School Foreign Travel Fellowship. The Chikinchel Project was facilitated with the assis tance of Lorena Mirambell Silva and Alejandro Martinez Muriel, directors of the Consejo de Arqueología at INAH, and Alfredo Barrera Rubio, di rector of CRY-INAH in Mérida. The surveys, of course, could not have been carried out without my dedicated field crews and the gracious help of many other modern Chikincheleños. To Luis Millet C. I owe the historical identification of several key sites discussed in this paper. Special thanks are due to Sylviane Boucher, Rafael Burgos, Yoli Palomo, Carlos Peraza, Patricia Anderson, and George Bey, with whom I have had countless dis cussions about Yucatan ceramics over the last decade. I also am grateful to</page><page sequence="14">134 Kepecs Will Andrews for providing me access to his unpublished material on the Komchen ceramics; his detailed type descriptions made me aware of com plexities concerning the technology of Early period ceramics that 1 was unable to discuss fully in this paper. Instrumental in my petrographic anal yses were Jim Burton, Sherman Banker, and especially Jim Stoltman, who taught me how to analyze paste and why this was important. Sherman Banker took the photomicrographs included in this paper, and was a con stant source of support, both technological and moral. Thanks are due to Plenum Press and the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory for permission to reporduce three figures that originally appeared in Kepecs (1997). Reviews of an earlier draft by Joe Ball, George Bey, and Bill Rin gle provided valuable guidelines for improvements; I hope I have man aged to answer some of their questions in this version. Tony Andrews, Linda Nicholas, and Gary Feinman also read and commented on various drafts of this paper. All errors of fact or interpretation, however, are solely my own.
