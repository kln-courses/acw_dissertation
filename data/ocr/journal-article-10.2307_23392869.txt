It seeks, in the words of a leading environmental philosopher, to specify "duties to and values in the natural world" (Rolston, title). From its modest beginnings in a few journal articles and conference presentations in the 1970s, environmental ethics has grown to become an important subfield within academic philosophy, its growth spurred by the immense environmental problems posed by our modern world economy with its powerful technologies and rapidly increasing human numbers. In developing a strong environmental ethics, I believe no thinker has more to offer us than Henry Thoreau. In particular, Thoreau is a leading critic of anthropocentrism: the view that only human beings have rights or "intrinsic value" and that other creatures are solely valuable as human resources and may be used any way we see fit. Most contemporary environmental philosophers believe that recognizing the intrinsic value of nonhuman nature is the key to creating a new ethics which will preserve the environment and all the many species with whom we share it. Thoreau anticipates contemporary intrinsic value arguments, as I show below. But if this were all he had done, from a philosophical point of view he would be an interesting precursor and little more. On the contrary, Thoreau provides a detailed discussion of what recognizing nature's intrinsic value demands from us and practical suggestions for how we can live up to those demands. This discussion should prove valuable to environmental philosophers, who have been quicker to argue for intrinsic value in general terms than to specify exactly what follows from its recognition. Thoreau also describes specific techniques for paying attention to the nonhuman world and explores a variety of perspectives which help him "take wider views of the universe" (Thoreau, Journal, 418, 2 April 1852). In these ways, he suggests a more comprehensive non-anthropocentric outlook to complement a new non-anthropocentric value system. Perhaps most important, Thoreau provides an example of how to lead a happy, flourishing life while still respecting nature. There is a great practical need to develop positive arguments for environmental protection. The recognition of nature's intrinsic value is sometimes seen as intolerably limiting, generating an endless string of environmental "thou shalt nots." Often, the general public views THE CONCORD SAUNTERER, N.S. Volume 10, 2002</page><page sequence="3">18 The Concord Saunterer environmentalists as kill-joys, willing to countenance any trade-offs of human freedom or happiness in pursuit of our aims (Naess 91). Partly this is unavoidable. In defending wild nature, environmentalists are necessarily proscriptive. Recognizing intrinsic value in nature does limit its morally permissible use. Yet the writings of the great naturalists—and our own experiences—tell a story of joyful relationship with nature. The artist, the scientist, the poet, the hunter, the fisherman, all pay attention to nature and "capture value" which enriches their lives. This suggests that a recognition of nature's intrinsic value brings rewards to go with its proscriptions. It suggests that appeals to our enlightened self-interest may supplement environmental appeals based on "thou shalt nots." In an earlier piece in this journal, I argued that Thoreau was a leading exponent of "virtue ethics": that half of ethics which talks less about our duties and responsibilities to others, and more about our opportunities for personal development and flourishing (Cafaro, "Thoreau's Virtue Ethics"). I contend that Walden provides a fully developed and inspiring environmental virtue ethics, which links environmental protection to human happiness and flourishing. This ethics demands restraint from us in our dealings with nature, but in return it offers us hope that we ourselves will lead better lives. Thoreau thus points the way toward a positive environmental ethics. By recognizing nature's value, we enrich our own lives. By restraining our gross physical consumption, we are more likely to lead healthy and enjoyable lives, and promote conditions in which future generations can do the same. By devoting ourselves to higher pursuits than money-making, we act in our enlightened self interest—with great benefits for the many other species with whom we share the Earth. These arguments need to be made along with intrinsic value arguments if we are to convince people to take the steps necessary to protect the natural world. Fishy Virtue Thoreau challenges conventional ethics in many ways, questioning both his contemporaries' values and their commitment to those values. One of his most important challenges is locating value directly in the non-human world, a theme already made explicit in A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers. Early in A Week, Thoreau gives a detailed account of the various species of fish in the Concord River. This is one of those digressions which have annoyed so many readers. "We come upon them like snags," wrote James Russell Lowell, "jolting us headforemost out of our places as we are rowing placidly up stream or drifting down" (Harding 250-51). Thoreau might have integrated this account more smoothly into the narrative, of course, but another alternative would have been to ignore the fish entirely: to glide downstream without noticing them or to carelessly populate the deeps and shallows with undifferentiated or imaginary fish. This is the way of most boaters and most writers. This Thoreau will not do.</page><page sequence="4">Phillip Cafaro 19 Instead, he describes the fish accurately and in detail: their appearance, behavior (nesting, feeding, migrations), habitat preferences, relative abundance, and more. These fish have many fine qualities: the bream "assiduously" guards its nest; the pickerel is "swift and wary." Thoreau plays up both their otherness and their closeness to us: the fish are at once "fabulous inhabitants] of another element, a thing heard of but not seen" and "our finny contemporaries in the Concord waters" (26-27, 30-33). These wonderful creatures are part of the same landscape as ourselves. We may know them if we will but look. Much of this section has little explicit ethical content. At first there are no ethical arguments, just description continually bubbling up into little assertions of goodness: the "grace" of the bream, the "scholastic and classical" beauty of the chivin (26, 29). Finally, however, Thoreau comes to the plight of the shad and other anadromous, migratory fishes. Formerly found in great numbers in New England's rivers, they are now often blocked by dams. Here the definite "ought" of moral concern flows out: Poor shad! where is thy redress? When Nature gave thee instinct, gave she thee the heart to bear thy fate? Still wandering the sea in thy scaly armor to inquire humbly at the mouths of rivers if man has perchance left them free for thee to enter. By countless shoals loitering uncertain meanwhile, merely stemming the tide there, in danger from sea foes in spite of thy bright armor, awaiting new instructions, until the sands, until the water itself, tell thee if it be so or not. Thus by whole migrating nations, full of instinct, which is thy faith, in this backward spring, turned adrift, and perchance knowest not where men do not dwell, where there are not factories, in these days. Armed with no sword, no electric shock, but mere Shad, armed only with innocence and a just cause, with tender dumb mouth only forward, and scales easy to be detached. I for one am with thee, and who knows what may avail a crow bar against that Billerica dam? (37) Our treatment of the shad is unjust—the fish obviously cannot "petition for redress, but they would be justified in doing so. The dams are not merely inconvenient or inexpedient for fishermen, downstream farmers, or other human beings; they are wrong, immoral, because of their effects on "mere Shad." One hundred and thirty years before EarthFirst! Thoreau suggests that the injustice is grave enough to justify a new kind of civil disobedience. We have here not the monstrous injustice of making a mere tool out of a man or woman, but the (equally?) monstrous injustice of extirpating whole species, whole forms of life, from the landscape.</page><page sequence="5">20 The Concord Saunterer Thoreau goes on to provide one of the earliest explicit calls for a non anthropocentric ethics. The passage quoted above continues: Away with the superficial and selfish philanthropy of men,— who knows what admirable virtue of fishes may be below low water mark, bearing up against a hard destiny, not admired by that fellow creature who alone can appreciate it! Reserving all love and concern for humans—phil-anthropy (emphasis in the original) is both superficial, based on ignorance of what is below the surface, and selfish, an excuse for unjustified self-partiality. Thoreau neatly brings his point home with the "fish" puns. Only here, in attempting to nail these charges down, does Thoreau use the word "virtue," making explicit what had been implicit in his earlier descriptions. Thoreau clearly employs the ancient conception of virtue as excellence here rather than the modern conception of virtue as a specifically moral goodness centered on dutifulness or altruism. A fish cannot act morally. But it can flourish as a good of its kind, with a bit of luck. The traits Thoreau praises in the bream and shad arguably are virtues, because they are the characteristic qualities which make these species what they are and which help them succeed in the natural economy of the Concord River.1 Thoreau's suggestion that certain piscine qualities are genuine virtues parallels recent attempts by Holmes Rolston III, Paul Taylor, and other environmental philosophers to justify the intrinsic value of non-human beings: to argue their basic goodness independent of their instrumental value to humans. These philosophers' arguments typically ground intrinsic value in various natural qualities, such as sentience (the ability to feel pleasure and pain), intelligence, goal-directedness, complexity, or beauty. All beings who have these qualities, it is argued, are good-in-themselves, regardless of what further good they may be to us. Recognizing their intrinsic value does not preclude all human use of these non-human beings, but it does set moral limits to that use. In the same way, Thoreau moves from facts to values and from description to prescription, as a (mostly) descriptive section concludes with an explicit assertion of fish virtue and the demands of interspecific justice. Does Thoreau undermine his case for fishy virtue by speaking of the "humility" and "bravery" of fish, qualities which we typically associate with some degree of intelligence, and thus largely or exclusively with humans? Can fish be "innocent" if they cannot be guilty (can infants, or saints)? Thoreau writes "perchance" the shad do not know where rivers still run unobstructed by humans, but of course they do not have conscious knowledge which may be formulated into propositional statements and delivered in scholarly lectures. If Thoreau's argument rests on an inaccurate picture of what shad actually are, it necessarily fails to justify their moral considerability or any after hours crowbar work on the Billerica dam.</page><page sequence="6">Phillip Cafaro 21 There are several ways a sympathetic expositor might respond here. One might argue that shad do possess literal, non-metaphorical knowledge, perhaps as populations, rather than as individuals. Through some combination of genetic programming and environmental cues (of which we are almost as ignorant as Thoreau) they do return to their native spawning grounds. They do "loiter uncertain" until some "intelligence" passes to them from the land or water, some cue which sends them up one particular river or another. They may fail to "know" of any undammed streams, if all the streams have been dammed, just as they "know" of home streams that have "proven" themselves good habitat in the past. The shad cannot be "in suspense" in our sense of conscious uncertainty as to probable outcomes, yet they are suspended in water, and suspended between the fates of continued flourishing and utter destruction. Recall the ancient conception of the virtues: those qualities which foster success and flourishing. Perhaps a less individually-based and conscious knowledge is the shad's equivalent of human practical reason, helping to further shad success as reason (ideally) furthers our own.2 Alternately, we might question the notion that other beings have value only to the degree that they resemble us. Maybe we should value them for their own essential qualities, which might be very different from ours. Typically, those skeptical of nonhuman intrinsic value argue that rationality, or the related ability to act morally, defines and limits moral considerability. Thoreau's admonishment that we are "fellow creatures" who "alone can appreciate" the varied diversity of non-human life suggests the following counterargument: if a true humanity involves the use of reason, that should lead to knowledge of the world around us, and thus to appreciation, and thus to restraint. If we truly value reason, it will show us a world where much besides reason has value. If we truly value diversity, we will have to jettison theories of value centered so firmly in our own nature. Those who argue that we are free to use the rest of nature any way we see fit because we are rational and able to restrain our natural selfishness, show, ironically enough, their own poorly developed knowledge and capacity for altruism. Yet a third alternative is to reject hierarchical morality altogether. Perhaps the notion that the lesser capabilities of some beings give them a lesser value than more accomplished beings is mistaken. After all, despite the fact that we recognize that people have widely different capabilities, most of us see the rejection of hierarchical, inegalitarian morality among people as moral progress. In a recent study, Jane Bennett (53-55) suggests that Thoreau's love of biodiversity led directly to a rejection of hierarchical morality. Thoreau sees a genuine heroism in the shad's efforts to spawn. It is a great story, but different from human greatness. The shoals of fish do not come armed with lance, or consciousness, or the human sense of personal importance. The shad, the philosopher will tell you, do not act at all, since they do not have conscious purposes. Yet we may watch them migrating up stream or hold one gleaming in our hands, imagine the vast distances they have traveled, and marvel.</page><page sequence="7">22 The Concord Saunterer They truly are "reserved for higher destinies : higher up New England s rivers and streams, to spawn (37). The shad's whole destiny is here on Earth, in this life. The same may be true for us, of course. In Walden, Thoreau will suggest that this is no reason to despair, for "heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads" (283). Thoreau's discussion here shows some of the difficulties of moving beyond an anthropocentric value system. One must steer the course between an uncritical anthropomorphism which gives other beings bogus honorific qualities and a hypercritical reductionism which denies other beings all qualities which we cannot yet detect in them and undervalues those qualities that we do detect. Our ethics should be based on accurate knowledge of the world. Yet perhaps engagement is even more important than accuracy. Thoreau argues that we should work to know nature, however imperfectly, and thus move beyond the "superficial" views with which most people content themselves. Whatever lives of excellence—or mere complexity and strangeness—fish and other non-human beings can achieve, humans alone can fully appreciate them. We should do so, Thoreau says, for their sakes and ours. For if the Billerica dam and similar developments unjustly obstruct fish, they may also ruin the fishing and limit possibilities for future human knowledge, for poetry, and for fulfilling contact with wild nature. "Thou shalt ere long have thy way up the rivers, Thoreau cries: up all the rivers of the globe, if I am not mistaken. Yea, even thy dull watery dream shall be more than realized. If it were not so, but thou wert to be overlooked at first and at last, then would I not take their heaven. Yes, I say so, who think I know better than thou canst. (37-38) Was this the passage that jerked James Russell Lowell out of his boat, rather than the long description of the Concord River's fish species or Thoreau's other digressions? Certainly it bears a marked resemblance to the passage Lowell, as editor of the Atlantic Monthly, later censored in "Chesuncook": "It [a pine tree] is as immortal as I am, and perchance will go to as high a heaven, there to tower above me still" (the quarrel is recounted in Harding 392-95, which also quotes Thoreau's unanswered letter of protest to Lowell). It is ironic that Lowell fastened so thoroughly, early and late, on Thoreau's derivativeness in condemning his literary achievements, given his own public suppression of Thoreau's nonanthropocentrism, one of the more striking and original aspects of Thoreau's work. Here was certainly one area where Thoreau pushed far ahead of his mentor Emerson. Here was a realm where, as he said, he looked toward the West and the wild, while Lowell and most of his civilized readers remained committed to the conventional anthropocentrism espoused on both sides of the Atlantic.</page><page sequence="8">Phillip Cafaro 23 Higher Laws Walden represents a more searching, sustained attempt to specify a non anthropocentric ethics. Thoreau there repeatedly asserts the intrinsic value of nonhuman nature—whether in woodchucks, trees, or Walden Pond itself—and tries to justify those assertions. But Walden also discusses the benefits to people of recognizing nature's value and living accordingly. The chapter "Higher Laws" develops a detailed and sweeping critique of hunting, fishing and meat-eating generally. As in A Week, Thoreau's wordplay identifies a key issue: No humane being, past the thoughtless age of boyhood, will wantonly murder any creature, which holds its life by the same tenure that he does. The hare in its extremity cries like a child. I warn you, mothers, that my sympathies do not always make the usual phil-anthropic distinctions. (212, emphasis in the original) The "usual distinctions," of course, are between human suffering and the suffering of other sentient beings, which we discount, and between the ending of a human and a non-human life. Here Thoreau equates a true humanity with greater sympathy for all nature's creatures and with a deep appreciation of their existence. If causing unnecessary suffering is prima facie wrong, then we should avoid killing animals, since we arguably get no important benefits from killing them, or at least no benefits which outweigh their suffering. Similarly, if ending a life unnecessarily is prima facie wrong, then for the same reasons we should avoid killing animals. Contemporary briefs against meat-eating, such as Peter Singer's animal welfare arguments or Tom Regan's animal rights arguments, can get quite complicated. The precise nature of animals, the degree to which their experience resembles human experience (particularly different species' varied capacities to suffer), the demands of reason and consistency, the exact wording of general ethical principles, are all debated in sophisticated philosophical terms. Thoreau instead appeals directly to experience: It may be vain to ask why the imagination will not be reconciled to flesh and fat. I am satisfied that it is not. Is it not a reproach that man is a carnivorous animal? True, he can and does live, in great measure, by preying on other animals; but this is a miserable way,—as any one who will go to snaring rabbits, or slaughtering lambs, may learn. (216)</page><page sequence="9">24 The Concord Saunterer Such activities are literally miserable—they cause terror, pain and suffering—and we can see this if we look. Here we see Thoreau's ethical method: simplify your life and pay careful attention to your experience to know the effects of your actions. If we do this, he believes, we will be much more likely to see what is right or wrong. At the very least, we will better understand the trade-offs our actions necessitate, for ourselves and others, and whether our actions conform to our principles. There is a lot to be said for this method. No argument one might give about general ethical principles and the nature of pigs or chickens could take the place of actually visiting a modern swine or poultry breeding facility and seeing how the animals are kept. Thoreau's phrase "it may be vain to ask" perhaps suggests some skepticism about reason's ability to fully answer our ethical questions. Alternatively, it might show Thoreau's faith in our ethical intuitions. Either of these reasons, or both, may help explain why Thoreau does not develop detailed philosophical arguments here. Another reason is Walden's general focus on personal excellence, rather than on our duties to others. In line with this, Thoreau argues against meat-eating by discussing its effects on individuals' happiness and personal development. Meat eating is expensive, he asserts, and also filthy. It is much easier to clean up after a vegetarian meal (214). Carnivory thus wastes time and resources. Once again, an appeal to experience is key: "Having been my own butcher and scullion and cook, as well as the gentleman for whom the dishes were served up, I can speak from an unusually complete experience" (214). True, fishing and hunting do serve to introduce many children to the woods, furthering an interest in nature they might not otherwise develop. For this reason, these are good activities for youth: "We cannot but pity the boy who has never fired a gun; he is no more humane, while his education has been sadly neglected . . . . Such is oftenest the young man's introduction to the forest, and the most original part of himself' (212). But our knowledge and acquaintance with nature's creatures should deepen over time. By directly participating in killing, a boy comes to understand what killing is. This allows him, for the first time, to act humanely, by consciously deciding not to kill. And by the time he does this, he has better reasons to be in the woods. The hunter, Thoreau believes, should evolve into a poet or naturalist and put aside his gun (213). Experience also teaches us that meat-eating is not necessary. It isn't necessary for health, because we can sustain an active, healthy life on a vegetarian diet (9). It isn't necessary for dietary variety, because we can do without such variety; indeed, gourmandising takes us away from life's more important goals. Here Thoreau segues into the more general theme that limiting and disciplining our appetites rather than giving in to them is conducive to the higher human pursuits: I believe that every man who has ever been earnest to preserve his higher or poetic faculties in the best condition has been particularly inclined to abstain from animal food, and from much</page><page sequence="10">Phillip Cafaro 25 food of any kind ... The gross feeder is a man in the larva state; and there are whole nations in that condition, nations without fancy or imagination, whose vast abdomens betray them. (214-15) Does Thoreau overstate his case here? Not every earnest man or woman has acted thus. Plenty of writers and artists have indulged mightily in sensual pleasures, while still striving to preserve their "higher faculties"—and some few have created great poetry and art into the bargain. Many others have believed that a moderate indulgence in these pleasures, not asceticism, was the proper way to enhance their higher faculties. Thoreau cannot prove either group wrong. Yet just as clearly, "gross feeding" (and even more, hard drinking) has undermined many talented men and women. Furthermore, many of us do fail to explore life's higher or more challenging activities due to our satisfaction with lower ones. We sacrifice the greater to the less. As Americans' waistlines continue to expand and we debate whether to sacrifice some of our most spectacular wilderness areas to oil and gas development, Thoreau's criticism of "nations whose vast abdomens betray them" rings true. In my experience, Thoreau s distrust of bodily pleasures and his asceticism are unpopular with many contemporary readers who are otherwise sympathetic to his ethical views. We are quite a bit farther removed from our Puritan forebears than was Thoreau's generation. Still, Thoreau might be right. If ascetic forbearance does enhance our creative powers, as both Eastern and Western traditions have taught, it might be worth the trade-off in happiness, conventionally defined. Especially if we accept Thoreau's ranking of higher and lower pursuits, and devote ourselves to the former. Similarly, if contempt or indifference to bodily pleasures helps us to live a "life according to principle," as the Stoics, Kant and many other moralists have taught, it might be worth the trade-off in pleasures forsworn. Especially if we accept Thoreau's high valuation of principled action and his analysis of how sensuality and greed often cause us to fall short of it (see "Life Without Principle"). It should be pointed out, though, that we can argue against meat-eating without embracing asceticism. An alternative position, not developed by Thoreau but readily defended, is that we may avoid causing unnecessary suffering by enjoying a varied and nutritious vegetarian diet. When we factor in the health benefits of vegetarianism, both morality and enlightened self-interest may suggest the same conclusion. The more general point is that we may argue for restraining consumption in different areas of our lives from a wide variety of positions concerning what constitutes the good life. Many readers find it easy to reject Thoreau's asceticism, but harder to shrug off his demand that each of us define his or her own enlightened self-interest and act accordingly. But should we eschew carnivory, regardless of our self-interest? Otherwise put: Is vegetarianism "morally required"? As Thoreau suggests, it depends on how we define humane behavior. If we equate a true humanity with sensitivity to others' suffering and a focus on higher human activities, we are unlikely to eat</page><page sequence="11">26 The Concord Saunterer meat. If we equate a true humanity with power over others and our ability to manipulate the world to fulfill our desires, we will eat whatever we want to eat. Once again, the higher we pitch our humanity, the less likely we will be to use that humanity as an excuse to lord it over the rest of creation. A further point: while morality cannot demand complete consistency from us, morality's claims do rest on a general presupposition of consistency. For example, it is inconsistent and therefore wrong for me to say that I may act one way in a particular situation, but that someone else may not act in the same way in exactly the same situation. "Higher Laws" is followed by a chapter titled "Brute Neighbors," in which Thoreau describes the groundhogs, squirrels and blue jays whom he got to know at the pond. They are presented as persons and this animal personality will have to be taken into account when he considers whether to eat them or other animals like them (on the importance of the category "person" in ethics see Kohak). The juxtaposition of these chapters suggests an inconsistency between knowing and loving animals, on the one hand, and eating them, on the other. Similarly, the chapter preceding "Higher Laws," "Baker Farm," recounts Thoreau's lecture to the Irish immigrant John Field on the benefits of low consumption, including vegetarianism, in allowing a poor man ample free time to fish, skylark, and enjoy life. The chapter juxtaposes the encounter with Field with examples of the enticing uses to which Thoreau puts his free time. The bracketing of "Higher Laws" by "Baker Farm" and "Brute Neighbors" is surely deliberate, and meant to supplement the moral arguments for vegetarianism given there. To the demand that we discipline our appetites in the name of higher principles, Thoreau adds considerations from our enlightened self-interest and an implicit appeal to consistency which support the same conclusion. In Higher Laws," Thoreau's discussion of hunting and vegetarianism broadens out into a consideration of some of the most important and vexed issues in general virtue ethics. What attitude should we take toward our appetites? Is reason properly "the slave of the passions" (Hume), their absolute master (Kant), or something in between? How should we balance the pursuit of pleasure, moral commitment, and the other components of a good human life? In "Higher Laws," the logic of Thoreau's argument for vegetarianism—his attempt to nail down its justification and strengthen its moral force—leads finally to a very ascetic, demanding and "moralistic" position. Yet we cannot take this as his final word on these questions. For elsewhere in Walden, Thoreau speaks positively about physical pleasure and a sensual appreciation of the world. He writes that in youth he lived "a purely sensual life" and that "[I] inhabited my body wholly." Elsewhere Thoreau argues against an overly organized or consistent life and for spontaneity and skylarking. "I love a broad margin to my life," he writes. "The natural day is very calm, and will hardly reprove [our] indolence" (111-12). All this suggests that we must look at Walden as a whole in order to understand Thoreau's conception of the good life and the proper roles of pleasure and sensuality within it. It also suggests</page><page sequence="12">Phillip Cafaro 27 that Thoreau is more interested in opening up these key virtue ethics questions and forcing his readers to answer and live their particular answers than he is in providing final answers to the questions themselves. There are ethical dangers in taking too negative a view of our natural appetites, which we can see more clearly if we follow the argument in "Higher Laws" a little further. "I have found repeatedly, of late years, that I cannot fish without falling a little in self-respect," Thoreau writes. "There is unquestionably this instinct in me which belongs to the lower orders of creation" (213-14). Fishing teaches him about fish and the other living things in the pond. It is sometimes an occasion for meditation or poetic vision. Yet the instinct, beneficial in these ways and perfectly natural, is a "lower" one. Similarly, meat-eating is part of our nature; done in moderation, it is pleasurable and does not harm our health. Still, Thoreau asks, "Is it not a reproach that man is a carnivorous animal?" We have ideals which point beyond what feels good to us and we should follow them: "No man ever followed his genius till it misled him. Though the result were bodily weakness, yet perhaps no one can say that the consequences were to be regretted, for these were a life in conformity to higher principles" (216). Faced with natural inclinations that he feels must be overcome, Thoreau decries appetite. This impulse finds its logical end in the hope of totally transcending desire: Who has not sometimes derived an inexpressible satisfaction from his food in which appetite had no share? 1 have been thrilled to think that I owed a mental perception to the commonly gross sense of taste, that I have been inspired through the palate, that some berries which I had eaten on a hill-side had fed my genius. (218) Here we have the familiar idea of a life of pure thought and appreciation which does not partake of the grossly sensual. It involves a desire to make contact with the world with the finer sense of sight, perhaps, but not with touch. As nearly as possible the mind should touch the world, not the body. Thought is good, while appetite is unqualifiedly bad, an inferior (perhaps polluted) form of consciousness: Not that food which entereth into the mouth defileth a man, but the appetite with which it is eaten. It is neither the quality nor the quantity, but the devotion to sensual savors; when that which is eaten is not a viand to sustain our animal, or inspire our spiritual life, but food for the worms that possess us ... . The wonder is how . . . you and 1, can live this slimy beastly life, eating and drinking. (218) Precisely here is where Thoreau goes wrong, I think. Rejecting our own animal nature as "slimy and beastly" undermines attempts to locate intrinsic value</page><page sequence="13">28 The Concord Saunterer in the beasts. And saying that "the food that entereth in is not the point undermines arguments against meat-eating based on animals' own intrinsic value. This overemphasizes the importance of our own purity versus the welfare of other beings and overemphasizes mental states at the expense of physical realities. Here, arguably, appetite should be disciplined in the name of morality, and the effects of our actions on us should take a back seat to considerations of their effects on others. Thoreau goes wrong here too in denying his sensual side, simply because it can lead him astray. This is an old mistake of philosophers, who often forget that reason can also lead us astray. Against such views we must remember first that it is possible to step back from desire and pleasure by making a reasonable place for them within our lives. Our sensuality need not lead us astray, even though it sometimes does. Second, the senses are also means to knowledge, working together with reason to teach us about nature. So an extreme anti-sensualism will likely cohere badly with an environmental ethics which seeks to connect with nature. And third, sensual enjoyment is part of living a full and happy human life. Thoreau elsewhere acknowledges this while picking huckleberries, for example, or swimming in the pond, or enjoying his rest at the end of a long day hoeing beans. Thoreau is right to argue against gross sensuality and gluttony and right to ask us to step back from our desires and moderate our appetites where appropriate. But we must not dilute moral arguments by making our appetites, and not the things affected by them, the sole objects of our concern. And we must remember that our nature is partly a physical nature which is not intrinsically evil and which generates reasonable claims to use and enjoy the Earth. Like the mythical Antaeus, we too decline when we fail to touch our mother the Earth not just with our minds, but with our bodies (155). A position which recognizes these points will avoid the implausible otherworldliness and dangerous solipsism of Thoreau's more extreme denials of physical desire and appetite. It is also more likely to win converts to environmental ethics.3 The Bean-Field The chapter "The Bean-Field" moves beyond a concern to avoid directly killing individual animals to a concern for preserving their habitat and the wild landscape generally: in contemporary terms, from an animal rights ethics to a true environmental ethics. In order to earn some needed cash, Thoreau planted two and a half acres of Emerson's lot to beans. "This was my curious labor all summer," he writes: "to make this portion of the earth's surface, which had yielded only cinquefoil, blackberries, johnswort, and the like, before, sweet wild fruits and pleasant flowers, produce instead this pulse" (155). Once again, as in "Higher Laws," simplification and attentiveness to his experience allow Thoreau to see ethical issues where others might see only questions of economic expediency. For</page><page sequence="14">Phillip Cafaro 29 he knows this landscape well, as a locus of beauty and value independent of his own uses. This complicates things. "What shall I learn of beans or beans of me?" Thoreau continues (it was his curious labor all summer). For one thing, he learns the farmer's and gardener's common experience of dividing the world up morally based on its utility for whatever he is trying to grow: My auxiliaries are the dews and rains which water this dry soil, and what fertility is in the soil itself, which for the most part is lean and effete. My enemies are worms, cool days, and most of all woodchucks. The last have nibbled for me a quarter of an acre clean. But what right had I to oust johnswort and the rest, and break up their ancient herb garden? (155) Just as "Higher Laws" begins with an anecdote about killing and eating a woodchuck, the first paragraph of "The Bean-Field" begins with a conflict with woodchuck "enemies." The chapter's point becomes clearer when we realize that Thoreau takes this "rights" question seriously—he believes that a woodchuck and a person can each have rights—and that he attempts to answer the question over the course of the chapter. What justifies appropriating part of the landscape and displacing other intrinsically valuable beings? Perhaps the only convincing answer, once we have fully awakened to the moral issue, is necessity. Thoreau suggests this answer (and the Bible's well-known story of how this necessity came about) when he asks, early on: "But why should I raise them?" and immediately responds: "Only Heaven knows" (155). It is simply our human lot here on Earth. Thoreau must "produce this pulse" if he is to keep his own pulse going. We also are intrinsically valuable beings, and we need to eat to live. This justifies some displacement of nature, which can be minimized by taking only what we need. For those who feel the force of nature's intrinsic value, this is the most important part of a responsible answer. Take what you need, but only what you need. Live simply, so that non-human others may simply live. Ecologists and conservation biologists have begun to quantify the price that other living beings pay for human consumption. According to one calculation, "humans now control 40 percent of the planet's land-based primary net productivity, that is, the basic plant growth that captures the energy on which everything else depends" (Vitousek 368). The directness of Thoreau's situation—clearing land to plant a crop, trapping out woodchucks he knew personally in order to protect his beans—forced him to confront the issue starkly. By fronting the problem on his own sacred ground, he was more likely to come up with a generous answer. And by attending to his own experience and distinguishing true needs from superfluous wants, he was able to answer generously.</page><page sequence="15">30 The Concord Saunterer At the same time, even this justification, the strongest we can give for displacing wild nature, cannot disguise the essentially aggressive nature of the whole process. Nor should it. Whatever we do about this, we should at least recognize that violence and displacement are part of what support us. Thoreau describes his labor as "self-respecting," or selfish, as it must be to some extent (155). He is clearly having fun when he writes of engaging in "a long war, not with cranes, but with weeds," but I think the comparison is made only partly in jest (161). Recognizing aggression and displacement is the first step toward limiting their extent and understanding the deeply tragic nature of life on Earth. Both the action and the understanding are part of a mature response. "Only Heaven knows why we must take life in order to live and work our will on the Earth. But if it is natural to do this, it is also natural to put up our hoes sometimes and simply appreciate nature as it is. Working in his little field, Thoreau heard brown thrashers singing in the trees, saw nighthawks circling overhead on sunny afternoons, and disturbed "outlandish'Mooking salamanders from their rocky hiding places. "When I paused to lean on my hoe," he writes, "these sounds and sights I heard and saw any where in the row, a part of the inexhaustible entertainment which the country offers" (159-60). This is the moment, when we pause in our own purposive work, when we can appreciate nature's intrinsic value. This is also the moment when we can recognize the higher uses of nature: those of the poet, the painter, the scientist, or any of the others who put aside economic activity for a time in order to know, create, or experience the world in a richer way. If cultivation leads us to value agricultural improvements and count our yields, pausing in our cultivation may lead to a different sort of accounting and valuation: And, by the way, who estimates the value of the crop which Nature yields in the still wilder fields unimproved by man? The crop of English hay is carefully weighed, the moisture calculated, the silicates and the potash; but in all dells and pond holes in the woods and pastures and swamps grows a rich and various crop only unreaped by man. (158) The answer is that very few people as yet estimate or appreciate wild nature's intrinsic value. We are too busy about our beans. If we can recognize value outside ourselves, we will be more likely to leave some of wild nature alone. Just as important, we will be able to "reap" this wild "crop" which we have hitherto let go to waste through the various methods of higher appreciation modeled for us in Walden. This suggests a further way in which some human appropriation of nature may be justified. We are the only creatures who can understand and celebrate what we see. Through poetry, art, natural history and science, we can be nature's storytellers. We can also consciously choose to allow these stories to continue. Even at work in "The Bean-Field" Thoreau continues to note the plants and animals</page><page sequence="16">Phillip Cafaro 31 around him, and in other chapters they rightly take center stage. This, he suggests, justifies his own presence at Walden Pond. Rather than justifying the unlimited human appropriation of wild nature by appeal to our superior reason, Thoreau indicates that only such higher uses of reason justify its limited appropriation. Reason in service to unnecessary or unlimited consumption is no longer a superior faculty and justifies nothing. Thoreau believes we must move beyond economic abstractions to economic experience to order our personal economy and further our self development and happiness (for Thoreau on economy see Cafaro, "Thoreau and the Place of Economy," and Neufeldt). But such attentiveness also opens up deep issues concerning the meaning of work and the proper relation between our human economy and the economy of nature. Already in the second sentence of "The Bean-field" Thoreau writes: "What was the meaning of this so steady and self respecting, this small Herculean labor, I knew not. I came to love my rows, my beans, though so many more than I wanted. They attached me to the earth, and so I got strength like Antaeus" (155). Walden more than hints that Thoreau often found hoeing beans tedious drudge-work. Yet it also tells us that he came to love his beans and his bean-field, as the hot sun baked it into his head that his strength really did come from nature, both from nature's bounty and from its demands. Here and elsewhere, Thoreau suggests that we too may come to love our work itself rather than the salary it provides us and that this is one key to living a happy life. We too may come to love the land, both for the sustenance it provides, the basis of any strength that we can attain, and for all that it provides that is not specifically for us, including its spontaneous, wild productions. John Locke, in a famous attempt to justity the institution of private property, felt compelled to argue for the relative unimportance of nature's contribution to human wealth and sustenance: I think it will be but a very modest Computation to say, that of the Products of the earth useful to the Life of Man, nine-tenths are the effects of labour, nay, if we will rightly estimate things as they come to our use, and cast up the several Expenses about them, what in them is purely owing to Nature, and what to labour, we shall find, that in most of them ninety-nine hundredths are wholly to be put on the account of labour. (296) This is hardly a 'modest computation, and not just because it casually leaves nature's contribution vague by a factor of ten. But in its reliance on a particularly narrow criterion of use to define value, Locke's statement well reflects standard anthropocentric attitudes in his time and ours. We and our work are all-important.4</page><page sequence="17">32 The Concord Saunterer Thoreau, looking out the door of his shack and across his bean-field on a rainy day, comes to a different conclusion concerning the works of man and nature: While I enjoy the friendship of the seasons I trust that nothing can make life a burden to me. The gentle rain which waters my beans and keeps me in the house to-day is not drear and melancholy, but good for me too. Though it prevents my hoeing them, it is of far more worth than my hoeing. If it should continue so long as to cause the seeds to rot in the ground and destroy the potatoes in the low lands, it would still be good for the grass on the uplands, and, being good for the grass, it would be good for me. (131, emphasis added) As our economic lives become more complex and specialized and our surroundings become more managed and humanized, Locke's attitude comes naturally, while Thoreau's recedes. Environmental ethicists may argue for nature's intrinsic value, but the experiential grounding for that belief fades. But when we eat food from our gardens, gather wood for the evening fire on a camping trip, or pick huckleberries, these actions both confirm the fact and symbolize nature's goodness. We then know ourselves as inextricably dependent on nature, regardless of any calculations concerning relative contributions. From this knowledge should come a feeling of gratitude for the Earth's gifts, Thoreau believes, and a belief in the Tightness of nature's cycles of work and rest, growth and harvest. Finally, there should come happiness and even joy at playing one's part within these cycles: Husbandry was once a sacred art; but it is pursued with irreverent haste and heedlessness by us, our object being to have large farms and large crops merely .... We are wont to forget that the sun looks on our cultivated fields and on the prairies and forests without distinction. They all reflect and absorb his rays alike, and the former make but a small part of the glorious picture which he beholds in his daily course. In his view the earth is all equally cultivated like a garden. Therefore we should receive the benefit of his light and heat with a corresponding trust and magnanimity. What though I value the seed of these beans, and harvest that in the fall of the year? .... These beans have results which are not harvested by me. Do they not grow for woodchucks partly? .... Shall I not rejoice also at the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granary of the birds? (165-66) Such acceptance and rejoicing are rare in our society, Thoreau believes. Yet the hope remains that a genuine gratitude for our lives and sustenance can occur in the</page><page sequence="18">Phillip Cafaro 33 pause from grasping, calculating and desiring. It occurs when we look up from our work and notice a hawk cutting the air or in a simple prayer of thanks before a meal. In such acts Thanksgiving becomes not a once-a-year formality but a remembrance of the goodness and fecundity of our place. We then accept our portion both of work and of the fruits of nature's bounty without striving to alter or engross more than our share. We then appreciate not just our own good fortune, but the blessings given to all nature's creatures. Presenting this vision of a life in place within nature as the fruit of a certain kind of "settlement" and "economy" is one main purpose of Walden. Between Thoreau's view of an intrinsically valuable landscape to be used lovingly and sparingly and a Lockean view of land ownership, with rights but no responsibilities toward the land, there is an unbridgeable gulf. Those holding the former attitude will have little interest in the "improved agriculture" that Thoreau mocks several times in "The Bean-Field" (158,162); this attitude also leads naturally to proposals to protect some of the landscape from direct economic uses. Locke's more aggressive, entrepreneurial attitude finds its natural limit in a view of land solely as economic resource in which we may modify the landscape any way we see fit so as to maximize yields and profits. This purely economic view has been written across hundreds of millions of monocultural acres of America, from the sugarcane fields of Florida and the corn fields of Illinois to the wheat fields of Kansas and the rice fields of California. Walden's only sustained invective is Thoreau's remarkably harsh criticism of such greedy, life-denying land ownership. It comes near the end of the chapter "The Ponds," after Thoreau has described Walden and its surrounding ponds in loving detail: Flint's Pond! Such is the poverty of our nomenclature. What right had the unclean and stupid farmer, whose farm abutted on this sky water, whose shores he has ruthlessly laid bare, to give his name to it? Some skin-flint, who loved better the reflecting surface of a dollar who never saw it, who never bathed in it, who never loved it, who never protected it, who never spoke a good word for it, nor thanked God that he had made it... . who could show no title to it but the deed which a like-minded neighbor or legislature gave him,—him who thought only of its money value; whose presence perchance cursed all the shore .... I respect not his labors, his farm where every thing has its price; who would carry the landscape, who would carry his God, to market, if he could get any thing for him; who goes to market for his god as it is; on whose farm nothing grows free, whose fields bear no crops, whose meadows no flowers, whose trees no fruits, but dollars; who loves not the beauty of his fruits, whose fruits are not ripe for him till they are turned to dollars. (195-96)</page><page sequence="19">34 The Concord Saunterer Mr. Flint was not merely a character in Walaen but a real person, one of Thoreau's neighbors (Harding 123-24). The damage he did to the forests by his pond was real too. In an enterprising America, Walden and the adjacent ponds and woods are threatened by just such destructive ownership, by the failure of Locke's descendants to see and appreciate nature while they show a keen awareness of the land's utilitarian and monetary values. Such examples lead to Thoreau s oracular commandment, 'Enjoy the land, but own it not," which he kept throughout his life (208). But ownership itself is not necessarily the problem. After all, Thoreau squatted on Emerson's acreage at Walden Pond, part of which was bought to protect its forests from the ax. Thoreau also tells us that he considered buying the Hollowell Place, an old, rundown farmstead along the Concord River, in order to forestall any "improvements" to it (82-83). Clearly, ownership can be a means to protect the land. The key is the owner's attitude and his willingness to put nature's beauty and value above monetary gain. Such ownership is better for the land and better for us, Thoreau insists (more than one New England woodlot has been spared the ax or the chainsaw by its owner's fortuitous reading of Walden). As Thoreau sets the scene, neither Walden Pond nor the surrounding woods have yet been irremediably harmed by his own or his neighbors' economic uses. Thoreau's little bean-field itself represents a small, almost insignificant part of the more or less wild landscape adjacent to the pond. His local wood gathering and berrying are even less of a transformative threat than his bean-field.5 This is as it should be, Thoreau believes, for our human economy is but a part of the larger economy of nature. Thoreau shows his respect for this relative balance by setting up a small, benign personal economy in the shadow of life's greater one and by spending as much time studying the latter as sustaining the former. Thoreau's vision is one in which the human economy fits itself to nature's economy rather than vice versa. Both a speculative attitude toward land and wastefulness are equally wrong in such a view. Thoreau castigates the farmer who shears off his woodlot purely for profit; he prefers gathering downed wood or grubbing up stumps to cutting live trees for firewood. Our necessary use of the land should not harm our home. Because we do belong. In Walden, Thoreau emphasizes that he is a native, first by birth, then by conscious choice and genuine effort: When I was four years old, as I well remember, I was brought from Boston to this my native town, through these very woods and this field, to the pond. It is one of the oldest scenes stamped on my memory. And now tonight my flute has waked the echoes over that very water. The pines still stand here older than I; or, if some have fallen, I have cooked my supper with their stumps, and a new growth is rising all around, preparing another aspect for new infant eyes. Almost the same johnswort springs from the same perennial root. (155-56)</page><page sequence="20">Phillip Cafaro 35 Thoreau does not say: I am a native, therefore I have a right to do whatever I choose here at the pond. He does not say: human beings are natural, so any way we treat the rest of nature is acceptable. Rather, he has grasped a valuable, living, more-than-human order, linking individual organisms and stretching across the generations. He will strive to remember this in his economic activities and to fit into the landscape rather than changing it to suit himself. That will mean more work for less yield through not importing fertilizers or hired hands. It will mean resigning a certain number of his beans to the woodchucks. It will mean striving to keep Walden Pond beautiful so that future generations ("new infant eyes") can also enjoy the pond. It will mean taking only what he needs. If he does this, and only if he does this, he may hope that while trees may be cut, new forests will grow up to take their places. He may hope that none of the "original settlers" will be permanently displaced, that "almost the same johnswort" will continue to "spring from the same perennial root." "The Bean-Field" represents something extraordinary in the history of philosophy. While there had been many earlier discussions of vegetarianism and animal welfare in the western ethical tradition, I know of no earlier attempt to set appropriate limits to the human appropriation of wild nature. Nor do I think the deepest of deep ecologists have bettered Thoreau's account of how to act on the recognition of intrinsic value in the non-human world: * Satisfy necessities, avoid luxuries and provide for a modest comfort in life. * Find happiness in knowing, experiencing and being-with nature rather than in consuming, owning or transforming it. * Tell nature's stones to celebrate them and to convince others to allow them to continue. Here is a true environmental ethics which forthrightly asserts values and rights within the non-human world. This goes beyond a concern for individual non-human animals—radical enough, for Thoreau's time—to a concern for endangered species (the shad), for how much of nature's productivity humans have a right to engross (the forests around Walden), and for preserving the wildness of the overall landscape. Even now, sympathetic philosophers are struggling to articulate these concerns within the confines of traditional philosophical perspectives and most philosophers ignore them altogether. Nature's Human Value and the Naturalist s Virtues As I have already shown, Thoreau is a virtue ethicist: particularly in Walden he focuses less on our duties toward others and more on questions of excellence</page><page sequence="21">36 The Concord Saunterer and flourishing. In discoursing on the nature of the good life he often includes an environmental component. Freedom for Thoreau includes not just the absence of physical coercion, but also having the time to explore his surroundings and the privilege to saunter through the local landscape without being arrested for trespassing. He finds great physical pleasure and sensual stimulation in living and working in the woods, comparing his life favorably to the indoor lives of so many of his contemporaries, poor factory girls driven by necessity but also wealthy Concord burghers who are free to live otherwise. He reports that dwelling apart from people awakened him to possibilities for friendship and connection to the rest of nature. Thoreau makes it clear that he is not setting up rules that all must follow. But his experiment by the pond suggests possibilities for living well in nature and what we may give up by living a more urbanized existence. So we can say that Walden propounds an environmental virtue ethics, which specifies human flourishing and excellence in relation to nature (see Cafaro, "Thoreau, Leopold, and Carson," and van Wensveen for recent philosophical discussions of environmental virtue ethics). Some of this is quite basic. The simplest messages in Walden are to get outside, use our limbs and delight in our senses. Run, walk, swim, sweat. Taste the sweetness of the year's first huckleberries and feel the juice dribble down your chin. It feels good to plunge into a pond first thing in the morning and WAKE UP, or to float lazily in a boat along its surface, wafted we know not where by the breeze, looking up at the clouds. It feels good to trundle through the snow on a cold winter night and to warm up by a fire. Walden celebrates these simple, sensual experiences in nature (in addition to mining them for literary symbols or knowledge of deeper realities). Now, "get out of the house" and "eat huckleberries" are not very profound messages. But then, who says ethics should be profound? What we need to know in order to live well may indeed by very simple. Certainly what we need to do in order to improve our lives often is. When we take Walden as a whole, a much fuller picture of Thoreau s view of the good life emerges which includes health, freedom, pleasure, friendship, a rich experience, knowledge, reverence, self-culture and personal achievement (Cafaro, "Thoreau's Virtue Ethics," 19). For Thoreau, each of these key components of a good human life depends on a healthy, accessible and partially wild environment. For example, Thoreau takes great pains to show how attentiveness and connection to nature enrich his experience at the pond. This takes effort, of course. In Walden he praises and exhibits the proper virtues of the naturalist: patience, stillness, alertness, physical endurance, keen hearing, keen eyesight, careful observation, precise description, careful measurement, the ability to make fine distinctions. The book includes many examples of attentive description: surveying the pond, describing the varied colors of its water, chronicling the battle of the ants or the returning birds of Spring. Jane Bennett describes "microvisioning," a keen concentration and focus on nature, as one of Thoreau's "techniques of self</page><page sequence="22">Phillip Cafaro 37 fashioning. "To practice microvision upon nature is to transform it into Nature," she writes, "beautiful, sublime, and Wild" (27). Bennett emphasizes how important such attentiveness to nature is to Thoreau's pursuit of personal excellence. Clearly, Thoreau believes that as we cultivate the naturalist s virtues, we deepen and enrich our experience. Greater attentiveness turns a dull, undifferentiated forest into a world of many-storied beauty. Greater knowledge remakes a monotonous grassland into a shifting mosaic with hundreds of plant and dozens of bird species lending interest and life to the landscape. Additionally, one part of a rich experience is diversity of experience, and we should explore wild nature because it provides such different sights and stories from the town. At this late date we are over-civilized, Thoreau believes, turned almost exclusively toward town and away from the woods. But a wise man or woman knows and experiences both and finds diversion in the one after having a surfeit of the other. The pursuit of knowledge is also a key component of the good life for Thoreau, and Walden affirms that self-knowledge, spiritual knowledge, and ethical knowledge all are intimately connected to knowledge of nature. So is historical knowledge. Since raw nature is the matrix from within which civilization has emerged, we improve our understanding of human history when we try to imagine or recreate how Native Americans or early white settlers experienced nature. Thoreau spent many hours poring over accounts of early New England; in Walden, he weaves his story at the pond in with these earlier stories. He seems to feel a moral imperative to relate his own life to those who have come before him. The land is the common bond between them. For Thoreau, it is important to be able to pick out the sites of Indian settlements along the river, spot the trail earlier inhabitants have worn around Walden Pond, or harvest the berries and fish that previous generations relied upon. Finally, Thoreau claims that a close experience of nature leads to clearer thinking. "It would seem as if the very language of our parlors would lose all its nerve and degenerate into parlaver wholly," he writes, "our lives pass at such remoteness from its symbols, and its metaphors and tropes are necessarily so far fetched" (244-45). To bring words back into close contact with nature and our actual, physical experience is to reawaken them and ourselves too to some extent. Thoreau uses this less as a springboard to get at the true meaning of words than to get at new meanings and old, lost meanings and to throw established meanings into question. Think of the importance of "settlement," "cultivation," or even "higher" and "lower" to his ethics. Bringing these ethical metaphors back to earth allows us to feel them more deeply and may open up new meaning in our lives. But it also shows us, as Stanley Cavell puts it, that we are "chanced, but not forced, by language" (67). Somewhat paradoxically, "grounding" our ethical language in natural experience both strengthens its foundation and opens up new possibilities in our lives. Consider in this regard "cultivation," important as self-cultivation or Bildung for Thoreau. To speak of the cultivation of knowledge, virtue and other</page><page sequence="23">38 The Concord Saunterer higher human achievements and qualities alongside the cultivation of potatoes and beans in "The Bean-Field" suggests much. It implies that self-cultivation too may be more a matter of hard, sustained effort than flash and momentary successes and that self-cultivation too may degenerate into drudgery. It hints that we may not always recognize our "proper field" of labor and that gratitude for our opportunities is an appropriate complement to all self-cultivation. Now, the juxtaposition of beans and Bildung does not prove any of these things, but it does suggest them. Many contemporary philosophers believe the best way to clarify our ethical thought is to drop all allusiveness and stick to dull, nonmetaphorical language as much as possible. But such philosophers rarely "inspire" their students as Thoreau has inspired so many over the years. Nor, in my opinion, have they succeeded in clarifying the meaning of our ethical terms, the great desideratum of analytic philosophical ethics. Thoreau has more to tell us about ethical meaning, because his method "fleshes out" the full meaning of our ethical terms and ties them to particular activities and experiences in our lives. What holds true for ethical terms holds for physical, religious and other kinds of terms, as well. Our language is "littered" with dead metaphors. We use dozens of them every day without considering their aptness or what, if they were apt, they would actually convey. Clear thinking involves clarifying these dead, hazy areas of our language. It also involves the perspicuous use and appreciation of symbols, which is also furthered by awareness of our surroundings. Consider, for example, the almost infinite suggestiveness and power of "morning" and "awakening" as symbols for moral renewal (Walden, 88-90). If we attend to our surroundings and the natural world, dead metaphors will spring to life; we will discover new symbols; we will be better able to judge the aptness of symbols and metaphors in different situations. In these ways, we will be able to think better. But this means that the more we experience and the more fully we experience it, the better we will be able to think. When Thoreau writes that "little is to be expected of that day, if it can be called a day, to which we are not awakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudgings of some servitor," the admonition speaks directly to anyone who has ever unwillingly dragged him or herself out of bed to the shrilling of an alarm clock (89). But to appreciate fully "awakening" as a metaphor for moral and personal renewal, you need to have watched a sunrise recently and felt the radiance on your face and the sense of promise in your bones. We experience this more directly and powerfully out in wild nature, far from the sounds of the neighbors. This is not to say that our only important uses of nature are symbolic or metaphorical. In "Brute Neighbors," Thoreau asks: "Why has man just these species of animals for his neighbors; as if nothing but a mouse could have filled this crevice?" (225). His immediate answer—"I suspect Pilpay &amp; Co. [Indian storytellers] have put animals to their best use, for they are all beasts of burden, in a sense, made to carry some portion of our thoughts"—suggests the importance of literary and symbolic uses of nature. But Walden and his career as a whole suggest two other important answers to the question "why has man just these neighbors?"</page><page sequence="24">Phillip Cafaro 39 One is a scientific answer: we have these neighbors so we can study and understand them. We may learn how they behave and why they behave as they do; how they interact with one another; why some species are here rather than others; how their lives are keyed in to nature's larger cycles. The way Thoreau puts the question here—why these particular species? why this species in this particular niche or "crevice"?—suggests his ecological emphasis. As recent scholars have shown, Thoreau's career moved in a more scientific direction during the 1850s, with a particular concern for phenology, forest succession, and other ecological topics (see Walls). His path shows that attentiveness to nature can turn one into a naturalist and finally into a scientist. It also shows that nature is an endless source of fascinating questions to those who explore her. A second important answer to the question why these neighbors? is so that we may treat them as neighbors. Like our human neighbors, they challenge our generosity and hold out the hope of fulfilling relationships. Some come nearer to Thoreau over time, like the mouse living under the floorboards who eventually ate out of his hand. Others keep their distance, like the loon on the pond. Both kinds of connection are good. It is vulgar to insist on proximity when one's neighbor resists it or to equate physical proximity with the goodness of a relationship. Thoreau extends this neighborliness beyond animals to plants—"Instead of calling on some scholar, I paid many a visit to particular trees" (201)—and finally to the woods and the pond itself. One need not anthropomorphize one's neighbors to do this; simply appreciate them for what they are and treat them with respect and restraint. Just as we show our broadmindedness when we befriend people of different classes or races, so too when we recognize "brute neighbors." In both cases, we improve our own lives in doing so. The Ponds These themes of love of nature, pursuit of knowledge, personal expression and enriched experience all come together in Walden's central chapter: "The Ponds." The plural title undoubtedly refers to Walden's neighbors—Flint's, Goose and White Ponds—which it also describes. But the title also refers to the many Waldens that Thoreau experiences and describes for us here. We are given the real pond with a certain depth and location, certain species of fish inhabiting it, particular bird species returning at particular times of the year. And we are given various imaginary ponds in the legends of Indians, settlers, Thoreau's contemporaries, and Thoreau himself. We are given the parts of the pond and the individuals who make it up, from frogs and loons to fishermen and ice-cutters. But also the pond as a harmonious whole, each ripple on its surface eventually smoothed out, no matter which unfortunate individual's end it speaks of. We are given the pond in time: a detailed account covering Thoreau's life and the remembrances of older Concordians; an ever more sketchy and hypothetical account extending back through white settlement into Indian times and beyond, into frank speculation and mythology.</page><page sequence="25">40 The Concord Saunterer And we are given a timeless Walden, symbol ot nature s beauty, purity and inexhaustible fecundity. "The Pond in Winter" (perhaps not accidentally Walden's most abstract, analytical chapter), in "Spring" and indeed in all seasons. The pond as phenomena (recall the brilliant description of the varied colors of its water) and as thing-in-itself (or as near to this as Thoreau can get: how near is yet another philosophical puzzle the pond puts to him). The pond as described by the poet, the aesthete, and the scientist; the fisherman, the hunter, and the ice-skater; the visitor and the resident; the ascetic, the sensualist and the home economist. It is because the pond can be all these things to Thoreau that it is so important to him. At the same time, if it were simply the scene of his own artistry and had no independent existence, it would be much less important to him than it was. It is his recognition of this independent existence and his sustained efforts to know and appreciate it that set Thoreau apart from the next half-century's flowery "nature fakers" on the one hand and our own anemic post-modern literati on the other. His commitment to pursuing Truth about Reality grounds a genuine love of nature. Thoreau's journal recounts again and again his desire for a personal, fulfilling relationship with nature (see, for example, the entries for 6 May 1851, 12-16July 1852, and 8 November 1858). Walden documents his success in attaining it. "I experienced sometimes," he writes, "that the most sweet and tender, the most innocent and encouraging society may be found in any natural object" (131). Such personal, friendly, gentle acquaintance sustains him through his solitary days at the pond. "The poet," he had written years earlier, "is that one especially who speaks civilly to Nature as a second person" (Journal 1, 338, 30 November 1841). At Walden, this personal affection and acquaintance broadens to include the river, the forests and fields, and the landscape generally. "The Ponds" gives Thoreau's respectful, loving, imaginative yet accurate description of Walden Pond, the second most fully developed character in Walden. Despite the many views taken and the variety of inhabitants described, Walden is portrayed as a coherent, harmonious whole, and repeatedly personified. The central moment in the chapter is Thoreau's thrilled assertion of this personality, its goodness, his personal relationship to it, and finally his merging with it: Of all the characters I have known, perhaps Walden wears best, and best preserves its purity .... It is perennially young, and I may stand and see a swallow dip apparently to pick an insect from its surface as of yore. It struck me again to-night, as if I had not seen it almost daily for more than twenty years,—Why, here is Walden, the same woodland lake that I discovered so many years ago; where a forest was cut down last winter another is springing up by its shore as lustily as ever; the same thought is</page><page sequence="26">Phillip Cafaro 41 welling up to its surface that was then; it is the same liquid joy and happiness to itself and its Maker, ay, and it may be to me. It is the work of a brave man surely, in whom there was no guile! He rounded this water with his hand, deepened and clarified it in his thought, and in his will bequeathed it to Concord. I see by its face that it is visited by the same reflection; and I can almost say, Walden, is it you? (192-93) He may almost use the second person singular to address Walden. Why "almost"? First, because as a naturalist he must love accurately, and a pond is not a unity or a person in the same sense as a human being or a woodchuck. Thoreau, observing the complex interconnections between its individual inhabitants and the creative force "welling up" within it creating these individuals, sees an ecological unity. His personification does justice to this insight and to the beauty he sees and the affection he feels. Yet insofar as the pond as an entity is less unified or integrated than an individual organism or less singularly directed in its purposes than a conscious actor, its personification is misleading. If Thoreau wants to love it then he must take this into account. Overly insistent personification manifests either ignorance or a failure to appreciate the pond for what it really is. Second, because as a true lover Thoreau recognizes the power and the elusiveness of the lovingly spoken "you." We may describe a pond or a person in any degree of detail we choose, but the loving "you" moves beyond such descriptions. It is a personal act. Speaking this loving "you" is never merely an accurate description of our feelings for the beloved, or this combined with an accurate description of her various qualities. Rather it involves an affirmation of her value and a taking on of responsibility for her. It is not something to be said lightly. The beauty of the beloved may call forth an effortless affirmation of our love. But to love well takes effort. Perhaps, then, Thoreau also means to say that he will not rest in a facile adoration of the pond and its myriad productions but will continue to work to know them and publish their glories. Third, Thoreau hesitates to say "you," because when we love truly, we love the beloved herself and not our own vision of her. The passage is followed and completed by this short poem: It is no dream of mine, To ornament a line; Than I live to Walden even. I am its stony shore, And the breeze that passes o er; In the hollow of my hand Are its water and its sand, And its deepest resort I cannot come nearer to God and Heaven Lies high in my thought.</page><page sequence="27">42 The Concord Saunterer For all their lyricism, this poem and the preceding passage suggest skepticism concerning the extent to which we can truly know the beloved. The surface of the pond is "visited by the same reflection" as the writer; is this Thoreau's own face reflected in the water? He might wonder to what extent his "reflections" on the nature of the pond are in fact projections of his own interests and desires onto it. Thoreau has visited Walden nearly every day since he was a child, but the many stories of his own he now associates with it may prevent him from seeing it and appreciating its stories. Hesitation here marks an acceptance that our knowledge of the beloved is never complete or perfect, hence never does her full justice, hence can never take her place. Unless of course we are in love with love, like Agathon in Plato's Symposium (194E-201C), and more concerned to cultivate our own romantic feelings than to know and do right by our beloved. These are the inehminable dangers of love. They all come down, in one way or another, to putting ourselves above the beloved. The great danger for the lover of nature is that he will put his own systems and creations above her. The greater his success—in understanding nature or creating new symbolic worlds which move beyond her—the greater the temptation to do so. In the prose passage above, the imagined "Maker" of the pond, who may be God or a logos within nature, is mirrored in the companion poem by Thoreau himself, the author of Walden. Both authors "deepen and clarify" the pond "in thought" and "bequeath it to Concord," making it available to Thoreau's neighbors and readers. This juxtaposition proclaims Thoreau's god-like accomplishment. Recall Walden's preface, where Thoreau states his intention to "brag lustily" of his accomplishments. Knowledge of nature and nature's representation in a work such as Walden are divine—true second creations. Three facts take the sting out of this presumptuous bragging and the anthropocentrism to which it might lead. First, Thoreau backs it up. He really does know Walden Pond and does create a great literary work. Second, as he says elsewhere, he is not bragging for himself but for humanity and in order to wake his neighbors up. These are possibilities for all of us, which we should actualize and celebrate. Third, and by far the most important, Thoreau believes that the representation of nature may be great because nature herself is great. The key words in the poem are: It is no dream of mine To ornament a line. Walden Pond is not the creation of his own fancy, but a glorious reality. This is the source of his own greatness, Thoreau says, even as he insists on that greatness. Thoreau places these two lines at the heart of the heart of Walden, because we are perpetually forgetting them and taking our own physical artifacts and mental constructions for the whole of reality. In a similar way, the plural title "The Ponds"</page><page sequence="28">Phillip Cafaro 43 reminds us that we necessarily have two ponds: the pond in the Earth and the pond in the book. Each of these fragment in their turn. The complex ecological system of the pond is imperfectly integrated; has uncertain, shifting, and overlapping boundaries; is the loci for many individual "personalities." The writer, strictly speaking, can never tell us the story of the pond, but only stories. New experiences and new experiencers create further stories, adding to the storied character of nature. The trick is to embrace this pluralism while remaining committed to the pursuit of truth and goodness. Thoreau's position here is based on two axioms. First, that he does know Walden Pond, although that knowledge is incomplete. Second, that its stories are good ones which should be told and allowed to continue. Thoreau hesitates before saying "you" to Walden. But he does say it. He thus enriches his own life and (he may hope) helps preserve Walden's. In getting to know Walden, Thoreau has delved deeper into himself and swum further out into the great stream of life; articulated inchoate ideals and found his own voice; and learned something of natural and human history and of his own place within them. Thoreau's whole life—from his never-to-be-forgotten childhood exaltations to his mature artistic, scientific and philosophical achievements—is thus intimately tied to Walden Pond and its environs. His goodness, such as it is, must be a function of its goodness. He went to the pond to pursue self-development and artistic achievement, but when he came to write a book about his experience he titled it Walden, not/, Henry or A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Naturalist. In an environmental virtue ethics, human excellence and nature's excellence are necessarily entwined.6 Challenges Walden provides an inspiring account of one person living well in nature. It argues that we will be better, happier people if we take the time to know and enjoy nature. The many activities through which we do this will give our lives diversity and interest; performing them will help us develop virtues we might not otherwise develop. In these ways Walden suggests the rudiments of an environmental virtue ethics which is noble and challenging and which makes room for the rest of creation. There are two main challenges to such an environmental virtue ethics. First, there are those popular ideals which define happiness in terms of increased wealth and economic consumption. Modern life (and especially modern advertising) provide a variety of such ideals, from the crude to the refined. Here a Thoreauvian response is clear: a satisfactory conception of human well-being extends beyond economic consumption and gross physical pleasure to encompass nobler human activities. If we value such higher activities, we must limit those economic activities which undermine them, whether they do so by taking over our lives or by harming that environment which makes human endeavor possible.</page><page sequence="29">44 The Concord Saunterer In "Economy, Thoreau likens the provision of economic necessities to stoking a furnace and asks his readers: When a man is warmed by the several modes which I have described, what does he want next? Surely not more warmth of the same kind, as more and richer food, larger and more splendid houses, finer and more abundant clothing, more numerous incessant and hotter fires, and the like. When he has obtained those things which are necessary to life, there is another alternative than to obtain the superfluities; and that is, to adventure on life now, his vacation from humbler toil having commenced. The soil, it appears, is suited to the seed, for it has sent its radicle downward, and it may now send its shoot upward also with confidence. Why has man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth, but that he may rise in the same proportion into the heavens above? (15) This may sound grandiose, but the question is: do you believe it? If not: what do you believe instead? All our other ethical judgments depend upon our answers here, all our calculations of profit and loss and of lives well-spent or ill-spent. We need not follow Thoreau so far as to see merely an instrumental value in "stoking the furnace." We may believe that pleasure is a necessary part of a good human life and still agree that achievements such as raising healthy children, learning about nature, or building careers which support us and are genuinely useful to society, are also important. These are the things for which we strive and on which serious people judge the success of their lives. Our economic lives and our environmental policies should support these goals. This is not necessarily to put on a hair shirt. To the extent that wealth, possessions or economic consumption further our true goals and accord with justice, they should be pursued. But no further. For "there is no more fatal blunderer than he who consumes the greater part of his life getting his living" (Reform Papers, 160). Thoreau s criticisms of gluttony and acquisitiveness are very much in the ancient virtue ethics tradition. As he puts it: "the ancient philosophers, Chinese, Hindoo, Persian, and Greek, were a class than which none has been poorer in outward riches, none so rich in inward" (Walden, 14). But these criticisms are also strikingly applicable to modern environmental issues. High levels of consumption deplete resources and generate excessive pollution, harming both wild nature and human beings. Americans' current love affair with gas-hogging SUV's and failure to build mass transit translate directly into more asthma attacks and cases of lung cancer and more wild lands sacrificed for oil and coal extraction. Here as elsewhere, "our vast abdomens betray us." In Thoreau s view, an excessively economic orientation also warps our understanding of the world, literally cutting us off from reality. Farmer Flint cannot</page><page sequence="30">Phillip Cafaro 45 see his namesake pond and the many plants and animals inhabiting it—both because he isn't interested and because the pond and its inhabitants are so vividly apparent to him as resources to be used or sold. A wild goose may be a tasty meal in the oven but not an animal with its own interesting habits or history, or a link with distant lands, or a symbol of spring. A wet meadow may be appreciated as the scene of two rich hay crops per year, but not as the site of dozens of plant species different from the adjacent uplands or of interesting patterns of ecological succession. Flint does not know these stories and thus he cannot "interweave the thread of the pond's history with his own" (196). The idea wouldn't even occur to him. Rather he changes, or would change, the pond in any way that might prove profitable, wrenching its story abruptly out of past natural and cultural history, ending the stories of "old settlers" who do not fit his selfish economic regime. "The Ponds'" juxtaposition of farmer Flint with naturalist Thoreau suggests a radical choice in how we will relate to nature. By focusing on the gross consumptive uses of nature, we miss out on the higher uses to which it can be put. By focusing on the landscape's monetary value, we miss out on the many other values it may exhibit or provide: aesthetic, spiritual, scientific, historical. Of course, Thoreau does not deny such monetary or consumptive values, any more than he seeks to avoid economic life itself. We need to use nature, and in our time as in Thoreau's we cannot completely avoid a monetary perspective. The point is to put economics in its proper, subordinate place, in our lives and on the landscape. If we do so, our economic activities may even teach us much about nature, as hoeing beans and building his cabin taught Thoreau. Thoreau revisits these themes in his late piece "Huckleberries," where the marketing of berries is contrasted with an appreciation of their beauty, knowledge of their natural and cultural history, generosity in dividing them up, and gratitude for their abundance. "Huckleberries" works to specify the correct mix between scientific and experiential knowledge, and between knowledge of nature and its appreciation and celebration. It tries to show exactly how the bloom is rubbed off wild nature as "the cart goes to market" and to stick up for those experiences and attitudes toward nature which a market-oriented society is in danger of forgetting. While Thoreau in "Huckleberries" is as leery as in Walden of money-love, he seems to take a more positive view of appetite and at least some kinds of consumption, especially compared to the discussion in "Higher Laws." Approached rightly, consumption may be an important avenue for knowledge and pleasant experience. Like Walden, "Huckleberries" tries to specify a good economics— healthy and uplifting for us, relatively benign in its effects on nature. Such proper economy must be a part of any convincing environmental virtue ethics. We might call the second main challenge to an environmental virtue ethics the "artificial alternatives" challenge. A skeptic might argue that most if not all of what Thoreau finds in wild nature may also be found in the developed human environment, thus that we need not preserve or explore wild nature. For example,</page><page sequence="31">46 The Concord Saunterer a modern suburbanite can get his exercise by swimming at a health club or jogging around his neighborhood. He can improve his observational and descriptive abilities by painting still-lives or studying architecture. Finally, the critic might say, human beings are themselves interesting and diverse, and we should learn and celebrate this diversity. Not only can we develop "the naturalist's" virtues without wild nature, but Thoreau and his modern followers may cut themselves off from essential human contact, fail to cultivate the social virtues, and foreclose important avenues for knowledge and happiness. In answering this challenge, we must first admit that cultivating good personal relationships and appreciating human creativity are indeed essential to our happiness and that any ways we get exercise, uncover diversity, or hone our powers of observation, description and analysis are better than nothing. Still, failing to know and experience wild nature is a genuine loss, just as a complete insensibility to the history and diversity of human cultures and humanized places would be. The wild is essentially different from the tame. A person who does not experience and understand something of wild nature misses out on much of what this world has to offer, just as a person who never travels or only has friends of one sex misses out. But perhaps the wilderness ignoramus loses more than these others, because wild nature is so different from human culture and because it is the crucible from which culture has emerged. To know nothing of wild nature is thus necessarily to fail to properly contextualize our own lives. Hasty readers sometimes assert that Walden advocates a complete withdrawal from human society or the absolute superiority of nature over culture. But Thoreau's acts of settlement, the volumes of Homer, Plato and Darwin by his bedside, and his return to the village at the end of his stay at the pond all point to a different conclusion. Thoreau hopes that nature and culture may complement one another. He believes that the richest human life extracts from each sphere the best of what it offers. "In one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the river meadows; under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other horizon was a village of busy men," he says (167). Both are interesting and have much to teach us; both deserve to be allowed to flourish in their own ways. Thoreau's house is in between, emphasizing a necessary distance from both. If he sometimes experiences a mystic merging with nature or "resolves himself into the essence of things" (224), he also speaks of the conscious subject's "coming and going" with "a strange liberty in nature," a part of and yet apart from it (129). Knowledge—whether scientific or experiential—depends upon this distance. So does creativity—be it the creation of a book or a farmstead. Something similar applies in our relations with other people. To genuinely converse implies a certain distance; to have thoughts worth sharing with others implies hard work in solitude (140-41). What does wild nature specifically have to offer that the human world does not? A larger context in which to put our own lives, or to call them into question. New forms of beauty, mostly unseen and unappreciated by human beings.</page><page sequence="32">Phillip Cafaro 47 New stones and new kinds of stories, in which consciousness and individual control play a smaller part. Salutary reminders of our own unimportance (you will not break through the ice or get drenched by an unexpected thunderstorm at the mall). The revitalization of dead words, symbols and doctrines. A sense of hope when our fellow human beings disappoint us. In Walden and in his latter writings, Thoreau returns to these points repeatedly. Just as "Huckleberries" revisits important economic issues, the late essay "Walking" reiterates Walden's claims about the importance of engaging with wild nature. Economy and the Wild are such central concepts for Thoreau that his whole ethical philosophy can be presented through the lens of either. In the end those who seek to protect wild nature do so as much for their own sakes as for Nature's: Our village life would stagnate if it were not for the unexplored forests and meadows which surround it. We need the tonic of wildness,—to wade sometimes in marshes where the bitterns and the meadow-hen lurk ... and the mink crawls with its belly close to the ground. At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable . . . We need to witness our own limits transgressed, and some life pasturing freely where we never wander. (317-18) This passage captures the deep paradoxes involved in our attempts to know and experience the wild (can we "witness ... where we never wander"? study nature without changing it? move beyond our own concepts and categories to understand things-in-themselves?). But it also asserts the crucial possibilities that we can draw back and limit our effects on the natural world and that we can know its stories, rather than just projecting our own stories onto it. Some critics of Walden—and of modern wilderness preservation efforts— assert that such judgments depend on specifying a single, sharp distinction between wild and civilized landscapes. Walden instead develops a nuanced understanding of this ambiguous yet necessary distinction, as in Thoreau's description of his "half civilized" bean field (158) or in the repeated juxtaposition of the wild and the tame in the chapter "Sounds." Similarly, critics often present a stark dichotomy: either we preserve the whole landscape completely with no human modification or we use it in any way we see fit (the "do you want us all to live in caves?" argument). Thoreau instead suggests a flexible and contextual way of relating to a diversity of landscapes. He does argue for fully preserving parts of the remote Maine woods as unmanaged wilderness (see next section). But he also advocates protecting semi-wild areas closer to home, and an important part of his experiment at the pond involves using the land while minimizing his displacement of wild nature. In</page><page sequence="33">48 The Concord Saunterer short, Thoreau's personal ethics, translated into a political agenda, implies both preservation of wild nature and (genuinely) wise use of natural resources. It is eminently practical. The proper mix of wudness and culture in an individual or on a landscape are complex questions. One reason to keep some forests uncut and rivers running free is to make sure that the questions themselves do not disappear, as they have for many human beings and many regions of the Earth. We may be comfortable in our villages, but there may be an excess of comfort. We need the physical and intellectual challenges that wild nature sets us. Nature may speak to us piano in individual flowers or birds, non-human beings who challenge us to know and appreciate them. Or she may thunder fortissimo with displays of power and vastness to overwhelm our understanding and destroy our sense of our own importance. Such experiences may lead to love, wonder, horror, awe or reverence—or to the renewed attempt to understand the order which we believe lies behind this complex world. Such challenges to our intelligence, generosity and imagination strengthen them. Wild nature has been the source of great human achievements in science, poetry, religion and philosophy. I share Thoreau's doubts that these highest human activities can thrive in its absence. Conservation Walden says little about political issues, arguing correctly that self improvement cannot wait for the world to improve. Ethics is not politics. However, any ethical philosophy implies a political philosophy and Thoreau's virtue ethics does entail certain positions regarding proper relations with other people and the proper stewardship of nature. Here I restrict myself to considering the latter issue— not because the former is unimportant but because a full consideration of Thoreau's political philosophy lies beyond the scope of this essay. By Thoreau s time, little had been done in conservation in the United States beyond some ineffective and haphazardly enforced state rules regulating hunting and fishing. National legislation to limit pollution, set aside land for wildlife or to support any other now recognized environmental goals was nonexistent. Rules at any level of government to prevent dumping toxic chemicals in rivers or to protect the lungs and limbs of factory workers were many decades in the future. Thoreau's journal entries and published writings show an interest in many environmental issues, as John Broderick has documented in his article "Thoreau's Proposals for Legislation." For example, a trip along New Hampshire's dusty, unshaded roads led to the suggestion that states landscape their highways and provide roadside parks for the comfort of travellers. Several deaths at railroad crossings prompted him to propose state regulation (Broderick 285-90). An explosion at a nearby powder mill moved him to meditate on ways to make mills safer and references to the stultifying and disease-causing aspects of factories are found both in Walden and in the journal.</page><page sequence="34">Phillip Cafaro 49 However, Thoreau's greatest environmental concern was undoubtedly the protection of wild nature. He was an early, passionate voice for the conservation of native species and the preservation of wild landscapes. In "Huckleberries" he writes: What are the natural features which make a township handsome — and worth going far to dwell in? A river with its water-falls — meadows, lakes — hills, cliffs or individual rocks, a forest and single ancient trees — such things are beautiful. They have a high use which dollars and cents never represent. If the inhabitants of a town were wise they would seek to preserve these things though at a considerable expense. For such things educate far more than any hired teachers or preachers, or any at present recognized system of school education. (Natural History Essays, 253) As in Walden, Thoreau goes on to speak of the role landscape can play in making human history come alive, the fascination and beauty to be found in studying flowers and wild animals, and the simple fun of cross-lot walks and berry-picking parties. "I [can] think of no natural feature which is a greater ornament and treasure to [Concord] than the river," he continues, yet the town foolishly "has done nothing to preserve its natural beauty" or its citizens' access to it. Over the next hundred and fifty years, many cities and towns have realized the wisdom of Thoreau's emphasis on such river conservation and made "greenway" preservation the centerpiece of efforts to maintain livable communities. Thoreau is clear that preserving the river and other natural features demands a public response. "They who laid out the town should have made the river available as a common possession forever," he writes. In the nature of things, private ownership cannot preserve these public goods, since it limits public access and provides no guarantee that the owner will preserve them. As we saw in Walden, Flint's Pond may be destroyed by falling into the hands of Flint. "It is for the very reason that some do not care for these things that we need to combine to protect all from the vandalism of a few." As with the river, so the tops of any commanding hills should be held in common, Thoreau believes; both out of respect for nature and to provide the public continued access to "wider views" of things. "Think of a mountain top in the township—even to the Indians a sacred place—only accessible through private grounds. A temple as it were which you cannot enter without trespassing—nay the temple itself private property and standing in a man's cow yard." Such areas "should be left unappropriated for modesty and reverence's sake" (Natural History Essays, 255-56). While some areas should remain public in perpetuity, Thoreau also advocated regulating private lands to keep them from becoming degraded. Importantly, he would do this not merely for economic ends but also to preserve</page><page sequence="35">50 The Concord Saunterer beauty, deeming this even more important to human flourishing than preserving secure sources of wood. "It would be worth the while if in each town there were a committee appointed, to see that the beauty of the town receive no detriment," Thoreau writes. "There are a few hopeful signs .... The town does set trees along the highways. But does not the broad landscape itself deserve attention?" (256). While it might be important to preserve remote wilderness and stunning national parks, in "Huckleberries" Thoreau focuses on the need to safeguard wild nature closer to home, in areas accessible to children and busy workers. "I think that each town should have a park, or rather a primitive forest," he writes: "of five hundred or a thousand acres, either in one body or several — where a stick should never be cut for fuel — nor for the navy , nor to make wagons, but stand and decay for higher uses — a common possession forever, for instruction and recreation" (259). Such areas will help preserve the "original settlers" of a township. Perhaps just as important, such reservations could teach a town's inhabitants that not every acre of land should be devoted to economic purposes and that we can "create" beauty and value by leaving things alone—as Thoreau recognized standing in his bean-field. "All Walden wood might have been reserved," Thoreau continues, "with Walden in the midst of it, and the Easterbrooks country, an uncultivated area of some four square miles in the north of the town, might have been our huckleberry field" for common worship and enjoyment rather than personal, pecuniary gain (259-60). Already in Thoreau's time, Emerson had taken the first steps in this direction, buying land along the pond to protect its trees. The next century and a half witnessed more individual efforts, the creation of Walden Pond State Park and Reservation, and Concord and Lincoln township efforts to set aside extensive adjacent woodlands. In our own time, the Walden Woods Project has stopped incompatible development near the pond and attempts are ongoing to close and rehabilitate the Concord town dump. Those working on these projects are Thoreau's true heirs. We may lament that some of these efforts did not come soon enough to protect the area from inappropriate development, or we can pitch in and help further such preservation efforts at Walden Pond and elsewhere. For as Thoreau says in Walden, "to act collectively is according to the spirit of our institutions" (110). It is also the only way to preserve the many public environmental goods on which our happiness depends. In his excellent summary of the subject, John Broderick states that "almost all" of Thoreau's legislative proposals, with their emphasis on conservation and education, may be described as "welfare proposals" aimed at furthering the culture of his fellow citizens. "Even conservation," Broderick asserts: is government activity ultimately in behalf of human welfare, for to Thoreau the final importance of nature is in its effect on man. If we may judge from these references, therefore, Thoreau believed that government did have legitimate functions, and those</page><page sequence="36">Phillip Cafaro 51 tunctions were not dissimilar to those implied in Emerson's statement in "Politics": "the highest end of government is the culture of men." (288-89) This judgment is supported by the justifications Thoreau gives for his legislative suggestions. Since Thoreau was committed to a virtue ethics centered on self culture, it makes sense that his political proposals should build on these well developed, deeply felt ethical beliefs. Broderick s only misstep, I believe, is in making human welfare the sole concern behind Thoreau's conservation suggestions. As we saw earlier, Thoreau's environmental ethics is grounded both in our enlightened self-interest and in the intrinsic value of nature. We cannot isolate the former from the latter, since greater attentiveness to nature, pursued in our enlightened self-interest, necessarily leads to a recognition of nature's intrinsic value. Both motivate Thoreau's legislative suggestions, as shown in passages like the following from the journal: When the question of the protection of birds comes up, the legislatures regard only a low use and never a high use; the best disposed legislators employ one, perchance, only to examine their crops and see how many grubs or cherries they contain, and never to study their dispositions, or the beauty of their plumage, or listen and report on the sweetness of their song. The legislature will preserve a bird professedly not because it is a beautiful creature, but because it is a good scavenger or the like. (Journal, XII, 124-5, 8 April 1859). Note that motivation is important. Legislators should not just protect nature: they should protect nature for the right reasons. Thoreau's main distinction here seems to be between higher and lower uses of nature, and one might argue that this is all that really concerns him. But as the passage continues this possibility is disproved: It is as if the question were whether some celebrated singer of the human race—some Jenny Lind or another—did more harm or good, should be destroyed, or not, and therefore a committee should be appointed, not to listen to her singing at all, but to examine the contents of her stomach and see if she devoured anything which was injurious to the farmers and gardeners, or which they cannot spare. It is not just that the imaginary committee would use mistaken criteria to judge the singer; presumably the very question of whether or not she should be destroyed would be an abomination. It is characteristic of Thoreau to ask us to imagine our hasty judgments about nonhumans as they would apply to people: such comparisons</page><page sequence="37">52 The Concord Saunterer are a standard part of his attack on anthropocentrism. As with our fellow human beings, we should appreciate other animals' full value to us and put them to "higher uses"—while also valuing them for what they are and not harming them unnecessarily in any case. Thoreau's conservation proposals are not grounded in a narrow view of human welfare, but on an expansive view of human welfare and on a comprehensive view of the welfare of the larger world around us. This becomes clearer when we consider the full scope of his proposals for protecting nature. While Thoreau argues for preserving wild nature close to home, he does not make the mistake of assuming that preserving small parks and woodlots will fully preserve wild nature. "No one has yet described for me the difference between that wild forest which occupied our oldest townships, and the tame one which I find there to-day," Thoreau writes in The Maine Woods. "It is a difference which would be worth attending to" for what it tells us of natural and cultural history. Primitive "old-growth" forests have a different structure than regenerated second and third-growth stands, he notes. They are darker and damper. They support a somewhat different understory flora. Some animals cannot survive outside large, relatively undisturbed wilderness areas, while long-settled areas tend to lose much of their native fauna. "Those Maine woods differ essentially from ours," Thoreau concludes (151-52). They are nature's creation, not man's, and fully preserve nature's beauty, diversity and wildness. The Maine woods also give Thoreau a slight case of homesickness and remind him of what he values in Concord's tamer, pastoral landscape. Still, he believes much will be lost if some fully wild areas are not preserved. Just as some species of wild orchids will not survive cultivation and some animals cannot be tamed, so with certain human experiences, artistic moods and achievements: "not only for strength, but for beauty, the poet must, from time to time, travel the logger's path and the Indian's trail, to drink at some new and more bracing fountain of the Muses, far in the recesses of the wilderness" (156). So, we might add, must the natural scientist, the religious seeker or indeed any man or woman who sees art, science or religion as part of their own humanity. For nature's sake and for our own, true wilderness needs to be preserved. Such reflections lead Thoreau to make one of the earliest calls for national parks, and still one of the most stirring: The kings of England formerly had their forests "to hold the king's game," for sport or food, sometimes destroying villages to create or extend them; and I think that they were impelled by a true instinct. Why should not we, who have renounced the king's authority, have our national preserves, where no villages need be destroyed, in which the bear and panther, and some even of the hunter race, may still exist, and not be "civilized off the face of the earth," — our forests, not to hold the king's game</page><page sequence="38">Phillip Cafaro 53 merely, but to hold and preserve the king himself also, the lord of creation, — not for idle sport or food, but for inspiration and our own true recreation? or shall we, like villains, grub them all up, poaching on our own national domains? (156) In Maine, Thoreau says, such a preserve would protect the full complement of native species and keep the land wild. For "these are not the artificial forests of an English king—a royal preserve merely. Here prevail no forest laws, but those of nature" (80). Once again, Thoreau was prescient. In the years following the Civil War, the United States designated Yellowstone and Yosemite as our first two national parks, with many more following in the coming century. In 1964, Congress passed the first Wilderness Act, ensuring that parts of our national parks, national forests and other federal lands remain wild and relatively unmanaged. National parks have proven themselves to be one of America's best and most influential ideas, with the world's nations setting up national parks and wilderness areas on all seven continents. Today, just as the Walden Woods Project works to preserve wild nature close to Thoreau's home, the environmental group RESTORE: The North Woods continues Thoreau's advocacy for New England wilderness. RESTORE proposes the creation of a 3.2 million acre Maine Woods National Preserve, centered on Mount Katahdin and the lakes and rivers Thoreau traversed on his three visits to Maine (you can learn more about their efforts at www.restore.org). Other groups such as the Sierra Club and the Wildlands Project promote similar wilderness preservation and "rewilding" efforts throughout America and the world. In addition to preserving wild areas, Thoreau also calls for a more enlightened management of rural landscapes used to produce fuel, fodder and agricultural crops. Thoreau's late natural history writings draw out some of the management implications of his ecological studies. Farmers commonly shoot squirrels as vermin, he notes in "The Dispersion of Seeds" manuscript, but his observations show that squirrels are helping to plant future forests. They are valuable both to the calculating owner who is saved the trouble of planting his own oak wood and to those who can appreciate nature's economy in its own right. A wood lot owner intent on maximizing profit may do best by "a judicious letting Nature alone," allowing the squirrels and winds to replant, rather than acting in ignorance of the likely effects of his actions. A wood-lot owner with an interest in natural history or with transcendentalist leanings may act with even greater restraint, cutting less or not at all, in deference to these ongoing stories (Faith in a Seed, 128-30, 170-73). Thoreau's discussion of proper forest management in these late pieces is surprisingly hard-headed, accepting that some owners' primary interest is profit. He also discusses the active management of forests in positive terms: "Why not control our own woods and destiny more?" he asks, rather than blundering along in ignorance as we have been (Faith in a Seed, 166). On the other hand, he is still</page><page sequence="39">54 The Concord Saunterer convinced that beauty is the most valuable crop that human beings can take from a forest, although it is largely unreaped. He wants to leave some areas wild and unmanaged, for "life consists with wildness... Not yet subdued to man, its presence refreshes him" ("Walking," Natural History Essays, 114). And he would not countenance a radical simplification of the landscape in order to increase productivity: nature creates diversity and human beings thrive on it (Faith in a Seed, 131). Interestingly, Thoreau believes that even utilitarian forestry considerations argue for retaining a certain amount of diversity in the woods. Laura Dassow Walls notes that this position anticipated by nearly 150 years today's "New Forestry," which rejects single-species monocultures in favor of a more diverse and hence resilient forest (275, note 18). Thoreau s conservation ideal, as we might reconstruct it from these late writings, would perhaps be to work with nature to provide enough of what we need—wood for our fires, money to send the children to college—while insuring that nature's diversity and beauty remain. If we don't cut some wood, we will freeze to death. But if we destroy our woods, then our children's education is useless. "Let me lead you back into your wood-lots again," Thoreau begins the lecture "Succession of Forest Trees" (Natural History Essays, 74). He wants his neighbors to walk into the woods with more insight and interest, knowing and appreciating their stories. He wants them to return to their woodlots not merely to better calculate how many cords of wood they may get out of them, but to reap a harvest of knowledge and beauty. In the end, despite his high valuation of human freedom, Thoreau is willing to curtail independence in order to protect forests. His final words on management (and the final sentence of "The Dispersion of Seeds") are "forest wardens should be appointed by the town—overseers of poor husbandmen" (Faith in a Seed, 173). This anticipates the many environmental regulations that Americans have enacted over the last century in order to preserve a healthy, partially wild environment for future generations. Of course, preserving natural areas and regulating land use are only part of a comprehensive environmental politics. This must also include reining in industrial pollution, attending to the "built environment" of cities and towns, limiting population growth and economic consumption and much more besides. Some of this Thoreau anticipated, some he did not. But in general, Thoreau's hostility to overconsumption and to an "economistic" view of the world fits in well with a comprehensive environmentalism. Like most modern environmentalists, Thoreau's vision is one in which the human economy fits itself to nature's economy, rather than vice versa. Like most environmentalists, Thoreau believes less consumptive, more intelligent and active lifestyles will be better for us and better for the Earth. It is interesting to compare Thoreau's views with the conservation philosophy recently outlined in ecologist Daniel Botkin's book No Man's Garden: Thoreau and a New Vision for Civilization and Nature (see also Cafaro, "Taming Henry"). Botkin believes that many environmentalists take too negative a view of the human presence in nature. In his book, he asks readers to appreciate semi-wild</page><page sequence="40">Phillip Cafaro 55 areas close to home and to recognize the ways conscientious foresters and ecological restorationists can manage nature to enhance biodiversity. Botkin seeks to place these reflections within an overall environmental philosophy, writing in his preface that his "purpose is to help adjust our approach to living within nature and to integrating civilization and nature, in the hope that both can prosper and persist" (xxi). Botkin's positive message is plausible and his vehicle for conveying it clever and potentially insightful. For as we have seen, Thoreau too wants to preserve and enjoy what is best in nature and culture. Nevertheless, Botkin's hostility to wild nature is palpable. Unlike Thoreau, who could enjoy and appreciate both wild and pastoral landscapes, Botkin resents the notion of wild areas not put to profitable human use and sees wilderness advocacy as prima facie evidence of misanthropy (40, 153). In Botkin's view, human beings should manage the entire landscape so as to further whatever goals we have for it (see for example his discussion of possible conservation goals for Mono Lake, 210-11). Anything less manifests insufficient faith in human civilization. He has great confidence in our ability to manage nature given human "creativity, innovation, and technological development" (31). Of course, we should preserve some places with rich biodiversity for our own enjoyment and study. But keeping nature wild has no value, in itself. Through selective quotation—mostly on the basis of the famous Ktaadn ascent passage—Botkin tries to prove Thoreau's dislike for wilderness and his preference for a tamer, more managed environment (7, 148). "Thoreau," he writes, "having experienced the vast wilderness in Maine, rejected large areas of wilderness" (155-56). Perhaps sensing that this is implausible given Thoreau's repeated paeans to the wild, Botkin sometimes argues that Thoreau valued wildness as a "spiritual state," not wilderness, which refers to "a physical state of nature" (121). "Thoreau saw wildness as an internal quality, not an external quantity," he claims (276), and again: "Thoreau meant wildness as a state of mind, not a physical place, so the statement ['in wildness is the preservation of the world'] is erroneously used to justify the conservation or preservation of wilderness" (260). Whatever the merits of Botkin's conservation philosophy, it seems a long way from Thoreau's own. Consider how often Thoreau suggested the value of letting nature be and of simply attending to her. Consider his frequent laments over the loss of wild nature. Consider how often he spoke skeptically of technology and of our blundering attempts to control nature (for example in "Paradise (To Be) Regained" in Reform Papers). Consider how often he advised us to manage ourselves, particularly our hoggish consumption of resources (Botkin makes no mention of the dangers of resource overconsumption—an astounding oversight in a book which purports to develop an overall conservation philosophy). Above all, consider Thoreau's pioneering attempt in "Walking" to introduce "the wild" as a central concept in ethics. In that late essay, Thoreau states his faith in wildness as a saving virtue in people and nature (Natural History Essays, 112-19). To substitute</page><page sequence="41">56 The Concord Saunterer control and management for wildness is to turn Thoreau s conservation philosophy upside down. To sever the love of "wildness" from a commitment to protect actual wild places as wild is to render that philosophy impotent. Of course, Thoreau does not advocate anarchy, in conservation or in politics generally. I have already noted his practical suggestions for better management of the working landscape and for improvements to the "built" human environment. Nevertheless, he wishes to retain some wildness in the rural landscape and to devote parts of the hinterlands to wilderness, in order to preserve what God or Nature has made there and see what they will create in the future. It is his love for wilderness and his appreciation of the threats facing it which prompt Thoreau in The Maine Woods to propose his system of "national preserves." Botkin devotes a dozen pages in his book to ridiculing contemporary efforts to create a Maine Woods National Preserve, siding with the multi-national timber companies and real estate developers who oppose it (161-73). But subtract love and commitment to wilderness, and we are no longer talking about Thoreau's conservation philosophy. Nor are we talking about a conservation philosophy most of us would accept on its merits. Botkin saddles wilderness advocates with a number of dubious positions. They put people at the bottom of the moral hierarchy, below lobsters and flatworms (39). They have a simplistic "either/or" view of natural areas: either such places are completely wild and pure or they are utterly tamed and degraded (23). Wilderness proponents are against all human modification of the environment: anytime, anywhere (139, 227). After setting up these straw men, Botkin easily poses as the voice of reason. But how reasonable is it, really, for human beings to take total control of the biosphere? Do we not want some areas that are relatively free from human dominance? Isn't wildness itself an integral part of that biodiversity which we are committed to saving? Botkin mistakes Thoreau s position mainly by narrowing it. He cannot see that Thoreau values both village woodlots and wilderness. He cannot see that Thoreau advocates both wise management and nonmanagement. He cannot see that Thoreau appreciates both nature's value to him and its intrinsic value. Indeed, since this last philosophical mistake undergirds many of the book's erroneous conclusions about Thoreau's conservation views, it is worth a more detailed look. "Rather than seeing species or ecosystems as important in themselves, Thoreau saw nature as important to human creativity, civilization, and culture," Botkin writes (44). He follows this with the astonishing assertion: "I found little if any discussion in his writings of an intrinsic value of nature independent of the ability of human beings to benefit from it" (54). As we have seen, large parts of two chapters of Walden are given over to arguing for such intrinsic value and to exploring the resulting ethical demands on us. Every one of Thoreau's books and most of his natural history essays assert the intrinsic value of nature and the need for human restraint in its use. Botkin seems to believe that we can advocate nature preservation either for anthropocentric or nonanthropocentric reasons, but not both.</page><page sequence="42">Phillip Cafaro 57 This is a clearly a false dichotomy: from Yellowstone and Yosemite onwards, national park supporters have given both sorts of reasons. It is true that Thoreau also talks about the knowledge, sense of history, spiritual connection and enriched aesthetic experience that contact with wild nature provides to people. But these are additional reasons to preserve wild nature, explore it responsibly and use it sparingly. Thoreau's recognition of these anthropocentric values does not mean that our interests should always trump the interests of other species or that we should manage all parts of the landscape according to our own needs and desires. He explicitly and repeatedly rejects these positions. They are Botkin's positions, not Thoreau's. Still, Botkjn s brand of environmentalism makes sense, if we take out any concern for human overconsumption and any reverence for nature as it is and substitute an infatuation with our own abilities. Then we may come to see ourselves as the lords of all creation, legitimately deciding which species live and which die. Conservation means scientifically considering our "biospheric options," Botkin writes, so as to better choose "what is required for life to persist with the qualities we desire" (193-94). Whether we allow wolves and other top predators to persist in the Maine woods is not an ethical decision—it all depends on human preferences (166). Botkin's book shows how environmental ethics can go astray if we take too high a view of ourselves and ground conservation policies in an exclusive concern for human welfare. Dan Botkin is right: we need an environmental ethics which celebrates human culture and wild nature and makes a legitimate place for both. We need sustainable forestry and healthy cities and ecological restoration of degraded lands. But we also need to rein in the excessive human appropriation of the biosphere and our desire to control the entire landscape. We need to set aside more wilderness. We need an ethics which insists that we consume less, in order to make this possible. The real Henry Thoreau has a lot to say about what such an ethics demands of us and what it offers in return. Conclusion Whether we push them in a personal or a political direction, I believe Thoreau's words have much to teach us about environmental ethics. In the end, however, his most important contribution may be his demand that we go out and live our ethics. As modern philosophy has gotten more technical and sophisticated, philosophers have lost sight of the ancient connection between philosophy and living a life of wisdom. As Thoreau puts it in Walden: There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its</page><page sequence="43">58 The Concord Saunterer dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically. (14-15) We need more environmental philosophers teaching in college classrooms, I believe. But we also need them managing forests and farms, starting co-housing communities, redesigning engines and buildings, teaching children the names of birds and flowers, serving on planning commissions and running for elected office, and simply living better lives in communities across America and throughout the world. In this way, each of us may make his or her own practical contribution to environmental ethics. We should do so, for nature's sake and for our own. Notes ' Similarly, when Thoreau (A Week) speaks of the fishes' "happiness" being "a regular fruit of the summer" or of the bream's "humble happiness," he is using this word in an ancient sense (26,27). For Plato and Aristotle, "eudaimonia," the supreme goal in their ethical systems, meant "flourishing" or "living well." We translate this word with our subjective and trivial "happiness," which implies merely feelings of contentment or pleasure. The recent revival of virtue ethics in philosophy has centered on recapturing the ancient meanings of "virtue" and "happiness" (or rather, of their Greek and Latin cognates and equivalents). 2 Studying anadromous fish may change our view of knowledge. We may come to believe that human intelligence and knowledge, like the shad's, are more social, environmental or relational than we previously assumed. After all, we know nothing that is not mediated by a language that is not our creation. Science, humanity's greatest generator of knowledge, is clearly an ongoing, social institution and scientific knowledge does not repose in any one individual or group of individuals. Similarly, Thoreau's suggestion that fish instinct is equivalent to human faith might seem preposterous: mere metaphorical fluff. Yet the comparison may clarify Thoreau's conception of the virtue of faith. Faith plays an important role in Walden's ethics of striving, allowing us to formulate ideals which "belie" or transcend experience, helping us better ourselves in the absence of knowledge or certainty (Walden, 9, 325). The shad's instinct might play a similar role in its life, helping it do what is best in the absence of the guidance of reason. 3 Just as the logic of the argument in "Higher Laws" pushes Thoreau further toward asceticism, it pushes him further toward idealism and away from naturalism in his meta-ethics. A philosopher who has partly based his ethics on following nature (46), developing his own true nature (19), and the essential goodness of nature (78-79, 165-66) is forced by these issues to face the fact that</page><page sequence="44">Phillip Cafaro 59 natural does not necessarily equal good, with all the complication to his ethical schema this implies. In Walden's first chapter, Thoreau had relied on naturalistic arguments to support his judgments that his neighbor's lives were unhealthy and joyless: What I have heard of Brahmins sitting exposed to four fires and looking in the face of the sun; or hanging suspended, with their heads downward, over flames; or looking at the heavens over their shoulders 'until it becomes impossible for them to resume their natural position, while from the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the stomach;' or dwelling, chained for life at the foot of a tree; or measuring with their bodies, like caterpillars, the breadth of vast empires; or standing on one leg on the tops of pillars,—even these forms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible and astonishing than the scenes which I daily witness. (4) The passage suggests that his neighbors' work deforms their characters and lives and stunts their natural abilities. This is most clearly implied by the Brahmins' twisted, paralyzed necks, and emphasized by the images of immobility and stasis ("hanging suspended," "chained for life," "standing ... on the tops of pillars"). We can see how such naturalism may appear to ground ethics. If we share a certain purposive human nature then some actions or life-paths are likely to be bad for each and every one of us. Hence naturalism supports ethical universalism, almost universally seen as a desideratum by philosophers. In "Higher Laws," however, Thoreau's ascetic denial of appetite leads him in the opposite direction, to decry human nature: We are conscious of an animal in us, which awakens in proportion as our higher nature slumbers. It is reptile and sensual, and perhaps cannot be wholly expelled; like the worms which, even in life and health, occupy our bodies .... I fear that it may enjoy a certain health of its own; that we may be well, yet not pure. (219) Having suggested earlier that we should pursue our ideals beyond bodily health, if necessary, Thoreau here reminds us that we may have a certain animal healthiness— and by implication achieve a certain type of happiness focused on physical pleasure—which yet conflicts with our higher ideals and goals. In this latter chapter, he argues for privileging ideals over our animal nature, concluding that "nature is hard to be overcome, but she must be overcome" (221). Considering their source, these words cannot fail to shock, as does the quote from John Donne which follows: "How happy's he who hath due place assigned, To his beasts and disaforested his mind!" (220).</page><page sequence="45">60 The Concord Saunterer There is a place for such anti-naturalism in virtue ethics. We have all felt the tug between our physical appetites and higher goals, and ethics necessarily involves disciplining our natural inclinations in the service of our articulated ideals. Here is that aspect of ethics which supports idealism. Just so, the partial conjunction between health, strength and vitality on the one hand, and human happiness and excellence on the other, makes an ethical naturalism plausible. But neither of these meta-ethical positions is stable. A naturalism such as Aristotle's which seeks to ground our ethical judgments in human nature eventually confronts indeterminate aspects of human nature which allow for various sorts of development and ways in which following ideals may improve (rather than perfect) human nature. An ethical idealism such as Kant's, on the other hand, cannot explain why an individual should follow moral rules "legislated" by his ideal nature. Kant's justification seems to rest, finally, on an implicit equation of our ideal with our real selves, which individuals are always free to deny. In somewhat different ways, both Aristotle and Kant are brought up short by our actual, yet incompletely determined, human nature. In the end, this difficulty in specifying a meta-ethical position from which to clearly derive normative conclusions rests on the impossibility of privileging either our ideals or our human nature. Thoreau, to his credit, keeps worrying the problem in Walden. Even the idealistic "Higher Laws" begins with the assertion: "I found in myself, and still find, an instinct toward a higher, or, as it is named, spiritual life, as do most men, and another toward a primitive rank and savage one, and I reverence them both. I love the wild not less than the good" (210). Those inclined to take "Higher Laws" as moving from a false or "lower" naturalism to a true or "higher" idealism, should remember that the following chapter, "Brute Neighbors," returns us again to nature and particularity. Also, note Thoreau's reversal of the higher/lower dualism in "Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads" and elsewhere. Taken as a whole, I think Walden supports a dialectical view of this issue. We attend to our human nature for information on how to improve our lives. That is what Thoreau is asking his neighbors to do in the first few pages of the book. He wants them to ask themselves if they are emotionally satisfied and physically flourishing: whether they are actually happy. This will suggest possible improvements. Yet even as we interrogate our experience, we must "have some faith left which belies that experience" (9). Because "the greatest gains and values are farthest from being appreciated. We easily come to doubt if they exist. We soon forget them. They are the highest reality" (216). Still, human nature is not infinitely plastic and we must try our ideals in life. So the dialectic continues. The problem, obviously, is that once we no longer privilege either human nature or our ideals, then ethical indeterminacy and uncertainty, which seemed merely a matter of temporary ignorance, threaten to become permanent aspects of the human condition. Yet that seems to be our situation. This is because new</page><page sequence="46">Phillip Cafaro 61 ideals are always possible and cannot be ruled out a priori, because human nature itself is slowly changing, and because no privileging of the one over the other can be accepted. But then new questions arise: What is the value of pursuing greater clarity or consistency in our lives? Why believe our efforts to know ourselves will help us to live better lives? Perhaps the strongest justification for such efforts is simply a pragmatic belief that we will live better lives if we make them. Walden provides stirring calls to "know thyself' and live a life of integrity, and beyond these, Thoreau's example of a life lived in obedience to these calls. (At the same time, it gives us the character of Alek Therien, who calls such moral striving into question: 144-50). 4 Not only does Locke make human use all-important, he slights higher, non-consumptive human uses and the basic ecosystem services such as clean air and water on which human life depends. Recent scientific calculations put nature's contributions to human economic productivity much higher. s Thoreau of course realized that white settlement had brought great changes to the landscape. The towering white pines were gone, as were the catamount, the wolf and even the deer. Still, parts of the landscape remained, if not pristine, wild: not primarily the product of human manipulation and control, but largely the scene of spontaneous natural productions. 6 "The Ponds" suggests that a correct environmental ethics must be holistic: valuing wholes as well as individuals, ponds as well as woodchucks. Contemporary environmental ethicists such as Holmes Rolston (1988) have tried to affirm such holism. But it has proven easier for philosophers to extend attention and concern to non-human individuals than to comprehend and appreciate non-human or more than-human wholes, such as species, particular places or ecosystems. Such wholes are more loosely integrated and difficult to demarcate. It is not clear that a forest or a pond can have "interests" which may be harmed. Perhaps most important, modern ethicists are more used to valuing individuals than collective entities (in this they differ significantly from ancient ethicists, who usually placed the civic or collective good above the good of individuals). For better and for worse, we live in an individualistic age. Still, I believe Thoreau is right to suggest that ethical holism is a necessary part of getting right with nature. Perhaps one way to meet the difficulty here is to temporarily set aside the theoretical effort to ethically value wholes and to ask instead how we might value them concretely and actually. We may then see Walden as a veritable how-to manual for appreciating natural wholes, from woodchucks and trees to ponds and forests. Walden suggests that even partial success in such ethical appreciation may make us better people: more knowledgeable, more aware, more alive. We need to remember that such a holistic ethic need not entail only sacrifices, but may really be necessary for our happiness. If we value the various natural communities to which we belong, we may sometimes need to sacrifice</page><page sequence="47">62 The Concord Saunterer individuals' interests to community interests. This will often be for our own good in the long run, since our flourishing is intimately bound up with the flourishing of larger wholes. We cannot live healthy lives in polluted environments. We cannot have a rich experience or knowledge of nature without rich, accessible natural environments to explore. Thus valuing nature holistically may be in our enlightened self-interest. This is a theme that contemporary environmental ethicists need to develop more fully. Works Cited Bennett, Jane. Thoreau's Nature. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 1994. Botkin, Daniel.
