<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Symbolic Meaning of the Club in the Iconography of the Kusana Kings The statue of Kaniska, found in the village of Mat near Mathur? at the start of this century, represents, as is known, the king standing; he is dressed in the characteristic Ku? sana clothing, and in his left hand he holds a sword, while in his right hand there is a long heavy mace, richly decorated (fig. 1). Vogel, in describing this work, had asked if we should see the representation of a weapon for real use in this latter element, or if it should be considered a symbol of king? ship; he himself tended toward the first solution (x). In reality, both hypotheses are ac? ceptable, since one does not exclude the other. The mace Kaniska is holding, with its minutely described details, is obviously the reproduction of a weapon to be used, even if of a ceremonial nature. On the other hand, since this object appears on a great many Kusana coins associated with the royal image, one must assume that a precise symbolic meaning is connected with it, like that involved in all the other elements that accompany the figure of a king in the official representations of every nation and every age. One of the ways to arrive at this meaning may be the study of the iconographic characteristics and figurative evolution of the mace in the most significant images of the Kusana kings in which it appears. This weapon is constantly associated with the figure of Vima Kadphises, as shown on coins. To simplify matters, we shall divide the images of this ruler into seven main types, which will be briefly described and commented on. 1) Bust of the king emerging from clouds (2), turned to right. Wears a diadem tied in a bow on the nape of the neck (3); flames issue from shoulders which are covered with the chlamys; right hand holds the club, that points up and rests on right shoulder (fig. 2). (*) The subject of this article is drawn from my tesi di laurea on the art of Mathur? in the Kus?na period, presented at the University of Rome in 1962. I wish to express my gratitude to Prof. M. Bussagli, who encouraged and aided my work, supplying me with useful suggestions and advice. C1) J. Ph. Vogel, ? Explorations at Mathur? ?, ASIAR, 1911-12 (1915), p. 123. (2) V. A. Smith, Catalogue of the Coins in the Indian Museum, Calcutta, Oxford, 1906, p. 68, 4, pi. 11, 5. This work will subsequently be referred to as IMC. In the motif here interpreted as clouds has been also seen a representation of rocks or moun? tains: cf. R. G?bl, ? Die M?nzpr?gung der Kusan von Vima Kadphises bis Bahr am IV ?, in F. Al? theim, R. Stiehl, Finanzgeschichte der Sp?tantike, Frankfurt, 1957, p. 181. (3) The diadem knotted on the nape of the neck 248</page><page sequence="2">In this case the weapon is rather short, with highly accentuated knots that are placed at almost regular intervals and protrude towards the top. It is remarkably similar to Hera? cles' club. This coin, which shows the ruler with his head uncovered ? a detail which is not so common ? might probably be considered on the whole the closest to the Indo-Greek models. This impression is confirmed by the clothing and the hair, treated in small tufts, as in many representations of Graeco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek rulers (4). This image also shows clear analogies to the square coins of Lysias and Strato I (5), which show the bust of Hera? cles with the head turned to the right, while the club rests on the left shoulder, in this case. The club resting on the shoulder is a characteristic element in the iconography of Heracles and it seems hard to detach the image of Vima Kadphises from a whole series of images of the god, which probably have an Argead origin. This Heracles type bearing the club on its shoulder, already present in the coins of Seleucus, is also adopted by De? metrius and taken up by Eutidemus, Zoilus II Soter and Theophiius, as well as by Lysias and Strato (6). On the other hand, this way of carrying the weapon seems far more ap? propriate in the image of the god in an attitude of repose than in that of a king (7). 2) Bust of the king emerging from clouds (8). The head, wearing helmet and diadem, is turned to the left. The raised right hand holds the club, the left a crown or a ring. Flames issue from the shoulders (fig. 3). This image seems to be cruder than the preceding one and the features are more marked and clumsy. The object the king holds in his left hand is described by Whitehead as an ankusa, but in reality seems to be a crown or a ring. The king's mace resembles that shown in coin no. 1; this is a Heracles type club, which shows symmetrical knots placed at regular intervals. But the weapon in coin no. 1 is more realistic in type while in this case the with a bow also appears on the coins of Kuj?la Kadphises (P. Gardner, The Coins of the Greek and Scythic Kings of Bactria and India in the British Museum, London, 1896, pi. XXV, 2, 3. This work will subsequently be referred to as BMC), but was also very widespread in the images of Parthian rulers; let us mention in particular the coins of Gondophares and Abdagases (ibid., pi. XXII, 11 and pi. XXII, 1) or those of Ortagnes and Sanabares (ibid., pi. XXIII, 9, 10, 12) in which this element appears in a highly stylized form. (4) Another characteristic of this coin of Vima Kadphises is the way in which the ribbons of the diadem which fall behind the neck are treated. They wind sinuously, with the ends rigidly bent and turned in the direction of the shoulders. This is probably a stylized and stiff interpretation of a special way of showing the diadem with the ribbons unfurling that is evident on certain coins of Lysias and Hippostratos, for example (R. B. Whitehead, Catalogue of the Coins in the Punjab Museum, Lahore, Oxford, 1914, vol. I, pi. Ill, 150 and pi. VIII, 610. This work will subsequently be referred to as PMC. Cf. also A. N. Lahiri, Corpus of Indo-Greek Coins, Calcutta, 1965, pp. 22-23). (5) PMC, pi. Ill, 157 and pi. V, 366-67; IMC, pi. Ill, 6 and pi. IV, 13. (6) For other examples of the club carried on the shoulder, cf. A. Cunningham, ? Coins of the Kushans, or Great Yue-ti ?, NumChr, XII, 1892, pi. V, 3, 4; R. B. Whitehead, ?Notes on the Indo-Greeks, Part II?, NumChr, VII, 1947, pi. II, 8. (7) A coin on the whole similar to that described here shows the king wearing the diadem on his uncovered head; he has on a chlamys and a small club rests on his right shoulder (BMC, pi. XXV, 8). (8) PMC, pi. XVII, 33. 249</page><page sequence="3">same element is treated in a very schematic way. The knots are very protruding and slanted up C). Due to this special kind of stylization, the object takes on a shape that vaguely recalls a plant form. 3) Image of the king seated in the European fashion on a long-legged throne, his feet resting on a stool (10). He wears the characteristic Kusana dress, with helmet and diadem on his head, which is turned to the left; flames issue from his shoulders. His right hand lifts up the thunderbolt; the left rests on his leg. On the right, next to the throne, there is a club pointed down (fig. 4). The fact that the mace is placed next to the king gives us a complete view of the weapon. Thus we observe that it looks like an object that has been given a shape, even if in a very simple fashion. In fact, the handle is smooth and has a rounded end. Here too the knots are symmetrical. On the whole, the presence of the thunderbolt and the type of seat shown lead us to link this image with the iconography of Zeus enthroned. 4) Bust of the king emerging from clouds (11). He wears the helmet and diadem surmounted by the trident; the right hand holds the club, the left the elephant-goad (12) (fig. 5). Here the weapon shows a particularly interesting aspect: it is rather short and has a thin stick-like handle ending in a disc-shaped element, above which the club itself deve? lops, formed by symmetrical protrusions that make it look like a branch. This form seems to be clearly derived from the type shown in coins nos. 2 and 3, of which it represents a further evolution. It should be noted, though, that in this case the object has such a striking resemblance to a vegetable element as to make us think that we have here an almost mechanical reproduction of the king's attribute, whose meaning has not been under? stood. However, it is possible that there has been an exchange of values between the wooden club and the plant element, it too often connected with the royal image (13). 5) Image of the king standing in a chariot (14). The ruler wears helmet and diadem (9) A similar stylization also characterizes the club of Heracles in certain cases, as can be seen especially in a coin of Eutidemos II (PMC, pi. I, 27). (10) PMC, pi. XVII, 31. P1) BMC, pi. XXV, 9. (12) This element, which refers to the king's prowess in riding elephants, calls to mind a coin of Vima Kadphises, which shows the king in the act of riding an elephant (R. B. Whitehead, ? No? tes on the Indo-Greeks, Part III ?, NumChr, XI, 19.50, pi. XXII, 18). In this image too the king holds the club resting on his right shoulder, but the form of the weapon is unrecognizable. This type, rare in Vima's iconography, is found again on the coins of Huviska (PMC, pi. XII, 19; BMC, pi. XVII, 12; A. Cunningham, ?Coins of the Kushans, or Great Yue-ti ?, NumChr, XII, 1892, pi. VIII, 15). (13) The scepter and the plant or branch are attributes of the king in that he is considered the possessor and custodian of the Tree of Life, according to a concept of Babylonian origin widespread throughout the whole Near East, as shown in the many representations of kings holding in their hands scepters of plant or flower form. Cf. G. Widengren, The King and the Tree of Life, Uppsala, 1951, passim, fig. 3 ff. (14) BMC, pi. XXXII, 13; PMC, pi. XX, 3. 250</page><page sequence="4">and holds the club resting on his right shoulder; beside him there stands a small cha? rioteer (15). The horses seem to be moving on the clouds (fig. 6). The exceptional iconographic scheme at once recalls a coin of Maues (16), which shows the king resting his right hand on a spear, on a two-horse chariot driven by a charioteer. A similar iconographic scheme, showing a Victory on a two-horse chariot, is also to be found in a coin of Mithridates I (17) and in a coin of Antiochus IV (18). Another similar but more ancient example is a coin of Andragoras, which has on the reverse a qua? driga drawn by horned horses and driven by a personage, perhaps Victory; there is a warrior on the chariot (**). There is a detail which makes the coin of Vima Kadphises differ from the examples listed above and which has not been pointed out: it is made up of the presence of an element that lies above the king's head, and is seen to be an um? brella. If this identification is exact, another symbol that is clearly Indian in origin would be added to the others through which the Kus?nas gave visible expression to their own concept of kingship. The chariot and umbrella recall to mind too the ceremony of the V?japeya (20), during the celebration of which the king became a universal sovereign (21). The iconographic theme presented to us by the coin of Vima Kadphises thus appears tied to the image of Victory's chariot, but it may be that it is also connected with the repre? sentations of the solar chariot, which is however usually drawn by four or seven animals. If the horses' hoofs really do rest on clouds, as they seem to, it would be even more obvious that the chariot is a celestial one, which might therefore symbolize the universal sovereignty which becomes manifest and realizes itself through the ruler's travels across the space of which he is taking possession. The club appears once again in the coin under examination; it is held by the king in his right hand and rests on his shoulder. The position of the weapon, which is very thick at the upper end, becoming very narrow at the handle, links this coin to nos. 2 and 3; even the form closely resembles that of Heracles' club, but in this case we do not see the characteristic knots and the body of the weapon seems to be smooth. 6) Image of the king seated cross-legged on a low couch (~). The ruler wears the characteristic Kusana costume, made up of the robe, the heavy cloak and the felt boots. (15) The presence of the auriga was pointed out by H. H. Wilson, Antiquities and Coins of Afgha? nistan, London, 1841, p. 355, and by A. Cunnin? gham, op. cit., p. 47. (16) A. Cunningham, ? Coins of the Sakas ?, NumChr, X, 1890, pi. II, 1-5. Cf. W. W.

Let us recall that R. G?bl, ? Roman Patterns for Kushana Coins?, Journal of the Numismatic Society of India, XXII, 1960, pp. 81-82, thinks that the coin of Vima Kadphises was derived from Roman models. Cf. by the same author, ?

On his head, turned to right, we see the crested helmet and the diadem; his right hand holds the mace which rests on one shoulder. The sword rests on his side and left thigh, and is almost completely covered by the cloak (fig. 7). This way of showing the ruler's figure, sitting cross-legged, recalls a type of coin of Maues (23) and especially one of Azes (24), extremely interesting because the king's left hand holds a weapon that might be identified as a mace (25). Let us note, finally, that in the image of Vima the weapon has a special aspect: it is not similar to the club of Heracles be? cause it has no knots, and the thickness is equal throughout its length; these characteristics make it clearly resemble a scepter. However, the position of the weapon, resting on the right shoulder, ties this image in with those already examined (26). 7) Image of the king standing, turned to left, with the diadem and a tall hat (2T). He wears a tunic and a long cloak; his right hand rests on a small altar. On the left there is a trident-axe, on the right a club pointed down (fig. 8). The handle of this weapon seems to be worked, because the upper end has a knob, while the lower one is finished off by a ring-shaped element; from the latter there begins the body of the club, which in this case seems to be without knots (28). The examination of the main types of coins of Vima Kadphises, in which the form of the mace is clearly recognizable, thus shows that it is represented in different ways and that its iconographic evolution can be traced. It should be noted above all that we pass from a type linked quite clearly to the club of Heracles ? and the whole image of the king in coin no. 1 is at any rate inspired by the iconography of the hero ? to ever more sche? matic forms that still do not conceal their derivation from that model. There are as well various interpretations of the mace, which sometimes takes on a form similar to that of a scepter, as in coin no. 6. A club of the Heracles type, but with a smooth surface, appears again in the image of the king in a chariot (no. 5). The study of the coins of Vima Kad? phises lets us also realize that from the very beginning elements taken from the Indian world were inserted into Kus?na royal iconography; an example is the umbrella, one of the most ancient and famous symbols of Indian kingship, another is the figurative theme of the king riding an elephant and holding the ankusa in his hands. (23) IMC, pi. VIII, 4; PMC, pi. X, 31; R. B. Whitehead, ? Notes on the Indo-Greeks, Part I ?, NumChr, XX, 1940, pp. 114-15. (24) PMC, pi. XI, 195; BMC, pi. XIX, 1. (25) Whitehead describes the weapon as a sword or club, Gardner thinks it is a sword and Tarn considers it a xovtog, the great spear of the cataphracts. (26) The club also appears on the king's right shoulder on two coins that show his bust with the shoulders covered with chlamys and his head wear? ing the crested helmet and diadem (A. Cunnin gham, ? Coins of the Kushans... ?, tit., pi. XV, 3, 4). In both cases the weapon is long and thin with small knots. A curious detail is that in these coins the hand holding the club has the index finger outstretched, while the other fingers are bent around the weapon's handle. (27) IMC, pi. XI, 7. (28) A coin showing the king in the same posi? tion and with the same attributes is represented and described by Whitehead [PMC, p. 184, pi. XVII, 36). In this case, however, the club seems to be larger in size and has very accentuated knots. 252</page><page sequence="6">The mace does not appear in the coins of Kaniska; we can follow its iconographic changes, however, by examining the coins of Huviska, while it would be opportune to deal separately with the weapon shown in the statue of Kaniska, the singular form of which has no precedent in the iconography of the Kusana kings. As we know, Cunningham (2*) divided the coins that show the bust of Huviska into four different types, called A, B, C, D. Among these, the club only appears in types B, C and D. We must remember, however, that the identification of this element has not been unanimously accepted by scholars. According to Gardner, it represents an ear of corn, an interpretation based on a coin in the British Museum, in which the scholar recognized a double ear of corn (30). But in reality one can say that the likelihood of recognizing a club in this object is very great; it can be noted, though, that some coins permit a different in? terpretation, without letting this fact impair the identification of the club in those images, and they are the larger part, in which this weapon is clearly recognizable (31). Let us now examine the main forms that this element assumes in the coins of Huviska. 8) Type C. Bust of the king emerging from clouds, turned to left, with a rounded helmet and the diadem ending in two very long ribbons. The king wears a draped cloak. Ankusa in the left hand and club in the right (32) (fig. 9). In this case the weapon takes on a form similar to that of a pestle; the body, parti? cularly small and ovoid in shape, is connected with a long thin handle. This form (33) probably represents an evolution of the type of club that can be seen to the right of Vima Kadphises on coin no. 5. 9) Type B. Bust of the king, nimbate, emerging from clouds, turned to left, with a pointed helmet (34). The king wears an embroidered cloak and the chlamys. In his right hand he holds the club and in the left a staff surmounted by what probably is a wheel (35) (fig. 10). (2?) A. Cunningham, ? Coins of the Kushans...?, cit., p. 98. (30) BMC, pi. XXVIII, 9; A. Cunningham, (?Coins of the Kushans... ?, cit., p. 98), V. A. Smith {IMC, p. 74, note 1) and R. B. Whitehead (PMC, p. 194 ff.) agree on interpreting the object as a club. (31) On a coin of type C {PMC, pi. XVIII, 117) the king holds in his right hand an object that Whitehead thinks is a kind of scepter, but which might also be an element of plant type (cf. no. 4). One can also take into consideration the hypothesis that the object is a metal mace with protruding pointed elements. (32) PMC, pi. XXV, 135. (33) Another coin of Huviska (IMC, pi. XII, 10) shows the same kind of mace, but in this spe? cimen the characteristics described in no. 8 are even more accentuated: the handle is longer, while the body of the weapon has become even smaller and rounder. The two coins are very much alike, not only as regards the position and costume of the king, but also in respect to the features of the face and the presence of long moustaches. Let us also note that they make up a type that differs greatly from other images of Huviska, to the point of making us think that they do not belong to the same Huviska. (34) PMC, pi. XX, x. (35) The staff that has at its top l?hchanas or emblems, such as figures of animals or other elements, sometimes not clearly identifiable, appears frequently on the coins of Huviska, and will become very common on those of the Guptas, where it is often surmounted by the image of Garuda or by other symbols of different meaning, 253</page><page sequence="7">The mace is, in this case, thin and long in shape, and shows regular and symmetrical indentations along the sides, which may be thought of as an extremely schematic interpre? tation of the knots on the club of Heracles; the types shown on coins 1, 2 and 3 of Vima Kadphises may be thought of as successive steps in this evolutionary process. 10) Type B. Bust of the king emerging from clouds, turned to left, with diadem and helmet adorned with the symbols of the sun and moon (36). The sovereign wears an em bioidered cloak; in his left hand he holds a standard perhaps surmounted by a bird, and from which ribbons are hanging; his right hand holds the mace (fig. 11). The handle is long and thin, while the cylindrical body is capped at the ends by two small cone-shaped elements. On the whole, the mace closely resembles a scepter. 11) Type C. Bust of the king emerging from clouds and turned to left, with diadem and round-shaped helmet, richly decorated (37). The shoulders are covered with the chla mys. He holds a standard in his left hand and the mace in his right (fig. 12). The weapon is very singular in appearance: the handle resembles that seen in the coins described above, but the body, cylindrical in shape, is made up of superimposed disc? shaped elements, the last of which is thicker than the others. This rather unusual type seems very much like a mace shown in a Bh?rhut relief, a tondo that represents the Sad danta ]?taka, in the hands of the hunter Sonuttara (fig. 14). There are close resemblances with both Huviska's weapon and that of the Bh?rhut relief, in the mace that appears in the lower right hand of Visnu in a well-known image discovered at Taxila (fig. 13); in this the god, his head adorned with the kirtta shaped like a turreted crown, holds in his four hands padma, gada, sahkha and cakra. In this case the mace (gada) has a cylindrical shape and is made up of disc-shaped elements whose outer border is decorated, and which are separated by smooth zones whose surface is lower. This type of gada is related, according to Banerjea, to the club that appears in the right hand of a male god, identified with Siva, in some coins of Maues, and also to the weapon shown in the seal of Sivaraksita, discovered at Sirkap, showing what may be the same god, and lastly, to the gada held by a composite divinity in a Hephthalite seal (38). Banerjea's comparisons seem very convincing as regards these last three kinds of maces, which undoubtedly represent the evolution of one single type; their relationship to the gada ot Visnu in the Taxila image is not quite as evident. In fact, the club in the examples cited by this scholar, and particularly in the most ancient one, represented by the coin of Maues, is formed of almost spheroid elements that get smaller and smaller as they go toward the handle. This form characterized by extreme thickness at the end, that grows thinner from that point on, is also found in the Hephthalite seal, despite the fact that the weapon here (36) PMC, pi. XII, 15. (37) PMC, pi. XX, ix. (38) R. N. Banerjea, The Development of Hin? du Iconography, Calcutta, 1956, pp. 401-402, pi. XXI; pi. IX, fig. 18; pi. XI, fig. 2. 254</page><page sequence="8">becomes thinner and lighter, while in the case of the Huviska mace, as in that shown in the Bh?rhut relief or in the statue of Visnu, the body of the weapon is made up of spaced disc-shaped elements that show a decoration on their outer edges and all have the same dimensions, so that the object has the same width in every part. We can thus state that even if there are analogies between the type of mace mentioned by Banerjea, in particular in that phase of evolution represented by the Hephthalite seal, and the gada of Visnu we have linked to the weapon of Huviska, as well as to that shown in the tondo of the Bh?rhut relief, the two forms come from different prototypes. The mace that appears in the coin of Maues, and its later transformations, are clearly derived from the knotty club of Heracles while Huviska's weapon and that of the Visnu image seem to come from a type that was probably Indian, an example of which is shown in the Bh?rhut relief. Examination of the representations of the mace that appear in the coins of Huviska lets us discern three main types. The first is made up of the pestle-shaped form (39) with a long handle and small smooth body (no. 8), which may represent an evolution of the type shown in the coin of Vima Kadphises in which the king appears in the chariot (no. 5). A second type, cylindrical in shape, with small lateral indentations and a thin handle (no. 9) might be derived from the mace shown in nos. 2, 3 and 4; the small, symmetrical side projections might be an extreme stylization of the knots on the Heraclean club. It should be noted, though, that the link between coins 2, 3, 4 and 9 is made up only of the idea of the knots, that are treated in an ever more schematic manner and become a decorative element. In fact, the form of the mace shown in the Huviska coin resembles closely the scepter type, which is the predominant one in the iconography of this ruler, and for which a precedent can be found in the weapon on coin no. 6 of Vima Kadphises. There is also a very characteristic form, made up of superimposed disc-shaped elements, for which one can suppose and Indian origin. Last to be examined is the mace that appears in the statue of Kaniska, discovered in the sanctuary of Mat at Mathur? (fig. 1). As we have already mentioned, the great king holds a sword in his left hand and in his right a long mace, the end of which is resting on the ground. The weapon, which must in reality have been of wood, increases in width from the handle to the extremity, and has its surface divided into various faces that go vertically up the body of the club. It is also surrounded horizontally by five bands which must have been of metal in the real club, and evidently served to make it more solid and robust. The body of the weapon, in the section between the two strips closest to the handle, is almost cylindrical in shape; between the second and fourth strip it has its surface divided into sixteen faces, while the lower section has eight (40). From the lowest strip, decorated with floral or geometrical motifs, there emerges the head of a tnakara of the type elaborated and spread by the school of Mathur? (41). It seems likely that the point of the mace was also (3*) Cf. note 29. (40) J. Ph. Vogel, op. cit., p. 123. (41) Cf. O. Viennot, ? Typologie du makara et essai de Chronologie ?, AA, I, 1954, 3, pp. 193-98; Ph. Stern, ? Les ivoires et os decouverts ? Be? gram: leur place dans revolution de Tart de Fin? de ?, in Nouvelles recherches archeologiques a Be gram (MDAFA, XI), Paris, 1954, pp. 19-54. 255</page><page sequence="9">made of metal and that the head of the makara may have been placed on the juncture between the wooden and metal parts; or so it would seem from the fact that the terminal part of the club, while itself divided into various sections, is realized in a different way from the rest of the weapon. Comparisons for this type, which has no precedents in the iconography of the Kus?na kings, may be found in Indian art of the period immediately after that in which the statue of Kaniska was made, or of later periods. A weapon very similar to that of the great Ku? sana ruler, in both form and technique, appears in the left hand of a dwarf, probably a dv?rap?la in a relief found in the remains of the st?pa of N?g?rjunikonda (fig. 16). The form is that typical of the club; the surface, divided in this case too into various faces, is surrounded by two strips, an obvious reproduction of metal reinforcement, decorated with geometrical motifs. To this there is added a lotus-flower element into which the wooden part is inserted and which forms the connection between the body of the weapon and the handle, the latter bounded by two metallic circles which are also decorated. There are thus very clear resemblances to the mace of Kaniska. Another example of weapon of the same type is found in a relief from Amaravati (42), preserved in the Go? vernment Museum at Madras and dated at about 150 A.D.; it shows on one side the M? tanga J?taka and on the other three dwarf figures, one of which holds a long club. This weapon, smaller, but also reinforced with decorated metal bands, reappears in another relief from N?g?rjunikonda in the Musee Guimet (43), showing a battle-scene. The diffusion of this kind of mace in ?ndhra art is shown not only by the examples mentioned, but also by another relief from N?g?rjunikonda (44), dated at about the 3rd cent. A.D., which shows a battle-scene too; in it the weapon with the characteristic metal rein? forcements appears twice in slightly different forms. A club of the Heraclean type, sur? rounded by thin metallic strips, also appears in one of the hands of Siva, shown with four arms and seated on the bull Nandi in an intaglio in the Pearse Collection, which may go back to the late Kus?na period (45) (fig. 15). This type of weapon must have lasted a very long time in Indian art, as can be seen in a dv?rap?la figure in a relief put at the entrance of a sanctuary cut into the rock at Ku mudian, in southern India. The relief is in the Pallava style and shows the figure leaning with its left arm on a large club, which has a cobra wound around it (fig. 17). In this example, apart from a ring which surrounds the base of the handle, the shaft of the club (evidently of wood in reality) is bound by a single broad and smooth reinforcing strip. It is interesting to note that we see clearly here that the point of the weapon, shown in this relief as an applied (42) C. Sivaramamurti, ?

This iconographic type is widespread in outet India too, where examples very similar to the club of Kaniska can be found (46). Observation of the images of the Kus?na kings shows the constant connection between the mace and kingship. This weapon can also be found in a variety of types that show how the Kus?na assimilated iconographic suggestions from many zones and environments. Probably this alternation of forms not only demonstrates the prevalence of certain figura? tive elements over others, but also registers the influence of various ideological and religious currents on the concept of kingship that was constantly taking on clearer outlines. At the moment, we can note that the powerful but rough club of Heraclean type, which predomi? nates in the images of Vima Kadphises, gives way to the long elaborate club, covered with decorative motifs, of the statue of Kaniska, and lastly to the scepter forms of the coins of Huviska. The weapons shown on both the statue of Kaniska and the coins of Huviska, despite their different forms, demonstrate that they represent models really in use at the time, even if the mace is enriched by decorative elements that clearly make it seem like a ceremonial wea? pon. At this point we must note that the club is found, on Huviska's coins, in the images of gods such as Heracles and Siva too (47), and that these types of weapons are very dif? ferent from those shown in the king's hands. This makes it clear that, while the weight of tradition was definitely felt in religious iconography, in royal images the weapon was slowly being transformed by the need for adapting it to an element connected with the king's figure in real life as well, and therefore subject to faster changes. So it is likely that the form of the mace, whatever the value of this weapon may be, can have derived ? as regards the images of Vima Kadphises ? mainly from the iconography of Heracles; later, however, this element tends to have its own figurative evolution in the field of royal images, in close relation to Indian religious iconography. This series of data, which we get from the examination of some images of Kus?na kings in which the club appears, must not be overlooked when we try to understand the sym? bolical value that was attributed to this weapon. As we have underlined more than once, the first representations of the mace on Ku? s?na coins are undoubtedly linked to the iconography of Heracles. On the other hand, the image of the god and its associations with kingship had a long tradition in the coins of the Greek sovereigns who had governed the regions over which the Kus?na then ex? tended their control, and this tradition connected those kings with the legendary figure of (46) One of the guardians of a monastery south oE Chandi Kalasan (Central Java) has as his attri? butes a serpent, a sword and a mace; the latter, its surface divided into various faces, which are completely decorated, is itself also reinforced by narrow metallic strips; one can also note that the point, also of metal, is applied to the body of the weapon. This image probably dates from the 8th cent. A.D. (A. J. Bernet Kempers, Ancient In? donesian Art, Cambridge (Mass.), 1959, p. 31, pi. 105). A mace with various faces to the surface and metal reinforcements also appears in an image of Visnu from Tjibuaja (Western Java), in Pallava style, preserved in the Djakarta Museum (ibid., p. 31, pi. 23).

The latter, as we know, made his own origins go back to Zeus through He? racles, as a descendant of the Argive Heraclids, and was represented in certain series of coins with the aspect of Heracles (48). Then the god became the dynastic protector of the Eutidemids (49) who in that way linked themselves to the Macedonian conqueror and his divine genealogy, presenting their own sovereignty as a direct continuation of Alexander's and Heracles', both of whom had reigned over India. The image of the god also appears on a type of coin, perhaps posthumous, of Her maios (50), the last Greek king of the Kabul region, with the name of Kuj?la Kadphises; this element once again shows the close connection between the god and kingship, and may reveal an attempt to give a character of legitimacy to the Kus?na rule which had recently been established in that zone. The importance of Heracles as a dynastic divinity, the widespread diffusion of the god's image among which we can distinguish several iconographic types, still cannot fully explain the constant presence of the club in the coins of Vima Kadphises. It is clear that the figure and iconography of the divine hero must have fascinated this great Kus?na ruler, himself a conqueror of India; this is especially clear in coin no. 1. Let us point out, however, that the influence of the images of Heracles almost completely va? nishes where the other coins are concerned; the club remains, though, inserted into a con? text of symbolic elements and religious values completely extraneous to the god's character. This indicates that the king may have linked his own image to that of the hero or even identified himself with Heracles at times; still, since this analogy is not constantly found in his iconography, and is even rather rare, it does not fully explain the presence of the club in his hands. The element that is most frequently associated with the images of the second Kadphises, after that of the mace, is the trident, to which is united the battle-axe, one of Siva's most characteristic attributes (51). Let us recall, in fact, that the reverses of Vima's coins con? stantly show the image of this divinity, and this is a fact that, together with the titles attri? buted to the king in the legends on the coins themselves (52), leads us to think that he was a saiva. It has been pointed out that the Kus?na declared himself a follower of the god (48) Especially on some examples of Panhelle nic series found, according to current opinion, in India. These coins bear on the obverse the head of the hero with the aspect of Heracles, and on the reverse the sitting Zeus Aetoforos; they are almost all later than Alexander. Some coins of Se leucus, issued when he was a satrap, with the effi? gy and name of Alexander, shown as Heracles, are also linked to the Panhellenic series. Cf. M. Th. Allouche Le Page, L'art monetaire des royau mes greco-bactriens, Paris, 1956, pp. 26-28. (4*) Allouche Le Page notes that, while the figure of Zeus is common to both the Eutidemids and the Eucratids, Heracles appears as dynastic protector of the first alone [op. cit., p. 94.

As is known, the club too appears in the iconography of Siva, perhaps even before the Kus?na period. We draw attention, in this regard, on a type of coin of Maues and on the seal of Sivaraksita, already mentioned, where the divinity holding the mace may probably be identified with Siva (54). Another attribute connected with the figure of the god appears in the king's hands: the ankusa or elephant-goad (55). It would only have been natural, granted the religious beliefs of Vima Kadphises, if the images of this god had had a noteworthy influence on the formation of royal Kus?na iconography, which began to take on a definite and precise character just in the representations of this king. We still should not forget that the ico? nography of Siva was itself in formation during this period, and was taking on a precise character in the Kus?na coins. There remains to be explained the reason why certain attributes are associated with both the figure of the king and that of the god, that is, to what kind of cult or speculation familiar to them the Kus?nas linked these attributes. Thus we cannot explain certain aspects of the royal iconography by comparing them with those of Siva, any more than we can do the contrary. As we have already remarked, though, the club seems to be attributed to Siva even in a period precedent to that of Vima's reign, and therefore this element in the images of the king can be linked to both the figure of Heracles and that of the Indian god, or more likely, the images of Heracles exerted an influence on both the formation of Kus?na royal iconography and on that of Siva. This obviously reproposes the problem of the identification of Heracles with Siva. This theory, whose author was Cunningham (56) and that was then accepted by Kennedy (57), is based, as is known, on a passage of Arrian (58), confirmed by Diodorus Siculus and Strabo (59), in which the historian affirms that Alexander's Macedonians recognized the (53) hesychius states: rdvSapo;. 6 TaupoxpdxTjc nap' cIvSot?.

Tarn thinks, though, that anthropomorphic representations of Siva do not appear on coins before the Kus?na period (op. cit., p. 402); according to J. Kennedy too, there is no proof of an association between Siva and the club earlier than the 1st cent. A.D. (?The Child Krishna, Christianity and the Gu jars ?, ]RAS, 1907, p. 967).

The identification of Heracles with Siva represents an attempt to resolve the important problem of the identity of the Indian god whom Megasthenes calls Heracles; this divinity, according to the Greek ambassador, was especially worshipped by the Surasenoi, whose principal centers were Mathur? and "Cleisobora" (61). Other solutions have been proposed for this problem: the oldest is that of Lassen (62), who recognized Krsna, as avat?ra of Visnu, in the Heracles of Megasthenes, while the most recent was formulated by A. Dahlquist (63), who tried to show that the Indian god given the name of Heracles is Indra. This last identification, based on an accurate examination of Greek, Latin and San? skrit sources, seems fairly convincing and would thus exclude the possibility of a relation? ship between Heracles and Siva. It should at any rate be noted that these types of iden? tification, even when their correctness can be proved, should not be taken in a restrictive sense. The attention of the Greeks is usually drawn by exterior characteristics, which lead them to assimilate foreign gods with those of their own pantheon. Nor do such identifi? cations have, on the other hand, a fixed and constant nature once they are established, especially in a period like that of the Kus?na, which sees in the religious field the flower? ing of eclectic and syncretistic tendencies, particularly favorable to the fusion of elements belonging to the mythical cycle and to the philosophical speculations relative to various divinities. Therefore it may be that there is in the coins of Vima Kadphises a connection between the figure of Heracles and that of Siva, which heightens the possibility of one ico? nography having influenced the other. Let us remember, in this regard, that the figure of the Indian god as it appears on the coins of Kadphises II, reveals in the way of treating the body and the wearing of the tiger-skin draped over one arm, the influence of the standing Heracles shown on Indo-Greek coins (64). The connection between the figure of Heracles and the one that appears on the reverse of the coins of Vima Kadphises was underlined by Cunningham, who thought that the divinity represented the god of the Dead, called Gebeleizes or Sapalaises by the Scythians, who identified him with Heracles (fl5). We must point out, though, that the relationship (60) This people has not yet been identified with certainty. W. W. Tarn (op. cit., p. 170) thinks that the Sibi, who lived in the lower Pun? jab and whom Alexander spared because he reco? gnized the descendants of Heracles in them, were confused by the Greek historians with some back? ward tribes that lived in the same territory. Dio dorus (XVII, 96, 2), on the contrary, speaks of their capital as a splendid city. (61) Arrianus, Ind., VIII, 8,4-9,12. (62) C. Lassen, Indische Altertumskunde, Leipzig, 1866-67, 2, p. 1107.

We have already mentioned the fact that this weapon probably appears earlier than the Kus?na period in Siva's iconography; at any rate, the absence of that element in Vima's coins leads us to think that it was not considered one of the god's most characteristic attributes, as was the trident. We have seen, however, that the mace held by the king shows traits clearly taken from Heracles' club. We can therefore end our discussion of this topic by observing that, even if the coins of Vima Kadphises give fairly clear evidence of the existence of links between the figure of Heracles and that of Siva, an association that may have had its effects on the formation of this king's iconography, the mace is related more to the image of Heracles than to that of the Indian god. At the same time, though, the influence of representations of the hero, apart from the resemblance of the club, seems limited to a very few cases. Even further, the mace is also documented in the statue of Kaniska, and with remarkable frequency in the images of Huviska too; these two kings show us in their coins a varied and composite pantheon, which also includes Heracles and Siva, even if these gods do not play an especially prominent part in it. All this leads us to think that the weapon associated with the Kus?na kings' images, even if it shows itself linked in some way with these divine figures, and particularly con? nected from an iconographic point of view with the Heraclean club, probably assumes from the very beginning a broader meaning in connection with the concept of kingship. It must be pointed out that the club ha? the value of a solar symbol in the Iranic world and even represents the weapon of the sun identified with Mithra who holds ? a club with a hundred knots, a hundred edges... a club cast out of red brass, of strong golden brass, the strongest of all weapons, the most victorious of all weapons ?, as Avesta sta? tes (66). The mace has also the value of a solar symbol in Iran when it is shown as the weapon of the kings in the representations of the killing of the lion (67); it also appears as an attribute of the king during the New Year's festival (68). It was then that religious ceremonies were carried out, during which the king impersonated the mythical hero Fa rid?n-Thraetaona, killer of the dragon demon Azi-Dah?ka (6*). According to the myth, the monster held the waters imprisoned, and after his death they were finally freed and flowed Yama and Siva (? Coins of the Kushans... ?, cit.f pp. 58-59). (66) J.

The ceremony ended with the sacred marriage between the king and the wives of the dragon, an act that repeated the hieros gatnos of the hero and symbolized the fertilization of the barren earth (70). A completely similar ceremony took place in India, as the Rg-Veda states, since there too it was one of the king's tasks to assure the fertility of the country by obtaining the be? neficent rain. On the other hand, the myth of the killing of the dragon was well-known in India since it is mentioned in Vedic mythology as the main deed of Indra, who split the bowels of the mountain with the vajra ("), killed Vrta the demon and freed the waters which burst into the canals the god had dug with his thunderbolt (72). As regards the Iranic ceremony, the death of the dragon taking place every year must not only have had the value of a commemoration, but must also have been understood as a magical rite that helped to re-establish the equilibrium of creation menaced by the demon. Thus the mace was the weapon that the king carried on this occasion and the symbol of his function as restorer of cosmic order. E. O. James points out that the ceremony, of Ba? bylonian origin, represented ? the revival of nature... secured by a dramatic reenactment of the primeval cosmic battle against Chaos in order to establish and maintain the orderly se? quence of seasons ? (73). The club also appears in the Parthian Mausoleum of Nisa where we find it shown be? tween two celestial arrows next to a lunar crescent, the latter also between two arrows. Here the club and crescent are elements of a double solar and lunar symbolism (74). In India the mace (gada) is one of the most characteristic attributes of Visnu, another divinity of a solar nature, whose cult is perhaps evidenced by a coin of Huviska, which depicts a god with three heads and four arms; this image, which combines characteristic at? tributes of both Siva and Visnu, has been interpreted by Banerjea (75) as the representation of a composite god similar to the one found on a Gandharan relief showing the Trimurti (76) or that which appears on the above-mentioned Hephthalite seal, on which R. Ghirshman (77) read the names of Mihiro, Visnu and Siva. This also brings to mind the iconographic ana? logies that exist between the mace of Huviska on coin no. 11 (fig. 12) and that of Visnu in the Taxila statue (fig. 13). (70) G. WlDENGREN, loc. cit. (71) The vajra in Indian iconography often ta? kes the shape of a club. See R. N. Banerjea., op. cit., p. 301 ff. On the other hand, the possibility of identifying the weapon of Indra as a club has been sustained by various scholars. For a bibliogra? phy on the subject, see A. Dahlquist, op. cit., pp. 89-90, 153-54. (72) A. A. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, Strassburg, 1947, p. 59.

This is the case with Mithra who, apart from ha? ving the function of supervising justice and watching over the creation of Ahura Mazda, fighting the forces of evil, waits for the souls of the dead who must undergo judgement on the Cinvat bridge together with Rasn and Sraosa (78). Then too, the latter, one of the major gods in the Iranic pantheon (?), also has as an attribute the club with which he defeats the demons who menace the creation of Ahura Mazda, keeps evil away from the just and strikes down the wicked (80). His main function, however, is to hand out prizes and punishments (81) and thus to apply divine justice. The very name of Sraosa seems to come from the Pehlevi sros (punishment) (82). He is also, as we have said, a psychopompous divinity (83). The mace is also an attribute of the Indian god of Death, Yama. In reality, the texts indicate the danda (staff) as proper to this god (84), but a relief from Chidambaram, men? tioned by Rao, shows that the staff can be replaced by the club (85). It was just the pre? sence of this attribute, along with the noose, that led Cunningham to put the figure of OHPO on the Kus?na coins into relation with the god of Death, Yama, called danda-dhara (he who carries the club) (86). The data collected up to this point show that the mace is associated with solar and chthonian divinities in the Iranic and Indian world; as a solar weapon it signifies the struggle against the forces of evil and the preservation of cosmic order, basis of all justice. Bhatta sali notes that in the images of Visnu the mace symbolizes ? eternal law and the unfailing punishment, consequent on its breach... ? and that, according to the only shastric expla? nation of the attributes of Visnu that he was able to find, the weapon is used to destroy evil (87). When it is an attribute of chthonian gods, on the other hand, it represents a symbol of the moral order as an instrument of punishment and guarantee of justice. Manu affirms that the king in his function of witness and judge represents Yama (88). We can there? fore state that the weapon is intimately connected with the idea of justice, as the basis of moral and cosmic order at one and the same time. (78) Yast, X, 103. Grand Bundahisn, Ed.

In regard to the representations of the gada and danda, Banerjea notes that probably no distinction between these two weapons is made, when they appear on Indian coins and seals (89). Dikshitar (90) describes the danda as a robust staff with metal reinforcements at the ends, a detail that not only brings to mind the club of Kaniska, but also other examples examined earlier in this study (fig. 17). M. Th. de Mallmann points out that, according to what the Agni-Pur?na states, the danda can be used as a ?massue de jet ? and that on the other hand the mace and the staff, while showing a morphology that evolved in different ways, must have had the same origin (91). There is special interest in the possibility of understanding danda as both staff and mace. J. Gonda affirms that the staff is a widespread symbol in which there fuse the concepts of sacredness and authority; in India it is the emblem of royalty and also of judicial authority, and represents power, authority and punishment (92). On the other hand the term danda, which also means punishment and rod (an instru? ment of punishment) (93), expresses a basic concept in Indian political philosophy. The Arthas?stra and the Mah?bh?rata speak of dandantti, that is, the art of punishing. The danda is based on discipline, and is necessary for the security of all creatures; it can only be obtained with wisdom and moral discipline and must be distributed without excessive harshness, but also without weakness (94). The king has his danda, which symbolizes royal power and in particular the authority with which he inflicts punishment on the guilty. The Grhyas?tra also refers to the danda as a symbol of power, tied to the idea of punishment (95). So the texts show that this element is strictly associated with the function of judge, which lies in the ruler, and with the art of government. The danda also seems to be connected with one of the highest officials of the Kus?na state, the Mah?dandan?yaka. We cannot establish the exact function of this personage, but from the epigraphic documents it seems evident that this office must have been extremely important. Monuments were erected in honor of men who bore this title, as is shown by an inscription (96) engraved on the pedestal of a statue that must have represented a Kus?na functionary; unfortunately only the feet with the typical felt boots are left. According to the text of the inscription, the personage represented, named Ul?na, held the office of Mah?dandan?yaka (9T). The same title also appears in an inscription dated to year 74 of (89) A. Dahlquist, op. cit., p. 154, translates the word danda as club. (90) V. R. R. Dikshitar, War in Ancient India, Madras, Bombay, Calcutta, London, 1944, p. 108. (91) M.

References to the Mah?? dandan?yaka appear not only in the Kus?na inscriptions, but also in those of the Isv?kus and Guptas, but even these documents do not clarify the function of the personage who bore the title; it would seem that he commanded the dandan?yakas, but we know next to nothing about them either. It is generally thought that the title of Mah?dandan?yaka was used to designate a high military authority: L?ders translated the term as ?Great General? (") and Fleet as ?Great General of Forces? (10?). Let us recall, though, that Prinsep translated the title as ? Ad? ministrator of Punishment ? (101), an interpretation that seems worthy of closer considera? tion. Above all, we know that danda means mainly punishment and rod (instrument of punishment); then too, we should remember that the title of the Commander of the Army was Mah?sen?pati, Among the inscriptions of the Isv?ku kings there is one in which a personage is named who had the titles Mah?dandan?yaka, Mah?sen?pati and Mah?pratih?ra (102); he was ob? viously an official who filled various posts. The title of Mah?pratih?ra is translated as ? Grand Chamberlain ?, but the other two are both translated as ? Commander of the Army ?. It seems strange indeed that the same post should be referred to twice with dif? ferent titles, and thus it is probable that the function of the Mah?dandan?yaka was in some way different from that of the Mah?sen?pati. If we take the meaning of danda into account, the title might indicate a high judicial authority. Sivaramamurti notes that even in our own day judges keep a mace or scepter in front of them as symbol of their function (103). At any rate, it seems likely that the danda, which, as we have seen, can take on the aspect of a mace, was the symbol of the power of the Ma? h?dandan?yaka. The mace held by Kaniska and the other Kus?na rulers might therefore be related to the office and emblem of this high functionary, and might symbolize the su? preme judiciary power inherent in the king. The data presented here has shown that this weapon, so closely linked to the images of the Kus?na kings, is an important symbolic element that can lead to an exact un? derstanding of their idea of kingship. The figurative aspect of the mace shows, at the start, that is, in the images of Vima Kadphises, clearly defined relationships with the knotty club of Heracles; but very soon this form becomes more and more stylized and gives way, in the statue of Kaniska and in the coins of Huviska, to completely different types, probably reproductions of weapons that were really in use.

Sivaramamurti, Le stupa de Barabu dur, Paris, 1961, p. 24. 265</page><page sequence="24">Therefore, if at the beginning the iconography of Heracles had great influence on the formation of a symbolism of kingship, in the period that immediately followed, the repre? sentation of the mace seems completely detached from the imitation of that model, a sure sign that the weapon takes on a specific meaning in regard to the king's image, even apart from any link with this divine figure. On the other hand, in the coins of Vima Kad? phises as well, the club, in spite of the iconographic relationships mentioned before, fits into a type of image which already contains the clear expression of the essential values of Kus?na kingship, which, while showing itself connected to precise religious movements, forms an ideological theme whose meaning is highly particular. This concept sums up a complex of elements which take on in this context universal meaning, whatever their origin may be. It is likely, therefore, that the mace represents a symbol linked to the king's function as universal sovereign, already evident in the images of the second Kadphises, and ever clearer in those of his successors. On the other hand, examination of the data offered us by the Iranic and Indian world leads us to the conclusion that the weapon is a symbol of a cosmological nature. It seems to be associated with solar divinities with the meaning of instrument and guarantee of cosmic order and of a regular rhythm in natural life, un? dermined by the forces of evil, and in that sense it is linked to the figure of the Iranic king too. At the same time, the mace is attributed to chthonian divinities, or at times to both solar and chthonian gods (Heracles, Mithra), and in this case it is a symbol of justice and punish? ment, which guarantee the cosmic order. This association with the concept of justice and the punishment of evil is made clear by the concept of danda, inseparably linked in India to the functions of the king, who is responsible (it is his privilege and supreme duty) for the instauration and the maintenance of cosmic order. Danda and its symbolic meaning are also somehow linked to the office of the Mah?? dandan?yaka, who perhaps represented a high judicial authority. All these elements seem to show that in the royal Kus?na images too the club sym? bolizes the essential function of the king as restorer and tutor of cosmic and moral order, in a conception of universal sovereignty in which the symbol of solar origin finds its most appropriate place. The mace on the statue of Kaniska shows a fine makara head that is probably not only a decorative element, or something which has the exclusive function of increasing the terrify? ing aspect of the weapon, but has itself its own precise meaning connected with that of the club. Let us recall that the makara is linked to the cult of V?sudeva-Visnu (104), a divinity of solar nature, and that it is also the vehicle of Varuna, defined as ? the lord of punish? ment because he holds the sceptre even over the kings ?, according to Gonda; he is also ? the great lord of dharma, the famous protector of rta,... the upholder of order, the ruler of the laws of nature, by whose ordinance the rivers flow and the moon shines ? (105). (104) R. N. Banerjea, op. cit., p. 131. (105) J. Gonda, op. cit., pp. 20, 28. 266</page><page sequence="25">In conclusion, we can state that the mace symbolizes in all probability the mainte? nance and preservation of cosmic and moral order, that is, of justice in the fullest sense of the term, one of the king's highest duties; the Kus?nas probably took this concept from the Iranic world, and it then developed and was enriched by the addition of speculative elements characteristic of the Indian world, with which they soon came into contact, absorb? ing its influence more and more as time passed. Let us note too that the use of the mace as an emblem of kingship probably had a long career. In regard to this weapon on the statue of Kaniska, Vogel (106) mentions the account by Elphinstone (107) of an official appearance of the Amir of Afghanistan, Sh?h Shuj?c; according to this author, he wore a tall hat made of red cloth, decorated with a band of black velvet, and kept in front of him on a cushion a mace, a sword and a carabine. The enormous space of time that separates the period in which the Kus?na empire flourished from that in which the Amir Sh?h Shuj?c lived, clearly prevents us from esta? blishing any connection between the two similar elements, but Elphinstone's description does let us realize that the use of the club as a symbol of kingship must have had good fortune in the very zone in which the Kus?na kings held sway.

Rosenfield, The Dynastic Arts of the Kushans, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1967, in which the author arrives at conclusions similar to those expressed here, in regard to the symbolical value of the mace in the images of the Kus?na kings {pp. 179-181).
