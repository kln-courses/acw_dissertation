<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fourth Discontinuity BRUCE MAZLISH A famous cartoon in The New Yorker magazine shows a large com- puter with two scientists standing excitedly beside it. One of them holds in his hand the tape just produced by the machine, while the other gapes at the message printed on it. In clear letters, it says, "Cogito, ergo sum," the famous Cartesian phrase, "I think, therefore I am." My next cartoon has not yet been drawn. It is a fantasy on my part. In it, a patient, wild of eye and hair on end, is lying on a couch in a psy- chiatrist's office talking to an analyst, who is obviously a machine. The analyst-machine is saying, "Of course I'm human-aren't you?"1 These two cartoons are a way of suggesting the threat which the in- creasingly perceived continuity between man and the machine poses to us today. It is with this topic that I wish to deal now, approaching it in terms of what I shall call the "fourth discontinuity." In order, however, to explain what I mean by the "fourth discontinuity," I must first place the term in a historical context. DR. MAZLISH, professor of history at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the coauthor, with J. Bronowski, of The Western Intellectual Tradition. His most recent book is The Riddle of History: The Great Speculators from Vico to Freud. 1 After finishing the early drafts of this article, I secured unexpected confirma- tion of my "fantasy" concerning an analyst-machine (which is not, in itself, critical to my thesis). A story in the New York Times, March 12, 1965, reports that "a computerized typewriter has been credited with remarkable success at a hospital here in radically improving the condition of several children suffering an extreme- ly severe form of childhood schizophrenia .... What has particularly amazed a number of psychiatrists is that the children's improvement occurred without psy- chotherapy; only the machine was involved. It is almost as much human as it is machine. It talks, it listens, it responds to being touched, it makes pictures or charts, it comments and explains, it gives information and can be set up to do all this in any order. In short, the machine attempts to combine in a sort of science-fiction instrument all the best of two worlds-human and machine. It is called an Edison Responsive Environment Learning System. It is an extremely sophisticated 'talk- ing' typewriter (a cross between an analogue and digital computer) that can teach children how to read and write.... Dr. Campbell Goodwin speculates that the machine was able to bring the autistic children to respond because it eliminated humans as communication factors. Once the children were able to communicate, something seemed to unlock in their minds, apparently enabling them to carry out further normal mental activities that had eluded them earlier." 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Bruce Mazlish In the eighteenth lecture of his General Introduction to Psychoanaly- sis, originally delivered at the University of Vienna between 1915 and 1917, Freud suggested his own place among the great thinkers of the past who had outraged man's naive self-love. First in the line was Co- pernicus, who taught that our earth "was not the center of the universe, but only a tiny speck in a world-system of a magnitude hardly conceiv- able." Second was Darwin, who "robbed man of his peculiar privilege of having been specially created, and relegated him to a descent from the animal world." Third, now, was Freud himself. On his own account, Freud admitted, or claimed, that psychoanalysis was "endeavoring to prove to the 'ego' of each one of us that he is not even master in his own house, but that he must remain content with the veriest scraps of infor- mation about what is going on unconsciously in his own mind." A little later in 1917, Freud repeated his sketch concerning the three great shocks to man's ego. In his short essay, "A Difficulty in the Path of Psychoanalysis," he again discussed the cosmological, biological, and now psychological blows to human pride and, when challenged by his friend Karl Abraham, admitted, "You are right in saying that the enu- meration of my last paper may give the impression of claiming a place beside Copernicus and Darwin."2 There is some reason to believe that Freud may have derived his con- viction from Ernst Haeckel, the German exponent of Darwinism, who in his book Natiirliche Schbpfungsgeschichte (1889) compared Dar- win's achievement with that of Copernicus and concluded that together they had helped remove the last traces of anthropomorphism from sci- ence.3 Whatever the origin of Freud's vision of himself as the last in the line of ego-shatterers, his assertion has been generally accepted by those, like Ernest Jones, who refer to him as the "Darwin of the Mind."4 The most interesting extension of Freud's self-view, however, has come from the American psychologist, Jerome Bruner. Bruner's version of what Freud called his "transvaluation" is in terms of the elimination of discontinuities, where discontinuity means an emphasis on breaks or gaps in the phenomena of nature-for example, a stress on the sharp dif- ferences between physical bodies in the heavens or on earth or between one form of animal matter and another-instead of an emphasis on its continuity. Put the other way, the elimination of discontinuity, that is, 2Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (3 vols.; New York, 1953-57), II, 224-26. 3 Ernst Cassirer, The Problem of Knowledge: Philosophy, Science, and History since Hegel, trans.

Hendel (New Haven, Conn., 1950), p. 160. 4 Jones, III, 304.</page><page sequence="3">The Fourth Discontinuity the establishment of a belief in a continuum of nature, can be seen as the creation of continuities, and this is the way Bruner phrases it. According to Bruner, the first continuity was established by the Greek physicist- philosophers of the sixth century, rather than by Copernicus. Thus, thinkers like Anaximander conceived of the phenomena of the physical world as "continuous and monistic, as governed by the common laws of matter."5 The creating of the second continuity, that between man and the animal kingdom was, of course, Darwin's contribution, a necessary condition for Freud's work. With Freud, according to Bruner, the fol- lowing continuities were established: the continuity of organic lawful- ness, so that "accident in human affairs was no more to be brooked as 'explanation' than accident in nature"; the continuity of the primitive, infantile, and archaic as co-existing with the civilized and evolved; and the continuity between mental illness and mental health. In this version of the three historic ego-smashings, man is placed on a continuous spectrum in relation to the universe, to the rest of the animal kingdom, and to himself. He is no longer discontinuous with the world around him. In an important sense, it can be contended, once man is able to accept this situation, he is in harmony with the rest of exist- ence. Indeed, the longing of the early nineteenth-century romantics, and of all "alienated" beings since, for a sense of "connection" is fulfilled in an unexpected manner. Yet, to use Bruner's phraseology, though not his idea, a fourth and major discontinuity, or dichotomy, still exists in our time. It is the dis- continuity between man and machine. In fact, my thesis is that this fourth discontinuity must now be eliminated-indeed, we have started on the task-and that in the process man's ego will have to undergo an- other rude shock, similar to those administered by Copernicus (or Gali- leo), Darwin, and Freud. To put it bluntly, we are now coming to real- ize that man and the machines he creates are continuous and that the same conceptual schemes, for example, that help explain the workings of 5 For Bruner's views, see his "Freud and the Image of Man," Partisan Review, XXIII, No. 3 (Summer 1956), 340-47. In place of both Bruner's sixth-century Greek physicists and Freud's Copernicus, I would place Galileo as the breaker of the discontinuity that was thought to exist in the material world. It was Galileo, after all, who first demonstrated that the heavenly bodies are of the same substance as the "imperfect" earth and subject to the same mechanical laws. In his Dialogue on the Two Principal World Systems (1632), he not only supported the "world system" of Copernicus against Ptolemy but established that our "world," i.e., the earth, is a natural part of the other "world," i.e., the solar system. Hence, the universe at large is one "continuous" system, a view at best only implied in Coper- nicus. Whatever the correct attribution, Greek physicists, Copernicus, or Galileo, Freud's point is not in principle affected. 3</page><page sequence="4">4 Bruce Mazlish his brain also explain the workings of a "thinking machine." Man's pride, and his refusal to acknowledge this continuity, is the substratum upon which the distrust of technology and an industrialized society has been reared. Ultimately, I believe, this last rests on man's refusal to under- stand and accept his own nature-as a being continuous with the tools and machines he constructs. Let me now try to explain what is involved in this fourth discontinuity. * * * The evidence seems strong today that man evolved from the other animals into humanity through a continuous interaction of tool, physi- cal, and mental-emotional changes. The old view that early man arrived on the evolutionary scene, fully formed, and then proceeded to discover tools and the new ways of life which they made possible is no longer acceptable. As Sherwood L. Washburn, professor of anthropology at the University of California, puts it, "From the rapidly accumulating evidence it is now possible to speculate with some confidence on the manner in which the way of life made possible by tools changed the pressures of natural selection and so changed the structure of man." The details of Washburn's argument are fascinating, with its linking of tools with such physical traits as pelvic structure, bipedalism, brain structure, and so on, as well as with the organization of men in co-operative socie- ties and the substitution of morality for hormonal control of sexual and other "social" activities. Washburn's conclusion is that "it was the suc- cess of the simplest tools that started the whole trend of human evolu- tion and led to the civilizations of today."6 Darwin, of course, had had a glimpse of the role of tools in man's evolution.7 It was Karl Marx, however, who first placed the subject in a new light. Accepting Benjamin Franklin's definition of man as a "tool- making animal," Marx suggested in Das Kapital that "the relics of the instruments of labor are of no less importance in the study of vanished socio-economic forms, than fossil bones are in the study of the organ- ization of extinct species." As we know, Marx wished to dedicate his great work to Darwin-a dedication rejected by the cautious biologist- and we can see part of Marx's reason for this desire in the following revealing passage: 6 "Tools and Human Evolution," Scientific American, CCIII, No. 3 (September 1960), 63-75. 7 E.g., see Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man (New York, n.d.), pp. 431-32, 458.</page><page sequence="5">The Fourth Discontinuity Darwin has aroused our interest in the history of natural tech- nology, that is to say in the origin of the organs of plants and ani- mals as productive instruments utilised for the life purposes of those creatures. Does not the history of the origin of the productive organs of men in society, the organs which form the material basis of every kind of social organisation, deserve equal attention? Since, as Vico [in the New Science (1725)] says, the essence of the dis- tinction between human history and natural history is that the for- mer is the work of man and the latter is not, would not the history of human technology be easier to write than the history of natural technology? Technology reveals man's dealings with nature, dis- closes the direct productive activities of his life, thus throwing light upon social relations and the resultant mental conceptions.8 Only a dogmatic anti-Marxist could deny that Marx's brilliant imag- ination had led him to perceive a part of the continuity between man and his tools. Drawn off the track, perhaps, by Vico's distinction be- tween human and natural history as man-made and God-made, Marx might almost be given a place in the pantheon of Copernicus, Darwin, and Freud as a destroyer of man's discontinuities with the world about him. Before our present-day anthropologists, Marx had sensed the un- breakable connection between man's evolution as a social being and his development of tools. He did not sense, however, the second part of our subject, that man and his tools, especially in the form of modern, com- plicated machines, are part of a theoretical continuum. * * * The locus classicus of the modern insistence on the fourth discon- tinuity is, as is well known, the work of Descartes. In his Discourse on Method, for example, he sets up God and the soul on one side, as with- out spatial location or extension, and the material-mechanical world in all its aspects, on the other side. Insofar as man's mind or soul partici- pates in reason-which means God's reason-man knows this division or dualism of mind and matter, for, as Descartes points out, man could not know this fact from his mere understanding, which is based solely on his senses, "a location where it is clearly evident that the ideas of God and the soul have never been."9 8 Italics mine; Karl Marx, Capital, trans.

He conjures up a world in imaginary space and shows that it must run according to known natural laws. Similarly, he imagines that "God formed the body of a man just like our own, both in the external configuration of its members and in the internal configuration of its organs, without using in its composition any matter but that which I had described [i.e., physical matter]. I also assumed that God did not put into this body any rational soul [defined by Des- cartes as "that part of us distinct from the body whose essence .. is only to think"]." Analyzing this purely mechanical man, Descartes boasts of how he has shown "what changes must take place in the brain to cause wake- fulness, sleep, and dreams; how light, sounds, odors, taste, heat, and all the other qualities of external objects can implant various ideas through the medium of the senses ... I explained what must be understood by that animal sense which receives these ideas, by memory which retains them, and by imagination which can change them in various ways and build new ones from them." In what way, then, does such a figure differ from real man? Descartes confronts his own created "man" forthrightly; it is worth quoting the whole of his statement: Here I paused to show that if there were any machines which had the organs and appearance of a monkey or of some other un- reasoning animal, we would have no way of telling that it was not of the same nature as these animals. But if there were a machine which had such a resemblance to our bodies, and imitated our actions as far as possible, there would always be two absolutely certain methods of recognizing that it was still not truly a man. The first is that it could never use words or other signs for the purpose of communicating its thoughts to others, as we do. It indeed is conceivable that a machine could be so made that it would utter words, and even words appropriate to physical acts which cause some change in its organs; as, for example, if it was touched in some spot that it would ask what you wanted to say to it; if in another, that it would cry that it was hurt, and so on for similar things. But it could never modify its phrases to reply to the sense of whatever was said in its presence, as even the most stupid men can do. The second method of recognition is that although such machines could do many things as well as, or perhaps even better than, men, they would infallibly fail in certain others, by which we would discover that they did not act by understanding, but only by the disposition of their organs. For while reason is a universal instrument which can be used in all sorts of situations, the organs</page><page sequence="7">The Fourth Discontinuity 7 have to be arranged in a particular way for each particular action. From this it follows that it is morally impossible that there should be enough different devices in a machine to make it behave in all the occurrences of life as our reason makes us behave. Put in its simplest terms, Descartes' two criteria for discriminating between man and the machine are that the latter has (1) no feedback mechanism ("it could never modify its phrases") and (2) no generaliz- ing reason ("reason is a universal instrument which can be used in all sorts of situations"). But it is exactly in these points that, today, we are no longer able so surely to sustain the dichotomy. The work of Nor- bert Wiener and his followers, in cybernetics, indicates what can be done on the problem of feedback. Investigations into the way the brain itself forms concepts are basic to the attempt to build computers that can do the same, and the two efforts are going forward simultaneously, as in the work of Dr. W. K. Taylor of University College, London, and of others. As G. Rattray Taylor sums up the matter: "One can't there- fore be quite as confident that computers will one day equal or surpass man in concept-forming ability as one can about memory, since the trick hasn't yet been done; but the possibilities point that way."10 In short, the gap between man's thinking and that of his thinking ma- chines has been greatly narrowed by recent research. Descartes, of course, would not have been happy to see such a de- velopment realized. To eliminate the dichotomy or discontinuity be- tween man and machines would be, in effect, to banish God from the universe. The rational soul, Descartes insisted, "could not possibly be derived from the powers of matter . . .but must have been specially created." Special creation requires God, for Descartes' reasoning is cir- cular. The shock to man's ego, of learning the Darwinian lesson that he was not "specially created," is, in this light, only an outlying tremor of the great earthquake that threatened man's view of God as well as of himself. The obstacles to removing not only the first three but also the fourth discontinuity are, clearly, deeply imbedded in man's pride of place. How threatening these developments were can be seen in the case of Descartes' younger contemporary, Blaise Pascal. Aware that man is "a thinking reed," Pascal also realized that he was "engulfed in the in- finite immensity of spaces whereof I know nothing, and which knows nothing of me." "I am terrified," he confessed. To escape his feeling of terror, Pascal fled from reason to faith, convinced that reason could 10 See G.

Taylor and others.</page><page sequence="8">8 Bruce Mazlish not bring him to God. Was he haunted by his own construction, at age nineteen, of a calculating machine which, in principle, anticipated the modern digital computer? By his own remark that "the arithmetical machine produces effects which approach nearer to thought than all the actions of animals"? Ultimately, to escape the anxiety that filled his soul, Pascal commanded, "On thy knees, powerless reason."1l Others, of course, walked where angels feared to tread. Thus, sensa- tionalist psychologists and epistemologists, like Locke, Hume, or Con- dillac, without confronting the problem head on, treated the contents of man's reason as being formed by his sense impressions. Daring think- ers, like La Mettrie in his L'Homme machine (1747) and Holbach, went all the way to a pure materialism. As La Mettrie put it in an anticipatory transcendence of the fourth discontinuity, "I believe thought to be so little incompatible with organized matter that it seems to be a property of it, like Electricity, Motive Force, Impenetrability, Extension, etc."12 On the practical front, largely leaving aside the metaphysical aspects of the problem, Pascal's work on calculating machines was taken up by those like the eccentric nineteenth-century mathematician Charles Babbage, whose brilliant designs outran the technology available to him.l3 Thus it remained for another century, the twentieth, to bring the matter to a head and to provide the combination of mathematics, ex- perimental physics, and modern technology that created the machines that now confront us and that reawaken the metaphysical question. * * * The implications of the metaphysical question are clear. Man feels threatened by the machine, that is, by his tools writ large, and feels out of harmony with himself because he is out of harmony-what I have called discontinuous-with the machines that are part of himself. Today, it is fashionable to describe such a state by the term "alienation." In the Marxist phraseology, we are alienated from ourselves when 11 For details, see J. Bronowski and Bruce Mazlish, The Western Intellectual Tradition: From Leonardo to Hegel (New York, 1960), pp. 233-41. 12 See Stephen Toulmin, "The Importance of Norbert Wiener," New York Re- view of Books, September 24, 1964, p. 4, for an indication of La Mettrie's impor- tance in this development. While Toulmin does not put his material in the context of the fourth discontinuity, I find we are in fundamental agreement about what is afoot in this matter. 13 See Philip and Emily Morrison (eds.), Charles Babbage and His Calculating Engines (New York, 1961).</page><page sequence="9">The Fourth Discontinuity we place false gods or economies over us and then behave as if they had a life of their own, eternal and independent of ourselves, and, in- deed, in control of our lives. My point, while contact can be established between it and the notion of alienation, is a different one. It is in the tradition of Darwin and Freud, rather than of Marx, and is concerned more with man's ego than with his sense of alienation. A brief glimpse at two "myths" concerning the machine may illumi- nate what I have in mind. The first is Samuel Butler's negative utopia, Erewhon, and the second is Mary Shelley's story of Frankenstein. In Butler's novel, published in 1872, we are presented with Luddism car- ried to its final point. The story of the Erewhonian revolution against the machines is told in terms of a purported translation from a manu- script, "The Book of the Machines," urging men on to the revolt and supposedly written just before the long civil war between the machinists and the antimachinists, in which half the population was destroyed. The prescient flavor of the revolutionary author's fears can be caught in such passages as follows:14 "There is no security"-to quote his own words-"against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now. A mollusc has not much consciousness. Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing. The more highly organized machines are creatures not so much of yesterday as of the last five minutes, so to speak, in comparison with past time. Assume for the sake of argument that conscious beings have existed for some twenty million years: see what strides machines have made in the last thousand! May not the world last twenty million years longer? If so, what will they not in the end become? Is it not safer to nip the mischief in the bud and to forbid them further progress? "But who can say that the vapour-engine has not a kind of consciousness? Where does consciousness begin, and where end? Who can draw the line? Who can draw any line? Is not everything interwoven with everything? Is not machinery linked with animal life in an infinite variety of ways? The shell of a hen's egg is made of a delicate white ware and is a machine as much as an egg-cup is; the shell is a device for holding the egg as much as the egg-cup for holding the shell: both are phases of the same function; the hen makes the shell in her inside, but it is pure pottery. She makes her nest outside of herself for convenience' sake, but the nest is 14The quotations that follow are from Samuel Butler, Erewhon (Baltimore, 1954), pp. 161, 164, 167-68, and 171. 9</page><page sequence="10">10 Bruce Mazlish not more of a machine than the egg-shell is. A 'machine' is only a 'device.'" Then he continues: "Do not let me be misunderstood as living in fear of any actually existing machine; there is probably no known machine which is more than a prototype of future mechanical life. The present machines are to the future as the early Saurians to man. The largest of them will probably greatly diminish in size. Some of the lowest vertebrata attained a much greater bulk than has descended to their more highly organized living representatives, and in like manner a diminution in the size of machines has often attended their development and progress." Answering the argument that the machine, even when more fully developed, is merely man's servant, the writer contends: "But the servant glides by imperceptible approaches into the master; and we have come to such a pass that, even now, man must suffer terribly on ceasing to benefit the machines.. . . Man's very soul is due to the machines; it is a machine-made thing; he thinks as he thinks, and feels as he feels, through the work that machines have wrought upon him, and their existence is quite as much a sine qua non for his, as his for theirs. This fact precludes us from proposing the complete annihilation of machinery, but surely it indicates that we should destroy as many of them as we can pos- sibly dispense with, lest they should tyrannize over us even more completely." And, finally, the latent sexual threat is dealt with: "It is said by some with whom I have conversed upon this sub- ject, that the machines can never be developed into animate or quasi-animate existences, inasmuch as they have no reproductive systems, nor seem ever likely to possess one. If this be taken to mean that they cannot marry, and that we are never likely to see a fertile union between two vapour-engines with the young ones playing about the door of the shed, however greatly we might de- sire to do so, I will readily grant it. But the objection is not a very profound one. No one expects that all the features of the now existing organizations will be absolutely repeated in an entirely new class of life. The reproductive system of animals differs widely from that of plants, but both are reproductive systems. Has nature exhausted her phases of this power?" Inspired by fears such as these, which sound like our present realities, the Erewhonians rise up and destroy almost all their machines. It is only years after this supposed event that they are sufficiently at ease</page><page sequence="11">The Fourth Discontinuity so as to collect the fragmentary remains, the "fossils," of the now de- funct machines and place them in a museum. At this point, the reader is never sure whether Butler's satire is against Darwin or the anti- Darwinists, probably both, but there is no question of the satire when he tells us how machines were divided into "their genera, subgenera, species, varieties, subvarieties, and so forth" and how the Erewhonians "proved the existence of connecting links between machines that seemed to have very little in common, and showed that many more such links had existed, but had now perished." It is as if Butler had taken Marx's point about human technology and stood it on its head! Going even further, Butler foresaw the threatened ending of the fourth discontinuity, just as he saw Darwin's work menacing the third of the discontinuities we have discussed. Thus, we find Butler declaring, in the guise of his Erewhonian author, "I shrink with as much horror from believing that my race ever be superseded or sur- passed, as I should do from believing that even at the remotest period my ancestors were other than human beings. Could I believe that ten hundred thousand years ago a single one of my ancestors was another kind of being to myself, I should lose all self-respect, and take no fur- ther pleasure or interest in life. I have the same feeling with regard to my descendants and believe it to be one that will be felt so generally that the country will resolve upon putting an immediate stop to all further mechanical progress, and upon destroying all improvements that have been made for the last three hundred years." The counter- argument, that "machines were to be regarded as a part of man's own physical nature, being really nothing but extra-corporeal limbs. Man [is] a machinate mammal," is dismissed out of hand. Many of these same themes-the servant-machine rising against its master, the fear of the machine reproducing itself (fundamentally, a sexual fear, as Caliban illustrates, and as our next example will show), the terror, finally, of man realizing that he is at one with the machine-can be found attached to an earlier myth, that of Frankenstein. Now passed into our folklore, people frequently give little attention to the actual details of the novel. First, the name Frankenstein is often given to the monster created, rather than to its creator; yet, in the book, Franken- stein is the name of the scientist, and his abortion has no name. Second, the monster is not a machine but a "flesh and blood" product; even so informed a student as Oscar Handlin makes the typical quick shift, in an echo of Butler's fears, when he says, "The monster, however, quickly proves himself the superior. In the confrontation, the machine gives the orders."15 Third, and last, it is usually forgotten or over- 15 "Science and Technology in Popular Culture," Daedalus (Winter 1965), p. 163. 11</page><page sequence="12">12 Bruce Mazlish looked that the monster turns to murder because his creator, horrified at his production, refuses him human love and kindness. Let us look at a few of the details. In writing her "Gothic" novel in 1816-17, Mary Shelley gave it the subtitle, "The Modern Prometheus."'6 We can see why if we remember that Prometheus defied the gods and gave fire to man. Writing in the typical early nineteenth-century romantic vein, Mary Shelley offers Frankenstein as an example of "how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge"; in this case, specifically, the capability of "bestowing ani- mation upon lifeless matter." In the novel we are told of how, having collected his materials from "the dissecting room and the slaughter- house" (as Wordsworth has said of modern science, "We murder to dissect"), Frankenstein eventually completes his loathsome task when he infuses "a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet." Then, as he tells us, "now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart." Rushing from the room. Frankenstein goes to his bedchamber, where he has a most odd dream concerning the corpse of his dead mother-the whole book as well as this passage cries out for psychoanalytic interpretation -from which he is awakened by "the wretch-the miserable monster whom I had created." Aghast at the countenance of what he has created, Frankenstein escapes from the room and out into the open. Upon finally returning to his room with a friend, he is relieved to find the monster gone. To understand the myth, we need to recite a few further details in this weird, and rather badly written, story. Frankenstein's monster eventually finds his way to a hovel attached to a cottage, occupied by a blind father and his son and daughter. Unperceived by them, he learns the elements of social life (the fortuitous ways in which this is made to occur may strain the demanding reader's credulity), even to the point of reading Paradise Lost. Resolved to end his unbearable solitude, the monster, convinced that his virtues of the heart will win over the cottagers, makes his presence known. The result is predictable: horrified by his appearance, they duplicate the behavior of his creator, and flee. In wrath, the monster turns against the heartless world. He kills, and his first victim, by accident, is Frankenstein's young brother. Pursued by Frankenstein, a confrontation between creator and created takes place, and the monster explains his road to murder. He appeals to Frankenstein in a torrential address: 16 The quotations that follow are from Mary Shelley, Frankenstein (New York, 1953), pp. 30-33, 36-37, 85, and 160-61.</page><page sequence="13">The Fourth Discontinuity "I entreat you to hear me, before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough that you seek to increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumu- lation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine; my joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king, if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other, and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection is most due. Remember, that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drives from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrev- ocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous." Eventually, the monster extracts from Frankenstein a promise to create a partner for him "of another sex," with whom he will then retire into the vast wilds of South America, away from the world of men. But Frankenstein's "compassion" does not last long. In his labo- ratory again, Frankenstein indulges in a long soliloquy: "I was now about to form another being, of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate; and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighborhood of man, and hide himself in deserts; but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species. "Even if they were to leave Europe, and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the demon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?" With the monster observing him through the window, Frankenstein destroys the female companion on whom he had been working. With 13</page><page sequence="14">14 Bruce Mazlish this, the novel relentlessly winds its way to its end. In despair and out of revenge, the monster kills Frankenstein's best friend, Clerval, then Frankenstein's new bride, Elizabeth. Fleeing to the frozen north, the monster is tracked down by Frankenstein (shades of Moby Dick?), who dies, however, before he can destroy him. But it does not matter; the monster wishes his own death and promises to place himself on a funeral pile and thus at last secure the spiritual peace for which he has yearned. I have summarized the book because I suspect that few readers will actually be acquainted with the myth of Frankenstein as written by Mary Shelley. For most of us, Frankenstein is Boris Karloff, clumping around stiff, automatic, and threatening: a machine of sorts. We shall have forgotten completely, if ever we knew, that the monster, cum machine, is evil, or rather, becomes evil, only because it is spurned by man. * * My thesis has been that man is on the threshold of breaking past the discontinuity between himself and machines. In one part, this is because man now can perceive his own evolution as inextricably inter- woven with his use and development of tools, of which the modern machine is only the furthest extrapolation. We cannot think any longer of man without a machine. In another part, this is because mod- ern man perceives that the same scientific concepts help explain the workings of himself and of his machines and that the evolution of matter-from the basic building blocks of hydrogen turning into helium in the distant stars, then fusing into carbon nuclei and on up to iron, and then exploding into space, which has resulted in our solar system- continues on earth in terms of the same carbon atoms and their intricate patterns into the structure of organic life. And now into the archi- tecture of our thinking machines. It would be absurd, of course, to contend that there are no differences between man and machines. This would be the same reductio ad absurdum as involved in claiming that, because he is an animal, there is no difference between man and the other animals. The matter, of course, is one of degree.17 What is claimed here is that the sharp discon- 17 In semi-facetious fashion, I have argued with some of my more literal-minded friends that what distinguishes man from existing machines, and probably will always so distinguish him, is an effective Oedipus complex: vive la difference! For an excellent and informed philosophical treatment of the difference between man and machines, see J. Bronowski, The Identity of Man (Garden City, N.Y., 1965).</page><page sequence="15">The Fourth Discontinuity 15 tinuity between man and machines is no longer tenable, in spite of the shock to our egos. Scientists, today, know this; the public at large does not, New Yorker cartoons to the contrary.l8 Moreover, this change in our metaphysical awareness, this transcend- ence of the fourth discontinuity, is essential to our harmonious accept- ance of an industrialized world. The alternatives are either a frightened rejection of the "Frankensteins" we have created or a blind belief in their "superhuman virtues" and a touching faith that they can solve all our human problems. Alas, in the perspective I have suggested, machines are "mechanical, all too mechanical," to paraphrase Nietzsche. But, in saying this, I have already also said that they are "all too human" as well. The question, then, is whether we are to repeat the real Frank- enstein story and, turning from the "monsters" we have created, turn aside at the same time from our own humanity or, alternatively, whether we are to accept the blow to our egos and enter into a world beyond the fourth discontinuity? 18 As in so much else, children "know" what their parents have forgotten. As 0. Mannoni tells us, in the course of explaining totemism, "children, instead of treating animals as machines, treat machines as living things, the more highly prized because they are easier to appropriate. Children's appropriation is a virtual identi- fication and they play at being machines (steam-engines, motor cars, aeroplanes) just as 'primitive' people play at being the totem [animal]" (Prospero and Caliban, The Psychology of Colonization, trans. Pamela Powesland [New York, 1964], p. 82). In Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain puts this "identification" to work in de- scribing Tom Sawyer's friend, Ben Rogers: "He was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As he drew near, he slack- ened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance-for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them! . . . 'Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling! Chow-ow-aw! Get out that head-line! Lively now! Come-out with your spring-line-what're you about there! Take a turn round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now-let her go! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling! sh't! sh't! sh't!"' See the analysis of this passage in Erik H. Erikson, Childhood and Society (2d ed.; New York, 1963), pp. 209ff.</page></plain_text>
