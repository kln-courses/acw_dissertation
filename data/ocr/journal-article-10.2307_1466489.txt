<plain_text><page sequence="1">AAR 2002 PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS Embodied Cosmologies: Sights of Piety, Sites of Power Vasudha Narayanan Epistemic pluralism is not only limited to gender, class, and race but also to different ways of apprehension, different ways of knowing. Dances, temples, cities, medical therapies, and so on are embodied ways in which knowledge was transmitted in precolonial cultures and still continues to be transmitted in many diasporic realms. The privileging of the written text and beliefs by dominant, hegemonic cultures has led to the marginalization of other ways of knowing, other sources of knowledge. By decolonizing methodologies, by dismantling the authority paradigms based on texts alone, and by understanding indigenous knowledge systems that may over- lap like the fields of a Venn diagram in some cultures, we begin to explore the intersection of "globalization past" with "globalization present." The lived experience, the experiences of space and time through performing arts, art and architecture, and food are all significant and not just in the department of anthropology or in the school of fine arts. These are all very Vasudha Narayanan is a professor in the Department of Religion at the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-7410.

I argue for valoriz- ing what we call interdisciplinary and multidisciplinarymethods and for look- ing beyond traditional Eurocentric constructions of fields and disciplines. IN THE TRADITION OF THE CULTURE I come from, I would like to start with a narrative. Any self-respecting story in the Hindu epics will be a boxed one; that is, there is a metastory that will lead into another story, within which we may find yet another one. The first story is about two thousand years old and begins with the origins of natya, a word that in modern Indian languages usually refers to dance but which technically includes dance, drama, and music. Atreya and other sages went to the scholar and writer Bharata and asked him about his new book, the Natya Veda or the Knowledge of Dance and Drama. The sages said, "Your book is said to be well composed and equal to the Vedas. Tell us, why did you write it, and whom did you write it for? What are the secondary themes? In what way is it authoritative? What are the applications?" In short, the deconstruction of the text began the minute it was finished. Bharata said, "Natya began with the creator god Brahma. Let me tell you the story." Long ago, he told them, the people of the world were filled with greed and avarice and took to vulgar ways of living. The many gods, led by Indra, went to Brahma and said: "Can you give us something that is educational but which is easy on the eyes and ears? Can you create a fifth text that is accessible to all classes of society?" Brahma agreed and, after some meditation, decided to create a fifth Veda that would be open and accessible to all. He did this by taking the words from the Rig Veda; the music from the Sama Veda; the movements, ritual, and makeup from the Yajur Veda; and the emotional acting from the Atharva Veda. Brahma then gave this dance and drama to Indra and said that it had to be practiced by those who were smart, intelligent, observant, and self-controlled. Indra then transmitted the art to Bharata. The name Bharata itself is seen by people today as being an acronym of three words: "bha" from bhava or expression, "ra" for raga or melody, and "ta" for tala or rhythm. He taught the movements to his sons. Something was lacking; it was lacking in grace. So Bharata told Brahma that it would be great if women could perform to music. Brahma then created the celestial dancers, the apsaras, and other men and women to sing and play instruments. The prepa- rations were complete, and the dancers were ready to perform. To protect the dancers and the performance, a proper stage was erected. A whole chapter in Bharata's book of dance focuses on the kind of site to be selected and details of its construction-the shape, the dimensions, the length and depth-all in accordance with how the divine architect or- dained. Later texts on dance specify the directions in which the stage</page><page sequence="3">Narayanan: Embodied Cosmologies 497 should be aligned and even note that the person who presides over the ceremonies should face east. The important points of the construction schedule should coincide with astrologically propitious moments. Such details are significant in orienting the stage-which itself is a kind of temple-in harmony with the cosmos. We are already into chapter 4 of Bharata's book of dance when we hear about the first play that was performed. This first play is the story of the churning of the ocean of milk. This story was chosen specifically because it was said to be of a genre called samavakaara, that is, it en- lightens the audience about dharma (righteousness), prosperity (artha), and desire (kama). The initial performance was so successful that they decided to perform it for Lord Shiva. There, on the slopes of the Hima- layan mountains, in a valley filled with beautiful streams, in a place sur- rounded by hills and groves, the play was performed. Seeing this play, Shiva was so pleased that he shared his skills of dancing-the gestures, the mudras, and so on-with them (adapted from Rangacharya: 1-23; see also Nandikesvara: 36-39; Sathyanarayana: 176-190). And what is the theme of the play that was performed? It is a story about Vishnu's incarnation as a tortoise, a story very well known in India and in Southeast Asia. It occurs in many Hindu texts, is sculpted in scores of temples, and is danced by every major Indian dance company today. The brief version of the story is as follows: The devas (celestial beings, gods) were being harassed by the asuras or demons. They went to Vishnu for help. Vishnu told them that they should seek the help of their enemies and, together, they should churn the great ocean of milk to get amrita, the nectar of immortality. When the gods were less than enthusiastic about the demons getting a share of the stuff that will make them immortal, Vishnu smiled and told them that he would eventually make sure that does not happen. The devas and the demons brought Mount Mandara and used it as the churning rod. They tied a huge snake, the serpent Vasuki, around the mountain to be the rope and started to pull on either side. The mountain began to sink to the ground. Vishnu, to save this enterprise, incarnated himself as a giant tortoise, dived into the ocean of milk, and held the mountain on his back. He also, in his anthropomorphic form, sat on top of the mountain, balancing it. Out of this churning came a violent poison; Lord Shiva swallowed it to save everyone. The poison made his neck blue in color. And then from the ocean came the real rewards: Surabhi, the wish-fulfilling cow; Parijata, the tree with fragrant blossoms; the apsarases or the celestial dancers; Sri or Lakshmi, the goddess of all good fortune and prosperity; and finally, Dhanvantari, the divine physician, holding the jar of amrita, the nectar of immortality. The gods and demons share the goodies. Sri, the goddess, however, is her own agent. No god or demon could claim her; she looked</page><page sequence="4">498 Journal of the American Academy of Religion at all of them and decided that Vishnu alone was worthy of being her husband. The story continues with the distribution of the nectar to the devas and their victory. One can go many places with these narratives and unpack them in different ways. The story of the churning of the ocean has many classical features of religious stories, including the rivalry between good and evil forces and uneasy partnerships. But what is of concern to us today is that this was, by the story's own reckoning, the first narrative performance with music, dance, and drama. So dance (indeed, all the performing arts) is clearly framed in a religious narrative. The human bodies that dance this and other narratives become the first site of our visit. This is a space where we may raise issues of visual communication and learning and insights relating to feminist and cul- tural theories. The second issue that I will be highlighting is another kind of embodied cosmology-"sacred" architecture, specifically, the temple. We will visit Angkor Wat where the story of the churning of the ocean of milk is depicted in a huge sculptural panel (49 nieters wide) on the southeast corner of the temple. Here, the story is sculpted in all its gran- deur, in three registers. Smaller, more modest depictions of this story abound in temples all over the Siem Reap area in Cambodia. We will also very briefly look at issues of space and time. Spatially, in many cul- tures, the dance stage, temples, and houses were (and still are) positioned according to traditional rules of alignment and in harmony with earth. Temporally, astronomy and astrology figured in the building of these structures and in the lives of the people who built them. Healing and medicine (seen in the guise of the divine physician, Dhanvantari, in our story) are also very significant issues, which, alas, I will not deal with in this address. And then there are concepts of environmental cleanups. Some Hindus have interpreted the story of Shiva drinking the poison as one of environmental degradation and have articulated it through classical music and dance. Our final stop is to come back to the site at the Royal York-the site where scholars of religion, scholars who study many traditions, have come together. What are the paradigms we work with? The issues that are brought out by this narrative performance-dance, architecture, heal- ing, astronomy, ecology-so central to the many traditions we study, have largely been marginal in our textbooks and the western templates of "re- ligious studies." It is only recently that we have started to pay much atten- tion to these topics and move them into our discussions of religion.</page><page sequence="5">Narayanan: Embodied Cosmologies 499 Several caveats, of course, precede the discourse. I argue for epistemic diversity, not just for the diversity related to gender, class, and race- though all that is extremely important-but for complementary sources of knowledge. Ours is a text-dominated academy and society where we privilege the word. While I will be highlighting dance and architecture, I include music and drama, icons, and cities as part of the argument. In this case, I use the word dance in line with the Sanskrit word natya-as refer- ring to dance and music. I do not claim that all traditions value dance and architecture as most significant sources of information or that every place of worship is a Chartres or an Angkor Wat. But if we free ourselves from the perception that dance is something that is just performed on a stage and look instead for its constitutive elements-mime, music, and so forth-we will find them in storytelling, in drama, and in liturgy in many traditions around us. From all of this, it may be clear that I am not using the word piety-seen in the subtitle of this talk-in the frequently under- stood way of inner contemplation but, rather, as referring to public acts and visions of devotion that are inscribed on and which transform the body and the landscape. Thus, in talking of temples and their orientation, I will not be reiterating notions of the axis mundi in the Eliadean sense. Instead, I will speak of piety and power being intertwined in a produc- tion of identity and localities and of how dances and temples help us un- derstand the ways by which immigrants reconceptualize and re-create their many territories. I am also taking for granted that we are in the business of learning about and teaching many cultures. This is no longer an intellectual op- tion; it is a necessity. Our planet is small, and our national boundaries are fluid; other cultures are here amid us, as can be seen by my presence here at this podium. By studying "them," we are now studying ourselves. Eth- nocentrism in any part of the world, especially ours, can be insensitive at best and hazardous to one's health at worst. By other cultures, I am not referring to those that we fondly refer to as the "major" religions of the world; I speak not just about Hinduism or Buddhism but specifically about Native American traditions and indigenous traditions. By learning about them we can learn about our past tragedies; by learning about other reli- gions in the world whose people have been wounded, we may, perhaps, avoid future mistakes. And we should understand these traditions, not just with our categories, not just with our templates, however useful they are, but from their stories, their music, their dances, their sense of heal- ing, and their bodies and minds. Thus, while I focus on dance and sacred buildings in the Hindu tradition-for this is the tradition that I know best-I hope that the implications are wider.</page><page sequence="6">500 Journal of the American Academy of Religion DANCE Deities and devotees dance the cosmos, dance their relationship to each other and to the powers of the universe in many world religions. In the Hindu tradition music and dance are closely allied with temple, and temple walls in India, Cambodia, Bali, and Atlanta portray sculptures of danc- ers. Dances and architectures depict embodied cosmologies; architecture connects the dance and dancer to the cosmos. Krishna danced through many moonlit nights with Radha and the other cowherd girls; he connects the dancers through devotion and through passion in a cosmic mandala. He danced on the serpent Kaliya, subduing its ego. Shiva and Parvati, the archetypal dancers, paradoxically portray cosmic energy as well as tran- quility. Saraswati is the patron goddess of music and many performing arts. The icon of the dancing Shiva-the king of dance or Nataraja-is ar- guably one of the best known pieces of Hindu art. Inscriptions calling him Nrittesvara (Lord of Dance) and Natekesvara (Lord of Drama) are found in Cambodia (Sivaramamurti: 3-4). The drum that is sounded before he dances is like the recitation of Om, the most sacred syllable in the Hindu tradition. The icon of the dancing Shiva is said to embody five functions- creation, preservation, destruction, concealment of the truth, and the grant- ing of salvation (Sivaramamurti: 23-24). The first verse of the Abhinaya Darpanam, a well-known book of dance, says: "His limbs are the worlds, his songs are the languages of universe, his clothes are the moon and the stars" (Nandikesvara: 77). As Nataraja, the lord of the dance, he is depicted with his right hand holding the drum of creation, and his left hand holds the fire of destruc- tion. Shiva has four arms-so the right hand is raised to bless the devo- tee, and the other left hand points to his foot, which is said to be the refuge of human beings. In literature, art, and performing arts, he is lauded and celebrated. The dance itself is compared several times to a sacrifice (Sivarama- murti: 9). The sounds of the flute, the veena, and the drum that removes all poisons, all maladies, are part of the orchestra that plays for Shiva's dance. Shiva is the dancer, the dance, and is adored through dance. Wor- shiping him with dance is like waving a candle in adoration to the light of the sun (Sivaramamurti: 8). There are other dances-in sculpture and dance he dances his omnipotence, his immanence, his omniscience, and time and eternity. Above all, the devotees implore him to dance in their hearts. The dancing icon simultaneously embodies and articulates one dominant Hindu paradigm of the cosmos and, to the attentive devotee, a lesson in theology.</page><page sequence="7">Narayanan: Embodied Cosmologies 501 It is not just gods and goddesses who dance-a well-acclaimed book is called To Dance Is Human (Hanna). Through dance, we plead, suppli- cate, petition, rejoice, and celebrate with our bodies, stretching out, reach- ing out. And this extension apparently extends the word dance back to the Sanskrit root tan (Kraus, Hilsendager, and Dixon: 12). Through dance, human beings have stretched out, reached out through history, across society, and out to their perceptions of the transcendent. All dance, whether it is done in a temple, on a stage, or in a bar, is our expression of space through time. Dance articulates the relationship that human beings within a society have with each other; some think of it as a primary means of social iden- tification. A quotation frequently attributed to Havelock Ellis (whether it is true or not) illustrates this idea. According to Ellis, when a person from one branch of the African Bantu met a Bantu of another branch, he would ask, "What do you dance?" (Kraus, Hilsendager, and Dixon: 19). There were dance societies in Mesoamerica in the great ceremonial centers during the formative period of the empire (1800-200 B.C.E.). Hebrew scriptures speak about people dancing in joy and victory: Miriam took a tambourine in her hand and danced with all the other women; in Psalm 149 we are exhorted to praise the Lord's name in dance.' Court and temple dances flourished in India, Cambodia, Japan, and many other countries. Despite this celebration of dance, we all live in cultures where we articu- late with and through the word to comprehend and explain nonverbal behavior. My dean has yet to accept a paper that I danced, and it must be clear by now that I am not dancing this address. The Hindu tradition has, like many other traditions, been very favor- ably disposed toward visual and performing arts. Gandharva veda, the knowledge related to music and dance, was considered to be an upa or ancillary branch of the Vedas or knowledge. But in nearly all traditions- including Hinduism-there have been streams, times, and institutions where people have been iconoclastic while at the same time they held up the embodied word as an icon. Through the dance, many worldviews and concepts are transmitted synchronically to the viewers and diachronically through the generations. Along with cosmic re-creations of the universe, Indian dances are trans- mitted in the migrations. One of the primary ways in which the transmis- I My colleague Gwynn Kessler also drew my attention to the following verses that speak of dance: Exodus 20:20-21, Judges 11:34, I Samuel 6:14-15, Jeremiah 31:2-3 and 31:12, Psalm 150, and Ecclesiastes 3:4-5, as well as passages in Mishnah Succah 5:4 (ca. third century C.E.), Mishnah Taanit 4:8, and the Babylonian Talmud Taanit 31a (ca. sixth century C.E.). The most obvious place of dance in Judaism today-possibly established sometime in the tenth or eleventh centuries C.E.-is the rejoicing with the Torah at the holiday of Simchat Torah. See also Kraus, Hilsendager, and Dixon: 40-42.</page><page sequence="8">502 Journal of the American Academy of Religion sion of Hindu/Indian culture takes place in temples and in private stu- dios and homes all over the United States is through the performing arts, especially through a classical form known today as Bharata Natyam. The term Bharata Natyam is popularly translated as the "drama according to Bharata" or the "dance of India." The human body carries aspects of Hindu cosmologies and is used as a vehicle for learning about and de- picting the Hindu traditions. To learn classical Indian dances like Bharata Natyam is to learn sto- ries about Hindu gods and goddesses; it is to learn ways of body language seen in the subcontinent; it is to learn the emotions that are intricately tied into the depiction of the human-divine relationships. To know Bharata Natyam is to know the pantheon of gods in the Hindu tradi- tions. It is to know their physical appearances, their insignia, the color of their clothes, and their demeanor. Many of the dances in Bharata Natyam depict the heroic deeds of these deities. To know Bharata Natyam is to know stories of these deities that the parents are familiar with, the Hinduism that they grew up with in India, or Trinidad, or South Africa. Knowledge of Hinduism is not a knowledge of lofty philosophies for the large part; it is largely a knowledge of stories from the epics Ramayana and the Mahabharata (ca. 500 B.C.E.-100 C.E.) and texts called Puranas (ca. first millennium C.E.). Knowledge of these stories, along with local narratives, is known and transmitted in many castes and communities, in most parts of India. While there are hundreds of stories and some are better known in certain areas, there is a certain corpus of tales that almost all Hindus in the diaspora have either heard or seen performed in their childhood. To know Bharata Natyam is to learn the social structures of the Hindu traditions. It is to enter the world of chaste wives, filial sons, committed students, chivalrous warriors, and righteous kings; it is to know the way in which the perfect couple, Rama and Sita, are related to each other; it is to know the filial piety of Ganesha. It is to know the received traditions of power structures; it is to know the relationships between kings and min- isters, teachers and students. To know Bharata Natyam is also to enter into the affective ethos of the Hindu traditions. It is to know the body languages of Hindu heroes and heroines: the beseeching look of the lover, the angry glance of the woman who feels slighted, the haughty king, and the sublime sage. It is to know the different situations that excite emotions. To learn to mime these emotions is to plug into patterns of Indian corporeal knowledge, the ar- ticulation of body knowledge. To know Bharata Natyam is to learn the allegorical structures of Hindu songs. In many songs the love between the deity and the human being is</page><page sequence="9">Narayanan: Embodied Cosmologies 503 portrayed as that between a man and a woman. Many of the devotional songs of Hindu schools and traditions become standard fare to which performers dance. It is not just the classical dances that articulate one's relationship to the cosmos and to other human beings. Popular dance forms like Indian dance garbha (literally, "the womb," a reference to the creative and regenerative powers of the goddess) are extraordinarily popular in Gujarat, India, and in Edison, New Jersey. Tens of thousands of women-and more recently, men-dance through the nights during the Hindu fall festival of "nine nights" or navaratri. Dancing in a circle, their songs celebrate the goddess, poke gentle fun at family members and relationships, and question power and authority. The goddess is ordinarily represented by a flame burning in an earthenware jar in the center of the cosmic circle (Shukla-Bhatt). To know Indian dance forms, therefore, is to have insights into and through several layers of Hindu cultures in time and space. It is also a way of participating in power structures, whether they are perceived as spiri- tual, social, aesthetic, or ethnic. The performing arts, from certain perspectives, provide an alterna- tive avenue to salvation, paralleling the way of knowledge seen in post- Vedic literature. "Pure" or abstract music and dance, that is, music and dance without expressive and devotional content, are themselves said to be of divine origin and are understood to lead one to the divine. A person who chooses this path may use it as his or her worship or to communi- cate his or her relationship with the supreme being. Often, however, sing- ing and dancing are connected with bhakti or devotion. Devotion to the deity is expressed through a number of bhavas or attitudes; these include the attitudes connected with service, maternal love, romantic love, and so forth. The combination of the emotional lyrics sung with devotion is said to be a path through which one can reach the divine goal of one's choice. A performance gives rise to many forms of enjoyment or rasa. This aesthetic experience is sometimes said to lead one to exalted men- tal and spiritual states; others say that it is a space of its own, a state of delight and enjoyment that is neither sacred nor profane. To quote a text, the song is in your throat; the meaning, rendered by the hands; the moods, by your eyes; and the rhythm, by your feet: "Where the hand moves, the glances follow, where the glances go, the mind follows, where the mind goes the mood follows, where the mood goes there is experi- ence of flavor" (Sivaramamurti: 16). But from the fairly large number of Indian girls who are taught classical forms of Indian dance in America, it seems that there is more going on than aesthetics and salvation. Nancy Falk points out that in nineteenth-century Bengal women were seen to be the keepers of culture and religion. The</page><page sequence="10">504 Journal of the American Academy of Religion construct of the ideal woman involved one who had several "markers" of culture-Indian dress, eating habits, and social demeanor-and whose religiosity and spirituality were portable (Falk: 306-308). Similarly, the bodies and minds of these young girls in the United States become the sites for the bearing of stories, the playing out of cultural dramas, the continua- tion of national pride, and the connection between the ancestral culture of a recollected and reconstructed past in India and the hope for the future that will unfold in America. The dance classes "Hinduize" the young im- migrant daughter, making her physically and mentally part of the narrative structures. The body becomes a vehicle to salvation, but it is also a site of transgression, pleasure, pain, and the senses. It is a site of resistance, where agencies of power, prestige, the past, the present, and the demanding cul- tures of the many "others" clash. Classical dances are taught in many Hindu temples in the diaspora, retrieving connections from India's precolonial past. Music and dances were an essential part of temple worship. Inscriptions in the Brihadisvara temple in Thanjavur tell us about the hundreds of dancers and the scores of diverse music instruments and their players. This temple and the Chidambaram temple have sculptures of 108 basic positions of classical Indian dance; the dancers of Belur in Karnataka are justifiably famous. Bronze icons of these sculptures adorn the Hindu temple in Kauai, Hawaii. Every one of the icons shows a special hasta, also known as a mudra. A whole language of communication is available through these gestures in dances and rituals connected with the Hindu and Buddhist traditions. They are also seen in sculptures and have been transmitted from teacher to student or apprentice for millennia all over South and Southeast Asia. Although dance is a splendid form of nonverbal communication, it is still culture specific. Judith Hanna, who has written extensively about dance, speaks of it as being a "paralanguage, a semiotic system, like ar- ticulate speech, made up of signifiers that refer to things other than them- selves" (in Kraus, Hilsendager, and Dixon: 17). We see that language in the hand gestures, the hastas or mudras in the Hindu and Buddhist tradi- tions. While there are similar gestures in both traditions, each has its own unique repertoire as well. A hasta or a mudra communicates not just a concept but a narrative, a ritual, and an ethical and emotional context. Although mudras apparently became standardized in Buddhist art fairly late-possibly around the fifth century C.E.-traditions of dance and the importance of hand gestures existed in India possibly a millennium be- fore that. Dances were an integral part of Vedic sacrifice, with gestures communicating meaning and power; and, of course, the book by Bharata was codified in the first centuries of the Common Era. A story in the Jatakas tells us about Sakyamuni's familiarity with hand gestures. Apparently, in</page><page sequence="11">Narayanan: Embodied Cosmologies 505 an earlier life Sakyamuni met a woman whom he considered taking for a wife. He was not sure if she was married, and he asked her the question by a hand gesture: he raised a closed fist, and the woman, in answer, showed an empty hand (Saunders: 13). In Buddhist and Hindu traditions the mudras are hand gestures used as seals, guaranteeing the power that is communicated through them or through the spoken word. In icons, hand gestures are also used as identity markers (Saunders: 9). In Vajrayana Buddhism, sacred dances were common; through mim- ing the hand gestures and postures of the deities, the dancers connect with the deity. In some Buddhist traditions the performances have the goal of awakening compassion and wisdom (Lobo: 320-321). With the migra- tion of Hindus and Buddhists to East and Southeast Asia, Indian dance forms went with them. Dancing men, women, and celestial beings adorn the walls of the Cambodian temples. The figures of dancing girls were the favorite subjects during the Angkor and the later Bayon period. As we walk through the temples in this area we see the ubiquitous presence of danc- ing apsaras-the same beings who emerged from the ocean of milk. These celestial dancers give the temples the atmosphere of an Indraloka-one of the celestial paradises. So deep is the word apsara in the Cambodian consciousness that even modern dancers are called "apsaras." Modern Cambodians now use apsara, an easily recognizable word that ties in with their heritage, as a name for the organization that watches over their monuments and temples. One can also experience the centrality of dance in the Sufi traditions. The sema is said to be "a ceremony of worship, a meditation in move- ment, in which the human being becomes pure axis, integrating all levels of being within himself, including the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual levels. To perform the sema is to be centered on the timeless and spaceless."2 A wonderful story exemplifies this centrality of the sema. It is from the Maqalat of Shams of Tabriz, Rumi's spiritual mentor: A certain shaikh said, "The Caliph has forbidden the Sema." This prohi- bition turned into a knot within a certain dervish. He fell ill, and they took him to a specialist. He examined his pulse and looked for the cause of illness. It was like nothing he had ever learned about. He couldn't find anything wrong with him, but the dervish died. Afterwards, the doctor performed an autopsy and found the knot within his chest. It had be- come a carnelian. The doctor kept this gem until a time when he needed some extra cash. The gem passed from hand to hand until it reached the caliph, who had the gem set into a ring. One day, that same caliph was attending a Sema, watching from above, when he discovered that his 2 See "Shams-i Tabriz on Sema," available at http://www.sufism.org/society/sema2.html.</page><page sequence="12">506 Journal of the American Academy of Religion clothes were covered with blood. He examined himself but could find no wound anywhere. He felt for his ring and the stone was gone. Later they traced that gem back to its original owner and the doctor told them the whole story mentioned above.3 The individual dervish has to do several tasks: simultaneously keep beat, move to a tight choreography, meditate on God's name, connect with the sheikh and the lineage of teachers, and so on. In the Ismaili Muslim tradition in India, there are beautiful songs connected to a circular dance. In the translation of Tazim Kassam: On the ninth day the Guru himself came, and everyone danced with joy. He danced with a purpose and imparted many teachings.... ... The Guru danced in the garbi and he recited the Qu'ran. (1995: 338, 357) We know that many traditions are connected with dance, but one may also raise the question: Is all dance inherently religious, or do we look for cosmologies in, say, places where the running neon lights proclaim: "We bare all"? The meanings and function depend on the time, society, class, age, gender, religious structure, and cosmologies. Dancing in bars, after all, has been a hallowed exercise for a few millennia. Questions like this, of course, involve a rethrashing and rehashing of cherished categories- or, as some would have it, the dearly departed categories-of the sacred and the secular. Hindu communities have ordinarily considered dance to be a signifi- cant part of everyday life (Sivaramamurti: 12). One Hindu text says that dance invites the blessings to be righteous, counsels the fool, cheers the depressed, enhances happiness for women, and gives prosperity in this world and in the next-above all it is said to please Vishnu (Sivarama- murti: 12). Most historians of dance, of course, count the religious form as only one of many "types" that are possible-the communal, educa- tional, recreational, social, theatrical, and therapeutic (Adshead-Landsdale and Layson: 10). Yet in some cultures we see a deeply engrained belief in perceiving the status and nature of the performing arts as an articulation of the deeper nature of things and as connected with the other streams of life. In China the Book of Rites says, "The music of a well-governed world is peaceful and happy, its government being harmonious; that of a disor- 3See "Shams-i Tabriz on Sema," available at http://www.sufism.org/society/sema2.html.

This is the earliest elaboration of the deterministic theory-dating from the first century B.C.E.-that the character of any given age will inevitably be expressed in the people's songs. The same state- ment was incorporated, more famously, into the "major preface" to the Book of Songs, which was written no later than the first century C.E.4 In ancient China poems were set to music and often performed as dance. The alliance of music, dance, and verse in some forms of popular entertainment continued through court performances, and a popular proverb that fits the mood of these times goes as follows: One may judge a ruler by the state of dancing during his reign. The connections between dance and other sec- tors of life straddles this liminal area between the academic categories of the "sacred" and the "secular" and pushes us to look at these fuzzy bound- aries and European constructions of academic fields and disciplines. We have noted the deep and pervasive connections between the Hindu traditions and dance. Balasaraswati, an artist who hailed from a family of temple and court dancers and who was one of the greatest exponents of the Bharata Natyam style of dance in India, once compared her dance to the structure of a great temple. She compared the alarippu, the first item in the repertoire, with the grand entranceway, the majestic tower (gopuram). The traditional items that follow-the jatisvaram and sabdam-are, she said, like the vestibule, the corridor that leads one to the grand hall. The varnam, which is the central piece of the recital (it is here that the artist depicts the soul's passion for the supreme being), is the piece that gets one close to the inner shrine. "This is the space," she has said, "which gives the dancer expansive scope to revel in the music, rhythm and moods of the dance. The varnam is the continuum which gives ever expanding room to the dancer to delight in her self-fulfillment, by providing the fullest scope to her own creativity as well as to the tradition of the art" (Pattabhiraman). When one dances the padam (the next item in a traditional performance), one experiences the containment, cool and quiet of entering the sanc- tum from the external precincts. The expanse and brilliance of the outer corridors disappear in the dark inner sanctum; and the rhythmic virtu- osities of the varnam yield to the soul-stirring music and abhinaya [ex- pression] of the padam. Dancing to the padam is akin to the juncture when the cascading lights of worship are withdrawn and the drum beats die down to the simple and solemn chanting of sacred verses in the closeness of god. Then, the tillana [this is the pure abstract dance where the spar- 4 I am indebted to Professor Cynthia Chennault (University of Florida) for some of these refer- ences. For the importance of early poetry, dance, and music, see Chen.</page><page sequence="14">508 Journal of the American Academy of Religion kling footwork dominates] breaks into movement like the final burning of camphor accompanied by a measure of din and bustle. (Pattabhiraman) By now, she says, the devotee internalizes the deity she has worshiped outside and completes the traditional order by dancing to a simple devo- tional verse. The dancer dances her worship in the temple, creates the temple within her body, and dances the temple in her performance. Let us walk for a few minutes inside the temple, a structure of corporal piety and corporal power. CORPORAL PIETY, CORPORATE POWER In the eastern corridor of Angkor Wat we find what is claimed to be the largest relief in the world-an enormous depiction of the story of the churning of the ocean of milk. Divine beings and demons tug the serpent rope, while Vishnu is seen as a tortoise, in his anthropomorphic form, and as infusing strength to both sides. Every person, every piece of this carving, has been put together with considerable thought, at the spatially right position, in alignment with the sun's position on astronomically significant days. It is part of an overall cosmological orientation of the whole temple-a matrix that has only recently been understood by a com- bination of three scholars: an art historian, a historian of science, and an astronomer from the University of Michigan. Their results, published in Science in 1976, are fascinating: when they studied the metrical measure- ments ofAngkor Wat, calculated the basic unit of measurement that would have been used in the building of the temple, and then converted the metrical measurements into this unit, the numbers were astonishing. None of them was familiar with it or expected it, but further explorations into the Hindu traditions revealed that almost every number corresponded to a number significant in the Hindu measurement of time-the golden age, the silver age, and so on. The temple itself was set in alignment with oth- ers at considerable distances, attentive to the rising of the sun at the sum- mer and winter solstices. The rising of the sun over the temple towers had been timed precisely for specific days of the calendar such as the spring equinox (Stencel, Gifford, and Moron). Many of us already study and teach about what goes on inside places of worship, both public and domestic. More recently, John Cort, Colleen McDannell, Margaret Miles, and many others have drawn our attention to the importance of icons, images, and what we have somewhat egre- giously called "material culture" as objects of veneration and objects for our study. Diane Apostolos-Cappadona, Tazim Kassam, Guy Beck, and others have written extensively about the performing arts. Let us take a</page><page sequence="15">Narayanan: Embodied Cosmologies 509 few more steps and walk through and around the buildings, to see and experience them as they could have been when constructed. While I focus on Hindu temples, notions of positioning buildings in the right way go far beyond temples and the Hindu culture. These ideas come up in the ways in which we align our homes and our dwellings, and knowledge of geomancy is popular in many cultures around the world. Incorporated into these buildings are many ideas, many concepts, orient- ing and locating human beings in precise directions on this earth. Of the many ideas that come into play here, let us briefly look at just a few this evening: the corporal nature of the temple-that is, the perception of the temple as a "body," the orientation and shape of these buildings. The orientation of these buildings and the shape of the structures have his- torically been connected, in many cultures, to notions of space and time, and they have sometimes served as giant calendars and astronomi- cal calculators. Hindu temples were considered to be bodies. The temple could be the body of God; Bruno Dagens, translating several manuals of religious ar- chitecture, has shown the specific correlation of the anatomy of the di- vine and the architecture of the temple. Others, quoting agamic texts, say that temples are built in the model of a human being (Venkatachari). Archaeologists, art historians, and theologians have all weighed in on this topic. But the concept most pervasive in Hindu popular cultures is that of the vastu mandala, a specific geometric grid of sixty-four or eighty-one squares. The word vastu has come to refer to the knowledge of position- ing a building in the right way. Within the square we find the body of a person of somewhat ambivalent disposition, neither human nor divine. This is the Vastu-Man, the Vastu Purusha, who lies on the ground on which we build our homes, businesses, and temples. The legends are not very clear about whether he is a good person or an asura, a demon. The stories say that this being fell to earth and that the many celestial beings- devas-jumped on him and pinned him to the ground. His body is de- picted with various deities sitting on it. The head of this giant is to the northeast; this is the most auspicious direction, and the figure of this per- son is fitted into the square of the extended universe. The mandala and the form of this Vastu become "a diagrammatic field of co-ordinates, in- tersections and diagonals . .. sensitive to any interference with its order and in this respect it functions like the subtle body of the human being" (Kramrisch: 71). Kramrisch notes that "such constructions have wide currency in Indian thought where they signify the universal law as a work- ing entity" (71). The body is said to be a place of coordinated activity, each part being the seat of a special function. Such coordinated function is made</page><page sequence="16">510 Journal of the American Academy of Religion factually and repeatedly in Brahmanical cultures and Buddhism, in sa- cred texts, rituals, and works of art. The presence of the Buddha is spo- ken of in reliefs in Sanchi and Amaravati by having his footprints in the place of the feet, a tree or pillar as the trunk and axis of the body, and the wheel as head and the sunshade above it. Notions of mandala are central to Indian dance as well as architecture. A dancer's position in classical Bharata Natyam is called "half mandala" (ardha mandali) or full-an interesting feature that we cannot pursue now. Many of us are more familiar with notions of mandala governing city for- mations. The city of Madurai was supposed to be shaped like a lotus mandala (Eck). The Bayon, in Angkor Thom, a Buddhist city near Angkor Wat, is said to be like Mt. Mandara in the churning of the ocean of milk, and the churning ropes are still seen in the entrance. Paul Mus, explaining this as the rationale for the pattern of the city, shows how the treasures that came out of the ocean became the leitmotif for the city; Angkor Thom was said to be the fount of treasures (Zephir and Jessup: 89). The many principles of vastu and geomancy govern the positioning of a house, a bed, a desk, or even one's computer. Architecture, like dance, extends through space and time. The orientations of these buildings to specific directions, whether east to the rising sun or west, inform us about the notions of the people's spatial relationship to the cosmos. They were aligned according to astronomical configurations and functioned as as- tronomical centers, observing planetary and stellar movements; these activities inform us of their precise calculations of time. Sacred cities and towns were built like mandalas, powerful diagrams of the universe, but who got to be in the center and who was in the periphery were as much a matter of political and social hierarchies of power as they were theologi- cal enterprises. Learning about them is to know how human beings have experienced embodiment, conceptualized the divine, constructed social hierarchies, and aligned themselves with the natural forces of the earth, the stars, and the planets-exciting areas that we can surely incorporate into our curriculum. By taking them together, we not only understand their experience of space and time but how these fields of knowledge- architecture, astronomy, and astrology-were integrated with their the- ologies and worldviews that today we label as "religion." But having labeled a structure like Angkor Wat as a temple-a religious structure-we then look for and study those features of it that we consider to be religion or theology. We pay selective attention to ritual-frequently ignoring per- formances such as dance-and have tended, alas, to ignore everything else that does not fit into the post-Enlightenment template of"religion." This is the corporate power of the academy that cuts and edits religion into x</page><page sequence="17">Narayanan: Embodied Cosmologies 511 number of sound or word bites. Cities and stupas, temples, and towns fly outside our protective compartments as our academic train speeds by them; we pay no attention to them because we are content reading our books inside the train. Temples and stupas in South and Southeast Asia and public ceremo- nial buildings in the Oaxaca region in Mesoamerica have all been built with certain astronomical orientations, that is, aligned toward the hori- zons where planets and stars appear or in very specific directions. Some of these ceremonial centers are hundreds of miles away from each other; David Carrasco says that this "indicates a shared cosmovision that influ- enced ceremonial architecture and ritual very early in Mesoamerican his- tory" (29-30). This was probably between 1200 B.C.E. and 600 B.C.E. The pyramids, too, were aligned very, very precisely on directions; the cur- rent positions of other buildings nearby reflect the globalization of eco- nomic, if not cosmic, orientations. Mayan and Aztec temples were giant calendars and were built with astronomical precision: the Kukulcain Pyra- mid at Chichen Itza was built such that during the spring equinox the setting sun casts a shadow of a serpent writhing down the steps of the pyramid. As Carrasco says, the "Mayas elaborated the cosmological con- viction that the human life would be most favorable if it mirrored the mathematically expressible cycles of the heavens" (38). Observation, along with traditions-both oral and textual-tells us about the complex patterns that underlie the visual phenomena and the houses of worship in Asia. The Hindu temples continue the symbolism of the Vedic altar and Agni, the god of fire. In building the Vedic altar, the sacrificial body, the sacrificer is said to become the altar itself; he builds for himselfa sacrificial body, moving beyond time and death. The altar is built in the likeness of the universe and in accordance with his own bodily mea- surements. Through this, it becomes his transformed, sacrificial body. The unit of time is brought into play too-there are as many layers in the altar as there are seasons in the year, and the total number of bricks to be used is the number of days in the year-360. Thus, through numerical count, the notion of time is built into the space of the altar (Kramrisch: 69-70). Later, in the temple, the body was drawn on the ground and not piled up. The inner shrines of Hindu temples, known as the "womb house" or garbha griha, are the caves that served as houses of worship; and the tow- ers of the temples are frequently compared with mountains. But more importantly, it is not just any mountains-many Hindu and Buddhist temples are modeled after Mt. Meru, which is believed to be at the center of the universe. The largest and most famous example of this correlation is the Angkor Wat in Cambodia.</page><page sequence="18">512 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Angkor Wat is considered to be the highest achievement of Khmer temple architecture and is today the "flagship" of the temples at Angkor. Angkor Wat covers an area of 1,500 by 1,300 meters (4,920 by 4,265 feet) and is surrounded by a vast moat 180 meters (590 feet) wide. Balustrades in the shape of giant serpents line the causeway leading to the temple. The Angkor Wat temple has five main towers, representing the five peaks of Mt. Meru, the center of the Hindu and Buddhist visions of the universe, and is built in three levels. There are, of course, extensive sculptures all over the temples. I have shown elsewhere that in style, structure, and theo- logical orientation they resemble several temples in India (Narayanan). The towers are said to emulate lotus buds and are similar in some ways to the towers of temples built a century earlier in Orissa. The whole structure, or at least the central part, according to some texts should be a square-or at least the innermost shrine had to be a square. The Bakheng temple, built in the late ninth century, shows this pattern. The Bakheng has five stories, corresponding to the five syllables in the most famous of mantras that revere the deity Shiva: "Om nama shivaya." The temple also has 108 towers, but from any side one can only see thirty-three towers. In Hindu thought there are supposed to be thirty-three divine beings in one count and 330 million divine ones ac- cording to another.5 Angkor is far grander than any three-level temple in South India. In re-creating the "original," the Hindus from India and the kings of Kam- buja also added features that reflected the times and conditions in which they lived. Angkor Wat also serves as an observatory. The measurements of Angkor also give the number of years in the Yuga system (Mannikka). The large temples have been constructed with astronomical details in mind; that is, at the simplest possible level, the sun will shine through a skylight on the deity or a particular icon on the annual feast days of the temple. Hindus have re-created their cosmologies in migrations. Some of this has been through temple building, and some has been through a re-creation of the sacred territories in new lands. Thus, in Cambodia, the Kbal Spean became associated with the river Ganga, which is said to flow from Vishnu's toe, and 1,000 lingas were carved into the riverbed. Kasi, the Indian name for Benares, is found in Flint, Michigan, and in Sebastian, Florida. Temple towers and tanks replicate the Hindu landscape from sea to shining sea in America. Sthapathis, or traditional architects and sculp- 5 The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (3.9.1-2) lists various categories of divine beings. The list in- cludes the eight vasus, eleven rudras, and twelve adityas plus Indra and Prajapati as the thirty-three devas or divine beings.</page><page sequence="19">Narayanan: Embodied Cosmologies 513 tors, design and work on the temples; these temples now tangibly con- nect the Hindu with the cosmos, with India, and with the host country. The connections between temple and state, of course, are quite traditional in India and Southeast Asia; kings and queens, after all, were important patrons of the temples. The Angkor Wat is found on the Cambodian flag; and in America, national flags now drape the walls of Hindu temples. All this is in addition to the traditional dvaja sthamba or flagpole, which in Hindu thought shows the connection of the deity's dominion over the universe. Earthly power and perceptions of divine power have been in- tertwined in the temple. In migrations, this translates to a holding onto the past while settling in the new homeland and selectively adapting part of the new worldview. FROM ANGKOR TO ATLANTA: EPISTEMIC PLURALISM When Hindus migrated to Cambodia or to America, they carried a sense of their place in the universe. When we look at the lives of Hindus in vari- ous places in the world, what we find is a persistence and re-creation of certain cosmologies--a ritualized cosmology and embodied cosmology. The cosmology of the temple architecture and ritual is the task of trained priests; the cosmology of ritualized dances and role-playing is the property of all. In the United States these cosmologies transmit various forms of a generic "Hinduization" of the next generation. It is not caste and sectarian com- munity that are transmitted; rather, it is a form of "Hinduization" that depends on archetypal and transformed rituals for the temple functions, involves the internalization of epics narratives, and articulates them through music and dances by new, freshly minted diasporic Hindus. It involves a commitment to build and maintain temples and to endow money every year to them before the tax year ends; it involves adapting some Hindu archi- tectural texts to the county's building codes and negotiating constantly with traditional architects from India and with immigration officers. And then the Ganga flows and the Yamuna flows, along with the Mississippi and the Suwannee in the re-created Hindu landscape. We can travel through many cultures, many millennia, and see many versions of embodied cosmologies. We can show and tell about cultures in which human bodies were thought to personify, center, and dance the universe. We can look with awe at human beings and societies that built Stonehenge, the pyramids, the great cities and temples across Meso- america, and Angkor Wat-all venerable structures that so intricately reflect notions of space and time. And then, after saying "gee whiz," we may pause and ask what we may do with all our information on dancing</page><page sequence="20">514 Journal of the American Academy of Religion and temples. I would like to spend the few minutes remaining today by meditating on this question. Epistemic pluralism is, of course, a central part of what my talk today is about. It is not just limited to gender, class, and race; it also includes different ways of apprehension, different ways of knowing. Performing arts, icons, art, and temples are all very important and underutilized re- sources in our academy. One area where one can take these discussions is that of "knowing," the philosophy of the mind and some areas of cognitive psychology. It raises questions about visual perception and the processing of knowledge. The classical works of Gombrich, Suzanne Langer, and others, who wrote about how we picture and know the world, are still relevant to our discus- sions. Indian philosophy has posited perception, inference, and thought process as well as "the word" as ways of knowing among others. Expres- sionists such as Langer and others raise the question of how pictorial apprehension precedes language thinking. Such works, seen in tandem with traditional epistemologies, raise several issues to be debated with stu- dents. Is intuition, as Langer says, the fundamental intellectual activity that produces logical or semantical understanding? Her work suggests that semantical understanding is a second-order activity that is built on the first-order foundation of immediate perception. She argues that ar- tistic perception is intuitive, a matter of direct insight and not a product of discursive thinking-but neither is it a "mystical unnegotiated contact with reality" (in Gilmour: 54, see also 29-71). Are there imaginative ways in which we can introduce our students to play off such concepts along- side the indigenous epistemologies and concepts of ineffability that many traditions have produced? Dance is also an area where we can incorporate the insights of cultural and feminist theories. Were temple courtesans free agents or manipulated by power structures over which they had no control? Are the dancers in various cultures autonomous artists, or are they dependent on male man- agers, dancing puppets held by patriarchal strings? We can critique and analyze the specific dances in terms of the choreography, arrangements, clothing, codes, contexts, rhetoric, means of production and dissemination, reception, and, of course, gender of the practitioners. All these are embed- ded in social and cultural discourses and are connected to social relations, economies, cultural knowledge, and media systems (Bose; Brown: 211). Textual, performative, and institutional analysis "within feminist history is of particular value to dance which has often, in the past, been marginalized owing to its self enclosure within the celebratory rhetorics of the 'gentle- man scholar"' (Brown: 211).</page><page sequence="21">Narayanan: Embodied Cosmologies 515 Discussions on performance, temples, and architecture that speak about the cosmos lead us into areas of ecology that may be framed differ- ently. Cultures come to us color coded (in case you did not notice it, I am wearing Florida Gator colors today). In India some dancers have trans- formed traditional narratives to raise consciousness about environmen- tal pollution and express it in color-coded words and through dances. In a beautiful verse sung in Carnatic music the singer speaks about the prob- lem of environmental degradation by referring to the story of the churn- ing of the ocean of milk. You may recall that the poison that rose from the churning was consumed by Shiva to protect the earth. The poison remained in his throat, and he came to be called Nilakantha or "the blue- throated one." The dancer teases Shiva, asking him why he is not clean- ing up the poisons of the earth-we certainly have enough to go around. Is it because he does not want to become all blue like the lord Vishnu, who has the color of a stormy cloud?6 Notions of the earth as an embodi- ment of the deity can be a useful resource as we rethink ecology and our relationship to this planet. Another direction in which the discussion of these materials can be moved is into the understanding of the discipline of religious studies. One of the best known ways in which this knowledge has been interpreted is by Mircea Eliade. A discussion of such cities, temples, and dances may be-and has been-taken as directly referring to issues of ontology; we may see Angkor Wat or Teochitlan as the axis mundi, the sacred as ulti- mately irreducible, religion as sui generis, and human beings as Homo religiosis. Some of us in the academy, on the other hand, may choose to critique these notions of the irreducible nature of religion. Many have argued that religion is a field that we have created. All these structures point not to the axis mundi; rather, they encompass and portray the boast of her- aldry and the pomp of power. Bodies, whether human or made of brick, are contested areas of power struggles where human beings erect and dismantle various kinds of strengths, pressures, and force; these are the realms of social and political ambitions. Like the physical surroundings of Angkor, the academic landscape of these discussions is strewn with potential hazards and land mines of power. 6 The verse is in "Nilakanthare, vaarum aiya" in Begada raga, composed by Mrs. Sujatha Vijayarag- havan of Madras and danced by her daughters Sunanda Narayanan (Cambridge, Mass.) and Sumithra Nitin (Bangalore, India). The author is playing on two different associations one may have with the color blue: the poison swallowed by Shiva is blue in color; the dark blue color of Vishnu's body, on the other hand, reminds a devotee of a rain-filled cloud that can shower grace.</page><page sequence="22">516 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Temples and stupas, however, form fascinating ways of introducing religion to students. One may conceptualize these structures as mandalas, cosmic diagrams that are nerve centers of balanced energies and exu- berant power, with the presiding deity or Buddha as the still, ineffable point in the center. Alternatively, one may think of the central deity and the subsidiary celestial beings as paralleling the structure of political power. But one does not have to weigh in either with Eliade or with those who understand religion as yet another field of power politics. We can move our discussion in another direction; we can look at dances, temples, cit- ies, alternative medical therapies, and so on and appreciate the embod- ied ways in which knowledge was transmitted in precolonial cultures and still continues to be transmitted in many diasporic realms. It is in and through these embodied narratives that identities are formed and home- lands are imagined, re-created, and made secure, in nostalgia and in the present. The privileging of the written text and beliefs by dominant, he- gemonic cultures has led to the marginalization of other ways of knowing, other sources of knowledge. By decolonizing methodologies, by disman- tling the authority paradigms based on texts alone, and by understand- ing indigenous knowledge systems that may overlap like the fields of a Venn diagram in some cultures, we begin to explore the intersection of "globalization past" with "globalization present." The lived experience, the experiences of space and time-through per- forming arts, art, and architecture-and food are all significant and not just topics for the department of anthropology or the school of fine arts. I am arguing for valorizing what we call interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary methods and to look beyond traditional Eurocentric constructions of fields and disciplines. We must endeavor to decolonize our methods, make that paradigm shift, and reach across traditional department and disciplinary lines. Many art historians and archaeologists are contextualizing their sub- jects, observing rituals, hearing music, seeing dance performances, and un- derstanding archaeoastronomy in the context of religion; but we have not yet made that move as an academy. For understanding some traditions- and these traditions are here now, in North America and in Europe-the list has to be longer. To understand some traditions we may have to be- come familiar with their astrological and astronomical concepts, their cal- endars, their forms of healing, and the history of science, for starters. Some of these fields-healing, the arts, and landscapes, for instance--are now rep- resented in the program units of the American Academy of Religion; some of us are already taking these issues to our students and reflecting about their importance in teaching religion (for instance, see Gottschall; Kassam 2001).</page><page sequence="23">Narayanan: Embodied Cosmologies 517 In one Hindu text, the Vishnudharmottara Purana, there is a conver- sation between King Vajra and the sage Markandeya on the art of reli- gious sculpture-the kind one uses for worship. Vajra wants to know how he can make forms of the gods so that the icons manifest the deity. Markandeya says that he cannot carve images unless he knows the art of painting. Vajra then asks him about the art of painting, and the sage says that he cannot learn that unless he knows the canon of dance because in both arts the world has to be represented. And how does one learn about dance? Markandeya says that you cannot learn dance unless you are knowl- edgeable about instrumental music; and taking this further, he says that you cannot learn instrumental music unless you know vocal music. Vo- cal music is the classical, the popular, and the vernacular. There are infi- nite vernaculars in the world-and infinite kinds of prose recitation. And so it goes on (Rabe). The pedagogical potential of other ways of knowing has been central to my talk this evening. Cultures, I said earlier, come color coded; we need to study the patterns, the spaces, the motion, the colors, and the timing of ideas and concepts to understand them. But the research potential, while important, is not enough. An inscription in a South Indian temple says that a king may compose poems, defeat enemies, and give away fortunes, but unless the poets record them on inscriptions, it will be like dancing in the dark (Sivaramamurti: 1). And so, unless we discuss, interpret, and translate our understanding of cities, temples, icons, and dance into peda- gogical life, we too will be dancing in the dark. It is traditional to compose a poem or a verse to commemorate an aus- picious occasion. My friend, Dr. Sethuraman, a professor at Florida State University, composed a Sanskrit verse, modeled after a famous one in the text on dance called Abhinaya Darpanam (Nandikesvara: 79, chap. 1, v. 19). I changed this verse slightly to fit my talk today. Dr. Barboza will dance out the meaning as I recite it this evening: Sabhaa iyam dyu-druma-aabhaasaa veda-shaakha-vilaasinii shaastra-suuna-sugandha-aadhyaa naatya-piiyuusha-lolupaa. This assembly (the audience) shines like the wish-fulfilling (kalpa) tree. Its branches are like the Vedas; it has the fragrance of the flower of the scriptures and has people eager for the ambrosia of dance.</page><page sequence="24">518 Journal of the American Academy of Religion REFERENCES Adshead-Landsdale, J., Dance History: An Introduction.
