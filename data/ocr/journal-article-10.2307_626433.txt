<plain_text><page sequence="1">A GROUP OF PLASTIC VASES1 [PLATE V.] P1. V, I and 2 shows a plastic vase in the British Museum, in the form of an antelope's head, cut off flat at the base of the neck and with the orifice in the right ear. The clay is light reddish-brown with a very smooth surface, the glaze brownish-black. The horns, ears, eyelids, pupils, muzzle and outlines of jaws are black, the face is covered with fine black dots, the neck and throat and the burr of the horns with short black strokes; there are white dots on the muzzle, red in the interior of ears and nostrils, and an incised line round the pupils. Under the base is a black rosette with a white dot on each petal (P1. V, 2). Horns and ears are broken off, but are preserved complete on a replica in Berlin 2 (Fig. I, a and P1. V, 3). Mlle. Maximova pointed out the connexion of the two vases, though she wrongly stated that the London vase had no orifice.3 She mentioned two others with the orifice in the ear-a bull's head in Berlin 4 and a ram's head in Florence,5 both also cut off flat at the neck. The bull's head has no other resemblance to the antelopes', but the ram's appears from the description to be of similar style. The main peculiarity of the painting of the antelopes' heads-the covering of some areas with fine dots and others with short dashes-recurs on a number of other vases. I list the examples known to me: A. Heads cut offlat at the neck with the orifice in the ear. i. London, 47. 11-27. Io (old no. A 1151). Antelope's head; described above. H. 8 cm.

The peculiar convention of the joined horns, making a loop to hang the vase up by, is evidently a rendering of a lyrate form in the original; cf. the bronze horns, Olympia IV, pl. LVII, 977. This and the long boot face are typical of certain gazelles and antelopes found in Arabia and Africa; cf. the 6pos mentioned by Herodotus, IV, 192, as inhabiting Eastern Libya, whose horns were used to make frames for lyres. The 6pvu, also apparently an antelope, was believed by Aristotle (H.A. 499 b 2o, PA 663 a 23) to have only one horn in the centre of its forehead. Perhaps our creatures also have a place in the ancestry of the unicorn. 3 Op. cit. p. 125, n. I. 4 1302, op. cit. pl. XXIII, no. 93, and pp. 123, 175. 5 Op. cit. p.

The same is true of the splendid fragment 14, of which the fore-part is missing. 15-16 are known to me only from Maximova's 6 mention and Payne's,7 but they probably belong to the same group. 15.

The example in Berlin,9 from Vulci, is of a different type, but it has some resemblance to the boar and most probably belongs to our series. In form these vases make a further link between group A and the rest of the series. Albizzati pointed out that the form and decoration of the vase- mouths of 7, II, 17, and 18 were similar; we can add those of 5, 10 and 12. The rim-pattern of 5, 7, 17 and 18 is repeated on the neck-ring of the last, along the boar's crest in 4 (Fig. 3) and on the edge of the pubes in io (Fig. 2), and elaborated on the neck-ring of I7; that of i i is repeated in reversed colours on the intermediate circle of the rosette on 4 (P1. V, 5). The central member of this rosette is repeated with slight elaborations on I, 9 and 18. That these vases form a coherent series, produced in one workshop if not by one hand, seems to me certain. Where and when they were produced it is much more difficult to say. I is from Italy, 'probably the Northern part,' 3 from Chiusi, 6 from S. Maria di Capua, i i from Cervetri, 13 from Vulci, 14 from the Agro Falisco, 15 from Italy, I7 and 18 from Etruria, 19 from Italy; 7 is probably from Etruria, 12 bought in Rome, and 2, 4 and 5 are from collections largely formed in Italy. Most of them have hitherto been classed as Ionian: 1-3, 6a, 7, II and 13--19 by Maximova,10 4, 5 and 7 by Langlotz,11 and I, 2, 11 and 13-18 by Payne.12 Maximova 13 regarded 5 6 Op. cit., p. II o, n.

True, Albizzati,14 who recognised the connexion of 7, I I, 17 and 18, assigned them to Corinth, but with them all his plastic vases, including certainly Ionian and Italian pieces; 15 Fair- banks 16 likewise listed his whole stock under ' Orientalising Vases of the Greek Mainland,' while Walters 17 finds room for the London duck under the heading 'Athenian Vases with Designs on a White Ground,' but all serious efforts to place them have called them Ionian or Italian imitations of Ionian. The fabric proves that they were not made at Corinth, probably not in Attica, but little else.s18 The proveniences suggest though they do not prove an Italian origin. There are a great number of Italian plastic vases, consistently shabby in fabric and poor in style; if our admirable series was made in Italy, it must have been by Greeks, and it should be possible to determine more closely the Greek connexions of the style. As we have seen, these are generally sought in Ionia, but in many points the style of our vases differs from that of demonstrably Ionian types, and associates them with the other main tradition of plastic vases, the Creto- Corinthian. Payne 19 pointed out that the practice of covering large areas of plastic vases with dots is found in Crete from an early period and borrowed by Protocorinthian, which transmitted it to Corinthian, whence it was imitated in Italy. He added that it was virtually unknown in Ionia, and of the exceptions he cited all but two 20 belong to our group. It is true that a simple technical practise like this could be imitated anywhere at any moment, but it is, I think, only the most obvious sign of a deeper difference. Perhaps the most typical Ionian plastic vases with varnish paint decoration are those in the form of female heads, and these always have the same scheme of colour: hair and dress painted, face reserved with eyes, eyebrows, etc., picked out in paint. This ' naturalistic ' system the Ionians extended to animals-lions', horses' and rams' heads all tend to have reserved faces and dark manes. Human heads are rare in the Creto-Corinthian tradition, and this anthropomorphism is totally absent from their animal representations. The painted decoration of the latter seems to be planned to produce a pleasantly varied surface, while giving a general effect of a feathery or furry, a hairy or bristly creature. The artist will even introduce purely decorative motives like rosettes or 14 Op. cit. p. 96, n.

The Cycladic griffon-oenochae has dots on the face, as have a bull's head and horse's head from Gela, of peculiar style-probably local pastiches (MA xvii, pp. 717-18, figs. 548-9). I know only three other plastic vases which shew the areas of short dashes typical of our series: (I) a fragmentary vase from Ialysos (Clara Rhodos, III, p. 35, fig. I9) in the form of a boar, with the orifice in its forehead; from the publication it appears to be covered with dashes, but the drawing is so grotesque that one can tell nothing-it might, I suppose, belong to our series; (2) the beautiful Etruscan lion in the British Museum, E 803, early fourth-century B.C.?-very close in style to the Arezzo chimaera; (3) a fine stag of the same fabric in the Louvre, 176.</page><page sequence="6">46 C. M. ROBERTSON palmettes 21-motives which an Ionian confines strictly to helmets or dresses where they make no offence against nature. The majority of our vases go obviously with the Creto-Corinthian tradition in this point; exceptions are the eagles' heads, but even here we find on the top of the heads rosettes and linear ornaments. A point on which our vases show divided allegiance is the orifice. Ionian plastic vases almost invariably have an aryballos-mouth; 22 Cretan and Protocorinthian invariably conceal it about the person of the vase, while Corinthian for the most part follows this tradition, but shows a good many examples with a vase-mouth, probably imitating Ionian. Our full-figure vases carry a vase-mouth and so do the monkey 'protome' and the eagles' heads; the other four heads conceal the orifice in the ear. This particular ingenuity does not occur in Protocorinthian or Corin- thian; 23 I know of seven vases outside our series which have it: three bulls' heads, one Boeotian24 the others probably of Italian provenience,25 and four Cretan owls, two of one type from Afrati,26 one of another from the same site,2' and the double vase from Knossos in Oxford.28 Vases in the form of owls are regular only in Cretan and Proto- corinthian, and the latter differ in species and pose from the former.29 Our Boston owl (Fig. I c) is of the earless Protocorinthian species, though the great painted volutes in which the eyebrows end could perhaps best be explained as relics of ears,30 but the position is that of the first two Afrati examples mentioned above, and of a third from the same site;a31 I know no others. The aidoion vase occurs in Ionia, but is much more typical of Corinth.32 Our example (Io, Figs. 2 and 3) is similar in form to the simpler piece from Vetulonia (NdS. 1894, 347, Fig. 16, CVA Firenze, Fasc. I, III C e, P1. 3, 7), cited by Maximova and Payne as Corinthian, and another better preserved in the Castellani collection (Mingazzini, 385, P1. XXX, 6, 7); see further below. The practice of decorating the cut-off surface of head vases recalls the 21 Palmette, Protocorinthian duck in Berlin, 3676, Neugebauer, Fiihrer, pl. II; Maximova, pl. XLIV, I6; 'Johansen, pl.

XIX, 75, among Ionian vases, with the Vatican and London ducks in our series, shew the two styles at their nearest approach, but they are very different; the featherless back of the swallow would be unthinkable in our group. 23 Cf., however, the Corinthian Acheloos heads, which have it in or under the horn. 24 From Orchomenos, BCH xix, 171, fig. 5. 25 Berlin, I340, Gerhard Collection (see above); Louvre from the Campana Collection, CVA fasc. 8 (France 12), III, loc. cit. pl. 7, 28-30, Maximova, pl.

The favourite rosette in its simplest form (see above p. 44) is regular on wild-goat style vases in their later phases, though it also occurs on a small scale on Corinthian plastic vases, e.g. the fat man from Rhodes (p. 46, n. 21, above) and a fragment of uncertain shape from Naucratis in the British Museum. In the latter case it has a fringe of dots, as on our eagle's head no. 18. The maeander swastika, a common East Greek filling orna- ment, appears as an isolated motive on the necks of Caeretan Hydriae (cf. Giglioli, L'Arte Etrusca, Pls. 128-9). The horse's head (pl. V, 3) from FIG. 3.-WUIRZBURG I50. the base of the Berlin antelope's head (Fig. i a), seems to be related to the horses on a plate from Rhodes in Berlin 35 and a dish-fragment from Naucratis in the British Museum,36 both of which show a similar primitive rendering of the bit, though on neither is it of the same type. The relation, however, is not close.37 On examination of details, then, our vases show connexions both with the Ionian and the Creto-Corinthian traditions; in general style they seem to 'me to stand far closer to the latter. This is compatible with several origins: they might be made in Crete under mild Ionian influence, 33 Maximova, pl. XLIV, 166; Johansen, pl. XLI, 5: Payne, Necrocorinthia, pp. 80, fig. 23, 171, fig. 71. 34 Cf. the lion's head from Italy in the Louvre 38, Maximova, pl. XLIII, 163, there classed as Italo- Corinthian. L. 8-5 cm.

The proveniences strongly favour the West, particularly Etruria. Of the five exact proveniences one is in Campania, the other four are in Etruria; two more are certainly from Etruria and a third probably; three others from Italy; none recorded from elsewhere. It has been suggested 38-and I personally think the suggestion sound-that in the second half of the sixth century there were a number of Greek workshops established in Etruria, probably at Caere, which produced the class of vases known as Chalcidian, and the Caeretan hydriae. Langlotz 39 has already associated the Wiirzburg duck (5) with Caeretan hydriae, dating it to c. 530. The lack of Corinthian influence in the Caeretan hydriae seems against a very close association with our group, but I think it likely that the latter were in fact produced by a Greek settled in Etruria, under similar conditions and probably about the same time as the Chalcidian vases. The distribution of Chalcidian vases is like that of ours, though wider, and the relation of the Chalcidian style to those of Corinth and Ionia is almost exactly that which we have observed in our pieces. Once regarded as pure Ionian, this class has been shown by Rumpf40 to be far more intimately allied with Corinthian, though Ionian influence, particularly on the later vases, remains an undeniable fact.41 Chalcidian vases began to be made about the middle of the sixth century, the time that Corinth was ceasing to produce vases with figure decoration. It is likely that the Chalcidian industry arose to fill the gap so left.42 The dating of Corinthian plastic vases is less sure, but many types can be fixed in the first quarter of the sixth century,43 and there is little reason to believe that many examples belong after the middle. Our group may well have begun, like the Chalcidian series, as an effort to supplement the failing Corinthian supply. Such a supplement would have been especially desirable, as plastic vases, and indeed aryballoi in general, are rarely found in Attic pottery of this period.44 On this assumption hares like the Berlin example (I3)-standing closest to the Corinthian tradition and with least of the typical traits of our series would be among the earliest,45 while later the artist develops his own style with borrowings from Ionia. His only effort at life-drawing, the horse's head (pl. V, 3), suggests dim memories of an Ionian upbringing,46 38 See especially H. R. W. Smith, The Origin of Chalcidian Ware, pp. 10 ff., II2 ff., 133, n. I19, and passim. Prof. Smith has not absolutely proved Etruria the home of Chalcidian vases, but he has shifted the burden of proof on to those who believe otherwise, and established a strong probability that his hypothesis is actually correct. 39 P. 21, no. 148. 40 Chalkidische Vasen, pp. 145 ff. 41 Smith, loc. cit. pp. 112, 125 ff. 42 Smith, 112. 43 Payne, Necrocorinthia, pp. I76-80. 44 Cf. Beazley, BSA xxix, 200-4. This explains the lack on our vases of the Attic influence so prominent in Chalcidian. The rendering of the boar's tusk from the upper jaw (pl. V, 4) is best paralleled on two Attic pieces of the mid-sixth century-the Calydonian boars on the Francois vase and on a beautiful fragment from the Acropolis of Athens attributed by Rumpf to Sakonides (Graef, 782, pl. 50; Rumpf, Sakonides, 71 and p. 12). In nature the boar has a small upward-curling tusk from the upper jaw; this is almost always omitted in early Greek art. It might be suggested that our vases are themselves Attic, but the clay would hardly pass, and the total lack of finds from Athens, Attica, Boeotia, etc., put it nearly out of the question. 45 Perhaps also the lion's head in the Louvre (above, p. 47, n. 34)- 46 See above, p. 47-</page><page sequence="9">PLASTIC VASES 49 but though the drawing is amateur and crude, the system of forms-jaw, nose, mouth-is far more advanced than in the Ionian parallels cited above. The latter probably belong to the first quarter of the century, but our piece can be very much later. It can perhaps fairly be compared to the human heads doodled inside the mouth of a Fikellura amphora and under the foot of a Caeretan hydria.47 An indication of a date not earlier than the middle of the century is given by the shape of the pubic hair on no. Io (Fig. 3), and on the Corinthian vases from Vetulonia and in the Castellani Collection.48 Other Corinthian examples have a straight upper edge, and the same form is found on early sculptures, e.g. the Delphi twins and a splendid fragment from Delos,49 which cannot be much after 600oo B.C. The form with two arcs rising to a central point is certainly later; the earliest examples that I can find are on two bronze statuettes of about the middle of the sixth century, a warrior in Athens and one from Olympia in Berlin.50 In both cases the arcs are shallower and the central point is lower than on our vase, but much the same as on the two Corinthian pieces. The Attic vase signed by Priapos,51 which belongs early in the third quarter of the century, retains the old form, and the later Attic vase in Boston 52 is only more elegant, not essentially different. Attic red-figure, however, of the time of Euphronios and the succeeding generation offers examples of the three-peaked form at an exaggerated stage of refinement.53 A fair parallel to ours is found on a very early red-figure oenochoe in Goluchow, about 530 B.C.54 The evidence, then, as to the date and place of manufacture of our vases is scanty and non-committal, but it does seem to suggest that they were made about the same period as the Chalcidian series, under similar influences and at a centre commanding in a small way a similar distribution. One cannot, I am afraid, safely go further, and attribute them to a Chalcidian workshop. Caeretan hydriae were very likely produced at the same place and during part of the same period as Chalcidian,55 but they remain distinct fabrics, and our group may well have come from a workshop independent of either. Corinthian plastic vases are associated with the painted vases of that fabric by their clay, by the occurrence in both classes of plastic heads of identical style, and by combined pieces like the Louvre comast; 56 Ionian groups are established 47 Dilos, XVII, pl. LI, 7b; Louvre, E 696; Pottier, II, pl. 52. Cf. also the very crude outline heads on Corinthian ring-vases and the Corinthian practice of drawing outline heads on aryballos handles. 48 See above, p. 46. The Corinthian examples are less advanced in form than ours. 49 Deonna, 201o, fig. 94. Here the corners are cut almost square, and the ensemble is strikingly like such a vase as Maximova, pl. XXIX, 144. 50 Zervos, L'Art en Grice, fig. 203; Neugebauer, Katalog, i6i, pl. 21. 51 Hoppin Black-figure, 316; Beazley, BSA xxix, 202 f. 52 AJA 1918, 270, fig. I I; Beazley, loc. cit. p. 203. .3 Cf.

The arcs here coincide with, if they are not determined by, the lower contour of the belly-muscles, which are stylized as a series of circles. 55 Smith, 133, n. I i9, with references. Some Pontic vases may also have been made there (Smith, loc. cit. Ducati, Pontische Vases, 22 f.). 56 Payne, Necrocorinthia, 175 f., pls. 44, 5 and 48, 13-14. JHS-VOL. LVIII. E</page><page sequence="10">50 PLASTIC VASES as such in the first instance by proveniences, and it is not possible at present to associate them with particular series of painted vases. In our case the clay is non-committal though suggestive; 5 the proveniences and the relations to other styles can do no more than afford a possibility that these vases are actual products of a Chalcidian firm.58 If Chalcidian vases are ever proved to have been in fact made, as remains possible, at Chalkis, it will not follow that our series was made there too. On the other hand, the existence of a class of plastic vases of this style and with this distribution seems to me to go a little way towards confirming the hypothesis that Chalcidian and Caeretan vases were made in Etruria. In any case, the series is worth attention on its merits. There is no evidence in it of the mass production and decadence that overtook the Corinthian series, and the finest pieces-the boar's and eagles' heads and the ducks in Wtirzburg and the Vatican-are unsurpassed in their kind in the sixth century, and in the seventh only by the best Protocorinthian. MARTIN ROBERTSON. British Museum. 57 See above, p. 45, n. 18. It is a brownish clay with a reddish or golden tinge, of the same general character or Chalcidian and Cacretan. The shiny surface and glossy, but sometimes perishable varnish are also paralleled in both wares. 58 One can find certain resemblances, but nothing in the least conclusive: the Chalcidian use of the step-pattern-an old-fashioned pattern far more boldly exploited than in other wares of the period-- produces an effect, and implies an approach, similar to that of the dot and dash style; crenelation is a favourite pattern in Chalcidian for dress-borders, helmet-crests, etc.; Chalcidian eagles often have long heads (Rumpf, pls. VII, XIV, XXII)--a peculiarity arrived at in our vases by the demarcation of a separate area between the brow and the beak; the high-piled eyebrows of the boar give it a real likeness to the noble cattle of the Garyvones amphora (Rumpf, pl. VIII). Perhaps also worth noting are the speckling of the boar's skin on the Munich hydria (Rumpf, pl. XXIII), and of the ear on a fragmentary eye-cup in the Villa Giulia (Rumpf, pl. CXCII); also the fringe of strokes round the panther's mask drawn in outline on the Phineus cup (Rumpf, pl. XLIII, seen better FR I 216). The round heads of the ducks with their incised eyes are not unlike those of the Philadelphia stand (Smith, 89, fig. B, pls. 9, Io). The eyebrows of the owl with their spiral ends have already been compared with those on Chalcidian eye-cups (above p. 46, n. 30).</page><page sequence="11">i-iiii -i ,iiiiiiii i ---:i:~_::-:i iii::ii:?::i~ ?:-;: ::i :::--iii9siii~~:i?ii~;:fii~,: , -4W .--: 1 AND 2, BRITISH MUSEUM; 3, BERLIN; 4 AND 5, WURZBURG.
