<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SERPENT AS A SYMBOL OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY J. P. de Souza Ancient myth and legend bear testimony to the association in the mind of primitive man of the serpent with the generative powers of Nature. In the language of symbolism, "the serpent is life-force in the sphere of life matter." It is a figure of life in all its manifestations. The English word 'viper' is derived from the Latin word vipera , which is made up from two other Latin words : vivus, living and parere, to bring forth. The old Cornish term for serpent was bref, that is bereff, Father Life. In Arabic Hiya means both life and serpent. The Yahwist writer gives the name of the first woman in Genesis as Hawwah, and explains it by saying that she wa3 so called because she was the mother of all living {hay). Hawwah is connected with the same Hebrew root, hay, but probably means «life' rather than 'living' or 'life-giving'. Hence, Clement of Alexandria equates Eve with Life. An ancient inter- pretation8 adopted by Wellhausen and some other modern scholars give Hawwah the meaning 'serpent', and finds in Genesis a trace of the pri- mitive belief that earthly life originated in a serpent, as, in someform of the Babylonian cosmology, all things spring from Tiamat, the primeval dragon. According to Wake, the idea most intimately associated with the serpent was that of life, "not present merely but continued and probablyeverlasting." "In all mythological language," says Moor, "the snake is an emblem of immortality" As a symbol of life, the ser- pent is also a symbol of fertility and of healing. It has to this day</page><page sequence="2">ioò ťémained a symbol of good health, as is witnessed by the stamp depicting the snake-encircled rod of Aesculapius, the Greek God of Medicine, issued by the United Nations to commemorate World Health Day on April 7, 1956. In India, the evidence, both literary and artistic, for the serpent as a symbol of life from very early times is impressive, if not overwhel- ming. Although it is not possible to trace this symbolism in Vedic literature, the association of the serpent with life belongs to a primitive sphere of thought. The Mähabhardta is a rich mine of information in this respect. In the very first book of the Great Epic the serpents figure prominently in the story of the churning of the primeval ocean to produce amr% the drink of immortality. It is with the assistance of two leading Nagarajas that the devas succeeded in producing this mir- aculous beverage. When the detas were unable to move Mount Man- dara, which was to be used aś a churning stick, it was the serpent- king Ananta that lifted up the mountain for them at the request of Vishnu and Brahma, while the serpent-King Vasuki was twisted round the mountain as a churning rope. Although the serpents helped to produce amrta9 they did not apparently partake of it when it was brought forth in a white cup by Dhanyantari (or Dhanwantari), who emerged from the milky ocean in the course of the churning operations. But the serpents were desirous of becoming immortal and they got a golden opportunity to fulfil their desire when Garuda asked them as to what he should do to obtain his and his mother's, Vinata's release from bondage to Kadru, the serpent mother, and to her serpent brood. Incidentally, Vinata had become the slave of Kadru before Garuda was bom by losing a wager with Kadru, which the latter won through an ingenious piece of deception. The serpents promised Garuda that they would free him and his mother from srevitude if he could procure for them from heaven the drink of immortality. Garuda attempted the seemingly impossible feat, and, fortified by a sumptuous repast, which included the devouring of an elephant and a tortoise, both of fabulous propor- tions, he flew to heaven and battled with the celestials, routing them all. Still Garuda could not snatch away the pot of amrta as it was guarded by two ferocious serpents of fearful size. But they Were no match for the giant eagle who, having "mangled them into pieces," seized the pot containing the celestial nectar, and flew away with it. After further adventures on his way back, Garuda hastened to the</page><page sequence="3">101 abode of the Nagas, placed the precious pot bfore them, and secured his and his mother's release from bondage to the serpents. But the serpents were denied the fruits of their seeming victory by a piece of counter deception. While the serpents were engaged in performing their ablutions before drinking the sacred amrta , Indra, by a prior arrange- ment with Garuda, swooped down and snatched away the pot of ambrosia. When the Nagas, having performed the prescribed religious rites, came all eagerness to drink amrta, they found that the precious pot had vanished. Thereupon, they greedily licked up the sharp kusa grass, whereon Garuda had placed the pot, and, as a result, their tongues were split. Thus, on a literal interpretation of this mythical episode, narrated in the Mahdbhardta , it would appear that the serpents only succeeded in acquiring forked tongues but failed to gain immortality. But if we accept Moor's rendering of the myth, the serpents did succeed in acquiring immortality. Says he, "A few drops of this immortal beverage falling on a species of grass called kusa , it became eternally consecrated; and the serpents greedily licking it up so lacerated their tongues with the sharp grass that they have ever since remained forked ; but the boon of eternity was ensured to them by their thus partaking of the immortal fluid." Moor's rendering, however, seems to extract more from the text of the Gárudopakhyándá than is justified by a strict rendering of the original slokas, unless of course, he is giving-as he appears to do from the accounts of the myth given by Martin and Thomas, who, however, do not indicate their source-a version of the myth different from the one to be found in the first book of the Mdhabharatd. It is interesting to note in this connection chat in the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamish , whose origin can be traced back to the Sumerian times, it is the serpent that siole away the plant of immortality, which Gilgamish had obtained after many adventures, while the hero was bathing in a pool : "Gilgamish spied out a pool of cool water(and) therein descending Bathed in the water. (But here was) a serpent who snufF'd the plant's fragrance/Darted he up from the water and snatch'd the plant, uttering malison/As he drew back. Then Gilgamish sate him (and) burst into weeping." Echoes of this ancient Babylonian epic are to be found in the Hebrew story of the Fall of Man related in the third chapter of Genesis. It was</page><page sequence="4">102 because the first woman gave credenece to the deceitful serpent's assur- ance that the progenitors of the human race lost for themselves and for their progeny the original God-given attribute of immortality. All such primitive stories - Babylonian, Hebrew, Indian and others wherever they may occur-seem to be derived from an archetypal myth wherein it is probably the serpent that acquires the secret òf immortality, while man fails to do so. In any case, all such legends testify to the belief of the primitive man that the serpent is immortal. Two significant points emerge from the story of the bringing of ambrosia from heaven by Garuda at the instance of the Nagas. The very fact that the serpents are represented as being desirous of immor- tality is evidence of the close association in the primitive Indian mind of the serpent with immortality. Even the mere desire to become immortal could be equated with reality by adapting a remark made by Demosthenes : "For what man believes the serpent desires, that he also imagines to be true.*' Secondly, the fact that dmrtd is represented as being guarded by two serpents testifies not only to the mythical character of the ser- pent as the guardian of all precious things in general, but in parti- cular of the most precious commodity of all, namely, amrta. And to guard the drink of immortality is in the language of mythology to pos- sess the secret of immortality. In Hindu mythology, the ambrosial tree of immortality h placed on Mount Meru and is guarded by a serpent. The tree of immortality must itself be immortal like the serpent that guards it. According to a famous Hindu cosmogonie myth, which, in different forms is related in the Mdhabhdrdta and in the Purands , Visnu, con- ceived as the supreme deity, is supposed to sleep the sleep of creation in the primeval ocean couched on the coils of the world serpent Anants, 'the Endless One', 'the imperishable' also named Sessa, 'the remainder or residue'. That is, the world-serpent, according to the latter designa- tion, "is a figure representing the residue that remained after the earth, the upper and infernal regions, and all their beings had been shaped out of the cosmic waters of the abyss." With the emergence of Brahma, the Creator, from a lotus stemming from the navel of Visnu, the supreme deity awakes from his sleep to renewed action. His first great deed as preserver is the destruction of the two demons, Madhu and Kaitava, who threaten the new-borp Brahma,</page><page sequence="5">103 This mythical scene has been a favourite theme of Hindu plastic art. Visnu is shown reclining on the couch formed by the coils of sesha, whose multiheaded hood fòrms a sort of canopy over the deity's heáíL Usually, Visnu's consort, the goddess Sri, also Called Padma and Laksnii, is seen kneeling at the feet of the god. Zimmer looks upon the serpeht Ananta, in this myth and in its representations in Hindu art, as an animal counterpart of the anthropomorphic sleeper, the šuprefrié pro- genitor himself and justifiably so, for Ananta is also one of the many appellations, nay forms of Visnu.Inth eMahabharata the serpent Ananta is described as "a manifested form of Narayana," another näme of Visnu; while in the same epic Vrtra says, "I beheld in the battle the illustrious Hari, the powerful Narayana, he who is called Vaikuntha Purusha, Ananta, Shukla, Visnu" Sesha is also described as "a part of Vinsu". According to the Visnu Purana, "Below the seven Patalas is the form of Visnu, proceeding from the quality of darkness, which is called Sesha, " In Hindu art, the well-known representations of Visnu lying re- cumbent on Sesha belong to the Seventh Century A.D. The most famous of these is a beautiful relief carved on a panel on the south side of the Gupta Dasavatawa Temple of Deograh in Bundelkhad.. Anöther example of this type is to be found in one of the cave temples of Maha- mallapuram of the Paliava period. In a few rare representations Visnu is shown sitting in lalitdsand pose on the seat formed by the up- coiled Sesha, with the multiheaded serpent hood forming acanopy over the god's head. A remarkable specimen of this type is the colossal rock-cut image of Visnu seated on Sesa in Gave III at Badami. Outside India the only known example of this kind is to be found in the first of the series of sculptured panels illustrating episodes from the Ramdyana on the walls of the Siva temple at Prahbanan in Java. In the technical works on Hindu iconography the different types of the images of Vinsu Anantasyain or Sesayain are variously designated as Bhogasyanamurti, Yogasayan murti, Adimurti, Vaikuntha Nara- yana, and so on. It is not surprising that the serpent being so widely adopted as a symbol of life should be popular as a symbol of fertility. An illustra- tion of this aspect of the serpent symbol in India is provided by the stone slabs called nagakdls , whereon are carved various serpent forms. They are votive gifts from women who desire offspring and they are</page><page sequence="6">104 set up in temple court yards, at the entrance of villages and towns, near ponds, in which the Nagas are believed to dwell, and under trees. Zimmer reproduces several ndgakals, erected in the Seventeenth Century A. D. from the State of Mysore. Different serpent forms are carved on these slabs. Some of them exhibit a snake queen of the usual type with serpent tail and human body and with a canopy formed by the mutli- headed snake hood ; her arms folded across her breast support two serpent children who rise above her shoulders. Some slabs exhibit one sńake with a multiheaded hood, while others show the remarkable motif of the amorous serpent pair entwined in a loving embrace, with the heads facing each other. Perhaps the earliest known example of this historic design is to be found on the famous libation vase of King Gudea of Lagash of the Sumerian period, c. 2600 B.C. This ancient Mesopotamian device appears to have been diffused over a' wide cultural area and to have spread to India "at an extemely remote era before the arrival of the Aryans." In Hindu mythology the serpent possesses the elixir of life and the life-restoring jewel. _ In an incident related in the Mähabhdrotä, Duryo- dhana once poisoned his cousin Bhima and threw him into the Ganges. Bhima's seemingly lifeless body sank to the bottom of the river and entered the realm of the Nagas, who gave him their priceless elixir of life to drink. After drinking the rejuvenating beverage Bhima not only revived but rose immensely stronger than he was before. Thus, thanks to the serpents, Bhima had new life and had it abundantly. According to another myth nariated in the Mdhabarata, when the Raja ofManipura killed his father Arjuna, Ut upi, the Naga wife of Arjuna who was the daughter of the serpent-king Vasuki, remembered that her father possessed a magic jewel which had the power to restore a dead man to life. She sent the Raja to the underworld to obtain the lue- restoring jewel from Vasuki. He succeeded in his enterprise after a fight with Vasuki and, on his return to his kingdom with the jewel, he touched the corpse of Arjuna. with it, and Arjuna cams back to life, all his wounds having been miraculously healed. Indian folklore credits the serpent with the possession of the know- ledge of life-giving plants. Among some of the primitive tribes inhabiting the Indian subcontinent the Nagas are still invoked to cure diseases of all kinds, particularly loathsome sores. Parts of the l&gt;ody of a snake are valued as remedies. Among the laungthas ' there is but ope medicine current, the dried gall-bladder and the dung of the</page><page sequence="7">105 boa-constrictor, which is supposed to be, and is used as, a remedy for everything." In the Garo hills it is believed that the skin of a certain snake when applied to the part affected, cures pain. The association of the serpent with life is not, as we have seen at the very outset of this paper, confined to India but is common to the myths and legends of many nations. Therefore, in attempting to explain how the serpent came to be adopted in India as a symbol of life and the related vital 'phenomena, it would be a fruitful approach to the subject to pass in review to various explanations offered by scholars all over the world for the origin of the symbolism in question before we come to our own conclusion. The commonest explanation is based on the primitive belief that the snake rejuvenates itself by the periodic renewal of its skin. Thus "the serpent was believed to have no fear of old age" or to be immortal because it annually sloughs off its skin, apparently renewing its life. The connection of the rattlesnake with life and healing in the New World is accounted for by Brinton by reference to the phenomenon of the rattlesnake casting off its skin every spring. This explanation is satisfactory so far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. The fact of the snake's renewal of its skin periodically makes the serpent an apt symbol of rejuvenation, even of immortality , but not of the generation of life itself. Another explanation is derived from the ease with which the pliable serpent can be symbolically made to form a circle by inserting its tail into its mouth. In fact, the circle formed by the serpent swal- lowing its own tail is a universally-recognised symbol of eternity- and understandably so because the circle has no beginning nor end. However, though this manner of representing the serpent makes it an excellent symbol of eternity and of life eternal, it does not suggest the emergence of life itself. This deficiency the following explanation seeks to supply. Symbolically the serpent is universally identified with the life-giving and life-sustaining aquatic element. "The serpent," says Zimmer, "re- presents the life-bestowing fertilizing element of the terrestrial waters." Like the lotus stemming from the navel of Visnu, sleeping the sleep of creation couched on the coils of the world-serpent Ananta in the pri- meval ocean, the serpent is both a symbol of water and of life, rather</page><page sequence="8">106 of the living waters. And in this famous creation myth Visnu himself, the supreme procreator, is "the personification of the life giving power of the waters." Although Visnu is the sun, he also "resides in water" nay "he is water or the humid principle generally." From this point of view Visnu is Narayana. In a verse, quoted in several of the Purdnas, Manu explains the origin of the word-Narayana' This verse is rendered into English by Sir Silliam Jones thus : "The waters are called Nara, because they were the production of Nara, or "the spiriť of God ; and since they were his first Ayana, or -place of motion, he thence is named Narayana or 'moving on the waters." SirWilliaminrenderingNarayanaas'movingon the waters' was perhaps unduly influenced by the words of Genesis," the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." Asraya, however, explains 'ayana' as 'place of abiding 9 instead of 'place of motion.5 Narayana would therefore mean 'he whose place of abiding is the deep." As the second person of the Hindu divine triad Visnu is the pre- server. But his most outstanding characteristic is that of "a Divine Peravader, infusing his essence for special purposes into created things. The yord 'Visnu3 is derived from the Sanskrit word vis meaning to pervade and v isnu in Sanskrit means Vydpdndsild9 that is, permeating and covering the universe. This character of Visnu is well brought out in the Visnu Ptirdna : "Nature (Pradhana) and soul (Puman) are both of the character of dependants, and are ecncompas^ed by the energy of Visnu, which is one with the soul of the world, and which is the cause of the separation of those two (soul and nature) at the period of dis- solution ; of their aggregation in the continuance of things ; and of their combination at the season of creation." The root vis is used fairly often in the Rg-Vedd and primarily means 'to be active'. ,To quote the Visnu Purdnd again, "In the same manner as the wind ruffles the surface of the water in a hundred bubbles, which of themselves are inert, so the energy of Visnu influences the world, consisting of inert nature and soul". Interpreting the myth of Visnu Anantasayin and its representations in Indian art, Zimmer considers the sleeping Visnu, Ananta on whose coils Visnu is couched in his sleep, and the primeval ocean on which the world-serpent floats, as "triune manifestations of the single divine imperishable, cosmic substance, the energy underlying and inhabiting all the forms of life." The explanation of the serpent as a symbol of life based on the association of the serpent with water has much to recommend it for our</page><page sequence="9">107 acceptance but symbolically speakingvit does not go to the root of the matter. Water is contained by the earth, and it is not the contained but the container that is fundamental. Homer describes thé earth as life- giving. Earth is indeed the primordial mother of life, and the serpent is an embodiment not only of "the water of life issüing from the deep body of Mother Earth" but of Mother Earth herself. Frankfořťs observation on the ancient Mesopotamian symbol of the entwined serpent pair is also true of the serpent symbol in India. Says Frankfort, "The copulating vipers are known as manifestations of the chthonic aspect of the god of natural vitality, who is manifest in ali life breaking forth from the earth." Riven-Carnac suggests that the snake is a symbol of the phallus, and the phallic suggestive ne ss of the symbol of the copu- lating serpents wherever it occurs, be it in ancient Mesopotamia where this particular symbol apparently originated, or in ancient Greece where it forms an indispensable part of the caduceus of Hermes, or in India where it figures on the nagakals , makes it a most expressive symbol of procreation. In India, the primeval world serpent, Adisesha, is especially known as the bearer of the earth, and hence is a symbol of thp earth. - &gt; In, the beautiful words of Vishnu Purana "Shesha bears the entire world like a diadem, upon his head, and he is the foundation on which the seven Patalas rest." The Mdhabharáta explains how Ananta came to live underneath the earth, alone supporting the world at the command of Brahma. It is asa symbol of the earth that Ananta figures in the sculptures illustrating the Varaha Avatara of Visnu. His usual appearance in such scenes is that of a snake combined with the upper half of a human figures, with a multiheaded snake hood rising like a canopy over his head. In most representations his two hands are raibed in the attitude of ndmaskara. It is significant that, while no mention of Sesha is made in any of the versions of the myth to be found in the Mahabhdr ata and the purands , in technical works of Hindu iconography it is stated that in plastic representations of the third avatara it is the serpent Sesha that supports one of the feet of the boar while rising from thé waters. The conclusion is inescapable that the earth which is brought up by the divine boar from the abyss of the primeval waters is symbolized a in plastic representations by Sesha. Among the earliest known renderings of the Varaha Avatajj^^^ļ Indian plastic art is the large rock-cut sculpture of Udayagiri beh^^^H</page><page sequence="10">108 to the Gupta period (c. A.D. 400). Two other ancient examples of this scene occur among the rock-carvings of Badami. (Sixth Cen- Century A.D.) and at Mahamallapuram (Seventh Century A.D.) In all these representations the left foot of the boar-headed god rests on the coils of the world-serpent Sesha, who is depicted according to the iconographie description given above. In the Badami sculpture, however, Sesha is accompanied by a Nagi, presumably his consort. This is also the case with the sculptures of the Varaha Avatara from Baragaon ad Khajuraho. To conclude, the myths pertaining to the world-serpent Sesha and their representations in Indian art, when interpreted in the context of the serpent as a symbol of life, not only throw a flood of light on the symbolism under discussion but seem to afford the best explanation of its origin.* For Sesha is not only a symbol of the life-bestowing and life-sustaining terrestrial waters but of the earth itself, the mother of life.</page></plain_text>
