<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALL AND IMAGE IN INDIAN ART STELLA KRAMRISCH Visiting Research Professor, Oriental Studies, University of Pennsylvania (Read April 26, 1957) THE point of this paper is that the divine power enshrined in the inner cell of the Hindu Temple is viewed by Hindu architects and archi- tectural treatises as though projecting itself through the walls of the temple and expressing itself on and beyond the walls as buttresses and images. The foremost monument of Indian art is the temple, and it is the centre of all the arts. It is, moreover, practically the only monument which has survived the ravages of climate, time, and wars. The temples which will be considered here are of stone. Their types belong to the millennium from about the fifth to the fifteenth century A.D. The relation of wall and image will be considered in three respects: architec- turally, sculpturally, and with regard to the paintings on the walls. The Indian temple, the house of God, is en- closed in walls of great thickness, one-fourth part, as a rule, of the inner width of the sanctuary, and these walls enshrine the symbol or image of the deity to whom the building is consecrated. The symbol or image occupies the centre of the sanctuary and is known as the Jiva, the "Life" of the temple in which it dwells; it is to the temple what the principle of life, the vital breath, the soul, is to the body of man. The Agni Purana (LXI.23-25), a text compiled in the ninth century but based on older sources, speaks of the Jiva of the temple. The walls are its body. Permeated at the time of consecration by the Supreme Principle, the temple is at once both the house and the body of God. As His house, the temple is a work of architecture; as His bodily symbol, the walls of the building are imbued by the Supreme Principle. The concep- tion of sacred architecture as house and at the same time as symbolic presentation is Vedic; the Satapatha Brahmana (XIII.8.1.1) speaks of an altar as being both house and symbol (grham va prajfidnam va). The temple is the house of the divine Presence and is its very body. The temple itself, there- fore, should be worshipped as Purusa, the essen- tial and unchanging and unaffected Principle of all things, says the Silparatna (XVI. 114), a text on architecture compiled in the sixteenth century. Stone, the building material, is converted by the rites of architecture into a potent substance, charged with the divine Presence. Throughout their massive, three-dimensional extent, the building stones become representations of Prakrti, the unevolved material of the Universe which is capable of change and evolution and is different from Purusa, the unalterable Essence, which has the Jiva of the temple for its centre. The material of the walls of the temple, of the work of art to be, is transmuted to a state when it too becomes potent and causal and its activity is felt by the architect who gives it expression on the temple walls. In order to evoke the power of the temple stones, they are invoked as goddesses when the foundations of the walls are being laid, and they are addressed in rhythmical, magic formulae called mantras. These mantras invoke the stones by many names, such as Pfurna, "Fulfilled One," Caturagra, "Square," and handsome in all parts, "Perfect One," perfectly proportioned. This rite also goes back to Vedic practice (Vaj.S. XX.9; XI.44, Kanva recension) and the mantra is repeated in many of the textbooks on archi- tecture from the sixth century downward through the period when the great temples were built (Visnudharmottara, 11.29.84-89; Brhat Samhita, 52.112). To recapitulate, the substance of the temple walls is stated to be Prakrti, or undifferentiated matter, which is given form by the Jiva and then as receptacle of the Jiva becomes potent with the potency of the Jiva or Purusa, the Supreme Principle. In some of the figurative expressions of the texts the temple as Purusa, as the Supreme Principle in manifestation, is endowed with eyes and mouth, neck, chest, legs, and the other parts of the body of man. But unlike sculpture and painting, which produced images of the gods in the shape of man, architecture abstains from such physical representations.

This type of temple, as also figure 3, has two sets of walls. The inner wall here is square, on both sides, and is surrounded by an ambulatory in the interior of the temple. The outer wall of this ambulatory is square on the inside, whereas the outside shows a buttress projected from the middle of each side.

Form is given to the indwelling spiritual Essence and to the evolving power of the material Substance by the ordering of the architectural shape so that it conveys by its masses their dis- tribution and proportions. The meaning of the temple is given full ex- position at the height of the evolution of its architecture in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Before that time, the walls were less explicit or articulate and, in the earliest forms of temples, the wall surfaces were altogether plain. In this- summary and schematic sketch (fig. 1) of the division of a groundplan, based upon a descrip- tion in a sacred text, the Vaikhanasagama (Ch. X), compiled some time between the fifth and the seventh centuries, the temple is square, but it is not for long to remain bounded in its simple geometry. As another sketch plan shows (fig. 2), this one drawn from an early eleventh-century compendium on architecture (the Samaran- ganastitradhara) describing a temple-type well established at that age, the walls are projected ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.. .....i ....

The innermost space of the sanctuary is square (cf. fig. 2), whereas the walls project into the inner ambulatory with their buttresses. The outer walls of the shrine are square on their inner side, whereas the outside shows its major buttresses widely projected into space in the centre of each face.</page><page sequence="3">VOL. 102, NO. 1, 19581 WALL AND IMAGE IN INDIAN ART 9 from the centre of each face in aliquot parts of the area of the building to a multiple of the wall's own thickness, so as to form a buttress in eleva- tion. In the next stage of evolution (fig. 3), which can be illustrated by a sketch plan from the same architectural text, the projection of the central buttress is extended and made more complex. The main buttress is flanked by lesser projections or offsets. There are many other possibilities of extending the buttress outward. However, the inside wall always retains its ori- ginal straightness (fig. 4). In the most elaborate examples of multiple or complex buttresses, the walls become like many-angled bulwarks, as in the temple of Ambarnath, near Bombay, built in the year 1060. An additional hall may be built before the shrine and it, too, then develops its own system of buttresses, of course observing the architectural proportions and style of the temple. If we now retrace our steps to the earliest extant (fig. 5) examples of stone temples, we find in the fifth century a cubical building with plain walls. This construction is illustrated by a shrine at Sanchi, in Mid-India, and by another temple (fig. 6) with plain walls, of about the sixth or seventh century in Aihole, southwest of Bombay. The walls in the latter example sup- port a high superstructure. About the same time (fig. 7), a temple-the one on the right-in Mahakut., close to Aihole, has the central pro- jection on each side of its vertical walls extended FIG. 4.

It is carried on by the buttress of the super- structure, in the middle of each of its sides. to the superstructure. This central pier serves as a support for itself only; it does not receive or carry any outward thrust-it is not a structural necessity. Rather, it carries towards the be- holder the potency held within the temple mass. Such a buttress is technically called Ratha, which also means "chariot." Like a chariot, the wall comes outward from its own midst and it carries in a niche, like a rider in a chariot, an image of the deity to whom the temple is consecrated. The image in the niche is regularly of some one of the deity's main aspects, or of his consort, or of his son, or of one of his avataras. The name of such a niche is Ghanadvara, or solid-mass door; that is, a door which is no door. No one can enter through it, but the deity inside the temple has become manifest on the wall through it. The wall, which is filled with power from the deity within it, makes manifest the deity by means of a progression of buttresses and of images. The walls are shown as if propelled from the centre toward the four directions; as such, they constitute a dynamic and symbolic architectural form. The walls also carry for- ward, in the images they bear, aspects of the deity. Thus the devotee looks at the temple first when he approaches the building, and then, particularly during the rite of walking around it, when he not only recognizes the images, but feels their impact. The wall now comes alive with images. Collateral niches on either side of the central Ratha are barely indicated on this temple. But about a century later, on the Para- suramesvar Temple in Bhuvanesvar (fig. 8), on the northeast coast of India, the side niches have evolved into minor offsets of the wall. They occupy the entire height of the vertical surface only, but do not fully accompany the ascent of the main buttress. All the Rathas of this temple were originally full of images of the celestial host disporting themselves. The host of images in this phase of temple architecture (fig. 9) appear as a rich texture of the wall. Single figures or groups are inscribed between flat pilasters whatever may be the bodily contortions and moods conveyed by the design, as of this acrobatic celestial dancer whose shape is fitted in the shallow rectangle which it fills. The next stage in the development is shown in the ca. tenth-century Siddhegvar temple (fig. 10), and also at Bhuvanesvar, Orissa. In the mighty projections of its central buttress and the lesser Rathas, the wall seems to have taken several steps forward. Its entire body appears furrowed by chases and recesses, which set the single piers into boldest relief. This edifice is singularly free from anthropomorphic and theriomorphic images, except for those in its main niches and on the four main projections from the spire. But the architectural image is systematically organized so as to progress into space at every FIG. 8. Para'surames'var Temple, Bhuvane'svar, Orissa, ca. A.D. 700. The importance of the central buttress of the wall is increased by its greater width and the intro- duction of horizontal mouldings similar to those of the superstructuire. The perpendicular walls and the curvi- linear superstructure are coalesced into one theme.</page><page sequence="5">VOL. 102, NO. 1, 19581 WALL AND IMAGE IN INDIAN ART 11 one of the spire's many levels. Further progres- sions are embodied in the miniature replicas of the whole tower. These replicas are purely architectural symbolical forms, without struc- tural function. They make manifest (vyakta) the potential which exists unmanifest (avyakta) inherent in their material substratum, called Prakrti. In them it has now become informed by the Purusa, the Spirit, whose vital essence they hold. The leonine shapes jutting into space midway of the ascending curve of the tower proper are theriomorphic symbols of power. At all times, Sakti, or Power, conceived as the female energy of divinity or goddess, is symbolized in the shape of a lion. This power was present in the building stones which were invoked as goddesses at the laying of the foundation. (In front of the temple is a hall structure which has piers which are proportionately adjusted to its purpose.) In this temple, the buttresses facing the four directions are akin to the form of a four-faced Siva-Linga (fig. 11). The symbol of Siva, the Linga, is a cylinder, rounded at the top. It is replete with the presence of Siva; and this is visualized by a form where four faces or aspects of the god are seen to have emerged from its central pillar. This four-faced Linga of the eighth century in Kuthera, in Mid-India, is, in anthropomorphic imagery, analogous to the architectural symbolism of the temple buttresses facing the four directions. The climax of this development of the buttress appears in the Linigaraja Temple, Orissa, of the eleventh century (fig. 12). This projects its multiple buttresses so far into space that some of the mouldings seem to be clutching the pier FIG. 9. Celestial dancer.

This virtuosity of organization of sym- bolic structure in all its intricacies gives final exposition of the power held to be inherent in the temple walls. Looking backwards from this temple to the early shrines, we see that in it the walls express logically the meaning which was only latent and unexpressed in the early buildings. Where sculptures appear on the fully evolved wall, as on a twelfth-century shrine in the Liiigaraja Temple precints, the images appear to be propelled into position from the wall to which they still cling (fig. 13). Such images are the highest accents on the outward progression of the wall. A tree goddess, in the ease of her posture and radiance of her shape, leans on her Ratha. Behind her, projecting not so far from the wall, are the steps of the subjacent Rathas, textured with carved scrollwork, which constitute degrees in the forward manifestation of the in- dwelling Principle. When the sculptural image on the wall is carved in high relief and sometimes almost com- pletely in the round, the power active in and through the massive walls is communicated to the sculptural form. The images of the divinities have come forward towards the beholder, dis- charged from the core of the bulwark of the walls. FIG. 14. Women and children on their way to worship.

A corresponding vision prevails in Indian wall paintings-in the form in which they are known to us from the beginning of our era throughout the first millennium. They are organized in a perspective which is directed towards the be- holder instead of leading away from him, as is the case with optical perspective in Western painting from the Renaissance on. A wall painting (fig. 14) from Ajanta of the middle of the first millennium shows groups of women, children, and flying celestials on a sloping ground, full of flowers, in front of and close to a grotto. The grotto is built up by means of painted cubes and other stereometric shapes. Like a trumpet it opens from the ground of the picture with its dense tapestry-like vegetation, and sets forth the leisurely gathering of women and children. The scene of the painting breaks off in the foreground at the bottom, with beamlike protruding shapes, a convention for rocks such as those of the grotto. Together they create the illusion of the picturial space in which the figures appear to move. All the figures in the Ajanta paintings are fully modelled by means of color, shade, and outline. They stand out from their opaque background. The lithe roundedness of their appearance is accompanied by a phantasmagoria of cubes and crags, the shapes of rocks, the shapes of nature and imagination, coming forward toward the beholder from their ground together with the main images. The ancient texts on painting speak of the painter as drawing toward himself (akarsati; Sri Khasarpana Lokegvara Sadhana) the re- quired form of his inner vision. The image, they say, is led forward (anlyate) by him (Sad- hanamdld, 98) from the wall, which the texts call the "white wall of attention" (avabodha) (Tattvadipika, 1.37 on Pravacanasara). There, the image should be rounded into relief (nimnon- natam; Silparatna, 112; Sakuntala VI.13-14), burgeoning forth [sphut, Manasolldsa L.3.162; unmil (Maharthamanjarl, p. 44)] in color. Thus the painting emerges on the "white wall of attention" from that innermost level of reference which is at one, in the monumental structure of the temple, with the Jiva, the innermost life.</page></plain_text>
