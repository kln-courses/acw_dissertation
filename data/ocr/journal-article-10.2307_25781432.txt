<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RESOURCES OF UNREPRESENTABILITY: A Lacanian Glimpse of Beckett's Three Dialogues Steven Barfield Through comparing the Three Dialogues with certain aspects of psychoanalysis (specifically those relating to clinical practice and Lacan's understanding of the 'real'), this article argues that Beckett's text is preoccupied by a set of questions regarding the centrality and role of 'unrepresentability' in art, which are strikingly similar to those raised by psychoanalysis. Three Dialogues relies in certain formal ways (as well as alludes to) the patterns established in the therapeutic session and Beckett's paradoxi cal argument is a considered attempt to ask how unrepresentability can be productive, which parallels the function of the 'real' in psychoanalysis. Beckett's Three Dialogues has become increasingly central to critical attempts to analyse and to explain his work, in particular his later prose and drama. (For example, Bersani and Dutoit, 14-25). While this text is self-consciously eccentric, frequently obscure and often gnomic, it has nonetheless been taken to suggest an aesthetic argument regarding modem art and the artist, which is analogous to Beckett's own practice as a writer. Beckett's later prose and drama has come to be seen as a "literature of the unword" (as he described it in the letter to Axel Kaun) whose emphasis is on "decreation" rather than creation, of reduction rather than expansion (1983, 51-4). This in turn, has suggested to a number of commentators aware of Beckett's long-standing interest in the visual arts, that the movements of Modernist art represent a source of plausible parallels to his own texts. Lois Oppenheim in her recent and important book, The Painted Word: Samuel Beckett's Dialogue with Art, draws together the strands of this critical tradition to argue that Three Dialogues shows that it is the visual paradigm of experimentation and the 'anti-aesthetic' in twentieth-century 15</page><page sequence="2">art, which best serves to account for the development of Beckett's later work (albeit mediated through the aesthetics of Merleau-Ponty).1 She asserts that "the ever increasing minimalism that characterises the evolution of Beckett's fictive and dramatic style is a paradoxical result of his preoccupation with the visual as a prototype" (Oppenheim, 29). While there are good reasons to be wary of accepting any non-literary discourse (whether that of art, music or philosophy) as a privileged hermeneutic location for analysing Beckett work (insofar as discursive, generic and institutional differences make visual art very different from literature), there is no doubt that the reading of Three Dialogues has become 'overdetermined' by assumptions about the visual context of his work. In this article I am not concerned to dispute this critical tradition, but instead to suggest that the text can be read as in dialogue with psychoanalysis in a number of integral ways. One reason we should be careful of viewing them as straightforward art history, is that it signally refuses to discuss individual works by Tal Coat, Masson and van Velde or even to cite examples of them. This not only makes it difficult to be sure to which parts of the career of these three painters Beckett is specifically referring, but also make the reader aware that we should not leap to the conclusion that this is any kind of orthodox example of art history, despite the subject matter.2 In addition, the text is problematic insofar as it hybridises and parodies a variety of traditional textual genres, which makes its overall generic status difficult to determine (Barfield and Tew, 93, 95-7). However, there is one particularly important context for reading the Three Dialogues, which is less familiar than these, but nonetheless significant. This is the way it performatively alludes to and even mimes psychoanalysis as therapeutic and clinical practice (there is also a cryptic quotation from Freud in the text that will be discussed later). It would appear to recognize that the analytic session itself has a dialogic structure and throughout alludes (often comically) to the types of remarks and actions that are normally found in therapy. The fact that the text has a 'dramatic' form, where the exchanges between B. and D. recall the vaudeville acts of Beckett's clowns such as Vladimir and Estragon (or for that matter improvisatory work in theatre games and rehearsal) is complementary to an understanding of the performative nature of 16</page><page sequence="3">therapy and Beckett's decision to use such a form should be seen as a deliberate attempt to invoke possible parallels.3 In addition, the psychoanalytic session shares a critical sense of emphemerality with dramatic performance, as both leave only traces once they are finished. In fact, on a formal level, the text seems determined to play with the dialogic structures of analysis, rather than the more traditional written genres of psychoanalysis (such as the essay or the case-history). At the end of the first dialogue, D. remarks, "Perhaps that is enough for today" (26) and in the third dialogue a stage direction tells us B. answers, "A fortnight later" (30). "Perhaps that is enough for today" is not what is said in a formal interview or dialogue, but approximates what a therapist often says to an analysand as a way of closing an individual session. Why specify a 'fortnight' later unless to make it sounds as if a weekly session (typical in psychoanalysis) has been missed? The Three Dialogues seem marked by an odd and partial sense of temporal and durational regularity at the level of their form, which would seem alien to a series of mock interviews. The two supposed speakers Beckett and Duthuit become 'B.' and 'D.' reminding the reader of material based on a psychoanalytic session where the preservation of anonymity is conventional. In addition, this pseudo anonymity is a further comic effect in this particular context, since we all know who these 'characters' are really supposed to be. And what of B.'s apparently unmotivated emotional outburst at the end of the second dialogue? "B. -(Exit weeping)" (29). This material reflects the powerful 'emotional work' of therapy. Tears, silence, ellipsis and circumlocution are as important to the psychoanalytic session as connected thoughts and sentences and all of these are central to the text of Three Dialogues. In fact, at one point the whole text comically inverts (and yet invokes) the normal logic of analysis when D. remarks, "Try and bear in mind that the subject under discussion is not yourself (31). In the psychoanalytic session the analysand typically speaks of himself/herself by talking about others or material external to their own lives, sometimes to such an extent that the analyst must intervene to make the patient realise this is in fact themselves they are speaking of. In fact, as the dialogue 'progresses' D. is thrust like an analyst into the role of one whose function is to allow B. to stay and talk and to become responsible for initiating discussion through asking questions. It is 17</page><page sequence="4">noticeable that this happens to D.'s role progressively throughout the Three Dialogues. In the first dialogue the exchange seems much more equal (D. asks three main questions and offers a number of his own views), but as they continue to talk B.'s comments get longer and D.'s role becomes more and more that of a questioner (in the third dialogue D. asks mostly questions). D. would also appear to be the one whose role it is to keep the dialogue open until the issues are resolved, or in psychoanalytic terms, the analyst striving to keep analysis in progress. In the third of the dialogues, B. remarks, "Would it not be enough if I simply went away?" D. replies, mirroring the analyst conscious of the need to work through unresolved material, "You have begun. Finish" (31). Finally, B. remarks, "I know that all is required now, in order to bring even this horrible matter to an acceptable conclusion [...] I know that my inability to do so places myself and perhaps an innocent, in [...] an unenviable situation, familiar to psychiatrists" [emphasis added] (32). This is of course intended as a humorous remark, but B. is not simply joking in commenting that "only psychiatrists could understand what he is saying" as a way of closing this unsettling argument. This very inability to close the argument, to go forward or backwards, confirms both a relationship and a context that therapists or psychiatrists would find "familiar" (The use of the word "psychiatrist" here, rather than therapist or psychoanalyst alerts us to the clinical or therapeutic context; a term such as psychoanalyst might have led the reader to a purely theoretical frame of reference). This aporia that closes the Three Dialogues could thus be seen as either a very real gesture towards the impossibility of representation of material (the argument that B. is trying to articulate) due to repression that cannot be brought to consciousness and a joke regarding that same impossibility. What seems to be 'unenviable' is not the aporetic position itself that B. describes in his argument, but the fact that this cannot settle into any kind of static conclusion. Rather it has an interminable structure produced by the combination of an obligation (drive) to express and the reiterative impossibility of such expression. In this sense, B.'s own position is intended to equate with that which he locates in van Velde: "The situation of him who is helpless, cannot act, in the event cannot paint, since he is obliged to paint" (29). 18</page><page sequence="5">Why does Beckett wish to foreground the clinical or therapeutic dimension of analysis in a series of dialogues ostensibly about aesthetics? Why furthermore is his remark, ("an unenviable situation, familiar to psychiatrists") intended to be appropriate or even useful to the readers of this series of dialogues? To provide an answer to these questions, it is necessary to examine the arguments of the Three Dialogues in detail in relation to Lacan's elaboration of the slippery problematic of the "real."4 Lacan's topological figure of the Borromean knot (from 1975) indicates the interdependence of the three "Orders": Real, Symbolic and Imaginary (Lacan 1998, 124; Evans, 18-20). The real is thus never separate from the symbolic (the order of language and the differential play of signifiers) and the imaginary (the order of images and imagination), but nonetheless radically different from them and a space of radical indeterminacy and contingency. It is not truth, as opposed to the illusionary play of language and ideology, nor is it an unknowable (but a priori) Kantian Thing-in-itself. While it clearly resists the symbolic (and hence the process of representation), it does so because the real "is nothing but this impossibility of its inscriptions [...] in itself it is nothing at all, just a void, an emptiness in a symbolic structure marking some central impossibility" (Zizek 1989, 173). In this sense, although the real interfaces with the symbolic and the imaginary, it does so as the paradox of the impossible representation of representational impossibility, as a formal and constitutive incompletion within the structuration of the symbolic (and thus representation), which "resists symbolisation absolutely" (Lacan 1988a, 66). Ragland reminds us that we should not confuse the real with any undifferentiated material reality pre-existent to language, despite the fact Lacan tells us "the Real is absolutely without fissure," as the real is not simply of the world, but is only grasped through language (Lacan 1988b, 97; Ragland, 195-196). The paradoxical formulation of the real, as a something that cannot be (re) presented, while serving as the means by which unrepresentability is embedded within representability, allows theorists such as Zizek to extrapolate its ambiguous quality to the workings of daily life: it is both supportive of the symbolic order and threatening to that order (because of the fact it cannot be assimilated by it), both senseless and yet contingent actuality (Zizek 1991, 1-47). For this reason, Fink suggests the real is inevitably marked as trauma for the subject in both every day existence (and analysis) 19</page><page sequence="6">and Zizek draws attention to the fact that artistic representation (considered in the broadest sense) often dwells on the return of the real as trauma and catastrophe (Fink 1995, 26-28; Zizek 1991, 21-38). In analysis then, the real is marked by a sense of what cannot be expressed (but without which there could be no expressive communication). It is clearly felt to be there by the subject (analyst/analysand) as an "unenviable situation" to use Beckett's terms. "The Lacanian real [...] makes the analysand come back to the same subject, event, or notion over and over, revolve around it endlessly" (Fink 1997, 48). This endless revolution sounds uncannily like the constitutive structure of Beckett's repetitive arguments in Three Dialogues regarding the artists "predicament" (as well as the structure of a later play such as Footfalls). From the above discussion, it should be clear that my argument is that the possibility of establishing a psychoanalytic context for the Three Dialogues depends upon the premise that its performative allusions to psychoanalytic therapy are not coincidental, but rather a marker of the fact that the embedding of unrepresentability in representation is a common and central problem for both the practising artist and the analyst. I want now to explore how far Beckett's understanding of this problem can be paralleled to that of Lacan's problematic of the real by returning to the Three Dialogues. It would appear to be important that throughout the discussion of aesthetics is always focused within the general area of the expressive, to the exclusion of other possibilities. There is no significant interest shown in either formalist or reception based theories of art (to name of the two most traditional and customary alternatives) and no discussion of individual art objects (and certainly no accompanying illustrative material which would make it easier to follow Beckett's arguments). Nor is the text concerned with what art might mean to an audience as opposed to those who create it In fact, the emphasis is repeatedly on the artist as the one who must express 'reality', which in this sense is not any specific object in the world but the totality of that reality. To restate this in psychoanalytic terms, the text foregrounds subjectivity as the necessary location for any exploration of what it means for the subject to represent reality. Three Dialogues begins in an elliptical way, which makes it unclear, at first, as to whether B. is referring to the art object or the objects that are being represented by that art. "B. - Total object, complete with missing parts, instead of partial object. 20</page><page sequence="7">Question of degree" (25). In the subsequent exchange between D. and B. we quickly realise that the object in question is what we might refer to as the world or reality. D. refers to "the world a flux of movements partaking of living time," while B. quickly puts the discussions on the course they will take in the rest of the dialogue. "B. - In any case a thrusting towards a more adequate expression of natural experience, as revealed to the vigilant coenaesthesia" (25). Coenaesthesis is a nineteenth-century psychological term meaning: "the general sense of experience arising from the sum of bodily impressions, the vital sense" (OED). The choice of an unusual term derived from psychology suggests that while the dialogue is centrally concerned with aesthetics, there is from the start a psychological dimension. It is telling that throughout Three Dialogues the material from artists that is submitted is not actually their work or even how they have been received within art history, but rather their views (or more often their implied views) on what they are doing or should be doing as artists. "What we have to consider in the case of Italian painters is not that they surveyed the world with the eyes of building contractors, a mere means like any other, but that they never stirred from the field of the possible, however much they may have enlarged it" (26). This focus on the expressive might be construed as an emphasis on the place of the subject in representation (in Lacanian terms, the barred subject in the symbolic order). The symbolic is where the barred subject is located within culture and language, but is also the fabric of conscious and unconscious representations made conscious, the realm of signifiers. While the subject is never a full or discrete ego in Lacanian theory (it is 'barred', 'split', 'sous erasure', 'fading' and so on), it cannot be dispensed with entirely. Lacan's emphasis is less on a dispersal of the subject, than a radical exploration of subjectivity as linguistic process. In fact, to do without the subject is to do without psychoanalysis as a therapeutic practice. Beckett's emphasis on the centrality of expression within aesthetics is therefore consistent with psychoanalytic thinking regarding representation. Towards the end of the first dialogue, B. conjoins his interest in an expressive aesthetics with what D. refers to as "a violently extreme and personal point of view" (26). At this point B. refers to what will be the major theme of the text: "the expression that there is nothing to express, nothing with which to express, nothing from which to express, no desire to 21</page><page sequence="8">express, together with the obligation to express" (26). Here B. seems to be paradoxically challenging an expressive aesthetic view, while wishing to remain within the terms of the argument. This is not so much a critique of or dialectical challenge to theories of expression, as a 'deconstructive' gesture, insofar as Beckett attempts to disturb the fundamental paradigm of an expressive view of aesthetics without moving from within its set of assumptions. The series of negatives here would seem to be placing under 'erasure' the objects of expression, the means of expression, the subject which expresses and the conscious desire to express, while still maintaining that the subject must express and represent. In the same way the Lacanian real drives the fading subjects expression and makes the symbolic possible, while never being expressible in any direct, linguistically unmediated fashion: "The real, I will say, is the mystery both of the speaking body, the mystery of the unconscious" (Lacan 1998, 131). What unites Beckett's and Lacan's view of the presumed object of representation is that it is both literally ungraspable, but nonetheless the impulse that propels representation for the subject. Tal Coat in contrast seems to embody a belief that it is possible to apprehend the 'real' through greater striving for a "more adequate expression of natural experience," which would be to deny the fundamental alterity of the real (25). The second dialogue introduces a new term, the "void" and B. goes on to criticise the Surrealist painter Masson for both conceptualising and in effect describing the void. (It is surely no coincidence that Masson is given much more discussion than Tal Coat. Masson is a key figure in Surrealism, the form of art most determined to carry out a project derived from psychoanalysis. Masson famously experimented with an automatic picture making that paralleled 'automatic writing' in an attempt to allow the unconscious to become visible.5 Masson in 1934 married Rose Mackles, sister of Sylvia Mackles, who in turn married George Bataille and then Jacques Lacan). The void is clearly that which is unrepresentable, yet B. sees the painter's idea of it as "simply the obliteration of an unbearable presence, unbearable because neither to be wooed nor to be stormed" (27). It cannot be "wooed or stormed" (two terms that connote the dynamism of desire, as if the void were female), because as Zizek notes it is "just a void, an emptiness in a symbolic structure." This is to say, that Masson 22</page><page sequence="9">cannot accept the impossibility of inscription that is the real, but tries to represent the void as a simple emptiness that can be opposed to the presence of the symbolic (hence its paradoxical construction by B. in terms of sexual difference). Yet as Lacan reminds us, "there is no absence in the real" (Lacan 1988b, 313). "The Real is the fullness of the inert presence, positivity; nothing is lacking in the Real [...] at the same time the Real is in itself a hole, a gap, an opening in the middle of the symbolic order - it is the lack around which the symbolic order is structured" (Zizek 1989,170). What is at stake are two different notions of 'void': Masson (according to B.) sees it as representable as an absence, while for B. it is like a hollow of infinite depth in the structure of representation itself, deconstructing the opposition of absence and presence.6 Hence B. remarks that Masson's void is "hardly to be confused with the void" and suggests that Masson apprehends the void as a somewhat vacuous and anthropomorphic version of Nirvana, pursued in the traditional terms of a masculine subject and a distinctly feminine object (27). B. chooses trivialising and ironic descriptive terms that maintain the allusion to a gendered romance: "this anguish of helplessness is never stated as such, on its own merits [...] very occasionally admitted as spice to the 'exploit' it jeopardised" (27). Most striking of all the criticisms is B.'s apparent condemnation of Masson's lack of anguish, his concern "with the amenities of ease and freedom" (28). D.'s comments tend to bear out what B. says; he describes Masson as wishing to "frolic" and to aid "what is tolerable and radiant in the world to continue" (27-28). In fact, this is such a cosy picture of the struggle to depict the void; it is not completely unsurprising that B. chooses to exit weeping on page 29. B. seems to be implying throughout the dialogue that Masson's 'struggle' to rehabilitate the vaporous void is a kind of romantic, heroic fantasy (and of course thus traditional and part of general Surrealist dynamics).7 It is as if Masson (in Lacanian terms) has mistaken the imaginary for the space that is the real, leading to the fantasy of a captivating vision of a return to the early Oedipal situation. In contrast, B. appears to imply that suffering is the preferred condition for the artist. For Lacan, jouissance is experienced as suffering by the subject (though as an ultimate pleasure by the unconscious), because it is orientated towards the real and the transgression of the symbolic (Lacan 1992, 191-204, 231-240). 23</page><page sequence="10">In the third of the dialogues B. invokes van Velde as much closer to 'the pre dicament' of the radical failure of the expressive relationship that Tal Coat and Mas son fail to embody. For Beckett what seems to be the crux of the problem is that this new, more thorough kind of submission to a recognition of failure, may in turn become a kind of stable aporia, rather than a (repeatedly) failed enactment. An art recuperated as expressive of the impossibility to express (in B.'s terms), maintains the expressive relation and thus could be a form of existential mastery in the face of failure. It is probably for this reason that the term "void" gives way to the more colourless term "nothing" and B. tells us there is "nothing to paint and nothing to paint with" (29). The importance of "obligation" and the ethical desire to paint would seem less any articula tion of the conscious subject, than bound in with a 'fading' subject which is itself a fragment of the real. Bersani and Dutoit, for example, see this as the beginning of some form of ethical imperative and argue that Beckett's determination to fail can be seen as a kind of renunciation of authority, which liberates us insofar as we attend to the "somewhat incomprehensible passage from the masochistic jouissance of self enclosure to the fictional confusion of the T and 'non-I'" (91). However, while this requires a contextualisation with Beckett's other texts, there is indeed a comment on the problem of ethics in the text. B. remarks: "The stars are undoubtedly superb, as Freud remarked on reading Kant's cosmological proof of the existence of God" (28). This is ironic, since the rest of the sentence from the New Introductory Lectures in Psychoanalysis that B. omits, suggests that Freud views Kant as correct as to the mag nificence of the cosmos, but woefully optimistic to suggest that God had equal success with the distribution of conscience (Freud, 93).8 B. therefore implies that Masson's art is an ethical failure, because whatever the merits of its sublime beauty, it fails to investigate the ethical position of the artist as part of the conditions of its own possibility. Why then is artistic failure linked to eth ics? Freud is actually discussing the failure of the superego and as Lacan argues the superego is at best an ambivalent structure, at once the figure of the law that is pre venting psychic disintegration and "pure imperativeness and simple tyranny" (Lacan 1998a, 102). Although I am not suggesting that Beckett is advocating either endorse ment or hostility to the superego, what seems clear is an avocation of the need to think 24</page><page sequence="11">through the relationship between representation, the real and the symbolic in the con text of the responsibility of the artist. Beckett then, is suggesting the need for a radi cally less secure relationship to the real, as a pre-condition for artistic exploration. Both Three Dialogues and the work of psychoanalysis share an interest in the force of the unrepresentability of the real that inhabits their representational structures and both view symbolisation as most authentic when it recognises it must intrinsically fail - as that failure is constitutive of the subject and their relationship to the world. Insofar as both psychoanalysis and Three Dialogues are theoretical texts, their problem is how to resist their own recuperative signifying practices, as these inevitably suture the gap between the real and the symbolic. The paradoxical arguments, cryptic allusions and embrace of aporia in Three Dialogues register the extent of the problem, as do the re peated attempts of the text to perform its own failure and fragmentation. If as D. sug gest, the number was to have two parts, then where and what is the second?: D. -1 understood your number was to have two parts. The first was to consist in your saying what you - er - thought. This I am prepared to believe you have done. The second - B. - (Remembering, warmly) Yes, yes, I am mistaken, I am mistaken. (32) Perhaps, it is not pure speculation to read Beckett's refusal to continue with his quasi-critical work much after Three Dialogues itself, as representing just such an un derstanding of the problems involved in articulating unrepresentability. Beckett wrote to Duthuit in 1949, "I can no longer write in a coherent manner about Bram or about anything whatsoever. I can no longer write about" (Oppenheim, 120). This is not to say, of course, that Beckett's future work lacks a theoretical dimension, but instead that fiction, drama and poetry are far less likely to run the risk of collapsing real and symbolic and becoming the space for fantasy. Creative works can sustain and enable performative enactments of failures to represent the real, that are in the final analysis the only possible ways of facing up to it and rediscovering the value in the unrepre sentable. 25</page><page sequence="12">Notes 1. See Oppenheim, 13- 62 for a discussion of this critical tradition. 2. Andre Masson and Tal Coat in particular, went through a number of major stylistic changes in their careers as artists. Beckett produces nothing concrete to locate the period of their work that is under discussion. 3. For useful overviews of the relationship between psychoanalysis and drama / performance, see Wright, 1996, and Campbell and Kear, 2001. 4. All uses of 'real', Real or real refer to the Lacanian term in this article. 5. It is tempting to see Beckett, in the second dialogue, as implicitly criticising a kind of surreal ism that mistakes the depiction of the unconscious for that of the real. Andre Masson's earlier work in automatic drawing and biomorphic abstraction could perhaps be argued to fall into this category, but this would be less true of his later work contemporaneous with the Three Dialogues. For a useful discussion of psychoanalysis and surrealism, see Lomas 2001; Masson is discussed on pages 26-52 of same. 6. WorstwardHo suggests: "Say a grot in that void. A gulf (Beckett 1999, 16). 7.
