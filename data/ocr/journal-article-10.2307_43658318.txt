<plain_text><page sequence="1">RURAL DEVELOPMENT: CONCEPTS, ISSUES AND METHODOLOGY- THE UGANDA EXPERIENCE JAMES KATOROBO, University of Botswana, Lestho and Swaziland. A. The Aims of Rural Development Research in Uganda. Rural development study in Uganda is underdeveloped. If it were deve- loped, there would be an accumulation of concepts, classificatory and typological categories, and a variety of generalizations, hypotheses and law- like statements1 about the rural development problems and their possible solutions. The aim of rural development research should be the accumulation of this knowledge and the promotion of understanding. There is accumulated knowledge of Uganda rural society from the perspective of colonial anthropology. Its aim was the promotion of know- ledge and understanding of the culture of traditional society with the objective of maintaining peace and stability and extracting labour and commodities. Colonial anthropology was concerned wi h identifying the functions of struc- tures such as rituals, customs, religion and politics in the maintenance of social order and stability.2 In state systems it was found to be maintained by a hierarchy of chiefs.* It was essential to the stability of colonialism to discover and promote patterns of "adaptation" of traditional political systems to the colonial administrative service and to identify and reduce role conflict and cross pressures on traditional chiefs.4 In stateless systems colonial anthropology discovered "ordered anarchy5 and related it to system stability of both traditional and colonial society. Colonial economic anthropology accumulated information about the nature of labour« and internal migration and the condition for adoption and acceptance of "economic" (or cash) crops. The economics of colonial exploi- tation concerned designation of areas of Uganda as sources of agricultural export commodities for metropolitan capital goods and consumer industries and the designation of certain other areas as labour reserve areas.1 Colonial administrative policies were concerned with encouraging the flow of labour from, discouraging of commodity production in, labour reserve areas and with incouraging of commodity production in export commodity production areas. Colonial economic anthropolgy helped rationalize and legitimize these policies. With independence there has been a shift in policy. All internal regions of the country are expected to develop productive capacity. No region is</page><page sequence="2">JAMES KATOROBO 230 regarded as monopolizing the right to develop industries; and no region is obliged to be the source of labour. There has been, and ought to be, a shift from the emphasis on colonial cash crop production, to the production of crops for mainly the domestic market and, then finally, the world market. There is no reason why the west should turn to algae, which should remain the preserve of fish, and synthetic proteins from leaves, if our rural areas can be turned into rich graneries. Colonial economic anthropology should provide useful information on issues of labour and commodity production but it is necessary to process this information in order to remove interprita- tions and attitudes that were favourable to colonialism and detrimental to the welfare of our countries. Much of the information may be irrelevant to our current practical concerns. Much is about cotton and coffee produc- tion. But these are senescent rural industries undergoing contraction. Irrespec- tive of co'.ton and coffee production rural Uganda has remained under- developed. Our current practical concern should be to identify rural projects which when implemented would lead to a prosperous and vigorous rural environment. Whether rural peoples are lazy8 and improvident® is a very important question for rural development. But much of the claims of colonial economic anthropology about the lazy and improvident peasant were pro- jections of class and racial biases and prejudices. Colonial economic anthropology was linked to colonial political anthro- pology. Accumulated information derived from colonial political anthro- pology is as irrelevant, and presumably more irrelevant, as information about mechanisms of order and stability in traditional society and increased the power of colonialism to manipulate the political life of these societies. Having used force to establish the empire colonial authorities needed information about cheaper me hods of regulation and control. Here again the connection between political rural studies and the economics of rural development needs to be redefined and formulated such that rural peoples are given a chance to participate in a politics which will promote their economic welfare. It would be sad if independent African govern- ments were to maintain a pattern of exploitation, control and regulation of rural society under terms wholly determined by central governments; remi- niscene of classical colonialism Neo-colonia! ist accumulation oj information about rural society. Since independence the study of rural Uganda has been dominated by foreign aid research activity. The studies by the anthropologists during the colonial period have been replaced by the domination of rural research activity by foreign aid. The content of this research has shifted from the specifically political to the specifically economic even if the scholar may not be an economist. As a result there is growing body of information on</page><page sequence="3">231 RURAL DEVELOPMENT problems of rural economic development except that the accumulation is taking place in the metropoles of the ex-colonialist states. The choice of concepts, hypothesis and generalizations for such research depends on the predilections of visiting scholars and may not be in the "best" interest of rural society. If there is vigorous domestic research activity, then such foreign research is welcome and adds variety to domestic sources of information. Neo-colonial biases and prejudices of visiting scholars are then in com- petition with nationalistic biases and prejudices. But if domestic research capacity is low, such foreign aid research activity may distort and prevent the emergence of independent domestic scholarship. Under this condition, there is little innovation and invention of concepts, models, and classifications and research »activity comes to be dominated by the testing and validation of ill-adapted imported concepts, models, and classifications. The visiting researchers leave with expertise and data, and leave behind poorly analyzed and superficial information. There emerges the phenomenon of a neo- colonialist research relationship leading to unequal and lope-sided accumu- lation of information and understanding between the ex-colonist countries and the underdeveloped countries10 The underdeveloped world comes to depend more and more, at a price, on ex-colonial countries for information and understanding of its own conditions of underdevelopment. Research comes to promote the condition it was supposed to combat. Political independence has been accompanied by the mushrooming and proliferation of rural development project. These projects are inadequately provided with man-power, money, and technological resources. These resources limitations are worsened by blunders and mistakes of purpose and leader- ship. Such blunders and failures are exposed (o the vigilant eyes of the visiting scholars who tend to describe11 them with sadistic relish or pater- nalistic sympathy. This tends to alienate development actors and reduces the observability of the rural development process. Partly in order to counter criticism and partly on their own initiatives, governments are engaged in their own research activity that errors in the opposite direction when it reports 100% success s'.ories of agricultural, co-operalives, and animals husbandry, schemes. Sharp critical analysis of the activities of rural deve- lopment agents are likely to provide the justifications for research restric- tions on the part of officials. It is important for research to be critical and for officials to protect government secrets, but these needs are mostly abused by bo h sides. If the end state of rural development in Uganda is agrarian capitalism, then in theory it is assumed that government will be least involved in the process, that resources will be freely allocated by Adan Smith's invisible hand according to the laws of supply and demand. The influence of research on the development process is also left to chance. The aims of research are defined as objective description and analysis of the development process.</page><page sequence="4">JAMES KATOROBO 232 Because research is defined as the neutral portrayal of an objective reality, and if the objective reality is an existing class society, the research process becomes a description and explanation of the fortunes and misfortunes of a capitalistic class, its access to education, technology, money and resources essential for the accumulation of capital. Within the ranks of scholarship, and enjoying precarious existence at the periphery of pro-establishment academic, emerges radical scholars who define their research goals as the exposure of what they regard as the myth of free enterprise.12 To them rural capitalistic development depends on active involvement of a government controlled by a capitalistic class, which monopolizes the power to extract surplus labour from the rest of society and allocated it to itself. Under these conditions rural development research of the "neutral" and "objective" variety becomes an apology for capitalism and radical critical analysis an exercise in subversion. Communist rural development in Uganda would entail the public ownership of land and the persuit of coUectivised agricultural production. Rural productive resources would be owned publically and their alloca- tion done by governmental organs. It is unlikely that such transformation could be achieved peacefully. The history of this form of development is charac- terized by force and revolutionary activity. The role of scholarship is defined in terms of the defence of the revolution. The ideal prescription for the role of scholarship shifts from the norm of "neutrality" and "objec- tivity" to that of active involvement. Just as in the case of capitalistic development, scholarship is an instrument of legitimating the status quo. Those who are sympathetic to capitalist ideas live precariously at the periphery of official communist academia.13 The most relevant rural deve- lopment research would accumulate information on the selecting and conso- lidation of collective farms, on patterns of recruitment and deployment of manpower, on the proper utilization and distribution of economic surplus, and on the relationship between the communist ideology and rural develop- ment activities. Rural development in Uganda is likely to combine elements from both capitalistic and communistic modes of development, the mixed economy. It should combine the best in Soviet and Chinese communism with the best in American capitalism. It should avoid the worst in American capitalism and the worst in Soviet and Chinese coccunism. It should strike a balance between agrarian capitalism and collectivization. Half of our industries should be privately owned and the other half publically owned; half of housing industry should be privately owned and the other half publically owned, and half of the land should be publically owned and devoted to collective forms of production and the other half should be privately owned. Pure capitalism tends to lead to a neglect of, and the underdevelopment of, "public goods", pure communism promotes collective instincts at the expense</page><page sequence="5">233 RURAL DEVELOPMENT of individualism. Public goods tend to be misused and wasted by individuals if there is no one accountable and responsible. Capitalism promotes indivi- dual responsibility, but only in matters of self interest. The mixed economies principle as a basis of rural development in Uganda takes the form of capitalistic peasant agricultural production and collective marketing of farm produce and large scale privately owned com- mercial agriculture counter balanced by large scale plantations and farms controlled by government. Government control as much tea growing and processing as is controlled by privately owned tea out-grower schemes. In the Bushenyi area there are two tea processing factories one owned by government, the other owned by private tea growers. In urban areas the government controls as much housing as private land-lords. Although world conflicts are seen in terms of the competition between capitalism and communism, the mixed type of economic and polifical system offers a higher order system because it is a synthesis and crystalization of the most important firms of social organiza- tion. The existence of rival philosophical systems leads to competition for excellency; whereas monolithic value systems tend to become dogmatic, stifling and incapable of self-renewal and regeneration. But the mixed economy requires of leaders, whether capitalist or communist, to maintain the basic dualist nature of the society. The mixed economies model of rural development provides a research atmosphere in which government sponsored research is carried out along- side privately sponsored research; in which there is a balance between collective research and individual, between pure and applied; and between scholars who believe in "objectivity" and those who believe in active involve- ment with the government. In terms of foreign aid research for rural development we have Russians introducing agricultural mechanization;14 we have Chinese introducing large scale rice cultivation15 and we have Americans involved in agricultural saturation projects.18 Not only does this combination provide for variety in rural production, but it is accompanied by differences of concepts, models, and methodologies. The Americans are likely to help accumulate information on the role of education and credit in rural development; the Chinese are likely to help us accumulate knowledge about the role of labour and irrigation in rural development and, finally, the Russians are helping us to accumulate information about the role of technology i.e. mechanization, in rural modernization. But rural development studies should seek to identify the unifying elements and general characteristics of these varieties and diversities of rural experiences. B. The Stages of Growth of a Science of Rural Development in Uganda The early stage of science is characterized by classification of the phenomena under study and the final stage is the accumulation of knowledge</page><page sequence="6">JAMES KATOROBO 234 and its storage in concepts, models and theories.17 Classification and theory are the ends of a continuam indicating the graded, or hierarchic, output of information from research activity. Since the movement to theory is not equifinal, the early stages are as important as the last stages; classi- fication is as important as hypothesis testing since the former makes the later possible. In this section I want to discuss the place of classification, concepts, models and theories in the s'.udy of rural development in Uganda and I shall present examples of classification, concepts and the theory in order to give meaning to these terms. My objective is to suggest an opera- tional code for rural research rather than give substantive results about rural development in Uganda. What substantive content I give to the classifications depends on my considerable participant experience of Uganda rural condi- tions. Thus the concepts and theories that I am presenting are not without emperical significance. But the objectives of this analysis are to raise funda- mental issues of methodology. The initial stage in the accumulation and organization of information about rural development in Uganda is the classification of the social pheno- mena under study. I use the terms classifications, typology and taxonomy interchangeably. This process involves the ideosyncratic naming of the objects of study, the grouping into categories in such a way that members of each category share a common property and such that membership in categories, is mutually exclusive. This is the ideal standard but many classifications may be acceptable if they meet half way these ideal standards. Nominal classi- fications may be distinguished from analytic classifications. Nominal classi- fications merely give a name to a unit or to a group of units and allow us to identify objects without error. Nominal classifications may communicate meaning about essential properties of the object named but this is not their purpose. Analytic classifications are mainly intended to communicate mean- ing about the properties and the behavious of members of the classifications in question. A classification is by definition a measurement of comparison although these are qualitative measurements.18 Rural development in Uganda has been, and should be, classified according to ethnic, and ecological, zones, and development projects. The study of rural Uganda society has tended to be dominated by the classification according to ethnic groupings and by linguistic categories. The rural peoples of Uganda can be fitted into about 40 ethnic groups and about 4 linguisic groups. Each of these classifications satisfies the rule about mutual exclusive categories. While this classification is useful for the study of politics and culture, it may not be directly relevant to the study of rural economic development. This suggests ano.her criteria in the construction of a typology of rural development. The units of the typology variables, the property in terms of which membership in the typology varies, must be related to variations in other development factors. Unless ethnic and language</page><page sequence="7">235 RURAL DEVELOPMENT differences are related to economic development, typologies based on ethnicity and language are not likely to be explana' ory of other economic development variables, expecting the case of spurious correlation. Two instances may be sited when ethnicity may be correleted with economic performance; when ethnic differences are associated with differences of in'esity of drive and achievement motivation,19 and when ethnic status differences are associated with pariah entrepreneurship.20 Even if these differences may by associated with economic development, attempts should be made to destroy bases of inequality in the process of promoting deve- lopment in rural Uganda. Economic specialization tends to follow geographical regions, so that a classification of types of economic activities is likely to be correlated with a classification according to ecological zones. This is contrary to the case of classification according to ethnicity where we may expect, a priori, indepen- dence from a classification according to types of economic activity. One of the key methodological problem of an ecological classification, or of those classifications for which we can expect, a priori, correlation with other variables, is that it is likely to violate the principle that the members of a class, or category, should share the same propery, or be inclusive. The problem is likely to be that membership in the class can be determined on the basis of many other variables. Membership in the same ecosystem is likely to reflect same geographical property, same economic activity, same ethnic properly, same cultural specialization and same language. It then becomes impossible to distinguish causal chains in the system.21 In the construction of typologies of ecosystems we may classify according to whether the land is arable or not arable, and further subdivide these into different land use modes. A. Arable I. Wet forest Agriculture, forestry, etc. B. Non Arable II. Wet grasslands Agriculture or Dairy farming I. Wet forest Forestry II. Dry grassland Wildlife and Tourism III. Urban areas Manufacturing Rural development can be defined in terms of the typology of ecosys'ems as the promotion of desirable and consistent changes in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and wildlife, and urbanization and industrialization. But •it is clear that the above classification does not satisfy the condition of mutual exclusive membership. It is also suggestive of the diversity of rural types and of a diversity of different activities that are subsumed under the idea of rural development at the level of the macro system. In terms of the</page><page sequence="8">JAMES KATOROBO 236 ecosystems defined above, it may be stated that rural development is incon- ceivable without increasing industrialization and urbanization. Rural deve- lopment involves multiple and concurrent changes in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, wildlife management and industrialization. As these events occur, it is the aim of rural development research to record them, analyse them and predict them, and to "feedback" this information to the actors involved in rural development events. The typology of ecosystems developed above may be compared to typologies based on regions or previous or districts. A typology of Uganda rural environmetnt according to these administrative units would show con- siderable overlap with that of the ecosystems because administrative bound- aries tended to follow ethnic settlement and ethnic settlement tended to follow ecosystems. The difference between Ankole and Kigezi is administrative, as well as geographical, and ethnic, cultural, and occupational. A different basis of classification of Uganda rural activities is type of development project. When I think about rural development in Buganda, or Ankole, or Busoga, or Kigezi, specific development projects come to mind: vegetable growing scheme, tea outgrower scheme, credit scheme, tractor hire service, mechanization project, a milk processing plant, a ranch scheme. Wherever a project is located in the rural areas it attracts specialized man-power, modern facilities of housing, health, and transpor- tation. In order to produce a service or "good", it exchanges its production surplus for raw materials from the environment. Project implementation activities represent zones of intense modernization compared to non-project areas and in the geography of modernization,22 techniques of its measure- ment and mapping are being developed. He who studies specific develop- ment projects knows what needs to be known about rural development in general. Therefore the project should be the focus of rural development research and hence the basis for constructing classifications. A model is defined as a miniature representation of an object. Most familiar models are themselves objects. In this section I am interested in the same kind of model but one that takes a verbal form. Instead of objects, it represents processes and instead of being an object itself, it is a set of statements. Rural development entails very many variables interacting with each other.. So many as to defy actual and exact description. It may how- ever be possible simulate the essential conditions of the development process from the behaviour of a few variables. It is in this sense that it is a miniature representation. Thus modeling involves the selection and reduc- tion of variables of a complex process to a small number; but, not too few to distort the nature of the process. Initially study will depend on rules of the thumb and on trial and error until the research process has accumulated experience either in the researcher or in analogous models I am proposing an integrated model of rural development in Uganda</page><page sequence="9">237 RURAL DEVELOPMENT in which is specified the minimum number of variables involved in the rural development process. It consists of eleven causes, or indecators of development or underdevelopment. It is integrated in the sense that deve- lopment requires changes in all, or a majority, of them. Thus it can be used as an analytic index in the measurement of underdevelopment and development. It can also be used as an integrated package of rural develop- ment policy. Technology. Rural underdevelopment is associated with poor utilization of technology. By increasing the use of specific technologies, and types of technology, rural modernization will take several leaps forward. Although there are a few tractors being used in agriculture, the predominant techno- logical mode is the hoe; although there are a few saw mills, the predominant technology for hoeing trees is the "Jembe" or the axe; although there are milk machines, the predominant technological mode is handmilking. New and modern technology has already entered the rural areas; but its spread, scope and impact are limited. Much of it is in appropriate because (i) it is not preceeded by testing and coasting (ii) the decision to introduce it does not reflect the interest of users but that of the import and export agents and manufacturers (iii) because developing areas are being used as dumping ground for obsolescent technology and excess production capacity.28 Indeed what has limited the diffusion of technology is the predominance of the peasant mode of ownership of land, of its utilization and low levels of education and purchasing capacity. Organizational capacity. High levels of rural modernization can be achieved by increasing the scope of organization. Organizations are capable of mobilizing labour for the construction of better housing, better roads, and better utilization of in-puts into rural production activities. The Chinese have successfully used human labour to modernize in the absence of heavy capital and technology. Considerable progress in the rural areas of Uganda could be achieved by mobilization of communal peasant power. But it requires organization skills. Poor organization is also responsible for the mismanagement of development projects and the ineffectiveness of govern- ment departments. Thus low organization capacity is responsible for the misuse of scarse technology and credit resources.24 Credit resources. If technologies are developed, they cost money; if organization structures are set up, they cost money to run and maintain. Expansion of technological and organizational in-put into rural Uganda life implies expansion of credit among the rural population. Thus the increase in the supply of credit capital to rural Ugandans, the increase in their earning capacity and the increase in their capacity to borrow money, must be provided for in any scheme of rural development. Rural deve- lopment will be associated with the spread of banks into the rural areas, which will increase the supply and circulation of money in the rural areas!</page><page sequence="10">JAMES KATOROBO 238 Villagers, as clients, will transform the elitistic character of the Uganda Banking system and the village bank branches will change peasant habits and attitudes about storage and use of money. Only with spread of rural credit institutions will be emergence of exploitative forms of money lending be prevented.25 Mobility of peoples and resowces. Rural development is associated with mobility of people and resources. The mobility of people depends on urbani- zaron and industrialization. As urbanization and industrialization increase in the city, they draw peoples and resources from the rural areas of Uganda. This transfer of resources will be beneficial to the village if it is an exchange of village excess capacity in men and materials for city produced resources needed in the village for consumption and production. Since less than 10% of the rural population could adequa' ely organize and produce rural output, there is considerable rural excess capacity in men who could be given up to the city. Apart from this movement of men and resources, mobility includes fhe instrumentalities of movement. There is considerable scope for increasing the movement of rural peoples by introduction of horses, by increasing the supply of bicycles, by increases in all existing types of roads, by expansion of, and development of an internal network of railway tracks. Only by increasing transportation and mobility can we resolve the contradiction of people starving for lack of food in cities and towns when food goes to waste in remote villages. Inflation. Any realistic model of rural development in East Africa must take into account the problem of inflation. Inflation leads to a siua- tion in which there is price instability, prices of goods and services keep going up and up. Inflation is caused by scarcity of goods and by consider- able increase in money supply in relation to the available goods. If (he cost of living were inflationary for everyone, then most people would be equally affected. But inflation hits hard those sectors of the economy not in a position to engage in price increases. Fixed income corners are hit hard by infla'ion. Because of inflation and shortage of good and services, more is allo- cated to the city than the rural areas. The goods and services needed by rural production increase in cost at exceptionally greater rates than the cost of rural products can be increased. Under inflationary conditions and scarcity of goods, the service sectors are likely to respond to these demands than the rural society, which is exposed to exploitation under these conditions. Thus -any model of rural developeiment must make allowance for the control of inflation. What are the conditions under which rural commodi- ties could increase in price so as to negate inflationary costs of industrial goods and services "imported" into the rural areas of Uganda. Decision-making and implementation capacity. Considerable rural under-</page><page sequence="11">239 RURAL DEVELOPMENT development is caused by poor political leadership.28 If the making of deci- sion is poor then appropriate projects will not be started in rural society. If the implementation of policies is poor, then very many rural projects which are started will not be completed. The making and implementation of policies is likely to be poor if leadership capacity and selection are poor. Political freedom and liberty in the rural areas of Uganda is an essential condition for the improvement of the making of political decision and their imple- mentation. If the quality of leadership is poor, then the rural areas will be underdeveloped. If leaders make blunders and mistakes at the local as well as national levels then the society is plunged into misery. Development is incon- ceivable under these conditions; instead, decay and retrogression will be set in motion. Malnutrition. One of the key characteristics of low class and poor peoples is malnutrition.27 If our rural people are plagued by diseases and eat and live poorly, then these conditions will be correlated with poor energy and low capacity to work. Wiping out diseases and poor conditions of living in rural Uganda is a humanitarian goal in its own right, but even if this was not so, any attempt at rural development in the economic sense without dealing with rural diseases, poor food and housing is waste of time. Land use and tenure. One of the aspects of Uganda land use and tenure is the turnover of land ownership. The higher the turnover, the greater the chances that land will change hands. The lower the turnover the greater the control of the elder generation of land use and the lower the influence of the younger generation on land use. Similarly, the higher the turnover, the greater the chances of rationalizing farm management and farm production by land consolidation and mechanization. Urbanization and Industrialization. Current processing industries of rural resources located in the city ought to be relocated and sited in the rural areas. The tea processing areas of Ankole, Kigezi, Toro should proccss the tea short of blending, and export directly to the domestic and foreign markets. Similarly grain milling, coffee manufacture, should be located in the rural areas as well as diary and beef processing industries. Correspond- ingly, the city should embark on heavy industrialization of most of the goods now imported from developed countries. Industrialization in the city and urbanization are essential elements in a model of rural transformation. It is inconceivable that much modernization can take place in the rural sector without greater industrialization and urbanization in the city. Education. Development is associated closely with increases in educa- tion.28 Education increases the intellectual horizon of the peasant and diminishes the grip of mythology, custom and prejudices. As more anď more information become available to the rural peoples, it gets reflected in their responses to the environment. As the general education of the masses is raised, they become accessible to mass media communication and ideas</page><page sequence="12">JAMES KATOROBO 240 about new innovations. Improvements in level of, and quality of, education will vary closely with improvements in other areas of rural life in Uganda. Marketing. Development is associated with an increase in the number and quality of markets for buying and selling commodities and services as long as these are not instruments of exploitation. As has been stated rural development requires simultaneous changes in all or most of the elements of this integrated29 model. It can also be used as check list for the level of rural development so far attained by regarding its elementary units as indicators of change. It should be used together with the classification of ecosystems. This integrated model can be used as a measure of underdevelopment in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, wildlife management and the manufacturing sector. It contains the common problems faced by all the sectors of the economy. But this integrated model has its own limitations, The stated uses and functions are ideals for the kind of models we wish to construct. The particular model constructed here contains eleven dimensions each of which is a complex set of factors poorly researched and requiring accumulation of information. Thus we need information about the instrument to be used to find information. The next step beyond modeling is the construction of testable hypothesis. In this particular model it would be the translation of the eleven dimensions into eleven testable hypothesis assuming them to show integrated variations. But before this can be done we need detailed study of each of the dimensions. The presentation of models need not spell out all the component ele- ments. It is economic to coin a word, or concept, which when read leads to recall of all the elementary units that make up the model. Presumably the elements of the model are stored in memory as an associative network cap- able of being recalled given the concept. Is there a word which when used would be associated with the eleven dimensions of the integrated model? An example of a concept of this kind is Oscar Lewis' "culture of Poverty" which is associated with over forty traits oí lower class families in slum ecological systems.40 Other social science concepts with rich associative networks are "amoral familism'"1 informal sector," empathy,»» and the Marxist term surplus value.»4 To say that these concepts are rich in associations of meaning is the same as saying that they have high information storage capacity.»8 One of the central goals of rural development research should be the accumula- tion of classifications, models, and concepts of high information storage capacity. Hypotheses are statements of presumed relationships between variables. They must be stated in such a way that they can be subject to verification or proof. Thus when a researcher has worked his way through classification</page><page sequence="13">241 RURAL DEVELOPMENT of the phenomena of study, when he has concepts to represent variables, and when he has identified the important variables in the form of models, he is in a position to presume relations between the variables. These pre- supositions, or expectations are hypotheses about the phenomena being studied which if verified, or not, advance understanding of the phenomena. When hypotheses are repeatedly confirmed they gain the status of socio- logical laws and if several such laws or lawlike statements, share a common property, they are said to constitute a theory.** Thus hypotheses can be derived from classifications and concepts for initial testing or they may be derived from a theory for repeat testing. I have already advocated the view that the derivation of a theory of rural development in Uganda should originate from Ugfanda classifications and concepts if it is to be relevant to conditions of Uganda rural society. It is assumed that theories of development that have been constructed on the basis of experiences of other countries are likely to be irrelevant to the conditions of Uganda rural society. Nevertheless, and assuming that attempts are being made to construct a theory on the basis of Uganda condi- tions, a parallel attempt should be made to test hypotheses derived from imported theory. A researcher who has considerable experience in the condi- tions of rural life in Uganda is in a position to read an imported theory and to screen it of irrelevant material. Thus he can use his own presupposi- tions about rural development in Uganda to choose those hypotheses of an imported theory which seem to satisfy his assumptions. I will now state several hypotheses based on reading of the literature on development and which seem to me to be helpful in thinking about rural development in Uganda. Bureaucratization. The bureaucratic form of organization is the most effective and efficient measn of attaining rural Ugandan collective goals. This may take the form of public or private companies or both.®7 The Bureaucratization. Bureaucracy is the most ineffective form or organ- ization for the persuit of collective goals. Rural activities should be imple- mented by temporary teams of experts recruited on contracts depending on the schedule for the completion of the project. As soon as the task is over the organization disbands only to be reconstituted for another task else- where.38. Voluntary organization. The emergence of voluntary organizations and their spread in the rural areas of Uganda is an indicator of rural moderniza- tion. As the number of such associations increases, the rate of rural develop- ment will increase and the number of associations will increase even further." Communication. As rural communications increase in terms of more mass media, more roads, more railways, higher rates of internal migra'ion and mobility, there will be increases in rural production and equitable distri- bution or resources. As the productive capacity of the rural areas increases.</page><page sequence="14">JAMES KATOROBO 242 there will be greater capital resources with which increase mass media, roads, asserts that Obote should have not been offered leadership before his social within and outside Uganda.40 Authoritarianism and Innovativeness. Reduction of authoritarianism in the rural areas will be accompanied by increase in innovativeness which in turn will result in increased rural productive capacity.41 Status reversed and Deprivation. An increase in the number of indivi- duals who have experienced status reversal and deprivation will be asso- ciated with increasing innovativeness and this will be associated with an increase in productive capacity.42 Contradictions and uneven Development. Resource extraction and exploitation of the rural areas will increase the contradiction between the city and the rural areas as well as the contradiction between the rich and the poor in both the city and the rural areas. The contradiction is resolved by the rural areas and the poor getting liberated.4* Credit and Productive capacity. An increase in the supply of credit in the rural areas will increase the purchasing power of rural peoples to buy rural production in-puts which will increase rural productive capacity. Technology and productive capacity. An increase in the quality and quantity of technology will increase the productive capacity of Uganda rural society. InformtUion and productive capacity. An increase in the amount and quality of information among rural peoples (by education and research etc.) will be associated with an increase in rural productive capacity. Political participation and productive capacity. An increase in political participation among the rura) peoples will increase the probability of the goals set being the correct representation of the interests of rural peoples. This will increase the rate of goal attainment and reduce costs of production. Malnutrition and productive capacity. A reduction in rural diseases and malnutrition will increase the energy land happiness of rural peopfes and this will increase their productive capacity. Increased production capacity generates resources which can be used to reduce diseases and malnutrition even further. Religion and productive capacity. An increase in commitment to a moral ideal, resolution of transcendental anxiety by motives of incompar- able power and worldly success.44 will be associated with increase in rural productive capacity. THEORY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN UGANDA When hypotheses are repeatedly confirmed they yield statements which are incontrovertably true, or law-like. If A, then B is a statement which may be valued because it reveals truth about a process, or because it reveals a true course of action to get the process going. Thus we want true statements</page><page sequence="15">243 RURAL DEVELOPMENT of action to get the process going. Thus we want true statements about rural development in Uganda because such true statements enable us to understand the problems of rural development or because they enable us to use them as actions for bringing about development. Theory is a set of law-like statements which share a common property. As twenty or more hypotheses are verified repeatedly about rural develop- ment they gain the status of being laws. But such 20, or more, laws of rural development would share a common property namely being about rural development and may be referred to as a theory of rural development. Thus a theory is a set of concatenated law-like statements about a phenomenon.48 That a theory of rural development will help us to bring about deve- lopment is a utilitarian evaluation of theory. There are other reasons why scholars value theory. Theoretical statements tends to be parsimonious and aesthetically pleasing. We may value theory because it is a source of new hypotheses for testing. Theoretical statements are true because of verification. There are other equally useful ways of knowing such truths that depend on revelation. We leave the door open to these other ways. Our task is to know rural Uganda, not how. If we can learn something from extra-sensory perception, or from psychics, or from witch "doctors", then such information is welcome as long as it proves its utility in application. I will now review theoretical statement which my previous reading suggests to be interesting examples of the kind of statements we wish to generate about rural development in Uganda and I will freely restate them to make them relevant to Uganda conditions.

Law of Uneven Development .49 To the extent that rural society is the periphery of capitalist industrial Europe, and since contradictions are likely to be more intense at the periphery than at the centre, changes of the entire world capitalistic system are most likely to begin in the rural areas of capitalistic exploitation. The decay of empire starts at the edges and moves inwards to the centre. The Law of increasing power and diminising competence. 50 As the power of officials increases, their competence diminishes. As the power of bureaucracy is increased, its efficience is reduced. As political organizaron diminishes, bureaucratic power rises and bureaucratic efficiency goes down. The Law of contradiction ,15 Matter exists in the unity of opposites. But we tend to see only one side of the pair. Misperception and false conscious- ness make us see classlessness in Uganda villages. We see the labourer.</page><page sequence="16">JAMES KATOROBO 244 but not the bourgeoisie; we see the class of the exploited, but not the exploit- ing class. Finally we conclude that there is no class of labourers and no exploitation. The Law of development by quantitative changes into qualitative ones." Development takes place by gradual quantitative changes up to a threshhold when there occurs a sudden qualitative change to be followed by gradual quantitative changes until the final stage is reached when there are no further changes. Thus the change process is a contradictory combination of incrementalism and revolution; of apparent conservation ending in revo- lution and revolutions that appear to have changed nothing. The principle of positive negative entropy. The normal condition of closed systems is disorder, chaos, and randomness. Given high levels of order and organization, there is a tendency towards disorder and disorgani- zation. Io open systems the normal tendency is against disorder and dis- organization. In closed systems development occurs by predetermined con- ditions which lead to an equilibrium; in open systems, different combinations of starting conditions may lead to the same steady state, development is Equifinal." Theory is a set of law-like statements accumulated from the testing and verification of hypothesis suggested by concepts and classifications. Thus theory is a higher order statement compared to concepts and classi- fications. But since the derivation of theory depends on concepts and hypotheses we should not attribute primacy to theory over concepts and classifications. There is no basis, for such comparative attribution of supe- riority. There are some mathematicians who refuse to regard qualitative or nominal scalqs, as measurement and reserve this term for quantitative scales. Our discussion may now be summarised into an algorithmic" set of steps for moving from the unkown phenomena to theory. Uganda. Given imported theory, test hypotheses derived from it.

After every accumulation return to A for classification, or return to B for a testable imported theory. D. Specific Research Procedures for the Study of Rural Development in Uganda In this section I review standard research procedures or techniques which may be used to gather information about rural society in Uganda. I believe that these techniques are neutral and that it is the researcher who</page><page sequence="17">2-f5 RURAL DEVELOPMENT gives them cultural content. I do not believe that these procedures are not applicable to underdeveloped countries but that they should be used with caution. As they are applied to the underdeveloped world problems of the validity and reliability of findings will arise just as they arise in the study of the "developed" societies. But these problems do not justify the wide spread methodological dilettantism among scholars of developing societies. The caser against scientism is actually not very strong. There is no reason why a researcher cannot engage in free floating visionarism and imagination as well as being metho- dologically rigorous depending on the suitability of method to the object of study. If there is anything that is determining the methodology in use, it is 'the research ability of the scholar which is largely determined by training. The methods which a researcher finds workable are those in which he is trained, and those which are not suitable are those in which he is not trained. If I am right in this assessment, then rather than engaging in evalu- ations of various techniques, we should simply recommend that training in as many of the techniques of research which science has developed is essen- tial to breaking through the cloud of unknowing surrounding rural deve- lopment in Uganda. The emphasis would shift from a debate over appro- priate methods to the actual supply of researchers which is the more serious constraint. Even then, the following are my evaluation of several research techniques in the study of Uganda rural development. The case method . Instead of analyzing many rural areas of Uganda, identification of a typical Uganda village reduces the size of the unit to be analyzed and enables us to analyze the specific village in greater detail. Instead of spreading scarce resources of time and money over large areas of Uganda, we may achieve considerable savings by concentrating on a single case. If we were to make a mistake in choosing the typical village, then all is lost. Information derived from the case will be inappropriately and distortingly applied to the whole. When classification and typology making has been completed, or has reached an advanced stage, choice of a unit for study in the case method approach should be guided by the appropriate classification. Thus a case study of a cash growing village will form a valid basis for generalization to the rest of the rural areas of Uganda which grow cash crops; a case study of a wild life district will form, the basis of valid generalization for most wild life ecosystems of Uganda; and a case study of a tourist distinct will provide valid generalizations to the rest of the Uganda tourist ecosystems. Thus advance in one research technique increases the utility of related research techniques with which it can be combined in research design.</page><page sequence="18">JAMES KATOROBO 246 When many cases have been accumulated about rural conditions in Uganda it will be possible to extrapolate hypothesis and generalizations for testing. Here the objective would be to discover the scope of application, and intensity or strength of the generalization. The derivation of these generalizations can begin with classification of the cases into concepts of higher and higher order generalizations and the testing should be achieved by carefully designed survey research aimed at increasing the reliability and validity of the findings and results. Survey research . Given numerical complexity of research units beyond the case method approach, survey research techniques can be used to pick up general and patterned properties of a mass of objects. Carefully designed samples guided by fairly standardized rules can be used to discover the general facts, about the rural areas and the general attitudes of rural peoples. Using classification and cross-tabulation techniques we can describe and explain generalizations and relations of interest about Uganda rural development. The range of research obstacles to be confronted are no different as when it is used in rural society in the West. Whatever difficulties of random sampling, or of interviewing there may be, do not justify the wide- spread pattemalistic belief among western scholars that these techniques are not applicable in underdeveloped countries or that if they are applied the results are any less valid and reliable. Participant observation . In the study of rural Uganda there is scope for participant observation aimed at evolving a mutual relationship between the scholar and the rural peoples. The essential condition would be those in which a researcher designed a longitudinal study whose duration could enable him to implement a rural development project for which he would be the project manager. For example, the Rwampala hills of Ankole are suit- able for a tea outgrower scheme. A student of project management, or of agricultural innovations, could volunteer to organize and manage such a scheme which would take about 5 to 10 years to mature. The scholar would have accumulated longitudinal data about many hypothesis -about rural deve- lopment in Uganda. It is in such a project that the contradiction whereby researchers extract and exploit respondents as sources of information, with- out the respondents getting something in return directly, would be reduced. Experiment . Experimental research designs are generally regarded as most likely to lead to true statements. But the experimentation takes place in unnatural conditions. Experimentation takes place in controlled environ- ment; but the application of the findings takes place in uncontrolled conditions. Experimentation was the dominant rural research design encouraged by colonialism to s'udy the diffusion of crops in the rural areas. Thus the rural environment has a good infrastructure of experimental stations which can be used to gather information on rural development. But this infrastruc- ture ought to be liberated from the deadening control of bureaucracy.</page><page sequence="19">247 RURAL DEVELOPMENT Oral traditions. There is a lot of valuable information which does not enter the official record either because the officials do not know or because if they know they want to cover it up. Historians however are able to use oral tradition to fill up the records of history or to go beyond recorded history. Much of this information would be useful in the reconstruction of past developmental patterns. Such histories of past development experiments would throw light on current development policy. There are many rural development programmes which are a repetition of past efforts and yet these programmes are being undertaken without awareness of past effort, some of which ended in failure. Oral development history will provide) us with reasons for failure of these early attempts at rural development. Documentary Analysis. There are considerable facts about rural society recorded in files of administrative officers. Such information regards past development activities and current ones. There are facts about rural peoples: birth and death, and tax assessment data. There is valuable information about weather and climate events. Again as in the use of oral traditions documents are regarded as the province of the historian and not the social scientist. Yet many rural survey research reports would be enriched if they were grounded in historical interpretations. On the other hand, historians use oral traditions and documents to put right the chronology of events and by and large avoid nomothetic interpretations. CONCLUSION The aim of Uganda rural development studies is the accumulation of knowledge and information. Such information is useful to those who are interested in knowing, understanding and influencing the rural development process and problems. Each generation of Ugandans is likely to be interested in different aspects of the Uganda rural development process although there may be aspects of continuity. Each generation is likely to pose mainly those ques- tions deemed relevant to its needs; it is essential to screen and search inform- ation accumulated by past generation as an initial stetp in designing new research projects. Even if colonial researchers were interested in problems of order and stability of the traditional and the colonial society, the know- ledge they accumulated should be used as a source of hypotheses to be tested for continued validity. Where there is no previous studies we should classify the phenomena according to variables that may be assumed to influence the development process. Although such classification is regarded as a technique preparatory to the use of higher order techniques, i.e. hypotheses testing or modelling, it generates information that greatly increases the understanding of the</page><page sequence="20">JAMES KATOROBO 248 phenomena being studied. To identify differences and similarities among members of phenomena is to understand those differences and similarities. Such understanding of the Uganda rural development process and problems will enable the researcher to hypothesize relationships among variables which when tested will increase the understanding and the ability to influence, the Uganda rural development process.

In response to the criticism that colonial anthropology helped maintain order and stability in the colonial empire, Lucy Mair, "Anthropology and colonial policy" in African Affairs , Vol. 74, No. 295, April 1975, pp. 191-195, tries to deny this charge. But there is evidence in the files of colonial administrators show- ing that they valued the services of social scientists. For example, on 2nd November, 1957, the Chief Secretary to the Governor of Uganda informed the Secretary of the East African Institute of Social Research that a study of Dini ya Msambwa movement was needed (see Entebbe Archives file G S./S.2786). "Thirty members of the movement or cult known as Dini ya Msambwa or Yomut have recently been convicted of offences against Native Law in Karam oja, and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. These prisoners are now partly at Galu, partly at Soroti and the women among them at the women's prison, Luzira. The Government have long considered that this movement is one which it would be well worth investigating carefully, but hitherto it has been difficult to obtain reliable information about it. As you are no doubt aware, it flourishes chiefly in the Karasuk region on the border between Karamoja and Kenya. An article on the Dini ya Msambwa appeared in the East African Standard on 22nd March, 1957. It has been suggested that the East African Institute of Social Research might be interested in undertaking an investigation of this movement, and that if so the thirty members who are now in custody might provide a useful starting point. I am therefore enquiring whether your Institute would consider making such a study and if so whether it could be undertaken in the near future. To facilitate such a study, all or selected prisoners could be concentrated at Luzira. If the Institute does decide to make (the study, government will do) everything pos- sible to assist and will make available the information which we have about the movement". On 3rd January, 1958, the request was withdrawn, "...am directed to inform you that the Government does not now wish an investigation into the Dini ya Msambwa Movement to be undertaken for the time being. If circumstances alter and if we would like you to consider making such a study, we shall of course approach you again". But colonial research politics is a special case of a more general problems which is the relationship between research and politics, and researchers and governments.</page><page sequence="21">249 RURAL DEVELOPMENT This general problem can best be answered in terms of the following hypotheses: (a) When scholarship values are dominated by the norm of objectivity and neutrality, use of researchers by governments is condemned; but when the dominant value is policy science, such use is regarded as the ideal relation- ship. (b) When politics unpopular, research influenced by political goals is con- demand; but when politics is popular the influence of political goals on research is expected and rewarded. (c) When there are frequent contacts between politicians and academics, there is unease about politicization of academia. When there is very little contact, academia resents being ignored by the government. I. Audrey Richards: East African Chiefs . New York: Praeger, 1959. A. Lloyd Fallers: (ed.)

Stating attributes of a people should be done without extreme projection and prejudice. Such attributes may be important for the understanding of rural development. For example, in Buganda the people came to be accustomed to Banyarwanda, Banyankole and Bakiga cheap labour to the extent that they acquired habits of aleisured class, 'cheap labour is now no longer available and yet work habits acquired under circumstances of cheap labour remain dominant in Buganda and may be slowing down the pace of rural development, Baganda impress me as iddlers in bureaucratic settings and show drive and dynamism in private enter- prise. The problem of inappropriate work habits may be generalized to the national level in terms of an education system which encourages white colar habits of work and does not encourage manual labour or produces people who dispise manual labour. 9.

Most non conformists have got destroyed physically and psychologically. One major method of dealing with dissenters is not to publish their works. Many important soviet literacy figures have had only a small amount of their works published (Pushkin). We may mention Boris Pasternak, Yevegeny Yevtushenko and Alexandr Solzhenitsyn as examples of Russian dissenting academics. 14.

I will be referring to concepts and theories as having information storage capacity. But this is an anthropomorphism; to regard storage as occurring in the mind is unsatisfactory also since retreaval or the experience of what is alleged to be stored, requires an external stimuli. Informativeness is a product of equal participation between the mind, language and phenomena. 18. S.S. Stevens: "Mathematics, Measurement, and Psychophysics", in S.S. Stevens (ed.)

Here I am concerned with the specific relationship between politics and deve- lopment.

Different types of personalities may be conceived as constituting a psychological space. If an individual can easily change his person- ality to take on these other personalities and back again to his own, he may be psychologically mobile. This form of communication is very important for breaking down isolationism and the more citizens of one country vacariously live the lives of other peoples, the greater the reduction of isolationism. It may be argued that technology has, at the world level, conquered physical isolation and that the remaining barriers are the psychological ones. I believe that this is true. But it is also true that rural societies are not participating in the technological conquest of space. For most of rural Uganda the major constraint on development is the transportation of peoples and resources across geographical space. Indeed there is very high association between access to roads and railways and modernization. 41. Hägen, pp. 119-120. 42. Hägen, pp. 462-468. 43.
