London: Humphrey Milford. Pp. 22 with I7 plates. 6s. Celtic archaeologists owe much to the two Attic drinking-cups buried with the chieftain at Klein Aspergle, Wurtemberg; for it was these red-figure vessels, adorned with Celtic gold-work, that roused Doctor Jacobsthal's interest in Early Celtic art. His writings on the La Tene style reveal a new approach: the method of the classical archaeologist. In the searching light of his observation and through his profound knowledge of southern and eastern ornamental forms he has analysed the masterpieces of Early Celtic art and elicited from many of them the secrets of their date and origin. Jacobsthal's work on the art of the La Tene period is the first thoroughly comprehensive attempt to set that style against the background of the arts of Europe and Asia. Thanks to Reinecke and others the dependence of that style on southern inspiration has long been recognised, but Jacobsthal is the first scholar who has adequately dealt with the influences of the Orient. The present lecture is not only the first contribution solely concerned with Early Celtic imagery; it is to a great extent a survey of Eastern influences which played the dominant role in this particular aspect of La Tene art. These influences are most conspicuous in the earliest La Tene masterpieces (Phase A): in the ensuing phases (B-D) they are less apparent. The figural motifs to which this lecture is devoted fall into two main categories: anthropo- morphic and zoomorphic motifs, in both of which the demoniac character is prominent. With a few exceptions, mainly sculpture (p. 6 f.), the anthropomorphic element is confined to masks in which the influence of the East is very pronounced: this applies especially to the highly stylized examples. Two later objects from France, embellished in Jacobsthal's third style, are illustrated (plates 6, 7): on these, mask motifs are combined with spiral ribbons, the treatment of the masks being strangely different from the ' face-tendrils ' on the gold bracelets from Waldalgesheim (Style II). Jacobsthal writes, ' There is something fleeting and evanescent about these masks, which often are not even complete faces, only bits of a face. It is the mechanism of dreams where things have floating contours and pass into other things. One might call the style the Cheshire style: the cat appears in the tree and often just the grin of the cat.' With regard to the zoomorphic elements, instances are given of the Voracious Beast motif, among them the handle of the bronze flagon from Duirrnberg (pl. 8a), and its sixth century, ultimately Syrian, prototype-an Etruscan flagon-handle from Perugia (pl. 9). The neck-ring from Glauberg (pl. ioa), on which this motif also appears, he regards as possibly the work of an Eastern artist employed by a Celtic patron: certain details in the treatment of the lions upon this ring point towards Persia; while in the magnificent gold bracelet from Rodenbach (pl. i ia) he notices Scythian as well as Persian influence. It was this grave which yielded the gold finger-ring (pl. 4b) whose Etruscan prototype, dating from c. 475-450 B.C., he also figures (pl. 4c). The Double-beast motif is dealt with and, incidentally, affords a striking instance of the value of Jacobsthal's method: he is the first to recognise that the small fragtnent of bronze, found in i85I in one of the Chieftains' graves at Weisskirchen and published only in Lindenschmit, Alterthiimer II, Viii, pl. 3, 4, formed part of a brooch and was originally a lion with a single head and two bodies (pl. i ic). The Double-beast motif is a good instance of an ancient but very long-lived Eastern motif which reached Europe at different periods. As Jacobsthal observes, the Double-beast first appears in the West in Minoan times, recurs later during the Orientalising period and, later still, in this lion from Weisskirchen, the immediate prototype of which is Persian. The motif actually persists into the Roman period (p. I4). Animalised lyres, scrolls, and tendrils are analysed and illustrated. Two outstanding examples of these are to be seen on the girdle-clasp from H6lzelsau (pl. 14a) and sword scabbard from La Tene (pl. Isa). The latter belongs to his Third or Swiss-Hungarian style and is later than the majority of the objects discussed; but it is of interest to British archaeologists as Style III is closely related to the ' Witham-Wandsworth school ' of the insular Celts, in which ornithomorphosed tendrils occur. Animalised scrolls reached Northern Europe from the East at an earlier date; dragonesque heads appear on otherwise native multilinear scroll-work typical of Period V as well as Period VI of the Nordic late Bronze Age.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND NOTICES OF PUBLICATIONS II3 The concluding remarks of Dr. Jacobsthal's lecture are of a general nature. Not the least pregnant of them is the parallel drawn between the rise of the La Tene style and the effect of the Oriental influence upon Greek art of the late eighth and seventh centuries: ' The rise of Celtic art in the late fifth century B.C. repeats in the North a process that had taken place in the South two hundred years before: the Greeks freed themselves and all other peoples bonae voluntatis, from the bonds of a rigid geometric style which governed the whole of Europe during the first centuries of the first millennium B.C., the so-called Hallstatt Age; the Greeks overcome the geometric style by taking over the curvy, melodious forms of various Eastern arts. What the Orient had been to the Greeks, Greek art was now to the Celts.' It should be stated in conclusion that this lecture touches upon an aspect of the material which Dr. Jacobsthal has analysed at greater length in his monumental Early Celtic Art, now in the Press. J.
