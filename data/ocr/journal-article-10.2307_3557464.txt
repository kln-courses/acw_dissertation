INTRODUCTION: INTERTEXTUALITY THROUGH REPLICATION Any text is constructed as a mosaic of quotations; any text is the absorption and transformation of another ... In the space of a given text, several utterances, taken from other texts, intersect and neutralize one another.1 ONE of the most conspicuous manifestations of postmodernism in musicology is the weakening of the structuralist conception of the closed and unitary work of art. Its destabilization as a consequence of the development of the notion of intertextuality - influence, leading to explicit and implicit connections between works - has been striking in the past 40 years, and it is now widely accepted that works of art are sometimes best understood as fluid 'networks or relational events',2 rather than 'closed and static entities'.3 Whether one subscribes to the Derridean notion of 'dissemination', the Bakhtinian concept of 'dialogic' relationships,4 or the Bloomian idea of the 'anxiety of influ- ence',5 one is essentially accepting that a work of art can be understood in terms of what it shares - or does not share - with its antecedent texts as part of a historical dialectic. It is perhaps true to say that intertextual connections in music became more highly charged in the nineteenth century, when the notion of the work concept - and its attendant call to originality and progress - was becoming strongly established in Western art culture.6 In the eighteenth century, by contrast, when this notion was rather more vestigial, musical material was more freely assimilated by The author is grateful to Julian Rushton for stimulating the development of some of the ideas in this article, to DouglasJarman and two anonymous reviewers for perceptive comments on earlier drafts, and to Graham Cummings for the translation of Metastasio's 'Ecco quell fiero istante' in Section 6. 1 Julia Kristeva, in Kevin Korsyn, 'Beyond Privileged Contexts: Intertextuality, Influence, and Dialogue', Rethinking Music, ed.

Mozart is one composer in whose works such intertextual connec- tions are of central importance. As is richly evident from the music, he was capable of assimilating elements of other composers' styles and integrating them into his own - from the echoes ofJ. C. Bach in such early symphonies as the D major, K.19 (1765), and paraphrases of Haydn's Sturm und Drang manner in the G minor Symphony, K.183/173dB (1773), to the Handelian Qui tollis of the Mass in C minor, K.427/417a (1783). More generally, Mozart and his contem- poraries, living at a time when the universality of style matched the cosmopolitan society and politics of Europe, partook of a rich lexicon of distinctive musical figures - including the loci topici discussed by Ratner, Allanbrook and Agawu8 - which they assimilated from each other and from their own earlier works. This question of recurrence in Mozart - made transparent by the crisply articulated nature of the Classical style, the clarity of his textures, and his frequent highlighting of the melodic element - is one which has motivated a rich tradition of research by Mozart scholars for many years, perhaps receiving its greatest single impetus with the work of Chantavoine.9 While it is relatively straightforward to observe examples of inter- textual connection, certainly in Mozart, it is perhaps less easy to deter- mine why such relationships should exist. Even the invocation of pragmatic considerations and appeals to the weight of traditional procedures - the pressures to compose imposed upon the musician-as- servant, the acceptance of the conventions of modelling and imitation - have the flavour of assertions rather than explanations. To attempt to offer a new perspective on this question, I shall outline here what some may regard as a radical reinterpretation of intertextuality, seeing it not as a guiding principle in itself, but rather as a function and conse- quence of the 'meme'. The memetic paradigm, formulated by the evol- utionary biologist Richard Dawkins, maintains that human culture is dominated by the replication of units analogous to genes which are ultimately 'selfish' - in Dawkins's famous phrase - in that they tran- scend the intentionality of the composer and appear to act to favour their own survival and evolution over time. To illustrate this view, I shall examine in memetic terms a particu- larly clear and focused case of intertextual connections between four late pieces by Mozart. This investigation will begin from a largely idiom- orientated standpoint (Section 2), to use a term from Meyer,1o but 7 Norman Carrell, Bach the Borrower (London, 1967; repr.

Finally, I shall consider how certain verbal-conceptual (textual) memes exist in association with the purely musical memes in these four pieces (Section 6), before sum- marizing the principal issues raised here (Section 7). 2. MELODIC COMPLEXES IN LATE MOZART First, I consider the nature of the intertextual connections between the four Mozart pieces. In an insightful article Eckelmeyer identifies 'two complexes of recurrent melodies related to Die Zauberfl6te'.11 The first complex links Pamina's aria 'Ach ich ftihl's' (no. 17), the Lied der Trennung 'Die Engel Gottes weinen', K.519 (1787), the Adagio intro- duction to the finale of the G minor String Quintet, K.516 (also 1787), and melodies from the D minor Piano Concerto, K.466 (1785), and is illustrated in her Example 1, 'Melodies related to Pamina's aria'.12 While there are indisputable similarities between the melodies from the concerto and the other works (particularly in relation to the opening phrases of the quintet's Adagio, bars 1-9), they are arguably of less significance than the connections between the aria, lied and quintet, and are, it will be seen, not directly relevant to the present discussion. Eckelmeyer's Example 1 shows, by artful alignment, the remarkable correlation between the melodies of 'Die Engel', the Adagio and 'Ach ich fiihl's', but although the considerable harmonic similarities between the passages are acknowledged,13 they are not explicitly incor- porated into the diagram, which is essentially linear. My Example 1 represents both melodic and harmonic affinities, and includes a fourth piece not discussed in Eckelmeyer's article, Madame Herz's arietta 'Da schligt die Abschiedsstunde' (no. 1) from Der Schauspieldirektor, K.486 (1786), to which, it will be seen, the other three pieces are very closely related.14 " Judith A. Eckelmeyer, 'Two Complexes of Recurrent Melodies Related to Die Zauberfl6te', Music Review, 41 (1980), 11-25. 12 Ibid., 13-15. The second complex, illustrated in her Examples 3(a) and (b), shows 'Melodies related to the final chorus, Heil sei euch Geweihten!' (no. 21, bars 828ff.), and 'Melodies related to the Adagio before the chorale' (no. 21, bars 190ff.), respectively (ibid., 20-1). The melodies consti- tuting this complex might best be regarded as based upon a (1-7 ... 2-1) 'changing-note' archetype/schema in the Meyer/Gjerdingen sense; see Robert O. Gjerdingen, A Classic Turn of Phrase: Music and the Psychology of Convention (Philadelphia, 1988), 55-9. 13 Eckelmeyer, 'Two Complexes', 16. 14 The example is a particella showing the principal melodic line, the bass line and an occa- sional inner part of the arietta, Adagio, lied (here transposed from F minor to G minor) and aria. (To facilitate comparison with the other three pieces, all analytical discussion of the lied in this article will refer to this transposed version, speaking of it as if it were in G minor. The relevance of the difference between the key of the lied and that of the other three pieces will be considered in Section 6.) Figured bass numerals are added at times to clarify the harmonic content. The</page><page sequence="4">THE EVOLUTION OF A 'MEMEPLEX' IN LATE MOZART 33 As a result of taking harmonic factors into consideration, incorpo- rating the arietta, and examining the relationship between the opening of the final Allegro of the quintet, bars 39-42, and the coda of the aria, bars 38-41, some of my alignments - i.e. my interpretations of the correlations - differ from those of Eckelmeyer. In interpreting the major connections, Example 1 proposes the existence of a sequence of configurations which recurs largely intact in the four pieces. This sequence consists of seven discrete units which I term memes A-G: a detailed explanation of this terminology will be provided in Section 3 below. These seven units are identified and defined by virtue of their melodic and harmonic analogy in all four pieces. The following are the salient characteristics of the seven memes. Meme A: The opening tonic area This meme is characterized by a prolongation of tonic harmony by means of the progression i3-13_iv6--4_-i3, the raised third of the tonic chord preparing the central emphasis on subdominant harmony. In the Adagio and aria this basic sequence is further intensified by follow- ing the iv6-4 by a grating #7-?7-6-4-2 on G. Melodically, the meme is defined by its primary focus on the scale-degree sequence 5-1-6-5, the pitches varying to some extent in their register and disposition in each copy of the meme. Meme B: The subsequent dominant prolongation Meme B is defined by the prolongation of dominant harmony by means of an augmented-sixth chord (in the arietta and aria) or a diminished-seventh chord (#vii7/V) (in the Adagio and lied). Melodically, the meme gravitates around the scale-degree collection 1, #4 and 5, the pitches again varying in their register and disposition between pieces (1 is not present in the lied, except in the lower voice, sounding against the #4 of the upper voice on the first quavers of bars 9 and 11). music is disposed so as to align vertically major structural correspondences - the seven memes A-G - between groups of bars. The symbols used in the particella are as follows. (1) The seven memes are shown enclosed by solid vertical continuity of the barlines. Where the differences of metre permit, these continuous lines also occur within the groups. (2) Continuous dotted (bar)lines indicate functional parallelisms, e.g. bar 19 of the arietta and bar 8 of the aria, where the passages linked by the dotted line are analogous contrasting themes in the relative major. (3) Without continuity of barlines, even when barlines are aligned vertically, passages are not in direct correspondence; such coincidences are necessary to allow alignment of the structural corre- spondences. (4) Brackets and lines (apart from such lines as indicate the voice exchanges within meme C) draw attention to specific pitch correspondences (as in meme G). Some secondary correspondences, because of the overriding influence of more important similarities, are not vertically aligned (e.g. the bass of bars 12-13 of the arietta and the bass of bars 3-4 of the aria).</page><page sequence="5">34 STEVEN JAN Example 1.

Thereafter, in the arietta and lied, an upper-voice motion 4-3 and lower-voice #7-i give rise to a double interlocking voice exchange, as indicated by the inter- secting diagonal lines in Example 1. The upper (#7-1-4-3) and lower (4-3-#7-1) lines of this structure are inverted in the aria, its initial melodic gesture 6-#7 (bar 241) being similarly treated. Meme D: Quasi-tetrachordalfigures Not present in the arietta, this meme is derived from a tetrachordal pitch collection which, in its fullest form, in the Adagio and aria, pairs a descending lower-voice sequence ?7-64-b6-5 with an ascending upper-voice 3_-44-#4_5.15 The melodic element is articulated in these two pieces by distinctive falling diminished sevenths, b2-t3 and b3-#4. The lied also presents a falling melodic diminished seventh b2-_3, but this is associated with only a small subset of the tetrachordal collection, and effects the conversion of the E6 major 5-3 harmony of bar 161 to the C minor 6-3 of bar 171, an implied 5-6 motion above bass Eb. Example 1 shows that the aria synthesizes the tetrachordal structure of the Adagio with the V-VI interrupted progression and 5-6 motion over E 6 of the lied. Meme E: End-dominant preparation and elaboration As with meme B, meme E is characterized by the prolongation of dominant harmony. Here, again, the melodic scale-degree collection 1, #4 and 5 of meme B is in evidence (especially in the arietta and aria), but the upper neighbour-note lower-voice motion of the earlier meme (in the arietta and aria) is more pronounced and is combined with the diatonic and chromatic lower neighbour notes. As in the prolongation of the dominant in meme B, the augmented-sixth chord, associated with the upper neighbour note, and the diminished-seventh chord (#vii7/V; but V6-5/V in the Adagio), associated with the chromatic lower neighbour, are prominent. I interpret bar 18 of the lied as articu- lating meme E and it is here that my reading diverges most substan- tially from that of Eckelmeyer. Her Example 116 aligns bar 18 of the 15 In some works of Mozart's - such as bars 21-5 of the second movement of K.516 - the rising upper-voice structure b3-?3-t4-#^-5 is associated with the descending chromatic tetra- chord 1-t7-t6-^,6-5 in the lower voice. It is this association which prompts my reading of the structure in the Adagio and aria as 'quasi-tetrachordal', for these passages are perhaps best under- stood as selections from a total resource. For a fuller discussion of these figures, see Steven Jan, Aspects of Mozart's Music in G Minor: Toward the Identification of Common Structural and Compositional Characteristics (London and New York, 1995), Chapter 7. See also Peter Williams, The Chromatic Fourth during Four Centuries of Music (Oxford, 1998), Chapter 6; the tetrachordal figures in the Adagio and aria are, however, not examined by Williams. 16 Eckelmeyer, 'Two Complexes', 15.</page><page sequence="16">THE EVOLUTION OF A 'MEMEPLEX' IN LATE MOZART 45 lied with bars 36-8 and bars 37-8 respectively of the Adagio and aria (these passages being designated meme F below). This is certainly tenable, for there is a shared melodic contour; but if the piano coda of the lied's strophe (bars 19-22) and not its bar 18 is held to contain meme F, then the harmonic content of bar 18, essentially a dominant chord preceded by its lower neighbour note, supports a reading of this bar as meme E. Example 1 shows that the arietta and aria present meme E in a very similar manner. Meme F: Closing melodic descents This meme, absent from the arietta, is characterized by a melodic descent by step 0/t6 ... #7 over dominant harmony (resolving subse- quently to 1/i in the lied), preceded, in the Adagio and aria, by the arpeggiations #7-2-4 and 2-4--/b6. It will be seen from Example 1 that a substantial part of the total melodic resource of this meme, the segment 2-4-6 ... #7, also appears earlier in the aria, in its presen- tation of meme C at bars 23-4. Meme G: Continuations Not present in the arietta and lied, this meme - the basis of the theme of the 6/8 G major Allegro which forms the main part of the quintet's final movement, and of the instrumental coda to the aria - is characterized by a scalic descent 5-#7(-1). Harmonically, aside from the common tonic opening and analogous concluding ii6-3/II6-3I-4/i6-4-V-(i) cadences, there is an equivalent emphasis on the subdominant in bar 405 of the quintet's finale and bar 393 of the aria. The change of mode and mood at this point of the quintet is akin to the procedure of the arietta (bars 42ff.), although I do not read any memetic connections between these passages. 3. AN OVERVIEW OF THE MEMETIC PARADIGM These intertextual similarities are clearly striking, and call for a conceptual framework within which they may be understood. As suggested at the opening, one way of comprehending such analogies is in terms of the meme concept. A meme, in Dawkins's celebrated definition from The Selfish Gene, is a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation ... Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches. Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs, so memes propagate them- selves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation.17 17 Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene (2nd edn, Oxford, 1989), 192.</page><page sequence="17">46 STEVEN JAN While constraints of space prevent a full discussion of the nature and ramifications of the memetic paradigm,18 it is necessary to outline the following central points in order to contextualize the memetic interpretation of the Mozart passages which follows in Sections 4-6 below. Memetics - which some regard as a 'long-awaited scientific theory unifying biology, psychology, and cognitive science'19 - is predicated on the notion that the meme, the unit of cultural information - in the verbal, visual and, as I assert here, musical realms - may be compared to the unit of biological information, the gene, in that it is dissemi- nated by replication between the members of a cultural community, giving rise to a number of copies or 'coequals'.20 Moreover, the gene and the meme are themselves members of a larger class of entities which Dawkins terms 'replicators' - that is, 'any entity in the universe of which copies are made'.21 This principle is the foundation of the concept of 'universal Darwinism', whereby in addition to biological evolution as it is normally understood, Darwinian evolution is also operating to produce the transformations in time that we see in certain other spheres, such as immune system function and even the way science itself [as a component of culture generally] operates.22 18 For book-length treatments offering an overview of memetics, see Susan Blackmore, The Meme Machine (Oxford, 1999); Richard Brodie, Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme (Seattle, 1996); and Aaron Lynch, Thought Contagion: How Belief Spreads through Society - The New Science of Memes (New York, 1996). For more critical voices, some of the essays in Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science, ed. Robert Aunger (Oxford, 2000), come from disci- plinary perspectives (such as anthropology and sociology) which are somewhat sceptical of the meme concept. A more technical, mathematically orientated account of memetic transmission and evolution is given in Aaron Lynch, 'Units, Events and Dynamics in Memetic Evolution', Journal of Memetics - Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission, 2/1 (1998) (&lt;http:// jom-emit.cfpm.org/1998/vol2/lynch_a.html&gt;).

When testing candidate strings of data (in a variety of media, including music) for memetic content, the presence of such corresponding segments in two contexts allows the initial and terminal elements and medial content of the meme to be defined by reference to that portion of the information stream which is replicated (i.e. the coequal). In this way, a 'quasi-digital' order arises from what is otherwise - from a memetic perspective - undif- ferentiated, 'analogue', data. 21 Richard Dawkins, The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene (London, 1982; repr. Oxford, 1983), 293. 22 Henry C. Plotkin, Darwin Machines and the Nature ofKnowledge: Concerning Adaptations, Instinct and the Evolution of Intelligence (London, 1995), xvii.</page><page sequence="18">THE EVOLUTION OF A 'MEMEPLEX' IN LATE MOZART 47 Such a particle as the phrase 'To be, or not to be, that is the question' (Shakespeare, Hamlet, 3, i, 56) survives intact by replication within Western culture because it has the property of cultural salience - in Brodie's terms, it has the effect of 'pushing our [psychological- emotional] buttons' because of its arresting existential imagery23 - which promotes its replication. The attributes of 'longevity' (the dura- bility of any single copy of a replicator), 'fecundity' (the propensity of a replicator to engender its duplication), and 'copying-fidelity' (the accuracy of the replication process)24 ultimately decide the fate of all replicators, be they genes, patterns of pitches and rhythms, or 'a sheet of paper that is xeroxed'.25 Just as with the gene, however, there is no hard-and-fast definition of what constitutes a meme. Indeed, the biologist Seymour Benzer proposed refining the somewhat loose concept of the gene by focusing it into the categories of 'muton' ('the minimum unit of mutational change'), 'recon' ('the minimum unit of recombination') and 'cistron' ('the unit responsible for synthesizing one polypeptide chain').26 In Dawkins's view, however, the gene is any portion of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection ... a genetic unit that is small enough to last for a large number of generations and to be distrib- uted around in the form of many copies ... a unit which, to a high degree, approaches the ideal of indivisible particulateness.27 This definition - Dawkins speaks of the 'optimon', 'the unit of natural selection'28 - is perhaps the most utilitarian. Moreover, it is readily applicable to the meme. That which is replicated and survives over time attains memetic status. In music, this essentially restricts the meme to small collections of pitches and rhythms, generally of no more than a few bars' length - as is the case in the seven memes shown in Example 1.29 Much writing on memetics imports the biological distinction between the 'genotype' (the total genetic complement of an indi- vidual) and the 'phenotype' (the expression of that complement in the form of the individual's morphology and its patterns of behaviour). Memetics regards the fundamental form of the meme to be patterns of neuronal interconnection in the brain, an individual's total memetic complement being known as the 'memotype'. The physical manifes- tations of these memes, the 'phemotype', are behavioural patterns and the resultant artefacts they engender.30 In the category of behavioural 23 Brodie, Virus of the Mind, 91. 24 Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, 18, 194. 25 Dawkins, The Extended Phenotype, 83. 26 Ibid., 81. 27 Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, 28, 32, 33. 28 Dawkins, The Extended Phenotype, 81. 29 See Jan, 'Replicating Sonorities', Section 5, for more detailed discussion of the segmenta- tion of the musical continuum into memes by means of the criteria of particulateness and co- equality. 30 Blackmore, The Meme Machine, 63.</page><page sequence="19">48 STEVEN JAN patterns, one would include the activities of composition and perform- ance; in the category of artefacts, one would include notated musical scores and the patterns of sound waves for which they code in perform- ance. While a full discussion of this matter is not possible in the present context, it is clear that the memotype-phemotype distinction has profound philosophical implications for the ontology of music. The memotype-phemotype dualism also underpins what might be regarded as the epidemiological aspect of memetics. Despite being strictly part of the body - it is, after all, a collection of nerve cells - in its memotypic form a meme residing in a brain is analogous to an infec- tive agent, for it has been acquired, like an infection, by contact with an infected individual, or rather by contact with the phemotypic products of an infected individual. It therefore exists in a sometimes mutualist, sometimes commensal, but often parasitic relationship with its human host.31 In its phemotypic form, the meme is transmitted to other hosts, often spreading to infect whole swathes of geographical and conceptual space; the epidemiological and evolutionary accounts of language transmission and mutation given by Darwin32 and expanded upon by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman33 describe only one element of this central cultural phenomenon. The memetic replication underpinning human culture occurs at several hierarchic levels. Meyer's formulation of this hierarchy - not, however, in memetic terms - proposes the levels of 'laws' (which are 'transcultural constraints ... the principles governing the perception and cognition of musical patterns'); 'rules' (which are 'intracultural, not universal', and which 'constitute the highest, most encompassing level of stylistic constraints'); 'dialect' (which represents 'substyles that are differentiated because a number of composers ... employ (choose) the same or similar rules and strategies'); 'idiom' (which refers to constraints 'a composer repeatedly selects from the larger repertory of the dialect'); and 'intraopus style' (which is 'concerned with what is replicated within a single work').34 As sets, each of which is included by the set at the hierarchic level above it, one might imagine these stratified relationships in the form of a Venn diagram or, as in Nattiez, an inverted pyramid.35 The level of laws represents 31 See Juan D. Delius, 'Of Mind Memes and Brain Bugs: A Natural History of Culture', The Nature of Culture: Proceedings of the International and Interdisciplinary Symposium, October 7-11, 1986 in Bochum, ed. Walter A. Koch (Bochum, 1989), 26-79. Examples of such harmful memes, by which is meant those which in some way impede the replication of the host's genes, include, at their most extreme, suicide cults (Blackmore, The Meme Machine, 47, 51) and, more subtly, memes for contraception (Lynch, Thought Contagion, 91-2). The complex subject of gene-culture (meme) 'coevolution' is examined in William H. Durham, Coevolution: Genes, Culture, and Human Diversity (Stanford, 1991). 32 Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life (2nd edn, London, 1860), ed.

The lower levels represent our species' 'soft-wired' memory profiles, which are memetically deter- mined and transmitted. A single-unit meme is just one element in the myriad web of repli- cated patterns constituting a cultural community. As such it exists in varying degrees of 'coadaptation' with other memes. At times, memes are intimately connected with others such that, while they are occasion- ally replicated individually, they are also regularly, perhaps even preferentially, copied as part of 'coadapted meme complexes', or 'memeplexes', a notion discussed more fully in Section 4 below. As will be seen in Section 6 below, coadaptation may at times link musical memes with memes in the verbal-conceptual realm. The copying of memes in cultural systems is considerably less accurate than the copying of genes in biological systems, which is almost always completely faithful. Many such deviations from exact imitation - mutations - do not survive to be replicated: they may, for instance, be overwhelmed by the collective force of the parent form in the 'meme pool' (which can be taken to be any level of the cultural hierarchy higher than the idiom; for convenience, the dialect is gener- ally the most appropriate level). Others, however, given the often more distinctive cultural profile of mutants compared with their antecedent forms, eventually come to overwhelm their precursors by spreading, epidemiologically, through the meme pool. Over time, the complex- ion of the meme pool gradually changes as a result of this incursion of mutant memes with higher fecundity than their antecedents. This differential survival of mutant forms is the engine - Darwin's natural selection, or, as Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman adapt it, 'cultural selec- tion'36 - which drives cultural-stylistic evolution. Dennett concisely summarizes this process as follows: (1) variation: there is a continuing abundance of different elements [;] (2) heredity or replication: the elements have the capacity to create copies or replicas of themselves[;] (3) differential 'fitness': the number of copies of an element that are created in a given time varies, depending on interac- tions between the features of that element and features of the environment in which it persists.37 All three conditions are satisfied by the meme, from its tendency to miscopying (variation), its capacity for replication within the members of a cultural community (heredity), and the contrasting fecundity of different memes (differential fitness). On this reasoning, then, the transmission and reception of musical culture is, in essence, the outcome of a process of relentless competition between a near infinity 36 Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, Cultural Transmission and Evolution, 15. 37 Daniel C. Dennett, Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (London, 1995), 343.</page><page sequence="21">50 STEVEN JAN of replicators, each vying for that most precious, sustaining resource: memory capacity.38 Section 5 below returns to the issue of memetic evolution in more detail by examining the process as it applies to memes A-G in the Mozart pieces. Central to the striking conception embodied in Dawkins's phrase 'selfish gene' is the notion of the gene's appearing to act egotistically in furtherance of its own interest. To paraphrase him, an entity, such as a baboon or a gene, is said to be selfish if it has the effect (not the purpose) of promoting its own welfare at the expense of that of another entity.39 The most significant competitors of the gene in this sense are its 'alleles', its close equivalents or 'alternative forms', which act as rivals for the slots (loci) on a chromosome.40 Devoid of conscious- ness, the gene cannot be selfish, selfless, or in possession of any other attribute of higher organisms, yet the anthropomorphic metaphor of conscious intentionality effectively articulates the truism that those genes which tend to act - i.e. engender phenotypic effects - in such a way as to increase the chances of their survival - via that of their host organism - will, self-evidently, prevail and be replicated, to the disadvantage of those less phenotypically consequential genes. Powerful as the selfish gene metaphor is, it is founded upon a (tauto)logical and mechanistic process entirely devoid of conscious agency or intentionality. It is in the nature of such processes that they often appear to be powerfully goal-directed and intentional. Applying this logic to the realm of culture, a meme, to reiterate Dawkins's formulation, can be said to be selfish if it has the effect (again, not the purpose) of promoting its own welfare - that is, its survival by replication - at the expense of that of another meme. Again, its most significant competitors are its memetic alleles - in this case, its mutational antecedents or consequents, or its configurational homo- logues. As is noted above, a mutant meme may possess greater cultural salience than its original form and may thereby have an increased propensity to imitation. Within the meme pool, such a meme may be selectively favoured - it may be differentially imitated in cultural contexts - and may therefore increase its statistical representation, being subject to a process of neo-Darwinian natural selection exactly equivalent to that operating upon the gene. As with the phenotypic manifestation of the gene, the phemotypic incarnation of the meme has a direct bearing upon its tendency to imitation and therefore ulti- mately on its representation in the meme pool. It is in this sense that we may comprehend the reflexive 'themselves' in Dawkins's statement cited earlier that 'memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which ... can be called imitation'; 41 and it is in the same sense that all references in this article 38 See Jan, 'The Memetics of Music' for an account, couched in terms of Narmour's impli- cation-realization model, of how mutational changes to a meme may increase its perceptual and cognitive salience and therefore its propensity to imitation. 39 Dawkins, The Extended Phenotype, 284. 40 Ibid., 283. 41 Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, 192.</page><page sequence="22">THE EVOLUTION OF A 'MEMEPLEX' IN LATE MOZART 51 to the apparent conscious intentionality of memes should be under- stood. To conclude this overview of the memetic paradigm, it seems that the most challenging implication of the 'meme meme' is that it proposes that our mental processes are largely meme-driven. As suggested in the discussion of stylistic hierarchies above, beyond the innate, 'hard-wired' attributes of our neural hardware, which regulate automatic and instinctive functions, our higher, most distinctively human, capacities are dependent upon a 'soft-wired' (memetic) component. Such knowledge and habits are acquired by exposure to the information other members of our cultural community propagate - both 'vertically', as parents, and 'horizontally', as peers. One contro- versial development of this line of argument, from Dennett, is that Human consciousness is itselfa huge complex of memes (or more exactly, meme-effects in brains) that can best be understood as the operation of a [serial] virtual machine implemented in the parallel architecture of a brain that was not designed for any such activities. The powers of this virtual machine vastly enhance the underlying powers of the organic hardware on which it runs, but at the same time many of its most curious features, and especially its limitations, can be explained as the byproducts of the kludges [i.e. ad hoc software alterations] that make possible this curious but effective reuse of an existing organ for novel purposes.42 Of course, such an interpretation fatally corrodes the notion of the 'great composer', whose conscious intentionality - so the work-concept memeplex induces us to believe - gives rise to the monistic, organic work of art. The memetic paradigm leads us inexorably to the melan- choly conclusion that the composer is merely a medium for selfish units of information which use his or her brain as a temporary repos- itory, and then as the means to engender the phemotypic products which will facilitate their transmission to other brains. I shall return briefly to this point in Section 7. 4. MUSICAL MEMES AND MEMEPLEXES: PARAMETRIC REPLICATION AND MEMETIC HIERARCHIES From this synopsis of the memetic paradigm, and from the connec- tions between the four pieces shown in Example 1 and discussed in Section 2 above, it is reasonable to suggest that each of the patterns A-G is indeed a meme, because each is a discrete and particulate entity replicated in at least two of the four pieces - and in the case of four of the memes, replicated in all four pieces. From their initial union in the arietta, memes A, B, C and E are replicated in the Adagio, lied and aria with three additional memes - D, F and G - being added in the Adagio and subsequently replicated (aside from the absence of meme G in the lied) in the later pieces. 42 Daniel C. Dennett, Consciousness Explained (London, 1993), 210.</page><page sequence="23">52 STEVEN JAN Moreover, because the pieces - certainly the Adagio and the aria - contain essentially the same complement and sequence of memes, the succession in each piece might be regarded as a memeplex43 consist- ing of the seven memes A-G. As Dawkins notes, Memes, like genes, are selected against the background of other memes in the meme pool. The result is that gangs of mutually compatible memes - coadapted meme complexes or memeplexes - are found cohabiting in indi- vidual brains. This is not because selection has chosen them as a group, but because each separate member of the group tends to be favoured when its environment happens to be dominated by the others.44 This sequence of memes, as the schematic representation in Figure 1(a) below illustrates,45 may itself be regarded as a superordinate unit meme, existing at what might be termed a memetic 'level 1', and repli- cated essentially intact, although in distributed form, in the four different contexts. Conversely, it will be evident that each of the memes A-G, located at what might be regarded as a memetic 'level 2', is itself a memeplex, consisting of discrete, independent memes in such parameters as melody, harmony and indeed rhythm, thereby creating a memetic 'level 3'.46 As with the memes at levels 1 and 2, these uniparametric level-3 units may also be considered to be memes, for they too are replicated in the context of the four pieces.47 Of course, the level-3 memes are part of the common memetic currency of late eighteenth-century style; and, as is explored in Section 5 below, the level-2 memes derive - spontaneous generation aside - ultimately from works of Mozart's predecessors and/or contempo- raries, and go on to be replicated in works of Mozart's contemporaries 43 For a memeplex to occur, it seems reasonable to suggest the following two necessary conditions. First, each of the particles constituting the memeplex must be replicated individually in at least one other context, in order for each particle to attain independent memetic status. Secondly, the collection of memes, the memeplex, must be replicated collectively in at least one other context, in order for this higher-level grouping itself to attain memetic status. 44 In Blackmore, The Meme Machine, xiv. 45 It will be understood that the two types of hierarchy represented here are structural, as opposed to Meyer's cultural hierarchies (the concepts of laws, rules, etc.) discussed in Section 3. The arrangement of this figure into 'Context 1' and 'Context N' represents the notion of repli- cation over time. 46 That memes also exist in the rhythmic dimension, sometimes independent of pitch, can be seen by comparing bar 6 of Example 1(a) with bar 10 of Example 1(b), where the pattern I1 :-:I is replicated. Indeed, a memetic reading of Maury Yeston, The Stratification of Musical Rhythm (New Haven, 1976), suggests the existence of rhythmic memes at hierarchic levels above the immediate foreground of local attack points. For present purposes, however, I will focus largely on memes in the parameter of pitch. 47 Narmour might regard the level-3 memes as 'style forms'. These, he notes, are 'those para- metric entities which achieve enough closure so we can understand their functional coherence without reference to the specific intraopus context from which they come - all those seemingly time-independent patterns, large and small, from parameter to parameter, which recur with statisti- cally significant frequency' (Eugene Narmour, Beyond Schenkerism: The Need forAlternatives in Music Analysis, Chicago, 1977, 173). Narmour might consider the level-2 memes to be 'style structures'. He notes that 'the [statistically common] contexts which result from [the syntactic] arrangement [of style forms] can be called style structures in the sense that they are directly tied to and contribute to the structure of real pieces, not just to constructed classes of things, as are style forms. Unlike the description of style forms, the identification of style structures involves ascribing time- dependent function to patterns ... in intraopus relationships' (ibid., 174).</page><page sequence="24">(a) Replication hierarchies Context I Context N ___..7..

The level-2 memes might also conceivably be found replicated individually, or as a memeplex, in other works by Mozart (replication at the level of idiom). As memeplexes of replicants in different musical parameters, the level-2 memes may be analysed using a network representation. In Example 2, level-2 meme A (a style structure) is shown in terms of the melodic, harmonic and rhythmic level-3 memes (the style forms) which constitute it in its four copies. Such a representation has relevance to understanding the perception and cognition of memes - and therefore their transmission and evolution - for Gjerdingen sees the style structure as a category of cognitive 'schema', its constituent style forms being akin to generative lower-level 'features'.48 In terms of the perception and cognition of meme A, the fundamental element - the pattern common to all four copies of the meme - is the shallow middleground-level pitch structure marked 'x' in Example 2 and linked to the largest, all-encompassing box. This is its schematic basis, the attribute which defines the identity of the meme; the features are those elements which generate this schema. None of these features is common to all four pieces, but all features are found in at least two and sometimes in three of the pieces. In perception - by the listener or the composer-as-listener - bottom- up perceptual processes at the opening of meme A in one of the four pieces will first identify some of its component features, but without at 48 Gjerdingen, A Classic Turn of Phrase, 45-6.</page><page sequence="26">THE EVOLUTION OF A 'MEMEPLEX' IN LATE MOZART 55 Example 3. Schematic pitch structure of level-2 memes A-G. Meme A B C Meme D E F Meme G 4' p " (dI this stage necessarily comprehending their broader context. At some point, the cumulative evidence of the features will elicit the selection, on best-fit criteria, of the middleground schema, which then regulates, by top-down perceptual processes, the search for the remaining features. The meme is deemed closed - instantiated - when all those expected features generating the schema are registered. In (re-)generation - by the composer - a middleground-level schematic meme is engendered by the bottom-up tendency of a set of foreground-level feature memes to conglomerate in a particular sequence, to form a memeplex. From a top-down perspective, however, the middleground meme has a number of loci along its length, anal- ogous to those on a chromosome, for which allelic feature memes conforming to the parameters of the class of features for that locus compete. The first position of the schema underpinning meme A, for instance, may only be filled by memes expressing tonic harmony and the scale degree 5 (see Example 2, bar 1 and box x). I will return to the top-down, bottom-up dichotomy in Section 5 below, in connection with a discussion of the evolution of Mozart's memeplex. In terms of pitch configurations, the memetic equivalence between the particles at level 2 of Figure 1(a) inheres in that which is invariant, in the underlying schematic (shallow-middleground) configuration of the memes, for at the foreground level most of the memes in any one of the pieces are clearly not exact copies of those in the other pieces, owing to the differences between memes at level 3. Example 3, after Example 1 and box x of Example 2, isolates the common schematic structures underpinning the memes at level 2 by reducing them to their basic voice-leading configurations. In this way, the rhythmic component of the level-2 memes, the independent level-3 rhythmic memes, is eliminated, as are surface pitch diminutions. In cases where there is variability between pieces in an element of the meme, the alternative components are enclosed in boxes (whereby the whole content of one box can be substituted for the whole content of another box); less substantial variants are enclosed in brackets.</page><page sequence="27">56 STEVEN JAN It should be noted that Figure 1(a) represents replication hierar- chies, not the voice-leading hierarchies which are generated in Schenkerian analysis by transformations deriving from the precepts of Fuxian counterpoint. The three levels of Figure 1(a) are only loosely analogous to Schenkerian foreground, middleground and background strata because - as a general principle and also in this particular context49 - some pitches of the superordinate level-i meme may not necessarily exist at a deep structural level according to Schenkerian voice-leading considerations. Conversely, it may be the case - again as a general principle and also in this particular context - that some pitches of the level-3 memes are of background status in a Schenker- ian reading. Nevertheless, as Figure 1(b) shows, the model sketched in Figure 1(a) may be adapted to represent, in hypothetical terms, memetic propagation at the three principal Schenkerian structural levels, and the generation of memeplexes at foreground and middle- ground levels. In Figure 1(b) each shaded box represents a meme; 27 such units are shown at the foreground level. (For clarity, multiples of three, generating a 3-2-1 Ursatz, are used in this illustration; and only one middleground level is represented.) The careted numeral in each fore- ground-level box represents the pitch upon which each meme is based; at this level, if the meme is lightly reduced, this pitch will be seen to be its principal element, the product of the various diminutions making up the extreme foreground level of the meme. As represented by the arrows leading up from the foreground level, pitches from these memes may exist - by virtue of their voice-leading status - at the next higher level, generating three three-component middleground memes. Similarly, arrows leading up from the middleground level represent three pitches from these middleground memes existing at the next higher level, generating a 3-2-1 Ursatz meme at the back- ground level. Given that a collection or complex of foreground-level memes which generates a given middleground-level structure might theoretically occur in another context - as the pieces under discussion demonstrate - then while existing as a middleground-level meme (it is memetic at this level because the same middleground-level structure occurs in these two contexts, and possibly others), it also exists as a memeplex at the foreground level (see again note 43 for a generic definition of a memeplex). Each individual foreground pattern is a meme (it exists in this form in these two contexts, and may exist independently in other contexts), but the complex is also memetic. Furthermore - applying the same principle recursively to higher levels - if it is accepted that a complex of middleground-level memes which generates a given background-level structure might theoretically occur in another context, then while existing as a background-level 49 Constraints of space prevent a detailed examination of the four pieces in Schenkerian terms.</page><page sequence="28">THE EVOLUTION OF A 'MEMEPLEX' IN LATE MOZART 57 meme (it is memetic at this level because the same background-level structure occurs in these two hypothetical contexts and - according to the precepts of Schenkerian theory - certainly others), it also exists as a memeplex at the middleground level. Each individual middleground pattern is a meme (it exists in this form in these two contexts, and may exist independently in other contexts), but the complex is also memetic. Clearly 'real' units at the foreground level generate 'virtual' configurations at higher structural levels. It may be the case that the same pattern is replicated at more than one level in the same work; or, in different works, the same pattern may be propagated not at their foregrounds, but at higher levels. In this second case, on a strict defi- nition, these are not units of direct imitation; but they are units of consequential replication and should still therefore be regarded as memetic.50 The structure of such higher-level memes is potentially instructive for what it can tell us about the 'conglomerative grammar' of foreground-orientated memes - how such memes stick together during the compositional process. This is ultimately a function of their initial and terminal nodes, their pitch content, and the way these elements interact with our innate perceptual and cognitive attributes. It will therefore be understood from these observations that there are two ways in which memes may participate in structural hierarchies. First, they are hierarchic in the sense represented by Figure 1(a), whereby uniparametric memes (at level 3) conglomerate to produce multiparametric memes (at level 2) and ultimately engender a global unit meme (at level 1) encompassing each of the pieces. Secondly, they are hierarchic in the sense represented by Figure 1 (b), whereby a given pitch meme or pitch memeplex at the foreground level may be recur- sively propagated at higher structural levels, retaining its virtual identity while disappearing from real perception.51 5. ANCESTORS AND DESCENDANTS: THE MEMEPLEX IN EVOLUTIONARY CONTEXT Beginning at the level of idiom, and examining the four pieces in chronological sequence, it is evident that, while the level-2 memes A-G essentially retain their middleground schematic identity over time (Example 3 above), they also undergo foreground evolutionary 50 Psychological studies have shown that the perceptual and cognitive reality of such virtual structures, at least to most listeners untrained in formal/structural analysis, is often fragile. Long concerned with this dichotomy, Cook speaks of 'discrepancies between the way in which theo- reticians and analysts think of compositions ... and the way in which listeners respond to them' (Nicholas Cook, Music, Imagination, and Culture, Oxford, 1990, 57). As a further complication, it will be evident that the conceptual and graphical constructs used to comprehend musical pattern- ing and structure are themselves memeplexes, being propagated within music-theoretical communities and subject to variation and selection, especially according to the criterion of perceived fit with that which they purport to explain. As such, they may not necessarily be suited clearly to resolve (or even detect) elements of the music the composer situates below the immedi- ately perceptible surface. 51 See Jan, 'Replicating Sonorities', Section 6, for more detailed discussion of the structural- hierarchic organization of memes and memeplexes.</page><page sequence="29">TABLE 1 PITCH EVOLUTION IN LEVEL-2 MEMES Adagio lied ariaa meme A Adds a dissonant #7-47-6-4-2 on G in bar 13'. meme B Intensifies the dominant prolongation of bars 15-17 by means of the #vii7/V of bar 16 and its associated #4. meme C Mutates the melodic 4-#7 motion of bar 32 of the arietta to 6-#7 in bar 18.

Reverts to the diatonic iv in bar 17. The descending motion from ?7 of the arietta (bars 39-40') is simplified and taken further, to #7 (bar 182), the bass figure of the arietta being retained.

Mutates the #vii7/V of the Adagio and lied into an augmented-sixth chord (#iv"-3, bar 56; ii#6-4-3, bar 66), perhaps derived from the arietta, bar 162-3. Retains the V-X-V-X-V pattern of the lied, where X is #vii7/V or an augmented-sixth chord. Mutates the rising motion 6-#7 into a falling pattern (bar 241). Inverts the double voice exchanges of the arietta and lied to c "/f#-bb '/g-f# /c-g'/Bb (bars 244-253).

The pattern of bar 39 of the arietta is mutated and intensified by bi in bar 32. Bars 33-5 intensify the prolongation of V of bars 40-1 of the arietta, introducing the chromatic ?6 (bar 346). Bars 362-38 of the Adagio are recreated in the tonic minor in bar 374-6 Recreates, in bars 384-406, the contour of bars 384-423 of the Adagio/finale, retaining the tonic minor and adding chromatic emphases on iv in bar 393 and the melodic 62 in bar 404. a Looking vertically at some of the memes represented in Example 1 (or horizontally in Table 1), it might be said that, at times, the aria represents an evolutionary synthesis or amalgamation of features found in the other pieces. For instance, in meme A the aria adopts the pitch sequence d"'-g" of bars 10-11 of the Adagio but in the register d"-g', first opened up in bars 1-2 of the lied. Similarly, the dissonant #7-47-6-4-2 on G of bar 13 of the Adagio is restored in bar 4 of the aria, after its absence in the lied, but with the prefatory melodic octave rise g'-g" in bars 2-3, first introduced in the analogous bars 2-3 of the lied. Comparable syntheses may be found in other memes in the aria, such as that concerning meme D noted in Section 2. o00</page><page sequence="30">THE EVOLUTION OF A 'MEMEPLEX' IN LATE MOZART 59 change, driven by mutation and emigration/immigration at level 3.52 Such mutations, in Mozart's replication of the memeplex and in its broader evolutionary history to be considered below, often involve increasing complexity, a process of expansion and filling-in of the parameters of pitch, rhythm and texture, although there are certainly exceptions to this general principle. Taking Example 1 above as its frame of reference, Table 1 charts the principal evolutionary changes occurring, in the parameter of pitch, at level 2 of Mozart's memeplex as a consequence of these lower-level changes. From this, and from observations made in Section 4 above, it seems that memetic evolution is contingent upon hierarchic location. The various forms of the seven level-2 memes have a common middle- ground schematic structure despite the surface variation engendered by memes at level 3; and the meme at level 1, certainly in the Adagio and aria, is largely invariant, despite the differences at lower levels. There appears, in other words, to be greater resistance to mutation the higher up the memetic-replication (Figure 1(a)) or Schenkerian- structural hierarchy (Figure 1(b)) a meme is situated. Conversely, there is a greater degree of what might be termed memetic entropy at the musical surface than at higher replication/structural levels. Another way of conceptualizing this phenomenon is in terms of the top-down and bottom-up perceptual/cognitive dichotomy discussed in connection with Example 2 above. The top-down pressure of the level- 2/middleground schema (style structure) is a force for conservation, acting to preserve the meme unchanged over time, whereas the bottom-up pressure of the level-3/foreground features (style forms) is a force for mutation, driving the evolutionary dynamic. Ultimately, as noted in Section 3 above, the fact that our perceptual and cognitive systems quickly become weary of the familiar - and that the verbal- conceptual 'novelty meme' ('that which is new and different is to be valued') has been a powerful element of Western culture since the Renaissance - means that the balance is tipped slightly towards the bottom-up pressure, in favour of those memes which maximize their propensity to imitation by means of perceptually and cognitively arrest- ing mutations. Again, to reiterate an observation made in Section 3, there is no conscious intentionality here. '"Good" [memes]', to para- phrase Dawkins, 'are blindly selected as those that survive in the [meme] pool. This is not a theory; it is not even an observed fact: it is a tautology.'53 Moving on to the level of dialect, it is the case that memes A-G are not confined to the four Mozart pieces under investigation, although 52 Strictly speaking, each level-3 meme, once it has been mutated, ceases to be a meme until a copy is made of the new form. When Mozart mutated the memes of the arietta in the Adagio in May 1787 the resultant level-3 particles may not have been memetic, for they may, for a time, have been unique, not yet imitated by other composers. Lynch speaks of a 'mnemon' - 'an item of brain-stored memory. When copied from one brain to another, it becomes a meme' - in such cases (Aaron Lynch, Mnemon 1998a: Y2K Memes (Issue 1), &lt;http://www.mcs.net/-aaron/ Mnemonl998a.html&gt;). See Jan, 'Replicating Sonorities', Sections 7 and 8, for more detailed discussion of the mechanism of memetic mutation and stylistic evolution. 53 Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, 86.</page><page sequence="31">60 STEVEN JAN it may be that their conglomeration into a memeplex first occurred in Mozart.54 These level-2 memes may perhaps be found separately, or indeed as a memeplex, elsewhere within Mozart's idiom, but they are not restricted to this level of the cultural-stylistic hierarchy, being part of the wider dialect of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century musical style. They therefore have an evolutionary history, beyond the limited snapshot shown in Table 1 above, of forms antecedent and consequent to those of Mozart, of incarnations before and after Mozart's repli- cation of them as a memeplex in the four pieces considered here. Table 2 indicates possible antecedent and consequent coequals of memes A-G from the dialect of Viennese classicism and other chrono- logically and geographically adjacent dialects. 'Possible' here means that while a direct imitative and causal connection between the antecedent patterns and Mozart's memeplex, and between Mozart's memeplex and the consequent configurations, may be difficult to verify in the absence of what Nattiez would term strong 'poietic' evidence,55 the connections between the particles are certainly sugges- tive. Nevertheless, it may well be the case that some or all of Mozart's memes originated from different antecedents from those proposed here, or from a synthesis of multiple antecedents (which may or may not have included those proposed here); and it may also be the case that Mozart's memes begat different consequents from those proposed here, and that the consequents here therefore arose from antecedents other than Mozart's. Despite these caveats, the coequals proposed in Table 2 retain the underlying middleground schematic (style structure) configuration of Mozart's level-2 memes, as represented in Example 3 above, but differ to varying degrees in their foreground (style form) detail, the pattern- ing analogous to that at level 3 in the Mozart memeplex. The level-2 memes therefore retain their archetypal identity over considerable periods of time - over a century, in the case of meme C - despite their shifting articulation by different surface features. In this sense, each of Mozart's memes A-G and their antecedent and consequent analogues may be regarded as constituting members of a synchronic set consist- ing of units of sufficient schematic consistency to be read as essentially the same meme at the shallow middleground level, despite the often substantial diachronic-evolutionary changes at the foreground level driven by mutational pressures over time. Example 4 illustrates a small selection of these coequals, from which the following issues (among others) arise (see also Table 2). Example 4(a), the antecedent coequal of meme A, is close morpho- logically to its first incarnation in the Mozart pieces, bars 6-9 of the arietta, with its upper-voice scale-degree sequence 5-1-6-5 and inflex- ion to iv via Ij3 over a tonic pedal. The registral disposition of the melodic pitches in the Stamitz is, however, closer to the form of the 54 The difficulty of verifying this point - requiring the examination of all Mozart's output - will, however, be readily apparent. 55 Nattiez, Music and Discourse, 10-16.</page><page sequence="32">THE EVOLUTION OF A 'MEMEPLEX' IN LATE MOZART 61 TABLE 2 POSSIBLE ANTECEDENT AND CONSEQUENT COEQUALS OF MEMES A-G antecedent coequal meme A Karl Stamitz: String Quartet in G minor, op. 2 no. 2 (c.1774), I, bars 1-4 meme B Haydn: Keyboard Sonata in G minor, Hob.

Example 4(b), the antecedent coequal of meme C, prefigures the melodic shape of the meme in the arietta, although without the voice- exchange structure of the Mozart pieces. Such gestures are common in recitativo secco and it may be the case that they are the original source of meme C. Certainly its forms in the Mozart pieces are often declamatory and recitative-like in character, as is the consequent coequal of this meme, from a climactic moment in Leonore's 'Komm, Hoffnung'.</page><page sequence="33">62 STEVEN JAN Example 4.

It is appropriate at this point to recall that memes B and E in the Mozart pieces have an essentially analogous configuration, consisting basically of a prolonged dominant harmony. Their locations are, however, quite different: meme B is situated towards the beginning of the pieces, prior to a move from the tonic to another harmonic/tonal area, whereas meme E is deployed towards the end of the pieces, in preparation for a firm closure on the tonic. This use of patterns of equivalent structure in two functionally different contexts is comparable to Gould and Vrba's notion of 'exaptation' in biology. They note that an 'adaptation' is any feature that promotes fitness and was built by selection for its current role (criterion of historical genesis). The operation of an adaptation is its function. ... We may also ... [label] the operation of a useful character not built by selection for its current role as an effect ... . But what is the unse- lected, but useful character itself to be called? ... We suggest that such characters, evolved for other usages (or for no function at all), and later 'coopted' for their current role, be called</page><page sequence="36">THE EVOLUTION OF A 'MEMEPLEX' IN LATE MOZART 65 exaptations. .. . They are fit for their current role, hence aptus, but they were not designed for it, and are therefore not ad aptus, or pushed towards fitness. They owe their fitness to features present for other reasons, and are therefore fit (aptus) by reason of (ex) their form, or ex aptus.56 While an account of the aetiology and evolution of the dominant prolongation is beyond the scope of this article, it is not difficult to imagine, in the context of late-modal/early-tonal music, the notion of the end-dominant being an exaptation from a historically earlier begin- ning-dominant - or vice versa. Example 4(e), the consequent coequal of meme G, is closest to the aria in its harmonic structure of chords based upon the descending- third sequence G-E'-C (the antecedent coequal of this meme, from the finale of Haydn's String Quartet op. 17 no. 5, is perhaps closer, certainly in melodic terms, to the quintet's finale theme). Beethoven's progression occurs, however, in the context of Bb major, not G minor, and starts with an initial third drop Bk-G. Moreover, Beethoven's phrase is not a mutation of the whole of Mozart's meme but of only a part of it; were Mozart's bar 38 to begin in Bb, then Beethoven's passage would be a copy of Mozart's bars 38-395. In this process of cutting and splicing, in which a segment of a meme is taken from an antecedent source and embedded into a later context, the passage from the Grosse Fuge may be regarded as a memetic analogue to the biological process of 'crossing over'. Here, the random exchange of components of the chromosome occurring during meiosis (cell division) results in segments of genes being extracted and repositioned on other chromosomes. 6. VERBAL-CONCEPTUAL MEMES COADAPTED WITH THE MEMEPLEX Although the memetic paradigm has been employed here primarily to interpret purely musical connections between the four pieces under investigation, it should be acknowledged that three out of the four involve texts. As suggested in Section 3 above, memes are propagated in many media, of which the verbal-conceptual realm is one of the most important. I conclude, therefore, by considering, in memetic terms, some issues arising from the association of verbal-conceptual memes with elements of the musical memeplex. The arietta and the aria form part of a sequence of five operatic solos in the key of G minor from the last decade of Mozart's life: 'Padre, germani, addio!' (Illia), no. 1 of Idomeneo, K.366 (1780); 'Traurigkeit ward mir zum Lose' (Konstanze), no. 10 of Die Entfiihrung aus dem Serail, K.384 (1782); 'Da schlfigt die Abschiedsstunde'; 'Zum Leiden bin ich auserkoren' (Konigin der Nacht), no. 4 of Die Zauberflite; and 'Ach ich fiihl's'. Unlike Mozart's previous G minor arias, also five in 56 Stephen J. Gould and Elisabeth S. Vrba, 'Exaptation - A Missing Term in the Science of Form', Paleobiology, 8/1 (1982), 4-15 (p. 6).</page><page sequence="37">66 STEVEN JAN number,57 these last five are intimately linked by the content of their texts. To my knowledge, no commentator has identified that, despite the widely different dramatic context of each aria, the sentiments of the characters have a common motivation: the experience of parting or loss.58 From this, it seems reasonable to suggest that G minor is a key Mozart began to associate, in the 1780s, with loss - not, as Einstein maintains, with the arguably less focused notion of 'fate'59 - and that the repli- cation of the same memes in the four pieces considered here may imply that the G minor quintet's Adagio has 'hidden' the same verbal- conceptual memes explicitly presented in the three vocal contexts. Put in more conventional terminology, the quintet's Adagio might be seen as having a 'subtext' of parting or loss. This notion is readily explica- ble from a semiotic perspective, wherein the musical memes fulfil the function of 'signifier(s)', and the verbal-conceptual memes with which they are coadapted in the arietta, lied and aria act as the 'signified'. In the Adagio, the signified, whilst not explicitly presented, is neverthe- less resonant by virtue of the unequivocal presence of the signifiers. Memes A, D and F, in particular, are strongly conformant in the Adagio and aria, and it seems reasonable to suggest that a memetic perspective may facilitate a hermeneutic analysis of the Adagio, whereby one may 'retrospectively' append the verbal-conceptual memes associated with certain musical memes in the aria to the corre- sponding musical memes in the Adagio. Why does the F minor Trennungslied contain memes replicated in three G minor pieces? This seems to be the consequence of some striking similarities between the verbal-conceptual memes of 'Da schligt' and 'Die Engel', which may have acted as a cue for the repli- cation in the lied of the musical memes associated with the verbal- conceptual memes of the arietta. The texts of the arietta, by the librettist of Die Entfiihrung aus dem Serail, Gottlieb Stephanie (1741-1800), and of the lied, by Klamer Eberhard Karl Schmidt (1746-1824), contain general similarities in imagery which gravitate around the remarkably specific replication of certain verbal-concep- tual memes. In the arietta, 'the hour of parting strikes' and the singer contemplates, in the meme 'Und du, und du, vielleicht auf ewig vergiBt ...' (bars 26-32), the possibility that her departed lover will forget her. In the lied, this same meme is a persistent refrain at the end of the vocal element of each strophe (bars 12-19). This verbal-concep- tual meme occurs in the context of meme C, perhaps the most overtly rhetorical of the seven level-2 memes in its surface realization; it seems 57 These arias are 'Betracht dies Herz' (Der Engel), no. 2 of the Grabmusik (Passionskantate), K.42/35a (1767); 'Nel sen mi palpita' (Aspasia), no. 4 of Mitridate, re di Ponto, K.87/74a (1770); 'Ma qual virtfi' (Cabri), no. 2 of La Betulia liberata, K.118/74c (1771); 'Vorrei punirti indegno' (Arminda), no. 13 of Lafinta giardiniera, K.196 (1775); and 'Tiger! wetze nur die Klauen' (Zaide), no. 13 of Zaide, K.344/336b (1779). 58 Jan, Aspects of Mozart's Music in G Minor, 56-7. 59 Alfred Einstein, Mozart: His Character, his Work, trans.

The memetic connections between these texts are the result of their descent from Metastasio's celebrated canzonetta 'Ecco quel fiero istante' (La Partenza) of 1746, as shown by the extracts in Table 3. 'Die Engel' (1779) is a 'second-generation' copy, being modelled on 'Da schligt des Abschieds Stunde' (Die Trennung) of 1773 by Johann Joachim Eschenburg (1743-1820), an earlier reworking of Metastasio's canzonetta.60 Both Eschenburg and Schmidt preserve the metrical structure of Metastasio's poem in their reworking of its content into German. 'Da schlagt', as Table 3 shows, is based on the first verse of the Metastasio and is derived from the Eschenburg version, as evidenced by the replication, with mutation, of the meme 'Da schligt des Abschieds Stunde'; indeed, Stephanie takes nothing from Schmidt that is not already in Eschenburg. The memetic connections between the four poems are italicized in Table 3. From these observations one might identify three context-specific conditions governing the relationship in Mozart between the key of G minor, the memeplex considered here, and its associated verbal- conceptual memes. First, it may be said that the strongest 'trigger' for this memeplex appears to be verbal-conceptual memes expressing the sentiment of loss plus the key of G minor. Secondly, the complex may also appear in other minor keys provided that the verbal-conceptual memes are present. Thirdly, from the case of the Adagio, it can be seen that the memeplex may also appear when only the key of G minor is present, in the absence of the verbal-conceptual memes. Nevertheless, it will also be evident - given that the memeplex does not appear in the G minor 'loss' arias 'Padre, germani', 'Traurigkeit' and 'Zum Leiden' - that the first of the three conditions noted above is neces- sary but not sufficient. 7. CONCLUSION: TAKING THE 'MEME'S EYE VIEW' The following closing points should draw together the various themes considered here. First, I hope the discussion of the four Mozart pieces in Sections 2, 4 and 5 is seen as offering convincing evidence for the validity of the memetic paradigm, both as a means of understanding the nature of human culture in general, and as a specific tool for comprehending synchronic musical organization and diachronic musical style change. Secondly, I hope to have offered a different perspective on Mozart's compositional processes, showing how large-scale intertextual struc- tures may have been an important element of his approach to compo- sition, and indeed that of other composers. Thirdly, however, I hope to have suggested - yet not without a tinge 60 Ludwig Ritter von K6chel, Chronologisch-thematisches Verzeichnis sdmtlicher Tonwerke Wolfgang Amadi Mozarts, ed.

C) 00 v&lt; H z z</page><page sequence="40">THE EVOLUTION OF A 'MEMEPLEX' IN LATE MOZART 69 of regret - that taking the 'meme's eye view'61 of these pieces calls into question traditional conceptions of Mozart's conscious intentionality - and indeed, by extension, that of every composer - and at the same time illustrates how fragile are the boundaries of his works. This is because, as was implied at the end of Section 3, The self is a vast memeplex - perhaps the most insidious and pervasive memeplex of all. I shall call it the 'selfplex'. The selfplex permeates all our experience and all our thinking so that we are unable to see it clearly for what it is - a bunch of memes. It comes about because our brains provide the ideal machinery on which to construct it, and our society provides the selective environment in which it thrives.62 'If this memetic analysis is correct', Blackmore asserts, the choices you make are not made by an inner self who has free will, but are just the consequence of the replicators playing out their competition in a particular environment. In the process they create the illusion of a self who is in control.63 In a similar vein, Dennett asks 'Cui bono?', apropos of 'those cases when push comes to shove, and the interests of the body ... conflict with the interests of the genes'.64 Memetics applies the same principle to the meme and therefore motivates a model of the composer as vessel, a conception which maintains that, essentially, Mozart was the conduit through which the selfish memes he imitated and mutated passed. In short, I suggest the evidence considered here speaks, ulti- mately, for the power of the replicator over that of the vehicle, to employ Dawkins's dichotomy.65 Fourthly, as implied in Section 4, I believe that the memetic paradigm can motivate and guide a rethinking of the theory and practice of analytical musicology, leading to a reconsideration of the notion of structural value in analysis. A significant conclusion deriving from the material considered here seems to be that a replicated struc- ture common to two or more contexts should be privileged analytically, irrespective of whether elements of that structure satisfy, for instance, the Fuxian/Schenkerian voice-leading considerations (or, for that matter, the Fortean/neo-Riemannian set/group-theoretical criteria) normally imposed as conditions of structural importance in analysis. In this sense, to a consideration of Satz (the surface profile of the music and its articulation into units of structure and expression) and of Ursatz (the deep-structural products - to reverse Schenker's aeti- ology - of voice-leading processes at shallower levels of organization), analysis might profit from incorporating a sensitivity to what might be termed the Memesatz. This dimension of music might be defined as those salient intertextual structures generated and defined by repli- cation. Such a focus on replication tends automatically to emphasize 61 Blackmore, The Meme Machine, Chapter 4. 62 Ibid., 231. 63 Susan Blackmore, 'Meme, Myself, I', New Scientist, 161/2177 (1999), 40-2 (p. 42). 64 Dennett, Darwin's Dangerous Idea, 325. 65 Dawkins, The Extended Phenotype, 112.</page><page sequence="41">70 STEVEN JAN questions of perception and cognition of musical patterning, and thereby highlights those elements of the music which have the greatest reality and immediacy to the listener. Finally, as suggested in Section 6, an examination of musico-concep- tual memeplexes - those associations between memes in the purely musical realm and those in the verbal-conceptual dimension - can offer revealing hermeneutic insights into music. These rich memetic relationships may help elucidate some of music's veiled referential and connotative meanings and offer a means of unravelling the memetic threads that are the psychological motivations of the composer and the emotional responses of the listener. ABSTRACT 'Memetics', a concept most elegantly expounded by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene, asserts that human culture consists of a multitude of units trans- mitted between individuals by imitation and subject to evolutionary pressures. Such particles, 'memes', are broadly analogous to the genes of biological transmission. Four late pieces of Mozart's, including Pamina's aria 'Ach ich fiihl's' from Die Zauberfldte, are examined in terms of the meme concept and a conglomeration, or 'memeplex', consisting of seven memes is identified within them. The nature of the musical memeplex, in this specific case and also more generally, is considered, particularly from the perspective of its location at different levels of the structural hierarchy. The evolutionary history of some of Mozart's memes is examined with reference to selected passages from works of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Finally, relationships between the musical memes under investigation and memes in the verbal-conceptual realm are explored.</page></plain_text>
