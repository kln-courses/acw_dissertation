MIENIS Department of Evolution, Systematics and Ecology, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem 91904 ABSTRACT This is a final excavation report for the investigations of the late T. Noy in the site of Ziqim. Ziqim is a Pottery Neolithic site located in the southern Coastal Plain of Israel. It has been destroyed over the years by various developments. Noy's research in the early 1970's is the only documentation on these remains. The analysis includes all the available material: pottery, flint, stone tools, bone tools and the fauna (mammals, fish and shells). 73</page><page sequence="2">74 GARFINKEL et al. » Horvat 'l,Jza Tel Qishion , .. • / Snaar Nahal* • Hazorea M , Hagolan Zehora II Munhata. .

The site is about 25 m above the current sea level and slightly less than 1 km from the current seashore (Figure 3). Today the area receives some 400 mm of annual precipitation and the landscape is characterized by sand dunes. The proximity to the seashore, to the Shiqma Stream and to the long valleys east of the Kurkar ridges makes the location of the site ideal for human occupation as it enables the exploitation of various environmental niches. It is worthwhile noting that many other Neolithic sites in the coastal plain occupy similar locations (e.g., on the Kurkar ridges near the river mouths). The site was discovered by members of Kibbutz Ziqim, who over the years collected and kept an assemblage of about 1,500 flint items from the site's surface. The original size of the site is estimated as approximately 20,000 square meters, but at the beginning Figure 2: The vicinity of Ziqim and other near-by Neolithic sites.</page><page sequence="4">76 GARFINKEL et al.

The remaining part of the site at the time of the excavations comprised only a narrow strip about 5 m wide and 20 m long. In a visit to the site conducted in the year 2000 no remains at all could be located. Neolithic Ziqim is another sad example of a site completely destroyed by modern development. The late Dr. T. Noy conducted scientific investigations during the 1960's and 1970's (Figure 4). Her activities included several surface surveys, and the analysis of material in the Kibbutz collection (1519 items including 1201 tools), which formed a chapter in her Ph.D. (Noy 1975b). In the years 1974 and 1976 she directed two excavation seasons on behalf of the Israel Museum, the Department of Antiquities and the Israel Exploration Society (Figure 4) and published various preliminary reports (Noy 1975a, 1976, 1977, 1993). After her untimely death we took upon ourselves to publish this final excavation report. As we were not present during the field work our analysis is solely based on information found in the excavation files and previous publications. An area of about 40 m2. was excavated (Figure 5) using a 1 m2. grid. Four major stratigraphie units were uncovered, from top to bottom (Figures 6, 7): 1. A recent sand dune, about 10 cm thick. 2. A Neolithic occupational layer, 20-50 cm thick. 3. Sterile Hamra soil, about 40 cm thick. 4. Sterile Kurkar forming the base of the ridge. The Neolithic layer contained two phases: the upper phase lay between 7-15 cm below the surface and was poorly preserved. The lower phase was thicker (25-40 cm), better preserved and included a living floor and several features (Figures 8-13).

Three burnt horizons were found inside but hardly any associated finds. THE POTTERY ASSEMBLAGE (Y. GARFINKEL) Three main traditions characterize the Neolithic pottery of the southern Levant: Yarmukian Ware, Jericho IX Ware and Nizzanim Ware (Garfinkel 1999a). The Yarmukian Ware is the best known of all three with a number of comprehensive studies carried out on the pottery assemblages from the following sites: Munhata (Garfinkel 1992), Abu Tawwab (Obeidat 1995) and Sha'ar Hagolan (Eirikh-Rose and Garfinkel 2002). Yarmukian assemblages were found mainly in the central parts of the region. Jericho IX assemblages have a more limited distribution, usually south of the Yarmukian. The only comprehensive published report on this pottery is from the phase designated "Pottery Neolithic A" (PNA) at Jericho (Kenyon and Holland 1982, 1983). However, there are fundamental problems in the stratigraphy and typology of this assemblage (Garfinkel 1999a:69-73). The third pottery tradition, recently designated Nizzanim Ware, has a very limited geographical distribution and is confined to the southern coastal plain of Israel (Garfinkel 1999a:97 101). Only three sites from this unit are known to date: Nizzanim (Yeivin and Olami 1979), Giv'at Haparsa (Olami et al. 1977) and Ziqim. The assemblage of Nizzanim, for which the total number of sherds has not been published, includes 145 indicative items (rims, bases and handles). The report of Giv'at Haparsa presents 26 sherds in one figure without without any typological information or quantitative data (Olami et al. 1977: fig. 8).Thus, the information on the Neolithic pottery of Ziqim is a welcome contribution to the study of this poorly known archaeological entity. As already observed by Noy (1993:1528): "the pottery vessels are poorly preserved. They are made of a coarse, reddish clay and are very fragile. The vessels are handmade and rounded". Indeed, the pottery craftsmanship is of poor quality and the coarse pottery was not well fired, thus it crumbles in the hand. The excavation report and photographs indicate large fragments, however most of them have been broken now into smaller</page><page sequence="11">ZIQIM,ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 83 sherds. The typology is limited to a few simple types. Relatively thick walls characterize the vessels. Decoration of vessels is not common, and in rare instances red paint was used without incisions or burnishing, as appearing in the more or less contemporaneous Pottery Neolithic traditions of the Yarmukian and Jericho IX. Typology Typology The assemblage includes 378 sherds, which are presented in Table 1. There are 31 typologically diagnostic items, including 29 rims and two body fragments of necked jars. Six typological groups can be identified here as follows: Table 1 : The Pottery Assemblage of Ziqim. Type No % in Assemblage % in Specific Group Total sherds 378 100 Total Handles 19 5 100.0 Loop handle 12 63.1 Lug handle 4 21.1 Unclear fragments 3 15.8 Total Bases 11 3 100.0 Flat base 9 82.0 Disc base 1 9.0 Ring base 1 9.0 Rims &amp; indicatives 31 8 100.0 Deep bowl 10 32.2 Basin 1 3.2 Pot 4 13.0 Holemouth jar 11 35.4 Jar 4 13.0 Lid 1 3.2 Deep bowls (10 items, 32.2%). The medium sized deep bowl is the second most common pottery vessel at Ziqim (Figure 14:1-7). Most of the rim fragments do not bear handles, but in one case there is a small loop handle near the rim (Figure 14:1). This type of bowl is very common in other Pottery Neolithic sites in Israel. In the nearby sites of Nizzanim and Giv'at Haparsa several such bowls were found (Olami et al. 1977: fig. 8:3-6, 15-17; Yeivin and Olami 1979: figs. 16:5-7,9,11,17:6-10, 13,15;). In Yarmukian and Jericho IX sites about half of the deep bowls are decorated (Type CI in Munhata and</page><page sequence="12">84 GARFINKEL et al. T" 1 u I 1 10cm 1 Figure 14: Neolithic pottery from Ziqim: Open vessels.</page><page sequence="13">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 85 Sha'ar Hagolan typology) and the other half is undecorated (Type C2 in these sites). At Ziqim all the deep bowls are undecorated. Basin (1 item, 3.2%). One fragment was found in the assemblage from Ziqim (Figure 14:9). The basin is well known in the Pottery Neolithic period and similar items have been reported from the nearby site of Nizzanim (Yeivin and Olami 1979: fig. 16:8), as well as from other Yarmukian and Jericho IX sites (Garfinkel 1999a: figs. 19, 51). Pots (4 items, 13.0%). These are relatively large, open vessels with relatively upright walls and two lug handles near the rim (Figure 14:8). They are quite common in the Pottery Neolithic period and similar items have been reported from the nearby sites of Nizzanim and Giv'at Haparsa (Yeivin and Olami 1979: figs. 16:10, 12; 18:11; Olami et al.al. 1977: fig. 8:24-25), as well as from other Yarmukian and Jericho IX sites (Garfinkel 1999a: figs. 17, 50). Holemouth jars (11 items, 35.5%). This is the most common typological group at Ziqim (Figure 15:1-5). The Neolithic holemouth jars are characterized by two lug handles that were placed at the upper part of the vessel, near the rim (Figure 15:1). The holemouth jar was the basic vessel of the Pottery Neolithic period and was probably used for cooking. Such items were found at the nearby site of Nizzanim (Yeivin and Olami 1979: figs. 17:1-5, 18:6), as well as at other Yarmukian and Jericho IX sites (Garfinkel 1999a: figs. 31,57). Jars (4 items, 13.0%). Four jar fragments were identified in the assemblage (Figure 15:6-9). Two of them are rims and the other two are neck or body fragments (Figure 15:7,9). One item in this category is a large jar with a tall neck and two handles which extend from the neck to the shoulder (Figure 15:8). Similar items have not been reported from Nizzanim or Giv'at Haparsa, but were found in Yarmukian sites like Munhata and Sha'ar Hagolan (Garfinkel 1992: fig. 71:1-3). Jar fragments without handles have been reported from Nizzanim (Yeivin and Olami 1979: fig. 18:3-4), and are common in Yarmukian and Jericho IX sites (Garfinkel 1999a: figs. 32, 58). Lid (1 item, 3.2%). Under this category we classified a broken pottery disc of ca. 12 cm in diameter (Figure 16:1). In its center there is a rounded scar, of ca. 4 cm in diameter, indicating that something was attached there, perhaps a handle. No similar items have been reported from other Pottery Neolithic sites in the southern Levant. Handles and Bases There are 19 handles at Ziqim, which constitute 5% of the total assemblage. Two types are clearly represented: loop handles (12 items, 63% of the handles, Figure 16:3-4) and lug handles (4 items, 21% of the handles, Figures 15:1, 16:2). One of the lug handles is pierced (Figure 16:2). There are in addition three unclear handle fragments that could</page><page sequence="14">86 GARFINKEL et al. i n nrv 10cm Figure 15: Neolithic pottery from Ziqim: Closed vessels.</page><page sequence="15">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 87 C-A 'j m ' \ \ \ \ 10 Figure 16: Neolithic pottery from Ziqim: Lid, handles and bases.</page><page sequence="16">GARFINKEL et al. not be definitely classified into a specific type. When the location of the handle on the vessel is clear, there are loop handles near the rims of deep bowls (Figure 14:1) and lug handles near the rims of holemouth jars (Figure 15:1). This picture is quite similar to that of other Pottery Neolithic sites where the loop handle is the most common type and the lug handle is the second most common. These two types of handles have been reported from other Pottery Neolithic sites in the southern coastal plain such as Nizzanim and Giv'at Haparsa (Yeivin and Olami 1979: fig. 18:6-11; Olami et al. 1977: fig. 8:11-13, 24-26). In Munhata the loop handles constitute 54.9% of the handles and the lugs 36.8% (Garfinkel 1992:54. fig. 20). At Sha'ar Hagolan the loop handles constitute 65.9% of the handles and the lugs 31% (Eirikh-Rose and Garfinkel 2002). There are 11 bases at Ziqim, which constitute 3% of the total assemblage. Three types are represented: flat base (9 items, 82% of the bases, Figure 16:5-8), a disc base (1 item, 9% of the bases, Figure 16:9) and a ring base (1 item, 9% of the bases, Figure 16:10). The flat base is the most common at other Pottery Neolithic sites. Such items have been reported from the nearby sites of Nizzanim and Giv'at Haparsa (Olami et al. 1977: fig. 8:18-19, 21; Yeivin and Olami 1979: figs. 17:14, 16), and were found in large quantities in Munhata and Sha'ar Hagolan. Decoration In the Pottery Neolithic period there are three main decoration techniques: painting, incisions and burnish. In the Yarmukian Ware two of these were commonly used - painting and incisions; burnish is very rare but a few such items were found in the new excavations of Sha'ar Hagolan. In the Jericho IX Ware, the pottery was usually decorated with paint and burnish, while incision was hardly used. At Ziqim there are very few decorated sherds. About 10 items with red slip and one or two with painted red lines were counted, ca.ca. 3% of the assemblage. As the natural color of the pottery is reddish it is possible that a few other items were decorated as well but we could not make a distinction between natural hue and color. At Munhata the decorated pottery constitutes 12.8% of the assemblage (Garfinkel 1992:55) and at Sha'ar Hagolan 21 % (Eirikh-Rose and Garfinkel 2002). It is clear that at Ziqim the decoration of pottery was not commonly practiced. Conclusion In conclusion, the assemblage from Ziqim represents a simple pottery production tradition. This simplicity is evident in the following aspects: crude manufacture (thick walls, coarse surface, fragile and poor firing), simple shapes (only those common in other Neolithic sites), very low percentage of decorated pottery (only red paint without incisions or burnish). Similar pottery was found in two nearby sites: Nizzanim and Giv'at Haparsa.</page><page sequence="17">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 89 THE FLINT KNAPPING TECHNOLOGY (D. DAG) The assemblage presented here is composed of material from three different sources: 1. 1. The material from the two excavation seasons (1178 items). 2. Artifacts originating from kibbutz Ziqim collection (275 items). This is only a part of the 1519 items discussed in Noy's Ph.D. (1975b, Table 170). Efforts to locate the rest of the collection failed. 3. An amateur surface collection given to Noy during the excavation at the site (323 items). The material from this and the previous category, a total of 598 items, is presented together in the various tables. The material from all three sources shows a technological and typological uniformity. Nevertheless the two surface collections suffer from various biases both in the tools/ waste ratio, the frequency of blades and the frequencies of certain tool types (mainly arrowheads, sickle blades and awls). Therefore they were only used in a descriptive manner and the quantitative data from the excavated assemblage is presented separately. Raw materials In the vicinity of Ziqim, like in all the southern coastal plain, flint in primary geological context is not available on the surface (Buchbinder 1969). Thus most of the flint items at Ziqim were knapped from small nodules originating in the near-by riverbeds or conglomerates. Such conglomerates were not actually found but they are known from the Pleshet and Ahuzam formations. Many of the cortical items in Ziqim bear evidence not only to their derivation from small pebbles, but have a battered cortex as well. The short river systems that drain the Hebron Mountains today, are not sufficient for the formation of such cortexes. Apparently this kind of cortex was formed in much longer river systems that originated in Transjordan prior to the formation of the Jordan valley rift, that existed during the Pliocene (Horowitz 1987). These stream systems flowed over much gentler slopes, since the Hebron Mountains didn't exist. The water energy when reaching the coastal plain was very low and sufficient for transporting only very small pebbles. The lack of large size nodules affected the knapping possibilities and dictated some of the industry's characteristics. Five different kinds of raw material were identified, the first three are clearly local and the last two are probably imported: 1. Brown colored flint, often with thin yellowish or reddish veins, the flint is fine-grained, opaque and of good quality. This flint originates from Eocene age formations. 2. Gray to brown flint, very fine grained, has two subtypes; one is brown and translucent, the other is gray and opaque. This is a good quality flint but the nodules themselves are cracked and have many chalk inclusions. This flint is probably from the Mishash formation of the Campanian age.</page><page sequence="18">90 GARFINKEL et al. 3. Chert, gray to black in color flint, opaque and coarse grained. This is a very poor quality flint both in terms of the flint and in terms of the nodules, which are cracked and have chalky inclusions (so it might also belong to the Mishash formation). 4. Tabular flint, brown in color, in very thin tablets, 4-7 mm thick. This is a fine quality flint of the Eocene age. It is found only in very small quantities and was used only for the production of a special type of knife. No waste of this flint was found. Thus the tools were probably imported to the site as complete tools. 5. Purple colored, very fine-grained flint, its source unknown and it is found only in very small quantities (heat treated?). Many of the flint items were covered in white patina, which makes it impossible to identify the raw material. In some cases when the raw material was still identifiable or in cases of fresh breaks the raw material turned out to be from the Mishash formation. However, the patinated items were not classified as belonging to the Mishash formation. The different patterns of patina formation on different kinds of raw material is an interesting phenomenon, but it lies beyond the scope of this paper. The relative frequencies of the flint types are presented in Table 2. The majority of the items were produced of local flint. Only 10 items (less than 3%) were imported to the site. The Eocene flint, which is the better quality flint, is also the most abundant one. Campanian flint is also present in significant quantities. The other types of flint were used infrequently.

The relative frequencies as well as the relative proportion by weight are presented in Table 3. All waste categories are present, testifying to the local character of flint knapping. The industry is flake oriented, with a ratio of little more than four flakes to one blade (in the excavated assemblage). For comparison, at the nearby PPNC site of Ashkelon the ratio is about four flakes per blade (Garfinkel and Dag 2001) and at Lod the ratio is about 10 flakes per blade (Blockman 1997). The relative frequency of tools is high and the relative frequency of debris is low, this testifies partly to the quality of the collection (probably only part of the sediment was screened) and partly to the high intensity of flint use. Cores comprise less than two percent of the assemblage, with a ratio of about 60 items per core, of which eight are tools and two are core-trimming elements. The composition of the assemblage of Ziqim is not very different from that of other Neolithic sites in the region. Table 3: Waste Categories Frequencies.

Four main points were observed:</page><page sequence="20">92 GARFINKEL et al. 1. Chips and bladelets weigh less than other categories while cores and chunks weigh more. 2. Cortical items weigh more than non-cortical items, which means a decrease in item size along the reduction sequence. 3. Flakes are heavier on average than blades. When examining the relative frequency of broken items in each category, it turned out that almost 90% of the blades were broken while only 60% of the flakes were broken. Thus, the differences in weight represent the different breakage patterns. 4. Tools and items with usewear weigh more than flakes, blades and even more than primary elements or core trimming elements. This is probably connected with the process of blank selection (see below). The Cores Twenty four cores of seven different core-types were found; 22 in the excavation and 2 in the surface collections. The relative frequencies of the different types are presented in Table 4. The high number of types in such a small sample of cores testifies to the non standardization of the production methods. The seven core-types are derived from using three basic methods. The most frequent one (19 cores) is the production of small flakes from one striking platform, until the platform is exhausted. Then the striking platform is replaced by another platform. The number and directions of platforms changes, dictate the final type of the core: whether with one striking platform (Figure 17:1,3), two diagonal platforms, two opposed platforms (Figure 17:2), multiple platform core (Figure 17:4) or amorphic core. Knapping was preformed from a single platform at a time. All the cores were exhausted, one core, which was not exhausted was found burnt. Table 4: Core Types Frequencies.

The second method of production is by shaping a ridge around the core and bifacially removing flakes from it. The result is a discoidal flat core with a circumferential ridge. Two such cores were found at Ziqim. They are both still exploitable and both were used as hammerstones after their exploitation as cores (Figure 18). The third method of production is by removing small flakes from both the dorsal and the ventral faces of a large flake. Three cores on flakes were found. Most of the cores in the assemblage are exhausted, with the maximal length shorter than 45 mm and the weight under 50 gr. In many cases the usefulness of the last stages of knapping is doubtful, since it could only result in the production of small chips. From the whole assemblage only three cores were still exploitable, two of which were discoidal cores that were used also as hammerstones (Figure 18). One was burnt. This attests to the difficulty in raw material procurement in the vicinity of Ziqim. Despite the exhausted condition of most of the cores, 17 of them still retained some cortex. In ten cases the cortex covers less than 20% of the core's surface, in six cases it covers less than 40% of the surface and in one case it covers 50% of the surface. Only in two cases is the cortex fresh, in all the other cases the cortex is battered, evidence of the intensive use of river pebbles. In some cases the convexity of the cortex enables evaluation of the original pebble size. In all these cases, the pebble was a small one, 5-7 cm long. The number of scars is on average 11.5 scars per core. There is an association between the type of core and the number of scars, amorphic and discoidal cores have more scars (17 and 19 on average) and cores on flakes have less scars (5 on average). There is also an association between the number of scars and the size of the core, with large cores having more scars than smaller cores. The last scar on 22 of the cores was found to be a flake scar and only on two cores the last scar was a blade/bladelet scar. This creates a ratio of 11:1 flakes to blades, however a ratio of 4:1 flakes to blades was found in the entire assemblage. Thus, either some blades were imported to the site or that in the first stages of exploitation, more cores were used for the production of blades. Core Trimming Elements (CTE) Items resulting from core reshaping were defined as CTE. Fifty-four such artifacts were found, 38 in the excavation and 16 in the collection. The relative frequencies of the different types of CTE are presented in Table 5. The relative frequency of CTE relating to blade production (ridge blades and core tablets) is low. Even when items were defined as such, their shape was not usually the "classical" shape of blade production CTE (Figure 32:5). More abundant are items with the remains of a previous striking platform, either on the distal end (overpass) (Figure 32:2,4,6) or on one of the lateral ends. These items were removed in order to fix the geometry of the core after the changing of a striking</page><page sequence="23">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 95 0 2cm ■■■EZHZZl Figure 18: Core/Hammerstone. Figure 18: Core/Hammerstone. platform, and they attest to the frequent rotation of the cores. Another frequent type of CTE is the one used to regulate the flaking surface and enable its continued exploitation. This was achieved by removing high topographies (11 items), hinges (8 items), or chalk inclusions (1 item). Table 5: CTE Types Frequencies.

Most of the CTE are removed after at least one stage of production. Thus it is not surprising that only 2 items show the remains of cortex that covered more than 20% of the surface. Conclusions Technologically the flint assemblage of Ziqim is very simple. The common raw material is local, the quality is variable and the nodules are usually small (5-7 cm). The reduction sequence involves mainly the production of flakes from one striking platform core that was rotated according to the need. The maintenance of such cores is very limited, no initial stage of decortication is preformed (since it would waste too much of the raw material). The shaping of the striking platform is usually carried out by removing one large flake. The rotation of the core is accompanied by a removal of CTE that regulates either the new striking platform or the new flaking surface. Other exploitation methods like discoidal cores, were applied on a much smaller scale. Some of the material found at Ziqim (e.g., tabular flint) was imported, probably from the Negev. This is supplementary evidence for a long distance network, further attested to by a shell from the Red Sea (Mienis, this report). THE FLINT TOOLS The tool assemblage consists of 425 items, of which 152 are from the excavation and 273 from surface collections. The relative frequencies of the different types are presented in Table 6. The most frequent types are retouched items, perforators, arrowheads and sickle blades. Also notable is the very low frequency of bifacial tools, and relative to other sites, also of arrowheads. Arrowheads: Forty-five arrowheads were found, only five from the excavation and the rest from the surface collections. The following types were identified: Amuq, Byblos, Herzliya, Haparsa and Nizzanim (Table 7; Bar-Yosef 1981; Burian and Friedman 1979; Gopher 1994). The majority (about 60%) are small (Figures 19-20), with Haparsa and Nizzanim types dominating. The rest are large arrowheads of the Byblos and Amuq types (Figure 21). Given the small size of the excavated sample, there seemed no point in further investigating here the length and typology of the arrowheads from Ziqim. The arrowheads were shaped by a very elaborate pressure retouch creating a longitudinal ridge on the middle of the dorsal face. In cases where the blank had parallel sides and a central ridge (4 cases, Figure 21:3), it was hardly retouched. The retouch was necessary to mask the irregular shape of the blank. The ventral face was also retouched but in a much less</page><page sequence="25">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 97 Table 6: Tool Types Frequencies.

The shaping is also very casual, the style of the tool, the tip, the tang and the proportions between the three parts of the tool vary between arrowheads. This lack of standardization in one of the most elaborate tool types is a main characteristic of the entire industry of Ziqim. Three arrowheads exhibited some remains of cortex (less than 20%), on two arrowheads there was a burin scar from the distal direction, maybe the result of impact. Sickle blades: Forty-one sickle blades were found, 17 in the excavation and 24 in the surface collection. Forty of them are coarsely denticulated and the last one is finely denticulated with pressure retouch (type A in Jericho). The sickle blades were divided into a number of subtypes according to the shaping of the opposite side to the denticulation. 1. 1. Sickle blades denticulated on both sides (10 items). Both sides have gloss on them. They were probably rehafted and not used as threshing knives (Figures 22:10, 23: 1-3). 2. Retouched sickle blades (3 items, Figure 22:6,7,9). 3. Pressure retouched sickle blades (Type B in Jericho, 6 items, Figure 23:4-8). 4. Backed sickle blades (5 items, Figure 22:8). 5. Plain sickle blades (17 items, Figure 22:1-5). Most of the sickle blades were found broken distally or proximally. The intact ends were sometimes truncated by a straight truncation (9 proximal and 12 distal) or left in their natural condition (3 proximal and 5 distal ends). The denticulation itself was shaped by bifacial pressure retouch. In most cases the notches were shaped on the distal face, and from each notch a single (or sometimes more) small chip was removed from the ventral face. Of 51 denticulated sides, only in three cases was the shaping made by retouch on one face, in two cases by ventral retouch and in one case by dorsal retouch. The blanks used for the preparation of the sickle blades are not uniform, both in dimensions and in the scar pattern on the dorsal face. The density and depth of notches also differ from one tool to another. The lack of standardization is surprising because several sickle blades are needed for the manufacture of one sickle. Whereas a different depth of hafting could compensate for the dimensions of the blank, the different active edge must have meant hafting in different tools. All sickle blades showed evidence of use in the form of gloss. In nine cases the gloss covered only the tip of the denticulation, in 33 cases the gloss covered a little bit more then the denticulated part and in 8 cases it covered half or more of the blades' width. This probably results from two factors, the first is the intensity of use and the other is the pattern of hafting. Both the right and the left side of the blades were denticulated, indicating that there was no preferred direction for hafting. Perforators: One hundred perforators were found, 13 in the excavation and 87 in the surface collection (Figure 24). They include several types: 1. Awls (83 items, Figure 24:1-10).</page><page sequence="30">102 GARFINKEL et al. 8 Figure 22: Sickle Blades.</page><page sequence="31">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 103 0 2cm 8 Figure 23: Sickle Blades.</page><page sequence="32">104 GARFINKEL et al. 8 9 10 11 0 2cm Figure 24: Perforators.</page><page sequence="33">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 105 2. Massive Awls (2 items, Figure 24:12). 3. Multiple Awls (11 items, Figure 24:11). 4. Borers (4 items, Figure 24:13-16). The perforators were made on relatively small items, except for the two massive ones, (the average weight is less than 1.75 gr compared to 7 gr for the entire tools). The blanks used are flakes (32 items), blades (28 items), bladelets (30 items), chips (5 items) and CTE (3 items). The active edge was usually shaped on the distal end (83 items), but also on the lateral (16 items) and proximal (12 cases, most of them multiple awls) ends. The point was shaped by two elongated notches (57 items), by one notch and retouch (30 items), by two straight retouches (20 cases including the 4 borers), or by break and retouch (4 items). Borers were shaped by bifacial, very regular retouch that created an elongated narrow and triangular or trapeze cross section. The perforators are an exceptional group in terms of raw material. Most of the awls are made on flint from the Mishash formation contra the general trend in the assemblage. Bifacial Tools: Six bifacial tools were found, one in the excavation and five in the collection, they include: 1. Two axes, one made of limestone, shaped as an elongated triangle. The shaping is only marginal and does not penetrate deep into the face of the tool. The tool is probably made on a flake and the active edge is polished (Figure 25:2). The second axe was found in the excavation and is a narrow pointed fragment. It is asymmetric and the shaping creates hinges and steps. The item is polished in the center (Figure 25:4). 2. Two adzes with an elongated trapeze shape. The active edge is the narrow side of the trapeze. One of them is made on a flake, and both are shaped by very steep removals on one face and very flat ones on the other face (Figure 25:1,3). 3. Two chisels shaped by a very intensive pressure retouch. Both items were made on blades and have a lens-like cross section (Figure 26). Knives: Eight knives were found, two in the excavation and six in the surface collections. Tabular flint knives, (6 items, Figures 27, 28:1,4) are made on imported raw material, from thin tabular flint (4-7 mm), with cortex on both sides. The flint is broken, either naturally or on purpose, from three sides. The forth side is shaped by pressure flaking, for a long sharp active edge. On one tool two sides are shaped (Figure 27:1). The general shape of the tool is rectangular. In one case, one side of the cortex shows evidence of polish (Figure 27:4). Cortical knives, (2 items, Figure 28:2-3) are similar to the tabular knives in the general shape of a long active edge shaped by bifacial pressure flaking. The difference lies in the raw material. These tools are made on the local raw material, on long cortical blades. Except for these two kinds of knives, a third type was described by Noy (1975b: fig.</page><page sequence="34">106 GARFINKEL et al. 0 2cm Figure 25: Axes and Adzes. 58:5,7). These are long blades shaped to a lens cross-section by bifacial pressure flaking. The current location of these items is unknown (Figure 29). Scrapers: Ten scrapers were found, six in the excavation and four in the surface collections. They were divided into several types: 1. Pressure retouched end scrapers, very regularly shaped to a circular active edge (2 items, Figure 30:2,5). 2. End scrapers with a round active edge shaped by invasive retouch (2 items, Figure 30:1). 3. Ventral scraper shaped by invasive retouch on the ventral face (1 item). 4. Butt scraper with a round active edge shaped by invasive retouch on the proximal end (1 item). 5. Denticulate scrapers, shaped by non-regular invasive retouch that creates a roughly</page><page sequence="35">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT ] 07 0 2cm ~Z2 Figure 26: Chisels. denticulated active edge (4 items, Figure 30:6,7). In two cases the retouch covered the whole tool except for the proximal end. The scrapers are relatively massive tools (20 gr on average compared to about 7 gr for the tools) they are made on flakes (5 items) or CTE (2 items). Since most of the waste items are too small to serve as blanks for scrapers, mostly cortical items were used. The weight of 6 scrapers exceeds 10 gr and five of them are made on cortical items. This attests to the relative difficulty of producing large items from the local raw material. Notches: Eighteen notches were found, ten in the excavation and eight in the surface collections. They are made on various blanks: flakes (9 items) blades/bladelets (7 items) CTE (1 item) and chunk (1 item). About half of the tools have multiple notches (10 items) and the other half had a single notch (9 items). Most of the notches are shaped on the dorsal face (19 items) but there are also ventral ones (7 items) and a bifacial (1 item).</page><page sequence="36">108 GARFINKEL et al.

Most of the notches are lateral (24 items) but there are also distal ones (3 items). The notches are shaped with various retouch types, from fine retouch to abrupt retouch. Denticulates: Nine denticulates were found, six in the excavation and three in the surface collections. They form two groups: 1. 1. Fine denticulates (4 items) with very regular denticulation made on blades. One of them is retouched on the opposite side. They are shaped by regular retouch on the dorsal face. 2. Rough denticulates (5 items) shaped by rough and not regular denticulation, they are made on massive items (3 flakes and 1 blade) three of them cortical (Figure 31:7). In five cases the denticulation was made on the right side of the tool in one case on the left side and in another on both sides. There is a very clear preference for the right side, the reason for which, is unknown. Most of the denticulation is on the dorsal face (7 items) and the minority is on the ventral face (2 items). Burins: Eight burins were found, five in the excavation and three in the surface collections. They form four groups: 1. Burins on natural surface (2 items). In this group the burin was removed without any preparation, in one case the natural surface is the striking platform of a CTE, in the other case the burin is transversely removed from the distal edge of a small flake. 2. Burins on break (4 items, Figure 31:3). In this group the burin was removed from a naturally broken blade. In three cases the break was prepared by slight retouch. 3. Dihedral burins (2 items, Figure 31:1). In this group the burin was shaped by two removals on the distal end of the blank. In one case the removals created a sharp angle and in the other case a 90° angle. 4. Noy (1975b) reported one burin on a truncation, its current location is unknown (Figure 31:2). Retouched Items: 102 retouched items were found (Figure 31:5,6,8); 54 in the excavation and 48 in the surface collections. There are various blanks retouched by various types of retouch in different locations. Table 8 presents some features of the retouched items. According to the blanks, some phenomena are noticeable: The frequency of burnt items is very low. Broken blades/bladelets are much more abundant than broken flakes. The average weight of flakes and blades is similar, but since this weight includes broken items, originally the blades were larger than the flakes. Cortex is more frequent on flakes than on blades. Most of the items are retouched on one side only, without any left/right preference. Distal or proximal retouch is very rare. The dominant retouch is on the dorsal face though ventral and alternate retouch are found as well. Flakes and blades/bladelets differ in the types of retouch. Fine retouch is more abundant on blades, and pressure retouch is found only on blades and not on flakes.</page><page sequence="41">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 1 13 8 Figure 31 : Burins, pièce esquillée, Retouched Items and a Denticulate.</page><page sequence="42">114 GARFINKEL et al.

Two of the truncations are made on flakes, 2 on bladelets and one on a chip. All of them are made of Mishash formation flint. They are shaped by abrupt retouch and the forms are straight (2), oblique (1), convex (1), or concave (1). Pièces esquillées: Twelve pièces esquillées were found, ten in the excavation and</page><page sequence="43">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 1 ] 5 two in the surface collections (Figure 31:4). This tool type is exceptional because the shaping is not due to retouch but is a consequence of use. The tools are made on small flakes, rectangular or square in shape. The pounding action created scars on both the dorsal and the ventral faces (in two cases the scars were on the dorsal face only), in five cases the pounding was parallel to the direction of the removal of the flake, and in four cases the use was both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of removals. In three cases the pounding was so intensive that it obscured the direction of removal. In no instance was use only perpendicular to the removal axes, and transverse scars are always later than longitudinal ones. This reflects a preference in the direction of use, probably because the striking platform forms a convenient place for pounding. Multiple tools: Fourteen multiple tools were found, three in the excavation and 11 in the surface collections. These are not cases where two types were used at the same time, but rather when one tool went out of use, another tool was shaped on the same blank. Thus there is not a fixed combination of types. A used tool was simply put back into the pool of available blanks. In most cases a retouched item was shaped to form a different tool, such as a scraper, a denticulate or a notch. Three cases of simultaneous use are three retouched and truncated items. Varia: Sixteen tools were defined as varia, four in the excavation and 12 in the surface collections. Most of them are unique specimens which makes it more difficult to determine their relation to the excavated assemblage. They include: 1) Three broken blades with strangulated notches. 2) Two long items with triangular cross section retouched on each of the three corners (one found in the excavation). 3) Two large flakes with bifacial flaking on some of the circumference (both found in the excavation). 4) One item with a very regular pressure retouch along its circumference (Figure 32:1). 5) A very regularly denticulated blade made of limestone (found in the excavation). 6) A broken item made of non-local, black flint. The item has a thick elliptical section, and is shaped in a roughly anthropomorphic shape, by bifacial flaking (Figure 32:3). 7) Seven broken items with retouch or flaking that are later than the removals of the items, but their fragmentary condition does not enable their classification. Items with usewear: Thirty-one items with usewear/edge damage were found, 13 in the excavation and 18 in the collection. Some of them show retouch shorter than 10 mm and some have very irregular retouch. The blanks are flakes (12), blades (13), bladelets (4), CTE (1) and one fragment. Several of them were probably used, but others might result from post-depositional processes.</page><page sequence="44">116 GARFINKEL et al.

From the first part of that millennium the PPNC site of Ashkelon was studied (Garfinkel and Dag 2001 ; Perrot and Gopher 1996). From the second part of that millennium the Pottery Neolithic sites of Nizzanim, Giv'at Haparsa and Ziqim were investigated (Burian and Friedman 1961; Olami et al. 1973; Yeivin and Olami 1979). All these sites, earlier as later, show a very close resemblance to that of Ziqim. This is evident both in the presence of specific types, like tabular knives and pièce esquillée, and in more general trends like the scarcity of bifacial tools, the relative abundance of sickle blades, arrowheads and perforators, and the common ad hoc appearance of most of the tools. Thus, the introduction of pottery did not have significant effect on the composition of the flint assemblages in this region. BLANK SELECTION Raw material The raw material used for different artifact types was compared. The analysis of the connection between the use of Eocene/Campanian flint, was conducted on types with sample sizes greater than 20. The results are presented in Table 9. In all the types Eocene flint is the most frequent one. Exceptions are the perforators and the retouched items. The perforators are made mostly on Mishash formation flint. The retouched items are made more frequently on Eocene flint. Tabular flint was used for the knives only. Surprisingly purple flint did not portray any special use, in spite of its good quality and the fact that it is not local. Table 9: Eocene and Campanian Flint Frequencies.

Size (by weight) A comparison between the weight of waste and the weight of tools (excluding nodule tools) was made. The results are presented in Table 10. The general trend is that there is a selection of large items for the production of tools. Actually when examined according to tool type, the picture is more complicated. For some types (scrapers, notches and denticulates, retouched items, usewear and varia) there is a selection of larger blanks, mainly primary elements and CTE. They dramatically contribute to the trend shown in Table 10. Other types, like arrowheads, sickle blades and perforators are made on blanks smaller than the tool average, and similar to the average in the waste, which means that there is no selection of size.

There is a clear preference of blades and bladelets over primary elements and flakes for the production of tools. Here too, when considered according to tool type, the picture is more complicated. Arrowheads and sickle blades were made almost exclusively on blades, scrapers were not made on blades at all and 40% of them were made on primary elements. In some types like perforators, denticulates, notches, pièces esquillées and truncations, the blank distribution is very similar to the waste. Retouched items and usewear are more similar to the tools. Cortex As shown in Table 11 cortical items were not preferable. This rejection is more acute in types like arrowheads, sickle blades and perforators, while other types show less evident selection. Between 10-15% of the retouched items and the notches are made on cortical blanks. Some types, like denticulates and pièces esquillées, show no selection at all. The only type with positive selection of cortical blanks is the scraper with about 40% of cortical blanks. This is probably related to the required blank size. Conclusions The comparison of the tools to the waste assemblages of Ziqim reveals that except for cores, chips and chunks, every blank was considered by the knappers as having some potential to be selected for a tool. No characteristic was considered a-priori as preventing a blank from becoming a tool. All aspects checked (raw material, size, blank and cortex) were found to have meaning for the knapper. In each type of tool a different aspect was considered crucial and the blank was selected according to that aspect. In the perforators there is selection of raw material without selection of blanks, in the scrapers there is selection of size, which sometimes meant using a cortical item, in the arrowheads and sickle blades there is a selection of blades without selection of raw material. The picture is not of an ideal blank to which the entire reduction sequence is oriented and from which most tools are made. Rather, the entire waste assemblage was considered as a pool of blanks, from which specific items were selected. GROUND STONE AND BONE ARTIFACTS Ground stone artifacts (D.

It is about 70 mm in diameter (estimated from the available fragment) and 20 mm in height (Wright 1992, Type 28; Figure 33:1).</page><page sequence="49">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 121 4) From sq. E2: A handstone made of coarse grained Kurkar. The dimensions are 73 mm in diameter and 22 mm in height (Wright 1992, Type 28). The surface is not very smooth due to the character of the raw material, (Figure 33:2). 5) Without context: A handstone fragment made of Kurkar. The shape is square (Wright 1992 Type 52). The dimensions are 65x65x18 mm (Figure 33:3). 6) From sq. D2: A weight fragment made of limestone, circular in shape with two depressions one on each side. Because of the fragmentary condition there is no way of knowing if it was completely perforated or not. The outer surface was shaped by both flaking and grinding. The dimensions are 99 mm in diameter and 52 in height (Figure 33:6). 7) From sq. E2: A part of a flat disc made of limestone and measuring about 40-50 mm in diameter and 7 mm in height. 8) From sq. C2: A rim of a flat bowl made of sandstone, though its fragmentary condition prevents a typological definition. At Ziqim, as at other coastal plain sites, heavy stone tools are absent. Grinding slabs, mortars and pestles are absent from the assemblages of Nizzanim (Yeivin and Olami 1979) Giv'at Haparsa (Olami et al. 1977) and Ashkelon (personal observations). These heavy implements are assumed to have been used for processing plant foods, mainly cereals. This stands in contradiction to the high number of sickle blades discovered at the same sites. There are a few possible explanations for this phenomenon; either the harvested cereals were processed in ways other than grinding, or the sickle blades were used for harvesting non-edible plants like reeds etc. Bone artifacts (L.K. Horwitz) A total of seven worked bones were found at Ziqim. They include three spatula fragments, one awl and three bone points. 1) From sq. 12: An awl manufactured on the shaft of a medium-sized mammal long bone, either a tibia or a metapodial. The shaft appears to have been complete until close to the point where it has been halved in order to form a point (Figure 34:1). 2) From the general context of the site: A small worked fragment probably representing the smoothed side of a halved long bone shaft, from a bone point (Figure 34:2). 3) From sq. H2: An almost complete bone point manufactured on a halved medium sized mammal bone shaft. The sides have been smoothed and rounded off, the tip is broken but would have been shaped like an inverted "V" (Figure 34:3). 4) From sq. E2: This is a bone point made on a halved long bone of a medium-sized mammal (sheep/goat/pig size). The sides of the long bone have been smoothed (Figure 34:4). 5) From sq. E3: Fragment of a spatula, possibly with a pointed end. It has been</page><page sequence="50">122 GARFINKEL et al. ■'d; Figure 34: Bone Tools. manufactured on a fragment of bone from a large mammal (cattle size) - possibly a rib (Figure 34:5). 6) From sq. Il: A spatula on a large mammalian bone, probably a rib. 7) From sq. 12: A small fragment of a spatula made on a rib that has been smoothed on both aspects. A similar repertoire of worked bones is reported from the nearby Neolithic site of Ashkelon (Perrot and Gopher 1996). Here eight bone tools were found; six points, one polished fragment of bovid rib (a spatula ?) and a grater made on a pig jaw. MAMMALS (L.K. HORWITZ) A total of 208 bones were recovered from the site of which the majority (N=121) were unidentifiable fragments. The remaining 87 bones proved to be identifiable to species and bone element, representing a total of seven species (Table 12).</page><page sequence="51">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT \ 23 Table 12: Mammal species represented at Ziqim Ashkelon and Qatif Y2.

X = present. Methods The species present at the site are presented as the total number of identifiable bones per species (N) as well as a percentage of the total number of bones identified (%). Distinction between sheep and goats followed morphometrical features given in Boessneck (1969) and Prummel and Frisch (1986). However, most bones were indistinguishable and the remains were placed in a combined sheep/goat category. Animals were aged with reference to bone fusion stages, dental eruption rates (Silver 1969) and dental attrition (Payne 1973). Measurements follow von den Driesch (1976). Bone elements were re-grouped into five categories following Horwitz (1988). General Results The NISP counts and relative frequencies of the different species at the site are presented in Table 12. Sheep and goat are both represented, with sheep slightly more common. Together, these animals clearly dominate the assemblage, comprising over 60% of</page><page sequence="52">124 GARFINKEL et al. identifiable bones. In the absence of complete bones that could be measured, the domestic status of the goats was determined by the morphology and overall size of a male horncore, which shows the characteristic torsion and rounded cross-section of domestic goats. This horn has been severed along the skull suture of the frontal bone during butchery. The sheep bones are assumed to represent domesticates, as this species was introduced into the region in the late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B as a domestic animal (Horwitz and Ducos 1998). Examination of bone fusion for sheep/goat attests to a peak cull of animals under 12 months of age, while a high number of animals survived into adulthood. Following the model for caprine mortality given by Payne (1973), this pattern may represent the culling of surplus immature males for meat, while the females were maintained into adulthood for breeding and/or the exploitation of secondary products. Dental attrition data documents the presence of one animal aged 2-6 months (Payne stage B), another 2-3 years old (Payne stage E). In terms of body part breakdown for sheep/goats, elements from all categories are represented indicating on-site butchery and/or consumption of whole animals. Cranial remains are the most frequently represented followed by fore and hindlimbs, while feet and trunk elements are rare. The second most frequent species in the assemblage is cattle (30%). Comparison of their measurements with those from the PPNC site of Atlit Yam which may represent early domestic cattle (Ducos and Horwitz 1998), shows that the Ziqim animals are smaller as can be expected if they represent domesticates (Table 13). Ducos (1968) and Perrot and Gopher (1996) note that the cattle at Ashkelon include individuals that are extremely large, and may represent aurochs. Unfortunately, no comparable bones from Ashkelon and Ziqim could be measured, but as shown in Table 13, aside from one bone which may represent a large male or auroch, the metrical parameters of the Ashkelon cattle are also smaller than those from Atlit Yam. This may indicate that, as at Ziqim, the cattle from this site also represent domesticates. However, it cannot be excluded that as cattle are markedly dimorphic, these size differences may reflect the sex breakdown of cattle represented at each site (smaller = more females; larger = males). In the absence of larger sample sizes, these results need to be interpreted with caution. Age data for the Ziqim cattle demonstrates the presence of at least one juvenile aged less than three years old. Body part breakdown for this species indicates that bone elements from all five categories are present. Such a pattern can only occur if whole animals are brought to the site. Two cattle bones, a pelvis acetabulum and a scapula, are burnt. Pigs are poorly represented at Ziqim, and comprise only 6% of the total assemblage. In the absence of measurable bones, it cannot be concluded if they represent domestic pig or wild boar, as domesticates tend to be smaller (Payne and Bull 1988). At least one animal is immature and aged less than 12 months old. Pig is represented in the sample by hindlimbs and trunk elements.</page><page sequence="53">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 125 Table 13: Comparison of Bone Measurements of Cattle from Ziqim, Ashkelon and Atlit Yam (all measurements in mm).

If we assume that the cattle and pig remains at the site represent domestic animals, then hunting of terrestrial fauna was of negligible importance at Ziqim. This is attested to by the low numbers of wild species - gazelle, fox and tortoise (Table 12). The presence of fragments of ostrich eggshell may reflect the exploitation of ostriches (Struthio camelus) who inhabited the Negev and Mediterranean coastal dunes into historical times (Paz 1987). Specific Locations Some of the bones from Ziqim could be assigned to specific context in the site. Those bones which could be assigned are described below following this division (the rest are from the general Neolithic layer). No marked differences were observed between contexts, but this may be a result of the small sample sizes involved.</page><page sequence="54">126 GARFINKEL et al. Surface Surface (recent sand dune): Only 8 bones were found in this layer, 2 of which were bleached. The 6 identifiable bones were: 4 sheep/goat teeth (which are bleached), an immature pig scapula and a horncore of a juvenile, male mountain gazelle (horncore basal length = 12.2; breadth 10.4). It is unclear if the remains from this layer are recent in origin or represent the upper-most layer of the archaeological deposit. Upper Upper Neolithic Phase: A total of 11 bones were recovered from this layer of which 5 were unidentifiable splinters, two of which were burnt. The majority of identifiable bones were those of sheep/goat (1 vertebra, 1 metapodial, 1 pelvis, 1 scapula, 1 third molar), the only other species represented being cattle (N=l). In addition a bone point was recovered in this layer in Sq. H2 (see section on worked bone). In the Lower Neolithic Phase several bones were found: Locus Locus I: A total of 34 bones were found in this pit, 18 of which were fragments, one was a pig tooth, two cattle ribs and 13 sheep/goat (6 teeth, 3 jaws, 2 femora, 1 humerus and 1 pelvis). Locus Locus XII: A total of 18 bones were found in this pit, 12 of which were fragments, 1 cattle ulnar and 5 sheep/goat (2 teeth, 1 rib, 1 radius and 1 zygoma) Floor:Floor: Only 10 bones were found on the floor. Of these only 1 was identifiable - a cattle scaphoid bone. One of the unidentified splinters was burnt. Layer:Layer: This being a general context contained the largest number of bones, a total of 127 bones, of which 75 are fragments. The rest are sheep/goat 26, cattle 21, pig 3, fox 1 and tortoise 1. Discussion As illustrated in Table 12, the Ziqim mammalian assemblage was compared to that derived from two other Neolithic sites situated on the Mediterranean coast in close proximity - Ashkelon (Ducos 1968; Grigson 1995; Perrot and Gopher 1996) and Qatif Y3 (Grigson 1984, 1995). Despite differences in sample size (Table 12), the three sites closely resemble each other in the range of species represented. Moreover, in all sites the animal economy was based on four species; sheep, goat, cattle and pig (all apparently domesticated) which together comprise over 85% of identified bones in each assemblage. In this feature they closely resemble the largest Yarmukian faunal assemblage analyzed from the region to date, from the site of 'Ain Ghazal, Jordan (Rollefson el al. 1993). Unfortunately, in the absence of sufficient data on age and sex of the animals culled it is difficult to provide conclusive evidence concerning management strategies for any of these herds. Aside from meat production, secondary products (milk, wool, hair) could have been exploited, but the extent and nature of this activity is as yet unclear. Wild terrestrial animals played a minor role in the animal economy of all these sites.</page><page sequence="55">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 127 However, if as for Ziqim, sea fish and edible marine molluscs are included in the dietary base, then wild fauna rival terrestrial species in importance as sources of animal protein. The relative contribution of agricultural products in this period is unfortunately not known. There is however marked inter-site variation in the relative proportion of the different species at the three sites shown in Table 12, which does not appear to be related to differences in sample size. At Ziqim, sheep are more common than at the other two sites, while goats are represented in all three in similar quantities. When combined, remains of sheep/goat are equally represented (34%) at Ashkelon and Qatif Y2 (these being the smallest and largest samples) but constitute almost double that at Ziqim (61%). Further differences are observed for pigs which are clearly most abundant at Qatif Y3, and least at Ziqim. Based on the cattle bone counts (N=15) given in Grigson (1995: Table 1) as opposed to those (N=8) given in Ducos (1968), this species is present in significantly higher frequencies at Ashkelon than at Ziqim and Qatif Y3. Small differences are observed between the sites when equids, carnivores and wild fauna are included. As the relative frequencies of species is not consistent between sites with small bone samples (Ziqim and Ashkelon) versus the larger sized assemblage (Qatif Y2), it is unlikely that the observed differences can simply be ascribed to sample size. Inter-site differences are further illustrated by the inter-site variation in mollusc species present in the Ashkelon assemblage (Perrot and Gopher 1996) relative to that from Ziqim (Mienis, this report). This, despite the fact that both sites are situated in close proximity to each other and that both contain local Mediterranean shells and imported Red Sea shells. Similarly, despite the fact that all three sites would have been situated some distance from the sea during the late Neolithic period, sea fishes are very common at Ziqim (Lernau, this report) and Ashkelon (in the excavations conducted there by Garfinkel, an assemblage of 784 fish bones was discovered, Lernau personal observation), but rare at Qatif Y3 (although sieving was employed at this site). It is possible that the presence of an estuary at Ziqim may have facilitated fishing at this site and would account for their high numbers in the assemblage. At this stage of research into late Neolithic economic systems, it is unclear whether the inter-site variation reported here reflects differences in regional economies, local environments or cultural differences between sites. As the three sites discussed here are situated within close proximity to each other (on a regional scale), it seems most likely that the observed faunal variation reflects local environmental conditions and the micro habitats available within the immediate environs of each site.</page><page sequence="56">128 GARFINKEL et al. FISH (O. LERNAU) The small excavated area yielded 154 fish bones. This modest assemblage allows at the most only qualitative considerations. The purpose of this report is to describe the identified bones and to assess their significance to the economy of the site. Materials and Methods Fish bones were retrieved by hand collection and sieving. The bones were brittle and crumbling, with a calcareous crust which was difficult to remove. Eighty-six bones and fragments, which were found together in sq. Dl, were embedded by the excavators in glue, among them several groups of adjoining vertebrae. The bones were cleaned and identified using a reference collection of bones of recent fish. The degree of certainty was assessed for each identification ("definitive" or "compatible with"). Bones with an ambiguous or questionable identification were excluded from this report (Lernau 1996). Names of skeletal elements followed Wheeler and Jones (1989). Taxonomic nomenclature and details about species followed Nelson (1994), Whitehead et al. (1986) and Golani (1997). A digital Mitutoyo caliper with a precision of 0.1 mm was used to measure the bones. These measurements were taken between standard anatomical landmarks, mostly according to Morales and Rosenlund (1979), and were used to estimate the standard lengths of the fish to which the bones belonged. One has to bear in mind that these estimations are based on several poorly controlled variables and, although they are given in exact numbers, they should be regarded as crude approximations only. Results There were 97 recognizable skeletal elements among the 154 bones. The rest were mainly elongated fragments, which could be segments of spines, vertebrae or other bones. It was possible to identify 51 bones (52% of the recognizable skeletal elements). They belonged to 3 families of marine fish. Total MNI was estimated at 8. The bones were found in sqs. D1 (117 bones), D2 (29 bones), El, E2, F3 and II (one bone in each). The stratigraphie data on several bones was missing. A detailed description of the identified bones follows. 1. Family: Serranidae (Sea Basses, Groupers) Forty-nine bones out of 51 belonged to this family (Table 14). Sixteen bones retained enough surface markings and could be further identified to the genus Epinephelus (Groupers) and two were compatible with the species Epinephelus aeneus (Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire, 1817) English name: White Grouper. There were jawbones, other bones of the head region, and vertebrae (Figures 35-41).

Estimations of sizes of fish based on measurements of 37 bones, varied between 49 and 71 cm, with an average of 57 cm. The assemblage was divided for the sake of estimation of the Minimal Number of Individuals (MNI) into two: the group of bones found together in sq. Dl, and all the rest which were regarded as one stratigraphie unit. In the first group, all the identified bones belonged to Groupers, 39 altogether. With an estimated MNI of 4, two in the range of 50-60 cm, and two in the range of 60-70 cm MNI for 10 serranid blones (from sqs. D2 and E2) was estimated at 2 with sizes at range of 50-60 cm (each). SerranidaeSerranidae are large, solitary, predatory fish found in shallow and deep coastal waters. There are 11 species in the Eastern Mediterranean, among them some of the best local edible fish. It is difficult to distinguish the species by their bones. E. aeneus, which may attain a maximum size of about 120 cm, is a common fish along the Israeli coast.

They are caught with fishing rods and may also be speared. Larger fish live further away on deeper sandy bottoms. 2. Family: Sparidae (Porgies) One jawbone of a Sparid was found, a right premaxilla (Figure 42). These bones are so characteristic that, despite the fact that its state of preservation was very poor, it could be identified with certainty to the level of the family, and it probably belonged to the species SparusSparus aurata (Linnaeus, 1758), English name: Gilthead Sea-bream. Only part of a broken tooth-bearing plate has survived, with typical molariform teeth still embedded in their shallow sockets, and a large one encased inside the posterior swollen section of the bone. It could not be measured between standard points, but when it was directly compared to recent bones, it could be shown to belong to a medium sized fish with a standard length of about 30-40 cm. S. aurata lives in small groups in estuaries or lagoons, until it reaches maturity and a size of about 18 cm at an age of one year. Larger and older porgies are found among rocks in shallow waters at depths of 5-50 m, where they may be caught with fishing rods and hooked lines. 3. Family: Sciaenidae (Drums, Croakers) One broken otolith was found. It has retained its characteristic features so that it could be identified with certainty to the level of the family, and probably to the species Argyrosomus regiusregius (Asso, 1801), English name: Meager (Figure 43). It belonged to a fish with an estimated standard length of about 65 cm. A. regius is found in shallow and deep waters, between 15 and 200 m. It may also enter lagoons and estuaries when spawning. It feeds on smaller fish and crustaceans and may attain a maximum size of about 150 cm. Conclusions The excavation at Ziqim uncovered bones of marine fish only. The lack of remains of fresh-water fish may be explained by the limited size of the assemblage or by the absence of fresh-water fish in the vicinity of the site. At the present time there are no fish-supporting streams with an all-year-round flow of fresh water along the southern half of the Mediterranean coast of Israel. The nearest river, the Yarkon, is about 40 km to the north of Ziqim. The identified marine fish, they were of medium size, not more than about 70 cm long. This is of interest when dealing with species that have the potential of attaining much larger sizes, like sea basses and drums. The fish found at Ziqim were in a size range that could be caught with simple fishing gear, between rocks in shallow waters</page><page sequence="62">134 GARFINKEL et al. along the nearby coast, or the estuary of Nahal Shiqma. It may therefore be suggested that advanced boat-based fishing technology had not been employed. A larger assemblage of fish bones (784 bones with 297 taxonomic identifications) was found in Neolithic Ashkelon, which is situated about 5 km to the north of Ziqim (Lernau, unpublished data). It contained a richer assortment of kinds of fish than the assemblage in Ziqim, with representatives of eight marine and one fresh-water family. But again, the large majority belonged to Groupers (84%) with a similar distribution of sizes (35-75 cm, average 51 cm). These preliminary and limited data seem to suggest that the Neolithic inhabitants of the Southern Mediterranean coast of the Levant had specialized in the fishing of medium-sized Groupers. The remains of edible shells (Cerastoderma glaucum, see report by Mienis) which were presumably collected along the same coast and estuary, together with the remains of fish, show that a variety of easy-to-obtain sea food was exploited by the Neolithic inhabitants of Ziqim. The absence of imported freshwater fish from the north suggests that they satisfied their culinary needs with local commodities, whereas for luxury goods they established trade with the Red Sea, as shown by the shell pendant made of the Erythraean species Strombus fasciatus (Mienis, this report). Few remains of fish from late prehistoric sites in Israel have been analyzed to date: One centrum of a shark was found in the PPNB layer in a cave in Nahal Sefunim on the western slope of Mount Carmel. At the Pottery Neolithic sites of Qatif Y3 and Tel Kones, single bones belonging to a Sparid fish (Porgies) were identified (Lernau, unpublished data). Two bones, of a Sparid and of a freshwater fish (family Cichlidae), were also found in the Pottery Neolithic site of Tel Hreiz (Lernau, unpublished data). Nine fish bones were found in a Neolithic layer in Kabri, a site near the Mediterranean coast in northern Israel. These included bones of small and medium sized Groupers (estimated standard lengths of about 30 and 50 cm), and of the triggerfish Balistes carolinenesis (Gmelin, 1789) (Lernau in press). The latter were of special interest because they were also found in large numbers in the submerged Pre-Pottery Neolithic C site of Atlit Yam, south of Haifa. The assemblage from Atlit Yam, which is the only large collection of Neolithic fish bones studied so far from the southern Levant, contained the same kinds of fish found at Ziqim: Groupers, Porgies and Drums. There were also few remains of other fish but the bulk of the bones, over 97% of them, belonged to at least 88 individuals of triggerfish (Lernau unpublished data; Zohar et al. 1994). Remains of triggerfish have been rather rare in non-Neolithic contexts. They were absent from the small assemblage at Ziqim and there was only one bone in nearby Ashkelon. The significance of triggerfish to the economy of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period is not yet clear but their abundance in Atlit Yam may be an indication to differential specialization among fishermen along the coast.</page><page sequence="63">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 135 SHELLS (H. K. MIENIS) The archaeomalacological material recovered during the excavations at Ziqim consisted of 28 samples, containing the remains of 33 specimens. All these molluscs could be identified to the level of species in spite of the fact that a large part consisted only of fragments. Results The material is enumerated in Table 15. The remains of 11 taxa could be recognized (Table 16), which come from three different zoogeographic areas (Table 17). The landsnails Xeropicta vestalis joppensis and Helix engaddensis are still living at the site today. The specimens found at Ziqim might even be of recent origin in particular the Helix. This species aestivates while buried deeply in the soil often in layers of greater antiquity. If such a snail does not survive the long hot summer, then its shell may contaminate the older layer. The species from the Mediterranean Sea are probably of local origin i.e., from the nearby beach or even from the estuary of Nahal Shiqma. This is especially the case for CerastodermaCerastoderma glaucum, the most abundant shell at the site. All the recovered valves and fragments look as if they were collected alive. The most likely habitat for this species would have been the estuary of Nahal Shiqma, if the river had an open connection to the sea. Until recently this species of Cerastoderma lived under similar conditions in the estuaries of rivers such as the Yarkon, Alexander, Taninim, Kishon and Na'aman. If this hypothesis is correct, then the former inhabitants of the site most probably exploited this bivalve for food. The other Mediterranean species were most likely collected on the beach. Phalium granulatumgranulatum undulatum seems over represented. However, it is not clear from the remains why these shells were preferred. Some of the bivalves i.e., Glycymeris insubrica and Cerastoderma Cerastoderma glaucum have an artificially manufactured hole in the umbo. These specimens were most probably used as shell pendants. The single Antalis most likely served as a natural shell bead. The single Erythraean species Strombus fasciatus indicates a trade connection with the Red Sea. The specimen has an artificially made hole in the lower part of the body whorl, just behind the lip. This specimen was undoubtedly also used as a shell pendant. Conclusions In summarizing these few data we may state that part of the recovered mollusca at the Pottery Neolithic site of Ziqim were most probably remnants of a shellfish meal (Cerastoderma).(Cerastoderma). Others were most probably used as shell beads or pendants. The presence of the single Strombus (also a pendant) points to trade links with areas near the Red Sea.</page><page sequence="64">(36 GARFINKEL et al.

DAG) About 40 sqm in a grid of 1 by 1 m were excavated at Ziqim, in the course of the excavations some features were noted (Figures 8-10), which testify to a deliberate, rather than accidental pattern of spatial organization. Since in every square the amount of sediment dug was different, the densities were calculated as numbers of items per cubic meter (the actual samples are smaller, since the volume of excavation was lower than 1 m3 in each square) including all the finds from each square except the topsoil finds. There was no way to separate material from phases I and II. However phase I is very thin and does not dramatically bias the results. Flint The spatial distribution of three elements was examined: 1) the density of the flint items; 2) the density of the tools; 3) the density of the burnt flint items. Figure 44:a shows that the flint is not evenly distributed. Three concentrations of flint are found around sq. B2, H2 and Dl. The latter is the largest concentration, is distributed in Sqs. Dl-2, E2-3 in and around Pit I and Installation II (Figure 8). The highest density is in sq. Dl (Locus I). This area was noted as a garbage pit during the excavation and fits the very high density of flint. Loci X, XI in sq. M-N2 are characterized by a high density of flint, on the other hand Loci III, IV, V, XII do not dramatically affect the flint densities.</page><page sequence="67">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 139 The distribution of the burnt flint is very similar to that of the total flint (Figure 44:b). The three main concentrations are present in the same locations. This is not the result of the higher flint densities since in the same places the percentage of the burnt flint (out of the total flint) is higher. In other words there is a correlation between high densities of flint and high percentage of burnt items. The distribution of the tools follows a slightly different pattern (Figure 44:c). The same three concentrations are still evident, but only in the central one the density of tools was significantly higher. The highest density is in sqs. D3 and E2, outside the garbage pit (and not inside like the waste items). This pattern repeats itself for all tool types. As the distribution of tools indicates areas of activity in a site, squares D3 and E2 functioned as the main activity area within the excavated portion of Ziqim. Fauna The animal bones distribution shows some resemblance to the flint distribution (Figure 45). Two dense areas are evident, the first, larger one is concentrated in sqs. Dl-2, E2, with Pit I the densest point, as already noted during the excavation. The other concentration is around sqs. H2-3,12. The bones here are denser but the absolute number of bones is lower (because they are scattered over a smaller area). Of the 187 bones plotted, 182 were found in these two areas. Only five bones were found in other areas of the site. The three most abundant species (cattle, sheep/goat and pig) were plotted separately. They all showed the same pattern, with two concentrations with slight variations that could be explained by the small sample sizes. Fish bones were found concentrated in sqs. D1 (117 bones), D2 (29 bones), El, E2, F3 and II (1 bone each) (Lernau, this report), and so follow the same pattern as the terrestrial fauna. The concentration of the fish bones in almost one place (sq. Dl) suggests a a single event or a single locality of fish consumption in the site. The marine mollusks are distributed in three areas: around Pit I and Installation II (16 shells), in sq. H2 (3 shells) and in Loci X and XI (3 shells). These locations clearly coincide with the flint and animal bone concentrations. Other finds The ground stone implements were all concentrated in the same area, they were found in the following sqs: C2 (2), D1 (1), D2 (2) and E2 (2). All the stone tools were broken to a certain degree. Two discard patterns are possible: ( 1 ) use and discard in the same location, or (2) use and discard in different locations. Bone tools were found in the following sqs: E2 (1), E3 (1) H2 (1), Il (1) and 12 (2). This distribution coincides with the bone distribution. Like the ground stone tools, all bone tools were broken, and the same question about discard pattern arises.</page><page sequence="68">]40 GARFINKEL et al. 1250-300 1200-250 □ 50-100 □ 0-50 IS 4 9 A (r 111 // \ ***• w nmlkj ihgfedcba 160-75 0 15-30 □ 0-15 Figure 44: Flint densities in selected areas of the excavations.

Unfortunately all the pottery from the site was mixed so we could not add spatial data from this aspect to the general picture. However, from the excavation files it is clear that sqs. Dl, D2, E2, and E3 contained large amounts of pottery, though it was found in other places as well. Conclusions The small area excavated at Ziqim yielded a variety of activity areas. The main activity area contains few elements: (1) an installation that was defined by the excavator as a hearth in sqs. E/F2 (Locus II). (2) To the north of it there was an area with burnt sediment and some stones, but without any built installation (E3, Loci III, IV). This area might be the result of cleaning of the hearth. (3) To the west of Locus II (sqs. D3 and E2) there was a concentration of various types of flint tools. The repertoire includes many ad hoc tools that were probably used at the site (like notches, retouched items and perforators). On the other hand there were also tools that were probably used elsewhere (like arrowheads and sickle blades) and were only discarded on site. In the same area there was also a concentration of animal bones, ground stone tools, bone tools and shells, relating a vast repertoire of activities. The waste created during the various activities was probably dumped into the pit in sq. D1 (Locus I). A secondary activity area was in sqs. H2, H3,12 and 13. In this area there was a concentration of flint items, flint tools, animal bones, shells and bone artifacts. The repertoire of activities in this area is smaller than in the main area. Except for these main activity areas there are few patterns of artifact distribution. The most striking one is the association between burnt flint and a high density of flint. Since the burnt items include many chips and chunks it is very probable that the burning of flint was not intentional. The conclusion is that flint knapping was carried out in the vicinity of a fire. The hearth, that provides heat, light and also a social focal point, may have appealed to the people who had to perform activities that do not directly require fire, among them also flint knapping. In sq. II there was a pit (Locus XII) with evidence of burning and some bones, but without any evidence for a special use of flint. In sq. M-N2 there is an installation (Locus X, XI) with a significant flint concentration (but not of tools) and with some shells, but without any burning activity or bones. In sq. C3 there is an installation (Locus V) without evidence for either burning or artifact concentrations. Thus, the pattern is of a central place (sqs. D/E-l-3) where many activities were performed around a hearth- the focal point of the activities in the site. Around this central area there were smaller task-specific areas of activity that served each a different purpose, including burning, eating, flint knapping, etc.</page><page sequence="70">142 GARFINKEL et al. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The excavation at Ziqim yielded varied assemblages of flint, pottery, stone tools, bone tools, animal bones, fish bones and shells (Mediterranean as well as Red Sea). Both the flint assemblage and the pottery assemblage fit well with the Pottery Neolithic framework both in the repertoire of types and in craftsmanship and stylistic traits. Pits, hearths and small installations, without signs of built architecture, characterize the occupation. The faunal remains show a combined exploitation of domesticated livestock, wild terrestrial species and marine life. The evidence for agriculture is contradictory, on the one hand sickle blades are very common, but on the other hand the repertoire of ground stone tools usually associated with cereal processing is missing. The spatial patterning, indicating various activity areas together with the evidence of imports suggests a more than ephemeral occupation in the site. Thus the site of Ziqim adds to our understanding of the coastal Pottery Neolithic. The Sixth millennium BC presents fundamental archaeological problems. The basic terminology and the relative chronology of the various cultural entities are still under dispute (for a summary of the problem see Garfinkel 1999a, Table 1). In this framework, the situation in the southern coastal plain of Israel forms a specific problem, and specific studies have been devoted to this territory (Gopher 1993; Noy 1977). Four Neolithic sites from this region had been excavated: Ashkelon (Garfinkel 1999b; Perrot 1955; Perrot and Gopher 1996), Nizzanim (Yeivin and Olami 1979), Giv'at Haparsa (Burian and Friedman 1961; Olami et al. 1973) and Ziqim (Noy 1975b, 1976, 1993). To those sites one can add various surveyed sites (Burian and Friedman 1965), though data from this kind of sites is partial. As a basis for discussion this data set is very distorted; most of the sites were only partly published with a mixture of both excavated assemblages and vast surface collections. Furthermore, on the whole there are no acceptable radiometric dates available from the coastal plain sites (for a recent discussion of radiometric dates see Garfinkel 1999c). In a recent study, one of us (Garfinkel 1999a) offered to define a regional ceramic entity, the "Nizzanim ware". This entity, it was suggested, was parallel in time to both the Yarmukian and the Jericho IX wares. The southern coastal plain sites have in common not just pottery, but also the site location, the character of the occupation, the lack of heavy ground stone tools and some flint tool types. All these suggest a regional tradition. The flint assemblages on the other hand place all Pottery Neolithic sites in a much broader cultural context. However the recognition of the relationships between various Pottery Neolithic entities should be based on a much more detailed database, accompanied by radiometric dating of sites. This report is intended as part of an effort to improve our knowledge concerning the Sixth millennium BC and our hope is that in due time it will contribute to a solution of the remaining problems.</page><page sequence="71">ZIQIM, A POTTERY NEOLITHIC SITE IN THE SOUTHERN COASTAL PLAIN OF ISRAEL A FINAL REPORT 143 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to dedicate this report to the memory of the late Dr. Tamar Noy, whose research on the Neolithic period in the coastal plain, was characterized by both precision and insight.
