<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Sandra Berns and Paula Baron, Company Law and Governance: An Australian Perspective, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, xi + 518 pp, pb ?27.50 It is an ambitious task to offer an introductory account of company law and its social, political and economic context. Done well, this would be a blessing to students, whose interest is all too often suffocated by the lifeless legal machinery found in many company law textbooks. Done badly, the book would sink like the share price of an overdiversified firm: doing too much means that nothing is done well. Berns and Baron have been creditably - although not wholly - successful in achieving their difficult objective. The book is structured around a theme which applies anthropomorphic descriptions (provocatively or playfully, dependent on one's point of view) to all parts of corporate 'life'. Hence we progress from 'It's A Company! The Birth', through to 'Funeral Rites: Dissolution and Death'. The text seeks to blend coverage of traditional black- letter topics into engagement with theoretical issues. This is most successful in Parts One and Two, where an interrogation of the corporate 'person' poses some of the most interesting and important questions in company law. The reader is introduced to the relationship between corporations and the state, corporate crime, social responsibilities, moral agency, stakeholder theory and a Dworkinian model of the corporation. Students will undoubtedly benefit from exposure to these issues. However, it must be said that the authors' coverage privileges breadth over depth. Ideas are introduced at a staccato pace, leaving space in some instances for no more than soundbite treatment. One wonders whether fewer issues, developed more thoroughly, might not be more conducive to independent thought by students. The book reads more like a standard text from Part Three onwards, when the blend becomes almost entirely black-letter. The section on governance (Chapter 9) is a very accessible map of the terrain, linking directors' legal status and responsibilities with some of the wider issues canvassed earlier in the book. The treatment of share capital (Chapter 12) is particularly impressive, providing an unusually clear exposition of an area which readily lends itself to opaqueness. However, the discussion of debt finance (Chapter 11) tends toward over- simplification. For example, the authors seek to differentiate mortgages from charges (at pp 299-300) on the basis that a mortgage transfers title, but a charge only binds third parties when registered. This confuses the impact of the registration provisions, which affect the third-party status of mortgages as well as charges ('charge' is defined as including 'mortgage': Corporations Law (Aust) s9, Companies Act (UK) s 396(4)), with the underlying nature of a chargee's rights. Whilst not a right 'in' the charged assets, a charge nonetheless binds third parties to the same extent as any other equitable interest (see eg Re BCCI (No 8) [1997] BCC 965, per Lord Hoffmann at 972). Towards the end of the book, the authors once again leave the beaten track to engage in a stimulating consideration of the role of women in companies and corporate law. This, like the other introductions to theoretical issues, adds considerable value to the basic black letter coverage. All in all, this book has much ?
