<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TREE DWELLER CULTS OF THE DAKOTA BY JAMES H. HOWARD N important folk character of the Dakota is the "tree dweller" or "little forest dweller," a usually malevolent wood sprite. Though nearly forgotten by the present generation, this spirit was formerly highly venerated and even feared. Appearing in the form of a very small man, or as an animal or bird, the tree dweller lured travelers astray, and led them into dense thickets and impassable swamps. On the other hand, however, he sometimes granted favored mortals the power to cure certain diseases, the gift of clairvoyancy, and luck in hunting. Belief in the tree dweller seems to have been strongest among the Santee, or Eastern Dakota (Mdewakanton, Wahpeton, Wahpekute, and Sisseton bands). This seems quite natural, since the elf supposedly favored a wooded environment. The tree dweller is also prominent, however, in the folklore of the Yankton and Yank- tonai, and the sprite was even well known to the Plains-dwelling Teton. The earliest reference to the tree dweller encountered by the present writer is in Riggs' Grammar and Dictionary of the Dakota Language, published in i852.1 The description is as follows: "Can otidan, n. the Dakota god of the woods-an unknown animal said to resemble a man, which the Dakotas worship; perhaps, the monkey." Riggs' rendering of the name is in the Santee dialect, and his information concerning the tree dweller was presumably secured from Eastern Dakota in-- formants.2 He also gives the variant names Hohnogica, Hohnogicadan, and Ohno- gicadan for the tree dweller.3 Lynd, a contemporary of Riggs, describes the malevolent actions of the elf as follows:4 "Can otida' draws the hungry hunters to the depths of the wood by imi- tating the voices of animals or by the nefarious 'Cico! cico!' (i.e., I invite you to a feast! I invite you to a feast!) when he scares them out of their senses by showing himself to them." James Owen Dorsey includes the tree dweller in his listing of Dakota deities,. and makes an interesting comparison with a Ponca spirit:5 "The name Hohnogica, or Ohnogica is called by the Teton, Ungnagicala; which is the name of the screech- 1Stephen R. Riggs, Grammar and Dictionary of the Dakota Language; Smithsonian Contribu- tions to Knowledge (Washington, 1852), p. 41. 2 In the Yankton and Yanktonai dialect the name becomes can otina, and in Teton, can otila, or merely can oti. It may be separated into the following components: can 'wood,' 'tree,' or 'forest'; oti 'to dwell within'; dan (Santee), na (Yankton and Yanktonai), and la (Teton) are diminutive suffixes indicating the small stature of the elf. 3 Riggs, Grammar and Dictionary, pp. 68, I55. 4 J.

As the Ponka Indathinga dwells in the forest, and is said to resemble an owl, he must be identified with the Dakota Canotidan, or Ungnagicala." In the same source, however, Dorsey quotes Riggs' statement that "Can-o-te-na is represented as a little child, only it has a tail."6 Perhaps the owl-like form is merely one of the animal and bird manifestations assumed by the elf. Skinner7 gives the most detailed description of the tree dweller and his attributes, secured from Wahpeton informants. The Wahpeton told Skinner that the tree dweller is an elf who dwells in a hollow stump, open at the top, and who maintains himself by his magic arts. For example, his power extends upward into the sky for an indefinite distance, in the form of an enchanted cylindrical shaft, the size of the opening in which he dwells. When wild fowl fly over, if they cross this charmed shaft, they are stricken dead, and fall down into the Tree-dweller's den, a prey to the goblin. Even Thunderbirds fear and avoid the Tree-dweller's home. At times the being suddenly confronts some lonely hunter in the forest and fires at him a volley of questions in a confusing way. If the hunter forgets himself for an instant, and answers any question in the affirmative, the first person of his immediate family whom he meets on the way back to his lodge must shortly die, because no matter how innocent the question of the Tree-dweller sounded, it is a distorted request for the life of the first rela- tive met in the manner mentioned. Skinner goes on to mention8 that the tree dweller can grant "power" to his favorites, particularly luck in hunting and the ability to prophesy coming events. Walker9 writes of the Oglala (Teton) concept of this creature: The Can Oti or Forest Dwellers are elves who wander in lonely places and bewilder mankind so that directions and locations are not recognized. These elves can assume the form of beasts or birds for the purpose of enticing mankind into their power. The smoke of the pipe or the potency of the Four Winds, can defeat their purposes. Information secured by the present writer from members of all three divisions of the Dakota tribe regarding the tree dweller tallies well with these accounts; i.e., the tree dweller is a powerful spirit who usually appears as a little man. He dwells in the forest or in lonely places and is sometimes encountered by solitary hunters or travelers. He is usually malevolent and often "loses" people in the woods or hills. He sometimes appears to people in visions, however, and if he is secured by a person as a spirit helper in this manner he can be summoned to work for the good of the visionary by performing the proper ceremony. Shamans with tree dweller power usually made a small wooden image of him which they kept along with their other medicines and paraphernalia. Judge Francis Zahn, an Upper Yanktonai Dakota of Fort Yates, North Dakota, regarded the tree dweller as an anthropomorphic owl, and stated that the can otina originated the vibrating lingual trill used by Dakota women as an honor cry. This statement appears significant in that it supports Dorsey's description of the owl-like appearance of the tree dweller, cited above. 6 Dorsey, A Study of Siouan Cults, p. 473. T Alanson B.

Totten, North Dakota, found a carved wooden image of the tree dweller in the base of a hollow tree. Not knowing what it was, two of the children brought it home to their parents. The parents, who had been recently converted to the Roman Catholic faith, viewed the object with dread, recognizing it as the "devil doll" of a deceased shaman who had lived in that locality. Shaking with fear they carried the object to their priest to avoid any evil consequences. Another account demonstrating the great fear in which the tree dweller was held was recounted by Oscar Howe, the Dakota artist, who is the grandson of a renowned Lower Yanktonai chief. Howe stated that as a small boy he and some other boys once helped an old woman move her belongings from one house to an- other. She was a famous medicine woman and all the boys were curious to see the contents of her "medicine" trunk. Braver than his companions, Howe waited until no one was looking and raised the lid. Inside he perceived two large wooden images of the tree dweller, together with several bundles of medicines. The mere sight of these objects caused him to shiver with fright. What struck him most, however, was the powerful musky odor which emanated from the trunk. He described it as a very strong scent which he had never met before and has not encountered since. He quickly slammed the trunk shut and ran away. Several years later he asked his father about the contents of the trunk. He was told that the materials were used by the old woman in "making medicine" and that they would be buried with her when she died. The only mentions in the literature of a ceremonial in which the tree dweller figures are in two papers by Skinner,"? in which he states that images of the tree dweller were used by one band of the Wahpeton medicine lodge (the equivalent of the Ojibwa Midewiwin), called the "tree dweller band." Members of this medicine band carried "his image and a model of his forest home, instead of, or perhaps in addition to, the animal skin medicine bags of the other members.""1 He relates that the owners of these images were able to make them dance magically during the rites of the society. Skinner illustrates a medicine packet, containing a wooden image of tree dweller and various charms and medicines,12 reproduced here as Plate i. He also pictures a tree dweller image and the box, representing the hollow stump home of the tree dweller, in which it is kept.13 Riggs14 also mentions what is undoubtedly one of these images in its case, though he mistakenly identifies it as a "household god": "One of these images is that of a little man, and is inclosed in a cylindrical wooden case, and enveloped in sacred swan's down." It is interesting to find mention of the "tree dweller" shamans organized as one 10 Alanson B.

Though tree dweller shamans occurred among the Yanktonai, we have no information to indicate that they were affiliated with the medicine lodge of that division of the Dakota. An account of a tree dweller shaman's curing ceremony was secured by the writer in 1952, from Eva Littlechief, a Dakota woman living in Bismarck, North Dakota. As far as is known, this is the only account extant describing what was once a widespread tribal rite. Mrs. Littlechief was present, as a spectator, at the ceremony which she described. According to Mrs. Littlechief, the ceremony was held to cure a man who had been bothered for some time by a recurring nosebleed. The shaman who conducted the rite was an old Yanktonai, now deceased, who lived near Cannonball, North Dakota, where the ceremony was held. The rite took place in an ordinary frame dwelling from which all furniture had been removed. The shaman sat at the West end of the house, near the wall. His medicine bundle was placed at his left, and his hand drum and drumstick to his right. Before him was a small altar, consisting of a shallow wooden box filled with powdered rotten wood. On this the shaman placed red and green downy plumes. The red feathers presumably symbolized holiness, this color being a favorite with Dakota shamans, and the green were probably symbolic of tree dweller, i.e., foliage. The rotten wood, of course, was sacred to the elf as well. At the other end of the room the patient was seated. Before him was another shal- low wooden box, filled with moist earth. In the center of this box a few live coals were placed. These were replaced from time to time from a fire which was kept burning outside the house. Spectators sat around the wall of the room on both sides and at the ends. G( W ?i e s T _ I ? ? I s b 5 &lt;S) &lt; ?~_ Figure i.

He then opened his medicine bundle, took out the tree dweller doll, and stood it upright in the box of rotten wood. Next, he took a piece of red strouding from the bundle and carefully covered the doll with it. Finally, he took up his hand drum and drumstick and began to sing, providing his own accompaniment. Soon the image of the tree dweller began to dance underneath the red cloth in time with the shaman's drumming. After an interval of this singing, the shaman arose and went to the other end of the room. Opening a small pouch, he took out some herb medicine and placed a quantity on the live coals in the box before the patient. The patient was instructed to inhale the smoke which rose from the burning herb. The identity of this plant, or plants, could not be learned. Mrs. Littlechief simply called it "flowers." The shaman then returned to his seat and sang some more while the tree dweller image danced. A feast concluded the ceremony, which Mrs. Littlechief described as having cured the man's nosebleed. Though this description of the ceremony is quite vague, to say the least, it does explain one use of the tree dweller dolls. Possibly one of the bundles illustrated by Skinner contains the "flowers" used as the medicinal fumigant in this ceremony. A second Dakota tree dweller cult, or ceremonial manifestation, was described to the writer by Frank White-buffalo-man, a Teton Dakota living near La Plant, South Dakota, and Judge Francis Zahn. White-buffalo-man stated that a few years ago a certain man, a Teton Dakota, was accustomed to camp each summer, with his family, along the highway near Rapid City, South Dakota. This man performed what White-buffalo-man called an "elf" dance for passing tourists, wearing a mask which represented the tree dweller. Though this man danced for gain, White-buffalo- man insisted that the dance was inspired by the man's having dreamed of tree dweller. He stated that formerly there had been other tree dweller dreamers among the Teton who danced in a like manner.15 White-buffalo-man made a deerskin mask for the author, copying the one used by this tree dweller dreamer, reproduced as Plate 2. In a note sent with the mask he stated that it might be worn in the Omaha (grass) dance if the owner desired. This may indicate that the tree dweller was less feared by the Teton than Heyoka, the anti-natural god, since White-buffalo-man cautioned the author against using a Heyoka mask, sent in the same package, lest he be struck by lightning. Judge Zahn also mentioned seeing, as a boy, a group of masked dancers (probably both Upper Yanktonai and Teton) who imitated the tree dweller. He stated that these dancers were united by common dreams of the elf. They were not, according to Zahn, as numerous as the Heyoka dreamers. It is not known whether these tree dweller dreamers wore masks for fear of being injured if they did not, as in the case of the Heyoka cult, or whether they did so merely to demonstrate their source of power. The presence of these two arboreal spirit cults among the Dakota emphasizes the strong Woodland affinities of this tribe, which are too often forgotten in appraisals of Dakota culture. Though dwarfs and elves having the same general attributes are 15 Marshall Alexander, of St. Paul, Minnesota, recalls seeing a similar dance staged by Ikt6mi, the Dakota author, several years ago. In this dance Ikt6mi was masked, had green branches fastened to his hands and legs, and bark wrapped around his body. It is very likely that this is the same person referred to by White-buffalo-man.</page><page sequence="8">Journal of American Folklore found in the folklore of many Plains tribes, the use of wooden images of the spirit seems to be a strictly Woodland trait. Skinner states that similar images were used by the Menomini, Potawatomi, Sauk, Fox, Delaware, Shawnee, Ojibwa, and Winne- bago.16 He gives a brief description, including song texts, of a Potawatomi ceremony centering around the tree dweller images.l' In his concluding paragraph he writes:18 At a doll bundle ceremony of this nature, each person who owns one of these charms brings it and stands it up with the rest in the west of the lodge. All are dressed in fine new clothes. Anciently, it is said, they danced magically with their owners, but nowadays no one has the power to do this any more. The placing of the dolls at the West end of the lodge and the reference to their dancing "magically" are very reminiscent of the Dakota ceremony described by Mrs. Littlechief. The reference to the owners dancing, on the other hand, seems more akin to the cult described by White-buffalo-man and Judge Zahn. This suggests that both Dakota cults may have derived from a common parent. It must be admitted, however, that our present knowledge of the Dakota tree dweller cults is extremely limited, and that dancing may very well have occurred in some forms of the doll ceremony as well The Science Museum St. Paul, Minnesota 6 Alanson B.
