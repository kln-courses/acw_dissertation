Gibson, Geophysical Laboratory, Carnegie Institu tion of Washington. Since it is a long-established custom in this Society that the retiring president give an address on some branch of natural philosophy with which he is acquainted at first hand or to which he has actually made contributions, I shall speak tonight about the physical chemistry of solutions. Superficially, a solution is the simplest result we know of the interaction of unlike species of matter and may be defined as fol lows. When two or more different substances are mixed, we frequently find that a mass is produced that is homogeneous to all macroscopic criteria, whose properties are somewhere intermediate between those of the original components, and from which these components may be recovered by relatively simple operations. Such a mass is called a solution: physically, it acts as a single phase of matter; chemically, its composition is continuously variable within wide limits, a fact that distinguishes it from the orthodox chemical compound. Although solutions may be solids, liquids, or gases, liquid solutions have claimed most of our attention because of the fact that matter occurs in a relatively dense, readily confinable, but highly mobile form in liquids. Their external mobility, which permits their easy transfer from place to place, and their internal mobility, which makes them highly convenient media for chemical reactions, have given liquids a unique place in the dynamic phases of matter and life. The main problems connected with a study of solutions seem rather simple and may be .stated in the form of the following questions: (1) How can we predict exactly the properties and behavior of a solu tion from a knowledge of those of its components? (2) What character istics of a solid and a liquid cause the former to dissolve in the latter? How is solubility influenced by pressure, temperature, and other dis 1 Address of the retiring president of the Philosophical Society of Washington de livered at the 1176th meeting of the Society, January 18, 1941.

(3) What types of interaction take place among the molecules of different species intimately mixed in a solution; what deductions about these interactions can we make from observations on solutions and conversely; how do these interactions foreshadow profounder changes that may occur subsequently in the solutions? Answers to these questions, which really represent particular phases of the general problem of molecular interaction, might enable us to understand the processes going on in the vast solutions that lie around us in the oceans, below us, transporting materials within the earth, and within us, giving us nourishment and forming an essential link in that complex chain of processes we call life. Through the medium of solu tions in water, the soul of man finds expression in the creation of beauty or the search for truth, and only through the same media can he appreciate these achievements. There is no doubt of our conscious or unconscious familiarity with solutions. From a more objective point you are well acquainted with solution phenomena; you have all seen salt or sugar dissolve in water; some of you may have studied more complex solutions such as those of alcohol, sugar, and water; you may have been struck by the mystery of a rigid, massive solid being reduced to a state of mobility by mere contact with a liquid; you may have wondered what happened to the solid. So have many hundreds of generations of men before you. Each generation has con tributed to our knowledge of the phenomena of solutions, has added some new facts, and each generation has tried to explain these facts. Unfortunately, each generation has been better at discovery than at explanation—has raised more problems than it has solved—and each generation has outgrown the simpler explanations it inherited. The study of solutions has now grown to be very complex; an exact de scription of the large body of facts that has been accumulated about the properties of solutions in terms of a few simple postulates, in short, a theory of solutions, suffers from the same evil that besets all gen eralizations about phenomena close to our everyday lives. We know too much about the facts to be satisfied with theories based on simple abstractions and too little to trace the guiding clues through their manifold complexities or to handle simultaneously the many variables that must be considered. From the point of view of a lecturer to a general audience, therefore, the subject I wish to discuss tonight is in a very unsatisfactory state. My problem has been to distill from the mass of material available some thoughts on the subject that might be condensed into the space of one lecture and still be of inter est to you.</page><page sequence="3">Aug. 15,1941 gibson: physical reflections in a chemical mirror 327 THE HISTORICAL APPROACH TO COMPLICATED PROBLEMS In the first verse of the fifty-first chapter of the Book of Isaiah, you will find the words "Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteous ness, ye that seek the Lord : look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged." I have always been fascinated by this passage in which Isaiah exhorts us to make or re new the acquaintance of our intellectual ancestry, to seek an under standing of things as they are from a deeper knowledge of how they came to be so, and I think that we may apply this thought with profit to such a complex problem as the theory of solutions. I wish, however, to digress a moment and call your attention to some thoughts of a general nature that are suggested by Isaiah's ex hortation. It is quite certain that even in their wildest dreams neither the prophet nor his hearers ever imagined that men could spend their lives in the pursuit of what we call Science, and yet his words and the very figures of speech employed are so happy in their application to natural philosophers that I would advocate their inscription on the walls of all places where scientific research is fostered. Consider the phrase "look to the rock whence ye are hewn." Does it not imply a high degree of permanence in the system of which we are a part? Does it not imply an association in something much more fundamental and lasting than ourselves? It is interesting to compare this thought with that expressed by Wordsworth and familiar to all readers of "Na ture": To the solid ground Of Nature trusts the mind that builds for aye. We have assurance that this is not just poetic fancy from the re searches of one of the greatest scholars in the history of science, for George Sarton has stated as his considered opinion that "scientific activity is the only human activity that is obviously and undoubtedly cumulative and progressive."2 To continue the metaphor, each chip hewn from the rock is a step toward the final statue. We see the image more clearly and hew our chips more intelligently because of the work done by our ancestors. In other words, scientific progress is the one thing we can bequeath to posterity that will not be nibbled at by inheritance taxes on personal reputations, annihilated by the infla tions or deflations of fluctuating fashions and taste, or squandered by carelessness or indifference. Dignified as the metaphor of the rock may be, the exhortation to "look to the pit whence ye are digged" is even more appealing to Sarton, G. The history of science and the new humanism, p. 24. New York, 1931.</page><page sequence="4">328 JOURNAL OF THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES VOL. 31, NO. 8 chemists and biologists and others who work in the messier regions of science. The metaphor implies a humble origin, an intimate contact with the soil of life, a certain amount of monotonous drudgery, a pain ful groping and digging in an a most boundless quarry for something we do not even know to be there, a laborious sifting of the gold from the dross. It also carries a warning that even when the nugget of truth is found, it will be contaminated with the dirt of irrelevancy or error. The broadened outlook on scientific problems that comes to many of us most easily through a background of historical knowledge, through looking into "the pit whence we are digged," is so valuable that I think at least one member of each of the scientific departments of our large graduate schools should be versed in this aspect of his subject. I do not advocate that the memories of graduate students already burdened with a heavy technical load should be made to carry an extra weight of names and dates, but that there should be someone to stimulate them to ask: Where did this idea come from, how did this theory arise? Habits of thought so stimulated can make several significant contributions to the intellectual equipment of research workers. In the first place, even a moderate familiarity with the his torical development of our own or cognate fields enables us to put ourselves into the frame of mind of the masters who made the great advances in the past. If we take the trouble to understand their back ground, the problems as they saw them, the ideas available to them and the sources of these ideas, we can trace their steps through the arguments leading to important conclusions and try to emulate them. Glimpses of the turning points where they hesitated and the reasons that led them to prefer one road to the others are probably more valuable to the research student than the great discoveries them selves that now form an integral part of recorded science. Secondly, I think we can gain the confidence that comes from a per spective of our subject, a perspective that enables us to differentiate between apparent difficulties that arise from elaboration of simple principles and real difficulties that arise from lack of principles or ab sence of a trustworthy logic for handling simultaneously the numerous variables of a complicated problem. An interesting result of even a superficial study of this sort is the realization that the intrinsically mysterious parts of physics, chemistry, or biology are not the theo ries but the phenomena presented by nature and observed by experi ment. What the mind of one man can invent, that of another can grasp, granted that the proper effort is made and that the theory is not purely fantastic; but we must still agree with Hamlet that "there</page><page sequence="5">1MB HHH«i Ralph E. Gibson, retiring president of the Philosophical Society of Washington</page><page sequence="6">Aug. 15, 1941 gibson: physical reflections in a chemical mirror 329 are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy." The basic ideas, the concepts, and the hypotheses on which the theories of physics and chemistry are based were drawn originally from every-day experience and are very limited in number; for example, pushing with a stick (waves) and throwing stones (par ticles) are the only mechanisms we can imagine for action at a dis tance. As a science develops, the concepts and hypotheses are refined and modified in the light of the new specialized experience, with the result that the very foundations of a theory become somewhat re moved from every-day experience, and the beginner is confronted with difficulties that are not lessened by the limitations of our vocabu lary. An excursion into the past leading to a knowledge of where these ideas came from and how they grew helps greatly in removing these obstacles. An unnecessary source of difficulty in the theoretical phases of sci ence is the natural and, in some ways, laudable passion for elegance on the part of some thinkers. In constructing their theories these men start from current ideas, explore and reject many possibilities, and frequently achieve success by an inspired guess which is justified a posteriori by rigorous means. When their theory is finished, they pro ceed to polish it, to obliterate the traces of fumbling, to revise and refine the basic ideas and, in short, they end by presenting a picture that is most satisfying to one who is already familiar with the result but that is baffling to the unsophisticated. The nugget of truth is so carefully polished that all traces of the pit are removed. One can not condemn this desire, but one can deplore the loss of those revealing intermediate steps that might have meant so much to the neophyte. I am convinced that the difficulty that most chemists and many physi cists encounter in learning mathematics arises from this source. The subject has been worked over by many generations of mathematicians who have not only polished out the marks of the chisel but have also surrounded the rock with the cloud of generality and covered it with the moss of rigor. In the light of a historical survey, we may also see that many of the controversies between seemingly rival theories arose largely from the fact that the antagonists, working on different aspects of the same complex problem, derived their basic ideas from different backgrounds of experience. I shall illustrate this later by the so-called physical and chemical theories of solutions. Human limitations have forced us to split up the study of nature into different fields. While organizers, ad ministrators, and others who can not function without labels have</page><page sequence="7">330 JOURNAL OF THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES VOL. 31, NO. 8 made the most of this classification, it is one which the true natural philosopher will never cease to fight. The history of science is full of examples of great advances that came from the transfer of ideas from one field to another: Kekulé advanced organic chemistry because he had been an architect; Faraday made some of his greatest contribu tions to physics because he was also a chemist. Frequently a satisfac tory theory of complex phenomena can be developed only when con cepts and hypotheses from several of the arbitrary divisions of science are combined. ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF SOME IDEAS USED IN THE THEORY OF SOLUTIONS In asking you now to accompany me in taking a few fleeting glances into the pit whence our modern theories of solutions have been digged, I want first to indicate one general conclusion for your guidance. We shall see that the subject is not so narrow as might appear at first sight, because, in their attempts to understand the highly complex problems presented by solutions, investigators have pressed into their service all the physical and chemical ideas available to them in their age. Consequently, the story of the development of the theory of solu tions is a mirror in which we see reflected the advances in physical and chemical thought of all the ages, and I have borrowed this figure of speech with modifications from P. Waiden3 to serve as the title of this address. Early Physical Theories Somewhat arbitrarily, I shall begin this story in the first half of the seventeenth century a.D., not because the speculations made prior to that time lacked interest—in some ways they are the most inter esting part of the subject—but because this period marks the begin ning of a radical departure from the use of purely anthropomorphic ideas to the introduction of ideas culled from analyzed experience by students of the infant science of physics and the embryo science of chemistry. Up to this time the phenomena of solubility, especially of solids, had been explained in terms of the Doctrine of Affinity or the attraction of closely related materials. A liquid dissolved a solid be cause something in the solid was closely related to the liquid and wanted to be with it. The introduction of new ideas may be illustrated by a quotation from Robert Boyle4 written in 1663 which sums up one advanced school of thought at that period: 3 Walden, P. Die Lösungstheorien in ihrer geschichtlichen Aufeinanderfolge, p. 3. Stuttgart, 1910. 4 Boyle, R. Essay entitled "Of the Producibleness of Chymical Principles" (1663). See The Works of Robert Boyle, London, 1772.</page><page sequence="8">Aug. 15, 1941 gibson: physical reflections in a chemical mirror 331 These two objections I thought fit to couch together, to be able, in fewer words, to answer them both: I considered then, that amalgamation being, in effect, but a kind of dissolution of metals in a menstrum or fluid body (for such mercury is, in reference to them), there is no necessity, that the solvent should find in the metal a copious ingredi ent just of its own nature; for dissolution depends not so much upon the pretended cognation between the solvent and the body it is to work on, as upon congruity, as to size and figure, between the pores of the latter and the corpuscles of the former. Sixteen years earlier, Pierre Gassendi5 (1592-1655) had given a simi lar atomistic theory of solutions. He held that all matter was made up of atoms or molecules that had characteristic sizes, shapes, and weights. When these atoms were packed together to give a solid or liquid, small interstices or pores remained, and when a salt dissolved in water it merely occupied the pores in the water, the solution be coming saturated when all the pores were filled. The shapes of the corpuscles of matter were inferred from their crystalline forms; thus common salt had cubic corpuscles, and this argued the presence of cubic pores in water; alum had octahedral corpuscles, and it was con cluded that there were octahedral pores in the water. Lack of solubil ity indicated the absence of pores of the proper shape. The French philosopher N. Lemery6 also developed ideas of the same type. By the middle of the seventeenth century, therefore, physi cists were using ideas about the nature of solutions that are current today, the corpuscular nature of matter and the geometrical ideas of packing. The atomic nature of matter was firmly embedded in their thinking, a fact that is not surprising in view of the material available. In their speculations about matter they had two, and only two, al ternatives based on analogy with every-day experience to choose from. Either matter resembled a liquid, such as water, and was continuous, i.e., divisible without any limit, or it resembled a heap of unbreakable stones, i.e., was atomic in nature. Those philosophers who studied the phenomena of solutions could not bring themselves to believe that two continuous bodies, such as salt and water, could intermingle with such ease, and for this and other cogent reasons they had to reject the con tinuous theory of matter and adopt the only other possible choice. With the rock-pile hypothesis, the interstices or pores must, of course, go, and the step from this to geometrical relationships and the packing together of bodies is a short one. The hypothesis of pores or voids in liquids was strengthened somewhat later by the observations of Bishop Watson7 and of Reaumur8 that a contraction occurred when 5 Gassendi, Pierre.

These we might call the physical or mechanical theories of the Age of Boyle. Early Chemical Theories There were other notable investigators who even in the eighteenth century rejected this purely mechanical picture of the phenomenon of solution and held that solution represented a union between the solvent and the solute (F. Hoffmann, 1722), or implied a definite rela tionship (affinity) and similarity between the solvent and the dis solved substance (Stahl). Still another worker (Digby, 1603-1665) suggested that when a salt dissolves in water, each particle of salt incorporates with itself at least one particle of water, an intimate union suggestive of the hydrate theories that are still used. These were chemical theories of the Age of Boyle and are mentioned here chiefly to introduce the rivalry between the so-called chemical and mechanical or physical theories of solutions that has persisted al most to this day. Physical Theories of the Eighteenth Century—Influence of Newton At the beginning of the eighteenth century, new ideas were intro duced into the theory of solutions that reflected the tremendous ad vances in physics that marked the preceding 25 years. Newton's studies in optics, particularly of the phenomena of refraction and double refraction, led him to speculate on the nature of the interaction of light and matter and, incidentally, the nature of matter in general and of solutions in particular. I quote the following passages from Part I, Book 3, of Newton's Opticks, published in 1704.9 Quest. 31. Have not the small Particles of Bodies certain Powers, Virtues or Forces, by which they act at a distance, not only upon the Rays of Light for reflecting, refract ing, and inflecting them, but also upon one another for producing a great Part of the Phamomena of Nature? For it's well known, that Bodies act one upon another by the Attractions of Gravity, Magnetism, and Electricity; and these instances shew the Tenor and Course of Nature, and make it not improbable but that there may be more attractive Powers than these. For Nature is very consonant and conformable to her self. How these Attractions may be perform'd, I do not here consider. What I call At traction may be perform'd by impulse, or by some other means unknown to me. I use that Word here to signify only in general any Force by which Bodies tend towards one another, whatsoever be the Cause. For we must learn from the Phamomena of Na ture what Bodies attract one another, and what are the Laws and Properties of the Attraction, before we enquire the Cause by which the Attraction is perform'd. The Attractions of Gravity, Magnetism, and Electricity, reach to very sensible distances, and so have been observed by vulgar Eyes, and there may be others which reach to so small distances as hitherto escape Observation; and perhaps electrical Attraction may reach to such small distances, even without being excited by Friction. 9 Newton, Isaac.

And why does not common Salt, or Salt-petre, or Vitriol, run per Deliquium, but for want of such an Attraction? Or why does not Salt of Tartar draw more Water out of the Air than in a certain Proportion to its quantity, but for want of an attractive Force after it is satiated with Water? And whence is it but from this attractive Power that Water which alone distils with a gentle luke-warm Heat, will not distil from Salt of Tartar without a great Heat? And is it not from the like attractive Power between the Particles of Oil of Vitriol and the Particles of Water, that Oil of Vitriol draws to it a good quantity of Water out of the Air, and after it is satiated draws no more, and in Distillation lets go the Water very difficultly? And when Water and Oil of Vitriol poured successively into the same Vessel grow very hot in the mixing, does not this Heat argue a great Motion in the Parts of the Liquors? And does not this Motion argue, that the Parts of the two Liquors in mixing coalesce with Violence, and by consequence rush towards one another with an accelerated Mo tion? . . . If a very small quantity of any Salt or Vitriol be dissolved in a great quantity of Water, the Particles of the Salt or Vitriol will not sink to the bottom, though they be heavier in Specie than the Water, but will evenly diffuse themselves into all the water, so as to make it as saline at the top as at the bottom. And does not this imply that the Parts of the Salt or Vitriol recede from one another, and endeavour to expand them selves, and get as far asunder as the quantity of Water in which they float, will allow? And does not this Endeavour imply that they have a repulsive Force by which they attract the Water more strongly than they do one another? For as all things ascend in Water Which are less attracted than Water, by the gravitating Power of the Earth; so all the Particles of Salt which float in Water, and are less attracted than Water by any one Particle of Salt, must recede from that Particle, and give way to the more at tracted Water. When any saline Liquor is evaporated to a Cuticle and let cool, the Salt concretes in regular Figures; which argues, that the Particles of the Salt before they concreted, floated in the Liquor at equal distances in rank and file, and by consequence that they acted upon one another by some Power which at equal distances is equal, at unequal distances unequal. For by such a Power they will range themselves uniformly, and with out it they will float irregularly, and come together as irregularly. And since the Parti cles of Island-Crystal act all the same way upon the Rays of Light for causing the un usual Refraction, may it not be supposed that in the Formation of this Crystal, the Particles not only ranged themselves in rank and file for concreting in regular Figures, but also by some kind of polar Virtue turned their homogeneal Sides the same way. The Parts of all homogeneal hard Bodies which fully touch one another, stick to gether very strongly. And for explaining how this may be, some have invented hooked Atoms, which is begging the Question; and others tell us that Bodies are glued together by rest, that is, by an occult Quality, or rather by nothing; and others, that they stick together by conspiring Motions, that is, by relative rest amongst themselves. I had rather infer from their Cohesion, that their Particles attract one another by some Force, which in immediate Contact is exceeding strong, at small distances performs the chymical Operations above-mention'd, and reaches not far from the Particles with any sensible Effect. These quotations show quite clearly, I think, that the Atomic The ory of matter was firmly fixed in Newton's mind and that he saw in chemical phenomena, including solutions, an application of the same ideas that he had used so successfully in describing the motion of</page><page sequence="11">334 JOURNAL OF THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES VOL. 31, NO. 8 heavenly bodies. We see here the introduction of the idea of forces between atoms or molecules, forces which varied with the distance and not only compelled them to attract or repel each other but to influ ence light. This was really a great advance over the older ideas that chemical interaction resulted from the desire of like bodies to be to gether. We see also the evolution of a specific nature in these forces, together with ideas of saturation. It is also interesting to note that Newton had a clear picture of the relationship of heat to molecular motion and the use of thermal measurements for estimating the mag nitude of the forces holding the corpuscles of matter together, al though nearly 150 years were to elapse before the kinetic theory of heat became firmly established. Although Newton is purposely and cautiously vague about the na ture of the forces between atoms, he did extrapolate his gravitational theory far enough to say one thing about these forces and make thereby a most important advance over the current ideas. He does imply that these intercorpuscular forces are functions only of the distance be tween the particles, "by some Power which at equal distances is equal and at unequal distances unequal," and he shows that regularity in the spatial arrangement of the particles of solid bodies follows from such a law. He goes even farther, and from his observation on the double refraction of crystals of calcite he arrives at the idea of orienta tion of the ultimate particles of calcite that arise from a "polar virtue" of those molecules, i.e., a property whereby the forces acting on one part of the molecule are different from those acting on the other. In some form or other, these ideas of Newton are in use today, and I have spoken of them in some detail, not for the purpose of showing that Newton foreshadowed many modern theories of solution but to show how a powerful mind took ideas from his analyzed experience in the study of the motions of heavenly bodies and the properties of light, extracted some of the essentials and applied them in an entirely different field with results that still excite our interest and admiration. These ideas of Newton were slowly absorbed during the eighteenth century and were reiterated and developed by the French naturalist Buffon (1707-1785),10 who wrote, "The laws of affinity are the same as the general law which governs the interaction of the heavenly bod ies, the specific attractions (attractions particulières) are due solely to the shapes (figures) of the molecules because these shapes enter as an element in the distance between them." He goes on to show how the shapes of the bodies are unimportant in astronomy but may be very See Walden, op. cit., p. 37.</page><page sequence="12">Aug. 15, 1941 gibson: physical eeflections in a chemical mirror 335 significant in determining interactions in bodies as close together as molecules. The end of the eighteenth century also saw a definite realization among philosophers that the phenomena of solubility, of the density of bodies, their adhesion, cohesion, and chemical affinity, all were re lated through a single unifying principle, the attractive forces between the units of matter. There were still, however, two main schools of thought, the physical school and the chemical school. The former based their theories on ideas such as those I have just outlined, the latter insisted that a solution represented a chemical combination between the solvent and the dissolved substance. This school (Wallerius, Klap roth, and others) held that the cohesion and adhesion of matter also was a chemical phenomenon and that solutions depended on the balance of the adhesive (unfike molecules) and cohesive (like mole cules) affinities. It is evident that the difference between the physical and chemical theories depended mostly on the background of the thinker, whether he chose his fundamental ideas from physics, the attraction, shape, pores, or geometry of large bodies, or whether he chose his ideas from experience in the violent combinations known as chemical reactions. An important clarification of thought concerning solutions was made by Lavoisier toward the end of the eighteenth century when he distinguished between solution and dissolution. Solution he reserved for reversible phenomena, such as the dissolving of salt in water, when the salt is recovered by simple evaporation. He applied the term dis solution to cases such as the dissolving of a metal in an acid where the metal is not recovered on evaporation, but instead of it a salt. In this case a definite chemical change accompanied the process of solution. The Early Nineteenth Century—Chemical Theories The beginning of the nineteenth century saw the introduction of the atomic theory of matter into experimental chemistry through the law of definite proportions, the law of multiple proportions, and the law of reciprocal proportions. From these empirical laws, the chemists Dalton, Richter, and Berzelius established a quantum theory of chemically reacting masses that sharpened the definition of a chemi cal compound and soon increased the embarrassment of those who held the view that solutions were purely manifestations of chemical combination. Some, however, like C. L. Berthollet, never accepted the laws of definite and multiple proportions and could therefore consist ently retain such opinions. Others, in spite of an acceptance of</page><page sequence="13">336 JOURNAL OP THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES VOL. 31, NO. 8 Dalton's theory, continued to believe that the dissolved substance and the solvent were chemically combined. An excellent summary of the chemical theory of solutions from 1800 to 1880 is given by W. A. Tilden,11 who quotes a statement by Josiah P. Cooke written in this country in 1881 that "the facts seem to justify the opinion that solu tion is in every case a chemical combination of substances dissolved with the solvent, and that it differs from other examples of chemical change only in the weakness of the combining force." Time does not permit me to elaborate further on these chemical theories; I have felt that some discussion of them is necessary in order to balance the picture, but we must return to the main subject and see how the advances in physics during the nineteenth century are re flected in the theories of solutions. We shall see later the ultimate fate of the controversy between chemical theories and physical theories. Electrical Theories By the year 1800 sources of voltaic electricity had been developed and the fundamental laws governing the attraction and repulsion of electrostatic charges had been established by the physicists. Chemical effects of electrical currents also were being investigated. It is not sur prising, therefore, that electrical ideas were incorporated into chemi cal thought at this time. We are all familiar with the extensive theory in which Berzelius attempted to explain all chemical combination by the action of forces between electrical charges, an attempt that failed because chemists of that time knew too much about chemistry and the physicists too little about electricity. Some years before Berzelius's theory, Th. von Grotthuss applied electrical ideas to solutions, par ticularly those that conducted electricity. He considered water as a dipole, the hydrogen being associated with positive electricity and the oxygen with negative electricity, and assumed that a continuous dis sociation and recombination of these dipoles took place so that there was a constant interchange of partners among the water dipoles. In the same way an electrolyte, such as a salt, was supposed to be com posed of a positive and a negative part (e.g., Na+ and Cl~) and it was thought that a constant exchange of partners among the dissolved molecules also occurred. All this happened without the passage of elec tric current through the solution, but, as we should say today, the exchange of partners was purely random. When positive and negative electrodes were placed in the solution, a direction was given to this ex change with the result that current flowed and electrolysis took place. 11 Tilden, W. A. British Assoc. Reports, 1886, p. 444.</page><page sequence="14">Aug. 15, 1941 gibson: physical reflections in a chemical mirror 337 Of especial interest is the picture that Grotthuss gave of the solu bility of electrolytes, e.g., salts. He suggested that the solubility of such substances depended on their capacity to split up their "polar electric elementary particles," i.e., ions, and in the association of these ions with the molecular galvanic activity of the water. The work of Grotthuss marks the introduction of ideas drawn from electrical ob servations to give a mechanism for the vague ideas of chemical affin ity, and he suggests that the solubility of salts in water is an electro chemical phenomenon depending on the interaction between the water molecules acting as electrical units and the ions into which the dis solved electrolytes resolve themselves. The Kinetic Theory The next important set of ideas that we find introduced into the theory of solutions reflects an advance in physics for which the nine teenth century will always be famous in the annals of science. I refer to the establishment of the kinetic theory of heat and matter on a firm experimental and logical basis by Clausius and others. Members of both the physical and chemical schools of thought in the early nineteenth century seem to have had a clear recognition of the relations between those forces that caused one substance to dis solve in another and those forces that gave rise to cohesion in solids and liquids. For example, the French chemist Dumas12 wrote in 1836, "Molecular attraction manifests itself in three well differentiated ways, between molecules of one and the same body, this is the ordi nary cohesion of the physicists, between more or less similar molecules, which mix in such a way as to preserve their individual properties— that is the force of solution, and finally between dissimilar molecules which unite intimately giving a product of quite different properties— this is Affinity." Such views were generally held and attempts were made to explain the solubility of solids and especially saturated solu tions in terms of competing forces—forces between the solvent and solute molecules producing solution on the one hand and forces of co hesion opposing the dispersion of the solid on the other. These investi gators apparently felt the need of a general type of force or agency opposing cohesion, an agency that tended to separate molecules from each other. Newton supplied this need by repulsive forces, but it is just as well that his ideas on this subject did not spread, although it is to be regretted that no one followed up his ideas of heat as a measure of molecular attraction. 12 Dumas, J.

Paris, 1837.</page><page sequence="15">338 JOURNAL OF THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES VOL. 31, NO. 8 When the theory that heat is a form of molecular motion was firmly established on an experimental basis, this general dispersing agency was at once apparent in the kinetic energy of the molecules. For ex ample, Clausius and Joule showed that the pressure of a gas was en tirely due to the motion of the molecules, and the processes of melting, evaporation, and sublimation were at once thought of as taking place when the temperature and hence the kinetic energy of the molecules became large enough to overcome the forces of cohesion. From 1860 to 1885, therefore, a number of theories, e.g., those of L. Dossios (1867), W. W. J. Nicol (1883), Gay-Lussac, and W. A. Tilden and W. A. Shenstone (1884) appeared in which the kinetic energy of the molecules played an important role in the discussion of solubility and other phenomena connected with solutions. For ex ample, Tilden and Shenstone examined the connection between the solubility and the fusibility (melting point) of salts showing in general that the lower the melting point, the more soluble was the salt, and wrote :13 But the connexion between fusibility and solubility, though proved does not wholly explain the nature of the initial stage in the process of solution of a solid. It does, how ever, strongly support a kinetic theory of solution based on the mechanical theory of heat. The solution of a solid in a liquid would accordingly be analogous to the sublima tion of such a solid into a gas, and proceeds from the admixture of molecules detached from the solid with those of the surrounding liquid. Such a process is promoted by rise in temperature, partly because the molecules of the still solid substance make larger excursions from their normal centre, partly because they are subjected to more violent encounter with the moving molecules of the liquid. Such a view does not necessarily in volve the assumption of an "attraction" between the molecules of the solvent and those of the solvend (Cf. L. Dossius, Jahresb. (1867), 92. Nicol, Phil. Mag. Feb. 1883). Indeed it is difficult to disconnect "attraction"from the idea of combination resulting from such attraction. In some cases we are considering, e.g. the solution of anhydrous Na2S04 in water at 100°, nothing like combination between water and salt seems to occur. We notice that the role of the attractive forces between molecules in solutions, introduced by Newton, is being abandoned and attempts are being made to explain all the phenomena by the kinetic theory. The Kinetic Theory of Van't Hoff These theories were, however, completely overshadowed by the kinetic theory picture developed a year or so later (1887) by van't Hoff from a study of the osmotic pressure of solutions. It had been known for a long time that, if a solution were placed in a strong vessel and connected with the pure solvent by a membrane permeable to the solvent, but not to the dissolved substance, solvent flowed through 1 Tilden, W. A., and Shenstone, W. A. Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. 175A: 30. 1884.</page><page sequence="16">Aug. 15, 1941 gibson: physical reflections in a chemical mirror 339 the membrane into the solution until a definite pressure was developed in the vessel containing the solution. This pressure was called the Osmotic Pressure. Van't Hoff showed from the experimental results of Pfeffer that the following relationship held in dilute solutions: 7t = (n/V)RT where tt is the observed osmotic pressure, n is the num ber of gram molecules dissolved in a volume V, T is the absolute tem perature, and the constant R has the same value as the well-known gas constant. The analogy of this result with the equation of state for an ideal gas P =RT/V led van't Hoff to regard the dissolved sub stance as an ideal gas dispersed in a solvent whose role was that of a modified empty space and, of course, to treat the osmotic pressure as the pressure of an ideal gas, i.e., of purely kinetic origin. This theory was brilliant and led to some excellent experimental work, notably that of H. N. Morse and his students in Baltimore, who showed that the law was limited to very dilute solutions, if exact application were desired, and who studied the effects of temperature and the nature of the solvents and dissolved substances. The theory suffered from the fate common to all simple theories in this field, it long outlived its use fulness. You will notice that the theory exalts one idea, namely, the kinetic energy of the dissolved substance, to a position that excludes all the other considerations we have spoken of. Such a defect is fatal in so complicated a subject. The result was that several generations of chemists had to learn all about the osmotic pressure of solutions under the impression that it was a unique and fundamental quantity, and they tried to patch up the theory of van't Hoff to cover regions where, by its fundamental assumptions, it was inapplicable. Like too many theories, that of van't Hoff started as a strong current carrying the ship of science into broader waters of knowledge and ended up by being a whirlpool in which there was plenty of motion but all in a circle. Thermodynamics—Entropy and Energy The decade from 1880 to 1890 saw the beginning of a series of ex tensive and intensive researches on the properties of solutions which has continued unabated to this day. Indeed, these studies have con stituted a major part of the science of physical chemistry that dates from 1887, the year of the publication of the first volume of the Zeit schrift für Physikalische Chemie. In order to understand this activity, we must recall that by 1880 chemistry was on a sound basis. Not only was the atomic theory firmly established but definite and trustworthy ideas about molecules had also been developed and a consistent sys tem of molecular and atomic weights was available. Hypotheses of</page><page sequence="17">340 JOURNAL OF THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES VOL. 31, NO. 8 valency or the combining powers of the elements had been tested ex perimentally and a convenient, simple, and consistent scheme had been devised for the formulation of elements and compounds. At this time, too, we see a new reflection appearing in our mirror, a reflection that was to become a floodlight revealing relations among many ap parently disconnected phenomena. I refer to the science of thermo dynamics. Although thermodynamics and the kinetic theory were "nursed upon the selfsame hill," they are different in character. Classi cal thermodynamics is now a self-contained science based on two fundamental laws whose validity has been placed beyond doubt by experiment. From these two laws, deductions reaching into all branches of science have been made by unimpeachable mathematics. The science deals with experimental quantities, heat, work, tempera ture, pressure, and functions formally derived from them, and its theo rems are exact. It is one of the few branches of physics that have come unscathed through the recent revolutions. The reason is that thermo dynamic arguments depend only on observables and are independent of any hypothesis concerning the nature of matter. The function of thermodynamics in physical chemistry has been to provide exact relations among observable quantities, thereby promot ing economy, not only of measurement by limiting the number of ex periments we have to do, but also of thought by allowing us to pass readily and exactly from measured quantities whose theoretical sig nificance is obscure to those whose interpretation is more readily seen. In other words, thermodynamics gives us an exact system into which the experimental results of physical chemistry in general and the stud ies of solutions in particular, may be fitted, a system which enables us to examine the results from many points of view and pass to the more abstract quantities, such as energy and entropy, which lead di rectly into the kinetic theory and statistical mechanics. Because of its very nature it was not to be expected that thermo dynamics could supply any new mechanisms for use in the theory of solutions, but this science did make an important contribution to the theory in that imperceptibly but inexorably it forced physical chem ists to think simultaneously of several variables, the forces between molecules, their geometry, and their kinetic energy. This came about because the thermodynamic criterion of equilibrium insists that we consider at the same time both energy and entropy, potential energy (forces), and kinetic energy (motion). I shall illustrate this by an ex ample drawn from ideal solutions where changes of energy are zero. Suppose I have two liquids A and B, such that the forces between</page><page sequence="18">Aug. 15, 1941 gibson: physical reflections in a chemical mirror 341 the molecules A and A, B and B, and A and B are the same, and I place A and B in contact. I shall find that at constant temperature, a spontaneous process takes place and that finally I get a homogeneous solution AB. If the liquids are properly chosen, careful measurements will also show that there is no heat and no volume change during the process, but in spite of this we knowr that the final state is definitely different from the initial state, and we want to find the physical quan tity that reflects this change. Thermodynamics provides such a quan tity in the entropy of the system and furthermore says that, since the change was a spontaneous one, the change in entropy is greater than the heat absorbed divided by the absolute temperature, i.e., greater than zero in this case. Hence the entropy increased during this process. With the aid of the kinetic theory or elementary statistical mechan ics, we can go farther and see that the entropy of a substance may be measured by the volume in configuration space that the coordinates of its molecules may occupy, together with the volume in momentum space that the points representing the momenta of its molecules and their moving parts may occupy. At constant temperature, we may consider that this latter part of the entropy is fixed and conclude that the increase of entropy that accompanied the mixing of liquids A and B arose solely from the fact that the molecules of each found larger volumes available to them. Indeed, from elementary statistical me chanics, we may see that the following expressions represent what happened :14 Sa — SA0 = - ßlnZA (1) SB - Sb° = - AinAb. (2) Let us carry the argument one step farther and change the tempera ture so that one of our pure liquids freezes—we shall then be dealing with the solubility of a solid in a liquid; naphthalene in contact with benzene is an actual example that approximates to the conditions I am describing When the solution is saturated, we have coexisting at equilibrium solid A (naphthalene) and a solution of A and B. Under such conditions, thermodynamics tells us. that the pressure and the temperature must be the same in both phases and that the following relation must hold for the component that is present in both phases, the naphthalene in this example : 14 In this example the symbols have the following meaning: SA is the partial molal entropy of substance A in the solution, SA° is the molal entropy of pure liquid A, SAS is the molal entropy of solid A, XA is the mole fraction of A in the solution. &lt;SB, Sb°, SB3 and XB are the same quantities for component B. HA, HA°, HAS are the molal heat contents corresponding to these entropies (the heat content is the total energy+the pressure multiplied by the volume). R is the conventional gas constant per gram mole cule. T is the absolute temperature.</page><page sequence="19">342 JOURNAL OF THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES VOL. 31, NO. 8 - TSAS = HA- TSa (3) i.e., //a - HAS = T(SA - Sas) ■ (4) and, if there is no heat change when the liquids are mixed, Ha° - Has = T(S\ - Sas) (5) where (HA° — HAs) is the ordinary heat of melting of the solid A, which may change with temperature but this change depends only on sub stance A and not on the solution. With the help of equation (1), we may go farther and write (Hao - Ha*) = (SAo - Sas) - R\nXA. (6) T This picture gives a direct connection between solubility and melting in the ideal case. At the melting temperature of A, i.e., T = Tm, we know that (HA°-HAS) = Tm(SA°-SAS) or XA = 1, i.e., pure liquid A is in equilibrium with solid A. Since solids freeze spontaneously below their melting points, we see that (Ha°—Has)/T is greater than (SA° — SAS) if T is less than Tm, in which case the equation is balanced only if i?lnXA is negative or XA is between 0 and 1, a positive fraction representing the solubility of solid A in liquid B. This example shows (1) that the solubility of solid A is due to the increased entropy that A gets when its molecules are dispersed in B (indeed, the term — R\nXA actually measures this entropy change) and (2) that this solubility will increase with temperature, a well known experimental fact. This is the thermodynamic description of the state of affairs in an ideal solution and is the basis of a general theory of solutions today. Wherein does this differ from the theory of van't Hoff or other kinetic theories; are we still regarding the dissolved substance as an ideal gas in an inert medium? The answer is interesting. So far as the entropy change on mixing is concerned, we are considering the dissolved sub stance as an ideal gas, but as regards energy changes we are assuming that a molecule of A is acted on by the same forces when immersed in liquid B as when it is surrounded by molecules of its own kind. It is certainly not a gas from this point of view. The interactions between molecules A and A, B and B, and A and B are, therefore, of great im portance, and only in very rare cases is an ideal solution, as pictured above, realized experimentally. Generally speaking, the solubility of A in B will be greater than the ideal solubility given by a calculation analogous to that just described if the A—B attractive forces are</page><page sequence="20">Aug. 15, 1941 gibson: physical reflections in a chemical mirror 343 greater than the A—A or B — B forces, and less if the opposite condi tions hold. One of the chief lines of attack on the problem of solutions today is directed toward finding out the nature of intermolecular forces between like and between unlike molecules and applying this knowledge through statistical mechanics to obtain an adequate quan titative description of the properties of solutions as observed in the laboratory.15 It should be mentioned that the intermolecular forces and the geometry of the systems not only influence the energy but also add to the entropy terms that must be considered along with the ideal entropy of mixing. In recent years some instructive attempts to calculate the energy and the entropy of solutions have been made.16 The point we have now reached in our consideration of the evolu tion of the ideas used in the theories of solutions is well into the twen tieth century. Let us pause to gather together some of the ideas of which I have spoken. The list is by no means exhaustive, but it con tains most of the raw material of which modern theories are made: (1) Corpuscular nature of matter (older philosophers); (2) geometry of corpuscles or molecules—size, shape, packing, voids or holes in packing (Boyle, Gassendi) ; (3) general forces between molecules—attraction and repulsion (Newton, Buffon—developments of mechanics) ; forces that are functions of distance only; (4) orientation of corpuscles—light as means of investigating matter (Newton); (5) chemical theories— specific but unknown chemical forces as opposed to general physical forces causing attraction or cohesion of molecules ; connection between forces producing cohesion and forces producing solution; (6) electrical nature of forces causing chemical combination, cohesion, and solution —electricity in molecular systems (Grotthuss, Berzelius) ; (7) kinetic theory of matter—heat as form of molecular motion; disordering effect of heat and temperature ; gas picture of solutions ; relation of solubility and melting; (8) thermodynamics—unification of experimental results; quantitative studies of equilibrium and direction of physicochemical changes; heat and entropy; (9) statistical mechanics. 15 Although by far the greater portion of the effort devoted to the study of solutions has been directed toward the problem of solutions of electrolytes in water and develop ments of great importance have been made in this field, limitations of space prevent the discussion of theories of electrolytes here. It has been realized for many years that strong electrolytes exist mostly as positively and negatively charged ions in water solutions, and since the potential fields around ions are well known, the application of elementary electrostatics and statistical mechanics has led to noteworthy advances in the understanding of the subject. Electrolytes form a case where an important part of the intermolecular action (forces between the ions) is known. A general formula tion of solution theory into which the treatment of electrolytes or non-electrolytes may be fitted is given by J. G. Kirkwood (Chem. Rev. 19: 275. 1936). 16 Bernal, J. D., and Fowler, R. H. Journ. Chem. Physics 1: 515. 1933; Eley, D. D., and Evans, M. G. Trans. Faraday Soc. 34: 1093. 1938; Everett, D. H., and Coulson, C. A. Trans. Faraday Soc. 36: 633. 1940.</page><page sequence="21">344 JOURNAL OF THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES VOL. 31, NO. 8 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS The next part of my story concerns the further development and refinement of these ideas, but now a change takes place in our perspec tive. We have been seeing various advances in physics reflected in the mirror of the chemistry of solutions, but now our mirror becomes transparent and we look through the phenomena of chemistry into the realm of physics that underlies them and find that the interface that separated these sciences was not real but was placed there by the limitations of our own point of view. Those unknown attractive forces about which Newton speculated, the same unknown forces that caused the disputes between those who supported the chemical theories and those who supported the physical theories, are becoming known, and in the light of this knowledge the boundary between physics and chemistry is fading. The faint reflection that Grotthuss and Berzelius caught has grown to the magnitude of a sun, and to its light we owe our present knowledge. Even an outline of how this change has come about would take sev eral lectures, and it is a subject with which most of you are familiar, anyway. I shall, therefore, merely mention a few landmarks. Through the experimental researches of Faraday and the work of the brilliant theoretical physicists of the second half of the nineteenth century, notably Maxwell, the sciences of electromagnetics and elec trostatics rose to their full stature. The researches of J. J. Thomson and his school, together with the discovery of radioactivity, estab lished on an experimental basis the corpuscular nature of electricity and the electrical nature of matter. The researches of the spectro scopists, together with the inspiration of Bohr and his followers, when added to these results, have led to the universal acceptance of the theory that the atoms of matter are complex systems composed of elementary electrical particles, electrons, protons, positrons, etc. Finally, the development of quantum mechanics removed the last obstacle that stood in the way of a general conclusion that in prin ciple all forces of attraction and repulsion between atoms and mole cules arise from the complex electrostatic interactions of the charges of which- they are composed. Thus those forces producing chemical combination, physical cohesion, the solubility of one substance in an other, and all the other metamorphoses observed in nature are be lieved to be the result of a complex system of positive and negative electrical charges seeking a configuration of lowest potential energy. Based on quantum mechanics we now have a statistical mechanics</page><page sequence="22">Aug. 15, 1941 gibson: physical reflections in a chemical mirror 345 that leads us from molecular theory to the properties of matter in the bulk with no alarming contradictions. "Chemical" and "Physical" Forces The practical solutions of the problems of the interaction between the electrical systems that constitute atoms or molecules are, in gen eral, difficult, but an important simplification has arisen from the fact that, by suitable approximation, the stable configurations may be made to fall into certain classes identifiable with the types of com bining forces or bonds that the chemists have postulated by induction from their experiments, together with types of forces well known in experimental physics. Thus, in one type of configuration, the force between two atoms acts as a plain electrostatic attraction between two oppositely charged particles. This is the ionic link met with in salts such as sodium chloride. In another type of stable arrangement, we have a complex state of affairs that corresponds to the sharing of elec trons between two atoms as postulated by G. N. Lewis. This is the covalent link, the common binding in organic chemistry and the for mation or breaking of such bonds is what chemists usually mean by a chemical reaction. These bonds are directed and an atom can have only so many of them. Thus arise the combining laws of Dalton and the stereochemistry of van't Hoff. Another stable arrangement which was not at all understood before the quantum theory is that which gives the cohesion of metals. Furthermore, molecules (as well as atoms) are electrical systems, and mutual interactions between their constituent charges lead to forces that hold them together or push them apart. In this class belong the "van der Waals' forces" of the older physicists or the "residual valencies" of the chemists. From the researches of Debye, London, and others, a fair amount is known about these forces. They arise from a variety of causes in which the size, the shape and the polarizability of the molecules play an important part. These are the forces most commonly encountered in non-aqueous solutions. In the light of mod ern knowledge and experience, however, we now recognize that any or all of the types of force enumerated above may be met with in solutions. The present status of the controversy between the "physi cal" and "chemical" schools may be summed up, therefore, by the phrase, "both are partly right." I must mention, however briefly, one other fertile source of ideas that are applicable in a study of solutions, viz, the structure of crys talline solids, for this leads us back to the geometrical ideas of Boyle. Von Laue's discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals, the</page><page sequence="23">346 JOUBNAL OF THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES VOL. 31, NO. 8 simplified theory and inspired experiment by the Braggs, the mathe matical studies of the homogeneous packing of bodies in space by Schönflies, Federoff, and Pope and Barlow, and the untiring efforts of many workers in the last 30 years have given us a knowledge of how the atoms, ions, or molecules are arranged in crystals. Hand in hand with this information about the geometry of solids has come, through studies of lattice energies, definite knowledge con cerning the forces of cohesion in solids and liquids. For example, it is known that sodium-chloride crystals are held together by nondirected electrostatic forces between the charged ions which act as units to gether with a slight contribution from van der Waals' forces. The pack ing is determined by the relative sizes of the sodium and chloride ions. In diamond, on the other hand, the units (atoms of carbon) are held together by covalent bonds—the same bonds as in CH4—and the structure in which one carbon is surrounded by four others is deter mined by the direction of these bonds. The bonds are very strong, and this accounts for the hardness of diamond and for the fact that it will not dissolve in any solvent, while sodium chloride dissolves easily in solutions of high dielectric constant. On the other hand, an analysis of the structure of paraffin wax shows that the hydrocarbon molecule is the unit of structure. Within the molecule the carbon and hydrogen atoms are held together by very strong covalent forces, which practically neutralize each other's fields, leaving only the relatively weak van der Waals' forces to hold the solid together. This solid is weak, melts easily—it is easily soluble in other hydrocarbons like gasoline. Studies of solids have sharpened our ideas of the nature of cohesive forces and, at the same time, shown that these may be what used to be called purely chemical, as in dia mond, or purely physical, as in paraffin wax or almost anything in between. These studies have also made physical chemists conscious of geome try, of the important role played by the shape and size of atoms, mole cules, or ions in determining solid structure. Many solids that are referred to as compounds but whose composition puzzled chemists in the past are now known to owe their existence to geometrical reasons, to the possibilities of packing in regular structures, rather than to the action of specific chemical bonds. It is also well recognized that con gruity in the size and shape of the component ions or molecules is a most important factor in determining whether two substances shall form solid solutions. The old ideas of Boyle and Gassendi are still with us.</page><page sequence="24">Aug. 15, 1941 gibson: physical beflections in a chemical mirkor 347 The application of these ideas of geometrical packing and the effect of intermolecular forces on it are now being carried over to liquids and solutions, where the determination of the molecular distribution in space is one of the most interesting problems. CONCLUSION We have traced in broad outline the development of the different ideas used in the theory of solutions and have seen how some of these ideas were taken from every-day experience and gradually shorn of their irrelevancies and molded into shape for quantitative use. Above all, I have tried to point out how developments in one science, viz, physics, were used in the development of a subject belonging to the cognate science of chemistry. In our excursion into the pit we have seen the remains of many muddling efforts in the past, attempts to explain complicated phenomena in terms of one or two simple ideas ; we have seen, however, that each of these attempts contained a nug get of truth that is still a treasured possession in our store. As a result of this excursion, I hope that the familiar sight of a crys tal of common salt dissolving in water or sugar dissolving in a cup of tea will conjure before your mind a panorama of particles, motions, and forces. I hope that you will see the microscopic electrical systems of different sorts that constitute the ions of the salt or the molecules of the water being impelled to mix with each other in as disorderly a fashion as possible under the drive of their thermal motion, fulfilling their destiny by increasing the entropy of the universe. I hope that you will imagine these microcosms arranging themselves in positions of lowest energy into configurations that may sometimes suggest that they are joined by directed chemical bonds, sometimes that they are held by non-directed physical forces of varying magnitude, sometimes joined by a bond that combines the qualities of both those just men tioned. In your picture I hope you will also add geometrical consid erations, that you will think of the sizes and the shapes (including the electrical distributions) of the ions or molecules and that you will note the effect of geometry on the energy (the forces) and the entropy (the motion) of the system as a whole. Above all, I hope that you will realize that the phenomenon you are witnessing differs from others you may have studied in that you can not get an explanation that will satisfy you if you exalt any one of these considerations to the exclusion of the others. Therein lies the complication. I have left you with a picture of complexity, but if you will look to the hole of the pit whence it was digged, you will not be dismayed</page><page sequence="25">348 JOURNAL OF THE WASHINGTON ACADEMY OF SCIENCES VOL. 31, NO. 8 by it. In the past, mathematicians have forged out of human experi ence methods of mechanical and exact development of ideas ; they are still doing so and we have every reason to believe that mathematical methods for handling complicated problems wThere abstraction is un desirable will be available in the future. Our glimpse into the past gives us every assurance that a better understanding of solutions will come as time goes by, but we must expect that understanding to be based on concepts that are still further removed from our every-day experience.</page></plain_text>
