As Brooks notes in the general introduction to this excellent book, the term 'serpentine' in its strictest sense refers to minerals having the general formula Mg3Si205(OH)4. Rocks rich in such minerals are called 'serpentinites' and are members of a larger class of rocks, the 'ultramafites', which contain &gt;70% of ferromagnesian minerals. Most non specialist scientists and laymen refer to all ultrama fites as 'serpentine'. Ultramafites (ultramafic rocks) and their vegetation are the subject matter of this book. Retention of the term 'serpentine' in the book's title is a concession to the widespread, albeit inaccurate, use of the term. Ultramafic rocks occupy less than 1% of the earth's land surface, but are of considerable botani cal interest because of their unusual, highly special ized flora's and physiognomically distinctive, often xeromorphic vegetation. During the past hundred years, study of the soils, flora and vegetation of ultramafic rocks has resulted in approximately 1000 scientific publications. Brooks' survey of this inter national literature provides convincing evidence for the importance of ultramafic rocks as a rich natural laboratory for investigations into plant ecology, phytosociology, biogeography, evolution, physiolo gy and biogeochemistry. The book is divided into two parts, the first and more general entitled 'Serpentine Ecology'. Follow ing a brief introduction, the initial chapters of 'Ser pentine Ecology' cover ultramafic rocks and the soils developed from them. The properties of ultra mafic soils are particularly relevant to plant ecologi cal studies. Brooks identifies the most important of these properties as: (1) high concentrations of side rophile elements (Fe, Cr, Ni, Co); (2) low concentra tions of plant nutrients (N, P, K); (3) low Ca/Mg quotient; and (4) low contents of clays having low exchange capacities. The following chapter, entitled 'The Serpentine Factor', will be of special interest to plant ecologists. In this chapter, Brooks summa rizes research into the causes of unusual flora and vegetation on ultramafic rocks. Likely contributors to the 'serpentine factor' are Ni toxicity, high availa ble Mg, low available Ca, and an adverse Ca/Mg ra tio. Brooks views soil infertility per se as a less im portant contributor, although antagonism by Ni and Mg may limit uptake of other elements. Brooks ob serves that a century of research into the nature of the 'serpentine factor' has resulted in no clear reso lution of the problem. One reason for such slow progress is the fact that ultramafic rocks and soils are highly variable worldwide, making it unlikely that a single 'explanation' will be well suited to all regions. Another difficulty is the multifactorial nature of the 'serpentine factor', a complex of soil properties in teracting with an often diverse biota. There are five additional chapters in the first part of the book. The first of these covers agricultural problems associated with ultramafic soils, an impor tant issue in certain countries, such as Cuba, New Caledonia, and Turkey, which have 10-35% of their land area in ultramafic rocks. This chapter also reviews work on revegetation of the mine dumps and tailings that are common on mineral-rich ultramafic rocks. The next chapter covers research on plant evo lution on ultramafic rocks, with emphasis on ende mism and speciation. Another chapter reviews the relatively sparse literature on animals in the ultra mafic environment. Brooks devotes a large chapter</page><page sequence="2">92 to nickel hyperaccumulators, plant taxa containing in excess of 1000 /xg/g (0.1%) Ni in their aerial parts, particularly leaves. Such plants are useful for bio geochemical prospecting, some of which can be done from herbarium specimens. A final chapter covers kimberlites and carbonatites, rocks of special interest because of their association with diamond deposits. The second part of the book is a regional survey of ultramafic rocks, their soils, flora and vegetation. Brooks provides separate chapters for North Ameri ca, Tropical America, Northwest Europe, Central and South Europe, Continental Asia, Japan, Africa, the Malay Archipelago, New Caledonia, Australia and New Zealand. In each chapter the available liter ature covering such areas as geology and tectonics, soils, flora, vegetation, biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry is reviewed. This regional survey occupies nearly three-quarters of the book, and represents a delightful world voyage for the armchair ecologist or phytosociologist. As in the first part of the book, many of the papers reviewed are illustrated with tables and figures, the latter redrawn to a con sistent format. Color and black and white plates il lustrate flora and vegetation, and include a number of aerial and satellite images. An interesting point that emerges from Brooks' review is the very uneven regional coverage of the literature. Japan heads the list with 58 papers on the vegetation of ultramafic rocks, while South America, which has large areas of such rocks, is represented by a single paper. The book is well written and thoroughly indexed, and contains relatively few typographic errors. An occasional anthropomorphism appears to reflect the author's enthusiasm for his subject. Some of the figures are roughly lettered, and a few of the plates seem slightly out-of-focus. The latter problem is un derstandable, since most of the plates were made from photographs obtained from a variety of sources throughout the world. The author is to be commended for an excellent production overall. He provides fairly even coverage of a diversity of topics, and makes an effort to standardize data presenta tion, of particular importance when comparisons of nutrient concentrations are based on a number of published sources. There is even a thoughtful precautionary section on the difficulties of inter preting data on 'available' nutrients. This fascinat ing book should be required reading for students of flora and vegetation of ultramafic rocks, or of other 'unusual' rock types. Others who will find the book of considerable interest are those studying biogeo graphy, evolution, or mineral nutrition of plants. Thomas R. Wentworth, Raleigh, NC</page></plain_text>
