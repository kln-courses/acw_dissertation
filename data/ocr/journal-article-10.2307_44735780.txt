ABSTRACT This paper summarizes the results of two studies per- formed in 1995 [1] and 1996 [2] which lay out the case for commercializing services performed in space by Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA). EVA services include all work done external to pressurized volumes, whether directly by humans or remotely by machines. The studies draw heavily on the experience of the subsea service industry because the environments, work, and equipment have many, relevant similarities. It examines several historical parallels which serve as models of how a government activity has been successfully commercialized, examines the markets and cost structure of EVA operations to ver- ify the potential profitability of such an endeavor, and lays out a plan for the transition to commercial services. INTRODUCTION MANNED SPACE EXPLOITATION - Humans have now been in space for nearly forty years. Although the Space Shuttle is orders of magnitude more sophisticated than the first manned space vehicles, one might be excused for wondering if this accomplishment represents a rate of advance comparable to other technological accomplish- ments across similar periods. Forty years after the Wright brothers' spindly contraption first entered the air, commercial airliners were routinely taking people across oceans and continents, bombers and fighters had changed the nature of warfare, and the jet was being tested in England and Germany. Forty years after self- contained breathing apparatus became available for underwater divers, divers routinely construct heavy, intri- cate structures at depths below 1000 feet using an array of sophisticated work systems. Certainly space is more difficult to reach than the atmosphere or oceans, but it is not inherently more hazardous; the conquest of the air and the subsea depths have claimed countless lives before they were accessed with our current level of confi- dence. If the penetration of humans into space has not kept pace with their penetration into other dangerous environments, perhaps this deficiency can be traced to one undeniable difference between them: from its beginning, human access to space has been a de facto government monop- oly, subject to the full range of government budget priori- ties and political sensitivities. A commercial motivation, not subject to such considerations, might accelerate manned use of space. A commercial motivation for manned use of space is not wholly lacking. Materials scientists and pharmacologists may some day work in commercial microgravity laborato- ries; tourists may vacation in low earth orbit; the moon may be mined for minerals. But for a commerical motiva- tion to attract private investment, an infrastructure must be in place to limit investors' risks to those associated with its product. Several companies are working on the first element of that infrastructure: low cost access to space. Next generation systems like low orbit, packet switched communications satellites are counting on this low cost access, designing their system to be "dispos- able" both to reduce their system unit cost and to keep up with rapidly improving technology. When low cost access to space has proven its reliablity, manned commercial systems will be able to take advantage of it. However, rather than being disposable, manned systems will prob- ably rely on some on-orbit maintenance and repair as Mir does and the International Space Station will. Thus before a commercial motivation can become commercial manned activity, the space infrastructure must include the technology, operations procedures, and systems to cost- effectively service space assets, especially outside habit- able volumes. This infrastructure for EVA services, or "external work", should not mature as an afterthought to the design of the systems that will need it. Experience in the subsea ser- vices and aviation industry show that including maintain- able features in a system design can radically reduce its life cycle cost. Optimum maintainability must grow from experince maintaining systems under similar conditions, one of which is the cost pressures of commercial opera- tion. If commercial manned use of space requires an EVA ser- vices industry to achieve cost-effective operation, and if that industry itself requires a period of maturation in a commercial environment, neither may mature for want of the other. This paper will argue that the government can jumpstart a manned space sector of the economy by 543</page><page sequence="2">commercalizing EVA services for the assembly and main- tenance of the International Space Station. EVA SERVICES -The term "EVA services" encom- passes all work performed external to the space vehicle. Today we envisage EVA as an astronaut in a pressure suit working with hand tools. However when EVA ser- vices is envisioned functionally rather than descriptively, the human in the suit becomes a "work system," and only one of several work systems which might be employed in external work. For example, the Shuttle age and the dawning age of the International Space Station have shown the importance of remote manipulators such as the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System ~ the "arm" ~ operated from within the Shuttle. A recent Shuttle mission demonstrated the usefulness of having a "flying eyeball" looking over the astronaut's shoulder during EVA. By drawing on the experience of the subsea service industry, one may project future EVA work system to also include small, manned free floating vehicles operated from a shirt sleeve environment, with either anthropomorphic arms or special purpose tools, and special purpose robotic vehi- cles. EVA work systems could even be operated from ground stations with no humans within a hundred mile radius. This paper will present a plan, based on several relevant historical models, to move from the present government monopoly to a self-sustaining, commercial EVA services industry supporting a range of government and private customers. It will review how commercial practice might save enough money to insure a profit in a risky, danger- ous, and expensive business, and will compare the cost structure of NASA's EVA activities to that of a compara- ble endeavor: subsea diving services. LESSONS FROM THE PAST The discussion of commercializing EVA services does well to begin with an understanding of historical parallels. This section will examine the subsea service industry and commercial aviation to see how the transition from gov- ernment monopoly to thriving industry was accomplished and how these industries continue to grow together to the national benefit. The computer and pharmaceutical industries will be looked at more briefly as models of gov- ernment and industry cooperation in contemporary, high- tech industries. SUBSEA SERVICES - If space is the final frontier, the ocean floor is the last frontier on the planet. Even while the vast majority of the ocean floor remains unexplored, other areas produce vast wealth, especially in the oil industry. The technology to cost-effectively extract oil from this environment, which is every bit as remote, hos- tile, and alien as space, emerged from seven decades of a government - industry partnership in which technolo- gies and techniques flowed in both directions. The story of this partnership begins after World War I when then Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, decided to contract out the Navy's salvage operations. He sold four surplus minesweepers to a private salvage company at their scrap value then contracted back their services. Between the wars, this arrangement freed the Navy from the need to maintain salvage equipment, and allowed its sole-source contractor to make enough profit to reinvest in equipment upgrades. After the Pearl Harbor attack, the Navy quickly converted that established rela- tionship into an arrangement in which the salvage equip- ment was leased from and salvage operations conducted by its contractor under the direction of a naval officer. As early as 1924, the Navy had explored using a helium oxygen breathing gas mix to reduce the risk of deep water diving, but large scale use of this technology waited until the 1 970's when a commercial demand for it arose from the need to drill for oil in the deep waters off the Cal- ifornia coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. When North Sea oil required divers to go deeper still, commercial interests adapted and improved the Navy equipment and tech- niques. The Navy subsequently adopted these improve- ments. The Navy's experiments with sea bottom habitats in the 1960 was abandoned after the death of a diver in 1969. The technology languished until the North Sea oil fields demanded a pressurized haven for its divers to allow them to work despite the violent, changeable weather that was making operations prohibitively expensive. Commercial companies improved upon what the Navy had invented. When the Navy sought to salvage ships and planes in the deep water off the coast of North Viet- nam, they took advantage of the technology improve- ments made by the oil industry. Naval requirements for underwater ordinance work lead them to develop, in the 1960s, a family of submersible remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) called Mermut. They soon decided that pushing ROV technology into deep water was a task better suited to private industry, so they contracted for the design, construction, and operation of the first Deep Drone. Diving companies quickly adapted the technology to allow them to operate in waters too deep for any human operations. The subsea service industry now has hundreds of specialized ROVs that have extended the reach and capability of human activity under water. Subsea industry today exploits this array of government- initiated systems to perform operations that are at least as expensive and difficult as a manned space mission. A case study in reference [2] shows how the activities of an 8-man diving crew is the focus of a $975 million invest- ment to tap a relatively small oil reserve in 350 feet of seawater off the coast of Africa. Planning as intricate as Shuttle mission planning insured the success of this endeavor. The equipment included a modified drilling rig from Denmark; an 8-man saturation diving system, underwater television system, underwater burning gear, and a hydraulic power unit with 600' of hose and assorted 544</page><page sequence="3">tools from England; a 420' long, 85 ton caisson with nine 10" diameter riser pipes, 18 smaller pipes, joining pieces, and electronic and hydraulic control lines for the final sys- tem; bottom habitats and ROVs; bolts, jacks, winches, and pulling sleds to lower, place, and join the rig on the bottom; tow ships, pipelay vessels, winch platforms, and other specialized ships from as far away as east Asia; and all the mundane necessities needed to the feed and provide hygiene and entertainment for the divers and their surface support crew over the five month operation. The failure of such an endeavor would have had an finan- cial impact no less than the failure of a Shuttle mission. The crushing pressures, enormous moving masses, and complicated operations of underwater work make it among the most dangerous work environments. Yet the threat of liability lawsuits has effectively enforced safety standards on the subsea service industry by giving it a financial incentive to meet these dangers with cost-effec- tive technology, operations, and training. In recent years, industrial fatalities among subsea works have all but dis- appeared, demonstrating that safety and cost conscious- ness are not incompatible. COMMERCIAL AVIATION - Although the airplane was a private invention, the government was in the vanguard of exploiting it for serious purposes. In the first few decades of its existence, profit making with the airplane was lim- ited barnstorming, joy rides, and airshows. Such develop- ment as occurred was focused on improving it for these applications. In 1912, the Post Office decided to include the airplane as part of its mail delivery system, even thought the train was faster, less expensive, and more reliable. The advantages of the airplane as a vehicle for warfighting, though not fully realized in World War I, was an additional government impetus to aviation, After the war, the Post Office took advantage of the new supply of planes and pilots to expand airmail service, added radio equipment for weather information, and lighted airfields to help pilots land in inclement weather. Yet despite these invest- ments, while airmail remained a government monopoly, commercial exploitation of the airplane did not advance. In 1926, Congress made the pivotal decision to turn over its airmail fleet to private contractors whose profitability would depend on getting a certain weight of mail between two points. The pressure for reliable, all weather delivery caused innovators to develop tech- niques for flying by reference to instruments alone, tech- niques that have since evolved into the instrument flight rules (IFR) that are crucial to modern aviation. Another pivotal decision came in 1927 when the post office replaced its complicated air mail rate structure with a simple ten cent stamp. The volume of airmail suddenly increased enormously, expanding the commercial oppor- tunities for aviation. The stamp, however, didn't cover the cost of the airmail; for several years, airmail was a thinly disguised subsidy to the aviation industry. The new volume and profitability of airmail inspired men like William Boeing to design new planes with closed cockpits to carry the larger volumes of mail. Soon these planes were large enough to permit passenger service. Again, the government helped spur the air transport industry by allowing passenger planes to carry airmail in available space. This additional revenue provided the margin of profitability that allowed the fledgling airline industry to survive until passenger transport developed a momentum of its own. Boeing's and Douglas's passenger airplanes were easily adapted to military transport and bombing during World War II. The military pushed the design of engines and airframes to their limits to meet the exigencies of war. The jet engine, which grew out of the military's need for more speed and power, provided the leap in efficiency that finally, in the 1960's, set the airline industry on its way to becoming a central feature of modern economic activity. Military and civilian aviation have advanced together in the succeeding decades. Military innovations like graph- ite composites, which were developed to improve fighter aircraft, helped lighten civilian aircraft during the oil shocks of the 1970s. The military's global positioning system has revolutionized civilian air navigation, making it simple, reliable, and almost fool proof. For its part, the military relies on America's fleet of commercial aircraft to move troops quickly into operating theaters, relieving them of the need to maintain troop transports dedicated to that role. Technology and operational developments in one arena move smoothly into the other. From the beginning, the prospect of using the airplane for large scale passenger transport presented a commercial motivation to develop such an industry, but the industry did not develop until government decisions and invest- ments provided a structure within which it could grow. Daredevil barnstormers in their Jenny's were the wrong men with the wrong planes in the wrong business to con- ceive of and nurture an air transport industry. The gov- ernment's airmail subsidy was key to jumpstarting the serious, commercial use of air transport. Even today, the private sector looks to the government for the key invest- ments which propeli their industries. COMPUTERS - Private investment by such capitalist icons as Apple, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, and Netscape has brought electronic and information technology to every segment of modern society, but it is not widely known that this technology has its roots in government investments. An obscure agency of the Department of Defense, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has funded over 80% of the basic research in computer science in recent decades. DARPA's sponsorship has been responsible for key advances in semiconductor materials technology, on-chip integration, the local area net, and data transfer protocols. Indeed, the Internet started life as the ARPA-net. 545</page><page sequence="4">DARPA's mandate is to stay at the very front edge of technology, to invest in the most futuristic ~ and riskiest ~ technologies, and accept a certain percentage of failure as the cost of doing business. DARPA accomplishes this not through direct activity but by funding research at insti- tutions around the country. Innovators from industry, uni- versities, and government laboratories bring their ideas to DARPA. If DARPA judges them technically sound and potential important to the national interest, DARPA will provide the funding to demonstrate its feasibility and potential. After that, private interests or other govern- ment users are expected to continue developing the tech- nology into a useful product. DARPA's investment has been the keystone to building the computer industry. Like the literal keystone, it is finally a small fraction of the investment available in the structure of the industry but, coming as it does early in the process, it has played a central role in establishing the direction and momentum of that industry. PHARMACEUTICALS - Like the computer industry, the pharmaceutical industry is making enormous changes in life and culture of modern society. Huge amounts of pri- vate capital are invested to bring powerful new drugs into the physician's arsenal. However, the science upon which the industry is based is often done under govern- ment sponsorship. Organizations like the National Insti- tutes of Health and the National Science Foundation underwrite the fundamental research that private compa- nies exploit to create valuable products. Without this public investment, medical research would likely be directed toward narrowly focused objectives that have the clear potential for profit; society would miss the funda- mental research that has, time and again, proven to be essential to medical breakthroughs. LESSON FOR EVA SERVICES - History shows that a commercial motivation alone is not sufficient to start an industry in a risky new arena. Most thriving sectors of the American economy depend on some form of government support: • patronage in the form of contracted services like the early subsea salvage industry or the research grants which maintain the vitality of American university research. • subsidy like that which began the early air transport industry or the land grants which established Amer- ica's rail transport Industry. • leading edge research and development like that for electronics and pharmecuticals. • public infrastructure as in the case of the automobile and airline industries. • tax breaks like those for the purchase of private homes, or for oil explortation and alternative energy source development in the 1970's. • government-sanctioned and -contolled monopolies for utilities like telephone, water, power, and cable television to permit them to establish themselves. • licensing of public resources like the electromagnetic spectrum to preclude chaos. • regulation, oversight, and enforcement to insure pub- lic trust like the financial, food, and drug industries. The question for an EVA services industry, then, is not whether the government should have a role in helping to create it, but what that role should be and how it should be implemented. The conclusion that emerges from the historical survey of the mechanics of government - industry interaction points to the importance of government investment when finan- cial risks are highest and technology is least mature. Once the technology passes a certain threshold of matu- rity, private capital can exploit it more quickly and inte- grate it into the structure of economic life. This division of responsibility can be summarized succinctly: govern- ment explores, industry exploits. The past forty years of manned space flight have been an exploration of its technologies and potential, and there- fore largely appropriate for government funding. How- ever, spaceflight has now becomes routine enough to transition to manned exploitation of space if an appropri- ate profit motive can be divined. A MARGIN FOR PROFIT NASA has sunk billions of dollars into manned space- flight without particularly expecting a return on its invest- ment. Although not oblivious to the need to find practical applications for manned spaceflight, most of NASA's investment strategy has been oriented towards abstract goals like science, exploration, and national prestige. This has led to operations and technologies that do not rigorously weigh cost against payback. Before private concerns will step up to the expenses of commercial EVA services, they must be convinced that a customer base will exist if services can be rendered at a reasonable cost, and that enough costs can be trimmed from the present structure of EVA operations to permit servicing to compete with both excruciatingly reliable technology on the high end and disposable assets on the low end. MARKETS -A 1988 Commerce Department study [3] identified products which could be manufactured in space. A 1994 study by a consortium from the aerospace industry [4] identified a range of market opportunities which could be realized if low cost, reliable launch ser- vices become available. Assuming these launch services do mature as hoped, a certain percentage of these mar- kets will require or desire EVA services. 546</page><page sequence="5">Near Term Markets - The International Space Station (ISS) will need extensive EVA services both during its assembly and while it is operating routinely. All current planning presumes that external maintenance will be done by government astronauts. However, this paper will argue that ISS external servicing is an excellent first mar- ket for commercial EVA services. Servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is another area that might well benefit from a commercial approach to EVA. HST servicing tasks will be similar each time they are performed. Furthermore, the HST users are highly cost-constrained: money not spent on servicing can be spent on science. Although not a large enough market in itself to begin the EVA servicing indus- try, HST servicing will be an excellent learning experi- ence for this class of satellite and could be an important cost control factor. An EVA service provider might also rent the facilities of the Space Shuttle to repair or refurbish commercial satel- lites under a private contract that includes the Space Transportation System only as a contract carrier. If EVA services were available from a contractor rather than the government, satellite designers might replace reliability with reparability when costs trades favor that approach. Such compromises could permit reductions in the cost of space hardware. In the near term, only operation in low earth orbit is feasi- ble. Scientific and commercial payloads which are either resident in low orbit or which have failed to deploy to their proper, higher orbit, could be rescued and repaired by a commercial EVA service provider. EVA training and operation of training facilities are other areas on the periphery of EVA services which lend them- selves to commercialization. The Neutral Buoyancy Sim- ulator at Marshall Space Flight Center has recently been offered for commercialization, and although it is currently seen as surpfluous to NASA's needs, will provide a com- mercial alternative for some aspects of EVA training if needed. Mid Term Markets - Many expensive communications, navigation, and surveillance satellites are located above low earth orbit. It is unlikely that humans will be able to cost-effectively service them in the mid term because of the cost of getting mass to these orbits, and their location outside the protection of the magnetosphere. However, it is possible that these satellites could be serviced by remotely operated machines resident in those orbits. If these assets are initially designed for remote servicing, and if confidence in remote servicing can be gained in low earth orbit, they are a potentially rich market for EVA services. The astronomical community is already planning an array of telescopes from the xray to the microwave that will be on orbit 5 to 10 years hence. Because of the long lead times involved in fielding space systems, the technology in these instruments will be several years behind the state of the art on the day it is launched. The ability to upgrade these will permit the scientific community to incrementally improve the performance of its assets when scientific need and technical ability warrant. An astronomical asset on orbit can then become analogous to an observatory or accelerator on earth: the shell around which many activities and instruments are built for many users over the course of generations. High orbit satellites stand to make strides in their own cost-effectiveness as EVA services are available. Their launch costs are so high that they have to be extremely reliable across longer and longer lives. This expense flows down demands for more reliable launch services, and those more reliable launch services push up launch costs. On-orbit servicing could break into this cost-reli- ability spiral. Far Term Markets - Many futurists believe that a day will come when tourism is a major economic activity in space. Hotels, hospitals, and movie studios will each want to serve its customers with its own technical specialty, be it hospitality, medicine, or cinematics. They will wish to contract out "building maintenance" to someone with experience in the space environment. The EVA services industry could grow into more generalized space opera- tions with responsibility for refuel and reboost scheduling, internal maintenance, and perhaps contingency plan- ning. Private on-orbit factories, research laboratories, and power-generation stations could be enabled if their corporate sponsors had access to a reliable maintenance capability. Realizing the Potential Markets - Despite the commercial potential of space, and despite the investments NASA has made in EVA technology and operations, the time is not yet right to expect a service industry to emerge on its own. PhD civil service astronauts with hand tools per- forming one-of-a-kind tasks out of the Shuttle bay may be the wrong people with the wrong equipment in the wrong environment to begin the industry. Like the subsea sal- vage industry and airmail in the 1920's, the EVA service industry must be nurtured in its infancy with continued government involvement. However, there are reasons to believe that even in its infancy, the government stands to save money by relying on the cost-sensitivity that comes with commercial operations. GOVERNMENT VS. COMMERCIAL APPROACH - If the Navy were to salvage an airplane that went down off the coast of San Diego, it would dispatch a ship with a stan- dard complement of 1 00 and a special mission team of 25. A commercial contractor brought in to salvage the same airplane would send out a specialized ship with a crew of twenty and a mission team of fifteen. The mem- bers of the mission team would be paid far better than their naval counterparts, but they would be paid only for the hours they worked, drastically reducing the com- pany's overhead costs. The cost of the operation could therefore be cut 2/3 to 3/4. These kinds of efficiencies 547</page><page sequence="6">are possible with a commercial operation but not within government structures. For space operations, these costs differences stand to be no less impressive. Management and Planning - In the past 20 years, the subsea service industry has learned an important lesson in the cost effectiveness of remote operation. While divers can do many things that remotely operated vehi- cles (ROVs) cannot, divers require expensive support and logistics to insure their safety. The subsea service industry has developed detailed cost models to quickly estimate the most cost-effective mix of work systems, including both divers and a wide range of ROVs with varying capabilities. The models account for both the capabilities of the work system and the cost of logistical support, including ROV operators and diver safety sup- port personnel. Sometimes ROVs can do the job entirely without divers: divers rarely perform routine video inspec- tions any more. Usually a mix of divers and ROVs work- ing together proves to be most cost-effective. Once the option of using subsea ROVs became avail- able, oil platforms designers made provisions for servic- ing them with ROVs. High contrast labels and targets, machine friendly fixtures and joints, and machine mount points all added little to the cost of the structure but saved greatly in subsequent maintenance costs. NASA has taken some steps to insure the machine com- patibility of ISS external work sites. Orbital replaceable units (ORUs) are provided with a microconical fitting which can be grappled with either hand tools or manipu- lator end effectors. However so far, only a few of work system are available to perform external work; astronauts in pressure suits are expected to be the mainstay well into the ISS era. With the incentive to cut costs wherever possible, a commercial EVA service provider would be motivated to develop ROVs to replace humans when appropriate, even as the subsea service industry has done. Personnel - Astronauts today are scientific and technical professionals of the highest caliber. Most have a Ph.D. or thousands of hours flying high performance aircraft. However, these skills are largely superfluous to the demands of an EVA service technician. Such a techni- cian should have manual strength and dexterity, good mechanical skill, a cool head under pressure, and the ability to learn and adapt quickly. No college degree or pilot's license is required. Narrow specialists with spe- cific talents and well-honed skills stand to be more cost- effective than broad generalists like the astronauts. Many subsea service companies only pay their divers for billable hours, which drastically reduces the cost of over- head. Sometimes experienced divers are integrated into other support functions when not billing directly, functions such as operations planning, training, and equipment development. Their input into equipment development is particularly valuable. While not usually engineers, divers are mechanically astute and bring the perspective of actual experience to changes in equipment. Their input, including hands-on modifications of the systems they themselves use under water, allows these changes to be rapid and responsive. Similarly in operations planning, experienced divers can suggest innovative approaches to improve the efficiency of their work. Such efficiencies and synergism might well be possible with a commercial EVA services provider. Training - Thirty-two percent the NASA's EVA budget goes to training; less than one percent of a comparable portion of a subsea service provider's budget goes to training. NASA trains astronauts exhaustively to accom- plish a single task, repeating it and every contingency until it becomes routine. The subsea service provider hires technicians with existing skills like diving and weld- ing, gained at the employee's expenses, and supple- ments those skills with on-the-job training in an apprenticeship-like arrangement. While space external work remains a series of one-of-a-kind operations ~ the repairs of Solar Max or the Hubble Space Telescope will never be exactly repeated ~ task-specific training is justi- fied. But as EVA operations move into an era when tasks are often similar and skills can be transferred to other tasks, skill-based training will become increasingly more cost-effective. The typical EVA astronaut will perform two or three EVAs in his or her entire career. Skills gained, therefore, do not mature into a broad experience base. An EVA service technician will presumably develop a larger experience base that can shorten or eliminate the need for task- based training. Subsea experience shows that a diver's learning curve extends over several years, with the diver becoming progressively more adept and efficient as time goes on. Experience aboard the Mir shows the a time required to perform an EVA task fell almost 50% by the fourth repetition, and the metabolic energy needed for that task was reduced to 72% in one case and 60% in another [5]. Safety - In an attempt to institutionalize safety, NASA has established a safety bureaucracy with as many as 4000 people, and procedures designed to foreclose even the smallest possibility of injury. The results have been undeniably effective but cost about $350 million/year [6]. The subsea service industry, however, has a very small safety bureaucracy, preferring instead to invest the responsibility for safety in front-line supervisors, diver and operator teams, and management at every level. Manag- ers' pay is often incentivized by their safety record. With a considerably smaller investment, the subsea service industry has largely eliminated serious injuries and fatali- ties from its operations even though divers spend tens of thousands of hours under water each year. The single biggest factors in the improving safety record of the subsea service industry is the growing experience base of on-site personnel. As divers ~ and especially teams of divers ~ gain more workaday experience, their 548</page><page sequence="7">accident rate falls without the need for rigid procedures that stifle efficiency and Innovation. As with the subsea service industry, existing liability laws will provide incentives for an EVA service provider to maintain safety even while pursuing cost reduction. An EVA service provider would probably begin with NASA's established procedures but, as experience increases, would have more latitude to tailor those procedures in ways which meet the tests of both effectiveness and cost. Technology - Since NASA's mandate is to explore rather than to exploit, they have little incentive to undertake the kinds of incremental improvements on equipment that shave a few percent off the cost of systems. Each new NASA development program has to be justified, advo- cated, staffed, and controlled in a way that stands up to public scrutiny. This discourages smali innovations and incremental improvements, and drastically slows the response time for incorporating new technology. In a commercial environment, however, the contractor would have the freedom to develop, modify, or buy new work systems with no more scrutiny than a layer or two of management for most small things, and corporate approval for larger items. A contractor interested in turn- ing a profit will be pleased with any improvement in cost- effectiveness, knowing that such improvements accumu- late over time and that small increases in the bottom line are magnified by the price/earnings ratio in the value of its stock. The subsea service industry has discovered that the costs of operation with humans are lower when a range of support equipment is available. Conventional scuba gear, saturation diving outfits, one-atmosphere hard suits with or without anthropomorphic arms, and one-man sub- marines all have a place in safe, cost-effective completion of the job. This lesson probably applies to EVA. While NASA may accept the time wasted in prebreathe and air- lock operations as part of its overhead, a profit driven contractor might have its EVA service technician work outside the space craft in a 1 -person, 1 -atmosphere ser- vice pod to eliminate the prebreathe overhead. Some EVA equipment simplifications have been taken out of discussion based on astronaut preferences. If the astronauts would wear an oral-nasal mask the way divers and fighter pilots do, the scrubber / dryer in the space suit would be more efficient and the criticality 1 fan could be eliminated. If space suit gloves were not required to have five fingers, the suit could be operated at a higher pres- sure, reducing or eliminating the need to pre-breathing pure oxygen. A commercial EVA service provider would have the option of reexamining such choices to determin- ing whether cost-effectiveness could be enhanced with different approaches. Under the glare of national publicity, NASA has many non-financial incentives to insure that its systems operate reliably. They pay for extremely high reliability with a paperwork overhead. Rather than try to insure reliability, the subsea service industry places its emphasis on robustness, which also includes maintainability and the ability to function despite damage, abuse, or partial fail- ures. Especially when service technicians have enough experience to fix broken equipment on the spot or work around degraded equipment, the requirement for abso- lute reliability its expensive paperwork it should be mark- edly reduced. Insurance - Much of the cost of space systems traces to the fact that the government must insure itself. With hun- dreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer assets at risk, the government does everything possible to preclude fail- ure. Again, this assurance generally comes at the cost of a quality system that documents, traces, and tests each piece of hardware exhaustively, without any test of cost- effectiveness. The story of the Global Positioning System (GPS) clock suggests how much this self-insurance actually costs. [7] A clock with pico-second precision, developed for com- mercial applications, sold for about $25,000. The unit could be hardened and made space compatible for a sell- ing price of $50,000. However, when required for use in GPS, the unit sold for $300,000 because of the paper- work, supplier certification and tracking, customer sup- port, reviews, testing, and so forth that went with the designation "Space Qualified". A German company bought an identical clock for use in space but without the paperwork overhead for $50,000. At least in the near term, an EVA service provider would be working on and with expensive pieces of government hardware. The contractor should not be taking risks at the taxpayers' expense, but neither should the govern- ment dictate quality assurance procedures as a precondi- tion for working around such equipment. The EVA service provider must be allowed to use commercial means of underwriting risk to insure the taxpayers against negli- gence while retaining full freedom to manage according to best business practice. In a mature industry, insurance costs would balance operational efficiencies based on actuarial experience. Until the industry matures, the emerging experience of commercial satellite vendors and launch service providers should be used as a model for EVA services. Cost Savings Roll-up - Despite the many reasons to believe that commercial operation will reduce the cost of EVA services, it is not yet possible to roll up a bottom line that demonstrates this conclusively. Such estimates wait on the development of a body of experience which can- not precede the transition to commercial EVA services. The subsea services industry has realized economies on the order of 2/3 to 3/4 vis a vis the Navy for salvage oper- ations, and there are reasons to believe that similar sav- ings will be realized in a mature EVA services industry. COST STRUCTURE COMPARISON - Lacking specific information on the cost saving, however, doesn't preclude us from drawing conclusions about how the cost structure 549</page><page sequence="8">may change with commercialization of EVA services. A 1996 study [2] examined the cost structure of a commer- cial subsea services company, Oceaneering International Incorporated's (Oil's) Oil Field Marine Services for the America's Region in company fiscal year 95 and com- pared it with NASA's budget for EVA in the same period. The comparison is appropriate because both EVA and subsea servicing have been maturing for about 30 years; both work in exceedingly hostile and foreign environ- ments; both work from isolated, self-sustaining habitats; and the cost of work time is extremely high in both cases. In the year in question, the Oil division performed over 8000 hours of hyperbaric diving, 410 hours of undersea work in one-atmosphere submersibles, and about 10,200 hours of ROV operation. Revenues on the order of $29.5 million were realized against expenses of $23.4, not including capital expenses of $6 million. Cost data were available in 205 specific categories ranging from the cost of licenses and tethers, to food, fuel, and breathing gas consumption, to telephone calls and postage. Figure 1 shows a breakout of the Oil revenue into major constitu- ents. Figure 1 . Subsea service provider revenue breakout. In government fiscal year 1995, NASA estimates that it spent $102 million in support of EVA. In this time frame, NASA maintained the capability to perform two to three, two-person EVAs on six to eight Shuttle missions per year. NASA costs were much more difficult to track pre- cisely. Data on civil service labor and overhead are not collected at all. Direct costs were broken out into five broad categories: hardware acquisition, training, hard- ware turn-around, facility maintenance, and sustaining expertise/engineering. Figure 2 shows a breakout of the NASA costs into these five factors. Figure 2. NASA EVA expenditures. To make a direct comparison between Figures 1 and 2, the 205 categories of Oil expense were matrixed into the five NASA categories plus two more categories called "Personnel" and "Infrastructure and Overhead"; these lat- ter two categories not being tracked by NASA. Figure 3 shows the resulting distribution of costs and extracts just that part which can be directly compared with NASA's cost structure. Figure 4 compares the NASA and Oil cost structures. Note the relative magnitudes of the two. Figure 3. Subsea service provider costs equated to NASA EVA costs. 550</page><page sequence="9">Figure 4. Comparison between subsea service provider and NASA's EVA cost structures. Several conclusions emerge from this analysis. The two biggest costs of Oil's commercial operations, personnel and overhead, are not even tracked by NASA. Of the per- centage that remains, NASA spends the largest portion in training, while Oil spends it in hardware acquisition. This difference reflects the exploratory nature of NASA's EVA mission, with its intensive, task-based training, and expensive, special purpose facilities. Oil's emphasis on hardware acquisition reflects its need to supplement and support human capabilities to find the most cost-effective mix for the task at hand. DISCUSSION OF DIFFERENCES - Today's EVA opera- tions are about at the level of maturity subsea operations achieved in 1975. In 1975, divers were the primary work system, remote operations were limited to use of a few simple work systems which supported the diver directly, and very limited accommodations were available to the diver. The energy crises of the 1970's and '80's spurred the subsea service industry to make extraction of under- sea oil more economical. The competition to service this industry spurred innovation in cost reduction which led to a wider range of hardware options to reduce cost. The large relative cost of hardware acquisition reflects some unique needs of subsea service work: purchase or lease of specialized equipment; consumable supplies like welding rod, oxygen for oxy-arc cutting, inspection dies, and special breathing gases. Since this hardware is used at a higher rate, more replacement is required. Clearly, economies of scale have yet to become a factor in EVA systems. However, scale alone cannot account for cost differences. There are no more than about 30 atmo- spheric diving systems (ADS) in use world wide, a num- ber comparable to the number of extra-vehicular mobility units (EMUs), but an ADS has a purchase cost of about $350,000, while a full EMU is estimated at about $10 mil- lion. Finally it cannot be denied that there are cost factors inherent in government operations which increase the cost beyond anything the commercial sector should be expected to bear. These factors were well summarized in 1995 congressional testimony by Diedre Lee, NASA Associate Administrator for Procurement. Her words merit quoting at length [8]: There are four basis tenants to government procure- ment. These are different - although in varying degrees - from the way individuals and commercial firms spend money. The first tenet is that of responsibility and account- ability. Each of us in our personal lives is responsible for our fiscal behavior. Yet if we do not make an ideal choice, only we bear the responsibility. In a govern- ment environment, the taxpayer bears the cost, which may be substantial. ... In order to fulfill that responsibility and prevent mistakes people seek additional information and data, and they set up structured systems and reviews. The second tenant is that of fairness and openness. ... Because NASA is spending taxpayer funds, all interested companies must be afforded an opportu- nity to participate. ... Instead of relying on informa- tion readily available, full and open competition is described as placing a national notice, waiting a pre- scribed time for responses, evaluation all responses and fully documenting all considerations and deci- sion. This is important, but it also requires a sub- stantial commitment of time and money by all parties involved ~ including those parties that do not get the contract. The third tenant is that of socioeconomic provisions. ... The United States has chosen to emphasize many important social and economic policies. These policies are effected and enforced wherever tax dol- lars are expended. ... A typical government solicita- tion contains an average of 15 certifications and representations. Special clauses require reporting, assurances and special systems. ... Numerous Con- gresses and administrations have determined that 551</page><page sequence="10">these are valuable and necessary conditions of doing business with the government but they do increase costs and make doing business with the government different. The final tenant is that of protests. ... In government, any interested party may demand a legal review of a selection decision. At that point, all progress usually halts. ... This is often difficult and costly for the gov- ernment, as schedules slip, concurrent actions must be delayed or adjusted and the program costs increases. Spending taxpayer funds is no light responsibility and the importance of good, sound business decisions cannot be overemphasized. However, we have led ourselves to overregulation and a conservative, slow- moving process. A PLAN FOR THE FUTURE THE STRATEGY- An EVA service industry is an ele- ment of a space infrastructure which, if lacking, will inhibit commercial development of space. Without tested EVA servicing systems and proven procedures, commercial developers cannot build systems to intelligently anticipate servicing which minimizes life cycle cost. The threshhold of cost-effective space operation will remain higher than otherwise, postponing or eliminating prospective com- mercial ventures. To jump-start this industry, the govern- ment should commercialize the one, near-term market for EVA servicing that does exist: maintenance of the Inter- national Space Station. ISS assembly and maintenance planning is already advanced; these plans need not be reversed for the sake of commercialization. The government should select a sole source contractor, as the Navy did in the 1 920's, and turn over to it or sell at a nominal value some fraction of the existing EMUs, tools, and EVA support equipment. The first contract between the provider and the govern- ment should emphasize profit rewards for efficient perfor- mance, with government cost reductions coming only after the contractor has established its viability. During the assembly phase of ISS, the government and its contractor should work side by side, the contractor learning the elements of working in space and on the ISS from the government. The contractor's portion of the work should steadily increase during the course of ISS assembly, with the goal of taking over ail ISS mainte- nance by the time assembly is complete. HST servicing should also be specifically targeted for commercialization. Commercial service technicians should work along side astronauts at the next service opportunity with the expectation of transition to full com- mercial service at the following service opportunity. In this phase, it is imperative that the government allow its contractor the maximum latitude to adjust procedures and equipment for cost-effectiveness. Government work orders should strive to specify only what must be accom- plished, not how it is to be accomplished. The contractor will, at private expense, be developing special purpose tools and management systems, and making improve- ments to equipment as appear to be justified by its profit- ability. This period would see no change in EVA research and development activities. Table 1 show how this commercialization should proceed from this beginning. In the near to mid term, the govern- ment may wish to encourage competition by promoting the involvement of another contractor in areas like train- ing or satellite servicing from the Shuttle bay. The origi- nal contractor will presumably be purchasing equipment from commercial suppliers. The existence of these sup- pliers should lower the entry barrier to new service com- panies. Table 1 .

The contractor commu- nity would have largely assumed the responsibility for continuing evolution of its equipment, though research on futuristic equipment would remain a government role. In the far term, the government would continue to support the kind of research and high risk technology that it does in aeronautics, electronics, and medical research. Pre- sumably advances in these areas would be made with the cooperation of the EVA service provider and/or its suppliers. A service provider would be in a good position to field test technology advances before they are used on distant planets. THE FIRST STEPS -With the confidence inspired by past successful transitions from government exploration to private exploitation and a strategy that builds on those lessons, with the expectation that commercializing EVA services will ultimately save the government money, and 552</page><page sequence="11">with the conviction that commercial EVA services are essential to America's future in space, the steps toward implementing EVA commercialization are now clear. The first step, and the most difficult, is a firm decision to proceed despite established interests. NASA must allow the possibility that there will be another whole category of spacefarer, "blue-collar" workers responsible to and paid by private companies, workers whose skills and training reflect not the best the nation can offer but the pragmatic requirements for the job. The nation must cease to expect all its spacefarers to be national heroes and come to understand them as people with a job to do who hap- pen to work in space. NASA must retrench around its exploration mission and devolve the exploitation tasks to private industry. To insure permanence and public acceptance, this policy should be enunciated and advo- cated by the political leadership. A policy must be developed to specify how an EVA ser- vices provider will indemnify itself against damage to gov- ernment assets. The launch services industry should supply a good model for this. The policy must allow the provider the latitude to employ best business practices but still insure that taxpayers' property will not be endan- gered for the sake of private profit. This approach must be agreed to by the international partners who have sig- nificant assets at risk. NASA should begin preparing the mechanics of transi- tion. Flights should be identified for the first joint mis- sions, an announcement of opportunity should be published, equipment for transition should be identified. Once the transition is underway, NASA should restruc- ture its R&amp;D investment strategy to focus more on gener- ational improvements in equipment, development of revolutionary technology, and support for exploration mis- sions. EVA training facilities and equipment should be fully privatized: NASA should back completely out of the spec- ification and operation of such facilities and contract for their use on a strictly competitive basis. These facilities include the Neutral Buoyancy Lab at the Johnson Space Center, the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator at Marshall Space Flight Center, and the KC-135 reduced gravity simulation aircraft. With multiple training facilities avail- able, the EVA services provider will be in a better position to optimize its training costs, and the training facility pro- vider will have a cost motivation to improve its efficiency. Beyond these first, large steps are a host of smaller steps appropriate to implementing these policies, but these steps will be more clear and compelling once the process of commercialization has begun. CONCLUSION A thriving economic sector based in space cannot exist without an EVA service industry to support it. The assem- bly and maintenance of the International Space Station offers an opportunity to begin that industry in the next few years. An established EVA services industry should open the space sector to opportunities we cannot yet fully con- ceive. The sooner the process begins, the sooner we will begin to reap the economic benefit.
