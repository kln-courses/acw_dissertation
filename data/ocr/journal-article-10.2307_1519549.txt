<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK LIST 373 Gonzalez, Professor of O.T. and Hebrew Language at the UPCM, died in a road accident in August 1986, leaving practically completed an annotated Castilian translation of the major medieval Hebrew commentators on Amos. This has now been published, with the addition of a clear and helpful introduction by Maria Teresa Ortega Monasterio. The biblical text (in the version of the Alba Bible) is presented verse by verse, followed by a "catena" of medieval comments, which are themselves carefully annotated. This form of presentation renders the volume easy to consult, and brings into interesting relief the different characteristics of the various commentaries. [N. R. M. DE LANGE] G. W. SAVRAN, Telling and Retelling. Quotation in Biblical Narrative. Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature. xii + 161 pp. Indiana University Press, Bloom- ington and Indianapolis, 1988. The particular form of quotations studied in this revised version of a Brandeis University dissertation is that where a speaker repeats his own or another's words to a third party. Notable examples of this device are found in Gen. xxiv and the Joseph story, but they are also frequent else- where. Such quotations may be labelled either "verifiable" if the words are repeated from an earlier passage or "unverifiable" if they are not. The interest of the study arises from the fact that frequently the words are not quoted exactly, so that narrative and contextual considerations come into play to help explain the differences. Limiting his analysis to the narratives of Genesis to 2 Kings, Savran first summarizes such formal features as the introductory formulae used, who is quoting whom to whom, and so on. The bulk of the work is then discussed under two main headings: "story analysis", which studies quotations from the point of view of the characters within the narrative, and "discourse analysis", which studies them from the point of view of the narrator's communication with his reader. An appendix deals separately with the particular and frequent use of this phenomenon in the book of Deuteronomy. [H. G. M. WILLIAMSON] W. H. SCHMIDT, Exodus, Sinai und Mose. Erwdgungen zu Exodus 1-19 und 24. Ertrage der Forschung 191. viii + 165 pp. Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt, 1983. DM 37.50; for members DM 22. The research reviewed here relates not so much to the composition of the book of Exodus (though Schmidt clearly continues to find the existence of the sources J and E a necessary hypothesis) as to traditio-historical questions about the role of Moses and the foun- dations of Israelite religion. Schmidt provides a useful introduction to the modern discussion about Moses but, as he is aware, few solutions: the caution in historical reconstruction introduced by M. Noth's questions remains influential. Never- theless, like other recent scholars he is unconvinced by the theory that the exodus and Sinai traditions were originally separate and, in a final chapter which follows the treatment of the various sections of the Exodus narrative, he examines in some detail the possibility that the "Midian tradition" forms an additional bond between Israel in Egypt and at Sinai and a proof that Moses is an original element of both episodes.

Univer- sitiitsverlag, Freiburg, Switzerland; and Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, G6ttingen, 1987. Schroer's book is a publication of her dissertation (1986). After a brief intro- duction in which she looks at the history of the subject, the problem, and the pic- tures in Israel and the ban on representations, she considers in ch. 1 sculptures in the shape of trees, flowers and fruit. In her first section she discusses Asherah and asherahs in the O.T. The second section discusses the decorative element of the flora in the formation of Solomon's temple. Ch. 2 examines sculpture in the form of animals and mixed beings, including cherubim, sphinxes, stag demons, teraphim and ephod. Ch. 3 discusses O.T. reports of anthropomorphic depictions</page><page sequence="2">374 BOOK LIST of nature, with sub-sections on the crown of Milcom; the statue of the god Dagon; wall reliefs, engravings, and pictures of jewelry in the book of Ezekiel; the "idols of the people" and their production in the books of Jeremiah and Isaiah; idols in the Song of Songs and Daniel; and idols of the foreign peoples. Ch. 4 is concerned with pictures of astral deities in Israel and Judah, and ch. 5 discusses the semantic field of "picture/idol" in the O.T. In ch. 6, Schroer examines the importance of the O.T. in mentioning objects which support images, and discusses stones, ivory ceramics, textiles, seals and amulets. Her final chapter is on O.T. reports of Israelite artwork and artisans. She provides an extensive bibliography and 146 figures. Schroer's book is a fine overview of art in ancient Israel. She has collected much information which is useful for a study of the iconography of the period. Because of the breadth of her topic, she of course is not able to discuss everything in detail, but she is able to point the reader in the right direction, and summarizes well the previous scholarly opinion on the subject matter. [Judith M. HADLEY] E. SCHUjRER, A History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ (175 B.C. - A.D. 135): a new English version revised and edited by G. Vermes, F. Millar, M. Goodman, P. Vermes (Literary Editor) and M. Black (Organizing Editor) III.2. xix + 310 pp. (page numbering continuous with III.1) T. &amp; T. Clark Ltd, Edin- burgh, 1987. ?19.95. In a review of vol. III.1 (VT 38 [1988], pp. 239-43) it was noted, among other general comments not repeated here, that the difference between this English version and its predecessor reflects Schurer's own changes for the third edition of the German volume III (Leipzig, 1909) as well as the new editorial revisions. That remains true, but the revised English vol. III.2 includes particularly notable editorial additions. The new sub-section 33B brings together parts of the old sections 32 and 33 con- cerned with Jewish literature of which the original language is deemed uncertain. The editors responsible are G. Vermes and M. Goodman, and their subject mat- ter includes works for which important new evidence has appeared since 1909. An entirely rewritten treatment of the Testaments of the XII Patriarchs argues, in debate with M. de Jonge, that they are an originally Jewish composition; and S. P. Brock contributes a new separate treatment of the Odes of Solomon. The survey of the LXX adjuncts to Chronicles, Ezra, Esther, Jeremiah and Daniel begins with a fresh consideration of the origins of 1 Esdras (3 Ezra), lengthening the treatment of this book to ten pages, as compared with five in the German of 1909. Similarly substantial increases occur in the pages devoted to the Testament of Abraham and the Greek Apocalypse of Baruch, and there are new introductions to the Lives of the Prophets, the apocryphal Ezekiel, and "small fragments of anonymous Jewish literature in Christian texts". This sub-section accordingly forms a rich contribution to LXX introduction and pseudepigrapha studies. Jenny Morris's revision of section 34, on Philo, includes valuable bibliographical notes which cite reviews of important books. Her English text incorporates an infor- mative dialogue with Schurer into a version which for the most part follows his footsteps; she diverges decisively from his view that Philo's Jewish principles, how- ever loyally maintained, were rendered ineffective by philosophy. Even here, how- ever, the revision is not wholly removed from the original, for Schurer elsewhere in this section laid striking emphasis on the Jewishness of Philo. This piece of editorial work unobtrusively digests and arranges a great weight of Philonic study. Leonie Archer compiled the 122-page index, chiefly consisting of a detailed main index of names and subjects. Lists of Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic words complete the guide to Schiirer's nobly replenished treasury. [W. HORBURY] H. SHANKS (ed.), Ancient Israel.
