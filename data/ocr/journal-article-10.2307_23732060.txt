Paperback $17.56, isbn 0-7914-4528-3. © 2001 by University of Hawaii Press Comparative philosophers, theologians, and practitioners of Asian intellectual history will surely find much of interest in this provocative, controversial, and undeniably ambitious, titan-like monograph. Simply put, Spiritual Titanism argues that “Jainism, Samkhya, Yoga, and later Hindu texts" endorse what Hein rich Zimmer, in his 1956 study Philosophies of India，1 characterized as "the her esy of Titanism" or the "preemption of divine prerogatives and confusion of human and divine attributes" (p. 2). Author Nicholas Gier adds that "Titanism" is “a philosophical mistake" (p. 16), "humanism gone berserk; it is anthro pocentrism and anthropomorphism taken to their limits." Defining "deity" in culturally biased, distinctly Christian terms as "any being who is omniscient, om nipotent, infinite, and omnipresent," Gier asserts that "humans obviously delude themselves if they believe that they can become divine in the sense of these attributes." Although the monograph concedes that "Indian Titanism," as it refers to this supposed tendency of Jainism, Sämkhya, Yoga, and later Hinduism, is "a rather benign form of extreme humanism," its author warns, quite apocalyptically, that "a Titanistic spirit can be said to inspire militarism, environmental pollution and degradation, and the possible misuse of genetic engineering. If left unchecked, Titanism might destroy or radically change life as we know it on earth" (p. 3). Such hyperbole undermines the credibility of Spiritual Titanism, and will likely prompt readers to question whether it should be considered reliable scholarship or an exercise in learned yet partial religio-philosophical polemic. Specialists in Indian philosophy will most probably find the assessments of Jainism, Sämkhya,</page><page sequence="2">370 China Review International: Vol. 8, No. 2, Fall 2001 and Yoga in Spiritual Titanism，which consume most of the monograph, rather dated, reliant as they are, for example, on the writings of Zimmer and Karl Pot ter's 1963 study, Presuppositions of India's Philosophies.2 Spiritual Titanism allows that early Buddhism, although humanistic, avoids Titanism, but adds that later Buddhism endorses a Hindu-like version of Titan ism, one mitigated only by its premodern search for a return to a "primordial unity and totality." Rather than premodernism, however, the monograph advo cates a "postmodern reconstruction of the self，’ as "relational and social" (p. 15). In this regard, it finds in the Confucian concept of ren 仁"the best Chinese an swer to spiritual Titanism" (p. 16). More generally, the volume lauds Daoism and Xunzi's Confucianism as expressions of perspectives most antithetical to Titan ism, emphasizing as they do the impossibility of human beings achieving divine qualities. While interesting, the weakest portion of Spiritual Titanism is its brief, often elementary analyses of Chinese philosophical texts. Readers of the volume cannot help but notice that despite the expanse of material dealt with and the myriad romanized terms from Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese, and Japanese, there is little that is addressed with the authority of a specialist relying first and foremost on primary sources. Perhaps most problematic is the extent to which Gier's analyses are driven by his tendency, quite anachronistic, to see all of religio-philosophical history in terms of categories such as premodernism, modernism, and postmodernism. Gier has little use for modernism, which he associates with a set of "dualistic dis tinctions" including those of "fact and value, subject and object, public and pri vate, science and faith, politics and religion, theory and practice" (p. xiv). Most disturbingly, Gier sees "these modernistic distinctions" as having been, "argu ably, the cause of institutionalized racism (a modernist invention), militarism, social disintegration, and environmental degradation" (p. xiv). Recoiling from a return to the premodernist "dissolution into the One," Gier unabashedly sides with the postmodernists一messiah-like theorists in his presentation of Titanism and its alternatives. Gier further divides postmodernism into "constructive post modernism"一his team一and "deconstructive postmodernism," which, he warns, lands one in an "amorphous dissipation in Derridean differance" (p. xiv). David Ray Griffin's "Introduction to SUNY Series in Constructive Post modern Thought" amplifies the apocalyptic outlook informing Gier's analyses. For example, it states: Whereas the word modern was almost always used until quite recently as a word of praise and as a synonym for contemporary，a growing sense is now evidenced that we can and should leave modernity behind一in fact, that we must if we are to avoid destroying ourselves and most of the life on our planet. ... [T]he continuation of modernity threatens the very survival of life on our planet. This awareness, combined with the growing knowledge of the inter</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 371 dependence of the modern worldview with modernity's militarism, nuclearism, patiarchy [sic], global apartheid, and ecological devastation, is providing an un precedented impetus for people to see the evidence for a postmodern world view and to envisage postmodern ways of relating to each other, the rest of nature, and the cosmos as a whole, (pp. xxi, xxv) Griffin acknowledges, however, that philosophical postmodernism，associated with the writings, he claims, of Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Derrida, Foucault, De leuze, and Kristeva, "tends to issue in relativism . • • and seems to many thinkers to imply nihilism" (p. xxiii). Seeking to reform postmodernism, Griffin describes a “revisionary, constructive, or一perhaps best—reconstructive" postmodernism that does not attempt to delegitimize all worldviews so much as it tries to offer “a postmodern worldview through a revision of modern premises and traditional concepts in the light of inescapable presuppositions of our various modes of practice’’ (p. xxiii). Griffin foresees this reconstructive activity as issuing in “a postmodern world ... postmodern persons, with a postmodern spirituality, a postmodern society, and ultimately a postmodern global order” (p. xxiv). Another characterization of the brand of postmodernism pushed in Spiritual Titanism might be conservative postmodernism, since it seeks to "salvage a posi tive meaning not only for the notions of selfliood, historical meaning, reason, and truth as correspondence, which were equated with modernity, but also for notions of divinity, cosmic meaning, and an enchanted nature, which were cen tral to premodern modes of thought" (p. xxiv). Sensibly, Griffin admits that con structive postmodernists do not “hold the naively Utopian belief that the success of this movement would bring about a global society of universal and lasting peace, harmony and happiness, in which all spiritual problems, social conflicts, ecological destruction, and hard choices would vanish" (p. xxv). It recognizes, in stead, that there is perhaps a “transcultural proclivity to evil deep within the hu man heart, which no new paradigm, combined with a new economic order,. • • will suddenly eliminate" (p. xxv). Nevertheless, Griffin rightly contends that "the human proclivity to evil in general, and to conflictual competition and ecological destruction in particular, can be greatly exacerbated or greatly mitigated by a world order and its worldview." Yet without compelling proof, Griffin ominously asserts that modernity "exacerbates it about as much as imaginable" (p. xxvi). Griffin concludes his polemic with the confession, "This series, making no pre tense of neutrality, is dedicated to the success of this movement toward a post modern world." Without launching a defense of modernity, and to a certain extent admitting some of the charges leveled, this review will add, as a word of caution for those enthusiastic about the new age, that not all bad paradigms are followed by better ones, and many new ideas vanish even before their novelty does. Most problem atic, there is little to convince the skeptic that the constructive postmodernist</page><page sequence="4">372 China Review International: Vol. 8, No. 2, Fall 2001 world so touted in this volume will be significantly better than the one it seeks to redefine. On a less comprehensive level, Spiritual TitanisrrCs analyses are often unper suasive, despite the declarative form they often take. For example, the notion that Jains, due to their supposedly modernistic, titanistic tendencies, in some sense contribute to or exacerbate tendencies toward environmental degradation is di伍 cult to accept, especially when one realizes, as Gier、Preface admits, that Jains are at "the forefront of India's environmental movement" (p. xiv). Also problem atic for this messianic, constructive postmodern project is its heroicization of one of the least liberal and environmentally friendly Chinese paradigms, that of Xunzi, a thinker who is not wholly incommensurate philosophically with the per spectives of the ruling elite in the People's Republic, an elite responsible for more ecological degradation than any other extant regime. Inadvertently，Gier villifies the good guys in the trenches engaged in righting the ecosystem, while idolizing those who have helped to create a nightmare of their habitat. Even as it espouses relatively positive analyses of ancient Chinese philoso phies, Spiritual Titanism advances numerous questionable interpretations of the same material. For example, Gier declares that "the Daoist self is ... fully rela tional but, especially in Zhuangzi, exhorted to sever all contacts with society" (p. 15). Elsewhere Gier states that "Zhuangzi's philosophy appears to join Yoga Titanism in affirming an antisocial self, which although living in the world, re mains disengaged from it" (p. 207). In yet another passage, Gier explains that "the social-relational Confucian self, which melds with constructive post modernism, is rejected in the Zhuangzi (the sage's self is distinctly nonsocial, in terms of the necessity of relating to other human beings ...)" (p. 220). However, William A. Callahan's recent study, "Cook Ding's Life on the Whetstone: Contin gency, Action, and Inertia in the Zhuangzi，” in Wandering at Ease in the Zhuangzi，edited by Roger Ames, has established, quite convincingly, that the Zhuangzi advocates an engaged activism rather than any retreat away from soci ety. Brian Lundberg's essay, "A Meditation on Friendship," in the same volume, has made a similar point.3 Gier、characterization of Zhuangzi as an advocate of a "distinctly nonsocial self" is at best a polemical exaggeration and at worst an egregiously mistaken reading of the text. Along other lines, Spiritual Titanism faults Roger Ames and David Hall for trying "to deify Confucius and the Confucian sage in general," claiming instead that "most Confucian philosophers never viewed Confucius as a deity”（p. 178). In making these claims, Spiritual Titanism seeks to preserve one of its protago nists, the non-Titanistic Confucians, as advocates of the spiritually correct Asian philosophical stance. However, in doing so, it clearly brackets out a tendency of East Asian religio-philosophical history toward the apotheosis of Confucius and other Confucians, which has persisted throughout Chinese and East Asian his</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 373 tory. Gier attempts to settle the matter via proclamation that "Confucius was not divinized as a savior; rather he was canonized as the saint of the literati" (p. 178) 一but in doing so clearly subscribes to a Christian notion of the divine. Hall and Ames, in noting the deification of Confucius, have hardly pioneered a novel interpretation so much as they have rehearsed a well-known phenomenon of Chinese religio-philosophical history. In the West, an understanding of this phenomenon dates back to the Rites Controversy of the seventeenth century. Gier, eager to find a praiseworthy paradigm in Asian philosophy, too quickly dis misses the divinization of Confucius, and thus undermines the credibility of his study. Other remarks made in passing, yet equally askew, reveal that Spiritual Titanism rests too heavily on secondary sources to be deemed authoritative over all. One last example, perhaps, will illustrate this point. In discussing Steve Odin's The Social Self in Zen and American Pragmatism, Gier offers a facile etymology of the Japanese word ningen 人間(Chinese: renjian), a notion central to Watsuji Tetsurö's understanding of the self. According to Gier, ningen is "composed of two Chinese characters, one meaning individual and the other meaning society” (p. 175). Supposedly, this interplay between "individual" and "society" estab lishes the relational nature of Watsuji's view of the self. Without denying the lat ter point, it should be pointed out that the nin 人(Chinese: ren) in ningen refers to a human being, a person, or people, and not something as Western as an indi vidual. Also, the gen 間(Chinese: jian) in ningen refers to "the space between or among," indicating the presence of a human being in the realm of others, that is, among people. To suggest that gen simply refers to "society" is to mis characterize, via hyperbolic translation, the notion: after all, is one "in society” when in the company of another person(s), or simply among friends? It is noteworthy that this compound appears early on in the title of chapter 4 of the Zhuangzi ("Ren jian shi” 人間世)，where it signifies something akin to "in the world among other people," indicating what might rightly be called, in a very interpretive way, the social nature of Zhuangzi's philosophy. Oddly enough, while Gier consistently asserts that the Zhuangzi advocates withdrawal from society and social relations, when he glosses the character ningen^ which figures prom inently in the thinking of the Inner Chapters of the Zhuangzi, he all too eagerly renders it figuratively as "society." This inconsistency, while perhaps minor in it self, is indicative, it seems, of the relatively polemical nature of the monograph as a whole.
