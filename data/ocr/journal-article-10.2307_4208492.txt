Thus Tamara addresses the Demon when he enters her convent cell.' This' . . . KTO TbM?' iS a phrase which persists through Lermontov's successive redraftings of Demon, although the Demon's reply to it undergoes successive modifica- tions. It is a vital question because it is the pretext for the major characterization of the Demon, his own self-characterization, a tour deforce of subterfuge and disguised revelation. It is also a question to which, either explicitly or by assumption, most critics of the poem provide a response. The purpose of this article is to test the major critical answers to the question of the Demon's identity against evidence within the poem, its drafts and literary background and to urge the advantages of considering the Demon primarily as a literary representation of the Devil. In I9I4, amid the flurry of publications for Lermontov's centen- ary, I. I. Zamotin, reviewing critical attitudes to Lermontov's work, noted that they polarized into two principal approaches: the humanistic and the metaphysical; that is, critics either concentrated on the psychological or social significance of Lermontov's poetry or else regarded him as primarily a metaphysical or even religious poet.2 The enduring importance of this observation is indicated by the fact that almost fifty years later substantially the same confronta- tion of views was noted by I. Ye. Usok commenting on papers read at a conference on Lermontov at Ordzhonikidze in I962.3 True, the argument was now about whether Lermontov in his mature period was a critical realist or whether he remained a romantic do kontsa but this is no more than a (not altogether unwelcome) translation of Zamotin's essentially philosophical formulation into the language of R.

Another feature common to these writers is that both applaud those critics, Kotlyarevsky in the first case,4 Maksi- mov in the second,5 whom they consider to have occupied the middle ground between the extremes, a middle ground excluded by the disjunctive nature of the opposition involved. In fact both Maksimov and Kotlyarevsky, widely separated by time and approach, inevit- ably opt for one of the two possible views, and the middle ground consists merely in subordinating the other to it as generously as possible. Demon especially among Lermontov's works identifies the true stance of the critics and it is clear from their writings that neither Kotlyarevsky nor Maksimov depart from an essentially allegorical approach to Demon wherein the matter of the poem is considered human rather than divine, natural rather than supernatural, realistic rather than romantic, whatever its artistic form may be. The reasons for this dichotomizing of critical approach are to be sought in the history of Lermontov criticism as much as in the works of the poet himself, where, it may be argued, philosophical and ethical views commonly considered irreconcilable, such as fate and free will, good and evil, hope and despair, are found side by side, if not in perfectly logical accommodation, and it is open to the critic to decide which of the pair takes precedence and on what grounds. The assumption, whether explicit or implicit, underlying any criticism concentrating on such polar opposites, is that of the basic dualism of Lermontov's thought, and the critical response to the artist's dualism - resolution - has led to an analogous duality in the critical literature. Belinsky is credited by Zamotin with having sown the seeds of both literary traditions, because, while stressing the social and psychological importance of Lermontov's principal works he never- theless idealized the role of poetry and the 'superhuman' aspect of Lermontov's creativity, that is, its metaphysical import.6 Later criticism may be regarded as participating in this primordial Belinskian division in stressing either the humanistic or the meta- physical dimensions of Lermontov's work. The Utilitarian Russian critics of the I86os, pledged in St Simon's phrase to the 'rehabilita- tion of the flesh', rejected any metaphysical interpretation of 4 N. A. Kotlyarevsky, M. Yu. Lermontov.

Lermontova', ibid., pp. 479-547. In both cases the metaphysical content of the criticism develops in isolation from the particular theme of the article, on to which it is grafted by means of the same clumsy ligature: 'All we have said may very easily be applied to Lermontov's novel.'

Ibid., p. 50I.</page><page sequence="3">LERMONTOV S DEMON I9I Lermontov's poetry and their sociological approach to literary criticism found Lermontov's works unduly subjective and pessim- istic; the result was his banishment from the high table of literary popularity for the rest of the nineteenth century. V. S. Solov'yov, who might have regarded Lermontov as his congener, chose instead to condemn him as a herald of Nietzscheanism, thus denying to Lermontov the regenerative critical support he had proffered to Tyutchev,7 with the result that, according to Merezhkovsky, interest in Lermontov's poetry was seriously impaired.8 Within these rather bleak extremes, however, the division of critical opinion had, by the first two decades of this century, developed into that between pioneering Lermontov scholars such as Viskovatov, Kotlyarevsky and Duchesne and belle-lettristes such as Merezhkovsky, Shuvalov and Zakrzhevsky. The latter group regarded Lermontov's inspiration as primarily religious; the former, over-intoxicated perhaps by the romance of the poet's biography and character, insisted on a psychological or autobiographic approach to his poetry. For them it was an extension of the poet himself and Lermontov's characters were self-portraits. In short what Andronikov calls 'the brief, tragic and fascinating fate' of Lermontov predominated over the creativity.9 This kind of psycho- logical approach continues to have support, as L. Kelly's recent work indicates, despite the fact that 'the key to understanding Lermontov's character is not to be found in biographical research, but in his ideas, in Belinsky's phrase, "presented in artistic form" '10 Kotlyarevsky typifies the purely psychological approach applied to Demon in particular: Demon, for all the fantastic setting of the poem is intimately bound up with the entirely terrestrial existence of its author. It is not a symbol adapted from books and embellished by the imagination but one derived from the personal life of the poet and placed within the framework of a symbolic legend.1" Duchesne, a French critic who derived much from Kotlyarevsky intensifies this view to the detriment of the poem itself: Lermontov's plan was twofold: he wished to draw his own portrait and to present by means of dramatic action his particular view of love. 7 V.

With such a subject, the action per se is of little importance and because the author exploited it so well, the plot strikes us as somewhat empty and puerile.12 Justification for what amounts to an autobiographical view of Demon is, it is sometimes claimed, furnished by such lines as: KaK, eMOH, XAaAHbIH H CypOBbIH, A B MHpe BeCeAHACA 3AOM,13 from the dedication to the third ( I83 I) draft of Demon, or: 1H rOpAbIHI AeMOH He OTCTaHeT, HlOKa H(HBY 5, OT MeHA Ht yM MOA 03apqITb OH CTaHeT Ay,IoM myAecHoro OrH5.14 from the I83I re-working of Moy demon. Duchesne considers that these lines imply identity between Lermontov and his Demon. Among Soviet critics, Blagoy appears to argue for a similar equation15 but the authority of Grigor'yan is more prudent: 'There is always a certain distance between the Demon and the poet. The Demon reflects an important aspect of the poet's outlook, but not the only aspect.' 16 Gurevich expresses the same idea even more strongly, and regards the Demon as representing an outlook imposed on the poet, but falling far below his moral ideal.17 The idea behind these views, namely that while Lermontov is more than the Demon, the Demon is no more than Lermontov, seems, however, largely to ignore the Pygmalion-like relationship with his creature which Lermontov implies in the second of the verse quotations above, both of which might equally be quoted in support of the notion that Lermontov believed in the objective existence of his Demon.18 An extension of the purely psychological interpretation of the Demon is that which regards him as typifying aspects either of humanity as a whole, or of the generation to which Lermontov 12 E.

Fedders exemplifies this approach: 'His [the Demon's] origins are unknown. He is an aggregate composed from the mass of lonely discontented people who have been injured by life.'19 This aggregate approach placed in a socio-historical perspective has traditionally formed the basis of the Soviet critical approach to the question of the Demon's identity: In Demon Lermontov expressed not only his own mood, but the mood of protest which characterized his generation, the generation which produced the revolutionary and democratic Russian intelligentsia led by Belinsky.20 Thus A. M. Mikhaylova in the note to Demon in the 1954-55 Academy edition of Lermontov's works. For many critics indeed the majestic agon between God and Demon depicted in the poem is no more than an allegory of social injustice and opposition to tsarist absolutism. Andronikov typifies this view: 'The story of an angel rebelling against a heavenly despot acquired a social meaning.... Lermontov's Demon was accepted by the men of the forties as the symbol of a free, proud, doubting, thinking, indomitable person- ality.'21 Fokht while recognizing that the allegory is at best loose and that its critique is 'in an extremely hyperbolized spiritual form' nevertheless voices the same opinion.22 Implicit in such critical views is the belief that, whatever name be given to the form of the poem, religious, romantic or allegorical, its matter remains firmly realistic. By corollary therefore, in such a critical mode, the romantic element in Demon is, if not denied, then strictly circumscribed.23 Yet responding perhaps to the growing interest in romantic art in general, certain Soviet critics have shown a willingness to regard Lermontov's romanticism as an independent artistic phenomenon, an object of study in itself. By this means they approach or achieve a genuine metaphysical assessment of Demon in particular. Maymin for instance discusses the interplay of the forces of good and evil in the poem in the context of Schelling's philosophy, though by a curious conversion from the moral to the aesthetic, he believes they are only present in the poem to give it colour.24 Mann, however, while rigorously distinguishing between the roles of poet and philosopher does appear to suggest that Demon treats of the real 19 G.

Accord- ing to the former, the antinomies which abound in the poem- heaven and earth, God and Demon, knowledge and innocence, time and eternity - mirror that philosophical and intellectual rift of the I 83os which Herzen saw as stemming from an implacable opposition between idealism and empiricism." Udodov sees these antinomies as theses and antitheses of a modified Hegelian dialectic which finds its most explicit statement in the Demon's klyanus' speech.28 However, this philosophical approach to the poem is maintained at the expense of neglecting the Demon's spiritual personality: instead, the vagueness of his identity ('neither day nor night') is stressed and he is conceived as a symbolic abstraction or, at best, a disembodied spokesman in the philosophical disputes of the thirties.29 The objections to such interpretations of Demon are twofold. The first lies in Lermontov's lack of interest in the social and political issues of his day. Shchedrin writes of his aloofness from the intellectual kruzhki of the capital;30 nor did Lermontov go out of his way to cultivate the Decembrists he encountered in the Caucasus, 25 YU. V. Mann, Poetika russkogo romantiZma, Moscow, I 976, p. 2 I6 and passim. 26 Maksimov, op. cit., p. 85. Maksimov sees this confrontation between two truths as implying a dialogue or 'dual voice' (dvukhgolosiye) on the structural level of the poem. Other critics, notably Melikhova, Turbin and Udodov, have expanded this idea, claiming that the poem exhibits a genre-polyphony between the various poetic styles inherent in it: philosophi- cal, 'oriental', confessional, etc. See L. S. Melikhova and V. N. Turbin, Poemy Lermontova. Opyt analiza zhanrovogo svoyebraz4ya khudozhestvennogo proizvedeniya, Moscow, I969; B. T. Udodov, M. Yu.

Instead, the Demon asserts the eternal necessity of irreconcilable contraries which do not 'yield to a demarcation into component parts by means of a metaphysically trite either/or .... he [the Demon] swears simultaneously by heaven and hell, bliss and suffering because, in this world, the one does not exist without the other.'

Nazi- mov, in particular, remembers Lermontov as a surly interlocutor.31 This diffidence on Lermontov's part with regard to political discussion contrasts sharply with his apparent willingness to indulge in metaphysical discourse which seems to have been the probable nature of his discussions with V. F. Odoyevsky.32 The second objection applies equally to all the variants of the humanistic approach in the criticism of Demon whether psychologi- cal or political. It bears directly on the central question of the identity of the Demon himself. 'The Demon', writes Andronikov, 'is not the ultimate source of evil. He is engendered by evil and cannot help becoming its bearer, just like Lermontov's own generation.'33 It is indeed crucial to any anthropomorphic interpretation of the Demon that he should not be regarded as identical with the source of evil itself, that he should not be a personification of the phenomenon of evil, for if this is allowed, the struggle between God and Demon in the poem becomes a struggle between the absolutes of good and evil, the Demon becomes the Devil and his quest for personal salvation through Tamara's love is transformed into the theological or philosophical question: whether God wishes evil to persist in the world. This is the point of departure for a metaphysical or theological approach to Demon, an approach in which the psycho- logical and social implications of the poem are thrust into the penumbra of secondary consideration. Among those critics who can be placed on the metaphysical side of the critical dichotomy, some, like Merezhkovsky, Shuvalov and Zakrzhevsky, did maintain such an overtly religious view of the poem. More recently Pozov, while admitting Lermontov's bio- graphical traits in the Demon, nevertheless assumes that the author intended the Devil to be the hero of his poem: 'Faith and love, these are the qualities of angels and cherubim. And he [the Demon] is the first angel, Lucifer, who knelt near the throne of the Almighty.'34 Mann, whose metaphysical approach to the poem was touched on above, is likewise of the opinion that Lermontov intended the Devil himself as hero, because, as he puts it: 'With Lermontov evil is indivisible. The Demon is the full and chief representative of evil.'35 On the other side of the critical divide, however, Kotlyarevsky is 31 From a conversation with M. A. Nazimov in i88o recorded by P. A.

Ought critics to be concerned primarily with the final I 84I edition of Demon as the maturest version of the work? Should they perhaps even consider Demon as an aggregate of all its drafts? Should particular stress be laid on the poem's position in the perspective of European literature on the demonic, or should precedence be given to its Russian antecedents? As regards the existence of the drafts, though one may agree with Duchesne that they indicate that the poet was clearly dissatisfied with his work,38 it is impossible to ignore the light they throw on Lermontov's intentions about the hero's identity. It suits a broadly humanistic understanding of Demon to see in the drafts the gradual accumulation of human traits by the Demon: Thus the proud spirit of rejection cannot maintain, even from the early drafts of the poem his titanic role; the poet humanizes him and reduces him to a quite ordinary representative of human grief.39 Commenting on the I83I draft of Demon Maymin suggests that: In the new version of the poem the Demon gains an important new trait: he is not simply an evil spirit, but a proud one too. Lermontov's Demon gradually becomes a romantic hero partially modelled on the author.40 In fact, however, if the question is confined strictly to the status of the Demon in the drafts, then it is hard to disagree with Shuvalov that the Demon of the second and third drafts is only 'formally connected with evil by the oath he has taken':41 OH CB13aH KAHTBOH pOKOBOIO.

It is incomplete but it constitutes an attempt by Lermontov to dispense with plot and narrative as vehicles for representing his Demon and to adopt instead a technique similar to that used in his two Moy demon poems of I829 and I83I, that is, to attempt the portrayal of an unfettered, elemental Demon. Draft four, plotless, presents the Demon wander- ing alone against the backcloth of God's creation. For this Demon there is neither future nor past, nor is there action of real importance, let alone anything which might anger the 'Prince of the Abyss' who has consequently withdrawn from the scene. Emerging from the limbo of the fourth draft in a return to the original plot, the Demon is allowed to retain the autonomy he has acquired there; now in the fifth draft he is made to promise the heroine 'a throng of my serving spirits to wait at your feet';44 in the sixth Lermontov styles him 'happy first-born of creation'45 and in the final I84I draft of the poem the Demon swears 'by the fate of my brothers, subservient to me.46 Thus, in the strictest terms of an identity developing through the drafts, it is difficult to deny that Lermontov was moving towards rather than away from a supernatural definition of his hero's identity. That there is also development of the Demon's character in the drafts is of course clearly demonstrable. But in the case of Demon improved characterization ought not to be confused with humaniza- tion. It would not be possible, for instance, to agree with Maksimov's assertion that 'the great contradictoriness and irrationality of the Demon's character in comparison with his better known European antecedents make him convincingly real and lifelike' if by this he simply means more human, since contradictoriness and irrationality are not commensurate with humanity, but are applicable to other 43'And he hastened to withdraw / from that cell, where he had first / violated his other-worldly oaths / arousing the ire of the Prince of the Abyss': ibid., p. 246. 44 Ibid., p. 273. 45 Ibid., p. 279. 46 Ibid., p. 208.</page><page sequence="10">I 98 ROBERT REID things as well.47 Furthermore, since a change of characterization not infrequently has structural reverberations it is important to note the role of Tamara in intensifying and magnifying the Demon's character at a crucial point in the poem. There is a curious contrast between Tamara, physically and spiritually at the mercy of the Demon, and the Demon himself at the mercy of Tamara's willing- ness to protract her interrogation of him and thus allow him to unfold his self-characterization. And indeed, though she objects to the Demon's presence with her 'Leave me, 0 cunning spirit', she continues to polemicize with the hero, albeit feebly, the argument becoming gradually more protracted and complex with each successive draft, furnishing a pretext for the Demon further to reveal not an amplification-of human attributes, but rather his real identity as the author of evil itself, culminating in the grandeur of the klyanus' speech, peculiar to the final version of the poem. Another perspective on the poem which provides support for a humanistic reading of it is the nature of the literary source tradition which lies behind it. Commentators not infrequently trace through the demonic tradition in European literature a gradual humaniza- tion in the literary representation of demonic figures from Milton onwards. In this process, Goethe is considered to play a vital role, since, to use Pozov's words: He took as the second hero of Faust, not the chief of dark powers, as had been the case with Milton and Klopstock but a demon of lower rank, Mephistopheles, a true professional.48 According to Nol'man this trivialization of the erstwhile grandeur of the demonic type paved the way for the creation in literature of human beings displaying demonic traits such as Pechorin,49 and Eykhenbaum considered the humanization of the demonic character to be accentuated in the context of Russian literature: Losing its connection with the medieval epos and poems in the Miltonic style, this subject [syuzhet] once transposed to Russian soil, lost its richness and also its theological and philosophical character, becoming considerably more primitive.50 47 Maksimov, op. cit., p. 8o. 48 Pozov, op. cit., p. 37. Regarding the importance of Milton in particular, I would incline to Udodov's view that, for Lermontov, Paradise Lost was, in a sense, 'a prescribed reading' which, though he could not ignore it, was uncongenial to him in its essentially classical style and use of allegory: Udodov, op. cit., p. 265. 49 M. L. Nol'man, 'Ot "Demona" Pushkina k "Demonu" Nekrasova' in K istorii russkogo romantizma, ed. Yu. V. Mann, I. G. Neupokoyeva, U. R. Fokht, Moscow, I973, p. 403. 50 B. M. Eykhenbaum, Lermontov, Munich, I967, p. 93.</page><page sequence="11">LERMONTOV S DEMON 199 Yet surely it is a far cry from the Demon to a mortal zlodey as Eykhenbaum styles Arbenin5l and there must surely be significance, for instance, in the fact that the analogy between the Demon and Byron's Cain, a mortal overwhelmed by demonic powers, though toyed with briefly by Lermontov in the epigraph to draft three of Demon, is thereafter abandoned in favour of the waxing vigour of the demonic personality of the hero. The true antecedents of the poem in European literature, De Vigny's Eloa and Moore's Loves of the Angels, are works of a rarefied romanticism which it would be difficult to compress into the confines of the sort of socio-allegorical interpretation which some critics would apply to Demon. Further, if possible Russian antecedents such as works by Zhukovsky and Podolinsky be considered as influences on Demon, it must still be admitted that there is little in the subject matter to put them outside the tradition of French, English and German writers on demonic themes. Accordingly Shuvalov goes so far as to claim that in the matter of influence, Demon is entirely within the European tradition.52 However, Pushkin's importance in developing a unique view of the Demon-figure is such as to dispose of that argument, though it is not perhaps sufficient to justify Gershenzon's claim that Pushkin's poetry alone was the source of inspiration for Demon.53 It is Pushkin who is credited with introducing the word demon into the Russian literary vocabulary.54 Pushkin's poem Demon (i 823) has an indisputably psychological inspiration; indeed it seems to fit, far better than Lermontov's Demon, the prescriptions of the strictest humanistic approach to the latter. In Demon Alexander Rayevsky, the cynical, free-thinking acquaintance of Pushkin who contributed much to the latter's intellectual insecurity during the final months of his southern exile, is compared to a demon whose role is to infect others with his own scepticism. But the poem is not just about Rayevsky, it is also about the inability of idealism to resist the assaults of a pessimistic rationalism. It is an inversion of the Cartesian demon in Meditations whose attacks on the philosopher's most basic powers of perception are repelled by pure rationality. It is difficult, therefore, to confine oneself to the view that Demon is merely 51 Ibid., p. 94. 52 S. V. Shuvalov, 'Vliyaniye na tvorchestvo Lermontova russkoy i yevropeyskoy poezii' in Venok M. Yu.

This view, not infrequently recurring, regards Pushkin's Demon as the psychological progenitor of Lermon- tov's Demon, but also claims Pushkin's Angel as a schema for the plot.

The feeling of doubt is painful but of short duration. When it disappears it destroys forever the best hopes and poetic conceits of the soul. Goethe aptly styles man's eternal foe as a spirit of denial. Pushkin [he refers to himself in the third person] wished to embody in his demon this spirit of denial and doubt.55 This authorial postscriptum represents a considerable advance on the more strictly psychological portrayal of the demonic figure in the poem itself. Pushkin now considers his demon to be the embodiment of 'denial' and 'doubt', terms not unfamiliar from the text of Lermontov's Demon. The idea that existence itself contains 'eternal contradictions' is elaborated by Lermontov himself in a poem entitled Moy demon, written in I829 at the time he was at work on the first outlines of Demon. It is an interesting re-working of the elements of Pushkin's poem. Pushkin's poem falls easily into two halves, in the first of which life is presented as a lively source of poetical inspiration: H1 B30pbI 4eB, H iyM Ay6pOBbI, H1 HO-IbIO HeHbe COAOBb5 . . .56 However these delights yield in the second half of the poem to the blast of personified doubt - the Rayevsky-demon. Lermontov's poem also falls easily into two parts; the first contains smoking clouds, fateful storms, foaming rivers and noisy oaks. The second outlines the sombre and disillusioned character of the demonic figure. However, the fundamental distinction between Pushkin's poem and Lermontov's, is that in the latter the demon himself is present, numinously presiding over the restless natural phenomena: Me&gt;K AHCTbeB AKeATbIx, o6AeTeBLII4x, CTOHT ero HeABH?KHbIA TpOH; Ha HeM, cpeAb BeTpOB OHeMeBLHHX, CHAHT YHb1A H Mpa'eH OH.57 He is master of those 'eternal contradictions' with which Pushkin's maturer reflections supplemented his own concept of the demonic. 55 A.

This in itself alters his presentation: his static throne among the restless elements has gone: he now takes that ubiquitous spiritual and physical over-view of an airborne spirit which is used to such effect in Demon. By comparison with its- predecessor, this poem achieves for its demon a greater rarefaction of the supernatural identity, while confirming in its final verse the essential independence of the demon from the poet despite the closeness of their relationship. There is consequently evidence from the drafts of the major poem and from the two smaller poems to suggest that Lermontov's primary concerns in Demon were metaphysical, and that a meta- physical interpretation should preponderate without however oblit- erating the psychological and humanistic. Critics leaning towards such an interpretation show a range of approaches, some rather extravagant. Kondr, for instance, maintains that Tamara, obsessed by the terrifying Devil which her religion portrayed and traumatized by her fiance's death, invented the Demon out of her own imagination and was then overwhelmed by her creation.60 Loginov- skaya advances the view that the Demon should be regarded in the Greek sense of daemon or admonitory genius, the constant satellite of its creator.61 This idea has the advantage of satisfying the desiderata of both the metaphysical and the humanistic critic, but it fails to accommodate the broadly Christian frame of reference within which 58 It is significant that V. F. Odoyevsky, writing of Pushkin's Demon soon after its publication had also suggested the objective reality of the poem's subject: ' . . . but this evil genius exists not only within, but also outside us . . .'

OH 6bIA HOXOAK Ha Belep 5CHbIH: HH AeHb, HH HOtIb, - HH MpaK, HH CBeT! ..64 Lermontov's poem of I 83 I - Angel - is interpreted by Merezhkov- sky as a description of one of these unaligned angels journeying to earth in the arms of another angel: OH Ay4uy MAa,y1O B o6&amp;bITHHX Hec 4A51 MHip nHeaAH H cAe3.65 and Shuvalov asks, reasonably enough perhaps, 'Who will transport the human soul into the new world [i.e. back to heaven] when it eventually dies? He who brought it to earth in the first place - the angel.'66 This angel, transformed into a guardian angel, explains away Tamara's angelic protector in Demon, who, after her death, snatches her up from the Demon's clutches. However, neither Merezhkovsky nor Shuvalov can be held to provide a convincing or consistent interpretation of Demon within this Talmudic framework. If, for instance, the unaligned angels are tested by means of mortal incarnation, this may explain the existence of ourselves and Tamara on earth, but it fails to explain why the Demon, a disembodied soul awaiting incarnation should be able to make an incursion into earthly realms.67 Zakrzhevsky combines the terrifying prospect of eternity which this Talmudic legend spreads before us with the idea of bogobor- chestvo.68 The Demon is conducting an eternal, heroic, Sisyphean 62 P.

Solov'yov put the idea succintly: 'the poet's litigation with God'.69 The unbridgeable gulf between man and creator which such a reading of Demon opens up is for Sakulin a manifestation of the dualistic principle basic to all Lermontov's poetry and symbolized in it by thejuxtaposition of earth and sky. In such a dualistic scheme of things the Demon becomes 'the point of contact between the two spheres - heaven and earth'.70 It is in this context of dualism and its resolution that Eykhenbaum offers the philosophy of Schelling as a possible influence on Lermontov, in particular Schelling's doctrine of the common root of opposites, whereby good and evil are held to spring from the same source and to be allotropes of a single substance.71 Schellingian influence is consequently claimed with respect to the Demon's conflicting impulses to do both good and evil. Unfortunately the extent of Schellingian influences on Lermontov remains vague and critics' views on the subject depend less on tangible evidence than on their reading of Lermontov's character. Manuilov, for example, doubts if Lermontov could have been bothered to read Schelling.72 Most however think that Lermontov imbibed Schellingian ideas indirectly, since they had been popularized, in a certain form at least, by the Lyubomudry, but that unlike the latter he was not sufficiently absorbed in Schelling's philosophy to make his works a mouthpiece for the philosopher's theories. It is clear from a sample of such philosophical readings of Demon that if we are dealing in the poem with the Devil rather than a devil, then this Devil is no more the familiar villain of Christian belief than is the God in the poem, 'occupied with heaven, not earth',73 the deity central to the same religion. It is tempting, but unwise, to term Lermontov's poem heretical. It is true that certain Gnostic and Manichaean sects held the Creator to be either evil or at best amoral and that some considered Satan, as opposing such a Creator, to be a force for man's good in the universe; however, central to these major heresies was the doctrine that the physical body, the earth and 69 Solov'yov, op. cit., p. 364. 70 P.

The Christian Church, while officially pronouncing the earth and physical body to be essentially good and redeemable, has nevertheless managed to accommodate traditions of mortification and asceticism which seem to assume quite the reverse of this teaching and work on more or less the same premises as the heresies. Thus, while it is possible to find the idea of a sinful earth in both the heresies and Christianity, the idea of earth being good and holy is present in Christianity but absent in the heresies. Admittedly in the first stanza of Demon the earth is called 'sinful'. But the shift of location in the later drafts of the poem from an unspecified area some have thought to be Spain to the colourful Caucasus, seems deliberately intended by Lermontov to intensify the effect of earthly beauty and perfection which culminates in the matchless physical beauty of Tamara, to whom also the word 'sinner' is applied. The discrepancy between the prospect of earthly perfection and the word 'sinful' is best explained in terms of an irony which occurs because the term 'earth' which this adjective some- times characterizes outside the poem has changed its quality inside the poem. The word 'sinful' used of such a beautiful earth as that presented in Demon is inappropriate and belongs to the world outside the poem; likewise the word 'sinner' used of Tamara in the third stanza of Part Two of the poem, because it does not accord with the impression of Tamara formed by the reader. The same also applies to words like 'immoral' (prestupnyy) and 'vicious' (porochnyy) applied by the angel to the Demon, or to 'enemy' used of the Demon by Tamara in the tenth stanza of Part Two. The spirit of these words and the complexion they cast on the contexts around them, run counter to the sympathies acquired by the reader of Demon. Consequently, although Demon may be regarded as taking issue with religious norms maintained in the real world outside the framework of the poem, it cannot be said to be doing so in close accordance with any recognized heretical system. Clearly the identity of the Demon is crucial to the poem's polemic with the religious norms of that outside world. In the early drafts, the Demon lacks not only his later Satanic status but also other important qualities proper to the maturer Demon. Apart from the modifications in the Demon's identity which take place in the drafts, the question of the Demon's motivation also changes. The early Demon of lowly status is motivated purely by a desire to avenge himself on Tamara's predecessor for the presence of her guardian angel. His verbal encounters with the heroine are directed to this end</page><page sequence="17">LERMONTOV S DEMON 205 and by comparison with those of the final draft are primitive, brusque and less lyrical. The paradox underlying the development of the Demon's character through the drafts is evident from the following changes wrought in the major characters by the time of the final i84i draft: (a) clarification of the full Satanic status of the Demon: he is now the embodiment of evil, the chief enemy of man and God; (b) a shift in his motivation whereby revenge is dispensed with and love allowed to remain his chief motivating force, so that this modification is chiefly one of omission; (c) an improvement in the quantity and quality of the Demon's words to Tamara, so that they now arguably constitute the artistic apogee of the poem; (d) the transformation of the heroine into an incomparable earthly beauty. These are the principal foci for change through the drafts of Demon: on the one hand there is an intensification of Satanic identity, on the other an intensification of beauty, whether of the Georgian land- scape or of the heroine or of the hero's language. Maymin comes close to recognizing the significance of this juxtaposition of beauty and Satanic identity when, writing of Lermontov's view of the poet's role in Prorok (i841) he claims that 'the poet in Prorok is in several significant ways reminiscent of the Demon, the most romantic and perhaps the most lyrically tragic of Lermontov's heroes.'74 However, it is possible to go further than this and to claim that the Demon is indeed a poet in his own right and that his triumph over Tamara's reasonable objections to his integrity is effected by means of pure poetry. The culmination of his poetical talents is the klyanus' speech which draws together the vital thematic strands of the poem: KAMIHyCb 5I repBbIM AHeM TBopeHb5, KAJHyCb ero nOCAeAHHM AHeM, KA5IHyCb HO30pOM ipeCTYnAeHbA1 14 BeMHOH HpaBAbI TOpKeCTBOM.

These are the supreme oaths uttered by the supreme apostate. Yet the evil identity of their creator does not nullify their power; that lies elsewhere: ECTb CHAa 6Aaro4aTHaR B CO3Byxibe CAOB &gt;KHBbIX, 1I 4bIIXHT HeHoHHITHaJ, CBHqTaR ripeAeCTb B HHX.76 Thus runs the second verse of Lermontov's poem, Molitva. It suggests that words may be potent in their mere musicality and therefore independently from the intentions and moral integrity of their utterer. In the klyanus' speech the truth of this formula is put to the ultimate test: the author of evil prevails over Tamara by the power of poetry alone. Yet it is not only the Demon in the poem who champions this omnipotence of art. In the 'Georgian' drafts of the poem, the poet himself emerges from anonymity to emphasize his own personality, presenting in the early stanzas ever more extravagant tableaux of God's creation in order to break the Demon's strained refusal to yield to the power of beauty. Stanzas three and four of Part One are a struggle between Demon and poet with the aim of forcing the former to yield to a beauty which the poet, and through him the reader, feels to be self-evident: 1H nepeA HHM HHOHI KapTHHbI Kpacbi AHBbIe paC1lBeAH: POCKo1JHo0 FrPy3HH 4OAHHbI KOBPOM paCKHHYAHCb B4aAH; CtIaCTAHBbI4, HbIIlEHbIH KpaH 3eMAH!

The reader, therefore, is contemplating not the real Georgian landscape, the beauties of which the Demon is able to resist, but the poet's transformation of it, a kartina. Thus there is a considerable discrep- ancy in point of view between the three contemplative participants the transforming artist, the perceiving Demon and the reader who, beguiled by the refracted colours of an artist's impression and won over to his point of view, is therefore unsympathetic to the Demon's denials. However, this complex relationship is in flux and through stanzas six to nine changes dramatically. The presentation of Tamara in stanza six is in a minor key, simple and unpretentious. The poet either cannot, or, more likely, will not, invest his heroine with the luxuriant, self-evident beauty of his landscape scenes. There is nothing which the reader can detect in Tamara which singles her out for the immense impact she is soon to make on a Demon who has hitherto shown himself impervious to the highest beauty. Neverthe- less the Demon succumbs to its presence in Tamara to the extent that: ... BHOBb HIOCTHFHYA OH CBHTbIHIO AIO6BH, Ao6pa H KPaCOTbI! ... 79 Now that Demon and poet are in harmony over this creature of beauty, it is the reader who finds himself in the Demon's former sceptical position and becomes a target for the poet's persuasive talents. Furthermore, it is as though this new alliance with his demonic creature has modified the author's poetic methodology, for it must be admitted that his extravagant attempts at persuading the reader to accept Tamara as the nonpareil of earthly beauty bear all the characteristics of the Demon's rhetorical armoury of hyperbole, antithesis and juration which he uses to crush Tamara's resistance: KA5IHyCb HOAHO'IHOIO 3Be34OH0, AyxiOM 3aKaTa H BOCTOKa, BAaCTHTeAb HlepcHH 3AaTOA 1H HH e4HHbIH Liapb 3eMHOH He LjeAOBaA TaKoro oKa; 78 And all that he saw before him/he despised or else he hated: ibid., pp. I85-86. 79...

For instance, under these circumstances, it becomes difficult to reconcile the interpretation of the Demon's speech as a list of Hegelian theses and antitheses (a view favoured by certain Soviet critics) with the purely romantic content and context of similar rhetorical antinomies used by Lermontov when introducing Tamara to the reader; between the 'harem's plashing fount' and the 'profoundly dialectic understanding of reality' which Udodov finds in the Demon's oaths there can be little analogy.81 In fact, however, the common factor between the separate utterances of poet and Demon is to be sought not in meaning but in intention. Both poet and Demon use their picturesque oaths as ultimate weapons of verbal persuasion and both triumph thereby: the poet over the reader, the Demon over Tamara. The poem may justly be said to be pervaded by the theme of the persuasive power of verbal beauty, complicated, in the case of the Demon's poetry by its emanating from the source of utter falsehood and deception. In fact, however, this definition of the Demon derives from religious preconceptions external to the poem itself, the chief of which is that evil is a necessary part of his Satanic identity. If the evil is extraneous to the poem, whence arises the Demon's apparent compensatory goodness inside the poem? Is it from the Demon's hope of reconciliation with heaven which well fits Schopenhauer's definition of hope as 'the confusion of desire with probability'? Is it from his love for Tamara? Yet it is the complex of Tamara's physical beauty and musical and terpsichorean accomplishments which merely remind the Demon of love and former goodness. And these lie in his past, outside the poem. Tamara's beauty attracts, because the Demon confuses it with goodness and the possibility of redemption. In fact her beauty evokes these things without leading the way to 80 'I swear by the midnight star, / by the setting and rising of the sun: / no gilded Persian potentate, / not one among the kings of earth, / has ever kissed such eyes as hers!': / nor has the harem's plashing fount / in time of summer heat, with pearly dew / bathed such a form as hers!': ibid., p. 187. 81 Udodov, op. cit., p. 45.</page><page sequence="21">LERMONTOV S DEMON 209 them. The Demon's encounter with Tamara is essentially an aesthetic experience: 1 4AOArO CAaAOCTHOH KapTHHOH OH Aio6OBaAcq . . .82 The Demon in the poem is not so much a good being as one capable of great aesthetic experience and expression. If this is the case, morality as such lies outside the scope of the poem, however much the reader's moral preconceptions are brought to bear on a reading of it. If the Demon's words represent his artistic creativity, Tamara represents the external stimulus of art - natural beauty. It is tempting to identify her beauty with moral goodness as the Demon does: H1 BHOBb riOCTHrHYA OH CBfITbIHIO AiO6BH, Ao6pa H KpacOTbI! ...83 and to claim that she is a force for good in the poem, but aside from this fallacy it is hard to define what positive trait of moral goodness resides in Tamara unless perhaps it is her affective role as victim. Yet merely being a victim confers no moral status. Tamara's beauty is unable to redeem the Demon, and it may well be claimed Tamara is as beautiful, in death, as in life, perhaps more so; this beauty becomes another pretext for the poet's lyrical effusion: just as her body is arrayed more richly in death than in life, so the poet invests her lifeless features with a meaningless but beautiful depth of inner significance; this is the ironically belated depiction of a surpassing beauty taken largely on trust by the reader when Tamara was first introduced in the poem. And yet for all that, it is a mere natural beauty and as such, as excellent in the immediate aftermath of death as in the fullness of life and in either case purely contingent to the personality and moral status of Tamara.84 Demon defines very clearly what beauty is and is not able to do. Natural beauty, however perfect, is unable to save or redeem. Artistic beauty is totally independent from the moral status of the artist. Beauty therefore has no positive moral function in the Schillerian sense, but it possesses the power of compelling an emotional assent to itself. And by compelling this assent, it may also persuade. It is such persuasion 82 'And long he lingered over this delightful picture,/admiring it. . .': Soch., vol. iv, p. i88. 83 'Once more he glimpsed and understood that sanctum / where dwell love, goodness and beauty . . .': loc. cit. 84 S.

This remarkable definition of the power of art, as well as the exposure of fallacious equations between art and morality represents the obverse side of Lermontov's preoccupation with the unique phenomenon of the poet. Pushkin and the Lyubomudry, stressing respectively the creative aloofness of the poet and the metaphysical dimension to his work, helped to shape this preoccupation as did Schiller's ideas on the precise nature of artistic reality. But, as Maksimov stresses, Lermontov remained acutely aware of the perils of extreme aestheticism which accompany such a view of creativity: Lermontov who had sacrificed his whole life to poetic creativity, was concerned about the hypertrophy of art, its superabundance, the possibility that aesthetic concerns might outweigh all other forms of human activity.85 The religious scaffolding of Demon, the external moral preconcep- tions about God and the Devil, are necessary to the poem, for their function is to maximize the scope and effectiveness of what amounts to a definition of the legitimate claims of beauty. These preconcep- tions, religious or metaphysical in origin, do not preclude a psychological or humanistic interpretation of the Demon's identity; whereas a primarily humanistic interpretation of Demon does indeed effectively exclude the possibility of interpreting the poem meta- physically. Loginovskaya observes that 'we think we know about demons, but it turns out we know very little. The fact is, nowadays the word hardly gets used at all.'86 A pity perhaps if not only the word, but our understanding of it, is fading into oblivion, for with it fades not only the rich religious backcloth against which the work is enacted but also the true lineaments of the principal character, whom restoration in a different style but dimly recreates. 85 Maksimov, op. cit., p. 94. 86 Ye.
