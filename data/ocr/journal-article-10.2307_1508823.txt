<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW VOLUME 59 APRIL 1966 NUMBER 2 ON THE MEANING OF "GOD": TRANSCENDENCE WITHOUT MYTHOLOGY GORDON D. KAUFMAN HARVARD DIVINITY SCHOOL MANY have observed that modern man, more than the man of any other age, lives in a world from which God is absent, a genuinely secular world. Our forefathers had a sense of God's continuous providential guidance of history as a whole and of their individual destinies in particular; they found their lives meaningful because they were lived within the context of God's purposes, each man having his own unique place and task. But such meaning as most men of our time find is the this-worldly humanly-created meaning emergent from ordinary social inter- course and/or cultural activity. For some this loss of a trans- cendent source and purpose has reduced human life to meaning- lessness and absurdity, a pointless and empty burden simply to be endured (Beckett); others react with bitterness and revulsion (Sartre); still others seem to find sufficient satisfaction in their daily round of activities, punctuated occasionally by aesthetic experience or unusual excitement, not to miss or lament the dimensions of depth and transcendence and mystery in which previous generations found their lives ensconced. But in any case the radical "eclipse of God" (Buber) or even the final irretrievable "death of God" (Nietzsche) appears to be the most momentous theological fact of our age. Given this cultural con- text, it is little wonder that linguistic analysts find it dubious whether the word "God" has any genuinely specifiable meaning,' and theological writers, in a desperate attempt to rescue the Christian faith from what appears to be its certain demise, seek wholly "secular" interpretations which go so far as to dispense with the word and idea of "God" entirely.2 'For a summary of the discussion see F. Ferri, Language, Logic and God (New York, Harper, 1961), and also W. T. Blackstone, The Problem of Religious Knowledge (Englewood Cliffs [N.J.], Prentice-Hall, 1963). 2Cf., e.g., Paul Van Buren, The Secular Meaning of the Gospel (New York, Macmillan, 1963).</page><page sequence="2">106 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW I The problem with the concept of "God" arises out of the fundamental metaphysical-cosmological dualism found in the Bible (as well as in traditional metaphysics) and in virtually all Western religious thought.3 This is the division of reality into "earth" and "heaven" -that which is accessible to us in and through our experience and in some measure under our control, and that beyond our experience and not directly open to our knowledge or manipulation. The latter "world" is, if anything, more real and more significant than the experienced world, since it is God's own abiding place (from whence he directs the affairs of the cosmos) and man's ultimate home. In the Bible this dualism is expressed in full-blown mythological terms. Heaven is a kind of "place" or "world" in certain respects like the places found in the world of experience; it is peopled by "heavenly beings" and even a "heavenly court" visualized in analogy with earthly persons and political structures; and God is the absolute monarch ruling the cosmos in a way analogous to an Oriental despot. Some writers, e.g., Bultmann, have sup- posed that if it were possible for Christian thinking to rid itself of this somewhat crude and unbelievable mythological machinery, faith in God would once more become a live option for contem- porary man. But the difficulty is much deeper than that, for this elaborate and fantastic mythological imagery is simply a naive and embellished expression of a more fundamental problem: the religious presupposition of a reality other than or "beyond" this world, the assumption that the eminent reality with which we have to do - God - is somehow "out there" (or "up there" or "down there" or "in there" - it does not matter) beyond the given realities of our experience. For the purposes of his "demythologizing" program Bultmann defines mythology as "the use of imagery to express the other- worldly in terms of this world and the divine in terms of human 'Karl Barth, who supposes himself not to be engaged in metaphysical or cosmological "speculations," nevertheless makes a considerable point of the essen- tial duality of the world in the Christian view.

Clark, 1936-1962), III/I, 17ff.; 111/3, 369ff.; etc.</page><page sequence="3">THE MEANING OF GOD 107 life, the other side in terms of this side." 4 But this leaves un- questioned the most problematic feature of mythological think- ing: that there is an "otherworldly" or "other side" at all, which, in contrast with the "human," is to be viewed as "divine." At- tempting to resolve the problem of myth by cutting away most of the minor mythological realities (demons, angels, and other supernatural and superpersonal powers), but continuing to speak of an "exalted Christ," of the "Word of God" as something which comes to man from some "beyond," and of "acts of God" which transform men and history, is to miss entirely the central prob- lem posed by mythological language. For that problem does not arise from the mere picturing of another world ("heaven," "super- nature") over against our world, in imagery drawn from within our world; the problem is whether there is any significant reality at all "above" or "beyond" or "below" the world which we know in our experience, or whether life is to be understood simply in this-worldly, i.e., secular, terms. Demythologizing which fails to come to terms with the ultimate metaphysical-cosmological dual- ism expressed in the mythology, and in fact at the root, of all Western religious thinking, is not seriously facing up to the prob- lem of the irrelevance of Christian faith and the Christian church in contemporary life. Men of other ages found it necessary to create and believe elaborate mythologies and metaphysics of the "beyond" in order to understand their world and themselves. Contemporary men in contrast - partially freed by scientific advance from the ig- norance which mythological explanations attempted to fill, and through technological advance increasingly able to control forces which were to earlier generations simply mystery - find it more and more unnecessary and even ridiculous to make this dualistic assumption. They have learned in recent centuries that those claims to knowledge of reality which have warrant in this-worldly experience lead to prediction and control of their world, while speech about some "other world" or "supernatural reality" appears to be without warrant or significant effect, a merely traditional and probably superstitious usage. The authority of church and Bible no longer suffices to sustain the dualistic position; indeed, 4Kerygma and Myth, ed. H. W. Bartsch (London, S.P.C.K., 1953), io, n. 2.</page><page sequence="4">108 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW it is precisely the dubiousness to many moderns of the metaphysi- cal dualism which these "authorities" so unquestioningly take for granted that can be credited in part for their obviously waning significance in modern life. We seem thus faced with two options. The dualism can be given up without remainder as an unjustifiable metaphysical vestige from previous stages of civilization5 - and it is difficult to see how anything recognizably Christian would remain if one took this course without some qualifications. Or else we must find a way in the present situation to restate (in terms not simply presupposing the old dualistic mythology) the conten- tion that the ultimate reality with which man has to do is some- how "beyond" that which is directly given in experience. That is, we must seek to show in terms meaningful for our own time how it is possible and why it is significant to speak not only of this world but of "God." It is to this latter alternative that the present paper is directed.6 5 Auguste Comte more than a century ago, of course, already took this position, and he has proved to be the prophet of modern man in this respect. ' It should be observed that the present paper is concerned with the question of the meaning rather than the truth of statements containing the word "God." No attempt will be made here to prove either that God does or does not exist, that is, that the word "God" does or does not actually refer to a reality. Questions of that sort can be faced only if we already know what we mean when we use the word "God" - the issue to which this paper is directed. (It should be evident that - certain "neo-orthodox" theologians to the contrary notwithstanding - prior discussion of the meaning of "God" is just as important for "Christian faith" as for "philosophy of religion," for it is meaningless to speak of "what God has done" or "what God has revealed" if it is doubtful whether the word "God" itself has any referential meaning.) It is my contention that the underlying assumption both of theists and a-theists is that "God-language" presupposes the validity of what I have above called the mythological-cosmological dualism be- tween this world and another world, the holy and the secular, the eternal and the temporal, the absolute and the relative. Believers find themselves defending one or another of the several forms of this dualism; unbelievers (as well as many believers, if the truth be admitted) find the whole dualistic conception without sufficient warrant and possibly even a ludicrous vestige of earlier stages of culture. The question of the meaning and significance of speaking about God at all thus tends to get decided not in its own terms but on the basis of a prior attitude taken up toward the dualism of this world and the other. The purpose of the present paper is to show that the meaning of the word "God," even in its reference to the "transcendent," can be developed and understood entirely in terms of this-worldly (i.e., "secular") experiences and conceptions - that is, in terms fully compre- hensible and significant to the most "modern" of men - and that therefore the whole issue of a presupposed cosmological dualism, so problematic for modern man, can be bypassed. In English the word "God" is understood by some to designate a mere psychological projection of a father-image and by others to indicate the Father of Jesus Christ and the ultimate reality with which we have</page><page sequence="5">THE MEANING OF GOD 109 II We may begin our investigation by asking about the purpose or intention of "God-language." What function does the word "God" perform in religious and theological speech? That is, which experiences or problems in this world seem to require some people to talk about extramundane reality? And why do they think such an odd extrapolation or postulation is necessary? When one puts the question this way, the first thing to be observed is that the question about God-language has been transformed from a strictly logical to a quasi-historical form. The problem to which we shall initially address ourselves is not the abstract and general problem of proving to any rational mind the meaningfulness and even truth of the concept of "God"; it is, rather, the concrete problem of locating the context and situation in which the word "God" is used and found appropriate and meaningful. Clearly, only if this latter task is performed first can the former be under- taken with any hope of significant outcome. Indeed, it may turn out that this word or its context has a peculiar character which makes impossible such general logical justification. In connection with what sorts of questions or problems, then, has speech about God or another world emerged and been used? The answer is not far to seek. Such speech appears within the context of man's sense of limitation, finitude, guilt and sin, on the one hand, and his question about the meaning or value or significance of himself, his life, and his world, on the other.7 On the one hand, man knows himself to be limited in many to do. Since we are here attempting to uncover the basis on which significant conversation between such diverse points of view may proceed, and are not trying to prejudice the case for one or the other of these alternatives, it is evident that our delineation of meaning will need to have great flexibility. Doubtless to believers the present analysis may seem to concede too much to psychological reductionism; to unbelievers, too much to outgrown superstition. However, my intention is to favor neither view - that would be to argue the question of truth not meaning--but to provide a framework of meaning within which each can take up his position and arguments without prejudice, and within which, there- fore, genuinely significant conversation between them can once again proceed. 7The emphases of biblical faith on salvation, deliverance, succor, abundant life, forgiveness, resurrection, atonement, eternal life, etc. all have this double reference, negatively to man's inadequacy and need, and positively to man's mean- ingful destiny and fulfillment.</page><page sequence="6">110 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW respects: God (or the gods, angels, demons, etc.) is seen as the reality which is the final limit to his being and power. This is the experiential dimension of the claim that God is creator, sov- ereign, lord of the world, etc.: men experience themselves as "thrown" into a world (Heidegger) not of their own making and ultimately not under their control; they look forward to an end, death, which they may be able to defer slightly but which they can never avoid; they are hemmed in on all sides and determined by their peculiar aptitudes, temperaments, and interests, by the position in society and history into which they have been born, by circumstances of all sorts completely out of their control. The details of the analysis and elaboration of this awareness of limita- tion and weakness will of course differ widely in different cultures and traditions, and the way in which the limiting factor(s) - God - is understood will vary accordingly, but the basic fact of man's finiteness is rooted in man's actual situation as a particular limited being in the world. When in the course of evolution man emerged to full consciousness and self-consciousness, it was in- evitable that he would also become conscious of, and seek modes of interpretation of, this his finitude. The earliest forms of such interpretation were highly mythological and are no longer accept- able or meaningful to many moderns. But the problem which gave rise to those views remains, and talk about God in the con- temporary context must be understood as a modern way of seek- ing to speak about these same issues. In this respect the idea of God functions as a limiting concept, i.e., a concept which does not primarily have content in its own right drawn directly out of a specific experience but which refers to that which we do not know but which is the ultimate limit of all our experiences. While ancient man spoke with some confidence in his knowledge of this reality beyond the limits of his world - and it is just this which makes his thought "mythological" or "gnostic," and dubious to many today - most moderns are somewhat more fastidious and restrict themselves to positive affirmation about only what falls this side of the limits.8 But it must be observed that we, like sIn this respect modern man appears to be more heir of the skeptical than the metaphysical tradition in philosophy. One remembers, for example, the speech of Hume's Philo at the end of Part 8 of the Dialogues Concerning Natural</page><page sequence="7">THE MEANING OF GOD 111 ancient men, are also involved in a certain duality here, i.e., be- tween what is in fact concretely experienced, and the limit(s) of all experience and knowledge. On the other hand, as a being who lives in a world of symbolic meanings (i.e., who is a linguistic being) and values (i.e., who is a deciding and acting being, making choices between alternatives), man asks about the meaning and value of his own existence. His conscious experience and thought is made possible by his ability symbolically to compare and contrast the fragments and pieces of experience with each other through the creation of words and symbols and thus to build up a symbolical and ordered world of increasingly comprehensive wholes. His action in and measure of control over his world is made possible by his learning to create and define standards or criteria for evaluating alternatives be- fore him, and his learning to discriminate with increasing precision between the realities of his experience in terms of these norms. It is only natural, then, that he should ask about the meaning of his own existence within this structured world in which he finds himself, and the value of himself and his activity in the midst of all these other valued realities. This question becomes especially urgent in the light of his ultimate limitation and powerlessness, which seem to suggest that no lasting meaning or value can be placed on his being; certainly he by himself could not be its ade- quate source or ground. Once more, then, an answer to this question could be found only beyond the limits of human possi- bilities and knowledge. Here again the mythologies of earlier generations were able to provide concrete answers. In the "other world," the world "beyond the grave," the inequities and injustices of this life are made right (doctrines of karma and the judgment Religion: "All religious systems, it is confessed, are subject to great and insuper- able difficulties. Each disputant triumphs in his turn, while he carries on an offensive war, and exposes the absurdities, barbarities, and pernicious tenets of his antagonist. But all of them, on the whole, prepare a complete triumph for the sceptic, who tells them that no system ought ever to be embraced with regard to such subjects: for this plain reason that no absurdity ought ever to be assented to with regard to any subject. A total suspense of judgment is here our only reasonable resource. And if every attack, as is commonly observed, and no defence among theologians is successful, how complete must be his victory who remains always, with all mankind, on the offensive, and has himself no fixed station or abiding city which he is ever, on any occasion, obliged to defend?"</page><page sequence="8">112 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW of God, of heaven and of hell) and the value and meaning of human existence is assured. Though such affirmations could hardly be made simply on the basis of this-worldly experience, the religious myths provided a gnosis of the "beyond" (i.e., of God's nature and will, or of the ultimate order of things) which gave adequate assurance. In contrast, contemporary man finds it ex- ceedingly difficult to speak with any confidence at all about that which is beyond the limits of his world, although the duality (between what is accessible to us and some ultimate limit) may be acknowledged. It is in the context of these questions and problems about man's finitude and the significance of his existence in the light of this finitude that the meaning and use of the word "God" should be understood. That is, our speech about this Other arises because certain features of experience force us up against the limit(s) of all possible knowledge and experience. If there were no ex- periences within the world which brought us in this way up against the Limit of our world - if there were no point at which man sensed his finitude - then there would be no justification what- soever for the use of "God-language." 9 This means that any persons (positivists?) who by temperament or training either do not often find themselves forced up against these limits or do not choose to reflect on them when they are will find speech about God seeming useless or empty. Since it is in relation to this par- ticular context of problems and experience and language that "God" has meaning or justifiable use, its significance or validity cannot be demonstrated to anyone who either refuses to acknowl- edge the legitimacy of the context or any substantial interest in it. In this sense, the problem of the meaning and importance of theological speech depends upon matters of temperament and history. But, though not everyone will acknowledge the signifi- cance of questions about the Limit, to those who do, such ques- tions will appear to be of universal import; for every man (whether he acknowledges it or not and whether he is interested in this or not) stands under and within the limits here under con- sideration. It is not unimportant to raise the question, then, about ' The highly complex character of this "experience" of finitude will be briefly analyzed below in Section IV.</page><page sequence="9">THE MEANING OF GOD 113 the degree to which one's understanding of the issues here in- volved depends on the traditions which seem to him significant as well as the climactic historical occurrences in his own life. III We must now examine further the content of the term "God." Though the fact of ultimate limitations on our being and mean- ing provides the context within which religious language arises and has meaning, it is clear that more is intended by that language than simply the bare and abstract notion of Limit. It is not sur- prising that primitive man, in confronting this situation, created imagery (in analogy with certain concrete powers within his ex- perience) by means of which the power of the ultimate Limit could be conceived; and so the mythological "other world" ap- peared as the home of the mysterious powers that invaded and controlled this world. Our modern problem with theological lan- guage arises out of the fact that we no longer find it justifiable or meaningful to speak of this other world and the powers which inhabit it. Even when, in more sophisticated interpretations, the plethora of mythological powers supposedly controlling human destiny is reduced to one - God (or, as in a contemporary highly bloodless form, "being-itself") -we are dubious of the claims to knowledge. And that for a rather obvious reason: if it is really the limits of our experience and knowledge with which we are here dealing, by what right can anyone speak of the nature or even the existence of reality beyond those limits? Here sheer agnosticism would seem to be not merely prudent but the only honest course as well. Inasmuch as theological language often claims or pretends to speak of that beyond the limits of the humanly experienceable - even, upon occasion, claiming to know on the basis of "revelation" about the inner workings of the divine being(s) - it is not sur- prising that such talk seems highly dubious and even sheer non- sense to many. Limit means limit. And it is both deceitful and inconsistent on the one hand to justify talk about God on the ground of our limitedness, and then, on the other, to transcend those limits in order to spell out in some detail the structure of</page><page sequence="10">114 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the reality that lies beyond them. Insofar as theological language is involved in this sort of self-contradiction and self-delusion, it very rightly has fallen into ill repute. If the experiential base which justifies the very use of theological terms is man's aware- ness of his own finitude, then the fact of that finitude must be consistently adhered to in that language; and the too easy trans- cending of finitude implicit in every form of mythology must be renounced. Because the awareness of the "boundary situation" (Jaspers) within which man lives was first expressed in mytho- logical forms which themselves implicitly ignored that boundary,'0 it has been extremely difficult to discern clearly the experiential base which justifies theological language. Consequently it has been supposed, both within the theological community and with- out, that theology deals primarily in otherworldly realities. From this common assumption the religious have proudly drawn the conclusion that they have been granted a secret gnosis denied others, while the worldly supposed that theology dealt simply in old wives' tales and other superstitions about some "other world" which the imagination of man has fabricated out of whole cloth. Neither side was able to focus clearly on the actual base in con- crete experience from which theological work proceeds, thus giv- ing an interpretation of religious language which could justify its use to contemporary secular man. It is clear that if we have located correctly the experiential context of speech about God, the theological vocabulary will have to be rebuilt from the ground up with a much more sensitive ear to the epistemological conse- quences for theology itself of the fundamental religious situation of limitedness." 10o It may be observed in passing that, despite all his strictures to the contrary, Jaspers also really allows his alleged "boundary situations" to be surpassable under certain circumstances in the experience of what he calls "transcendence" (see, e.g., Philosophie [Berlin, Springer Verlag, 1948, 2nd ed.], 44ff., 47o, 675ff.). In the respect and degree to which this is the case his conception and analysis of finitude represents one more attempt to deny its real meaning, and my more drastic interpretation of the "boundary situation" should not be confused with his. (For similar criticism of Jaspers, see also Karl Barth's analysis in Church Dogmatics, 111/2, 109-21.) n It goes without saying that my repeated use of such terms as "finite," "limit," etc. is meant simply to characterize man; the respects in which man's finitude might be either "good" or "evil" is not considered. The usage is intended as neutral description.</page><page sequence="11">THE MEANING OF GOD 115 It is not possible to undertake that project in any detail in this paper. The most that can be done is to analyze briefly the com- plex character of the awareness of our finitude and the special understanding of that awareness implicit in the use of the word "God." It must be clear, of course, just what I am attempting here. I am not seeking to develop a full-blown doctrine of God on the basis of a kind of natural theology of human finitude. Rather, I am trying to define with some precision the sort of "God-talk" which is justifiable and responsible from that base, as well as the limitations which must be imposed on theological speech when one seeks to avoid presupposing the traditional - and illegitimate! in the modern view - mythology of two worlds. (If someone wishes to live and speak within that mythological framework, of course that is his business. I am here concerned with searching out the meaning which theological language can have for those of us who no longer find warrant for or meaning in that dualism.) We begin then with a somewhat different duality than that of two-world thinking: the duality of experience and its Limit(s). Such content of the term "God" as derives from an alleged gnosis of some "other world," transmitted by mythological traditions, may not be admitted to consideration here, for our interest is in defining the meaning which the awareness of our finitude as such permits and requires. IV What kind of conception is this notion of ultimate Limit? Some existentialist literature seems to suggest that there is a particular immediate experience involved here which is to be contrasted with other experiences of lesser limits. I do not think this is a very careful reading of the matter. All that we ever experience directly are particular events of suffering, death (of others), joy, peace, etc. It is only in reflection upon these and the attempt to under- stand ourselves in the light of these happenings that we become aware of our limitedness on all sides. Along with this awareness of our being hemmed in, powerful emotions of terror, despair, revulsion, anxiety, and the like, are often - perhaps always -</page><page sequence="12">116 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW generated, and this total intellectual-emotional complex may then be called the "experience of finitude" or awareness of the "bound- ary situation," or something of the sort. But it must be observed that this "experience" of radical contingency is not an immediate awareness of restriction, as when one butts one's head directly against a stone wall; it depends rather upon a generalization from such occasional immediate experiences of limitation to the total situation of the self. The self, in this way perceived as hemmed in on all sides, comes to a new and deeper awareness of its nature and powers: it is finite, master neither of itself nor of its world. Thus, the so-called experience of finitude or contingency, how- ever powerful the emotions which accompany and deepen and reinforce it, has an intellectual root, and it is possible only because man is a reflective being. (Dogs also die, but this does not lead them to despair over canine life, because they, presumably, are unable to anticipate their own death imaginatively and reflect on its meaning.) As we shall see below, the peculiar character of this complex experience - being rooted in particular simple ex- periences of restriction, but apprehended as referring to the con- tingency of the self (and of man generally) in every moment, man's boundedness on all sides - enables it to be the experiential ground both of theological conceptions and of nontheistic meta- physical schemas as well. It is with the aid of concepts such as limit that the generalizing movement of consciousness from particular immediate experiences of restriction to the total situation of the self is made. This term, originally applying to physical boundary lines (e.g., between fields or nations), here becomes used metaphorically to designate the self's awareness of being circumscribed or hemmed in. How is such restriction and limitation to be conceived? The imagery built into the notion of limit by its physical origins reminds us that every actual limit or boundary which marks off and restricts real being (in contrast to, for example, a mathematical limit or similar abstract "limiting idea") must itself be conceived as a reality, as having some kind of substance and structure."2 Thus, "I do not think the notion of a mathematical limit, which is always ap- proached asymptotically but never actually reached, can serve as a root concep- tion for the notion of metaphysical limit with which we are here working. For</page><page sequence="13">THE MEANING OF GOD 117 a city wall is made of earth and stones, a fence of wire and posts, etc. It is important to observe here, however, that only because we can examine the wall or fence from all sides, test it in various ways, and the like - that is, only because the limit is not an ultimate or absolute limit but can be surpassed - is it possible for us to know the stuff of which it consists. If we could not in any way get beyond the limit we were examining, we would have no means of directly discovering its nature but would have to construct the conception of it imaginatively out of elements more fully known in our experience. Consider, for example, the situation of a man imprisoned in a cell outside of which he has never been and from which he absolutely cannot escape. If he seeks to conceive the restricting walls of his room--with their resistance to his efforts to push through them, their hardness and solidity and color - as (ma- terial) realities, he will be able to do so only in analogy with the experienceable (material) objects within the room. Thus, his conclusion that the walls are composed of some sort of thickness of material substance, however plausible, in fact presupposes an interpretation of that which is beyond what is directly experience- able by him, namely, the bare surface of the walls. The concep- tion of the ultimate limit of his movements is constructed imagi- natively out of elements derived from objects within his experience that partially restrict and limit him; for the stuff or structure of the walls themselves - that "behind" their surfaces - cannot be directly known, though the restrictingness of the walls is, of course, directly experienced. The same point about the way in which the notion of the ulti- mate Limit is conceived by analogy with certain relative limits known within experience may be made with reference to another illustration, the ancient image of the "end of the world" - a kind the awareness of finitude is not purely conceptual or hypothetical; it is an aware- ness of my actual being as here (in this time and place) rather than there, as restricted in this particular concrete way by aptitudes, interests and training, as one which must and shall in fact die. It is the awareness of my being limited that we are here dealing with and thus in some sense an actual "encounter" with that which limits me. The notion of an asymptotic approach to a limit is simply not applicable, and we must revert to the physical experiences of limitation for models for our concept.</page><page sequence="14">118 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW of final edge of a bottomless abyss beyond which it is impossible to go. In this case it is obvious that what is beyond the Limit is being imagined rather precisely in terms of the intramundane experience of dangerous cliffs and other places from which one might fall to his destruction. Even the abstract notion of limit itself, we may now recall, was drawn originally from the experi- ence of (relative) physical boundaries; only by analogical exten- sion of its meaning could it be applied to the self in such a way that the sense of being completely circumscribed and confined - the awareness underlying the concept of finitude - could de- velop.13 It is hardly surprising, then, that when we seek to con- ceive this Limit concretely, as restricting and constricting our actual being, images and notions drawn from concrete intramun- dane experiences of limitation provide the material making up the conception. Certain characteristics of known finite limits are abstracted from their context, and built by analogy into the notion of the ultimate Limit. Our problem, now, is to discern what ex- periences provide the images and what restrictions must be laid down governing their use in this way. Let us recall what it is that is being limited here and see how its limits are in fact experienced. It is not property or a nation or even the world with which we are here concerned, but the self. The self's awareness of being restricted on all sides, rendering problematic the very meaning of its existence, gives rise to the question: What is it that in this way hems us in? How is this ultimate Limit, of which we are aware in the "experience of fini- tude," to be conceived? There appear to be four fundamental types of limiting experience, and these supply models with the aid of which the ultimate Limit can be conceived. The first two are relatively simple: a) selves experience external physical limi- tation and restriction upon their activities through the resistance "1 In view of this complex structure of the concept of limit--it being derived from the experience of relative limits which can be surpassed, and then extended to the notion of ultimate Limit which cannot - we should really not be surprised that men of all ages have supposed they actually knew something of that beyond the Limit, and that they expressed this in what I have above designated as mythological thinking. The duality of conscious finite being and Limit very easily, and almost naturally, goes over into the dualism of this world and the other world. These facts also throw light on the roots and meaning of Kant's first antinomy.</page><page sequence="15">THE MEANING OF GOD 119 of material objects over against them; b) they experience from within the organic limitation of their own powers, especially in illness, weakness, failure, exhaustion, etc. The other two are somewhat more complex: c) they experience the external personal limitation of other selves engaged in activities and programs run- ning counter to their own - i.e., the clash of wills, decisions and purposes - but precisely because matters of volition and inten- tion are subjective, this experience is neither simply internal nor external but is interpersonal and social; d) they experience the normative constraints and restrictions upon them expressed in such distinctions as true-false, real-illusory, good-bad, right- wrong, beautiful-ugly, etc., which distinctions, though felt sub- jectively and from within, appear to the self not to be its own spontaneous creations but to impinge upon it with categorical demands and claims. The self is restricted in its actual willing and acting, in its formulation of projects and its attempts to actualize them, in each of these quite different ways. Each is the basis for a peculiar experience of the nature of limitation which cannot be reduced to any of the others. Thus, for example, it is not possible to understand the sense of being at cross purposes with and thus restricted by another person, in terms simply of the concept of physical resistance or limitation, any more than the experience of utter weakness in connection with a severe illness can be compre- hended with categories derived from the concept of logical ne- cessity. Though these four modes of experienced limitation may sometimes be confused with each other and often (or perhaps always) are experienced in complex interconnection with each other, they are obviously distinct and separate. In each case the limiter is conceived in somewhat different terms so as to be ap- propriate to that of the self which is actually restricted. Thus, material objects impose physical restrictions, and physiological deficiencies limit our organic capacities; other active wills are responsible for personal constraints, while values and ideals im- pinge with normative force. In a situation such as imprisonment I experience physical restriction (the prison walls), but am also aware of the personal constraint of other wills (those who built the prison and put me in it), and perhaps of organic deterioration</page><page sequence="16">120 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW (increasing weakness due to poor food, lack of exercise, etc.). Each restriction is involved with the others and with the concrete situation of imprisonment, and some (e.g., the physical restric- tions) may be the result of others (the conflict of wills) and essen- tial to the effective realization of those others; but none of the limiters can be reduced to any of the others. Escape from prison will not dissolve the conflict of wills, and personal reconciliation will not correct malnutrition. In each case the specific limiter restricting the self must be dealt with appropriately to its own nature. If we turn now from this identification of the variety of finite limiters to the problem of understanding the ultimate Limit, it will be clear that there are a number of possibilities. The ultimate Limit could be understood on analogy with any one of the types of finite limiter, or through some combination of several of them; but there is no way of grasping the nature of the ultimate Limit simply and purely in its own terms. For, in the first place, if this is really the Limit beyond which we can never move at all, then by definition there could be no way for us directly to apprehend its character; at best we could experience and know its "surface," that is, its mere impingement as such, its limitingness, a quite abstract notion. But the ultimate Limit --being that which is apprehended as the real and effective restriction on our being and movement (no mere "empty idea") - is grasped as concrete actuality impinging on us, i.e., not merely abstractly but as having some concrete character or nature. Moreover, in the second place, as the preceding analysis has shown, awareness of the ultimate Limit is no fifth entirely distinct type of direct and immediate experience of limitation; on the contrary, this awareness arises only mediately through complex acts which generalize the immedi- ate and particular experiences of constraints upon the self into the "experience of finitude." 14 It is out of this complex experience that the question about an ultimate Limit over against the self first arises and it is within this context that any apprehension "1It will be observed that, though in many respects my position resembles Schleiermacher's, at this point I am setting myself against his contention that we have a specific and unique sense of absolute dependence as such (cf. The Christian Faith [Edinburgh, T. &amp; T. Clark, 19281, ? 3-5).</page><page sequence="17">THE MEANING OF GOD 121 or conception of the ultimate Limit will emerge.1 Insofar as its character or nature is explicitly conceived at all, it will evidently be understood then, with the aid of one or more of the actually experienced finite limiters (the experiences of which are the only concrete sorts of limitation we know), and will be interpreted in terms of implications derived from that (or those) image(s). Moreover, since there is no possible way to prove the special appropriateness of any one or combination of the finite limiters to perform this function (again, that would presuppose a direct knowledge of the nature of the absolute Limit, which, as we have seen, is not available), it is evident that any particular concrete conception of the ultimate Limit may be quite arbitrary.'6 Despite ' It might be helpful to summarize here the various phases of the complex process through which, according to this analysis, the conception of an ultimate Limit is formulated: (I) there must be particular concrete experiences of limita- tion (of the several types described); (2) the self must be sufficiently mature and reflective to be able to move from consciousness of these particular experiences to a more general concept of limitation or finitude; (3) the awareness of the significance that it is I who am in this inescapable way hemmed in must arise, together with the powerful emotions which contribute to the "experience of finitude"; (4) this awareness of my own radical contingency may then give rise to the question about what it is which so confines and limits me; (5) the ultimate Limit may then be conceived in terms of one (or possibly some combination) of the four types of finite limiter. It should not be thought that the complexity of this process in any way prejudices the legitimacy of the question (4) or the possible truth of the answer (5). For it is certainly conceivable that we are limited ulti- mately by some (one) reality, and, if so, that only through some such complex process could we -all our knowledge being rooted in experiences of the finite-- come to know it. As we shall see below, if the ultimate Limit were personal (as the notion of "God" suggests), we would expect him to be known through complex mediatorial processes in any case (as is a finite person), and there would seem to be no reason why these processes could not include the sort here suggested (cf. note 25, below). On the other hand, it must also be admitted that there seems to be no compelling necessity to move from step (3) in the above process through (4) and (5). One could claim (positivistically), if one chose to do so, that the only what which limits me are the four types of finite limiter as experienced in (I), and that there is no reason to suppose there is some one reality beyond and behind these which is the ultimate Limiter. The fact that the present analysis of the consciousness of finitude lends itself to such varied sorts of interpretation is no shortcoming: it means, rather, that significantly different perspectives - from positivism to a variety of types of metaphysics and Christian theology - can enter into common discourse with the aid of this framework, and this is precisely what we are seeking to make possible with this analysis (see note 6, above). 1 It is, of course, better that we be aware of these peculiar difficulties in the conception with which we are dealing here than, in ignorance, simply refuse to face the question at all. In this respect Kant, who saw that we could never</page><page sequence="18">122 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW this difficulty we cannot avoid conceiving the Limit as concrete, for if it is apprehended at all, it must be apprehended as that which in fact constricts and constrains the actual concrete self. Any of the types of finite limiter could serve as the model in terms of which a conception of the ultimate Limit might be de- veloped, but difficulties arise when any one of them is used ex- clusively. Thus, when physical limitation is taken as the funda- mental analogy, a materialistic world-view results and man's being is understood as simply a function of the physical universe. This is a common enough view and has much to commend it, notably the obvious dependence of all man's functions on his physical being. However, it is very difficult to see how the other types of limiter are to be understood simply in physical terms. This problem is often dealt with in modern times through some conception of emergent evolution, but the problems here are immense and probably insoluble for a purely materialistic point of view. Hence one may be led, as with Whitehead or Bergson, to seek a resolution of the difficulties with some sort of organicism or vitalism. Yet it is difficult to see how the notion of organic limitation is really of much help in developing a conception of the world which does justice to the other limiters. Similar pro- blems arise with the various forms of idealism which take norma- tive limitation to be the most fundamental. However, our objective here is not to resolve these difficult problems of metaphysics but rather to examine the grounds for speech about God when the traditional mythological dualism is given up. The ultimate experiential ground for such speech should now be evident. Talk about God appears when the ultimate Limit is understood on analogy with the experience of personal limiting as known in the intercourse and interaction of personal wills. In this respect religious faith opts for one particular meta- physical alternative from among the several available. However, this metaphysical decision is not of mere speculative interest, for resolve the antinomies and problems of metaphysics but who also saw that we could never cease struggling with these issues (see, e.g., The Critique of Pure Reason, A849/B877-A851/B879), was much wiser than many of his latter-day (positivistic, existentialistic, and fideistic) followers.</page><page sequence="19">THE MEANING OF GOD 123 the option involved is active will, that over against which a self can live in interaction and intercourse and communion. The other options understand the ultimate Limit in terms of an image of dead being or passive structure (as a quasi-physical limiter or like certain aspects of a normative limiter), or else as a vital but unconscious and certainly purposeless force (like an organic limiter and/or certain other features of a normative limiter). Though each of these significantly interprets certain dimensions of our experience, none of them comes directly to grips with our distinctive experience as persons in communities, as conscious, active, deciding, purposing beings living in a symbolical world which provides the context and the possibility for continuous com- munication and intercourse with others. The interpretation of the ultimate Limit in terms of this social level and dimension of our experience--which, however dependent it may be on the others in many respects, is the presupposition of our having any experience (properly so called) - is the metaphysical preroga- tive of theistic religion and defines its peculiar character. The religious attractiveness of this metaphysics - in that the ulti- mate context of human existence is here seen as personal and purposive volitional activity and not dead matter or unfeeling logical structure or unconscious vital power - makes theism rele- vant to the existential problems of the person in a way unmatched by any of the other metaphysical alternatives." Hence, it very naturally appears as the essential ideological dimension of most religious faith. But precisely this same attractiveness makes theistic belief seem so dubious to many, in that the powerful de- sire of man to find genuine purpose and meaning in his life here seems too easily and happily fulfilled. The intrinsic anthropo- morphism of this perspective thus makes it at once suspect and seductive. (This, of course, really does not bear directly on the question of its actual truth, since all the metaphysical alternatives conceive the ultimate Limit with the aid of a more or less arbi- trarily chosen finite model.) "1 If in this paper I were seeking an argument for the truth of theism, instead of limiting myself to an analysis of the experiential bases for - and thus the root meaning of--the word "God," it would be necessary and appropriate to expand and develop some of the implications of these sentences. (See also note 19, below.)</page><page sequence="20">124 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW V When a personal limiter is the analogical basis for understand- ing the ultimate Limit, a doctrine of God results. The ultimate Limit is then conceived in quasi-personal terms to be understood most decisively with notions drawn originally from the language used to deal with interpersonal experience. It is clear that this conception is the one operative in the biblical tradition where God is spoken of as lord, father, judge, king, etc., and he is said to love and hate, to make covenants with his people, to perform "mighty acts," to be characterized by mercy, forgiveness, faith- fulness, patience, wisdom, and the like - all terms drawn from the linguistic region of interpersonal discourse. Moreover, the biblical God is understood not to be accessible to man's every beck and call; he is not some structure or reality immanent in human experience and thus directly available to man. On the contrary, he resides in lofty transcendence, whence he acts in complete freedom to change the course of history or to reveal himself to his people through his prophets. Now it is clear that this image of inaccessible transcendence and freedom made known and effective through explicit acts of communication and power - through words and deeds - is built up analogically from the model of the hiddenness and transcendence and freedom of the finite self, who also can (in some significant measure) hide himself from his fellows and remain inaccessible, except as he chooses to manifest himself through acts and words.'s Though other terminology and images are also found in the biblical materials, there can be no doubt that personalistic language and conceptions most decisively shape the biblical view of the ultimate Limit. I contended earlier in this paper, however, that the biblical and Christian traditions appear determined in large part by a metaphysical-cosmological dualism characteristic of mythology and no longer meaningful to many moderns. Moreover, it has " For a full discussion of this claim that genuine transcendence is intrinsically a personalistic notion and can be consistently developed only in connection with a personalistic conception of God, see my paper on "Two Models of Trans- cendence," published in The Heritage of Christian Thought, Essays in Honor of Robert L. Calhoun, ed. R. E. Cushman and E. Grislis (New York, Harper and Row, 1965).</page><page sequence="21">THE MEANING OF GOD 125 often been held that precisely the anthropomorphic image of God as personal is an especially crude example of the mythological thinking of primitive man and therefore to be regarded as only symbolic or picture language, of significance in worship or prayer but not adequate for precise theological or philosophical work. We must now ask, therefore, how far a personalistic conception of God is essentially bound up with an inadequate mythology, how far it may be an independent and justifiable interpretation of the ultimate Limit. It should be evident that to conceive the ultimate Limit per- sonalistically is formally neither more nor less mythological than to conceive it on analogy with any of the other types of finite limiter. Each has its own peculiar appropriateness to certain dimensions of the self's experience of limitation, and each has difficulty in interpreting the other dimensions. With respect to the experience of limitation itself, then, no reason for preferring any of the four to the others can be given.'9 Moreover, inasmuch as it is necessary to grasp the ultimate Limit in terms of some model if it is to be adequately conceived at all, the attempt to grasp it personalistically should not be rejected as mythological (in the dubious sense of claiming unwarranted knowledge of that beyond the Limit) in any way not also applicable to every other attempt to apprehend and understand our finitude. In a manner not characteristic of the other finite limiters, how- ever, the personalistic image lends itself to a reopening of the question not only of the Limit, but of what is beyond it. For (as we noted above) it interprets man's relationship to that which ultimately limits him as being like his relationship to the finite selves with which he is in interaction. Such selves over against me always transcend in their subjectivity and freedom what is directly accessible to me in my experience (i.e., their bodies) even though they "come to me" and communicate with me in and through this physical dimension of their being that is open to my " It might be noted here, however, that inasmuch as the personalistic model involves the notion of a self whose active center is beyond that which is directly experienced, the latter being conceived as the vehicle or medium of the self's action or revelation (see below), there is a certain flexibility and breadth in theism enabling it to deal with the considerable diversity of types of finite limiter some- what more easily, perhaps, than can other kinds of metaphysics.</page><page sequence="22">126 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW view. What I directly experience of the other, strictly speaking, are the external physical sights and sounds which he makes, not the deciding, acting, purposing center of the self --though I have no doubt these externalities are not merely physical phe- nomena but are the outward and visible expression of inner thought, purpose, intention. Thus I do not speak merely of "sights and sounds" but of the "sights and sounds which he makes" in his attempt to act or to communicate. In my inter- action with other persons I presuppose a reality (the active center of the self) beyond that which I immediately perceive, a reality encountered by me and known to me not simply in physiologically- based perception (though that is of course also involved) but in and through the language which we jointly speak.20 It is in the act of communication that we discover that the other is more than merely physical being, is a conscious self; it is in the experience of speaking and hearing that we come to know the personal hidden behind and in the merely physical.21 This is the most powerful experience we have of transcendence of the given on the finite level, the awareness of genuine activity and reality beyond and behind what is directly open to our view. When this type of complex interrelationship is used to interpret the ultimate Limit, it is clear that an active reality (or "self") beyond the Limit - beyond what is directly experienceable as such - will be implied. A self in its active center is never di- rectly open to view, but is known only as he reveals himself in communication and communion. Likewise, on this model God cannot be identified with what is accessible to or within our ex- perience, not even with the ultimate Limit of our experience; rather this Limit must be grasped as the medium through which God encounters us (as noises and gestures are media for finite selves), God himself being conceived as the dynamic acting real- 2'To avoid confusion in this already very complex analysis, I shall use the term "encounter" to designate the linguistic-experiential ground of our knowledge of other selves, reserving the more general term "experience" for the sensory- perceptual foundations of our knowledge of physical objects (including the bodies of persons qua their purely physical character). 21For a more linguistically oriented treatment of these problems which comes to fundamentally similar conclusions on the basis of careful analysis of personalistic modes of speech, see Stuart Hampshire, Thought and Action (New York, Viking Press, i96o).</page><page sequence="23">THE MEANING OF GOD 127 ity beyond the Limit.22 In this way a certain reference to reality beyond the Limit of our experience is intrinsic to the personalistic image, and therefore such reference need not depend upon nor involve a reversion to mythology. It must be emphasized, how- ever, that reference of this sort to transcendent reality is justifi- able only when the ultimate Limit is understood in terms of a personal limiter; for only in the interaction with other selves do we encounter an active reality which comes to us from beyond what is accessible in experience. Organic, physical and normative limiters can all be interpreted exhaustively in terms of what is given in and to experience (though it is not essential to do so), and it is mythology, therefore, if one speaks of a transcendent extra-experiential reality on the basis of one of those models; a personal limiter alone necessarily and intrinsically involves genu- ine transcendence.23 Correlative with this reference to a locus of reality beyond the Limit there must be a conception of revelation. We know the transcendent reality of other selves only as they act toward and communicate with us, as they reveal to us their reality and char- acter and purposes in word and deed. So also, only if we are prepared to acknowledge some genuine encounter with God " In an early paper Paul Tillich seemed to be taking a position close to the analysis of this essay. "The non-symbolic element in all religious knowledge is the experience of the unconditioned as the boundary, ground, and abyss of every- thing conditioned. This experience is the boundary-experience of human reason and therefore expressible in negative-rational terms. But the unconditioned is not God. God is the affirmative concept pointing beyond the boundary of the negative-rational terms and therefore itself a positive-symbolic term" ("Symbol and Knowledge," Journal of Liberal Religion [I940], II, 203). Tillich, however, failed to refine his analysis and develop his insight. Thus, the peculiar character of "boundary experiences" remains unanalyzed here, and the "boundary" can even be interpreted in terms of such positive images as the (almost hypostatized) "unconditioned" or "ground"; this blurs its radical character as the ultimate unsurpassable Limit. Again (similarly to my analysis), "God" is distinguished from "the unconditioned" as "a positive-symbolic term" pointing beyond the ultimate boundary, but Tillich fails to see (either here or anywhere else in his writings) that this is because of the peculiar character of the transcendence known only in interpersonal relations and is thus intrinsically connected with the per- sonalistic overtones of the term "God." In his later writings, where Tillich apparently gives up the view that the "non-symbolic element in all religious knowledge" is a special experience and holds instead that we can make at least one nonsymbolic statement about God (see, e.g., Systematic Theology [Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1951], I, 238ff.), there remains little resemblance to the view I am trying to develop in the present essay. ' For further discussion, see my paper cited in note I8.</page><page sequence="24">128 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW through his own actions directed toward us, is it appropriate to speak of the ultimate Limit in personalistic terms, i.e., with "God"-language. By definition we could know nothing of any personal being beyond the Limit of our experience if that being did not in some way manifest himself to us through our experience or its Limit.24 Once again, the organic, physical and normative analogies for understanding the ultimate Limit require no doctrine of revelation, nor is any appropriate to them. This is the mode of knowledge characteristic of interpersonal communion, and it is when such encounters are taken as the model for understanding the Limit of all experience that the category of revelation is required.25 Thus, to speak of God acting or God revealing him- 'Since, according to the present analysis, every positive doctrine of God must rest on revelation, it should be clear both a) why no real doctrine of God appears in this paper (no concrete revelation being expounded here), and b) that the present analysis of "limit" is not to be confused with the "negative way" to God. 25 It will be observed that, according to the analysis presented in this paper, the "encounter" with God actually rests on a double mediation, whereas our encounters with finite selves involve only the single mediation (of noises, visible gestures, etc.) discussed in the text: a) the ultimate Limit is not immediately experienced, but is known only through the mediation provided by reflection on and generalization of particular experiences of limitation (cf. note 15, above); b) the "selfhood" or "nature" of God is not immediately experienced or directly encountered, but is known through the mediation of the ultimate Limit. This does not mean, however, that an "encounter" with God is really the product of a rather long chain of somewhat dubious inferences and no encounter with a reality at all. Rather, as the encounter with other selves makes clear, such com- munication through media is the mode in which realities transcending the reach of our immediate experience are known to us. In such an encounter, of course, I do not attend directly to the mediating processes (the noises the other is making); rather, I am conscious of him, of the speaker. Insofar as I must attend to his words, consciously, in bewilderment about their meaning, making deliberate in- ferences, the process of communication is halting and ineffective. Only if I can and do "leap beyond" the media to the self who is mediated through these words is there significant encounter with the other. In most of our intercourse with others precisely this leap is made in the most natural fashion; this is why we say we know the other person, and not merely the noises he makes. In a similar way, God is never directly "experienced," but is "encountered" (as is appropriate to his transcendence) only in and through media. (The double mediation involved in this case, in contrast with finite selves, is appropriate to the fact that this is God, and not merely some intramundane reality, of which we are here speaking.) If the media are the focus of attention here, of course the encounter with God will seem problematic and unreal; as with a finite self, only if and when a "leap beyond" the media (although through the media) occurs will the encounter with God be felt as genuine, i.e., only then could one properly speak of God being encountered. Theologically such moments are referred to as "revelation," i.e., God's self-manifestation. It is only because men have believed these to have occurred to themselves, or others, that talk about "encounters" with</page><page sequence="25">THE MEANING OF GOD 129 self is not necessarily to make a mythological statement presup- posing an unjustified and unjustifiable metaphysical-cosmological dualism; such forms of conceptualization and speech are neces- sary if and whenever a personal limiter is taken as the model for grasping the ultimate Limit. VI Most attempts to locate the experiential referent or basis for the term "God" heretofore have accepted the framework of what I here called metaphysical or mythological dualism and then tried to justify it in terms of some sort of direct "experience of God," or "apprehension of the infinite," or something similar. For those who had such experiences or intuitions, these analyses doubtless had meaning and significance; but for others of a more secular or this-worldly temperament or turn of mind, this seemed to be nothing more than paying rather extravagant "metaphysical compliments" to certain dimensions of experience. The present analysis does not rest on the assumed validity of some esoteric experience of the other world or the supernatural or even the "numinous" (Otto). On the contrary, I have claimed that the experiential root of the notion of God is simply the awareness of Limit or finitude (known in some form by every man). In and of itself this awareness does not presuppose or imply some "infi- nite" or "unconditional" being. Indeed, only when it is grasped and interpreted in concrete personalistic terms does the Limit become understood as the expression of a being transcending our world, i.e., of an active God.26 Thus, the constitutive experience underlying the word "God" is that of limitation; the constitutive God - and thus talk about "God"- has appeared and continues to be sustained in human discourse. Faith, we can now see, is that stance in which the "experience" of the ultimate Limit is apprehended as the medium of the encounter with God (see below, section VI); unfaith is that attitude which, unable to "leap beyond" the ultimate Limit, finds itself always attending instead to the mere Limit as such. - It might be argued that it is no accident that such impersonal philosophical notions as "infinite" or "unconditional" reality, "being itself," the bare notion of "transcendence," etc., appear always as demythologized or depersonalized versions of the more anthropomorphic god(s) of a religious tradition, and that in their impersonal (sometimes called "superpersonal") form they are in fact denying the vital root on which their very life and meaning depend.</page><page sequence="26">130 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW image which gives the term its peculiar transcendent reference is personalistic. These fused into one in the concretely religious apprehension of our finitude provide us with the root referent for the word. This double rootage accounts for the fact that, on the one hand, the presence or action of God is sometimes said to be im- mediately "experienced" or "known," and, accordingly, doctrines of religious experience are developed. On the other hand, it is often maintained that the knowledge of God rests on "faith" or "belief," and that he cannot be experienced directly at all. If, as I am arguing, the most we could be said to experience directly here is our bare finitude as such - and even this is a very com- plex sort of "experience" which is never apprehended concretely apart from the image of one or another of the finite limiters used analogically - then the truth in both claims can be understood: the encounter with God will involve both the "experience" of our finitude and the faith-interpretation through which this limited- ness is apprehended as due to an active will over against us. Since in the actual encounter with God these two elements so interpenetrate each other as not to be separately distinguishable,27 there is little wonder that conflicting views about the relative im- portance of "experience" and "faith" appear. The faith interpre- tation, of course, is shaped by the concrete historical tradition within which one stands. If one stands within the Christian tra- dition, which knows of a loving and powerful Creator, it is hardly surprising that he will tend to see the course and destiny of his own being - i.e., its limits on all sides - as determined by the activity of God: God's mercy and benevolence toward him will be felt in that which seems good in life; his judgment and wrath, in the painful and constrictive.28 See note 25, above. 28 If we have correctly identified the experiential elements underlying the term "God," the doctrine of God must always deal in some fashion with the notion of transcendent reality (even if only to refer it to some "depth" in everything that is) and with the way in which this transcendence is known to us (i.e., with "revelation"). However, such highly problematic negative notions as "infinite" and "unconditional" - probably rooted ultimately in "mystical" experience of the "supernatural" - would perhaps not need to be given the constitutive role in a doctrine of God which they have so often played in the past (though they might well have a certain secondary and interpretative role to play); and the</page><page sequence="27">THE MEANING OF GOD 131 I conclude, therefore, that God-language is not necessarily hopelessly mythological and old-fashioned, but that, if carefully defined and restricted, it has a genuine basis in our awareness and knowledge of the Limit. This of course does not mean that the door is opened wide again for the well-structured "other world" of much traditional Christian thought. We have found it possible and legitimate to speak only of the reality which ulti- mately limits us on all sides - i.e., God - in this way. Of the existence beyond the Limit of finite beings alongside God - angels, demons, supernatural powers of all sorts, or the departed spirits of the dead--we know nothing and can know nothing. There is no warrant in the present analysis, then, for re- introducing the "mythological world-view" in any form at all.29 Since historically Christian theology grew out of and accepted rather uncritically the cosmological dualism underlying and expressed in that world-view, and in many details seems still to presuppose it, it is necessary to think through the whole of the Christian perspective afresh, sifting out All mythological elements to arrive at what of Christian faith modern, this-worldly man can affirm. Only when this winnowing has been performed will we be in a position to see whether the essentials of Christian belief in fact depend on the acceptance of a mythology meaningless and even ridiculous to moderns, or whether Christian faith can be a live issue in our secular culture. meaning of the doctrine would not in that way be placed so completely out of reach of those whose direct experience seems to them limited to the finite and contingent. ~ It should perhaps be observed that my contention that such a doctrine of God would not be mythological rests on a distinction between "mythological" and "analogical." A mythological doctrine of God begins in and presupposes what I have called the cosmological dualism of "this world" and "another world," "this side" and "the other side." For such a presupposition there seems little warrant. An analogical doctrine of God makes no such presupposition, but results when (the experience of) finitude is understood in personalistic terms. Thus, an analogical doctrine, being experientially rooted, can be carefully disciplined and controlled methodologically; with mythology the rootage is so vague and legendary that strict methodological control is almost impossible. For the position I am taking here, only if the Christian doctrine of God itself--worked out in strict accord with the foundations of theological knowledge as sketched in this paper - were to require the re-introduction of certain features of the otherwise discarded mythical world-view, would it be justifiable to reinstate them. But this is as it should be: Christian faith is first of all faith in God - and all else that must be said theologically should follow from this premise.</page><page sequence="28">132 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW I have tried in this paper to show that there is some justification for continuing to speak of a personal God even though the mytho- logical framework characteristic of earlier speech of this sort be completely given up. This of course in no way can or should be construed as a kind of proof of the existence of such a God. As we have seen, there are other ways of conceiving the ultimate Limit which may in some respects seem more credible. All that I have attempted here is to show that "God-language" has its roots in concrete (secular) experience and that its cognitive mean- ingfulness can be defended, even granting the premises of "secular man"; whether it is true or not is another question. Our analysis has brought us into a position from which we can see what would be required if the truth of this claim were to be affirmed, however. Only on the ground that God had in fact revealed himself could it be claimed he exists; only if there were and is some sort of move- ment from beyond the Limit to us, making known to us through the medium of the Limit the reality of that which lies beyond, could we be in a position to speak of such reality at all; only if God actually "spoke" to man could we know there is a God. It is of course the Christian claim that God has acted to reveal himself and continues to do so. Whether that claim is true or not - and the grounds on which one might decide its truth - cannot be taken up in this paper; a full systematic theology would be required to deal with it. This paper should have made clear, however, that genuine knowledge of God could not be affirmed on any other basis than such revelation, and that the Christian claim is, therefore, directly relevant to the general philosophical question of God's existence.</page></plain_text>
