<plain_text><page sequence="1">AVROM FLEISHMAN* Being and Nothing in "A Passage to India" Warum ist iiberhaupt Seiendes und nicht vielmehr Nichts? —Das Nichts als das Andere zum Seienden ist der Schleier des Seins. —Heidegger " Except for the Marabar Caves—and they are twenty miles off—the city of Chandrapore presents nothing extraordinary." 1 We are pre sented from the outset with the structure of a reality divided in two, the ordinary and the extra-ordinary. Chandrapore is typical of what is ordinary: it is the city, the place of human habitation, and has no things that can be called " extraordinary." But outside the ordinary there is the ex£ra-or dinar y; it is there in addition to the ordinary. The realm of human life is not only a presence of the ordinary but also an absence of the extraordinary. In this state of absence the ordinary realm " presents nothing." But it does so in an extraordinary way: " nothing " becomes a presence when presented. Primary reality, then, is both what is there and what is not there; it is something (something ordinary) and it is nothing ("nothing extraordinary"). As an excep tion to the ordinary, the city also presents the Caves, which are extra ordinary but which contain nothing. There is the same co-presence of nothing and something as in the city, and this allows it to be said that the city presents the Caves, even though they are twenty miles off. Yet the Caves are an exception, different from the ordinary things that Chandrapore presents. "Edged rather than washed by the river Ganges, it trails for a couple of miles along the bank, scarcely distinguishable from the rubbish it deposits so freely." The circumference of this ordinary * Professor of English at Johns Hopkins, Avrom Fleishman has written on Jane Austen, Conrad, and the English historical novel. 1 All quotations, hereafter parenthetically cited by page number alone, are from the Harcourt, Brace paperback edition of the novel, whose pagination is apparently the same as that of several other widely available editions. Since the quotations in the first part of this paper run consecutively through the first chapter, I have omitted citations to them altogether. 109</page><page sequence="2">110 Avrom Fleishman realm is the river, which topographically edges rather than hygienically washes the town. This river is both of and outside the city, both its boundary and an independent force along whose bank it trails. The city is " scarcely distinguishable from the rubbish the rubbish comes from the city, mingles with the river, and then is deposited on the bank to form the base of the city itself. The rubbish is silt, excrement and garbage presumably; both earth and the wastes of man. It is all one substance: mud—whether city or river, floating silt or solid land, waste or renewed earth. This is the matter of which ordinary reality is composed; there are distinctions among the phases of its cycles, and there are distinctions among various organizations of matter—indi viduals, communities, geographical entities. But the cycle of life and death in the organic body of man and in the daily life of the town breaks down and builds up the river banks in an apparently endless cycle, each organization mingling with the others, and each phase of their cycles merging with the others. Like the mixture of nothing and something in the opening sentence's description of Chandrapore, the account of the Ganges and its relation to the city includes both negative and positive movements: there is elimination and decay, but also a building up of substance.2 "There are no bathing-steps on the river front, as the Ganges happens not to be holy here; indeed there is no river front, and bazaars shut out the wide and shifting panorama of the stream." Here the realm of ordinary life is conceived as the market place of trade and other practical efforts to survive. The Ganges is not holy here: the ordinary realm is perhaps elsewhere surrounded by holiness but is here seen devoid of spirituality. Like the combination of polar elements in the initial descriptions of the city and river, the river front of the city is both a positive and negative boundary; " there is no river front," for 2 The only criticism, amid the welter of commentary, which makes an effort to describe the actual world-picture given in A Passage to India is Wilfred Stone, The Cave and the Mountain: A Study of E. M. Forster (Stanford and London: Stanford University Press 1966), p. 312 ff., where the physical substances of earth, water and air are qualitatively and mythologically discussed. Unfortunately, this book has become better known for its application of Indian religious philosophy and Jungian psychology to the novel; these are probably more relevant as intel lectual contexts than others that might have been chosen, but remain less com pelling than the world-picture presented in the language of the text. (It should be remarked at this point that the present essay assumes that existential philosophy exists, but does not depend on it for interpretation—indeed, a close comparison of Forster's world and, e. g., Heidegger's is out of the question.)</page><page sequence="3">Being and Nothing in " A Passage to India " Ill the town has no interest in defining its boundaries, yet " bazaars shut out . . . the stream," for the unplanned processes of trade create a boundary and limit man's awareness of his environment. " The streets are mean, the temples ineffective, and though a few fine houses exist they are hidden away in gardens or down alleys whose filth deters all but the invited guest. " As in the previous sentences, there is a mixture here of presence and absence: a few esthetic values exist in this ordinary realm, but are available only by invitation and with effort; they are surrounded by filth—identical to the rubbish deposited by the river— but in their hidden state they are kept safe like a jewel in dung. Filthy alleys and private gardens mingle in the ordinary realm to surround the fine houses—both beauty and ugliness, upper- and lower-class life, forming a continuous medium of ordinariness. There follows a historical excursus, giving the social and political origins of the ordinary realm: "Chandrapore was never large or beautiful, but two hundred years ago it lay on the road between Upper India, then imperial, and the sea, and the fine houses date from that period. The zest for decoration stopped in the eighteenth century, nor was it ever democratic. There is no painting and scarcely any carving in the bazaars." The balancing of affirmative and negative values in the sentence-structures indicates an extension of the double ness of the opening sentences into matters of art and politics. India has a great history and culture, but it is limited by its social system (the end of its period of decorative art is associated with its lack of democratic distribution), and the great tradition of its imperial period makes little impact on the present ("no carving in the bazaars"). The route to the sea has made Chandrapore important but it is no longer a major one and the city has declined. Even at its apogee, the historical cycle makes no very significant departure from mediocrity, for "Chandra pore was never large or beautiful." The lines of movement in the history of the ordinary realm are, then, as fluctuating as the cycles of the human and social organisms or those of the river. " The very wood seems made of mud, the inhabitants of mud mov ing. So abased, so monotonous is everything that meets the eye, that when the Ganges comes down it might be expected to wash the excrescence back into the soil. Houses do fall, people are drowned and left rotting, but the general outline of the town persists, swelling here, shrinking there, like some low but indestructible form of life. " All our observations of the ordinary realm are brought together here: its undifferentiated structure, in which men, wood and earth are con</page><page sequence="4">112 Avrom Fleishman fused; its elementary composition ("mud") at a low stage of organi zation ("abased," "monotonous"); its cyclical rhythm, exemplified by the recurrent floods and the rise and fall of men and their habita tions; its primitive ("low") yet immortal ("indestructible") vitality. Chandrapore is here made typical of the realm of ordinary life; its nature is to be meaningless in its internal lack of structure, yet filled with meaning when taken in relation to other realms. The ordinary is the material basis of human existence that underlies all the exotic features of Indian and colonial English civilization, as they are represented in the novel's characters and their actions; it is the primary level of being, which most novelists leave out of account. For Forster's novel becomes an image of being as a whole, described in a systematic structure of three levels. Most discussions of A Passage to India have taken up the tripartite structure of Parts I, II, and III, which are named "Mosque," "Caves," and "Temple." The more explicit structure proposed in this opening chapter is made up of a base of ordinary reality, a thin layer or veneer of conscious life growing out of it, and finally a realm of mystery and unfathomable space, which lies above but may also be found localized within the other realms. The middle realm is found in the upper levels of Chandrapore itself. "Inland, the prospect alters. . . . Beyond the railway—which runs parallel to the river—the land sinks, then rises again rather steeply. On the second rise is laid out the little civil station, and viewed hence, Chandrapore appears to be a totally different place. It is a city of gardens. It is no city, but a forest sparsely scattered with huts. It is a tropical pleasaunce washed by a noble river. The toddy palms and neem trees and mangoes and pepul that were hidden behind the bazaars now become visible and in their turn hide the bazaars." In this description of the upper city, the second realm of being, what seemed undifferentiated and unitary on the lowest level now is revealed as having a variety of parts and therefore different aspects. There are two cities, upper and lower: the upper "appears to be a totally different place," but this appearance is probably illusory, since the realm of differentiated life is only an excrescence from the ordinary realm of mud with which we began. The bazaars, which from ground level shut out the "wide and shifting panorama of the stream," now function in a double way, both hiding and being hidden: they hide the trees which make up the " tropical pleasaunce, " but are in turn hidden by those trees. The trees, in turn, are not only hidden by the bazaars but themselves hide the city, turning it into a " forest"</page><page sequence="5">Being and Nothing in " A Passage to India " 113 with only scattered habitations. What was hidden now appears, but in coming into view it serves to hide other things; what was simple and uniform at the primary level is double and complex at this second level of reality. In this realm much of the novel's action takes place; it is the realm of personal relations and psychology, of imperialism and religion, of snobbery and non-communication. The trees " rise from the gardens where ancient tanks nourish them, they burst out of stifling purlieus and unconsidered temples. Seeking light and air, and endowed with more strength than man or his works, they soar above the lower deposit to greet one another with branches and beckoning leaves, and to build a city for the birds. Especially after the rains do they screen what passes below, but at all times, even when scorched or leafless, they glorify the city to the English people who inhabit the rise, so that new-comers cannot believe it to be as meager as it is described, and have to be driven down to acquire disillusionment." The upward movement of the trees is a movement toward life, toward " light and air," and away from the confinement of the native quarters and religious institutions (purlieus and temples). The trees exhibit this urge toward life with even greater force than does man in his emergence from the river (they have " more strength than man "); their movement is an upward thrust, they " soar above the lower deposit. " They build a city in their own right, a " city for the birds"—a society of animal life which resembles man's second-level existence, and which may be approachable by such efforts as God bole's " song of an unknown bird. " (Trees like these give Mrs. Moore a final bit of knowledge as they laugh good-bye on her outward voyage.) But their surge upward is in its turn a form of illusion, for the branches " screen what passes below," and spuriously " glorify the city at least to English people who are prone to such illusions. The complementary movement of the tourist is " down " toward the native city and " disillusionment." The implication of this contrast between the trees' vital striving and the inquisitive mind's tendency to return to the substratum of being is that life exists within a vertical hierarchy of reality, exhibiting both the movement upward that differentiates " higher cultures" from the primary monotony, and the downward movement of regression and reassimilation with the sludge. The upper city, for all its luxuriant foliage, is a realm that men have organized, given over to social forms and set apart from nature: "As for the civil station itself, it provokes no emotion. It charms not, neither does it repel. It is sensibly planned, with a red-brick club on its</page><page sequence="6">114 Avrom Fleishman brow, and farther back a grocer's and a cemetery, and the bungalows are disposed along roads that interest at right angles. It has nothing hideous in it, and only the view is beautiful; it shares nothing with the city except the overarching sky." The rectilinearity of the city, its sensible planning, and its careful provisions for life and death ("a grocer's and a cemetery") indicate that this social realm is man's modus vivendi; a more or less deliberate effort to distinguish civilized life from the lower realm of undifferentiated substance. But in its attempted divorce from the meanness of Indian life, the upper city joins with the lower under a realm of being that spans them both: " it shares nothing with the city except the overarching sky."3 Despite the rational plans which admit " nothing hideous," the cities share "nothing": their common term is a nothingness whose onlv exception is the sky, which they also share. " The sky too has its changes, but they are less marked than those of the vegetation and the river. Clouds map it up at times, but it is normally a dome of blending tints, and the main tint blue. By day the blue will pale down into white where it touches the white of the land, after sunset it has a new circumference—orange, melting upwards into tenderest purple. But the core of blue persists, and so it is by night." There are indications that the realm of reality associated with the sky has similarities both to the ever-changing fluid and to the arti ficially-divided social realms; like them the sky " has its changes " and is occasionally mapped into sections by clouds. But it is "normally " a unifying dome, a spectrum that includes all colors. In its contact with the earthly realm, this spectrum expresses itself in simplest terms as white—the most comprehensive of colors, taking into itself all the colors of the visible universe—but its upward regions become more markedly differentiated from the earth. There its predominant shade of blue is transformed into tenderest purple—hinting at an approach toward black or absence of color at the violet end of the spectrum. This upward 3 A definitive statement of the moral order of the second or social realm is given in Mr. Sorley the missionary's attitude toward the comprehensiveness of the Christian redemption: "We must exclude someone from our gathering, or we shall be left with nothing." (38) Society depends on exclusions, which belie the all-embracing life of the primary realm in order to avoid the threatening vacuity of the third realm. (It is, of course, ironic that the Christian approach to life is placed at the middle range, social stratification, rather than in the heavenly sphere; but it is the implicit view of the novel that Christian and other religious myths are not genuinely of the upper realm but are adjustments to the "world," i.e., rooted in the lower realms. [207-08])</page><page sequence="7">Being and Nothing in " A Passage to India " 115 disposition toward colorlessness suggests that as the sky recedes from the earth it approaches a condition which lies at a remove from both earthly realms. At night "the stars hang like lamps from the immense vault. The distance between the vault and them is as nothing to the distance behind them, and that farther distance, though beyond colour, last freed itself from blue." The referent of the pronoun "them" is "stars": they hang in the vault or dome of blue, but are measured against a further distance beyond the extent of blue—"the distance between the vault and them. " The latter is " beyond colour " (though it is last to be freed from color)—and color is typical of the qualities of perceptible being. Thus, beyond the sky which unites both the willed efforts of civilization and the passive substratum of matter under its dome, there is a space which is unperceivable because colorless, an empty extension beyond the star-filled space of the sky. This ap parently empty space is infinite, for measured against it the finite space between the perceivable vault and the stars is " as nothing," and only by comparison with an infinite term can a finite term equal nothing. In sum, the sky is both an encompassing and unifying " dome " over life and an emptiness that stands outside human concerns—even outside the primary and middle realms of being. In either case, the sky is the same, and its doubleness must be considered a meeting-ground between being and nothing. "The sky settles everything—not only climates and seasons but when the earth shall be beautiful. By herself she can do little—only feeble outbursts of flowers. But when the sky chooses, glory can rain into the Chandrapore bazaars or a benediction pass from horizon to horizon. The sky can do this because it is so strong and so enormous." The sky has power to choose and to bless and has the qualities of strength and enormous size, but its power can work only in relation to something other than itself—the earth, which exists on a lower plane. The upper realm has effects only by a dynamic interaction with what is below; without it the earth produces little, but it expresses its glory and benediction only in contact with the earth—" from horizon to horizon." We may say, from previous conclusions, that the sky as reservoir of being and of nothing tends toward contact with earth quite as a matter of course, and that in turn the earth needs this entry of the sky's twin nature in order to have its " benediction. " " Strength comes from the sun, infused in it daily; size from the prostrate earth. No mountains infringe on the curve. League after</page><page sequence="8">116 Avrom Fleishman league the earth lies flat, heaves a little, is flat again. Only in the south, where a group of fists and fingers are thrust up through the soil, is the endless expanse interrupted. These fists and fingers are the Marabar Hills, containing the extraordinary caves." This mythic account of sun and earth includes the only terms directly drawn from Indian religion; the strength from the sun, " infused " into a prostrate earth which "lies flat," comes as a male seed fertilizing a female, as a sun god coupling with an earth goddess in a cosmic pantheon.4 The ascrip tion of such mythic associations to an otherwise impersonal and strati fied structure of being is, like Indian mythology itself, a concession to human notions. In the same manner the excrescences of the earth itself are personified as fists and fingers which " thrust up through the soil" —presumably with an upward aspiration toward the realm of sky. Yet this pathetic fallacy or anthropomorphic projection marks the distinc tion of a certain part of the earth from the ordinary realm of material existence: there is a difference between the rock of the hills and the sludge deposited by the river. The rock itself, seen as fists and fingers, is that part of earth which surges toward the sky and in its heaving upward from the flat plain creates a place of vacancy. The hollowness within the rock constitutes the " extraordinary caves," and it is the presence of this vacancy that distinguishes the extra-ordinary from the ordinary. What these openings in the earth have in them is the same as that which lies in the third realm; to go there is to go beyond the 4 Despite the critical tact which requires freedom from any fixed set of intel lectual or symbolic references in interpreting this novel, it is undeniable that the monistic implications of the identity of being and nothing, the triadic struc ture of the world-picture, and the fluidity associated with the concept of matter are to be found in Indian religious thought; e.g.: "The secret of Maya is this identity of opposites. Creation and destruction, evolution and dissolution, the dream-idyll of the inward vision of the god and the desolate nought, the terror of the void, the dread infinite " (Heinrich Zimmer, Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization, New York: Harper and Row, 1962 [1946], p. 46); "Accord ing to an ancient Vedic conception, the universe comprises three worlds (triloba), (1) the earth, (2) the middle space or atmosphere, and (3) the firmament or sky. These are called 'The Three Towns (tripura) ' (op. cit., p. 185); "Bound less and imperishable, the cosmic waters are at once the immaculate source of all things and the dreadful grave. Through a power of self-transformation, the energy of the abyss puts forth, or assumes, individualized forms endowed with temporary life and limited self-consciousness. For a time it nourishes and sustains these with a vivifying sap. Then it dissolves them again, without mercy or distinction, back into the anonymous energy out of which they arose " (op. cit., pp. 34-35). But these conceptions are to be found elsewhere in religious and metaphysical thought, and do not exhaust the embodying language of the novel.</page><page sequence="9">Being and Nothing in " A Passage to India " 117 stars. This, too, is a meeting-ground of being and non-being, and to make a passage into the caves is to come in contact with nothing and recognize its identity with everything, in the note of " Bourn." That passage is enacted in the plot of A Passage to India. # # * Given the tripartite structure of reality in Chapter I, the novel's account of complex emotional and moral experience becomes more firmly interpretable. In the key chapter (XII) which introduces the climactic action, the caves are described in historical-geological terms carried over from the concluding paragraph of the first chapter: the high places of Dravidia are not only old but have remained unchanged since the earth was formed; their outlines show the forms of the sun " before our globe was torn from his bosom. " Moreover, their creation is described in personified or mythic terms (" flesh of the sun's flesh, " etc., [ 123]). "Yet even they are altering. As Himalayan India rose, this India, the primal, has been depressed, and is slowly re-entering the curve of the earth." The land that retained its sky-origin in its forms is sinking into the undifferentiated continuum of primal matter. Within this mass, within its upward thrust of " fists and fingers," there are the caves, which partake both of air and earth, the third realm and the first. "They are like nothing else in the world": (124) there is no other thing like them and thus their very existence is negative—they are the negation of the ordinary realm, the extra-ordinary. In the caves being exists in intimate relations with—is even defined by —non-being. As in the negative definitions of gods in Western and Oriental theology, which point toward their existence by denying them all finite and limiting qualities, the caves are described by their lack of attributes: "nothing attaches to them." (124) In Godbole's earlier account of them, only negatives are used: the caves are not large, not holy, not ornamented, contain no sculpture, etc. (When the conclusion is drawn that the caves' reputation is an " empty brag," Godbole can "'not quite say that'." [75]) Yet this very lack of at tributes marks the presence of a quality: the caves open up an extra ordinary situation for the visitor because of the absence he finds there. According to the qualities he brings, his contact with nothing creates a turning-point in his life. For here his being comes into relation with its negation. The caves can contain everything—every kind of visitor, sound, moral event, etc.—but reduce it to the uniform state expressed in the all-absorbing "boum," which is the annihilating sound of</page><page sequence="10">118 Avrom Fleishman nothing. But they are also variously as well as uniformly negative: they create illusions corresponding to the points-of-view from which they are seen. "There is little to see" (124)—in fact, there is nothing, but the qualification " little " suggests that the mirror-like walls are there as the ground of the seen. All the elements of perception—the match or other light, the objects or faces to be seen, and the eye which sees all are provided by the visitor. This realm of uncompromising objec tivity itself contains no subjectivity—"no eye to see it" (125) is built into the structure. But it does open itself to the subjective visitor, at least to the extent of becoming the field for his self-projection. Some visitors, like the one Forster describes, light a match and project a fantasy of mating between a real and a reflected flame ("A mirror . . . divides the lovers," [125]). Others come fresh from a groping and disturbed mating process and have a sexual hallucination; still others come with ideals of religious love and emerge disgusted with " love in a church, love in a cave. ..." There is, however, a place which is impervious and unapproachable to subjectivity: the chambers without entrances. " But elsewhere, deeper in the granite, are there certain chambers that have no en trances? . . . Nothing is inside them, they were sealed up before the creation of pestilence or treasure; if mankind grew curious and excavated, nothing, nothing would be added to the sum of good or evil." (125) These chambers have "Nothing . . . inside them," in con trast to the potentially all-containing caves; they do not invite a trans action between being and non-being, but maintain their splendid isolation. They are inaccessible to " pestilence or treasure" or any other human value or disvalue, but if their contents were uncovered, " nothing would be added " to good and evil. This description suggests a pure state of nothingness which is never directly encountered but stands as a speculative limit. The final image of this nothingness in its eternal equanimity is the interior of the bubble-shaped cave of the Kawa Dol, which "mirrors its own darkness in every direction in finitely." (125) It is equally distributed in all directions and thus attains infinity although confined within a finite shape. Although no light is available to mirror what is not there, the darkness mirrors itself. Ordinarily this realm of what is beyond the stars is unseen and dis regarded, but at certain extraordinary points it touches the ordinary realms of being and is made accessible to a visit. This provides the</page><page sequence="11">Being and Nothing in " A Passage to India " 119 occasion for a journey not only to nothing but to being, a journey which constitutes the plot of A Passage to India. The dramatic crisis derives from the encounter of two fairly naive tourists with the " mystery "—the place where the ordinary realm touches the extra ordinary and is likely to be confused or " muddled" with it. Their passage is indeed a passage to more than India; it takes in the whole of reality. The novel revamps the archetypal pattern of spiritual quest and heroic trial in a comic mode—the errors of naive tourists—but the form of the fable is as universal as the classic myths. The effects of encountering the mystery and finding it a muddle are well known: the encounter with nothing produces a destructive chain of events for Adela and a moral exhaustion in Mrs. Moore. Not so well known are the preconditions for the confusion. One of Adela's forma tive experiences is the bump in the dark that jostles her into contact with Ronnie and precipitates their engagement; whatever it was that attacked the car—whether a hyena, a ghost, or Adela herself (as it appears from the tracks after she inspects them)—it is concluded that the accident was "Nothing," or at least "nothing criminal." (97) Chapter XIV begins by insistently reminding the reader that "Most of life is so dull that there is nothing to be said about it," and that "There are periods in the most thrilling day during which nothing happens." (132-133) Adela and Mrs. Moore have been prepared to encounter this vacuity by means of Godbole's song, and have " felt nothing acutely" for a fortnight. (133) Further the narrator's remark that " nothing occurred " at sunrise during the train ride to the caves (137) expresses the blankness of the world and suggests the appropriate response to it. Yet Adela fails to acknowledge this neutrality of being: Aziz assures her before their entry into the caves that "' Nothing embraces the whole of India, nothing, nothingbut Adela insists that "' There will have to be something universal in this country'." (145) This failure to perceive the presence of nothing in everything leads to her confusion in the encounter with the emptiness of the caves. Mrs. Moore interprets them to say: "'Pathos, piety, courage—they exist, but are identical, and so is filth. Everything exists, nothing has value.'" (149) This generalization about homogeneity on the primary and secondary levels of life is itself muddled—as much so as Fielding's interpretation of God bole's metaphysics (see below)—but it has the virtue of intimately relating being and nothing, which Adela's naive idealism refuses to do. Instead of universals, the Indian world presents many things, mixed</page><page sequence="12">120 Avrom Fleishman together with nothing, but she wants to integrate them with moral and personal meanings, and muddles them and herself. In place of this muddled view there is a perceptual mode that helps man in his daily affairs to adjust his behavior to the conditions of a world composed of both being and nothing. This mode of perception is the " double vision " to which the narrator elsewhere alludes: it is a simultaneous awareness of being and nothing, an awareness that may lead not perhaps to metaphysical truth but to the truth about one's own experience. With this vision Adela is enabled to tell what happened to her in the cave which may not seem much but is the climactic moment of the action. When the tourists first enter the caves the action is rendered from a point of view far removed from and above the scene, as would a movie camera filming the incident from a distant vantage point: "Bending their heads, they disappeared one by one into the interior of the hills. The small black hole gaped where their varied forms and colours had momentarily functioned. They were sucked in like water down a drain. Bland and bald rose the precipices ..." (146) After Adela has upset Aziz by asking about his presumed polygamy, they enter another cave (or caves) and are described each from his own point of view: "he plunged into one of them to recover his balance. She followed at her leisure, quite unconscious that she had said the wrong thing, and not seeing him, she also went into a cave. . . . " (153) At the trial Adela is asked: 4 You went alone into one of those caves? ' 'That is quite correct. 'And the prisoner followed you.' Her vision was of several caves. She saw herself in one, and she was also outside it, watching its entrance, for Aziz to pass in. She failed to locate him. ... "I am not quite sure." (228-229) It is, of course, difficult for Adela to describe Aziz following her into the cave because he has entered first and she has followed him into that cave or another like it. What she does in the passage just quoted is to adopt the external point of view of the long-distance movie-like observer, seeing herself not only in the cave but going into it—as though she were observing herself. From this remote perspective she would have been able to see Aziz entering the cave, if he had</page><page sequence="13">Being and Nothing in " A Passage to India " 121 indeed entered it after her, but as he has not she cannot see him and therefore accepts the fact that he has not followed her. What does Adela see, then? Nothing. That is the reality of her situation: nothing happened in the cave. Acknowledging nothing is a metaphysical discovery: " Something that she did not understand took hold of the girl and pulled her through. Though the vision was over and she had returned to the insipidity of the world, she remembered what she had learnt. Atonement and confession—they could wait. It was in hard prosaic tones that she said, ' I withdraw everything.'" (230) What she has learnt is the distinction between nothing and something, although it is " something that she did not understand." In withdrawing " everything," Adela is acknowledging nothing—what is left when everything is removed. And in seeing that nothing hap pened in the cave she learns to distinguish that nothing from all her desired ideals—freeing her mind (at least temporarily) from the muddle of being and nothing acquired in the experience. As Mrs. Moore concludes, "Nothing had happened" (208), but this non-event is an event of considerable significance, an active force in people's lives and relationships, and also a revelatory power for the mind. Godbole's explanation of the affair to Fielding is a more expressive identification of the events in the cave as nothing, while acknowledg ing that in the conventional sense " nothing happened. " Godbole main tains that "nothing can be performed in isolation (177) he means, of course, that everyone is involved in any action, in an endless sequence of causes—that an action expresses the whole universe. But his words also imply that Adela, who has lived in the isolation of her subjectivity, performed " nothing, " i.e., made the nothing into an active force in life. Fielding protests that in this view "' everything is anything and noth ing something'," but Godbole manages both to agree and disagree with this muddle: '"Good and evil are different, as their names imply. But, in my own humble opinion, they are both of them aspects of my Lord. He is present in the one, absent in the other, and the difference between presence and absence is great, as great as my feeble mind can grasp. Yet absence implies presence, absence is not non-existence, and we are therefore entitled to repeat," come, come, come, come (178) Not only does this amusing and characteristic discourse play on the contradictions of Indian habits of mind, but it also makes a valid metaphysical distinction between absence (or nonfunctioning and non-existence (or nothing). The absence and the presence in the cave— the presence of a disturbing force in Adela's imagination and the</page><page sequence="14">122 Avrom Fleishman absence of a literal attacker—both are present and condition the out come, just as Krishna's presence and absence in both good and evil constitute reality. It is Forster's genius to have interpreted a "mystery story " about an unknown attacker as a confrontation with the mystery of the double nature of reality. With this structure of being in mind, we can interpret some of the vexed questions surrounding Mrs. Moore. She is the brave tourist who anounces, "'I like mysteries but I rather dislike muddles,'" (69) and her interpreters—taking the intention for the deed—generally as sume that she manages to follow her taste. But her distress after the visit to the caves suggests that she does not: " Nothing evil had been in the cave, but she had not enjoyed herself. ..." (148) When she takes the vision of " nothing evil" with her, her ideals of love and her maternal warmth matter less and less. "She had come to that state where the horror of the universe and its smallness are both visible at the same time—the twilight of the double vision in which so many elderly people are involved. " (207) These famous lines do not say that Mrs. Moore's double vision is accurate but rather that she is in a late stage of a perhaps once-accurate double vision. This condition re sembles twilight in two senses: it is obscure and it comes at the end of a temporal span—in this case not the twilight of a day but of life. She sees both the universe's smallness (being, at least on the primary and secondary levels) and its horror (nothing), but muddles the two. To see the mystery is to regard without horror the universe's greatness (being) and its nothingness; the mystery is the negation of the muddle of horror and smallness. The categories of muddledom are general enough, but what exactly are the mental images of it which Mrs. Moore confuses? " If this world is not to our taste, well, at all events there is Heaven, Hell, Annihilation —one or other of those large things, that huge scenic background of stars, fires, blue or black air. All heroic endeavour, and all that is known as art, assumes that there is such a background, just as all practical endeavour, when the world is to our taste, assumes that the world is all. But in the twilight of the double vision, a spiritual mud dledom is set up for which no high-sounding words can be found; we can neither act nor refrain from action, we can neither ignore nor respect Infinity." (207-08) "The huge scenic background "—con ceived of as the realm of Heaven, Hell, Annihilation—this represents the area of speculation in which Mrs. Moore's Christian conception of things moves. But that same place of " stars, fires, blue or black air "</page><page sequence="15">Being and Nothing in " A Passage to India " 123 can be seen not mythologized as part of a religious world-view but nakedly as the third realm of being—which shades off toward the extreme condition of nothing as the blue of the heavens passes into the black or absence of color beyond the stars. Some forms of behavior (art, heroism) focus on the "background," the third realm; others (practical endeavor) on the first and second realms, the " world." When the " background" is mythologized and muddled with the "world" of active being, the vision of both becomes confused: both action and non-action in the " world " are compromised, and both con sciousness and unconsciousness—respect and ignorance—of " Infinity " (the third realm) are no longer possible. Mrs. Moore, encountering nothing in the caves, takes it as demythologizing her " background," and even as making nothing of her " world." Thus she is unfitted for moral action regarding Adela, and for contemplation regarding herself. Mrs. Moore does not end in this twilight state; she attains a degree of clarity respecting being and nothing, " world " and " background," in the course of leaving India. On the train and boat journey away from the scene of her confusion, elements of the landscape provide the occasions for an exercise of double vision of the same sort as Adela's at the trial. India contains not only nothing but something—a multi plicity of things. The disused antiquities of the primary level and the curtaining and curtained trees of the second level come forward to speak to her (in all irony, of course—Forster is not likely to fall into the pathetic fallacy unselfconsciously). First Mrs. Moore passes the fortress Asirgarh: " No one had ever mentioned Asirgarh to her, but it had huge and noble bastions and to the right of them was a mosque. She forgot it. Ten minutes later, Asirgarh reappeared. The mosque was to the left of the bastions now. The train in its descent through the Vindyas had described a semicircle round Asirgarh. What could she connect it with except its own name? Nothing; she knew no one who lived there. But it had looked at her twice and seemed to say: ' I do not vanish.'" (209) This (non-twilight) double vision involves a twin perspective on the primary level, the surface of the earth: it implies a relativistic freedom from conventional reference-systems, such as right and left, which are found to be relative to the geography of the Vindyas and the course of the train. The double vision also involves a simul taneous awareness of being and nothing: " What could she connect it with except its own name? Nothing . . . ," yet it declares, "' I do not vanish.'" Its being is connected with non-being, yet the two are dis</page><page sequence="16">124 Avrom Fleishman tinguished in Mrs. Moore's intense perception of its enduring identity as an individual object.5 A similar experience occurs when Mrs. Moore takes ship; the coconut palms speak: "' So you thought an echo was India; you took the Marabar caves as final?' they laughed. ' What have we in common with them, or they with Asirgarh? Good-bye!' Then the steamer rounded Colaba, the continent swung about, the cliff of the Ghats melted into the haze of a topic sea." (210) Here topographical double vision again occurs at a moment of recognition: as Mrs. Moore learns the separateness of objects, she also observes the turning-around of a continent, from her (and the ship's) point of view. The trees tell her that India requires a recognition not only of nothing (caves, echo) but of the discrete elements of being (trees, Asirgarh, etc.). Mrs. Moore sails out of India—and out of life—with her muddle challenged, but not with sufficient resolution to allow her to act in the world again. Aziz is probably right to conclude: "What did this eternal good ness of Mrs. Moore amount to? To nothing, if brought to the test of thought." (312) Eternal goodness is one of the notions that are demythologized by this novel yet while they " amount to " nothing, that nothing is a matter worth attention. Mrs. Moore's charismatic power would seem to derive from her intimacy with nothing; indeed, she raises nothing to an active role in human affairs. As Adela says, "'. . . you do nothing but good, you are so good '(205) it is possible to conclude that she does nothing in the action of the plot, but she does it well. Doing nothing, like knowing nothing, is itself an act of con siderable import, and has consequences in the moral sphere. By refraining from intervention, Mrs. Moore creates a nothingness around Adela which allows her to come out of her muddle. Adela later has an experience somewhat like Mrs. Moore's two moments of double geographical vision, when an American missionary plays on the words "turn" and "return" in a meaningless way, which nevertheless sets Adela in motion to pick up her relations with Mrs. Moore's children. 3 Asirgarh is also mentioned by Aziz at Mau as being " forty miles away," but inaccessible for getting a doctor because "the Ringnod Dam [is] broken." (310) What are we to make of that? The method of description chosen in this paper attempts to avoid external interpretive systems by staying close to the language of the text, but there are enough linguistic links falling outside the novel's chosen structure to suggest that description alone will not exhaust the novel. Frank Kermode has called these extra links " plotlets," and it was a desire to integrate more of these with the " plot" of the novel that led to the present essay. But the essay is also in " passage."</page><page sequence="17">Being and Nothing in "A Passage to India" 125 (265-266) Out of Mrs. Moore's and Adela's contacts with nothing come the turnings that allow for informed and (at least for the latter) ongoing personal relations. The dominant impression of the novel's closing movement is a sense of the unity of all things on the primal level of being, the matter or sludge that is carried in water as an undifferentiated continuum. Just as the Ganges flowing by Chandrapore reduces land, man and excrement to a uniform color and density, so the ritual enactment of the Gokul Ashtami festival recreates the process by emptying all the contents of the community at Mau into the tank. The act is prepared for conventionally in the form of a clay model of the town of Krishna's birth, and is completed when the participants in the festival join the town in falling into the water: " Thus was He thrown year after year, and were others thrown—little images of Ganpati, baskets of ten-day corn, tiny tazias after Mohurram—scapegoats, husks, emblems of pas sage; a passage not easy, not now, not here, not to be apprehended except when it is unattainable; the God to be thrown was an emblem of that. " (314-315) The negativity of the repeated entries of "noth ing" into the language and action of the novel persists in this final image of unity. It is the same " not now, not here " which closes the novel, deferring India's independence, the meeting of East and West, and human fulfillment to some other time and place. But the " emblems of passage "—in religion and in literature—emphasize instead of negation a continual recurrence, surge, or movement of man between the poles of being and nothing, between the primary and tertiary levels of existence, and between birth and death. This pattern of rise and fall, turn and return, double vision and double movement, is the " passage " which the " emblem " symbolizes, and is the subject of A Passage to India.</page></plain_text>
