The catalogue of an exhibition of mainly sixteenth-century Italian prints, The Simple Art : Printed Images in an Age of Magnificence , by Patricia Emison (Durham, NH, University of New Hampshire, 16 September-i8 October 2006; Keene, NH, Thorne- Sagendorph Art Gallery, Keene State College, 9 November-io December 2006; Durham, NH, University of New Hampshire, 2006, 100 pp., 74 b. &amp; w. ills., $25), is arranged thematically in categories, beginning with religious subjects and then going on to mythology and history, allego- ry, portraiture, ornament and genre. The intriguing and original selection, drawn from New England university col- lections, includes engravings, etchings, woodcuts and chiaroscuro woodcuts. A fascination with Italian Renaissance prints and a desire to communicate how extraordinary they are underlies Emison's introduction. She argues forcefully for recognition of the variety and adventurousness of the subject-matter. There is the immense range of types, with prints enabling the erotic and the humorous to be treated as well as the devotional, historical, ornamental, topographical, etc. Strange subjects that have never been satisfactorily explained sometimes appear in prints, such as Agostino Veneziano 's night journey of a witch [Lo Stregozzo ; B.XIV426; here cat. no. 18) or his lamentation over a skele- ton {Allegory of Death and Fame; B.XIV320.424; cat. no. 38). The visual imagination deployed in such designs could, she suggests, have been stimulated by the example of Dürer. The figure of the witch mounted on the monstrous skeletal machine in Lo Stregozzo is well-known as having been derived from Dürer 's witch astride a flying goat (B.67). But her argu- ment is not specific borrowings, rather it is that these com- plex engravings, meticulously executed on an imposing scale, have subjects which, although not easily explicable in literary terms, are powerfully emotive through engagement with the dark and the monstrous. In that sense they are com- parable to Dürer's Knight , Death and Devil or to Mantegna's Battle of the Sea Gods. Prints generated their own tradition. Printmakers and designers also explored new approaches within existing types. There are unusual interpretations of what might seem to be quite orthodox subjects. An example is Cherubino Alberti's Pietà (B.XVII, 58.23; cat. no. 1), in which Michelangelo's sculptural group of the Pietà , now in Florence Cathedral, is presented as a sculpture on its base, but set into an elaborate naturalistic landscape with the tomb to one side and the three crosses in the distance. Or an allegorical mode of presenting biblical narrative could be adopted, like the expulsion from Paradise and the subse- quent lives of Adam and Eve (B.XV8.3; cat. no. 41). Complex allegory could itself be explored on a grand scale, as in Ghisi's famously mysterious Dream of Raphael (B.XV412.67; cat. no. 46). There are also examples of unu- sual treatments of compositions of pagan mythology and history. For example, the relief-like mode employed in com- positions of the stories of Hercules, designed by Rosso and engraved by Caraglio (B.XV85.45; cat. no. 28), or even more remarkable, the huge naval battle of Giovanni Battista Scultori (B.XY383.20; cat. no. 37). The focus might be visu- al invention itself, as when Domenico del Barbiere extracts a section from Michelangelo's Last Judgement (cat. no. 7); or when Marcantonio presents violent despair in the single fig- ure of a woman tearing her hair (B.XIV329.437; cat. no. 35). In Emison's view, it is what she calls 'modal innovation' (rather than stylistic innovation) for which sixteenth- century Italian prints should primarily be valued. She overstresses, I think, the freedom of print designers and printmakers: they will always have been keenly aware of commercial pressures. Drawing allowed artists of the time greater freedom to explore every kind of visual invention. We are especially reminded of this by two prints shown here that were originally conceived as 'presentation' drawings: the Bacchanal of Children and the Archers after Michelangelo (B. XV 305.40 and Passavant VI. 120. 116, cat. nos. 24 and 45). But she is right to say that the print media were special. They had the power to disseminate new subject-matter and approaches, thus taking them beyond the limited, private sphere of drawings to create and explore a shared visual imagination of European scope. I conclude by making a suggestion about the cartouche published in Paris, 1610, by Pierre Firens (cat. no. 58): the source is Agostino Carracci's engraved coat of arms of Cardinal Cinzio Aldobrandini (B.160; DeGrazia 202). MICHAEL BURY LAMBERT LOMBARD. For a revision ofjames Snyder's primer, Northern Renaissance Art , I wanted to include more imagery by the pioneer artists of the Low Countries who imported the Classical tradition during the first half of the sixteenth century. Within that roster, the pioneer of pioneers was Lambert Lombard (c. 1505/06-1566), a relatively obscure but highly intellectual artist from Liège who was sent to Rome by his patron, Prince Bishop Erard de la Marek, and established an academy after his patron's death in 1538. Equally noted as a poet, a numismatist and an anti- quarian, Lombard was celebrated more in a Latin biogra- phy by Dominicus Lampsonius (published in the 1949 Revue belge d'archéologie et d'histoire de l'art) than in the canonical Schilderboeck in Dutch by Karel van Mander (1604), so his fame was quickly overshadowed by artists from the major sixteenth-century centres of Antwerp and Haarlem. Despite his rôle as a transmitter and academic instructor of ancient and Italian visual culture, including some identified ancient PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="2">150 NOTES reliefs, Lombard's painted œuvre is both small and contested. Even the portrait traditionally credited as his likeness has been variously attributed either to Frans Floris or - in the volume reviewed below - Antonis Mor, in addition to being seen sometimes as a self-portrait. Lombard was celebrated more for his teaching of leading Romanist artists than for his own paintings. Thus, in seeking for the Snyder survey an exemplary and incontestible image by his hand, I chose to use not a painting, but rather an engraving after Lombard's design, published around mid-century by the print publish- ing house of Hieronymus Cock in Antwerp. Of course, rea- ders of this Journal will hold the same fascination with Lombard designs for prints. Lambert Lombard has not received much scholarly atten- tion to date, except for the dedicated study by Puraye (1950), although he also figures in Melion's study of the Schilderboeck (1991) as a source for biographies of artists both by Vasari and Lampsonius. An anniversary exhibition in his native Liège, 'Lambert Lombard et son temps' (1966), provides a basic foundation. In 1973 Ellen and Wolfgang Kemp pub- lished a basic article on Lombard's use of the antique, fol- lowed two years later by Krönig on sources. Even though Nicole Dacos furnished the wider context of his Roman antiquarianism in her catalogue, Fiamminghi a Roma 1508/1608 (Brussels and Rome, 1995, pp. 247-49, showing a pair of Lombard drawings from the Arenberg Album), she also reattributed his dismembered core altarpiece, the St Denis retable, to Lambert Suavius. The principal study of Lombard remains Denhaene's own earlier large-scale, lav- ishly produced monograph: a 500th birthday anniversary exhibition (Liège, Musée de l'Art Wallon, 1990) with com- prehensive catalogue discussion and essays by multiple authors on the full attributed œuvre , and a study that restores the St Denis retable to Lombard's authorship. Besides Denhaene, who still provided the lion's share of essays, 24 scholars contributed to a new volume, Lambert Lombard, peintre de la Renaissance Liège 1505/06-1566 (Brussels, Institut Royal du Patrimoine Artistique, 2006, 534 pp., 345 col. and 135 b. &amp; w. ills., €33), which is no. 3 in a series, Scientia Artis , from the Institut Royal du Patrimoine Artistique. Nearly half of the essays consist of laboratory inspection of the painted panels, one of the Institut's great specializations. In particular, the restoration of the cycle of Virtuous Women, large canvases from the Cistercian abbey at Herkenrode, provided an opportunity to study an inscrip- tion on the reverse, the canvas supports, oil paint technique and varnish, underdrawings, material history and treatment. Another section is devoted to the retable of St Denis of Liège. These studies need not concern us in this review of prints and drawings, nor the wider achievement of Lombard in the history of Netherlandish art. After providing initial historiographical and biographical overviews of Lombard, Denhaene discusses the drawings, the artist's principal legacy, chiefly the 120 folios of the Arenberg Album, but also the Clérembault Album (69 folios; 38 housed in the Fondation Roi Baudouin since 2000). Indeed, their restoration for the exhibition and the publica- tion of these major sheets of Lombard drawings provides one of the lasting contributions of this important catalogue. As the Lampsonius biography attests, Lombard's admiration for antiquity led him to favour Mantegna and the marble sculptors of the Renaissance, especially Bandinelli, for their fidelity to ancient models. Denhaene emphasizes Lombard's drawings as faithful records of their models from antiquity, but he also notes that no distinction is made between ancient and Renaissance sources in the drawings. Certainly, com- pared to subsequent Northern artists visiting Rome, Lombard's memoranda show less personal intervention in their transcriptions. His careful recording back home of Northern vestiges of antiquity in the form of gems, coins, and bronzes influenced the numismatic achievements of his pupil, Hubert Goltzius. In his own work the principal sub- jects for sketches comprised studies of nudes (300 of them, including some 30 cherubs) or academic studies of drapery. For nudes, Lombard tends to emphasize varieties of poses and movement, with little attention to surrounding space. His interest in proportion led him to favour costume studies related to the model of Raphael. Thematically, Lombard displayed his learning through a number of subjects taken from ancient sources, such as Cleobis and Biton from Herodotus (cat. no. 61) and The Calumny of Apelles from Lucian (cat. no. 62). Another drawing (Arenberg Album, no. 202) uses Appian to reconstruct a triumvirate scene with Marc Antony, Octavian and Lepidus (43 BC). Lombard also composed a number of drawings, some of them engraved in turn, which focussed on mythological figures: Apollo , Sacrifice to Priapus (Cock print, 1553), and Canopus (cat. nos. 57-59, 63). And he generated or copied hieroglyphs (cat. nos. 64-65) and emblems (after Alciati; cat. no. 66). Important for this audience is Lombard's use of Italian graphics as a source for his own ink drawings, some 50 of them, both in linear formulation and subjects. A good exam- ple is his replication of figures (but not landscape), carefully captioned but rendered as more Classical than its Northern source, after Monogrammist AP, Triumphs of Flora and Ceres (1537; Arenberg Album, no. 262, figs. 43-44). His print sources are dominated by contemporary Italians: Raimondi, Ghisi, Béatrizet, Bonasone, et al. Northern masters, includ- ing Dürer and Lucas van Leyden, are also identified, mak- ing the catalogue with its comparisons to the originals a valuable index of the distribution and influence of prints through Lombard. Lombard also made copies after figures by his contemporaries who shared his penchant for Italian figures and forms: Floris, his own pupil, and Heemskerck (cat. nos. 54-56), although he takes liberties with their over- all compositions. As Kemp and Hühn first discussed (1973), Lombard also used earlier artworks as models, beginning with the third-century Gallo-Roman relief from Igel (near Trier; cat. no. 68; see also his copy of an unknown medieval mural of the Life of St Nicholas , cat. no. 69). One drawing, dated 1556 and replicated as a Cock print, credited there as a lost Bosch composition, shows Christ Carrying the Cross. Most important for students of prints is Lombard's series of designs for prints issued as his own inventions. These images, chiefly biblical, offer the firmest foundations for assessing his pictorial attainments. These prints after PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="3">NOTES 151 Lombard (34 in the catalogue of Denhaene of 1990; nos. 91-104, figs. 56-60) present the fullest pictorial narratives and settings for crowded figure groups, laid out in a frieze whose dignified poses and restrained gestures evoke the model of Raphael (as much the tapestry cartoons in Brussels as the paintings in Rome). Often one or more foreground figures is seen from behind as a repoussoir. Costumes suggest the antique, as does the architecture. When there is a back- ground building, it tends to be a flat façade with little depth, although the row of figure heads usually rises only halfway up the height of the print. For some of the single-figure groups (for example Chanty ), engraved by Lambert Suavius and published by Claes Jansz. Visscher, Lombard's presen- tation utilizes parallel ground lines like Italian prints, going back to Mantegna and Marcantonio. Often the engravers for Cock have not been identified, although one of the ear- liest, the Last Supper (1551), is the work of Giorgio Ghisti. Some of the other Cock prints after Lombard are ascribed to (or inscribed as) Hans Collaert I, plus Peter van der Heyden and Cornelis Cort, as well as to Cock himself. The latest date on the sheets is 1563, but most of them were com- pleted between 1551 and 1557. A few antique or allegorical subjects, such as The Sacrifice to Priapus (1553), Heroes (both ancient and biblical) and Virtues (1557), complement the biblical subjects. For the prints, Denhaene's analysis offers a good starting point; however, it remains disappointing not to have the complete catalogue of prints after Lombard itemized here nor fully illustrated between the catalogue and the essay. Precisely because this material provides the most compre- hensive support for attributions of paintings to the artist, one might have expected fuller treatment of engravings as well as the circumstances of their production. Riggs's 1977 study of Cock still provides the basic study of the prints made after Lombard (cat. nos. 155-73) by various engravers. There is still room for serious study of Lombard as a print designer and for his contemporary, Lambert Suavius, as a printmak- er. LARRY SILVER THE ELKIND COLLECTION. A small catalogue with the title A Changing Landscape : Prints and Drawings (1570-1670) from the Arthur and Arlene Elkind Collection (Ithaca, NY, Herbert F.Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University, 2006, 52pp., 33 col. ills, S 1 7) was published on the occasion of an exhibi- tion shown in two university museums in upper New York State, the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University, Ithaca (3 February-8 April 2007), and the Louise and Bernard Palitz Gallery in Syracuse University (7 November 2006-5 January 2007). It contains a long intro- ductory essay on aspects of Northern printmaking and draw- ing by Andrew C. Weislogel, organized around the 38 works in the exhibition. These are all drawn from one private col- lection, which we are informed was started only in 1983. It is impressive to see how much effort university museums in the United States put into organizing small didactic shows of this kind for their students, and the strong private collections on which they are able to draw. Weislogel is described not sim- ply as the curator but also as 'master teacher'. ART AND ALCHEMY IN THE RENAISSANCE. It is entirely appropriate that the Villa Medici in Rome, whose noble rooms are still decorated with scenes depicting the mechanisms of nature, spheres, celestial globes and talis- manic images, should sponsor a publication that explores the links between artistic performance and scientific endea- vour in the Renaissance. L'art de la Renaissance entre science et magie (Rome and Paris, Académie de France à Rome/Somogy editions d'art, 576 pp., 296 b. &amp; w. ills, €25) is remarkable for its breadth and learning as - in some 22 essays - it offers a great sweep of scientific vision: astrology and its functioning in art, religion and politics; alchemy and its interpretation in paint; and manifestations of magic and divining. Contributions are based on the most recent scholarly discoveries about the transmission of astrological manuscripts, reassessments of the rôle of Aristode's works, the importance of mathematics and of practical techniques. These essays often reverse or modify long-held positions regarding the interpretation of science and art in the Renaissance. Kristen Lippincott, for instance, exposes the shortcomings of research, while concentrating exclusively on Classical survival, overprivileged links, connections and coherent patterns of influence (as in Panofsky and Saxl's early research). These studies demonstrate the centrality of astrology in Renaissance culture and the extraordinary quantity of astro- logical texts that have survived from earliest times. They expose their complexity, the almost capricious nature of their transmission and the ways in which image, text and commentary were corrupted by the ignorance of the scribes themselves. They explore how the beliefs expounded in works on ancient astrology, often transmitted through the intermediation of Arab and Jewish commentators, were absorbed into the Christian tradition, and how such fusions were exploited by painters who sought to bolster images of power for their princely patrons. For example, the astrolog- ical scenes by Nicolò Miretto (1420) in the Palazzo della Ragione, Padua, or those images in the Zodiac Hall of Padua's Palazzo d'Arco, probably painted by Falconetto (15 17). Not only were such astrological scenes liberally deployed on the walls of Renaissance palaces, but their com- plex images were full of meaning to contemporaries. Thus, the essays examine princes' obsession with alchemy and how distillations and metallic transmutations became linked, over time, with transformational evidence found in mythology. Although the city of Florence was, in many respects, the melting pot where Christian traditions, ancient science and pagan myths blended together to form new combinations that influenced artistic subjects (often created for the glory of the Duke, like Vasari's frescoes in the Palazzo Vecchio), and although Florence saw the earliest known fusing of new learning with new forms of art - the mascherata devised to cel- ebrate feast days, for instance - other Italian city magnates inspired similar creations. One has only to think of the iconographie complexity of the astrological cycles created for the d'Este family in the Palazzo Schifanoia, which con- tinue to exercise the interpretative ingenuity of scholars. From these studies, it is clear that a full appreciation of the PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="4">152 NOTES nature and quality of paintings at this time can only be achieved by understanding their intellectual as well as artistic context, and by penetrating the meaning of the mys- terious signs that often inhabit them. Celestial phenomena were used, for example, to develop deliberate political pro- grammes; notably, the physical presence of all the Signs of the Zodiac in the shows performed at the wedding of Camilla d'Aragona and Costanzo Sforza in Pesaro, in 1475; or the exact calculations of the movement of the heavens at the founding of Florence, accurately depicted in the Medici chapel of San Lorenzo where Cosimo 's fame is also cele- brated; or again, the vaunting of Federico II Gonzaga through the visual representation of his horoscope on the ceiling of the Sala della Zodiaco, in Castello San Giorgio. The signs of magical conjurations are also elucidated here, and most impressively, by the general editor of the vol- ume, Philippe Morel, who analyses the magical processes used by the enchantress Melissa to undo the spells cast on Astolfo and his companions and that are depicted in Dosso Dossi's painting of Melissa (1516-20), now in the Borghese Gallery in Rome. Item by item, each magical element is identified - dolls suspended in the tree, symbolic roses that have the power to remove magical spells, texts of conjuration and magic, cups for fumigation, all of them strategically placed in the structure of the painting - so that, by the end of the analysis, the reader is made to see the picture in quite a different way. Dosso Dossi's work is neither an illustration nor an exposition of a text (Ariosto 's poem): it is a painting of magic in process. The effects of astrological observation on the structure and colouring of paintings are examined through careful study of depictions of eclipses of the sun, scientifically rendered by Cigoli in his Deposition (1607) and by Rubens in his great triptych in Antwerp Cathedral (1610-11). Parmigianino's absorption in all matters alchemical, and particularly in distillation, is shown to have materially affect- ed his designs for Santa Maria della Streccata (1531-37). His great project was constantly delayed to accommodate new alchemical ideas, and the research in this book gives substance to Vasari's contention that Parmigianino was so absorbed in alchemy that he made slow progress on his frescoes. Perhaps the contribution most central to the interests of scholars of drawing is Daniel Arasse's study of Leonardo's well-known view of art as both a science and a divine activ- ity Starting from the contrast between rapid splashes of the pen and the precise articulation of muscles on the page (often found together on the same manuscript sheet), Arasse argues that Leonardo's drawings should properly be seen both as a mode of scientific clarification and as witness to the emergence of living form created first in the mind and then articulated through the artist's brush. Arasse's argument brings into relief Leonardo's revolutionary use of line to define the contours of a shape that then disappears in the final drawing or painting. This gradual elimination can be seen in process from the various states of composition for St Anne , the Virgin and Child with St John the Baptist (London, National Gallery), and it is supremely noticeable both in drawing - La Scapigliata (Parma, National Gallery) - and painting, as in St John the Baptist (Louvre). Such nuanced observation is characteristic of the essays in this volume, which reveal the extent, variety and precision of the manifestations of science (broadly defined) in the art of this period. MARGARET M. MCGOWAN ANOTHER GOLTZIUS PLAQUE. In the December 1991 issue of Print Quarterly (vin, pp. 430-31), Craig Hartley published a gold medallion engraved by Hendrik Goltzius of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, made in 1586, that he had seen in the Birmingham Museum, where it had been sitting, unnoticed by scholarship, since 1885. It was not the only plate that suffered this fate. The catalogues of Goltzius's prints include a number of silver plates he engraved that were never intended for printing. Almost all were oval in shape, on a small scale, and were intended as works of art in their own right (the lettering is never reversed). A good num- ber of these were known in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and the catalogues knew them from the paper impressions that were run off at that time - there seem to be few contemporary impressions. Since the nine- teenth century most of these plates seem to have disap- peared. This is very strange, as everyone at the time knew what they were, and they were almost invariably engraved in silver. How could such miniature masterpieces be lost? The most likely answer is that they were no longer readily recog- nizable to later generations for whom Mannerism was a term of abuse. This is a lengthy preamble to the announcement of the discovery of one of these silver plates in the Museu Quinta das Cruzes on the island of Madeira. This has a wonderful collection of works of art made in the various countries around the world with which Portugal traded in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. But when my wife and I visited it on a holiday in February 2006, we found ourselves in a room with a very mixed collection of jewellery, mostly bequeathed by César Gomez in 1946. My eye was caught by a silver plaque, set into a leather case with a hinged lid, which came from a later bequest made by João Wetzler in 1966 (inv.MQC 1786). I cannot illustrate it here, because it has proved very difficult to photograph, but the British Museum has both a later nineteenth-century impression and a much earlier one that might even be contemporary. This Holy Family is signed on the fruit with Goltzius's monogram - a detail that I could not make out through the glass of the case in Madeira, so that there must remain a slight possibility of my being taken in by an early copy. But the quality of the engraving was so high that I have little doubt that this is the lost plaque. The plate was known to Bartsch (B.III. 19.25), and through him to Goltzius's later cataloguers (Hirschmann and Hollstein 19, Strauss 163). In response to my enquiry, the Director of the museum, Teresa Pais, kindly informed me that Wetzler was a Czech émigré who arrived on Madeira in 1939. He opened an antique shop there, obtaining much of his stock through an agent from auctions in Britain. Thus, although there are no papers to throw any direct light on the matter, the most like- PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="5">NOTES 153 ly immediate provenance is a sale in London in the 1940s or Í950S. ANTONY GRIFFITHS JEAN MORIN. The history of prints has never quite known what to make of Jean Morin. For anyone writing the history in terms of the development of technique he is a dead end, for no one after him engraved in anything like his manner. For the art market, he suffers from working almost entirely after works by other artists, and is damned as a reproductive engraver lacking the 'originality' that is so prized today. Prices are low, except for the famous memento morì with a death's head where the subject dominates. And yet, he is a printmaker of genius, whose works are among the finest of all portrait prints, and many of his landscapes and religious prints are masterpieces. This has left the field open to amateurs who can appreci- ate a fine print and are left unmoved by the prejudices of modern theory. After the pioneering catalogue by Robert- Dumesnil, within his great work Le Peintre-Graveur Français , the field has been left to the collector: Charles Petitjean, whose work on the portrait prints (only) was translated and published by his nephew Murray Hornibrook in 1945, and now Jean Mazel, whose Catalogue Raisonné de l'oeuvre gravé de Jean Morin , env. 1605-1 650, was published in 2004 (Paris, Editions de la Marquise, 384 pp., fully illustrated, €80). The London print dealer Osbert Barnard should also be remem- bered, for he published in the second year of Print Quarterly (11, 1985, pp. 38-42) a revision of Petitjean based on his own collection, which he gave in the same year to the British Museum. Since I am thanked personally in the introduction to Mazel's book, the reader of these lines will understand that this is not an impartial review. Rather, I shall attempt to give an account of why this work is essential to a print library. The book, which is the product of more than twenty years' research following the author's retirement from the oil industry, contains a catalogue that gives a vastly fuller account of the states than anyone has given before, and a definitive definition of Morin's output. But this is not to say that the picture received from the earlier catalogues has changed much. Morin's work is so distinctive that there is little room for doubt as to what is by him, and his method of building up tone dot by dot required few working proofs - at least, no more than a handful survive. The chronology remains uncertain, but this is because his working life was so short - at the most the two decades before his early death in his 40s. But everything is illustrated for the first time, and all the right questions addressed and answered as far as is pos- sible. One curiosity that emerges, for example, is that Morin cannot have seen many of the portraits that he etched because the originals were not in France - a triumph for the painterly imagination with which he brought to life the patterns he had before him. The biography has been completely restudied, and a lot of mistakes and false assumptions of the past buried. Morin was not Philippe de Champaigne's son-in-law, since Champaigne's two daughters never married. Hornibrook's astonishing claim that Morin used a sequence of differently watermarked paper to distinguish the sequence of printing the impressions of an edition is briskly dismissed. We discov- er that the notice of Morin's burial on 4 June 1650 is com- pletely secure, and the reason that plates continued to be published with Morin excudit long after 1650 is that his sister and heir, Marie, carried on the publishing business into the early eighteenth century. Mazel has done really good work on the later history of the family and of the plates, and gives us a list of all the plates bearing Morin excudit as well as a his- tory of all the later printings which continued (albeit with the plates cut down to ovals) right to the end of the eighteenth century. I must not omit to mention that there is on p. 81 a table that converts measurements in pouces and lignes to milli- metres, which will be invaluable to all print historians. The existence of complete albums of the portraits (and indeed, the fact that the portrait prints are so common) sug- gests that this part of his production was often marketed as a recueil , or collection in itself. By contrast, the religious and landscape prints, which occupy the other half of his output, are far from common and were probably little reprinted. His greatest achievement, a Crucifixion nearly two metres high printed from three plates (Mazel no. 22), is known only in two impressions in Paris, and Mazel reasonably suggest that it was never intended for collectors, but rather for display in religious buildings. One of the great benefits of this cata- logue is that his entire output, including a series of illustra- tions for books, can be seen as a whole for the first time. Too much is lost for us ever to know all we would wish to know. Morin was in origin a painter, working for Philippe de Champaigne, but none of his paintings survives or is identified. No drawing can reasonably be attributed to him. Nothing is recorded of his character or beliefs, although the evidence of his production strongly suggests that he shared the Jansenist outlook of his master. Even though his father was French, Mazel produces good reason to think that his mother was Flemish, and probably belonged to the Protestant emigration. But his prints have nothing in com- mon with the first generation of Antwerp émigrés to Paris, and instead look towards van Dyck and the Iconography. The sight of these must have had an electrifying impact on him, and set him off in a direction of his own that had nothing to do with past printmaking in Paris, or with the contemporary work of Callot or Mellan. His achievement was tremendous, and one can only hope that this new presentation will con- vince more people to look at it more carefully. To do so they will need this book, of which (the publisher having gone out of business) a few copies remain for sale with the author at 8 rue A. Coutureau, 92210 St Cloud, France. ROSEMARY MILES A GERMAN DRAWING AFTER AN ENGLISH PRINT. Although many drawn copies of prints are known, most were made to record postures or compositions, but a few seem to show heads. A rare example of a German draw- ing taken from an English portrait recently surfaced at Galerie Gerda Bassenge (Auktion 88) in Berlin on 30 November 2006. Lot 5587, done in red chalk, was signed by Johann Daniel Preissler (1666-1737, Nuremberg) and depict- ed a Geistlichen , or cleric.

G. A. LENNOX-BOYD INIGO JONES. Jones's Italian sketchbook of 1614 has long had a certain fame among print historians by reason of the facsimile made of it in 1831 at the expense of its owner, the Duke of Devonshire. This was printed for presentation in an edition of 100 (hence it has always been a bibliograph- ical rarity), and the pages were copied by eye onto litho- graphic stones (see Michael Twyman, Early Lithographed Books , London 1990, pp. 204-08). This was done so exactly that when I first saw a copy of the book, it took me a long time to persuade myself that it was not made by some sort of transfer process. But I now learn that the draughtsman was John Payne Collier, who went on to make a very successful career as a forger of manuscripts and has now become a sub- ject of study in his own right (see Arthur and Janet Ing Freeman, John Payne Collier: Scholarship and Forgery in the Nine- teenth Century , New Haven and London 2004). This and much more emerges from Edward Chaney's new facsimile, published by the Roxburghe Club in 2006 under the title Inigo Jones's 'Roman Sketchbook ' Unlike its pre- decessor, which was a pure facsimile with no additional text, this is a full-dress publication, one volume being a facsimile, the other containing 250 pages of text along with 42 com- parative illustrations. For those to whom it is unfamiliar, the Roxburghe Club is Britain's premier bibliophilie society, founded at the sale of the library of the third Duke of Roxburghe in 1812. Its members still comprise the cultured elite of the British aristocracy, to whom have been added in these more egalitarian days the leading British scholars and collectors of a less elevated status. Traditionally, their publi- cations have only been for presentation among members, but copies of this facsimile are available for sale at £200 through Maggs Bros, at 50 Berkeley Square, London Wi. Robert Harding there, himself a scholar of Arundel and his circle, has overseen the production of the book, which is beautifully printed in letterpress and presented in a slipcase, and is a work that will be needed by any serious library. Edward Chaney's delightful and erudite text also belongs to a more leisurely age. His 83-page introduction has no fewer than 148 footnotes, and on many of the pages the massed ranks of footnotes occupy far more space than the main text. Lest anyone think this remark is critical, I add that they are the right kind of footnote which expands on some point of interest raised by the main text, and takes it off into a fascinating and very learned digression. The wrong kind of footnote merely lists books that the author has read as evidence of scholarly diligence, and leaves the reader no wiser. Although the sketchbook has often been referred to in the literature on Jones, this is the first proper study ever made of it, the first transcription and the first attempt to find the sources that underlie it. This study reaches some surprising but incontrovertible conclusions. Thus, despite Jones having bought the blank book bound in limp vellum when he reached Rome with the Earl of Arundel in 1614, and despite having written on the first page 'Roma' and the date 1614, it is now clear that he did not get very far with filling it up while he was in Rome. Most of the pages of text and draw- ings were made at least twenty years later when he had long returned to England. It follows that the term 'Sketchbook' is highly misleading, which is why the title of this study puts it into inverted commas. It is perhaps better described as a commonplace book, and almost all the text consists of trans- lations of Palladio and other architectural writers that Jones admired. The drawings have a similar second-hand nature, and, as Edward Chaney triumphantly proves by finding the sources of almost all of them, are almost all taken from prints. Most are studies of heads and parts of the body, never whole compositions, and are extracted from drawing books by Fialetti and his like, or from single-sheet prints, with Parmigianino and his followers being most heavily plun- dered. There seems no reason to think that any are taken from life, although a few of the less ambitious studies of noses might be done from memory or imagination. All in all, it is a very odd sort of production, and Chaney's introduction faces this issue squarely. Most of the copies give the name of the artist from whom they are lifted, and it is as if Jones was trying to teach himself to draw (and it is fairly remarked here that he was 'far from competent' at this), at the same time as giving himself a crash course in connois- seurship by recording the idioms of some of the artists he and the Caroline court most admired. Most people expect a sketchbook to show the creative mind in the process of devis- ing fresh ideas. This is very far from that. Rather, it is a strange and moving document of the efforts that even the leading expert in Italian architecture and painting at the Stuart court had to make to get on top of a subject that was still so deeply unfamiliar in England, antony Griffiths HOGARTH AS MUSICAL SATIRIST. In The Enraged Musician: Hogarth's Musical Imagery (Aldershot, Ashgate, 2005, 388 pp., 201 b. &amp; w. ills., £65) Jeremy Barlow reveals an aspect of Hogarth's storytelling vocabulary that art histori- ans have overlooked. Barlow is a musician and historian of music who first approached Hogarth as a potential source of information about eighteenth-century musical life. He soon realized that, visually rich and complex as it is, Hogarth's work is not a straightforward documentary record of the world around him. Even his Beggar's Opera (painted in six ver- sions), a subject that appears to record a specific stage per- formance, 'turns out to be an imaginative and selective recreation, far removed in many respects from a given moment of the original event'. Hogarth's musical imagery cannot be read at face value any more than any other ele- ment of his compositions. Barlow uses his knowledge of eighteenth-century musical instruments and musical prac- tice to demonstrate how Hogarth reinforces his satire in ways that most modern viewers have overlooked. The first chapter places music in the broader context of London's cultural life. Musicians, like visual artists, no longer depended on finding favour with a single patron. They worked for a range of clients, whether as composers, PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="7">NOTES 155 performers or tutors for noble and gentry families, or for the theatre or the church. Hogarth subscribed to the concerts organized by the Academy of Ancient Music, where ambi- tious young men might make useful contacts. Although such concerts were social events, Barlow argues that Hogarth's analogies with musical theory in his Analysis of Beauty show that he understood serious music. He points out that the first print Hogarth published himself was Masquerades and Operas , in part a satire on current musical taste for Italian opera. Furthermore, he had musician friends and his awareness of a musical in-joke is evident in a Concert Ticket , where the bored viola player has - as usual - been given a dull part to play- Barlow discusses types of music and instruments that appear in more than 70 of Hogarth's prints or paintings. Sometimes he finds answers to his initial search for infor- mation; in other cases, by contrast, he is able to use his own musical knowledge to tell us more about Hogarth's aims. An Election Entertainment and The Analysis of Beauty: Plate 2 show three-piece country dance bands, each with two melody instruments and a bass, of the type known to music histori- ans from an illustration to The Dancing Master , a collection of dance tunes of c. 1728. Such ensembles were still to be found in 1 79 1, when Joseph Haydn commented on music for danc- ing after a Lord Mayor's lunch: 'a wretched dance band, the entire orchestra consisting only of two violins and a violon- cello.' The group of fifteen men in A Chorus of Singers seems to us too small to perform an oratorio, but large choruses did not become established until the late eighteenth century. The duo of flautist and singer in Marriage a-la-Mode, Scene 4 is, however, incomplete without the continuo accompaniment of a cello or harpsichord. Barlow interprets this as a 'jibe at the ignorance and tastelessness' of the nouveau riche hostess. Earlier in the series she has hung a painting over the fire- place showing Cupid playing not a graceful lute, as one would expect, but a vulgar bagpipe. More obviously related to satire is the mid-century popu- larity of burlesque music played on improvised instruments. Horace Walpole called it 'the lowest buffoonery in the world', while Mrs Thrale found it 'wondrous droll'. Barlow links the street noises of The Enraged Musician to such perfor- mances. He illustrates a number of prints by other artists showing musicians playing instruments that include such grotesque inventions as a cat-organ, where cats screeched as their tails were pulled. Barlow differentiates such deliberate parody of conventional music from the 'rough music' associ- ated with traditional customs, notably the Skimmington, a popular parade that mocked nagging wives and cuckolded husbands. Hogarth illustrated the Skimmington scene in Hudibras with an elaborate composition referring ironically to Annibale Carracci's Procession of Bacchus and Ariadne. The importance to Hogarth's artistic development of Hudibras , his first series of large-scale prints, is often overlooked, but Barlow draws attention to the recurrence of elements in future compositions: the rough music in the Skimmington scene is echoed in the butchers playing marrow bones and cleavers outside the nuptials of the 'Industrious Prentice'; the long-bearded fiddler accompanying the dancing bear in Plate i of Hudibras appears - this time blind rather than one- legged - in Chairing the Members , and Barlow sees a deliberate counterpoint in the Enraged Musician , an elegant violinst in a well-appointed house. The entire composition of The Enraged Musician , consisting of a raucous crowd making all manner of noise outside an open window, may indeed hark back to that of Hudibras and the Skimmington. Useful appendices include an index of twenty musical instruments and scores found in Hogarth with photographs of surviving instruments. Barlow points out that the artist seems not always to render instruments precisely, but in some cases no instrument survives in an unaltered state for comparison. Inaccuracy may sometimes be related to the satirical message: Hogarth's careless rendering of the bag- pipe in seven compositions may relate to his use of the instrument as a 'symbol of contempt'. An appendix on eigh- teenth-century street cries enlarges on the main text and dis- cusses the use of cries in contemporary plays. References to popular customs were enjoyed by increasingly sophisticated city-dwellers. Theatre of the period frequently used tradi- tional ballads, whether to travesty Italian opera as in The Beggar's Opera or as a source of subject-matter, for instance Joseph Addison's Rosamond , based on the tragic story of Henry II's mistress. Hogarth uses ballad singers as a symbol of poverty, while ballads pasted on walls and elsewhere com- ment on the main subject of compositions. Barlow gives the full text of seven ballads that appear in Hogarth, including the bawdy 'Black Joke' of c. 1730, which continued to be a popular point of reference for satirists from Scene 3 of A Rake's Progress until the nineteenth century. This informative book is a helpful addition to Hogarth studies, enlarging on the artist's well-known links with the- atre and stage performance by knowledgeable and detailed analysis of the musical life of the period. SHEILA O'CONNELL BENNETT'S MADNESS. The history of the London print publisher Robert Sayer (1725-94) is reasonably clear. His entry into printselling came through his connection with Philip Overton, whose widow he married in 1748 and whose business he continued at The Golden Buck in Fleet Street (later numbered 53 Fleet Street). But there has been a cer- tain mystery over John Bennett, whom he took into partner- ship in 1774, trading henceforth as Sayer &amp; Bennett. In the mid- 1 780s the firm again reverted to Sayer &amp; Co or Robert Sayer &amp; Co. What happened to Bennett? I came across the answer when looking at the recent book by Jonathan Andrews and Andrew Scull, John Monro and Mad-doctoring in 18th-century England (Los Angeles 2001). On pp. 179-81 they record that John Bennett had been Sayer 's journeyman and was taken into partnership in 1774. In April 1783 he was admitted to Dr Monro's asylum suffering from madness, which proved to be incurable. Sayer petitioned to dissolve the partnership in June 1784, and it is the court papers that arose from this case that have provided the evidence. There is no record of the unfortunate Bennett after 1786. antony GRIFFITHS FREEMASONRY. The Craft of Freemasonry has been PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="8">156 NOTES the catalyst for the creation of a vast range of objects, many of which are interesting, impressive and very beautiful, ranging from snuff-boxes to works of architecture (some of great magnificence and rare quality). See, for example, J. Stevens Curl, The Art and Architecture of Freemasonry: An Introductory Study (London 1991; Woodstock and New York 2002); and J. Stevens Curl et al ., Architectures Maçonniques: Grande-Bretagne, France, Etats-Unis, Belgique (Brussels 2006). Common motifs are the chequered pavement, the two columns (or, illiterately, 'pillars'), the All-Seeing Eye, com- passes, triangles, squares, plumb-lines and so on, a number of which are, of course, the tools of the architect and mason, given additional significance as symbols of probity. Freemasonry is essentially a system of 'morality, veiled in allegory, and illustrated by symbols', and these symbols can be found a-plenty in the assemblages associated with Freemasonry, not the least of which may be enjoyed in the Museum at United Grand Lodge of England, Great Queen Street, London (to which the public has access). Other splendid museums containing material intimately associated with the Craft include the German Masonic Museum, Bayreuth, the Belgian Museum of Freemasonry, Brussels, the Museum of the Grand Orient of France, Paris, the Grand Lodge Library and Museum, Dublin, the National Heritage Museum, Lexington, Massachusetts, the Masonic Library and Museum of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and the Rosenau Masonic Museum, near Zwettl, Austria. A book by W. Kirk MacNulty, Freemasonry: Symbols, Secrets, Significance (London, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2006, 320 pp., 327 col. and 59 b. &amp; w. ills., £24.95), draws on these and other collections to provide a conspectus of Freemasonic objects to delight, fascinate, amuse and intrigue the beholder. Certain decorated objects associated with Freemasonic iconography (such as aprons, clocks, certificates, medals, jewellery, boxes and so on) most indubitably are singularly agreeable. Some tracing-boards and paintings, however, are distressingly rustic, even crude, but others are exquisite and there is often much to charm and inspire in the major muse- ums containing Masonic objects, almost all of which (con- trary to popular opinion, the ravings of ignorant media commentators and the madder fringes of the Loony Left) are freely open to the public, although a few institutions (such as the Rosenau Masonic Museum in Austria) make a small charge. But it should be remembered that most Continental galleries and museums levy an entrance fee, so there is noth- ing odd about that. MacNulty (or his publishers) state that the illustrations in this book are taken from 'some of the world's greatest col- lections of Masonic material' and include 'many objects never before published'. The claim for the sources is true, but that suggesting 'many' have never been published before is a slight exaggeration: 'some' would have been a little more accurate, for most of the stuff pictured (or stuff very much like it) will be familiar to students of the Craft. I recall, for example, the huge exhibition in the Historical Museum of Vienna (1992-93), the catalogue of which I have before me now, and there is considerable overlap with the book under review. Curiously, one illustration on p. 127 would appear to come from my own extensive collection, and has been repro- duced without my permission. And for those wishing to find information on illustrations, engravings and certificates (many of which are very beautiful), the most scholarly pub- lication is Ursula Terner's Freimaurerische Bildwelten: Die Ikonographie der freimaurerischen Symbolik anhand von englischen, schottischen, und französchen Freimaurerdiplomen (Petersberg, 2001). MacNulty includes some such illustrations, but barely scratches the surface of the subject when compared with Terner's admirable work, which he fails to mention in his unsatisfactory and very rudimentary bibliography. This brings me to the main problem with this book: it claims 'in-depth coverage', 'profound insights' and aspires to open 'our eyes to new, more fundamental, mysteries'. While any publication on Freemasonry that is free (as this book undoubtedly is) from sensationalism, hysteria and sheer mal- ice is to be welcomed, it has to be said that this volume is neither particularly scholarly nor very profound. The bibli- ography, for example, includes very few titles from the avail- able literature (which is vast), so will not do at all, and there is not much material in the book that cannot be found else- where. One wonders at whom this tome is aimed: it would seem to suggest the general punter, for it is essentially a picture book (attractively illustrated, it is true), but the text, regrettably, lacks 'bottom'. MacNulty has taken Shakespeare's injunction rather literally, for in his prose he has absented himself entirely from felicity. Freemasonry 'spread', apparently, and 'took on a local flavour', which might suggest jam to some, yet there is no mention at all of it 'spreading' to Poland, where it was incredibly important during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and permeated the nobility especially during the reign of Stanisfaw II August Poniatowski (1764-95). MacNulty men- tions women in Freemasonry, Women's Lodges and the Women's Grand Lodge of Belgium, but he completely ignores the Grand Adoption Lodge of Warsaw (later the Grand Charity Lodge), Princess Helena Radziwiftowa (i753-í82í), Princess Izabela Czartoryska (1746-1835), Izabela Lubomirska (1736-1816) and other luminaries of the Enlightenment in Poland connected with Freemasonry. For example, Symbolik in Gärten des 18. Jahrhunderts: Der Einfluss Unterschiedlicher Philosophischer Strömungen, wie auch der Freimaurerei , edited by J. A. M. Snoek, M. Scholl and A. A. Kroon (Den Haag 2006). There really is no excuse for such grotesque lacunae in 2006, especially as much has been published on the matter and sources that are available. Then there is the design of the book. It is 230 mm wide and just over 240 mm high, so is almost square, an awkward shape for many bookcases, and this reviewer cannot see any advantage in this format. The 'designers' have been given rather a free hand, so that we find some black type on rich red backgrounds on some pages - thus unnecessarily diffi- cult to read - and in some cases a dark purple background has been introduced on which reproductions of engravings have been overprinted, so that the images are unclear: an example is the interior of Freemasons' Hall, London, an allegorical print, on p. 24. We are not told that it is by Cipriani, nor are we given sufficiently detailed information PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 200J , 2</page><page sequence="9">NOTES 157 about what the figures represent; there is no indication that the building was designed by Thomas Sandby (1721-98) and no attempt to tell us when it was built. This is typical of the book as a whole: it is deplorably uninformative (almost coy at times), short on facts, deficient in scholarship and over- self-consciously 'designed', so it falls firmly into the 'coffee- table' category and is not even a very impressive example at that. Indeed, the overwhelming impression is of a suburban mind, lacking sufficiently wide culture to be able to deal with the wealth of potentially fascinating material. Freemasonry is a subject that, more than most, needs dis- passionate, calm, clear, scholarly investigation to dissipate the fogs of prejudice, inaccuracies, cant, lies and humbug with which it is all too often surrounded. It is astonishing, for example, that the great architect Sir John Soane (1753-1837 - whose own house in Lincoln's Inn Fields is one of the most exquisite buildings in London) has been the subject of numerous studies, yet very rarely is his affiliation with Freemasonry even mentioned, so frightened are most histo- rians of the Craft. This is very odd, as there is a well-known portrait (1828, reproduced in the book under review, p. 282) of Soane by John Jackson RA (1778-1831) that is in the Soane Museum. It shows the Master in the Freemasonic regalia of Grand Superintendent of the Works, complete with purple apron trimmed with gold fringes, sitting next to the Ark he designed for the Freemasons' Council Chamber. Despite this, some writers on Soane have been silent on the matter, even though we know Soane was a convinced Freemason and contributed liberally to Freemasonic causes. Such an avoidance of facts is at the very least peculiar: more likely it is due to cowardice. One might wish that a Freemason would have truly imparted 'profound insights' to 'open our eyes' about the Craft, as the blurb proclaims, but MacNulty has not done so. Perhaps he has been inhibited simply because he ¿y a Freemason, and therefore constrained from 'revealing' the 'mysteries' - most of which are well-known anyway - but he has similarly not revealed much about what is a huge litera- ture, and his captions are thin and not nearly as informative as they could have been. The illustrations are for the most part interesting and useful to have, although some are rendered dim by the absurd use of dark colours on which they are printed, and for this the publishers must take the blame. The text, however, is equally dim, and for that MacNulty must carry the can. The book does not really do the job it claims to do, and could have been much, much better. It is a missed opportunity, more's the pity, because the subject and the often beautiful and fascinating objects illus- trated are important for the reason that the Craft played an extremely significant part in the history of Europe and America and was enmeshed with the Enlightenment, espe- cially in France, Poland, and Central Europe. All of that has not really been satisfactorily explained, although the topic is skimmed over, so the volume is very disappointing, james STEVENS CURL THE MAGIC FLUTE. A visit to an opera house these days can be a disagreeable experience. Many designers and directors are young, arrogant and barely educated, wanting to 'make their mark' with outrageous productions that do not respect composers, librettists, or anybody else for that matter. Although it is not an opera, but a Singspiel (musical numbers linked by spoken dialogue), Mozart's Die £aubeiflöte has been maltreated as much as any. The story is dismissed as unworthy of the music. Most of us have never seen Die Zauberflöte given in full, and even so-called 'complete' record- ings of the work omit a vast amount of the dialogue. If, say, about a third of a play were to be butchered (not adapted or abridged, but savagely cut, so that the storyline becomes nonsensical), the work would not be highly regarded. Well, Mozart's wonderful creation has also been brutally man- gled, as anyone who had studied the original libretto will know. Accompanying an interesting, if prolix, book, The Magic Flute : Die Zauberflöte, An Alchemical Allegory , by M. F. M. van den Berk (Leiden and Boston 2004, 650 pp., 92 b. &amp; w. ills., S 1 49), which explains and interprets the Singspiel , to set the record straight, is a recording comprising three CDs, in which the complete dialogue is included. It is also printed in German in the volume itself. Lovers of K.620 will know that the characters in the Singspiel are not real people at all, but represent something else: alchemical archetypes. A careful reading of the libretto will ring all sorts of bells, for Orpheus, Ancient Egypt, Classical mythology and Freemasonry, among other things, permeate it. The first edition was published by Ignaz Alberti (1760-94) in 1791, and it contains a curious engraving based on two images by the Neo-Classical architect, draughtsman and teacher, Jean-Laurent Legeay (c. 1710 after 1786), who had influenced Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-78), and had worked as an architect for Friedrich II of Prussia (r. 1740-86). See Gilbert Erouart, L Architecture au Pinceau. Jean-Laurent Legeay: un piranésien fiançais dans l'Europe des Lumières (Milan and Paris 1982). Now Alberti's illustration is very odd, with two copulating dogs on top of the vase instead of Legeay's serpents, a thin pyramid or fat obelisk (not included by Legeay), a furnace, and, concealed on the path, references to Fire, Water, Mercury and the Signs of the Zodiac. There is much else as well, and it is quite clear that Alberti (himself a Freemason, as were W. A. Mozart (1756-91), Emanuel Schikaneder (1751-1812) and Karl Ludwig Giesecke (born Metzler, 1761-1831), all of whom were involved in the creation of Die Zaubeiflöte) was steeped in the Alchemical-Freemasonic ideas that flourished in late eighteenth-century Vienna. Another illustration in the original libretto shows Papageno, a figure usually treated merely as the biffo character, but his feathers were attached to his skin and he had a peacock's tail. Papageno is the Messenger-Thoth-Hermes (think of the lock applied to his mouth). Indeed, what Die Zauberflöte is really about is the Chemical Wedding, and there can be no doubting its esoteric Alchemical-Freemasonic kernel. Even the snake (usually given appalling jokey treatment in modern produc- tions) that appears at the very beginning of the action can more seriously be identified with the Egyptian Apophis, connected with Seth-Typhon, threat to the Sun, and repre- senting the forces of Chaos. It should be remembered that PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2007, 2</page><page sequence="10">158 NOTES Apophis was chopped up, and early productions involved dividing the speared serpent into three parts. Eighteenth- century Viennese Lodges had facilities for carrying out alchemical experiments, and although alchemy has been somewhat exploded by modern science, we have to realize that it was considered important then: hence the furnace clearly shown on Alberti's engraving. The book under review contains many illustrations drawn from printed sources that allude to fascinating connections with Die Zjiubeiflöte and its creators. It is a pity, therefore, that it should be marred by three rather serious problems. First of all, it contains far too many exclamation marks (don't shout, wrote my wise English teacher when marking some of my schoolboy effusions); the Errant Apostrophe is painfully in evidence; and it would appear that an educated native English speaker did not proofread it, for we have 'bear' instead of 'bare' and there are many other clangers. More inexcusably, there are misquotations and errors. For exam- ple, Mozart's letter to his father of 9 June 1784 is cited, but Baden is given as Baaden, and Leemann as Leemman. Artemis of Ephesus is described as having 'multiple breasts', although anyone who has seen a statue of the deity knows they cannot be breasts, but are probably either eggs or the testicles of sacrificed animals. The book could have been reduced by at least half with careful editing, for there are endless repetitions. Infuriatingly, there is no index, seriously disadvantaging the reader and making the book impossible to use for reference purposes. There are also lacunae in the Bibliography. Nevertheless, readers of Print Quarterly will find much of interest in The Magic Flute , not least the pointers to other publications, and the illustrations hint at a massive field of study as yet only partly ploughed. JAMES STEVENS CURL THE BATH CHRONICLE. Jacob Simon has drawn my attention to a useful online source for information on the print trade in Georgian Bath provided by the Bath and North-East Somerset Council's local archives department in Bath, which has put together a searchable database for the weekly newspaper, The Bath Chronicle , covering the years 1770 to 1800. This may be consulted at http:/ / www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/lifeandleisure/leisure /localarchives/ georgian/historv.htm. Particularly valuable are the notices and advertisements. One learns, for instance, that Bath was among several provincial cities that hosted exhibitions of the Polygraphie Society. J. L. Newman, its Bath agent, staged two shows at the Repository on The Walks in February and November 1792. The forthcoming publication of an aquatint, South West View of Bath, after Dominic Serres, taken from the grounds of Perrymead, the composer Venanzio Rauzzini's country house, was announced on 10 October 1793. The drawing could be inspected at Serres's house, 20 Belvedere, while R. Ricard at 6 Bond Street took subscriptions. Ricard had Francis Jukes's Views on the Dee for sale in June 1794. The drawing master John Sanders of 9 Lansdowne Crescent published his aqua- tints of the west front of Bath Abbey and of the High Street in March 1794 at 3 shillings apiece and sold his set of six aquatints of Bath and Bristol for 12 shillings. Peter Benazech (d. 1798), after being away from Bath for eleven years, announced the publication of two etchings, Storm and Calm , in the paper on 22 October 1789. A mezzotint of Mrs Siddons as Zara, after a pastel by the very youthful Thomas Lawrence, was advertised to subscribers from his home at Alfred Street for 5 shillings and a 2s 6d delivery charge on 7 November 1782. On 26 January 1786 Edmund Scott announced that he was going to engrave Thomas Stothard's The Wreck of the Halsewell East Indiaman , a print of which the fame has long been eclipsed by Gillray's spirited engraving after Northcote published the following year. Naval subjects were clearly favoured in Bath. J. Pass's engraving after Robert Dodd's An Exact Representation of the Boarding and Taking the Cleopatra French Frigate by La Nymphe Captain Sir Edward Pellew was announced on 1 August 1793, but the advertiser got the information wrong, thinking Dodd was the engraver, not the painter. Plura &amp; Bally at 10 Milsom Street were the leading auc- tion house for prints, but they had keen competition from William Evill at 18 Milsom Street, Mr Hathway in Bond Street, Mr Spackman in Monmouth Street, William Birchall of Queen Square, who held the portrait painter Thomas Beach's studio sale on 24 March 1785, and several others. The printseller William Basnett, who dealt in English, French and Italian prints, put his stock in the hands of Mr Cross to sell by auction on 19 April 1780 and the fol- lowing days. He had moved from London to Bath in 1770. MARTIN HOPKINSON GEORGE CUITT APPEAL.

PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="11">NOTES 159 Although this catalogue is fundamentally a reprint of the one identically titled that was published to accompany an exhibition at the Wordsworth Trust at Grasmere in 1997, there are some differences in this new edition worth noting: The Rime of the Ancient Manner : The Poem and its Illustrators (Grasmere, The Wordsworth Trust, 2006, 150 pp., 75 colour and 13 b. &amp; w. ills., £19.95 Pb&gt; £29.95 hb)- The reprised show ran both at its original venue and at the Manor House Art Gallery and Museum, Ilkley (22 November 2006-22 July 2007), and on this occasion the exhibits were drawn almost entirely from the collection of the Trust itself - a situation brought about by judicious acquisition over ten years. Poignantly dedicated to the memory of the distinguished former director, Robert Woof (1931-2005), the book now contains a useful essay on the various literary versions of the poem by Seamus Perry, a reprint of Woof's piece from the first edition and twenty detailed entries on work by, among others, David Scott (the first artist to illustrate the poem in 1 837), Joseph Noel Paton (1863), Gustave Doré (1876), André Lhotě (1920), Alexander Calder (1946) and Sven Berlin (1997)- The bibliography has been updated, but does not include perhaps the most significant study of the subject made in recent years. This is Illustrated Editions of Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Manner , by Geoffrey Beare and Lorraine Janzen Kooistra, in 'Singular Visions - The Journal of the Imaginative Book Illustration Society, no. 2 (London 2002, pp. 53-98). It contains a bibliography of 93 numbers, one of which is the first edition of the present catalogue. The new version is extremely well produced and finely printed in Kendal by Titus Wilson, although the extraordinary copper engravings made for the poem in 1929 by David Jones are disappointingly rather dimly presented. Too frequently in publications today insufficient care is taken with black-and- white images, which are notoriously tricky to reproduce satisfactorily despite technological advances in digital scanning. PAUL GOLDMAN MODERN LIFE IN PARIS. Just under a third of the exhibits in the Portland Museum of Art's show and its accompanying catalogue, Paris and the Countryside: Modern Life in Late-igth-century France , were prints. Oddly, their themes were entirely concentrated on city life. Thus, of the two essays by Gabriel P. Weisberg and Jennifer L. Shaw only the first has any relevance to print historians. Weisberg, the doyen of Bing studies, introduces the reader to two little- known posters for the short-lived gallery La Maison Moderne, an enterprise launched in September 1899 by the celebrated art critic Julius Meier-Graefe, which since its demise in 1904 has been largely forgotten. Strangely, Weisberg fails to mention here that Bing's gallery must have been the model for the German's venture. More can be found on this aspect of Meier-Graefe 's career in Nancy J. Troy, Modernism and the Decorative Arts in France: Art Nouveau to Le Corbusier (New Haven and London, 1991), and in Weisberg's article, 'Lost and found: S. Bing's merchandising of Japonisme and Art Nouveau', in the Internet journal Nineteenth-century Art Worldwide (Summer 2005), http: //www. 19thc-artworldwide.org/ summer_Q5/articles/ weis_print. html. The Japoniste poster of the Paris-based Roman artist Manuel Orazi (1860-1934), famous for his occultist litho- graphic calendar published by Bing's L'Art Nouveau in 1895, shows a very fashionably dressed young Cléo de Mérode seated beside a display of the high-quality Art Nouveau ceramics, glass, objets d'art and statuettes available from La Maison Moderne. This poster was illustrated by René Puaux in his article on La Maison Moderne in Deutsche Kunst und Dekoration (xii, September 1903, p. 55). In another poster, Maurice Biais (1872-1926), who was employed by Meier-Graefe as a decorative designer as well as a poster artist, showed a back view of Jane Avril, then Biais's mistress and later his wife. She is represented as inspecting an elabo- rate cabinet designed by Henry Van de Velde, in which fur- ther wares on offer are displayed. The lithograph is Belgian in style, the colours evoking artists like Evenepoel. This print also offers a view of the elaborate scheme of decoration pro- vided by Van de Velde for La Maison Moderne 's vaulted rooms. Biais had worked for Bing before working for Meier- Graefe. No prints are visible in the posters and none are discussed or illustrated in Documents sur l'art industriel au XXe siècle (Paris, Galerie de la Maison Moderne, c. 1900), a volume illustrat- ed with drawings by Félix Vallotton, which reproduces pho- tographs of pieces of decorative art and sculpture available from Meier-Graefe's gallery. Nevertheless, it is very likely that prints were sold there. For the gallery published Germinal , a major portfolio of twenty prints dedicated to Zola in an edition of 100, which was accompanied by a text in German by Meier-Graefe. A full list of its contents, which included woodcuts, lithographs, an etching and a drypoint, can be found in Kenneth Moffett, Meier-Graefe as Art Critic (Munich 1973, pp. 160-61). While predominantly French, the artists included Peter Behrens, Brangwyn, Liebermann, Toorop, Van Rysselberghe, Vallotton and Zuloaga. The oldest Frenchman to be represented was Degas. Among the younger figures were Bonnard, Denis and Vuillard. Weisberg has always been interested in French represen- tation of urban life in various strata of society. Here one finds discussion of the social consciousness of Steinlen and of Chahine's lithographs of the poor in Montmartre. The Armenian was attracted to scenes of open air entertainment such as were provided by a travelling circus and by wrestlers grappling on the ground in a makeshift arena created on wasteland. Weisberg alludes to the preoccupation with beg- gars in the prints of Paul Blanc (1836-1910), whose work he brought to light in Second Impressions: Modern Prints and Print- makers reconsidered edited by Clinton Adams (Albuquerque, The Tamarind Institute, 1996, pp. 13-25). He also discusses Steinlen's prints of laundresses. In this subject, of course, he was following Daumier. Legrand updates Manet and Degas in his 1908 etching Au bar , a scene that Weisberg relates to child prostitution in Montmartre. He omits to mention the racial undertone in the print - the male customer is black. Drug abuse is represented here by Grasset's graphic Morphine addict. PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="12">l6o NOTES As one might expect in an exhibition of this kind, the world of the theatre and the café-concert is strongly featured through the work of Toulouse-Lautrec and his images of May Milton and Aristide Bruant, as well as of Jane Avril. The use of posters to promote books is shown through the inclusion of Babylone d Allemagne , an advertisement for a book by Victor Joze on German debauchery, featuring a carica- tured Kaiser looking at the back view of a horse. Satire was read into a number of Toulouse-Lautrec's lithographs. Weisberg records that the Belgian jeweller, Henri Nocq, thought that in his poster for L'Artisan Moderne , a collective of designers' shops, the French artist was making fun of him by representing him as a repairman visiting a young lady in her bedroom with an empty box. The representation of ten cyclists on just two vehicles in the background of La Chaîne Simpson , Lautrec's poster for the bicycle manufacturer L. B. Spoke, has been related to Etienne Marey's photography of figures in movement. Weisberg, however, notes that five-man bicycles were available in the 1890s, and the artist may have been specifically asked to promote them, martin hopkinson WHISTLER LITHOGRAPHS AT DAVIS. The Richard L. Nelson Gallery and Fine Arts Collection, University of California at Davis, has recently paid tribute to the New York dealer and collector, Jeffrey Ruesch, with an exhibition of all 60 of the lithographs by Whistler that he presented to his alma mater. The accompanying catalogue, The Jeffrey Ruesch Collection: Lithographs by James McNeill Whistler (Davis, CA, 2007, 32 pp., 12 col. ills., $5) includes essays by Dennis E. Carlton on his friend Ruesch, who died in 2003, and by Jeffrey Ruda on the lithographs. Ruesch studied art history at Davis in the 1960s before gaining a Ph.D. at Columbia University. As a dealer and collector he was associated above all with the prints of Andy Warhol. He also owned several works by Wayne Thiebaud and had a passion for posters. Ruda argues that one of the reasons for Whistler's lithographs remaining the least known of his works is the extreme subtlety of his effects. As he notes, the Ruesch collection is particularly strong in works of the 1890s and in portraits. The only intaglio prints by Whisder in the collection are two drypoint portraits of 1859, not included in this show. Ruda offers a judicious survey of the various sub- jects explored by Whistler in lithography, although he leaves the impression that the American completely abandoned lithotint after his early experiments in the late 1870s, neglect- ing to mention his 1896 view of the Thames from the Savoy Hotel, where he was staying with his wife in the last months of his life. MARTIN HOPKINSON DUILIO CAMBELLOTTI. After Adolfo De Carolis and Giulio Aristide Sartorio, Duilio Cambellotti was arguably one of the most significant artists to be associated with Stil Floreale, the Italian equivalent of Art Nouveau. His multi- faceted talents have been celebrated recendy in two exhibi- tions in Rome held at the Biblioteca Angelica and the Galleria d'Arte F. Russo. These were accompanied by the catalogue Duilio Cambellotti : Mito , segno e immagine (Rome, De Luca Editori d'Arte, 2006, 152 pp. 72 col. and 180 b. &amp; w. ills., €15), edited by Daniela Fonti, Nicoletta Muratore and Isabella de Stefano. Francesco Tetro and Agnese Sferrazza also contributed to this publication. Cambellotti was steeped in the theories of William Morris, which he imbibed through the teaching of the painter Domenico Morani at the evening classes held in Rome's Museo Artistico Industriale, where De Carolis was also a student. He was also inspired by the Utopian socialism of Tolstoy. During his time at the Museo Artistico Industriale he studied Roman and Etruscan pot- tery, but much of his time was devoted to decorative art, to ceramics and to designing posters and publicity material. His maiolica vases and bronzes continued to reflect the flu- idity of Art Nouveau right into the 1930s. Yet he was also a friend of the Futurists, Balla, Boccioni and Severini. Throughout his career Cambellotti was frequently commis- sioned to produce stage designs. He worked on the sets for D'Annunzio 's play La Nave, performed in 1908 at the Teatro Argentina in Rome. After World War II he was also active as a designer for films, in which he was involved as early as 1918. During the 1930s he was commissioned to design the furnishings and murals for public buildings in Rome, south- ern Italy and Ragusa. Many of these aspects of his work are covered in this catalogue. However, Cambellotti is probably best known today as a book illustrator. A wide selection of this work was presented at the Biblioteca Angelica. In the field of graphic arts he first made his name with his posters for the Teatro Drammatico Nazionale di Roma of 1896, and with those for the 1898 Turin Esposizione Nazionale executed the previous year. Severini perceptively associated his work with that of the Munich Secession. Cambellotti was certainly aware of Stuck and Klinger. The latter had lived in Rome from 1888 to 1893, and his set of etchings, Vom Tod. Erste Teil. Opus XI, was published there in 1889. Even more significant for him was the work of another foreigner in Rome, Otto Greiner, as was noted by Severini. The clarity of line and the Neo- Renaissance style often adopted by Cambellotti in his draw- ings and prints reflect this. A similar clarity in the stage designs of Gordon Craig and his followers must also have interested him. One should also remember the presence in Rome of the American painter, Elihu Vedder, who was involved from the start in Giovanni Costa's In Arte Libertas. In Cambellotti's posters and illustrations one can also posit occasional connections with the work of Klimt and Koloman Moser. In the field of illustration he worked close- ly with Edoardo de Fonseca, whose review Novissima was studded with his work between 1902 and 1909. Cambellotti's initial foray into direct printmaking was with a group of drypoints made c. 1906-10, one of which has some similarity in approach to contemporary work by Boccioni. However, it was in the field of woodcut that he earned his reputation as a printmaker. He began making woodcuts in 191 1, and in a period of almost 40 years created an Œuvre of around 150 prints. The exhibitions and catalogue presented quite a number of Cambellotti's preparatory drawings, sometimes alongside the finished woodcuts. In some of his most striking early woodcuts he adopted the elongated format stemming from the landscapes of Costa PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 200J, 2</page><page sequence="13">NOTES l6l and his associates, but also found in the work of Klinger. The figures in the sky of his first great print, Lo scheletro della capan- na of 1911, recall Transalpine works. The Maremma and the barren country south of Rome attracted Cambellotti. So it is not surprising that his 1918 woodcuts of horses and oxen make one think of Fattori. However, his outstanding print was La siepe executed in 19 14, a desolate vision of the skulls of the countless thousands who were to perish in World War I. Cambellotti only rose again to something approaching these heights in 1929, with his anthropomorphic Albero e aquile , part of Parvenze cimine , a cycle of three woodcuts. In this case he made considerable alterations to the design after executing the preparatory pencil drawing presented in this exhibition. This print shows his long-term adherence to Symbolist art. The exhibition included several of Cambellotti's drawings for the woodcut cycle Leggende Romane , begun in 1926, on which he worked for over 30 years. Ettore Gozzani's article on his work in L'Eroica, November-December 1937, illustrated Pater Tiberinus , one of the best of these, an impression of which was shown in Rome. A view of horses gathering around a cradle contain- ing the tiny Romulus and Remus, it is set up high above the winding Tiber, a landscape that recalls the backgrounds of paintings by Baldovinetti and Antonio Poliamolo, martin HOPKINSON PAUL CASSIRER. Writing about Paul Cassirer means, in the first instance, facing preconceptions, often unproven or unclear ideas, or a wrong understanding of the art mar- ket and of publishing in Germany in the first quarter of the twentieth century. Some of these date back to his own time, others arose either from mixing him up with his cousin Bruno, or just from misunderstandings of the situation in Berlin around World War I and the cultural environment in the city at that time. However, writing about Paul Cassirer means, in the second instance, dealing with one of the most important publishers and art dealers of the first quarter of the twentieth century. His name appears in many mono- graphs and exhibition catalogues either as dealer in nine- teenth-century French paintings or in German paintings dating from the early twentieth century, but also as a pub- lisher of books and portfolios with prints, single-sheets, a supporter of artists, writers and musicians, or as one of the driving forces of cultural life in 1920s Berlin. Not many other people can be nominated who had a similar impact on cul- tural life and on the ideas that later generations held about the culture of the 1920s. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how a history of German culture, painting, drawing and print- making could be written without having at least one chapter on Paul Cassirer. This immense importance is probably also one reason why it can be difficult to get to grips with the diverse aspects of his life. A new publication, edited by Rahel E. Feilchenfeldt and Thomas Raff, undertakes that difficult task (Ein Fest der Künste Paul Cassirer Der Kunsthändler als Verleger , Munich, Verlag C. H. Beck, 2006, 424 pages, 50 col. and 106 b. &amp; w. ills., €29.90). Beside being an anthology with many essays by different authors, it was an exhibition catalogue in 2006 (Berlin, Max- Liebermann-Haus, 17 February-21 May 2006). The scope of this volume is vast and its aim was to cover all aspects of Cassirer. This is a complex picture, which developed pardy because Cassirer was engaged in several fields at the same time. With his cousin, Bruno Cassirer, he was active in the publishing and art scene and owned the legendary Kunstsalon between 1898 and 1901, which included a pub- lishing house as well as a gallery. This was a promising start. The two cousins developed their activities successfully and many important museum directors such as Lichtwark, von Bode or Waldmann collaborated with them either as authors or in their capacity as dealers in contemporary French and German art. Contemporary reviews and com- mentary on the conservative art establishment in Berlin around 1900 underline the importance of their enterprise. When, however, they decided to separate their businesses, Paul concentrated on the art market and agreed not to be active as a book publisher until 1908. The concept of being a gallery, a publisher of art works and later a publishing house of books and journals was probably the key to the long-lasting and remarkable success that Paul Cassirer had. It seems that all his activities were connected in one way or another with a different facet of his ideas, which makes it dif- ficult to write about him. Fortunately, Feilchenfeldt and Raff had the good sense to break up these various aspects into single essays, asking 22 fellow authors - all highly regarded specialists in their respective fields - to contribute to this volume. The outcome is remarkable. Many of these essays deal directly or indirectly with printmaking, its contemporary perception, production conditions, or references given to other works, either to those of the printmaker himself or to works of fellow artists. It was often not straightforward, as becomes obvious with the woodcuts by Barlach (see Sebastian Giesen's essay, pp. 76-86). In 1910 Barlach had reached an agreement with Paul, but suddenly found him- self caught between the two cousins and their different approaches to book design and the use of printmaking in high quality books. Barlach saw his woodcuts as a disaster and, as proposed by Paul Cassirer, concentrated instead on lithography Only at the end of World War I did he come back to woodcut, this time with much greater success. He used it to illustrate his own poem, 'Der Kopf' ('The Head'), which was published in 19 19 by Paul Cassirer. It was a turn- ing point in his printed œuvre , despite the fact that he contin- ued using lithography on an occasional basis. But Barlach and the woodcut are just one example among those analysed in this book. Another is Slevogt, and his various illustrations for books (Catharine Krahmer on Meier- Graefe, Cassirer and the Pan-Connection, pp. 87-101, and Stephanie Jacobs on the Pan-Presse in general, concentrat- ing on illustrators and printmakers other than Slevogt, pp. 102-21). Yet another is Christine Zeiller's excellent essay on Beckmann's illustrations to Johannes Guthmann's manu- script on 'Euridikes Wiederkehr' (pp. 139-50). This was roughly at the same time as Barlach 's lithographs and seems more than a coincidence. It was another case of the prints being closely linked to the design of the book, as in Slevogt's PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="14">1 62 NOTES illustrations. However, Zeiller links these illustrations to sev- eral single-sheets and therefore places the illustrations and the other prints in a wider context, linked both to Cassirer and to Beckmann himself. Two other essays deal more with portfolios and with similar links to paintings, drawings or other prints, or even to some single-sheets, despite the fact that Cassirer was usually not interested in publishing single- sheets. These two essays deal with lesser known printmakers, such as the image of Berlin in the portfolios and the prints by Georg Hermann and Rudolf Großmann (Eva Caspers, pp. 187-200), and on prints by the sculptor August Gaul (Josephine Gabler, pp. 214-27). A very particular case in Cassirer's publishing programme was Hermann Struck's Die Kunst des Radierens ('The Art of Etching'), which saw five editions. It was one of the most important books on contemporary printmaking in general and its relation to previous generations, and became a kind of handbook. Furthermore, it changed the selection of images over the various editions. Inka Bertz rightly states in her essay (pp. 122-39) ^is book was framed by impor- tant and bibliophile editions of the Pan-Presse on the one hand, and successful but more popular more art-historical publications from the Cassirer publishing house on the other. But as she points out, this publication may lead to a better understanding of Cassirer as a print and book pub- lisher. Overall, this book is not only a huge step forward in Cassirer scholarship and the cultural situation in Germany from the turn of the century to the mid- 1920s, but will also be a constant inspiration for exhibitions and further research. For this, its editors and authors deserve consider- able recognition. CHRISTIAN RÜMELIN BRANGWYN'S FIRST ETCHINGS. In Print Quarterly , XXIII, 2006, pp. 436-38, I discussed the uncertainty as to when Frank Brangwyn made his first etchings. The exhibi- tion at the William Morris Gallery, Walthamstow, in October 2006, which celebrated the 50th anniversary of his death by displaying a selection of works from its Brangwyn collection, provided the answer. It included three virtually unknown etchings from the collection of A. H. Mackmurdo, bequeathed to the Walthamstow Gallery in 1963 by the architect and designer's niece, Elinor Pugh. What is clearly the earliest of these, the unpublished The Bridge, a view of the wooden bridge at Putney, measuring 67 x 106 mm, is signed and dated 1882 (cat. no. P599). Brangwyn was only fifteen at the time and the etching is very slight. The other two prints, which appear to have been printed a great deal later, perhaps as late as the 1940s, are much stronger. One of them is another view of Putney Bridge, viewed at much closer distance, measuring 125 x 175 mm. The second is a view of shipping, probably on the Thames, measuring 107 x 155 mm. These latter two prints are record- ed in Norah Gillow's Catalogue of the Works of Sir Frank Brangwyn, R.A., 1 867-1 gj6 (Walthamstow 1974), pp. 77-78. Both display a strong influence from Whistler, who had of course etched Putney Bridge twice himself (Old Putney Bridge K178 and The Little Putney No. / K179) in 1879 shortly before leaving for Venice. A Turneresque watercolour by Brangwyn of Old Putney Bridge is also in the William Morris Gallery. Brangwyn's print of shipping could be com- pared with Whistler's The Thames towards Erith, From Pickle- Herring Stairs, and The Large Pool (K165, 167 and 174), also dat- ing from the late 1870s. One wonders whether he had any direct contact with the American in the early 1880s. Peter Cormack kindly allowed me to consult the Brangwyn corre- spondence in the William Morris Gallery, where one learns that in 1955 Brangwyn sent a reproduction of his water- colour of Old Putney Bridge to Elinor Pugh, adding a note, 'this is the old bridge where I used to walk when I was about 15 years'. When shown the plate for the earlier print of the bridge in 1942, the artist told Elinor Pugh in a letter of 26 August that 'it was done when in Newman Street, where Benjamin Creswick the sculptor and I had a room'. He also added that he had had the plate destroyed. Creswick (1853-1946), like Brangwyn, was involved with A. H. Mackmurdo 's the Century Guild of Artists, started in 1882. Mackmurdo took the teenager up that year, invited him to his house in Fitzroy Street and introduced him to the friends in his circle. Through Mackmurdo, Brangwyn gained employment in William Morris's Queen Square workshops. He and Creswick shared a room in 1884 at 55 Newman Street. If Brangwyn's memory was accurate, 1884 was the date of his second and third etchings. In 1885 he lived at 18 Shepherd's Bush Green. On 1 March 1948 Brangwyn wrote to Elinor Pugh referring to the other two plates: 'I am sending back the little etchings they are very poor; you should destroy them.' Fortunately she did not, and their existence tends to confirm the otherwise surprising assertion made by Selwyn Image (1849-1930) in 1927 that Brangwyn had taught him to etch when he was in Newman Street. It seems, however, that Brangwyn made no further etchings until the late 1890s. Image, of course was a close associate of Mackmurdo. He met the young Brangwyn in 1883. One other early etching is kept with Brangwyn's correspondence with Elinor Pugh. This is a small upright winter landscape (Cat P5i9(i)), which, one gathers from a letter of 16 December 1943 (written as 1493 by Brangwyn), was sent by him to her as a Christmas card that year. MARTIN HOPKINSON PRINTMAKING IN MAINE. A book sponsored by the Maine Print Project, a collaborative series of events taking place from 2006 to 2007 involving 25 exhibition spaces in the state, attempts an ambitious overview of the history of print- making in Maine. As the author rightly points out, an overview of the various printmaking studios and artists' colonies, such as Monhegan and the Vinalhaven Press, deserve a comprehensive publication. However, The Imprint of Place: Maine Printmaking 1800-2003, by David P. Becker (Camden, ME, 2006, Down East Books, 136 pp., 83 col. ills., $35), does not really fulfil this need - either for the newcom- er to the subject or the specialist. Becker includes a useful glossary of printmaking techniques at the end of the book and a wide bibliography on the general history and tech- niques of printmaking, with a similar list devoted specifical- ly to Maine and, finally, a section that includes individual PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 200J, 2</page><page sequence="15">NOTES 163 publications on the printmakers covered in the book. However, as a useful reference tool the book suffers from the lack of even a basic index. In spite of the title, The Imprint of Place looks at print- making in Maine from its earliest developments in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries before concentrating on the main body of works dating from the twentieth centu- ry, which are illustrated with 70 handsome colour plates. Becker has divided his work into five chapters written as a continuous historical narrative: 'Beginnings: The Nine- teenth Century', 'Crosscurrents: Modern and Traditional 1900-1930', 'Depression and the War Years', 'New Directions, New Teaching 1945-1980' and 'From Tradi- tional to Digital 1980-2005'. The first chapter contains the most interesting and useful material. Becker's new research into nineteenth-century commercial and fine art printmak- ing in Maine provides an informative overview that deserves several more chapters, if not another publication. Becker places Maine printmaking within the longue durée of American artistic development and this attempt to use a broader framework is not an altogether successful strategy. Too many artists are cited - often in a cursory manner and not always illustrated - for a coherent story to be formed. For example, Marsden Hartley is included, although his sta- tus as a 'Maine printmaker' is highly subjective (his prints were produced while in Europe and do not reflect Maine themes). Similarly, certain central aspects of the American artistic mainstream were not necessarily present in Maine to the extent that they were in other centres. As Becker acknowledges in chapter three, 'The Depression and the War Years', Maine did not possess its own Graphic Arts Division of the WPA and it is questionable how far, and in what specific ways, the Depression affected printmakers in the state - questions that are not adequately addressed here. The issue of how urban styles, such as the Precisionism of Louis Lozowick, translated to the depiction of the Maine scene remain largely unanswered; a pity, as this could have strengthened the thesis for the specificity of Maine print- making. On the whole, I feel a more judicious editing of cited artists and the use of a more rigorous thematic structure would have created a more focussed overview. Rather than being chronological, this could be based either solely on the land and seascapes of Maine or on the individual histories of printmaking studios in the state. As it stands, and in spite of its ambitions and qualities, The Imprìnt of Place fails to impress upon its reader the distinct identity and history of printmak- ing in Maine. JERZY KIERKU C-BIELINSKI AGNES MILLER PARKER. A book dedicated 'For my grandchildren' is an indication of how long its author has been at work on the subject. 'A personal interest in the wood engravings of Agnes Miller Parker commenced some forty years ago', Ian Rogerson writes in his preface; 'my appoint- ment to the newly established post of Polytechnic Librarian at Manchester in 1972 gave me the opportunity to create a Book Design Collection. By 1980 Manchester Polytechnic Library held a complete collection of the books illustrated by Agnes Miller Parker.' That was a remarkable achievement in eight years. It was to be the foundation of further landmarks in his study of the work of this wood-engraver, The Wood Engravings of Agnes Miller Parker (London, The British Library, 2006, 328 pp., 15 col. and 902 b. &amp; w. ills., £60). It is worth noting the emphasis that the author places on the importance of having a complete collection of the books illustrated by Agnes Miller Parker. At the close of his brief but invaluable preface, he defines three categories of her work: R - books illustrated with wood-engravings and linocuts; RSP - prints that were created as freestanding engravings; RAP - prints created for inclusion in advertise- ments. The first category accounts for by far the greater part of her work. RSP is surprisingly, even unexpectedly, small in proportion. Parker's work was therefore mostly done for books, and all too seldom are print rooms well supplied with these. Indeed, prints have been ranked with paintings and drawings as images that, when not in solander boxes, can be framed and hung, whether architectural, topographical, allegorical or figurative. The importance of cognate collec- tions of the books for which the prints were made has all too often been considered of secondary importance, and as a responsibility that falls to libraries. This separation is here shown to have been fallacious. From his first paragraph, Professor Rogerson emphasizes the vital interrelationship. It is a lesson that ought to be learnt and taken to heart not only by curators of print collections, but also by other staff mem- bers in museums. It is an initiative and a lead that should be followed. Frequently, the acceptance of books, let alone their acquisition, has been declined and neglected. Rogerson's book shows how much an artist benefits from the interrela- tionship. Joan Hassall, and many others, would benefit in the same way. As appears in the comprehensive bibliography, which forms the basis of the book, the beginning in 1972 was a pre- lude to three serious studies of her work: Agnes Miller Parker: Wood Engraver and Book Illustrator i8gj-ig8o, by Ian Rogerson, with recollections of the artist by John Dreyfus (Wakefield 1990); Agnes Miller Parker : Wood Engravings from the Fables of Esope; The Story of a Remarkable Book , by Ian Rogerson (Newton, Powys 1996); and Agnes Miller Parker : Wood Engravings from XXI Welsh Gypsy Folk-Tales, John Sampson and the Gipsies of Wales , by Ian Rogerson (Newtown, Powys 1997). These are R44, R45 and R46 respectively They demon- strate the author's deep, as well as long, familiarity with the subject of this artist. It opens with an admirably illustrated essay on the artist as 'Wood Engraver and Illustrator', in which the importance of the work produced during the brief years at Gregynog of William McCance and his wife, Agnes Miller Parker, and of Blair Hughes Stanton and his wife, Gertrude Hermes, can hardly be exaggerated. Between 1930 and 1933, in the depths of the Depression, in remote Montgomeryshire, some of the finest wood-engravings of the twentieth century were produced. Despite the importance attached to the books illustrated, there is a danger that without access to the prints them- selves, the RSP, the proofs, the pulls and the small editions, PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="16">164 NOTES the profound skill of Agnes Miller Parker may not be fully appreciated. This includes the wonderful subtleties of her craft, the tonal values, those qualities that were so admired by her fellow wood-engravers and treasured by scarcely less skilled practitioners like Glare Leighton, George Mackley and Monica Poole. Rogerson justly quotes Glare Leighton's 'detailed analysis' of the 'Gatte and Chyken' in her Wood Engraving and Woodcuts (1932, p. 36), and later quotes from Clare Leighton: 'She is probably one of the most highly skilled engravers living. No one can equal her in her delicate merging of blacks into whites through infinite varyings of greys.' This is shown to perfection in her study of the Otter in Down the River (frontispiece and p. 143). The graceful otter would become an ideal illustration for Henry Williamson's Tarka the Otter (1927). For her two books, while living in Shropshire, published by Victor Gollancz in 1936 and 1937, both by H. E. Bates, Through the Woods and Down the River , she made 156 wood-engravings. Both are marked by her acute observation of nature, of moorhens, the gamekeeper's gibbet, pheasants, warblers, foxes, mallards, magpies, herons, piglets, rooks, lapwings, jays, weasels and bullfinches. All are masterly and vibrant, as is her gift of cap- turing the 'jizz' of the birds, their distinctive characteristics. George Mackley wrote in his Wood Engraving (1948): The cutting of her works is remarkably clean and will bear the closest inspection. There is never a slovenly line or edge to be seen. Added to all the technical delights of these works there is much pleasure to be derived from the subject matter and from the skilful way in which it used. Where better to test Mackley's judgement than in the large wood-engravings that she made for the Limited Editions Club in 1938 of Elegy in a Country Churchyard by Thomas Gray? These are reproduced at 75 per cent of their actual size. This was 133 x 114 mm, as in the illustration on p. 44 for stanza 17, 'Forbad to wade through slaughter' and p. 45 for stanza 8. The 32 prints, one for each stanza in the poem, are some of her most complex work, described by Rogerson 'as possibly the most difficult of all her interpretative pro- jects'. To understand it, it is necessary to have the text of the poem to hand in order to see how 'she employed the device of using both the literal and the imaginative in a single image'. These engravings 'are imbued with character and analysis that attempt to reflect those external happenings shadowed by romantic imagination'. Here it might have been best to have reproduced the prints life-size and to have given them more space, but it would have been dispropor- tionate to the whole. If such a close comparative study is demanding, it is also rewarding. Let Rogerson have the last word: While Gray's Elegy is now the most eagerly sought after of her books for the Limited Editions Club of New York, these images are by no means the most popular of her work, puzzling to readers more familiar with representa- tional than interpretative illustration. Yet, for those who acknowledge that the creative wood engraver can be more than a minor contributor to the universal scheme of arts, Agnes Miller Parker would never surpass her interpretation of Gray's poem. One can immediately dis- cern that everything has a purpose, every line tells and the meaning of her pictures is apparent. It would be good to have a new edition of Elegy. Some of the engravings were editioned as prints as can be found in R.44 (pp. 67-68). Professor Rogerson has produced an invaluable work of reference. He has shown the huge quantity of work his sub- ject produced. If a criticism might be ventured of his magnum opus , it is that the illustrations are too closely packed togeth- er and too dark. That has to be forgiven in the interest of the comprehensive nature of his catalogue. There is no alterna- tive to seeking out the highest quality of Parker's work, its acme, in RSP. It is all here, a visual catalogue, well-orga- nized and presented, bibliographically ordered and correct. The design, typesetting, printed in Bembo, as was to be expected from David Esslemont, are first class. Although thick (38 mm), it is not too large. It is definitive and easy to use. It is well-indexed. Anyone whose interest in this wood- engraver is aroused can rely not only on the bibliography but also on the encouragement to be found in 'Further Reading'. This must be the last word on Agnes Miller Parker and is a cause for congratulation and gratitude to the author. This Note opened with the explicit emphasis on the need for a complete collection of the books which have been illus- trated by a wood-engraver. Another subject is implicit. Of a general nature, but no less important, is the rôle of the cura- tor in caring for, enlarging, forming and nourishing their collections. That little attention has been, or is, paid to such work is probably beneficial to the quiet, unsung, achieve- ments of those curators who can do so much, with modest or even derisory funds, in fields that may be overlooked or unfashionable. They may not receive recognition or public- ity, nor might they welcome it. The work is its own reward. The solid achievements of curators, scholars like Ian Rogerson and this Journal's frequent contributor, Martin Hopkinson, have rendered an invaluable service to print- makers and, by preserving and presenting their work so assiduously, to posterity. IAN LOWE MATISSE AS PRINTMAKER. In 1908 Matisse wrote in his 'Notes of a Painter', published in La Grande Revue , that he dreamed of a balanced art, an art of purity, of silence, with- out any worrying or terrifying subjects and that could serve various people or social classes. It is well-known that in this idea Matisse was referring to a text by Baudelaire, who him- self referred variously to the Salons of Diderot. This was an ongoing discussion in French art about the functions of art and its relation to the spectator and the creator at the same time. Although such ideas had an important impact on Matisse's thought and artistic production, they remained largely peripheral to his art. His creative process was driven by other principles and less by theoretical approaches. The two aspects are linked closely, but Matisse is more than a theoretician or painting philosopher, yet different from a philosophical artist. What comes out in 'Notes of a Painter' was his search for a pure, balanced and rather quiet art. He tried to find formulations for this in his paintings, as well as in his drawings, drypoints, linocuts, contributions to limes PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="17">NOTES 165 d'artiste and some monotypes. These were the subject of a recent exhibition at the Cabinet des Estampes in Geneva and its catalogue, Henri Matisse: Traits essentiels. Gravures et monotypes 1906-1952, by Christophe Cherix and Mayte Garcia Julliard (Geneva, Cabinet des Estampes, 14 September-17 December 2006, Geneva, Cabinet des Estampes, 2006, Walther Koenig, 152 pp., 45 col. and 6 b. &amp; w. ills., €25). In some of those techniques Matisse achieved great artis- tic liberty, often clarifying ideas that had been difficult to express in his paintings. The ideas that he had expressed in his short notes were a starting point for Christophe Cherix to examine the rarely shown monotypes in particular and to situate them in the wider context of Matisse's prints. For Matisse, it was not important to paint in a certain manner or to show or use certain elements, but rather, as Cherix points out, to confront the spectator with the artist's own views and to present his personal insights. It might seem strange to approach prints from the per- spective of some paintings, but if one takes into account that the paintings are better known and better researched and that for Matisse printmaking was easier than painting, then it makes sense. In a second section, nearly a whole chapter, Cherix gives some brief but stimulating introductions to the techniques, both in their chronological relationship to other parts of Matisse's work and their technical aspects. The eight paragraphs are not dry technical explanations, but offer a focussed view of Matisse's use of a particular technique as well as its situation in his wider œuvre. A list of the works and some biographical notes by Mayte Garcia Julliard complete the catalogue. This publication will not be the last word on Matisse as printmaker, for its selection was distinctively and deliberate- ly incomplete, but it nevertheless puts forward sound ideas to consider Matisse more as a creator of monotypes and as a printmaker. christian rümelin ALBERS AND MOHOLY-NAGY. At a first and too quick glance, Josef Albers and László Moholy-Nagy have little in common. Both had been at the Bauhaus for some time, but otherwise their artistic approaches and interests seem too distant to be linked. Fortunately, this superficial view was corrected in an exhibition and accompanying cat- alogue, Albers and Moholy-Nagy: from the Bauhaus to the New World , edited by Achim Borchardt-Hume (London, Tate Modern, 9 March-4 June 2006, Bielefeld, Kunsthalle, 25 June-i October 2006 and New York, Whitney Museum of American Art, 2 November 2006-21 January 2007, London, Tate Publishing, 2006, 190 pp., 164 col. and 39 b. &amp; w. ills., £24.99). Both artists started teaching at the Bauhaus in Weimar in 1923. Albers, after his initial training and work, joined the Bauhaus as a student in 1920. When he was appointed as a teacher, he not only knew the institution but also had expe- rience with stained glass, for which he was then responsible. Moholy-Nagy had no previous direct connection with the Bauhaus and came in as a kind of outsider, but with a re- putation already established. Over the next few years they followed their artistic interests in different ways. Each developed his own approach to teaching and tried to keep the Vorkurs (preliminary course) in particular attractive to students and in line with contemporary developments. However, Moholy-Nagy left the Bauhaus just a short time after Gropius had resigned as Director, while Albers stayed on until the closure of the Bauhaus and of its successor insti- tution in Berlin in 1933. Finally, both ended up in the United States, Albers direct from Germany in 1933, while Moholy- Nagy arrived in 1937 after some years in London. Although their career paths and artistic directions had been different, some common points can be made. One is their interest in photography. Other connections include their constant questioning of Abstract art and the explo- ration of its limits, both formally and technically; the impli- cations of the social reality during their lifetime and the function of art in the various societies they lived in. The six essays open up a wide field, ranging from graphic design, through teaching, to more practical approaches and the realization of their art. Printmaking is just a small part of it. Moholy-Nagy never made any prints, but his influence on book design and printmaking was important for later prac- titioners. Albers, on the other hand, made some prints, which are well embedded into his other works. The great achievement of this catalogue is not only to have juxtaposed two important figures of Modern Art, but also to have shown the complex, and sometimes still disturbing, relations between various art forms. Without certain developments in painting, drawing or stained glass, most of the prints by Albers would be more difficult to understand. Although this was not the main objective of the exhibition, it was clearly revealed. In addition to the many good observa- tions on objects, photography and the individual develop- ment of these two artists, this is the major achievement of this catalogue, christian rümelin PICASSO AND GRAPHIC DESIGN. One assumes that the prints of Picasso have long been definitively numbered and catalogued. Now, however, comes a book that compiles more than 350 prints of a new and astonishingly rich nature. Most of these cannot be found in any previous catalogues of Picasso's graphic œuvre. The explanation is simple: the cata- logues only include what the market calls 'original' prints, meaning that the printing block, plate or stone has been pre- pared by the artist himself. But this book, Für den Tag gedruckt: Picassos Gebrauchsgraphik by Katja Herlach (Zurich, Graphischen Sammlung der ETH, 26 April-30 June 2006, Zurich, Scheidegger &amp; Spiess, 2005, 312 pp., 146 col. and 76 b. &amp; w. ills., CHF78) deals with applied graphics or graphic design - Gebrauchsgraphik - a field where the question of the printing technique is of secondary importance. While the idea of 'original' or 'artist's graphic' rules out any repro- ductive or photographic processes and thus most modern printing techniques, the applied graphics place less weight on the printing process than on the artist's intention. Once a drawing or painting is made for a poster, a cover, an illus- tration, or any other kind of functional graphic, the printing technique itself might even be decided by another person. PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="18">1 66 NOTES In these cases, the involvement of the artist can vary. He or she might deliver a drawing to which the lettering is added by a graphic designer or by the printer, or he might draw the complete design, including the writing, in his own hand. The individual and often typical handwriting on graphic designs by artists - both painters or sculptors - has become a special feature that separates these works from those of professional graphic designers. Graphic design by artists does not, however, include the countless illustrations after drawings, paintings or sculptures that might serve any purpose, but are mere reproductions without any involve- ment of the artist. As early as 1902 Picasso delivered some illustrations for Paris journals, but it was not until 1916, when through his friend Cocteau he got involved with the Ballets Russes, that he also began to illustrate theatre programmes or to design covers for music sheets by Stravinsky and others. A more intense engagement in the field of graphic design started only after World War II. By then Picasso had become a truly popular artist, a synonym for modern art, having withstood the Nazi occupation in Paris, and he was asked from many sides to deliver a design in order to elevate an invitation, book, or poster with his name and his art. After the war he had moved to the Riviera village of Vallauris, where he was invited to experiment with pottery. In 1948 he was asked to design his first poster, which announced an exhibition of 'poteries, fleurs, parfums' at Vallauris. Typical of his immense creative impulse, Picasso wasn't satisfied with just one poster, but drew three different ver- sions for the same event. These first Picasso posters not only changed Vallauris into a tourist centre, but also marked the beginning of the modern artist poster. The Paris lithograph- er Mourlot helped to establish the habit of artists designing posters for their own exhibitions or for other occasions. Chagall, Matisse, Miró and other great artists of the early twentieth century followed Picasso and Mourlot in this. While in the 1950s the artist poster was mainly restricted to Paris, the 1960s saw the advent of Pop Art and the American artist poster. In the 1970s many institutions, especially in Europe, asked the artists they exhibited to design the show's poster. The artist poster became something of a fashion in the contemporary art scene. Artists like Miró, Rauschen- berg, Tàpies, Tinguely, and younger ones like Haring or Kippenberger, designed 100 or more posters. Picasso drew around 70, the number varying according to what is deemed to be an original design. Outstanding are his linocuts for the annual events in Vallauris and also his later lithograph posters, very freely drawn and written. His poster for the Communist peace movement, showing the famous peace dove in ever new variations, brought him international fame. The posters form the attractive core of Picasso's graphic design, followed by even more designs for book and cata- logue covers. If the title-pages he drew for magazines and journals are added, it becomes obvious that during the 1950s and early sixties Picasso was one of the the world's leading graphic designers, whose style and signature had become a renowned international brand. The Zurich catalogue surveys this interesting and often very diverse material. It is based on the collection of Bruno Margadant, a well-known Zurich poster collector, who start- ed his Picasso collection in 1949 when he came across the first peace poster by the artist. The collection claims to be com- plete, and it surprises with many unknown works and impresses with printing variants or editions in different lan- guages. The catalogue comprises two parts of equal weight: introductions and essays look deeper into Picasso and his 'Gebrauchsgraphik' as well as into the character of the collection. There is an interesting chapter on 'Picasso engagé' and on his designs for the Communist Party. In the narrower sense of the term, the catalogue section of the book delivers a chronological survey of the works in question, com- mented on with quotes and brief explanations. Its selection is informative and it is beautiful to browse through. Several appendixes - the most important being a complete list of the Margadant collection - complete this well-written book. Nevertheless, it would have been helpful to have been given more precise criteria about what is considered original graphic design by Picasso and what is merely reproduction, because examples of the latter seem to have been included on a few occasions. Also, the sole concentration on Picasso appears to be too restrictive. Sometimes one would have wished for information on how other artists dealt with graphic design - or on what it is that makes Picasso's work in this field so special, a question that can only be answered through comparison. But, as often when one deals with an artist like Picasso - a continent all to himself- the rest of the world is overshadowed. JÜRGEN DÖRING WARHOL. It can be difficult to write something new or revealing about some of the best-known and popular twen- tieth-century artists. Andy Warhol is such a case. Many pub- lications repeat well-known information or even reproduce the same works, without trying to see his œuvre from a new angle or aiming for new information, even if in minor details. Many publications and exhibitions please themselves in repeating the same beautiful and undisturbing paintings or prints, without questioning other parts of his œuvre. The occasions where new insights or angles are presented are revelatory, such as a recent exhibition catalogue, Andy Warhol/ Supernova: Stars, Deaths , and Disasters. 1962-1964, edited by Douglas Fogle (Minneapolis, Walker Art Center, 13 November 2005-26 February 2006; Chicago, Museum of Contemporary Art, 18 March-18 June 2006; Toronto, Art Gallery of Ontario, 8 July-22 October 2006; Minneapolis, Walker Art Center, 2005, 114 pp., 48 col. and 22 b. &amp; w. ills., $30)- The book deals with just three years in Warhol's life and some of the paintings or works that he created then. This concentration on specific topics and a limited period enables a clear view of a creative process at this crucial time in the artist's life. The works presented show the darker side of Warhol's artistic world. He places the human body in the centre of his interest, concentrating either on the stars - Marilyn Monroe, Liz Taylor and Elvis Presley among others - or on victims of car crashes, suicides or even the electric chair or the funeral of a gangster. What seems at first PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 200J, 2</page><page sequence="19">NOTES 167 glance superficiality is developed in the three essays into a clearly new approach to some of Warhol's work. It would not apply to everything, of course, but through examining these paintings it becomes obvious that there is a different layer to Warhol from the one usually presented. The relation of this show to printmaking is, as in many other works by Warhol, through the process of screenprinting on canvas. This technique enabled him to repeat the motifs several times on a single canvas, making the composition even more surreal than it would have been by simply blowing up the media images. It does not take much to link these paintings to printmaking, as they had been a starting point for certain developments in painting since the 1960s and show the beginnings of the use of newspaper images and their reuse in other media, christian rümelin TWO AMERICAN PRINTMAKERS. This Note covers three catalogues of the work of artists born in the 1930s. Beyond that, their work could hardly be more different. The older is Reba Stewart, born in 1930. Reba Stewart: A Legacy , by Genevieve McMillan and Donald C. Kelley (Boston, President's Gallery, Massachusetts College of Art, 9 October-20 November 2006, Boston, Massachusetts College of Art, 2006, 36 pp., 17 col. and 11 b. &amp; w. ills., free), is a 36-page illustrated pamphlet that accompanied an exhibition of her work in 2006. But it says little about Stewart's paint- ings, drawings and prints, because her art was overwhelmed by her life. The main article, by Helen LaFleur, is a recon- struction, through the reminiscences of her friends, of a woman who left home at thirteen after being abused by her father and lived a life that combined great fastidiousness of dress and taste with a wildness, love of shocking people and destructive anger, which make for compulsive and alarming reading. Stewart died in Puerto Rico in 1971 at the age of 41 from malaria that she had contracted in Africa, leaving behind strong lasting memories in everyone who knew her, and art that now seems of little interest. The other artist, Robert Kipniss born in 193 1, is a master of the techniques of printmaking. His work in mezzotint and lithography stems from a certain strain in 1930s American printmaking, where a precisionist approach to shape and tone is applied to everyday subject-matter in a way that pro- duces an effect of strangeness and mystery. He has been a prolific and popular printmaker since 1967, and there are already catalogues of parts of his output. The present exhi- bition catalogue (Daniel Piersol, Seen in Solitude : Robert Kipniss Prints from the James F. White Collection , New Orleans Museum of Art, 4 March-14 May 2006; Joel and Lila Harnett Museum of Art, University of Richmond Museums, 24 August-i October 2006; Florida, Orlando Museum of Art, 10 December 2006-11 February 2007; San Antonio, TX, 7 March-2 May 2007; Jackson, MS, Mississippi Museum of Art, January-April 2008; New Orleans, LA, New Orleans Art Museum, 2005, 118 pp., 44 col. and 41 b. &amp; w. ills., $30) accompanies a touring exhibition that is going to five American museums. It consists of an introductory essay by the lender, an essay by the author, a statement by the artist, plus a handsome selection of full-page plates, in colour when the originals are coloured. James F. White is a great promoter of Kipniss's work, and has donated groups of his prints to the British Museum and doubtless other institutions, antony Griffiths THE SOCIETY OF WOOD-ENGRAVERS. Given Monfalcone's long commitment to the exhibiting of wood- engravers, it is no surprise to find that the Galleria Comunale d'Arte Contemporanea has been the first Italian institution to host a show of the Society of Wood-Engravers. The town's most famous artist, Tranquillo Marangoni, became a member of the British Society in 1955, and anoth- er Italian member, Furio de Denaro, provided a short essay in the exhibition catalogue, Wood Engraving Today. Opere dalla Society of Wood Engravers (Monfalcone, Galleria Comunale ď Arte Contemporanea, 2005, 68 pp., 42 b. &amp; w. ills., €5). Also included are texts by Hilary Paynter and Simon Brett. The prints of Paynter, Brett and Geri Waddington are showcased and accompanied by brief biographies. Fifty-two other artists were included in the exhibition, their work being selected from 200 prints shown at the 67th Annual Exhibition of the Society. The healthy numbers of members and of subscribers to the Society's journal demonstrate the continuation of interest in the technique in Britain. However, much of the work remains tied to the traditions of the 1930s and 1940s. A single abstract print by Peter Lawrence is presented here, and only David Moyer's Manns valet speculum salvationis offers a notably different intellectual approach, martin hopkinson UMBERTO MASTROIANNI. To most Anglo-Saxons the surname Mastroianni evokes Marcello Mastroianni, one of the greatest of post-war Italian film stars. Students of sculpture, however, will undoubtedly be familiar with the work of his uncle, Umberto, now in his 97th year, which was recently the subject of an exhibition in Ascoli Piceno at the Palazzo dei Capitani del Popolo and the Scavi Archeologici. A catalogue, Umberto Mastroianni (Castel di Lama, Arte On, 2006, 192 pp., 277 col. ills., €20), written by Floriano De Santi, author of Mastroianni incisore (Urbino 1980) and of L'opera grafica di Mastroianni (Brescia 1991), a survey of Umberto 's prints between 1962 and 1990, accompanied the show. The exhibition was based on the collection of Vittorio Amadio and Marisa Marconi, which is the subject of De Santi's essay. The earliest work by Mastroianni that they have acquired is the poster for his 1961 exhibition at the Orti Sallustiani in Rome. Apart from this one lithograph, however, the rest of the prints in this show date between 1975 and 1995. Mastroianni's first print exhibition was held in 1962, when he had begun working with Grafica Romero. Later he col- laborated with Stamperia 2RC. His most important early livre d'artiste was Poeti sovietici , published in Rome by Editalia in 1964. His etchings also illustrated an edition of Vittorio Alfieri's autobiography for the Turin publisher Fògola in 1968, and Vento furente, a volume of his own poems, for Grafica Romero in 1972. Mastroianni's prints of this period have been studied by Claudia Terenzi in Le incisioni di PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="20">1 68 NOTES Umberto Mastroianni dal igÔ2 al igj2 (Rome, 1972). Bas-reliefs have long formed a significant part of Mastroianni's œuvre , and several of his incised sheets of lead, copper and brass resemble the matrices for intaglio prints, while his incised pieces of cardboard can be compared with blind prints. He made some blind prints with the suggestive title Sigilli arcaici in 1983. One of the earliest prints in this show is a drypoint taken from a lead plate. Mastroianni has a strong affinity with early Russian Abstract artists. De Santi relates his work to the stage designs of Vladimir Dmitriev, as well as to the work of Tatlin and Malevich. Indeed, in the 1980s the artist dedicated a series of 30 drawings to Mayakovsky. Mastroianni's intaglio prints of the late 1970s echo Balla and Kandinsky. Elements in many of his works are derived from machine parts. Among Italian artists he is closest to Luigi Spazzapan, a painter whom he met in Turin before World War II, and with whom he forged an alternative to the Classicism of the dominant figure of Casorati. Brilliant colours feature in many of Mastroianni's later prints, including two aquatints of 1980 and a 1987 screenprint, Cavaliere araldico , to which he made additions by hand, as he has done on a number of other occasions. In several works he has combined screen- printing with relief. In his series of Metamorfosi of 1989 he printed his screenprints on a copper support. Sometimes he seems to be paying tribute to Arp, another master of low relief, with his joyful colour as well as with his curvilinear forms. Often the figures and shapes in Mastroianni appear to be dancing. A series of circular screenprints of 1993 look like designs for ceramics. Their titles include those of two Aztec deities, a Nereid and the Hindu lord of justice. Mastroianni's interest in ancient literature, history and mythology is also reflected in the titles of most recent prints in this publication, the Homeric Eos ' dalle rosee dita! , Noreia , the as-yet-undiscovered capital of Noricum, and Enyo-ma , the goddess of the Turkish city of Comana Pontica. Could Lara refer to Lara Croft, the tomb raider? The style of these late lithographs suggests that he has retained an interest in Parisian art long after his first major one-man show at the Galerie de France in 1951. The Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris also staged an important exhibition of his work in 1976. Mastroianni's work can be seen in Rome in the Museo Mastroianni in San Salvatore in Lauro, and in the fif- teenth-century Castello di Ladislao, seat of the Mastroianni Foundation in Arpiño, martin hopkinson THE PREMIO DO FORNI. One hundred and ten years ago Italy's first public museum of modern art, the Galleria Internazionale d'Arte Moderna, opened in the Ca' Foscari, Venice. Five years later the museum moved to the Longhena-designed Ca' Pesaro on the Grand Canal. Under the enterprising directorship of Nino Barbantini, a series of annual exhibitions of Italian art were held there to comple- ment the Venice Biennali. High quality prints by rising tal- ents including Boccioni, Casorati and Arturo Martini were displayed prominently in these shows. An interest in print- making has been sustained in the Ca' Pesaro ever since. Twenty years ago it first hosted the Premio internazionale di grafica Do Forni. Its history was celebrated by an exhibition and the publication of Premio Do Forni ig86 (Venice, Centro Internazionale della Grafica di Venezia, 2006, 64 pp., 28 col. and 30 b. &amp; w. ills., €18) in which the winning prints are reproduced. Sadly, an opportunity was missed, as there is a dearth of accompanying information. Neither the tides, techniques or measurements of the works are revealed. More interest is displayed in photographs of the winners and prize-givers than in the art. It is not even explained that the prize was set up by a leading Venetian restaurant, the Trattoria Do Forni, and that the works of the winning artists find a place on its walls. One does learn, however, that the initial format was for ten Italian and ten foreign artists to be invited, from whom the jury chose an Italian and a foreign prizewinner. The first recipients were Giuseppe Zigaina and the Spaniard Miguel Rodriguez Acosta. Embarrassment soon arose over the inviting of distinguished artists, who were then not awarded the prize. It was therefore decided from 1 99 1 simply to allot prizes without the preliminary invi- tations. The Italians rewarded have included Riccardo Licata, Aligi Sassu, Ugo Nespolo, Enrico Baj and Sandro Chia. Among the foreign prizewinners have been Betrand Dorny, Eduardo Arroyo, Joe Tilson, Beverly Pepper and Igor Mitoraj. martin hopkinson RICHARD HAMILTON. In 2003 the Kunstmuseum, Winterthur, published the magnificent catalogue raisonné of all Hamilton's prints to date, together with the illuminating essay by Stephen Coppel on Hamilton's practically lifelong affair with the writing of James Joyce, and with essays by Hamilton himself that originally had elsewhere introduced aspects of his printed œuvre, including his more recent inves- tigations into the application of digital media. One might have thought after this that there would be little left to say on the subject of Hamilton and printmaking, but his own recent book, Richard Hamilton: Painting by Numbers (London, Alan Cristea Gallery, 24 May-24 June 2006, London, Edition Hansjörg Mayer, 58 pp., 64 col. and 2 b. &amp; w. ills., £12), simply testifies to the fact that Hamilton can be end- lessly engaging in speaking about his own engagement with technology. The Winterthur catalogue is beautifully com- piled and annotated - the result of Etienne Lullin's careful research, but also, evidently, of his many conversations with Hamilton, who is legendary for his openness and generosity to interviewer and curator. Nevertheless, when we open Painting by Numbers , which is an extremely modest volume compared with the publication from Winterthur, we see pages illustrated with the source materials and progressive stages towards the completion of this specially selected group of recent work. These are respectively: Just What is it that Makes Today's Homes so Different (1992); The Marriage (1998); The Heaventree of Stars (1998); Chiara and Chair (2004) and Annunciation (2005). The last two post-date the catalogue raisonné so are an added interest. Scanned, manipulated, cropped and layered, this material exemplifies the creative work included in Hamilton's most successful digital recipes. This detail is of the kind not visually documented in the catalogue raisonné , so it is a bonus to find it here. To help read- PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="21">NOTES 169 ers who may not be overly familiar with the processes involved - and I myself confess a perennial problem with the language of digital image manipulation - Hamilton gives a brief history of his involvement with digital media, contex- tualizing his current relationship with it. The account of his own journey, from Claude Shannon's 1949 A Mathematical Theory of Communication to the latest Epson printers, is in- formative without being overdone, followed by his own ac- cessible yet absorbing texts on the processes and progresses within each of these five prints. Although Hamilton increasingly in such essays (and sadly, given his age, there may not be many more of them) recycles material from his earlier commentaries (so something of what we see here also appears in the Winterthur catalogue and elsewhere), there is invariably something new. Here, for example, seems to be the first time he fully details in print (no pun intended!) the progressive stages of the 1993 Quantel Paintbox version of his 1956 original, Just What Is It That Makes Today's Homes so Different , So Appealing .... The text and illustrations on the process leading to Annunciation , cre- ated for a display in the Museum of San Marco, Florence, alongside Fra Angelico frescoes, and for The Marriage , where Van Eyck meets snap-happy Japanese, are also immensely satisfying.

ANTONY GRIFFITHS WOLF VOSTELL. Wolf Vostell is not only one of the founders of Fluxus, but also a prolific, politically highly crit- ical and visually innovative artist. Many of his happenings, sculptures, paintings or prints caused a general shaking of heads in his own time or, even worse, led to legal action against some of his plans. In this context, printmaking was a constant and important outiet for expressing his views. Although two lists cataloguing Vostell's prints have been published, a more complete overview was missing. Wolfgang Vomm has now edited a new catalogue raisonné to accompany an extensive exhibition ( Wolf Vostell: Die Druckgraphik , Bergisch Gladbach, Städtische Galerie Villa Zanders, 4 September-27 November 2005, Kunsthalle Bremen, 5 September-5 November 2006, and Malpartida, Museo Vostell, 2007; Bergisch Gladbach, Städtische Galerie Villa Zanders, 2005, 264 pp., 184 col. and 53 b. &amp; w. ills., €29). Vomm rightly points out that in 1971 Carl Vogel had pre- sented an initial catalogue in the context of René Block's groundbreaking book, Grafik des Kapitalistischen Realismus ('Printmaking of Capitalist Realism'). It was important, but only a first step. Vostell was still very active and produced many works, for example in the same year as this catalogue he made sixteen prints, of which only thirteen are men- tioned in Vogel's first list. The others were published by René Block in his additional list in 1976. These lists then had to be brought up to date by Françoise Woimant and Anne Moeglin-Delcroix in Nouvelles de l'Estampes in 1982, where they published the gift of prints that Vostell had made to the Bibliothèque Nationale that year. The various lists remained necessarily incomplete, however, and did not include the prints made after these respective publications. Further- more, they contained some inaccuracies, which took the per- ception of Vostell in a slighdy wrong direction. Consequently, Vomm had multiple aims for his catalogue. First, he wanted to correct both lists, and second, bring them up to 1997, when Vostell made his final print the year before he died in Berlin. Third, he wished to make distinctions between prints, multiples and paintings, where screens for prints had been used. This seems at first glance an unim- portant issue, but for someone who crossed media and reused working material from other techniques to express his views, it can become crucial. It is therefore far from just an academic exercise to establish a definition of what a print is for an artist like Vostell. For instance, in some cases he used screens to create unique works, sometimes on perspex. Vomm calls this a 'walking-tour of a screen' (Sieb- wanderung) to describe the practice of reusing parts of images that had been isolated from their original context. The process that Vomm used for unique works and for what he defined as prints often shows the same approach. In his works of the 1960s especially, Vostell used a combination and recombination of various images to achieve something entirely new. Often the sources did not seem to go together, but on closer examination they create a complex of mean- ings. In Vomm's catalogue it becomes obvious that in the prints this process was mastered to a high degree and result- ed in extremely dense images. But the screens as a technical instrument and as part of the content are not the defining element of the prints. Every screen is at the same time one layer of the reality, and as such can be reused in a new con- text. These reflections lead Vomm to find a suitable defini- tion of a print for Vostell. In the end, only if an edition was produced or at least intended, did Vomm include it in his catalogue. This could either mean a print in a more con- ventional sense, or a work documenting something else, such as a happening or a sculpture (Dokumentationsgrafik), or even a combination of multiple and print on a sheet, where the object was less important than the print (Objektgrafik). A third approach of Vostell's was to reify newsprint images with his signature and therefore to assign them the status of a print (Zeitungsgrafik). Beside these more unconventional methods, from 1980 onwards in particular he used litho- graphy, heliogravure, drypoint and aquatint to formulate ideas that were often not sourced in a photo. All other works are, righdy, excluded from this catalogue. That some of the elements reappear in the other works, however, is a fascinat- ing phenomenon and shows how quickly and successfully Vostell adopted strategies from Pop Art to create sometimes highly political images. Yet the definition is not of interest on its own. The aim of undertaking it was to get a clearer idea of what printmaking meant to Vostell and an understanding of the various techniques he used. The discussion on this fol- lows the definition, sometimes including links to the sources or examining the relevance of prints in the context of other media. Vomm's excellent remarks build a basis for further discus- sion of these prints, both in a political context as well as from PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="22">170 NOTES an individual artistic perspective. Some of these works need to be seen in the wider cultural situation of West Germany between the late 1960s and the mid-1990s, including Fluxus and other art forms that were then avant-garde. But the ground is now well prepared, christian rümelin FRANZ GERTSCH. To the wider public, Franz Gertsch is probably better known as a printmaker than as a painter. That his two artistic interests are closely linked is a well- established fact, at least in specialist circles. How close these relations are became obvious in a large retrospective that 84.

Gertsch abandoned Abstract art in 1969 and devoted him- self entirely to a figurative approach. It was a process that included various steps, as Samuel Vitali points out in his essay on Gertsch before 1969. It was an important part of his development, in particular because Gertsch agreed to a catalogue raisonné of his paintings after that date. These more figurative and realistic paintings not only mark a large differ- ence from his previous work, but show Gertsch's interest as personal and distinct from others, such as the Socialist Realism or Photo-Realism known from artists like Richard Estes, Richard Cottingham or Gerhard Richter, to name a few contemporaries. Their rôle and situation in the discus- sion on Realism in the early 1970s is examined in detail by Peter J. Schneemann. This stage in Gertsch's development was not restricted to paintings, however, but included some years later the development of the large woodcuts. Harald Kunde links the paintings and these prints closely together in his small but brilliant essay. In the beginning, the prints had been dependent on the experience of similar paintings, but over the years this relation changed and became more recip- rocal. The much tighter view and the concentration on detail found its parallel in Gertsch's portraits of young women, although this had its roots in some portraits of the late 1960s and early 1970s, as well as in the landscapes. In most of his printed portraits the radical change is less apparent than in the landscapes, where the shift from a more general view- point to much closer detail becomes obvious. Not only are the landscapes a technical link between the paintings and the prints, they also represent a formal, different relationship between his printed and his painted work. At the same time the format increased in some cases, making the stunning effect and Gertsch's artistic approach even more revealing (figs. 84 and 85). The publication was not intended to be a catalogue raisonné of the prints or to concentrate solely on them, as was done in other exhibitions a few years ago, but to show the close connections between these often very large wood- cuts and the paintings, christian rümelin GONZALO PARAMO. The Burgos-born artist Gonzalo Páramo is one of Spain's most promising younger artists. Trained as a biologist before he studied fine art at the Facultad de Bellas Artes de Salamanca, he has a formidable knowledge of the insect world. He was raised in Palencia and throughout his life has been very familiar with the mountains of Spain. Páramo's deep fascination with nature has led him to be an avid reader of scientific literature, so he was a natural choice for an exhibition at CITIES Art, the gallery of the Fundación Metrópoli, which aims to 'promote artists devoted to humanist and multidisciplinary training who defy artistic classification'. The exhibition was accom- panied by the catalogue, gonzalo páramo Babel (Madrid, Fundación Metrópoli, 2006, 40 pp., 32 col. pls., €20), with essays by Simón Puerta García and Alfonso de la Torre. As a young man, Páramo was given the freedom to browse at will in a private library that contained mediaeval manuscripts and incunabula. His art reveals his fascination with the materials, calligraphy and palimpsests that he dis- covered in the documents he perused. Parchment is one of Páramo's favoured supports, and he also uses it for the cre- ation of objects. A high proportion of his work is on paper. His abstract paintings also draw on his close study of lichens, rocks and tree stumps, while he has created sculptures of invented animals and insects, which have their source in insects, skeletons, skins and reptiles. Páramo's scientific research was extended by a period in 2000-01 investigating the treasures of the Zoology Department of the Hunterian Museum, University of Glasgow, and a six-month Wellcome Trust residency in 2002, which enabled him to make good use of the Wellcome Library. He was able to consult its notable collection of works devoted to alchemy. Like Mario Merz, Páramo has found inspiration in the Fibonacci sequence, the series of numbers that have been shown to be frequently found in the natural world. De la Torre finds par- allels in his work with that of Pablo Palazuelo and Manolo Millares. He compares Páramo's passion for repetition with Michaux and refers to the mid- 1930s writings of Breton, the photographs of Brassai, Man Ray, Cartier Bresson and Raoul Ubac as similar in their research. Ubac could be seen as a forerunner for Páramo's use of embossed prints in the series Core in this exhibition. A print- making residency at Glasgow School of Art brought him into contact with the tradition established there by Philip Reeves. Páramo's use of cut-up blocks of board echoes the practice of the Glasgow-based Englishman, who often prints from found industrial objects. The shapes in Core , however, although resembling pieces of industrial machinery, were cut out from cardboard sheets. Furthermore, in Páramo's case the modern is combined with the mediaeval, as the plates enclose a sample of his palimpsests of calligraphy. In addi- tion, he builds up his finished prints by gluing thin layers of paper to the base surface in a method similar to chine collé. For some of his works, in particular his most recent prints, he has taken to sewing the layers together (fig. 86). In earlier work Páramo made soft-ground etchings using snake skins and other natural objects. His practice is to print his matri- ces without a press, exerting pressure by means of a board covered with cloth, martin hopkinson THE BROWNS COLLECTION. Freda and Irwin Browns have offered to leave their print collection to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, and a handsome catalogue has been published to accompany a celebratory exhibition {Impressions of Humanity ' the Freda and Irwin Browns Collection of Master Prints , Montreal, Musée des Beaux- Arts, 17 January-22 April 2007, Montreal, Musée des Beaux-Arts, PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="25">NOTES 173 86.

The genre of the museum catalogue that celebrates a gift is one of the most frequently noted in these pages, since no muse- um can fail to thank a donor in this way. But the interest of such catalogues beyond the walls of the fortunate institution is not always apparent, and much depends on what the col- lection contains. In this case, the collection is interesting because it is very personal, and not built up to tick off the familiar works that now constitute a canon of printmaking for museums. There is indeed a core of works of this kind, built around Rembrandt and Picasso. And for this reason there are three essays in the catalogue, two by the Chief Curator, Hilliard T. Goldfarb, on Rembrandt, and one by the Director, Nathalie Bondil, on Picasso. The rest of the works in the gift are listed and illustrated, but we are told very little about them. Freda and Irwin Browns are interested in the human fig- ure, and with hardly any exceptions all the prints are figura- tive and many are of women (they have tried to collect one of each of Picasso's wives and mistresses). This has led them far from the canon. We find Edmund Blampied and Cecil Buller, as well as Eric Desmazières, a strange print by Moise Kisling and some recent illustrated books by Canadian artists. The preface, written by Irwin Browns, says that the prints are all small so that they can be hung on the walls at home, and often cluster into groups that make small stories. There are, for example, some nice Fauve woodcuts and a clutch of portraits of Whisder by various artists - just the sort of thing that looks well when hung together, and the effect of which is often lost when distributed through the boxes of a museum. The preface contains numerous tips for fellow col- lectors, and Irwin Browns clearly hopes that others will fol- low him. He and his wife have built up a collection for their own enjoyment, and now want to pass it on (and it does appear that everything they own is here) so that others can share their pleasure, antony Griffiths DOLE'S PRINT COLLECTION. De Dürer à Warhol, edited by Anne Dary (Dole, Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dole et Association des amis des musées du Jura, 2006, 72 pp., 32 col. ills., €7), draws attention to the print collections of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dole and the Musée des Beaux- Arts de Lons-le-Saunier.

M. Munier-Pollet, the Mayor of Dole between 1943 and 1947, gave his local museum a group of engraved portraits of prominent figures in the history of Franche-Comté. The collection of this Museum was gready enhanced by two deposits made by the Fonds National d'Art Contemporain in the 1960s and then of about 100 twentieth- century prints in 1990. The second deposit consisted of a group of 61 works devoted to the theme of the French Revolution, which had been commissioned from contempo- rary artists by the French state. In addition, the Museum has been actively collecting prints and multiples as part of its policy to represent figurative art of the 1960s and 1970s. A number of earlier prints of uncertain provenance that had not been previously inventoried have also been unearthed, enabling the museums to mount an exhibition of 170 prints. By great good fortune, the nature of the holdings has enabled Dary to organize a show and a publication illustrat- ing most of the major printmaking techniques. Entries on individual works were written by Bénédicte Gaulard, Syvie de Vesvrotte, Catherine Scheck, Samuel Monier and the editor herself. The collection of late seventeenth- and eigh- teenth-century French engravings includes Les Batailles d'Alexandre after Le Brun. Etching is represented by Rembrandt, Piranesi and Cézanne. Among more recent prints are Kienholz 's 1970 screenprint, The Portable War Memorial and works by Adami, Buraglio, Dezeuse, Fromanger, Kabakov, Kruger, Spoerri and Serra, martin HOPKINSON THE KENNETH TYLER COLLECTION IN CANBERRA. Initiated in 1973 by the acquisition from Ken Tyler of 311 printer's proofs, the National Art Gallery of Australia's Ken Tyler collection, which has been built up over a period of 30 years, ranks very high among archives of contemporary prints to be found anywhere in the world. The Canberra Gallery now owns over 7,000 auditioned prints, screens, paperworks, illustrated books and multiples, together with rare or unique proofs and drawings. The col- lection is supplemented by about 60 hours of film and sound recordings, as well as by some 60,000 photographs. The National Gallery of Australia has recently established a web- site, http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Prints/Tyler/ to make this remarkable resource more widely available. The site includes a brief scholarly history of the acquisition of the Kenneth Tyler collection and a biography of Kenneth Tyler, both written by Jane Kinsman. Also to be found are down- loadable brochures and introductions to exhibition cata- logues featuring works from the Archive, the most recent being Welcome to the Water Planet. Paperworks by James Rosenquist (2006), Against the Grain . The Woodcuts of Helen Frankenthaler (2005), afterimage: Screenprints of Andy Warhol , and Printed Light , an exploration of photography and printmaking (both 2003). The heart of the site, however, is the catalogue of the prints in the collection, which is still being augmented as gallery staff continue the process of research and documen- tation. The work of 79 artists is represented. The aim is that each print should be illustrated and accompanied by full cat- alogue details and exhibition history. At the moment, 160 prints by Helen Frankenthaler are recorded, the most by any artist. Also very well recorded are the works of John Walker, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, Stephen Sorman, Robert Motherwell and Roy Lichtenstein. By no means are all the printmakers famous names. Here one finds 61 works by the New York sculptor John Newman and 34 by the Norwegian Per Inge Bjorlo. The catalogue extends to multi- ples by artists such as John Chamberlain and Anthony Caro. Many of its entries include biographies, a feature that will doubtless eventually be extended to all. A very valuable sec- tion of the site is an extensive glossary of terms associated with printmaking that appears in the individual catalogue entries, martin hopkinson VISIONS DU DÉLUGE. The Musée Magnin at Dijon (11 October 2006-10 January 2007) and the Musée Cantonal des Beaux-Arts in Lausanne (2 February-29 April 2007) have collaborated on an ambitious exhibition that brings together 98 paintings, drawings and a few prints on the Flood. The accompanying catalogue, Visions du Déluge de la Renaissance au XIXe siècle (Paris, Réunion des Musées Nationaux, 2006, 128 pp., 84 col. and 12 b. &amp; w. ills., €29) gives a jolly anthology of scenes of disaster over five cen- turies. The organizers, Rémi Cariei and Sylvie Wuhrmann, have allowed themselves the indulgence of pursuing their theme into assorted earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and there are four big essays that treat different aspects of the subject and illustrate a number of key works not includ- ed in the show. It has to be confessed that there is something slightly absurd in seeing such a large number of specimens of hero- ic men and women all glowing in the peak of physical per- fection, usually entirely nude, or at least almost entirely nude, wrestling with tidal waves while holding up healthy babies. This is hardly the picture of catastrophe that we have become all too accustomed to seeing in photographs and on television. But the subject does allow for a selection of unusual and unfamiliar works. The print historian will rec- ognize some old favourites by Vellert, John Martin and Doré. But it is odd that the catalogue does not commit itself to deciding whether the famous two-sheet woodcut (cat. no. 7) is by Jan van Scorel or Titian. Surely no one for many years has thought that this has anything to do with Titian. ANTONY GRIFFITHS PICTURES WITHIN PICTURES. The excellent series of exhibitions of prints at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest has been continued with another show and accompanying catalogue, Pictures within Pictures: the Artist and the Public over Five Centuries of Graphic Art from Burgkmair to Picasso , by Gonda Zsuzsa (Budapest, Szépmüvészeti Múzeum, i December 2005-27 March 2006, Budapest, Szépmüvészeti Múzeum, 2006, 188 pp., 22 col. and 78 b. &amp; w. ills.). The catalogue offers an interesting essay in both Hungarian and English that illustrates 100 of the 170 works in the exhibition. The approach taken to the theme is wide- ranging. We are led from the stories in antiquity of Zeuxis and Apelles, and the Christian legend of St Luke painting PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIV, 2OO7, 2</page><page sequence="27">NOTES 175 the Virgin, through Renaissance personifications and allegories of the arts, to depictions of artists at work in studios and exhibitions, and the reaction of the public. This makes for a very sprightly display, and the riches of the Budapest collection (from which all but a few of the works shown are drawn), ensure that a considerable number of the works reproduced are far from familiar. The essay is thorough and subtle, and anyone interested in this theme will find much to enjoy and learn in these pages, antony GRIFFITHS FEUILLE A FEUILLE. Under the umbrella of the Association des Conservateurs des Musées du Nord-Pas de Calais, a dozen northern French museums have linked schedules to present a series of exhibitions on the theme of the printed image ('Feuille à Feuille', October 2006-June 2007, see www.musenor.com for programme). Against this background - and in conjunction with the university - a three-day seminar was held at the Palais des Beaux-Arts, Lille, entitled 'L'estampe, un art multiple à la portée de tous?' (25-27 January 2007). The international ambitions of the colloque were borne out by the range of speakers from Belgium, Holland Switzerland, Italy, the USA and all parts of France. Papers were given in French and English, although British scholars were not represented. One of the speakers, Barthélemy Jobert from the Sorbonne, gave a paper on 'Politiques de mise en valeur des cabinets d'estampes de la Bibliothèque nationale de France et du British Museum'. In it he suggest- ed that the British Museum, thanks to its dedicated galleries outside the Students Room, was far more successful than its counterpart in Paris in setting prints before the public gaze. Discussions benefited from interventions by Gwendolyne Denhaene, Norbert Gramaccini and Maxime Préaud, among many others. Proceedings were wound up by Michel Melot, former Director of the Département des estampes, BnF, who spoke for the auditorium when he voiced concerns as to how to raise the profile of the print - status, access and display - especially in regional museum collections. The proceedings are due to be published by Lille University in 2008. CAROL BLACKETT-ORD LUIGI MAJNO (igigP-2007). The current issue of Nouvelles de l'Estampe contains a long adieu in the form of a history of the Gazette des Beaux- Arts, founded by Charles Blanc in 1859, which closed in 2002. It was written by Luigi Majno, a book dealer in Milan, who formed a phenomenal personal library on prints and the history of printmaking. The Gazette was famous for the fine etched and engraved plates that it published throughout the nineteenth century (see the catalogue by Pierre Sanchez and Pierre Seydoux, Les Estampes de la Gazette des Beaux-Arts 1859-1933, Paris 1998), and it was this that led Luigi to value it so highly. It was the rupture with tradition and the loss that he felt that led him to take such trouble to write his essay. Luigi was descended from a line of the engaged and com- mitted Milanese elite. His father was the Socialist mayor of Milan, and Luigi himself had the highest standards of integrity. He would never let pass anything of which he dis- approved. He once sent me a small gift for the British Museum in the form of a cheque made out in euros. I had to return it to him because the charges made by our bank to cash it would have been more than it was worth. He at once wrote to the chairman of the European Central Bank to complain about the matter, and copied me the long reply that he was sent. His letters in newspapers such as the Corriere della Sera attacking the Berlusconi government with precise and irrefutable detail were much admired by his readers and much hated by politicians. Luigi was a great character, who died after a stroke that struck him very shortly before he was due to fly to London for the opening of the British Museum exhibition of 'Italian Prints 1875 to I975'« He had played a large part in helping us form this collection, and gave us a number of works as out- right gifts. He felt that it was important for Italy that London should be able to show the achievements of modern Italian art as well as earlier Italian art, and he believed that the cat- alogue Martin Hopkinson was writing would be important for its wider understanding across Europe. Others will have known him far better than me and will be able to say much more about him, but in the same way as he felt impelled to write an obituary of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts , I wish to do so for him.
