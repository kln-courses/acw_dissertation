<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND STUDIES THE MEANING OF ΕΠΑΚΟΥΩ AND COGNATES IN THE LXX At the meeting of the International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies at Gottingen in August 1977, Mr. C. Cox read a short paper about the rather frequent variation between ε'πακουω and εισακούω in the Greek Psalter, a variation very prominent where the Hebrew is ענה 'answer'. A typical example is Ps. iii. 5: φωνφωνφωνή μου προς κΰριον ΐκΐκραξα και έ7τηκουσίν [ΐίσήκουσάν Α] μου (ζ όρους άγιου αύτοΰ. In almost all cases of ענה in the Psalms (about thirty-four are relevant), these verbs are used, and among these about eight have εισακούω in all manuscripts, about sixteen have ε'πακουω in all manuscripts, and about ten vary between the two verbs. The paper discussed the textual evi dence well but did not touch upon the semantic question, which the present writer raised in the discussion afterwards: what is the meaning of έπακουω and its cognates in this context and why is it used so fre quently to render ענה ? The purpose of this note is to suggest that, though one would expect ε'πακουω and cognates to mean 'hear', in the LXX it often meant 'answer'. Of course, the context often allows either of these senses in Greek, as at iii. 5 cited above: 'thou hast heard my prayer' comes very close to 'thou hast answered my prayer'. Nevertheless, there are certain places where the sense 'hear' is hardly possible and the meaning in Greek must be taken to have been 'answer'. x. The most certain case is Dan. vi. 21-2 LXX. The king 'called upon Daniel with a loud voice, saying. ..' (ε'κάλεσε τον Δανιήλ φωνή μεγάλτ).. . λέγων).λέγων). Then follows (verse 22): τότε Δανιήλ όπήκουσί φωνή μεγάλη και ειπεί׳ειπεί׳. . . The Aramaic is somewhat different: it uses the verb מלל and not ענה. I submit, however, that the Greek can only have meant 'then Daniel answered with a loud voice and said . . .'. The example is strong precisely because the Greek is not following the original too slavishly: the rendering is a slightly free one of the familiar מלל, literally 'speak'; since ענה is not present, one cannot explain as stereotyped rendering of this verb with ε'πακουω (though it is true that it occurs in the previous sentence). The rendering with έπακουω seems to be a natural element in the Greek of the translator, and its sense must be 'answer'.</page><page sequence="2">68 NOTES AND STUDIES This is not the only example; there are others which, though not so clear at first sight and when taken alone, fall quickly into place once the clear instance of Dan. vi. 22 has been observed. For example: 2. Gen. xxx. 33 וענתה־בי צךל!תי /cat (πακούσεταί μοι ή δικαιοσύνη μου It is difficult to take the Greek otherwise than as 'my righteousness will answer (for?) me'; note the construction with the dative. LSJ rightly notes this instance, but it is entirely isolated in the entry, and the reader might easily suppose that that dictionary, confronted with an odd Greek meaning, has simply offered the meaning of the Hebrew, as under such circumstances it often does, as if that was a proper account of the sense in Greek. There is in fact much more LXX evidence, and the usage can hardly be explained away as a freakish phenomenon derived from Hebraizing literalism: rather, it is a real development of meaning on the Greek side. 3. Gen. xxxv. 3 לאל הענה אתי ~ τω θ(ψ τω e7τακονσαντί μοι Though 'the God who heard me' would give good sense, 'the God who answered me' makes equally good, or better, sense. 4. ι Kings xviii. 24 האלהים א^ר־יענה בא?2ז ο Oeos, δς ΐάν ϊπακούση ev πνρί *The God who will answer in fire'—which is in any case the Hebrew meaning—is much more likely than ,the God who will hear in fire'. The idiom continues in verses 26, 36, 37; the same idiom is found, of David, in ι Chron. xxi. 26. These passages clearly specify not the mere hearing of prayer but the response to prayer in tangible form. 5. The same is the case in Sir. xlvi. 5. Joshua called upon the Almighty, and ויענהו אל עליון באמי [אלגביש] και και ιπήκουσιν αύτοΰ μιγάς κύριος eV λίθοις χαλάζης i.e. 'he answered him in (or with) hailstones'. The sense 'hear' is impossible. NEB renders with 'answered his prayer'. 6. Hos. ii. 23 f. Hosea appears to say (in Hebrew) that '1 will answer' the heavens and they will 'answer' the earth; the earth will 'answer' the corn, etc., and these elements will 'answer' Jezreel (all verbs ענה, and in Greek eVaκούω, all followed by dative or accusative). It is not</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND STUDIES 69 easy to say what impression this strange passage would make upon a Greek reader who knew nothing of the Hebrew. 'Hear' is hardly a a possible sense. 7. Other LXX passages include 1 Sam. vii. 9, viii. 18, xxviii. 15; Qoh. x. 19; Zech. x. 6, xiii. 9; also 2 Sam. xxi. 14 καϊ επήκουσεν ό θεός ττ) γτ) where the Hebrew verb is "רעתי: the sense is not that God 'heard' the land but that he 'answered (prayer)' for the land. Many or most of these have the dative. Thus the LXX has a good number of passages which support the sense 'answer', and in some this sense is almost certain. Looking at the matter from another side, it is not easy to suppose that the common verb ענה (over 300 times in the O.T.) caused difficulty to translators. If they rendered it with e'7τακούω, the most economical explanation is that this word in their Greek meant, or could mean, 'answer'. To understand this fully we have to consider the development of the group of compounds of ακούω in Greek. There are, perhaps, four main semantic regions covered by these terms: (1) 'hear'; (2) 'hearken to, heed, pay regard to'; (3) 'obey'; (4) 'answer'. Only with υπακούω, per haps, do we find all of these in general usage, and with it the first is already less prominent; the commonest sense is 'obey'. The develop ment into 'respond' or 'answer' (no. 2 developing into no. 4) is not unnatural, and for υπακούω it is well known, being registered as far back as Homer: 'answer (by voice or act) when called', says LSJ, and so also, in a dialogue, 'answer when questioned'. If in LXX Greek Ιπακούω came to have similar meanings, it was only following along a path which υπακούω υπακούω had taken long before. The distribution of the relevant terms is interesting. The familiar αποκρίνομαι,αποκρίνομαι, though common as rendering for ענה in the other books, is almost completely absent from the Psalms: there are only lxxxviii (lxxxvii). ι and cii (ci). 24—in both of which paradoxically the actual Hebrew word is not that meaning 'answer'—and cxix (cxviii). 42, which is a human answering of reprovers. Again, though υπακούω has a fair representation as rendering of שמע (mainly in the historical books and Jeremiah) and a few cases rendering ענה (mainly Isaiah and Job), it occurs only once in the Psalms and that in the sense 'obey' (שמע niphal: xviii (xvii). 45). Thus the main terms are our ίπακούω and Εισακούω. The latter was used not only to render ענה but also to render שמע 'hear', which often appears in the same context. In rendering שמע, the Psalter divides be tween ακούω and €1σακούω (about thirty-five times each). The choice between them seems generally influenced by the context. Εισακούω is</page><page sequence="4">7&lt;נ NOTES AND STUDIES found almost only of God's hearing of prayer (the two exceptions are: Iviii (lvii). 6, of a snake which does not hear the charmer; cvi (cv). 25, of a people which does not hear the voice of the Lord). By contrast, ακούω ακούω ακούω is used mainly for 'general' hearing (ears that hear, voices that are heard, etc.): it has God as subject only seven times and of these only four count as the hearing of prayer. Thus the dominant tendency of the Psalter can be set out thus: ענה שמע I I Hebrew meaning 'hear' 'answer' | | of God answering prayer not of God of God hearing hearing prayer prayer J, I , ακούω εισακούω εισακούω or εττακούω In some other books επακούω was used also to render שמע, e.g. six firm instances in Genesis, but in the Psalter this was not so: only one exception exists, at cxlv (cxliv). 19 (atxviii (xvii). 45 andxxii (xxi). 25 read ύττηκουσενύττηκουσεν and είσηκονσεν). Outside the Psalter, ΐΐσακοΰω found com paratively little use in rendering ענה: only a handful of examples, e.g. a few in Job, Proverbs, Micah, Jonah, and two in Isaiah, and some of these textually uncertain. In the Psalter then the real overlap was between επακούω and εισακούω, with textual variation between the two and with the latter spanning two different Hebrew verbs. Since ענה and שמע often occurred close to gether and referred to the divine hearing/answering of prayer, the occasion for textual confusion was great and is evident from the apparatus criticus. Where επακούω had been written, scribes altered it into εισακούω, and vice versa. It would be temptingly simple to suppose that επακούω was originally used in all places where the Hebrew Psalms had ענה, while ακούω and είσακούω shared the rendering of שמע; but no doubt that would be too neat a solution. More likely the Psalms transla tion did not keep the renderings of ענה and שמע strictly apart, and used εισακούω εισακούω for both. Once the material was in Greek and was read as Greek, the link connecting επακούω with its Hebrew basis in ענה and therefore with its unusual meaning 'answer' must have become extremely slender: all cases in the Psalter could be read as meaning 'hear', and replacement by another compound of ακούω was not felt to be difficult. The complete domination of the Latin Psalter by exaudio, and the almost complete absence of respondeo, even in the version iuxta</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND STUDIES 71 Hebraeos,Hebraeos, shows that even St. Jerome, who could control the sense of the Hebrew, followed this easy assessment of the meanings. It will readily occur to the reader that this might be a case of that much-disputed phenomenon, the supposed anti-anthropomorphism of the Greek version: for the Psalms, see especially A. Soffer in Hebrew Union Union College Annual, xxviii (1957), pp. 85-107, who, however, does not mention this particular example. One might suppose that the translators, unwilling to accept that God 'answered' prayer as in the Hebrew, said that he 'heard' it. But we have already seen that this is not so: ΐττακονω actually meant 'answer' and was in that sense, in the Psalms and some other parts of the LXX, a literal rendition which made no difference to the anthropomorphism of the passages. The translators were not, in using επακοΰω, seeking to avoid the impression that prayer was 'answered' by God. Nevertheless the preference for επακοΰω may well have been con ditioned by the sense that this was a fitting term for the answering of God.God. It was a common term for the reception of prayer by the gods; it implies a deity who not only hears prayer but responds, does something about it. The adjective επήκοος was particularly well known in this connection. It is found twice in the Greek of Chronicles (2 Chron. vi. 40; vii. 15, MT קן#יב in both). The use of επακοΰω was probably favoured through this familiar Hellenistic usage. The relative disfavour of αποκρίνομαι may be part of the same preference. It was a simple semantic split: the appropriate word for divine answering was taken to be επακοΰω, while the common word for human answering, αποκρίνομαι, was avoided in this context. (Not all books make this split: Jeremiah, for instance, uses αποκρίνομαι with God as subject, and does not have επακοΰω).επακοΰω). But, if the use of επακοΰω had its origin in the divine answering, once it was established it was sometimes extended, as in our Daniel example, to include human answering also, and even the answering of moral qualities, cosmic elements, and so on, as well (examples 2 and 6 above). A similar picture is presented by non-LXX translations. Aquila, for instance, uses επακοΰω for ענה six times in the Psalms and once in Job (xix. 7); he also has it once where the Hebrew is שמע (Ps. lxii (lxi). 12). He has είσακονω thrice for ענה and thrice for שמע. This and other evidence suggests that he took 'answer' to be a meaning of επακοΰω and probably of είσακοΰω too. From the papyri we may quote P. Mich. 103. 15 (Zenon Papyri, p. 177)־ ΎΡ'ίφ* δί και σν πρός με . . . d)S εμοΰ ή8εως επακουσομενον with the sense 'meet the wishes of', and Syll. 672. 4 (c. 161 B.C.), where Atta lus II, having received a request from Delphi, επακονσας προθ[υ]μως τά</page><page sequence="6">72 NOTES AND STUDIES άξιοΰμενα,άξιοΰμενα, i.e. 'responding willingly to the request', sent them lots of money. I am indebted to Dr. C. H. Roberts and Dr. D. M. Lewis respectively for these examples. Josephus (Ant. x. 259), rewriting our Daniel passage, also used 6767τακονω: τον Be επακοΰσαντος τω βασιλεΐ και μηΒεν παθεΐν Απόντος. According to Niese's apparatus, Ibbetson suggested the emendation 157157τακονσαντος, but this should surely be rejected, since Josephus was merely following the wording of Daniel LXX. Elsewhere his use of e7e7τακονω conforms to general Greek practice. For a later instance, Lampe's Patristic Greek Lexicon gives the sense 'say in response to' for a passage from the Acts of John (Lipsius and Bonnet, Acta Apostolorum Apocrypha, ii. 1, p. 197, 16): ελεγεν■ τό Α μην επακονετεεπακονετε μοι . . . και ήμεΐς κνκλενοντες επηκοΰομεν αντω τό Αμην 'He said: say the Amen in response to me. So he began to sing a hymn and say, Glory to thee, Father. And we surrounding (him) made to him the response Amen'. The one place where e77ακούω occurs in the N.T., 2 Cor. vi. 2 καιρώ Βεκτω όπηκονσά σον, is also a case in point, since the Hebrew was ענה: Isa. xlix. 8 3עת ךצון ענייניך. The original certainly meant '1 answered you'. It is hard to tell whether the apostle understood only the more normal Greek sense 'heard, heeded' or the sense of the original Hebrew. As for είσακούω in the N.T., most contexts would allow either the 'hearing' or the 'answering' of prayer; but if Luke i. 13 is modelled upon Dan. x. 12, this had שמע 'hear' in the original, and in the absence of other indication it is wise to take all cases as 'hear', which is in any case, as we have seen, the dominant sense of this compound in the LXX. Kittel in the T.W.N.T. article (German edition, i. 223; English, i. 222) suggests that the infrequency of επακονω in the N.T. is clear evidence of resistance against the θεοί επηκοοι of environing antiquity. 'Sie kann kaum anders erklart werden als aus dem unwillkiirlichen Bedurfnis der Abgrenzung gegen jene θεοί επηκοοι der synkretisti schen Volksreligion.' A pleasant speculation; but, as we have seen, it was probably this very Hellenistic usage that provided the basis for the LXX usage, whereby επακονω became familiar in places where the Hebrew had ענה 'answer'. I am grateful to Dr. S. P. Brock and the other colleagues mentioned above for discussion and advice. James Barr</page></plain_text>
