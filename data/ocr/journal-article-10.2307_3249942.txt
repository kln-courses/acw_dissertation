<plain_text><page sequence="1">PADMA KAIMAL THE PROBLEM OF PORTRAITURE IN SOUTH INDIA, CIRCA 970-1000 A.D. n my earlier study, "The Problem of Portraiture in South India, circa 870-970 A.D.," I discussed particular qualities that characterize portraiture in the Tamil region from the reign of the early Cola kings.' I maintained that, contrary to assumptions by some scholars that portraiture was alien to Indic conceptions of the individual, these Tamil relief carvings meet easily a semiotic definition of portraiture, demonstrating that portraiture was indigenous to this and likely other regions of South Asia. Their function as portraits was, moreover, tied closely to their cultural context: the format of these portraits has much in common with memorial stones from the same region, and their expres- sive content shares deeply in the Hindu devotionalism expressed in contemporary Tamil poetry. In their locations on the exterior walls of small Hindu temples across the Kaveri delta, the Tamil por- traits perpetuated the pious generosity enacted by the individuals they represented, welcoming vis- itors to the temple and exemplifying worship for them through their placement and devotional pos- tures. These portraits share the general sculptural style of other figures on the same temple, but their smaller scale, shallower relief, and more casual framing distinguish them from representations of the deities. Inscriptions beside these portraits and elsewhere on the temples identify the sponsors of temple construction through their affiliations to localities (ndtu). These localities had been the primary authorities over economic, political and legal matters in the Kaveri region since before the rise of the Cola dynasty in the later ninth century. Powerful people, those with the authority and resources to build temples and to have their portraits inscribed on the temples' walls, appear to have derived their status from their leadership positions within these localities. Members of the royal C61ola family, and Cola kings in particular, were as yet only marginally involved in the sponsorship of temple con- struction, nor is there any evidence of their representation in portraiture before circa 970. I have pro- posed therefore that the art produced during the tenth century be labelled geographically, as a "Ka-veri style," rather than dynastically. A clear shift in the manner of temple patronage and the manner of portraiture occurred around the year 970 with the beginning of the ambitious building program by Cola queen Sembiyan Mahadevi (or Cempiyan Matevi). I mark that shift by classifying 870-970 as Phase I of the Kaveri * Many thanks to the American Institute for Indian Studies for sponsoring my research on this project in India.

The new patterns of Phase 2 portraiture form the focus of the present essay. As I have argued elsewhere, Sembiyan Mahadevi's sponsorship of at least eleven small temples around the Kaveri region constituted the first serious involvement of the C61la family (fig. I) in tem- ple construction.2 In this she preceded and perhaps inspired Rajaraja I Cola (reigned 985-o1014), the first Cola king to invest heavily in temple building as a form of royal rhetoric. Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples appropriated several features from the temples that locality leaders had been funding over the preceding century: their small scale (two small rooms with a low superstructure), their place- ment in the localities rather than in royal capitals, and their basic vocabulary of architectural forms. Whereas the locality temples of Phase I displayed a wide range of iconographic programs, ground- plans and basement-molding combinations, however, Sembiyan Mahadevi's temple designers selected from that range a narrow set of solutions, giving her temples a novel consistency of form. Figure 2 demonstrates that narrowing of options for groundplan design from Phase I to Phase 2. Her temples' iconographic programs also introduced extra niches into the entry porch (ardhamandapa), bringing the total to three niches on each of the two exterior walls. One of the most significant deities to occupy these niches was Siva Natarija, the lord of dance, who is depicted with one leg raised across his hips and with the fire and drum balanced in his hands. I understand his presence on Sembiyan Mah-devi's temples as an emblem of the Cola family deliberately deployed into the localities.3 Sembiyan Mahadevi's patronage appears to have played a strong a role in reshaping portraiture too. Inscriptions beside Phase 2 portraits often emphasize the subject's affiliation with the Cola fam- ily rather than with a locality. The temples of Phase 2, many of which were funded by this Cola queen, introduce two documented portrait types that depart in significant ways from portraiture of Phase I. I will refer to these as Konerira-japuram type I and Konerira-japuram type 2. These persist through- out the period of her active patronage on four of her other temples as well as on a temple apparently sponsored by a non-royal patron. Konerirajapuram type I recurs at Kuhur (where it is documented as a portrait by an inscription) and Aduturai; Kone-rir-japuram type 2 appears at Analngur and Kut- talam. A third type of image that occurs at Konerir-japuram, Anafig r, Kuttalam and Aduturai may also signify portraiture, but as none of these instances is yet documented by published inscriptions I have not formalized this category with a type name. In Konerirajapuram type 2, portraiture of royalty finally appears in the Ka-veri region (fig. 3). The portrait format changes subtly to accommodate the royal subject, although these kings are not pre- sented in anything like the life-sized scale and sculptural complexity of the royal portraits of the Pallavas. Royal portraits largely conform to the mode of portraiture, by now well-entrenched, that had been employed for local citizens during Phase I. Nor does that local mode cease with the intro- duction of royal portraiture. In Konerirajapuram type I (fig. 4), portraiture of non-Cola locality lead- ers persists, again with some alterations, into the second phase. One of these leaders, a Sattan Gunabat- tan (Cattan Kunapattan) appears to have been absorbed into a Cola system of temple patronage, but z "Early C61ola Kings and Early C61ola Temples: Art and the Evolution of Kingship," Artibus Asiae 56, nos.

An encircling frame separates portraits of Phase I from the surrounding wall and from other sculp- tures (fig. 5). This sets them in a fictive space they share with a lingapitha. Portraits of Phase 2 stand free of such frames and those of Konerirajapuram type I are instead incorporated into one of the large niches that house sculptures of the gods (devakostha) carved almost fully in relief (fig. 6). The later portraits thus appear to interact directly with the large, anthropomorphic figures beside them instead of with a lifigapitha. Those deeply carved images of the gods pose frontally, inviting worship from those who visit the temple, and they appear to emerge from the inner spaces of their darkened niches with a vividness and tangibility that also link them to the world a viewer occupies. The portraits' deeper relief projects them too into the viewer's physical world with a new immediacy, and no frame isolates them within a separate pictorial space. These factors bridge the worlds of the portrait, the divine image and the viewer more closely than portraits of Phase I do. What follows is a site-by-site survey of the temples that display Phase 2 portraits. This is a culled list of the most convincing and representative examples I have yet encountered. Each type is based upon at least one inscribed example to which I then compare reliefs that bear compelling visual sim- ilarities. Figure 7 also summarizes those examples in tabular form. The portraits below all appear to be contemporary with the original construction of the temple they adorn. Construction dates for these temples are less speculative than those of the Phase I temples because many of these temples bear inscriptions that refer directly to temple construction and that mention dates as well as a named patron's responsibility for construction (using the Tamil word etuppitu). Konerir-japuram On the Umamahesvara temple at Konerirdjapuram are two inscribed portraits, the archetypes for my categories of Konerir-japuram type I and Koneriraijapuram type 2 (figs. 3-4).4 Both formats are char- acterized by very deep relief carving and an absence of framing devices.5 The portrait of Konerira- japuram type I probably represents a local leader involved in the temple's construction as a liaison for the royal patron. Konerir-japuram type 2 portrays two Cola kings, the earliest inscribed portrait of Cola royalty I have located. Thus royal portraiture appears to have begun in this region when Sem- biyan Mahadevi began to build temples: the Umamaheivara is the earliest of the temples inscribed as the products of her patronage. Inscriptions beside the Konerirajapuram portraits identify the subjects of the portraits. These inscriptions also state specifically that the Umamaheivara was completed within the first three years 4 The temple also bears other images that are likely to be portraits, but these seem to be later images. On the west side of the free-standing Candikeivara shrine is a panel of a standing man and a seated priest before a iliga; on the north wall of a later mandapa a miniature male figure stands before a tiny relief of Siva Nataraja. 5 Thus I would confirm Sanford's observation of deepening relief in portraits carved in the second half of the Ioth cen- tury.

The image that establishes Konerirajapuram type I has the fol- lowing inscription running above and beside it.6 Hail! Prosperity! Udaiyabirattiyar, who conceived in her sacred womb Uttama Cola also known as Sri Madurantakadevar, built [this] sacred stone temple. Haracaranasekharan, also known as Sattan Gunabattan, landowner in the town of Alatt-r who is [this image] is [also] he who was honored with the title "Rajakesari Muvendavela-r".

The language of the inscription reveals that the portrait was perceived not as a reflection or repro- duction of the subject's appearance, but as the subject himself. S-ttan Gunabattan's name is simply juxtaposed with the word ivar meaning "this is he". The inscription contains no separate word for "portrait" or "image". That is, subject and image seem to have been considered congruent. Empha- sizing the association between the image and the inscription, ivar is used twice in the inscription, once in the emphatic position of last word in the sentence. Sattan Gunabattan's portrait, which is approximately twenty-five centimeters tall, stands in three-quarter profile. Devout but restrained, this figure clasps his hands in front of his chest, his left knee slightly flexed, his body relaxed. His face, chest, hips and feet all point in the same direction, at roughly forty-five degrees from the plane of the temple wall. This is an almost fully three-dimen- sional figure emerging illusionistically and convincingly from the rock matrix. His pose is free of the torsion that characterizes Phase I portraits, but it creates the same impression: that the figure simul- taneously addresses the niched deity and the observing visitor, and that it deflects the visitor's atten- tion toward the niche. His glance appears to fall half-way between the deity and an observer passing in front of the portrait (fig. 6). His simple clothing most closely resembles the dress of the male portraits from Phase I at Tiru- vaduturai. He wears a small loincloth wrapped around his waist and between his legs, and a short string of beads across the chest (perhaps the rudrdksa seeds of the Saiva devotee). An armlet encircles each upper arm. His hair is pulled back tightly over his head and tied into a full knot behind his right ear. Individuation in Sattan Gunabattan's portrait is subtle. The body is evenly proportioned and not very distinctive, resembling this temple's Bhiksatana image (fig. 8) in the modest fold of flesh above the waist, the trim and solid lines of the legs, and the subtle rendering of the knees. Both the por- trait and the divine niched image (devakostha) have wide heads that are very short in the chin. Sattan Gunabattan's shoulders, however, do not reveal the exaggerated fullness of Bhiksatana's, and his dehanchement is perhaps stiffer than the god's. Sattan Gunabattan's lips are thinner.

Sattan Gunabattan's portrait maintains a few other features of Phase I portraits as well. The image appears on the south wall of the ardhamandapa where it could serve to receive visitors as they begin circumambulating the temple (fig. 9). The standing posture, simple clothing, and location low on the temple wall - at the level of Natardja's feet - imply humility in the presence of divinity. In other respects, Sattan Gunabattan's portrait departs from Phase I patterns. The portrait is now more tightly integrated into the presentation ofadevakostha niche, part of the intensifying sculptural focus on such niches that characterizes Phase 2 temple design. Flanking the base of these niches, such portraits and equally small narrative figures serve to draw attention to the devakostha they frame, often setting a reverent example for the temple visitor. The prototype for Konerir-japuram type 2 adorns the south wall of the Umamaheivara's vimdna (figs. 9, Io), just west of Daksinamurti's devakostha niche. This was also a location for portraits at Tiruva-duturai in Phase I. This is an unframed composition of a large, seated figure, three smaller figures and a lingapZtha. An inscription running beneath this group states:7 Hail! Prosperity! Sri Sembiyan Madeviyar also known as Madevadigalar, the queen of Gandar-dittadevar, constructed a sacred stone temple to the lord of Tirunallam [i.e., Siva] in the name of her husband, Sri Gandar-dittadevar, while her son Sri Uttama Cola, Sri Maduran- takadevar, was ruling and graciously commanding. On this stone temple, in the posture of wor- shipping the sacred feet of the lord of Tirunallam, [an image of] Sri Gandarddittadevar was made. This is he.

Again, this text includes no Tamil word for "image" or "portrait", and the equivalence of the por- trait and its human subject is expressed by the use of ivar after the king's name, at the end of the inscription: "... Gandar-ditya. This is he." The sculpture's purpose is not to present his appearance or personality; the portrait was understood to be him, fully present. I take the central character in the inscription, Gandaraditya, to be represented by the second figure from the right, the largest and clearly most prominent of the four figures in the relief panel. Although seated, this figure is taller (33 centimeters tall) than the images around him. He occupies the center of the panel, his head the highest point in the relief. His chest is draped with four neck- lace strands, and he wears three bangles on each wrist. His hair is tied into a large chignon high on the back of his head and ornamented with strands of flowers or jewelry. A broad band wraps above his forehead, along the hairline. 7 SII 3, #I46, 295-96; ARSIE for I9go8-o9, #450 of I908, 49. 143</page><page sequence="6">The broad shoulders and flat chest of this image indicate that this is not a portrait of Sembiyan Mahadevi as some have suggested.8 Costume also suggests a male subject, given the evidence of Phase I. The short kilt that falls across the thigh of the K6nerirajapuram figure resembles the garment worn by Anantaiivan at Tiruviialur (fig. 5) rather than the long skirts of the female images at Cakrappalli and Tiruvaduturai. Assuming that the visual text of the portrait group is meant to parallel the verbal text of the inscription below, we can read aspects of the inscription as further evidence that the central figure of the panel was meant to represent Gandaraditya. Most obviously, the text states that Gandaraditya is the object of the entire monument's dedication. His image would logically have precedence, then, at this site. Also his is unquestionably the dominant name in the written passage adjacent to the por- trait carving. It opens and closes the Tamil text, superceding the names of both his wife and son. Sembiyan Mahadevi's name is introduced after his name and in the context of her subordinate rela- tionship to him. The portrait does not represent the patron, then, and the patron apparently remains unrepresented at this temple and at other temples attributed to her.9 This portrait represents one whom the dedi- cation of the temple was intended to benefit rather than the benefactor herself, a departure from the practices reflected in portrait inscriptions at Tiruvilal-r and Tiruvaduturai. Even the presence of a king's portrait on a Kaveri temple does not signify, moreover, that Cl61a kings were as yet directly responsible for the temple construction. This disjunction between temple patron and portrait subject does have precendents, however, among earlier royal portraits I have discussed in Part One. At the Adivaraha cave in Mamallapuram and the Vaikuntha Perumal temple in Kafici, royal patrons have included portraits of their ancestors quite prominently.1o In these Pallava monuments and in the royal portrait at Kon-rirajapuram, por- traits act as sculptural equivalents of the verbal genealogies given in inscriptions: they declare the royal legitimacy of the donor by confirming that donor's links to previous rulers of well-established authority. This Konerir-japuram portrait could have functioned in a similar way, substantiating Sembiyan Mahddevi's status as queen through her connection to the old king Gandardditya, as well as to her son, the reigning king. Gandaraditya's portrait perpetuates several features of Phase I K-averi portraits (fig. 3). He twists so that his legs and hips face the lingaptha while his chest and shoulders face the viewer. With his hands in aIjali mudrd7, he worships a miniature ligap.tha which is set within the imaginary space of the portrait relief. Like those early images, this panel appears to float in an empty expanse of wall. His gesture may also have read as being directed toward the Daksinamurti figure in the niche beyond 8 Sethuraman and Sanford read this image as Sembiyan Mahadevi, though they do not consider the evidence of the costume. See N. Sethuraman, Early Cholas: Mathematics Reconstructs the Chronology (Kumbakonam: the author, 1980), 40-41; and Sanford, "A Comparative Study," 181. 9 Venkataraman considers an image at the temple in the village of Sembiyan Mahadevi a portrait of that queen. B. Venkataraman, Temple Art under the Chola Queens (Faridabad: Thomson Press [India] Limited, 1976), Izo. That image, however, was carved considerably after her death and well after the tenth century.

Io) now separates the royal portrait from Daksinamurti. Gandataditya's portrait differs from all three other portrait types I have described in ways that I suspect were directly related to the royalty of this subject. First, he sits in the presence of Siva's ligapitha implying that his status is elevated above the others who stand, a more self-effacing pos- ture. He brings to mind the seated portrait of Simhavisnu II in the Adivaraha cave at Mamallapu- ram, the serene patriarch of a dynasty, confident in the presence of deities. And yet the Konerirta- japuram piece is not constrained within Pallava prototypes for royal portraiture. Gandataditya does turn to the lihgapitha and gesture respectfully toward it. He sits cross-legged near the ground, not on the raised throne of the Pallava king. His profuse ornaments reinforce the impression that this was a man whose exhalted station in life was directly relevant to his interactions with the divine. This beautification of the body suggests the intimacy of his divine associations and the perfection of his kingdom. His face is essentially identi- cal to those of the other figures in the panel, with long eyes, a broad and flat nose, full lips, puffy cheeks, and a rounded jaw." There is a doughy quality to the rendering of all four figures in this panel,'" and Gandaraditya's heavy jaw may hint at a substantial presence, but his broad shoulders enhance the impression of physical power. Whereas physical oddities often constructed non-royal portraits' relationship to the viewer and to the divine, power and ornament appear to have performed that function for portraits of the early Colas.13 Three male figures appear with Gandaraditya in this panel. On the far left a second seated image probably represents the other Cola king mentioned in the adjacent inscription, that "Sri Uttama Cola [who] was ruling and graciously commanding." His short kilt and heavy shoulders suggest the sub- ject's male gender as they compare more closely with those of Gandar-aditya and male figures at ear- lier temples than with female portraits at Cakrappalli and Tiruvaduturai.14 His seated posture in the presence of the lihgapptha, which echoes Gandartaditya's posture in every detail but the hands, sug- gests his royal status. He also resembles Gandar-aditya in the arrangement of his hair, a large knot tied behind the right ear. 11 Compare Joachim Bautze's similar findings in Kota paintings: "Portraitmalerei unter Maharao Ram Singh von Kota," Artibus Asiae 49, nos. 3/4 (1988-89), 316-50o. 12 Schwindler remarks on these figures' "dwarflike proportions" - often called "folkish" in contradistinction to the "met- ropolitan" elegance of bronze Natarajas - noting that their use in royal images reveals the inadequacy of the terms "folkish" and "metropolitan" to describe ancient Indian modes of art production: Gary Schwindler, "Mirror of class: Indian sculpture surveyed," Craft International 5 (1986), 17-18. 13 In that I find peculiar features present in non-royal portraits and idealization in royal portraits, my findings rein- force those of B.N. Goswamy, "Essence and appearance: some notes on Indian portraiture," in Facets of Indian Art, ed. Robert Skelton (London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1986), 196, 2oo-ol. It is interesting to note that this pat- tern was in operation before the Mughals. 14 Balasubrahmanyam has interpreted this image as a portrait of Sembiyan Maha-devi. S. R. Balasubrahmanyam, Early Chola Temples (New Delhi: Orient Longman, 1971), 172. The same conjecture is made by Hultzsch in SII 3,295. In his description Barrett omits this image, describing only the other three figures in the panel. Douglas Barrett, Early Cola Architecture and Sculpture (London: Faber and Faber Limited, 1974), 90. 145</page><page sequence="8">Although this figure is smaller than Gandartaditya's portrait (twenty-nine centimeters high), he displays two signs of royal status that Gandaraditya does not: an umbrella hovering above his head and a short staff, probably the danda of royal authority, in his left hand. The danda, which was also prominent in the royal iconography of the Pallava king Nandivarman II Pallavamalla at Vaikuntha Perumal temple, was the emblematic weapon of the king on the battlefield and the symbol of the king's power to coerce within the royal court.'s As signs of active rule, the umbrella and the danda are likely to characterize Uttama C61ola since he was ruling at the time this temple was built, Gandar~iditya having either died or chosen to retire into spiritual contemplation.I6 The second figure from the left appears to attend on Gandaraditya. His subordinate status is sug- gested by his standing posture, by his diminutive size (at twenty-three centimeters high his stand- ing figure is shorter than Gandaraditya's seated figure), and by the caurfover his right shoulder which is frequently an emblem of servitude in Indian art. He wears a simple loincloth, no ornaments, and his hair seems to be cropped close to his head. His proportions almost suggest caricature, with stunted legs and enlarged feet. The fourth figure of the panel is also small (twenty-eight centimeters high) and similarly subor- dinated to the two kings through scale and posture but less servile than the caurf-bearer in his ges- tures. He stands at the right edge of the relief arranging a garland over the lihgapffha and standing on the low platform that runs beneath the li gapitha. This gesture, his proximity to the ligappitha, and the sacred thread (yaj;opavita) hanging from his left shoulder suggest that this figure represents a priest.17 His hair appears to be cut short and his dress is extremely simple. A shallow ledge runs beneath these four figures as a sculptural ground-line, uniting them into a single composition. No other framing devices set them off. Carved in such deep relief that they are almost free-standing, these vivid images demand the viewer's attention as they emerge into that extra-mural space. The panel is set high into the temple wall, at or above a viewer's eye-level. This elevation puts a new interpretation on the devotional portrait. The kings' portrait hovers seated at the level of Daksinamuirti's head or shoulders.

I46</page><page sequence="9">That construction of the Umamaheivara (fig. II) was funded by Sembiyan Mahadevi and that it was dedicated to Gandaraditya are established with some assurance by the two inscriptions quoted above and in a third inscription that runs along the south, east and north walls of the vimdna.18 The construction date is limited to 971-78 by this long inscription from Uttama Cola's seventh year that discusses maintenance funding for the completed stone temple, and by the inscription beneath Gandaraditya's portrait which places the temple's construction within the years of that king's reign. Barrett narrows the construction date to Uttama's first three years (971-74) on the basis of a refer- ence to the dedication of a flower garden in the third year of his reign.'9 Presumably, the garden was added after architectural work had been completed. These inscriptions establish the Umamahesvara as the earliest known temple to have been built by Sembiyan Mahadevi. A few features of the temple's design hint at the experimental, but one's over- whelming impression of this monument is one of assertive grandeur. The niched devakostha figures are taller, carved more forcefully in relief and more subtly detailed than those of her other temples (figs. 6, 8, 12-13). Most of the standard features that distinguish temples constructed under her patronage are present here, although some of these features have been obscured by a later structure that now encases the original building. The Umamaheivara follows the basic two-room plan of early Kaverl temples, now with the indentation Barrett terms a "false antardla" between the vimdna and ardhamandapa (figs. IO, 14). The exterior walls of the ardhamandapa each contain three fully-framed and evenly spaced devakostha niches (fig. 15) for the six deities most commonly found on Phase 2 tem- ples. Ganela and Durga still dominate the walls they often occupied alone on Phase I temples, Ganesa in the central niche of the south ardhamandapa wall (fig. 12) and Durga in the central niche on the north. Ganela is flanked by Agastya (fig. 13) to the left and Nataraja to the right (fig. 6). Durga is flanked by Bhiksatana (fig. 8) to the left and Ardhanari (fig. 16) to the right. Brahma is on the north side of the vimdna, and Daksinam rti (now replaced by a later image) is on the south side, as they are on almost every Kaveri temple to Siva. There is a firmness and tension to the surfaces of these figures that distinguishes them from sculpture of the first phase. Diminutive narrative figures tend to be numerous on temples of Phase 2. These figures stand out- side the lower edges of devakostha niches as do portraits of Konerir-ajapuram type I, but their associ- ation with the niched deities derives from myth. For example, female figures disrobing appear beside Bhiksa-tana as allusions to Bhiksatana's seductive presence in the Myth of the Pine Forest. Like the added devakosthas on the ardhamandapa, these extra figures outside the niches participate in the trend apparent in this region over the course of the tenth and eleventh century toward an increasingly pop- ulated surface on exterior temple walls. At Konerirajapuram, figures flanking the niches are espe- cially prominent and large. Perhaps the sculptural program had not yet settled into the more stratified hierarchy of images that would be present on this queen's later temples.

Many are almost half the height of the devakosthas themselves (figs. 6, 16- I7), and they are particularly volumetric. Repeated lustrations of oil have further enhanced their visibility. One unusual feature of the Umamaheivara that seems deliberate rather than experimental is the building's orientation. Whereas most temples of the region open to the east, this temple opens to the west. Liigodbhava, who on Phase 2 temples routinely appears on the west wall, appears on the east wall at Konerirajapuram (fig. 17). Interestingly, all the other devakosthas retain the directional ori- entations they take up on east-facing temples, suggesting that the temple was meant to be circum- ambulated in a counter-clockwise direction, keeping the building on one's left - the reverse of stan- dard procedure. Only by proceeding in that direction can worshippers begin their experience of the temple with Gane"a, the lord who removes obstacles to new undertakings, and conclude circumam- bulation with Durga whose triumph over the buffalo demon mirrors the devotee's spiritual triumph in moksa, "release" or "enlightenment" that experiencing the temple may produce."? The portraits too retain their usual place on the south walls of the temple. If this was the first wall encountered during devotions, one function of these portraits would still have been to introduce vis- itors to the structure. But these portraits face away from a viewer approaching from the west or front of the temple. Perhaps the vimadna exercises a higher claim over the sculpted devotee's attention than temple visitors do. Empathy may also have been among the designers' goals. By facing westward, both the portrait of Sattan Gunabattan and the royal portrait group encourage the visitor's progress around the temple. Approaching from behind, viewers receive a sense of coming upon someone in the midst of his prayers and perhaps even of sharing in this man's worship. Particularly in the case of Sattan Gunabattan's portrait which stands, as viewers must, viewers are invited to share in his regard of the next devakostha. Devangana Desai's work at Khajuraho suggests one motivation for orienting the Umamahesvara westward. Desai finds that sculptural programs in Khajuraho could deliberately encourage counter- clockwise circumambulation in "heretical" situations such as worship of the mother goddesses. - It is possible that the Konerirajapuram temple carried unorthodox associations of its own. The Uma-mahesvara may have functioned as apal.ipatai or memorial temple to Gandaraditya, which could have violated the Agama texts' injunction against building over burial sites.2 This reading of the temple only works if Gandaraditya was in fact deceased by the date of the Umamaheivara's con- struction, a point that remains in question. 3 The presence of the king's portrait, the inscription beneath explaining that Sembiyan Mahadevi "constructed [this] sacred stone temple... in the name of her husband, Sri Gandarlidittadevar," and the temple's westward orientation taken together do zo On the spiritual progress outlined in such a program, see Susan L.

Furthermore, a reference to Gandar-aditya as "the king who went to the west"'4 may signify that direction as the locus of death, and therefore as an appropriate direction for pa.lipa.tai to face. Political geography may also have played a part in determining the Umamaheivara's orientation. Dennis Hudson suggests that the Vaikuntha Perumal temple in Kanfici opens to the west in order to facilitate contact between its god (Visnu) and the Pallava king whose palace opened to the east and faced the temple (across some distance).s As Konerirajapuram does lie to the east of the C61ola capi- tals at Tafijavur, Uraiy-r and Palaiyarai, its west-facing entrance could be understood to open the temple to communication with those geographical sources of Cola authority. That political agenda did not permeate all of Sembiyan Mahadevi's patronage, as most of them face east, but the Umamahe- svara would have been a particular focus for such meanings if it was dedicated to Gandaraditya and if it was the first temple this queen commissioned. Another noteworthy aspect of the Umamaheivara's iconographic program is its Nataraja devakostha. Douglas Barrett's research indicates that Nataraja enters the iconographic program as a full-sized devakostha only with Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples. Before that point Nataraja is repre- sented in stone as a minor figure, carved in shallow relief in small roundels atop a few devakos.tha niches.26 I have previously raised the possibly that Nataraja's image became an emblem of the Cola family as early as 945 at Tiruvaduturai. That Natara-ja's image played that sort of political role by the last quarter of the tenth century is strongly implied by the elevation of this image to the status of a devakostha image with the beginning of Sembiyan Mahadevi's building program. The presence of this new god, adopted by the C6las rather recently as their family deity (kuladevatd), articulated the temples' association with the C6las and publicized the C6las' prestigious association with the god of an ancient shrine. At the Umamaheivara, Nataraja still appears to have been a rather novel element of the icono- graphic program. Whereas on later Sembiyan Mahadevi temples Nataraja dominates the south ardh- amandapa wall from its central niche, at Konerirajapuram that central niche still houses Ganesa. Nataraja appears in the niche on Ganefa's left, where he would be seen after Gane'a during circum- ambulation. The placement of S-ttan Gunabattan's figure beside this Nataraja, where he offers his respects in the direction of that devakostha, further draws the viewer's attention to Nataraja and suggests his importance to the temple program. This arrangement also raises questions about Sattan Gunabat- tan's relationship to the Colas and his role in the construction of the UmamaheSvara. His special atten- tions to a god affiliated with the Cola family could indicate his intimacy with them, perhaps as their agent in the somewhat remote area of Konerirajapuram. Also, the inscription notes that this man received the title "Rajakelari Muvendavelar" which Stein understands to mean a member of the dom- 24 ARSIE of 1920, #540 of 1920: Sastri, Colas, 152, note 45. 25 Dennis Hudson, "Kanchipuram," in Temple Towns of Tamil Nadu, ed.

If S-ttan Gunabattan was involved in construction in any capacity, this could imply that the expertise in designing such buildings and the mechanisms for erecting them still operated at the local level, even as financial resources shifted to the Cola capital. A compromise between royal and local modes is also evident in the terms through which the inscription identifies S-ttan Gunabattan: he is at once the recipient of a Cola title and an important figure in his locality ("landowner in the town of Alattur"). His multiple roles imply an environment of transition, perhaps accommodation, and certainly change.3o Whatever Sattan Gunabattan's role, he probably would have played it locally. Sembiyan Mah-devi would have paid the bills, and the reigning king, Uttama Cola may have been connected with the project only through "fund-raising" - the looting expeditions he conducted. It is interest- ing, and hardly surprising, that the word order of the Tamil inscription mentions these three people in just the reverse of the order I have, with Uttama Cola first and Sattan Gunabattan last. Their sta- tus in the inscription may have been inversely proportional to his or her degree of involvement in the process of construction. Konerir-japuram thus demonstrates the beginning of new patterns in portraiture, iconography and patronage. The two portraits types represented here are characterized by deep relief and the absence of enclosing frames. Konerir-japuram type I represents an extension of some Phase I patterns of portraiture, depicting a locality resident as he offers worship. The features may be individualized. Kone-rira-japuram type 2 departs more radically from earlier patterns, and seems directly related to the royal family's increasing involvement in the construction of temples. Projecting the king's stately presence, the royal image is depicted in hieratic scale, seated, attended by several subordinates and 27 Stein, Peasant State, 113. 28 Hultzsch suggests that this title may have been a reward for Sattan Gunabattan's work on the queen's project, per- haps as a local supervisor or agent for the queen: SII 3, 297. Barrett too understands Sdttan Gunabattan as an "officer of works." Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, 91. Dehejia suggests his role was as architect: Vidya Dehejia, "Patron, Artist and Temple, An Introduction," Marg 39, no. 2 (1988), 2-8. 29 Hultzsch and Dehejia read Sattan Gunabattan as subject of this verb: E. Hultzsch, SII 3, 296-97; Dehejia, "Patron, Artist and Temple," 8. But the queen's name precedes the verb whereas Sattan Gunabattan's name follows the verb. My thanks to Professor Norman Cutler of the Department of South Asian Civilizations, University of Chicago, for his advice on the translation of this inscription. 3o On the inscriptional evidence for such local authority and the shift away from it at the end of the tenth century, see James Heitzman, "State formation in south India, 850-1280," Indian Economic andSocial History Review 24, no.

His physical appearance includes signs of his status, but physiog- nomic peculiarities were apparently not necessary or appropriate to this portrait type. Ana~igur On the Agastye'vara temple at Ana-figur is a relief of a small group of figures that resembles closely the Konerirajapuram portrait group ofGandardditya and his attendants, Konerirajapuram type 2 (fig. 18). The Anafigur relief is almost a mirror image of the Konerir-japuram panel in its format and com- position, and it too is placed rather high upon the temple wall. These similarities suggest that the largest figure in the Anafig r panel may also be a portrait, and perhaps a portrait ofa Cola king. 3 No inscription is now visible on the fabric of the adjacent wall to confirm that identification. An inscrip- tion on this temple does demonstrate that the Agastyesvara temple was, like the Umamahesvara at Kone-rir-japuram, funded by the Cola queen Sembiyan Mahadevi, and it seems likely that the mean- ing of such a significant, dedicatory image would remain consistent among her projects. The Ana-figur relief consists of three figures: a substantial male (approximately nineteen cen- timeters high) who sits as he worships a lifgapptha, and two diminutive attendants who stand behind him. In a slight variation from the Konerir-japuram panel, this panel has no priest and instead of a second seated king there is a second standing attendant. At the left edge of the panel is a small, squat li~dgaptha under the low arch ofa shallowly carved flower garland. The composition has been reversed right to left, probably to accommodate the eastern orientation of Agastyesvara temple. At Anagfigur too, the portrait faces the temple vimdna (fig. 19). The seated figure at Anarig r is essentially identical to the portrait of Gandaraditya at Kone-rira- japuram. He sits upon a low cushion, his legs crossed and his hands in a-jali mudrd at his chest. His face turns toward the li gapqtha while his torso twists toward the viewer. He wears a heavy necklace that falls just below the collarbone. His hair is tied into a large knot over one ear and ornamented with strands of jewelry or flowers. His shoulders are broad and his face displays no obvious idiosyn- cracies. His wide, round head, long eyebrows and puffy lower lip resemble the features of the Natara-ja devakostha image just beneath him (fig. 2o). Several factors suggest that this figure too was intended to represent the Cola king Gandaraditya. Like that king's portrait at Konerira-japuram, this figure sits and wears jewelry and hair ornaments while worshipping the lifga, features that appear at Konerira-japuram to be signs of royal status. Another such sign, a caurt bearer dressed in the simple costume of the K-nerirajapuram attendant, stands in attendance at the right end of the composition. Of the kings whom Sembiyan Mahadevi might have had portrayed on temples she sponsored, her husband and son seem the most likely can- didates. The second attendant in the Anarigur panel, also standing and also simply dressed, holds a long object over his left shoulder, possibly a sword or dada'a. That the attendant rather than the king holds these emblems of kingly rule may characterize the seated king as Gandaraditya, the king who put aside the royal authority such staffs connoted. Contrast this to the portrait of the reigning Uttama Cola at Kanerirajapuram, who holds his own dandaa prominently. P The portrait panel appears in one of Barrett's photographs of this site, although to my knowledge the images have not been previously discussed. See Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, pl. 51. 151</page><page sequence="14">The three figures and the lingapitha are carved in the same deep relief as the figures of the Konerira-japuram panel, and they float unframed upon the surface of the wall. The Anar gur panel is located very high on the wall, a few inches above the lintel of the Nataraja devakostha niche. Once again, the portrait adorns the south face of the ardhamandapa wall (fig. 21). I would attribute differences between the Ana-fgur and Konerir-japuram figures primarily to differences between the sculptural styles of each temple rather than to evidence of separate portrait types or to individuation in these portraits. Both temples have what may be called their own stylis- tic signatures, their own slight variations on the basic formula of Phase 2 art, and the portraits share in these sub-styles.32 These stylistic signatures are especially obvious in the devakostha images. Compare, for example, the Nataraja devakostha images at Ana-flgur (fig. zo) and Kone-rirajapuram (fig. 6). The Ana-fgur image moves with considerably less freedom and energy. Whereas his limbs are comparatively short and the surface of his image is rough and grainy, the limbs of the K6nerir-japuram figure exhibit a fluidity in modelling and surface texture. The standing leg of the Analig r Nataraja is barely flexed and his spine is almost erect. The Konerirajapuram Nataraja, on the other hand, bends his standing leg deeply while he arches his spine at the waist to accommodate the sharp twists of his hip and shoulder. The Ana-ngur Nataraja is reduced to a simpler series of planes than those defined by its Kone-rirajapuram counterpart. The face of the Ana-figur Nataraja image exhibits a similarly simplified geometry. Its surface is defined by a hard sphere minimally interrupted by the contours of the nose and cheeks. The line of the mouth is drawn taut across the abstracted surface. His lowered eyelids are smooth planes that close off contact with the viewer. Compare the softer volumes of the Konerirajapuram Nataraja's face, the open and staring eyes, his longer head and slightly swollen lips.33 The figures in the portrait panel at Andlig r are likewise shorter and thicker than their Koneriraja- puram counterparts. The main figure in the Anaigur portrait panel is slightly puffy around the waist. His eyelids are lowered and the sober pout of his mouth further discourages interaction with a viewer. His face and body lack the animation of Gandardditya's portrait at Konerir-japuram, which is bright- eyed and smiling. The rough surface of the Anarngfr stone blurs the details, while the Konerira- japuram figures are more smoothly finished (even allowing for their oil coating). Two other relief figures on the Agastyesvara temple may also be portraits (figs. 22 and 23), but that identification remains tentative as these are uninscribed and as they represent substantial depar- tures from the formats of inscribed portraits. Their bodies display no iconographic marks that would suggest they represent mythological characters. The larger of these (fig. 22) shares certain features with the portrait of Sattan Gunabattan at Konerirajapuram: the simple loincloth and beaded neck- lace, the hair tied in a small chignon behind one ear, the shoulders of moderate breadth, the limbs of modest proportions. Both worship beside the base of a devakostha niche on the south wall of the ard- hamanddapa. 32 Schwindler suggests the existence of regional sub-styles among Sembiyan Mahadevi's monuments and notes espe- cially the "squatter physiques and distinctive, circular facial forms with large heavy-lidded eyes" of the Anafgar sculptural style. Schwindler, "Review," 97. 33 A photograph of the Nataraja (without a cloth wrap) at Konerirajapuram is published in Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, pl. 49.b. He also illustrates the Ardhana-ri and Durga images from this temple: pls. 52-53. 152</page><page sequence="15">The Anafigu-r image, however, sits as he worships. Evidence at Konerirajapuram suggests that the seated posture indicates royal status. Like the portrait ofGandaraditya, this figure sits on a small cushion, his crossed legs twisted toward the object of worship while his torso and face turn outward. The Analngur figure thus displays a combination of elements from the two Konerirajapuram portrait types. Another male figure at Ananfgur in the same posture is carved into a panel set into the basement moldings just to the left of Daksinimarti's feet (figs. 23-24). Smaller and carved in shallower relief, this figure draws the eye less forcefully than the one in figure 22, but here too one finds the conjunc- tion of the seated posture with placement low on the wall, an absence of attendants and royal para- phernalia, and attention turned toward a large, anthropomorphic devakostha instead of a small, ani- conic lifiga set in a separate narrative space. This ambiguous type of image is not unique to Anafigur. A similar image sits on the left side of Ardhanari's niche at Konerirajapuram (fig. 16). Another occurs at Kuttalam, beside the Nataraja (fig. 25).34 A similar image can be found at Aduturai beside Agastya (fig. 26). To date, however, I know of no inscriptions identifying any of these as portraits. The Agastyesvara temple (figs. 19, 27) avoids the unconventional orientation of the Umamahe- svara at Konerirajapuram, and opens instead to the east. At Anngaigur, then, visitors would certainly have encountered the south wall and its portrait at the beginning of circumambulation. Otherwise the Anafig r temple shares with the Umamahesvara many features standard to Phase 2 temples. Orig- inal images of Daksinamurti (fig. 24), Lifngodbhava and Brahma occupy the niches of the vimdna. The ardhamandapa walls each display three devakostha niches of which the north three house Durga (fig. 28) flanked by Bhiksatana and Ardhanari, and the south three house Agastya (fig. 29) flanked by Gane'a and Nataraja. On each of these walls, only the central niche is ornamented with a foliated arch (fig. 21). Diminutive narrative figures appear beside the base of every devakostha niche except those occupied by Gane'a, Brahma and Ardhana-ri.35 The devakostha images possess the taut postures and hard surfaces often found in Phase 2 sculpture. The figures are short in proportion to the height of the temple wall, and in proportion to their own large, round heads. An inscription states unequivocally that Sembiyan Mahadevi sponsored the construction of this temple.36 On the basis of a second inscription mentioning a gift to the finished temple in Uttama Cola's tenth year, scholars have attributed construction to the year 98I.37 34 Note that the location of this Kuttalam image is comparable to Konerirajapuram's non-royal portrait, rather than its royal image. In placing the Konerira-japuram portrait of Gandardditya "near the Nataraja niche on the ard- hamanadapa's south wall", Sanford has confused the two Konerirajapuram portraits. Sanford, "A Comparative Study," 181. 35 It is possible that such figures exist on the right side of Gane'a and the left side of Ardhandtri; these spots are now obscured by the walls of a later mandapa. 36 ARSIE for 1925-26, #75 of I926, 40. 37 An inscription describing a gift of sheep to the temple mentions the tenth year ofUttama Cla's reign which would be 981 according to Sethuraman. Scholarship preceding Sethuraman understood Uttama's reign to have begun in 969, and thus understands his tenth year as 979. See Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, 92; Schwindler, "Review," 97; and Balasubrahmanyam, Early Temples, 185. The inscription is summarized in ARSIE 1925-26, #78 of 1926, 40. It has also been published in SII19, #267, 134-35, where the Tamil text appears without translation. 153</page><page sequence="16">Anfinlgur provides a second example of a K6nerirajapuram type 2 portrait, likely another repre- sentation of a C61a king dear to Sembiyan Mahadevi. This portrait marks a second temple sponsored by Sembiyan Mahadevi built probably within ten years of the construction at K6nerirajapuram. It is interesting to note that minor variations in sculptural style are to be distinguished even among Sem- biyan Mahddevi's temples. These rather than hints of individuation seem responsible for minor vari- ations between the royal portraits at Anaingur and Konerirajapuram. Kuttalam A relief of Konerirajapuram type 2 appears at Kuttalam on the Uktavedi"vara temple (fig. 30),38 another architectural project sponsored by queen Sembiyan Mahadevi. The relief consists of a large, seated, male image worshipping a ligappitha and attended by two smaller, standing figures.39 The group, carved above Agastya's devakostha niche (figs. 31-32), is like Ana~figr's located high on the southern wall of the ardhamandapa well over the heads of worshippers as they begin to circumam- bulate the temple. Strong resemblances between the Kuttalam image and the portrait of Gandardditya at K6nerirajapuram suggest the former is also a royal portrait. Published inscriptions from this temple do not refer to this image, but Sembiyan Mahadevi's patronage of the temple's con- struction implies that the portrait represented someone significant to her. The portrait's similarities to K6nerirajapuram royal portraits suggest her husband or her son as likely subjects.4? Similarities between the largest figure in the Kuttalam panel and Gandaraditya's portrait at K6nerirajapuram include posture, gesture, ornament and scale. Both sit cross-legged, hands pressed together in front of the chest, the face turning toward a garlanded linigapptha. Hair is tied in a fancy chignon and decorated with a garland or jewelry that drapes in front of the right ear. Broad shoul- ders are almost frontal, the lower body twisting to permit the figure to address simultaneously the viewer and the lingapptha. Facial features are full and round. Each seated figure towers over his stand- ing attendants in a clear demonstration of hieratic scaling. Like his Analigur counterpart, however, the Kuttdlam figure does not smile. The attendant figures bear a particularly close resemblance to their counterparts at Andingur. There are two of them, standing side by side in identical postures behind the seated figure. Each holds an object over his right shoulder. The figure furthest from the lingapptha holds a caur-while his com- panion holds a long object I do not recognize that extends over his shoulder and hangs to the floor. Both servants are dressed in simple loincloths. Their heads seem shaven and their long earlobes are unadorned. The Kuttalam group forms a mirror image of the Anarigur group: a centrally placed, large figure sits between a lingapZtha which he faces, and two standing attendants at his back. The Uktavedi'vara, like the UmamaheSvara at Konerirajapuram, is oriented with its entrance to the west, and the figures of its portrait panel face the vimdna of the Uktavedi~vara temple as they address the lingapltha within 38 Other names for the temple are "Uttaravedisvara" and "Colisvara". 39 The portrait is not among those mentioned by Aravamuthan. Balasubrahmanyam refers to it as a "donor relief". Balasubrahmanyam, Early Temples, I76-77. 40 This identification has been suggested by Balasubrahmanyam and Venkataraman.

The Kuttalam panel lacks the Konerirdjapuram group's priestly figure garlanding the lingap.tha and replaces the second king with a second attendant. Instead of floating on the surface of the wall as the Andfigur and K6narirajapuram panels do, the Kuttalam panel is enclosed within the foliated arch that caps the Agastya niche (fig. 31). Thus the Kuttalam figures are more tightly integrated into the ornamentation scheme of the niche and they are carved more shallowly. They are, nevertheless, quite deep for images in this location. Compare for example the shallower carving and more frontal presentation of the figure of Daksinamurti (fig. 33) engraved in the arch above Gane'a on the same wall.41 The portrait's greater fullness of relief would have drawn the eye and granted the portrait a special significance. As the royal umbrella and danda that seem to mark the reigning king at Konerirajapuram are absent at Kuttalam, this seated figure suggests a C6la who was no longer king. David Sanford has suggested that the Uktavedisvara was Uttama C6la's pa.1ipatai, in which case Uttama was likely to be represented in retirement or death, as his father had been at what may have been his pallipatai in Konerirajapuram. Both buildings open to the west, possibly an orientation with associations of the funereal, political, or both. Niched images retain their standard north-south orientations, implying that circumambulation was to be performed in a counter-clockwise direction, which also may have had funereal associations. Sanford notes that the Kuttalam temple seems unusually elaborate among Sembiyan Mahadevi's commissions, perhaps a sign of its unusual importance.42 The Uktavedisvara bears a second figure on the same wall that may also be a portrait. This image, a seated male figure carved outside the lower right corner of the Nataraja niche (figs. 25, 34), resem- bles closely one of the uninscribed figures at Ana-figur (fig. 22) that I have discussed above as a pos- sible portrait. This Kuttalam figure is apparently uninscribed.43 Sanford takes it rather than the arch relief discussed above as the portrait of Uttama C6la. I find the arch relief a more likely candidate since it resembles an inscribed C61a portrait. The patronage and date of the Uktavedisvara are identified in an inscription on the temple's east and north walls. Sembiyan Mahadevi is named as the patron, and the seventh year of R-jaraja I's reign (992) is established as the date of construction.44 The relevant section may be translated: Sri Udaiyabirattiyar Sembiyan Mahadeviyar, who conceived in her sacred womb Sri Uttama Cola, built this holy stone temple in the seventh year of Ko-Rajara-jakesari. 41 The subjects depicted under these arches at Kuttalam are (in order of counter-clockwise circumambulation): the portrait, Daksinamfrti, Uma Sahita, a panel obscured by later construction, Gajalaksmi, Candesanugraha, Kalarim-rti, Mahisasuramardini and Kaliyamardhana. 42 See Sanford, "A Comparative Study," 181, 191 (note 56) and fig. 53b. 43 None of the inscriptions published so far identifies this figure. Cf. SII 23, #485-95, 362-77. 44 Barrett and Scwindler also accept the construction date mentioned in the inscription. Barrett, Architecture and Sculp- ture, III. Schwindler, "Review," 97. Hoekveld-Meijer dates temple to before 992, but her own arguments seem to contradict this. She views this temple's "Ib" panjaras and three-niched ardhaman'dapas as archaizing, and believes that archaisms became popular after 99o0.

The architectural and sculptural affinities between this temple and, in particular, the Umamahesvara at Konerirajapuram include six devakostha images of the ardhamandapa are Agastya, Gane a and Nata- raja along the south wall and Bhiksatana, Durga and Ardhanarl along the north. Diminutive narra- tive figures flanking the niches are again large and frequent. Also at both, a false antardla pierced with grille windows links the vimdna and ardhamandapa. The sculptural style of the devakostha images reveals the compact proportions and tight model- ling that characterize much Phase 2 sculpture. Within that general style, the Kuttalam images resem- ble the svelte and fluidly modelled figures at Konerira-japuram more closely than the somewhat dense, taut figures at Ana-fgur (figs. 2o, 21, 28-29). The worshipping image in Kuttalam's arch is a portrait of Konerirajapuram type 2, probably rep- resenting Uttama Cola whom the temple may have memorialized. A second image at this temple may also be a portrait of the uninscribed type present at Konerirajapuram and Anafigur. Both images reflect this temple's elegant sculptural style. Kuhur The Amravaneivara temple in Kuhur provides a second and inscribed example of Konerirajapuram type I (fig. 36).46 1n its format and its location on the temple, the unfinished Kuhur portrait recalls the Konerirajapuram portrait of Sattan Gunabattan. The inscription beneath the Kuhur portrait, however, indicates no ties to the Cola family and implies that this locality leader sponsored con- struction of the temple his image adorns. The sculptural and architectural style of the Amravanesvara, meanwhile, follows generally that of temples sponsored by Sembiyan Mahadevi. In other words, this portrait indicates that a Phase I patronage system persisted beside a Phase 2 iconographic program and Phase 2 modes for presenting the self in portraiture. The inscription identifying this image as a portrait is carved into the stone face underneath the relief. It "states that this stone temple was built by Madamudaiyar Varagunatondar whose figure is sculptured above the inscription."47 Other locality leaders may also have contributed to the temple's construction, as we have seen at the Phase I temple in Tiruvilakkudi. Another inscription on the same wall mentions that "Vayirikutteran alias Solavijjiadira Pallavaraiyan, the headman of Kurur [provided for offerings] to a shrine constructed by him in this village."48 The Kuhur portrait emerges from a block of stone that juts roughly from the even surface of the wall to the right of Agastya's niche (fig. 37). To the left of the same niche is another rough block with 45 The inscription is summarized in ARSIE for I925-26, #Io3 of 1926. The entire inscription is published in Tamil in SII 13, #170, 92-96. Sembiyan Mah-devi's patronage is stated in the "Ioth piece" of the inscription, lines 21-82. 46 Aravamuthan includes the image in his study and notes the inscription labeling it. T. G.

The general contours of the portrait were finished. The rough matrix of its stone block projects to such a distance from the wall plane that if completely finished this portrait would have stood out in relief as full as that of Sattan Gunabat- tan's portrait at Konerirajapuram. This portrait recalls Sattan Gunabattan's portrait in its format. The portrait body stands with- out torsions at a forty-five-degree angle from the plane of the wall. He is dressed simply in a loin- cloth. The stone matrix surrounding the Kuh-r figure gives no hint of plans to surround the image with any framing device, or of any object of worship to occupy the panel with him. His hands are pressed together in front of his chest and he turns his body in three-quarter profile to address a niched deity. He stands outside the lower edge of that niche, part of the ornament focused on that architec- tural motif but also free from the constraints of its structural members. In the focus of its devotion on Nataraja, the Kuh-r figure again recalls Sattan Gunabattan's portrait though Madamudaiyar Varagunatondar addresses Nataraja by turning away from the niche closest to him (figs. 37-38). By the late tenth century when this temple was built, the cult of Nataraja appears to have caught on among local citizens. The Kuhur portrait seems also to incorporate certain individuating features, another trait of Konerirajapuram type I. Although the unfinished surface of the image makes facial details difficult to discern, the body demonstrates some distinctive characteristics. This portrait and Sdttan Gunabat- tan's both are twenty-five centimeters high but Madamudaiy-ar Varagunatondar's portrait appears to have a larger head and shorter legs (figs. 4, 36). His short arms cling weakly to his chest. His legs are stiff and his body unbending. These individuating elements set Madamudaiya-r Varagunatondar's portrait apart from diminu- tive narrative figures at Kuhur. The figure ofVisnu submitting to Lifigodbhava on this temple's west wall has muscular arms that swing away from his gracefully tapered torso (fig. 40). Visnu too emerges from an unfinished block of stone, but already his image conveys a sense of motion in the parted legs and the slight sway of the hips. The Kuhur portrait's peculiar proportions allude to the specifity of the subject's body as it aims for union with the divine. This specificity is achieved through different features than those used to represent Sattan Gunabattan. In keeping with the practice exhibited by most portraits of Phases I and 2, Madamudaiyar Varagunatondar's portrait adorns the south wall of the ardhamandapa. This temple opens, conven- tionally, to the east and the portrait appears to greet the approaching visitor at the same time it addresses Nataraja. Interestingly, this means that the portrait has adopted the uncommon attitude of turning its back toward the vimdna. Might the cult of Nataraja have gained such prominence that it began to overshadow the cult of the linga ? Recent scholarship points toward a date between 969 and 985 A.D. for the construction of this temple (fig. 41). Although an inscription on the temple looks to be of the early tenth century,49 Barrett considers this inscription a remnant from an earlier temple that once stood on this site. He 49 SII 19 (1970), #232, II8. The inscription refers to the temple as Adityeivara ("temple of the Lord worshipped by Aditya"). Balasubrahmanyam attributes the temple to the reign of Aditya I Cola on those grounds: Early Art, 192. I57</page><page sequence="20">and Schwindler instead favor a date around 970 since that better suits the stylistic features he observes there.5? Barrett classifies the basement moldings at Kuhur as type B.2.a, which he finds in several temples of Sembiyan Mahadevi's style and in none before her time except Tiruvaduturai.51 Hoekveld-Meijer classifies the Kuhur vimdna as type II-4-b, which she finds typical in the Kaveri area after 969. This denotes a two-story vimdna (II), a vimdna wall with three projecting facets of which the central facet projects farther than the others (4), and six pilasters on each vimdna wall (b). In terms of Hoekveld-Meijer's second developmental criterion, the width of the ardhamanadapa and the way in which it is connected to the vimdna, the Amravaneivara belongs to her type I-B-3. Each vimdna wall has one niche (I), the ardhamandapa is as wide as the vimdna and they are connected with a false antardla (B), and each ardhamandapa wall bears three niches (3). According to her maps, this type is common after 969, and it is the exclusive pattern in the Ka-ve-ri area between 969 and 985. She therefore places the Amravaneivara's construction between 980 and 985.52 Other architectural and sculptural features reinforce this impression of Phase 2 construction. Miniature narrative figures, and blocks apparently slated to be carved into such figures, flank the base of almost every niche. The six devakostha niches of the ardhamandapa house Ganefa, Nataraja and Agastya on the south, and Durga and Bhiksatana on the north.53 (The niche to Durga's left is empty.) The images are characterized by compact proportions and hardened surfaces, particularly in the depic- tion of flesh. The Amravaneivara temple demonstrates that local patronage persisted into the last quarter of the tenth century, and that the locality patrons took up the sculptural style, iconographic program and non-royal mode of portraiture found on Sembiyan Mahddevi's temples. A stylistic uniformity may have permeated Phase 2 despite the occasional persistence of Phase I patronage patterns. This new standardization of style may have carried particular weight because it was associated with the Colas whose authority seems at this point to have been waxing dramatically. Aduturai The Apatsahayesvara temple in Aduturai, a Phase 2 temple, bears a portrait of Konerirajapuram type I (fig. 42) and a second relief of the uninscribed format also found at Konerirajapuram, Ananigur and Kutta-lam (figs. 26, 43). A third image demonstrates some of the features typical of inscribed por- traits but is more likely a narrative figure (fig. 44). To my knowledge, none of these is identified by inscriptions.54 The faces of all three are too abraded for any physiognomic idiosyncrasies to be visi- ble. Details that do survive in the rendering of limbs and torsos on all three figures indicate that each figure represents a male. None of them therefore represents the patron, who is named clearly by an 5o He also notes an inscription of Uttama's 2nd year as the "earliest incontrovertible inscription" at the site.

Barrett briefly mentions the images adorning the antardla, though he does not refer to them as portraits. Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, 98. 158</page><page sequence="21">inscription as Queen Sembiyan Mahadevi. Inscriptional evidence is equally clear on the date, 987, by which this queen had the present structure erected. The figure of Konerirajapuram type I stands beside Nataraja's niche (fig. 45). Adhering to K6nerirajapuram type I, this figure stands as he worships, his hands before his chest in a-jali mudrd, his feet facing the viewer while his shoulders and face turn slightly toward the adjacent niche. The fullness of relief and the fluidity of modelling recall the portrait of Sattan Gunabattan (as well as the diminutive narrative figures of this temple). His elongated earlobes are empty and he has a large knot of hair behind the left ear. The Aduturai figure implies more stiffness in the knees than the Sattan Gunabattan portrait does. No attendants accompany this image and no framing device surrounds him. He appears on the south wall of the ardhamangaapa. He stands at the level of the deity's feet, out- side the devakostha niche, and selects Natardja as the focus of his devotion. The small loin-cloth that leaves the legs bare identifies the figure as male. By contrast, diminutive narrative figures of women at this temple wear heavy, ornate girdles around their hips and, judging from the triangular fold of cloth between the ankles, diaphanous garments that cover the legs (fig. 46). The second potential portrait at Aduturai sits on the right side ofAgastya's devakostha niche (fig. 43). Raised on a low stool and carved in the volumetric style of Phase 2 portraits, this figure resem- bles uninscribed, seated devotees at Konerirajapuram (fig. 16), Anarfigur (fig. 22) and Kuttalam (fig. 25). This figure is a blend of features from the two Konerirajapuram portrait types: the prominent relief and unframed presentation of both types; the devotional and non-narrative interaction with the devak/ostha and the location of Konerirajapuram type I; and the seated posture of Konerirajapu- ram type 2. The signs of this Aduturai figure suggest royalty yet more than similar images at other Sembiyan Maha-devi temples. Whereas the others appear to have shaven heads and empty earlobes, here the coif- fure is high and banded, and large round earrings depend from each ear. The short-legged stool beneath him is very clearly indicated. A large cylindrical form at the right edge of this carving may indicate a warrior's mace or a king's dandda. Another feature distinguishing the Aduturai figure is its gesture. Instead of the more commonly depicted anjali mudrd, this figure appears to hold offerings in each hand, much like Anantaiivan at Tiruviialur (fig. 5). The devakostha to whom this figure makes his offerings is Agastya. One of the comparable figures at Anafigr favors the same deity, but at Konerirajapuram it is Ardhanari and at Kuttalam it is Natara-ja who receive the devotions of such seated, unaccompanied figures. This flexibility precludes any narrative interpretation of these figures: they are clearly not tied to the mythology of any par- ticular deity. Their freedom to affiliate variously suggests instead the strong role played by personal choice in the bhakti mode of worship. A third relief at Aduturai represents a man worshipping a lingapd.tha (figs. 44, 47). This scene adorns the south face of the false antardla linking the vimdna and ardhamanddapa. The southern loca- tion would be right for a portrait. Also this image bears some resemblance to images of Konerira- japuram type I. The relief is clear and deep and it rises straight from the wall without any framing devices. The man stands as he prays, his hands in front of his chest and his torso angled toward the object of his devotion. No attendants are present. The proportions, soft modelling and perhaps smil- ing face recall the portrait of Sattan Gunabattan. I59</page><page sequence="22">Several minor differences distinguish this relief from inscribed portraits. During the second phase, the lingapitha has not elsewhere been the object of worship for standing figures. The location on the antardla is unique among the Ka-ve-ri portraits in this study. What most discourages one from read- ing this image as a portrait is that occupying a comparable position on the north side of this temple's false antardla is the image of a praying monkey (fig. 48), carved beside a similar lingapitha and ren- dered in the same posture as this human devotee. The monkey probably represents Valin or Sugriva, the monkey kings of the Rdamadyana, who were associated with this temple by popular legend.55 Sculp- tures that are thus "paired" in form and context were often linked in content.56 Some literary or mythological connection could exist between the monkey and the human figure on the false antardla at Aduturai. They may share an association with the Rdmayana, or perhaps the status of legendary devotees of this place. The monkey's presence renders the human figure less likely to represent an individual whose life was roughly contemporary with the construction of this temple. The date of the Apatsahayesvara temple is established as 987 (the sixteenth year ofUttama Cola's reign) by an inscription on the south wall of the vimdna.57 This states that in that year, Sembiyan Mah-adevi ordered inscriptions from a temple previously standing on this site to be reinscribed on the new temple that she had just built. Presumably, then, her temple at Aduturai had been com- pleted only shortly before 987. The features of the Apatsahayesvara illustrate yet again the consistency among monuments spon- sored by this queen (figs. 49). The images housed in the ardhamandapa niches, encountered in order of circumambulation, are: Ganesa, Nataraja, Agastya, Bhiksatana, Gafiga-dhara, and Durga (fig. 50yo). Nataraja occupies the central niche of this ardhamandapa wall. This involves the same ardhamandapa plan that Barrett labels type II.f, and which characterizes all five Phase 2 temples in this chapter (fig. 2). Diminutive narrative figures, which appear beside every devakostha, are volumetric as well as numerous. Hoekveld-Meijer characterizes the ground plan of this temple as type I-B-3. Each face of the vimdna has one devakostha niche (I), the ardhamandapa is as wide as the vimdna (B), and there are three devakostha niches on each wall of the ardhamandapa (3).58 Potentially, Aduturai adds a closely dated example to the list of Konerirajapuram type I images, thereby indicating that the image type persisted throughout the reign of Uttama C61ola. Of the other two images that demonstrate some of the features of inscribed portraits, the figure seated beside Agastya is more likely to be a portrait, though there is as yet no inscriptional confirmation of that 55 Balasubrahmanyam records that the deity of this temple was thought "to have been worshipped by the monkey kings Valin and Sugriva."

He calculates on the assumption that Uttama C61a acceded to the throne in 969 rather than 971. Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, 98. Hoekveld-Meijer dismisses the evidence of the inscription which contradicts her assumption that one-story vimdnas of this phase were built before 98o. See Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, Appendix 12, 385.

The figure in the antardla probably represents an heroic, mythical character, related in some way to the monkey occupying a parallel location on the opposite side of the temple. Portraiture and Sembiyan Mahadevi Architecture and inscriptions reveal Sembiyan Mahadevi as a person of such initiative, means, piety and perhaps even political acumen that scholars have searched for portraits of her, understandably eager to know more about her. As I discussed in Part One, many viewers expect portraits to offer a kind of genuine social contact across time, assuming that portraits mirror faithfully the physical fea- tures of the people represented, and that those features reveal somehow the true inner nature of that subject. Perhaps this urge to see the beneficent queen, or the wish to take darian (blessing sight) of her, has prompted the identification of several sculptures as portraits of Sembiyan Mahadevi.59 The residents of Sembiyan Mahadevi village now point to a small, darkened stone relief as a portrait of this queen (fig. 5I), though this figure's squat proportions, thick feet, enlarged hands, wide stance and facial features indicate a style that flourished well after her lifetime.6o I have however located no portraits of this queen that might have been contemporary with her. Though the Phase I relief at Cakrappa!!i indicates that portraits of female donors could be carved dur- ing the tenth century, personal or traditional considerations may have precluded her from having herself thus represented. I have demonstrated above that the likely portrait reliefs on temples this queen built are all marked by their clothing as male subjects. Even at Konerirajapuram, where an inscription mentioning her name runs beneath a portrait group, there is no female image in the group that could signify her. Sembiyan Mahadevi may have commissioned portraits of herself in bronze, though I cannot iden- tify as such any specific pieces that do survive from the later tenth century. We have documentation of the practice of casting portraits of women and men of the C61ola family by the eleventh century, two generations after Sembiyan Mahadevi. Inscriptions at the Rajarajesvara temple in Tafijavur reveal that Rdjardja I Cola's sister Kundavai set up bronze portraits of her father and mother;6' the "man- ager" of the temple claims to have set up bronze portraits of Rdjaraja and his wife Lokamahadevi.62 An inscription in Sembiyan Mah devi village describes the celebration of Sembiyan Mahadevi's birthday and the worship of a metal image of her.63 This is presumably the inscription to which Vidya Dehejia refers in hypothesizing that the Freer Gallery's figure, once identified as Parvati (fig. 52), is a portrait of Sembiyan Mahadevi and the very bronze taken out in procession for these celebrations.64 This inscription only documents the existence of her bronze portrait in I022, by which time this queen probably was dead. The Freer bronze on the other hand is of the late tenth century by Dehejia's assess- ment of its style. 59 See for example notes 8, 9, 14 above. 60 Compare this to the figure from Ramn-ad of perhaps the twelfth century, illustrated in Aravamuthan, Portrait Sculp- ture, 41 and fig. 17. 61 SII 2, #6. 62 SII 2, #38. 63 SII19, #458. 64 Vidya Dehejia, "The Very Idea of a Portrait," Ars Orientalis 28 (1998), 40-48. This article expands on her suggestion in Art of the Imperial Cholas (New York: Columbia University Press, I990), 38-39. 173</page><page sequence="36">Even ifa metal portrait ofSembiyan Mahadevi was made during her lifetime, I consider the Freer sculpture no more likely to have been that object than any other bronze female figure surviving from the late tenth or early eleventh century. Part of Dehejia's evidence of portraiture in this piece appears to be her observations of an "exaggerated slope of its shoulders,...the naturalistic handling of its full heavy breasts, and...its solemn, thoughtful expression" which make the bronze "not a standard image of the goddess Parvati." I would argue that peculiar features are only associated with portraiture in some cultures and situations, and they are in India at least as likely to mark representations of the demons, foreigners and the Buddha's disciples as they are to mark portraits. I agree with Dehejia that the "idealization" of this bronze does not disqualify it from having func- tioned as a portrait. The features of the inscribed royal portraits at Konerirajapuram may incorpo- rate no physiognomic idiosyncrasies. But I disagree that this continued an unbroken pre-Mughal tradition in which Indic artists "did not sculpt images recognizable by their physical characteristics" to their original viewers, and only recognizable as portraits by their inscriptions.65 Early Indic por- traiture incorporated both features that captured an individual subject's unique identity and features that informed viewers about the categories to which that individual belonged. Literary evidence indi- cates that the features of earlier portraits were legible to their contemporaries. Images that strike our eyes as unindividuated may have looked like portraits to their contemporaries because they bore other signs that their culture associated with portraiture. Our own standards for visual likeness become in this context irrelevant, anachronistic. Such considerations notwithstanding, the culture of the K-veri region during the tenth century encouraged physical idiosyncrasies blatant enough for us to see in the portraiture of donors outside the Cola family. They do so apparently because the divine union they sought was predicated upon their individual identity.66 The presentation of features similar to those of goddess images in a por- trait of Sembiyan Mahadevi would have been therefore a deliberate choice made in resistance to an ambient practice. The generalized portraits of her husband and son at Konerir-japuram suggest the same choice, and that individuating physiognomies were not considered relevant signs in the depic- tion of royalty. I regard it as possible that the Freer "Parvati" functioned as a portrait of Sembiyan Mahadevi, or as a portrait of another royal person, or not as a portrait at all. No archeological data or inscriptions associated directly with this object mark it as a portrait, and only a rumor links it with the town in which a metal portrait of Sembiyan Mahdevi was reported some fifty years after this piece was cast.67 If the Freer bronze functioned as a portrait in the tenth century, it would be the earliest example I know of bronze portraiture in the Kaveri region. 65 Dehejia, "The Very Idea of a Portrait," 41-42. Nor, for that matter, would I assume that peculiar features on por- traits made during or after the Mughals are mimetic. The cascading coiffure and the portly belly of Nayak portraits may have been signs of character or status rather than reflections of the kings' own bodies. Cf. Ibid., 45-47. 66 Here I wish to correct the impression Dehejia received (ibid., 45) from my essay, "Passionate Bodies: Constructions of the Self in South Indian Portraits," Archives of Asian Art 48 (1995), 6-I6. I did not mean to imply that these por- traits are "mere types" of the ecstatic devotee. 67 See Dehejia, "The Very Idea of a Portrait," 43 and note 3. 174</page><page sequence="37">Portraiture under Rajaraja I When Rajaraja I succeeded to the throne in 985 A.D., he initiated substantial changes in the politi- cal and economic organization of the K-veri region, in systems for financing temple construction, and in temple art itself. He centralized under royal control three previously localized activities, the collection of taxes, the issuing of orders and donations, and the arbitration of local disputes,68 thereby channeling authority and resources away from the localities and through his capital at Tafijavur. In that city he sponsored construction of the Rajardjesvara temple which was completed by the year IoIo (fig. 53). A monument unprecedented throughout the south for its size and expense, his temple was likely intended to establish Tafljavur as a focus of pilgrimage and thus as an economic and spiritual center for the entire southern peninsula.69 He may have funded some of the temple's construction through taxes on citizens who resided outside Tafijavur,7o further centralizing the region by divert- ing funds away from localities that had previously spent surplus wealth to erect small temples in their own towns. Around the year Iooo, then, we finally encounter a Cola king seriously engaged in the funding of temple construction. Rajaraja's temple was novel in other ways as well. Instead of building at a site sanctified by hymns of the early bhakti poets, as locality temples had been, Rajaraja built in a city identified only with the Colas.7' In terms of its design, too, this temple represented substantial inno- vation.72 Royal grandeur replaced quiet intimacy. The niches that punctuated the center of vimdna walls on earlier Kaveri temples were replaced by massive doorways leading directly into an enclosed ambulatory aisle that wrapped around the inner sanctum or garbha griha.73 That ambulatory aisle (fig. 54), not a feature of most tenth-century K-veri temples, was at Tafijavur covered in frescoed murals74 and thus became a new site for worshipping the deity. Those 68 See James Heitzman, "State formation." 69 Parallel to the strategies of kings in Orissa, as analyzed by Hermann Kulke,]agannatha-Kult und Gajapati-Kbnig- tumn, Schriftenreihe des Sildasien-Instituts der Universitit Heidelberg, Band 23 (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag- gmbh, 1979), 233; and "Royal Temple Policy." 70 Kulke, "Royal Temple Policy," 135.

Tripura-ntaka, "the lord who destroyed three demon cities," evoked Rdjardja, the successful military conqueror.r Nataraja, the god of Cidambaram and also an emblem of conquest, articulated the alliance Rajaraja intensified with that ancient cult center, an alliance that would remain central to Cola policy throughout the dynasty's reign.76 Gerd Mevissen points out that the ancient design man- ual, the Mayamata, identified these as the two deities to worship to bring immediate death to your enemies; he also notes that several South Indian rulers oriented Tripurantaka images on their tem- ples to face the kingdoms of their enemies.77 One could argue that the Rajarajesvara temple is in itself a kind of portrait of Rajaraja. The scale of the building was appropriate to the mighty image he wished to project and to the vast distances over which he sought to project it. The architectural mass - visible for miles across this broad plain - and its iconographic themes broadcast Rajaraja's identity, his presence and his power.78 And the many representations of Tripurantaka, as an emblem of the warrior aspect of the king, construct the entire structure as a symbol of Rajaraja and his military achievements against the capitals of neigh- boring kings. Some of these changes do seem to have evolved logically from patterns of the tenth century. Con- tinuity accompanied innovation. The Rajarajesvara's elevation is composed of familiar components, multiplied in quantity and scale. The basement molding, the architectural components of the niches, and the basic design of unfaceted walls punctuated by large, deep niches are familiar from tenth- century temple design. And Rajaraja's decision to build this temple appears to have been catalyzed by Sembiyan Mahadevi's patronage. Her incursions into the mostly local practice of patronizing tem- ple construction may well have convinced Rajardja of the effectiveness of temple art in disseminat- ing a royal agenda. Nor did Rdjardja initiate the Cola affiliation with Cidambaram. That fruitful coali- tion was initiated earlier in the tenth century, surely by 970 with Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples and possibly as early as 945 under Parantaka I Cola. The pattern is one of subtle continuities underlying profound innovation that also holds for Rajar-ja's portraits. Geographic location apparently determined whether old patterns or new pre- vailed. Outside the capital, in the localities where the early Ka-veri canon for portraiture and other temple arts had been set, Rdjaraja is portrayed in terms quite similar to tenth-century portraits of local patrons. His portraits participate more completely in that locality mode than had portraits of 75 R-jaraja was successful against the Pandyas and Sri Lafika to the south, the CEras to the west, the Gafigas and West- ern Ca-lukyas to the northwest, and the Eastern Calukyas to the north; he sent raiding parties as far east as Sumatra and Malaysia.

Kulke has observed in Orissa that the juxtaposition of temple and palace articulated an intimacy between king and deity.

At Tafijavur, the hub of royal innovations, any por- traits of Rajaraja that may survive look like nothing I have yet described from the Kaveri region. On the Sivayoganatha temple at Tiruvi'alur, an inscription below two relief figures identifies them as representations of Rajar-ja and his queen Lokamahadevi (fig. 55), and notes that the king and queen performed rituals at this temple, and that the queen endowed it with 458 kilSu of gold.79 These figures share with their royal predecessors (of Konerirajapuram type z) only their compact propor- tions, their lack of framing, and the narrow ledge upon which they float against an open section of the wall surface, unattached to any architectural members. This last feature was also, however, pres- ent in non-royal portraits of Phase I, and in most other respects these Tiruvisalur figures follow the tenth-century mode for non-royal portraiture. They are small, sculptural, and composed of figures worshipping before a diminutive lirigapitha. R-jar-ja stands to worship, as the portraits of Gandara- ditya and Uttama Cola did not. And his appearance incorporates idiosyncrasies that suggest the indi- viduated body offered up for divine union. He is portrayed as a short, rotund man. Even his knees are plump. His earlobes are long and unornamented and he wears a kilt similar to that in the portrait of Anantasivan (fig. 5) at the same temple. His coiffure, a small knot of hair tied on top of his head, bears no ornamentation.8? An inscription of Rajardja's time reports that a bronze portrait of the king was installed in the temple,"' testifying further to the practice of presenting Rajaraja in anthropomorphic form. That bronze seems, however, to have been lost over the years. Nor is there inscriptional evidence to sup- port the frequent identifications of sculptured figures and mural fragments at the Ra-jar-jevara as portraits of Rajaraja.82 79 SII 23, #42, 2o-22; ARSIE of 1906-o7, #42 of 1907. The image is noted in El 12, 121 note 2. 80 A similar-looking male figures stands beside a lingap.tha in adoration on the north wall of the large hall (mahdman- adapa) at Konerirajapuram. Accompanying him is a female figure of very slender proportions, this time on the oppo- site side of the lingapptha. Also at K6nfrirajapuram, on the west wall of the detached Candikeivara shrine, a similar plump, male figure stands in anfali mudrd behind a kneeling male figure. Both face a lingapptha.The entire group is carved in high relief and floats at the center of the wall, unframed and unmoored to any niche. Aravamuthan associates this group with an inscription naming the private donor of this shrine (ARSIE of 1910, 91, 24), though he does not specify which of the two figures he believes to represent that donor: Portrait Sculpture, 33. 81 Inscriptions relate that there was also a bronze portrait of Rajaraja I installed within the temple. SII 2, #38, 14, I7, 44, 47, and #40. Coins of Rajaraja are the earliest known coins from the Tamil region to represent the king. These numismatic images are described as rough figures of a king seated or standing, with a conch. An arrow and crescent may also be present. See R. S. R. Ayyangar, "Coins of Rajaraja Chola," Numismatic Supplement to thejournal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal 39 (1925), 260; as cited in the Bibliography of Indian Coins, Part I (Non-Muhammadan Series) compiled by C. R. Singhal, ed. by A. S. Altekar (Bombay: Numismatic Society of India, 1950o). 82 There is no visual or textual evidence to read the youthful ascetic beside Saraswati, facing the north stair to the ard- hamandaapa, as anything more than a sannydsi of the sort found beside most images of Daksinamdrti. The figure is read as a portrait of Rajaraja, accompanied by an older man representing his preceptor Karuvur, by Somasundaram Pillai, The Great Temple at Tanjore, caption for plate opposite 16; and by Dehejia, Cholas, 48. I question for the same reason the similar reading of two figures sitting at the feet of Daksinamarti, painted in chamber 5 of the ambula- tory: contra Spencer, Politics, fig. 2, 38; and by Balasubrahmanyam, Middle Temples, 31. Another similar pair of figures is painted on the north-facing jamb at the inner corner of chamber IO, and I am inclined to read these too as sundry 177</page><page sequence="40">The only piece among these to suggest pictorial evidence of portraiture is the mural, in chamber 9 of the ambulatory aisle, of a male and three females worshipping Natardja at Cidambaram (fig. 56).83 The pair of bell-shaped golden roofs over Nataraja and the four devotees locates the scene specifically in Cidambaram, where these highly distinctive architectural forms mark the inner shrine dedicated to Nataraja. We know from inscriptions on the Rajar-jesvara's exterior that Rajaraja was particularly devoted to Nataraja.84 The same inscriptions refer to several women as donors to this temple and devo- tees of Nataraja: the king's sister Kundavai and his wives Lokamahadevi, Paficavan Mahadevi and Cola Mahadevi. And it would have made strategic sense for R jaraja to present himself in Tafijdvur as a devotee ofNataraja of Cidambaram. Such a declaration could have legitimated Tafijavur as a pil- grimage center by implying an axis of connection between Tafijavur and a city that, unlike Tafij-vur, had an ancient and illustrious sacred tradition. It is difficult to see these two portraits, the rural relief and the urban mural, as likenesses of the same man. The features they share - mustache, large chignon, short kilt - are external things any- one could take on. The urban representation is tall and slim-waisted, a mighty warrior taller than his female companions. The rural figure is rotund, squat, and essentially the same height as his wife. He shares with the portraits of local leaders on local temples the stance of fellow devotee, welcoming vis- itors to the temple and joining them in worship. These contrasts remind us what a flexible thing por- traiture is. Factors such as the conditioned response expected from viewers, or the idiom of the sur- rounding architecture can have great impact on images, while the physiognomies of subjects may have played little or no role in shaping the portrait image. CONCLUSIONS Stone reliefs carved on temples of the Kaveri region during the tenth century of the modern era demonstrate that portraiture existed in India before the Mughals and the British imported their ver- sions of the genre to the subcontinent. There is also evidence that portraiture existed in India before the tenth and perhaps even before the second century, and that the messages conveyed by those por- traits as well as the means for conveying them were framed in indigenous terms. Early Indic portraits ascetics although they do not direct their attention to a deity. I gather that the primary reason for supposing por- traiture here is that the younger figure attends to the speech of the elder. See Balasubrahmanyam, Middle Temples, 34, color plates I, Io; Spencer, Politics, fig. 2, 38; Dehejia, Cholas, o50. Huntington illustrates the scene, but is appro- priately dubious about it being a portrait: Ancient India, 528, color plate 33. The smaller seated figure worshipping Nataraja, depicted in chamber 7, is more likely to represent the Kerala king Ceramdn, famous for his travels with Sundaramuirti Nayanar. For the reading as portrait, see C. Sivaramamurti, Royal Conquests and Cultural Migrations in South India and the Deccan (Calcutta: Indian Museum, 1955), caption to pl. XIX.a. On Ceraman, see Balasubrahmanyam, Middle Temples, 31-33. 83 Other scholars have read this as Rajaraja I and three of his queens at Cidambaram: Balasubrahmanyam, Middle Tem- ples, 33-34, color plates 6, 7; Spencer, Politics, fig. 2, 38; Sastri, Colas, 74I1. 84 SII 2, #1-6.

They do not acknowledge a meaningful separation between the categories of"individualism" and "group affiliation". The Ka-veri-area figures may seem to make an especially compelling case for indigenous portrai- ture because so many of them display individuation. And yet what most qualifies the Ka-ve-ri figures as portraits is, in my opinion, the presence of adjacent inscriptions testifying that these relief images were intended to serve as indices to specific human subjects who existed during historical time. Given the enormous variability of codes employed by different cultures for portraying the historical indi- vidual, this indexical function and the reference to a human subject are the only components I am yet willing to include in a cross-cultural definition of portraiture. Individuation does not belong in that definition. Portraiture and the depiction of idiosyncratic physical features are mutually inde- pendent categories that only sometimes overlap. Since individuation is not simply an indication of portraiture, we must read it afresh each time we encounter it. Bhakti poetry, contemporary politics and architectural context suggest that phys- iognomic peculiarities in Phase-I Ka-ve-ri portraits reflect a sense of the self that reposes as much in the physical body as in the emotional soul and the intellectual mind. All aspects of this self yearned passionately together for direct union with god. Such portraits, carved while the power of the local- ities flourished, often represented the locality elite. During the 970s, with the reign ofUttama Cola and the patronage of Sembiyan Mahadevi, the C61olas began to exercise greater political and artistic influence. As Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples imposed a standardization of temple design, a new deity from Cidambaram, and a centralizing focus upon the C61olas, portraits of Cola royalty began to adorn the temples she built in the localities. Instead of idiosyncrasies of physical appearance, these portraits depicted royal insignia, attendants, and the majesty of the king who may sit to worship. Commem- orating a family member dear to the patron rather than the patron herself, these royal portraits artic- ulated that family's solidarity and power more than they stressed the individual heart's longing for union with the divine. Portraits of local residents changed in Phase 2 as well, revealing less marked individuation and less of a female presence despite at least one woman's considerable participation in temple sponsorship. What the Colas may have terminated, and probably appropriated, were ancient and deeply rooted patterns of government, devotional worship, temple patronage, architecture and portraiture (among other things), all of which functioned meaningfully at the local level. Supported most likely by the high fertility that had long favored this riverine delta, these localities, of which there were dozens within the Kaveri region, sustained a flourishing culture within and among themselves. The por- traits of Phase I at Pulijai, Tiruvifalor and Tiruvaduturai take us into those localities, into the pres- ence of individuals who most likely owned the land, controlled surplus wealth, kept order, built tem- ples and yearned passionately for god's love. Portraits of Phase 2 lead us away from that culture of locality dominance and toward a discourse shaped increasingly by the royal center. 179</page></plain_text>
