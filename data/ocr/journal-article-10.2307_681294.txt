'91, 136 pp. (7 x 10), 2 il., 30 tables, $30.75. ISBN 0-398-05747-8 POSTMORTEM CHANGE IN HUMAN AND ANI- MAL REMAINS: A Systematic Approach provides a unique, synthetic treatment of postmortem change presented in a systematic fashion with attention to the relative chronologies of both physical and cultural factors that influence human and animal remains. This book integrates reports and observa- tions in the anthropology/archaeology literature with material as appropriate from medicine, path- ology, paleopathology, ethnography (cultural an- thropology) and the forensic sciences, as well as reporting on original observations by the author. In addition to discussing transformation of skele- tal remains (as is the focus of most taphonomic studies in anthropology and archaeology), compre- hensive treatment is given to changes in soft tissue remains, as well as to conditions under which such remains may be preserved postmortem. The immedi- ate changes that occur within minutes/hours have been traditionally described by forensic pathologists, while this book "fills in the blanks" between where pathology has traditionally left off, and before an- thropology has traditionally begun. It also includes an integrated review of what anthropology tradition- ally considers. More and more anthropologists and forensic scientists are called upon to systematically interpret postmortem changes "from beginning to end," cutting across various fields of study. This is the first book which explores, explains and inter- prets all these aspects of postmortem change. Krogman, Wilton Marion &amp; Mehmet Yqsar i?can-- THE HUMAN SKELETON IN FORENSIC MEDI- CINE.

Through his organizational skills, his numerous books and articles, and not least through his exceptionally inspiring lectures he has ever since represented a major force in Norwegian anthropology. The contributors to this volume have shared the privilege of having had Fredrik Barth as their teacher, mentor and colleague. Barth's prolific writing has provided points of reference for most of the essays, and the very wide range of ethnographic descriptions and theoretical positions presented in the book attests to the universal applicability of Fredrik Barth's theoretical perspective. The editors, Reidar Grrnhaug, Gunnar Haaland and Georg Henriksen are professors at the University of Bergen, Department of Social Anthropology, a department which was founded and for many years headed by Fredrik Barth.

The authors of these well-crafted essays provide ethnographically rich documentation of a multiplicity of times and show how time as concept and resource is appropriated, institutionalized and legitimated in contests of power. Case studies include homeless people and Puerto Ricans in New York City, Romanian peasants and workers, middle-class Fijians, Israeli political party leaders, and bureaucrats in South Sulawesi, Indonesia.

Double Vision, the newest in the NAPA Bulletin series, is a reflective yet practical guide for anthropologists working or thinking of working with lawyers and for lawyers working or thinking of working with anthropologists. Written from the anthropologists' perspective, the book renders familiar the exotic culture of law, but attorneys may, with equal profit and pleasure, read it to gain insight into the exotic culture of anthropology.

The Tasaday Controversy: Assessing the Evidence Thomas N Headland, editor In 1971 a band of cave-dwelling people called Tasaday were discovered living in a remote area of rain forest in the Philippines. These 26 people were re- ported to be following a paleolithic lifestyle, surviving solely on wild foods, and wearing leaves for clothing. After the international flurry of news articles and TV films in the early 1970s, no further word was heard about the Tasaday for thirteen years. Then, in 1986, news reports suddenly flooded the interna- tional press claiming that the whole story had been a hoax. Are the world-famous Tasaday the most primitive people on Earth, one of the major anthropological discoveries of the century? Or were they the hoax of the decade? In this volume, 19 scholars, 9 of whom did fieldwork in the Tasaday area, present their differing views on this controversy. The volume shows that no simple resolution of the controversy has emerged. Whatever occurs in the future, however, it is vitally important that the existing evidence be made available for scrutiny and debate, and this is a major con- tribution of this collection of essays. $15.95 members; $19.95 all others 25% discount for orders of 10 or more Please enclose payment in U.S. funds with all orders American Anthropological Association 4350 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 640 Arlington, VA 22203 202/232-8800 285</page><page sequence="21">Available now-the 3 1st edition of the discipline's most frequently consulted professional and academic reference The 1992-93 AAA Guide A Guide to Departments A Directory of Members This latest edition of the annual AAA Guide lists 558 US and foreign anthro- pology departments in academic, community college and 2-year institutions, museums, research institutions, and government organizations, with details about "* degrees offered in anthropology "* degree requirements "* number of students in residence and degrees granted "* academic year system "* special resources and facilities "* faculty/staff names, degrees, ranks, and fields of specialization "* graduate support available Also included are more than 15 pages of tables giving "* degree information for individuals "* locations of academic departments listed and highest degree offered in anthropology "* levels of enrollment "* number of PhD degrees granted A listing of recent doctoral dissertations in anthropology is also included. 1992-93 AAA Guide $25 (members); $40 (all others) Please enclose payment, in US funds, with all orders American Anthropological Association 4350 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 640 Arlington, VA 22203 202/232-8800 286</page><page sequence="22">American Anthropological Association invites you to join The American Anthropological Association, founded in 1902 to advance anthropol- ogy in all its aspects, is the world's largest organization of individuals interested in anthropology.

The journal publishes articles, research reports, essays, commentaries, review articles, obituaries, and reviews of books, films, and exhibits. The views expressed are those of the authors and not neces- sarily those of the Association or its officers. Articles present significant research findings and theoretical analyses. Major new research in any area of anthropology is desired, as is research that integrates subdisciplinary perspectives. Manu- scripts should not generally exceed 40 double-spaced pages, including all figures, tables, references, and notes. Research reports are concise, and are topically narrower than major articles. Manu- scripts should not exceed 20 double-spaced pages, including all figures, tables, references, and notes. Essays discuss significant scholarly issues or present significant anthropological ideas in a variety of formats. Manuscript length may vary but should not exceed 40 double-spaced pages. Commentaries typically address topics raised in earlier articles. Manuscript length is 1-10 double- spaced pages. Book, film, and exhibit reviews, and review articles, are solicited by the editors; scholars who wish to write a review may identify themselves to the Editor-in-Chief or a member of the Advisory Ed- itorial Council. Those who wish to review films or museum exhibits should contact the appropriate editor at the address listed below. Five copies of all manuscripts are required for review. Scholars from countries where there is limited access to copying facilities may submit one copy. Authors may use either 8 1/2" x 11" or A4 paper (please do not send double-sided copies). Authors may submit a copy of their manuscript on disk. Disk copies must be accompanied by five hard copies. Any standard format for style, notes, and references is suitable for editorial consideration.
