<plain_text><page sequence="1">'Atiqot 55,2007 Tel Hazor: Areas Q (The Eastern Spur) and N Karen Covello-Paran In the years 1995 and 2000 limited excavations were carried out at Tel Hazor in Area Q, on the eastern spur of the Lower City (map ref. NIG 3193/7039, OIG 2693/2039), and in Area N, adjacent to the archaeological museum in Ayyelet Ha-Shahar (map ref. NIG 25380/76977, OIG 20380/26977).' AREAQ In advance of the erection of new electric pylons on a north-south axis east of a major road and water pipe, four areas were excavated at the eastern spur of the Lower City of Tel Hazor (Figs. 1, 2). These probes are identified as subareas of Area Q.2 In area Q1, remains of a twentieth century CE cemetery were penetrated to the maximal depth of 2 m required for the electric pylon foundations. Since these graves disturbed the archaeological remains of the Fig. 1. Location map. Fig. 2. Areas of excavation.</page><page sequence="2">Karen Covello-Paran Lower City in this area, the excavations could not determine the maximum depth nor the nature of the archaeological deposits. Conceivably, more well-preserved architectural finds may be below the maximum depth of the excavation. Probe Q4 revealed discarded pottery from previous expeditions at the maximum depth of the probe. In only two of the probes, Q2 and Q3, were archaeological levels reached and excavated. Area Q2 (Plan 1) This excavation area covered 72 sq m. Part of a courtyard building was exposed: Courtyard 120 and three contiguous rooms, LI29, LI 18, and LI42 (Fig. 3). Three local building phases spanning LB I were discerned. The building may date to the end of MB II. The structure was constructed partly on bedrock and partly on virgin soil. Post-Late Bronze Age disturbances or intrusions in this area were limited to pits or installations dug by the inhabitants of the nineteenth century CE village of Waqqas, located just south of Area Q2. Phase I Evidence for Phase I, the initial building phase, was only ascertained in the easternmost room, LI33. This narrow room, c. 1 m wide, is bordered by W125, W140 and W131 (Fig. 4). Wall 140 is an earlier stage of W107, which abutted both W125 and W131, each preserved to a height of 1.2 m; W125 and W131 each had two superimposed stages. Phase II of these walls was erected directly above Phase I, with only a slight western protuberance discernible of the earlier W145 below Phase II W131. The full plan of the Phase I building could not be determined since the excavation did not continue west of W125 below Phase II. Presumably, the Phase I structure established the general orientation of the structure attributed to Phase II; however, there is no direct evidence to support this. No distinct floor level of this phase was reached. Phase II The most complete excavated building plan is attributed to Phase II. Courtyard'120 was bordered in the south by three rooms: LI 18, L141 and L142. Courtyard 120 had an 8 cm thick plaster floor, laid above a cobbled bedding (9 cm thick) of limestone and basalt (Fig. 5). Notable is a small (2.5 x 3.0 cm) fragment from a fresco or painted plaster wall bearing red paint that was found in the bedding of the courtyard floor L120 (Fig. 8:13). י- ־■. י - •י4;. , •י4 KM A ;.

Courtyard 120 with cobbled stone foundation. Fig. 6. Area Q2. Drainage Channel 126, northern probe. Incorporated into this cobbled stone foundation were the cover-stones of two stone-built drainage channels, L126 and L136; both channels were partially covered by the plaster floor. Drainage Channel 126—the main channel—extends northward beyond the excavated area. It traversed southward toward and below Entrance 114 of Room 118; its southern end was not exposed. In the northern part of the excavated area we investigated the construction of Channel 126, revealing two stone walls 0.5 m apart and 0.5 m high, topped by flat cover-stones; the floor of the channel consisted in part of a layer of small stones above sterile soil and in part of natural bedrock (Fig. 6). Directly inside this probe of the drainage channel lay a broken cooking pot (Fig. 9:1), an almost complete dipper juglet (Fig. 9:3), a basalt pestle and rubbing stone fragments, and some small burnt stones. Only the cover</page><page sequence="5">Tel Hazor: Areas Q (The Eastern Spur) and N 2V stones of Channel 136 were exposed where it branched off from Channel 126 toward Room 141, suggesting that it drained the western part of this building. West of W109 (Phase III) only fragments of the plaster courtyard floor (LI 16) were preserved above the cobbled foundation, ending in a straight line abutting the small stone floor of Room 129. The center room, LI 18, measured 3.0 * 3.5 m and had two openings. The main entrance, LI 14, between W108 and W107, led into the room from Courtyard 120. The second, smaller entrance, threshold L143, was in the southeastern corner, between W125 and W130, and connected to Room 142. The floor of Room 118 was stone-paved, incorporating rows of flat limestone slabs in addition to basalt orthostats with slightly broken corners. These rows of stones were placed within a frame of small, thin, rectangular stones placed on their side that lined the walls. In the northwestern corner of the floor was a large limestone slab (0.9 m wide, 1.2 m long and 0.4 m high) with a hewn squarish hole cutting through the stone (see Fig. 3). This hole was found blocked by a medium-sized stone. A single carnelian bead (Fig. 10:12) was found inside the hole. The secondary use of this stone as an integral part of the floor pavement, in addition to the basalt orthostats, suggests an earlier monumental building in this part of the site prior to Phase II. A relatively small quantity of pottery sherds (Fig. 10) was found above the pavement alongside W112. The opening into the eastern adjoining room, LI42, led over the stone-built threshold LI43. East of this threshold, only a fragment of the floor composed of small stones, LI42, was preserved. Interred below the conjectured floor height were two storage-jar burials, T133A and T133B. The jars lay against each other above a hard-packed surface (Fig. 4) at the deepest level of excavation. T133A (Fig. 7:1) contained fragmentary bones of a small child,3 a juglet (Fig. 7:2), and a lamp (Fig. 7:3). No human bones were found in the second storage-jar burial T133B (Fig. 7:4), which only contained a small bichrome ware sherd (Fig. 7:5). Three additional bowls (Fig. 7:6-8), found alongside the burials, are probably associated grave goods. The complete storage jar used for burial T133B (Fig. 7:4) is identical in form and dimensions to a jar from Hazor Area K Stratum 2 (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCXC:1). This parallel indicates that these burials were probably post-Phase I and represent the later interments below a Phase II floor that was not preserved in this area. Walls 112, 138 and 137 enclose a smaller room, L141, southwest of the central room. In the southwestern corner of this room was a small stone-built installation, LI44. Patches of a plaster floor, L141, were found alongside the small stone Floor 129. There may have been successive reflooring activities in this room between which we were not able to distinguish during the excavation, and LI29 may overlay L141. Phase III A single wall, W109, is evidence of modifica tions to this courtyard building in its last phase. Wall 109 abutted the northwestern end of W108 and continued north beyond the excavated area. This narrow wall was constructed of two rows of medium-sized stones with a fill of small stones. It clearly overlay a 20 cm buildup of debris over the plaster floor of Courtyard 120 and Floor 116, indicating that these floors were no longer in use at the time. The lowermost level ofW109 at elevation 198.08 m corresponding to the elevation level of LI29, may suggest that this stone floor was the foundation for an earthen floor that was not preserved. The addition of this wall may indicate that the function of the southwestern area of the building was altered during this phase. No floor levels were found directly abutting W109. It is not clear whether the Phase II stone pavement of Room 118 was still used, or whether a beaten-earth floor (not detected during the excavation) was laid above the stone pavement. It is plausible that the intentional blockage of the hole in the large stone in the northwestern</page><page sequence="6">22* Karen Covello-Paran corner of Room 118 can be attributed to this phase and may indicate a raised floor level. The Finds The continuous occupation of the building, combined with its abandonment, resulted in sparse finds that can be securely associated with a particular stratigraphie phase. The only fully restorable vessels are the storage jars used for the Phase II burials T133A and T133B. The pottery and other finds are presented together in the accompanying figures according to room. In light of the ongoing extensive excavations at the site, with more well-preserved assemblages, the following discussion will not contain a comprehensive list of parallels, but will rather establish a stratigraphie correlation with other areas at Hazor. Pottery The majority of the vessel types presented are common at Hazor and are dated to the LB I horizon known from Stratum 2, for example Area H (Yadin et al. 1961: Pis. CCLXI CCLXIX). Bowls.— Open shallow bowls with simple rims; one of the bowls has a thick flat base. The slip and burnish is either on the interior (Fig. 8:1), on the interior sides and outer lip (Fig. 10:1), or on the entire interior and exterior surfaces (Fig. 8:2). Similar bowls are known from LB I levels at Area F (Yadin et al. 1961:13) and Area H Stratum 2 (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCLXII: 1-9). Two carinated bowl fragments were found in Room 142. The smaller bowl (Fig. 11:1) is similar to LB I-dated bowls from Areas F (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCXL:19-21) and H Stratum 2 (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCLXIIL7-9,13). One of the carinated bowls is quite large (Fig. 11:2). A small votive bowl has rounded walls, and the flat base is not well preserved (Fig. 12:1). The bowls from the temple complex in Area H Stratum 2 exhibit the various sizes and forms of small votive bowls (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCLXIX: 1-20). Goblet.— A fragment of a goblet (Fig. 8:8) with painted decoration in red and dark brown was found in Courtyard 120. The upper part of the goblet above the carination features painted solid lines between which appear zigzag or wavy lines; below the carination are vertical lines. A wavy line is also at the inner lip of the vessel. Painted goblets are more commonly known in LB II levels at Hazor—e.g., Area C Stratum IB (Yadin et al. 1960: Pl. CXVIII: 28-29), and Area H Strata IB and 1A (Yadin et al. 1961: Pis. CCLXXIII:9-13; CCLXXX:6-8). Cooking Vessels.— The cooking pot with the rounded rim and mid-vessel carination found in the drainage channel L126 (Fig. 9:1) has parallels from the late MB II Stratum 3 in Area C (Yadin et al. 1960: Pl. CX:12, 13), and Area H Stratum 2 (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCLXV:4). A unique cooking bowl with a ledge handle at the rim (Fig. 10:5) was produced from ware typically used for cooking pots, i.e., red-brown clay with black and white quartz inclusions. Kraters.— Several large krater sherds were found in Rooms 118 (Fig. 10:2^1) and 141 (Fig. 12:2). Comparable kraters, also of very large dimensions and with modeled rims, are known from Area H Stratum 2 (Yadin et al. 1961:14-18). Storage Vessels.— Of the storage-jar burials T133A and B (Fig. 7:1, 4), the completely restorable jar from burial T133B (Fig. 7:4) has a flaring rim, an elliptical body and a small round base. An identical jar is known from Area K Stratum 2 (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCXC:1). A pithos rim (Fig. 8:6) has a thick folded ledge rim. A body sherd of an additional pithos (Fig. 10:8) has an incised band along the shoulder at the joint of the neck and the shoulder of this large vessel. Jugs/Juglets.— The dipper juglet from burial T133 A (Fig. 7:2) has a pinched rim, an elongated neck, and is similar to a juglet from a Stratum 2 Burial 8147 from Hazor Area F (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCXLI:9).</page><page sequence="7">Tel Hazor: Areas Q (The Eastern Spur) and N 23* Stands.— A number of sherds from stands have applied bands with herringbone-incised decoration (Fig. 10:9, 10). Similar stands are known from Area H Strata 2 and 1B (Yadin et al. 1961: Pis. CCLXVII, CCLXXVI: 11-16). Decorated Ware.— In the presented assemblage are pottery vessels or sherds bearing painted decoration typical of LB I, e.g., Bichrome ware, and other painted LB types (see above according to typology) that are known from both LB I and II levels at Hazor. One sherd with red and brown painted decoration that is typical of LB I-II is probably from a biconical jug (Fig. 8:10) with a straight-sided profile. An additional sherd (Fig. 8:9) has dark brown decoration of two solid lines with a wavy band in between. These types of decorations are known from a variety of vessel types including bowls, kraters, goblets, and jars at Hazor, e.g., in Areas C, H, and K Stratum II and IB (Yadin et al. 1960: Pis. CXVI:24, 26; CXIX:2, 3; CXX:15-20; 1961: Pis. CCLXIV:12; CCXCL18). Bichrome Ware.— Bichrome ware (Figs. 7:5; 8:4, 7) stands out among the sherds of painted vessels, chiefly found in the courtyard area (L120). These vessels, important for the dating of the Area Q2 structure to LB I, include a bowl and a krater. Parallels for the Bichrome ware at Hazor are found in Area A Stratum XV (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CLVIL33), Area H Stratum 2 (Yadin et al. 1961 : Pl. CCLX1X:34, 35), Area F LB I (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCXLIIL23). Chocolate-on-White Ware.— A few sherds (not illustrated) from the body of a Chocolate-on White vessel were found in this area below the plaster Floor 120. These sherds are thin and of very light clay with a high-quality burnish. Miscellaneous Small Finds Bead.— An elongated carnelian bead (Fig. 10:12) has identical parallels from Area H Stratum IB (Yadin et al. 1961:15-19). Bone.— A carved bone object (Fig. 12:3), possibly an inlay, is similar in shape to a bone object from Area C Stratum IB (Yadin et al. 1960: Pl. CXXVII:29). Zoomorphic Figurine.— The painted hom of a ceramic zoomorphic figurine (Fig. 8:11) was found in Courtyard 120. A zoomorphic figurine portraying a horned animal (Mycenaean IIIB) was found in the Stratum 1A level at Hazor Area H (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCLXXXII:14). Anthropomorphic(?) Object.— A fragment of a unique pottery object (Fig. 10:11) shows part of an arm and a hand that is attached to a bowl-like receptacle with a pinched rim. The fragmentary nature of this sherd does not permit a more detailed description nor allow for extensive parallels, however, this object is generally reminiscent of the Egyptian bowls with anthropomorphic figures with extended arms. Alabastron.— An alabastron fragment (Fig. 13) was found between the stones of W131 indicating its secondary use as a filler 'stone' of this wall and therefore originating in pre-Phase II. A similar, small-sized elongated alabastron found in Area F is attributed to MB II (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCXLIV:13).</page><page sequence="8">24* Karen Covello-Paran i 7 \ 0 2 2T 10 _l Fig. 7.

The red painted plaster fragment is further evidence of the public nature of this building. Of the features mentioned above, it is the pairing of the basalt orthostat floor and the large slab with the squarish hole that are paralleled in the monumental architecture exposed in Area M in the renewed Selz Foundation Hazor Excavations in Memory of Yigael Yadin directed by Prof. A. Ben-Tor.4 The drainage channels below the floors indicate preplanning—a well known occurrence at Hazor. The initial erection of this courtyard building, Phase I, probably dates to the end of MB II. The walls of the Phase II occupation, LB I, were superimposed above the Phase I plan, indicating a continuity between these two stages. The architectural continuity between the MB II and LB I levels is a recognized feature at Hazor, especially observable in Areas A, H, and P (Yadin et al. 1961:223; Bonfil 1997:25, 42; Mazar 1997:382). The level of the bedrock and the sterile soil beneath Phase I seemingly negate the existence of any previous occupation level in the excavated squares of Area Q2. The building was probably abandoned within the late LB I horizon. The correlation of the courtyard building to the stratigraphie framework of the Lower City, established by the James de Rothschild Expedition at Hazor, places the local Phase II within the Stratum 2 horizon. This is based on the pottery assemblage presented above, which includes chronologically diagnostic types, such as the Bichrome ware. The possibility that this structure was initially erected during late MB II or Stratum 3, is based on fragmentary evidence due to the limitations of the excavation and the small exposure of the local Phase III. The previous excavations at the eastern spur, in Area P, exposed a city gate and a public building attached to it. According to Mazar, this gate served as the main entry to the governmental and administrative area of Hazor that was located at the Upper City (Mazar 1997:354). In light of the present excavations, and the associated parallels with the material culture from other areas, it is probable that the eastern spur of the Lower City, Area Q2, also had a public or administrative function. Area Q3 (Plan 2) Area Q3 is located at the northern edge of the eastern spur, 10 m east of Area P (Mazar 1997) and 50 m west of Dunayevsky and KempinskFs excavation (1990: Plan 1: Section B-B). From the start of the excavation it was evident that the 2 x 4 m probe was situated in the center of the earthen ramparts surrounding the Lower City. The top meter of this probe was excavated manually; the following two meters were removed with a pneumatic backhoe.5 All debris removed from this probe was dry sieved. The small dimensions of the probe provided but limited information on the construction technique of the ramparts in this area. Five sloping layers were discerned (Plan 2; Fig. 14; Table 1). Layers I, III, and V contained many tabun fragments, animal bones, and large quantities of pottery sherds, indicating that in this area the debris used for constructing the ramparts originated from previous occupation levels. Due to the small area of the excavation, neither the angle nor extent of the slope could be ascertained. Moreover, the probe did not 3.00.. 1 S ,11 \ ־־* ^ : — I \ V J&gt;^T; VI i Plan 2.

Finds (Figs. 15, 16) Pottery The pottery inside the sloping layers of the fill was mixed and included small quantities of sherds from both EB II and EB III (including Metallic Ware and Khirbat Kerak Ware sherds) and from the Intermediate Bronze Age. However, the bulk of the pottery can be dated to MB II. In light of the debate over the construction date of the ramparts, only the latest pottery, i.e., the MB II, is presented in the accompanying figures. The parallels for the vessel types will be intrasite where possible. However, there are insufficient MB IIA, MB I1A/IIB, and early MB 1IB pottery assemblages for comparisons with the present assemblage. The MB IIA assemblages from previous excavations at Hazor have been identified by Beck (2000:247) and Maeir (1997:332, n. 107), as well as the comprehensive publication of the Area L MB IIA/B T1181 (Maeir 1997). Bowls.— The small, closed carinated bowls (Fig. 15:1-7) are either without surface treatment or have a red burnished slip. These bowls are dated to MB IIA, although the plain bowls may be more typical of MB IIA/B transition. Similar bowls are known at Hazor Area A Stratum XVII (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CLVI:18, 19), Area BA Stratum 14 (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCXXXV:21-24), Area G MB II (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCXLVI:4-9) and Area LTil81 (Maeir 1997:7, 8). Open platter bowls (Fig. 15:8-10) have slightly incurving rounded sides, or straight sides with either red burnished slip on the interior surface and exterior rim (Fig. 15:8, 9), or with a plain surface (Fig. 15:10). Kraters.— Kraters with profiled and grooved rims (Fig. 15:11-15) have either rounded or slightly carinated sides (Fig. 15:11, 12) or straighter walls (Fig. 15:13-15). Similarly profiled rimmed kraters, also exhibiting such variations, are known from Hazor from MB IIA contexts at Area A Stratum XVII (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl.

According to Dunayevsky and Kempinski (1990:27, Fig. 1:5, 6), these kraters, also found in the ramparts of Section A, originate from Syria and are dated to MB IIA. Cooking Pots.— The straight-sided, handmade cooking pot (Fig. 16:1) is more typical of MB IIA assemblages and is found in Hazor Area BA Stratum 15 (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCXXXV: 12-14). Small Jars.— Of the small jars (Fig. 16:3-7), notable is the jar with the concave rim (Fig. 16:4), most likely from a handleless vessel. Storage Vessels.— Storage vessels include jars with an elongated folded rim (Fig. 16:8-11). Similar jars are known from Area A Stratum XVII (Yadin et al. 1961 : Pl. CLVI:26), Area BA Stratum 15 (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCXXXV:18, 19) and Area G MB II (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CCXLVT14, 15). Pithos.— A single pithos (Fig. 16:12) has a molded rectangular rim and a wide mouth. Jugs.— Among the jugs (Fig. 16:13, 14, 16) is the lower body of a vessel that bears red burnished slip on the base (Fig. 16:13). Levantine Painted Ware.— An important chronological peg is the sherd (Fig. 16:15) decorated with horizontal bands on the shoulder and mid-body of the jug. Thick black bands enclose thinner red bands, and the upper band zone also has vertical thin black bands that divide it into metopes. This vessel is apparently</page><page sequence="17">Tel Hazor: Areas Q (The Eastern Spur) and N 33* ? 4 i I ־7־^ 16 r־f=rw .■m, ) ן —1 rTf"7 Ffl .^T7 יי י •1^י / 8 f ז 14 / 0 10 0 2 1 1 1 1 1 Fig. 16.

It would appear that the present pottery assemblage found in the successive layers of the ramparts contains vessel types known primarily, although not exclusively, in MB IIA and MB IIA/B contexts at the site. There is a decided lacuna of vessel types known from primary MB IIB intrasite contexts at Hazor Stratum 3— e.g., open carinated bowls, triangular rimmed cooking pots, and profiled-rim storage jars.

A fragment of a limestone weapon mold (Fig. 15:17) was found in the topsoil of Area Q3. An almost identical mold was found at Hazor Area A Stratum XVII (Yadin et al. 1961: Pl. CLVI:30).6 Discussion The small dimensions of the present excavation do not enable a thorough discussion of construction methods. Dunayevsky and Kempinsky (1990:25-26), in their excavations of Sections A-A and B-B, found that the ramparts of Hazor do not show uniform construction methods; this observation is supported by the present excavation. The alternating layers of light and dark fills observed in this probe recall sloping layers detected in Section B-B that is located 50 m to the east (Dunayevsky and Kempinsky 1990:25-26). Since the present probe was not wide or deep enough, it did not reveal whether these layers abutted a brick or stone core in the south. The adjacent excavations at Area P exposed a six-pier gate abutted on the southern side by a system of well-constructed stone terraces that connected between the gate and the earthen city ramparts (Mazar 1997:365-368)—which seem to be those exposed in the present excavation. Unfortunately, the area between Area P and the present excavation was subjected to repeated modern disturbances, thus preventing a fuller examination of the connection between the stone terraces and the ramparts. While the dimensions of the probe limit the information on construction methods of the ramparts, the pottery assemblage contained in the earthen layers is ofprimary importance for dating their construction, a matter that is still subject to debate (for a recent review see Maeir 1997: 317-319). In addition to the pottery sherds, also retrieved from the rampart layers were tabun fragments, animal bones, and patches of burnt organic material, all of which indicate their source from previous occupational levels. The pottery sherds retrieved in Probe Q3 are mostly dated to MB IIA and transitional MB IIA/IIB, similarly to the sherds from Sections A-A and B-B (Dunayevsky and Kempinski</page><page sequence="19">Tel Hazor: Areas Q (The Eastern Spur) and N 35s1 1990:27-28). If this pottery assemblage is used as a terminus post quem, then the ramparts post-date the MB IIA or MB IIA/B transition. If the same assemblage is assumed as a terminus ad quem, the rampart construction originated during this period. The excavation exposed the uppermost layers of the ramparts. These layers might represent later repair phases of the ramparts, which would suggest that the initial fortifications are to be ascribed firmly within the MB IIA. However, this assumption has yet to be upheld by archaeological evidence. While this is still inconclusive, the Hazor ramparts clearly were not built during the early part of the MB IIA period, but most likely during the MB IIA/B transition, or in the early part of MB IIB. According to Mazar (1997:382-384), the first phase of the Area P gate is correlated with Stratum 4 of the Lower City, i.e., MB IIB. In Yadin et al. 1961:169-170, Yadin correlates the evidence of fortifications in the different excavation areas of the Lower City and suggests that they were all built during the 'earliest of a series of MB II strata... In summary, whether the settlement debris found in the ramparts originated from the Upper City or from the Lower City of Hazor is not determinable. The debris matrix infers extraction from nearby stratified deposits of previous occupations during EB III, the Intermediate Bronze Age, and late MB IIA. The former two periods correspond with Strata XX XIX and XVIII, respectively, from the Upper City.7 The later MB IIA period or transitional MB IIA/B is collectively titled "pre-Stratum XVII". The large quantities of settlement debris from the ramparts dated to this period can be added to the numerous isolated assemblages from both the Upper and Lower City which are firmly dated to either MB IIA or the transitional MB IIA/B continuum (Maier 1997: n. 107). AreaN The excavations in Area N, located near the Hazor Museum at Kibbutz Ayyelet Ha-Shahar, revealed two architectural elements some 35 m apart: a drainage channel and a rampart system. In the trench dug between these elements, no archaeological elements or material were exposed. AreaNI (Plan 3) A single square (5 x 5 m) was excavated, exposing a stone-built channel some 2 m below the modern surface. The channel (L101; 45 cm wide interior) was constructed of two stone walls (four to five courses, 0.3 m wide, 0.6-0.7 m high) with a roofing of large limestone and 173 Sterile Brown Soil Deposit with bones, sherds, small stones (light brown) Plan 3.

Above the roofing stones was a packed layer of crushed limestone covered by a 2 m conglomerate of large basalt pebbles.

Directly overlying this deposit and reaching the roofing stones was a ־ י :•'" ♦י ^י" .v 51?־:'v.' ' י&gt;-&lt;H Vז ■ '*"3•* - : - ־ '־. ^ .'• ־* י .,- י' ־ L ־ ־י ?wBaSii £צ■.;; ■ י ־'_י . 1.

In other words, were the channels subterranean or were they partially above the surface? The geological assessment by A. Matmon8 elaborated the construction process of the channels. The geological stratigraphy (Table 2) revealed that the channels were dug through Units II and III and that the base of the channel was above Unit IV. Material from Unit II was both packed into the foundation trench and above the channel, indicating that the channel was intentionally covered with the conglomerates from Unit II. If the channel had been dug before Unit II, the strong current of this unit would have damaged or even destroyed the channel. Finds (Fig. 18) Only a few pottery sherds were retrieved from the channel, including two small bowls (Fig. 18:1, 2), a Chocolate-on-White jar (Fig. 18:3), a cooking pot (Fig. 18:4), and a juglet with a double coiled handle (Fig. 18:5). Although the sparse finds do not allow for a well-founded chronological determination, these pottery vessels can apparently be placed within the MB II horizon. The sherds exhibited signs of water erosion, indicating that they are not in situ. Yadin dated the channels previously excavated in Area N to MB 1IB, which correlates with his date for the construction of the fortification system of the Lower City. Table 2.

Finds from drainage channel L101. Discussion The function of this channel is undoubtedly connected with the network of underground channels exposed by Yadin that were also found c. 2 m below the present surface (1969:8; 1972:65-66; 1975:74—75).9 It is probable that the channel from the present excavation joined one of Yadin's channels located c. 15 m to the east.10 The construction of the previously excavated channels is identical to that of the present excavation (see photo in Yadin 1975:75). Yadin dated these channels to the MB IIB fortified city and claimed that they served as a drainage system for the Lower City, and also possibly as an irrigation system for the neighboring fields similar to those found in Mesopotamia (Yadin 1969:8). The drainage function of the channels is not disputed; how ever, the extensive construction efforts for digging these channels do not seem justified by local agricultural practices, which most likely relied on the winter rains. The drainage channels in Area N may have been part of the preplanning measures noted in almost every excavated area of the tell beneath both domestic and public buildings—e.g., Area C Strata 4-3 (Yadin et al. 1960:78); Area L MB IIC Stratum XVI, LI 170 (Garfinkel 1997: Plan III. 12); Area M (A. Ben-Tor and S. Zuckerman, pers. comm., 2003). The channels of Area N1 should be reexa mined in light of the rampart system in Area N2 exposed c. 35 m north of the channel. If this rampart was constructed contemporaneously with the drainage channels, the drainage channels must have been dug as part of the preplanning for an additional area of the Lower City. Area N2 (Plan 4) Approximately 35 m north of the Area N1 drainage channel, the modern trench exposed a stone-built wall (W202) and multiple sloping layers containing pottery and bones. The wall and the layers are part of an earthen embankment located c. 300 m north of the excavated ramparts of Area P (above). The excavation of this embankment included a</page><page sequence="22">38* Karen Covello-Paran 173.00 All small pebbles 204 ^^~-_____Lotsof bones pottery ^־\ Dark brown 0 Light brown \ 172.00 206 \ Brown with white specks^־־-^ ^ 171.00 Topsoil dark brown Plan 4.

At the 'core' of this embankment was a three course wall (W202) constructed of a single row of large boulders (Plan 4). This wall was not the foundation for a superstructure, but separated two sets of abutting multiple sloping layers. The following description of the construction of the embankment is divided into two parts: north of W202, and south of it. A stone revetment, L201, directly abuts W202 on the south (Fig. 19). Locus 201 is composed of medium to large basalt and limestone fieldstones laid in sloping courses descending northward toward the bottom of W202. Locus 201 was abutted on the south by a sloping layer of crushed limestone (L205). Both L201 and L205 were laid above the surface soil at the time of construction." The order of construction south of W202 showed the following sequence: first W202 was built, followed by L201, and finally by the sloping layer of L205. North of W202 and abutting it was a hard packed stone matrix, L204, containing many pottery sherds and animal bones. A probe was excavated c. 1 m north of W202 in order to investigate L204 and additional sloping layers (Fig. 20). The resultant layers are presented from top to bottom in Table 3. The only layers which abutted W202 are Layers I and II (L203, L204), indicating that these layers were 'spilled' first and that W202 was placed above layer L207, following which Layers I and II were laid. These sloping layers continued at least another 15 m north Table 3.

Nonetheless, the Tell el-Yehudiyeh sherd is instrumental for a chronological determination of the assemblage toward the end of MB II A, or perhaps even to the transitional MB IIA/B.</page><page sequence="25">Tel Hazor: Areas Q (The Eastern Spur) and N 41* Discussion The date and construction methods of the embankment are similar to the ramparts exposed in Area Q3 (above) and Sections A-A and B-B of Dunayevsky and Kempinski (1990). This small excavation in Area N2 indicates that there were additional fortification/boundary features surrounding the inhabited Lower City. Possibly, both excavated features in Area N, the drainage channels and the embankment, were foundation works for an extension of the Lower City of Hazor. The investment in manpower coupled with organizational aspects of the construction of both of these features imply their connection with the Lower City—most likely contemporaneous with the building of the Lower City, or perhaps as a later extension.13 The direction of the core W202 is aligned in a southwest-northeast direction that could possibly connect between the western Lower City and the eastern spur. The modern topography reveals a descent in the modern road north of the excavated embankment in Area N, conceivably reflecting a man-made topography from then until now hidden by earthen embankments or ramparts in this area. Conclusions The series of small excavations presented above, at Areas Q and N, illuminated issues regarding the nature and chronology of the eastern Lower City of Tel Hazor during MB II and LB I. The present excavations revealed architectural elements in the eastern spur (Area Q) that attest to this area of the Lower City as having public or administrative buildings dating to the end of MB II, rebuilt during LB I, and abandoned some time toward the end of LB I. The excavations also provided evidence (Area Q2) for the use of basalt orthostats, and therefore of monumental architecture prior to Stratum 3 of the Lower City. The excavations also reached bedrock, indicating the depth of the archaeological deposits in the eastern Lower City. The probe into the ramparts adjacent to Area P (Area Q3) and the associated pottery assemblage provided data for dating the fortifications of the eastern spur of the Lower City to the transitional MB IIA/B stage at the earliest. Moreover, the planning efforts noted in Area N by the rampart fortification and extensive drainage channels contribute to the evidence for a high level of urbanism at Hazor during MB II—most likely the result of its role as a major international center having extensive connections with northern polities during this period (see Maeir 2000). The construction of drainage channels, revealed in Areas Q2 and N, is a noted phenomenon at Hazor and is originally connected with the MB II construction activities at the site. The present excavation emphasizes the necessity for more probes beyond the "city wall" in order to more fully comprehend the immediate surroundings and development of major urban sites during the Bronze Age, such as Hazor. Notes 1 The author directed two separate seasons of excavation on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. The first season at Area Q (Permit No. A-2345) took place from July to August 1995 in connection with the installation of four electrical pylons and was financed by the Israel Electric Company. The second season at Area N (Permit No. A-3249) was carried out in July 2000 due to trenching activities of the Israel Water Company 'Mekorot'. Additional participants were Yossi Yaakobi (administration), Howard Smithline (photography), Israel Stark, Israel Vatkin, Pavel Gertopsky, Vadim Essman (surveying), Leea Porat (pottery restoration), and Gila Midbari and Hagit Tahan-Rosen (drawing of finds). The author thanks Ari Matmon (The Hebrew University and Geological Survey of Israel)</page><page sequence="26">42* Karen Covello-Paran for geological consultations, and Ruhama Bonfil (The Hebrew University) for assistance with the surveying. 2 The author thanks Prof. Amnon Ben-Tor for including the present probes within the area assignations at Tel Hazor and for his helpful comments on an earlier version of this manuscript. 3 Leslie Schnall of the IAA identified the bones, including a jaw fragment, as those of a child 2-3 years old. 4 Sharon Zuckerman supervised the excavations in Area M. Her preliminary research indicates that the basalt orthostat floor is the entry room of a palace (pers. comm., 2003). 5 The depth of the probe was limited to that needed for the foundations of the electric pylon. 6 The pottery sherds found with this mold in L382c are dated to MB IIAby Maeir (1997:332, n. 107). 7 Only a handful of sherds dated to these periods was found in the rampart matrix. This clearly contrasts with the larger quantities of MB II pottery. 8 I am grateful to Ari Matmon of the Geological Survey of Israel for his consultation. 9 The field notes and plans from the excavation of this area were lost (see Ben-Tor 1997:11-12). 10The author thanks Hussein El-Heib of the National Parks Authority who pointed out the course of one of Yadin's channels that he personally covered with debris. 11Geologist Ari Matmon identified this dark brown level as an ancient surface or topsoil. 12The continuation of the Mekorot trench cut through the rampart for another 15 m. Unfortunately, the trench was filled before proper documentation could be carried out. 13In archival records of the Israel Antiquities Authority, in a letter dated 1963, the regional Department of Antiquities inspector, Netanel Tefilinsky, notes that during the course of the construction of the regional school, adjacent to the Hazor Museum and Area N, a 10 m long 'ancienT wall was exposed. Baruch Hofri, who later supervised the excavations of the Area N channels, dated the pottery sherds associated with this wall to the Middle Bronze Age. References Bagh T. 2000.
