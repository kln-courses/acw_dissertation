<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss: An Introduction to Za-ology DAVID FARRELL KRELL University of Essex —Aber Lebendige machen alle den Fehler, daß sie zu stark unterscheiden. R. M. Rilke, Duino Elegy, no. 1 Twenty years ago, as I began to translate at John Sallis's behest Heideg ger's essay "Logos: Heraclitus Β 50," I was struck by the story Heidegger takes over from Aristotle, the story about Heraclitus warming himself at a stove. And about those frustrated tourists who had come to catch a glimpse of a thinker in action but were chagrined to find him engaged in the undignified activity of warming his . . . well, warming some part of himself, Aristotle does not say which part, and if Heidegger knows he refuses to tell, although ancient rumor has it that Heraclitus was warming some part of his body. Heidegger recounts this story in his "Letter on Humanism" as a response to an observation by Jean Beaufret, whom Heidegger quotes as follows: "Ce que je cherche ä faire, depuis longtemps dejä, c'est preciser le rapport de l'ontologie avec une ethique possible." "What I have been trying to do, for a long time now, is to spell out the relationship between ontology and a possible ethics.'" In the ensuing discussion Heidegger cites fragment Β 119 of Heraclitus, in which the word ήθος appears. He cites that fragment presumably because he does not have time to recite the tragedies of Sophocles, which "in their saying shelter the ήθος in a more pristine form [anfänglicher] than do Aristotle's lectures on 'Ethics'" (W, 184; BW, 232-3). *Ηθος άνθρώπφ δαίμων. "Human beings dwell, inso far as they are human, in the nearness of god." Der Mensch wohnt, insofern er Mensch ist, in der Nähe Gottes (W, 185; BW, 233). 23</page><page sequence="2">24 David Farrell Krell Heidegger now narrates the story, eine Geschichte, that agrees with, or is in accord with, stimmt zusammen mit, the saying of Heraclitus, the story that Aristotle "reports," though certainly not in his lectures on ethics. Heidegger cites the source but says not a word about it: De partibus animalium, book 1, chapter 5, 645a 17.2 Heidegger reproduces the story in Greek, along with a translation unmistakably his own, which we might render as follows: Concerning Heraclitus the tale is told of what he said to some strangers who wanted to approach him. As they drew near they saw him warming himself at an oven. They stood stock-still, especially when he addressed a word of encouragement to them, those hesitant ones, inviting them to come in, with these words: "For here too gods come to presence [Auch hier nämlich wesen Götter an]." According to Heidegger, this tale retold betrays the squalor of the thinker's life, die ganze Dürftigkeit seines Lebens, even though a life in proximity to the δαίμων might well have been thought to be a splendid thing. I will not relate here what Heidegger makes of this story, "which speaks for itself," or of the saying about ήθος with which it supposedly accords.3 Instead, I want to recall what Heidegger says earlier in his "Letter" by way of response to Beaufret's first question, "Comment redonner un sens au mot 'Humanisme'?" "How can we once again render a sense to the word humanism?" (W, 147; BW, 195). There Heidegger discusses the traditional definition of human beings as ζφον λόγον έχον, animal rationale, the living being that has speech. Yet has it, presumably, not by virtue of its tongue or lips or ears, nor even its hands. Indeed, what could λόγος have to do with these parts, the (modified) parts of animals? In a gesture more than merely reminiscent of Aristotelian entelechy, Heidegger quite often insists that we do not hear because we have acoustical equipment, that is, ears; rather, he says, in Lamarckian fashion, we have ears because we hear. Who has hears to ear, let him ear!4 Yet how is it with the parts of animals? A word about the context of that Heraclitus story. Or, rather, the following extracts from book 1, chapter 5 of Aristotle, On the Parts of Living Beings: Of beings constituted by nature some are ungenerated and imperish able through all the aeons, while others share in generation and decay. The former are excellent beyond compare and are divine, though less accessible to study [θεωρία]. . . . The scanty grasp we have of celestial things gives us, on account of their excellence, more pleasure than all our information about the world in which we live,</page><page sequence="3">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 25 just as half a glimpse of persons we love is more delightful than a lingering view of other things. . . . And yet. . . the greater nearness and natural affinity to us [of terrestrial things] balances somewhat the loftier interest of philosophy in divine things [τά θεία].... We shall now proceed to treat of living creatures [περί της ζωικής φύσεως] without omitting . . . any of them, however ignoble. For if some of them have no graces to charm the sense, yet even these, by disclosing to our study the craftsmanship of the nature that designed them, give immense pleasure to all who can trace causes and are inclined to philosophy. Indeed, it would be absurd and out of place if those of us who are capable of discerning causes enjoyed examining likenesses [εικόνας] of these things—because of the paint er's or sculptor's craftsmanlike skill [τέχνη]—and yet did not take even more delight in the things themselves constituted by nature. We therefore must not recoil with childish aversion from the examination of the humbler animals. In everything that flourishes marvels are present [έν πασι γαρ τοις φυσικοϊς ένεστι τι θαυμαστόν]; and as Heraclitus, when the strangers came to visit him but found him warming himself at the stove in the kitchen and hesitated to go in, is reported to have bidden them not to be afraid to enter, since even in that kitchen5 divine things were present, so we should venture on the study of every kind of living being without being abashed; for each such being will reveal to us something burgeoning and beautiful [τινός φυσικού και καλού],... If anyone thinks the study of other living creatures an unworthy task, he must go one step further and despise study of himself. A few brief comments on this context. It begins with the familiar bifurcation of beings into two regions, one encompassing immutable, timeless beings, known by thought rather than sensation; the other em bracing beings that come to be and pass away in time, being concerning which our sensuous knowledge— έπιστήμη through αισθησις—is vaster, more complete and certain, if less edifying. Yet however much we love to glimpse the ethereal realm, which is like a beloved face to us, the face hidden in a crowd of stars,6 we are nearer to, πλησιαίτερα, and have greater affinity with, της φύσεως οικειότερα, things here below, of the earth; living beings, "animals," as we say. Question: The "greater nearness" that Aristotle cites—how does it compare with what Heidegger calls nearness to god?'Ηθος άνθρώπφ δαίμων. Is the δαίμων of all living beings a god, θεός? Is not the ethereal realm eminently godlike, and not the earthly region? How then can nearness to animals, the living beings of earth, be the "greater nearness,"</page><page sequence="4">26 David Farrell Krell the nearness that will "balance somewhat" our lust for lofty things? Or does the "greater nearness" here indicate remoteness from and nostalgia for crystal? Is "balance" here sheer ballast? Will not Aristotle himself appeal to crystalline transparency? Will he not rise on the divine afflatus of θεωρία in order that his researches can take off and leave behind whatever is repulsive to sensation? Are there not throughout Aristotle's text or palimpsest, the palimpsest of metaphysics, ethereal traces of demiurgic causation and formation, traces of the technique that designed living beings as though they were instruments? No doubt, it is as mimetic of τέχνη that living beings themselves should fascinate rather than repel us, us who trace causes. As though the stove were loftier than what it warms. Early in the "Letter on Humanism" Heidegger writes (W, 157; BW, 206): Of all the beings that are, presumably the most difficult to think are living creatures [das Lebe-Wesen], because on the one hand they are in a certain way most closely akin to us [uns . . .am nächsten verwandt], and on the other are at the same time separated from our ek-sistent essence [Wesen] by an abyss [durch einen Abgrund]. As opposed to them, it may also seem as though the essence of divinity were nearer to us than what is shockingly alien in living creatures [das Befremdende der Lebe Wesen\; nearer, namely, in an essential remoteness [Wesensferne] which, while remote, is nonetheless more familiar to our eksistent essence than our scarcely conceivable, abysmal bodily kinship with the beast. Allow me to pass over in silence the difficulties involved in translating all these Wesen Heidegger conjures: Lebe-Wesen, the "living creature" to which we are akin; ek-sistentes Wesen, the "essence" that "stands out" ecstatically into the clearing, the nothing, the granting of time and being; das Wesen des Göttlichen, the "essence"—or dare we say, once and for all, the "creature"—of the godlike, which, however ethereally remote it may be, seems more familiar, domestic, vertraut, "kitcheny," than what is so foreign, so alien, fremd/befremdend, in animals; and finally, Wesensferne, the "essential remoteness," "remoteness of essence" or—dare we say, and would it help to say—the "creaturely remoteness" or perhaps "haunting presence" by which what is near seems far, and far near.7 Let me instead focus on the "abyss" that gapes twice in these few lines of Heidegger's "Letter." However akin to us living beings may seem, they are "sepa rated" from us by an abyss, durch einen Abgrund.8 And yet, by a bizarre sort of doubling, this abyss of separation is now invoked to name the very</page><page sequence="5">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 27 proximity and affinity identified long ago by Aristotle, the nearness and kinship of the human and the bestial: abgründige leibliche Verwandtschaft, Heidegger writes. What about this abyss that separates us from the beasts? Who, us? We creatures of the Platonic χωρισμός? How do matters stand with an abyss of separation, a chasm, which at the same time marks an abysmal affinity, a chiasm? Is our bodily kinship with the beast abysmal precisely because Verwandtschaft (from verwenden) is one of those opposi tional Urworte, meaning both to turn away from and to turn toward, both a childish averting and a childlike adverting?9 The abyss that separates us from all other living beings and yet turns us toward them—is it the selfsame abyss that yawns in Dasein as "the (nihilative) being-the- ground of a nullity," das (nichtige) Grund-sein einer Nichtigkeit?'° Is it one of those "abysses" in which "profound boredom" drifts like "a muffling fog," removing "all things and human beings and oneself along with it into a remarkable indifference," thus revealing beings as a whole (W, 8; BW, 101)? Is it the selfsame abyss that causes Heidegger's later thinking to somersault beyond all grounds and reasons, the Ab-Grund that is a Satz vom Grund, the supreme play in which human beings—those who dwell "in nearness to death"—are at stake?" In a remarkable lecture course entitled "The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics: World - Finitude - Solitude," delivered during the winter semester of 1929-30, that is to say, 120 years after Kleist's Marionettentheater, twelve years after Franz Kafka's sketch, "Ein Bericht für eine Akademie," some five years after Thomas Mann's Der Zauberberg, a tale of time, profound boredom and consumptive life, and precisely when, on the one hand, Alfred North Whitehead was completing Process and Reality and on the other Georges Bataille, in Documents, was doing impossi ble things with anthropoid apes, Heidegger undertook a dual challenge: first, to analyze profound boredom, die tiefe Lange-weile, as a founding mood of Dasein; and second, to distinguish in detail among the respective "worlds" of lifeless stone, living animal, and human Dasein. It was the last time he would try to identify a Grundstimmung that might serve as the fundament for fundamental ontology; it was the first time he tried to say more about animal life than he had said in Being and Time, to wit, that life (as "just plain life": Nur-noch-leben; SZ, 50) would be what remained after "care" were subtracted from Dasein. If there were time I would talk at length about this lecture course. Suffice it to say that it is "a most splendid failure."12 Splendid because Heidegger here tries with noteworthy persistence to compare the world relations of stone, animal, and human being without collapsing into either crass physicalism or naive anthropomorphism. Yet it is the middle term— animal, ζφον, living being, just plain life—that remains inacessible,</page><page sequence="6">28 David Farrell Krell as though an abyss separated the ontologist from it, or as though a ring encircled him within it, suffocatingly close. Access (Zugang) is the problem (see sections 43, 47, 49), just as the kind of access (Zugangsart) to the question of the meaning of Being and to the everyday existence of Dasein poses the crucial problems for Being and Time}3 After wrestling long and hard with the problem in his lecture course Heidegger eventually concedes (29/30, 371 and 394) that access to the middle term is possible only from within the circle of being and understanding-of-being, only from within the abyss of Dasein. Life will remain a matter of privation, Nur-noch-leben. Hermeneutical encirclement will—like life itself—prove to be a trap, a kind of pit. At the outset (section 51) Heidegger wants very much to resist Wilhelm Roux's reduction of the organic to a Werk-zeug or Instrumenta rium devoid of world-relation. To such mechanism and physicalism Heidegger opposes a theory of the organ as "capability" rather than "capacity," Fähigkeit zu rather than Fertigkeit fir (see sections 52-57). At times the analysis of this capability-to appears to be leading Heidegger quite near to the world-relation of Dasein, as the creature of the wozu, um-zu and Zu-kunfi. Indeed, the relation of the organism as a whole to time as life-duration seems to remove it altogether from the realm of lifeless beings (section 53, esp. p. 328). However, Heidegger never expands the theory of organism to the point where it will descend into the second great shaft of meanings beneath the words organ and organism: if όργανον is bound up with έργον, the demiurgic world of work and technics, there remains the world (very much closer to Heidegger's Grundstimmung) of living beings, the Greek όργή, "natural impulse or propensity, tempera ment, disposition, mood." It is the world in which όργάω, I "become ready to bear, grow ripe; of men, to swell with lust, wax wanton, be rampant; of human beings and animals, to be in heat, desire sexual intercourse"; όργάω is presumably related to όρέγω, "to reach, stretch out, yearn for," δρεξις being Aristotle's word for conation and one of Heidegger's words for care, Sorge (cf. SZ, 171), the very Sorge that was supposed to be subtracted from Dasein in order to get "just plain life." Heidegger himself never enters the όργάς, which is "any well-watered, fertile spot of land, meadow-land, partially wooded, with or without cultivated fields," where daimons are sure to dwell. His Feldweg seems to circumvent these spots, although on Holzwege one is inevitably brought to them again and again. In his writing—for here it is not a question of what "Heidegger" enters into or circumvents, but only of his texts—Heidegger never pursues his bees back to the όργάς. (I mention bees because they, along with pseudopodia, are Heidegger's animals: no uncouth mammals here, nor any eagle or serpent, although there is a mole.)</page><page sequence="7">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 29 Capability-to is a kind of reflexive relation, a Sich-zu-eigen-sein, a primitive kind of propriation and particularization (Eigentum, Eigentüm lichkeit). Yet it is by no means a self-τelation: Heidegger is careful to reserve selfhood to Dasein. Indeed, the bulk of his analyses set the selfhood of human Dasein in relief against the realm of mere animality. Heidegger reserves—for it is clearly a matter of reservations and reserves, restrainings and retainings—the word Verhalten to designate the stance or posture of an erect, heroically reticent Dasein in the midst of beings. For animal behavior he selects the words Benehmen, Benommenheit (sections 58-60). Benommen is the past participle of benehmen and means "disturbed, dazed, dizzy, dazzled, confused, mildly anesthesized"; benumbed, as it were, whether by trauma, alcohol, of narcotics. In popular usage the word simply means dull-witted. Benehmen means to deprive someone of some thing (see SZ, 187). Used reflexively, sich benehmen means one's behavior, especially in public, as either "socially acceptable" or "boorish" behavior. Heidegger's choice of words—a bit odd inasmuch as animals, even domesticated ones, cannot really be told to "behave themselves" (cf. pp. 345-46)—seems to rest on the essentially privative and passive sense of Benommensein.14 He also speaks of the Eingenommenheit of animals, whose world-relation is only a yuan-relation, inasmuch as "relation" is Verhältnis, hence reserved for the Verhalten of Dasein. Animals "suffer" or "put up with" their world, taking it "in stride." That world itself is a "ring of de-inhibitions," Enthemmungsring, a circle of evasions and eliminations.15 The suspicion obtrudes that the deliberate choice of words—the semantic abyss that is opened up between human Verhalten and brute Benommenheit—derives from an ancient prejudice, that Heidegger's self proclaimed sachliche interpretation (345) is in fact guided by what Nietz sche would have called a moral prejudice, indeed the moral prejudice. (Nietzsche would have called it that and then announced: Adventavit asinus, pulcher et fortissimum.) Whether Heidegger can be as sanguine about such a prejudice as he appears to be in Bring and Time (SZ, 310) about the possibility—indeed necessity—of a "factical ideal," that is to say, an ideal that surreptitiously guides the ontologist of Dasein, is doubtful. The abyss that Heidegger wants to institute between Verhalten and Benehmen is the very abyss that guarantees what we might call the "proto-ontological difference": that Sein is no kind of Seiendes is noted by only one such Seiendes, to wit, dasrinsmäßiges Seiendes. Dasein alone (the mäßig is here superfluous, or perhaps—and this would require a long and difficult exposition—supplemental) is the being that is not altogether "taken in" by nature, not altogether "benumbed" in the ringdance of beings. Failure of the distinction between Verhalten and Benehmen would mean failure of the</page><page sequence="8">30 David Farrell Krell difference as such: the gap that opens in order to parture the question of the meaning of being would never gape. Yet what does gape here is the lecture course itself, its two halves affronting one another despite Heidegger's every integrative effort. The benumbed behavior of organism is contraposed not to Stimmung, the fundamentally disclosive attunement of Dasein that is treated in the first half of the course, but to the very Kantian-Husserlian-Schelerian person ality and personhood that Heidegger had criticized in section 10 of Being and Time. Indeed, the lecture course has recourse to selfhood, ipseity, the ego, objectivity and representational consciousness—traits that Being and Time tried at least to put in question, if not undermine. Although Heideg ger explicitly demands (section 67) a return to the earlier analyses of mood and finitude, calls for a closing of the gap in his own lecture course, he still insists that an "abyss" will have to intrude, an abyss to segregate (human) Dasein from (organic) life, an abyss that will open like Hesiodic χάος in order to let the light of the world shine, shine like fire in a lantern, or in an oven: We now confront the task of presentifying originarily [uns ursprünglich zu vergegenwärtigen] the moments of the concept of world that we came to know as provisional traits. We shall take up the task by going back in the direction opened up to us by our interpretation of profound boredom as a founding mood of human Dasein. It will be shown how this founding mood and everything encompassed within it is to be set in relief against what we asserted the essence of animality to be, to wit, benumbed behavior [Benommenheit]. Such setting in relief will be all the more decisive [entscheidender] for us as the very essence of animal ity, benumbed behavior, appears to slip into closest proximity [nächste Nähe] to what we delineated as a characteristic of profound boredom, what we called the binding/banning [Gebanntheit] of Dasein within beings as a whole. It will of course [freilich] be shown that this closest proximity of the two essential constitutions [Wesensverfassungen] is merely deceptive, that an abyss lies between them, an abyss that cannot be bridged by any kind of mediation in any way at all. But then the complete bifurcation of the two theses ["The animal is poor in world"; "Human beings construct a world" (das Tier ist weltarm·, der Mensch ist weltbildend)], and thereby the essence of world, will become luminous to us (409). However, in what follows (section 68, esp. 411) Heidegger comes very close to seeing how "the entire abyss of Dasein" gapes in such a way</page><page sequence="9">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 31 as to swallow all 'founding moods." Abgrund and Grund confront one another in what he clearly recognizes as a crisis, Krise, of fundamental ontology. His own final efforts to define the "as-structure" as the world shaping peculiarity of human beings—since when Dasein is sunning itself on a rock it knows the sun as sun, the rock as rock, this being what makes it different from a lizard as lizard—neatly circumvent the abyss. Postpone the crisis. I shall not examine the crisis in any detail here, inasmuch as the question of Gebanntheit (see esp. section 32), the peculiarly temporal charac ter of human being, is quite complex. If I were to go into detail here, it would be to show that the 1929-30 lecture course, with its two parts, parts that very much yearn to become a whole, represents an inversion of the two divisions of Being and Time, Part One: the materials on profound boredom recover the analyses of appropriateness, time, and Augenblick, whereas those on animality and organism recover the provisional analysis of worldliness, Zuhandenheit and Vorhandenheit. Further, I would try to show that this inversion solves none of the problems of fundamental ontology. It is not the turnabout (Umschlag: see 26, 196-202) Heidegger anticipates; it is not the twisting free (Herausdrehung: see SZ, 197, 201 and 323; NI 240-2; Ni 1, 208-10) that he requires of Nietzsche and of himself. I shall emphasize only one aspect of the failure, one that Heidegger makes certain his listeners will not overlook. For he openly confesses that he is unable to say anything about the way in which death intervenes in both animal and human life. Not only does he find himself resorting to a blatantly ontotheological appeal to the "as-structure," which here means the apophantic more than the hermeneutic "as" and the discourse of Vorhandenheit more than anything else, but he also catches himself revert ing to the distinction between dying and demise, Sterben as opposed to Verenden, even though it has become clear to all by now that something very much like the nothing, das Nichts, shatters the ring of animal as well as human life.16 At a crucial juncture in the second half of his course Heidegger writes: "The touchstone for the suitability and originality of every inquiry into the essence of life and vice-versa [that is, presumably, the life of essence or of the creature] is whether the inquiry has sufficiently grasped the problem of death; and whether it is able to bring that problem in the correct way into the question concerning the essence of life.'"7 Heidegger's own verdict (386-87; 395-96) is that his inquiry fails. Fails for precisely the same reason that his earlier search for the unified horizon of ecstatic temporality, the finitude of time, failed—to wit, the "difficult problem of death" (24, 387). Ήθος άνθρώπφ δαίμων. Human beings dwell in the nearness of</page><page sequence="10">32 David Farrell Krell god, of living beings, of death. Who is warming up at the stove? θεοί, says Heraclitus. Every kind of ζφον, says Aristotle. Daimonic Dasein, says Heidegger. And yet these three answers—whatever the abysms of differ ence between them—may be the selfsame. Provided we are able to avoid the error of drawing distinctions too violently. I began by referring to Heidegger's first Heraclitus essay, "Logos"; let me now take up the second, "Aletheia".18 For here Heidegger invokes gods and daimons, Zeus, mortals and animals, and tries to think them all together. With scant success. Pursuing through the "grounds and abysses of Greek thinking" his interpretation of φύσις as pure upsurgence, Aufgehen, Heidegger recalls "ever-living fire," πυρ άείζωον, the fire to which Heraclitus exposed himself every day of his life. Ever-living fire thus kindles the question of "life" in general: How must we understand our word life if we accept it as a faithful translation of the Greek word ζην? In ζην, ζάω the root ζα- speaks. It is, of course, impossible to conjure up the Greek meaning of "life" from this sound. (See VA, 274; EGT, 116-7, for this and the following.) In 1943 Heidegger had expanded somewhat on the impossibility of capturing what is to be said (das Zu-sagende) in either spoken or—far worse—written words. He said to his students, or read to them what he had written, as follows: The word of the thinker [Heraclitus] stands under the protection of the goddess [Artemis], the word as the saying of what is to be said [die Sage des Zusagenden]. However, because the word is not grounded in the sounding of the words [Lauten der Wörter], because the sounded word resonates as the word that it is solely from out of the primor dially soundless word, words and word-configurations can shatter [zerbrechen] in writing and in the book [in der Schrift und im Buch], whereas the word remains. ... In the beginning of thinking is the word (55, 27). Heidegger repeats this admonition when the time comes (93) to discuss the root ζα- in some detail: "From this phoneme [Lautgebilde], itself 'composed' of the consonant ζ and the vowel a, we cannot of course spin out the 'essence of life'." Hence no comment on either the consonant or the vowel, the articulation or the music. Nor does he allude to Plato's</page><page sequence="11">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 33 Cratylus (cf. 427a-c), which has thought-provoking things to say about the pneumatic consonant ζ, of all consonants the zephyr, and the mighty vowel a, expressive of grandeur. Perhaps this is because Heidegger shares Socrates' suspicions about his own wild wisdom, his phonic (or manic) euphoria, his glossolalia. Yet neither Heidegger nor we can afford to ignore a number of Socrates' etymologies and derivations in Cratylus: of Zeus from "life" (396a-b; 410d), of gods from celestial "runners" (397d), of daimons and heroes from humans who are superhuman in knowledge and wisdom (398b-c) but also in erotic matters (398c-d). And even in those places where Heidegger would appear to agree with Socrates, this purest thinker of the West, as in the derivation of "human" from that which "looks up" and "sees" (399c), we would be beset by Socrates' worry about all this talk about speech—the worry the Greeks called ύβρις. However, all this is taking us, as Heidegger will soon say of his own discussion of ζα-, "too far afield." Let me return to "Aletheia": But we do notice that the Greek language, above all in the speech of Homer and Pindar, uses words like ζάθεος, ζαμενής, ζάπυρος. Linguistics explains that ζα- signifies an intensification. Ζάθεος accordingly means "most divine," "very holy"; ζαμενής, "very forceful"; ζάπυρος, "most fiery." Yet this "intensification" means neither a mechanical nor a dynamic increase. Before we follow Heidegger in abandoning linguistics and philology, let us pause to note the following: the preposition ζά is the Aeolian (= windy!) way to say διά, "through, across, throughout", and the inten sifying "very"; διά, cognate with δύο and δίς, "two, twice, doubly," expresses both mutual relation and difference, completing and sundering, both that which is in-between or only partly such and such and that which is thoroughly, out and out, utterly so. Ζά thus implies both intensification and breaching, augmentation and splitting-off, perhaps a kind of dehis cence. We shall have occasion to revert to this ambiguous dilation and dissemination at the end. Meanwhile, Heidegger is surely right when he says (93) that there is nothing straightforwardly "mechanical" about ζα-. "Aletheia" continues: Pindar calls various locales, mountains, meadows, the banks of a river ζάθεος, especially when he wants to say that the gods, the radiant ones who cast a look in [die scheinend Hereinblickenden], often permitted themselves to be seen here in their proper shapes [oft und eigentlich]. They came to presence by appearing here. These locales</page><page sequence="12">34 David Farrell Krell are especially holy because they arise purely to allow the appearing of the radiant one. So too does ζαμενής mean that which allows the imminently advancing storm to billow up in its full presencing. Ζα- signifies the pure letting-rise within appearing, gazing into, breaking in upon and advancing, and all their ways. "Aletheia" follows the 1943 course (55, 93-4; 108) quite closely here, although it neglects one further ζα- word, one especially striking for a reflection on life: ζατρεφής means "well-nourished, flourishing, burgeon ing." Moreover, in the lecture course Heidegger risks the assertion that all the ζα- words "keep to a unified realm of essence," even though further examples and demonstrations would lead him "too far afield," zu weit (93-4). Heidegger does not pause to wonder whether the German zu, ze-, zer- and z\ as intensifying forms, are related to ζα-. In which case one could never go too far afield. But Heidegger makes his point forcefully and without hesitation: thought in Greek fashion, ζα— means pure upsurgence into radiant appearance, the entry of a being into unconcealment, the Herein- of Hereinblicken, Hereinschauen and Hereinbrechen. In a word, ζα— is φύσις. Which brings us back to "life," in "Aletheia": The verb ζην means rising into the light. Homer says, ζην και όράν φάος ήελίοιο, "to live, and that means to see the light of the sun." The Greek ζην, ζωή, ζφον must not be interpreted in either a zoological or a broader biological sense. What is named in the Greek ζφον lies so far from any biologically conceived animality that the Greeks could even call their gods ζφα. How could this be? "Even" their gods, sogar ihre Götter. As though nothing could be more surprising than the nearness of god and animal. In the 1943 lecture course (95) Heidegger adds that not only the gods but also their statues are called ζφα, for both are "what has surged up, standing there in the open." It is therefore less anomalous that animals too should be brought into proxim ity with the gods. He stresses that the animal "is not thought in Christian fashion, merely as something lowly and distinct from something more 'elevated,' to wit, human beings" (95; cf. 106). Living beings such as animals are not pieces of sculpture, statues of stone. And so Heidegger must in "Aletheia" proceed as follows: Those who cast a look in [Die Hereinblickenden] are the ones who surge up in gazing [ins Schauen]. The gods are not experienced as animals. Yet animality does belong to ζην in a special sense. The upsurgence of animals into the free region remains closed and sealed in itself in a</page><page sequence="13">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 35 way that is at once shockingly alien [befremdend] and captivating [bestrickend]. Self-revealing and self-concealing in the animal are one in such a way that human analysis practically runs out of alternatives when it rejects mechanistic views of animality—which are always feasible—as firmly as it avoids anthropomorphic interpretations. Because the animal does not speak, self-revealing and self-concealing, together with their unity, possess in the case of animals a wholly different life-essence [ein ganz anderes Lebe-Wesen]. "Because the animal does not speak." (Nor, as we shall soon see, does it see.) Heidegger has of course located the gulf that separates speaking beings from speechless ones decades earlier, in his 1934—35 Hölderlin course (39, 75). Referring to the "benumbment" that is animal behavior, he writes: "The leap from living animal to speaking human being is as great, or greater, than that from lifeless stone to living being." And yet this "wholly different" essence, the "life-essence" of animals, with its "entirely other" mode of self-revealing and self-concealing (the self here translating sich, not selbst): how could it rise in the unique unifying-One, the solitary sheltering or gathering that is the clearing of being? By the late 1930s Heidegger surely cannot entertain any illusions about the failure of fundamental ontology to gain access to just-plain-life. Yet has he succeeded in gaining access to just-plain- φύσις? In a moment I shall interrogate these failures once again. But not before returning to the 1943 Heraclitus course, which adduces a number of details to the discus sion of animality in "Aletheia." The upsurgence of animals—in the Greek view that Heidegger is trying to recapture—remains an upsurgence in "peculiar repose" (55, 95). For animals do not speak out. Whatever noises they make, they do not possess the word. And yet. Animals in the ancient Greek view are mysteriously and powerfully expressive, and in manifold ways. Heideg ger's example is the bird, whose hovering and soaring measures the open region of air, whose song is at once call, announcement, and enchantment. Yet birds—even Aristophanes' rather flighty Birds, one might say—are also emblems of mourning and melancholy, harbingers of closure and of the dead of night. Heidegger now reveals the sense of the word bestrickend (ensnaring, capturing, captivating) in the passage from "Aletheia" cited above, on the alien yet captivating self-revealing and self-concealing of animals: Flying, singing, the bird is bound to and points to the open. It ensnares [verstrickt] in the open. The Greek word σειρά means snare.</page><page sequence="14">36 David Farrell Krell The Sirens, thought in Greek fashion, are the ones who in the multiple senses of the word ensnare (95-6). Heidegger says no more about birds and sirens—bronze by gold, beautiful face by beautiful voice, half woman, half bird, greeting in going—so mysteriously introduced into the clearing. He proceeds to identify ζωή with φύσις, "pure upsurgence" (103). Yet the identity of ζωή and φύσις implies the essential proximity, Wesensnähe, of life and being as such "throughout the entire history of Western thought" (104—5). Ζωή is a word for being.19 However, if ζωή is a word for being, perfectly equivalent to φύσις, then the abyss that ostensibly segregates human beings from animals and establishes them in the neighborhood of the gods becomes a troubling sort of gap. The abyss is in fact a Sprung, not a leap of pious thought but a crack or fissure in being, what Heidegger somewhere calls eine Zerklüftung des Sejms (Kluft as gap or gully or cleaving, Zer- as intensifier). If fundamental ontology merely postpones the regional ontology ofjust-plain-life, the time will surely come when Heidegger must ask whether there are "stages" or "gradations" in being, whether there are gullies or canyons in the "unified field of essence" that is ζα-. Such gradations dare not be derived from links in the Leibnizian "great chain of being," from Creator God through angels to humanity, and thence, across a gap of essence that would cleave the field of essence, to the (mere) animal. Surely Heidegger could not abide the possibility that his "other commencement" and "other think ing" reduplicate beliefs and prejudices that have prevailed throughout the history of metaphysics? Surely it would be shattering to confront the possibility that Ereignis, the truth of being as φύσις, might rest on a traditional ordering or hierarchy of beings? For the very distinction between being and beings, and not any grounded order of beings, is now presumably for the first time in all history the spur to thought. Yet what about this very distinction, what about the order of essence? What does it mean to seek an ordering principle, an articulation or jointure (Fügung), for stone, plant, animal, mortal and god? Can there be a hierarchy of φύσις as revealing/concealing? How would such a hierarchy cast off the fetters of the ancient chain that binds beings to a Creator God? In a lecture course on Parmenides (winter semester of 1942-43, a semester earlier than the course of Heraclitus), Heidegger focuses on two of those ζα- words from the field of φύσις that will resonate strongly in the "Letter on Humanism." I mean the words θεοί and δαίμονες, gods and daimons. The daimonic, τό δαιμόνιον, is Heidegger's central concern here. He is quick to cast aside the understanding of "demonic" in the "Christian" sense (54, 147), for example, as a timorous condemnation of</page><page sequence="15">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 37 "state power" (135). Rather, the daimonic is the Un-Geheuer, the vast, colossal, un-common and un-familiar. Heidegger promptly denies that there is anything monstrous (Monströses: 150) about this Un-Geheuer, which is "radiantly penetrating being," das hereinscheinende Sein. The daimonic is actually the nearest of the near, the most intimate and natural thing in the world—φύσις itself. τό δαιμόνιον is the essence and essential ground of the uncommon. It is that which proffers itself to the common and comes to presence in it. Proffering itself [sich dargeben], in the sense of indicating and pointing, is the Greek word δαίω (δαίοντες - δαίμονες) (54, 151). Liddell-Scott (for we have not tossed philology aside, not just yet) inform us that δαίω is in fact two verbs. The first means to kindle a fire, to burn. The second, in the active voice, means to divide; in the passive voice, to be torn or (figuratively) to be distracted; in the middle voice, to distribute or allot; in the aorist, to feast on what has been distributed, to celebrate. It is clearly the medial that both Heidegger and Liddell-Scott emphasize when they suggest that δαίω forms the root of δαίμων.20 Liddell-Scott do not speculate on the connection of δαίω with ζα-, and from there to διά - δίς, nor does Heidegger comment on the possibility, even though the sense of distribution of destinies—δαίμονες as the divine powers of dispensation—makes the inference quite plausible. Heidegger is more intent on showing (152-5) that the root of δαίω is identical to that of θεάω, "to look," in the middle voice "to offer some thing to the gaze" or, better, "to offer itself to a sighting." The gods, ot θεοί, are those who gaze; daimons are those who indicate and signal. The two are in fact selfsame: θεοί, the ones we call "gods," are those who gaze into the uncon cealed and who, thus gazing, signal: θεαόντες, in accord with their essence, are the δαίοντες - δαίμονες, the un-common ones who point into the common. (54, 161; cf. 55, 8 and "Wissenschaft und Besinnung", VA, 52-3.) θέα, the glimpse, is θεά, the goddess—the goddess Aletheia. And mortals? Inasmuch as they too gaze into the common, are not mortals too θεοί, or, failing that, are they not those who point, δαίμονες? Not quite. Almost. In the unified field of essence that is φύσις, φύσις as ζωή, ζωή as ζα-, there is a kind of declivity or cascade. There is a kind of slippage that Heidegger does not discuss but toward which he gestures when he calls mortals die Nachkömmlinge. Mortals are the "afterlings" to daimons, a</page><page sequence="16">38 David Farrell Krell "posterity" that has suffered a diminution of essence, perhaps even a disessencing or de-composition—what Heidegger will later call Ver-wesung (US, 45-7). One might want to compare all this (as Heidegger does not do) to the slippage that occurs in the generation of immortals and mortals as recounted in Plato's Timaeus (for example, at 28-32 and 39-40). And animals? Do not they too gaze? Or does the slippage of specta tion and speech continue? Is there a further rift in the unified field of essence, a further plunge? Here the animal occupies a peculiar position in-between. Animals "look at us," we say. Yet animals do not gaze [blicken]. An animal's "espying" or "lowering" or "gaping" and "glaring" is never a self-revelation of being; in its so-called gazing the animal never brings its own upsurgence to accompany that of any being that is revealed to it [ein Aufgehen seiner selbst in ein ihm entborgenes Seiendes mit] {54, 158-9). One might pose a range of questions to this "upsurgence of self" in which φύσις, the unified field of essence, is fissured by the spectatorial "self" of ontotheology. Instead, a word about the odd nature of the animal gaze in Heidegger. For it is still the unseeing glare of the praying/preying mantis, a Spähen, Lauem, Glotzen and Stieren, nothing like the gaze that embraces peasant and sheep in Chagall's "I and the Village" (1911). As late as 1968, at Le Thor, Heidegger will insist that animals—cows, for example—do not and cannot see.21 Heidegger realizes of course that when an animal stares at us it meets our own gaze in a way no stone ever can. (He does not specify what kind of animal he has in mind, but we can be certain that now it is neither bee nor pseudopod; it is a mammal, indeed, a particular kind of mammal, neither harmless cow nor risible jackass, the ass that appears—adventavit asinus—in the lecture courses and at the very end of "Aletheia".) He concedes—no doubt it is a concession, a deigning and condescending—that when an animal glares at us we feel "a special concentration of encountering-force," Begegniskraft (159). The "look" of the animal is particularly overpowering—well-nigh demonic—in the low ering of a predator, ein Raubtier, such as the one portrayed, according to Heidegger, by Oswald Spengler. Earlier in the lecture course {54, 101) Heidegger has cited Spengler's Der Mensch und die Technik: Beitrag zu einer Philosophie des Lebens (1931), cited it apparently as an illustration of how not to go about discussing ζώον. I say "apparently," for Heidegger leaves the Spengler passage without any commentary whatsoever, as though it spoke for itself. Spengler writes: "The character of the predator in the wild [des freien Raubtieres] has in its</page><page sequence="17">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 39 essential traits been transferred from the individual to the organized nation [das organisierte Volk], the animal with one soul and many hands." Heidegger does not fail to adduce, again without comment, Spengler's concluding footnote: "And with one head, not many." Whatever sarcasm there may be in this citation sans commentary, it remains disquieting that Spengler's Raubtier returns to Heidegger's lecture course, not as a politico military metaphor, but as a metonymy for the animal as such. Yet whether as glaring predator in the wild or Leviathan with multiple murderous hands, there is no question but that the animal "as such" is a (lowly) link in the semantic chain, and that an abyss of essence will be dug to keep the animal at a distance from the lookers, the pointers, the talkers of primordial soundlessness. Life is short and it is time to bring these reflections to a close. But it will not do to end without at least mentioning Heidegger's desperate critique of Rainer Maria Rilke's putative "biologism," "anthropomor phism," and naive "Christianity" in the eighth Duino Elegy (54, 225ff.). The critique occurs in the context of a discussion of nothing less than the ontological difference, the abyss, as such. After defining τό δαιμόνιον as the gaze, the silent taking-in that characterizes belongingness to being (168-69), and after establishing the etymology of the word theory in the daimonic and divine gaze (θέα - όράω, θείον - δαιμόνιον: 219-20), Heidegger italicizes the following: The distinction of all distinctions and the commencement of all distinguishing [is] the distinction between being and the being. Der Unterschied aller Unterschiede und der Anfang aller Unterschei dung [iri] der Unterschied des Seins und des Seienden (225). As far as I can see, Heidegger nowhere alludes to the lines from the first Elegy that serve as the epigram to my paper; that is perplexing inasmuch as Unterschied is here the question. Without venturing anything like an account of Heidegger's strained relationship with Rilke,22 I shall simply allow Heidegger's attack to arouse some suspicions. Is it not uncanny that Heidegger should fault Rilke for having capitulated to a naive "Christian" interpretation of beings as a whole—and then proceed to define the realm of φύσις in such a way that human beings are guaranteed their accus tomed nearness to divinity and their traditional eminence vis-ä-vis ani mality? It is as though άλήθεια, through the good graces of θεωρία, does all the work Christian ontotheology ever did, so that when Heidegger accuses Rilke (and Nietzsche) of having forgotten άλήθεια one must struggle to remember precisely why it had to be remembered. Thus</page><page sequence="18">40 David Farrell Krell Heidegger, the thinker of bridges (see VA, 152-62; BW, 329-39), proceeds to write about those animals beyond the abyss, proceeds without even posing the question as to the kind of asses' bridge he must now cross. "Man, and he alone," writes Heidegger, excluding the animals and forgetting those δαίμονες the entire course has been about, "sees into the open region." He continues (237): In contrast, the animal neither sees nor does it ever glimpse the open region, in the sense of the unconcealment of what is unconcealed. . . . The animal is barred [ausgeschlossen] from the essential domain of the strife between unconcealment and concealment. The sign of this essential exclusion is that no animal and no kind of vegetation "has the word" ['hat das Wort': "takes the floor" in order to "speak its piece"]. Never mind that Heidegger will later—as we have seen—concede to animals (and plants?) their own peculiar revealing/concealing. Here he does admit that exclusion hardly solves the riddle that animals are. "For the animal is related to [bezogen auf] the circle within which it nourishes itself, pursues its prey, or mates, in a manner essentially different from that in which the stone is related to the ground on which it lies" (237). Stones lie on the ground; animals hover within the Ab-grund. Or, at least, on the very verge of it. There is in plants and animals a manner of "arousal" or "excitation," and Heidegger now employs a whole series of words based on sich regen in order to delineate it: Sichregen einer Regsamkeit, Aufregung as Erregung zu einem Aufgehen within a circle of Erregbarkeit. Such "bestirring" may seem to be an advance beyond the "benumbment" and "bedazzle ment" of 1929-30 (leaving 1927 out of account!), yet the principle of exclusion is still operating: No bestirring and excitability of plants and animals ever conduct the living being into the free region in such a way that what is bestirred could ever even let what excites it "be" what it is as an excitant, to say nothing about what the living being is prior to such excitation and without it. Plants and animals hang suspended in something outside themselves, without ever seeing either the outside or the inside; that is, without ever having to stand unconcealed as a gaze [Anblick] into the free region of being (238). The "circle" too may seem an advance beyond the "ring· of de inhibitions" of 1929-30, yet not a word appears here about the shattering</page><page sequence="19">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 41 of that circle, not a word about death, nothing about nothing. And yet the context of all these lecture courses of the early 1940s certainly involves death, indeed in the very shape of the goddess under whose protection the thinkers stand. At least in the case of Heraclitus. Heraclitus resides in the nearness of fire, light, and glowing coals (55, 9). As the thinker of harmony and strife, he stands under the aegis of Artemis, goddess of the lyre and the bow, the bow that is both life and death.23 Of Artemis, Heidegger writes, "Her beauty is that of an elevated, noble appearance," and he adds, "The girls she favors grow tall" (55, 16). Artemis is φωσφόρος, the bearer of light; her arrows are "'sudden', 'gentle' and 'lovely'" (17). It is in the nearness of Artemis as life-death that Heidegger discusses ζωή and ζωον (17-18): Life and death run counter to one another [sind das Gegenwendige]. To be sure. Yet at the point of extreme opposition, things that run counter turn most intrinsically toward one another [das Gegenwendige wendet im äußersten Entgegen eines dem anderen sich innigst zu]. Admittedly, life, beauty, and death are not so intertwined in the case of Parmenides' goddess—the θεά whom Heidegger identifies as Truth, "Aletheia" (see VA, 247-8; EGT, 93-4). For θεά is nothing else than θέα, the steady gaze of being. Heidegger will never confuse her with Parmenidean-Empedoclean Aphrodite, as Nietzsche did. Nietzsche—who also abandoned Artemis and her brother Apollo in order to revel in a Schopenhauerian distortion of Heraclitus, an interpretation "initiated already by Hegel and then coarsened by Nietzsche and removed to the sphere of the swamp—the 'Dionysian' interpretation of Heraclitean thinking" (55, 18). The instant Heidegger nears the well-watered όργάς it begins to look like abysmal marshland, a morass, and he circumvents it with disdain. Yet perhaps also with anxiety, if Dionysus is Zagreus, Za-greus, powerfully mutilated. No doubt an introduction to za-ology would have to proceed to the "new interpretation of sensuousness" that Heidegger promised at the end of his first lecture course on Nietzsche, in 1936-37, promised but never delivered. Nevertheless, I abandon it now to questions I have posed elsewhere.24 Yet it would be churlish of me to let such an introduction end without acknowledging Heidegger's stubborn insistence that the life of the (human) body must be thought, even if the body remains the most difficult task for his and our own thinking. Some extracts from the penultimate session of his and Eugen Fink's 1966-67 seminar on Heraclitus:</page><page sequence="20">42 David Farrell Krell Fink: (...) The human being differs from all beings. ... It possesses a double character: on the one hand, it is itself placed in the clearing, and on the other, it is imprisoned in the underground of all clearing [der dem Untergrund aller Lichtung Verhaftete]. MH: That will become comprehensible only through the phenomenon of the body, Fink: as in the erotic mode of understanding. MH: "Body" is not meant ontically here Fink: and not in the Husserlian sense, either, MH: but rather in the way Nietzsche thinks the body—even though it remains obscure what the body properly signifies for him. Fink: In the section "On the Despisers of the Body," Zarathustra says, "Body am I wholly and entirely, and nothing else besides." Through the body and the senses human beings are near the earth [erdennah]. MH: (...) Can we isolate the darkling understanding [das dunkle Verste hen, invoked by Fink] which defines our corporeal belonging to the earth from our being placed in the clearing? Fink: To be sure, the darkling understanding can be addressed only in terms of the clearing. But it can no longer be brought to language by way of a nicely articulated structure [gegliederte Fügung]. ΜΗ: (...) Human beings are embodied only if they are alive [Der Mensch leibt nur, wenn er lebt]. That is the way to understand "body" in the sense you are using it. At the same time, "to live" is meant in an existential sense. Ontic nearness does not mean any sort of spatial proximity between two things, but a reduced form of openness [eine herabgesetzte Offenheit], hence an ontological moment in human beings. Nevertheless, you speak of an ontic nearness [see p. 232]. Fink: Back in the days when you first came to Freiburg, you said in a lecture course: the animal is poor in world [das Tier ist weltarm]. At that time you were on the way toward the kinship [ Verwandtschaft] of human beings with nature. MH: The phenomenon of the body is the most difficult problem.25 Heidegger uncovers the root of life in ζα-. Eventually he equates it with "the look" of gods and mortals on the near side of the abyss. Yet if I am right, ζα- is cognate not with θέα but with διά, δίς. And the Latin prefix dis-, dif- is at least in part equivalent to the German intensifying prefix Zer- (cf. Zer-klüftung, Zer-brechen, etc.). Ήθος ανθρώπψ δαίμων. Man dwells in nearness to the daimon. Heidegger first introduces τό δαιμόνιον in his 1928 logic course, at the place where he is discussing finite transcendence and the overpowering, das Übermächtige, which is his initial way of designating divinity. Das</page><page sequence="21">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 43 Über-mächtige, the intensely powerful, ζα-μενής, δαιμόνιον. Here Heideg ger neglects to mention that earlier in this very course (26, 13) he has characterized the fitting mortal gaze upon divinity as benommen, as a kind of "benumbed behavior." And yet, compensating for this neglect, in a long marginal note he inserts the following parenthetical remark—as a kind of margin within the margin, a kind of abyss: (It remains for us to consider being and the daimonic, or perhaps understanding-of-being and the daimonic. Being as ground! Being and nothing—anxiety.)26 How are we to think (within anxiety) the δαιμόνιον? We can think it, Heidegger replies in this same marginal note, "only in and out of the complete semination [Streuung, literally, "bestrewal"] that belongs to the essence of transcendence." He directs our attention to the sixth thesis of section 10 in that lecture course. There an "original semination" is invoked which would be the "inner possibility" of an intensified "factical dissemi nation" (Zerstreuung) and dispersion (Zerstreutheit) of Dasein into "embodi ment" and "thereby" into "sexuality," Geschlechtlichkeit.21 That chilly δαίμων there in the kitchen, if it is in the kitchen, hovering over the abyss or suspended within it, disseminating and dispersed: Does it have a body yet? Is it somebody? Some body who is alive? DISCUSSION B. O'Neill: You began with a quotation from Rilke. Now, the relationship between Rilke's understanding of the world and Heidegger's is, while not a coincidence, relatively close. It seems to me there are parallels which could have been followed up which may be illuminating for the way Heidegger's thought is working in this area, since clearly he was extremely influenced by Rilke. There is "Der Panther," in which precisely the idea of an animal gaze is something which Rilke finds mysterious. It is certainly not like saying, "Oh, look, it's got its eyes open just like a human being." It is rather as if its gaze is something that is not and yet is like that of a human being, a gaze that does reveal a Dasein. Now, that is one sort of connection. And, in one of the Elegies, I think it might be the fourth, there is a sort of debunking, worrying account of the animal character of man, his violence, sadism and sexuality, which Rilke is clearly deeply worried about— the way in which man moves away from the angels in that respect. Then there is something that plays a role in Rilke which one might at first think to be like the gods, but perhaps in the light of what you were saying may be a bit more like the daimon—namely, the angels in</page><page sequence="22">44 David Farrell Krell the Duino Elegies. Admittedly, the angels are above men and you might for that reason think they were gods, but they move as having a stärkeres Dasein, so that they are a kind of model of what it is to have a Dasein that is moving towards the gods, rather than being rooted in the earth as human beings might be. Now, this is just a collection of connections. How much illumination can be got out of them I'm not sure, but I wonder if you would comment on them. D. Krell: The Heidegger/Rilke relationship is extremely difficult, both tense and dense, difficult to penetrate. The one thing that is clear from the Parmenides course is that Heidegger is engaged in what can only be called an attack. And the very things that you and I find so invitingly similar, the nearness of Rilke to Heidegger, is apparently what enrages Heidegger and causes him to insist on an abyss of difference between das Offene in Rilke and φύσις or upsurgence in his own thinking. This is perhaps dangerous to say, but I don't think I've seen a less sympathetic account by Heidegger of any poetic text than this account of the eighth Elegy, or a less insightful one. It is as though, with a vengeance, Heidegger goes right on by Rilke. What is behind the violence of this Zerriss? There is, for example, never for a moment the acknowledgment of a shared gaze. There is instead terrific resistance to the gaze of the animal and a furious response—I would say almost a bestial response—to Rilke. There is a kind of feral intensity in Heidegger's insistence—"What I am saying has nothing to do with him." The problem is, of course, that Heidegger can't allow such an abyss to persist. The field of φύσις is unified; he stresses in his za-ology that all the za- words in Greek are not simply related, but one. Za- means upsurgence, revealing, self-showing. And yet, for some strange reason, we are the only ones who are on this side of the recurrent abyss, along with the gods, abandoning the animals to the other side. And at that point the gesture becomes a very traditional one. I finished my account of Rilke here, in desperation, by saying that when Heidegger insists that Rilke and Nietzsche forget aletheia we must ask why it was necessary to remember it. If all it gives us is the same old spectatorial selves that we have always known, why was it necessary to remember disclosure? This is a topic in which the whole project of fundamental ontology is foundering. For funda mental ontology is all in the context of the difference, der Unterschied, between being and beings. And this difference is itself a kind of abyss that Heidegger has to open up. He has to allow there to be a kind of Χάος, an original gap that yawns, and this gap is to be described as the unified field of φύσις, one φύσις for all. And yet into this field or abyss come all kinds of fissurings and cracks along the surface or the</page><page sequence="23">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 45 side; and Heidegger winds up attempting to build asses' bridges across the abyss, to speculate about what's on the other side—in the gaze of the animals. All of these moves, however, are futile, desperate and impossible. And out of this desperation and impossibility comes an account of Rilke which, I think, would displease you, in which the nearness of Rilke is the nearness of an animal, a predator, whom the fundamental ontologist will fight off, digging a trench between ontol ogy of Dasein and this beast. The trench is the only difference there is, the difference between being and beings. Yet the animals creep across it. B. O'Neill: Can I just verify whether you are saying that what he ought to have done is develop fundamental ontology in such a way that he could have bridged this gulf, or whether you are saying that the fundamental character of Heidegger's thought is such as to make that gulf inevitable and all bridges asses' bridges? It is the latter, is it? D. Krell: Yes. The ground of Dasein is that it is the abyss. It is the only abyss there is, the ontological difference. There is only one difference between being and beings, and hence the upsurgence of the animal into the abyss that is supposedly occupied exclusively by Dasein poses a monumental problem to fundamental ontology. It is the point where the project is completely undone. J. Llewelyn: Is there not an intermediate stage between animal and Dasein, namely, primitive Dasein? And yet access to both animals and primitives involves a kind of "back translation." So there's no way of getting another step intd the great chain of being—as it were, Heidegger's great chain of being—with that remark. He's just marking time. D. Krell: "Marking time" is well put, because that is what Heidegger begins to realize in 1929/30, namely, that for the animal too there is a marking of time. Time marks animal life as well. One of the words he uses is Erschütterung: animal life—and, I presume, primitive life too—are shattered. There is a penetration by the nothing into animal life, not simply into the life of Dasein. The ring of animal life is shattered by something that looks very much like the nothing—your nothing and my nothing, the nothing of Dasein, the abyss that supposedly Dasein alone occupies. J. Taminiaux: Did you find any mention of or any reference to the problem of eudaimonia in connection with what you mentioned? And what about Socrates' daimon in connection with what you have said? Both seem to me to involve very different sorts of questions. D. Krell: The entire middle section of the Parmenides lecture course is on eudaimonia. But one can say very quickly what the upshot of that</page><page sequence="24">46 David Farrell Krell whole analysis is, and that it has nothing to do with political life or with ethos as we normally translate it. It has to do with aletheia, upsurgence, alone. J. Taminiaux: Well, that is the bias of the lectures; I mean, of the reading .. . D. Krell·. Surely. As for the Socratic daimon, I'm not really sure whether Heidegger even mentions it here. J. Taminiaux·. The second question would be about the problem of the death of the animal, the beast dying. It reminds me very much of what Hegel says about the beast. The beasts approach the negativity of the spirit, the gods, when they die. . . . D. Krell·. Death occurs after they have made the move to the other sex and engaged in mating. When the species is assured as the universal, that is the death of the individual. J. Taminiaux: Yes. That is where the ontological difference in Hegel's sense, which means the difference between life and the living, appears. Is there any reference to this in Heidegger? D. Krell: No, nothing. In the mid-1930s Heidegger—without explicit reference to Hegel—says something like this: In the species there is nothing of the self, there is nothing self-like, nothing like selfhood; yet the species is preeminent over the individual, the species is the death of the individual. This is an unacknowledged summary of the lesson of the Jena organics of 1805/06 and also of the mature system in the Encyclopedia. Heidegger reduplicates, without any critical distance, Hegel's elevation of die Gattung or species as the universal. He simply reduplicates it and says: This is the death of the individual. Thus Heidegger reiterates the most striking move that Hegel makes in the advance from philosophy of nature to philosophy of spirit. To see Heidegger making the same move after the most intense investigations—I mean, those of 1929/30—was, for me, a real shock. For this is the move of metaphysics. That is why there is a kind of ultimate disappointment as one comes away from these texts: in spite of all the rigor and intensity with which Heidegger investigates animality and life, it looks like a very traditional sort of story. J. Taminiaux: Why were you disappointed? After all, that's what Weiderhol ung, retrieval, is supposed to be, you know. D. Krell: No, no. Retrieval isn't fetching yesterday's newspaper. Retrieval is taking up a problem, reworking it in such a way that new possibili ties come to light. Yet Heidegger's are the old possibilities—which didn't even work back then. So I was disappointed. J. Taminiaux: Well, I'm not sure. It's not a mere repetition, you know. D. Krell: It should not be, but I think that what Heidegger does in this regard is a mere repetition, without his seeing that this is so.</page><page sequence="25">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 47 D. Wood: If we don't read Being and Time anthropologically, then can we not just extend the analysis of Dasein to some animals? In other words, should we not take seriously the claim that this is not merely anthropology, that it is an account of a particular mode of being which animals, other animals, I should say—since people are ani mals; I mean, we're all animals—which nonhuman animals might or might not share? The assumption has been that we can talk about humans and animals as if all the other animals are all alike. I don't know whether you're making a distinction between spiders and chimpanzees. I see this as a totalizing of the other animal—they're all the same, you know. That seems extraordinary. As if all humans were somehow the same. I think that is something we've got to stop; we've got to dissolve these categories. At the same time we must wonder about precisely where the limit would come, and we should ask which limit. For there are lots of limits. . . . D. Krell: Yes, completely right. Heidegger has given us the occasion, multiple occasions, not to accept this regression to what isn't such a great chain of being any more. One should follow symptomatically, as it were, the animals which Heidegger does discuss. I was going to write a paper called "Heidegger's Bugs". . . . He has a fondness for pseudopods in 1929/30, and then he moves on to bees. After the bees, there is a kind of leap to the mammal, and the mammals that he moves to are either handless apes, eyeless cows, or das Raubtier, the predator. And that's the list. J. Denida: How about the Zugvögel? D. Krell: Migratory birds? Yes, but the birds as showing, as pointing, as daimons. J. Denida: Yet is not the Zug of Was heisst Denken? an Ent-gug? D. Krell: Ent-zug is a withdrawing, or pointing toward what draws us into its withdrawal. But the pointing is said to be not in any way like that of the migratory birds. The Parmenides lecture course, though, is more interesting when it talks about birds. Here birds fly into and show us the open, das Offene, and in singing they call us and make announcements; it also says that the bird ensnares us in the open, or the bird is itself ensnared—σειρά, the origin of the word sirena. Sirens are those who ensnare. K. Wright: Can you really deal with the topic of life in the period you are talking about without considering Heidegger's own opposition to biologism and to the politics of National Socialism? D. Krell: No. I must try to do that. It might be symptomatic of how Heidegger operates on that entire level that—and how—he cites Spengler.</page><page sequence="26">48 David Farrell Krell K. Wright: But he also discusses these things elsewhere. . . . D. Krell: Surely. Throughout the Nietzsche lectures, for example. But in this text (1929/30) there is a strange kind of silence concerning the political context, and one can read this text in very different ways depending on the look or Blick that is on Heidegger's face when he reproduces Spengler's metaphor for the state. Heidegger simply reproduces it, without commentary, and then takes it to be his image of the mammal. Very strange. . . . J. Denida: While it can never be taken as some kind of excuse, I think you do have to take into account the political dimension of biologism. You simply have to. . . . That was a very powerful observation. D. Krell: Yes. But what better weapons Heidegger would have had to train on biologism if his animals had been more highly developed, more complex. NOTES 1.

Note that the English translation (BW, 233) cites the title of Aristotle's treatise incorrectly: μορίων is plural, hence De partibus animalium is the accepted translation, not parte. It seems the editor of BW is under the impression that there is but one animal part, only one part of living beings. 3. The first occasion on which Heidegger tells the story (the first, at least, as far as I know), that is, in a lecture course at Freiburg in 1943 entitled "The Commencement of Western Thought (Heraclitus)," finds him introducing it as follows: "Such 'stories'—even when they are inventions, or precisely because they are such—contain a more original truth than proper data that are established by historical research." See Martin Heidegger, Heraklit, Band 55 of the Martin Heidegger Gesamtausgabe (Frankfurt am Main: Klostermann, 1979), p. 5. (This and all volumes of the Gesamtausgabe will be cited by volume and page in the body of my text as, e.g.: 55, 5.) Just how much, how overmuch, the story "speaks for itself' may be seen in two recent pieces by Robert Bernasconi: "Deconstruction and the Possibility of Ethics," in Deconstruction and Philosophy: The Texts of Jacques Derrida, ed. John Sallis (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986), pp. 122-39; and "The Fate of the Distinction between Praxis and Poiesis," in Heidegger Studies, vol. 2 (1986), pp. 111-39. 4. See, for example, Heidegger's 1929-30 lecture course, Die Grundbegriffe der Meta physik: Welt—Endlichkeit—Einsamkeit, Band 29/30 of the Martin Heidegger Gesamtausgabe (Frankfurt am Main: Klostermann, 1983), p. 319.

In "Logos: Heraclitus Β 50" Heidegger writes: "Saying is a letting-lie-together-before which gathers and is gathered. If such is the essence of speaking,</page><page sequence="27">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 49 then what is hearing? As λέγειν, speaking is not characterized as a reverberation that expresses meaning. If saying is not characterized by vocalization, then neither can the hearing that corresponds to it occur as a reverberation meeting the ear and getting picked up, as sounds troubling the auditory sense and being transmitted. Were our hearing primarily and always only this picking up and transmiting of sounds, conjoined by several other processes, the result would be that the reverberation would go in one ear and out the other. .. . We hear when we are "all ears." But "ear" does not here mean the acoustical sense apparatus. The anatomically and physiologically identifiable ears, as the tools of sensation, never bring about a hearing, not even if we take this solely as an apprehending of noises, sounds and tones. Such apprehending can neither be anatomically established nor physiologically demonstrated, nor in any way grasped as a biological process at work within the organism—although apprehending lives only so long as it is embodied [obwohl das Vernehmen nur lebt, indem es leibt: on the expression wie man leibt und lebt, and on Dasein as "some body who is alive," to which I will advert at the end, see Heidegger's "On the Essence and Concept of Φύσις: Aristotle's Physics Β 1," in W, 326, and his Nietzsche, 2 vols. (Pfullingen: Neske, 1961), I, 119 and 565-56; see also my note in the English translation, Nietzsche, vol. I: The Will to Power as Art (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1979), p. 99; to be cited from hence as NI, 119 and Ni 1, 99]. .. . If the ears do not belong directly to proper hearing, in the sense of hearkening, then hearing and the ears are in a special situation. We do not hear because we have ears. We have ears, that is, our bodies are equipped with ears, because we hear. Mortals hear the thunder of the heavens, the rustling of woods, the gurgling of fountains, the ringing of plucked strings, the rumbling of motors, the noises of the city—only and only so far as they always already in some way belong to them and yet do not belong to them." See the entire passage in Martin Heidegger, Vorträge und Aufsätze (Pfullingen: Neske, 1954), pp. 213-15; English translation in Early Greek Thinking, trans. David Farrell Krell and Frank A. Capuzzi (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975), pp. 64—6; cited as VA and EGT, respectively. See also the lecture course on logic in which this discussion first occurred: 55, 243-47 and 260. Finally, see Martin Heidegger, Der Satz vom Grund (Pfullingen: Neske, 1957), p. 87; cited in my text as SG, 87. 5. The English translations I have used (those by William Ogle and A. L. Peck, with modifications) specify that the stove, furnace or oven is in the kitchen. Thus the first title of my paper was "Someone's in the Kitchen." But when I saw that Heidegger had declined to mention the kitchen in his translation—as though anxious to circumvent that room—I took a closer look at the Greek text, θερόμενσν πρός τφ ΐπνφ ("warming himself at the ίπνός") is all it says, although if Heraclitus invites the strangers to "drop in" we may hope that he is talking about the kitchen. In the kitchen. An ίπνός, Liddell-Scott inform us, is an oven or stove, used especially for heating water for the bath—which might explain the strangers' embarrassment. Or it may mean "the place of the oven, i.e., the kitchen," presuming that the oven is indoors, inside the house, which was and is not always the case in Greece. This is a matter of some importance. For the fourth meaning of the word ίπνός (= κοπρών) is "dunghill or privy." Which might also explain, etc. In a less scatological yet more disquieting vein, the following detail from the 1943 lecture course on Heraclitus: Heidegger may well circumvent the kitchen—if it is a kitchen—but not so the "baker's oven," Backofen, inasmuch as he places Heraclitus not at, near, or even on it, but in it: πρός τώι ίπνώι, wie er sich in einem Backofen wärmte (55, 6-9; 22-3). Heidegger may have been thinking of a Backstube (at 55, 10 he writes Backhaus), where a baker's apprentice might shake off the early morning chill; but it is disconcerting (to say the least—the year is 1943) that Heidegger reiterates the in several times, perhaps playing with the έν- of ένταΰθα. He comes very close to identifying Heraclitus with the bread that "rises in the heat rays," swelling "into radiance," in das Erscheinen (9). Occasionally he uses the preposition an, "at,"</page><page sequence="28">50 David Farrell Krell but only to emphasize the "undignified," "everyday appearance"; when Heraclitus is in the oven (as though in the storm of being) his residence becomes truly un-geheuer, uncommon, unheard-of, "monstrous," de-monstrative. Nor is this the first time Heidegger found himself drawn to centers of califaction. An entire section of his 1942 lecture course on Hölderlin's hymn Der Ister (53, 134—43) is devoted to "the stove" or "hearth," der Herd. Alluding to a fragment of Philolaus, to Plato's Phaedrus (at 246ff., on the feast of gods and daimons), and to Sophocles' and Hölderlin's Antigone, Heidegger celebrates έστία as the "stove [or hearth] of being": "The stove, the place in the home that is homey [die Heimstatt des Heimischen], is being itself. In its light and sparkle, glow and warmth, all beings have always already gathered themselves. Παρέστιος is the one who, tarrying in the vicinity of the stove, belongs together with those who are familiar with the stove, so that everyone who belongs around the stove is like one of the family [ein Trauter], whether he is among the 'living' or the dead" (53, 143). When Heidegger rewrites the Heraclitus story three years later for Jean Beaufret he alters the preposition "in" to "at," "by" or "near". (See W, 185-6.) 6. From the final stanza of William Butler Yeats's "When You Are Old," in Collected Poems (New York: Macmillan, 1956), p. 41: And bending down beside the glowing bars, Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled And paced upon the mountains overhead And hid his face amid a crowd of stars. 7. Silence concerning this problem of translation—except to note that we have precisely the same problem in translating F. W. J. Schelling's various Wesen in the 1809 treatise On Human Freedom and the 1810-14 sketches toward The Ages of the World. That problem will also extend to all matters touching the "abyss," "separation," "decision" and "crisis" in both Heidegger's and Schelling's texts. See Krell, "The Crisis of Reason in the Nineteenth Century: Schelling's Treatise On the Essence of Human Freedom," in The Collegium Phaenomenologi cum: The First Ten Years, ed. Giussepina Moneta, John Sallis, Jacques Taminiaux (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, forthcoming). 8. Cf. the following passage in Heidegger's What Calls for Thinking? taken up by Jacques Derrida in his "Geschlecht II": "We are trying here to learn thinking. Perhaps thinking too is just something like building a cabinet. At any rate, it is a handi-craft [ein Hand-Werk]. The hand is a peculiar thing. In the common view, the hand pertains to the organism of our body. Yet the hand's essence can never be determined or explained in terms of its being a bodily organ that can grasp [ein leibliches Greif organ]. For example, the ape too has organs that can grasp, but it has no hand. The hand is infinitely different from all grasping organs—paws, claws, fangs—different by an abyss of essence [unendlich, d.h. durch einen Abgrund des Wesens verschieden]." See Martin Heidegger, Was heißt Denken? (Tübingen: M. Niemeyer, 1954), pp. 50-1; English translation by Fred D. Wieck and J. Glenn Gray, What Is Called Thinking? (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1968), p. 16. And Jacques Derrida, "Geschlecht II: The Hand of Man According to Heidegger," trans. John Leavey, in Deconstruction and Philosophy (cited in note 3, above). 9. The word abgründig itself appears to be one of those undecidables. In "What Is Metaphysics?" abgründig is used to describe (1) modes of nihilation such as "unyielding antagonism and stinging rebuke" (W, 14; BW, 107); (2) a process of finitation, if that coinage translates Verendlichung, the burrowing action of a finitude beneath finitude, as it were (W, 15; BW, 108); and (3) the very ground (Grund) on which the "truth of metaphys ics" as such dwells (W, 18; BW, 112).</page><page sequence="29">Daimon Life, Nearness and Abyss 51 10.

Faulkner's phrase, touching his own The Sound and the Fury. I first learned of it in Andre Bleikasten's excellent commentary on the novel, The Most Splendid Failure: Faulkner's 'The Sound and the Fury' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1976). 13. See SZ, 6, lines 3 and 5 from the bottom (and £); cf. 16, lines 5 and 10 from the bottom. 14. Heidegger employs the past participle benommen several times in SZ in order to designate a particularly "fallen" state of Dasein—not animals. At SZ, 61 he stresses that being-in-the-world, in taking care (Besorgen), is dazzled [Heidegger's emphasis] by the things it takes care of," so that a merely theoretical "gaping" at things as though they were merely "at hand" is at first impossible. At SZ, 76 he suggests that in its familiarity with innerworldly beings Dasein can "lose itselF' and be "dazed" by those beings. At SZ, 113 (cf. 176 and 271), Heidegger says of the "absorption" (Aufgehen) of Dasein in everydayness, "At first and for the most part, Dasein is benumbed by its world." "Dazzled," "dazed," "benumbed": Dasein apparently is much of the time in the world precisely in the manner in which animals are in their ring or circle. And yet in 1929-30 Benommensein will be used to earmark or brand animals specifically as such, animals exclusively, animals as excluded from any proper world-relation. However, a sixth appearance of the words benommen, Benommenheit in SZ (at 344), radically upsets the sense of the passages we have just now examined. Section 68, "The temporality of disclosedness in general", subsection (b) "The temporality of disposition [Befindlichkeit]," discusses the "mightiness," Mächtigkeit, of anxiety, along with its "peculiar temporality." (That temporality is "peculiar" indeed: it grants the possibility of appropriate Dasein, and yet it temporalizes not out of the future but out of having-been, Gewesenheit, thus subverting the regime of vorlaufende Entschlossenheit.) In the mood of anxiety, "Dasein is taken back fully to its naked uncanniness and is dazzled by it [zurückgenommen und von ihr benommen]. But this bedazzlement [Benommenheit] not only takes Dasein back from its 'worldly' possibili ties but also at the same time grants it the possibility of an appropriate ability-to-be [eines eigentlichen Seinkönnens]". The upshot is that Benommenheit is both that which bedazzles and distracts Dasein, causing it to be lost in the allurements of the world, and that which dazzles Dasein with its own uncanniness, allowing Dasein to find itself as a proper self. (Cf. the use of benommen at 26, 13.) Dasein as forlorn animal and transparent self—in both cases benommen. Is this only an accident of misapplied terminology, or is something unraveling here, something like the simple oppositions of taking/granting, losing/finding? Does such unraveling threaten to undo the entire fabric of fundamental ontology? (I am grateful to Will McNeill, who located these passages in SZ and helped me to understand their importance.) 15. See 29/30, section 60. One sample of the kind of "elimination" Heidegger has in mind (363-64): ". . . all animal behavior [Benehmen] is animated within this fundamental trait of eliminating [Beseitigen] or, as we also say, not-getting-into . . . [ricA nicht Einlassen auf.. .]. One of the most striking examples of this peculiar eliminative trait in all behavior is the comportment [ Verhalten: surely a slip of the pen on Heidegger's part, a slip into the abyss?] of insects within their own surroundings which we call the sex drive [ Geschlechtstrieb]. It is well known that many females gobble up the male after copulation. After copulation the sexual trait vanishes; the male takes on the characteristics of prey and is eliminated. The</page><page sequence="30">52 David Farrell Krell other animal is never there for the first-mentioned animal [i.e., specifically, the female?] as merely alive: it is either a sex partner [Geschlechtsgenosse] or prey, in either case in one way or another already 'gone' [in irgendeiner Form des 'weg']. Behavior as such in each case is in itself an eliminating." To all this one ought to compare in detail Hegel's interpretation of assimilation and the mating process. See G. W. F. Hegel, Enzyklopädie der philosophischen Wissenschaften im Grundisse (1830), eds. Friedhelm Nicolin and Otto Pöggeler (Hamburg: Meiner, 1969), sections 357-66 and 367-76; cf. Hegel's 1805-06 lectures on the philosophy of nature in Gesammelte Werke 8, Jenaer Systementwürfe III, ed. Rolf-Peter Horstmann (Hamburg: Meiner, 1976), throughout. There is some evidence that in the mid-1930s Heidegger accepted without demur Hegel's view of the preeminence of the Gattung or species over the individual members of that species. However, acceptance of such preeminence, I believe, would be one of the hallmarks of metaphysical thinking and ontotheology as such. See Krell, "Pitch: Genitality/ Excrementality from Hegel to Crazy Jane," in boundary 2, 12, 2 (Winter 1984), 113-41. 16. On the distinction between Sterben and Verenden, see SZ, section 49: on the "as structure" as more closely related to Vorhandenheit, see 29/30, 351; on that same structure as regressive in the light of Heidegger's own analyses of mood, attunement, and disposition, see 29/30, 285, 291, 301, 351, 384, 404-5, and all of sections 71-2. 17. 29/30, 387. Cf. the following passage from NI, 460 (Ni 2, 195): "Thus the most durable and unfailing touchstone of genuineness and forcefulness of thought in a philosopher is the question as to whether or not he or she experiences in a direct and fundamental manner the nearness of the nothing in the being of beings. Whoever fails to experience it remains forever outside the realm of philosophy, without hope of entry." 18. VA, 257-82; see esp. 273-82 (EGT, 116-23). See also the 1943 lecture course on which "Aletheia" is based, 55, 1-181 (cited in note 3, above). Heidegger removes from "Aletheia" most of the polemics and political marks from the transcription of that course. He removes many other items as well, and so I shall have recourse to it quite often in the brief sketch that follows. 19.
